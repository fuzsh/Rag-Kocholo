        "text": "Since May 1, 2021, the Republic of South Sudan has required importers of goods to present a valid certificate of conformity (CoC) at the port of entry for consignment clearance. On December 14, 2020, SGS signed a five-year contract with the South Sudan National Bureau of Standards (SSNBS) to provide pre-export verification of conformity (PVoC) services.\n\nThe program covers all products being imported into South Sudan with a value above USD 2,000 and applies to all countries.\n\nObjectives:\n\nEnsure product quality\n\nProtect consumer health/safety\n\nProtect the environment\n\nFacilitate trade by ensuring that compliant goods are given expedited clearance at entry points\n\nSafeguard against unfair trading practices and the dumping of sub-standard goods into the market\n\nSafeguard national security\n\nPrevent deceptive trade practices\n\nTake the Opportunity Now\n\nExporters and importers have an excellent opportunity to participate in the growth of the youngest nation in the world through trade.\n\nSouth Sudan gained independence in 2011 after several years of civil war and in 2016 it joined the East African Community (EAC). 72% of the population is below the age of thirty and 83% of the population lives in the rural areas. This is a country with a huge appetite and potential for growth.\n\nExporters looking to trade with the Republic of South Sudan must submit their application for inspection through the SGS Exporter Portal.\n\nSGS Guidance\n\nDepending on the nature of the goods and the level of quality compliance, there are three certification routes available to exporters – Routes A, B and C.\n\nROUTE A – applicable to trade parties of products imported into South Sudan, who do not have regular shipments or who export products identified as high risk.\n\nROUTE B (Registration) – a fast-tracked route that is applicable to suppliers/manufacturers with a valid quality management system and who frequently ship goods to South Sudan and which are homogenous in nature. Registration is renewable annually, subject to consistent compliance.\n\nROUTE C (Licensing) – this process entails licensing. It is a fast-track option offered to manufacturers with a valid quality management system in place, who regularly import homogenous goods into South Sudan and can be issued following proven conformity to relevant standards. The license is renewable annually, subject to consistent compliance.\n\nNOTE: Application MUST be placed and the inspection performed prior to the consignment leaving the country of origin.\n\nShipping with a Valid CoC\n\nOn December 18, 2021, the Ministry of Trade and Industry issued Ministerial Order No: 18/2021. This revised the penalty for goods arriving at a South Sudanese port of entry without a valid CoC from 15% to 40% of the cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value.\n\nImporters who repeatedly attempt to import goods without a valid CoC will have their import license withdrawn and further legal action will be taken in accordance with relevant laws.\n\nLearn more about South Sudan – Conformity Assessment Program.\n\nThis article can also be found in our PCA Newsletter (Q2/2022) – keeping you up to date with developments in technical barriers to trade and product conformity assessment.\n\nRead more in our PCA Newsletter\n\nQ2/2022\n\nUpdates to SGS’s Pre-Shipment Verification of Conformity Program for the Central African Republic\n\nPre-shipment Verification of Conformity for Tanzania\n\nNew Developments in Uganda’s PVoC Program\n\nQ1/2022\n\nMajor Change in Cameroon – Extension of Cameroon Pre-Shipment Conformity Assessment Program to all Imported Goods\n\nThe Challenge of Import Regulations in Africa and The Middle East\n\nWelcome to Our PVoC Kenya Community\n\nConformity Assessment and Certification for Morocco\n\nSubscribe to our PCA Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to the PCA Newsletter by going to our Subscription Center, selecting Connectivity & Products at Step 1 and then the topic Government & Trade Facilitation at Step 2.\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nHellen Achieng\n\nContract Manager\n\nTrade Facilitation Services, SGS\n\nt: +254 709 633000 / +254 745 348362"
