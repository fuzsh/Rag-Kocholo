        "text": "It was the third bridge over the Liffey and known as Essex Bridge when it opened in 1676. Humphrey Jervis, a local developer, named it in honour of the Earl of Essex who had been recently appointed as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by Charles II. The fashionable area of Capel Street was connected to the crowded, narrow streets on the southside of the river. The bridge, however, was often in need of repair as a result of floods and passage across was sometimes chaotic with carts, horses becoming entangled. With trade growing a new bridge was required and this was undertaken by the engineer George Semple.\n\nHe had also recommended that a new street should be built on the south side of the bridge, facing Capel Street. It was designed in the style of Westminster Bridge and opened in 1755. The new street, Parliament Street, was finished in 1757 and was the same width as the bridge to assist and improve traffic flow.\n\nAlmost a century later it was decided to rebuild the bridge, and Bindon Stone was tasked with important job. The Dublin Port engineer’s work was a masonry bridge with five arches, similar to Semple’s. He did, however, make the new bridge flatter which made traffic safer. Also, he added to the width of the bridge with raised footpaths on both sides which he adorned with iron parapets. These were then completed by the addition of ornamental lamps which are both unique and popular with photographers.\n\nIn 1875 the bridge had its last name change in honour of the parliamentarian Henry Grattan (1746-1820). He was a local having been born in nearby Fishamble Street and who worked hard to improve Ireland’s economic position. For his work in the 1780s & 1790s the government buildings on College Green was commonly known as ‘Grattan’s Parliament’.\n\nHenry Grattan Bridge"
