There are three things we can always be sure we’ll find in a place like Fulham: traditional pubs with lovely beer gardens, many green spaces like Parson Green and Eel Brook Common, and wine bars. We can hear the corks popping and smell the cellars, cheeseboards, and charcuterie. We got a little swept away by the stereotype. Admittedly, we thought there would be more wine bars in Fulham, but then again, it is pretty residential. Don’t let the quantity of the wine bars detract from the important part – the quality.\n\nRead more\n\nOur selection of the 5 best romantic bars in Covent Garden\n\nWhat does romance look like to you? Something tangible like handwritten notes from a beloved, flowers from a not-so-secret admirer or quality time with a special someone. Something abstract like the sweet anticipation of a first (or seventh) kiss or an almost-perfect meet-cute (hey, this is real life). Maybe it’s even something a little more casual. Like a date. Whether it’s the first or the hundredth, at their best, dates can be pretty special. We’ll leave you to think about romance and save the philosophical questions till later. First, let’s take you on a date of the best romantic bars in Covent Garden.\n\nRead more\n\nOur 5 favourite corporate Christmas party venues in Manchester\n\nBy the time it gets to Christmas, everyone finds themselves yearning for a festive break after what feels like the longest year of their life.

One, why does the entire city work here? Two, the area seems to have developed an affinity for certain things. Markets. Repurposed buildings. Coffee shops. Outdoor food courts. Steak. Bakeries.

What with the roasted meats, crispy potatoes and the sweet and savoury tang of stuffing and cranberry sauces, it’s no wonder.

Now introducing the best screening rooms in Soho.\n\nRead more\n\nCovent Garden's 5 best karaoke venues\n\nThe rhythmic step of tourist footfall. The mechanical dings of contactless cards. The melodic buskers that puncture the air with their well-loved instruments. A chorus of chatter. And somewhere in the distance (no, not there, there) the travelling sounds of well-intentioned karaoke sessions to end the night on a high (note). The soundtrack to Covent Garden is something to be heard and experienced.

With more skyscrapers, offices, chain coffee shops, neutral officewear and shiny shoes than you can count, E14 doesn’t play, at least in the metaphorical sense. So it only makes sense to travel east to hire a meeting room. From hotel meeting rooms to open meeting spaces, there’s quite literally, room for everyone.

We took the liberty to make a trip to Islington and here’s a list of our favourite halls.\n\nRead more\n\nOur selection of the best private dining venues in Marylebone\n\nIf you already live west you’re probably no stranger to Marylebone. For Londoners elsewhere, it’s one of those central neighbourhoods that we want to dislike because it can be a little boujee, but we actually kind of like it. Most of the time, if meeting somewhere central, we’d much rather meet people in Marylebone than Soho. It still has the odd tourist about, photographing listed buildings that adhere to their expectations of what they thought London would look like, but it feels far quieter than its neighbour to the southwest. All we’re trying to say is Marylebone isn’t that bad for a central London neighbourhood. It could be much worse. There are decent cafés, cocktail bars (plenty of jazz bars), and restaurants and pubs with great private dining rooms. Speaking of Marylebone private dining, that’s what we’re here to unpack for you…\n\nRead more\n\nThe 5 best function rooms in Victoria\n\nFor quick meetings. For all-day meetings.

Believe it, or not, Embankment has other great sites to offer besides something historical or political, and they are its bars. Just remember, Embankment is much larger than you think. It is a long stretch down the river, starting at Westminster Bridge and finishing at Blackfriars Bridge, and that only means one thing - a lot of places to drink at. So here are our favourites.\n\nRead more\n\nTop karaoke venues in Soho\n\nBustling theatres. Jazzy bars. Hidden restaurants packed with regulars and mouthwatering dishes.

Whilst we can't up your day-to-day tasks, we can give you some spaces that will add a unique twist to your London workday. With everything from prison meeting rooms to an actual Yurt, these unique meeting spaces might just make that next budget review a little less insufferable.\n\nRead more\n\nOur selection of the best City of London meeting rooms\n\nCity of London – a dichotomy between the oldest part of London and the new banking sprawl with its modern glass and steel skyscrapers jutting beyond curving medieval streets. It’s a business and financial centre – and with that comes all the trappings of the corporate world, namely meeting rooms, and bars, but for this list, we’ll only be focusing on the former. Whether you’re looking for a petite and comfortable interview room, a boardroom for ten, or something larger to host visiting delegates, the City is equipped with meeting rooms of all kinds to suit any need and occasion.\n\nRead more\n\nOur selection of the best City of London party venues\n\nNo matter which part of London people are coming from, most people can agree to meet in the middle – that being central London, of course. With a plethora of transport links, the City of London is one of the easiest places to get to and its status as a business and finance centre means there are top-quality restaurants, bars, and clubs. From skyscrapers to basements, we list some of the best City of London party venues.\n\nRead more\n\nOur selection of the best Belgravia bars\n\nIn the Tudor period, Belgravia was a dangerous place due to highwaymen and robberies. It’s no longer dangerous today, but housed on its many cobbled streets are the elegant homes of the wealthy elite who, it could be said, commit highway robbery in one form or another. We may poke jabs at Belgravia with a well-known stereotype, but between the international embassies, garden squares, galleries on Pimlico Road, and designer boutiques on Motcomb Street, Belgravia has so much money there’s actually a pub where its pinned to the ceiling. Still, we think it’s worth a visit. The streets are picturesque and there are some very lovely pubs that offer great hospitality and excellent Sunday Roasts, and swish cocktail bars for a special occasion.\n\nRead more\n\nThe 7 best private dining rooms near London Bridge\n\nA cosy dinner for two. A quick after-work dinner and drinks. A much-needed catchup with a friend. A relaxing solo lunch (or dinner). Take some time to press pause on life’s busyness and recharge with a dinner.

Find a private dining room in, or near London Bridge, for a magical dinner just for you and yours. Bon appétit.\n\nRead more\n\nOur selection of unique Shoreditch venues\n\nBetween the cocktail bars, pubs, and cool galleries, the graffiti, the old warehouses and old flats filled with artists and East End hipsters sipping on free drinks at art exhibitions, Shoreditch was bound – destined – to have some unique venues. There aren’t very many, true, but it’s all about quality rather than quantity as the old adage goes. Whatever event you’re planning here, we’ve got the scoop on unique Shoreditch venues.\n\nRead more\n\nThe 7 best team activity venues in Shoreditch\n\nThe activity bar has declared war on London, and Shoreditch is at the frontline. Barely a pub or bar exists in the neighbourhood that has not embraced the storm of thrown axes, shuffleboards, ball pits, bingo cages or VR headsets. Whilst some lament the death of the humble bar, it feels futile to resist the inevitable. In that spirit, we’ve trawled the avenues and back alleys of Shoreditch to find the activity bars that really are worth your time. Here’re our top picks.\n\nRead more\n\nOur selection of the best Earl’s Court bars\n\nEarl’s Court is probably best known for its colourfully painted houses and its proximity to Stamford Bridge – perhaps. Even that’s a stretch. What Earl’s Court lacks in general relevancy, it definitely makes up for with its modest variety of pubs, cocktail bars, and gastropubs. It may seem like a tiny little portion of K&C, but the reality is there can be so much more to it when you look for it. From a Sri Lankan wine bar to a private detective speakeasy, these bars show Earl’s Court has a lot to offer and can stand on its own two feet.\n\nRead more\n\n6 great Paddington cocktail bars\n\nTwo images come to mind when we hear or read the word Paddington. The first is Paddington Bear even though we have neither read the books nor seen the films – the image exists in the London zeitgeist and we can’t shake it. Second, we think of the Paddington Basin with its canalside barges and Little Venice. We still think East London has more of a hold on canalside bars and nightlife compared to Paddington with its stately homes, and sleek shiny new-build flats and offices. It should be noted, however, that although it's relatively quiet, there is still plenty of nightlife in Paddington with several restaurants and bars serving the locals and the many people passing through Paddington Station. We went on a mission to suss out the best Paddington cocktail bars and we present to you our findings below…\n\nRead more\n\nBirmingham's top 11 venues to hire\n\nBirmingham is no stranger to wonderful places you can hire out. The city of canals, maligned accents and the Balti has had a space renaissance, with many of its old industrial buildings being injected with the city's characteristic ingenuity. We've taken a hard look at the midland's true capital, and collected some of the most original venues Birmingham has to offer. What's more, you can hire many of them for your own private event. So take a look below and let us know if anything catches your eye.\n\nRead more\n\nOur selection of the best London Bridge bars\n\nTourists may be disappointed when they realise London Bridge is not, in fact, the majestic Tower Bridge just down the road. The area does, however, offer plenty of bars, eateries, and the ever-popular Borough Market to soften the blow. The historic, and rather risqué, pastimes of London Bridge have given way to a collection of classic pubs and contemporary wine and cocktail bars, pulling in a mixture of tourists, office workers, and locals that paints a picture of modernity in the oldest part of London. Whether you're after views of the City’s skyline or cosy underground dives, London Bridge isn't falling down, but with all the drinks on offer, your inhibitions just might.\n\nRead more\n\nThe best wine bars in Shoreditch\n\nWe love a great wine bar. There’s something about spending a few hours in comfort, pretending you know the difference between a Merlot and a Pinot Noir, making ambiguous statements about body and depth and notes. Shoreditch may be better known for its clubs and increasingly absurd activity bars, but there are also a handful of venues where you get a seriously good glass of wine. We took it upon ourselves to try out the best of them – so here’re the best wine bars in Shoreditch. Cheers.\n\nRead more\n\nThe 13 best venues in East London\n\nQuirky. Artsy. Cool. No that’s not a new TLC album (we wish), it’s what comes to mind when we think of East London. We like to think of it as the home of happy hours. Or a cornucopia of creativity (and craft beer), if you will. Anyway, there’s always something to do in East London, so we know for sure that you’ll never have a dull moment over in East. From bars and wedding venues to restaurants, studios and country clubs, there’s always an event in East – and with events, come venues.

Guests - a mix between close friends and friends and friends of friends who know how to have a good time. Music - a great playlist is an art, like a well-balanced cocktail or a film that you can’t stop talking about, and with that work of art you need an artist (aka a DJ) to keep the party going. Next, food and drink. Your intended vibe will determine the menu of the night but don’t underestimate the power of Prosecco. Finally, and probably the most important piece of the puzzle, a great party venue. Luckily, we have lots of those.\n\nRead more\n\nThe top 14 restaurants you can hire out in London\n\nLondon – once the setting of campfire stories about food nightmares. The land of beige matter covered in brown slop. The origin of horrors such as the toast sandwich, rice pudding, jellied eels and mushy peas. Chefs used to use the Thames as a cautionary tale to their children; food critics would throw their hands up in despair at anglicised bowls of spag bol; even the animals felt cheated, their untimely death leading only to another cracked plate of rubbery chops. Despair no more! For the lanes and roads of London town are now paved with à la carte menus, you can barely order a sandwich without embarking on a Ph.D. in bread studies. Anyway, here are some of London's best restaurants that you can hire out.\n\nRead more\n\nThe 10 best restaurants for dinner with a view in London\n\nWant to switch it up for dinner?
