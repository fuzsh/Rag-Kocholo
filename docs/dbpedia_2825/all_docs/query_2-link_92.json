        "text": "From Grattan Bridge\n\n16″ x 12″\n\ncanvas\n\nSOLD\n\nGrattan Bridge I’ve painted from several angles and I’m not sure which is my favourite view, but I do like the hippocamp lamps. Growing up I assumed the view east along the river would never change. That was before the IFSC, the Millenium Bridge, the Boardwalk, and George’s Quay Plaza.\n\nclick to enlarge\n\n*PRICE\n\nEvery day I’m going to reduce the price of the painting by €10 until sold.\n\nTuesday, 29/06/2010 = €200\n\nWednesday, 30/06/2010 = €190\n\nThursday, 01/07/2010 = €180\n\nFriday, 02/07/2010 = €170\n\nSaturday, 03/07/2010 = €160\n\nSunday, 04/07/2010 = €150 (+€11 S&H) SOLD\n\nYou can pay via the PayPal link above (incl with credit card) or if you’re known to me give me a shout (via twitter or email: eolai@irishkc.com) to arrange payment by cash/bank transfer/personal cheque\n\nYou can also save paying shipping by collecting the painting from my studio in Lucan or meeting me in Dublin.\n\nGrattan Bridge\n\nNote, for people who don’t know their Dublin bridges Grattan Bridge is often called Capel Street Bridge, joining as it does Capel St on the north side to Parliament Street on the south."
