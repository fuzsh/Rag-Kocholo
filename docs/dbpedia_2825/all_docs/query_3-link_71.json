There are places that just grab you by the throat and seep into your pores to become a part of you.\n\nIt doesn’t really have anything to do with the amount of time you spend there…could be a day, a week, or a month.

My visits to this gorgeous city full of craic (fun, energy, liveliness) have been super short each time, but I was hooked and could go back time after time.\n\nAnd you’d be shocked how much you can see and do in only a day or two here—Dublin is a perfect day or weekend trip!\n\nOther awesome Irish roadtrip tips to plan your own!\n\nThe Medieval Charms of Kilkenny\n\nA Road Trip Along Ireland’s Southern Coast: Things To Do In County Cork & Waterford\n\nReview of Ardmore’s Gorgeous Cliff House Hotel: A Must-Stay\n\nWhy The Charming Village of Ardmore Is a Must-Visit + the Famous Cliff Walk\n\nDriving the Stunning Beara Peninsula\n\nExploring Ireland’s Beautiful Dingle Peninsula (& 10+ Hidden Gems)\n\nWhat to Expect at the Cliffs of Moher (& the Best Alternative Options)\n\nWhy You Should Consider Loop Head Instead of Cliffs of Moher\n\nDuchess For A Day: A Luxury Stay At Dromoland Castle (Co.

Dublin was founded by Danish Vikings in 841. The Vikings slowly converted to Christianity, and the Irishmen and Vikings continued to battle over the years.\n\nThe Normans entered the picture in the late 1100s and a Norman lord and his army crushed both the Vikings and the native Irish. The English king were worried that they were getting too powerful, so got involved and subsequent centuries were under British rule.\n\nIn more recent memory, Ireland is known for a couple of things, including the potato famine in the 1840s that led 2 million people to flee the country and 1 million to starve to death. Dublin was the focal point of the Easter Uprising in 1916, where the Irish pushed back against British rule and tried to create an independent republic.\n\nIt wasn’t successful at the time, and was followed by years of civil war and fighting, but today the Republic of Ireland is its own independent country.\n\nDublin is a city of energy and youth, with a history of poets and rebels. It wears its centuries well, and is SO much fun. The people are welcoming and interesting, and you’ll absolutely love it.\n\nYou might also like: A Guide to Finding the Right Flight Every Time\n\nWhere to stay in Dublin\n\nOur first trip, we stayed at Buswells Hotel (check avails on Booking.com too), which has a great location, was very comfortable, and a good price for central Dublin.\n\nOn the splurge end, a great option is The Merrion (see also on TripAdvisor), which is absolutely gorgeous and will make you feel like a queen (my friend Andrea raved about it).\n\nBoth hotels are located very centrally in St. Stephen’s Green, which is a lovely area and easily walkable to all sorts of sights, restaurants, nightlife, and more.\n\nMy tips for making the most of your visit\n\nHere are a few things to think about overall. I’ll share specific itinerary thoughts below.\n\nIt goes without saying, but get an early start to the day. Dublin shines in the morning!\n\nEat!! Fish & chips, steak & Guinness pie, scones, boxty, colcannon, beer…stop and grab a snack every chance you get!\n\nWalk everywhere. So much of Dublin is just getting a feel for the city, and in our experience it was a super walkable city. From Temple Bar to O’Connell Street to St. Patrick’s Cathedral and all the places between, exploring the nooks and crannies of the city was my favorite part.\n\nOnly do tours like Guinness or Jameson if you’re dying to. They’re fun and if you’re a fan, worth it (also a good way to avoid bad weather for a bit). Consider other smaller ones like Teeling, or even taking a day trip out to a working distillery like Slane.\n\nFind a whiskey shop that offers a tasting or samples, and take them up on it. My dad and I loved that, and the shop sold airplane-size bottles of a lot of the Irish whiskeys (including largely unknown ones) so I grabbed a few as a gift for one of my co-workers.\n\nIf you’re a museum die-hard (I am emphatically NOT), there are a couple of must-sees in Dublin (including the Book of Kells), so do some research on that.\n\nYou might also like: 10 Thing You Have To Do Before Every Trip\n\n2 days in Dublin: structuring your itinerary\n\nGet your walking shoes on, because you’re going to be covering some ground! Dublin is a super walkable city, and the main sights and areas you’ll want to visit are in a fairly compact area. This helps if you only have one or two days in Dublin.\n\nIf you have 1 day in Dublin:\n\nIn my opinion this is a walking day with lots of brief stops rather than structured “visits”. That’s more my style anyway, but is well suited to Dublin.\n\nYou can easily hit the highlights with a day—places like Christ Church Cathedral and St. Patrick’s Cathedral, walking up and down the river, Temple Bar area, Trinity College, St. Stephen’s Green, O’Connell Street, and more.\n\nBased on your interests, if you want to do something that takes a bit longer, I’d go with the Book of Kells and library at Trinity College. A couple other top picks for a longer tour would be Kilmainham Gaol or getting a walking tour at Trinity College.\n\nIf you really want to visit either Guinness or Jameson, I’d recommend choosing one or the other vs. both if you only have one day (or try out Teeling for a smaller, more intimate overview of whiskey distilling).\n\nIf you have 2 days in Dublin:\n\nYou can add on a second distillery/brewery visit if you want.\n\nWith an extra day, you can slow things down and spend a bit more time enjoying each place you visit. Also, it gives you more of a buffer if the weather isn’t cooperating (so if it’s rainy, you may get a second chance to see things).\n\nLook for a place you could experience traditional pub music in the evening of your first day.\n\nYou might also like: How to Choose the Best Hotel or Rental Every Time\n\nWhere to stay in Dublin\n\nThe one time I stayed overnight in Dublin, we stayed at Buswells Hotel and were quite happy with it (though it was a number of years ago). It was clean, good value and great location.\n\nYou might also like: My Favorite Cross-Body Purse for Travel\n\nWhat to do with 2 days in Dublin\n\nHere is a long list (in no particular order) of sights to see, places to walk by, and more!\n\nWalk up and down the River Liffey\n\nWhile you’ll definitely have some specific things you want to see, Dublin is a perfect city for just wandering around, stopping in at shops, taking pictures of the bright colors and (if you get super lucky) enjoying a bright blue sky.\n\nDublin sits on the River Liffey, so there are tons of bridges with different history and architectural styles. Below I show one famous bridge (Ha’Penny) and my personal favorite one (Grattan).\n\nBeyond that, if you have time try to get over and see the Samuel Beckett Bridge. It’s designed so it looks like a Celtic harp (the national symbol of Ireland). I haven’t had a chance to see it but it’s supposed to be cool.\n\nYou might also like: The Only Carry-On Suitcase You’ll Need\n\nI’m going to talk about Ha’Penny, the most famous bridge in Dublin, but first *this one* is actually my favorite bridge. This is Grattan Bridge, originally built in 1676. What I love so much about this bridge is that I’m charmed by the little things—decorative touches on lampposts like these seahorses this fun sea green color.\n\nEven though it’s a driving bridge, it has wide, prettily-landscaped paths for pedestrians and some seating. It’s right in the thick of things, so make sure to get across it at some point on your wanderings!\n\nYou might also like: 20+ Tips to Survive (& Thrive) on a Long Flight\n\nBack in old-timey times, the only way to get across the Liffey was by a terrifying-sounding, overcrowded, and often doomed ferry that slogged back and forth.\n\nThen in 1816 this pretty cast iron bridge opened to anyone who could pay a ha’penny (a half penny, what the ferry cost), and made the ferry redundant. The colloquially-called Ha’Penny Bridge remained the only pedestrian bridge in Dublin for almost two centuries.\n\nI wouldn’t go out of your way to see it, but it’s super central and easy to catch in the course of your wanderings…on one side you’ve got O’Connell Street and on the other Temple Bar, so a walk across isn’t a hardship.\n\nPro tip: on the north side of Ha’Penny, swing by The Winding Stair bookshop, one of the oldest independent bookshops in Dublin. It’s charming and worth a few minutes. I got a copy of Harry Potter in Gaelic that I love.\n\nMeander through Trinity College\n\nThis never gets old, and on a nice day it’s one of my favorite places in Dublin—simply BEAUTIFUL! Founded in 1592, this college is one of the centers of how the modern literary world (in the West) developed…authors like Jonathan Swift, Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker, Samuel Beckett, and others trace their roots here.\n\nThe college is home to the Book of Kells as well as a stunning library that I still haven’t seen and am dying to. The Book of Kells is a beautifully-decorated vellum copy of the four gospels in Latin from around 800 AD. It’s illustrated with vivid colors and pictures, and the best surviving example of Celtic art.\n\nYou might also like: My Fave Korean Face Sunscreens & Moisturizers for Travel\n\nI’ve only hung out in this open square, and taken about a billion pics, but there’s a lot more you can do here if you have the time and inclination. Students lead walking tours of the campus for those interested (I think it costs €10, but that may have changed).\n\nIn particular, consider visiting the library and Book of Kells. Visits are self-guided, with displays to help you better understand the history.\n\nThere aren’t reservations, so in the summer months there can be a pretty decent line so make sure to plan for extra time. Check the official website to make sure it’s open and on display (sometimes it’s not), and learn more about costs and opening times.\n\nYou might also like: The Best Travel Pillow for Different Types of Sleepers\n\nSt. Stephen’s Green\n\nThis serene, beautiful public park dates back to Victorian times. It has tons of walking paths, a duck pond, lots of statues…spend a half hour meandering through the paths and stepping away from the city’s bustle. Unless it’s pouring, of course!\n\nYou might also like: 11 of My Best Tips for ANY Trip\n\nSt. Patrick’s Cathedral\n\nOf course you can’t spend even 1 or 2 days in Dublin without a trip to St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Founded on the spot where it’s believed St. Patrick baptized the first Irish believers into Christianity, it’s been a part of Dublin life for over 800 years.\n\nIt’s a great example of medieval architecture, dating back to the early 13th century, though the first church on this spot was built in the 5th century. I loved that there weren’t tons of people milling around so I could get beautiful pictures, with the fountain and bright flowers popping against the lines of the cathedral.\n\nI haven’t been inside (I’m not super into the inside of cathedrals), but there’s lots to see as well as choir performances, events, and more. Check the official website for hours and more details.\n\nYou might also like: Travel FAQ: How to Pay for Things Overseas & Other Travel Money Tips\n\nChrist Church Cathedral\n\nSo while St. Patrick’s is really cool, I think that Christ Church Cathedral is even cooler. This style of architecture is one I particularly love…look at the top of that tower, those little jaggedy edges (crenelations?).\n\nIt’s Dublin’s oldest building, dating all the way back to 1030 AD (though initially established by Norsemen as a Viking church and not brought into the Irish church until 1152). Although to be fair, the original structure was wooden and burned down in the Norman invasion, so this stone structure was built in 1171.\n\nYou might also like: 13 Cool Souvenir Ideas To Pick Up While Traveling\n\nEnjoy the details and whimsy\n\nAs I mentioned at the outset, a lot of the things to “see” in Dublin are all about wandering the city. Yes, there are a few historic sites that are critical, but Dublin is all about VIBE.\n\nRather like Lisbon, some of my favorite things about Dublin are just the details…I’m obsessed with the different shapes and sizes and styles of buildings, the bright colors, the quirky little details that beg you to notice them.\n\nYou might also like: My Trip Planning Process: Inspiration>Research>Reality\n\nDon’t forget to look up…there are so many fun details above you. And I love all the colorful doors of Dublin.\n\nSee how different all these buildings are?? But they all mesh together so well. I AM CHARMED.\n\nYou might also like: A Travel Bucket List for Your 30s\n\nO’Connell Street & the General Post Office\n\nFrom a more modern historic standpoint, one can’t-miss is O’Connell Square and the General Post Office. In addition to it being a beautiful building and the last great Georgian building constructed here, the General Post Office was the headquarters for the uprising’s leaders during the Easter Rising of 1916.\n\nIt was damaged quite a bit during and you can still see bullet holes in some of the columns. I also loved the Spire of Dublin, it was super fun to photograph. With only one day in Dublin, O’Connell Street may or may not make the cut based on your level of interest, but if you have two days in Dublin I (personally) think it’s a must.\n\nYou might also like: 10 Places I’m Dying to Visit in 2020\n\nWalk around Temple Bar\n\nI never spend much time in the Temple Bar area, but you definitely have to do at least a stroll through it. Named after a famous bar there of the same name (make sure to swing by!), this is synonymous with tourist antics in Dublin.\n\nIt’s not as crazy during the day, but at night transforms into drunken tourist (and hen/stag party) chaos. Not for me, but for many people it’s a must in Dublin. Just don’t think you’re getting the “authentic Irish pub” experience here.\n\nYou might also like: My All-Time Favorite Bra for Travel\n\nSwing by and say hi to Molly Malone\n\nOne of the most recognizable symbols of Dublin, you can’t visit without stopping by to say hi to the statue of Molly Malone. A fishmonger and working girl, she died of cholera in one of the many epidemics that swept Dublin regularly, and was later immortalized in song. Her statue is affectionately called “The Tart with the Cart”, and is now located on Suffolk Street.\n\nSnap a quick pic, but I beg of you, don’t be one of those MANY tourists who grab her boob for a photo op…it’s not a good look, guys. And I wouldn’t go out of your way to hit this unless it’s on your route.\n\nYou might also like: How To Plan A Trip: Important Questions To Guide You\n\nTour Guinness Storehouse\n\nSo Guinness is definitely a different experience from Jameson (more on that below). It’s a self-guided tour, and is a little…like Disneyland? That’s not a bad thing, just quite the sensory overload and it’s absolutely massive.\n\nThis site has been the home to Guinness since 1759 (when their founder signed a 9,000 year lease…dude did not have commitment issues). It’s now a seven-story experience dedicated to the history of the making of Guinness.\n\nI bought my ticket ahead of time (official website here) and queued for my tour time. I sped through it—both because I’m fairly impatient, but also because I work in the alcohol industry and at a certain point, you can only learn about barley, distillation, etc. so many times 🙂\n\nI did buy a couple souvenirs, and then made my way up to the Gravity Bar on the 7th floor for my free pint and the view. The view is great but it was crowded and so not really my vibe, but glad I stopped in.\n\nRead my full post about visiting Guinness Storehouse!\n\nYou might also like: The 10 Best Books I Read In 2019\n\nEven if you don’t do the Guinness tour, there are a number of things around the brewery (and around the city) that will make fun, vibrant photos.\n\nAND, Guinness has opened a new experimental brewpub taproom called Open Gate Brewery just a few minutes’ walk from the storehouse. I’ve heard it’s super cool but they weren’t open the last time I was there…they’re only open certain days so check the website ahead of time.\n\nYou might also like: 7 Travel Intentions for 2020\n\nTake a tour of Jameson\n\nI’d made a reservation at Jameson for a tour, and storm clouds were threatening and sprinkles had started as I made it to the distillery. I lucked out because it poured while I was in there, and didn’t rain on me the rest of the time. I hadn’t even brought a jacket on this trip (a day trip from out in the country), which was ballsy!\n\nJameson is the most well-known Irish whiskey in the world, and they offer tours at the location where they were founded in Dublin. It’s no longer a working distillery (they’ve moved to much larger operations outside the city), but the tour is pretty decent and informational, and they do a nice job incorporating technology into the experience.\n\nIt’s about a 40-minute tour and then there’s a short tasting. You can hang out at the lovely bar area afterward if you’re inclined and order more interesting drinks. You can learn more about the tour, times, costs, etc. at the official website. Personally I don’t think it’s a must-do if you only have one or two days in Dublin, but is certainly fun.\n\nRead my full post about visiting Jameson Distillery\n\nYou might also like: Travel FAQ: Things You Might Not Know About Your Credit Card\n\nOr consider the smaller Teeling’s distillery\n\nIf Jameson feels too “all the tourists do it”, then maybe you should pop in at Teeling’s instead. It is a smaller, more intimate tour experience, with knowledgeable guides and a cocktail at the end.\n\nTeeling’s connection to Dublin dates back to the late 1700s, and this specific distillery is the first new one to open in Dublin in 125 years. Check tour times and prices here.\n\nKilmainham Gaol\n\nI don’t have any pics of this, but if you’re open to something that’s rich in history (but admittedly a bit of a downer), Kilmainham Gaol has a ton to offer. Dating back to the late 1700s, it housed many Irish revolutionaries, including those who led the 1916 Easter Rising.\n\nMany rebels and criminals (including children) were imprisoned and executed by the British for more than a century…I’m by no means an expert (especially since I haven’t had a chance to take the tour), so you can read up on some of the specifics here.\n\nSplurge on a fancy afternoon tea\n\nI didn’t get a chance to do this in Dublin, but have previously in London and at the gorgeous Dromoland Castle in western Ireland—and it’s an experience not to be missed!\n\nGet a little dressed up and sip some fragrant tea (or go nuts and get champagne), eat your bodyweight in fluffy scones and jam, devour delicious sandwiches and pastries, and generally congratulate yourself on solid decision making.\n\nA few of the best in Dublin are at The Shelbourne, The Merrion, and The Westbury. The pics below are from champagne afternoon tea at The Westbury, from my friend Andrea who highly recommends it!\n\nIf you’re traveling to Co Clare, try afternoon tea at Dromoland Castle!\n\nWhere to eat in Dublin\n\nI haven’t spent more than a couple days here, so this is just a place to start. With 2 days in Dublin I’d recommend looking for a mixture of great traditional Irish and pub food, and finding some of the newer evolving Irish cuisine that’s put Dublin on the map for foodies.\n\nMy favorite stop on my most recent trip was Gallagher’s Boxty House, which I heard about from the Netflix show “Somebody Feed Phil“. I swung by their home in Temple Bar to see if it lived up to the hype. I had the boxty sampler platter, which includes dumplings (like gnocchi), bread, and fries. The fries were BOMB, and I could have eaten a couple orders of them alone.\n\nI enjoyed one of their Jack Smyth stout beers with my snack, and later came back for a couple gin & tonics from their surprisingly interesting gin menu. Overall I totally recommend a stop here—delish!\n\nYou might also like: Detailed Tips for the Best City Photography\n\nOne super interesting and delicious place to consider is Brother Hubbard. It came recommended from a couple places, including a work colleague and “Somebody Feed Phil“. It’s a great example of the interesting food scene that’s developed in Dublin, absolutely delicious food with a Middle Eastern/Mediterranean flair.\n\nI started my morning here one day (though had already eaten breakfast so had to really stuff myself). I had a chocolate babka roll and Turkish eggs menemen topped with amazing whipped feta and olive yogurt, and was mad I couldn’t make myself eat more.\n\nAnother great breakfast or snack spot is the adorable Queen of Tarts bakery in Temple Bar. I fortified myself with a blueberry scone with jam and a cappuccino (the first of many!) before hitting the pavement on my first visit.\n\nAs you’re pounding the pavement, a stop at Murphy’s is a must. Originally from Dingle, they have a few shops sprinkled throughout Ireland, and their ice cream flavors are fascinating and awesome.\n\nI had the Dingle sea salt as well as the brown bread. I’d totally recommend both. I’ve heard there’s a Dingle gin flavor and was bummed it wasn’t on the menu when I visited…\n\nBut this is only the tip of the iceberg where the Dublin food scene is concerned. There’s tons of great traditional food, and a lot of fun pubs as well.\n\nWhat are some less-known things to do with one or two days in Dublin that we missed?
