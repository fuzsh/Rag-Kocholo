        "text": "There are currently 21 bridges that cross the River Liffey but the chances are you only know the name of three or four, like the O'Connell bridge and the Ha'penny bridge.\n\nBut what about the other 19? Don't they deserve some recognition?\n\nHere are the names, the people behind the names and the years the bridges were installed in the fair city, starting from east to west.\n\nAnna Livia Bridge\n\nFormerly known as Chapelizod bridge, chances are you aren't even aware of that bridge over the Liffey is called Anna Livia.\n\nFirst built in 1753, the bridge was renamed in 1982 to coincide with the centenary of James Joyce's birth. The name 'Anna Livia' is the name given to the River Liffey in Joyce's 'Finnegans Wake'.\n\nIsland bridge\n\nNamed after the area of the Liffey in which it crosses. It was renamed to island bridge after independence having previously been named Sarah's bridge, after the wife of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.\n\nLiffey Viaduct / Railway bridge\n\nSome bridge names just get straight to the point and are named after their purpose. Opened in 1887, the viaduct acted as a railway interchange for three of Dublin's five main stations: Broadstone, Heuston and Amiens Street.\n\nSeán Heuston Bridge\n\nBuilt in 1828, it was originally named Sarsfield Bridge after Patrick Sarsfield, it was renamed in 1941 to commemorate Seán Heuston who was executed for his part in the Easter Rising.\n\nFrank Sherwin Bridge\n\nThe first bridge in the list built by Dublin Corporation. It was completed in 1982 as a way to remove excess traffic from the Seán Heuston bridge. It was named after a local councillor.\n\nRory O'Moore Bridge\n\nFirst built in 1670, it was then known as Bloody Bridge due to an attempt by local ferrymen to destroy it multiple times.\n\nIt was rebuilt in 1859 and given the name Victoria and Albert bridge. This was then changed to Rory O'Moore bridge to honour one of the leaders of the plot to capture Dublin in the rebellion of 1641.\n\nMellows Bridge\n\nThe oldest bridge currently in use in Dublin city, it was built between 1764 - 1768 and was originally named Queens bridge after Charlotte of Mecklenburg.\n\nIt was then renamed to honour Queen Maeve in January 1922. In 1942, it was changed to Mellows Bridge to honour Lieutenant General, Liam Mellows, of the Irish Republican Army who was executed during the Irish Civil War.\n\nJames Joyce Bridge\n\nNamed after the Dublin author James Joyce, the Spanish-designed bridge aptly faces onto No15 Ushers Island, which was the set-piece location for Joyce's \"The Dead\".\n\nFr Matthew Bridge\n\nThe bridge was opened in 1818 and like a lot of other bridges in the capital, it took its original name from British state officials. It was first named Whitworth Bridge after Charles Whitworth, the 1st Earl of Whitworth.\n\nIn the 1920's, it was renamed Dublin Bridge and stayed like that until 1938 when it was given the name Father Matthew Bridge in honour of the temperance campaigner, Theobald Matthew.\n\nO'Donovan Rossa Bridge\n\nJust after you pass the Four Courts, you will come across O'Donovan Rossa Bridge. Named after the Irish revolutionary figure Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa.\n\nTo this day, the iconic graveside oration given by Padraig Pearse at O'Donovan Rossa's funeral is read aloud every year in Glasnevin Cemetery.\n\nGrattan Bridge\n\nGrattan Bridge connects Capel Street on the north side of the Liffey with Parliament street on the south.\n\nIt's named after Irish MP, Henry Grattan who believed Ireland should be granted its status as an independent nation while remaining closely tied to Britain by a common crown and political tradition.\n\nMillennium Bridge\n\nBuilt to coincide with the new Millennium and joins Eustace Street in Temple Bar to the north quays. It was installed in 1999.\n\nHa'penny Bridge\n\nProbably the most famous of Dublin's bridges, the name ha'penny does not actually come from how much you had to pay to cross it back in the day.
