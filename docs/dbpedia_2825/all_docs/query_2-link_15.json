        "text": "There are many hidden treasures in Dublin that none of the touristic guides will talk about. But lucky you, at the Davenport hotel, we know Dublin like the back of our hands including all its secret places and hidden gems. So let us take you on a journey to alternative attractions in Dublin that Dublin tourist guides won’t tell you about:\n\nThe Hungry Tree\n\nAt King’s Hill garden, you can have a nice stroll and admire the majestic London plane tree…. eating a bench. This unusual scene is can be seen at Constitution Hills, Inns Quay, Dublin 7. This tree has become a VIP and appeared in various films such as Becoming Jane and Albert Nobbs.\n\nSea-horses over The Liffey River\n\nGrattan bridge was built in 1872 and despite its numerous renovations one detail is left untouched: the ornate cast iron lamp standards on the bridge. At their base are two mythical hippocampi from Greek mythology. They were a symbol of Dublin as a marine city and a memory of the original bridge.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bjvisprjge3/?taken-at=21182\n\nIveagh Gardens\n\nThis hidden garden is designated as a National Historic Property but is the most unknown public spaces of Dublin City. Surrounded by building, the Iveagh Gardens is a hidden gem with landscape features dating from 1865 such as fountains, statutes, a maze and a waterfall. The garden is located between Clonmel Street and Upper Hatch Street.\n\nGraffiti Museum\n\nDublin’s Street art is a star on Instagram and you can’t cross the city without noticing some giant masterpiece gracing its façade. In fact, some have been made by renowned artists such as Conor Harrington, Maser, Fintan McGee and El Mac. For a sample of the best artwork of the city, head to the Tivoli car park. Each year during the All City Jam. Ireland’s finest Graffiti Writer gather to spray their art in this place.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BYDoAuJHz9Q/?tagged=tivolicarpark\n\nThe Huguenot Cemetery\n\nIt is easy to pass in front of the gate of the Huguenot Cemetery without paying attention. This small cemetery is an oasis of tranquillity located in Merrion Row. Dating from 1693 those buried there are descendants of Huguenots who escaped persecution in France following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\n\nSt. Valentine\n\nDid you know that St.Valentine, the Patron Saint of love is from Ireland? You can find its relics in Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin 2. So while visiting Dublin you can go to his shrine to ask him to protect your marriage or to help you find love.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BQfzFsfDRgx/?taken-at=612665879\n\nDo you know any other secret place?
