The Essex Bridge was built in 1676, named to honor Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, and it was damaged by flooding in 1687. The bridge was rebuilt from 1753 to 1755 to correct flood and other structural damage, and, for much of the 18th century, Essex Bridge was the most westerly bridge on the Liffey. The bridge was reopened in 1874 and named for nationalist MP Henry Grattan."
