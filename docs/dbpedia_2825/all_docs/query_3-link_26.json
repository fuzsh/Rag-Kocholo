Those in the pavements either side are still missing though.\n\nAnd the Boardwalk cafes seem to have moved…will repositioning them really make a difference? I would be interested to see…\n\nDoes anyone what happened to the bookmarket idea on Grattan Bridge? It looked like such a good proposal…\n\nnotjim\n\nParticipant\n\ni was wondering that too, the original claim was the the booths were being built in barcelona and would be ready for paddy’s day, not the spire is lit maybe the booths will arrive.\n\ncolinsky\n\nParticipant\n\ni believe the book market launch is planned for the NEXT millenium.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nSimilar cafes etc on the new proposed boardwalk at Eden Quay would help a lot in drawing tourists (& citizens) over to the east for once, down to the Custom House area – and help improve this neglected quay as well.\n\nblue\n\nParticipant\n\nCrossed Gattan Bridge this morning and Pierse where digging up the new paving in very specific places.\n\nLooks like they are unearthing services for the long awaited book stalls. Could this be true? Can anyone confirm?\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\nhas anyone seen the plans for whatever is going to go up in place of the Laughter Lounge on Eden Quay ??\n\ndc3\n\nParticipant\n\nSupposed to be a night club in place of the Laughter Lounge, I believe.\n\nAnonymous\n\nInactive\n\nWas’nt that one of the places given tax incentives under the O’Connell Street Integrated Area Plan?\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nArent those foundations taking forever to lay… Do you think they had a lot of problems with water seeping in from the Liffey\n\nnotjim\n\nParticipant\n\nthey seemed to stop completely for a long time, either they ran out of money or they found some unexpected challenge, for eg with water.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nSaw a picture of Eden quay in the 1930s in a window on Talbot St the other day, it used to be so well scaled and planned. The Laughter Lounge site had a 4 bay arched facade, and built of similar materials to the buildings on either side still there.\n\nWhat ever planner granted permission permission for the destruction of this building, wrecking the unity of the terrace, and for it to be replaced with a black brick wall, must have been of their head.\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nYeah, I think that arched building was the Corinthian Cinema, an art deco classic. It would be listed and jealously guarded were it still around today.\n\nUnbelievable losses (and awful replacements) were the order of the day back then (’60s or ’70s).\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nJust looking at a picture of The Corinthian again in ‘Lost Dublin’ -: it wouldn’t have been in the same league as the Theatre Royal, but it was a nice enough 20th cen. front all the same.\n\nRemember the Laughter Lounge before about 1995 when it was the Screen cinema? It was just an unpainted blank concrete wall; an incredible 2 fingers to the city centre.\n\nHaven’t seen the plans for new replacement building.\n\nGregF\n\nParticipant\n\nAye that (The Laughter Lounge, aka the Odeon cinema or Screen 2 cinema , or whatever it was once called) had to be one of the most ugliest buildings in Dublin, especially too if a far more finer building (aka the Corinthian) was sacrificed to replace it.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nAhem, rather the planner was OFF his head.\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nThe cinema was called the Astor.\n\nWork continues on the Bookmarket on Grattan Bridge today and the Boardwalk extension on Eden Quay\n\nblue\n\nParticipant\n\nI hope the book market is a success. Its quite an exposed area!\n\nThe cafes on the board walk seem to have weathered the initial scepticism.\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nWern’t those Boardwalk cafes individually run in the beginning? – Now they’re all run by the one company. Blasted homogenisation!\n\nNot to be critical, the cafes are great in the summer.\n\nRory W\n\nParticipant\n\nThe cinema was called the Astor.\n\nNope that was the cinema next door (it became a rather dodgy video shop at one stage (private viewing booths – indeed). The Corinthian was refaced to become the Odeon. The odeon begat the Screen at O’Connell Bridge, which begat the Laughter lounge. The Astor was another separate entity altogether.\n\nRory W\n\nParticipant\n\nBloody hell that was quick!\n\nOvernight the book stalls have appeared on Gratten Bridge. I might be able to get there at lunch and grab a photo.\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nTheyre quite nice but very large….\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nvery very large…\n\nblue\n\nParticipant\n\nSome pics – excuse the quality, used a phone.\n\nblue\n\nParticipant\n\n.\n\nblue\n\nParticipant\n\nThe back (from the road)\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nIm reserving final judgement until they are finished but on first impressions they seem very obtrusive. Its odd though: they look different from Capel St (very in your face) to Parliamnet St (much easier on the eye).\n\nAnonymous\n\nInactive\n\nStephenC, that is probably because on Parliament Street (correct me if I am wrong here) you can view them from higher up than you can from Capel Street. Parliament Street is also wider than Capel Street which would make a difference i think.\n\nAnonymous\n\nInactive\n\nI was very surprised when I saw them during the week. beforehand I thought they had done an excellent job on the bridge, making a open and clean space. Now it appears this things are very obstrusive on what what i thought was a well done public space. I’ll wait to see them when they’re finished to make my mind up but at the moment I’m wary. I imagined something different when they mentioned a book market – something more in the line of the book market in Temple Bar rather kioskville – but I suppose it is more in line with Europe where the kiosk predominates.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nOnce they are open perhaps they will become more transparent – although, there’s no provision for windows to the rear.\n\nFor once, pedestrians have been given precedence over motorists with the kiosks looking much better from the pavement.\n\nWhat they look like from the road or from the other side mustn’t be too pleasant.\n\nGenevieve\n\nParticipant\n\nThanks for enlightening me re Grattan Bridge works.\n\nWhile I think they look pretty ugly, I’m hopeful it will be different when they open , as I love what the boardwalk has done for the way I experience the city.\n\nIt didn’t even cross my mind that it would be a book market. I though maybe a flower stall and a newspaper kiosk from the look of them.\n\nAnyway looking forward to seeing how this evolves 😀\n\njupiter\n\nParticipant\n\nwere the new kiosks specifically designed , and if so by who?\n\njupiter\n\nParticipant\n\ndoes anyone know if the kiosks were specifically designed for grattan bridge, and if so, by who?\n\njupiter\n\nParticipant\n\noops\n\nemf\n\nParticipant\n\nFrom todays Irish Times:\n\nLiffey kiosks are ‘visual vandalism’, council told\n\nFrank McDonald, Environment Editor\n\nThe architect of a planned European-style book market on Grattan Bridge has appealed to the public to suspend judgment on the project until it is finished.\n\nCapel Street art gallery owner, Mr Gerald Davis, has complained to Dublin City Council that four new kiosks intended as elaborate book stalls were “totally out of place” and amounted to “visual vandalism” of views of the Liffey.\n\nHowever Mr Dave Richards, of Gilroy McMahon architects, said the kiosks were “like a piano with its lid down” at present. “They have to be seen with their panels opened out and awnings down.”\n\nMr Richards said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the reaction so far, even from wisecracking Dubliners. “In general, people are delighted to see this type of thing happening here.”\n\nThe kiosks were prefabricated in Spain as part of a â‚¬2 million project to turn Grattan Bridge, which links Capel Street with Parliament Street, into a contemporary version of an inhabited bridge, such as the Ponte Vecchio in Florence.\n\nCity architect Mr Jim Barrett said the proposed book market on Grattan Bridge was the latest phase of the city council’s plan to enable people to enjoy the river.\n\nThe â‚¬2 million budget included a major reconstruction of the bridge deck, new granite paving for the footpaths and a set of benches with wooden seats and toughened glass backs.\n\nThe kiosks are due for completion by St Patrick’s Day. The first one to open on a pilot basis will be a book sales outlet for the Hugh Lane Gallery.\n\nMr Richards said the idea was to recreate something which the city used to have – the bookstalls on Bachelor’s Walk and Wellington Quay which brought a touch of the Seine to the Liffey.\n\nÂ© The Irish Times\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nPredestrian side\n\nRoadway side\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nNice one Paul!\n\nHow about one of these:\n\nhttp://www.dezain.net/2003/scape/25.jpg\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nWe’ve already got one. Its called the James Joyce bridge\n\nGregF\n\nParticipant\n\nI think the kiosks look a bit cumbersome, resembling pre fabs or cargo boxes, giving a cluttered effect on the briidge. Maybe they should have been installed at the time the bridge was revamped, would have avoided this reaction now. But we should give them a chance however.\n\nIn hindsight, It’s good to see that the Liffey boardwalk has been a good success however despite all the initial nagative talk from An Taisce and the like etc….. Maybe Cork, etc ….could have the same.\n\nO’ Connell Street will prove to be a success too, despite the negative talk from the Green Party etc….\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nnull\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nI am a fan of the boardwalks myself, but lets get one thing straight here.\n\nOriginally posted by GregF\n\nIn hindsight, It’s good to see that the Liffey boardwalk has been a good success however despite all the initial nagative talk from An Taisce and the like etc…..\n\nLet us be fair here, some people are of the opinion that Dublin city council, like to be seen as their own bosses in everything, the heros. Which often has the negative impact, that they do not always bring in the ideas and people who could really do a much better job in some cases. Of course Dublin city council have a huge bargaining chip with developers, as witnessed by that pedestrian bridge, over to Abbey street rubbish then have just completed. But the insight and understanding they display every time they try to use that bargaining chip, is very suspect in my opinion.\n\nI think that developers are far too savy, and the Dublin city council far to naive in 2004. Frank McDonald painted a very rosy picture of Dublin city council last week, and while in large part it is true – they still don’t always get it right by any manner or means.\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nIf you get a chance paul, point that camera of yours down to the building, at the pedestrian crossing from teh new ped bridge.\n\nI have visions of ‘John Wayne’ lasso-ing one of those columns some day and allowing his horse to give it a good thug, wild west fashion.\n\nWorst ‘muck’ design I have seen in a while, and yet another obviously statement, that architectural technologists/tossers in DCC are still doing the architecture all along dublin’s quays.\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nHere ya go\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nWell so much for the idea of buying a good digital camera to record my impressions of what I experience in architecture! Even though they can be useful for some kind of record, or places abroad etc, etc.\n\nYa know what guys, I am going to level with you all straight up here – and admit, that I have loads more brushing up to do on my discursive abilities and skills, compared to much of the fine discussion and debaters here at Archiseek. It has always been my biggest single reason for failure at various endeavours related to architecture. So good discursive abilities are key to sucess in most lines of work I think.\n\nHowever, I think I have a pretty keen eye when it comes to smelling a real turkey in real world architecture, and you cannot actually tell from the above images what I am talking about. In some odd way, those photographs actually make the thing look good! Yet, when I walk around and through that area of town, I know deep down the thing is a complete ‘kick for touch’ in terms of architectural design. I have spoken here in support of the new rendering technologies available to architects – which produce photographic images.\n\nBut whoever, doesn’t believe me should actually go and visit this place in question. It is a clear example of where the developer produced maybe a couple of nice 3DS VIZ images, that looked okay, and decided well let’s just do it. And that is the whole point, looking at those images, the development looks fine. But in reality, you just know it isn’t, strange. So people don’t judge how bad the development really is, just by those photographs – rather go and experience it and report back please.\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nIts both a good development and bad architecture. It opens up a new route and uses the land efficently but the architecture sucks donkey balls. The bottom picture shows the horrendous join of the new building to the old facade which is terribly crude. Recessing the shopfront behind the original facade is badly thought out – it now provides a great public urinal. And as for the tower….\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nIt goes way beyond sucking any balls at this stage in Ireland Paul, it passed that stage back around 1999/00 as I recall correctly. Think of dentists when they qualify usually go to some other country for a while and work at very cheap rates in order to ‘get practice’. (I.e. Get all the real baddies out of their system) While some poor guy over in unemployment England is left holding his jaw for the rest of his life. This is an example of that in architecture.\n\nThe boss architects in this country should begin realising this, and take their heads out of their BMW catalogues and golfing magazines long enough, just to see what their latest recruit from Eastern Europe is doing with his/her cracked copy of 3DS MAX. :)And perhaps give a job to someone like myself, who cannot afford to make these kinds of balls jobs in the same country that I wish to live/work in.\n\nGenevieve\n\nParticipant\n\nI can put up with the river side, it’s not that offensive. However what about the other side of this development , on Abbey street. It is the 1960s concrete look , so ugly.\n\nThe path for pedestrians should be wide, instead it feels closed in with a concrete overhang and obstructed by large concrete pillars. What a pity\n\nGenevieve\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nAnyone care to do the Group 91 bridge anecdote here? I am tired of typing. 🙂\n\nAnyhow, I will just cross link this here:\n\nhttps://archiseek.com/content/showthread.php?s=&threadid=2744\n\nCarlisle Pier thread.\n\ndc3\n\nParticipant\n\nNow it just came to me what these new kiosks resemble.\n\nHuge scaled up versions of the huts for the car park attendants at BCP car parks in the UK.\n\nAndrew Duffy\n\nParticipant\n\nIsn’t the Abbey St. side actually a 60’s building called Chapter House? Also bear in mind that the extremely bleak Wast facing wall is soon to be covered up by whatever CIE is building on its former depot.\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nChapter House was only completed last year. Is it all part of the one development. I have to be honest and say that I dont really find this scheme as awful as the rest of the thread. I agree its hardly inspiring architecture but then we never really see alot of that these days do we.\n\nCapel Ste is another example. Theres another bland and boring box being constructed on the corner of Marys Abbey and Capel and another planned for opposite. Together they will both dramatically chnage the appearance of a virtaul intact Victorian commercial street. They are completely inapproriate.\n\nCapel St is great. It has hung on in there despite the death of streets and shops like these in 1980s. All it needs is some judicious urban planning and it could become a great thoroughfare again.\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nOkay. Good observation, to look at what is going on in the whole general area. Still that Group 91 Poddle Bridge and Jervis Street route, was about ‘that whole general area’ too. This DCC bridge and route it has now burrowed through a pile of developer’s rubbish is a sad, sad compromise – where does that little alley lead to anyway? How does it improve pedestrian flow, by landing you straight outside a big blank wall elevation of the Jervis Centre?\n\nI mean, if the Poddle bridge location, had been used instead for a new pedestrian bridge, it would have brought in the meeting house square in Temple Bar, and the whole of Jervis St leading up as far as Parnell st, etc into the picture of people movement in Dublin city centre. Pull out that OS map and have a look if you don’t believe me.\n\nThe new pedestrian bridge which DCC done, in defiance of Group 91 and Temple Bar properties is just in a bad location whichever way you look at it.\n\nI hate, that ‘zig-zag’ maneuvre you have to make, having crossed the new ped bridge, to get onto the Jervis St, direct route up as far as Henry St, Parnell st. That count-down clock is supposed to be so helpful, but It is really just a waste of money building that new pedestrian bridge where they built it.\n\nJust a very, very sad example of DCC trying to ascert whatever authority they think they have, over the Temple Bar thing, which they weren’t part of.\n\nThe fact that DCC burrowed through a developer scheme, to make some gesture towards the urban theme, doesn’t change one thing I am sorry. And what is going on over in Capel St, is just another typical Archiseek, lets do aesthetic ping-pong.\n\nSo how many times, is this now, I have pointed out DCC lack of any clue in anything to do with open space or pedestrian movement?\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nNo way garethace, the group 91 poddle bridge was absolute shite!\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nI’ve tried to point out this before about those new buildings beside millen bridge, they’re quayfront GRAIN, and they work well as grain, whereas the fake Georgians at the corner of Jervis Street dont work as grain cos theyre fake and the finish is bad. Nor do the fakes on Bachelors Walk (designed in-house by the council).\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nLOL! 🙂\n\nRespectfully, I am too long at this game to get worried with arguments as weak as that. I don’t have to even agree with an argument, to enjoy it – just as long as it interests me.\n\nWith all due respect, come back when you have something more to offer. My suggestion, would be to read my post carefully again, examine the situation in question, and carefully try and present an argument that would contradict what I have argued.\n\nThat would be interesting at least. The above response just isn’t, sorry. To tell you the truth, I find it difficult myself to get up off my behind, and look at things – but it is always worth it.\n\nA book you might be able to dig up in Boton Street Library or someplace is Edmund N. Bacon, Design of Cities – a good reference to build up a decent response around. I haven’t even read much of it myself, but the pictures in it are still worth a hour or two.\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\n(I know this breaks the rules of the forum, but) I’ve never read somebody so far up their own arse!\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nIn my general posting or just this post specifically.\n\nBecause if the problem, is with my posting in general, then I might agree with you. In fact, I might even do something about it.\n\nBut in the case of this post specifically, all I can offer is that, I don’t take any prisoners – but I have followed the Poddle Bridge and Aftermath saga since the mid nineties.\n\nSo I can assure you, you are not talking to someone who is up their own arse, or any place else in regards to this issue.\n\nBTW, I have mentioned now and again, that I like the boardwalks. At least they got the positioning of them correct, and that is why they perform such a crucial function now.\n\nYou are really just being immature – if the only argument you could come up with, was that attempt, respectfully.\n\npvdz\n\nParticipant\n\nBack to the kiosks, my god those kiosks on Grattan bridge are absolutely awful! They look like stationary Luas cars with the roundy edges knocked off that could easily have been bought in a portaloo catalogue. Also how do they relate to the already primitive seating that is in place, with their pseudo celtic ‘windbreakers?’ I thought those seats were a temporary arrangement and the new kiosks would be attached or connected in some masterstroke, but what the crap?\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nNobody who has slagged off those buildings beside Millen bridge has said exactly why they think they’re crap, or even what they think might look good there instead. They wern’t designed by DCC in-house, or an east-european architect. It was an Irish architect, George Morris.\n\nNo garethace, you do submit interesting posts. Telling somebody to reread your own posts and your tone in that post is what I was referring to.\n\nThe original alignment for the pedestrian bridge (Jervis Street/Meeting House Square) would indeed have created much greater connectivity (sorry about the pretentious word), but I’d prefer the Howley Harrington bridge design any day to the Group 91 bridge, which was an architectural conceit (does an “all hail group 91” thing exist on on this site???).\n\nMillenium bridge is also uncomfortably close to ha’penny bridge – the original bridge site would have been that bit further away.\n\nGiven that it’s there now, they should at least make the most of the Eustace St/Millenium Walk axis by putting a sign on the blank wall of the Jervis Centre that can be read from across the Liffey, so as to get more people to walk down it.\n\nAnother entrance to the Jervis Centre where Millen Walk comes out would be daft given that there’s one at the nearby corner. And Dixon’s would have to lose some floorspace – so unless that was agreed in their lease……\n\nStephenC, with reference to Capel Street, DCC would have us believe that the “bland and boring box” on the corner of Mary’s Abbey and “another planned for opposite” ARE the “judicious urban planning” that will make it a great thoroughfare again!!\n\nRory W\n\nParticipant\n\nI can put up with the river side, it’s not that offensive. However what about the other side of this development , on Abbey street. It is the 1960s concrete look , so ugly\n\nTwo different developers Quartier Bloom (sout of Great Strand Street) – Wallace, Chapel House et al (North of Great Strand Street) – Danninger (Zoe)\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nI don’t think this development is as bad as is made out either.\n\nOk, it’s standard stuff, using standard materials, but it isn’t cringe inducing to look at it.\n\nThere are of course bad elements to it, the red-bricked part attached to the tower is very cluttered and messy near the ground floor, and there’s more clutter on the other building where the ‘new meets the old’, with messy windows squeezed in at the top on the side.\n\nAnd the join with the new stone and the brickwork should not have been made on the quay facade.\n\nThe lack of windows in the old building is really awful, and clearly looks it in that pic from earlier, it looks derelict.\n\nI think what the problem with it is, and perhaps the problem you have with it Brian, is that it is a landmark site, clearly noticable, and deserves better than the mundane.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nAnd yes, the Millenium Bridge is too close to the Ha’penny, and the natural route mentioned should have been used. I often have to make the zig-zag too and is annoying and just silly.\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nThe original alignment for the pedestrian bridge (Jervis Street/Meeting House Square) would indeed have created much greater connectivity (sorry about the pretentious word), but I’d prefer the Howley Harrington bridge design any day to the Group 91 bridge, which was an architectural conceit (does an “all hail group 91” thing exist on on this site???).\n\nThat is very good, you have managed to construct a decent and clear piece of communicative writing there. You have separated the issues excellently:\n\n1) Aesthetic value of Group 91 bridge – I agree with you, I didn’t like it at all – it was crap, even if it did try to be ‘stylish’ etc, etc. The same guy did the lamps up in Smithfield too btw, and many think those are a bit over the top too.\n\n2) The placement of the Group 91 bridge though was far superior. No one will actually use that new burrowed tunnel after a while, and just opt to do the ZIG_ZAG maneuvre instead, which is a disgrace in my opinion, considering these public projects do cost as much as they do and are ‘once off’.\n\nIt is well worth noting, that Group 91 in their original planning submission to the council, made only one small mistake, which did become their undoing in this matter. They didn’t draw their site boundary over as far as the opposite bank of the Liffey to Temple Bar. Instead opting to just draw the boundary along the mid-course of the Liffey. Meaning, when they came to building the Poddle Bridge, they didn’t have any jurisdiction on the opposite bank of the river. That is how DCC eventually won – on a technicality.\n\nApparently, sources tell me that DCC were quite miffed about not being part of the whole Temple Bar thing, and went out of their way to enforce their dominance in this small matter. It was unfortunate that such a public project, with so much potential to improve north/south connectivity in the broader context of Dublin city, became engulfed in such political bashing – but such is life. DCC only know one trick you see – this tunnel burrowing idea, which was kind of novel in the 1980s but has since then gotten very tired indeed. But what do DCC do? They continue to pull this one trick they know, out of the drawer every time they need to actually think.\n\nI think we need to try harder to separate issues in that manner here at Archiseek – it is only a point about communication, but would lend increased weigh and value to contributors writing here. It is definitely harder to do and requires more work, in an effort to express oneself properly, but it is worth practicising – it gets easier with practice – being able to juggle the various strands of an argument about the built environment.\n\nArchiseek is thought of by many people out there involved in the built environment, as an aesthetic ping-pong match, a group of ‘style-police’ like the Georgian society or something at its lowest and most ridiculous. However, the opportunity does exist here at Archiseek to expand one’s own awareness of the many strands associated with problem solving in the area of the built environment – a lot of which I never even knew about until visiting the board here at Archiseek. I am sure I do not stand alone in that experience.\n\nasdasd\n\nParticipant\n\nBrian/Garethace,\n\nAs someone who generally just lurks on this board, I was interested to see you compliment Devin’s “communicative” writing skills.\n\nYou should learn from him. In fact learn from George Bernard Shaw who – at the end of a long letter to a friend – apologised for it, saying he didn’t have time for a short one.\n\nWhy not write your spiel offline, go away, re-read it and then re-write it again to make the same sense with half the verbiage.\n\nSure it take more time but it’s worth it – you will get more readers.\n\nangels\n\nParticipant\n\nAm I th only person who has seen the four boxes erected on Capel Street Bridge. If I am the only one here is a brief description: Four white boxes, imagine the box section of a refridgerated truck, placed equidistant along the bridge, they are about 20 feet long and 10 feet tall. I presume they are to become cafes, but they ruin the beautiful vistas up and down the river. I really think that they are horrible, am I on my own ?\n\nLOB\n\nParticipant\n\nThey are the long awaited bookstalls &\n\nvery disappointing too.\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nangels – photographs of the kiosks in this thread on page 3\n\nhttps://archiseek.com/content/showthread.php?s=&threadid=2150&perpage=15&pagenumber=3\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nThanks for the compliment whoever you are, asdasd.\n\nBut I do kind of agree with garethace about standards. Sometimes we just bang down something as a quick reaction to what somebody else said in a post, cos we’re in a rush out or something. But I guess it is worth taking the time to write something worth reading.\n\nYeah , ‘fridges’ is a good word to describe the look of those kiosks at the moment. I’m waiting for them to undergo some kind of transformation….\n\nAnd why have they been placed directly in front of the wood and glass benches, which were supposed to be for gazing at the view / sun setting in the river etc. ?\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nThe benches face the wrong way anyway – they face up the river across the road instead of down the river.\n\nblue\n\nParticipant\n\nThis area is now very crushed and cluttered compared to what it was beforehand. I think they have over done it on the number of kiosks, one or two maybe but four is over kill. Are there really enough booksellers in Dublin to take up the leases on them all?\n\nI say move the daft seats or even remove the their backs so you can sit and look down the Liffey.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nThe seats are plonked right in the middle of the pavement, dividing it into two narrow strips.\n\nIt’s funny here, for once no one’s going to saying a word about the kiosks until they’re open, but really, with an awning or whatever out, and a big black hole opened up in their fronts, they’re not going to look much better.\n\nAnd whatever about when they’re open, what about when they are closed, in the evenings, during early morning rush hour and probably for most of Sundays, they’ll look just like what they do now.\n\nPassing today, they really are ugly, esp when seen from the Millenium Bridge, four big containers straddled across Grattan Bridge, like the bad old days in front of the Custom House.\n\nAnd that beautiful raking angle view of the bridge from just alongside it, taking in the ironwork, the massive iron brackets, the lamp standards and the stone arches looks horrible now.\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nBut I do kind of agree with garethace about standards. Sometimes we just bang down something as a quick reaction to what somebody else said in a post, cos we’re in a rush out or something. But I guess it is worth taking the time to write something worth reading.\n\n]\n\nWell, if you want a really good example of where they made the right decision where to put something, take a walk over by Dawson Street sometime.\n\nWhen ABK did the new Arts Block there was no entrance from Trinity out onto Nassau Street. So ABK put one in.\n\nBut look where they put it though, not in front of Reads, not in front of the Setanta Centre or Kilkenny Design, not in front of Judge Roy Beans….. but right at the bottom of Dawson Street.\n\nI know that ‘trinangle’ pedestrian island and crossing there is awkward at best, and creates congestion – but from a point of view of coming and going to Trinity, it is in the right place.\n\nWhat they also did is interesting – they made a nice overflow space with a seat around a tree – that is just enough to take the chokepoint of pedestrians crossing, coming from Trinity, moving along Nassau St etc, and manage.\n\nYou can even ‘wait around there’ for your friend, to meet someone, etc, etc. You can have a smoke there or a drink of coke if you want.\n\nCompare that to the new bridge on the Liffey – where when you get to the oposite side of the road, there is nowhere to really stand and relax, you are shoved literally by the flow of the crowd down the Quays in either direction.\n\nThe really nice thing about the board walks is being able to linger around there without bothering anyone.\n\nAnonymous\n\nInactive\n\nI have always wondered why that footpath is so thin along the Trinity side of Naussau Street and South Leinster Street. It does not make sense when you think of the amount of people waiting to get various buses. I know that if it were to be widened it would mean less space for the buses and cars etc. However, cars are for some reason allowed to park outside the Kilkenny Design shop. Surely the path could be widened slightly?!\n\nI agree with you about the Arts block entrance Garethace. It is a nice little space, so much movement, but as you pointed out, also a chance to sit beside the tree and relax.\n\nThanks\n\nPhil\n\nblue\n\nParticipant\n\nI have always wondered why that footpath is so thin along the Trinity side of Naussau Street and South Leinster Street.

Dublin City Council just don’t have any eyes in their heads, otherwise all of this would be painfully obvious to them. It is a question of someone taking responsibility for it really – and clearly Dublin city council down through the years have not been able to do anything like that.\n\nTemple Bar Properties/Architects were the only ones in my experience who showed enough assertiveness to go and do anything. Most people do not realise how little land/influence Temple Bar Properties could exert on that area – but what they did do, they did well I think.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nThis place is just waiting for another bus disaster.\n\nAt 5 in the evening, the pavement there is choked solid with people waiting for buses, so the many people rushing to Pearse and other places have to walk along the road, often weaving in and out of buses that are parked, moving and about to move.\n\nIt’s a joke.\n\nAre we going to have to wait for another terrible Wellington Quay incident before something is done?\n\ngarethace\n\nParticipant\n\nI hadn’t actually thought of take Pearse Street station route, you are referring to, and yes, that is a really busy route at rush hour.\n\nUp on the north side, the route from O’Connell Street area as far as Connolly station etc, isn’t at all as tricky.\n\nI haven’t any experience of rushing down to the station on the Quay though.\n\nAnyone?\n\nNetEng\n\nParticipant\n\nThe Lisney marketing spiel for the kiosks:\n\nAddress: Dublin City Centre Kiosks\n\n(At Grattan Bridge)\n\nStatus: To Let\n\nRent Per Annum: Details on Application.\n\nSize (sq.m.): 12\n\nIntroduction: Tremendous opportunity to let superbly positioned street kiosks in the heart of Dublin city centre.\n\nBenefiting from an enormous volume of passing pedestrian and vehicular traffic\n\nSuitable for a variety of users (Subject to Planning)\n\nNo Food Users\n\nLocation: The Street Kiosks are located on Grattan Bridge between Capel Street to the north and Parliament Street to the south in the heart of Dublin city centre. The kiosks, which have excellent profile overlooking the River Liffey, also benefit from the enormous volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, which cross the bridge on a daily basis. Grattan Bridge is a one way vehicular thoroughfare providing one of the main arterial routes from the north to the south of Dublin city centre.\n\nDublin city centre attracts a vast number of visitors each year, both national and international. The kiosks are located in the very hub of all the activity between the north and south of the city and adjacent Temple Bar and Dublin Castle. These Kiosks offer traders a truly unique retailing opportunity in the heart of Dublin city centre.\n\nDescription: There are four stand alone street kiosks located on Grattan Bridge ready for immediate occupation. Each kiosk, which opens overlooking the River Liffey to the east, has under floor heating, electrical sockets, lighting and water and waste supply.

Anyone know why.\n\nAlso the Boardwalk extension works continue. How long did the original take to construct? Will this section be finsihed for summer. Then a good clean up of the whole stretch please!\n\nLike the new flags!\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nGrattan Bridge is to be painted too, given the test patches of undercoat everywhere.\n\nkefu\n\nParticipant\n\nPrevious Boardwalk took a lot longer than that, I’m afraid. Would be highly unlikely to be finished for the Summer unless they’ve learnt an awful lot of tricks since the last time.\n\nSpeaking of bridges, the Luas bridge at Heuston is open to pedestrians again for the first time in what must be several years.\n\nblue\n\nParticipant\n\nOn bridges, does anyone know what stage Calatrava’s second liffey crossing is at?\n\nI’m really looking forward to it, I think it will be a great addition and really help traffic flow.\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nThe AAI has a site visit to the boardwalk extension in May so obviously they think it will be quite advanced by that stage….\n\nblue\n\nParticipant\n\nAny one passed the Kiosks recently?\n\nThey have added horrendous tower lights, ala the smashed ones in Temple Bar, about 2-2.5 storeys high to each corner of each of the kiosks.\n\nThis area has gone from a refreshing open space to a very cluttered and cramped space. I was really looking forward to the Kiosks and will hold final judgement till they are finally up and running but its not looking good.\n\nI’ll try and get a pic at some stage.\n\nAndrew Duffy\n\nParticipant\n\nThe second Calatrava bridge will be up at Macken Street; I can’t remember who won the commission for the pedestrian bridge being built at the moment.\n\nEdit: Damnit – I remembered the designer of the other pedestrian bridge, at Custom House Quay (Brian Oâ€™Halloran & Associates), but not the one at Eden Quay.

Can you explain? Thanks Phil\n\nPhil,\n\nI have heard the kiosks on Grattan Bridge refered to as the fridges by many people in conversation.\n\nWhat should be done is slightly more complicated. They were sneaked in by inclusion in a street furniture consultation document. But I would contend that any rateable property cannot be descibed as ‘street furniture’ once rates can be levied. What would be next an annual bill on memorial benches?\n\nThe city architects have fouled up one of Dublins finest bridges making it a danger to road safety and destroying its character.\n\nThey need moving\n\nchewy\n\nParticipant\n\nso says the architect in f mcd article a few pages back…\n\nhmm nice metaphor but anyone seen any other pictures of the things open ?\n\nthe one on lisney ain’t too clear… or promising\n\ncouldnt find Mr Dave Richards, of Gilroy McMahon architects website then have gilroymcmahon.ie\n\nbut it doesn’t exist\n\nand of course these things will be closed down atleast half the time so it be if he considered that\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nYes the 16 new poles are unbelievable!!

Should have gone for something that would have fitted in with the bridge’s architecture. More metal (perhaps copper – which would look great when it weathered).\n\nThe design of these looks like a filled in bus shelter and the flagpoles only add to the clutter\n\nin a word – crap\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\nConsidering they were designed as book stalls they would make excellent programme vending kiosks for a stadium. Either Croke Park or the redeveloped Landsdowne Rd would be perfect, the poles could be used for hanging County/Country banners,\n\nBeyond that I think Rory’s Dunsink might be a close second.\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nGood idea Diaspora…. they’d look pretty good as that….\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nPassing by last night and the 16 poles on the Grattan Bridge container kiosks were being removed! Are the kiosks next??\n\nAnd while they’re at it they could remove those two grimy old flagpoles – one at the Wellington Quay corner and one at the Upr Ormond Quay corner – they serve no purpose.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nThat’s very interesting, are the CC putting their hands up on this? Going by the other day one of the worst views is from the corner of the bridge where it joins the north Boardwalk, all the poles accumulate in the view – depth of field and all that – and the clutter is truly extraordinary, and right infront of Sunlight Chambers.\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\nIts a pity they won’t be in Croker in time for the Ulster final, but they have until September for the main events\n\nhttp://www.lisney.com/subnav.aspx?tabid=3&tabindex=2&inc=commProperty&ID=944\n\nThe to let boards are down, but they are still being offered via the web,\n\nI am getting confused they are prepared to licence them out but aren’t advertising them openly.\n\nThey really ought to go :confused:\n\nblue\n\nParticipant\n\nPast there this morning and I had to do a double take I thought my eyes were deceiving me.\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nWell after months (or has it been years) of activity the Bookstalls on Grattan Bridge are finally complete. I have to say that never was there such a poorly concieved and executed project. Ironically they are presently being used to trumpet some of the CCs latest prestige project such as the Spire and the revamp of City Hall. No sign of themn being used for their actual purpose which is bookstalls. On the whole I think the stalls are better for having had the light pylons removed. The finished paving around the base leaves a lot to be desired though. We shouldn’t complain though as it will probably be dug up again soon enough due to the fact that the stalls will not be comercially viable. Personally, I think investing in a good all year round Dublin Market would have been a better option.\n\nElsewhere the Boardwalk extension (another expensive project – â‚¬3m according to the Indo this morning! â‚¬3m!) will be complete next months. At present the base has been erected and the Liffey wall breached in three places. Anyone have any idea what happens to all those granite blocks once they are removed. They must be worth a fortune.\n\nLastly along the Liffey is the new bridge down opposite ‘chq’ in the Docklands.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nWere those granite blocks that were nicked some time ago ever found? The wall at Eden Quay is extraordinary, the blocks are so thick, much moreso than other quay walls in the city.\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\nOriginally posted by Diaspora\n\nhttp://www.lisney.com/subnav.aspx?tabid=3&tabindex=2&inc=commProperty&ID=944\n\nThe to let boards are down, but they are still being offered via the web,\n\nI am getting confused they are prepared to licence them out but aren’t advertising them openly.\n\nWhy can’t the City Architect just concede that he made a mistake and rectify it by removing them.\n\nBarrets strike rate before this has been impressive, there is an architects touch in many of the good things Dublin has seen up to now such as,\n\nO’Connell St (the implementation delays not his fault)\n\nHenry St is a revelation who would have believed a decade ago that it would have a higher footfall than Grafton St?\n\nLiffey House is one of the best contemporary buildings in Dublin and no doubt he had his influence there too.\n\nThe boardwalk which gives a great recreational asset to the City.\n\nBut the Kiosks just never translated from the drawing board to reality. They are bulky and the bridge simply doesn’t have the scale to accomodate them.\n\nThey are also entirely out of Character with the bridge and surrounding architecture such as the Clarence Hotel and Sunlight chambers.\n\nThey also required planning permission as rateable structures, which they don’t have.\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nDid anyone read the article on the new range of kiosks being constructed in the city in the Sunday Tribune Property section the weeke before last. Very interesting. Apparently there has been considerable interest in these structures and that three are close to being let. The DCC have also stipulated that no food retailers will be considered as this would compete with the two Boardwalk units currently occupied by coffee sellers. The range of retailers interested was quite impressive: booksellers, galleries, clothes, florists.\n\nThe article also considered the three new kiosks at various Luas stations. These are being considered for a new breed of convenience store. Call me a cynic but three new Spars beckon!\n\nAs the Centra slogan on QFm says ”We’ve got Dublin covered”. No arguement there.\n\nI presonally am wondering why the CC didnt adopt a standardised design for all these units. The new kiosks planned for O’Connell St will be different again. A quick glance around Paris would show a uniform design to kiosks which have become identified with the city. Its a pity the same could not have been done here, particularly when the koisks are all placed so close to each other.\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nThe first ‘bookstall’ opens for business today on Grattan Bridge. Its a florist…booksellers didnt seem to interested in the stalls. I wish them the best of luck but I have a feeling it will be a difficult spot to make a success of. The bookstalls look very sleek and modern when opened although a more colourful awning should have been used. They look a little bland and lifeless. Perhaps an opinion poll would be in order….\n\nAnonymous\n\nInactive\n\nI’ll have to take a walk down for a look…yeah they’re very bland alright…esp for the Irish climate…grey is never very sucessful…I’ve always felt that the pavement drainage channel is positioned exactly where you’d want to stand if buying something…and they’re those very deep ones…I can see a lawsuit on its way! 😉\n\nburge_eye\n\nParticipant\n\nOriginally posted by StephenC\n\nThe first ‘bookstall’ opens for business today on Grattan Bridge.

Apologies for resolution:\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nAnd a wider view of the bridge:\n\nLorcan\n\nParticipant\n\nto be honest i think they’re allrite. when are the o’connell street box things being put in?\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nI expect the planning of the O’Connell Street ones to be better so as they don’t end up with a drainage channel running across their pay points & their awnings tied to benches which were supposed to be for public seating.\n\nRory W\n\nParticipant\n\nAccording to today’s (27/10) Times Commercial Property “Work on the new Macken Street bridge, which will link the south and north quays, is to begin early in the new year”. Anyone know if this is happening?\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nA second kiosk has opened for business housing a small art dealer. The actual effect of another stall opening is quite good. I understand a newsagent is next. Also interminable delays on the Boardwalk extension! Anyone know whats holding it all up? Do you think we’ll see repaving of O’Connell Bridge as the next project along here.\n\nAndrew Duffy\n\nParticipant\n\nAs far as I know, a pedestrian bridge is to be installed there – you can see the gap in the boardwalk where it is going.\n\nIt’s mentioned here: http://www.dublincity.ie/planning/Draft_ContibutionScheme03.pdf\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nAny photos of the new stretch of boardwalk?\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nHere’s some pics of it. Not posting out of admiration though – I’m not exactly the world’s greatest fan of the Boardwalk. I think AT’s initial assessment of it as gimmicky and utilitarian perfectly sums it up.\n\nWhereas it is undoubtedly very pleasant to walk along, and the wood finishes particularly attractive to users at close quarters, on the whole the structure feels temporary and certainly looks it – and the Ormond Quay section with the various slopes and slants looks positively ugly tacked into the quay wall. The grills used for balustrade are equally so.\n\nI appreciate it’s very easy to criticise the project without coming up with alternatives or solutions, but I think it nothing short of ridiculous that pedestrians are forced out into a cantilevered ledge over the river in order to allow traffic take precedence along the quays.\n\nSurely the quay environment could have been improved rather than invading in such a manner on the riverscape, or at least we could have waited for the Port Tunnel to open and observe the traffic results.\n\nEden Quay is especially wide to cater for improvements. And if the pedestrian situation is such that the Boardwalk is practiacally needed , how come there isn’t one on the southern quays?\n\nPerhaps to put things in context, in 15-20 years time when the Boardwalk will probably require reconditioning, will it be refurbished or simply removed?\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nAnd from O’Connell Bridge:\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nA view from Butt Bridge:\n\nLorcan\n\nParticipant\n\nLiffey river taxi gearing up for launch\n\nLorna Siggins, Marine Correspondent\n\nA river taxi may be running on the Liffey next summer if a plan submitted by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) is approved by Dublin City Council.\n\nThe DDDA is seeking permission to build a landing stage at Bachelor’s Walk. The stage would consist of a 20-metre-long floating pontoon with a sliding gate entrance, access platform and gangway for passengers off the boardwalk.\n\nA 54-seater vessel is being built in Sweden for delivery next spring. The authority hopes to run trials on the river for several months. It anticipates that the transport service could be up and floating by June, focusing initially on the tourist market.\n\nThe initiative is part of the DDDA’s River Liffey regeneration strategy, which also allows for the introduction of a fast commuter ferry service between the docklands and the coast – initially DÃºn Laoghaire.\n\nThe strategy proposed a cross-river ferry between City Quay and the Irish Financial Services Centre (IFSC) II among a series of projects to revive practical use of the waterway.\n\nIt is understood that the DDDA has held discussions with several operators in relation to contracting out operation of the services, and may advertise formally for bidders. Navigation of the river’s 15 bridges, specifically the upper reaches between the Ha’penny Bridge and Heuston Station, is restricted by tides and the low headroom on fixed structures.\n\nThe new Millennium Bridge and the Matt Talbot Bridge are particularly problematic at high tide, and the riverbed rises west of the Ha’penny Bridge, which causes a difficulty at low water. The service could eventually run to Heuston Station. Water bus stops may also be located at Tara Street to link with the DART, at the IFSC I and II, Forbes Street, Britain Quay, the Point Theatre and the Alexandra Basin ferry terminal.\n\nÂ© The Irish Times\n\nGood idea?\n\nAndrew Duffy\n\nParticipant\n\nAll entrances to the existing boardwalk were closed last night, with some stonework removed from the quay walls lying by the Millennium Bridge, Any idea if there’s anything other than widening the entrances going on?\n\nkefu\n\nParticipant\n\nThere’s no Boardwalk on the southern quays because the sun is more likely to fall on the other side.\n\nI felt at the beginning that it was a gimmicky project but I think it has been the greatest recent success of the City Council, apart from the regeneration of O’Connell Street.\n\nNo amount of traffic restriction on the quays would have ever led to a situation where you could have hundreds of people sitting out: reading, drinking coffee as is the case with the Boardwalk on any relatively warm day.\n\nEven when the Port Tunnel is open, I don’t think walking along the outer path of the quays would ever be particularly pleasant because of its narrowness. There were still be plenty of buses and cars whizzing by at 35 miles an hour.\n\nvinnyfitz\n\nParticipant\n\n@Andrew Duffy wrote:\n\nAll entrances to the existing boardwalk were closed last night, with some stonework removed from the quay walls lying by the Millennium Bridge, Any idea if there’s anything other than widening the entrances going on?\n\nI noticed that at the weekend. I was wondering was it the installation of some flood protection barriers superior to the sandbags that have been around for a while now…\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nThats it. The new section had them installed (saw them erected one night) and I guess a more formal arrangement is needed now we can expect flooding every year.\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nWhy the long delay with finishing the extension…. anyone know?\n\nAndrew Duffy\n\nParticipant\n\nI’m pretty sure there’s a pedestrian bridge being built that will go between the quays, rougly in the middle of the new boardwalk extension.\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\nI seen that three of the kiosks are now open for trading, I really don’t think they look any better open than they did closed and they look a bit light on customers as well, unless the plan was that they would only be busy during the summer.\n\nkefu\n\nParticipant\n\nI’m told by Dublin City Council that there was a delay in having the wooden boards delivered because of a shipping strike (???) in December. There’s no issue apart from that and they’re due pretty shortly. Council seem confident it would only be a month or two after that before the extension will be open. Also the work that took place before Xmas re flooding was the construction of so-called Dutch dams (that’s what it sounded like). Somebody else can probably enlighten us on what exactly they do.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nThere’s a huge ‘dam’ just gone down on Eden Quay recently, wider than any of the openings in the walls on the older Boardwalk.\n\nHere’s the lovely nerw wood going down – the craftmanship in laying the timbers is superb – from the cutting to the joining to the bolting down, very impressive.\n\nUnfortunately it looks like there’s going to be a rather nasty problem with this new stretch of Boardwalk – over the past few days most of the brand new, unfinished handrail has been covered, and I mean covered in seagull droppings 😮\n\nNever seen anything like it – whether it was just a one off or not I don’t know (not exactly an expert on the bowel movements of sea birds) but if this this is going to be the state of affairs along here on a permanent basis I’d gladly stick to Eden Quay, warts and all (yes it’s that bad :))\n\nI pity the the person who has to sand it down for finishing…\n\nRusty Cogs\n\nParticipant\n\nDoes anyone know if anything is happening with that 2nd Caltrava (spl?) bridge east of Talbot st. bridge. Last I heard (Dec ’03) no one was willing to stump up the dough ?\n\nGraham,\n\nI was in the southern capital yesterday and remarked the same thing crossing the new pedestrian bridge there – A CARPET of droppings. Must be the season for it!\n\nkefu\n\nParticipant\n\nA new bridge for Merchant’s Quay in Dublin: – what do you think this is about?\n\nThe picture accompanying would seem to me a subway station in Washington DC.\n\nLooks like a mistake to me\n\nhttp://www.dublincity.ie/press_news/news/new_pedestrian_bridge_over_liffey.asp\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nvery sensitive location – facing the four courts\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nWhy? Whatever for. Whats wrong with the exisiting bridges!\n\nAnonymous\n\nInactive\n\nStrange image alright. Do those architects have a web-page? Aswell, as StephenC just said, what is the point in this?\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nYes – any decent pics anywhere?\n\nThis is a highly highly sensitive location – it is Dublin, the image of the city presented to the rest of the world, whatever about our own enjoyment of the location. It is more Dublin than Merrion Square or the Custom House or the Spike will ever be.\n\nThat classic river view with O’Donovan Rossa & Fr Matthew bridges and matching balustrading along the quays ought not be touched with a bargepole.\n\nWhereas it is generally accepted now that striking modern architecture works well next to older structures or locations, this should not be an excuse to build anywhere, supposedly because we’re so ‘enlightened’ now.\n\nLeave the location alone. I know it’s a typical reactionary response but really, what is wrong with the existing bridges? It seems to be something of a CC hobby now to litter the riverscape with ‘striking’ new structures…\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nThat must be a mistake. You wouldnâ€™t want to go putting a bridge there â€“ enough damage has been done over the past 25 years with putting bridges in the wrong place on the Liffey. Leaving aside the folly of the Loop Line Bridge (which I suppose was just a reflection of the power of the railway companies at the time), the consistent spacing of bridges along the Liffey had always been observedâ€¦for hundreds of yearsâ€¦until Frank Sherwin Bridge was stuck in a few feet away from Sean Heuston Bridge in 1982.\n\nThen the Millenium pedestrian bridge which of course â€˜enhances criss-cross movement across the Liffey blah blahâ€™ but also compromises the spacing of bridges again.\n\nThen James Joyce Bridge – Yes, coup for the city get a Calatrava bridge etc. etc., but this one is definitely in the wrong place; Because it was squeezed in between two older bridges, it messes up the quay length/river width ratio again. Itâ€™s also very close to the oldest and most beautiful bridge on the Liffey, Mellowes (aka Queen Maev) Bridge.\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nI wonder if its a misprint and the CC mean a new bridge at Eden Quay across to Hawkins St. This has definately been mooted before and is part of the IAP for OConnell St. I have never heard a bridge at Merchants Quay mentioned before. And I stand by my comments….what will it connect? Four Courts with SFX? Very odd.\n\nElsewhere….the new extension to the Boardwalk opens on March 17. I say this every year but can DCC hire a steamcleaner for the rest of the Boardwalk and the bridges and give them a bit of a spruce up for our National Holiday. All those tourist should not have to see a years worth of grime as they promenade. Also (from today’s Irish Times) is news that the Liffey bat service should be in place by April. The new pedestrian bridge at chq arrives in March and opens in May while chq itself is still shrouded in letting uncertainty. Pity really…Im dying to get in and have a look. The DDDA are also to announce an upgrade to Custom House Quay to complete the new Liffey walkway and are apparently vacating their awful building and demolishing it later this year.\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\nThere is so little detail on that page that it must be a mistake, there is no way that the corpo would commission a bridge and not announce an image heavy press campaign to sell it. Then again they did the fridges in sneakiest possible way.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\n‘The Fridges’ – so the title’s official then 😀\n\nO’Connor Crowe Architects don’t appear to have a site which is strange…are they imaginary too? 🙂\n\nOn the issue of the older western bridges, their paving is often in appalling condition, esp at the corners with the quays. Certainly this needs to be improved for pedestrians – bit cheaper than any bridge too.\n\nThe chq bridge is exciting – it’s great the way bridges take so little time to go up after planning; this one is taking shape quite fast.\n\nIs there a need for that ped bridge at Hawkins/Marlborough Sts, esp so close to O’Cll Bridge? More clutter, not least when combined with the new Boardwalk. Even if Marl St is improved as per the IAP, there’s still not going to be the attractions to make people go there. Perhaps in light of the Hawkins redevelopment though…\n\nGood news about the DDDA huts.\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nOr “Portaloos” according to the Irish Times’ ‘What’s Not Hot’ section on Saturday.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nheheh\n\nNah, fridges is still the more accurate term, even if less humerous 🙂\n\nHere’s hoping their offspring won’t crop up on O’Connell Bridge as part of plans for there; their breeding like rabbits along the boardwalks is quite enough thank you very much, albethey the more fashion-conscious wood-clad generation 🙂\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\n@Graham Hickey wrote:\n\nheheh\n\nthey’re breeding like rabbits along the boardwalks is quite enough thank you very much, albethey the more fashion-conscious wood-clad generation 🙂\n\nThe boardwalk can take these type of structures quite well as at least half the height is mitigated by the Quay walls and the kiosks are framed against terraces of buildings behind the Quay thoroughfares. The fridges in contrast stand out for the egotistical flight of fancy that they are. The market has spoken http://www.lisney.com\n\nI hope for the individual traders (2/4) sake that they hold them on no more than short term licences and I would be examining my break options very closely. 🙁\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nWonder if the open ones are doing any decent trade – I passed them today and the man in the newsagent one looked bored senseless; then again staff tend to in most stores so maybe that’s not the best indicator…\n\nAgreed about the boardwalk kiosks, they do work well – just being flippant earlier – however the wood cladding is in an very poor state on both of them and requires immediate attention – they look so tatty.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nHave to laugh at the contractors working on the Boardwalk – they’ve just covered the most recently erected handrail in sheets of plastic and parcel tape to protect it from The Attack of airborne detritus 🙂\n\nnotjim\n\nParticipant\n\nthe eden quay boardwalk is open now, walked on it today.\n\nnotjim\n\nParticipant\n\nso according to the ddda newsletter the new foot bridge, the _sean o’casey_ bridge, is arriving this week and will be open by may.\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nLooking forward to that. The Boardwalk extension was finished to a good standard…even managed to stick to the contemporary theme with rubbish bins. Nice shiny stainless steel bin attached to the quay wall. A better solution that the cast iron ones on the original. Its a pity the phone boxes at the junction with OC Bridge are still there. Next step can I suggest they are removed and the outer paving relaid. Maybe even some new bus shelters.\n\nSue\n\nParticipant\n\nAll telephone kiosks should now be removed around Ireland. No one needs them any more. We use our mobiles. They are just targets for vandals, and invariably unsightly heaps of broken glass and rubbish.\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nThey obviously still make money – if they didn’t, do you not think that Eircom would have them pulled out?\n\nSue\n\nParticipant\n\nyeah, fair point. maybe councils should decide that these things aren’t worth it anymore, though. there was a case in the past that the public needed to make emergency calls to the cops or whatever; that need doesn’t exist. the only people that use them now are crims who don’t want to leave traces\n\nall public jacks should be pulled down while they’re at it. dublin is disfigured with them e.g. the one in the centre of terenure village, the one at mount jerome cemetry… is that one still there opposite Trinity?\n\nRusty Cogs\n\nParticipant\n\n@notjim wrote:\n\nso according to the ddda newsletter the new foot bridge, the _sean o’casey_ bridge, is arriving this week and will be open by may.\n\nWell the month of March has come and gone and still no sign of the new footbridge.

Very dark grey. No photos from me I’m afraid as it was way to wet to remember to bring a camera this morning!

Westland Row from its junction with Pearse Street to the south of Railway Viaduct, on Sunday 3rd April 2005 between the hours of 6.00am and 2.00pm. Northbound traffic will be diverted via Merrion Square West, Merrion Street, Hume Street, St. Stephen’s Green, Cuffe Street, Kevin Street, Bride Street , Bride Road, Nicholas Street and Winetavern Street to the North Quays. Southbound traffic will be diverted via Pearse Street and the city centre. Local vehicular access and full pedestrian access will be maintained at all times. The Closure is to facilitate works on a pedestrian footbridge over Westland Row.\n\nAnonymous\n\nInactive\n\nKefu. With the construction of Trinity’s new building, I have a suspicion that the pedestrian bridge (between Goldsmith Hall and the campus) might temporarily be removed. I am speculating of course, but I don’t see how it will remain whilst the new building is being built.\n\nadhoc\n\nParticipant\n\nThat bridge is staying in situ. They are knocking the stairway/lift access tower on the corner of Pearse Street and Westland Row. The bridge is now supported by a temporary structure closer to Pearse Street roadway. The bridge will be integrated into the new building in time.\n\nAnonymous\n\nInactive\n\nCheers Adhoc.\n\nWhat do you reckon they are closing the road for?\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nThe transference of the load onto the temporary structure?\n\nThe new Boardwalk is interesting – the newness is all very strange, don’t remember the older ones being like that at all 🙂\n\nThe new wood of the seating is magnificent – and the amount of seating the whole way down is a distinct improvement from the previous scheme. The shiny bins look well too. What doesn’t however is the crude piece of railing put in almost against the quay wall to guard the hole around the flight of steps down to the water. Whatever about the handrail negating some of the utilitarian appearance of the railings along the river – bare and in against the granite walls it looks totally inappropriate.\n\nWhat is of note is the new perspective this Boardwalk affords you of Burgh Quay, and the D’Olier St/ Westmoreland St apex at O’Cll Bridge – things you either saw in passing as you walked along Eden Quay, or never saw at all because of the bus stops and all the weird glum people staring at you 🙂\n\nBeing able to sit down and look has its benefits, but also its downside – that is the sight of all the crap shovelled in around that area over the past 40 years.\n\nThe Hawkins regeneration, whatever form that may take, will be a welcome boost.\n\nRory W\n\nParticipant\n\nI also had a walk down the new stretch of boardwalk last Friday – was amazed by the fact the new stretch already reeked of piss – it was quite revolting\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nThat’s just the river Rory…\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nSome pics of the new Boardwalk, including the lovely new seating & bins – captured while still clean & unweathered.\n\nAlso the quay wall which hasn’t been cleaned – it’s got a sooty finish to it that looks well against the new timber.\n\nThis Boardwalk has a more solid feel than the others – doesn’t seem to shudder as much :). Also the overhanging trees create a pleasant backdrop:\n\nRusty Cogs\n\nParticipant\n\nWell I’m getting seriously demoralised with the use of the new boardwalk on Eden Quay. I walked along it yestarday and I’d say about half of the people sitting there were ‘daytime drinkers’. It was particularly depressing to see one group throwing their ’empties’ into the Liffey once done. Was this it’s intended use ? I actually feel on guard using it now.\n\n-Donnacha-\n\nParticipant\n\nI must agree. It is a disgrace. This section of the boardwalk is now dominated by druggies and drunks. It is seriously intimidating. Gardai at nearby Store St and Pearse St seem to keep well clear of it.\n\nDrug clinics at Amiens St and Pearse St attract a huge number of undesirables into this area. The opening of the drug clinic on Amiens st (next to the Dart station) a few years ago resulted in the permanent closure of the that Dart station. Access to Dart platforms is now only through Connolly mainline. Apparently it was closed because of druggies wheeling and dealing, shooting up, and generally intimidating people in the pedestrian access tunnels.\n\nAnyway it now appears the boardwalk is their favoured venue for such activities.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nAh – often wondered why that DART section of Connolly was closed…\n\nUnfortunately I’d have to agree about the new Boardwalk too – they’ve all just moved down from Custom House Quay and Butt Bridge, given a permanent home as it were.\n\nThey’re all harmless enough, aside from the ‘odd’ bout of fighting, shouting and generally being agressive, but certainly they generate an intimidating environment when the Boardwalk is empty, which frankly is most of the time. The rubbish left behind is the worst aspect of their congregating – not to mention them making the area very hostile for families, or even sitting down for your lunch.\n\nConsidering they always congregate in groups around this area, I don’t know what policing can do other than just move them on to somewhere else…\n\nRusty Cogs\n\nParticipant\n\nWell to be honest, I think our usual set of indigenous daytime drinkers has been bolstered by some of our more ‘al fresco’ drinkers from far off lands. I was over in Moscow a couple of years back and surprised to see how many people drink in the streets. There were many kiosks around the city where you could buy alcohol and happily drink your way around the city. It appears that some of this attitude has made it over here and I observed a number of different groups who were essentially spending the afternoon getting pissed and using the Liffey as a bin as they went. Surely Gardai could encompass the boardwalks on their patrols to attempt to curb this (illegal) activity ?\n\nAndrew Duffy\n\nParticipant\n\nWhat are Dublin City Council’s bye laws on drinking outside? It’s prohibited in public parks, and the Port Company and Dublin Bus both have bye laws prohibiting it, but I don’t think the boardwalk is a park or part of the port. Is there a bye-law preventing drinking near the liffey quays left over from when they were working docks?\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\nIts a Garda matter, should that not be enough?\n\n-Donnacha-\n\nParticipant\n\nBesides the public drinking I don’t think the Gardai are short of reasons to get involved: Possession of drugs, openly taking of drugs in public place, intoxication/drunkeness, intimidation of passers-by, litter offences/dumping of rubbish in to river etc etc In fact last week on the boardwalk I saw girl strapping the arm of a male friend and injecting directly in front of an onlooking toddler!!\n\nDisgrace.\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\nDublin City Council have hit a new low in terms of sneaky tactics.\n\nThe notice seeking observations on the part extinguishement of the right of way at Grattan Bridge has been erected and dated as of 19th of June 2005 ie a sunday.

Perhaps you should forward them to Dick Gleeson since ‘connectivity’ is one of his big themes. I wonder what happened to the cast iron bollards shown on the prerenovated bridge. This photo also gives a good idea of how much improved the City Hall is after its cleanup. And what on earth was Grattan Buildings thinking of with that red paint job! Ugggh!\n\nTP did you in the end inspect the file extinguishing the right of way? Im sure the original scheme was displayed by the CC which would have included the kiosks. The original scheme also included a viewing platform of some sort on the west side of the bridge…not sure what you would view.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nThose pictures are fantastic Devin – allbeit for the wrong reasons!\n\nThe present day situation is unbelieveable!\n\nWhat’s a bit evident there and has annoyed me since the kiosks went in is the dead space between them – completely useless, and a shameful waste of valuable pedestrian walkway.\n\nAlso the foot wide length of pavement to the rear of them next to the road is just wide enough to tempt the odd pedestrian to put themselves in harm’s way.\n\nEven if the kiosks weren’t there, does a drainage channel really have to go right in the middle of the pavement?\n\nThis is a practice that really irritates me, and is the one criticism I’d also have of the O’Connell St paving which has recieved similar treatment.\n\nYou splash into it in winter, and trip over it in summer, and it looks unpleasant too.\n\nIn this case surely it would have been simple to slope the paving either to the river side or down to the roadway where a decent storm drain could be installed?\n\nMorlan\n\nParticipant\n\nI overheard some British tourists nattering away to each other and one of them says ‘What a fn eyes sore those mate!” pointing at the Kiosks on the bridge 🙁\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\n@StephenC wrote:\n\nI wonder what happened to the cast iron bollards shown on the prerenovated bridge.\n\nI was hoping the little cast iron bollards with â€˜corinthianâ€™ tops would be incorporated in the scheme (I wonder where they are now?).\n\nAlso, the historic granite kerbstones that you can see in the 1999 & 2000 photos above were to be reused in the scheme, according to the Part X planning application, but this didnâ€™t happen in the end. If you asked I suppose they would tell you it â€œproved unfeasibleâ€ or something :rolleyes: .\n\nLeaving aside the fact that the kiosks destroy the space, are ugly and should be removed (and are quite possibly also a commercial failure, as only one or two of them ever seem to be open), the lack of coordination between the the kiosks and the seating is stunning. Like, what on earth were the CC thinking??! It is as if two different schemes for the bridge were carried out without one knowing about the other!\n\nIf you stand there for a few minutes, all you see is people cringing as they try to get past each other. And nobody uses the seats (why would they?):\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nThe sad thing is that the seats were used before the kiosks landed…\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\n…whereas now they have no view, are sited in the shade, and have pedestrians mushing past on busy afternoons.\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nThese kiosks are now turning into a disaster. Walked by them on Saturday afternoon. From north to south –\n\nKiosk 1: A newsagent – the very type of retailer that the project was to avoid. The canopy of this kiosk has broken and has been clumsily repaired with sticky tape. Like all the other kiosks it needs to be tied down to the bench opposite.\n\nKiosk 2: A florist – closed. If it cant open on the last bank holiday weekend of summer then when.\n\nKiosk 3: A gallery – closed. Moving to new premises according to the handwritten sign.\n\nKiosk 4: Unlet – closed. Luckily this kiosk has fopund a new role in advertising canopies. A nice new red one with the manufacturers detals has been attached. Still at least it offers some colour to these otherwise drab and ugly mistakes.\n\nAlek Smart\n\nParticipant\n\nA mute testimony to a City Council made up largely of well meaning elected officials who are dictated to and overruled by a coterie of phillistinic self important professionals.\n\nRemember this is mere metres from the historic seat of Civic Governance in Dublin and of course within stone throwing distance of that other great City Council Monument to the Primacy of the Professionals…Civic Offices a structure of such monumental inappropriateness that No Name could be found for it !\n\nWhat is Civic Offices today……A Fitting Headquarters for a highly regarded and astute City Council..OR a means of covering up a very respectable and valuable centre city underground car park and creche for the members of the Duma..?\n\nIt really is difficult to find ANYthing positive to say about this gang of incompetents……!\n\nDevin talks about two different schemes being superimposed on the Bridge independent of each other…Too bloody right…..remember each floor of Civic Offices represents a different planet within the entire shaky edifice\n\nBill McH\n\nParticipant\n\n(I’m not sure if this has been mentioned on the O’Connell Street thread and I’m too lazy to wade through all the posts since March this year to find out! Haven’t seen it mentioned on this one though).\n\nI think it is a pity that it is so difficult to travel between the Bachelor’s Walk stretch of the boardwalk and the Eden Quay section. Going West to East, there are pedestrian lights which can allow you to walk from the Bachelor’s Walk section across to the island in the middle of O’Connell Bridge, but to get to the Eden Quay bit (without jaywalking) you need to walk towards D’Olier Street and cross at the lights at the other end of the bridge, before returning to Eden Quay. Or you could cross Bachelor’s Walk, cross O’Connell Street at the O’Connell Monument and then cross back over Eden Quay to the boardwalk.\n\nI know there’s lots of traffic along the quays and on the bridge itself, so it might be difficult to arrange pedestrian lights the whole way across the bridge at the O’Connell Street end of the bridge. Maybe when the port tunnel opens…\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nYes a good point – O’Connell Bridge has always been a nightmare for pedestrians in this respect.\n\nIt has improved a bit recently with the tweaking of sequencing, but there’s not much to be improved with this method if lights don’t exist in the first place, as you mention Bill on the Eden Quay side of the bridge!\n\nCould be very tricky though to accommodate so many streams of traffic, pedestrian and vechicular with such an array of lights…\n\nComing from the Westmoreland St island lights down the bridge median to the lights at O’Cll Mon has improved recently, providing you run down the length of the bridge that is…\n\nDevin\n\nParticipant\n\nGRATTAN BRIDGE KIOSK IN PVC SHOCK\n\nYes, it’s true. A PVC sliding door has just been fitted to one of the kiosks (a blinds shop). Sorry to be negative but nothing is going right about these kiosks, is it? On the positive side, at least we were spared Georgian glazing strips.\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nAnd did the City Council really envisage one of the kisoks, i.e. that above, selling blinds?!\n\nA kiosk selling blinds in the middle of the Liffey on a windswept bridge?!\n\nTalk about the blind leading the blind 🙂\n\nYou can just see the Pythonesque scene of the seller saying, “oh hang on a second there, I’ll just have a check out the back”…..\n\n(out of nothing but childish curiousity, where to the traders go to the toilet?)\n\nPaul Clerkin\n\nKeymaster\n\nA blind shop? really?\n\nGrahamH\n\nParticipant\n\nAll kinds – frilly ones, Venetian ones, Roman ones, naff kitchen ones with the brass bar through the base 🙂 – you name it they’ve got it.\n\nJust the miniature samples are something of a drawback :rolleyes:\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nThese kiosks really are turning into a bad joke. The above has patio door and a replcement awning advertising its wares, the two centre ones (a gallery and flower shop) are rarely open and covered in tacky stickers and the last one – little more than a confectionary and newspaper stand – has a broken awning that no seems interested in repairing. I think they are all crap. Useless, ugly intrusion on the bridge. I think they should be removed and perhaps converted into ticket stalls for Ticketmaster or transport and located strategically around the city. A competely failed project. Lets hope that the kiosks planned for OConnell Street have benefitted from a little more planning.\n\nurbanisto\n\nParticipant\n\nAnyone been through ‘Quartier Bloom’ recently. Lost more new units opened up and the area looks so much better for it. Its truning into a lively little spot. A bit of planting to soften all that cold granite and grey aluminium wouldn’t go amiss though.\n\nRory W\n\nParticipant\n\nFrom todays Irish Times\n\nSpate of antisocial activities on Liffey boardwalk\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Hofman\n\nA meeting will take place tomorrow to address the problem of antisocial behaviour on Dublin’s Millennium Boardwalk by the Liffey.\n\nThe boardwalk, which attracts many tourists to rest, view the river and drink coffee, has become a magnet for people with alcohol and drug problems.\n\nA Garda spokesman said yesterday that an operation to tackle the problem resulted in 46 arrests in the first two months of operation, and the problem has escalated this month and in July.\n\nBetween April 2006, when the operation began, and June 2006 gardaÃ­ arrested 26 people under the drugs misuse Act and 20 for public order offences.

Last May, a month after the Garda operation began, Dublin City Council erected a number of signs along the boardwalk informing people that the consumption of intoxicating liquor in a public place is prohibited.

What the planners dont realise is that a large minority of Dubliners have absolutely no civic respect and of course the scumbags were going to make a home for themselves there. I really dont think this sizeable minority of Dubliners are mature enough or have the capacity to understand that loitering, intimidation, grafitti and littering are just not acceptable. Therefore why the planners bother I dont know. Just take a look at the gobsh*tes who thought it was a great crack to constantly vandalise ‘the speed of light’ ‘monument’ on the M1 motorway near Drogheda. Now it has to be taken out.

The junkies are all over it!:mad:\n\nAnonymous\n\nInactive\n\nDarkman and Paul H, as indicated by the article posted by Rory W, the issue is not simply about policing. There are clearly much more complex issues to be dealt with than simply trying to stike fear into those who are congregating there through zero tolerence policing. What will this solve? All it will do is move people on to another area of the city without solving anything in a real sense. It is not a case of people simply deciding that they are going to behave in a certain way, but in many cases is it is that they have found themselves in a situation where there is no other alternative.\n\nlostexpectation\n\nParticipant\n\nwhat with this talk of a tolka boardwalk, why was it made a compulsory part of the design by the council?\n\nThe boardwalk is being erected as part of deal with developers on Richmond Road.\n\nThe construction of the boardwalk was a condition under which an apartment complex was granted permission.\n\nhttp://www.dublinpeople.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1528&Itemid=49\n\nâ€œIt is our policy to maintain and enhance the natural and organic character of the rivers and canals and to promote access, walkways and other recreational uses of their associated open space.â€\n\nHe added: â€œIt is not considered that the proposed boardwalk, limited to the boundary of this site with the river, will seriously affect the amenities of residents in the area.â€\n\nSo the council have to keep access to the the waterside, so they get the apartment builders to build a boardwalk over the river… I can’t see how this would increase anti-social behaviour other then give a artificial collecting point… i probably won’t be very long…\n\nctesiphon\n\nParticipant\n\nBrazen drug dealers take over city tourist trail\n\nDrugs and money exchange hands on the Liffey Boardwalk at Eden Quay at lunchtime yesterday\n\nThursday August 24th 2006\n\nScourge moves into open in towns across the country\n\nDRUG dealers and addicts have turned one of Ireland’s main tourist thoroughfares into a virtual no-go area. An investigation by the Irish Independent shows dealers openly selling drugs on Dublin’s Liffey Boardwalk in broad daylight. And as our shocking pictures reveal, even the presence of active gardai in the area does not deter them. The blatant behaviour of the dealers in a main tourist area is the most high-profile example yet of how the scourge of drug abuse has moved into the open in towns across the country.\n\nIt came as Ireland prepares to host the Ryder Cup – and just hours after Tourism Minister John O’Donoghue launched a multi-million euro campaign to promote Irish tourism. Dublin TDs last night called for a dedicated garda patrol unit to stamp out drug abuse in the area.\n\nOver the course of a two-day investigation, we photographed dealers and addicts exchanging money for drugs in broad daylight during the height of the busy summer tourist period.\n\nOur pictures clearly show:\n\n* Drugs being openly exchanged for money;\n\n* Women hiding drugs in their bras so gardai cannot find them;\n\n* Methadone being consumed in public;\n\n* Children accompanying their parents as drug deals take place;\n\n* Customers approaching dealers and asking for their drug of choice.\n\nMale and female dealers worked up and down the tourist attraction, hiding the drugs down the back of their trousers or in their bras. Others openly waved around small bags of pills in full view of the passing public. On Tuesday, two plain-clothes gardai stopped and searched a number of people who were loitering along the boardwalk. Yesterday, the officers were back – and the dealers were still in action. Our pictures show one dealer being surrounded by a group of around six people as soon as he arrived.\n\n“The guy came up and they all swarmed around him like the Pied Piper,” said one witness.\n\nLabour TD Joe Costello said the boardwalk was once a novelty for people to walk along when they visited Dublin. “It has become a no-go area because of the activities,” he said. “Instead of being an amenity for the citizens it is a focus for people who are involved in drug-pushing to congregate.” He called for a dedicated garda squad to patrol the area and deter such activity.\n\nIndependent TD Tony Gregory also added his voice, saying the area was now a complete turn-off for tourists.\n\nA spokesman for Dublin City Council said it had a community officer to patrol the areas and report such activities to the gardai.
