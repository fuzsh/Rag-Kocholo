        "meta_description": "Grattan Bridge is a road bridge spanning the River Liffey in Dublin, Ireland, and joining Capel Street to Parliament Street and the south quays.\r\n\r\nThe first bridge on this site was built by Sir Humphrey Jervis in 1676. It was named Essex Bridge to honor Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It joined several of Jervis' developments (including Capel Street and Jervis Street) to the opposite side of the river and to Dublin Castle. Essex Bridge was an arched stone structure with 7 piers, and apparently partly constructed from the ruined masonry of nearby St. Maryâ€™s Abbey on the north side. In 1687 the bridge was damaged by a flood resulting in the loss of a hackney and two horses. The damage to the bridge was only partially repaired.\r\n\r\nIn 1751 the second-most northerly pier collapsed and damaged the adjacent arches. Between 1753 and 1755 the bridge was rebuilt by George Semple, to correct flood and other structural damage and as one of the first initiatives of the Wide Streets Commission. During this construction, some original features were removed, including the Equestrian Statue Of George I, by John van Nost the Elder, which was moved in 1798 to the gardens of the Mansion House. In 1937 it was bought by the Barber Institute for Fine Arts in Birmingham, front of which it now stands. For much of the 18th century, Essex Bridge was the most westerly bridge on the Liffey.\r\n\r\nFrom 1872, the bridge was further remodeled (on Westminster Bridge in London), being widened and flattened with cast iron supports extended out from the stonework so as to carry pavements on either side of the roadway. The bridge was (and is still) lit by ornate lamp standards also in cast iron.\r\n\r\nThe bridge was reopened as Grattan Bridge in 1874, being named after Henry Grattan MP (1746-1820).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n -",
