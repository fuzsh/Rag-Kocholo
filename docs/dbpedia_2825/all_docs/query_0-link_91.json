What a horrible colour, what were they thinking. It the colour of mint toothpaste.\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\nyep its awful alright, i saw the undercoat which was a creamy kind of colour and looked very well i cant believe they put that muck over it , who decides these things??\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\ndunno about you, but it reminds me of my mum’s garden trellis….\n\nooh, they should weave ivy and roses thru it – eh?\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\nWhy is it that they always seem to get it wrong.Grattan Bridge looks yucky now.A great example of colour blindness.What a colour combination insipid green and black. This bridge could have been better painted with a more suitable colour. With it’s detailing; the sea horses and ornate lamps makes it a perfect canvas.\n\nMind you, the blue and white job further down the Liffey looks quite attractive.Too bad about the surrounding quayside areas.Will they please sort out this mess.Give Bargaintown & Co a kick in the arse to ammend their business premises appearances.\n\nAnonymous\n\nParticipant\n\nAlso will they please give the loop-line bridge a coat of fresh paint.It would do wonders.\n\nRory W\n\nParticipant\n\nAh, but take a look at it when it is lit up at night!!!!\n\nRory W\n\nViewing 6 reply threads\n\nYou must be logged in to reply to this topic.\n\nLog In\n\nUsername:\n\nPassword:\n\nKeep me signed in\n\nLatest News"
