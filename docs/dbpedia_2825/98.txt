Dublin's Grattan Bridge is set for a Continental-style millennium facelift featuring a series of stylish new trading kiosks, writes Con Power.

Dublin Corporation aims to develop the historic bridge as a landmark crossing point from which the urban activity of the Temple Bar area can be advanced westwards towards Capel St and the newly emerging HARP precinct.

``The project will aim to reveal the style and beauty of this architecturally historic bridge to the passer-by in a more dramatic way than now exists,'' explained David Richards of Gilroy McMahon Architects.

``The street now functions solely as a traffic conduit. But it will be transformed as a result of this experimental project in terms of street movement and furniture.''

The new Grattan Bridge ``urban connections'' venture will run in tandem with the adjoining Liffey boardwalk project, and will cost around Â£1.1m. It is scheduled for completion by the end of next year.

The total budget includes replacement of solid flank walls with bollards and chained fencing, step arrangements and associated pontoon/decking, four ``commercial use'' kiosks and tourist/information kiosks with associated masts, canopies, granite paving and allowances for artwork, site fittings/furniture and planting.

Architects Gilroy McMahon are refining their design for the innovative and colourful two-sided kiosks. Dublin Corporation has expressed a preference that the new stalls should accommodate book sellers, so that the bridge will serve as a focal point for visiting tourists and Dubliners alike.

The final design will have strong maritime connotations, reflecting the past history of the bridge, with eye-catching ``masts'' recalling the tall ships era. The new structures will be of lightweight materials, such as aluminium canvas and glass.
