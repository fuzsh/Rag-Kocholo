The London School of Economics (LSE) consistently nears the top of UK and global rankings. Since 1895, the LSE has pioneered social science research, challenged existing ways of thinking, and sought to understand the causes of things to transform them.

On a journey to global citizenship, you become part of an international community and culturally diverse population of 11,000 students, around 70% of whom join from outside the UK, representing over 140 countries. From the city-center campus, you discover London, one of the world’s most vibrant cities, and follow in the footsteps of the 18 Nobel Prize winners and many world leaders among LSE’s faculty and alumni.
