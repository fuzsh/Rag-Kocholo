        "text": "Jagadeesh Palraj\n\nToday, the world’s focus is slowly but surely turning towards sustainable living and the important of organic produce and products. The impact of this worldwide concern has also reached the district of Chengelpet in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, where Jagadeesh Palraj is from. Born in Dindigul, another district of the same state, Jagadeesh was raised in Chengelpet amidst a lot of financial crises that his family faced.\n\nIt is here that Jagadeesh runs M/s Jaga Enterprises, a wholesale shop selling a variety of handmade soaps made from goat milk, sandal and other organic products. They also sell pure coconut oil.\n\nCurrently in his early thirties, Jagadeesh beat all the financial challenges that his family faced and cleared his engineering course. As an engineering graduate, he got hired by an IT farm. His family counted on his financial support to help get his sister married. After working a couple of jobs while taking care of his family, the horizon of his ambition expanded.\n\nWhile working with a company that manufactured organic products, Jagadeesh was struck by inspiration. As he gained experience in various formulations that were needed to produce soaps, he cultivated the idea of his own venture, which would be completely eco-friendly and sustainable. The thought pushed him to dedicate all his efforts and undertake extensive research. Finally, he zeroed in on the idea of manufacturing products based on plant-based raw materials that would be biodegradable in nature.\n\nIn 2017, under the brand name of Varna, he initiated his venture. Though the knowledge he garnered in his job helped his business immensely, it wasn’t really a smooth ride. Till he approached BYST for support, his business was running on limited funds and resources. Jagadeesh always wanted to grow and expand his business and take it to the next level, but he lacked the capital for it.\n\nWhile he desperately looked for funds, he came to know about BYST and their role in shaping the businesses of promising entrepreneurs. BYST spotted his passion and dedication towards his venture, and thus began Jagadeesh’s journey with BYST. He received counseling, training, financial support, mentoring as well monitoring of progress. With the support of the organization, Jagadeesh’s business proposal was developed and submitted to Indian Bank. In 2019, Jagadeesh successfully took out a business loan of Rs. 10 lakhs.\n\nOver and above the financial back up he received through BYST’s intervention, what helped Jagadeesh a lot was the mentorship he received under the organization. As a first-generation entrepreneur, the handholding, support and training he received through sessions and all the workshops he attended, was what enabled him to achieve his goals effectively.\n\nThrough this journey, Jagadeesh was supported by his mentor, Mr.Victor Joseph, an expert in marketing and branding and in the field of Plastics. Mr. Victor guided Jagadeesh through the branding process of his products and helped him digitize his business. On Mr. Victor’s advice, Jagadeesh created a website for his business. This became immensely helpful during the Coronavirus pandemic situation as Jagadeesh ended up receiving a huge order of sanitizers from the government. This order was for Chennai and other places and was to be delivered within 30 days. It was the biggest order of his career, worth around 25 lakhs.\n\nWith the transportation restrictions in place during the pandemic, delivering this order in time became a huge hurdle. During this difficult juncture, his mentor helped him to obtain a license for his commercial vehicle. Not only that, Mr. Mahesh also mediated with the bank and resolved the issue when he ran in to a roadblock while trying to open a company account.\n\nToday, with the help of a full-fledged working unit in the Chengelpet district of Tamil Nadu, Jagadeesh’s business is all set to take the next step in growth and expansion. He has also repaid his loan in full. With a focus on diversification, Jagadeesh now plans to increase his offerings to include sachets of detergent in both liquid and powder form. Quality control is extremely important to Jagadeesh. He has designated personnel for each process. New formulations of products are supported by extensive research by an R&D team.\n\nEven though his eyes are set on an exciting future, Jagadeesh hasn’t forgotten his humble beginnings. To keep doing his bit, Jagadeesh not only employs local women and men, but also trains them, thus supporting their livelihood and building their capacities. Local women, in fact, form the majority of his work force. These women come from marginalized backgrounds and have no experience in the field. Jagadeesh trains them based on their skill-sets post-employment. His compassion towards his team and his focus on their care, makes him stand out as an amazing leader. To benefit the local economy, his business supplies to few organic stores in the same region.\n\nJagadeesh is also actively involved in the activities of BYST. He participates in the training webinars regularly. He has also been part of the experience-sharing sessions during IKEA discussions.\n\nOne of the biggest qualities an entrepreneur has, is to be constantly on the lookout to bring in innovation. Jagadeesh is always on the lookout for new ideas to incorporate into his business. He wants to grow and expand his horizons and is persistent about working hard towards that goal.\n\nJagadeesh’s business model includes an end-to-end sustainable process. Even the detergent water from the washed clothes can be used directly to water the plants, as all the raw materials used in his unit are plat-based and eco-friendly. He is also one of the few in the market who use castor oil as the product base. Most other organic players in the market use coconut oil for moisturization.\n\nWith a business based out of a rural area, the purchasing power of the customers from in and around his unit is much lower than people living in the city. To meet the needs of local customers, and to make his products accessible for all sections of the society, Jagadeesh introduced sachets priced as low as Rs. 5 and Rs. 10.\n\nThe vision Jagadeesh is going forward with, is that of innovation, sustainability, and inclusive growth – quite a relevant combination given the current times, and possibly the biggest strength of his business model.\n\nMentoring Helpline – A Lifeline for BYST Entrepreneurs During Covid-19\n\nIf a call could change a life, then the call that Manjula received, 10 days into the lockdown, from her BYST Mentor, would qualify as one! The lockdown imposed after the pandemic had a catastrophic impact on small and marginal businesses across the country and Manjula’s, a BYST entrepreneur from Chennai, was no exception. Her tailoring business was badly affected as she was not able to commute to her unit in Saligramam from her residence at Kundrathur, roughly 14kms apart. She was able to carry out some stitching work from home though, thanks to the two sewing machines that she had. However, the distress of a stalled unit was too much for her to bear day to day expenses had to be met and installment of the bank loan had to be paid and she did not know what to do. It was during such a time that she received a call from BYST Helpline. This Helpline is a unique initiative started by BYST to alleviate problems and mitigate the stress of entrepreneurs, in the wake of the lockdown that was imposed in March. Undertaken with the help of thousand-odd mentors from its pool of volunteer Mentors, BYST’s goal was to quickly reach out, through phone / WhatsApp calls, to over 5000 of its entrepreneurs to help them cope with this crisis situation --- by sharing information and business tips, by mentoring them, and most importantly, by listening to them! Manjula was connected to Mentor Haribhaskar and the latter was able to understand the challenges that Manjula has been facing. He spent some time discussing and gave her some productive suggestions. He analyzed and suggested that Manjula could explore ways to slightly modify her business and look at options to stitch face masks, which are in great demand, to attract revenue. Even though Manjula was ready to take up the suggestion and work on it, she faced hindrances in finance raw materials had to be bought and her cash flow situation did not allow that. Mentor Haribhaskar identified a supplier of unfinished masks and referred Manjula to him. The work involved stitching the elastic part to the face mask. This way, she did not have to invest. Within a week Manjula was handed over a stock of 1500 facemasks that had to be stitched with elastic bands. Every piece of elastic stitched would earn her Rs.75 paise/piece (face mask). To deliver the stock on time, she somehow managed to transfer one of her machines from her unit to her house. Manjula’s elder son, who worked with her, pitched in as well. Manjula lives in Kundrathur, outskirts of Chennai with her 2 sons. A single mother, she has been working as a tailor for 23 years, supporting both her children with her meager income. With hard work & resilience she managed to set up her own unit in Saligramam, Chennai in 2013. Her elder son has been supporting her in the business while the younger one goes to college. In 2018 when Manjula approached SBI bank to expand her business she was, in turn, referred to BYST by the bank. BYST found in her a hardworking and sincere entrepreneur and was happy to extend mentoring support that is so much required for businesses such as hers. BYST also facilitated a loan of 3 lakhs from SBI. This helped her diversify her business and incorporate new designs as per the latest trends in the market. She has been regular with her loan repayment for 15 months now and though a complete repayment and loan closure is some distance away, Manjula is determined and hopes to take her business to the next level in the coming days. She is all set to deliver her first stock of stitched masks by this week with the support of BYST & Mentor Hari Bhaskar. She hopes to get the subsequent orders that would help her stay on course. Her story, of spotting and making use of opportunities in the darkest times, is sure to inspire others. Section 0\n\nNeelima Tippavanjhla\n\nSometimes, opportunities present themselves at the most unexpected times. The ones who recognise them and grab them, are the ones who usually taste success. COCOTANG, the world’s first exclusive tender coconut–milk shake brand, was also conceived by accident while its owner was pregnant. COCOTANG is owned by Dr. Neelima T. who completed her BDS and MBA and used to be a dental practitioner.\n\nDue to some medical complications during her pregnancy, she was advised bed rest and diet modifications. Coconut water formed an important part of her diet. She realised that the drink helped her cope well with her medical problems. It was then that she took interest in the fruit and started studying extensively about the benefits of coconut and coconut water.\n\nFrom her in-depth research she found that tender coconut pulp, rich in fibre and low in fat, is one of the richest sources of Monolaurin. Monolaurin is an antibiotic, antiviral, anti-fungal and immune-boosting agent, which makes it safe for every age group starting from six-month-old infants to the elderly. It has promising health benefits.\n\nThis experience inspired her to start COCOTANG, and to fortify coconut water with fruits to make it more palatable and nutritious. She used the tender coconut pulp to make pulp shakes in many exciting flavours. Her team worked with the National Institute of Nutrition to identify the right ingredients to ensure consistency in taste, and proper scientific handling procedures to enhance the shelf life of the products. Today, COCOTANG manufactures a wide range of tender coconut shakes and coconut mocktails. These drinks are dairy-free and preservative-free and are a great replacement for milkshakes, especially for vegans, and people with lactose intolerance.\n\nTheir uniqueness lies in the products themselves, and in the way COCOTANG delivers its services. The menu is dynamic, and changes seasonally, bringing a fresh menu every three months. The focus is on value addition to nature’s best electrolyte drink, i.e., coconut water. They do it by adding fruits to the drink, based on every customer’s taste.\n\nThe company also boasts of creating unique drink combinations that address some specific health problems thus benefitting customers in many ways. These are usually special detoxification drinks made with coconut milk. This is an excellent replacement of milkshakes for vegans and people with lactose intolerance.\n\nBefore launching the venture, she conducted a pilot study in Chandanagar in 2016. Once the concept was well-received by people, she set up two kiosks. Due some problems between her landlord and the municipality, she was asked to relocate and that delayed the opening of her store. Neelima never gave up trying, and in 2017 she opened a walk-in store at Pragathi Nagar.\n\nThey worked very hard to take this concept to the public. It was an uphill task as they did not have any connections in the market, nor any support to thrive in the entrepreneurial sector. While struggling to increase visibility and awareness for the product, the networking support and assistance they received from BYST contributed largely to their success.\n\nNeelima learnt about BYST through one of their Awareness Generation Programs.She was counselled, trained, and presented her business plan to the bankers with support from the BYST officials. Post this, she got a loan amount of INR 5.84 lakhs (£5880). She received timely support from BYST and the right guidance from her assigned mentor Mr. Ashok Kumar Gupta.\n\nMr Ashok Kumar Gupta, Managing Director, Rockwell Industries Limited, Hyderabad, is Neelima’s mentor. He has been a pillar of support at every stage of her business. From helping her with his knowledge and expertise, to using his own experience in chillers and refrigerators manufacturing background, he has stood by her. He helped her choose the right machinery and created a great network base leveraging BYST connections. He has been constantly motivating her to showcase her products at various events conducted by BYST-CII and other partner organizations. Once she met her mentor, there was no turning back for Neelima. She is constantly in touch with him and takes his suggestions before making any important decision for her business.\n\nEncouraged by this support, they opened an online store in Gachinowli in August 2017 with minimum investment. As the next step, they adopted the cloud-kitchen model with lesser overheads and investment and opened one more store in Madhapur in 2018. This helped them study and understand customer behaviour in the area well.\n\nNeelima’s story is quite a turn of fate, given her background and history. Elder of two siblings, Neelima is not even from an entrepreneurial background. Her father is a bank manager at the Andhra Bank. She got married to Chaitanya, who is the son of a mechanic and has faced many challenges while trying to complete his education.\n\nIn this process, she took suggestions from CFTRI and CDB, met many food technicians and had her team do retrograde work right from the procurement of farm for perennial raw material supply. Through this journey she faced a lot of opposition for deviating from her dental practice. With due support from her husband, she quit her dental practice. Though her family resisted in the beginning, they saw promising results from the pilot they ran from her husband’s friend’s restaurant. This helped them gain the trust of their family members and they started their business with their own investment.\n\nHer team spent many hours developing a product and getting it approved by NIN, all the research work was done in small premises at home with limited resources. Being unprocessed food, initially the shelf life of the product was a problem. But she stuck to her conviction and over the years, she went on to win the JCI Business excellence award in 2018 and her name has been mentioned in the Telugu Book of records. Her entrepreneurial journey is also a case study in the Emerald Journal in UK, North America, Japan, India, Malaysia, and China.\n\nCOCOTANG has passed many phases to reach the product shelf life of a week. They are still working extensively to increase the shelf life without involving any processing or heating to preserve its naturalness. As the product is a novelty, they spent a lot of time understanding and studying the benefits. The knowledge of physiology helped Neelima a lot here.\n\nHowever, the novelty of the new products was wearing off at COCOTANG India. They had started a business by bootstrapping (funding the venture with their own resources) but soon faced financial constraints. They ran out of resources and were literally facing the gun. Without funding, the venture could not progress any further.\n\nAt this stage, they approached BYST in 2016. Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust is a trust that encourages, incubates and handholds budding entrepreneurs in India. Learning about the unique product mix of COCOTANG India, BYST helped them secure a business loan and even assigned Mr. Ashok Kumar Gupta as a mentor for them to handhold and support them in their journey. Mr. Gupta is a senior mentor at BYST Hyderabad cluster.\n\nCOCOTANG India is an innovation-driven company. Its unique combination of flavours also addresses some specific health problems. Customers who benefit from the product relate it to a special detoxification drink made with coconut milk. The USP of COCOTANG is the fact that the whole process is natural, and it’s an environment-friendly brand. There is no other brand exclusively manufacturing coconut-based milkshakes. As the whole process is natural, COCOTANG does not cause any hazards to the environment, and all the by-products are put to maximum use and are biodegradable.\n\nSecondly, coconut water is not just refreshing. It is high in potassium and contains most of the health benefits found in sports drinks (which are not natural). A typical 16-ounce carton of coconut water is low-carb and has about 80 calories. That’s about half or less than what is present in a similar-sized soft drink. Besides, it is devoid of all the sugar and chemicals that are crammed into a can of soda.\n\nAll COCOTANG’s drinks are packed under hygienic conditions and dispatched to consumers in a properly maintained cold system. The primary consumers range from the health-conscious people, vegans, the lactose intolerant, gym goers, the hotel industry (welcome drinks) etc.\n\nCurrently, there are 10 employees in the company, and the company appreciates and acknowledges their efforts. The best performance is awarded an incentive and bonus. For unmarried female employees, COCOTANG gives one month’s salary as a bonus at the time of marriage. It also pays exam fees for some employees. With the company growing, they are now looking into the health and welfare needs of the employees as well their families.\n\nAccording to the COCOTANG team, “As an organization, it is the public or community who helps us earn. We feel responsible and thus, we follow certain principles. We spend 5% of our profit share on social activities. Once every month, we conduct a food drive. We donate schoolbooks or pay the school fees for the marginalised. We also buy furniture for old-age homes. Most importantly, we ensure that every bit of plastic from our factory goes into recycling. We never use things that are hazardous to our workers, or the environment. We never subject our food to a harmful process as we want to keep our products as natural as we can. The product is quite sustainable. With increasing awareness around health and wellness, the market share for healthy juices is expected to increase by 5.7% annually. In a consumer-based market, with the growing demand, offering quality is key for sustainability”.\n\nAmruta\n\nIt’s 2022 already, the world is smaller than it ever was, connected through various innovative means. And yet, the phrase “Women in STEM” draws out a collective sigh. The percentage of women in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) workforce is under 30%.\n\nConsidered a male-dominated field, even more so in India, not many decisions made by women to enter the field of the sciences are welcomed by all. Luckily for Amruta Mangale from Pune, she was born into a family that did not feel the same way. She completed her Masters in Organic Chemistry from Indapur district in Pune, well supported in her decision by her middle-class family, despite their struggles. The real challenge for Amruta started post her education when she started looking for a job. Even with a Masters degree, she could only secure a job in the quality control department of a local dairy in her district. Her salary was INR 10,000 a month.\n\nBut Amruta had a different mindset from the beginning. She wanted to utilise her education to the maximum and start her own business. After she married in 2015, she found the perfect partner to take this idea forward with. Her in-laws were very supportive of her ideas and stood by her decisions even as she decided to sell her jewellery to arrange for funds to make her dreams come true. Thus began her journey to shatter the glass ceiling.\n\nToday Amruta runs Hindavi Solution Pvt. Ltd. the only company manufacturing adhesive tapes for packaging boxes in Pune under the brand name of Beestofix. The use of adhesive tapes offers many advantages over binding techniques such as sewing, mechanical fastening, thermal bonding, etc. These include the ability to bind different materials together, to distribute stress more efficiently across the joint, the cost-effectiveness of an easily mechanized process, an improvement in aesthetic design, and increased design flexibility. Her company was launched in 2018.\n\nNeedless to say, Amruta’s knowledge in Chemistry has been her greatest weapon. She developed the products inhouse and scaled up the production to the commercial level without compromising on product quality or cost effectiveness. An intelligent businesswoman, Amruta got involved in this business only after conducting a careful and extensive market research. She earlier had a not-so-successful run with a CCTV installation business. Her research revealed that the adhesive required for packing tape in Pune is supplied from companies based in Gujrat, Wapi and Daman. There were no Pune-based manufacturers. And yet, there are around 7-8 big companies manufacturing packing boxes with an average monthly requirement of around 160 tons of packing adhesives.\n\nHowever, when she approached Bank of Maharashtra for a business loan to expand her business, her application did not go through because she had no collaterals in Pune. The bank manager took notice of her and referred her to BYST. BYST helped her and facilitated the process of loan application. With BYST’s support a loan amount of Rs. 20 lakhs was disbursed.\n\nHer mentor at BYST is Mr. Kiran Nawathe, a veteran automotive design engineer, sought after engineering and management best practices speaker. Amruta says her journey would not have been possible without her ‘guru’. Mr. Nawathe helped focus on taking an innovative route in manufacturing adhesives for packaging. With his guidance, Amruta has been able to understand the market, changing customer needs, where to sell and how to expand. She also learnt to optimise working capital, diversify her products, maintain and improve product quality, importance of after sales service and low credit period from her mentor and is putting it to good use. During Covid19, when inter-state transportation was shut, her mentor guided her to approach the packaging units to sell her adhesives. All the new strategies she keeps learning from her mentor makes Amruta confident to hit the INR 10 crore mark by 2022. And she is already at INR 7.5 crore.\n\nToday, Beestofix also produces tape pigment, solvent cement. They are planning to launch wood working adhesives in the future. She grew by building strong & lasting social relationships within the community. She also generated employment for the residents, hence contributing to national development. She has paid GST amounting to INR 2.79 lakhs in just the first year of business, contributing actively towards the economic growth of the country. Today, Beestofix manufactures over 300 tonnes of industrial adhesive, 1500 kg of printing ink and 5000 kg of colour pigment every month.\n\nAmruta’s business was just a year old when the Coronavirus pandemic broke out. She started her business of manufacturing adhesives in March 2019. And yet, she has managed to achieve a turnover of INR 5 crores in FY21. After the pandemic hit and the lockdown followed, her business was completely shut. However, her sound financial planning enabled her to tackle the situation better and she could pay staff salaries, rent of the unit and other expenses of the business. In fact, once she settled into the rhythm, amidst the pandemic, she soared.\n\nUtilising the lockdown situation to her advantage and executing all she learnt from the various webinars organised by BYST on digitisation and social media marketing, she started using digital platforms to grow her business. Through her social media handle she reached out to many prospects, understood their requirements, sent quotations, sealed orders and her business was back in action. She also manufactured product samples and sent it to prospects. That helped convert them into customers. Amidst the lockdown, Amruta managed to expand her sales nationally by going digital. In November 2020, Amruta competed successfully with over 1,000 entrepreneurs from 54 countries to win the prestigious ‘Young Entrepreneur of the Year’ award conferred by Youth Business International, UK, an organisation working in 65 countries to enable underserved young people to realise their business ideas.\n\nEconomy, Entrepreneurs and Corona virus!\n\nEconomy, Entrepreneurs and Corona virus!\n\nContributed by BYST Mentor, CA Rajkumar Kattimani, Pune As the Corona pandemic continues its disruption, the livelihood of many entrepreneurs and business owners has been threatened. It’s obvious that even after the lockdown overall economic situation is going to be challenging and businesses will see tough times. However, normalcy will be restored slowly but steadily, and one will surely see the growth rates that is aspired for but need to have the patience for the time being. For small and medium businesses, here are some measures that can help in reviving your business during and after the lockdown Review your business plan Most of the time “People don’t plan to fail, they fail to plan”; If you’re the one who never believed in business plans, this is the best time to make one for your business. A business plan is a blueprint for your business. It also depicts action points on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis, so as to achieve the business objectives. Borrowing funds in the current scenario will be easy but will surely add the burden to your liabilities, and hence financial planning at this point is really a crucial part of the business. For the regular business planners, this is the time to critically review the plan. Review your plan, not only for this year but the next two years as well. It may call for systematic and large-scale changes in operations, change in pricing policy or delivery terms, etc. To do - Invest your time in planning your business and take the help of BYST, mentor, your business partners, and consultants wherever and whenever required. Align your business with the theme of recovery Post lockdown, a large chunk of the population may have a lower income level, businesses across the globe will be in a recovery mode. So, realign your business by offering your customers anything that will ease and support the task of recovery. It will result in customer delight and will win customer loyalty. You may be required to reconsider/review profit margins. Find out more about variable cost and fixed cost of business for a better decision. To Do Negotiate with your suppliers to reduce the variable cost, if possible Try to convert the existing fixed cost into variable cost by outsourcing the activity Try to reduce the fixed cost per unit Brace the challenge with some solid preparation so that you can be on top of your customers’ minds. Reach your customer online Keep in touch with your customers by using online platforms. If you have any then this is the right time to have one. Take the help of digital marketing experts and try studying the online supply chain till then. Make use of this lockdown time, to speak to your customers, suppliers, and employees also. Try to have video conferencing with them. Take your business online in true sense. Make all your stakeholders feel that they are important to you and you stand with them at this time. To Do Reach out to your customers to tell them that you’re available online and what you can offer them. The digital economy is vast, make the most of it. Restructure your business models In case lowering/reducing profit margins is not possible then think of alternative pricing models – Royalty-based pricing, Razor and Blade model, profit-sharing model or outcome-based model – these are some of the value-pricing models that you can discuss with your valued customers who will like your out-of-the-way business thinking and reward you handsomely. Let’s take an example of a Royalty-based business model: Let’s assume you are providing R&D services to a mobile manufacturing company that is developing a new model. Your minimum cost is INR 10,000 per hour of project work. You may bill at INR 11,000 per hour (only 10% margin) and royalty of INR 1000 for every piece of a new model sold by the company. This model is not only appreciated by loved by customers and they will become your long term, business partners. To do Remember that, value capturing will be a tougher challenge than value delivery in the next few quarters.\n\nThe heart that gives, gathers!\n\nFrom Contributing to the PM’s relief fund to taking care of his employees during the lockdown, Mr Ragu has clearly raised the bar for all business owners and redefined a citizen’s duty to the country. Since the lockdown, with his cement pipe manufacturing unit shut, it has been tough for Ragu. Despite that, he has been rendering all the necessary support to his 30 plus employees, including 10 migrant labourers from the north. Ever since the lockdown 5 of the migrant labourers were helped by Ragu to safely reach their hometown. He supports the rest of his employees with accommodation and food expenses on a weekly basis and ensures full payments to all his employees. The empathy that he has probably stemmed from his own experience and background – a life of struggle and hardship, before he made it big as an entrepreneur. Ragu, hailing from a scheduled tribal community in Oragadam village, Tamil Nadu, started his career in 1992 as a lorry cleaner. In 2001, he joined as a loader in a small company that manufactured cement pipes. There, he learnt the role of “cement manufacturing business”. Working as load-man, Ragu established contact with a Karur-based firm and started marketing their cement pipes in Chennai. After gaining experience and confidence in the field, Ragu incorporated his firm “Everest Cement Pipes” in 2009 with an initial investment of INR 20,000. Possessing few sub-contract orders from Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, Ragu approached every local bank to get a business loan, however his efforts failed. In 2012 a newly established branch of IOB bank near his unit lent 24,000 which he successfully repaid in 2013. He was referred to BYST by the Bank for his second term loan. BYST supported Ragu in maintain all his records properly and hand-held him for nearly a year. In 2014, BYST successfully assisted Ragu to get INR. 16 Lacs from Indian Overseas Bank, Mudichoor. In 2017, he was given an additional loan of Rs 440,000 Lacs from Indian Bank. Ragu started with just 2 employees in 2009 which rose to 12 in 2014 and further to 30 after BYST’s intervention. Ragu enjoys good customer base from an array of industry. His reputed clients include KSA Power Infra, Sterling and Wilson, Lotus Wireless Technology VJN Builders, EK Infra, TJR, PMR Constructions, Marutham Apartments, Amar Prakash Builders, Naveen Construction, Swan Electricals. Ragu now handles Korean based international companies namely K&K and Kotak Infra. Everest Pipes manufactures a wide range of customized products including Cement pipes, Hollow bricks, manhole covers for building roads and drainages, favour blocks (used for setting car parking floors) and well-rings (used for setting up septic tanks). Mr Ragu, who resides with his family in Perungulathur, considers it his duty to support his employees during such challenging times. He also believes that it’s his duty to contribute to the initiatives of the Government and adhering to this belief, he has contributed Rs 5000/- to ‘PM Relief Fund’ as well as another 5000/- to the ‘CM Relief Fund’ Even though he has been facing challenges in getting payments from his vendors, he was able to get 10% corona fund out of the cash credit amount of Rs.25 lakhs from Indian bank. With this amount, he has effectively managed to afford the salaries and other expenses of the business. He is coping well and thereby expecting to resume his business post 20th April, as the Govt. is likely to extend permission for certain industries to function. Ragu is full of hope and looks forward to resuming his business in full swing!\n\nWebinar by BYST Mentor- \"From Mind Full to Mindfulness\"\n\nWebinar Addressed by Mrs. Ranjini Manian Before this global pandemic, we were all living a very fast-paced life, and now due to lockdown and work from home, all our schedules have taken a hit. To effectively use the digital medium, BYST organized a webinar on living a life full of mindfulness in spite of extreme circumstances. BYST Mentor, Mrs. Manian with more than thirty years of experience spoke about maintaining a work-life balance during these circumstances. While we are all busy striving for success, she said we also need to put emphasis on sitting in silence and practicing one’s wellbeing. No matter how negative things get around us, it is in our power to make those negatives into positives. To follow this, she began with a few guidelines. Take-Aways: Thrive Sunflower Style: Nature gave us a pause in this life and it's up to us to refocus our perspectives, think about what actually matters. Balance for Better: Find a way to bloom in adversity, to make your time alone count. Look for your mind and body, work, and life balance. Take Time for Relationships: \"Personal relationships are the first casualties.\" Make time for each other, stay away from your gadgets, even if only to share a meal. She led the audience into an 8-minute meditation session, guiding their spirit and actions and bringing about a relaxed and grateful atmosphere. She said, \"learn to be in your own company because that experience helps us to be completely mindful.\" The biggest takeaway for BYST entrepreneurs and mentors from the webinar has been to take out time from one’s busy schedules and involve in mindful practices Meditation: Train your attention, become what you meditate, focus on your goal, and enhance your struggle to achieve it. Gratitude: Make it a way of life, 3-4 things at the end of the day to see a better change in your outlook. \"Gratitude is an Attitude.\" Mrs. Manian shed light on her thoughts about meditation and explained how meditation train one’s brain into a powerful tool. It can be the key, to help you succeed, to make you happy, and be in control of your emotions. In an urban lifestyle, we have lost sight of ourselves So just be. Live your life and take control of your actions. And to do that, she suggested practicing ‘BE’. Begin your day with meditation End your day with gratitude The session was beautifully ended with questions from the audience on how to make someone happy, how to maintain self-respect, and how to cope with negativity around. She also encouraged the support BYST is providing their entrepreneurs in this tough time.\n\nJenifer Yacob\n\n“Things work out best for those who make the best of how things work out,” said John Wooden. Ms. Jenifer Y personifies this quoted line. Born and raised in Chennai, India, this young woman always dreamt of becoming a doctor from her childhood. However, her father did not have the means to support this dream financially. Not one to give up on her ambition, Jenifer chose to opt for something closest to becoming a doctor. She took took up Diploma in Dental Technology. While studying for the diploma, she developed a passion for the subject and graduated with sincerity. It was during the course that she discovered a great business opportunity in the field of dental technology. She immediately began saving for her business. Jenifer now lives in Ramapuram, Chennai with her husband, Mr. Shriraj. She is a mother to two daughters. Both husband and wife are diploma holders in Dental Technology from Saveetha Dental College. As per Jenifer’s plan, as soon as they obtained their diplomas, the duo headed straight to initiate their venture in 2007. They set up Oscar Dental with some monetary support from Jenifer’s father to begin their business. However, that capital was not enough to procure equipment required to expand their business. Hence, they bought two machines on credit from the market and repaid the loans within six months. This helped them build a goodwill for themselves. When they began, Jenifer would design the moulds for all the orders by herself. The process was manual, extremely detail-oriented, and time-consuming. The products had to be handcrafted according to the scanned blueprint. The time she needed to do this became a hindrance in accepting large orders that were coming her way, thus hindering the growth of her business. This was when she thought automation would be able to solve the problem she was facing. However, automation would need funding. Fortunately for Jenifer, she got in touch with BYST at this opportune moment. It was with the support from BYST that she was able to get a loan of Rs. 17 lakhs from Indian Overseas Bank (Ramapuram Branch, Chennai). The loan helped her procure an imported designing machine which made her deliver more orders with greater precision, in lesser time. BYST helped her with mentoring support, loan enhancement and trainings. These gave her the exposure she needed to reflect upon her business growth plans and set bigger targets for herself. Jenifer’s mentor Mr. Haribhaskaran guided her from day one and helped her streamline her business. This set her on to the right path for her to achieve her dreams for her company. One of the first things he helped her identify were the gaps in bookkeeping. With tips from him, she has learnt to create and maintain a reserve for emergency utilization and does not put the entire income back into the business. Before he intervened, Jenifer did not have a proper book of accounts. She accounted the payments & purchases category-wise. Today, Oscar Dental manufactures and supplies artificial teeth and tooth caps. Their products use eco-friendly materials, and they use a non-polluting production process. They also play an active role in creating awareness about preventive dental care covering gum-loss and bone loss in women. An ISO certified organization, Oscar Dental’s products are manufactured with 60% machine intervention and 40% manual customization. Their technicians are trained to match the colour of implants to natural teeth, thus giving them an edge over other manufacturers. Jenifer plans to go for an expansion loan as soon as the dental health industry stabilises from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Oscar Dental plans to capture a larger share of India’s dental treatment market which is estimated to be at Rs 1,000,000 crores by 2022. They plan to set up a 5000 sq ft manufacturing facility near Chennai by 2022, with a capacity to manufacture 150 artificial teeth & implants daily. A dental clinic and research centre are also part of the plan. The company has adopted state–of–the–art technology and plans to install advanced machineries. Their plans for the next 5 years are to: Develop 25 skilled workers in the next one year to improve production and enhance capacity utilization of existing machinery, Create systems and procedures to improve productivity and margins, Increase customers base from 70 to 125 clinics, Meet dental treatment needs of thousands of rural Indian women. Jenifer believes strongly in making the world a better place to live. To build harmony across the globe, Oscar Dental pursues UN SDGs in the following ways: End Poverty in all its forms everywhere – Jenifer specifically selects her employees from marginalized sections of society. She plans to train at least 100 school dropouts & disabled people in 5 years.\n\nEnsure healthy lives and promote wellbeing of all – Oscar Dental’s high-quality products are affordable by elders, pregnant women and also the poor. Jenifer won the prestigious JRD TATA Award in 2018. A first-generation entrepreneur from a lower socio-economic background, she not only overcame financial difficulties, but also shattered many gender stereotypes to setup a successful venture in the highly sophisticated Dental Implants Industry. This daughter of a small-time construction labourer today employs 26 people directly and indirectly supports another 104. Her zeal to contribute to the society, makes her design processes to deliver cost-effective, yet high quality tooth implants. Quality wise, her products are at par with high-end artificial teeth supplied by multinationals. Their longevity is also much better than handmade local products thereby benefitting thousands of poor patients. Based on each patient’s diagnosis provided by the dentist, Jenifer and her team analyse the patient’s history and discuss the details of design as well as the size of tooth before customizing the cap, bridges, and dentures. Oscar Dental’s skills lie in bringing the natural colour of the patient’s teeth to the artificial tooth by creating layers of Dentine and Enamel. Their focus is on restoration of natural teeth, and they advise implantation of teeth only if it is necessary.\n\nBalamurugan\n\nBYST high-flyer entrepreneur, Balamurugan from Tamil Nadu has experimented and succeeded in designing a UV sterilizer box to kill bacteria present in everyday essentials including cash, mobile, keys etc. Usually, ultra violet rays are used to kill microbes and most of the hospitals use UV lamps to sterilize the products. Balamurugan has adopted the same technology and modified its usage according to the current situation where hygiene is touted the most important.\n\nThe UV sterilizer box works in such a way that the energy from the ultraviolet light is absorbed by the fluorescent coating inside the fluorescent lamp and re-emitted as visible light; similar tubes without the same fluorescent coating emit UV light that can be used to disinfect surfaces, since the ionizing effect of UV radiation can kill most bacteria and virus. It is seen that the average bacterium could be killed between 12 to 16 seconds at a distance of six inches from the lamp.\n\nBalamurugan has appealed mainly to the banks to place his sterilizer box in the cash station for the currency notes to be sterilized prior to handing over to the cashier. By doing so, bacteria present in the currency notes are killed ensuring a safe transaction. In addition to currency notes, things like keys, ATM cards, ornaments etc. can also be sterilized. He is currently in the process of creating visibility and awareness for his product in the market as well as among the people. He has in fact released a promotional video on the sterilizer box and its significance.\n\nDuring the Lockdown, like every other business, Balamurugan’s business experienced a hit which led him to juggle between various aspects of the business such as orders as well as payment to his employees. However, he managed to pay all his 7 employees their full salaries even during such challenging times. He claims that as an entrepreneur he has also utilized the time to think and modify his products relevant to the post lockdown situation.\n\nHe is also aware that for the next few months customers may not be interested on luxury products but the ones that are considered essential. Since hygiene and safety would be given utmost priority, he had put his efforts in designing the “Sterilizer Box”\n\nBalamurugan hails from Tindivanam district of Tamil Nadu. His father used to be a farmer. Balamurugan is the only son with two elder sisters and two younger sisters, hence had a major share in running the family. Post his 10th grade, Balamurugan pursued a diploma in Electronics, Television Technology from A.M. Jain College-Institute of Management. He has also completed a part-time course of Diploma in Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning in a private institute. Balamurugan’s Technical qualification helped him to start his career as a service representative with Lakshmi & Co, a home appliances company. In his eagerness to learn all the skills related to servicing and manufacturing electronic consumer goods, he approached and joined small companies that could give him the opportunity to learn. He earned the trust and confidence of his employers and at one point, they allowed him to start a branch in Kerala (PRESVI Industrial Co). However, it is only when he was working as a Technical Assistant with the R & D Dept. of Institute of Technology, he started showing interest in Industry Automation Projects. He gradually rose to become the quality controller in the production unit.\n\nLater he joined EUREKA FORBES as a sales representative and quickly rose to become a Team Leader. With a total of 9 years of experience in both manufacturing, servicing and marketing businesses gave him the needed confidence and skills to start a venture on his own. His business intuition told him that if he had to start a new business it has to be in the field of “Consumer Electronics”. With ITI experience, he adapted the temperature controller modules to suit household use and came out with the new product “Water Level Controller”.\n\nFinally in 1995, Balamurugan started his own business “ELITE” with his borrowings of\n\nRs.30, 000 from a private source and his own savings. He wanted to stabilize his innovative venture and learnt about BYST through a friend who had approached BYST earlier for trading business. By seeing the innovative product and his confidence BYST sanctioned him a loan of Rs.20, 000 for raw materials for manufacturing water level controllers. He deals with Eliteron based Water level controller and other related electronics. In 1997, he expanded his business and renamed as ‘Elite Pro’ and later in 2006 as ‘Eliteron products.’ Currently he is looking forward to launch his STERILIZER BOX in a weak or two!!\n\nYogesh Gawande\n\nThe most powerful inspiration is often found in our surroundings, in the small things we grow up with and incidents in our daily lives that leave an impression on us. It was the same for Yogesh Gawande. Growing up in an agrarian family in Aurangabad, Yogesh experienced the little joys and struggles of being part of a socio-economically backward family of small farmers.\n\nHis parents owned a small farm, and most of his extended family members were engaged in farming or in agriculture related work. Though his parents struggled financially, they ensured that Yogesh completed his education and enrolled him into Mechanical Engineering. While he was in college, his parents saved some money with great difficulty, to buy him a mobile phone. However, the boy had other ideas. He used that money to develop the prototype of a liquid spray pump for his first-year engineering project. This pump would spray liquid pesticides or insecticides and would be extremely beneficial for farmers.\n\nThe pump won him the first prize. Surprised with this success, Yogesh wanted to develop the idea further. He thought about commercialising the product. Proactive by nature, he started participated in trade shows and expos and displayed his product, even while he continued to study. As a part-time entrepreneur, he managed to sell 20 pumps!\n\nOnce he completed his degree, it was time to put his ideas into action. He came to BYST with his concept. BYST helped him through a three-month orientation session where he learnt about the steps of doing business, accounting, marketing, and networking. He was assigned a mentor from a similar field. Mr. Milind Kank, Yogesh’s mentor, helped his develop his concept further and converted it into a viable business idea. With a robust business proposal, Yogesh was able to withdraw a loan to kickstart his business.\n\nWith his mentor’s guidance, Yogesh expanded his portfolio to include a manual model, a battery-operated model and a combined (manual-cum-automatic) model. When the pandemic induced a lockdown in India, he was also able to pitch the product to be used to sanitise narrow roads and streets where big trucks and machines could not reach. This idea from his mentor helped him create a whole new vertical for his business. Realising that going digital is the next best step for his business, his mentor guided him to create a YouTube channel and register his business on e-commerce portals and web directories. He also built his own website.\n\n“My mentor not only guided me with skills and expert advice, but also helped me with courage and knowledge which was essential for me to run this business. I was just a kid out of college at that time. His guidance is the reason why I am who I am today,” Yogesh confesses.\n\nFifty percent of India’s population is into farming. And over eighty five percent of those farmers are small or medium farmers. Yogesh’s childhood made him very familiar with the struggles and challenges small farmers face. The farmers in his village were toiling hard, but without much success. Lacking the right equipment and tools, the time they spent in farming was hardly commensurate with the benefits they received. Yogesh desperately wanted to help make their lives better. His product was inspired by the daily battles he grew up observing all around him.\n\nAfter fine-tuning his products under the guidance of his mentor, the products have had a great impact on the farmer community, helping over 12,000 farmers spread over 14 States. They no longer have to carry heavy pumps on their backs but can conveniently wheel them to the farm sites thereby saving them from grave physical injuries. Conventional spraying which would usually take anywhere between one to two hours of time to complete now can be achieved in under 30 minutes. The product is very affordable to even small and marginal farmers.\n\nToday, in late twenties, Yogesh can already take care of his family. He is so grateful to them for sacrificing so much to provide for his education and constantly encourage him to follow his dreams. His father and brother work with him now, helping to extend educational support and internship opportunities to other extended members of the family. He already has created six jobs and has also been able to help his sister and his widowed aunt. Being able to do something for his loved ones at such a young age boosts his confidence.\n\nVaishali Patil\n\nIn India and the world over, life usually presents more obstacles in the path of a woman than her male counterpart trying to achieve similar objectives in life; a number of extra hurdles that she must overcome to reach the same destination. It was not different for Mrs. Vaishali Patil. Born in Dayal Nagar (Wardha, Maharashtra), to a family with limited means, Vaishali’s life was quite difficult from the word go. She had to give up on her studies as soon as she completed her secondary education because her parents would not be able to afford higher education for her. In many parts of the country, till date, marrying off a girl whose education cannot be afforded is presented as the only solution by the society. The onus of protecting her is transferred from her father to her husband. The same happened with Vaishali. However, life had different plans for her, and did she rise to the occasion!\n\nThough a kind and supportive person, Vaishali’s husband fell so ill in the initial years of their marriage, that he lost his job. Suddenly, the young woman now had the role of the breadwinner of the family. She neither had experience, nor the exposure to this kind of a responsibility, but she definitely had the aptitude.\n\nVaishali spotted a job vacancy for the position of a team leader in a company called Ideal Washing Co. in Bhandara, quite far from her house. She bagged the job, and moved there to support her family. While on the job, she learnt quite a few things. . Her role taught her how to deal with retailers, how to keep up with market trends, and how to keep customers happy. She also learnt a lot about the system of demand and supply.\n\nHowever, the company would keep back a large chunk of employees’ salaries and treated them as shareholders, promising to invest the money into the business and share the profit with all the employees. To substitute the missing part of her income, Vaishali had started making papad and pickles at home and sold them door-to-door. She would sell about four kinds of food items, barely making any money to meet her daily expenses. It was going well until, suddenly she was left without a job when the company simply vanished from the town.\n\nBut Vaishali now was a different woman. Though she had always nurtured a dream of being self-employed and doing something in the field of homemade products, she was under-confident. But the exposure she got from working with a corporate gave her to confidence to take the plunge now. Having faced a lot of difficulties in her own life, she also wanted to help other women in her community. Creating jobs and becoming self-reliant was a great way to lead by example.\n\nThus was born Vaishali Gruh Udyog. She started her business with a lot of confidence, armed with her family’s support, and an initial investment of INR 50,000 from her savings. However, she still needed basic necessities and the guidance to apply for a business loan. And she had no idea about these things. Neither did she have any bank transactions to show for her work experience, nor the paperwork required to apply for the loan, or a guarantor.\n\nBut it was meant to be. Around the same time, she got to know about BYST from the newspaper, and immediately got in touch. BYST helped her refine her project idea and also helped with the required paperwork. Bank officials visited her place to see the kind of work she was doing. Vaishali applied for a loan of INR 2 lakhs but the bank sanctioned INR 3 lakhs within five days of applying for the loan. With this money Vaishali was able to buy machinery to make sewai (vermicelli), chips, pasta and expanded her product line to include 36 more food items.\n\nVaishali’s first mentor was Vidya Khare, who passed away from illness. Vaishali misses her a lot. It was Late Vidya Khare who inspired her to increase the number of food items. She had also advised Vaishali to keep improving the product quality continuously.\n\nHer current mentor is Dr. Som Pandya owns Khadi Gramudyog and a training center. He guides her with workforce management. It is the workforce that plays a vital role in the growth of any business. Human resource management, timely appreciation, and criticism, all form an important part of the lessons she learns diligently from Dr. Pandya. He also supports Vaishali in customer management. With his support Vaishali aims to increase 5 customers every day. To replicate the impact BYST has had on her life, she attends all the events and meetings regularly. She also encourages young women to start their own businesses based on their skill sets and makes them aware about BYST.\n\nProducing 40 kinds of food items, Vaishali today has a turnover of 40 lakhs, with an income of 90k per month. Her product-line includes mainly chivda, chakli, all types of tortillas, pickles, noodles and other homemade eatables. Initially, she would deliver the products herself by going door–to–door to spread the word about her business herself. This way she could maintain a direct relationship with her customers and gained a better understanding of their demands and needs. Now she has an all-women’s team of forty, employed both directly and indirectly. Her employees have been working with her for the past ten years in the district of Wardha. She specifically hired only women due to her strong faith in their skillsets and sincerity. She still does door-to-door selling and now her husband also helps with her unit when she is away on sales calls.\n\nVaishali Gruh Udyog is always looking to increase their repertoire and maintain the highest level of quality in their products. By taking their business online and taking customers needs and requirements into account, they have taken an important step in improving the relationship between the customer and the company. This will also help them further the business. Vaishali employs women from poor families and is looking to hire more as she expands her business to other districts. With the world seeing an increase in demand for homemade products and delivery services, she has smartly decided to do both through her unit. Her main aim remains to make as many women independent as possible. She trains them, helps them realise their potential and own their identities.\n\nWhen COVID-19 struck, no one could predict the length of its stay, but it was clear that the impact would be far-reaching and long-lasting. The lockdown during the early days of the pandemic affected businesses and drove some to closure. Economies suffered worldwide, and India was no different.\n\nNeedless to say, Mrs. Vaishali Patil’s Vaishali Gruh Udyog also took a hit. However, she was quick to regroup and handle the fallout that was caused due to lockdown and the restrictions caused by it. She did face problems of availability of skilled workers, but maintained her relationship with her customers by providing order services both online and offline, and adding new products as per customer requests. She also took short meetings with SHG women online to encourage them during the tough times. She stood by her employees by paying their full salaries and extending her moral support. Additionally, she took care of the health provisions of all her employees. She also donated water purifer/cooler to hospital.\n\nTo remain steadfast and calm in the face of crisis and work towards solutions, to take your responsibilities seriously is the mark of a successful leader. Being flexible in your approach towards work has emerged as an important quality in the times of the pandemic and BYST is proud to work with an intuitive entrepreneur like Mrs. Vaishali Patil. Her outstanding leadership skills have won her the Vijaylakshmidas Award as well. This mother of two is certainly rewriting her stories and the stories of several other women by creating jobs and by simply being an inspiration!\n\nSwapnil Kudale\n\nSwapnil was born to a lower-middle class family, but he was born with dreams that stretched way beyond the limitations set by his socio-economic condition. Being the elder son to his parents, he observed intently as his father operated his own small business out of small piece of land that he had invested in many years ago. The amount of effort his father put in to bring home an income of INR 4.5 lakhs a year, gave him many important life lessons. The fact that his father struggled to make two ends meet, yet never compromised when it came to the education of his sons, made a huge impact on him, even as a child. As a result, he grew up to be grounded, but with his eyes set on greater achievements.\n\nStaying true to his father’s vision, he did not let his financial circumstances affect his education as obtained an Engineering degree from a Governmental Open University. By the time he had become an adult, Swapnil was sure of two things – one, he wanted to become a job creator and not a job seeker; and two, he did not want to run his father’s fabricating business while doing so. The only thing he was unsure of, was what kind of business he wanted to run, or how to go about it.\n\nHe was only eighteen when he spotted a BYST advertisement in a Pune-based newspaper. Though still in school, he was so motivated by his dream of becoming an entrepreneur that he got in touch with BYST. That was 2007. Starting then, he attended every single BYST workshop even through his college and continues to do so till date. He feels every single time he attends a workshop, he gets to learn something new which helps his business knowhow.\n\nPost college, he started working with a radiator manufacturing factory where he took up welding. It was while working here, that he realized he liked this area of work. So, when the factory owner decided to close the business down, Swapnil approached BYST to help him start his own manufacturing unit. BYST connected him to his mentor, Mr. Subhash Shejwal, who is also an engineer by degree, and an established serial entrepreneur with business interests in several sectors, including manufacture of engineering components and service industry.\n\nMr. Shejwal helped Swapnil refine his project idea, connected him to many industries who would require radiators, and guided him at each step. Initially, when Swapnil hesitated as he was unsure about withdrawing a loan for a big amount from the bank to start his manufacturing business, it was Mr. Shejwal who encouraged him to stay confident. BYST’s financial partners helped him with all loan-related paperwork and the loan came through in 2016. In 2017, Swapnil started manufacturing radiators. His thirst for knowledge being unquenchable, Swapnil continues to learn from BYST and his mentor, and has included learning about asset and project planning under Mr. Shejwal’s guidance into his future plans.\n\nWhen Swapnil talks about his mentor, his eyes sparkle. “Without my mentor’s support, it would have been impossible to get a breakthrough in this field as a newcomer. Mr. Sejwal helped me learn how to network, he guided me about proper investments, and taught me how to save effectively. These savings helped me sustain my business during the pandemic,” he says. According to him, while theoretical knowledge is extremely important, it is a different level of advantage having access to a mentor’s guidance on real issues in real time.\n\nContinuous interactions between the two has led Swapnil to develop many processes and innovations in his company.\n\nSky Power Industries, Swapnil’s venture, manufactures radiators for transformers and rectifiers. Radiators are used for cooling down distribution transformers. While traditionally radiator manufacturers weld the radiator fins from inside the pipe, Sky Power welds the fin from outside the pipe. This innovation cools transformers faster, consumes less power as compared to the conventional radiators and takes less space. The product becomes more cost effective without losing its efficacy. These pipes are also easier to repair since they are outside, making the process simpler, less time consuming and cheaper.\n\nPassing this cost advantage to the customer by delivering the best quality at a lowest cost, Swapnil has created a customer-base in Pune, Mumbai, Goa, Telangana, and Karnataka in the past four years. He now has around 70 customers. Since 2017, his turnover has increased from 35 lakhs to over 1.4 crores. Currently, he manufactures two kinds of radiators and aims to start production of the third type from 2022.\n\nIn keeping with the times, he also uses the digital space to his advantage. From searching the internet to identify his clients, to creating a strong web presence with a website and LinkedIn profile, to using WhatsApp and online platforms for promotions, he makes sure he uses the power of digital marketing effectively.\n\nSwapnil knows he has a long way to go. Importantly, the products manufactured by Sky Power Industries contribute to power generation. The market is estimated to grow at the rate of 200% year on year, given the Government of India’s focus on 100% electrification of all villages in India by 2022. Given the lower maintenance costs and lower frequency of breakdowns of their product, Swapnil knows that the government can reduce maintenance costs and expand the electrification coverage within limited resources. The savings in the electricity due to these radiators will also benefit more people due to limited power availability in the country, bridging the urban-rural divide. Not only that, radiators produced by Sky Power contribute to protecting the environment by reducing heat generation, saving power and reducing electricity consumption.\n\nEvery manufacturing business creates four indirect jobs through every direct job, and so, Swapnil’s venture today has created 20 direct and 60 indirect jobs. The next step for his business is to introduce gender-equality by hiring more women employees. His humble background also contributes to his prudence in spending. While he doesn’t cut corners, he does try to maximize the potential of every penny earned and spent in the business. This has helped him scale up his business from a turnover of INR 3.6 million in 2017 to INR 14 million in 2021.\n\nToday Swapnil is turning all his dreams into reality one by one. He bought himself a car, ploughed some profits back to his business, built an industrial shed on the land where his father had set up his fabricating unit. Being self-employed has enhanced his family’s stature and standing in the society. Finally, the family is out of their miseries, living a comfortable life and extremely proud of the toil and hard work Swapnil put in to build a successful business.\n\nRaghu C\n\n“Things work out best for those who make the best of the way things work out,” once said the famous basketball coach, John Wooden. Ragu C, an entrepreneur from Tamil Nadu, India stands testimony to this quote with the way he has led his life. It has not been an easy journey, especially for someone like Ragu who comes from the Scheduled Tribe community, one of the most backward tribal communities in the country. The social background alone created many hindrances for him, added to the fact that his family was never financially well-off. However, with sheer grit and determination, Ragu has been able to turn the tables in life.\n\nEven as a child, he was quite aware of the impact of the socio-economic condition of his family. For his tribal family that practices agriculture, money was scarce. He was also always concerned about his community and their status in the society. Ragu has two siblings and is the only earning member in the family. Once he completed his secondary education, he invested his life into becoming financially independent. Bringing his family out of the misery he grew up in and turning his dreams into reality motivated him to become the first person in the family to move into entrepreneurship.\n\nRagu started his career in 1992 as a lorry cleaner. In 2001, he joined a small manufacturing company called ‘Ganesh Cement Pipes Private Limited’ as a loader. It was here that he started learning about nitty-gritty of the ‘business of cement manufacturing’. While working as a loader, Ragu established contact with a Karur-based firm and started marketing their cement pipes in Chennai. Thus began his journey towards achieving his goals.\n\nIn 2009, Ragu incorporated his firm “Everest Cement Pipes” with an initial investment of INR 20,000. Though he was armed with a few sub-contract orders from the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, he failed to obtain a business loan from any banks. The struggle continued for three long years and finally in 2012 a newly established IOB bank close to his business unit lent him INR 24,000 which he successfully repaid. When Ragu approached them for a second term loan in 2013, the bank suggested he seek assistance from BYST. From BYST Ragu learnt how to maintain all his records properly. Working with him for nearly a year, BYST successfully assisted him to take out a loan of INR 16 lakhs from Indian Overseas Bank, Mudichoor in 2014.\n\nRagu’s mentor Mr. Victor Joseph has been a pillar of support for Ragu right from the beginning. He especially helped him out during the period when the number of business orders Ragu was getting had become difficult for him to handle. His supply chain could not meet the demands of his customers. On Mr. Joseph’s advice, Ragu agreed to experiment with innovation and wanted to invest in mechanising the production process. His research revealed that all units in the market, like Ragu’s, were daily churning out 1000 Cable Turfs manually. He realised that inputs from his local market was not going to be enough for the scale of supply he was seeking. Ragu planned to scale up his production of turfs from 1000 to 30,000 per day. To do this, he travelled to Coimbatore and visited Akshaya Industries, a prominent machinery manufacturer, spent fifty 50 days with their technical team and accomplished in customising a “Cement Turf Manufacturing Machine” that would serve his needs.\n\nToday, ECP is a certified company, and a leading manufacturer and supplier of a broad range of RCC products. They deliver customised designs based on specific customer requirements. With years of experience behind them in manufacturing RCC concrete products, their focus is now on evolving as a quality-centric company and beat their competition. ECP’s current product range includes RCC poles, RCC Tiles, RCC Drain Cover, RCC Tree Guard, RCC Drainage Pipes, RCC Hume Pipes, Cement Pipes, RCC Concrete Pipes, Septic Tank and more. Each product is carefully monitored and goes through a thorough quality control check, to fulfil the requirements of current market specifications. He gets most of his orders from TNEB as a subcontractor.\n\nBut Ragu also has quite a varied customer base, coming from different industries. These include reputed companies like KSA Power Infra, Sterling and Wilson, Lotus Wireless Technology VJN Builders, EK Infra, TJR, PMR Constructions, Marutham Apartments, Amar Prakash Builders, Naveen Construction, Swan Electricals, and more. Today, he even handles international companies based in Korea, like K&K and Kotak Infra.\n\nCombining innovative ideas and perseverance, Ragu has become a successful businessman now. In the last financial year (2020-21) alone, Ragu’s business had a turnover of INR 3.25 crores. His business unit functions in a 90,000 square feet space in Perungalathur, near Chennai. The company owns four commercial vehicles and two four wheelers for logistical purposes.\n\nCurrently, he needs funds to further expand his business and progress to the next level where he wants to create jobs for at least 150 young people in his company and aims to cross a turnover of INR 50 crores. He is now a well-known player in the market with an ever-increasing order volume. Since his repayment record is well-maintained, he is now gearing up to take out a third loan with BYST’s support.\n\nThe pandemic has been a difficult time for businesses, and it has been difficult for Ragu to get payments on time from his vendors. However, Ragu did not let his workers suffer. He was able to get the 10% Corona fund out of the C.C amount of INR 25 lakhs from Indian bank. With this amount, he effectively paid out salaries and managed other business expenses. He has a very strong sense of duty.\n\nThis pushed him to contribute to government-led initiatives and he donated INR 5000 each to the ‘PM Relief Fund’ and ‘CM Relief Fund.’ He considers giving back to the community as one of his primary responsibilities. His tribal background plays a huge role in the way Ragu thinks and acts. He feels a huge responsibility to ensure proper livelihoods for his community. Therefore, from his profits, Ragu donates to the school for deaf & mute on an annual basis. He has also built a community hall and eight toilets for his community members. These are especially to be utilized for educational activities of children of scheduled tribe in the locality. He also plans to help children from his community pursue higher education.\n\nLooking back at his life, Ragu sees how far he has come from owning just a bicycle when he started his career, to owning an Innova and riding a Royal Enfield today. Recently, Ragu also built a house worth INR 67 lakhs for his family. With BYST’s support and his own strong will, he rewrote his fate.\n\nPanchamirtham Elumalai\n\nPanchamirtham Elumalai’s story is one worth telling to every little girl wondering about their future in this world marked with so many gender discrepancies. It is one that speaks of fighting the odds, standing on one’s own feet, and chasing the dream till it becomes a reality. She comes from an agricultural family residing in rural Madhurandhagam in Chengalpattu district. As a young girl, Panchamirtham’s only aim was to be able to complete her education. For her, this meant undertaking a long and risky 7 km journey on foot to attend school every day.\n\nThrough sheer grit and determination, she managed to complete her secondary education, but soon after was married off to a relative, Mr. Elumalai. Post marriage, the couple moved to Chennai where the husband was working in a company that designed tools & dies. The newly married Panchamirtham did not want marriage to stop her from realizing her true potential. For 16 years, she had been nurturing the dream of becoming an entrepreneur. When she learnt that Mr. Elumalai had 16 years of experience in the field of tools and dies, she jumped at the idea and immediately set out to make her dream come true with the help of his experience.\n\nIn 2005, Panchamirtham started her business with an investment of Rs. 50,000. Her first unit “Indo Tools & Dies” was established in Kolathur. She took up a 100 sq ft space on rent. In 2007, she expanded her business unit by taking up a 300 sq ft space for rent in the same area. She now had 12 women employees. In 2012, the company was established as a private limited entity under the name of M/s Indo Tools & Dies Pvt. Ltd. They manufacture the tools and dies required by the industrial sector for electrical & electronic components. A well-known manufacturer and supplier of die moulds etc., they ensure delivering best quality products and service.\n\nWhile building her business, Panchamirtham felt the need to expand her unit and took out a loan from a local finance company at 5% of interest. The high interest hindered the growth of her business. But this amazing and talented young entrepreneur was already dealing with the Indo Japan Company, supplying high quality tools and dies. When Indo Japan company demanded more goods, Panchamirtham felt an immediate need to rectify the situation at hand. But she did not which direction to take and needed able guidance.\n\nThis is when BYST intervened and helped her stabilize her company, while helping it grow as well. The support came not just in form of funds, but also a mentorship that solidified the foundation for her business to flourish. Panchamirtham’s mentor Mr Kunjidhapatham, was a former electrical engineer, and one of the senior mentors of BYST Chennai cluster. He mentored Panchamirtham from the initial stages of her business and continues to stay by her side to witness the growth of the unit into a Private Limited company and beyond. He has been guiding her with regard to sales & marketing tactics, as well as helping her with references in the field of Panchamirtham’s tools & dies. He is also a great source of motivation to Panchamirtham, who is not only a leading women entrepreneur in the field of tools & dies but also envisions to diversify into commercial laundry business in the near future, to keep the funds flowing.\n\nToday, they have dedicated personnel and specified processes for each activity from the quality control department, accounts division, stocks management and production in-charge. For Panchamirtham, her business success is dependent on quality control, and is given utmost importance.\n\nA confident Panchamirtham now plans to expand the range of products, look for worldwide import-export opportunities, and to have a turnover of Rs. 7 crores in 2021-2022.\n\nAll her employees are local people residing within 5 km of radius of the business unit. As a woman entrepreneur herself, Ms. Elumalai focuses on hiring women employees. They form majority of her workforce. Emphatic about the employees’ needs, the company motivates them by offering incentives on target achievement.\n\nAn unfortunate accident at the business unit that caused her husband to injure nine fingers, drove Panchamirtham to ensure maximum workplace safety. She continues to motivate her team to work better by make sure that they are safe and protected. This also increases their productivity.\n\nThough many businesses suffered from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. Elumalai continued to be productive. She kept delivering her usual orders, albeit in a slower pace. But work did not stop.\n\nRight before the lockdown induced by COVID-19 was announced, Panchamirtham had moved her business unit to Tiruvallur from Kolathur. After working out of a rented unit from 2005 to 2020, this newly constructed unit was established in a space purchased and owned by her.\n\nPanchamirtham firmly believes that one’s dreams to flourish cannot be hindered by marriage. She also wanted to prove that married women can achieve whatever they want and become financially independent. Through her journey with BYST, she has not just proven herself as an unstoppable force of nature, but also the fact that any obstacle can be overcome with faith in oneself.\n\nKiranbala Choudhary\n\nKiran Bala Choudhry comes from Ganjam, Odisha. She was born to a well-established family and lived with her parents and younger brother. Her father was a government official, giving them a lifestyle of comfort and happiness. Unfortunately, the happiness was too short-lived for the girl. At the age of nine, Kiran lost her father and the entire responsibility of raising two very young children fell on her mother, now a single parent. To say it was an uphill task would be an understatement.\n\nNine-year-old Kiran became her mother’s ally in raising her younger brother, as it pans out in our country. Though she was always very ambitious and interested in her studies, her brother, being the only male member in the family now, came first. After she cleared her higher secondary examinations, she was informed that only one of the two siblings could attend college. And so, Kiran sacrificed her college education for her brother.\n\nNot just that, as soon as Kiran turned eighteen, her mother forced her into getting married as well. For Kiran, this meant an end for all her dreams and ambitions. But she did not quite give up yet. Her husband was a small businessman and with him, she moved to Bhubaneswar and bore two children. Despite the pressures of domestic life, she kept trying to complete her graduation. But her in-laws were too conservative to let her go through with her plan.\n\nSensing her dejection, her husband extended a supportive arm. He encouraged her to join him in running his small eatery together. Kiran was happy to utilise her time doing something fruitful and accepted the proposal, gaining valuable experience, and developing management skills in the process. Her dreams were making their way back to her, again.\n\nThings took an interesting turn in 2020 when with the onset of the pandemic, her husband’s business collapsed, and it became very difficult for him to manage household expenses. Kiran saw matters spiralling downwards and realised this was her chance to do something. After much discussion and brainstorming, she decided to start a new venture of her own – a facility to manufacture and process snacks.\n\nNot one to waste time, Kiran started knocking on the doors of several banks to avail funds but was unsuccessful. Though she already had some pending working capital at Bank of India, banks were hesitant to give her a loan. They would ask for collaterals and other paperwork which Kiran found difficult to provide. During this process of facing rejection after rejection, one of her friends suddenly informed her about the BYST-FCDO Youth Entrepreneurship Program. BYST provided her with a two-day EDP training programme, post which her loan of Rs. 23 lakhs was processed from the State Bank of India. She used the funds to purchase the pieces of machinery and raw material.\n\nBYST also assigned a mentor to Kiran. Mr. Rajwardhan Dhoul Mahapatra, Kiran’s mentor, became her friend, philosopher, and guide, monitoring her progress and supporting her with expert advice on the production process, loan repayment, subsidies, market analysis etc. He mentored on several things, from the importance of maintaining the quality of her products to fixing the rates of the eatables. He also helped her to confidently address the questions related to the pricing of her products. Kiran expanded her business under the name of ‘Som Veg’ and came up with a complete packaging solution as well.\n\nSom Veg manufactures a range of snacks like, sew bhaji, ghantia, mixture etc. Kiran focuses on maintaining quality and taste for the eatables she manufactures. Currently, she manufactures three varieties of snacks targeted to customers from different segments. They also run a flour mill aided by the Pulverizer (milling machine) that Kiran purchased. The differentiator for Som Veg snacks is the usage of the besan from her own milling machine. This besan is pure unlike the adulterated version used by other products.\n\nShe sells the products from the counter of her hotel. She also supplies to various grocery stores and snacks stores in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. A hardworking entrepreneur, she visited every store personally to get the orders. The attractive packaging she uses also helps appeal to customers. Starting just in April 2021, Kiran is already earning a monthly turnover of INR 3 lakhs today, eyeing a yearly turnover of INR 20 lakhs. Her loan repayments are regular, and her financial records are updated diligently. She is now focused on expanding her business to four districts of Odisha.\n\nWhile it just seems like the little ambitious girl whose dreams were put on the backburner is finally turning her dreams into reality, the reality is different. Kiran is working so hard, not just to fulfil her own dreams, but also to ensure that many more unfulfilled dreams like hers find a way to materialize. She wants to become a job creator for people from marginal backgrounds, especially women. For her, business expansion means the opportunity to create more employment. She has taken up the taks of motivating many young women around her, especially those living in the nearby slums, working as maids, earning paltry amounts in return of their hard work. Kiran wants to create opportunities for them through her business. Just the way BYST showed faith in her abilities and supported her venture, she wants to be able to discover the potential of women around her.\n\n“Our society treats women as the weaker sex, pushing them into the homemaker role. But I want other women to know that its not true. I am an example of that. Though I struggled a lot, I did become an entrepreneur. There may have been other business opportunities for me, but I chose this one to be able to engage more women employees,” she says.\n\nThe hallmark of a progressive society is the way it treats its women, including women entrepreneurs. While a lot has been achieved, instances of patriarchy, discrimination and lack of independence still shackle potential women entrepreneurs in the country.\n\nKiran’s efforts towards her independence and achievement have inspired many. Limited resources and conventional views can make starting up as a woman in small towns in India a tough task, but Kiran never minded these factors as her obstacles. India is brimming with talented women who can contribute a huge amount of wealth to the country’s economy, and empower others along the way, Kiran is one of them and we are proud to have her as our entrepreneur.\n\nTales of Sustainability -- How a small-time tailor from Aurangabad increased his turnover 15 times in 4 years!\n\nRohidas Barsawne was a small-time tailor when he started his business of manufacturing uniforms, for companies, hospitals and schools, in 2015. He borrowed Rs 20,000 from friends and relatives to purchase sewing machineries and hire staff for his new enterprise Tej Garments and Uniforms. At that time, he had just one tailor in his existing unit and a turnover of less than Rs. 1 lakh! Five years later, Rohidas has a turnover of more than Rs 15 lakhs per annum, employs more than 14 professionals and has diversified into making doctors’ caps, face masks and related products. The transformation is a tribute to Rohidas’ tenacity and an archetypical example of what mentoring and access to finance can do to lives of small entrepreneurs. And this is what happened. Around the time he started off in 2015-16, he heard about Bajaj Auto – Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust Mentoring programme from a friend and decided to seek support for mentoring and augmenting his initial financial capital. In September 2016, with BA-BYST help, he received a loan of Rs 2.63 lacs from Bank of Baroda’s CIDCO branch for the purchase of machineries. On the product side, what helped him was his knowledge of the specifications required in production of face masks and other PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) equipment, owing to his association with doctors and hospitals. Hence, he has been able to deliver a massive quantity of these products for these customers, at a time when the demand is at its peak. His knowledge, and keen sense of business strategy got him orders for over 10,000 masks and PPE kits from various clients, including hospitals, social workers, local politicians, local medicals institutions etc. This helped his business stay afloat and helped him pay wages to his employees during this period of great economic uncertainty -- and at a time when numerous businesses are shutting down. To his credit, he has also been able to generate some temporary work-from-home employment for almost 30 local ladies. Add another 10 in-house workers and here you have a person who has managed to not only stay on course but also contribute to social well-being. While Rohidas Barsawne’s story – from numerous such stories coming out of BYST stables -- is the silver lining amidst this pandemic, all is not hunky-dory. He is working with his mentor and other stakeholders to stave off the impending trouble, in the form of raw material shortages, that has the potential to derail his business. The lock down situation, he recognizes, is not ending soon and his raw material stocks of cloth and elastic, initially planned for 21-days, are plummeting. He is not sure how many days he can sustain the production cycle and supply to his customers, without being able to replenish his stocks. With his order books full, the main challenge that he is working on right now, with his mentor Mr Milind Patil, is how to ensure supply of raw material from his vendors, who are not able to function due to the lockdown. He hopes for some positive decisions from the government and local authorities that would help him sustain his production cycle and take his business to newer heights. Conclusion: This situation has given Mr. Rohidas an opportunity to increase his turnover but the shortage in raw material consequences has pulled him back from achieving so.\n\nBharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust joins Youth Business International's Rapid Response Programme, funded by Google.org, to support struggling small businesses during the Covid-19 crisis\n\nThe programme, led by Youth Business International (YBI) and funded by Google.org, will support underserved micro, small and medium businesses to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. New Delhi: The global economy is suffering from an unprecedented shock as a result of COVID-19. With typically tight margins, micro, small and medium businesses are vulnerable to economic downturn. The current pandemic is having a particularly serious impact on business owners and entrepreneurs from underserved communities, including young people (aged 18-35 years), women, and refugees and other migrants. Many are struggling to get through the crisis and need support now. “I run Biotechnology company (Life Science company) named as BioEra Life Sciences Pvt Ltd, that manufactures sophisticated lab equipment. We also research activities related to Life Science, and we are researching on solutions to deal with COVID19. Cash flow of most of the organisations has come to a halt and has left many entrepreneurs mentally disturbed with an increasing fear of uncertainty in mind. With most of the businesses going online, digitisation is going to play a major role in future. If business today had good digital solutions to run their business, the impact could have been less severe. In a nutshell, the need of the hour is replacing social distancing with social networking. The Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) would definitely benefit by making an online presence of their businesses and any such initiative by the govt. or any other agency to uplift the SME’s his highly appreciated.”- said BYST Grampreneur™ Siddharth Salunke from Pune, Maharashtra. The program will include the SMEs that are the backbone of the Indian economy and help in generating further employment. Due to the current lockdown, business and financial cycle of entrepreneurs has come to a standstill, especially the ones that are into manufacturing. Due to low liquidity, the entrepreneurs are unable to pay the salary & wages to their workers. However, such businesses will simply not be able to survive if not rescued - on priority - to pull them out of the current disruption. Globally, financial packages have already been announced by nations in a bid to restore their economies amid the COVID-19 pandemic looming large, across economies. There are several opportunities at a local, regional and global level for Googlers to engage and support SMEs, its members and network. They will be contributing in various ways like Digitalization of advisory and delivery services, coaching MSMEs: through a series of webinars or personalised online coaching to enable remote working for those in quarantine or social isolation; coaching members and YBI members to adapt emergency response support or helpline advisory mechanism. Lakshmi Venkataraman Venkatesan, Founding and Managing Trustee, Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust said, “The outbreak of COVID-19 has deeply affected BYST entrepreneurs and their local communities particularly in India’s rural hinterlands. Given underlying challenges like poor digital connectivity, BYST has been pushing hard to reach out to and mentor over 3500 young entrepreneurs with another 3000 in the pipeline. We are truly thankful to Google.org and Youth Business International for their timely support in helping us establish a helpline and in capacity building our mentors, thereby expanding our reach ten-fold.” The global programme is led by YBI, an experienced network of enterprise support organisations. It will support over 200,000 small and medium business owners across 32 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific to respond to and recover from the impact of COVID-19. Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust has been part of the YBI network since its inception. Anita Tiessen, CEO of Youth Business International, said: “The world is changing dramatically from day to day and I feel deeply for business owners everywhere, especially those running smaller businesses and are from underserved communities, who are often least able to bear the economic shocks of this crisis. In the face of these challenges, I have been incredibly inspired by the quick response of our network to support business owners around the world. YBI, with Google.org’s new funding commitment, will help us sustain and extend this support throughout 2020, ensuring more than 200,000 businesses can get the advice they need right now to navigate this crisis.” Rowan Barnett, Head of Google.org, EMEA & APAC, said: “The coronavirus outbreak is taking a devastating toll on lives and communities, and small businesses are facing unprecedented challenges as they struggle to stay afloat. With this grant to Youth Business International, alongside a series of Google initiatives and products, we hope to help some of the most vulnerable small businesses find a way through the crisis.” For interview requests/ media queries: Write to [email protected] Notes to editors Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST) Inspired by HRH, The Prince of Wales, and founded in 1992, Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust is the first organisation to replicate the Prince’s Trust’s youth entrepreneurship support model globally outside U.K. The programmes include supporting underprivileged young entrepreneurs by supplementing financing based on the requirement assessment done by the mentor selectors, INR 5 lakhs being the present average and with an upper limit of INR 100 lakhs, they are also supported with a host of business related activities such as training, business plan development, monitoring, mentoring and networking.

Today, my family and I run a chain of three restaurants in Pune city. I also run a food processing and packaging unit where I employ 150 workers.But, let me tell you how my journey of entrepreneurship started in the first place… In 1983, I completed my Hotel Management Diploma from the Food Craft Institute, Pune. During my college years, I was always keen to hear and learn from those who were 8-10 years my senior. I closely followed their debates and discussions on new business ideas and how to bring them to fruition. The firm resolve of my seniors to strike out on their own in life left a lasting impression on me. Therefore, it was only natural that three years after graduating college, I decided to take the plunge and launch my first restaurant. While I was busy managing the affairs of my restaurant, I continued to follow new developments in the world of business. I had a keen sense of curiosity about new industries and new markets, a trait that I retain to this day. Over time, I firmed up an internal belief system that the best way to overcome challenges in life, whether personal, professional, or related to one’s community or business ecosystem, is to have a keen sense of purpose and conduct thorough research before embarking on a new venture. In the mid-1990s, I came across BYST activities when they used to organise meetings and get-togethers at my restaurant. I enrolled myself as a mentor with BYST in 1996 because I wanted to share my experience (of running and managing a business) with young entrepreneurs. Over the years, I have been in touch with more than two hundred entrepreneurs. Being an entrepreneur from a rural background, I am able to relate to the challenges my mentees face. One of the main concerns I identified was entrepreneurs giving up on their dreams due to lack of proper guidance. It gives me immense satisfaction that I am able to use the wisdom I gained (while establishing my own business) to nurture my mentees. When my mentees respond to my feedback and implement my suggestions in their businesses, I feel even more committed to being a mentor. I also get to learn from other mentors and my mentees. In 2018 I advised my mentee Swapnil Kudale, Founder, Sky Power Industries to build up an emergency fund. Against his own will, he honoured my advice and started saving a small sum every month. Today he acknowledges that my advice proved very timely and a life saver for his business during the COVID-19 lockdowns. He was not only able to retain his workers and sustain his business, but also able to diversify into new product lines. I try to help every mentee visualise a clear growth trajectory for his/her business. I have been able to help my mentees plan for fast growth through diversification and introduction of new products. When one of my mentees in the paints industry faced the challenge of low sales volumes over a prolonged period, I advised him to start manufacturing and selling distemper paint colours that are cost effective and hence, extremely popular with rural home-owners. Shortly thereafter, my mentee saw a signific"
