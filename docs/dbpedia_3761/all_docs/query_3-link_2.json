        "text": "Starving Salesperson #8 \"Calling on them is a waste of time. We made them mad years ago.\" If you're a sales leader you've heard these words. If you're a good sales leader you've avoided saying them yourself. This excuse or \"objection\" is total BULL$HIT! Unfortunately, it is allowed by too many organizations. It constipates sales efforts and holds valuable prospects in a worthless \"waiting zone.\" In some cases, talented salespeople hold these names as theirs and prevent others from trying their luck while doing nothing themselves to change the dynamic. Once again, BULL$HIT. Years ago I took an assignment as VP of Sales for a great company that was stuck. They were mired in the mud at $12,000,000. As costs rose their margins slipped. They had to grow sales. I‚Äôve shared his story before. The owner asked me, \"where are you going to get new business?\" I responded that I was going to call everyone he had made mad. He laughed and said, \"that's a big list. Good luck.\" I went to reps holding names that fit this dynamic. I insisted on appointments. The reps resisted but the calls did get made. Guess what. Getting angry prospects to see us was easy. You see, angry people want a chance to vent. They want a chance to tell you why they're mad. They want to share their point of view. In every case the former client felt ignored. Whatever they were angered by, they felt their frustration didn't matter. In most cases, they were surprised that ownership hadn't contacted them to find out why they stopped buying. This perceived indifference made them feel like they had no value. Now every failure is different. You can't assume that one size fits all. There isn't a single recipe for making things right. But listening and letting the prospect vent is always good medicine. Pent up frustration gets shared. Tension is relieved. The air in the balloon is released. Once that happens ask if you can earn a chance to repair the damage. Ask if the offended party will work with you to make things better. Ask how you're doing as you go about doing so. I'll be amazed if you hear the word no to any of these questions. We certainly didn't hear the word no on my assignment. We reopened 100% of these relationships. We doubled the size of the business in 5 years and ultimately sold the company to a consolidator. I could give you example after example where a dynamic leader demonstrated that this \"we can't go back to them\" concept is junk. Perhaps I'll do that in another post or in answer to your questions. Just know it's a mistake not to call. So reps and managers, don't hold names in \"we pissed them off\" land. Dial the phone. Ask how you can fix things. There are very valuable names in your dormant client files. These guys were customers once so they saw your value. Go fix it. Gotta go. Spencer has taken up web surfing because he thinks it's easier than calling people. It's taking a bad turn.\n\nYour job as a salesperson is to make your company money in return for a slice of the pie, So if your beliefs around money are holding you back then you have an expensive problem, In fact, 50% of reps said their money beliefs were impacting their ability to close the bigger deals, (That‚Äôs a lot of reps losing a lot of money!), But it‚Äôs not just about the money‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs also about: ‚Üí experiencing peace in what you‚Äôre doing ‚Üí being able to enjoy your money ‚Üí keeping hold of your money You see, it‚Äôs possible to push through your unconscious money beliefs and still hit quota with a huge amount of effort. I‚Äôve worked with clients who‚Äôve earned multiple six figures for many years, The problem? Now in their fifties, they still have nothing to show for it, Why? They never saw themselves as someone with money, And so their subconscious mind helped them get rid of it (Your self-identity will always win in the end!), If you‚Äôre in this camp you have three options available to you: 1. Keep missing quota and get fired. ‚Ü≥ Expensive option. 2. Push through but never reach your full potential nor build real wealth. ‚Ü≥ Expensive option. 3. Change your money beliefs and transform your sales and your life as a result. ‚Ü≥ Not expensive option. If you think option three sounds like a good deal then shoot me a DM üó£Ô∏è I'll share how we can change your money story so you can see your success in sales match your potential üí•\n\nI‚Äôll be honest.. this started as a sales post. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs why it‚Äôs great to work for yourself. I can help you blah blah blah‚Ä¶‚Äù I was about to complain of the pitfalls too (and things that‚Äôve been stressing me out lately too): ‚Ä¢ I work ALL the time ‚Ä¢ I took a pretty big pay cut ‚Ä¢ Revenue responsibility is stressful ‚Ä¢ I am more cautious with money now. But today isn‚Äôt just any other day. Seeing the date reminded me of those poor people who headed to work on a random Tuesday 22 years ago. With things they planned to do next year. Next week. That evening. Heads down, following their routines like they have hundreds of times before. I remember mine: Wake up. Shower. Toss on a suit. Walk east down 48th street. Stop at the same food cart. Grab a coffee and bagel with cream cheese. Enter my building. Elevator to 19. Bang away on Excel and PowerPoint until 11pm. Go home. Do it again the next day. But that next day never came for them. It made me realize how incredibly fortunate I am. To sit where I am now. Bare feet in the cool, wet grass. Staring at the beautiful lake in front of me. The sun rising behind me. It‚Äôll be hot today, so I‚Äôll head in for a quick dip later. And I just booked my ticket to head back to the US for 6 weeks over Thanksgiving. I‚Äôm excited to walk in my childhood home and hug my parents. We always think we have another day. Most of the time ‚Äì we WILL. But one day, we won‚Äôt. And we have no idea when. So ‚Äì what are we missing out on by putting something off? Until tomorrow? Next month? Next year? What are we missing out on by selling our time, and control of our days, to someone else? There are things you want to see, explore, and do with your life. What‚Äôs stopping you from going for it now? So in closing what I intended to be a sales post: It‚Äôs OK if you don‚Äôt work with me, but I urge you‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt wait another day. Go get what you want. __________\n\nI‚Äôve just had one client tell me they do...! Moving swiftly on... How would you feel if your sales team could become 100% more efficient overnight? Seriously...Working a sales pipeline isn‚Äôt easy. You do have to kiss a lot of frogs. If you are paying a team to kiss these frogs...That‚Äôs not going to be cheap. Would it not be better to let someone who costs you virtually nothing to do this kissing for you? If this person is never off sick, never takes a holiday, doesn‚Äôt ask for pay rises and does exactly what you want them to do...Isn‚Äôt that even better? Is it not more efficient and more profitable to just get your sales team closing deals, rather than kissing frogs...? Of course it is. The good news is... We have that frog kisser for you...We call it our AI Prince Charming. He loves kissing frogs, he‚Äôll kiss then 24/7/365. He‚Äôll kiss frogs all day for you and then just send you clients who want to move forward. All your sales team need to do then is close the deal. Is this not a more efficient and more profitable way of working? If you disagree, you need to tell me why! If we gave you our Prince Charming to trial, would that be enough for you to give it a go? Or do you want to carry on kissing frogs? To all those frog kissers out there...We are here to do the dirty work for you! #moresales #norisk #easy #newbusiness\n\nI'm publicly prospecting the biggest guests in sales for 30 Minutes to President's Club... and this is my first monthly roundup. February's Closed Won Guests: üéâ Chris Voss, Author of Never Split The Difference --> the legendary FBI negotiator himself is joining us for a show dropping in May üéâ Matt Dixon, Author of The Challenger Sale --> a live tactic teardown from one of the greatest sales authors of all time üéâ Corporate Bro --> a special on April 1st special that I won't spoil (I was dying on the prep call, this one's gonna be good) Closed Lost (but these folks are still amazing): ‚ùå I finally found Simon Sinek's email, but got a rejection from his EA for now. I'll try again in a few months. ‚ùå Daniel Pink was super nice when I reached out to him. He's working on some big projects and had a really thoughtful \"no\" reply (which I'll use for inspiration on my own \"no\" template) Pipeline üî• I tried to cold call Alex Hormozi -- and after 3 different numbers I got dead lines every time. I made a LinkedIn post sharing what I've learned from him, but this one's back to the drawing board. I'm at a 60% win rate, not bad for some of the best names in sales out there! *** What's next? Nothing. (For 2 weeks.) Because I haven't taken a vacation since I went full-time on 30MPC, so I'm off to Japan for 10 days :) In a few weeks, I'll add a few more people to the pipeline. Realtors with $1B+ in sales, the top 10 insurance agents in the US, and some other huge names I won't spoil. But until then, I'll be fueling up my prospecting gas tank over more ramen and sushi than any reasonable human being should eat ‚úåüèΩ\n\nùêñùê°ùê≤ ùêÅùêöùêù ùêíùêöùê•ùêûùê¨ ùêÖùê®ùê•ùê•ùê®ùê∞-ùêîùê©ùê¨ ùêÄùê´ùêû ùêñùê®ùê´ùê¨ùêû ùêìùê°ùêöùêß ùêçùê® ùêÖùê®ùê•ùê•ùê®ùê∞-ùêîùê©ùê¨ Let me tell you a story about my quest to buy my first car. I finally decided to treat myself and went to my favorite brand‚Äôs dealership. The rep was nice, showed me around, and I left feeling excited. But then, the next morning at 8am, my phone rang. It was the sales rep, eager to follow up... while I was still sleeping! üò¥ Seriously, who calls a potential customer at 8am? Here‚Äôs why bad follow-ups like this are worse than no follow-ups: 1. ùêìùê¢ùê¶ùê¢ùêßùê† ùêàùê¨ ùêÑùêØùêûùê´ùê≤ùê≠ùê°ùê¢ùêßùê† If you call too early or too late, you‚Äôre just annoying people. The 8am call made me reconsider if I even wanted that car. A good follow-up respects the customer‚Äôs time. 2. ùêèùêûùê´ùê¨ùê®ùêßùêöùê• ùêíùê©ùêöùêúùêû ùêåùêöùê≠ùê≠ùêûùê´ùê¨ Constant calls, emails, or messages can make customers feel harassed. If you make them feel like they're being stalked, they'll run faster than a cheetah on Red Bull. 3. ùêàùê≠ ùêíùê°ùê®ùê∞ùê¨ ùêãùêöùêúùê§ ùê®ùêü ùêÄùê∞ùêöùê´ùêûùêßùêûùê¨ùê¨ Calling me at 8am showed the rep didn't care about my schedule. It‚Äôs crucial to ask customers for the best time to follow up. Otherwise, it looks like you don‚Äôt care. 4. ùêåùê¢ùê¨ùê¨ùêûùêù ùêéùê©ùê©ùê®ùê´ùê≠ùêÆùêßùê¢ùê≠ùê¢ùêûùê¨ ùêüùê®ùê´ ùêÜùêûùêßùêÆùê¢ùêßùêû ùêÑùêßùê†ùêöùê†ùêûùê¶ùêûùêßùê≠ Instead of annoying me with a badly timed call, the rep could have sent a friendly email or text later in the day. Bad follow-ups waste the chance to build a real connection. So, here‚Äôs a tip: if you‚Äôre in sales, avoid being like my over-eager car rep. Plan your follow-ups with care, respect personal boundaries, and always aim to add value to the conversation. Otherwise, you might as well not follow up at all. üöóüí®\n\nThought of The Day (02/29): Own It‚Äù I respect people who are proud to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in Sales.‚Äù But, where I lose a little bit of respect is when they feel the need to explain ‚Äúwhy‚Äù or justify the position as ‚Äúhelping people‚Äù or ‚Äúcaring for their clients.‚Äù I have never met a person who is ‚Äúin sales,‚Äù with long-term success, across multiple years and roles, who doesn‚Äôt have a strong moral compass to do the right thing by the person who pays their bills (aka. Clients) so who needs an explanation? It‚Äôs not like you have a lawyer who has to explain they are proud to be a lawyer because‚Ä¶..(So many funny jokes to add here). They just say I am a lawyer. The heart surgeon says, ‚ÄúI am a surgeon.‚Äù (They already command respect with those four words). But they don‚Äôt add, ‚ÄúI fix valves so people don‚Äôt bleed out or die prematurely.‚Äù When you have to explain why you are in sales, for example, it is self-serving or almost an apology, like thinking ‚Äúsales people‚Äù are just a lower class. I spent 2019/2020 figuring out my next career move after a personal challenge and didn‚Äôt really know what to do so I signed up and spent hours driving for Uber/Lyft. I told people, without blinking an eye, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an Uber Driver,‚Äù and I told someone last week, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a DJ.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt tell I people love spinning music and driving complete strangers (I do find more satisfaction doing that than almost anything I have ever done). When asked ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù I would always respond, ‚ÄúBecause I am good at it.‚Äù And, 99% of the time when asked what I do, for the last 27 years, I responded with, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in Sales.‚Äù When asked ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù I would always respond with, ‚ÄúBecause I am good at it.‚Äù When I took a test that told me what I would be good at for a career, it told me I would make a great ‚ÄúButler.‚Äù That was dope!!! Immediately I thought of Robert Guillaume (Benson) and thought, ‚ÄúI like that! He was the coolest!‚Äù And, I would answer if asked what I do, ‚ÄúI am a butler.‚Äù When asked ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù I would probably answer respond with, ‚ÄúBecause I am good at it.‚Äù Own it. I‚Äôm proud of awards for corporate accomplishments. A five-star rating as a driver and the receipts from the liquor sales of the bars I worked as a younger man. I never felt the need to justify any of it.\n\nHow I had an $8,060 sales day with no desk‚Ä¶ I have struggled for so long in the online world or business world with one simple fact That I must BE OR LOOK PERFECT For me to get the results I want‚Ä¶ I must have everything in order I must be in 100% ALIGNMENT 100% OF THE TIME‚Ä¶ There must be NOTHING GOING WRONG IN MY LIFE From a late shipment of my brand-new desk arriving late‚Ä¶ From relationships To stress around money, whether it be small or big To disagreements with people around me That everything all the time must be working out PERFECTLY Or am I not worthy to receive whatever result I am focused on And, of course, this stems from the overachiever archetype that we must win at everything And if we aren‚Äôt winning at everything, then the only other option is we are losing It‚Äôs the black-and-white mentality that we have as overachievers It‚Äôs this or that Who knows, maybe we were born like this? Maybe it‚Äôs the way we were brought up? Or how our brain chooses to perceive and interrupt the world? However, I‚Äôve learned the most powerful experience for us to live our fairytale life is that We must switch from the overachiever mindset of this or that Winning or losing It is happening as part of the plan or NOT AT ALL We must learn to dance on the line of we get to have both We get to have our desk show up late because the Amazon shipment decided this And we still get to have an $8,060 sales day We get to have a disagreement with our Beloved and still have a great day and make money But how do we do this? Well, step one is you want to become aware of just how many of these black-and-white rules you‚Äôve created as an overachiever I can only be an academic, a corporate person, a parent, a spouse, So, I cannot be an artist, an entrepreneur, a creative, a healer, a coach, a lover Because this part of my life ALLOWS ME TO ACHIEVE and validate my achievements through money It doesn‚Äôt allow me to feel my heart and art are worthy to exist and express themselves Because there isn‚Äôt a tangible achievement coming from them! So instead of merging these two worlds You try and keep them as separate as possible So, you must notice how your thoughts entertain ideas like ‚ÄúI work at this type of job, so I cannot talk about this‚Äù I have serious friends, so I cannot make funny, inappropriate jokes about s3xuality I want to make more money, but I‚Äòm fearful others will judge me I don‚Äôt have my perfect desk or clothes SO I CANNOT MAKE THE MONEY I WANT I want to travel the world, but what will my family think if I want to take a solo vacation? I dream of doing this to advance wellness and Consciousness further, BUT HOW WILL THE MONEY COME TO REPLACE MY BORING JOB? And once you notice just how often you have an idea of what you genuinely want to do Continued in comment 1 below\n\nThursday thought: All good things must end. One of my close pals says this and it‚Äôs so true. Frank Sinatra sang in the tune That‚Äôs Life, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre ridin‚Äô high in April, shot down in May‚Ä¶‚Äù Frank is right. In the world of professional selling, you‚Äôre only as good as your last sale, be it monthly or quarterly. While listening to ‚ÄòUnchained‚Äô by Van Halen (not Van Hagar) David Lee Roth sings, ‚Äúchange, ain‚Äôt nothin‚Äô stays the same‚Ä¶‚Äù and that is a constant in the world of sales. The company you work for can be doing great one year then the next, become a stinker along with a crushed stock price. As a past VP of Sales once told me, ‚ÄúNate you‚Äôre just like every other sales exec; you‚Äôre looking to catch the next wave.‚Äù That is so true, especially in technology sales. So if you‚Äôre currently crushing it like Brad Paisley, enjoy it, save every nickel of your commission, and always keep an eye out for plan B-for that inevitable change. Because once you miss your number, the execs come a pointin‚Äô fingers at you asking WTF Nate‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt get caught unprepared if they start squeezing you to the point you feel unloved and need to leave. Until then, keep grinding and making things happen. It‚Äôs the only way. Because the only guarantees in life are death, taxes, and constant change.\n\nWinners Never Quit & Quitters Never Win\" - Vince Lombardi Reminds me of a time in my first sales job. I was 20 years old, college dropout, knew nothing, but thought I did..... Answered an employment ad in the newspaper (dating myself!)...\"Show Safety Films, $500.00 per week, We Will Train To Run Projector\". Sounded good to me! That turned out to be door to door sales of early warning fire detection equipment (heat detectors and smoke detectors). The sales manager, knick named \"Goose\" because a goose had once flown through his windshield, showed me how to knock on doors to set an appointment to drop off a movie on home fire safety and then do a presentation, demo the product and close the sale. I was told that if I set 6 appointments daily, did 3 presentations and asked for the order, I would make a sale everyday. I was sold!! It was a 100% commission job. I didn't even know what commission pay meant. Went two weeks doing exactly as instructed, with no sales. Needless to say, full of fear, $100.00 to my name, thinking this sales thing is not working out. Then I had a gut-check moment. It was a Saturday in the summer of 1995. I had done three presentations with no sales. I was mad, frustrated, ready to go home defeated and probably quit the job. It was 9:00pm, I was ninety miles from home. I had one more prospect I had been chasing all day.....the lady had told me her husband would be home about 10pm and I was welcome to come by at that time. I recall vividly being at a stop sign..........left turn took me home.......right turn to go by the prospect. Because I had been trained by some really sharp sales pros to never quit, I turned right to that appointment. Did the presentation and made my first sale! That was it. That one sale hooked me. I'm proud to say I've now been in sales and sales management for thirty-nine years. What a ride!!!! What a great profession. If I would have turned left that night and quit, I might not have stayed in sales. What's a time you didn't quit and it turned out to be a great event in your life?"
