However, the benefits and efficiencies provided by these GVCs come at the cost of increasing risks. This is largely because the emergence and evolution of GVCs have been enabled by advancements in globalization, complexity, and technology, as well as the development of critical global systems that underpin these industries — such as communication, transportation, financial systems, and others. GVCs are thus only as stable as these underlying global systems upon which they depend, and are vulnerable to potential shocks to these systems. The COVID-19 pandemic and other recent global interruptions in GVCs have demonstrated the importance of applying a systems theory approach, which allows us to identify — and eventually begin managing for — the multidimensional risks that these global industries face. Studying the stability and reliability of these global industries requires not only an understanding of risks within just the GVCs but also an awareness of vulnerabilities in numerous critical underlying systems that form the infrastructure of GVCs and the global economy. As examples, we examine six such underlying systems: health care and public health, supply chain and logistics, technology and cyber, finance, sociopolitical, and the environment. Each of these examples illustrates that disruptions, fragilities, or failures in critical underlying systems can dramatically impact GVCs as a whole and make the geographic regions in which these systems are vulnerable less attractive to industry investment and expansion. Introducing methodologies and concepts from systems theory, we illustrate that these underlying global systems that expose GVCs to vulnerabilities are complex adaptive systems (CAS). As systems of systems composed of CAS, these GVCs consequently also can be modeled as CAS. We argue that not only does this CAS perspective help to mitigate the multilayered GVC risks through better understanding and the application of CAS tools like “adaptive management,” but it also empowers policymakers to better attract GVCs to their borders by prioritizing the creation of more resilient underlying systems.\n\nRisk, resilience, and recalibration in global value chains\n\nMichael Windisch Wan-Hsin Liu Adnan Seric Holger Görg / 7 Jan 2021\n\nhttps://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/risk-resilience-and-recalibration-global-value-chains\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of the global trade network underpinning global value chains. Initial disruptions in the supply chains for key medical goods due to surges in demand and newly erected trade barriers have prompted policymakers around the world to question their country’s reliance on foreign suppliers and international production networks. This column takes a closer look at China’s post-pandemic recovery and argues that its response may hold clues to the future of global value chains.\n\nIssue Brief: Supply Chain Resilience\n\nNovember 2023\n\nThe Whitehouse, Biden Admin.

The emergence of globalised production and distribution systems, which bring together diverse constellations of economic actors through a complex regime of global corporate governance, state regulation and new international divisions of labour, demands corresponding and innovative explanatory models. Global value chains (GVCs) and global production networks (GPNs) have been particularly useful as conceptual frameworks for understanding the global market engagement of firms, regions and nations. This book examines the rise of GVCs and GPNs as dominant features of the international political economy. It brings together leading thinkers in the field and sets out new directions for future scholarship in understanding the contemporary global economic system. In doing so, this book makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the international political economy and the global economic system in the post-Washington Consensus era of contemporary capitalism.\n\nThis book was published as a special issue of the Review of International Political Economy.\n\nResilience in Services Value Chains\n\nSébastien Miroudot | 15 February 2022\n\nDesigning Resilience into Global Supply Chains\n\nAUGUST 03, 2020\n\nBy Ben Aylor, Bitan Datta, Megan DeFauw, Marc Gilbert, Claudio Knizek, and Michael McAdoo\n\nBCG\n\nhttps://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/resilience-in-global-supply-chains\n\nResilience of global supply chains\n\nChallenges and solutions\n\nEU Parliament\n\nEnhancing the resilience of global value chains to climate change: lessons from Covid-19\n\nJodie Keane, Laetitia Pettinotti and Maximiliano Mendez-Parra\n\n24 August 2020\n\nSupply Chain Resilience: Reorchestrating Whole Capability Value Chains\n\nDeloitte\n\nBeth McGrath\n\nBrand Contributor\n\nDeloitte\n\nAbhineet Lekhi\n\nBrand Contributor\n\nDeloitte\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/deloitte/2023/02/02/supply-chain-resilience-reorchestrating-whole-capability-value-chains/\n\nGlobal Value Chain Development Report\n\nBeyond Production\n\nBy: World Trade Organization\n\nPublication Date: November 2021\n\nNumber of Pages: 247\n\nLanguage: English\n\nEbook ISBN: 9789287054302\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.30875/7eb92281-en\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE: THE DANGERS OF ‘PICK N MIX’\n\nBRIEFING PAPER 67 – APRIL 2022\n\nMICHAEL GASIOREK\n\nUK TRADE POLICY OBSERVATORY\n\nSupply Chain Risk Management & Supply Chain Resilience: Is There a Difference?\n\nJun 12, 2023\n\nResilinc Editorial Team\n\nhttps://www.resilinc.com/blog/supply-chain-risk-management-supply-chain-resilience-is-there-a-difference/\n\nAn analysis of the inhibitors of resilience in the global value chains of multinational enterprises\n\nRahul Sindhwani, Abhishek Behl, Vijay Pereira, Yama Temouri, Sushmit Bagchi\n\nManagement Decision\n\nISSN: 0025-1747\n\nArticle publication date: 6 February 2024\n\nhttps://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MD-09-2023-1684/full/html?skipTracking=true\n\nTypes of Supply Chain Risks and Their Resilience\n\nFrom Climate Risk to Resilience: Small business in value chains\n\nInternational Trade Center\n\nhttps://intracen.org/resources/publications/climate-resilience\n\nWhat is a resilient supply chain?\n\nSupply chain resiliency is the ability to respond quickly to operational disruptions through flexible contingency planning and forecasting – from material sourcing to logistics and the final delivery of products and services.\n\nhttps://www.sap.com/uk/products/scm/integrated-business-planning/what-is-a-resilient-supply-chain.html\n\nReshaping the policy debate on the implications of COVID-19 for global supply chains.\n\nMiroudot, S.\n\nJ Int Bus Policy 3, 430–442 (2020).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s42214-020-00074-6\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42214-020-00074-6\n\nThe importance of resilience in global supply chain management\n\nORkestrascs\n\nhttps://www.orkestrascs.com/blogs/the-importance-of-a-resilient-supply-chain\n\nManufacturing Resilience: The US Drive to Reorder Global Supply Chains\n\nNOVEMBER 08 2023 | PAPERS\n\nMARY E.

It provides an overview of the most recent trends in GVCs, assesses the effects of recent trade tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic on GVCs, and illustrates changes in the nature of supply chains. It also analyses the challenges of climate change to GVCs and proposes policy options for enhancing inclusive development through GVC participation.\n\nGVCs continued to expand in 2022, as indicated by the growing share of foreign inputs in exports and the increasing participation rates of economies worldwide. This bodes well for spreading the benefits of trade to more firms, workers and developing economies, the Report finds. However, it also flags increasing risks from the dependence on a small number of economies for certain products and highlights the vulnerability of GVCs to rising trade tensions and global crises.\n\nThe report is a joint publication by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Institute of Developing Economies — Japan External Trade Organization (IDE-JETRO), the Research Institute for Global Value Chains at the University of International Business and Economics (UIBE) Beijing, and the World Trade Organization.\n\nPublished in 2023.\n\nGLOBAL VALUE CHAIN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021\n\nBEYOND PRODUCTION\n\nNOVEMBER 2021\n\nGlobal Value Chain Development Report 2019\n\n: Technological Innovation, Supply Chain Trade, and Workers in a Globalized World\n\nhttps://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/384161555079173489/global-value-chain-development-report-2019-technological-innovation-supply-chain-trade-and-workers-in-a-globalized-world\n\nGlobal Value Chain Development Report 2017\n\nMeasuring and Analyzing the Impact of GVCs on Economic Development\n\nhttps://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/gvcd_report_17_e.htm\n\nGlobal value chains (GVCs) have grown in importance in recent years, helping to integrate developing countries into global trade and to increase productivity. But some countries have benefited more than others. The Global Value Chain Development Report 2017 analyzes new data to help policy makers and others understand global trade’s increasing complexity and to consider policies that can make GVCs more inclusive.\n\nThe report provides an overview of the importance of the GVC phenomenon, drawing on the latest research and statistics to reveal the changing nature of international trade. It analyzes the factors that determine how deeply a country participates in GVCs and how countries can maximize the benefits that GVCs bring.\n\nThe report is co-published by the World Bank, the WTO, the Institute of Developing Economies (IDE-JETRO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Research Center of Global Value Chains at the University of International Business and Economics.\n\nPublished in 2017.\n\nRevisit of AAA Excellence of Global Value Chains: Robustness, Resilience, and Realignment.\n\nCohen, M. A., & Kouvelis, P. (2021).\n\nProduction and Operations Management, 30(3), 633-643. https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13305\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.13305\n\nAbstract\n\nWhat are the attributes of the best‐performing supply chains? According to Lee (2004), the best supply chains are agile, adaptable, and ensure the interests of all participating companies stay aligned, that is, The Triple‐A framework. Fifteen years later, we find global supply chains exposed, with an increasing frequency and alarming severity, to low probability disruptive shocks. We revisit the question of the current attributes of best‐performing supply chains in a highly uncertain and risk fraught world. Using the lessons of the last 20 years, we propose a new framework, the “Triple A & R” framework, as the foundational concept for defining excellence capabilities in global supply chains. Supply chains have to enhance agility with robustness, for real‐time excellent performance across a wide‐range of risk scenarios. Adaptability has to go beyond adjustment to trends and requires the building of resilience to recover from current shocks and proactively mitigate future shocks. We need to rethink and pursue re‐alignment of incentives for a “new normal” with changing consumer preferences, new value propositions and innovative business models. We review relevant literature that supported the implementation of Triple‐A practices in the best chains, and highlight the challenges faced by them in the last 20 years. We offer an array of interesting research directions to flesh out “Triple A & R” concepts and develop practices for its effective implementation.\n\nReferences\n\nBaganha M., Cohen M. A. 1998.
