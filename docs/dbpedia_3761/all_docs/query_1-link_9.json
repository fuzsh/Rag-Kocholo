        "text": "The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) is a specialist social science university, ranking first in London and sixth in the world in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2024: Social Sciences and Management.\n\nWe're a global community of people and ideas in the heart of central London. The league tables agree, and also ranking LSE the top university in London are The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2024, Guardian Best UK Universities Guide 2024 and, for the 13th year running, the Complete University Guide 2025.\n\nLSE's motto \"rerum cognoscere causas\" means \"to know the causes of things\". It was chosen to support the School's founding purpose, \"for the betterment of society\".\n\nOur ambition today is to be the leading social science university with the greatest global impact. Led by our President and Vice Chancellor, our strategy LSE 2030 lays out the guiding principles that will help us achieve our goals and shape the world’s future.\n\nInternational outlook\n\nWe are committed to building a vibrant, equitable and truly inclusive environment for staff and students from all over the world.\n\nWe have partnerships with globally renowned universities spanning Europe, Africa, America and Asia including CIVICA - The European University of Social Sciences.\n\nIn the UK, we are part of the Russell Group, the Aspect social science research commercialisation network, and SHAPE – Social sciences, Humanities and the Arts for People and the Economy.\n\nAn LSE education\n\nWe help students prepare for bright futures in world-changing roles.\n\nA rigourous social science education is designed to stretch students intellectually through specialist undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, executive education, distance learning and summer schools.\n\nLSE students are members of one of the largest economic and social science libraries in the world. Initiatives such as LSE LIFE, the PhD Academy, Careers, Volunteering and Generate provide academic, personal and professional support for students too. The student-led Houghton Street Press is one of many ways LSE students engage with the world.\n\nResearch and society\n\nLSE academics conduct social science research that makes a lasting impact on society. This means students are taught by academics that regularly advise international bodies and governments, and who are also vocal in the media on current news.\n\nThe 2021 Research Excellence Framework, a national evaluation exercise, ranked LSE as a top university for research quality and impact. We're continuously expanding our research horizon to reflect and aid the changing society around us. Our current Understanding Global Politics initiative brings together LSE research to shed light on the topic.\n\nYou can find out more about how LSE research shapes the world through:\n\nReading expert analysis and debate from over 60 LSE blogs\n\nTaking in films and podcasts at the LSE Player\n\nBrowsing the latest LSE research articles at our online magazine Research for the World\n\nAttending one of the most extensive and distinguished university free public lecture and event series in the world and annual LSE Festival\n\nSigning up to one of our LSE newsletters, for the latest research, news and events."
