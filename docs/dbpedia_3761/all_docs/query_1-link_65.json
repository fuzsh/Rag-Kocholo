        "text": "In an ever-changing world, the role and influence of economics has never been more important. From the fragility of global markets, to the impact of immigration, and the organisation of healthcare systems, economics touches on all areas of modern life.\n\nLocated close to the City of London – the world’s leading financial capital - the Department of Economics is a dynamic centre for research and education.\n\nAt undergraduate level we offer students a solid foundation in economics and finance with flexible programmes and a variety of electives.\n\nOur wide range of Master’s courses allow students to tailor their career to their professional interests, with specialisms in economic theory as well as behavioural, business, health and development economics.\n\nThe curriculum is directly informed by research from our world-leading academics, covering subject areas including microeconomic theory, applied microeconomics, macroeconomics, and financial economics.\n\nWe are proud of our engagement with industry and employers, supporting students to develop the skills, knowledge and experience required to forge successful careers after graduation.\n\nFrom summer 2022, the Department forms part of City’s new School of Policy & Global Affairs . This will enable a greater focus on interdisciplinary collaboration in research and education with the Department of International Politics, and the Department of Sociology and Criminology.\n\nThe department offers a range of Economics courses at undergraduate, postgraduate taught and research degree level.\n\nUndergraduate\n\nBSc (Hons) Economics\n\nThis flexible degree will prepare you for the widest range of careers in economics, business and finance.

Free online subscriptions to the Financial Times and The Economist are also available.\n\nExtracurricular Activities\n\nThe Department is a dynamic centre for learning and we seek to engage our students outside of the classroom, as well as in the lecture theatre. To this end, we organise a number of extracurricular activities:\n\nBook Club\n\nTrading Competition\n\nSchumpeter Journal\n\nAmbassador Scheme\n\nThe Department also collaborates with the Economics Society to organise talks, workshops and careers-related events.\n\nThere are a wide range of employment opportunities for economists in economic and management consultancies, multinationals, government agencies and in business and finance, particularly in the City of London.\n\nOur graduates succeed in a highly competitive job market thanks to the experience and skills gained on a professional placement year. Past students have undertaken placements with organisations like the Department for Work and Pensions, GlaxoSmithKline, RBS and HM Treasury.\n\nWe have a dedicated Careers Consultant who, in collaboration with our Employability Lead, organises regular career events during the academic year to help students explore career paths.\n\nWe also have an extensive community of alumni who regularly come to the Department to talk to our students and share their experiences. Our active LinkedIn Group for alumni helps graduates build their networks and they also get free lifetime membership to City's Alumni network.\n\nWhat our graduates are doing now\n\nOperational Governance Analyst, SagePay\n\nSenior Associate, Deloitte\n\nPolicy Advisor, HM Treasury\n\nStrategy and Finance Analyst, The Post Office\n\nAssociate, PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nRisk Consultant, KPMG UK\n\nFinancial Services Tax Associate, Grant Thornton UK\n\nAssistant Economist, Department for Business Innovation and Skills\n\nHedge Fund Accountant, Wells Fargo\n\nHealth Economist, University of Liverpool\n\nInterest rate Trader, Morgan Stanley\n\nHuman rights specialist, Alpha Bank"
