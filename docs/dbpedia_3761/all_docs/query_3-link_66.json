        "text": "This is how I spent the major part of my childhood: lying on my tummy on the floor of my living room, reading the newspaper. I read the newspaper every day. I read it from cover to cover and even gave all the puzzles and crosswords a shot. I even read match reports and scorecards for obscure leagues of obscure sports. The Sharjah Five-a-Side Corporate Football League, for instance. I sucked up all this information, forgot almost all of it, but retained enough to become a pretty good quizzer in school and college.\n\nThis penchant for news has ebbed and flowed over the years. It went away almost completely towards the end of my secondary school life, when entrance exams became an obsession. But came back in full force towards the close of undergraduate college. It always hits a peak when I travel or visit my family in Kerala.\n\nNewspapers are a very perceptible indicator of the joys and tribulations of life in a foreign place. They also make for excellent conversation starters if you are looking to mingle with the locals. Kerala is home. And mingling is not at all a problem. But Malayalam newspapers reach parts of my soul that nothing else can.\n\nThere is something utterly familiar but also completely alien about reading a newspaper in your mother tongue after a long gap away. Like visiting an alma mater for a 15-year reunion and knowing exactly how to get from hostel to mess whilst feeling utterly lost at the same time.\n\nBack home? Back home, these days, I shun the news like the plague. Rarely in my life have I avoided it so thoroughly. Well not all of it. I read a lot of Mint, of course. And all of Mint on Sunday. I am especially fond of our \"non-news\" news. Things like feature articles, reviews and some opinion. Niranjan’s recent book review is a splendid example of the kind of thing that I will always enjoy. That one article has enough ideas to keep me occupied for weeks.\n\nI also follow some niche news topics religiously—technology, European football and some literature review magazines. But the rest of it? I am afraid much of the news presented to us these days is not only unbearable, but also mostly useless.\n\nTake the case of the US presidential elections. This is one of the topics I not only avoid, but take an active interest in filtering out of my life. What I know about the elections is what I inadvertently come across on social media, or on a website while I am browsing towards something else.\n\nThere are many reasons why I do not care for it. First of all it is such a towering heap of human stupidity. A relentless shitstorm of wilful and professional ignorance. When was the last time you read something about the US elections and thought: “Oh that is interesting. I should think more about that...”? (And I am not referring to cyanide.)\n\nSecondly, there is the matter of relevance. I mean, sure, the US is the most powerful country in the world. If the US sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold and has to buy medicines that are only made by an American pharma company. I am aware of all that.\n\nBut look, I have no idea what is going to happen to my life if Hillary or Trump win. I have no idea. I got seriously emotional when Barack Obama won because hey, a black president. What a moment for mankind. To which Obama said: “Who needs mankind, I have drone.” But after that initial exhilaration? How did Obama impact my life? I have no idea. Would my life have been different if Romney or McCain had won? Still, no idea. There are millions of people whose lives WERE directly impacted by Obama’s presidency. I doubt if I am one of those.\n\nThirdly, it is an election in which I cannot vote and am poorly equipped to predict the results of. Trump seems to be what we professional journalists like to call “maha shady”. But then Hillary Clinton gives off a “changing into an alien from the inside out” vibe that used to be popular in bad 1990s sci-fi films. Therefore, my sitting and worrying at home each evening over the plight of the United States is utterly and 100% pointless.\n\nAnd fourthly, what is the point of worrying now? Doesn’t it make a lot more sense to save up on all that “worry-energy” and using it up once the elections are over and we have a POTUS? Isn’t that a far more efficient strategy for worry? You Americans carry and please tell us when you are done?\n\nNow some of you might be thinking: “Boss, then what is the point of most news? Isn’t almost 90% of all news like this? Things that are either out of your control or things that have negligible impact on your life?”\n\nThis is precisely my point. Given that we know this, why not exercise more discretion while consuming news? Especially these days when all news is packaged for maximum emotional response? Hashtag Cyrus slaps Ratan. Hashtag Ratan Hits Back. Hashtag Ratan Installs Anti-Cyrus.\n\nMany years ago I had a friend who refused to consume any news or useless general knowledge. Everyone made fun of him because he was really quite “poorly informed” in that sense. But he always said something in his defence. “My brain is a temple,” he would say. “It is a sacred space. I will only let in genuinely useful and good things into it. Things that make me happy.”\n\nIt is an approach I now realize the value of. For far too many years of my life I spent time consuming information with a passion. Because apparently being “well-informed” was some sort of universal virtue. It really isn’t. Especially when you realize the machinations involved in modern news production.\n\nSo now I am a discerning consumer of all information. I read more books than I do newspapers. I read negligible amounts of opinion and commentary pieces. I heavily prioritize “What Happened” news over “Why It Happened” analysis. (American economists are still debating if the New Deal actually worked or not. Analysis has a very long shelf life.) And my wife has full licence to immediately electrocute me if I am seen reading an open letter of any kind. (Or as Hillary calls it: letter.)\n\nThis is why you often see “Avoid news” among the tips, tricks and life hacks that very productive people share in their interviews or books. Treat the brain like a sacred space with finite capacity for things. Regard the stuff you put in it with deep respect.\n\nSo this weekend, read Mint on Sunday and avoid everything else.\n\nLetter From... is Mint on Sunday’s antidote to boring editor’s columns. Each week, one of our editors—Sidin Vadukut in London and Arun Janardhan in Mumbai—will send dispatches on places, people and institutions that are worth ruminating about on the weekend.\n\nComments are welcome at feedback@livemint.com"
