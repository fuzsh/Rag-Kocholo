        "text": "The General Course is LSE’s study abroad programme. It allows students from overseas universities to spend a full academic year at LSE. We don’t offer any single semester/term options, largely due to the fact that most of our modules span the full year, but also because we feel you need at least a year to get the most out of LSE and London! During your year at LSE you will have access to a full calendar of social events, specially designed and subsidised exclusively for General Course students. LSE is just one of many reasons to choose London, the best student city in the world.\n\nYou will be joining a culturally diverse population of 12,000 students, around 70% of whom join us from outside the UK, representing over 140 countries.\n\nAs a General Course student, you’ll be able to choose a combination of courses from more than 300 available covering the full range of social science subjects. You’ll have access to a range of resources to make the most of your studies, including the world-renowned British Library of Political and Economic Science.\n\nFurthermore, as a fully integrated undergraduate student you will become an LSE alumnus after completing your year of study abroad, which will give you access to a range of benefits and a lifelong association with the School.\n\nWe are confident that your time at LSE will be both enjoyable and rewarding, providing you with knowledge and experience that will prove hugely beneficial in both your future academic and professional careers. If you think you would enjoy an academically rigorous and culturally rich programme, we look forward to receiving your application."
