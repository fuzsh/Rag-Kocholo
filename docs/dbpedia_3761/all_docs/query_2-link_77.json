        "text": "Description\n\nThe General Course at the London School of Economics (LSE) offers you a unique opportunity to experience all that LSE and the great city of London have to offer, whilst undertaking a year of fully integrated undergraduate study at the world's leading institution dedicated to social science. LSE accepts students for the full junior year only (late September to early June). Semester study abroad at LSE is not an option.\n\nTwo-Part Application Process\n\nApplying to a Year or Term Abroad or a Non-Yale Summer Abroad study abroad program is a two-part process. These are separate application processes with individual deadlines and can be done simultaneously.\n\nYou must apply to your intended program for admission by applying online from the programâ€™s website. Select the Program Website button below to be directed to more information.\n\nYou must apply to Yale Study Abroad for approval to study abroad and the ability to transfer the credit back to your Yale degree. The designated list of programs on our website does not constitute pre-approval or automatic approval from Yale. You must apply to our office by the relevant deadline in order to be approved. Select the Apply to Yale Study Abroad button below to be directed to more information.\n\nProgram Website Apply to Yale Study Abroad\n\nNotes\n\nDirect enrollment vs. study abroad provider\n\nYou can choose to either apply directly through the university for admission, or apply through one of the following study abroad providers: Arcadia Global Studies or IFSA.\n\nApplying through a study abroad provider still allows you to directly enroll at the university, but with an additional level of services and support. Because of these additional services, it often costs more to study abroad through a provider than to apply directly through the university. We encourage you to research both options before making a decision. If you have any questions, contact a study abroad adviser."
