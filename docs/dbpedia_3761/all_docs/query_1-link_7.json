With impressive architecture, world-class galleries, and museums, London encourages a truly international approach to intellectual discovery and academic life. In step with a vision to improve society, LSE focuses on social sciences and public policy. One of the foremost social science universities in the world, its faculty and alumni include 16 Nobel Prize winners and 30+ past and present world leaders. LSE faculty are at the forefront of their disciplines with a global reach. Drawn from around the world, they advise governments and public bodies while also producing world-class research. The LSE campus is situated in central London, close to major cultural attractions including the West End, Royal Opera House, British Library, and the British Museum. Looking out over the London skyline, LSE has several rooftop gardens with beehives and a green space perfect for walksâ€”giving the campus a community feel.
