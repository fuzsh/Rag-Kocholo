        "text": "A PhD offers the chance to undertake a substantial piece of supervised work that is worthy of publication and which makes an original contribution to knowledge in a particular field. Research programmes (leading to a PhD) are designed to produce professional social scientists well versed in a range of social science techniques and methods, in addition to having an in-depth knowledge of a particular area. At LSE, you will pursue either an MRes/PhD, which starts with master's level study in your chosen area, including methodology training, or an MPhil/PhD, which follows on from previous master's level study, but may still include some taught elements.\n\nIn preparing your application you might find it useful to look at the following: LSE’s academic departments and potential supervisors; funding for doctoral students; the ESRC Doctoral Training Centre; specialist methodology training; professional development for doctoral students and our events programme.\n\nStudents studying for a PhD are required to carry out research (both from documents and in the field) and collect data from which they must write a thesis of approximately 100,000 words. Students in some departments may be permitted to submit a final thesis by a series of papers, with a linking introduction and conclusion. In addition, all students will normally be required to attend certain taught courses. Although each student's method of research will be different, the amount of time spent on their studies will be broadly equivalent to that required to pursue an undergraduate course or undertake full-time employment – ie in excess of 30 hours per week. The work-load of part-time students would be approximately half that of full-time students.\n\nFind out more about life as a PhD student at LSE by visiting the PhD Academy web pages, where you will find lots of information about the services and opportunities you will have open to you.\n\nDuration of study\n\nThe time taken to complete any research degree depends on your progress and individual needs and you must remain registered with the School until your thesis has been submitted.\n\nMPhil/PhD: You register for the MPhil in the first instance. An assessment of your work, which usually occurs between 12 and 18 months from your start date, will allow us to appraise your aptitude for original research at doctoral level. If you have progressed satisfactorily you will be retroactively upgraded to full PhD status. The total duration of study is a maximum of four years full-time.\n\nMRes/PhD: You register for the MRes, which lasts one or two years full-time, depending on which track you are admitted to. In order to progress to the PhD part of the programme, you must satisfy progression requirements for your department, usually a merit overall and a merit in the dissertation. Registration at PhD level is usually a maximum of four years full-time, meaning the total duration of the MRes/PhD is five or six years.\n\nMRes/MPhil/PhD programmes normally start in late September each year but with the permission of the relevant department you may start in January (Winter Term) or exceptionally in April (Summer Term). This depends on the availability of taught courses that your department and academic supervisor decide that you must take. Most of those courses are held in the Autumn Term, so most research programmes start in September. See When to apply.\n\nLSE’s MPhil/PhD programmes are designed to be followed full time by fully funded students, as experience has shown that this route is the most successful for maintaining momentum to a successful and timely submission of your thesis. We recognise that certain circumstances, for example disability or caring commitments, may necessitate your studying part time. If you wish to be considered for part time study, you should mention this in your personal statement, and discuss it in your interview if you are shortlisted.\n\nTo be eligible for part time study:\n\na) You must meet one of the criteria for part-time study (eg primary care responsibilities or disability),\n\nb) The Department must be in a position to provide training, supervision and support required for a part-time attendance\n\nc) You will still be undertaking study and attendance on campus (this is not a route for distance learning)\n\nd) You must not be subject to external restrictions on part time study for another reason (eg visa or funding).\n\nSupervision\n\nYou will be assigned a lead supervisor (and a second supervisor/adviser) who is a specialist in your chosen research field, though not necessarily in your topic. Lead supervisors guide you through your studies. During your first year you will attend and contribute to departmental research seminars, workshops and research training courses. These are designed to strengthen your methodological skills, language skills or background knowledge of specific topics related to your research.\n\nBy the end of your first year you will be required to present a more detailed project proposal. The proposal, which should illustrate your command of the theoretical and empirical literature related to your topic, will be a clear statement of the theoretical and methodological approach you will take. It will include a draft outline and work plan, which should identify any periods of fieldwork necessary to your research. This should demonstrate the coherence and feasibility of the proposed research and thesis.\n\nStudents are invited to submit applications that complement the academic interests of members of staff at the School. You will find staff areas of research interest on the relevant webpages. You should also consult the information for research students.\n\nOpportunities to study abroad during your MPhil/PhD programme\n\nStudents may have the opportunity to link their LSE research degree with a short period of study at another institution. These arrangements are usually in the form of a Research Exchange Programme with an overseas institution affiliated with the School. Exchanges or other similar opportunities are only available within certain academic departments and students must be registered within the appropriate department in order to be considered for an exchange arrangement.\n\nThese exchanges offer students an opportunity to visit another institution, to benefit from additional research resources (archival and advisory) and to become familiar with the academic culture and professional contacts of another country.\n\nCurrent opportunities include:\n\nPartnership PhD Mobility Bursaries\n\nTen mobility bursaries are on offer each year to visit one of the School's five partner institutions: Columbia University (New York), the National University of Singapore (NUS), Peking University (Beijing), Sciences Po (Paris) or the University of Cape Town. For any one partner institution, up to two bursaries are available for a visit of two to three months. Participants will work informally with an adviser on their PhD thesis, research and/or on related publications and presentations. Participants will also be introduced to the academic culture, professional contacts and employment opportunities of another country/region. Students who have already been upgraded to full doctoral student status are eligible to apply. Calls for applications will be advertised internally at the end of the Winter Term for the following academic year.\n\nOther opportunities\n\nThere are a number of other arrangements in place in academic departments. An authoritative list is currently being compiled and, once available, will be accessible via the Research students page.\n\nVisiting research students\n\nStudents who are currently undertaking research at other institutions may apply to LSE to attend for up to one year as a Visiting Research Student as part of their PhD. Please see the relevant tab on this page.\n\nAs well as the joint and double degree programmes that LSE offers, you may also have the opportunity to link your LSE Master's degree with graduate studies at another institution. These schemes typically involve the studying of two separate, existing programmes, which when combined together, allow the student to obtain both qualifications in a shorter period.\n\nLSE Master's / HEC MBA scheme\n\nThis scheme offers students the opportunity to study an MBA at the HEC School of Management in Paris in the reduced time frame of 12 months (usually 15 months) when combined with any Master's degree at LSE. The programme is designed to train leaders from international careers in both the private and public sectors. It brings together the contemporary subject areas of social sciences and management studies in order to provide participants with a global perspective and the contemporary techniques which will help their organisation to compete effectively and flourish in a complex and ever evolving international setting.\n\nThe application process to each institution and degree is independent. Moreover, acceptance into one institution does not in any way guarantee entry into the other. The scheme allows applicants to study the HEC MBA or LSE Master's in either order. However, applicants can only apply to the second programme once they have commenced studying for the first. For entry to LSE Master's programmes, the standard application process and entry requirements apply. All accepted students will follow a standard Master's programme at LSE and will be awarded the corresponding LSE Master's degree upon successful completion. For information on the HEC MBA, including application details, please visit www.mba.hec.edu.\n\nLSE Master's / Master of International Studies at George Washington University\n\nLSE Master's graduates (who have completed within the last three years) are eligible to study the Master of International Studies (MIS) degree at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs in the shortened time frame of one year (usually two years) after their LSE Master's. The MIS is a unique programme open to students and recent alumni from a select number of institutions around the world, including LSE. Whether your interests are in global trade, the developing world, international public health, security and conflict resolution, or other global and regional issues, the MIS programme prepares students for careers in diplomacy, public service, international and non-governmental organisations. For information, please visit elliott.gwu.edu/international-studies-masters.\n\nCEMS Master's in International Management\n\nLSE students on the 24-month Global Master's in Management programme can apply to do an optional term abroad at a CEMS partner school. CEMS is a global alliance of academic and corporate institutions dedicated to educating and preparing future generations of international business leaders. The CEMS academic and corporate members work collectively to develop knowledge and provide education that is essential in the multilingual, multicultural and interconnected business world. In addition to completion of academic studies on the LSE programme, CEMS students must also participate in further compulsory components, including proficiency in two foreign languages, in order to obtain the Financial Times top-ranked CEMS Master's in International Management (MIM) degree. For more information on the CEMS option, including how to apply, please see the Department of Management.\n\nLSE LLM / JD (Columbia)\n\nThis scheme consists of two years of study on a JD (Juris Doctor) programme at the Columbia University Law School followed by one year of study on the LLM (Master's of Law) at LSE. The exchange scheme is only open to JD (Juris Doctor) students already registered at Columbia. Upon the successful completion of the three years of study, participants will receive a JD from Columbia and an LLM from LSE.\n\nLSE/ Ecole des Ponts ParisTech\n\nLSE students of MSc Quantitative Methods for Risk Management can apply to study for the MSc Management of Extreme Risks and Reinsurance at Ecole des Ponts ParisTech in the shortened time frame of one year after their LSE Master’s. The MSc Management of Extreme Risks and Reinsurance is a unique programme which is jointly organised by Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and Collège des Ingénieurs. It offers students paid placement opportunities with a wide range of industry partners in Europe complemented by short professional courses at the meantime. This link between the two MSc programmes provides students a unique learning experience which combines rigorous academic trainings with professional education, and practical applications in business environment.\n\nMBA exchange term\n\nStudents can apply to spend a term abroad in their second year of the LSE Global Master’s in Management at one of 10 leading partner business schools in the US, Europe or Asia. Students will join an MBA class at their chosen school, and take a choice of optional elective courses offered by the school.\n\nThe exchange term provides an opportunity for students to immerse themselves in an environment that differs from LSE both culturally and academically, by joining a programme that applies a more practice-based approach to learning. The exchange term provides a contrast to the more academically rigorous programme at LSE, and the chance to specialise in international management with a wider breadth of international knowledge and experience. As such, any student who completes the MBA Exchange as part of their degree will have this reflected on their degree certificate, which will state that they completed a course in “Management (Strategy & International Business)”.\n\nExchange partner schools\n\nCornell University - Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management\n\nUniversity of Chicago - Booth School Of Business\n\nUniversity of Texas at Austin - McCombs School of Business\n\nEmory University - Goizueta Business School\n\nUniversity of Michigan - Ross School of Business\n\nYale University - School of Management\n\nDuke University - Fuqua School of Business\n\nDartmouth College - Tuck School of Business\n\nPeking University - Guanghua School of Management\n\nHEC Paris\n\nNorthwestern University - Kellogg School of Management\n\nSelection process and entry requirements\n\nStudents can apply for the MBA exchange term in January of the first year in the LSE GMiM programme, and will be accepted via an interview process assessing the following competencies and aptitudes:\n\nacademic attainment\n\nwork experience (minimum of 12 months)\n\npersonal effectiveness\n\nability to work effectively with other people\n\nability to work with people from other cultures\n\nmotivation to undertake the MBA exchange\n\nNote: applicants are unable to have their exchange term abroad take place in their country of origin.\n\nStudents must have a minimum of 12 months’ previous work experience in order to apply, as they will be joining an MBA classroom.\n\nThis requirement reflects the fact that LSE students participating in an exchange program with a US school will be studying alongside students with substantial work experience and in an environment which encourages very active participation and sharing of this experience. The 12-month work experience should take place during or after university undergraduate study and can consist of either one consecutive year or comprised of an accumulation of work experience or paid internships, each with at least an 8 week duration. Students applying for the MBA exchange must demonstrate to the GMiM programme office that they meet the relevant work experience requirement through a certification process taking place in November of the first year of the GMiM programnme. Once this has been certified, students will be permitted to apply. Applications will be due in mid-January during your first year on the programme. Students who fall short of the 12-month requirement will be permitted to apply for MBA exchange but will only have their applications considered in a second round of allocation once all qualified applicants have been allocated a preferred school.\n\nOver 99 percent of students who choose to apply will be offered a place on the MBA exchange term, and individual support is provided at every stage of the application and interview process to ensure students are fully prepared to meet the requirements."
