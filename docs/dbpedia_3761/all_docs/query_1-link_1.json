        "text": "The University of London’s undergraduate programmes in Economics, Management, Finance and the Social Sciences (EMFSS) – with academic direction from LSE – enable you to earn a prestigious qualification from wherever you are in the world, and gain access to the thought leadership for which LSE is world renowned.\n\nThese BSc programmes offer a world-class, engaging and interdisciplinary learning experience in some of the world’s most important fields. You’ll learn to think critically about real-world issues and develop analytical skills which are sought after by employers worldwide.\n\nAbout the University of London and LSE\n\nFounded in 1836, the University of London is a world leader in higher education, and is one of the largest and most diverse universities in the UK. The University of London was the first university to admit students regardless of their gender, race or religion, the first to admit women to degree programmes and, in 1858, the first to give students the opportunity to study wherever they are, providing access to higher education across the globe. The University now has over 120,000 students in London and a further 50,000 students across 190 countries studying for a University of London degree.\n\nThe University of London is a federal University, consisting of 17 independent member institutions, of which the London School of Economics and Political Science is one. Studying with the University of London and LSE allows you to access a wide range of facilities, services, communities and learning opportunities.\n\nSince 1895, the London School of Economics and Political Science has been pioneering social science research, challenging existing ways of thinking, and seeking to understand the causes of things in order to transform them. LSE is ranked first in the UK and Europe for Social Science research, and second in the world for social science and management studies according to the 2020 QS World University Rankings. LSE develops the ideas and people that shape the world - alumni and former staff include 18 Nobel Prize winners and 37 past or present Heads of State.\n\nRanked as a top university globally for research quality and impact, the University’s world-class faculty are leading experts in the fields of the social sciences, economics and international relations, with their influence extending to governments, non-governmental organisations and businesses in tackling global issues.\n\nHow LSE contributes to EMFSS programmes\n\nAs a member institution of the University of London, LSE provides the academic direction for the EMFSS programmes. This means that LSE is responsible for:\n\nplanning the structure and content of each EMFSS programme\n\ndeveloping and writing the study materials\n\nsetting examination papers and marking the scripts\n\ndetermining the curriculum and progression of students.\n\nThe EMFSS BSc degrees are modelled on undergraduate degrees taught on campus at LSE. Although the study experience is different, the academic rigour, curricula and examinations are closely aligned with those at LSE and assessments are set and marked to the same standard.\n\nA degree from the University of London is recognised around the world, and represents a tremendous personal achievement. On graduation, students will join a diverse, international community of influential University of London alumni, from leaders in business and industry to Nobel Prize winners. EMFSS students are also considered an important part of the LSE community.\n\nFlexible study options designed for you\n\nThe University of London and the LSE have a proud history of welcoming students from around the world. However, we recognise that for some students, relocating to London to complete a degree or diploma can be challenging. The EMFSS programmes allow you to gain a world-class education, wherever you are in the world.\n\nWe have two primary methods of study, depending on how you prefer to learn. You can either enrol on our programmes through a recognised teaching centre that will provide teaching support, face-to-face interactions with peers, and a campus culture. Or, if you desire a more flexible learning experience, a number of our degrees can be completed entirely online, and include a contemporary and engaging mix of independent learning and live, online sessions.\n\nRead more about how you can begin your studies:"
