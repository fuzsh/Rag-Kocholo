        "text": "LSE is an international community, with over 140 nationalities represented amongst its student body. We celebrate this diversity through everything we do.\n\nStudent societies and activities\n\nYour time at LSE is not just about studying. There are plenty of ways to get involved in extracurricular activities. From joining one of over 200 societies, or starting your own society, to volunteering for a local charity, or attending a public lecture by a world-leading figure, there is a lot to choose from.\n\nThe campus\n\nLSE is based on one campus in the centre of London. Despite the busy feel of the surrounding area, many of the streets around campus are pedestrianised, meaning the campus feels like a real community.\n\nLife in London\n\nLondon is an exciting, vibrant and colourful city. It's also an academic city, with more than 400,000 university students. Whatever your interests or appetite you will find something to suit your palate and pocket in this truly international capital. Make the most of career opportunities and social activities, theatre, museums, music and more.\n\nLondon is a great city for students, with plenty of sights, experiences, and opportunities to explore. Contrary to popular belief, London doesn't have to be super expensive: hear about London on a budget.\n\nFor more information about living in London, please request our London Life: Tips for students living in the city e-book.\n\nStudents@LSE Blogs\n\nFollow USA students Adriana, Anne, Anya, Claire, Emma, Grant, Iris, Jeff, Joyce, Lola, Maja and Skye as they blog about their journey at LSE.\n\nSupport during your studies\n\nThere is a wide range of support services and facilities available. You can benefit from academic guidance, language support and personal and professional development. We also provide careers support, pastoral care, counselling and a Disability and Wellbeing service. We encourage you to make the most of these resources to ensure you have the best possible experience during your time at the School.\n\nAccommodation\n\nLSE offers a variety of styles of accommodation with a mix of students; UK and international, men and women. Options include LSE halls of residence, University of London intercollegiate residences and private halls. Or if you're thinking of living in privately rented property, we can also help with finding a place. Find out about accommodation options.\n\nVisas and immigration\n\nIf you think you might need a visa to study at LSE, please check our our visa advice information.\n\nWhat do LSE graduates do?\n\nFind out what our graduates have gone on to do six months and three years after they graduate on LSE Careers. You can search by degree and department and see information on salaries, industries and more.\n\nCareer information by country\n\nLSE has a diverse student body and our graduates work across the globe. According to the most recent graduate destination data, over half of all recent graduates work in the UK, while the rest are spread out across the globe.\n\nUnderstanding the jobs market and recruitment methods used in the country you want to work in is important for a successful job search. Have a look at LSE Careers' country profiles for more information about opportunities and employers in your home country or another country.\n\nSupport for your career\n\nWhether you have a clear idea of what you want to do after your studies or haven’t started thinking about it yet, LSE Careers can help.\n\nWe cater our services to match the LSE student makeup including undergraduates and graduates, UK and international students, and people with previous job experience or looking to change careers. Regardless of where you want to work, we can support you. We also have bespoke services for students with disabilities and PhD students, including dedicated careers consultants.\n\nOur services, events, and resources cover finding part-time work; career planning and deciding on a career; enhancing employability skills; gaining work experience; volunteering; starting a business; researching employers, sectors and roles; strengthening CVs, cover letters, and applications; improving interview and assessment centre technique and more.\n\nOnce registered on campus you can book careers events, including fairs and seminars, and one-to-one appointments to discuss career options and review your applications.\n\nWe welcome applications from all suitably qualified prospective students. We want to recruit students with the very best academic merit, potential and motivation, regardless of their background.\n\nWe review each application carefully, taking into account all of the information provided on your UCAS application form, including:\n\nacademic achievement (including predicted and achieved grades)\n\nsubject combinations\n\npersonal statement\n\nteacher’s reference\n\neducational circumstances\n\nIn terms of academic achievement, our entry requirements vary by programme, and are listed on the individual undergraduate degree programme webpages.\n\nOur entry requirements and usual standard offers for each programme for students applying with GCE A levels and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IB) are listed on these pages. We also consider applications from students with a range of other UK qualifications including BTECs, Foundation Courses and Access to HE Diplomas (see further information on these qualifications) as well as a wide range of international qualifications.\n\nBelow you will find the equivalency of the qualification/s from your country to GCE A levels. If your qualification is not listed, please get in touch with Undergraduate Admissions.\n\nFor more information on the application process please see How to apply.\n\nYou may need to provide evidence of your English language proficiency at some point, but not when you first submit your application.\n\nDo you still have questions? The knowledge base is the quickest way to receive answers to any questions you may have. If your question is not answered by reference to the knowledge base, you can submit an enquiry to Undergraduate Admissions via the knowledge base.\n\nCompetition for places\n\nCompetition for places at the School is high. This means that even if you are predicted or if you achieve the grades that meet our usual standard offer, this will not guarantee you an offer of admission. Usual standard offers are intended only as a guide, and in some cases applicants will be asked for grades which differ from this.\n\nEquivalency of the Advanced Placement (AP) tests with GCE A levels\n\nBelow we have listed our various A level grade requirements and their equivalency in the Advanced Placement (AP) tests. Please note that the US High School Diploma by itself (without AP courses) is not sufficient for entry to LSE.\n\nSubject combinations\n\nAP Seminar and AP Research are excluded and do not count towards our AP requirement.\n\nOnly one of AP Calculus AB or Calculus BC may count towards an offer. For programmes requiring A level Mathematics, only Calculus BC is acceptable.\n\nApplicants should also bear in mind our general preference for a broad mix of traditional academic subjects to be offered.\n\nAP Languages and Culture courses may be excluded where students have significant prior exposure to that language.\n\nAP Cambridge Capstone Program\n\nLSE does not consider this programme as part of its minimum entry requirements for American AP exams.\n\nDeclaration of AP results\n\nApplicants who fail to declare, or provide evidence, of all previous and cancelled AP results may have their application or offer withdrawn at any time. UCAS and LSE require applicants to list all relevant qualifications and results.\n\nThe SAT Reasoning Test (formally called Scholastic Aptitude Tests)\n\nThe SAT Reasoning Test does not form part of any entry requirement for LSE programmes.\n\nThe ACT (American College Testing)\n\nThe ACT does not form part of any entry requirement for LSE programmes.\n\nStudents applying from an American university\n\nStudents applying from American universities should have a minimum GPA above 3.3 and preferably a 3.5 (on a 4.0 scale), or above 4.0 (on a 5.0 scale), or a minimum average of 80 per cent overall. We only accept the first year of a full bachelor’s degree, an associate’s degree is not acceptable for entry.\n\nPlease view information on other accepted international qualifications for alternative options.\n\nIn terms of academic achievement, our entry requirements vary by programme, and are listed on the individual undergraduate degree programme webpages.\n\nWe welcome applications from all suitably qualified prospective students. We want to recruit students with the very best academic merit, potential and motivation, regardless of their background.\n\nWe review each application carefully, taking into account all of the information provided on your application form, including:\n\nacademic achievement (including predicted and achieved grades)\n\nstatement of academic purpose\n\ntwo references\n\nCV\n\nIn terms of academic achievement, our entry requirements vary by programme, and are listed on the individual graduate degree programme webpages.\n\nSee further information on supporting documents\n\nYou may need to provide evidence of your English language proficiency at some point, but not when you first submit your application.\n\nFor more information on the application process please see How to apply.\n\nWe accept a wide range of international qualifications. Below you will find our general minimum requirements for students from your country. If your qualification or country is not listed, please get in touch with Graduate Admissions.\n\nPlease note that requirements listed on these pages are general and some programmes have specific requirements in terms of degree result required and subject background.

Please see the individual graduate degree programme webpages for specific information.\n\nDo you still have questions? The knowledge base is the quickest way to receive answers to any questions you may have.

If the only grading scheme used is a letter-grade system, we would normally require a B+ average.\n\nTo be considered for admission to a taught master’s programme (first-class class equivalent), we would normally require a bachelor's degree with a GPA of 3.7/4, on a 4 point scale, or 3.7/4.3, 11/12 or 90 per cent overall.
