        "text": "For applicants from the UK that are eligible for Home tuition fees, contextual information is used to gain a more complete picture of the educational and individual context of an applicant. This allows our admissions selectors to assess achievement and potential, whilst recognising the challenges an applicant may have faced in their educational or individual circumstances.\n\nWhat contextual information is used?\n\nThe following ten pieces of contextual information, supplied by UCAS will be flagged for the attention of the admissions selector:\n\n1. Time spent in local authority care. This information is self-declared on the UCAS form and verified at a later stage.\n\n2. The performance of the school/college where the applicant took their GCSEs (or equivalent qualification). Specifically, where the school’s or college’s performance is below the national average.\n\n3. The performance of the school/college where the applicant took their A-levels (or equivalent qualification). Specifically, where the school’s or college’s performance is below the national average.\n\n4. The home postcode of the applicant is compared against the POLAR 4 dataset. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) assess how likely young people from different postcodes are to progress to Higher Education. We will flag applicants with postcodes in quintiles 1 and 2 (the 40 per cent least likely to attend university). The Office for Students has a POLAR 4 postcode checker on their website.\n\n5. The home postcode of the applicant is compared against the IMD (Indices of Multiple Deprivation) dataset. We will flag applicants with postcodes in quintiles 1 and 2 (the 40 per cent most deprived areas). The UK Government has this postcode checker for English postcodes on their website. For the IMD classification of Northern Irish postcodes see this postcode checker; for the IMD classification of Scottish postcodes see this postcode checker; and for the IMD classification of Welsh postcodes see this postcode checker.\n\n6.The home postcode of the applicant is compared to CACI’s Acorn dataset. CACI classifies postcodes according to a range of socio-demographic indicators. We will flag applicants with postcodes in Acorn types 40 and above.\n\n7. Participation in an intensive LSE Widening Participation (WP) programme. We will flag applicants who have completed LSE CHOICE, LSE Pathways to Law, LSE Pathways to Banking and Finance, Promoting Potential or the LSE Year 11 Summer School/LSE COMPASS.\n\n8. Participation in any Sutton Trust Pathways programme at any UK university. This includes Pathways to Engineering, Pathways to Medicine, Pathways to Law (in-person or online), Pathways to Banking and Finance (in-person or online), and Pathways to Consulting online.\n\n9. Where a student is known to have been eligible for Free School Meals (FSM) in the previous six years.\n\n10. Other individual circumstances that may have disrupted or adversely affected an applicant’s education and achievement, as outlined in an Extenuating Circumstances Form.\n\nHow is contextual information used?\n\nApplicants who have been flagged for the attention of the admissions selector will receive additional consideration.The selector may use this information in the following ways:\n\n- to make an applicant a standard offer where the applicant’s academic record (eg, GCSEs/AS levels or equivalent) or personal statement may be marginally less competitive than the cohort overall\n\n- to make an applicant a standard offer where the applicant is predicted marginally below the usual entry requirements\n\n- when making confirmation decisions for offer holders that have marginally failed to meet the entry criteria (usually this means one grade below the standard entry requirements).\n\nEligible students (students flagged with a home postcode that is classified as POLAR4 Quintile 1 or IMD Quintile 1, as a care leaver, or a participant in a specified LSE WP programme or a Sutton Trust Pathways programme), may be considered for a contextual offer, where the contextual offer is one or two grades lower than the standard offer for the programme. Any mathematics requirement must still be met.\n\nAll academic departments are participating in the contextual offer scheme.\n\nThe contextual offer grades are listed alongside the standard offer A-level and IB entry requirements on the relevant programme pages.\n\nContextual information is used as part of the holistic admissions assessment and applicants are assessed alongside all other similar applicants, therefore having a contextual flag does not guarantee that an offer will be made.\n\nCambridge Pre-U\n\nLSE considers candidates applying with the Cambridge Pre-U Diploma or one or more principal subjects in combination with A-levels. We consider a full course Cambridge Pre-U Principal Subject to be equivalent to an A-level. Our grade equivalencies are:\n\nLSE A-level equivalent\n\nPre-U grade\n\nn/a\n\nPre-U D1\n\nA-level A*\n\nPre-U D2\n\nA-level A\n\nPre-U D3\n\nA-level B\n\nPre-U M1\n\nThe Global Perspectives and Independent Research Project (GPR) is considered equivalent to an Extended Project and will not form part of any conditional offer.\n\nBTEC\n\nBTEC Level 3 qualifications (BTEC Nationals) are looked at on an individual basis for admission to LSE. Due to the structure and assessment of BTECs, they are not regarded as providing as good a preparation for our degree programmes as more academic qualifications. As BTEC qualifications are typically in non-preferred subjects they may be seen as less competitive for programmes that have a large number of well qualified applicants. Our entry requirements for students sitting the reformed BTEC qualifications (using the RQF specifications) are listed below. We also accept unreformed BTEC qualifications (using the QCF specifications), again on an individual basis. Typically all other entry requirements need to be met, including GCSE English and Mathematics at grade B and any Mathematics and Further Mathematics A-level requirements. You should ask your referee to note any extenuating circumstances that may have impacted upon the choice of courses available to you post-16.\n\nCambridge Technicals\n\nCambridge Technicals\n\nNB D* refers to Distinction*\n\nBTEC and Cambridge Technical Level 3 qualifications (BTEC Nationals) are looked at on an individual basis for admission to LSE.\n\nWelsh Baccalaureate\n\nApplicants taking the Welsh Baccalaureate Advanced Diploma are expected to have studied three subjects to A-level and we would typically make an offer based on three A level grades (excluding the Welsh Baccalaureate qualification). If you have only been able to take two A-levels alongside the Welsh Baccalaureate because of school/college restrictions, we would consider making an offer based on two A-levels and the Welsh Baccalaureate in place of the third A-level. The Welsh Baccalaureate is regarded as a non-preferred subject and we would expect two generally preferred subjects at A-level (see above). Supporting evidence regarding your school's policy on A-levels and the Welsh Baccalaureate would be required and should be provided in the reference.\n\nScottish Highers/Advanced Highers\n\nWe normally expect Advanced Highers in three subjects.\n\nA-level grade\n\nEquivalent in Scottish Advanced Highers\n\nA*AA\n\nA1AA\n\nAAA\n\nAAA\n\nAAB\n\nAAB\n\nWhere A-level Maths is required, we require Advanced Higher Maths and where Further Maths is required we require an additional Advanced Higher in Applied Mathematics (Mathematics of Mechanics or Statistics from 2015).\n\nWhere an applicant is prevented, for reasons outside of their control, from studying more than two Advanced Highers we may consider making an offer on two Advanced Highers plus an additional Higher or Scottish Baccalaureate Interdisciplinary Project studied in S6.\n\nModern Studies is considered a traditional academic/generally preferred subject.\n\nIf an applicant has not taken a National 5 or equivalent qualification in English and/or Maths we would expect to see that subject offered at Higher Level and may require a particular grade.\n\nLSE will accept both Mathematics or Mathematics Life Skills (National 5) for non-quantitative programmes however a minimum of grade B is required.\n\nScottish HNC/HND\n\nThese qualifications will be looked at on a case-by-case basis dependent on the nature of the content covered in the qualification and the desired program of study. A level maths, or equivalent, may also be required.\n\nT-Levels\n\nT-Level qualifications (from relevant subjects only) will be considered on an individual basis. Depending on the entry requirements of the programme applied for it is likely we will only accept students with an overall grading of at least a distinction and in some cases a distinction* may be required. As applicants will be considered on an individual basis, a particular grade level of A*-B in the core component and either merit or distinction in the occupational specialism may be requested.\n\nThe following subjects may be considered on an individual basis:\n\n- Accounting\n\n- Digital Business Services\n\n- Digital Production, Design and Development\n\n- Education and Early Years\n\n- Finance\n\n- Health\n\n- Healthcare Science\n\n- Legal Services\n\n- Management and administration\n\n- Marketing\n\n- Science\n\nThe following subjects are not considered suitable for entry:\n\n- Agriculture, Land Management and Production\n\n- Animal care and Management\n\n- Building Services Engineering for Construction\n\n- Catering\n\n- Craft and Design\n\n- Design and Development for Engineering and Manufacturing\n\n- Design, Surveying and Planning for Construction\n\n- Digital Support Services\n\n- Engineering, Manufacturing, Processing and Control\n\n- Hairdressing, Barbering and Beauty Therapy\n\n- Maintenance, Installation and Repair for Engineering and Manufacturing\n\n- Media, broadcast and production\n\n- Onsite construction\n\nIn addition, any applicant applying to a programme that has a Mathematics requirement will be required, in addition, to have an A-Level Mathematics qualification or equivalent.\n\nAll applicants applying to study the LLB (course code M100) at LSE for entry in 2025 (or deferred entry in 2026) are required to sit the Law National Admissions Test (LNAT). The LNAT is not required for any other programme at LSE.\n\nWhy has LSE introduced the LNAT?\n\nEach cycle LSE receives a very high volume of highly-qualified applicants to study the LLB. The LNAT will provide additional information about applicants’ aptitude for the study of law and is intended to be used alongside existing assessments in order to make fair admissions decisions.\n\nWhat is the LNAT?\n\nThe LNAT is the National Admissions Test for Law and is used by several UK universities as part of their admissions process.\n\nThe LNAT is a 2¼ hour test in two parts: a multiple-choice section based on a passage of text, and a written essay.\n\nIt is designed to test applicants’ aptitude for studying law at university; it does not require any prior knowledge of law. As such candidates do not need any additional coaching to sit the test and we do not endorse or recommend paying third parties offering coaching help or preparatory materials. The LNAT website has official information and guidance on how to prepare for the test, including sample papers.\n\nWe strongly recommend visiting the LNAT website before you make your application for detailed information about the test. www.lnat.ac.uk.\n\nWhen and where do I take the test?\n\nFor entry in September 2025 (or deferred entry in September 2026) the LNAT can be taken between 1 September 2024 and 31 December 2024. Registration and booking to sit the LNAT test for September 2025 entry opens on 1 August 2024.\n\nYou may submit your application to LSE through UCAS before or after you take the test, however to guarantee fair and equal consideration of all applications you must sit your LNAT test by 31 December 2024. Please ensure that you select LSE when you register your LNAT account so that we are able to retrieve your LNAT result in a timely manner.\n\nYou may only sit the test once per application cycle. Test results cannot be carried over to the next application cycle if you reapply.\n\nThe test is administered by Pearson VUE and test centres are available throughout the UK and overseas. You must register with Pearson VUE on the LNAT website to book your test. For further details, see www.lnat.ac.uk.\n\nWhat is the cost of taking the test?\n\nThe cost for candidates to take the test can be found on the LNAT website. UK/EU students entitled to certain state benefits can apply for an LNAT bursary. For more information and to apply for a LNAT bursary see http://www.lnat.ac.uk/registration/paying-for-your-test/\n\nHow will LSE use the LNAT in admission decisions?\n\nAt present, we will only use the multiple-choice score in the assessment of applicants; for most applicants, the essay will not be considered. However, we reserve the right to assess the essay for all applicants including those taking non-traditional qualifications or less well-known qualifications (see section on UGAA).\n\nThere is no set minimum score in the multiple-choice section that applicants are expected to achieve in order to be successful, instead the score may be used to help distinguish between similarly qualified applicants.The multiple choice score will form part of our holistic assessment of applicants and will be used alongside all other information on the UCAS form, including academic record, contextual information, the reference and personal statement.\n\nCan I be considered for entry to the LLB at LSE if I have not taken the LNAT?\n\nNo, all applicants applying to the LLB programme are required to sit the LNAT; we will only consider applicants who have sat the LNAT by 31 December 2024.\n\nIn extreme circumstances an applicant may be allowed an exemption from the test, for example if there is no test centre in your country of residence or access to the test centre is disrupted by civil unrest or natural disaster. Exemptions are rare and considered on a case by case basis by each individual university.\n\nIf I take the LNAT test do I need to sit the UGAA?\n\nSome applicants taking non-traditional qualifications or less well-known qualifications may be required to sit the Undergraduate Admissions Assessment (UGAA) as part of their application to LSE. The UGAA is an assessment administered by LSE that assesses applicants’ English and Mathematics ability. For more information about the UGAA including a list of qualifications requiring the UGAA please see the UGAA pages.\n\nApplicants to LSE’s LLB programme are exempt from sitting the UGAA. Instead, the essay section of the LNAT will be used as part of our assessment.\n\nIf you are also applying to other LSE programmes in addition to the LLB you may still be required to sit the UGAA, particularly if the programme has a mathematics entry requirement. On making your application you will be notified by email if you may be required to take the UGAA.\n\nAccess to Higher Education Diploma\n\nThe Access to HE Diploma is considered on a case-by-case basis for direct entry. Some applicants may be invited to the Undergraduate Admissions Assessment (UGAA) at the Admissions Selector’s discretion.\n\nIt is useful for the selectors to have information regarding your performance in the Diploma so far. Applicants may consider submitting their application later in the UCAS cycle, when more information is available; equal consideration is given to all applications received before the UCAS January deadline.\n\nIt is also useful to know the exact name of your qualification and which modules you are taking at Level 3. The content of your qualification must be a good fit for the programme at the LSE. Please also make sure you list the awarding body (it needs to be QAA-recognised); if you are unsure about this please check with your college. If you’re unsure whether we would consider your Access to HE qualification for a particular programme, then please contact us.\n\nFor programmes that require A level Mathematics, you will need A*/ A in A level Mathematics (please check programme pages for specific entry requirements) in addition to your Access to HE Diploma, or your Access to HE Diploma covers content equivalent to A level Mathematics and you will need to achieve Distinction in all your Maths credits. Information on the content of A level Mathematics can be found here.\n\nAll applicants should complete their Diploma with 45 credits at Level 3. Grade requirements depend on the degree programme applied for, see below:\n\nMarks in specific units relating to the degree programme applied for may be required.\n\nFoundation Courses\n\nWe consider applications from students who are able to complete a foundation course, however not all foundation courses are acceptable for all degree programmes. In previous years we have received applications from students studying the foundation courses at institutions such as the University of London International programme, University College London, Kings College London and the University of Warwick. LSE will only consider International Foundation Programmes delivered by UK institutions.\n\nApplicants who are interested in the following programmes, must cover the content of the A Level Mathematics syllabus:\n\nAccounting and Finance (NN34)\n\nActuarial Science (N321)\n\nData Science (N3UD)\n\nEconomics (L101)\n\nEconometrics and Mathematical Economics (L140)\n\nEconomics with Economic History (L1V3)\n\nEconomic History with Economics (V3L1)\n\nEconomics and Economic History (VL31)\n\nEnvironmental Policy with Economics (F9L1)\n\nFinance (N300)\n\nFinancial Mathematics and Statistics (GN13)\n\nGeography with Economics (L7L1)\n\nInternational Social and Public Policy and Economics (LLK1)\n\nManagement (N200)\n\nMathematics and Economics (GL11)\n\nMathematics with Economics (G1L1)\n\nMathematics, Statistics and Business (G0N0)\n\nPhilosophy and Economics (LV15)\n\nPhilosophy, Politics and Economics (L0V0)\n\nPolitics and Economics (LL12)\n\nInformation on the content of A level Mathematics can be found here. Following submission of your application, applicants on foundation courses will be required to verify and provide details of their foundation course content.\n\nWe assess Foundation Course students alongside other applicants using the full range of information presented on the UCAS application. Those demonstrating potential may be asked to sit the School’s Undergraduate Admissions Assessment (UGAA). Final admissions decisions are based on performance in the UGAA and information on the UCAS form."
