        "text": "The 4-year programme in PPE offers rigorous training in all 3 disciplines, as well as innovative interdisciplinary teaching and study.\n\nEconomics programs at LSE aim to provide students with a thorough grounding in the analytical methods of economics and to develop their skills in applying these methods to a diverse range of problems.\n\nLSE's Law degree emphasises an understanding of law in context. Students develop a broad outlook on legal issues, to gain an understanding of the functions of law and of the legal system.\n\nThis degree focuses on the spatial dimensions of economic, social and environmental processes. It produces highly trained geographers, skilled in economic, social and environmental geography.\n\nThis degree combining these 2 strongly-related disciplines, gives students the opportunity to study both economics and mathematics in depth and to understand the connections between the 2 subjects.\n\nThe LSE Management degree is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills to succeed as the managers of tomorrow in business, government and social enterprises around the world."
