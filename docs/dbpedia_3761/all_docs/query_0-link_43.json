YPO has pulled off an amazing event, with a well-curated itinerary but the personal connections forged were unparalleled. And The Highlight? The session with Rishad Premji, the current Executive Chairman of Wipro. It was truly enriching. There's something exceptional about listening to the insights of fellow accomplished personalities. You don’t only learn what they say, but also perceive how they think and approach their work and life. I saw Rishad in a new light altogether! And have to say, he inherits immense depth and humility in his thoughts from his father, Mr. Azim Premji. Have to say, his session was a new worldview about the 3 aspects of an enterprise– leadership, management, and ownership. Rishad's belief in being absolutely true and honest with his leaders, empowering them with authority to lead from the forefront, is rare. People often miss on this perspective. If leaders feel themselves as an integral part of the organization, the roots of success deepen, and the company flourishes as a united force. One must think broad and add value at the enterprise level rather investing their time in micro-management- an important understanding for today's Chairman’s and MD’s. Gratitude to YPO Punjab and Bangalore YPO Gold Chapters for uniting exceptional leaders on one platform. I am honoured to have shared insights and experiences with them. #entrepreneurship #life #leadership #management"
