As a global centre for business, culture and government, our location places our staff and students on the doorstep of the latest developments in business and policy worldwide.\n\nBuilding and facilities\n\nWe are located in the Marshall Building, a landmark new facility on LSE's campus named in honour of Paul Marshall’s transformational gift. The award-winning, multipurpose building establishes the presence of LSE in one of London's most recognisable and largest garden squares. The building's opening in 2022 on Lincoln’s Inn Fields is an illustration of LSE's ambition to develop a world-class estate and a university quarter of London.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability\n\nAs part of the Department of Management’s commitment to environmental sustainability, we participate in the Green Impact scheme for UK universities. LSE has the longest-running Green Impact Programme in the world.\n\nIn 2023, the Department of Management achieved a Platinum Award in the annual Green Impact Sustainability Programme, the highest award level possible."
