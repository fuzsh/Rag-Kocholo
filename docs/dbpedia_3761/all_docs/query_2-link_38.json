        "text": "You can choose from a wide range of courses across seven subject areas and three levels. The faculty teaching on the courses are actively involved in research, with many having connections that go beyond the university, influencing government policy and the strategies of the world’s top companies. A high level of engagement will be essential during your time at Summer School and in three weeks, you will receive 54 hours of teaching time; 36 hours of lectures and 18 hours of tutorial classes, which are usually no larger than 20 students. You will also be expected to spend two to three hours per day in self-guided study.\n\nAlongside your courses, we offer a wide range of free and ticketed events. Our world-class social programme will be your starting point to making friends and discovering London and is a huge part of the Summer School experience. From day trips to Oxford and Cambridge, and guided walking tours in London to musical trips and parties there is something for everyone.\n\nSpark, our professional skills programme, offers exceptional extracurricular activities to enhance your professional development, career prospects, and academic growth. From bootcamps and panels to pitches and workshops, Spark gives you the opportunity to enhance your professional skills and prepares you for today’s rapidly developing workplace.\n\nStudents can only take 1 course (3 credits) each session. To take 6 or 9 credits you must stay for 2 or 3 sessions. Although final exams are not mandatory at LSE, Rutgers students must take the exams to get a grade.\n\nClick here to learn what courses will be offered in the summer. If applying for a 200 or 300-level course, make sure to check the prerequisites. There are typically one or two prerequisites per course, which are listed on the individual course pages.\n\nFor more information about the Summer School learning experience click here. You can also read the FAQ's.\n\nCheck out the LSE Summer School 2024 Brochure.\n\nFor information about Study Abroad credit transfer, registration, and transcripts please visit the Academics section of our website.\n\n6 LSE courses have been course mapped to Public Health and Public Policy major elective credits. Search our database for more information.\n\n15 LSE courses have been course mapped to Economics credits. Please check our database for more information. Due to the rigor of LSE courses, students who want to take Economics courses there are advised to consult with the Economics Undergraduate Director (https://economics.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/about-us) if you have concerns about the courses fitting into your degree plan.\n\nAccommodation is NOT included in the program price. We recommend that students review the different dormitories available for LSE summer school as they vary in price and distance from the LSE buildings.\n\nClick here to visit LSE's Housing Page.\n\nStudents will be asked to reserve their accommodation and pay with a credit card after receiving formal acceptance from LSE Summer school. Since the housing cost is not included in your tuition or your Rutgers term bill you will have to select your preference and pay. Should you withdraw from the program, please check the LSE refund policy for housing. as of Jan 2024, it states that students will receive 100% refund if they withdraw at least 21 days prior to the program start date.\n\nThere are several options for housing. Our recommendation is for students to select Passfield Hall, single basic rooms with shared bathrooms. All rooms at Passfield Hall have their own washbasin, desk, lamp, and wardrobe. Rooms are spread over three floors of which the ground, first, and second floors are accessible by lift. There's a shared kitchen area with microwave, toaster, kettle, and basic cooking utensils. Rooms serviced weekly; shared bathrooms cleaned daily; linen and towels provided. Self-service laundry is available. Free Wi-Fi included. Passfield Hall is located in quiet Bloomsbury but close to the bustling West End. The British Museum and the British Library are close by. You can walk to campus (approximately 20 mins) or take a bus. A full English/vegetarian breakfast included is included daily in the Hall. The rest of meals will be on your own.\n\nStudents with disabilities, please email the program advisor so we can assist you."
