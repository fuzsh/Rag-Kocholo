        "text": "To view available courses at LSE, visit the LSE online course catalog.\n\nWhen choosing your department of study and courses, please consider the following:\n\nStudents who are admitted into the economics department are required to take at least two courses in that department. All other departments at LSE require students to take at least one course in their home department.\n\nQualitative departments at LSE require students to have at least a 3.3 GPA.\n\nQuantitative departments at LSE require students to have at least a 3.5 GPA.\n\nStudents applying to the economics department should already have completed three to four economics courses, including microeconomics and macroeconomics. Students should have also completed two to three math and/or statistic courses.\n\nAt LSE, a full course load consists of year-long courses that are 4 full units total, equaling 32 U.S. semester credit hours per year.\n\nCHART Your Course\n\nFind the classes you need fast with CHART. Our easy-to-use tool shows you classes recently taken by IFSA students\n\nLab & Field Trip Fees\n\nPlease review syllabi and course materials when registering for direct-enroll classes. Certain classes may have a one-off lab or field trip fee disclosed in the syllabus or during the first meeting of the class. These fees are not included in your IFSA program fee. You will be responsible for these fees, whether they are billed and paid by IFSA or billed to you.\n\nGPA REQUIREMENTS\n\nQualitative departments at LSE require students to have at least a 3.3 GPA.\n\nQuantitative departments at LSE require students to have at least a 3.5 GPA.\n\nCLASSES\n\nIn selecting your classes, you should be aware of any prerequisites in order to be eligible to enroll. In addition, because of the tightly constrained nature of degree regulations at LSE, many 300-level classes have “unspoken” or “assumed” prerequisites where the material covered in 200-level classes is simply taken as a “given” starting point for the 300-level class. This means that general course students predominantly take 200-level classes, and it is not recommended students take more than one or two 300-level classes.\n\n100-level courses are introductory classes suitable for students with no previous undergraduate study in the subject. These are typically taken by LSE students in their first year of study.\n\n200-level courses are intermediate classes broadly equivalent to junior year classes in the U.S. These are typically taken by LSE students in their second and final years.\n\n300-level courses are advanced classes equivalent to senior year or master’s courses in the U.S. These are typically taken by LSE students in their final year. Please note that LSE will not admit visiting students into 300-level classes without extensive background in the subject.\n\nECONOMICS DEPARTMENT\n\nStudents who are admitted into the Economics Department are required to take at least two classes in that department. All other departments at LSE require students to take at least one class in their home department.\n\nStudents applying to the economics department should already have completed three to four economics classes, including microeconomics and macroeconomics. Students should have also completed two to three math and/or statistic classes.\n\nAPPLICATION REQUIREMENTS\n\nEligibility\n\nYou must be at least 18 years of age. Students under 18 may be accepted on a case-by-case basis.\n\nYou must be currently attending or recently graduated from a U.S. or Canadian community college, technical college, two-year college, four-year college, or four-year university.\n\nYou must have completed at least two (2) full-time years of study at their home institution before the beginning of the term.\n\nRecommendation Letters\n\nYour application to this program will require two (2) academic letters of recommendation.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nUpon completion of your program, IFSA will send an official Butler University transcript to your home university with your coursework converted to the U.S. semester credit hour system. You will also have access to an unofficial transcript in your IFSA Student Portal. The transcript reflects classes taken, credits attempted, and grades earned during your term abroad. This service is included in your study abroad program at no additional cost. See our Transcripts page for more information."
