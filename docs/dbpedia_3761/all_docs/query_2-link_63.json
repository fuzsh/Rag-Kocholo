        "text": "The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) is a renowned public research university in London, England. It gained the authority to award its own degrees in 2008 and became an independent university within the University of London in 2022.\n\nPart of the prestigious Russell Group, LSE is often considered part of the UK’s “golden triangle” of research universities. It’s also part of the CIVICA network, focusing on social sciences research. LSE has produced notable alumni and faculty, including heads of state, Nobel laureates, and billionaires.\n\nThe London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) was founded in 1895 as a response to the pressing need for social and economic research and education. Established by Fabian Society members Sidney Webb, Beatrice Webb, Graham Wallas, and George Bernard Shaw, LSE has since grown into a globally renowned institution known for its commitment to exploring and understanding complex societal issues."
