        "text": "Courses and credit\n\nRequirements While Abroad\n\nTo successfully complete this program:\n\nTake a full-time course of study: Four year-long courses (or an equivalent combination of term and year-long courses) for a total of 48 quarter/32 semester UC units.\n\nYou may take up to one-third (33%) of your total unit load on a pass/no pass basis.\n\nCurrent Program Courses\n\nAs a General Course student, you are assigned to one of the academic departments at LSE:\n\nAccounting\n\nAnthropology\n\nData Science\n\nEconomics\n\nEconomic History\n\nEurope\n\nFinance\n\nGovernment\n\nGeography and Environment\n\nInternational History\n\nInternational Relations\n\nLaw\n\nLanguage Centre\n\nMathematics\n\nManagement\n\nPhilosophy, Logic & Scientific Method\n\nPsychological and Behavioral Science\n\nSocial Policy\n\nSociology\n\nStatistics\n\nWhile you are assigned to a particular department, you may study any combination of undergraduate courses across LSE academic departments. Your LSE department does not need to reflect your UC major.\n\nAcademic culture\n\nThere is much that you will find unfamiliar in the British academic system. The pace and the amount of direction you will receive will be different. Rather than receiving a syllabus detailing what to read for each class, expect to simply receive a long reading list. This list will constitute the material of the course and you will likely need to find your own way through the reading. Tutors and lecturers may give some guidance about what will be covered in a certain class meeting, but they may also assume that you are familiar with the works on the list. It helps to ask questions about reading, background knowledge, and the like.\n\nFaculty members, most often called lecturers (professor is a rare title held only by the head of a department or the holder of a chair), can frequently be found in their offices, but they are not generally required to hold specific office hours. Like their UC counterparts, some are readily available, some elusive.\n\nYou will have to adapt to the relative infrequency of class meetings. Classes typically meet once a week. Although you will spend less time in class, this does not mean less work. You will be expected to learn more independently. Since most classes meet infrequently, each class meeting is extremely important; come to class prepared and expect to participate when appropriate.\n\nGrades\n\nYou will earn direct UC credit and grades for all coursework. Grades are typically available late July or early August.\n\nYour final grade will heavily and sometimes fully depend on the final exam. UC policy does not allow UCEAP participants to retake exams (called re-sits) and exam dates aren't flexible.\n\nIf you intend to put yourself on your campus degree list for graduation while on UCEAP, consult your campus advisors before departure about possible delays in the degree verification process."
