        "text": "LSE’s academics are at the cutting-edge of the social sciences, influencing opinion and helping shape society.\n\nWhat is unique about this program?\n\nThe General Course at the LSE allows students from overseas universities to spend a full academic year at LSE from late September through to early June. They do not offer any single semester/term options, largely due to the fact that most of our modules span the full year, but also because the institution believes you need at least a year to get the most out of LSE and London!\n\nAs a General Course student, you’ll be able to study any combination of more than 300 available courses covering the full range of social science subjects, and you will be fully integrated as an undergraduate student at the world's leading dedicated social science institution. The LSE offers courses in the following subjects to General Course program participants:\n\nAccounting | Anthropology | Data Science | Economics | Economic History | Europe | Finance | Government | Geography & Environment | International History | International Relations | Law | Language Centre | Mathematics | Management | Philosophy, Logic & Scientific Method | Psychological and Behavioural Science | Social Policy | Sociology | Statistics\n\nWhat is unique about London?\n\nLondon, as a major center of the cultural, social, diplomatic, financial and intellectual life of the country, is an attractive and popular city for overseas students, combining important aspects of British culture and a cosmopolitan atmosphere not found in any other city in the UK.\n\nHow do I get more information about the LSE?\n\nBrowse through course options and information\n\nRead up on the LSE's optional internship opportunities\n\nInformation and next steps for accepted students\n\nMore information about London life\n\nContact the LSE's study abroad team any time for questions about the application and admission process\n\nAcademic Calendar\n\nAcademic year: mid-July - late-June\n\nFor specific dates, refer to the LSE's Academic Calendar\n\nThings to Consider Before Applying\n\nReview the information on the Education Abroad Office’s Get Started page for important considerations on academics and finances, and a guide to next steps.\n\nConnect with a potential reference as the external application requires two academic references.\n\nStill have questions?
