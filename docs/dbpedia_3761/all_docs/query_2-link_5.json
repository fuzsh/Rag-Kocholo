        "text": "London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), institution of higher learning in the City of Westminster, London, England. It is one of the world’s leading institutions devoted to the social sciences. A pioneer institution in the study of sociology and international relations, it offers bachelor’s, master’s, and doctorate degree programs. It administers several centres for research in economics, human rights, diplomacy, finance, and health and social services, as well as regional centres on Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Total full-time enrollment is more than 10,000; about half of its students are postgraduates.\n\nThe London School of Economics was cofounded in 1895 by Sidney and Beatrice Webb, the former a trustee of the will of Henry Hunt Hutchinson, who wanted the residue of his estate to be spent on socially constructive purposes. George Bernard Shaw was also important in the founding of the school, which became a college of the University of London in 1900. Although Hutchinson, the Webbs, Shaw, and other cofounders were dedicated Fabians, the Webbs established the principle that the school would offer knowledge and interpretation without dogma. Thus, the influential conservative Friedrich von Hayek was among its faculty members who have won Nobel Prizes in economics. Foreign students have long constituted a large proportion of LSE’s student body; in the 2010s, more than two-thirds of its students came from overseas. Among former LSE students are several past or present heads of state, including presidents and prime ministers."
