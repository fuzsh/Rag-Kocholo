Please follow the application instructions found here.\n\nScholarships are available for this abroadSelect program! Contact Hillary Koller, Director, Pitt Global Experiences Office with questions.\n\nLondon School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) will give a you the opportunity to study at one of the most prestigious departments of Economics in the United Kingdom through their General Course option. In late September, you will engage in the British tutorial system, allowing you to study a wide range of topics alongside British peers. The abroadSELECT program is extremely competitive and admission will be highly selective.\n\nIn addition to courses in the Department of Economics, you can take up to 2 courses in other departments, giving you the flexibility to fulfill requirements for multiple majors or minors while still taking advantage of a world-class Economics education.\n\nStudents must have completed two years of university level studies prior to participation, per the host institution. Please know that this does not include Advanced Placement credit transfered into Pitt.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nAs an active and engaged participant on this program, you will have the opportunity to develop:\n\nthe ability to succeed independently in a foreign education environment.\n\nnon-US based perspectives on your field of study and/or future career path.\n\na global network of peer in similar fields of study and connections with faculty in the United Kingdom.\n\nPartner Information:\n\nGeneral Course Admissions\n\nStudent Marketing and Recruitment\n\nLondon School of Economics and Political Science\n\nHoughton Street\n\nLondon WC2A 2AE\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nLocation Description:\n\nIf your first thoughts of London are the Royal Family and Downton Abbey, prepare to be blown away. English history and culture are juxtaposed against streets lined with Indian restaurants and Chinese New Year celebrations. The birthplace of the English language is now home to speakers of more than 30 other languages – not counting the variety of English accents you will hear. Skyscrapers tower over 17th-century buildings while Big Ben overlooks the River Thames. Study abroad in London and you find yourself constantly surprised by what you discover in one of the world’s most diverse and global cities.\n\nHousing Description:\n\nPart of the experience is to live like a Londoner. The overwhelming majority of students choose to live in shared apartments – the English call them flats – spread across the city. You will be one of as many as eight students living in a flat, which includes shared bedrooms and bathrooms, living space, and access to laundry facilities, all in a secure building. The flats also come with an equipped kitchen; note meals are not included in the program fee. Apartments are as varied as the city itself; no two flats are alike.\n\nHousing is guaranteed by LSE since you will be studying there for a full academic year. Once you've accepted your offer to study at LSE, you will be sent more information about accommodation. Pitt students are advised to select Catered accomodation through LSE and should apply by the end of May. Find the specific application deadline and more here.\n\nAcademic Description:\n\nCredits taken at LSE require approval by both your academic advisor(s) and study abroad program manager. Additionally, for the purpose of full-time status here at Pitt, students should be prepared to take what is equivalent to at least 12 and no more than 18 Pitt credit hours.\n\nSome departments have pre-approved courses at LSE. You are not limited to just these courses. You'll find the pre-approved courses below:\n\nCourses taken at LSE will be treated as Pitt credits and will be marked as letter grades on a Pitt student's transcript. In other words, credits will affect Pitt GPAs.\n\nBelow is a list of subject areas students in the past have taken courses in. You are not limited to just these subjects.\n\nClick on \"General Course Modules\" below to view courses offered for each area of study at LSE. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of courses and is from the most recent academic year.\n\nStudents who have attended this program in the past have taken classes in the areas of::\n\nEconomics\n\nPolitical Science\n\nBusiness\n\nHistory\n\nUniversity Course Catalog:\n\nGrading:\n\nUnlike Pitt, LSE’s grading scale assigns numerical values between 0 – 100, with 100 representing the highest grade achievable. It is important to understand that few students in the British system receive grades higher than 70. Participation on this Partner Program means that Pitt students will earn actual letter grades, and therefore grades earned through this program will affect the Pitt GPA, and appear on the Pitt transcript.\n\nPitt will utilize the following grade scale to determine the letter grades:\n\n70+ = A\n\n65 – 69 = A-\n\n60 – 64 = B+\n\n55 – 59 = B\n\n50 – 54 = B-\n\n46 – 49 = C+\n\n43 – 45 = C\n\n40 – 42 = C-\n\n35 – 39 = D\n\n0 – 35 = F\n\nHillary Koller\n\nHello! I’m Hillary, Director of Pitt Global Experiences. I originally hail from New Jersey, but became a member of the Pitt community as an undergraduate student in 2002 and I have been here pretty much ever since. During my time at Pitt I’ve had the opportunity to accompany students abroad, and I’m excited to work with you to make your international experience a valuable one! When I’m not in the office, you can find me spending time in the great outdoors, reading, cooking, and taking a yoga or ballet class. Get in touch with me at hkoller@pitt.edu.\n\nSchedule an appointment\n\nTo schedule an appointment with me, send me an email and we'll find a time that works for you!\n\nApplication Instructions:\n\nPitt sends a limited number of students per semester to LSE. In addition to applying to the Pitt Study Abroad application above, be sure to review LSE's website regarding their application requirements for incoming exchange students. A formal nomination from Pitt Study Abroad is required for Pitt students to be recognized as a study abroad student at LSE. Therefore, Pitt students must complete all necessary Pitt Study Abroad steps in addition to LSE's requirements. In other words, acceptance by Pitt Study Abroad does not guarantee acceptance by the partner university.\n\nThe partner university may require the following to be submitted through an online application.

However, the United Kingdom may require Pitt students to purchase additional coverage through their national health plans, depending on the length of the exchange. See the details here.\n\nVisa Requirements:\n\nIn order to study as a student in specific countries, a visa is required. A visa is formal endorsement by the host country to grant permission for an individual to enter, live or stay in that country for a specific purpose and period. In addition to a visa, some host countries may require a residency permit upon arrival.\n\nAs part of your study abroad program in the UK, you may be required to apply for a student visa. Please be aware that UK visa processing times may be delayed due to ongoing impacts of the global pandemic. Obtaining a visa a solely your responsibility and is a very detailed process. You should be prepared to do the following:\n\nBegin your visa application process as soon as you receive the detailed instructions and guidance from your host institution or program manager\n\nFollow the instructions carefully, checking for mistakes\n\nRespond promptly to any requests for follow-up or additional information related to your visa application\n\nCheck to ensure that your returned passport has the appropriate visa stamp prior to departing the U.S.\n\nFailure to follow the visa instructions fully may result in additional cost beyond the visa application fee or visa denial.\n\nFor those without British nationality, students must obtain a Tier 4 Visa to study for a full academic year in the United Kingdom. For an overview regarding the visa process, please review LSE's website. Also, check the British Embassy or consulate closest to you for additional information. LSE will provide general direction after formal admission on how to apply for either the visa and/or residency permit. Pitt students should also research the visa and/or permit process through the specified country consulate website. In general visa and/or permit application requirements include but are not limited to the following requirements:\n\nVisa application\n\nValid Passport\n\nVerification of acceptance from sponsoring university (exchange university)\n\nFinancial Documents, such as bank statements, tax documents or pay statements.\n\nPassport photos\n\nApplication fee\n\nMedical/physical examination (likely to require a doctor's appointment so plan accordingly)"
