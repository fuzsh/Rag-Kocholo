The London School of Economics (LSE) in a nutshell

The LSE is renowned for training many leaders in business and politics, as well as in law, history, economics, philosophy and the media. 19 of its alumni and professors have been awarded the Nobel Prize (including 13 in Economics, 3 Nobel Peace Prizes and 2 in Literature), and 52 have become heads of state.

The university also boasts the world’s largest library of economic and social sciences.

It is also part of the “Golden Triangle” of English universities, along with Oxford, Cambridge, UCL, Imperial College et King’s College, la LSE.

Similar in many respects to Sciences Po Paris, it offers the opportunity to study a wide range of disciplines related to social and political sciences, law, economics, finance, management, international relations, history and philosophy.

What is the selection process at the London School of Economics (LSE)?

The LSE selection process is divided into several stages, which we describe below:

APPLICATION FORM ON UCAS

First of all, you’ll need to submit your application on the UCAS platform, the equivalent of Parcoursup in the UK. This includes a personal statement and a letter of recommendation from one of your teachers.

A STANDARDIZED ENGLISH EXAM

You’ll also be required to demonstrate an excellent command of the English language, so you’ll usually need to pass a standardized English exam such as IELTS.

CONDITIONAL OFFER OF ADMISSION

Finally, if your application is accepted at the end of the selection process, you will receive a “conditional” offer of admission. This means that you will only be definitively admitted if you achieve a minimum score on your Baccalauréat (usually a “Bien” on the French Baccalauréat) and a standardized English exam (usually between 6.5 and 7.5 on the IELTS).
