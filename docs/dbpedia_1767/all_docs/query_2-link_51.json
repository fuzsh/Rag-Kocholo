        "text": "This entry includes three subfields. The highest court(s) subfield includes the name(s) of a country's highest court(s), the number and titles of the judges, and the types of cases the court hears. A number of countries have separate constitutional courts. The judge selection and term of office subfield includes the organizations and associated officials responsible for nominating and appointing judges, and a brief description of the process. The selection process can indicate the independence of a country's court system from other branches of government. Also included in this subfield are judges' tenures, which can range from a few years to lifelong appointments. The subordinate courts subfield lists the lower courts in a country's court system hierarchy. A few countries with federal-style governments also have separate state- or province-level court systems, though generally the systems all interact."
