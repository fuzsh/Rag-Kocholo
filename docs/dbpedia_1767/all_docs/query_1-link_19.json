        "text": "Purpose\n\nArticle III of the Constitution establishes the national government’s judicial branch: the federal judiciary, headed by a single Supreme Court. In this activity, you will examine the current justices of the Supreme Court and learn how a Supreme Court nominee gets appointed to the Supreme Court.\n\nProcess\n\nAs a class, discuss what you know about the Supreme Court and what you want to know by the end of this module.\n\nWhat do you know about the Supreme Court justices?\n\nWhat do you want to know about them?\n\nNext, review and discuss the Info Brief: SCOTUS Class Photos presentation.\n\nFinally, read the Info Brief: Supreme Court document and complete the Activity Guide: Supreme Court worksheet.\n\nLaunch\n\nDisplay the image of the Supreme Court for students to view. As a large group, review a simple K- W- L activity to start student discussion based on the following questions:\n\nWhat do you know about the Supreme Court justices?\n\nWhat do you want to know about them?\n\nNext, review the presentation with students and have them complete the worksheet. Ask students to compare and contrast the images of the court over time.\n\nFinally, have students read the Info Brief: Supreme Court document and complete the Activity Guide: Supreme Court worksheet. Have students share highlights with the class.\n\nActivity Synthesis\n\nAsk students to write three facts they learned about the Supreme Court and at least one question that they still have.\n\nActivity Extension (optional)\n\nNow that students have a better understanding of the nominating process, students may research the nomination and Senate hearings process for a recent Supreme Court justice.\n\nPurpose\n\nIt is important to remember that Article III is a very short provision and doesn’t lay out many details about the Supreme Court and how it works—or even what the federal judiciary as a whole should look like. For example, it doesn’t set the number of Supreme Court justices, how many lower-court judges there should be in the federal judiciary, or when we should have any lower federal courts below the Supreme Court at all.\n\nFurthermore, Article III can be a bit hard to understand without some background first. The basic ideas are simple enough, but the language is a bit more technical than other parts of the Constitution. In this activity, you will review the key terms of the module to help deepen your understanding of Article III.\n\nProcess\n\nComplete the Activity Guide: Key Terms - Judicial System and Current Cases worksheet.\n\nAfter your worksheet is complete, your teacher will guide you through a bingo game using the key terms and definitions of Module 9.\n\nLaunch\n\nBegin the activity with key terms activity with the students. Have them review the definitions and answer questions. As a review, have students share their answers in the worksheet for all of the key terms. Finally, engage students in a fun, lighthearted activity of word bingo by reading the definitions of the terms. Have students build bingo sheets by placing the key terms on a bingo card or hand out premade cards. If your class needs more words for the bingo card, use a sampling of facts from the Info Brief: Supreme Court document. Don’t forget the FREE spot! If the students have the correct word, they’ll color, cover, or electronically mark in the box on their cards where the answer appears.\n\nActivity Synthesis\n\nHave students apply their knowledge of the terms. Read and mark up a current news article that uses the terms.\n\nActivity Extension (optional)\n\nNow that students have a better understanding of key terms about the judiciary, ask the following questions:\n\nWhat is the primary role of the courts in our constitutional system?\n\nWhy is it important for the judiciary to be independent of the other branches of government?\n\nHow do the courts play a key role in our system of checks and balances?\n\nWhat part of the process did you learn about today that was new to you?\n\nWhat other questions do you have about the courts and their process for hearing cases?\n\nPurpose\n\nThe founders’ vision of judicial independence grew out of the colonists’ own experience under the British system. Judges were not independent within this system. Instead, colonial judges were seen as officers of the crown, who carried out the orders of the king and could be removed at his whim.\n\nIn this activity, you will learn more about the Founding generation’s original vision for the Supreme Court and the federal court system.\n\nProcess\n\nRead Federalist No. 78 by Alexander Hamilton and complete the Activity Guide: The Federalist No. 78 worksheet.\n\nLaunch\n\nThe key arguments will fall under these big ideas:\n\nThe judiciary is the weakest of the three branches of government.\n\nJudges have a duty to exercise judicial review to declare laws that are inconsistent with the Constitution unconstitutional.\n\nThe power of judicial review is rooted in the principles of popular sovereignty—the idea that the powers of the government (and the authority of the Constitution) is derived from “We the People.” That authority is greater than the powers of elected officials.\n\nJudicial independence is a key component of the constitutional system—protecting judges from the influence of the other branches of government and leaving them free to exercise their independent judgment in a given case.\n\nEach argument must be summarized and at least one quote has to be used to cite as evidence.\n\nActivity Synthesis\n\nHave students discuss whether or not they agree with each argument Hamilton discusses in Federalist No. 78. Why, or why not?\n\nActivity Extension (optional)\n\nNow that students have a better understanding of the Founding generation's original vision of the judiciary, ask the following questions:\n\nWhat recent cases have been in the news about the Supreme Court?\n\nPoll your family, friends, or community members to ask them their thoughts on the Supreme Court and its role in the government.\n\nUse this information to develop a graphic or one-page fact sheet on the history and role of the court, cite evidence from your readings, and share with people in your community.\n\nPurpose\n\nIn this activity, you will learn about the history of the Supreme Court.\n\nProcess\n\nWatch the following video about the history of the Supreme Court.\n\nThen, complete the Video Reflection: History of the Supreme Court worksheet.\n\nIdentify any areas that are unclear to you or where you would like further explanation. Be prepared to discuss your answers in a group and to ask your teacher any remaining questions.\n\nPurpose\n\nSo, how does a constitutional case get to the Supreme Court? Someone—often a single person—goes to court and argues that a law, an arrest, or a regulation is in conflict with the Constitution. When this happens, they may eventually be able to petition the Supreme Court to hear their case. However, the Supreme Court has broad discretion to choose which cases it decides each year. The Supreme Court receives about 10,000 petitions per year, and only agrees to hear about 65 of them. That’s not a lot! In this activity, you will study a real case and analyze how it got to the Supreme Court.\n\nProcess\n\nBegin by reading the Common Interpretation: Article III, Section 1 and the Info Brief: How Does a Case Get to the Supreme Court document for background information about Article III and the federal court system. Summarize by writing a paragraph how the judicial branch works today.\n\nNext, work as a group to chart the path of a case to the Supreme Court. Your group will choose a historical case from the list of choices provided. Read about the case and work with your group to build a simple road map graphic to show the progression of this case to the Supreme Court. Be creative in your design. You can draw the path, sketch it out in a Word document, or use tools such as Piktochart.\n\nSelect a case from the historical case list.\n\nCompare your roadmap to the one provided on how the typical case gets to the Supreme Court today.\n\nLaunch\n\nHave students read Common Interpretation: Article III, Section 1 and Info Brief: How Does a Case Get to the Supreme Court. Then, discuss with students how the judicial branch works and how the cases start with We the People and get to the Supreme Court.\n\nActivity Synthesis\n\nAs a final activity, have students select a historical court case to build their path to the Supreme Court infographic. Students should identify the typical path, short-cuts, and areas where cases get blocked by exploring data on how many cases are heard at each level of the court system and analyzing what are the criteria for cases to get past certain checkpoints.\n\nActivity Extension (optional)\n\nNow that students have a better understanding of how a case gets to the Supreme Court, ask the following questions:\n\nWhat is one thing you learned about cases that reach the Supreme Court?\n\nWhat surprised you about these cases?\n\nWere there any similarities?\n\nIf you were to write a letter to the people in these cases before they took up the fight, what would you tell them?\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Supreme Court’s term typically lasts from the first Monday of October to the end of June.\n\nOpinions are released throughout the term, with the last of the opinions (often on the most important and controversial cases) coming out at the end of June—although there’s no deadline because the justices set their own schedule.\n\nIn this activity, you will explore some of the most significant cases that the Supreme Court heard last term.\n\nCases for 2021–2022 Term:\n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022)\n\nKennedy v. Bremerton School District (2022)\n\nNew York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen (2022)\n\nProcess\n\nAfter you review these three cases of the last term, use the information from the NCC website and SCOTUSblog to complete the Activity Guide: Supreme Court in Review worksheet.\n\nBe prepared to share your briefs (explainers) you have developed in small groups.\n\nLaunch\n\nBefore you begin, have students think about an argument they’ve had recently and write down a few notes about it. Who was involved? What was the issue? Were you able to come to a resolution? Why? Why not? Share with the class if time permits.\n\nActivity Synthesis\n\nAfter viewing the video clip, students can share their 3-2-1 notes in their small group. Ask students to circle any ideas that are shared by more than one person. Have each group choose a representative to share out to the whole class. The teacher may choose to have different groups give their responses for only one aspect of the 3-2-1 notes. However, ask each group to share the one word that was repeated. This is powerful because the same word may be repeated many times signifying its importance. Encourage this because some students may be upset that another group already said their answer.\n\nActivity Extension (optional)\n\nLooking for more tools on civil dialogue practice in your classroom?
