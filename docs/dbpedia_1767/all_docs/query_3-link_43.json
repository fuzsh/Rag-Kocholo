        "text": "Article III, Section 2, Clause 1:\n\nThe judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;—to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;—to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two or more States; between a State and Citizens of another State, between Citizens of different States,—between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.\n\nThe Supreme Court developed the Constitutional Avoidance Doctrine to minimize concerns about unelected federal judges setting aside Congress’s laws on constitutional grounds. Underlying the Constitution is the principle that government legitimacy depends on the consent of the people. Noting that “Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,” the Declaration of Independence justified the colonies’ separation from the British Crown, because it had, through “repeated injuries and usurpations,” deprived the colonists of government that represented and protected their interests.\n\nContemplating that popular sovereignty would guard against tyranny, the Framers provided for the people to elect the House of Representatives directly and the Senate and the Executive indirectly. Popular sovereignty, which the Framers viewed as necessary for a free and republican government, meant government by the majority. The Framers, however, feared that conflicting opinions and rivalries among factions of citizens might cause political instability or, if a faction gained a political majority, harm “the public good and the rights of other citizens.” To avoid this, the Framers crafted a Constitution that disbursed the limited powers of the new American government across three departments: the Legislative, the Executive, and the Judiciary, each with a unique role in securing for the Republic “a steady, upright, and impartial administration of laws.”\n\nThe Framers were also concerned that different branches might attempt to expand their powers beyond those granted by the Constitution and upset the balance the Framers designed to “secure the blessings of liberty.” Consequently, the Framers provided each branch some ability to offset the power of the other two. Describing the division of federal power among the three branches in the Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton identified the Judicial Branch as posing the least danger to the constitutional framework. He stated:\n\nAlthough Hamilton viewed the Judicial Branch as the weakest of the branches, the Framers saw it as critical to preserving the rights of individuals and ensuring that the Legislative and Executive Branches did not exceed their constitutionally-granted powers. Hamilton recognized the Constitution as superior to acts passed by Congress because the Constitution, by virtue of its ratification process, manifests the intentions of the people, whereas acts of Congress merely manifest the intention of the people’s agents. He wrote: “[W]henever a particular statute contravenes the Constitution, it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former.”\n\nHamilton further described the Judiciary as the “bulwarks of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments,” stating: “[E]very act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void.” Hamilton also viewed the Judiciary as protecting minority interests from potential oppression by the majority, stating:\n\nWhether the Framers intended to authorize the Judiciary to set aside laws passed by the elected legislature, as Hamilton envisioned, has been the subject of debate from the Nation’s earliest days. The Constitution does not expressly provide for judicial review. And while it is clear from the Federalist Papers that many Framers contemplated judicial review as including the power to invalidate acts that violated the Constitution, it is less clear whether delegates to the state ratification conventions agreed as to what judicial review might entail.\n\nChief Justice John Marshall’s opinion in his seminal 1803 decision, Marbury v. Madison firmly entrenched judicial review as a tenet of the new Republic. Chief Justice Marshall saw judicial review as implicit in the Constitution because, among other reasons, written constitutions are the paramount law; legislative acts contrary to the Constitution are thereby void; and the Constitution provides for the judicial department to interpret the law. In Marbury, Chief Justice Marshall wrote:\n\nLending support to the notion that the Constitution contemplates judicial review, the Framers distinguished the Judicial Branch from the Legislative and Executive Branches by freeing it from most forms of political accountability. Unlike the Legislative and Executive Branches, the Federal Judiciary is not subject to elections or term limits. Instead, the President nominates and the Senate approves Justices to the Supreme Court. The Constitution further secures the Judiciary’s independence from public pressure and Legislative and Executive Branch influence by providing Justices life tenure during Good Behavior and preventing Congress from reducing the Justices’ compensation.\n\nCongress, however, has some checks on the Judiciary. Justices can be impeached, and the Exceptions Clause in Article III grants Congress the power to make “exceptions” and “regulations” to the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction. In addition, Congress can dilute the influence of individual Justices by increasing the number of Justices on the Court. Finally, the Judiciary’s reliance on the other branches to give effect to its rulings provides a further check: If the Judicial Branch’s rulings are not enforced, the Judiciary becomes, in practical effect, a nullity, incapable of meaningfully performing its duty of preserving the Constitution. Consequently, while the Judicial Branch is largely insulated from political pressure, it is not completely insulated."
