The Court is the highest tribunal in the Nation for all cases and controversies arising under the Constitution or the laws of the United States.

The number of Associate Justices is currently fixed at eight (28 U. S. C. ยง1). Power to nominate the Justices is vested in the President of the United States, and appointments are made with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n\nJohn G. Roberts, Jr.\n\nClarence Thomas\n\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr.\n\nSonia Sotomayor\n\nElena Kagan\n\nNeil M. Gorsuch\n\nBrett M. Kavanaugh\n\nAmy Coney Barrett\n\nKetanji Brown Jackson\n\nAnthony M.
