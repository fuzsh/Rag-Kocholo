        "text": "​Less restricted federal employees may not:\n\nUse their official authority or influence to interfere with or affect the result of an election, by for example:\n\n​Using their official titles or positions while engaged in political activity\n\nInviting subordinate employees to political events or otherwise suggesting to subordinates that they attend political events or undertake any partisan political activity\n\nSolicit, accept or receive a donation or contribution for a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group by for example:\n\nHosting a political fundraiser\n\nCollecting contributions or selling tickets to political fundraising functions*\n\nBe candidates for partisan political office\n\nKnowingly solicit or discourage the participation in any political activity of anyone who has business pending before their employing office\n\nEngage in political activity – i.e., activity directed at the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group – while the employee is on duty, in any federal room or building, while wearing a uniform or official insignia, or using any federally owned or leased vehicle. For example, while at work employees may not:\n\nDistribute campaign materials or items\n\nDisplay campaign materials or items\n\nPerform campaign related chores\n\n​Wear or display partisan political buttons, t-shirts, signs, or other items\n\nMake political contributions to a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group\n\nPost a comment to a blog or a social media site that advocates for or against a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group\n\n​Use any email account or social media to distribute, send, or forward content that advocates for or against a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group\n\n​* Soliciting, accepting, or receiving such donations or contributions may be done so long as the person being solicited is: 1) a member of the same federal labor organization as defined under section 7103(4) of this title or a federal employee organization which as of the date of enactment of the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993 had a multicandidate political committee (as defined under section 315(a)(4) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(4))); 2) not a subordinate employee; and 3) the solicitation is for a contribution to the multicandidate political committee (as defined under section 315(a)(4)of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(4))) of such federal labor organization as defined under section 7103(4) of this title or a federal employee organization which as of the date of the enactment of the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993 had a multicandidate political committee (as defined under section 315(a)(4)of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2) U.S.C. 441a(a)(4))). However, because of the political activity on duty prohibition (5 U.S.C. 7324(a)), employees may not solicit, accept, or receive these donations while on duty or in the workplace.\n\n​The penalty structure for violations of the Hatch Act by federal employees includes removal from federal service, reduction in grade, debarment from federal employment for a period not to exceed 5 years, suspension, reprimand, or a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 7326(2). Note that this statutory maximum penalty amount is subject to annual adjustment by the Merit Systems Protection Board pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalities Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015. The current maximum penalty can be found at 5 C.F.R. §​ 1201.126(a)."
