        "text": "Through legislative debate and compromise, the U.S. Congress makes laws that influence our daily lives. It holds hearings to inform the legislative process, conducts investigations to oversee the executive branch, and serves as the voice of the people and the states in the federal government.\n\nWhat Congress Does\n\nCongress is the legislative branch of the federal government that represents the American people and makes the nation's laws. It shares power with the executive branch, led by the president, and the judicial branch, whose highest body is the Supreme Court of the United States. Of the three branches of government, Congress is the only one elected directly by the people.\n\nArticle I—the longest article of the Constitution—describes congressional powers. Congress has the power to:\n\nMake laws\n\nDeclare war\n\nRaise and provide public money and oversee its proper expenditure\n\nImpeach and try federal officers\n\nApprove presidential appointments\n\nApprove treaties negotiated by the executive branch\n\nOversight and investigations\n\nTwo Bodies, One Branch\n\nAll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n— The Constitution, Article I Section I - The Legislature\n\nCongress is divided into two institutions: the House of Representatives and the Senate. The two houses of Congress have equal but unique roles in the federal government. While they share legislative responsibilities, each house also has special constitutional duties and powers.\n\nTo balance the interests of both the small and large states, the Framers of the Constitution divided the power of Congress between the two houses. Every state has an equal voice in the Senate, while representation in the House of Representatives is based on the size of each state’s population.\n\nKnown as the Great (or Connecticut) Compromise, this plan for representation in Congress was introduced by Connecticut delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth.\n\nAdapted from the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center's website.\n\nRelated Links"
