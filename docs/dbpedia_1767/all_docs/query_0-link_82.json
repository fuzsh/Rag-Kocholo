        "text": "Alert Type info\n\nALERT: On March 22, 2023, the U.S. Department of State posted the April 2023 Visa Bulletin, as well as a Federal Register Notice (PDF) explaining certain changes to the Final Action Dates and Dates for Filing for the Employment-Based Fourth Preference Immigrant Visa Category.\n\nIf you are in the United States and need the protection of a juvenile court because you have been abused, abandoned, or neglected by a parent, you may be eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) classification. If SIJ classification is granted, you may qualify for lawful permanent residency (also known as getting a Green Card).\n\nEligibility for SIJ Classification\n\nYou must meet all of the statutory requirements outlined below to be eligible for SIJ classification. The requirements are in INA § 101(a)(27)(J); 8 CFR § 204.11; and USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 6, Part J- Special Immigrant Juveniles.\n\nYou Must:When?Be under 21 years of age.Only at the time you file the SIJ petition (Form I-360).Be currently living in the United States. You cannot apply from outside the country to come to the United States on SIJ classification.Both at the time you file the SIJ petition and at the time USCIS decides on your petition.\n\nBe unmarried. This means you either:\n\nHave never been married; or\n\nWere previously married, but the marriage ended in annulment, divorce, or death.\n\nBoth at the time you file the SIJ petition and at the time USCIS decides on your petition.\n\nHave a valid juvenile court order issued by a state court in the United States which finds that:\n\nYou are dependent on the court, or in the custody of a state agency or department or an individual or entity appointed by the court;\n\nYou cannot be reunified with one or both of your parents because of any of the following:\n\nAbuse;\n\nAbandonment;\n\nNeglect; or\n\nA similar basis under state law; and\n\nIt is not in your best interests to return to the country of nationality or last habitual residence of you or your parents.\n\nNote: Some juvenile courts may only be able to issue a juvenile court order if you are under 18 years of age.\n\nBoth at the time you file the SIJ petition and at the time USCIS decides on your petition.\n\nExceptions: You do not need to currently be under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court that issued your order if the court’s jurisdiction ended solely because:\n\nYou were adopted or placed in a permanent guardianship; or\n\nYou aged out of the juvenile court’s jurisdiction.\n\nBe eligible for USCIS consent. This means that you must have sought the juvenile court order to obtain relief from abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis under state law and not primarily to obtain an immigration benefit.At the time USCIS decides on your petition.\n\nHave written consent from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)/ Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to the court’s jurisdiction if:\n\nYou are currently in the custody of HHS, AND\n\nThe juvenile court order also changes your custody status or placement.\n\nAt the time USCIS decides on your petition.\n\nPlease see the Office of Refugee Resettlement website for instructions on obtaining HHS consent.\n\nState Juvenile Court Orders\n\nFor establishing eligibility for SIJ classification, a juvenile court is a court in the United States that has jurisdiction under state law to make judicial determinations about the dependency or custody and care of juveniles. The title and the type of court that may meet the definition of a juvenile court will vary from state to state.\n\nState juvenile courts issue orders and make decisions based on state law about dependency or custody; whether a juvenile has been abused, neglected, abandoned, or subject to similar maltreatment and consequently cannot be reunified with their parent(s); and the best interests of the juvenile. USCIS does not require that a juvenile court have the legal authority to place a child in the custody of an unfit parent in order to make a qualifying reunification determination for SIJ classification.\n\nThe court order or supplemental evidence submitted, however, must establish that the court had jurisdiction to make judicial determinations about the SIJ petitioner’s dependency or custody and care as a juvenile under the relevant state laws.\n\nAlthough state courts have the authority to provide certain protections for children under state law, they do not have the authority to administer or enforce provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Only USCIS can grant or deny SIJ classification or lawful permanent residence (a Green Card).\n\nRequired Determinations in the State Court Order\n\nThe juvenile court order must contain the required determinations made under relevant state law regarding dependency or custody, parental reunification, and best interests. You must submit evidence of a reasonable factual basis for each of the judicial determinations as well as the relief from parental maltreatment ordered by the juvenile court.\n\nYou can find more information about the eligibility requirements for SIJ classification and the court orders in the USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 6, Part J – Special Immigrant Juveniles.\n\nHow to Petition for SIJ Classification (Form I-360)\n\nTo petition for SIJ classification, you must file the following forms and supporting documentation with USCIS:\n\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\n\nEvidence of your age. You must submit 1 of the following (also submit a certified English translation, if applicable):\n\nBirth certificate;\n\nPassport;\n\nOfficial identity document issued by a foreign government, such as a cartilla or a cedula; or\n\nOther documents that satisfactorily establish your age.\n\nValid juvenile court order(s) that make the required determinations and include or are supported by evidence of the factual basis for the court’s determinations.\n\nWritten consent (PDF) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement if you are in HHS custody and the juvenile court order also changes your custody status or placement.\n\nForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, if you have an attorney or accredited representative who represents you.\n\nFiling SIJ Form I-360 In Person Before Your 21st Birthday\n\nYou must file Form I-360 for SIJ classification before your 21st birthday. See 8 CFR 204.11(b). Sometimes, circumstances such as mailing delays or state court delays in obtaining a required juvenile court order might prevent you from timely filing your petition before your 21st birthday. To help you file Form I-360 before your 21st birthday, we will allow you to file Form I-360 in person at a USCIS field office within 2 weeks before you turn 21.\n\nYou (or your attorney or accredited representative) may contact the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283 or at the My Appointment page to request an SIJ expedite appointment with a USCIS field office to file Form I-360 in person within the 2 weeks before your 21st birthday. At the appointment, the field office will accept your Form I-360 and date-stamp the first page. The field office will give you a photocopy of the first page of your Form I-360 and will send the form and any supporting documents to the USCIS Lockbox for receipting.\n\nThe USCIS Lockbox will follow standard receipting procedures. They may reject your Form I-360 if you file it improperly (for example, if you do not sign it). If the USCIS Lockbox receipts your Form I-360, they will issue a Form I-797, Notice of Action, using the date the USCIS field office physically received your Form I-360 as the receipt date.\n\nConsideration of Deferred Action\n\nOn May 6, 2022, USCIS implemented updated guidance to consider deferred action (PDF, 323.28 KB) (PDF, 323.28 KB) for noncitizens with an approved Form I-360 for SIJ classification who cannot apply for adjustment of status solely because an immigrant visa number is not immediately available. Deferred action is an act of prosecutorial discretion that defers proceedings to remove a noncitizen from the United States for a certain period of time. Deferred action does not provide lawful status.\n\nIf you have SIJ classification and you are ineligible to adjust status solely because an immigrant visa number is not immediately available, we will automatically conduct a deferred action determination for you. You do not need to file a separate request for deferred action; if you do, we will not accept it.\n\nIf we grant you deferred action, we will notify you. SIJ classified noncitizens who have moved since their Form I-360 was approved should update their address with USCIS to ensure that they receive immigration-related correspondence, including correspondence related to deferred action. See the How to Change Your Address webpage for more information\n\nIf you are an SIJ who has been granted deferred action, you may apply for and be granted employment authorization for the period of deferred action. To apply for employment authorization, file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, indicating eligibility category (c)(14). Do not apply for employment authorization before you are granted deferred action. You do not need to file Form I-765WS with the Form I-765. Go to Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, for more information on where to file.\n\nFor additional information on deferred action for SIJs who cannot apply for adjustment of status solely because an immigrant visa number is not immediately available, go to Volume 6, Part J: Special Immigrant Juveniles, Chapter 4- Adjudication, Section G. Deferred Action.\n\nGreen Card Based on SIJ Classification (Form I‑485)\n\nIf you have been granted SIJ classification (which means we approved your Form I-360 petition), you may be eligible to apply for a Green Card by filing Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. This is also known as applying for lawful permanent resident status or adjustment of status.\n\nPetition and Application Processing\n\nIf an immigrant visa is immediately available, you may generally file your Form I-360 and Form I-485 at the same time. Immigrant visas for SIJs come from the employment-based fourth preference (EB-4) immigrant visa category for special immigrants. For more information on immigrant visa availability, go to our Visa Availability and Priority Dates page.\n\nIf an immigrant visa is not available, you may still file your Form I-360, but you will need to wait to file your Form I-485. Go to the Green Card Based on Special Immigrant Juvenile Classification page for more information.\n\nAfter You File\n\nResources\n\nResources for State Juvenile Courts and Child Welfare Agencies\n\nBrochure: Immigration Relief for Abused Children (PDF, 164.64 KB)\n\nOutreach Requests and General Questions\n\nState juvenile courts and state and county-administered child welfare agencies may ask USCIS general questions about the SIJ program or request that a USCIS representative speak with them about the SIJ program. Submit a request by emailing USCIS-IGAOutreach@uscis.dhs.gov.\n\nState juvenile courts and child welfare agencies may contact U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations at 866-DHS-2-ICE with concerns about human smuggling and trafficking.\n\nForms\n\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\n\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n\nForm I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility\n\nForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative\n\nForm I-693, Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination\n\nTools\n\nCase-specific inquiries:\n\nGo to Case Status Online page\n\nCall the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283\n\nPolicy Guidance\n\nUSCIS Policy Manual guidance\n\nVolume 6, Part J: Special Immigrant Juveniles\n\nVolume 7, Part F: Special Immigrant-Based (EB-4) Adjustment of Status, Chapter 7, Special Immigrant Juveniles\n\nData\n\nData Set: Form I-360 Petition for Special Immigrant Juveniles\n\nUnaccompanied Child (UC) Resources\n\nOffice of Refugee Resettlement, Unaccompanied Children’s Services Program\n\nUnaccompanied Refugee Minor Program (URM)\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nAdjustment of Status Filing Charts from the Visa Bulletin\n\nConcurrent Filing\n\nLitigation\n\nA.O. et al. v.
