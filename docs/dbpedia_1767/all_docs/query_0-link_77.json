This structure was created to encourage nonpartisan decisions.\n\nCommissioners serve in staggered six-year terms; two seats are subject to appointment every two years. The Chair of the Commission changes every year, with no member serving more than once per term.\n\nThe Commission meets in closed sessions to discuss matters that, by law, must remain confidential, and in public to formulate policy and vote on legal and administrative matters."
