        "text": "What is the difference between criminal and civil court?\n\nIn criminal court, the government (usually referred to as “the State”) prosecutes a person for breaking the law, with the possibility of punishment like jail time or a fine. In civil court, one party files a lawsuit against another, asking for money or for a court order against the other party.\n\nIn North Carolina, the district attorney for each district is responsible for prosecuting all criminal cases (and infractions, discussed below). In civil cases, the party who filed the case is responsible for pursuing it, and the parties must obtain their own attorneys, unless they plan to represent themselves in court.\n\nCan there be a civil lawsuit and criminal charges for the same event?\n\nYes. If someone is injured or their property is damaged due to a crime, that person also might sue the person who committed the crime. This civil lawsuit usually is intended for the victim to get money to make up for their loss and is a separate case from the criminal charge. See the Lawsuits Help Topic for more information. Additionally, victims of certain crimes like domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking can file for civil orders requiring the defendant to stay away and have no contact with them. See the Domestic Violence Help Topic for more information.\n\nWho is the “defendant?”\n\nIn a criminal case, a defendant is a person who has been charged with a crime (or an infraction).\n\nWhat is a felony?\n\nA felony is a serious crime that can carry severe punishments. In North Carolina, conviction for a felony also deprives a defendant of certain citizenship rights like the right to vote. Most of these rights, including the right to vote, can be restored after the sentence is fully served and any period of post-release supervision is completed.\n\nWhat is a misdemeanor?\n\nA misdemeanor is a crime less serious than a felony. Like a felony, conviction for a misdemeanor might result in fines and/or jail time, though the punishments for most misdemeanors are much less severe than for felonies. One important difference between a misdemeanor and a felony is that conviction for a misdemeanor generally does not cause the defendant to lose the rights of citizenship.\n\nWhat is an infraction?\n\nIn North Carolina, an infraction is a non-criminal violation of the law. Many of the most commonly-charged traffic offenses are infractions, like failing to stop for a stop sign. Most infractions are punishable only by a fine (called a “penalty” in the case of an infraction), plus the payment of court costs. Although they are non-criminal violations, infractions generally are tried in criminal court and follow most of the same trial procedures as actual crimes (misdemeanors and felonies).\n\nHow can I tell whether I was charged with a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction?\n\nWhether or not an offense is a crime or infraction depends on the statute (law) that was violated. You could look up the statute, or you can consult an attorney, if the statute is not clear. However, one quick way to tell what kind of offense was charged is to look at the case number on your citation (ticket), warrant, or other charging document. The case number begins with the last two digits of the year in which you were charged. For instance, cases charged in 2018 will begin with “18.” If the next two characters are “CR,” you were charged with at least one criminal offense (either a felony or misdemeanor). If the next two characters are “IF,” you were charged only with infractions in that case. Note that you might be charged with a crime and an infraction in the same case (in which case the next two letters will be CR because of the criminal offense), or you might have charges under multiple case numbers, some of which might be criminal and some of which might be infractions.\n\nCan the victim dismiss the charges?\n\nNo. In a criminal or infraction case, the district attorney prosecutes the defendant on behalf of the State for a violation of the State’s laws. Therefore only the prosecutor or a judge has the power to drop or dismiss criminal charges. In some cases, the prosecutor might agree to dismiss the criminal charges if the victim requests a dismissal, but the prosecutor is not required to do so at the victim’s request. This is true both in cases with individual victims (such as assaults) and cases where the victim is a business (such as shoplifting).\n\nHow do I get a copy of a police report?\n\nLaw enforcement arrest reports and investigative reports are kept by the investigating law enforcement agencies. You can request a copy of a police report from a law enforcement agency that investigated or otherwise was involved in the case. However, the complete report might not be a public record and might not be available, except under the rules for discovery in some criminal cases.\n\nHow can I find out what happened in a court case?\n\nYou can look up the results of any North Carolina criminal case at the public computers located in each clerk of court’s office, or by contacting the clerk’s office in the county where the charge was filed to ask the clerk for assistance.\n\nWhat is “bond?”\n\nIn most cases, when you have been arrested for a pending criminal charge, you have a right to have a judge or magistrate set conditions of pretrial release, commonly called “bail” or “bond.” This generally occurs when you are first arrested and brought before a judicial official (usually a magistrate) for an “initial appearance.” The conditions of release may include paying or promising money to the court as a way of ensuring that you will return for your court dates. If that condition is met, the court will allow you to be free from jail until the case has been resolved. Other conditions of release also can be imposed, like staying away from a victim or witness. If you do not follow the conditions set by the court, you can be returned to jail.\n\nIs there a “48-hour hold” after an arrest for domestic violence?\n\nNo. The law says that when a defendant is arrested for certain domestic violence crimes, only a judge can determine the conditions of the defendant’s release for the first 48 hours after arrest. The law does not require that the defendant be held for a full 48 hours, but during that initial time period, a magistrate or clerk cannot decide conditions of release. While magistrates generally are available at all times, most court sessions are held only during business hours. So, if you are arrested for a qualifying domestic violence offense when court is not in session, you might have to wait until the next session of court before conditions of release will be set. If a judge has not set conditions of release within those first 48 hours (for example, if you are arrested on a Friday evening), then a magistrate is authorized to set them once that period has passed.\n\nWhat is a written promise to appear or a custody release?\n\nThe condition of release for a “written promise” is exactly what its name says: a written agreement that you will come to court on your court date. It does not require the payment or promise of money. A written promise to appear is usually available only for lower-level crimes. If you violate the written promise to appear by not showing up to court, you will be subject to arrest and may have to meet more stringent conditions to be released again.\n\nA “custody release” involves release of the defendant to a person or organization that agrees in writing to supervise him while the case is pending and to make sure he comes to court. Like a written promise, a custody release does not require the payment or promise of money in order for the defendant to be released, but a custody release can be combined with other conditions of release, like a bond.\n\nWhat is an unsecured bond?\n\nAn unsecured bond is a contract between you and the State. It is a written agreement that you will come to court, including the promise of an amount of money that you will owe the court if you fail to appear for any of your court dates. When a bond is unsecured, you do not have to pay the amount of the bond in advance in order to be released from jail.\n\nWhat is a secured bond?\n\nA secured bond is a contract between you and the State, and sometimes a third party called a “surety” (discussed more in the next question). It is a written agreement to come to court that also requires an amount of money or other security be provided to the court in advance, before you can be released from jail.\n\nWhat if I can’t afford to post a secured bond?\n\nIf you cannot pay the full amount of a secured bond in advance with your own money (cash), you may give the State a mortgage on real property (land) that you own, such as your home, as security for your appearance in court. Using land as security for a bond will require recording a document called a “deed of trust” with the Register of Deeds in the county where the land is, which gives the State the right to foreclose on the property and sell it, if the bond is forfeited and the full amount is not paid. For more information about forfeiture, see “What happens to the bond if I don’t come to court?” later in this section.\n\nIf you do not have enough money or property to post your own bond, someone else, called a “surety,” may provide security on your behalf. The surety executes (signs) the bond paperwork along with you, promising the court that the surety will ensure your appearance at court and will be responsible for the amount of the bond along with you.\n\nThe surety might be someone like a family member or friend who is not compensated for posting the bond. The surety usually will have to provide the full amount of the bond in cash or a deed of trust to real property as security for the bond, just as you would if posting the bond on your own. In some counties, for bonds under a certain amount, a person might be allowed to serve as surety by executing the bond’s promise to pay without actually providing cash or a deed in advance. Before posting a bond, a person considering serving as a surety should consult an attorney about their options and the risks of doing so.\n\nA surety also might be a bail bondsman, licensed by the North Carolina Department of Insurance to post bonds for compensation. A bondsman generally will require payment for providing this service, known as a “premium,” which usually is a percentage of the total amount of the bond. This premium is not returned when the case is over; it is the bondsman’s fee for posting the bond.\n\nWhat about electronic house arrest for pretrial release?\n\nA secured bond sometimes is combined with “house arrest with electronic monitoring,” for which you would be required to wear a monitoring device (usually an ankle bracelet) that tracks your location and alerts the authorities, if you leave home or go to locations prohibited by your conditions of release.\n\nIn some cases (usually for charges of impaired driving), your conditions of release might prohibit you from consuming alcohol while the case is pending. In those cases, you might be required to wear a different type of monitoring device that monitors your body chemistry and detects the consumption of alcohol to ensure compliance with that condition of release.\n\nHow can I have my bond reduced or modified?\n\nYour attorney can ask a judge to modify your conditions of release (like reducing the amount of the bond), or you can ask the judge to do so yourself during a court appearance, if you do not have an attorney.\n\nHow do I post bond?\n\nThe procedures for posting bond vary by county. A custodial official (jailer) or magistrate generally can tell you how to post bond, including how to contact potential sureties (family members, friends, or a bondsman) who might be able to post bond for you. Some more complicated bonds, like those secured by a deed of trust to land or a house, usually will need the help of an attorney to prepare.\n\nWhat happens to my bond if I don’t come to court?\n\nNote: In addition to the forfeiture of bond discussed here, additional consequences of failing to appear are discussed below in the section about “Going to Court.” See the question, “What if I miss my court date?”\n\nIf you fail to appear in court as required, the court will order the bond “forfeited,” which means you may be required to pay the full amount of the bond to the court. The forfeiture might be recorded as a civil judgment against you, which the State can collect just like a judgment in a civil lawsuit. See the Lawsuits FAQ for more information about this process.\n\nIf the bond was posted with cash, the State simply will keep the cash to satisfy the judgment of forfeiture. If the bond was secured by a deed of trust to land, and the forfeiture is not paid in full, the State might foreclose on the land and sell it to collect the amount owed on the forfeiture.\n\nIf the bond was posted by a surety, then the surety is liable to the State for the bond along with you, so the State might attempt to collect from the surety’s assets (including foreclosing on property). If the surety was a bail bondsman, the bondsman will be required to pay the State the full amount of the bond (not just the premium), but you or your family members then might be required to pay the bondsman additional money as a result of any contract or agreement made when the bond was posted.\n\nIf you receive a notice from the court that a forfeiture has been ordered against you, you should consult an attorney immediately about your options.\n\nHow do I get my bond back after the case is over?\n\nIf you appear as required at all court hearings in the case, and no forfeiture is ordered, then you and any surety will be released from the bond obligation at the end of the case. This means that if you paid a bond in cash with your own money, then after the case is fully resolved, the clerk’s office will mail you a check for the bond at the address in the case file. If someone like a family member posted cash on your behalf and executed the bond as a surety, the clerk’s office will return the money to the surety. If a deed of trust to property was provided as security, then once the case is fully resolved, the clerk’s office will cancel the deed of trust, which releases the State’s claim on the land.\n\nIf you only signed a written promise or unsecured bond, then no security was provided to the court, so there is nothing to return. If you or your family paid a bail bondsman to post bond, the bondsman generally will not give any money back; the bail bondsman keeps the premium as payment for the service of posting the bond. Similarly, if a private surety like a family member executed a secured bond but did not provide the court with actual security like cash or a deed of trust to their property, the bond simply terminates; there is nothing to return.\n\nHow do I get a court-appointed attorney?\n\nGenerally, the judge will ask you at your first court date whether you want court-appointed counsel, to hire your own attorney, or to represent yourself. (In some counties, this step might occur at an initial appearance before a magistrate.) If you request a court-appointed attorney, you will need to provide information about your income and financial obligations, and the judge will decide whether you qualify for a court-appointed attorney.\n\nWhat types of cases qualify for court-appointed attorneys?\n\nAnyone accused of a crime that carries a possible sentence of jail time or a fine over $500 may qualify for a court-appointed attorney. Because infractions cannot result initially in a sentence to jail time, a defendant charged only with infractions is not entitled to a court-appointed attorney.\n\nDo I have to pay for my court-appointed attorney?\n\nIf your case is dismissed or you are found not guilty, then you do not have to pay the cost of a court-appointed attorney. If you plead guilty or are found guilty, you must pay a $60 “appointment fee,” plus either an hourly rate for the time your attorney spent working on your case or a set amount (known as a “flat fee”) based on the type of case. If you are required to pay an hourly rate, your attorney will tell the judge when you are convicted how much time he or she spent on your case, so the judge can determine the total attorney’s fee for which you will be responsible.\n\nWhat if I can’t afford to pay?\n\nThe state can get a money judgment against you for the total amount of the fee determined by the judge. See the Lawsuits Help Topic for more information about this process. This does not affect your right to a court-appointed attorney in another criminal case.\n\nCan I fire my court-appointed attorney?\n\nYes, but you are not entitled to choose the court-appointed attorney you prefer. You can always hire a private attorney to represent you, even if you already have accepted court-appointed counsel. If you “fire” your court-appointed attorney, it is possible that you might not be appointed a new attorney and might be required to hire your own attorney or represent yourself.\n\nIf I turn down a court-appointed attorney, can I change my mind?\n\nYou can request a court-appointed attorney at any stage of the case, especially if your financial situation has changed. However, the judge is not required to appoint an attorney for you later in the case if you initially turn down a court-appointed attorney and then change your mind.\n\nWill my court-appointed attorney be a public defender?\n\nThis varies by county. Some judicial districts have public defenders’ offices, and in those districts, most (but not all) court-appointed cases are handled by public defenders. In other judicial districts without a public defender’s office, private attorneys agree to take court appointments. If your district has a public defender’s office, your case still might be handled by a private attorney, if there is a conflict of interest or if the public defender’s office does not have an attorney available to take your case.\n\nWhat are the qualifications of court-appointed attorneys?\n\nCourt-appointed attorneys, including public defenders and private attorneys, are all licensed attorneys in North Carolina, and have the same educational and professional requirements as other attorneys.\n\nCan I represent myself in criminal court?\n\nYes, but that might be unwise. If you choose to represent yourself, the court will expect you to follow the same rules of evidence and procedure as a licensed attorney. Court officials like judges and clerks of court cannot help you with your case, such as by giving you legal advice about your rights and obligations, possible defenses, or the likely outcome of your case, or by helping you question witnesses properly at trial.\n\nHow can I hire an attorney to represent me in criminal court?\n\nSee the Finding an Attorney Help Topic for information."
