        "text": "The first meeting of the Court was scheduled to take place in New York City on Monday, February 1, 1790, but the lack of a quorum (only three of the six Justices were present) delayed the official opening until the following day, Tuesday, February 2, 1790.\n\nAs stipulated by the Judiciary Act of 1789, there was one Chief Justice, John Jay, and five Associate Justices: James Wilson, William Cushing, John Blair, John Rutledge and James Iredell. Only Jay, Wilson, Cushing, and Blair were present at the Court's first sitting.\n\nThe six man Supreme Court met at the national capital (first New York City, then Philadelphia) twice a year; one session began the first Monday in February, and the other the first Monday in August.\n\nThe Supreme Court justices, in addition to their high-court responsibilities, were required to perform “circuit riding” duties. The Unites States circuit courts met twice a year at the district courts, creating numerous sessions a year in several different states. Each justice was assigned to one of three geographical circuits and traveled to the designated meeting places within the districts of that circuit. This meant that each early Supreme Court justice spent many months on the road and logged thousands of travel miles by horseback and carriage."
