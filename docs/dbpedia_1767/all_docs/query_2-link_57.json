        "text": "The Constitution says little about the powers, structure, and functions of the judicial branch. Instead it left much of that responsibility to Congress, stipulating (in Article III) only that judicial power be “vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.” As a result, the judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court of the United States, which consists of nine justices (including a chief justice) appointed to life terms by the president with the consent of the Senate. The Supreme Court interprets the Constitution and federal legislation. Beneath the Supreme Court are 13 courts of appeals and 94 district-level trial courts. Though not expressly covered in the text of the Constitution, judicial review—the power of the courts to examine the actions of the legislative, executive, and administrative arms of government to ensure that they are constitutional—became an important part of government in the United States and one of the key checks and balances of the American system.\n\nThe ability of courts and judges to perform their duties free of influence or control by other actors, whether governmental or private, is known as judicial independence. As a practical matter, the type of judicial independence that is widely considered both the most important and the most difficult to achieve is independence from other governmental actors.\n\nThe Supreme Court is the final court of appeal in the U.S. judicial system and the final interpreter of the Constitution. Though it can sometimes serve as a trial court through its original jurisdiction, relatively few cases reach the Court in this manner. Instead, the vast majority of the Court’s business and nearly all of its most influential decisions derive from its appellate jurisdiction. Three types of cases commonly reach the Supreme Court: cases involving litigants of different states, cases involving the interpretation of federal law, and cases involving the interpretation of the Constitution. The official decision of the Court is often supplemented by concurring opinions from justices who support the majority decision and dissenting opinions from justices who oppose it. Members of the Supreme Court are appointed for life terms, though they may be expelled if they are impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted in the Senate. The term of the Court begins on the first Monday in October and typically ends in late June.\n\nThe federal judicial system originally comprised only trial courts of original jurisdiction and the Supreme Court. As the country grew, the volume of cases awaiting review increased, and to remedy this problem, Congress passed the Circuit Court of Appeals Act (1891), which established intermediate appellate courts, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, with authority over appeals from federal district courts. Other special courts handle property and contract damage suits against the United States, review customs rulings, hear complaints by individual taxpayers or veterans, and apply the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\nThe presiding judge in the U.S. Supreme Court, the chief justice is the highest judicial official in the United States. When the position of chief justice is vacant, the president may appoint a chief justice from outside the Court or elevate an associate justice to the position. In either case a simple majority of the Senate must approve the appointment. When the office is occupied by a person of extraordinary intellectual capacity and dynamic personality, the chief justice may exert a great influence on the Court’s work."
