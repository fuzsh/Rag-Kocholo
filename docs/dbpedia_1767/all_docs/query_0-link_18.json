        "text": "What Judges and Hearing Officers Do About this section\n\nJudges and hearing officers oversee legal matters in court or administrative proceedings. They may conduct pretrial hearings, facilitate negotiations between opposing parties, and issue legal decisions.\n\nDuties\n\nJudges and hearing officers typically do the following:\n\nResearch legal issues\n\nRead and evaluate information from documents, such as motions, claim applications, and legal briefs\n\nPreside over hearings and listen to and read arguments by opposing parties\n\nDetermine whether information presented supports a charge, claim, or dispute\n\nDecide whether procedures are being conducted according to the rules and the law\n\nApply law or precedent to reach judgments and to resolve disputes between parties\n\nWrite opinions, decisions, and instructions regarding cases, claims, and disputes\n\nJudges commonly preside over trials and hearings of cases regarding nearly every aspect of society, from individual offenses to corporate disputes. Judges listen to arguments and determine whether there is sufficient evidence for a trial. In criminal cases, judges may decide that people charged with crimes should be held in jail until the trial, or they may set conditions for their release. They also approve warrants, such as for searches or arrests.\n\nJudges interpret the law to determine how a trial or hearing will proceed. They ensure fairness so that the parties’ legal rights are protected. In trials where juries are selected to decide the case, judges instruct jurors on applicable laws and direct them to consider the facts arising from the evidence. In nonjury (bench) trials, judges decide the outcome. Judges also determine or oversee the final disposition of a case, such as imposing a jail sentence in a criminal trial or the awarding of compensation for damages in a civil lawsuit.\n\nHearing officers act in a quasi-judicial capacity. They interpret and apply administrative law to resolve disputes and settle claims involving government agencies or executive departments.\n\nIn many states, judges or hearing officers oversee proceedings in courts of specialized jurisdiction. These courts consider cases only in a specific area of law, such as land use, family law, or housing law.\n\nThe following are examples of types of judges and hearing officers:\n\nJudges, magistrate judges, and magistrates preside over trials and hearings. They typically work in local, state, and federal courts.\n\nIn local courts, they may have titles such as municipal court judge, county court judge, or justice of the peace. In federal and state court systems, district court judges and general trial court judges have authority over any case in their system.\n\nAppellate court judges rule on a limited number of cases by reviewing decisions of the lower courts to ensure that the proceedings were fair and that the proper law was applied.\n\nAdministrative law judges, adjudicators, and hearing officers usually work for local, state, and federal government agencies. They decide many issues, such as whether a person is eligible for workers’ compensation benefits or whether employment discrimination occurred.\n\nWork Environment About this section\n\nAdministrative law judges, adjudicators, and hearing officers held about 13,200 jobs in 2022. The largest employers of administrative law judges, adjudicators, and hearing officers were as follows:\n\nState government, excluding education and hospitals 58% Federal government 25 Local government, excluding education and hospitals 17\n\nJudges, magistrate judges, and magistrates held about 29,600 jobs in 2022. The largest employers of judges, magistrate judges, and magistrates were as follows:\n\nState government, excluding education and hospitals 57% Local government, excluding education and hospitals 43\n\nJudges and hearing officers work mostly in offices and courtrooms. Their jobs can be demanding, because they must sit in the same position in the court or hearing room for long periods and give undivided attention to the process.\n\nSome judges and hearing officers may be required to travel to different counties and courthouses throughout their state.\n\nThe work may be stressful, as judges and hearing officers sometimes work with difficult or confrontational individuals.\n\nWork Schedules\n\nMost judges and hearing officers work full time, and some work more than 40 hours per week. Some courthouses have evening and weekend hours. In addition, judges may have to be on call during nights or weekends to issue emergency orders, such as search warrants or restraining orders.\n\nHow to Become a Judge or Hearing Officer About this section\n\nJudges and hearing officers typically need a law degree and work experience as a lawyer. However, specific requirements may vary.\n\nMost judges and magistrates must be appointed or elected to their positions, a process that often requires political support. Many local and state judges are appointed to serve fixed, renewable terms that may have mandatory retirement ages ranging from 65 to 75. Federal and some state judges are appointed for life. Judicial nominating commissions screen candidates for judgeships in many states and for some federal judgeships.\n\nEducation\n\nA Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree is typically required for jobs as a local, state, or federal judge or hearing officer.\n\nEarning a law degree usually takes 7 years of full-time study after high school: 4 years of undergraduate study in any field, followed by 3 years of law school. Law degree programs include courses such as constitutional law, contracts, property law, civil procedure, and legal writing.\n\nAlthough a J.D. is typical, requirements for these positions may vary. Hearing officers, magistrates, and even judges in some jurisdictions are not required to have a law degree.\n\nWork Experience in a Related Occupation\n\nJudges and hearing officers typically learn their skills through years of experience as practicing lawyers. Some states allow those who are not lawyers to hold limited-jurisdiction positions as judges, magistrates, or hearing officers, but opportunities are better for those with experience practicing law.\n\nIn addition to earning a law degree, federal administrative law judges typically need 7 years of experience as a licensed attorney. They also must pass a competitive exam from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.\n\nSome law school graduates who are interested in becoming a judge pursue a judicial clerkship prior to working as a lawyer. Clerkships are typically a specified length of time, such as 1- or 2-year terms, and help law school graduates develop skills required for a legal career. Clerks may need to have passed the bar exam prior to hiring, but they may work without a law license because they have limited duties and are not yet practicing lawyers.\n\nTraining\n\nNewly elected or appointed judges and hearing officers sometimes have training requirements. This training may include mock trial sessions, mentorship from experienced judges or hearing officers, and courses on topics such as judicial ethics or relations with news media.\n\nJudges and hearing officers also may be required to take continuing legal education courses throughout their careers.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nJudges typically must maintain a law license and good standing with their state bar association.\n\nAdvancement\n\nAdvancement for some judicial workers means moving to courts with broader jurisdiction, such as from lower court to appellate court. Advancement for various hearing officers includes taking on more complex cases, practicing law, and becoming district court judges.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nAnalytical skills. Judges and hearing officers must be able to analyze large amounts of information, determine relevant facts, and make decisions or issue rulings.\n\nAttention to detail. Judges and hearing officers must pay close attention to what is presented and distinguish important facts from complex information.\n\nCommunication skills. Judges and hearing officers need to convey information both orally and in writing. They must be able to explain their rulings and write decisions in ways that are both clear and comprehensive.\n\nCritical-thinking skills. Judges and hearing officers must objectively evaluate the facts of a case when applying the rules of law.\n\nDecision-making skills. Judges and hearing officers must be able to conclusively make decisions and issue rulings.\n\nPay About this section\n\nJudges and Hearing Officers\n\nMedian annual wages, May 2023\n\nJudges, magistrate judges, and magistrates\n\n$148,910\n\nJudges and hearing officers\n\n$132,950\n\nAdministrative law judges, adjudicators, and hearing officers\n\n$111,090\n\nLegal occupations\n\n$99,220\n\nTotal, all occupations\n\n$48,060\n\nThe median annual wage for administrative law judges, adjudicators, and hearing officers was $111,090 in May 2023.

Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.\n\nEmployment\n\nThese workers play an essential role in the legal system, and their services will continue to be needed into the future. However, budgetary constraints in federal, state, and local governments may limit the ability of these governments to fill vacant judge and hearing officer positions or authorize new ones. If there are governmental budget concerns, this could limit the employment growth opportunities of hearing officers and administrative law judges working for local, state, and federal government agencies, despite the continued need for these workers to settle disputes.\n\nEmployment projections data for judges and hearing officers, 2022-32 Occupational Title SOC Code Employment, 2022 Projected Employment, 2032 Change, 2022-32 Employment by Industry Percent Numeric\n\nJudges and hearing officers\n\n— 42,800 43,600 2 800 —\n\nAdministrative law judges, adjudicators, and hearing officers\n\n23-1021 13,200 13,400 1 100 Get data\n\nJudges, magistrate judges, and magistrates\n\n23-1023 29,600 30,200 2 700 Get data\n\nState & Area Data About this section\n\nOccupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)\n\nThe Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program produces employment and wage estimates annually for over 800 occupations.
