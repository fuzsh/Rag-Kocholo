Victoria Memorial Kolkata

The Victoria Memorial was built between 1906 and 1921 by the British government as a tribute to Queen Victoria, who was the Empress of India from 1876 to 1901. The idea of the memorial was proposed by Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, who wanted to create a grand building with a museum and gardens. The memorial was designed by William Emerson, a British architect, and Vincent Esch, an Indian architect. The memorial is made of white Makrana marble and has a dome that is 184 feet high.

The Victoria Memorial is not just a monument, but also a museum that displays various artifacts related to Queen Victoria and the British Raj.

The museum has 25 galleries that showcase paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, coins, stamps, weapons, textiles, and other items. Some of the highlights of the museum are the royal throne of King Edward VII, the personal belongings of Queen Victoria, the paintings of Abanindranath Tagore and Raja Ravi Varma, and the original manuscript of the Indian National Anthem by Rabindranath Tagore.
