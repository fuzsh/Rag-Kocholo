        "text": "Designed by Sir William Emerson, foreseen by Lord Curzon and inaugurated by Prince of Wales, King George V, himself, this white-marble grandiose was built between 1906 and 1921, dedicated to the deceased Queen Victoria to commemorate her 25 year reign as the Empress of India. Currently a museum under the Ministry of Culture, it still stands proudly on the Maidan (grounds) beside the bank of the Hooghly River, near Chowringhee Road or the Jawaharlal Nehru Road.\n\nYou can view virtual exhibitions of the memorial at here."
