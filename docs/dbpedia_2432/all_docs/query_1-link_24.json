This time I made sure I come on time so visited in the afternoon, I thought I won't be able to shoot inside like most of the tourist places, but to my surprise, it was allowed to shoot inside, but make sure you turn off your flashlight while taking pics or shooting videos.\n\nMore videos of Kolkata coming soon...\n\nSome internet gyaan- The Victoria Memorial is a large marble building, which is considered to be the pride of Kolkata. Built between 1906 and 1921, it is dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria. Presently it is a museum and a popular tourist spot under the Ministry of Culture.\n\nOne of the major tourist attractions of Kolkata, the Victoria Memorial Hall was built in the memory of Queen Victoria. At present, it is one of the best museums in the city and has an assortment of Victoria memorabilia, British raj Paintings, and many other displays. Victoria Memorial looks absolutely stunning at night when it is illuminated and it also holds a son-et-Lumiere show in the evening.
