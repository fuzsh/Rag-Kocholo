        "text": "The exquisite and opulent Victoria Memorial is one of Kolkata’s most impressive structures. The focus of all attention and a haven for weary feet is a massive, white marble building. It is a sin to skip the Victoria Memorial after you’ve arrived in Kolkata. The Victoria Memorial is a reminder of the height of the British Empire in India and is situated next to the lush green Maidan. Between 1906 and 1921, the memorial was erected in India to commemorate Queen Victoria’s 25-year reign.\n\nAmong the buildings built under the British Raj in India, the Victoria Memorial is arguably the most lavish. From Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Makrana marble was imported to create the massive white memorial. The Taj Mahal was constructed using a similar variety of marble. Possibly with the Taj in mind, the British constructed the Memorial!\n\nMy experience with visualization is a little different because I used to be an architect. My attention and perception were focused on the aesthetics of the intricate details and the time required to carve them. The exquisite memorial combines European and Asian architectural traditions, including Mughal domes, statues in the entrance’s Italian style, and other elements.\n\nThe building was constructed utilizing an architectural style called Indo-Saracenic Revival, which was used in British India in the late 19th century and is a fusion of both British and Mughal design elements.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial also has a museum with items from the Victorian era. Additionally, it contains a variety of oil and watercolor works by different European artists. Portraits and artifacts related to Indian independence earned a place in the museum when the country gained its independence.\n\nThe vast structure is covered in numerous stunning bronze figures. The bronze fairy perched atop the dome is the most recognizable. Surrounding Sculptures of the Dome Several allegorical sculptures, such as those representing art, architecture, charity, justice, motherhood, learning, and prudence, surround the main dome.\n\nThe fanciful, massive building was believed to sway in the wind. However, besides a few elderly people, no one has ever seen the fairy move. However, the fairy has since become a part of the Victoria Memorial’s decor, and Kolkatans never lose hope that they will eventually see the fairy move!\n\nOne of Kolkata’s best-kept gardens, the Victoria Memorial’s expansive gardens and verdant grass add to its charm. Blooming, colorful flowers are a delight to behold. Victoria Memorial Galleries The Victoria Memorial has a variety of galleries. The galleries include the Calcutta gallery, the arms and armor gallery, the center hall, the portrait gallery, and the sculpture gallery.\n\nOther museum displays include historical coins, stamps, and maps. Unknown Writings You can see “VRI” scrawled close to the gate, which most likely refers to Victoria Regina Imperatrix, which translates to “Victoria Queen and Empress.” This could have indicated that Victoria, the current monarch of England, is an Indian Empress. ‘Dieu et Mon Droit, etched above the memorial’s entrance, is another curious text. ‘God and my right’ is how this is translated. This can be a reference to the monarch’s constitutional authority."
