You will be able to access your list from any article in Discover.\n\nYou don't have any saved articles.\n\nSloane travelled the world as a high society physician. He collected natural history specimens and cultural artefacts along the way.\n\nAfter his death in 1753, Sloane's will allowed Parliament to buy his extensive collection of more than 71,000 items for Â£20,000 - significantly less than its estimated value.Â\n\nThe government agreed to purchase Sloaneâs collection and then built the British Museum so these items could be displayed to the public.\n\nThe Museum remained part of the British Museum until 1963, when a separate board of trustees was appointed, but it wasn't officially renamed the Natural History Museum until 1992.\n\nSir Richard Owen\n\nIn 1856Â Sir Richard OwenÂ - the natural scientist who came up with the name for dinosaurs - left his role as curator of the Hunterian Museum and took charge of the British Museumâs natural history collection.\n\nUnhappy with the lack of space for its ever-growing collection of natural history specimens, Owen convinced the British Museum's board of trustees that a separate building was needed to house these national treasures.\n\nIn 1864 Francis Fowke, the architect who designed the Royal Albert Hall and parts of the Victoria and Albert Museum, won a competition to design the Natural History Museum.\n\nWhen he unexpectedly died a year later, the relatively unknown Alfred Waterhouse took over and came up with a new plan for the South Kensington site.\n\nWaterhouse used terracotta for the entire building as this material was more resistant to Victorian London's harsh climate.\n\nThe result is one of Britainâs most striking examples of Romanesque architecture, which is considered a work of art in its own right and has become one of London's most iconic landmarks.\n\nA cathedral to nature\n\nWhile the building reflects Waterhouseâs characteristic architectural style, it is also a monument to Owenâs vision of what a museum should be.\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, museums were expensive places visited only by the wealthy few, but Owen insisted the Natural History Museum should be free and be accessible to all.\n\nVictorian explorersâ regularly unearthed new speciesÂ of exotic animals and plants from all over the British Empire, and Owen wanted a building big enough to display these new discoveries in what he called a cathedral to nature.\n\nOwen's foresight has allowed the Museum to display very large creatures such as whales, elephants andÂ dinosaurs, including the belovedÂ DiplodocusÂ cast that was on display at the Museum for 100 years.\n\nHe also demanded that the Museum be decorated with ornaments inspired by natural history. And he insisted that the specimens of extinct and living species kept apart at a time when Charles Darwinâs theory of evolution was revealing theÂ links between them.\n\nAlong with incorporating Owenâs ideas into his plans, Waterhouse also designed an incredible series of animal and plantÂ ornaments, statues and relief carvings throughout the entire buildingÂ âÂ with extinct species in the east wing and living species in the west.\n\nThe sculptures represent amazing creatures from natureâs diverse past, such as the ancientÂ Great PalaeotheriumÂ andÂ Pterodactyl, as well as present-day animals including the lion and cobra.\n\nWaterhouse sketched every one of these sculptures in great detail, even asking Museum professors to check the scientific accuracy of his drawings, before creating the fantastic decorations that complement the Museumâs exhibitions.\n\nEvolution of the Museum\n\nIn 1986, the Museum absorbed the adjacent Geological Museum of the British Geological Survey and its collection ofÂ more than 30,000 minerals. The Lasting Impressions gallery opened three years later to connect the two buildings.\n\nThe Darwin Centre opened to the public in 2009 and houses the Museum's historic collections as well as its working scientists. The centre's unique Cocoon structure displays the Museum's most important plant and insect specimen collections, and is equipped withÂ state-of-the art research facilitiesÂ used by more than 200 scientists.\n\nVisitors can watch our scientists work in open-plan laboratories, where they study everything from the cocoa that Sloane brought back from Jamaica in the seventeenth century to malaria-carrying mosquitoes collected in 2008.\n\nHintze Hall, the Museum's central space, was redeveloped in 2017. TheÂ DiplodocusÂ skeleton cast was replaced with a 25.2-metre blue whale skeleton. It is intended to be a reminder to visitors that humanity has a responsibility to protect the biodiversity of our planet."
