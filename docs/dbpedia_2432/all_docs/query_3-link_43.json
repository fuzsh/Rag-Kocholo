        "text": "1. (1906-1921) Designed by WILLIAM EMERSON VICTORIA MEMORIAL\n\n2. The Victoria Memorial Hall was erected in Calcutta, the then capital of British India, to commemorate Queen Victoria. The project was conceived by Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905, who intended it to be a period museum in memory of the queen with particular emphasis on Indo-British history. Built on a 57-acre land and designed by Sir William Emerson (the then President of the Royal Institute of British Architecture), the splendour of the Memorial is evident in its architecture, which is predominantly Italian Renaissance in character, blended with nuances of Orientalism. Widely hailed as the finest specimen of Indo-British architecture in India, and often referred to as the ‘Taj of the Raj,’ the Victoria Memorial Hall had its foundation stone laid by the Prince of Wales in January 1906 and formally opened to the public in 1921. It was declared an institution of National importance by the Government of India Act of 1935. Today, the Victoria Memorial Hall is considered to be one of the best examples of a unique paradigm of the visual arts where four diverse fields of arts – architecture, sculpture, painting and gardening come together.\n\n3. THE CITY History • It was the capital of British India from 1772-1911 (140 Years) • It is the only metropolis in Eastern India Economic Profile • The importance of Kolkata as a trading centre was first recognized by the British East India Company in the 17th century • Kolkata is the main business, commercial and financial hub of eastern part of India • It is a major port, and the only city in the region to have an international airport Socio-Cultural Profile • It is a truly cosmopolitan city and is home to more than 15 different communities including international communities like Chinese, Armenians • Kolkata is widely regarded as the birthplace of modern Indian literary and artistic thought\n\n4. THE PLAN\n\n5. Indo Saracenic Revival Architecture - Architectural style movement by British architects in the late 19th century in British India.

Pomeroy, R.A. • There are also other statues of various dignitaries like Lord Bentinck, Governor General of India (1828-1835), Lord Ripon (Governor- General of India from 1880 to 1884; the statue of Sir Rajendranath Mookerjee, the pioneer industrialist of Bengal is on the eastern side.

Ceiling and Ceiling treatment: The monument has geometrical ceiling patterns with creative cornices designs. They were all white in color. Distemper paint was used over the ceiling. The designs on the ceilings were matching with the room size and shape having square and rectangular patterns. THE ELEMENTS\n\n14.

The main collections of the Victoria Memorial show cases Western Paintings, Sketches, Indian Paintings and Company school drawings, Archive, Arms and Armour, Lithographs, Aquatints, Mughal Miniatures, Manuscripts, Rare Books, Postage Stamps, Sculptures created by renowned artists and three thousand five hundred articles associated with the everlasting memory of Queen Victoria THE ELEMENTS\n\n18. THE ARCHITECTURE The Victoria Memorial's architect was William Emerson (1843– 1924), president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. The design is in the Indo-Saracenic revivalist style which uses a mixture of British and Mughal elements with Venetian, Egyptian, Deccani and Islamic architectural influences. The building is 338 by 228 feet (103 by 69 m) and rises to a height of 184 feet (56 m). It is constructed of white Makrana marble. The gardens of the Victoria Memorial were designed by Lord Redesdale and David Prain. Emerson's assistant, Vincent Jerome Esch, designed the bridge of the north aspect and the garden gates. In 1902, Emerson engaged Esch to sketch his original design for the Victoria Memorial. After designing the temporary exhibition building for the Delhi Durbar of 1903, Curzon found Esch to be a suitable assistant for Emerson. Atop the central dome of the Victoria Memorial is the 16 ft (4.9 m) figure of the Angel of Victory. Surrounding the dome are allegorical sculptures including Art, Architecture, Justice, and Charity and above the North Porch are Motherhood, Prudence and Learning. In design it echos the Taj Mahal with its dome, four subsidiaries, octagonal- domed chhatris, high portals, terrace, and domed corner towers.\n\n19. THE ENTRANCE\n\n20. THE MUSEUM The Victoria Memorial has 25 galleries. These include the royal gallery, the national leaders gallery, the portrait gallery, central hall, the sculpture gallery, the arms and armoury gallery and the newer, Calcutta gallery. The Victoria Memorial has the largest single collection of the works of Thomas Daniell (1749–1840) and his nephew, William Daniell (1769–1837). It also has a collection of rare and antiquarian books such as the illustrated works of William Shakespeare, the Arabian Nights and the Rubaiyat by Omar Khayyam as well as books about kathak dance and thumri music by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. However, the galleries and their exhibitions, the programmatic elements of the memorial do not compete with the purely architectural spaces or void.\n\n21. THE MUSEUM Royal Gallery The Royal Gallery displays a number of portraits of Victoria and Prince Albert, and paintings illustrating their lives, by Jansen and Winter halter. The oil paintings are copies of those in London. They include: Victoria receiving the sacrament at her coronation in Westminster Abbey (June 1838); Victoria's marriage to Albert in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace (1840); the christening of the Prince of Wales in Windsor Castle (1842); the marriage of Edward VII to Princess Alexandra (1863); Victoria at the First Jubilee service at Westminster Abbey (1887) and the Second Jubilee service at St. Paul's Cathedral (June 1897). Victoria's childhood rosewood pianoforte and her correspondence desk from Windsor Castle stand in the centre of the room. Edward VII presented these items to the Victoria Memorial. On the south wall hangs the Russian artist Vasily Vereshchagin's oil painting of the state entry of Edward VII in Jaipur in 1876.\n\n22. THE MUSEUM Calcutta Gallery In the mid-1970s, the matter of a new gallery devoted to the visual history of Calcutta was promoted by Saiyid Nurul Hasan, the minister for education. In 1986, Hasan became the governor of West Bengal and chairman of the board of trustees of the Victoria Memorial. In November 1988, Hasan hosted an international seminar on the Historical perspectives for the Calcutta tercentenary. The Calcutta gallery concept was agreed and a design was developed leading to the opening of the gallery in 1992. The Calcutta gallery houses a visual display of the history and development of Calcutta from Job Charnock (1630–1692) of the English East India Company to 1911, when the capital of India was transferred to New Delhi. The gallery also has a life-size diorama of Chitpur road in the late 1800s.\n\n23. THE EVENTS Over the years the memorial has not only emerged as one of the most famous tourist destinations of Kolkata but has also remained a favourite spot for family and friends apart from holding a special place for lovebirds. As night falls, lighting of the Victoria Memorial makes it look even more mesmerizing.\n\n24. VICTORIA MEMORIAL AT NIGHT"
