        "text": "Located in the heart of the city of joy, Victoria Memorial Kolkata is an iconic structure commemorated for Queen Victoriaâ€™s 25-year rule over India. The Queen Victoria Memorial Kolkata is an almost replica of a similar monument present in London, also called the Victoria Memorial. This white marble building is one of the most famous tourist spots in West Bengal. This attraction is even more magnetic at night when it is illuminated and the light and sound show in Victoria Memorial Kolkata adds up to its delight.\n\nPeople visiting Kolkata have Victoria Memorial on top of their lists. This opulent structure sprawls across 64 acres of land and is circumscribed by a spectacular lush green garden with many historical structures and statues in it. The victoria memorial inside has a lot of paintings depicting various moments of history, antique pieces, and great halls that make you feel like standing on a royal podium of British heritage.\n\nThe monument has now become a museum and a sweet dish for all history lovers. Various galleries and beautifully carved intrinsic architecture of this monument pause everyone to get transformed back to the Victorian era. It is a must-visit tourist spot in Kolkata, erstwhile Calcutta, to travel back to the colonial era while standing in the middle of the hustle-bustle of present-day Kolkata."
