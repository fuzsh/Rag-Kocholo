        "text": "The Victoria Memorial – an immaculate architecture fashioned in the ‘Italian Renaissance’ style with an essence of Mughal touch stands royally in the middle of 21 expansive lush green gardens covering 64 acres of land in Kolkata. The gardens were designed by Lord Redesdale and David Prain, and have a number of significant statues, the most famous out of which is the beautiful bronze statue of Queen Victoria herself.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial\n\nThe memorial is a landmark which commemorates Queen Victoria’s 25-year reign in India. The credit of which goes to Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India, who on the death of Queen Victoria raised the question of erecting a ‘stately’ memorial as homage to the late queen. Funds were voluntarily raised by the princes and people of India amounting to Rs.1,05,00,000\\- for the construction and the Prince of Wales, King George V, laid the foundation stone on January 4, 1906 and the memorial was formally opened to the public in 1921.\n\nThis memorial is a melting and merging if the finest of architectural elements of Islamic, Deccan, British, Venetian and Egyptian and the credit for this go to England’s renowned architect Sir William Emerson, president of the British Institute of Architects, who designed and planned the building. The famous Messrs. Martin & Co. of Calcutta under the proprietorship of Sir R. N. Mookerjee were entrusted with the construction. The memorial belongs to the Hindu-Saracenic or Indo-Saracenic revivalist style of architecture while incorporating elaborate construction and engineering techniques with the aesthetic sensibilities of gothic revival of continental Europe with Indian and Indo-Islamic architectural elements involving ingenious skill of artisan’s for minute decorations and ornamentations.\n\nThe Memorial’s grandeur at a height of 200 feet (184 ft up to the base of the figure of Victory, which is again 16 ft high) is accentuated by its serene corridors. This building covers 338 ft by 228 ft constructed in marble from Makrana quarries keeping to the standards of advanced British Structural Engineering Standards 1800s, which include infrastructure of iron, steel and poured concrete. The total weight of the Victoria Memorial with marble cladding comes roughly around 80,300 tonnes.\n\nThis stately memorial has a dome which is topped by an enormous (16′ high, 3-tonne) bronze statue of Nike Angel of Victory holding a bugle in her hand. Surrounding the main dome are intricate sculptures emblematic figures of art, charity, justice and architecture. The north porch of the monument depicts sculptures of learning, motherhood and prudence. Richness of the architecture are clear in the dome, clustered with four subsidiary, octagonal domed chattris, the high portals, the terrace and the Moghul-style corner domes towers, carving round the window arches which reveal the many Saracenic touches.\n\nThe spectacular museum\n\nToday, this huge stately white-marble memorial serves as a grand museum filled with a vast collection of 29,000 artefacts from the period of British Empire rule, out of which 4,000 are a large collection of oil paintings and water colours by famous European artists like Charles D’oyly, Johann Zoffany, William Hadges, William Simpson, Tilly Kettle, Thomas Hickey, Bultzar Solvyns, Thomas Hickey, Emily Eden and others.\n\nThe museum has 25 galleries, some of the more popular ones being the Royal Gallery, the Queens Hall Gallery, the Sculpture Gallery, the Arms and Armory Gallery, and, of course, the Calcutta Gallery.\n\nThe Royal Gallery is a storehouse of oil paintings of Queen Victoria’s personal belongings such as her chair, writing desk, and even her piano, evidence of her receiving the sacrament at her coronation in the Westminster Abbey in June 1838; her marriage with Prince Albert (1840), the christening of the Prince of Wales, the marriage of the Prince of Wales (Edward VII) with Princess Alexandra and others.\n\nThe Durbar Hall Gallery has an array of oil paintings that depict the cultures of India and Britain.\n\nThe Calcutta Gallery is all about the past of Kolkata with paintings and photographs dating back to its foundation in by Job Charnock in the seventeenth century.\n\nThis is also India’s largest museum library with antiquarian rare books that date back to 1870s, such as the Arabian Nights, Omar Khayyam’s Rubaiyat, works of William Shakespeare and\n\nvaluable manuscripts like the Ain-i-Akbari by Abul Fazal. Also a never-ending collection of weapons, rare postage stamps, coins, and textiles are here to entice the visitors."
