        "text": "Last Updated: July 24, 2018 Tour My India\n\nImages of bright yellow ambassadors and dawdling trams come flashing to my mind when I think of visiting Kolkata. But the first thing I plan to do is, ‘take a ferry ride across the Hooghly River that traverses century old Howrah Bridge.’ Of course, this city has a number of attractions to visit and from all the travel blogs I read they make sure that you pick Victoria Memorial Hall Museum from the rest, saying, ‘it will leave you wonderstruck.’ This makes me ponder over the idea of taking the ferry ride in Hooghly River and a visit to the wildlife destination of Sundarbans first and stepping into the past by visiting the Victoria Memorial Hall and Museum. I went through the internet with a fine tooth comb and collected ‘good enough info for the first-time traveller’ and listed down what can you expect here.\n\nAlso Read\n\nBest Monuments in India that Reflect Rich Culture & Heritage\n\nAbout the Victoria Memorial Hall and its status in the ‘City of Joy,’ Kolkata\n\nIn 1921, established to commemorate Queen Victoria (1819–1901), this tourist attraction is rightly said to be one of the most inspiring places in the whole of Kolkata. I mean, how can it not be with its grand architecture built by using makrana marble laid out by William Emerson in an Indo-Saracenic revival style. For the architecture enthusiasts, it is a place to witness intricate influences of British, Mughal, Islamic, Venetian, Egyptian and Deccan styles of architecture. At the top of the dome of the memorial, you’ll notice a 4.9-metre figure of the Angel of Victory, Nike, now we know from where did the Nike brand got its logo. Check out the statue of Goddess Nike in the ancient city of Ephesus (in Turkey). Placed at the highest point of the memorial the dome also features allegorical sculptures that include of Architecture, Justice, Art, Charity and above the North Porch of the building are the figures of Prudence, Motherhood and Learning. Even the terrace of the building has an intricate design creating an ideal place for photoshoots, if only it was allowed! It is said that this memorial hall palace stands 56 metres and expands up to 103 metres adorning the lustrous garden designed by Lord Redesdale and David Prain. And to add to its beauty, a must-see is a bridge in the garden built by Vincent Jerome Esch, Emerson’s assistant, this small feature takes the entire look of the Victoria Memorial Hall Museum to the next level.\n\nThis megastructure is one of the most renowned landmarks in the city of Kolkata, let us dig in and see what all treasures it features inside the museum\n\nBuilt as a memorial to Queen Victoria, the Victoria Memorial Hall also features a museum with nearly 30,000 treasured artefacts. You’ll find exhibits that include old and rare photographs, Western and Indian paintings, manuscripts in 25 galleries like the Royal Gallery, the Portrait Gallery, the National Leader’s Gallery, the Sculpture Gallery, Queens Hall Gallery, the Arms and Armoury Gallery, and Calcutta Gallery. The Victoria Memorial Hall Museum also features the largest collection of antiquarian books like the works of William Shakespeare, the Rubaiyat by Omar Khayyam, the Arabian Nights, it also has books about Thumri music by Wajid Ali Shah and Kathak dance. It also has a collection of textiles, weapons, coins and stamps among others. At the Queens Hall Gallery, the best thing to see are the personal possessions of the Queen herself, like her writing desk, chair and also the piano.\n\nThe Calcutta Gallery at VMHM is all about the history of the city, in this section you’ll come across many images and paintings of the developmental stages of Calcutta. The works from Job Charnok and the British rule up to 1911 is virtually displayed. The gallery also displays a representation of the 19th-century view of the Chitpur road. In contrast to the aforementioned gallery, the Royal Gallery features paintings illustrating the lives of Victoria and Prince Albert. It also has a painting of Queen Victoria receiving sacrament during her coronation in Westminster Abbey in June 1838. The Durbar Hall Gallery, on the other hand, displays a series of oil paintings of the cultural heritage of Britain and India. The Entrance Hall Gallery displays paintings and photographs of the different phases during the construction of the memorial between 1906 and 1921.\n\nAlso Read\n\nPopular Tourist Getaways from Kolkata for Weekend Holidays\n\nIf the indoor attractions are not enough to fill your heart, check out the outdoor attractions in Victoria Memorial Hall\n\nThe outdoor has a lustrous garden covering 64-acres of land with a fluorescent blanket of flowers and fountains.
