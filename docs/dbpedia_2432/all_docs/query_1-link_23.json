The central dome is crowned with a bronze statue of the angel of victory.\n\nMuseum: The memorial houses a museum that displays a rich collection of artifacts, paintings, sculptures, and memorabilia from the British colonial period in India. The galleries inside the museum showcase the history and art of the time, including portraits of British royalty and historical events.\n\nGardens and Grounds: The memorial is surrounded by well-maintained gardens and lawns. The grounds are a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, providing a serene and picturesque setting for leisurely strolls.\n\nIllumination: The Victoria Memorial is beautifully illuminated in the evenings, creating a spectacular view.
