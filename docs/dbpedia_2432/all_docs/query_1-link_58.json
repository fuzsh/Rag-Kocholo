Here you will find works by many of the worldâ€™s great artists and designers, known and unknown, from across time and continents.\n\nThe Museum was founded in 1982 alongside the Shannon Rodgers and Jerry Silverman School of Fashion Design and Merchandising, and offers invaluable first-hand experiences for all students, faculty and staff at Kent State University. The Museum also serves the culturally rich communities of Northeastern Ohio as well as global audiences through the loan of objects to museums, scholarly research, and traveling exhibitions from the distinguished collection."
