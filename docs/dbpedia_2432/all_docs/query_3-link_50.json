        "text": "If you think Victoria Memorial Kolkata is only a historical monument and a landmark for the city then, that’s not entirely the case. The majestic monument stands tall as a mark of the architectural and colonial history of Kolkata. Not only the legacy but also the white marble architecture draws in tons of tourists to Kolkata Victoria thereby making it a tourist attraction. Surrounded by sprawling gardens, Victoria Palace Kolkata has a lot more of it that needs to be known. And we are here with a dedicated article that talks about the magnificent monument. To know more, keep scrolling!\n\nHistory of Victoria Memorial\n\nThe Victoria Memorial, the most famous building in Kolkata is the result of Lord Curzon’s brain who was once the Viceroy of India under British rule. It was in the year 1901 when the then Empress of British India died, Lord Curzon decided to honour her with the construction of a grand memorial monument. The proposal was to build the memorial as a stately edifice and for the visitors to have a look at the past marvels. In 1906, the foundation stone of Victoria Memorial was kept by the Prince of Wales who afterwards became King George V on January 4th. Victoria Memorial was officially inaugurated in 1921 and thereafter opened for public visits. Later, after India became independent, there were multiple additions done to Victoria Mahal.\n\nThe Enticing Victoria Memorial Architecture\n\nIf you think a specific type of architecture suffices the structure, then let us tell you that it’s the amalgamation of multiple styles of architecture. The prominent one is the Indo-Saracenic style displaying the elements of both British and Mughal architecture. Also, the monument hints at some Egyptian, Deccani, Venetian, and Islamic architectural elements. The palace is made out of Makrana marble that gives a royal vibe altogether.\n\nTalking about the design, Victoria Memorial is inspired by the majestic Taj Mahal. The design elements incorporated in the architecture are one central dome, four other domes, a terrace, chhatris shaped like octagonal domes, and high portals. On top of the central dome, there is a statue of the Angel of Victory which is 16 feet high. A lot of allegorical sculptures can also be noticed, for instance, the north porch showcases learning, motherhood, and prudence.\n\nDesign of Victoria Memorial Gardens\n\nRoughly, the lush gardens of Victoria House Kolkata, take up 26,000 square meters or 64 acres of area and some highly experienced gardeners are on duty to maintain these beauties.
