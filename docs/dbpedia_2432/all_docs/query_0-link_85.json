        "text": "This white marbled magnificent structure was built in commemoration of Queen Victoria to honour her 25 years of rule over India and is almost a carbon-copy of The Victoria Memorial in London. Situated in the heart of the city, The Victoria Memorial is a quintessential structure that is synonymous with the city of joy! It is now a museum and tourist attraction under the aegis of the Ministry of Culture.\n\nEncircled by a lush green and spick and span garden which spreads over 64 acres, The Victoria Memorial stands tall in all its glory. A sixteen-foot tall bronze statue of victory, mounted on ball bearings at the top of the memorial, serves to heighten the overall appeal and opulence of the entire complex. It is an awe-inspiring and remarkable sight especially at night when it is illuminated and to top it all, the light and sound show that occur in the evening will undeniably take your breath away!\n\nThe gardens of the memorial are home to a multitude of sculptures. A bronze statue of Queen Victoria welcomes visitors at the entrance while a stroll around the garden exposes one to other statues like those of Edward VII, Curzon, Hastings and Dalhousie.\n\nWilliam Emerson, the president of the Royal Institute of British Architects is the main designer of The Victoria Memorial. Having incorporated the Venetian, Egyptian, Mughal and other Islamic styles, he wonderfully accorded an Indo-Saracenic style of architecture to the monument. A treasure house of exceptional and notable collections of textiles, weapons, portraits, works of Shakespeare and other artifacts, the memorial boasts of a plethora of exhibitions that take place frequently along with various other events such as illustrated talks and celebrations of important days."
