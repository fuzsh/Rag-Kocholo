It is a huge building made up of White Makrana marble. The construction of this marvelous structure dates back between 1906 and 1921. As the name stands, the monument is dedicated in the memory of Queen Victoria. This monument is opened for public as a renowned museum. Apart from the collectibles of the museum, the stunning building is an attraction in itself. One can see the central dome of the memorial holding a 16ft high figure of the Angel of Victory. The use of the precious Makrana marble adds to the glory of the structure. Architectures compare this building to the world-famed Taj Mahal and report that both the monuments have a striking resemblance. So is visited by thousands of tourists every year."
