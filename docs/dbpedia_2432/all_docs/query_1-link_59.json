        "text": "How to Purchase Tickets\n\nIf you have any issues with the ticket buying experience on this page, please call us for help at 207-772-4841.\n\nWe recommend tickets be purchased through our online system. A small service fee will be added to ticket orders.\n\nUnder the “Purchase Tickets” heading on this page, find our ticket system.\n\nThere are 2 tabs on the first screen:\n\n“Get Tickets” shows a calendar.\n\n“Details” has a summary of the Mansion and tour safety protocols.\n\nChoose a tour date from the calendar.\n\nAvailable times for that day will show under the calendar.\n\nSelect a time.\n\nSelect the “Get Tickets” button.\n\nThis screen shows a list of ticket types.\n\nEnter the number of each ticket type you need.\n\nPlease ensure that ALL members of your party are accounted for, including children under 6. Children under 6 receive free admission, but must be part of the final tour count as tour capacity is limited.\n\nNote: If you have a group larger than the ticketing service limit allows, please call first.\n\nSelect the “Get Tickets” button.\n\nThe next screen shows your order and total amount due.\n\nChoose if you would like your ticket texted to your phone or if you’d rather receive an email with tickets to print.\n\nSelect the “Checkout” button.\n\nThis screen shows a confirmation of your date and time.\n\nRead and accept the mask requirement waiver.\n\nSelect the “Continue” button.\n\nEnter your billing and payment information on the next screen.\n\nAgree to the Terms of Service.\n\nSelect the “Complete Order” button.\n\nIf you prefer to complete your ticket purchase on the ticketing site itself, please click here.\n\nParking\n\nPlease be advised there are current construction projects happening around the Mansion this season. We advise you to allow a few extra minutes for travel time.\n\nMap of current construction projects in Portland, Maine\n\nConvenient on-street parking (1- and 2-hour) is usually available on nearby Danforth, High, State, Park, or Pleasant Streets. Metered parking spaces (on-street and lots) are also available within walking distance of the Mansion, as well as parking garages on Spring Street, roughly a 5-minute walk from the Mansion. Please note that there is no parking on the Mansion side of Danforth Street and that much of the parking across the street is limited to 15 minutes due to day school activity. We regret that there is no on-site parking at the Mansion. This parking map shows the timed parking in the Victoria Mansion area.\n\nAs we are located in a primarily residential neighborhood, it is possible that construction and maintenance may be happening nearby. We regret that we do not always have advance knowledge of some of these routine city activities and that it may impact parking and transportation. Visit Portland, Maine Parking for more information about city street maintenance. There is also a parking guide with information about types of parking, payment options, and garage locations and rates available on the Visit Portland website.\n\nVisitors traveling by bicycle may utilize the bicycle racks located next to the Carriage House in the Mansion courtyard."
