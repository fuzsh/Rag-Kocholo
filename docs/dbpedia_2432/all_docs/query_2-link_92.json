        "text": "Description\n\nBuilt between 1906 and 1921, and designed by a famous architect of that era; William Emerson, the Victoria Memorial was built in memory of Queen Victoria, and has now become a museum and popular tourist destination. This must-see attraction is a large marble building that is home to numerous galleries including the Royal gallery, the sculpture gallery, the national leaders gallery, the arms and armoury gallery, the portrait gallery, central hall, and the Calcutta gallery. These galleries hold paintings of the Royal British families, documents of the historical interests, royal and historic artifacts, and other antiquities. The memorial has a unique blend of Mughal and British architectural styles and is truly a landmark in Kolkata. Also a must-see is the beautiful, gigantic 64 acre garden.\n\nTicket Price\n\nIndians: Rs 10 Foreigners: Rs 150\n\nOpening Hour\n\n10:00 am – 5:00 pm (Closed on Mondays)\n\nRecommended Visit Duration\n\nAround 2 hours or more\n\nSuitable For\n\nAdults, senior visitors, young adults, families\n\nMust See\n\nPortraits of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and the other antiques\n\nPrayer Facilities\n\nThere are no known prayer facilities inside the Victoria Memorial. Muslim tourists can either find a quiet space in the garden to offer their prayers, or they could ask the staff at the memorial to direct them to a prayer facility nearby. The city of Kolkata is home to a large number of mosques which are frequented by locals and tourists.\n\nHalal Food\n\nWhile there are no eating establishments inside the Victoria Memorial, visitors to Kolkata will be able to find a number of restaurants in the city that suit their tastes and budgets. It will not be difficult for Muslim visitors to find Halal restaurants and food stalls in the city.
