        "text": "This is the Queen Victoria Memorial located in St. James’ Park in London, England. It was built around 1901 by Sir Thomas Brock, who lived from 1847 to 1922, but was not unveiled until 1911. It was finished, though, in 1924. This was to commemorate Queen Victoria. It stands almost 25 meter high and is made of Carrara marble, granite, and bronze. It is the largest monument to a monarch in England.\n\nAt the top of the monument is Winged Victory. Winged Victory, or Nike, is the daughter of Athena and Styx. She is the goddess of victory, both in battle and friendly competition. She holds a globe in one of her hands. This is to show how powerful she is. The choice to use Nike as the main goddess was probably to show the power England had. The monument was constructed after the death of Queen Victoria to show how much of an impact she had on the country.\n\nVariations of the Winged Victory can be seen on many different monuments around the world. For example, there is one on a monument in the Tiergarten in Berlin, Germany. Nike is a popular symbol still used today to demonstrate the power a nation has. It is to show that they have Victory on their side.\n\nThere are also smaller statues of lesser goddesses or angel-like figures like Charity, Truth and Justice. These were placed to show the other important aspects of the English nation that the Queen and the people valued at the time. It was to show how great of a nation England truly was.\n\n*seen by K.
