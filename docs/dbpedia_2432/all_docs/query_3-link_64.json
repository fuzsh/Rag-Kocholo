        "text": "The Victoria Memorial Hall was erected in Calcutta, the then capital of British India, to commemorate Queen Victoria’s 25-year reign. The project was conceived by Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905, who intended it to be a period museum in memory of the queen with particular emphasis on Indo-British history.\n\nThe magnificent and ornate Victoria Memorial is one of Kolkata’s most remarkable landmarks. A large white marble edifice is the center of attention and a sanctuary for tired feet. The Victoria Memorial, located adjacent to the beautiful green Maidan, is a reminder of the height of the British Empire in India.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial is undoubtedly the most opulent of the structures constructed in India during the British Raj. Makrana marble from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, was used to make the huge white monument. The Taj Mahal was built with a similar type of marble. The British may have built the memorial with the Taj in mind!\n\nThe magnificent memorial mixes European and Asian architectural traditions, featuring Mughal domes, Italian-style figures, and other aspects. The structure was built in an architectural style that used both British and Mughal design features.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial also has a museum with Victorian-era artifacts. It also includes a range of oil and watercolor works by various European painters. When India attained independence, portraits and artifacts relevant to the country’s freedom earned a place in the museum. The massive structure is adorned with magnificent bronze figurines.\n\nThe most recognizable figure is the bronze fairy seated atop the dome. The main dome is encircled by allegorical sculptures of art, architecture, charity, justice, motherhood, learning, and prudence.\n\nThe fanciful, massive building was believed to sway in the wind, but no one has ever seen the fairy move. The fairy, however, has since become a part of the Victoria Memorial’s decor, and Kolkatans never give up hope that they will see the fairy move!\n\nThe Victoria Memorial’s wide grounds and beautiful grass contribute to its appeal as one of Kolkata’s best-kept gardens. Colorful flowers in bloom are a sight to see. Galleries of the Victoria Memorial There are several galleries at the Victoria Memorial. The Calcutta gallery, the weapons and armory gallery, the central hall, the portrait gallery, and the sculpture gallery are among the galleries.\n\nOther museum displays include historical coins, stamps, and maps. Unknown Writings You can notice “VRI” scrawled close to the gate, which most likely refers to Victoria Regina Imperatrix, which translates to “Victoria Queen and Empress.”\n\nOverall, the Victoria Memorial is a fascinating destination for anyone interested in the history and culture of India. With its beautiful architecture and impressive collection of exhibits, it’s definitely worth a visit if you’re in Kolkata."
