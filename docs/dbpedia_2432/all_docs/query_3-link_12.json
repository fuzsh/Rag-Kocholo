        "text": "Situated right in front of Buckingham Palace, this large memorial was built in the early twentieth century in honor of Queen Victoria, who reigned over the United Kingdom for almost sixty-four years.\n\nThe Memorial\n\nCentral Monument\n\nSurrounding statues\n\nOther sea-related creatures can be found on the reliefs on the outside surface of the enclosing wall, including mermaids, mermen, and other sea creatures.\n\nAlso on the enclosing wall are groups of bronzes. The bronze groups on the east are symbolical of Peace and Progress and, on the west, of Industry and Agriculture. Down the steps leading to the ground level, you’ll find two sets of wonderfully majestic lion sculptures. One set is said to have been a gift from the people of New Zealand.\n\nLondoners sometimes refer to the Victoria Memorial as “the wedding cake” monument because of its tiered shape."
