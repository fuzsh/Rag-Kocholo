It is also a museum where people could see before them pictures and statues of men who played a prominent part in the history of India and develop a pride in their past especially in relation to the history of Calcutta . Lord Curzon conceived it. Presently it is the finest and most prominent building and art museum of Calcutta, India, under the Department of Culture, Government of India."
