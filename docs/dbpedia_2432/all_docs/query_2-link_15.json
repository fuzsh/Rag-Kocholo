Now it's the most popular tourist destination in Kolkata. The structural beauty of the monument amazed me. This memorial is a sign of India's colonial past as it was built in memory of then British India's Empress Victoria. The memorial hall hall has been turned into a Museum now. But what an irony. The then anti occupation Independence activist Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose is featured in this Museum\n\nS Khan GMU\n\nKolkata - Victoria Memorial\n\n#passionpassport Another relic of the British Raj in India, the Victoria Memorial is located in the heart of Kolkata, in West Bengal. This white marbled opulent structure was built in memory of Queen Victoria to celebrate her 25 years of rule over India and is almost a replica of the Victoria Memorial in London. Victoria Memorial is an iconic structure that is synonymous with the city of joy! The memorial is surrounded by a lush green and well-maintained garden, which spreads over 64 acres and has numerous statues and sculptures in it. A sixteen-foot tall bronze statue of victory, mounted on ball bearings at the top of the memorial, serves to heighten the overall appeal and grandeur of the entire complex. Victoria Memorial is breathtaking and marvellous, especially at night, when it is illuminated. The Sound and Light shows that take place in the evening are an added delight, and a must watch. All in all, the place is a must visit for people to wish to relive the essence of the Victorian era in the modern day world. #kolkata #westbengal #travel #passionpassport\n\nWander_Girl\n\nmajestic of Victoria memorial\n\nVictoria memorial is a bread taking moment and has a must visit landmark the grand marble structure dedicated to Queen Victoria stands as a symbol of Kolkata is rich history and architecture's friend the integrated details on the building and its expensive gardens of limbs into a bubani area of British colony grand year inside the museum house and an impressive solution of artifact paintings and historical exhibits that provides facility insights into the religious past the surrounding and the garden makes it a perfect spot for leg working and photography courses and knowledgeable and dancing the overall experience with their history of a simple looking for a peaceful retreat Victoria memorial is an outstanding destination lasting and pressure#victoriamemorial\n\ntipsy travels"
