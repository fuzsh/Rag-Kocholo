        "text": "On learning and acquiring technical skills and developing the photographic eye from the workshops, I was better equipped with the camera, its tools, and ways to approach a wildlife species without undermining the ethics. For me, the Wasp and the Flies sucking up nutrients from the rotting fruit; getting the camera close enough to shoot, without disturbing them and capture the world through their perspective with the help of the macro lens. Dipanjan Sharma, St. Xavier's College, Kolkata\n\nA photograph is never taken, it is captured. It acts like a time machine which allows a viewer to travel back into seconds before a shot is frozen forever. My series of photographs also serve as a journey to those vulnerable moments in which these beings were photographed. Each piece tells a story of its own. Priyanka Singh, Scottish Church College\n\nThrough this series of pictures I want to show the habitation of wildlife. How free they look when the wildlife is close to the nature and what will happen if we don’t take a good care of those habitats as well as wildlife. The series also offers a glimpse into the people who are working towards preserving these habitats. Shreya Poddar, ilead College\n\nThe fact that the insect, dragonfly and butterfly which we've known since forever now could have so many diversities leaves me completely speechless! These mere creation of the Almighty with such intricate designs and detailing and with so many different colours, leaves me dumbstruck every time I look at them! Soumili Das, St. Xavier's College, Kolkata\n\nMy collection contains many pictures of birds. But when it comes to capturing the picture of an insect it got lot harder than photographing a bird. In this world there is no such thing as beautiful as nature. A photographer's greatest dream is to fill his collection with aesthetic pictures of nature and wildlife. Srijita Chakraborty, National Academy of Photography"
