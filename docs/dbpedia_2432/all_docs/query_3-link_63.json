        "text": "When you think of grandeur, magnificence, stature and history in Kolkata, Victoria Memorial is inevitably the first place that comes to mind. As the former British capital, this white marble monument project saw its inception by Lord Curzon in 1901 as a tribute to Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, followed by which the Prince of Wales laid the foundation on 4 January 1906. After lengthy and elaborate work, the building was formally opened on 28 December 1921.\n\nToday, the inside of the Victoria Memorial Hall is turned into a museum. It houses 29,220 artefacts that reflect the history of our country over three centuries, starting from the middle of the seventeenth century. The collection includes a variety of showcases that include paintings in oil and watercolour, sketches and drawings, aquatints, lithographs, photographs, rare books and manuscripts, stamps and postal stationery, coins and medals, arms and armour, sculptures, costumes, personal relics and other important archival documents.\n\nBelieve us, it is the perfect place to go for a day picnic. Not only does it have a very elaborate museum inside, but it is also surrounded by luscious gardens and ponds. You will also come across a bronze statue of Queen Victoria by Sir George Frampton, R.A. The Queen is seated on her throne, wearing the robes of the Star of India. Other statues there include King Edward VII, Lord Bentinck, Governor-General of India (1828-1835), Lord Ripon (Governor-General of India from 1880-1884) and Sir Rajendranath Mookerjee, the pioneer industrialist of Bengal.\n\nThe location of Victoria Memorial is also quite strategic. You can take a direct taxi to this place from practically any nearby place. The nearest metro station is the Maidan Station, and the ideal way to travel without a private car is to take the bus line number 77. When visiting Victoria Memorial, do not miss out on the street food hawkers right opposite it. You will be trying one of the city's best puchka and jhaal-muri stalls.\n\nTiming: 10 AM to 6 PM, Closed on Mondays\n\nPrice: INR 20 for adults and INR 200 for foreigners. Entry is free for school students in uniforms."
