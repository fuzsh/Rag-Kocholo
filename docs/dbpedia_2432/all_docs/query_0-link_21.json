        "text": "The Victoria Memorial is a monument built in honor of Queen Victoria of Great Britain. The monument is in Kolkata in the Indian state of West Bengal.\n\nIn January 1901, after the death of Queen Victoria, George Curzon, Governor General of India, proposed to build a memorial in honor of the Queen. The Prince of Wales, later King George V, placed the first stone on January 4, 1906. The memorial was designed by the British architect William Emerson. It was finished in 1921. The gardens were designed by Lord Redesdale and Sir David Prain.\n\nCurrently, the monument has a museum that is a tourist attraction in Kolkata. The museum houses over 30,000 items on display.\n\nThe style of the building has been described as \"Indo-Saracenic\" It includes elements of Indo-Islamic architecture. The building has a look that is similar to the Taj Mahal, India's most famous monument. Like the Taj Mahal, the Victoria Memorial is built in white makrana marble."
