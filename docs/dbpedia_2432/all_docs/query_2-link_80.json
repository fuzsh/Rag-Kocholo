This monument is special for multiple reason... 1.This is made of while marble, so elegant in construction. 2. This monument depicts the british-era architecture. 3. You can see many historical paintings, sculpture, articles. 4. A wide greenery (trees, fountains) around the main building. 5. and, special activities around .  Speciality of structure? 7\n\n8.  Historical significance The Victoria Memorial is a heritage building that resonates the colonial influence in the city's architecture. Empress Victoria  The Victoria Memorial, one of the top historical places in Kolkata, is the brainchild of Lord Curzon, a Viceroy of India.  When Queen Victoria, who was the Empress of British India, died in January 1901, Curzon suggested building a grand memorial to honor her.  He proposed the memorial to be a stately edifice with a museum where visitors get a glimpse of the marvels of the past.  The foundation for the memorial was laid on 4 January 1906 by the Prince of Wales, who later became King George V.  The building was formally inaugurated and opened for public visits in 1921.  Later, additions were made to the memorial after India gained independence. 8\n\n9. 4.Though the monument was erected during the colonial era, the donations were collected from the Indians as the British had only partly funded the construction. As a result of the rapid decolonisation that took over the country after 1947, many statues built by the British (scattered all over India) were relocated to the garden of the Victoria Memorial. 5. The wonderful portrayal and the apt personification of abstract ideas were immensely popular through the creation of allegorical sculptures that was clearly evident in the ancient, Indian temple architecture. These unique sculptures were later adapted into Western architecture too, after the 15th century. The Victoria Memorial is dotted with such sculptures that depict art, motherhood, charity, justice, prudence and learning.  About the structure 9\n\n10. It is perceived by many that the Victoria Memorial bears a striking resemblance to the majestic Taj Mahal and we have reasons to believe so. Just like the Taj, this monument is also built using the exquisite Makrana marble. Echoing the aesthetic appeal of the Taj Mahal, the monument also bears a few structural similarities such as the iconic dome, octagonal-domed chattris, domed corner towers and the high portals.  About the structure 10\n\n11. Today, this historical building is one of the top museums in Kolkata.  There are 25 galleries inside the memorial, including the: Calcutta Gallery, Portrait Gallery, Royal Gallery, Sculpture Gallery, and the National Leaders Gallery, to mention a few.  The Victoria Memorial Museum is home to over 28,000 artifacts, including arms and armor, sculptures, and antiquarian books, paintings, etc.  Apart from the magnificent edifice, the sprawling green lawns surrounding the memorial are an ideal place to hang out and go for morning walks in Kolkata.  The gardens cover an area of about 57 acres and feature statues of Queen Victoria, Charles Cornwallis, Arthur Wellesley, and Rajendra Nath Mookherjee, among others. The property is now under the control of the Ministry of Culture.  Victoria Memorial: Today Major Exhibits: Indian landscape paintings by Thomas Daniell and William Daniell, rare books like Rubaiyat by Omar Khayyam and illustrated works of William Shakespeare, the hand- written Quran of Emperor Aurangzeb, Kalighat paintings, the personal war diary of Tipu Sultan, etc. 11\n\n12.  Typology of structure : museum under ministry of culture  A large number of artefact’s from the invaluable collections of the Memorial are on display. They are suitably placed in various galleries.  The galleries include :  The Royal Gallery (currently closed for renovation)  Entrance Hall  Portrait Gallery  The Queen’s Hall  The Prince Hall  National Leaders’ Gallery (currently closed for renovation)  Indian Schools of Art (currently closed for renovation)  Calcutta Gallery  Durbar Hall  The Victoria Memorial has the largest single collection of the works of Thomas Daniell (1749–1840) and his nephew, William Daniell (1769– 1837).  It also has a collection of rare and antiquarian books such as the illustrated works of William Shakespeare, the Arabian Nights and the Rubaiyat by Omar Khayyam as well as books about kathak dance and thumri music by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah.  However, the galleries and their exhibitions, the programmatic elements of the memorial do not compete with the purely architectural spaces or voids. 12\n\n13.  Design  The design is in the Indo-Saracenic revivalist style which uses a mixture of British and Mughal elements with Venetian, Egyptian, Deccani and Islamic architectural influences.  The building is 338 feet (103 m) by 228 feet (69 m) and rises to a height of 184 feet (56 m).  It is constructed of white Makrana marble.  The gardens of the Victoria Memorial were designed by Lord Redesdale and David Prain.

All the allegorical sculptures were sculpted in and shipped from Italy.  The ‘Angel of Victory’ is mounted on huge ball bearings on top of the central dome which rotate with the wind. 13\n\n14.  Construction The construction of the Victoria Memorial was delayed by Curzon's departure from India in 1905 with a subsequent loss of local enthusiasm for for the project, and by the need for testing of the foundations. The Victoria Memorial's foundation stone was set in 1906 and the building opened in 1921. The work of construction was entrusted to Messrs. Martin & Co. of Calcutta. Work on the superstructure began in 1910. After 1947, when India gained independence, additions were made.  Use of white Makrana Marble Like the Taj Mahal, the Victoria Memorial is built of white Makrana marble and is a memorial to an empress. In design, it echos the Taj Mahal with its dome, four subsidiaries, octagonal-domed chattris, high portals, terrace, and domed corner towers.  Victoria memorial : architecture The building is a good example of the colonial style of architecture.
