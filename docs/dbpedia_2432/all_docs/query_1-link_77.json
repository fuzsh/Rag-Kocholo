        "text": "Victoria Memorial\n\nNestled amidst lush gardens, the sparkling white Victoria Memorial offers a true visual ecstasy. Victoria memorial dedicated to Queen Victoria, offers a deep insight into the history of India, starting from the rise of the British Empire up to the Independence era. When Queen Victoria died in 1901, Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India, proposed a grand monument for her. In January 1906, the Prince of Wales laid the foundation of Victoria Memorial, which was founded by Indian princes, the British government and partly by Curzon himself. The monument – 103m x 70m, and 56 m high – was designed by Sir William Emerson and constructed by Martin & Co, with white Markana marble from Rajasthan. Its central dome is crowned with a 3-tonne, almost 5m tall ‘Angel of Victory’ crafted in Italy. This impressive monument stands in 64 acres of lawns and gardens, was opened to the public in December 1921. The memorial houses a well-maintained museum, which displays an impressive collection of memorabilia and paintings related to Queen Victoria, Indian Freedom Fighters and other aspects of Indian and British history. It treasures a wide collection of sculptures, paintings lithographs and Mughal miniatures, weaponry and other historical treasures.\n\nLocation of Victoria Memorial, Kolkata\n\nLocated at the southern end of the famous Kolkata Maidan, the majestic Victoria Memorial of Kolkata is flanked by Fort William, Calcutta Race Course, the Birla Planetarium, St. Paul’s Cathedral and Jawaharlal Nehru Road.\n\nHistory of Victoria Memorial, Kolkata\n\nLord Curzon, first proposed the idea of building a majestic memorial to offer tribute to Queen Victoria and since Kolkata was the capital of British India, it was the natural choice for such a structure. Sir William Emerson wonderfully conceptualized and designed the outlay of the memorial on 64 acres of land. The foundation stone of the Memorial was laid by the Prince of Wales on 4th January, 1906 at Kolkata. Sir David Prain and Lord Redesdale designed the beautifully landscaped garden, flanking the entire memorial. The Duke of Windsor inaugurated the Memorial to public on 21st December 1921. Though it is said that Emerson designed the monument in the Italian Renaissance style, it is difficult to miss its resemblance to the Taj Mahal. Indeed, the similarity is also striking that the Memorial earned the name ‘Taj of the Raj.’ The huge hall measures 338 feet in length and 228 feet width and it reaches a towering height of 184 feet.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial of Kolkata has a colossal bronze statue of the Queen Empress. A moving angel has been created at the top of the Memorial, which is facing the Kolkata Maidan. Victoria memorial houses a number of statues: The statues of Motherhood, The statues of Learning, The statues of Architecture, The statues of Charity, The statues of Justice, The statues of Prudence and The statues of Art. All these statues were brought to Victoria Memorial from Italy.\n\nVictoria Memorial houses a nice museum, which showcases a striking collection of memorabilia, related to Queen Victoria and the rule of British in India. After India became independent in 1947, few additions were made to the Victoria Memorial. The newer additions formed the National Leader’s Gallery, which displays the relics and portraits related to Indian independence.\n\nInside Victoria Memorial and around it"
