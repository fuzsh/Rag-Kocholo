For the most current program information, please refer to the official website of the respective school.\n\nLearning styles are crucial in education, and understanding them can come with great benefits. Various types of learning styles exist. One widely referenced student learning model is educational theorist Neil Fleming’s VARK model.\n\nThe VARK acronym refers to four types of learning styles: visual, auditory, reading/writing preference, and kinesthetic. The VARK model recognizes the diverse ways in which students absorb and process information, commonly referred to as “preferred learning modes.” For example, when learning how to build a clock, some students understand the process by following verbal instructions, while others have to physically manipulate the clock. Learning styles also take into account various methods of understanding and retaining information.\n\nTeaching professionals often rely on the categories of the VARK model to help tailor their teaching strategies, ensuring a personalized and effective learning experience for students. Some instructors may exclude reading/writing as a category of preferential learning, and build their curriculum around the remaining learning styles: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic (VAK).\n\nThe main ideas of VARK (PDF, 123 KB) are as follows:\n\nSometimes, teachers may find that a combination of all the sensory modalities may be the best option for their classroom. However, allowing students to access information in terms they are comfortable with can increase their academic confidence.\n\nThe notion of individualized learning styles has gained widespread recognition in education theory and classroom management strategy. Individual learning styles depend on cognitive, emotional, and environmental factors, as well as one’s prior experience. In other words: everyone’s different. It is important for educators to understand the differences in their students’ learning styles, so that they can implement best practice strategies into their daily activities, curriculum, and assessments. Many degree programs, specifically higher level ones like a doctorate of education, integrate different learning styles and educational obstacles directly into the curriculum.\n\nReferred to as SWOT (“study without tears”), Fleming provides advice on how students can use their learning modalities and skills to their advantage when studying for an upcoming test or assignment.\n\nHow do you learn best? Complete Fleming’s VARK Questionnaire to find out what kind of learner you are.\n\nREAD MORE: Teaching Methods\n\nLast updated January 2024"
