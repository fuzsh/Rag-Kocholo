        "text": "“The 5E Model of Instruction promotes active learning. Students are involved in more than listening and reading. They learn to ask questions, observe, model, analyze, explain, draw conclusions, argue from evidence, and talk about their own understanding. Students work collaboratively with peers to construct explanations, solve problems, and plan and carry out investigations.” –Rodger Bybee\n\nENGAGE\n\nThe first phase of the 5E Model engages students by having them mentally focus on a phenomenon, object, problem, situation, or event. The activities in the Engage phase are designed to help students make connections between past and present learning experiences, expose prior conceptions, and organize thinking toward the essential questions and learning outcomes of the learning sequence.\n\nThe role of the teacher in the Engage phase is to present a situation, identify the instructional task, and set the rules and procedures for the activities. The teacher also structures initial discussions to reveal the range of ideas, experiences, and language that students use which become resources for upcoming lessons.\n\nStudent Behaviors\n\nAsks questions such as, “Why did this happen?” “What do I already know about this?” “What can I find out about this?” “How can this problem be solved?”\n\nShows interest in the topic through curiosity and expression of wonderings\n\nDemonstrates engagement by expressing ideas, sharing observations, and creating initial models\n\nExpresses current understanding of a concept or idea\n\nTeaching Strategies\n\nRaises questions or poses problems\n\nElicits responses that uncover students’ current knowledge\n\nHelps students make connections to previous work\n\nPosts learning outcomes and explicitly references them in the lesson\n\nInvites students to express what they think\n\nInvites students to raise their own questions\n\nEXPLORE\n\nOnce students have engaged in activities, they need time to explore ideas. Explore activities are designed so all students have common, concrete experiences which can be used later when formally introducing and discussing scientific and technological concepts and explanations. Students have time to investigate objects, events, or situations. As a result of their mental and physical involvement in these activities, students question events, observe patterns, identify and test variables, and establish causal relationships.\n\nThe teacher’s role in the Explore phase is to facilitate learning. They initiate activities and allow time and opportunity for students to investigate objects, materials, and situations. The teacher coaches and guides students as they record and analyze observations or data and begin constructing models or initial explanations.\n\nStudent Behaviors\n\nTests predictions and hypotheses; Forms new predictions and hypotheses\n\nDiscusses problems with others\n\nPlans and conducts investigations in which they observe, describe, and record data\n\nTries different ways to solve a problem or answer a question\n\nCreates initial models\n\nCompares ideas with those of others\n\nTeaching Strategies\n\nProvides or clarifies questions or problems\n\nProvides common experiences\n\nObserves and listens to students as they interact\n\nActs as a consultant for students\n\nEncourages student-to-student interaction\n\nAsks probing questions to help students make sense of their experiences and redirect them when necessary\n\nProvides time for students to puzzle through problems\n\nEXPLAIN\n\nThe Explain phase consists of two parts. First, the teacher asks students to share their initial models and explanations from experiences in the Engage and Explore phases. Second, the teacher provides resources and information to support student learning and introduces scientific or technological concepts. Students use these resources and information, as well as ideas of other students, to construct or revise their evidence-based models and explanations. In engineering, students design solutions to problems based on established criteria.\n\nStudent Behaviors\n\nShows models, explanations, answers, or possible solutions, to other students\n\nListens critically to and questions explanations offered by others\n\nExplains using evidence from investigations\n\nUses labels, terminology, and formal scientific language\n\nCompares current thinking with former thinking\n\nRecords ideas and current understanding\n\nAdjusts ideas, models, and explanations as new evidence or reasoning is presented\n\nTeaching Strategies\n\nEncourages students to explain concepts and definitions in their own words\n\nAsks for justification (evidence) and clarification from students\n\nFormally provides definitions, explanations, and information through mini-lecture, text, internet, or other resources\n\nBuilds on student explanations\n\nProvides time for students to compare their ideas with others and if desired revise their ideas\n\nELABORATE\n\nOnce students have constructed explanations of a phenomenon or design solutions for a problem, it is important to involve them in further experiences that apply, extend, or elaborate the concepts, processes, or skills they are learning. Some students may still have misconceptions, or they may only understand a concept in terms of the exploratory experience. Elaborate activities provide time for students to apply their understanding of concepts and skills. They might apply their understanding to similar phenomena or problems.\n\nStudent Behaviors\n\nApplies new labels, definitions, explanations, and skills in new, but similar, situations\n\nUses previous information to ask questions, propose solutions, make decisions, design experiments, or complete a challenge\n\nDraws reasonable conclusions from evidence\n\nCritiques the models, explanations, or arguments made by others using evidence and reasoning\n\nMakes conceptual connections between new and previous experiences\n\nCommunicates understanding to others\n\nTeaching Strategies\n\nExpects students to use vocabulary, definitions, and explanations provided previously in new contexts\n\nEncourages students to apply the concepts and skills in new situations\n\nProvides additional evidence, explanations, or reasoning\n\nReinforces students’ use of scientific terms and descriptions previously introduced\n\nAsks questions that help students draw reasonable conclusions from evidence and data\n\nEVALUATE\n\nIt is important that students receive feedback on the quality of their explanations. Informally, this may happen throughout the learning sequence. Formally, the teacher can also administer a summative evaluation at the end of the learning sequence. The Evaluate phase encourages students to assess their understanding and abilities and allows teachers to evaluate individual student progress toward achieving learning goals and outcomes.\n\nStudent Behaviors\n\nGives feedback to other students\n\nEvaluates progress or knowledge\n\nChecks work with a rubric or against established criteria\n\nAssesses progress by comparing current understanding with prior knowledge\n\nAsks additional questions that go deeper into a concept or leads to additional learning\n\nDemonstrates understanding of Disciplinary Core Ideas, Crosscutting Concepts, and Science and Engineering Practices\n\nAnswers open-ended questions by using observations, evidence, and previously accepted explanations\n\nTeaching Strategies\n\nAsks open-ended questions such as, “Why do you think…?” “What evidence do you have?” “How would you answer the question?”\n\nObserves and records notes as students demonstrate individual understanding of concepts learned and performance of skills\n\nUses a variety of assessments to gather evidence of student understanding\n\nProvides opportunities for students to assess their own progress\n\nSample Template for Developing 5E Learning Sequences\n\nPrior to building a 5E learning sequence, teachers should consider learning goals and outcomes, select the phenomenon/problem, and identify the essential question(s) that will drive learning. The “Planning for Engagement with Big Ideas” tool can be used to help with this initial work."
