        "text": "1. Types of Associate Degrees\n\nIf you’re just starting out with higher education or want to add education credentials to real-world experience, an associate degree could be a great fit. Associate degrees are typically 60 credits and can be completed in 2 years or less. They can be a great first step toward earning an entry-level job or promotion.\n\nSome types of associate degrees you can consider include:\n\nAssociate in accounting\n\nAssociate in criminal justice\n\nAssociate in digital photography\n\nAssociate in information technology\n\nAssociate in liberal arts\n\nAssociate in marketing\n\nThere are two main types of associate degrees: Associate of Science (AS) and Associate of Arts (AA). An AS degree can prepare you for jobs available across many industries, including marketing, information technology and accounting. Earning an AA degree can help you develop soft skills employers seek, such as problem-solving, critical thinking and communication.\n\nThere are great benefits and opportunities that come with starting with an associate degree. For example, earning an associate degree can have a significant economic impact. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), associate degree holders earned nearly 18% more than workers with only a high school diploma in 2023.*\n\nIf you’re unsure about starting a bachelor’s degree program, earning an associate degree is a great way to kickstart your education and enter the workforce before enrolling in a more advanced degree. If you decide to continue to a bachelor’s program, your associate degree credits are typically transferred into the program, allowing you to complete a bachelor's degree faster.\n\nMahogany Tillman '22, for example, earned her associate degree in 2020 and transferred credits into a bachelor's program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).\n\nIn the months leading into the pandemic, Tillman had lost one of her greatest supporters, her grandmother. And at graduation, Tillman wore a stole honoring her.\n\n\"I made a promise to my family that I was going to complete school,\" she said. \"That's why I went on to continue (to a bachelor's).\"\n\nShe walked at SNHU's Fall 2022 Commencement nearly two years later, earning her Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN).\n\nRead more: Is an Associate Degree Worth It?\n\n2. Types of Bachelor's Degrees\n\nDesigned to be completed in 4-years, bachelor’s degree programs provide in-depth knowledge and skills across a wide variety of career paths to help you stand out in today’s competitive job market. Bachelor's program lengths will vary based on your pacing, so it could become a 6-year degree, depending on how many classes you take at a time and whether you take any terms off.\n\nSamiyah Muhammed '23 is a first-generation college graduate who earned her Bachelor of Science (BS) in Criminal Justice with a concentration in Human Services and Advocacy. She hopes to use her degree to help those in need.\n\n\"I plan to advocate for the little guy,\" she said. \"Hopefully, no one will have to go through the obstacles that I've gone through, and if there's anything I can do to help, I am glad to do so.\"\n\nMuhammed said she also wants to start life coaching for those who may need a little extra motivation and guidance.\n\nBachelor's degrees are in high demand. According to a 2023 U.S. Census Bureau report, more than 37% of adults over 25 held at least a bachelor’s degree.\n\nIn today’s competitive hiring climate, it pays to advance from an associate to a bachelor’s.* According to BLS, bachelor’s degree holders earned about 41% more in 2023 than workers with an associate degree.*\n\nBachelor’s degrees like a Bachelor of Science (BS) and Bachelor of Arts (BA) offer more opportunities to focus your learning on a specialized area of study. With a business administration bachelor’s degree, for example, you can concentrate your studies on anything from finance, accounting and healthcare management to marketing, entrepreneurship and public administration.\n\nEarning a bachelor’s degree opens the door to advancing your education with a graduate-level degree — an increasingly common step for workers looking to further their careers.\n\nRead more: Is a Bachelor's Degree Worth It?\n\n3. Types of Master’s Degrees\n\nEarning a master’s degree can be a great way to position yourself for growth in your desired field. And everyone's path to a master's degree looks different.\n\nEvan Fronheiser '21 '23MBA had initially gone to college right out of high school but quickly learned that the traditional college experience wasn't for him. So, he served in the U.S. Air Force for eight years, taking several college courses during that time.\n\nFollowing his time in the military, he worked in the offshore oil industry for several years before deciding to return home and finish his bachelor's degree online.\n\nShortly after, he became a military academic advisor for SNHU. He then began pursuing his master's degree.\n\nAt SNHU's 2023 Fall Commencement, all his hard work paid off as he walked across the stage, earning his Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Project Management.\n\n\"I think that having my master's degree is going to help move me onto the next phase of hopefully becoming a project manager,\" he said.\n\nWith growing opportunities for online master’s degree programs, including those that can be completed in less than 2-years, this degree path is becoming increasingly popular for full-time working adults such as Fronheiser.\n\nEmployers are also increasing their demand for master’s degree holders.* According to BLS data, jobs requiring master’s degrees are projected to grow by 11.3% through 2032, the largest growth of all the degree types.*\n\nEarning a master’s degree can open the door to advancement within your company, help you tackle new career goals and can also boost your long-term earning potential.* Master’s degree holders’ median weekly earnings were about 16% higher than bachelor’s degree holders and 64% higher than associate degree holders in 2023, according to BLS.*\n\nMaster’s degrees, like Master of Science (MS) or Master of Arts (MA), are available across a wide variety of subjects. Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs are among the most well-known master’s degree programs, with opportunities to study finance, accounting, international business, criminal justice, information technology management and more.\n\nIf you’re looking to advance your education even further, you may be wondering what comes after a master’s degree.\n\nRead more: Is a Master's Degree Worth It?\n\n4. Types of Doctoral Degrees\n\nIf you’re looking to advance your education to the highest degree in college, a doctoral degree may be right for you.\n\nDepending on your industry and career goals, there are several types of doctoral degrees to consider. A few include:\n\nDoctor of Business Administration (DBA): A terminal degree tailored to business professionals looking to explore, examine and address business issues. DBA programs are not currently available at SNHU.\n\nDoctor of Education (EdD): A doctoral degree geared toward leaders (and aspiring leaders) in educational organizations and the education system itself.\n\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD): An academic doctorate available to a range of fields. A PhD is typically required to become a professor and can help you start a career in research.\n\nDr. Jennifer Barry '04 '06G '23EdD has worked in higher education for over 17 years. She aspires to become a college president one day.\n\n\"I can see how much the president of a university can impact the trajectory of a school over time, and I'd like to be part of that for an institution,\" she said.\n\nSo, she decided to earn her EdD in Educational Leadership from SNHU. As she walked across the stage at SNHU's 2023 Spring Commencement, she hoped anyone earning their degree would see her and be inspired to pursue their doctorate.\n\nDoctoral degrees can take up to 7-years of intense study to complete. After completing doctoral degree coursework, you might sit for comprehensive subject matter exams. A dissertation based on your research interests may also be required and reviewed by a committee of graduate school faculty.\n\nRead more: Is a Doctorate Degree Worth It?\n\nDetermining Your Educational Path\n\nWhile it's true that it's possible to achieve a high-paying job without a degree, it's worth noting that a college degree can significantly enhance your long-term career prospects.* The multitude of degree options available can be overwhelming, but with careful consideration, you can identify the educational path that best suits your needs and ambitions.\n\nEach career has its own unique job requirements, and there are often benefits to remaining in the workforce, building your resume and working toward a college degree simultaneously. Companies may even offer tuition assistance programs that can help you pay for college.\n\nIf you research and reflect on your long-term goals, you’ll be on the path toward finding what type of degree is right for you."
