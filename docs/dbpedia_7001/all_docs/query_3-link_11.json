        "text": "Teachers and other educators can make a profound impact on the lives of others, whether they’re working with a classroom of 5-year-olds, providing skills training to team members at a Fortune 500 company, or designing the curricula for a performing arts camp.\n\nThe field of education reaches far beyond the classroom, and individuals interested in working in education have numerous degrees and career paths to choose from. Education-related professions span everything from corporate trainers to camp directors to high school science teachers.\n\nAdditionally, different types of education degrees, such as a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Master of Education (MEd), or a Doctorate of Education (EdD) can prepare graduates with in-demand expertise and skills. These include specialized knowledge pertaining to their major and soft skills such as communication skills, critical thinking skills, and time management skills that are transferable to a wide variety of careers in the public, private, nonprofit, and government sectors.\n\nWhat Is the Field of Education?\n\nEducation isn’t limited to teaching positions. What the education field is encompasses a broad range of other career paths as well, in academic research, student development, and curriculum and policy design, among other areas. Students and professionals in this field are often drawn to positions that allow them to support the development and growth of others. Whether they want to work in an elementary school classroom or lead team-building retreats for a large company, job opportunities for education professionals are numerous.\n\nConsequently, one of the first steps an individual should take toward a successful career in education is to determine which type of career path they’re most interested in pursuing. This will help ensure that they choose a degree program that matches their professional goals.\n\nWhy Get a Degree in Education? Education Degree Benefits\n\nStudents interested in pursuing a career in education have a variety of undergraduate degree programs to choose from, as there are multiple degrees applicable to the education sector. Whereas individuals interested in teaching history can start their educational journey by pursuing a bachelor’s degree in US or world history, those interested in working as a high school science teacher may choose to major in biology, chemistry, or physics.\n\nAnother education degree benefit is that individuals interested in pursuing leadership positions in the field can choose from numerous graduate programs, depending on their interests. Aspiring school psychologists may pursue a master’s in counseling, while those interested in teaching English literature at the college level may find that a master’s degree in English aligns better with their career goals.\n\nTeaching Careers\n\nTeachers are in demand. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that employment of all educators, including preschool teachers, elementary school teachers, middle school teachers, high school teachers, and postsecondary teachers, is projected to grow by 10 percent between 2020 and 2030, which is about as fast as the job growth the BLS projects for all occupations during that period.\n\nApproximately 920,500 new jobs are expected to be added during that reporting period. The BLS projects that student enrollment will increase in communities throughout the US and additional teachers will be needed to meet that demand.\n\nPayscale reports that, as of June 2022, the median salary for teachers was approximately $50,200 annually, with earners in the top 10th percentile having a median salary of around $77,000 per year. Actual salaries vary depending on the teacher’s experience level, the geographical region of their position, whether they hold an advanced degree, and the school district they work for.\n\nMost teachers work on-site at a school during the hours that students are present and have an eight- to 10-week break during the summer. They may also have short winter and spring breaks. Additionally, some teachers work evening and weekend hours to grade papers and prepare lesson plans.\n\nNonteaching Roles in Education\n\nThere are many types of education degrees, and teaching isn’t the only thing that graduates can do. One of the reasons why students get degrees in education is that there are many applicable career paths, including the following.\n\nAdmissions Counselor\n\nAdmissions counselors often work with colleges, universities, and private schools to recruit potential students. In addition to evaluating applications to ensure that applicants meet the institution’s enrollment requirements—such as GPA, residency, and educational background requirements—they also conduct applicant interviews, coordinate recruiting events, and organize classroom visits or campus tours.\n\nPayscale reports that, as of June 2022, the median salary for admissions counselors was around $40,000 per year.\n\nTutor\n\nTutors are private teaching instructors who work with students doing the following:\n\nHelp students complete assignments and prepare for tests and exams\n\nHelp students gain a broader understanding of new topics that have been introduced in the classroom\n\nAdminister practice tests\n\nProvide progress reports to students and their parents\n\nDistribute additional teaching materials as needed\n\nAlthough some tutors work with students one on one, others work with small groups.\n\nHigh School Principal\n\nHigh school principals oversee the day-to-day operations and activities of the schools they work for.

Some corporate trainers work full time for one organization, while others work with different companies for a set period of time as a consultant.\n\nPayscale reports that, as of June 2022, the median base salary for corporate trainers was around $57,800 annually.\n\nCamp Director\n\nCamp directors oversee and manage the day-to-day operations and activities of day camps, sleep-away camps, and recreational camps.

For example, at the undergraduate level, students can choose to major in English, psychology, sociology, education, history, a foreign language, science, math, or engineering. Most bachelor’s degrees require students to complete approximately 120 credit hours of coursework prior to graduation, and most full-time students find they can complete their undergraduate studies in approximately four years.\n\nEducators interested in pursuing leadership roles who are looking into master’s and doctoral degree programs can choose from several degree options as well, depending on their interests. Similar to the completion timeline for a baccalaureate degree, the time it takes to complete a master’s or doctoral degree can vary based on the credit hour requirement of the program they’re enrolled in and whether they’re enrolled as a part-time or full-time student.\n\nExamples of postgraduate education degrees and their admissions requirements include the following:\n\nMaster of Arts in Teaching (MAT)\n\nA Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree program is an advanced degree program that’s designed to prepare future educators for both licensure and specialized career paths in the teaching profession. Credit hour requirements for MAT programs vary widely from school to school. Some programs require students to complete a minimum of 28 credit hours to be eligible to graduate, while other programs require as many as 42 credit hours.\n\nAdditionally, as MAT programs allow students to choose from a variety of specializations, some specializations require more credit hours than others. Specializations for MAT programs include the following:\n\nEarly Childhood Education: This concentration prepares educators with advanced expertise in teaching methodologies for prekindergarten through third-grade classrooms.\n\nElementary Education: This general education program specialization is designed for individuals interested in working with elementary school-aged children in grades one to six.\n\nLanguage Arts: This concentration teaches best practices for teaching the English language, including reading, writing, and literature studies.\n\nMathematics: Teachers interested in gaining advanced knowledge and skills for teaching mathematics to students in grades five to 12 may find that a concentration in mathematics aligns best with their career goals.\n\nMiddle School Education: This general education track is designed for teachers interested in working with students in grades four to eight.\n\nScience: A concentration in science prepares graduates to teach courses such as biology, earth and space science, chemistry, and physics.\n\nSecondary Education: Individuals who opt for this specialization will receive generalized knowledge in teaching subjects such as biological science, English, social sciences, and mathematics to students in grades nine to 12.\n\nSpecial Education: This specialization is designed for students interested in working with special needs students, such as those who have learning or physical disabilities.\n\nAdmissions Requirements for an MAT\n\nThe admissions requirements for Master of Arts in Teaching programs depend on the school.

They also address designing strategies for allocating resources, such as budget and staff resources, to support student learning.\n\nThe curriculum of a Master of Education in Education Policy and Leadership program often includes courses such as Educational Leadership and Organizational Change, Education and Public Policy, Quantitative Research in Education, Education Law and Policy, and Education Program and Policy Implementation.\n\nSimilar to the credit hour requirement for a MAT degree, the credit hour requirement for a Master of Education in Education Policy and Leadership also varies from school to school.
