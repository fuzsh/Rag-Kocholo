They indicate that the project has reached a certain national and European standard.\n\nNational Quality Labels\n\nDoes your eTwinning project have common goals and a shared plan?\n\nHas it finished or is in its last stages?\n\nHave you and your students contributed to all the project’s activities?\n\nHave you and your partners organised collaborative activities?\n\nHave you taken into consideration data protection and copyright issues?\n\nIf the answer is YES to all five requirements, then why don’t you apply for a National Quality Label?\n\nAll projects are evaluated by taking into account five criteria. To be eligible for a Quality Label (national and/or European), you need to achieve at least the minimum points set in all the following sub-criteria:\n\nstrategies for online collaboration among pupils from the partner schools\n\nthe choice and use of ICT (all digital technological tools)\n\nGDPR, copyright and eSafety issues.\n\nHow to apply?\n\nlog into the eTwinning area in ESEP\n\ngo to Projects\n\nfind your project and click on Apply for a Quality Label\n\ncomplete all the boxes with all the required information and provide evidence of your work\n\nYou can follow all the above steps for each of your projects that you think deserve a Quality Label, but you cannot apply for more than four projects during one school year.\n\nPlease note that only your first four projects submissions will be taken into consideration and evaluated by your NSO. Make sure to carefully select projects that you think deserve a Quality Label.\n\nOnly European projects (with founders from two different countries) can apply for a National Quality Label. National projects (with founders from the same country) cannot apply for a National Quality Label even if at a later stage they add partners from another country.\n\nUseful tips\n\nComplete all the information first in a Word document and then copy paste your answers to the application form. This will prevent you losing what you have written in the form if it takes more than 30 minutes to complete! Provide more information for the non-visible aspects of your project as the evaluators will see all the visible work in your TwinSpace.\n\nThe Quality Label is granted to the teacher, and it is personal. Even if you work with other colleagues in your school on the same project, each of you should apply for a Quality Label and present how he/she has contributed to the project. The Quality Label is granted to the teachers who contributed actively and visibly to the project’s activities.\n\nWhy apply?\n\nThe Quality Label provides:\n\na concrete evaluation based on a common pedagogical framework;\n\nan opportunity for teachers to improve their project work.\n\nWho grants the Quality Label?\n\nThe National Support Organisation (NSO) in each country evaluates applications from schools for the National Quality Label. Labels are awarded throughout the year, however, in some countries, deadlines are fixed, so be sure to consult your NSO for information about the deadlines in your country. Once the application is accepted or rejected, your NSO will contact you.\n\nCriteria for Quality Labels\n\nUse the checklist below when planning and implementing your project to check if your project meets the Quality Label criteria.\n\nCollaboration between partner schools:\n\ncollaboration activities go beyond communication;\n\npartner schools work together to accomplish joint activities;\n\npartners are not just recipients of information;\n\ncollaborative activities result in a tangible outcome.\n\nUse of technology:\n\nthe technology is used to help partners achieve their pedagogical objectives;\n\nthe tools help partners to collaborate better among themselves.\n\nPedagogical approaches:\n\nthe project has originality in terms of its theme;\n\nit uses a variety of pedagogical methods;\n\npupils are the ones who take the lead;\n\npupils interact with their partners and work collaboratively using different methods like information gathering, problem solving, research and comparative work;\n\npupils take different roles as artists, journalists, technicians, scientists, actors, etc.\n\nCurricular integration:\n\nthe project is rooted in the school curriculum and syllabi;\n\nthe majority of project work is done during the school hours;\n\nthe curricular integration in the project is clear;\n\nproject work allows students develop their skills and competences;\n\nthe project-based pedagogical framework has been explained and documented by the teacher.\n\nResults and documentation:\n\nMake sure that:\n\nthe project results are presented online;\n\nstudents are involved in the TwinSpace;\n\nall steps of the project are documented, including planning, descriptions of activities, evaluation and feedback;\n\nyou evaluate and publish the impact that the project had on the students and teachers involved in the project;\n\nyou use the checklist when planning and implementing your project to check if your project meets the QL criteria.\n\nDownload the infosheet eTwinning National Quality Label\n\nUse the checklist when planning and implementing your project to check if your project meets the QL criteria."
