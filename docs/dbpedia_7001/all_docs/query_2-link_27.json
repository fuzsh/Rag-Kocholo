        "text": "What is Concept-Based Inquiry?\n\nConcept-Based Inquiry brings together two distinct pedagogical practices; Inquiry-Based Learning and Concept-Based Learning. Inquiry-based learning has a focus on the use of active questions to drive learning. Students are invited to take an active role in both posing and answering questions as they construct meaning.\n\nWhen we pair this with Concept-Based Learning, those questions are designed to focus on transferable understandings that help students to make sense of their learning. This approach helps students to see patterns, make connections, and ultimately, are able to apply their learning beyond the context of the unit. This is what we all want for our students at the end of the day!\n\nConcept-Based Inquiry is an approach to teaching and learning that can be applied to any disciplinary or interdisciplinary curriculum K-12. By engaging students as thinkers, we foster student agency, build conceptual understanding, and promote learning transfer.\n\nSource:Professional Learning International Blog\n\nThis episode is from Toddle's \"School Leadership Project\"\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nThis podcast is a perfect primer for both teachers and leaders who want to understand the thinking behind developing meaningful and relevant concept-based units of inquiry.\n\nIn the podcast, Rachel French delves into the crucial aspects of effective concept-based inquiry. She underscores the significance of fostering student curiosity through acknowledging and nurturing their questions. Concepts' role in teaching, along with the utility of case studies for enhanced comprehension, takes center stage. Seeking mentors, incorporating essential ideas into curriculum planning, and utilizing diverse understandings within a study unit emerge as essential practices.\n\nRachel emphasizes connecting ideas across disciplines meaningfully, cautioning against forced integration. Notably, she examines levels of understanding drawn from texts and advocates for teaching diverse skills to grasp content comprehensively.\n\nThe podcast touches on comprehending rules across disciplines, valuing evidence and persistence for building understanding, and nurturing open-mindedness through case studies. Techniques like the four corner debate are proposed, as is the balance between structured planning and adaptive teaching. The guidance of students' case study choices, crafting meaningful and rigorous inquiry units, and expressing gratitude are also discussed.\n\nOverall, the video encapsulates pivotal strategies for effective inquiry-based learning implementation, underscoring the fostering of curiosity, strategic planning, interdisciplinary connections, and varied skill development.\n\n** The book Rachel mentioned in the podcast: Concept-Based Inquiry in Action: Strategies to Promote Transferable Understanding\n\nKey Ideas\n\nFostering Curiosity: Encouraging student questions is pivotal in inquiry-based learning, cultivating their curiosity and engagement.\n\nConcept-Centric Teaching: Emphasizing the role of concepts in both teaching and learning facilitates a deeper understanding of subjects.\n\nCase Studies Enhance Learning: Utilizing case studies effectively aids in profound comprehension and application of knowledge.\n\nMentorship and Thought Partners: Teachers benefit from seeking mentors and thought partners to refine their teaching approaches.\n\nStrategic Curriculum Planning: Writing essential ideas into curriculum planning ensures a clear and coherent learning trajectory.\n\nDiverse Understandings: Incorporating multiple perspectives within a study unit enriches students' comprehension and critical thinking.\n\nInterdisciplinary Connections: Creating meaningful connections between concepts across different disciplines deepens students' appreciation of knowledge.\n\nBalanced Integration: While interdisciplinary learning is valuable, forced integration should be avoided for the sake of coherence.\n\nComprehension Strategies: Teaching a range of skills and strategies equips students to fully comprehend complex texts.\n\nAdaptive Teaching Approach: Balancing planned curriculum with responsive teaching ensures effective adaptation to students' needs and progress.\n\nThis post is an excerpt from a post entitled “Don’t lock me into 8 key concepts” by Shannon O’Dwyer. The full post explains concepts in a nutshell and why concept-driven teaching is both easy and hard. This excerpt provides an insight into how teachers can make it happen.\n\nConcepts in a Nutshell\n\nConcepts are over-arching mental constructs that students need to make sense of the content we teach. Conceptual understanding enables students to apply facts and skills to the world around them. By starting with concepts, we create a curriculum that’s worthy of our students’ time and effort. The concepts that drive the PYP are timeless (factual examples change, but not the core understanding), universal (so students can apply understandings across cultures, situations and disciplines) and abstract (so students engage in higher order thinking to grapple with central ideas).\n\nBy helping students achieve conceptual understanding, we ensure that they can take facts and skills, and do something with them beyond this moment, this lesson and this classroom. I have seen plenty of students who can accurately convert between metres & centimetres but are unable to choose an appropriate length of skipping rope for a 3-person playground game. These students had mastered a mathematical skill in isolation, but not yet developed a conceptual understanding of length.\n\nWhy Concept-Driven Teaching is Hard\n\nIt’s just so messy. Concept-driven learning is an iterative process of constantly pulling apart ideas, putting them back together, re-applying them to different situations, finding ways to correct misconceptions and enabling each child to make meaning in their own way. It would be a lot easier to say, “Here’s what you need to know, practise that, now you get a sticker.” The problem is that you’d have to add, “Good luck applying that to your life”. Factual knowledge is easy to teach because it is simple, procedural and locked in situ. But unless your students intend to live forever in their 4th Grade classroom, that knowledge is utterly useless to them.\n\n“How Can I Make it Happen?”\n\nQuestions\n\nUse teacher and student questions as a springboard for deep, conceptual dialogue. Sort, unpack and challenge students’ questions. Discuss open vs. closed questions, abstract vs. concrete questions, fat vs. thin questions (ie 1 answer or many). Keep asking probing questions (such as How do you know..?/reflection) to prevent shallow understanding.\n\nProblematic Knowledge\n\nDesign resources and situations that are problematic. Perhaps the facts do not add up, or there are pieces of information missing. This challenges students to search for connections, inferences and transference to make sense of the inquiry. Anything that is non-linear, with multiple solutions and multiple interpretations helps our students build the flexibility of thinking to grapple with complexity, change and abstraction.\n\nInquire\n\nEvery day! Make sure you devote enough time for students to actually do the learning and construct the understanding. They need ample time for wondering, trying, tinkering, playing, researching and coming to conclusions. Don’t step away. Be a participant who says, “Why did you…?”, “What would happen if…?”\n\nIntegrate\n\nWork with single-subject teachers to develop integrated thinking. Students should take their understandings from class to class, exploring concepts through different content and perspectives (eg symphony orchestras and bus timetables both build an understanding of systems). Try to keep concepts at the core of your planning meetings, to avoid creating shallow, thematic units. Avoid throwing together “linked activities”. If the students are studying Ancient Greece, don’t immediately say, “Let’s make pots!”. Perhaps the most important concept is “legacies” and students investigate the influence of the golden ratio on both Art and Mathematics. While studying natural disasters, let students make paper mache volcanoes at home. In class, explore the concept of “impact” on geography, individual lives and communities. How do artists help communities remember and heal after a natural disaster?”\n\nShannon is a PYP educator, whose passions include curriculum design, literacy and ESOL practices, enrichment and technology integration. Shannon loves working in PYP classrooms, where each day is filled with the questions, problems and discoveries of young minds. She blogs atshannonodwyer.com and tweets @S_ODwyer."
