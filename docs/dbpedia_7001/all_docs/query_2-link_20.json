        "text": "In common parlance the word 'learning' carries at least two meanings. There is a general one of some kind of change, often in knowledge but also in behavior. However, learning cannot be defined merely in terms of changes in behavior. But there is also a more intense sense of the verb 'to learn' meaning to memorize, to learn by heart (Roger, 2003, p.86).\n\nTo say that 'learning is change' is too simple. Not all change is learning. What we usually mean by 'learning' are those more or less permanent changes and reinforcements brought about voluntarily in one's patterns of acting, thinking and/or feeling (Roger, 2003, p.86).\n\nAccording to Ambrose et al. (2010, p.3):\n\nLearning is a process, not a product\n\nLearning is a change in knowledge, beliefs, behaviors or attitudes\n\nLearning is not something done to students, but something that students themselves do\n\nThere have been several attempts to describe the different areas of learning change. The traditional distinction has been between learning knowledge and learning skills; but others have elaborated on this.Several point to the need to include attitudes as a third area. In the field of learning objectives, knowledge, skills and attitudes (KSA) is a well-worn path (Rogers, 2003, p.86).\n\nKurst Lewin (1935) suggested that learning changes occur\n\nin skills,\n\nin cognitive patterns (knowledge and understanding),\n\nin motivation and interest, and\n\nin ideology (fundamental beliefs) (Rogers, 2003, p.86).\n\nRobert M. Gagn√© (1972) identified the following five domains or types of learning outcomes:\n\nmotor skills which require practice,\n\nverbal information - facts, principles and generalizations which when organized into larger entities become knowledge,\n\nintellectual skills - the 'discriminations, concepts and rules' that help in using knowledge,\n\ncognitive strategies - the way the individuals learns, remembers and thinks, the self-managed skills needed to define and solve problems, and\n\nattitudes (Rogers, 2003, pp.86-87)."
