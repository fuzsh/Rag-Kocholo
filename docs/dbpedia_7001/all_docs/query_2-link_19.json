        "text": "What is an\n\nEducation System\n\nAn education system is an arrangement that consists of at least one teacher and one student in a context, such as in a tutorial or via Skype. Education systems must be intentional, where a teacher actively attempts to guide student learning. Education systems encompass all institutions that are concerned with educating students who are in K-12 and higher education. For students, the education system encompasses elementary school, middle school, high school and then college or university. Many often wonder who created the U.S. education system. The U.S. education system wasn’t created by a single individual but rather evolved over time through the contributions of various educational reformers, lawmakers, and social movements. Key figures in its development include: Horace Mann, often referred to as the “Father of the American Public School System,” Thomas Jefferson, who firmly believed that education citizenry was essential for the success of the republic and John Dewey, who promoted progressive education and advocated for experiential learning.\n\nAn education system refers to the economic and social factors that typically make up public schools at the federal, state or community levels. Such factors include public funding, school facilities, staffing, compensation, employee benefits, teaching resources and more. Education systems refer to the coordination of individuals (among teachers, administrators and students), infrastructure (including safe facilities and transportation) and functioning institutions and processes. Many institutions adopted online education systems in March 2020 in light of emergency remote teaching due to COVID-19. The online education system meant students could learn from anywhere in the world from their personal devices. The cons to online education systems include limited social interaction among peers and fewer opportunities for hands-on learning.\n\nAn education system encompasses the structure and opportunities for education within a country, including institutions from family and early childhood education through kindergarten, primary, secondary, and tertiary schools, such as lyceums, colleges, and universities. It also covers continuous professional and personal education and private educational institutions. While regulated by national laws, some aspects may be unregulated, aiming to provide education for all societal sections. UNESCO’s International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) recognizes nine education levels. These include 0. Early childhood education, 1. Primary education, 2. Lower secondary education, 3. Upper secondary education, 4. Post-secondary non-tertiary education, 5. Short-cycle tertiary education, 6. Bachelor’s or equivalent level, 7. Master’s or equivalent level and 8. Doctoral or equivalent level.\n\nIn the U.S. education system, students earn credits for courses, which count towards completing their program. Courses are categorized into “core” subjects for foundational knowledge, “major” courses for specialization, and “elective” courses for exploring other interests. The U.S. education system calendar runs from September to May, divided into two semesters of 16–18 weeks, though some institutions use a quarter or trimester system of 10–12 weeks. With a wide range of higher education options, students can find programs that meet their academic, financial, and personal needs. In the context of higher education, nearly 4,000 accredited institutions make up the U.S. education system."
