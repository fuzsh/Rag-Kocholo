        "text": "by Rachel French\n\nWelcome to our new ‘Myth Busters’ blog series, where we aim to debunk common misconceptions related to Concept-Based Inquiry (Marschall & French, 2018).\n\nDispelling these misbeliefs is crucial so that educators like yourself are able to unlock the power of a Concept-Based Curriculum (Erickson, Lanning and French, 2017).\n\nIt is our mission to help teachers all over the world understand Concept-Based Inquiry so they can support their students in seeing patterns, making connections and transferring learning.\n\nSo, with that being said, let’s jump right into one of the most common misconceptions!\n\nMyth 1: It is the concepts that are important – not the facts and skills!\n\nI often wonder if this first false notion originated from a teacher hoping to be relieved of the textbook coverage burden.\n\nOr, perhaps we assume that we can ask Google or Siri anything so there is no longer a need to learn facts…\n\nIn reality, this idea could not be further from the truth! Facts and skills are critical in a Concept-Based Inquiry.\n\nWithout real factual examples, we can’t expect students to fully understand a concept or conceptual ideas!\n\nJohn Medina (2014) relates a lack of factual grounding to “playing intellectual air guitar” (p. 38).\n\nThe Structure of Knowledge and The Structure of Process\n\nIn order to truly appreciate the importance of facts and skills in a Concept-Based Curriculum, we must understand how knowledge and processes are structured.\n\nThe Structure of Knowledge and The Structure of Process\n\nShared with permission © Erickson (1995) and Lanning (2012).\n\nIn 1995, Dr. Lynn Erickson created a graphic representation of the ‘Structure of Knowledge’ and in 2012, Dr. Lois Lanning developed the complementary model the Structure of Process. Together the two structures provide a complete model of Concept-Based Curriculum.\n\nThe design of rigorous and engaging curriculum requires an understanding of the different levels of both the Structure of Knowledge and the Structure of Process and the interplay between each level in curriculum design (Erickson, Lanning and French, 2017).\n\nUsing the Structures of Knowledge and Process (Erickson & Lanning, 2014) we work from the bottom up; lower levels of the model provide the foundation for understanding concepts and articulating the relationships between concepts in the form of generalizations.\n\n“Skipping over” the lower parts of each model ends in the creation of understandings that are inaccurate or overgeneralized.\n\nMyth busted…\n\nThere is a common saying that many school curriculums are “an inch deep and a mile wide.” So, if you feel you are racing to cover content, know that you are not alone!\n\nThe effective implementation of a three-dimensional, Concept-Based model in the classroom will actually HELP in reducing curriculum overload. A Concept-Based Inquiry approach builds brain schema for connecting new knowledge onto prior conceptual structures in the brain.\n\nSo you see, as facts and skills are the foundation for understanding concepts and building conceptual understanding, it is an absolute myth that” facts and skills are not important in Concept-Based Inquiry.”\n\nJoin us for our next blog in the series, looking at why “bigger” is not always better!\n\nRachel French\n\nConcept-Based Consultant and Coach\n\nBestselling Author\n\nDirector of Professional Learning International and Co-founder of Connect the Dots International\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ProLearnInt\n\nFacebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/conceptbasedinquiry\n\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-french-pli/\n\nReferences\n\nErickson, H., & Lanning, L.
