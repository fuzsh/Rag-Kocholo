        "text": "When planning for college and your educational future, it's important to consider all the steps between you and your goals. Chief among these is the depth of knowledge you'd like to attain on a given subject. Are you looking to lay the basic groundwork for a career change or to forge new ideas in your field?\n\nHow you answer that question can largely determine the degree — or degrees — you choose to pursue. College degree levels progress in terms of academic achievement. Knowing the types of college degree levels in order can help you determine just how far you'd like to take your academic studies and which ones may be right for you based on your prior educational journey.\n\nIt's also important to consider each degree type's time and financial requirements, and a given degree's impact on your career prospects. You might, for example, research what education is typically required for a position in your desired field and which degrees can help you gain skills to potentially move forward in your career. This can help you figure out the degree level you need to pursue your goals.\n\nIn terms of level of study, the college degree programs in order are:\n\nAssociate degree\n\nBachelor’s degree\n\nMaster’s degree\n\nDoctoral degree\n\nIt’s important to think of college degree levels in order for a few reasons. For starters, knowledge for a bachelor’s degree differs dramatically from what’s required for a doctoral degree. Moving through the degrees in order allows you to leverage previous academic knowledge to address new challenges. Prior education can form a strong foundation for future learning.\n\nIt's also important to consider the different time and financial requirements of each degree level and a given degree’s impact on your career prospects. You might, for example, research what education is typically required for a position in your desired field. This can help you determine the level of education you need to earn to reach your goals.\n\nBoth AA and AS degrees can provide an entry point into a field of study. Students can build on the credits earned and knowledge gained in these programs and go on to earn a bachelor’s degree to further their studies.\n\nAn associate degree is a good option for those who want to earn a degree in a shorter time and aren’t ready for a four-year program. However, the number of credits students can transfer will depend on the institution offering the bachelor’s degree and the course of study chosen.\n\nExamples of AA and AS degrees:\n\nBusiness Fundamentals associate degree\n\nCriminal Justice associate degree\n\nCybersecurity associate degree\n\nIf you're looking for work, chances are you've noticed that a common prerequisite for employment in many fields is the completion of a bachelor's degree program. With this degree, you demonstrate a strong, foundational level of know-how related to your field.\n\nOf all the college degree levels, jobs requiring a bachelor’s degree have the largest projected growth through 2026, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). A bachelor's degree is typically designed to take about four years to complete, though students sometimes take longer. During that time, students take a deep dive into their field of study, often taking several semesters' worth of courses that include lectures, examinations and hands-on experience.\n\nIn a traditional four-year bachelor's degree program, students take general education classes primarily during their first two years of schooling. These classes are meant to give students a broad base of knowledge outside their specialization. In the second two years, they take classes that are more focused on the area of study related to their interests and career goals.\n\nMany students choose to satisfy their general education requirements by taking these classes at a community college. They can then use those credits when transferring to and being admitted to a college or university.\n\nTransferability of credit is at the discretion of the receiving institution. It's the student's responsibility to confirm whether credits earned at University of Phoenix will be accepted by another institution of the student's choice.\n\nAs opposed to the more philosophical nature of a BA that focuses on the humanities, a Bachelor of Science tends to focus more on technical and scientific areas of a discipline. While some subjects (like business) can be studied in both BA and BS programs, the latter will likely focus more on a singular path of study with less emphasis on courses in other subjects.\n\nIf you have a specific academic focus and career path in mind and aren't as interested in learning about other liberal arts subjects, then a BS program may be more aligned with your goals. These programs tend to hone in on the practical application of a course of study, in which you gain abilities and expertise you can apply immediately when you enter the workforce.\n\nExamples:\n\nAccounting bachelor's degree\n\nBusiness Administration bachelor's degree\n\nHealth Management bachelor's degree\n\nWondering what types of college degrees you can earn after a bachelor's degree?\n\nWhile many students stop after earning an undergraduate degree, other graduates — motivated by employment requirements or simply a curious mind — opt to go back to college to go further with their subject of choice.\n\nTypically, master's programs require successful completion of 30 to 60 semester credits. Some master's programs are shorter and can be earned in a year, depending on the college and how many classes the student takes.\n\nRegardless of which program you choose, it should be noted that a bachelor's degree in a relevant field of study is almost always a prerequisite to pursuing a master's degree.\n\nClasses in a master's degree program are more rigorous than in a bachelor's degree program. The classes often build upon the knowledge gained during a bachelor's degree program and introduce students to more specialized and distinct subjects in their field of study.\n\nThe class sizes tend to run on the smaller side compared with undergraduate classes, and they might emphasize group discussions with instructor guidance instead of instructor-led lectures. They may also require more projects, including a capstone or thesis project.\n\nThree common types of master's degrees are:\n\nMaster of Arts (MA)\n\nMaster of Science (MS)\n\nMaster of Fine Arts (MFA)\n\nFor brevity, we won't break down the differences between the types of master's degrees, but the distinction is essentially the same as those between the bachelor's degrees. An MA tends to focus on subjects in the arts, MFAs emphasize a narrower field study in the fine arts, and the MS focuses on a scientific subject and its practical applications.\n\nIn addition to those listed above, here are more types of master's degrees:\n\nMaster of Business Administration (MBA)\n\nMaster of Library Science (MLS)\n\nMaster of Public Administration (MPA)\n\nMaster of Public Health (MPH)\n\nMaster of Social Work (MSW)\n\nMaster of Laws (LLM)\n\nMaster of Arts in Liberal Studies (MLS)\n\nMaster of Music (MM)\n\nMaster of Education (MEd)\n\nMaster of Engineering (MEng)\n\nMaster of Architecture (MArch)\n\nEach type represents a specialization within a field, whether that be an MPH for public health or an MSW for social work. While the curriculum, rigor, and requirements of each master's program differ, they commonly require a bachelor's degree in the field of study or a related field. In addition, some programs require professional experience in the given field.\n\nSome master’s degrees, such as the MSW and the MPH, may also have a fieldwork requirement in which students work in a real-world setting.\n\nThe most commonly known and recognized doctoral degree is the Doctor of Philosophy, or PhD. Despite the name, these degrees are not exclusively conferred on students of philosophy. Instead, a PhD is a research degree that can be completed in a number of subjects, including science, math, the humanities, business and social science.\n\nLess focused on applying learned skills in the marketplace, research in a PhD program is focused on enriching and furthering knowledge in a specific field. Original research is often a requirement for graduation in this kind of program. PhD students often work at the outer bounds of their field to uncover new discoveries and insights.\n\nIn contrast to PhDs, other doctoral degrees focus on practical applications within a specific industry, similar to the difference between a BA and a BS. University of Phoenix, for example, does not offer PhD programs; rather, its doctoral degrees are designed for scholar-practitioners.\n\nExamples:\n\nDoctor of Business Administration (DBA)\n\nDoctor of Health Administration (DHA)\n\nDoctor of Education (EdD)\n\nDoctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)\n\nDoctor of Management (DM)\n\nHow to choose degree levels to pursue\n\nKnowing the types of college degree levels can help you feel better equipped to plot out your educational future. Which degrees you choose and how many you decide to earn throughout your career depends on your goals. Many people also decide to change careers at some point, which may mean earning a different degree or level of degree. Ready to start your educational journey?
