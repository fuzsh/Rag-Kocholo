        "text": "Bullying\n\nThis suite of resources addresses many of the root causes of bullying – from a perpetrator’s background, through to dealing with stress and trauma. We invite all young people to understand where they fit into the bullying narrative, and what they can do to change that.\n\nDigital Literacy\n\nThis series of lessons focuses on allowing students to engage critically with what they are seeing, sharing and participating in online – so that they can be given the agency to make healthy, safe choices within their chosen landscape.\n\nGender Stereotypes\n\nThis series of lessons looks to tackle gender stereotypes as one of the root causes of bullying, encouraging our young people to ditch the labels that hold them back, freeing them to be their own person, on their own terms.\n\nMental Health\n\nAcross this module students will develop appropriate language to talk about mental health and learn to recognise signs of stress and common mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression in themselves and others. They will acquire personalised strategies to navigate their emotions and boost mental wellbeing, before learning how to have ‘Brave Talk’ with a friend or loved one who may be struggling with their mental health.\n\nOnline Challenges\n\nThis series of lessons aims to empower young people with the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary to protect them from negative influence and choose alternative, positive online behaviour.\n\nUnconscious Bias\n\nThese lessons will help students to understand unconscious bias, the ways it impacts and affects us all and provide them with tools to untrain negative messaging that leads to prejudiced and hateful behaviour both on and offline. These skills and strategies can then be taken beyond their education and throughout their futures across wider society."
