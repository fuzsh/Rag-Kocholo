It provides students with a way to recognize the relationships between words and concepts using their prior knowledge about a topic. The list-group-label strategy can be used before and after students read.\n\nWhy use list-group-label?\n\nIt helps students organize their understanding of specific vocabulary and concepts.\n\nIt builds on students’ prior knowledge about a topic.\n\nIt actively engages students in learning new vocabulary and content by activating their critical thinking skills.\n\nIt teaches categorizing and labeling skills.\n\nHow to use list-group-label\n\n1. List\n\nIntroduce a topic from a unit of study or recent read-aloud.\n\nHave students brainstorm all the words they can think of that are related to that topic.\n\nVisually display student responses.\n\nAt this point do not critique student responses. Some words may not reflect the main concept, but hopefully students will realize this as they begin grouping the words in the next step.\n\n2. Group\n\nDivide your class into small groups. Each group will work to cluster the class list of words into subcategories.\n\nAs groups of words emerge, challenge your students to explain their reasoning for placing words together or discarding them.\n\n3. Label\n\nInvite students to suggest a descriptive title or label for the groups of words they have formed. These labels should relate to their reasons for the grouping.\n\nIf you did the activity with small groups, bring the class together to discuss how they grouped and labeled their words.\n\nWatch a lesson (whole class, grade 2)\n\nGo inside Cathy Doyle’s second grade classroom in Evanston, Illinois to observe her students learning the list-group-label strategy. Cathy builds the lesson around the concept of gardening, based on a recent classroom read-aloud, The Gardener. Joanne Meier, our research director, introduces the strategy and highlights the vocabulary and comprehension skills that list-group-label supports.\n\nCollect resources\n\nList-group-label graphic organizer (opens in a new window)\n\nDifferentiate instruction\n\nFor second language learners, students of varying reading skill, and younger learners\n\nAsk students to return to their lists as they read through the text related to the major concept they brainstormed about. They may find they should add words from their reading or re-label the groups of words they created.\n\nEncourage students to discuss lists with others outside their initial small group.\n\nHave students write the lists or type them using a word processing program.\n\nProvide students with pre-established categories to use to group words.\n\nCreate graphical representations of words in order to help students connect to prior knowledge.\n\nAsk students to create their own drawings to accompany the words.\n\nExtend the learning\n\nScience\n\nThis example shows how the list-group-label strategy can be used with learning about living and non-living earth systems.
