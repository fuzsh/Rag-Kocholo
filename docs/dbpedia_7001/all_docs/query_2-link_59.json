Concept sorts ask students to think about what they know as they compare and contrast it to new information. They are a fun and interactive way to introduce and review vocabulary and concepts across disciplines.",

        "text": "Tips for success\n\nHow do you decide if you should use open or closed sorts? It depends on your students and the topics. With open sorting students freely sort concepts into categories they determine on their own and are “open” to make as many or as few categories as they think are needed to explain the concepts/words. Adolescent learners often love open sorting but students with limited vocabulary or conceptual knowledge benefit from the categories being initially provided (closed sorts).\n\nDo you just use words or pictures in a sort? As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. We often think of picture sorts (a type of concept sorts) for younger learners but given age appropriate pictures, mixing picture and words within a sort can be an engaging approach to preview and review concepts with your adolescent learners.\n\nWith all sorts it is vital that students not just sort things into categories, but consider why they sorted them in a particular way. For both open and closed sorts you want to model how to explain to a partner or small group your sorting decisions.\n\nUsing a non-academic sort is usually a fun way to introduce or review the idea of concept sorting to students and expectations for comparative analysis. Here are two example, concept sorts that are a fun way to introduce the idea of learning what something is by what it’s not (e.g., sorting). Make sure to ask students what kind of conversations they had with their partners and small groups about how they sorted. Were they in complete agreement or did they have to talk about how a few of the concepts/pictures/words should be sorted and why? The conversation matters!\n\nAre you a foodie?\n\nStar Wars vs. Star Trek\n\nHere is how one middle school teacher introduces concept sorts with her students each fall."
