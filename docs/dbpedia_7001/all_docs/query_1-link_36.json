        "text": "STRATEGY FOCUS\n\nList-Group-Label\n\nPURPOSE\n\nList-Group-Label helps students identify, organize, and connect important content. This strategy builds on students’ prior knowledge and activates critical thinking. Through the use of this strategy, students are better able to organize new concepts as they relate to previously learned content while developing their categorizing and labeling skills.\n\nPROCESS\n\nSelect a reading selection, vocabulary list, or other artifact related to the current unit of study (text, picture, quote, cartoon, map, etc.).\n\nDivide students into groups of two or three. Provide each group with materials such as paper, sticky notes, or index cards for their List-Group-Label.\n\nStudents work together to brainstorm and record a list of words related to the content.\n\nStudents work together to group the words into categories based on their understanding of or connections to the content. Note that there are no right or wrong answers here, as long as students can justify their groupings. Students should determine a label for each group of words.\n\nHave each group of students share their List-Group-Label work while explaining their justification for the words selected, how they grouped them, and the labels they provided.\n\nEngage the whole class in a discussion about the similarities and differences found amongst the group work. Ask students, “In what ways was the thinking alike? In what ways was the thinking different? What changes might you make to your work after considering the work of your peers?”\n\nPROBING QUESTIONS\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\nWhat additional artifacts might you add to your groupings?\n\nWhat different perspectives did you discover that you hadn’t previously considered?\n\nHow did the process support your own thought processes?\n\nConsider using an Alphablocks organizer for the listing phase of List-Group-Label to help students keep their words (or list) organized.\n\nThe teacher can provide students with a predetermined list of words in order to see how different groups organize the same list of words similarly and differently.\n\nList-Group-Label work can serve as content for Gallery Walk.\n\nCONTENT APPLICATIONS\n\nENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS\n\nBefore reading Night by Elie Wiesel, students are presented with the word ‘Holocaust’ and asked to brainstorm words, phrases, or ideas related to Holocaust and place them into groups.\n\nSOCIAL STUDIES\n\nBefore learning about early civilizations, students are provided with a variety of terms they will encounter in the unit and use List-Group-Label to place them in groups.\n\nARTS & HUMANITIES\n\nStudents are provided with a wide variety of art from different time periods or different artists and work to place them into groups, determining a label for each one.\n\nWORLD LANGUAGES\n\nDuring a unit about animals, students work in pairs or triads to group their vocabulary words into categories. This is open-ended in that the students determine how they group the words. Students then give a label to the groups of words that captures why they grouped them together.\n\nSCIENCE\n\nIn the middle of the unit, students complete the list-group-label process with the words from their interactive word wall.\n\nCAREER & TECHNICAL EDUCATION\n\nStudents are provided with a variety of tools or materials that might be used to solve a problem related to a specific unit of study and work to place them into groups, determining a label for each one.\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\nProvide or invite students to record vocabulary from an upcoming or current unit of study. Students work in groups to organize the words.\n\nHEALTH & PHYSICAL EDUCATION\n\nBefore learning about a particular sport, students are provided with a variety of terms they will encounter relative to that sport and use List-Group-Label to place them in groups."
