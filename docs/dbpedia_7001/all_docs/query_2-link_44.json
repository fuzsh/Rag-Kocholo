        "text": "This assignment will be posted on the web as concepts.html.\n\nThe standard 18 concepts are as follows (each team will add two more for a complete set of 20):\n\nSet 1: 6 concepts\n\n(Due with Web Check 1)\n\nAnchored Instruction\n\nA type of instruction in which materials to be learned are linked to a meaningful theme. The theme provides a holistic context for learning diverse concepts and subjects.\n\nAuthentic Activity\n\nPromotes learning in meaningful and realistic ways. The best ones of these allow students the opportunity to do hands-on activities, and control their learning to a certain degree. Provides practice and experience in ways that are valued by society beyond the classroom walls.\n\nAuthentic Assessment\n\nEvaluation that addresses what was learned and the process through which it was learned in a method similar to the practice activities, provides information about the particular tasks at which students succeed or fail, and evaluates tasks that are worthwhile, significant, and meaningful.\n\nCommunities of Learners\n\nTeachers, students, staff members, parents, and others actively and cooperatively work\n\nto help one another learn. Communication is open, participation is widespread, teamwork is prevalent, and diversity is incorporated. All participants share a common sense of purpose, care about, trust, and respect each other, and recognize each other's efforts and accomplishments.\n\nScaffolds\n\nSupport provided to learners in various forms, including (but not limited to) printed or oral guidance, modeling, and questions. Assistance is gradually reduced as the student achieves mastery.\n\nTransfer\n\nThe application of previously learned skills or knowledge to a new task or situation.\n\nSet 2: 6 concepts + one new one from group\n\n(Due with Web Check 2)\n\nCooperative ad Collaborative Learning\n\nA type of learning in which small groups of students complete tasks together, rather than competing against each other. Each student has a role and together, they work toward a common goal.\n\nGenerative Learning\n\nGiven well-planned and carefully constructed scenarios, students identify problems to be solved and learn as they work together to solve them.\n\nMetacognition\n\nThe awareness and monitoring of one’s cognitive processes; understanding one’s own thinking processes; often referred to as “thinking about thinking.”\n\nProblem-based Learning\n\nAuthentic and experiential learning centered around the collaborative investigation and resolution of complex and realistic problems.\n\nSelf-Regulated Learning\n\nThe process of actively monitoring and adjusting one’s thinking and learning. Students who do this generally are intrinsically motivated and actively seek more knowledge, oftentimes using strategic thinking.\n\nSituated Learning and Cognition\n\nAuthentic learning in which practice and exploration of a topic occurs within an actual environment native to the topic.\n\nSet 3: 6 concepts + one new one from group\n\n(Due with Web Check 3)\n\nCognitive Apprenticeship\n\nLearning that provides practice and mentoring regarding certain techniques or methods of thinking and doing.\n\nDistributed Intelligence\n\nThe idea that knowledge exists across a system and that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nMedia Attributes\n\nEach method of delivery (e.g., print, overhead transparency, multimedia computer) has particular characteristics that are advantageous to specific learning situations. Teachers should select the medium that best facilitates the task at hand.\n\nMultiple Perspectives\n\nProvides a fuller understanding of a subject by considering many different sources and points of view. Encourages students to consider and reconcile many sources and positions.\n\nReciprocal Teaching\n\nOften occurs in the form of a dialogue between teachers and students. The student assumes the role of teacher regarding the material being learned. This involves summarizing, generating questions, clarifying, and predicting."
