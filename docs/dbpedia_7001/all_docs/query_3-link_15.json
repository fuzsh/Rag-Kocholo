        "text": "School-family-community partnerships help to improve academic outcomes.\n\nResearch shows that when schools, parents, families, and communities work together, students:\n\nearn higher grades;\n\nattend school more regularly;\n\nstay in school; and,\n\nare more motivated.\n\nThis is true for students of all ages, all backgrounds, and across race and ethnicity. Furthermore, a variety of supports cutting across the spectrum of social, health, and academic needs may be necessary for school success. High quality schools have demonstrated track records connecting with community resources and families to improve student outcomes in all domains of development.\n\nParents who do not speak English or who were educated in other countries may be unfamiliar with expectations for American school involvement.\n\nAlthough schools may interpret lack of involvement of immigrant or non-English speaking families as “not caring” about their children’s education, this is most often NOT the case. Bilingual resources and staff, programs to help parents understand how to support their children’s education, and parent liaisons who can connect the school and families to linguistically and culturally diverse community resources can be highly effective strategies for developing partnerships between schools, families, and the community.\n\nImplementing family and community engagement priorities and strategies early on provides a foundation for future engagement.\n\nFoundations for academic success begin in early childhood and are further developed during elementary school years. Conversely, patterns of failure and disengagement also begin early. For example, struggling readers are likely to continue to experience ongoing difficulties in secondary school if they are not supported early in their development. Continuity with family engagement strategies and partnerships with community programs from Pre-K/Elementary School to middle and high school can help support academic achievement throughout students’ school tenure.\n\nReferences\n\nAdelman, H. & Taylor, L.
