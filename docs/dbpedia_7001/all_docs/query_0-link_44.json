        "text": "Public K-12 teachers are stressed about their jobs and few are optimistic about the future of education; many say poverty, absenteeism and mental health are major problems at their school\n\nPublic K-12 schools in the United States face a host of challenges these days – from teacher shortages to the lingering effects of COVID-19 learning loss to political battles over curriculum.\n\nIn the midst of all this, teachers express low levels of satisfaction with their jobs. In fact, they’re much less satisfied than U.S. workers overall.\n\nHere’s how public K-12 teachers are feeling about their jobs:\n\n77% say their job is frequently stressful.\n\n68% say it’s overwhelming.\n\n70% say their school is understaffed.\n\n52% say they would not advise a young person starting out today to become a teacher.\n\nWhen it comes to how their students are doing in school, teachers are relatively downbeat about both academic performance and behavior.\n\nHere’s how public K-12 teachers rate academic performance and behavior at their school:\n\n48% say the academic performance of most students at their school is fair or poor. A third say it’s good, and only 17% describe it as excellent or very good.\n\n49% say the behavior of most students at their school is fair or poor; 35% say it’s good and 13% say it’s excellent or very good.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic likely compounded these issues. About eight-in-ten teachers (among those who have been teaching for at least a year) say the lasting impact of the pandemic on students’ behavior, academic performance and emotional well-being has been very or somewhat negative.\n\nAssessments of student performance and behavior differ widely by school poverty level. Teachers in high-poverty schools have a much more negative outlook. But feelings of stress and dissatisfaction among teachers are fairly universal, regardless of where they teach.\n\nRelated: What Public K-12 Teachers Want Americans To Know About Teaching\n\nAs they navigate these challenges, teachers don’t feel they’re getting the support or reinforcement they need from parents.\n\nMajorities of teachers say parents are doing too little when it comes to holding their children accountable if they misbehave in school, helping them with their schoolwork and ensuring their attendance.\n\nTeachers in high- and medium-poverty schools are more likely than those in low-poverty schools to say parents are doing too little in each of these areas.\n\nThese findings are based on a survey of 2,531 U.S. public K-12 teachers conducted Oct. 17-Nov. 14, 2023, using the RAND American Teacher Panel. The survey looks at the following aspects of teachers’ experiences:\n\nTeachers’ job satisfaction (Chapter 1)\n\nHow teachers manage their workload (Chapter 2)\n\nProblems students are facing at public K-12 schools (Chapter 3)\n\nChallenges in the classroom (Chapter 4)\n\nTeachers’ views of parent involvement (Chapter 5)\n\nTeachers’ views on the state of public K-12 education (Chapter 6)\n\nProblems students are facing\n\nWe asked teachers about some of the challenges students at their school are facing. Three problems topped the list:\n\nPoverty (53% say this is a major problem among students who attend their school)\n\nChronic absenteeism (49%)\n\nAnxiety and depression (48%)\n\nPoverty cuts across the urban-rural divide, with roughly equal shares of teachers in urban schools (62%) and rural schools (60%) saying this is a major problem among their students. In suburban schools, a smaller share of teachers (42%) say the same.\n\nChronic absenteeism (that is, students missing a substantial number of school days) is a particular challenge at high schools, with 61% of high school teachers saying this is a major problem where they teach. By comparison, 46% of middle school teachers and 43% of elementary school teachers say the same.\n\nAnxiety and depression are viewed as a more serious problem at the secondary school level: 69% of high school teachers and 57% of middle school teachers say this is a major problem among their students, compared with 29% of elementary school teachers.\n\nFewer teachers (20%) view bullying as a major problem at their school, though the share is significantly higher among middle school teachers (34%).\n\nA look inside the classroom\n\nWe also asked teachers how things are going in their classroom and specifically about some of the issues that may get in the way of teaching.\n\n47% of teachers say students showing little or no interest in learning is a major problem in their classroom. The share rises to 58% among high school teachers.\n\n33% say students being distracted by their cellphones is a major problem. This is particularly an issue for high school teachers, with 72% saying this is a major problem.\n\nAbout one-in-five teachers say students getting up and walking around when they’re not supposed to and being disrespectful toward them (21% each) are major problems. Teachers in elementary and middle schools are more likely than those in high schools to see these as challenges.\n\nA majority of teachers (68%) say they’ve experienced verbal abuse from a student – such as being yelled at or threatened. Some 21% say this happens at least a few times a month.\n\nPhysical violence is less common. Even so, 40% of teachers say a student has been violent toward them, with 9% saying this happens at least a few times a month.\n\nAbout two-thirds of teachers (66%) say that the current discipline practices at their school are very or somewhat mild. Only 2% say the discipline practices at their school are very or somewhat harsh, while 31% say they are neither harsh nor mild. Most teachers (67%) say teachers themselves don’t have enough influence in determining discipline practices at their school.\n\nBehavioral issues and mental health challenges\n\nIn addition to their teaching duties, a majority of teachers (58%) say they have to address behavioral issues in their classroom every day. About three-in-ten teachers (28%) say they have to help students with mental health challenges daily.\n\nIn each of these areas, elementary and middle school teachers are more likely than those at the high school level to say they do these things on a daily basis.\n\nAnd teachers in high-poverty schools are more likely than those in medium- and low-poverty schools to say they deal with these issues each day.\n\nCellphone policies and enforcement\n\nMost teachers (82%) say their school or district has policies regarding cellphone use in the classroom.\n\nOf those, 56% say these policies are at least somewhat easy to enforce, 30% say they’re difficult to enforce, and 14% say they’re neither easy nor difficult to enforce.\n\nExperiences with cellphone policies vary widely across school levels. High school teachers (60%) are much more likely than middle school (30%) and elementary school teachers (12%) to say the policies are difficult to enforce (among those who say their school or district has a cellphone policy).\n\nHow teachers are experiencing their jobs\n\nThinking about the various aspects of their jobs, teachers are most satisfied with their relationship with other teachers at their school (71% are extremely or very satisfied).\n\nThey’re least satisfied with how much they’re paid – only 15% are extremely or very satisfied with their pay, while 51% are not too or not at all satisfied.\n\nAmong teachers who don’t plan to retire or stop working this year, 29% say it’s at least somewhat likely they will look for a new job in the 2023-24 school year. Within that group, 40% say they would look for a job outside of education, 29% say they’d seek a non-teaching job in education, and only 18% say they’d look for a teaching job at another public K-12 school.\n\nDo teachers find their work fulfilling and enjoyable?\n\nOverall, 56% of teachers say they find their job to be fulfilling extremely often or often; 53% say their job is enjoyable. These are significantly lower than the shares who say their job is frequently stressful (77%) or overwhelming (68%).\n\nPositive experiences are more common among newer teachers. Two-thirds of those who’ve been teaching less than six years say their work is fulfilling extremely often or often, and 62% of this group says their work is frequently enjoyable.\n\nTeachers with longer tenures are somewhat less likely to feel this way. For example, 48% of those who’ve been teaching for six to 10 years say their work is frequently enjoyable.\n\nBalancing the workload\n\nMost teachers (84%) say there’s not enough time during their regular work hours to do tasks like grading, lesson planning, paperwork and answering work emails.\n\nAmong those who feel this way, 81% say simply having too much work is a major reason.\n\nMany also point to having to spend time helping students outside the classroom, performing non-teaching duties like lunch duty, and covering other teachers’ classrooms as at least minor reasons they don’t have enough time to get all their work done.\n\nA majority of teachers (54%) say it’s very or somewhat difficult for them to balance work and their personal life. About one-in-four (26%) say it’s very or somewhat easy for them to balance these things, and 20% say it’s neither easy nor difficult.\n\nAmong teachers, women are more likely than men to say work-life balance is difficult for them (57% vs. 43%). Women teachers are also more likely to say they often find their job stressful or overwhelming.\n\nHow teachers view the education system\n\nA large majority of teachers (82%) say the overall state of public K-12 education has gotten worse in the past five years.\n\nAnd very few are optimistic about the next five years: Only 20% of teachers say public K-12 education will be a lot or somewhat better five years from now. A narrow majority (53%) say it will be worse.\n\nAmong teachers who think things have gotten worse in recent years, majorities say the current political climate (60%) and the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (57%) are major reasons. A sizable share (46%) also point to changes in the availability of funding and resources.\n\nRelated: About half of Americans say public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction\n\nWhich political party do teachers trust more to deal with educational challenges?\n\nOn balance, more teachers say they trust the Democratic Party than say they trust the Republican Party to do a better job handling key issues facing the K-12 education system. But three-in-ten or more across the following issues say they don’t trust either party:\n\nShaping school curriculum (42% say they trust neither party)\n\nEnsuring teachers have adequate pay and benefits (35%)\n\nMaking schools safer (35%)\n\nEnsuring adequate funding for schools (33%)\n\nEnsuring all students have equal access to high-quality K-12 education (31%)\n\nA majority of public K-12 teachers (58%) identify or lean toward the Democratic Party. This is higher than the share among the general public (47%)."
