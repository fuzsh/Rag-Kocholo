        "text": "Call to make an appointment for a tour and see if our unique school can help your son or daughter experience school success.\n\nPlease note that our summer office hours are Tuesdays, Wednesdays, & Thursdays from 8:30 – 12:00.\n\nPlease check back in the fall for our next open house date.\n\nThe Concept School Difference\n\nThe Concept School is a co-educational independent school for students grades 6 -12. At TCS we educate students who learn differently and benefit from a smaller, relaxed, more personalized environment where learning and anxiety challenges are seen as opportunities to explore alternative routes to success.\n\nLocated on a ten-acre campus with an adjoining nature area and outdoor classroom, TCS provides a hands-on and individualized educational program that prepares TCS graduates to meet the demands of post-secondary life, whether entering college, career training programs, or the workforce.\n\nThe Concept School admits students without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, physical disability, mental disability, age, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship status, national or ethnic origin, and any other protected status.\n\nElena Witman\n\nBorn and raised in Havertown, PA, I am the middle child of three girls. I definitely struggled in more traditional school environments. After several years in Parochial school and public school, my family knew that I needed more support in terms of my education and emotional health. At the recommendation of an educational advocate, I toured TCS at the beginning of my sophomore year of high school. While a little hesitant at first, given the size of the school, I immediately loved having one-on-one interaction with the teachers and staff. Having a personalized learning plan was huge because it allowed me to realize that conventional educational methods aren’t as effective for someone who was neurodivergent, and that despite my struggles in my previous schools, it wasn’t because I was “stupid,” I just needed more accommodations. From the time I started until the time I graduated, I experienced tremendous growth. For most of my life, I never thought I would even graduate high school, let alone go to college. It was a struggle at times, but having the constant support and reinforcement from everyone at the school, allowed me to flourish. Being there and having these incredible opportunities gave me a new lease on life. Everyone there is truly like a family, and having so many people in your corner and believe in you, really helped build my self-confidence. I’m currently a sophomore at Villanova University, studying to become a licensed clinical social worker. I know I wouldn’t be here without the constant love and support of the students, teachers, and staff at The Concept School.\n\nAlex Miller\n\n“When I first started school in 2008, I enjoyed it, as there were a lot of fun activities. My issue was that I didn’t realize that the fun “had” to end, and I had to start focusing on the work at hand. My elementary school was never able to help me, and my middle school made things worse. When I moved to Pennsylvania in 2016 I checked out TCS. I chose TCS because of its small environment and 1 on 1 support. I found it extremely unique in the way they organized things and how they were able to adapt their teaching methods to accommodate me and others. TCS really did help me to succeed, as before TCS, I hated school with a passion. I made a lot of friends and memories, plus I realized that school wasn’t really hard if you had friends and supporters around you. I want to personally thank the amazing staff team at TCS for pushing me to succeed when I would get down on myself, and also my friends, who would be there to help out if I didn’t know what I was doing.”\n\nVivian Close\n\nA graduate in 2019, Vivian Close struggled to find the right academic home before settling in at The Concept School for her junior and senior years. What has Vivian accomplished since leaving TCS? She attended Gwynedd Mercy University for one semester and then transferred to Oklahoma State University. She joined a sorority and served two years as treasurer and the last year as president. Vivian graduated summa cum laude with a BS in nursing and a minor in philosophy. She is now enrolled at UPenn to earn a MS in nursing as well as a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist. Vivian works as an operating room nurse. Vivian says, “I know without TCS I wouldn’t be where I am now and I’m beyond grateful. I hold TCS close to my heart everyday.”\n\nAccording to Nick’s parents, “The Concept School has changed Nick’s entire outlook on life. He is thriving because he is in an environment where he can succeed. We are so grateful to this school for showing Nick he is valued and for providing him with the skills and confidence he needs to flourish. It’s very simple. The Concept School changed our son’s life for the better, and made a life-long difference for our whole family.” On a side note, Nick was just accepted to George Mason University as an incoming freshman for the 2022-2023 academic year. Way to go Nick; we are so proud of you!"
