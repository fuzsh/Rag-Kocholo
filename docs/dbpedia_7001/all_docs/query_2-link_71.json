What do you mean by Education?\n\nAns: In simple term, Education is nothing but it is a dynamic, continues and life long process of development of an individual which begins at the birth and continues throughout our life for acquiring knowledge and experiences that we acquire at home, school, playground, newspapers, radio, television, movies, etc. It helps to complete development of a man’s personality, as a whole.\n\nSo therefore, we can say that Education is life and life itself is education which can help to modify our behaviour, character and knowledge in all aspects of human development.\n\n2. Give any one definition of Education.\n\nAns: Different educationist has given different definition of education which are mentioned below:\n\n(i) M.K Gandhi defines, “By education I mean an all round drawing out of the best in the child and man body, mind and spirit.”\n\n(ii) According to Swamy Vivekananda, “Education is the manifestation of divine perfection, already existing in man.”\n\n(iii) Aristotle speaks of education as “the creation of a sound mind in a sound mind.”\n\n(iv) Pestalozzi indicates education as “the natural, harmonious and progressive development of man’s innate powers.”\n\n(v) John Dewey maintains “Education is the development of all those capacities in the individual which will enable him to control his environment and fulfil his possibilities.”\n\n(vi) Socrates view, “Education is the development of the universal elements, which is dormant in every individual.”\n\n(vii) Plato opinions that, “Education is the capacity of feel pleasure and pain at the right moment.”\n\n(viii) Sir Percy Nunn says “Education is the complete development of the individuality of the child so that he can make an original contribution to human life…”\n\n3. Briefly explain Etymological meaning of the term ‘Education’.\n\nAns: The term ‘Education’ has been derived from four ‘Latin’ words. These are- EDUCO, EDUCARE, EDUCERE and EDUCATUM.\n\nFirstly, It comes from two combination words “E” and “DUCO. Here, ‘E’ means “Out of” and “DUCO” means “Lead out”. Thus “EDUCO” means ‘to lead out’ the inner power of man.\n\nSecondly, the word “Education” originated from three ‘Latin’ words, namely:\n\n(a) EDUCARE:\n\nIt means ‘to bring up’ or ‘to nourish’. Here, education is considered as a process, not a product.\n\n(b) EDUCERE:\n\nIt means ‘to lead out’ or ‘to draw out’. Here, Education is considered as ‘the latent potential of the child from within’.\n\n(c) EDUCATUM:\n\nIt denotes ‘the act of teaching’ or ‘training’. Here, Education is considered as ‘the principles and practice of teaching’.\n\nPoint to be Remember\n\n‘EDUCO’ and ‘EDUCERE’ refers to ‘Education’ as an act of development from within whereas ‘EUCARE’ and ‘EDUCATUM’ implies that ‘Education’ is an act of putting in something from outside sources.\n\n4. Write briefly about the concept of narrow and wider meaning of education.\n\nAns: In the narrow and in its restricted sense education means ‘schooling’. Here, Everything is systematic, prefix, and pre-determined. The curriculum, discipline, deliberate efforts by the teachers inculcate certain values, habits or attitudes in children, method of teaching, and examination, marks or grades are followed in the school. A learner can get proper employment after getting a certificate from these institution.\n\nSo, we can say that narrow meaning of education is a systematic process to achieve the definite goals of education through classroom instruction.\n\nOn the other hand, In the wider and unrestricted sense all experiences of our life are said to be education. Here, education is not limited to four walls of the classroom. It comprises totality of our experiences which covers man’s physical, mental, social, emotional, and moral aspects of experiences from birth to death. These knowledge, experience and skills can gained through the house, temple, church, family. Playground, club, society even school which gives true realization of a man’s life.\n\nTherefore, we indicate that education is life and life itself is education which helps us to modify our behaviour, character and knowledge in all aspects of human development which are regarded as the wider meaning of education.\n\n5. Make distinguish between Narrow and Wider meaning of education.\n\nAns: The distinguish between narrow and wider meaning of education are mentioned below:\n\n(i) Narrow meaning of education is planned and organized process. On the other hand, Wider meaning of education is a social process.\n\nii. Narrow meaning of education which starts with students entry in school and ends with instruction completion, While wider meaning of education starts from birth and goes throughout life.\n\niii. Narrow meaning of education education is limited to schooling only, whereas wider meaning of education goes beyond schooling and instruction.\n\niv. In narrow meaning, the aim of education imparts limited knowledge in specific subjects. On the contrary, the aim of education focusses on overall development of students in wider sense.\n\nv. In narrow meaning of education, contents included only academic subjects traditionally taught in the schools, But contents are based on overall learning experiences of students in the field of wider meaning of education.\n\nArchives\n\n6. Education is a ‘Bio-polar’ as well as ‘Tri-polar’ process. Explain briefly.\n\nAns: Sir John Adams in his book entitled “Evolution of Educational Theory” said that education is a bio-polar process which is considered two poles, namely:\n\n(a) Teacher.\n\n(b) Students.\n\nHere, both are equally important in the process of education because If the teacher gives, the child receives and if the teacher instruct, the child follows. Here, the teacher seeks the modification of the development not only through imparting knowledge and skills but also through the direct influences on the child’s personality. So therefore, we can say that there is an interaction between the teacher and the child which is very essential.\n\nOn the other hand, John Dewey considered education is a tri-polar process. He said that educational process not only has a psychological side involving the teacher (educator) and the educand (students), but also has a sociological aspects too. It means the process of education contains three poles, namely:\n\n(a) Teacher.\n\n(b) Student.\n\n(c) Social or educational environment.\n\nHere, the teacher designs, plan, execute and evaluate students experiences to understand the child’s interest, capacities, aptitudes, and also try to modify the personality of the students. So therefore, we can say that these three factors actively cooperate in the efficient and successful working of the educational process which determines the aims, contents, method of teaching in which the teacher and the child both lives.\n\n7. Write a short note on ‘Education as a life long process’.\n\nAns: Yes, It is true that education is a continues and life long process which begins at the birth and continues throughout our life. It includes the effects of everything that influences human personality for acquiring knowledge, skills, experiences and competencies through formal, informal and non-formal learning throughout the entire life span.\n\nSo therefore, we can say that education is considered as a life long process pf striving for perfection.\n\n8. Write short note on ‘Education as modification of human behaviour’.\n\nAns: Yes, It is true that education as modification of human behaviour because of the following reason:\n\n(a) Education is a process which develops our learning factors that bring relatively enduring or permanent changes in our behaviour.\n\n(b) Education can change our behaviour that covers the whole life of a man to modify itself through the process of modification.\n\n(c) It represent a progressive change in behaviour by the acquisition of new behaviour which gives to meet our desire, needs and requirements for change.\n\nSo therefore, above reason we can say that education is considered as modification of human behaviour.\n\n9. Write short note on ‘Education as an instrument of social change.\n\nAns: Yes, It is true that education as an instrument of social change because of the following reason:\n\n(a) Education helps us in increasing the mental ability of a persons thinking, pattern of social relationship, attitudes, and lifestyle of a person.\n\n(b) It helps to bring such instant changes like- concept of right and wrong, what should be done or what not.\n\n(c) It also helps to modified our old customs, faiths and belief to bring about progressive changes in them.\n\n10. Briefly explain the scope of Education.\n\nAns: The literal meaning of scope is ‘range’.

The scope of educational process includes the following aspects:\n\n1. Types of Education:\n\n(a) Formal Education\n\n(b) In-formal Education\n\n(c) Non-formal Education\n\n2.
