        "text": "What to Look for in STEAM Lessons and Schools\n\nWhen it comes to using STEAM in the classroom, how do you know what you should look for in outcomes for students, teachers and lessons? It’s one thing to design a lesson, but it’s totally different to see STEAM in practice.\n\nThe practice is one of the most exciting things about using the approach. During these lessons, students engage on a totally different level and often produce work that is much more vigorous. But in any active classroom, it’s easy to confuse activity with deep learning.\n\nSTEAM OUTCOMES\n\nThe best way to ensure that your lessons are authentic to the STEAM process is with a simple look-for list. We have one developed for arts integration look-fors, but STEAM is a bit different. It has a different focus and intention that arts integration. So it also requires a slightly different list of outcomes. Let’s dive into each component below.\n\nINTENTIONAL CONNECTIONS\n\nSimilar to arts integration, the best quality STEAM lessons intentionally connect 2 aligned standards. The first two components of this list break this down a bit. We want to make sure we purposefully select standards, content areas and topics that make sense together. The easiest way to do this is through seeking similar verbs across standards.\n\nFor example, if the science standard asks students to “demonstrate” something and the art standard asks students to “apply” their skills, this can be an indicator of a possible alignment. It’s not a hard and fast rule, but it definitely helps to eliminate standards that won’t work together and leave us with the best options available.\n\nINQUIRY BASED\n\nAny good STEAM lesson is grounded in inquiry, problem-solving and process-based learning. In fact, this is one of the distinguishing characteristics between Arts Integration and STEAM. So when viewing STEAM in the classroom, you want to pay close attention to the essential question and the process surrounding its exploration.\n\nWhat problems are being investigated and solved? How are both contents being used to explore the problems? Why is the process important to the question posed? These are all important components to a STEAM classroom or lesson.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nWhenever a STEAM lesson is being used, it’s imperative that the arts content has been selected purposefully and that it’s being taught with integrity and not in service of the other content. This is a non-negotiable.\n\nMany times, we’ll see lessons where students are creating a craft at the end of the lesson and educators call it “STEAM”. Things like creating a shadow-box about the planets for a science lesson or painting a derby car that was built in an engineering unit.\n\nSimply adding paint, tape and glue doesn’t make it a STEAM lesson. That diminishes the deep process-based learning that is inherent to the arts. Instead, the lesson should be actively teaching the arts standard through application of skills students have learned during dedicated arts times.\n\n21st CENTURY SKILLS\n\nThe 4Cs of 21st century skills – Collaboration, Creativity, Critical Thinking and Communication – aren’t going anywhere. They are a critical component to student success in a rapidly changing workforce and society. Luckily, these are easily woven into any quality STEAM lesson. This is where the active engagement really starts to shine with student groups, creating original solutions and compositions and exploring questions from multiple perspectives.\n\nEQUITABLE ASSESSMENT\n\nFinally, a true STEAM lesson requires assessing both the content and arts standards that were selected and taught. As all good teachers know, if you teach it – you assess it. But remember that assessment is not the same as evaluation. Assessment is a measurement of growth, not a judgment of mastery. So in a STEAM lesson, you’re looking for student growth in both content areas from the lesson. If you need support in how to do this, or examples of maker-based assessments, definitely check out our Checking for Understanding online course.\n\nBONUS: MAKING MEANING\n\nMaking meaningful connections isn’t really a bonus. It’s wrapped around the whole lesson like a warm coat. Making connections to career pathways and real-world applications is a way for students to understand that what they’re doing in the STEAM classroom matters. It’s not just “playing” – what they’re learning, creating and applying has real possibilities and opportunities.\n\nUSING THIS LIST\n\nThe great thing about a list of look-fors like this is the ability to use it for many different reasons. If you’re a teacher, use this list as a way to tighten up your STEAM lesson development and implementation. If you’re an administrator, use this as a checklist during a STEAM lesson observation. Or use it as a way to make sure you’re on the right track towards becoming a STEAM Teacher or STEAM School. No matter what, these 7 basic outcomes will help take your students to the next level.\n\nBecoming a STEAM Teacher\n\nAs more schools are shifting to include a STEAM approach, there’s a general question that many start to ask: Who are the STEAM teachers? Then, of course, we start to explore follow up questions like:\n\nWhen does STEAM occur? Is it a class or is it throughout the day?\n\nWhat makes a person qualified to teach STEAM?\n\nAre there STEAM credentials?\n\nDo we just transform STEM teachers into STEAM teachers?\n\nIs STEAM reserved for the art class? Does that mean we need to reconfigure art time?\n\nOnce you head down this path, you start to see all of the forks in the road. These can lead you down a totally different journey than what you originally anticipated. Let’s explore each of these variations to get some clarity around an expanding and evolving approach.\n\nWho teaches STEAM?\n\nThe answer to this is one is easy: everyone. Everyone in a school has the capacity to be a STEAM teacher. It’s not limited to just the art teacher or just the science teacher. It’s everyone.\n\nThis can seem oversimplified, but honestly, it’s an inherent quality of this approach. STEAM, like it’s counterparts STEM and Arts Integration, is based on a foundation of integration. We’re trying to look at these areas of science, technology, engineering, the arts and math in tandem, rather than apart.\n\nBy limiting or labeling someone as the “STEAM Teacher”, you’re cutting out the very heart of this idea. We’re all STEAM teachers.\n\nThis goes back to the idea of “it’s not my job to teach that”. We’ve all heard people say some version of this:\n\n“It’s not my job to teach those kindergarteners to tie their shoes.”\n\n“It’s not my job to explain basic math functions to these kids.”\n\n“It’s not my job to show my students how to hold a paintbrush”.\n\nGuess what? It IS your job. It’s all of our jobs. We are a community and we all help each other. That’s how communities work. What benefits students, benefits us all.\n\nWith that in mind, if the opportunity is there to teach a STEAM lesson, take it! No one teacher has ownership of an approach. We’re all in this together.\n\nWhen does STEAM occur?\n\nThis question ties back to our first one. If everyone is a STEAM teacher, that means that STEAM can happen everywhere at anytime. It’s not limited to a specific STEAM class.\n\nWhat if your school has a dedicated STEAM time or course? That’s okay! There’s nothing wrong with that. This is usually a first step that schools take to ensure that there is time built in for STEAM. Also, many schools just don’t know where to start. So they appoint a STEAM teacher to become the expert for the building.\n\nAgain, this isn’t wrong – it’s just not the only part of the process. You can’t just put a STEAM class in place and call yourself a STEAM school. It’s not just one person’s job to “teach STEAM”.\n\nThis is an approach, not a scripted curriculum. STEAM is meant to encourage curiosity, ask big questions and provoke creativity in the exploration of problem-solving. Everyone can be a part of that in every class.\n\nSTEAM occurs throughout the day. It’s embedded as an approach to use when it’s appropriate and a natural fit for the intent of the learning opportunity. That means you can integrate STEAM into your math class, your music class, your field day – anything.\n\nThis is something that is woven into the fabric of our school culture. It’s just “how we do things”. But that also means, this comes with some responsibilities.\n\nWhat makes a person qualified to teach STEAM?\n\nJust because everyone can teach through STEAM, doesn’t mean that they can immediately do so with integrity. In fact, most teachers aren’t sure of what STEAM really is, so how can they teach it effectively?\n\nAs with most approaches in education, we need to ensure that our teachers receive high-quality professional development before implementation. There are plenty of options available, including STEAM conferences and courses. Whichever you choose, just be sure that teachers have the ability to learn more about how this approach works and how to use it in their classrooms.\n\nSince STEAM is an approach, teachers need to understand how to align curricular standards, create integrated assessments, develop lessons that ensure both the arts and the STEM areas are taught with integrity, and specific strategies that can be used with students.\n\nThis isn’t just a step-by-step curriculum or a place to house a maker space or 3D printing lab. STEAM is so much more than that, and you need to have teachers trained in how to use it. So no matter what option you choose, get everyone on your team some training to ensure the best opportunity for success.\n\nAre there STEAM credentials?\n\nThis is an evolving approach which means that we’re all actively learning and researching the best possible implementations. Many institutions are now beginning to offer STEAM certificates or STEAM-focused graduate programs. These can be a great option for teachers who want to do a deep dive study. You might want to consider programs like:\n\nUniversity of San Diego’s STEAM Master’s Degree\n\nConcordia University’s STEAM Master’s Degree\n\nMany other institutions offer courses in STEAM, though not a full degree. And of course, our Institute offers an online Arts Integration Specialist Certificate which also deeply addresses STEAM.\n\nThe only word of caution here is to keep in mind that everyone in your school is a part of STEAM. So you’ll want everyone to have at least a baseline of knowledge and understanding in the approach. This can include teacher-led PD days or even school-wide attendance at an online conference or course.\n\nDo we just transform STEM teachers into STEAM teachers?\n\nIn an effort to evolve schools into 21st century learning hubs, many have chosen to simply rename their STEM teachers as STEAM teachers. This unfortunately does a disservice to both the teachers and the approach.\n\nOften, this switch comes without any training. The STEM area teachers are not equipped with an understanding of what makes STEAM different than STEM. So they continue to teach their content the way they’ve always done, with a new STEAM challenge thrown in here or there.\n\nThis is also tied to the release of funding due to the updated ESSA law in 2015. This allowed schools to receive funds if they chose to integrate the arts. Many schools added this to their improvement plans without a true knowledge of what it really takes to weave STEAM in and through a learning pathway. Instead, they asked STEM teachers to become STEAM teachers and add in the arts to their current curriculum.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that neither STEM nor STEAM can happen without direct instruction of those individual skills/concepts. You can’t teach a STEM or STEAM lesson connecting two areas if students haven’t learned the skills in each area directly.\n\nFor example, if you want to connect parabolas and action art making, you can’t do that unless students already know what a parabola is and the specific techniques that artists use to create action art. You need to teach each of these things individually first.\n\nThat means that we only use STEAM when it’s appropriate – not all the time. Those science, math, technology and engineering classes need to focus on teaching those skills first. Only then can we intentionally provide a STEAM lesson that puts it all together.\n\nIs STEAM reserved for the art class?\n\nIf all this is true, then surely STEAM becomes something that happens just in the arts classes, right? Wrong. STEAM isn’t something we just stick somewhere. We don’t reconfigure an entire arts class to become a STEAM class.\n\nJust like in the STEM areas, in order for STEAM to occur, students also need to have direct instruction in the arts skills and processes. STEAM cannot happen if students haven’t explored arts techniques, master artists and composers, and the critical arts skills for creating, responding, performing/presenting and connecting.\n\nCan STEAM lessons happen in the art or music room? Sure! But they can also happen in the math or science room."
