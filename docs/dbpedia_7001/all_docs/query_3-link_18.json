        "text": "Both are used, and in practice there is little difference in meaning.\n\nHowever, the collocation varies by corpus and timeframe. In English fiction, the adjective is still preferred:\n\nAlthough the preference is not quite so strong in overall writing:\n\nMeanwhile, over in Britlandia, the trend is different:\n\nAs John Lawler observes in comments:\n\nActually the trend is the same. You can see from the graphs that the noun compound is gaining ground while the adjective is losing. In Britain, it's just a bit more advanced, that's all. Frequently used phrases tend to shed unnecessary morphemes once they're firmly linked together. Consider soft shell crabs and soft-shelled crabs, for instance.\n\nIn any event, education is only ever a noun, never an adjective. That means it can only be modified by adjectives like compulsory — not by adverbs like very the way educational can.\n\nPer the OED, it means:\n\nThe systematic instruction, teaching, or training in various academic and non-academic subjects given to or received by a child, typically at a school; the course of scholastic instruction a person receives in his or her lifetime.\n\nHowever, this noun can also easily be used as an attribute of another noun: education policy, education system, education funding, education legislation.\n\nThe adjective educational is nothing more than the adjectival form of the word education. It means:\n\nOf or relating to the provision of education.\n\nIt gets used to modify nouns as in educational opportunities, educational system, educational cartoons, educational psychology.\n\nAnother adjective with identical meaning but far less frequency is educative.\n\nThere’s perhaps some theoretical ambiguity with the attributive noun, but I really don’t think people will often read higher education level as a level of higher education rather than a higher level of education.\n\nThis neighbourhood provides a local labour supply with a higher _____ level.\n\nShould I use educational or education in the blank?\n\nAlso, what’s the difference between educational or education when both are possible as premodifiers?\n\nThere is a subtle difference:\n\n[higher education] level\n\nIn the first example, higher education modifies level. Level generically refers to a position on a scale of some sort, and higher education is an adjective phrase describing that particular position more specifically.\n\nA position on a scale of amount, quantity, extent, or quality.\n\n‘a high level of unemployment’\n\n‘debt rose to unprecedented levels’\n\nhigher [educational level]\n\nIn the second example, the adjective, higher modifies the noun phrase, educational level. Again, level refers to a position, but it is more specifically an educational level.\n\nThere is growing concern that educational levels in the U.S. population may stagnate or even decrease in coming decades.\n\nIn your sentence, the context speaks more to an educational level that is higher, than to a generic sounding level which is just incidentally relative to higher education. It's a matter of emphasizing what is most desirable for the local labour supply: Would the local businesses prefer to be supplied with employees of a higher quality educational level -- or would they be more interested in being supplied workers from a level that just happens fortunately to be in the realm of 'higher education'?\n\nGrammatically, either wording is adequate to get the idea across; but due to its rather technical, official-sounding tone, I would finish the sentence this way:\n\nThis neighborhood provides a local labour supply with a higher educational level."
