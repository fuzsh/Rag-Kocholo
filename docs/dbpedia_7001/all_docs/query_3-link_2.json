First, you’ll have to understand the types of degrees and college degree levels.\n\nDifferent degrees prepare you for different career paths. For example, you can’t become a psychologist with just a bachelor’s degree — you’d need a master’s or doctorate in psychology. And you usually can’t become an engineer without at least a bachelor’s degree.\n\nTypically, as your university degree level rises, your earning potential increases, and the unemployment rate decreases. That’s one more reason it’s important to understand the different types of degrees.\n\nWhat Types of Degrees Are There in College?\n\nThere are many types of degrees you can earn in college. College degree levels can be broken down into two categories: undergraduate degrees and graduate degrees.\n\nHere are the college degrees in order, from lowest ranking to highest:\n\nAssociate degree (undergraduate)\n\nBachelor’s degree (undergraduate)\n\nMaster’s degree (graduate)\n\nDoctoral degree (graduate)\n\nWhile a doctorate is the highest education level, some fields may stop at a master’s. The phrase “terminal degree” refers to the highest degree in a field.\n\nA professional degree is a type of graduate degree — often a doctorate — that prepares you for a professional career in fields like law and medicine.\n\nPopular Online Programs\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial aid, and more by contacting the universities below.\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...Learn More\n\nVisit Site\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...Learn More\n\nVisit Site\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...Learn More\n\nVisit Site\n\nAssociate Degree\n\nTypical Program Length: 1-2 years\n\nTypical Number of Credits: 60\n\nMost associate degrees prepare you to enter the workforce immediately upon graduation. These programs can be found at community and technical colleges and typically last 1-2 years.\n\nAn associate degree can also serve as the foundation for a bachelor’s program. You may even be able to transfer some of the credits you earned for your associate degree toward a four-year degree.\n\nSome associate degrees require you to complete an internship or practicum in addition to taking classes. This is particularly common among healthcare and tech degrees.\n\nTo apply for an associate degree program, you’ll need a high school diploma or equivalent, like a GED certificate. Some schools may require you to submit standardized test scores, such as the ACT or the SAT, as well.\n\nFeatured Associate Programs\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...Learn More\n\nVisit Site\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...Learn More\n\nVisit Site\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...Learn More\n\nVisit Site\n\nWhat Can You Do With an Associate Degree?\n\nAn associate degree prepares you for vocational, allied health, and support roles.

You’ll generally spend four years earning a bachelor’s degree at a college or university. You’ll take general education classes and courses in your major. You can also choose a minor.\n\nSome colleges offer accelerated bachelor’s programs, which take less time — often 2-3 years. Degree-completion programs can also speed up the timeline by awarding you credit for previous college coursework.\n\nYou can earn your bachelor’s degree online as well. An online degree from an accredited college meets the same standards as that of an in-person degree.\n\nYou’ll need a high school diploma for admission and may also need to submit SAT or ACT scores.\n\nFeatured Bachelor’s Programs\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...Learn More\n\nVisit Site\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...Learn More\n\nVisit Site\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...Learn More\n\nVisit Site\n\nWhat Can You Do With a Bachelor’s Degree?\n\nIn diverse industries like business, tech, and education, a bachelor’s degree can prepare you for many entry-level careers.

Here are some of the most common you can get:\n\nDoctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)\n\nDoctor of Business Administration (DBA)\n\nDoctor of Education (Ed.D.)\n\nDoctor of Medicine (MD)\n\nDoctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)\n\nDoctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.)\n\nDoctor of Psychology (Psy.D.)\n\nJuris Doctor (JD)\n\nA Ph.D. is the most popular doctorate. You can earn a Ph.D. in many arts and sciences fields. Other doctorates take their names from the career path associated with the degree.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About College Degree Levels\n\nThe four types of college degrees are associate degrees, bachelor’s degrees, master’s degrees, and doctoral degrees. Colleges classify associate and bachelor’s degrees as undergraduate degrees and master’s and doctoral degrees as graduate degrees.\n\nWithin those categories, you can earn many types of degrees. For instance, at the bachelor’s level, you could earn a bachelor of arts (BA), a bachelor of science (BS), or a bachelor of fine arts (BFA) degree.\n\nA four-year college degree is called a bachelor’s degree. Another term for this degree type is a baccalaureate degree.\n\nMany careers require a bachelor’s degree for entry-level roles. For example, most careers in business require you to hold a bachelor’s degree. Many roles in tech, education, the public sector, and engineering also require you to have a four-year degree.\n\nSome career paths require a specific major. In many states, you’ll need a bachelor of science in nursing (BSN) to become a registered nurse. In other fields, your specific major matters less than the quality of your skills.\n\nThe highest degree is a doctorate, also called a doctoral degree. In terms of university degree levels, both master’s and bachelor’s degrees rank below doctorates.\n\nYou can earn a doctorate in a wide array of fields, including the social sciences, business, the humanities, education, engineering, and healthcare.\n\nIn some fields, however, a master’s degree represents the terminal, or highest, degree. For instance, a master of fine arts (MFA) is the terminal degree for creative writing.\n\nMost would agree that the hardest college degree is a doctorate. As the highest education level, a doctorate requires significant expertise in the field.\n\nMany Ph.D. programs take six years or more and require you to write a book-length dissertation based on original research.\n\nBecause a doctorate represents the top of the university degree levels, it’s a relatively uncommon degree. Only around 2% of U.S. adults held a doctorate in 2022, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe fastest degree you can get is either a one-year associate degree or a one-year master’s degree. While other types of degrees typically take a minimum of two years, you can earn a master’s degree in one year with an accelerated or fast-track program.\n\nYou can sometimes add a master’s degree to your bachelor’s through a 4+1 program, also known as a bachelor’s-to-master’s program. In this case, some of your coursework counts toward both your undergraduate and graduate degrees, meaning you’ll spend an additional year in college to leave with a master’s degree.\n\nPopular with our students.\n\nBest Online Colleges of 2024\n\nOnline college has made accessible education a reality for many.
