        "text": "Vision\n\nOrganisations certified as a “Home of the 21st Century Education” are innovative learning centres with children from all social and cultural backgrounds at the centre of their work. By encouraging playful engagement with cultural heritage they equip children for a sustainable future in an interrelated world – socially, culturally, environmentally.\n\nWe dream that by 2030 every young person’s childhood can be enlightened through cultural heritage, thanks to the work of museums, galleries and interpretation centres keeping pace with children and their changing learning needs.\n\nMission\n\n“There is no more important cause than the children. As they hold our future in their hands, we hold their future in ours.” Henrietts H. Fore (Executive director of UNESCO)\n\nThere are many opportunities as well as threats to society in the early 21st century: the digital shift, which is reshaping the ways we work, learn and live our personal lives; the technological revolution, which has unleashed possibilities formerly unreachable for human beings but also completely changed the demands for the workforce; the devastation of nature, which is reaching a critical point; the disintegration of society.\n\nThe world we are passing on to our children seems to be a confusing one. Even though we probably cannot fully imagine how the future will be, we know that to make the best of it our children will need to be equipped not only with a heavy pack of knowledge, but a load of creativity, imagination, critical thinking, and the ability to decide and take responsibility.\n\nThe tools to pack for such a world can be found in the arts and cultural heritage: in the realm of stories, experienced humanity, empathy, courage but also ethics. Museums can thus be important places of learning for the future – if they embrace the needs of their audience.\n\nCreating places of informal and holistic education in line with the contemporary learning needs of children has been a major theme for children-focused museums since the 19th century. Since the establishment of the first children’s museums, they have continuously served as pioneers of audience-orientation in museums by offering spaces for playful learning.\n\nThe mission of the quality label for museums as “Home of 21st Century Education” is to support museums in fully embracing children’s needs and using their capacities for the education of the future, as well as highlighting the value of such places and projects for the children’s caretakers and educators – to help them find sources of great learning in the museum world."
