        "text": "Defining Experiential Education: Challenge and experience followed by reflection, leading to learning and growth.\n\nExperiential education is a teaching philosophy that informs many methodologies in which educators purposefully engage with learners in direct experience and focused reflection in order to increase knowledge, develop skills, clarify values, and develop people's capacity to contribute to their communities.\n\nExperiential educators include an extensively broad range of professionals such as: teachers, counselors, corporate team builders, therapists, challenge course practitioners, environmental educators, guides, instructors, coaches, mental health professionals and many more.\n\nMany disciplines and settings utilize experiential education methodologies: outdoor and adventure education, non-formal education, place-based education, project-based learning, global education, environmental education, student-centered education, informal education, active learning, service learning, cooperative learning and expeditionary learning.\n\nWe're here to support you on your learning journey!\n\nFree Library of Resources Related to Experiential Education\n\nExplore research in The Journal of Experiential Education (JEE)\n\nFind or post a job in Experiential Education\n\nContinue learning with AEE Publications\n\nJoin your peers and elevate your work\n\nClick the image above to download the infographic!\n\nExperiential Education: The Principles1 of Practice\n\nExperiential learning occurs when carefully chosen experiences are supported by reflection, critical analysis and synthesis.\n\nExperiences are structured to require the learner to take initiative, make decisions and be accountable for results.\n\nThroughout the experiential learning process, the learner2 is actively engaged in posing questions, investigating, experimenting, being curious, solving problems, assuming responsibility, being creative, and constructing meaning.\n\nLearners are engaged intellectually, emotionally, socially, soulfully and/or physically. This involvement produces a perception that the learning task is authentic.\n\nThe results of the learning are personal and form the basis for future experience and learning.\n\nRelationships are developed and nurtured: learner to self, learner to others and learner to the world at large.\n\nThe educator3 and learner may experience success, failure, adventure, risk-taking and uncertainty, because the outcomes of experience cannot totally be predicted.\n\nOpportunities are nurtured for learners and educators to explore and examine their own values.\n\nThe educator's primary roles include setting suitable experiences, posing problems, setting boundaries, supporting learners, insuring physical and emotional safety, and facilitating the learning process.\n\nThe educator recognizes and encourages spontaneous opportunities for learning.\n\nEducators strive to be aware of their biases, judgments and pre-conceptions, and how these influence the learner.\n\nThe design of the learning experience includes the possibility to learn from natural consequences, mistakes and successes.\n\n1) The priority or order in which each professional places these principles may vary.\n\n2) There is no single term that encompasses all the roles of the participant within experiential education. Therefore, the term \"learner\" is meant to include student, client, trainee, participant, etc.\n\n3) There is no single term that encompasses all the roles of the professional within experiential education. Therefore, the term \"educator\" is meant to include therapist, facilitator, teacher, trainer, practitioner, counselor, etc.\n\n--Gass, M.A., Gillis, H.L., Russell, K.C. (2012).

We acknowledge that Indigenous people around the globe face invisibility and erasure which compounds into other serious problems like cultural appropriation, minimizing, tokenizing, and devaluing humanity. The land we work, play and live on has a human history. AEE encourages everyone to educate themselves on the peoples of the land they inhabit and to recognize the current members as vibrant and alive today, not relics of the past.
