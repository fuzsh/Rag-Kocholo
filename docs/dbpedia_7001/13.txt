"Obstacles to integrating sustainability in the classroom can be traced to doubts about what to do and how to do it, doubts about its relevance or effectiveness, and doubts about student or peer reaction. The EDuC Label allows faculty and staff to resolve these doubts and become agents of change."

"The current lack of verified evidence of the impact of sustainability education is hindering its implementation and acceleration on an enormous scale. We must demonstrate the value of sustainability education through the generation and analysis of data, and the EDuC Label makes this possible."
