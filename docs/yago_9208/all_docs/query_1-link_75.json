        "text": "\"A film that shocks! A picture that dazzles! An experience that thrills!\" Janus Films has revealed a brand new official trailer for a 4K restoration of Victims of Sin, a 1951 classic Mexican film from the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema, written and directed by Emilio Fernández. It's ready for a proper cinema re-release in the US, with a run at the Film Forum cinema in NYC starting in a few weeks. Set in México City, a famous Cuban dancer from \"Cabaret Changó\" rescues a baby from a garbage can and decides to raise him, but her pachuco pimp gets in her way. Of course. IDescribed as a \"blend of film noir, melodrama, and musical\", the film has rarely been seen in the US, with the first release in Mexico in 1951. It stars acting-dancing sensation Ninón Sevilla, plus Tito Junco and Rodolfo Acosta, with cinematography by the legendary Gabriel Figueroa. Fernández explains: \"I tried to make films with a relentless and direct style, where I emphasized the strength and beauty of Mexico, because Mexico has an unsettling duality: it is a people of masks and of full transparency.\" This looks like a stellar picture that seems like it'll be thrilling to enjoy on the big screen.\n\nHere's the new 4K restoration trailer (+ poster) for Emilio Fernández's Victims of Sin, direct from Vimeo:\n\nRarely screened in the United States and long due for rediscovery, Victims of Sin (Víctimas del Pecado) is famed Mexican director Emilio Fernández's unique blend of film noir, melodrama, and musical. Acting-dancing sensation Ninón Sevilla plays Violeta, a cabaret performer who adopts the abandoned child of Rita (Rita Montaner) and Rodolfo (Rodolfo Acosta), her murderous pimp. Motherhood forces Violeta to give up her career, but the kindhearted club owner Santiago (Tito Junco) saves her from a life of poverty and prostitution—until Rodolfo, freed from prison, seeks to reclaim his son. Best known for the award-winning María Calendaria (1944) & The Pearl (1947), Fernández infuses Victims with impassioned songs & performances by Sevilla, an icon of Mexican cinema and purveyor of African, Caribbean, Cuban dance."
