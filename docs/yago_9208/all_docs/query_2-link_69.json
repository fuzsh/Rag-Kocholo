Anna begins by speaking to Susan Seidelman about her memoir and her recollections of working with Madonna and Rosanna Arquette. Susan talks about the explosion of Madonna’s stardom during filming, sharing some of her cherished memories from that time. She reflects on the enduring cultural impact of Desperately Seeking Susan as well as more broadly on her career. Next, Anna speaks to Rosanna Arquette about her memories of starring in Desperately Seeking Susan. Rosanna talks about the celebrated female friendship between her and Madonna’s much-loved characters in the film, and how that translated into their off-screen friendship, sharing some of her hilarious highlights of working with Madonna. Rosanna also talks about the Time’s Up movement, discussing her powerful allyship with the other women who were amongst the first to speak out against Harvey Weinstein, and sharing insights into the monumental impact that it had on her life.
