In the first film, Taylor was already attracting a large crowd of fans, thanks in great part to his strong, manly appeal.\n\nAfter the showing of New Moon, Lautner went from an actor of small parts in TV shows and commercials to an instant teen idol. He was especially venerated by teenagers because of his fresh physical attributes, becoming a sex symbol. But after his successful stint with The Twilight Saga, no one was gasping at his screen appearance anymore.\n\nShailene Woodley\n\nIn 2011, Shailene Woodley was cast in the film The Descendants. Her acting garnered solid reviews from critics and numerous awards. She was hailed as one of the 55 faces of the future in Nylon magazine's \"Young Hollywood Issue.” After her success in The Descendants, the American actress was cast in the Divergent series.\n\nBecause of subpar box office ratings in its third sequel, Allegiant, the studio made preparations to complete the series on TV. Shailene Woodley was not comfortable with the prospect of stepping down from the big screen to TV and withdrew from the show, but then strangely decided to accept a role in HBO’s 'Big Little Lies'.\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss became a Hollywood star when she played Trinity in the Sci-Fi action thriller The Matrix (1999). The film went on to make a whopping $460 million gross earnings worldwide and was widely celebrated by critics. Before her successful stint in The Matrix and its sequels, Moss said her acting career was pretty much non-existent.\n\nThe movie propelled the actress into worldwide recognition, but Carrie-Anne’s portrayal of Trinity in The Matrix Trilogy proved to be the defining moment in her career. And perhaps the only one that she will be remembered for as an actress. Today, she usually bounces from one Netflix Marvel show to the next, the latest being her character in Jessica Jones.\n\nMischa Barton\n\nThe famous Fox T.V. series, The O.C., became an instant hit and made Mischa Barton even more famous for her performance of the character Marissa Cooper. The British-American actress received a number of Teen Choice Awards. Mischa eventually left the show after its third season finale in May 2006.\n\nMischa Barton was also crowned by Glamour magazine as the \"Next Big Thing\" and hailed by Entertainment Weekly as the “It Girl” of 2003. Ever since she departed The O.C. during its pinnacle of recognition after the third season, she has made public gossip for her legal issues and impulsive actions.\n\nTaylor Kitsch\n\nIn 2006, Taylor Kitsch played Tim Riggins in the NBC sports drama T.V. series Friday Night Lights. Kitsch appeared in the show for five seasons, garnering international recognition from critics and nearly eight million viewers. He was also chosen to portray the iconic character Gambit in the X-Men franchise spinoff, X-Men Origins: Wolverine.\n\nIf you look at Kitsch’s track record, it’s obvious that there’s someone in Hollywood who was determined to make the actor a star. He was the main highlight in John Carter, Battleship, True Detective, and Savages. Sadly though, all those prestigious films failed to make him the next Johnny Depp.\n\nMegan Fox\n\nMegan Fox became a staple in the TV sitcom Hope & Faith. In 2004, she achieved her first film appearance in the teen comedy Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and a breakout performance in 2007 in the hit action film Transformers. She was also in the Transformers sequel, Revenge of the Fallen.\n\nBut Fox was cut from the rest of the sequels after the second movie. Apparently, she likened Michael Bay, the director of the Transformers movies, to Hitler in an interview, and that became the end of her role. Outside her supporting role in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Megan’s future appears bleak.\n\nAlex Pettyfer\n\nAlex Pettyfer had a breakthrough role in 2006 in 'Stormbreaker.' For his performance in the film, Alex received a Young Artist Award nomination and an Empire award. The British-American celebrity was also featured as a model in a number of Burberry advertising campaigns.\n\nAfter co-starring in the movies Magic Mike' and 'I Am Number Four,' Alex Pettyfer was poised to be the next Hollywood heartthrob. But everything quickly crumbled after he made a few interviews where he appeared arrogant and ungrateful. Today, the once promising actor is now practically an afterthought.\n\nMinnie Driver\n\nMinnie Driver received an Academy Award nomination for her role in 'Good Will Hunting,' in 1997. She also garnered an Emmy award and a Golden Globe award for her efforts in the TV series, 'The Riches.' The English-American actress has performed in numerous films and shone brightly as Fiona Bowa on the NBC sitcom About a Boy.\n\nGiven the various awards and accolades that were given to her following her performance in Good Will Hunting, there was plenty of hype that surrounded Minnie Driver during that time. She wasn’t able to live up to it, though, and has never really established herself as a household name. Today, she stars in the T.V. show, 'Speechless'.\n\nArmie Hammer\n\nArmie Hammer became popular for his role in 'The Social Network' film and is best known for portraying lead character roles in the films The Lone Ranger', 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' and 'Mine'. He was nominated for a SAG award for his role in the biographical movie, 'J. Edgar'. The American actor also enjoyed acclaim from critics and several nominations for his part in the film, 'Call Me by Your Name'.\n\nWith his good looks and charm, Armie Hammer had the makings of a prominent lead actor in films, but, as it turned out, he was only best suited for supporting roles. He had his chance to be the main man but didn’t quite succeed, and it’s maybe safe to say that his window of opportunity has closed permanently at this point.\n\nBrandon Routh\n\nBrandon Routh was determined to be an actor and eventually secured various roles in numerous TV series, like 'Gilmore Girls, at the start of 2000. The American actor made frequent appearances in the NBC series, 'Chuck', and later played supporting roles in the films Zack and Miri Make a Porno' and 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'.\n\nIn 2006, Brandon Routh was cast as “The Man of Steel” in Bryan Singer’s movie, 'Superman Returns'. There were plenty of lofty expectations for the actor after succeeding in the iconic role of the late Christopher Reeve. In the end, the movie turned out to be a bust, and Brandon Routh has now been demoted to a lesser superhero role in the TV series, 'Legends of Tomorrow.'\n\nLeelee Sobieski\n\nLeelee Sobieski was once considered to be cast as the character Claudia, in the movie 'Interview with the Vampire', but ultimately lost to Kirsten Dunst. Later on, the American actress would be seen in various films, like 'The Reunion,' 'A Horse for Danny' and 'Jungle 2 Jungle'.\n\nDuring her mid-teens, she rose to prominence and was considered as an up-and-coming superstar following her performances in 'Deep Impact', 'Eyes Wide Shut' and TV’s 'Joan of Arc'. But over the years, she wasn’t able to fly any higher and was even nominated for a Razzie Award! Today, many don't even know who she is.\n\nSam Worthington\n\nSam Worthington gained world recognition after he was featured in numerous minor roles in Hollywood films, like 'The Great Raid.' He also auditioned to play the iconic role of James Bond in 'Casino Royale,' but ultimately lost to fellow British man, Daniel Craig.\n\nSam Worthington enjoyed a breakout in his Hollywood career after he was cast as the main star in 'Avatar,' one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. He followed that up with a couple more blockbuster appearances as the leading man in 'Clash of the Titans' and 'Terminator Salvation'. Surprisingly, Worthington never became a staple name on the big screen.\n\nChad Michael Murray\n\nIn 2003, Chad Michael Murray landed the lead role of Lucas Scott in the hit WB TV series, 'One Tree Hill.' The series was the network’s most popular and highest-rated series in its broadcasting history. For his role in One Tree Hill, Chad Michael Murray managed to collect plenty of accolades and even created a book series.\n\nThe American actor also secured a number of notable deals, like an endorsement contract for MasterCard, KMart, Cingular Wireless, and the Chevy Cobalt. However, Murray failed to take full advantage of his popularity to elevate his celebrity status. As happens with all teen idols, Chad Michael Murray and his fan base aged, the young fans lost interest, and CMM faded from the spotlight.\n\nDakota Fanning\n\nHannah Dakota Fanning became an established Hollywood star when she was seven years old, after playing the role of Lucy Dawson in 'I am Sam'. For her performance, the young actress was awarded a SAG award nomination at just 8 years old, making her the youngest nominee in history. She also starred in numerous other films, like 'Uptown Girls', 'Man on Fire', and 'War of the Worlds'.\n\nDakota Fanning is a true prodigy who shone at an age when most of us were still sitting in school learning how to read and write. However, transitioning your career towards more mature roles can be quite challenging, as made apparent in her subpar performance as Cherie Currie in The Runaways. The verdict is still out on whether the general audience will continue to portray more mature roles, but her acting in The Alienist wasn’t all that promising.\n\nPhoebe Cates\n\nPhoebe Cates immediately went into acting after she decided to move on from modeling and made her debut as an actress in May 1981 in the film Paradise. The movie had the same plot as The Blue Lagoon, and the former model, now turned actress, portrayed a number of nude scenes in it, even though she was still a minor (17 years old). Phoebe also had a talent for singing and was the voice behind the main theme song of Paradise.\n\nEventually, in 1982, Phoebe Cates was cast in the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which Rolling Stone magazine called \"the most memorable bikini-drop in cinema history.\" That one scene alone was more than enough to turn an entire generation of young male moviegoers into actual fans. The actress also made an appearance in a couple of Gremlins films. Sadly, Cates became somewhat of a movie wallflower and eventually decided to retire from acting.\n\nEmile Hirsch\n\nEmile Hirsch's first film appearance was in 2002, in The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, which he followed up with The Emperor’s Club in the same year. Two years later, he appeared in hits like The Girl Next Door, Imaginary Heroes, Lords of Dogtown, and Alpha Dog. In 2007, Emile Hirsch made a breakout performance in Into the Wild. The role garnered him a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Best Actor.\n\nWith Into the Wild, Hirsch became an instant hit and somewhat of a hipster icon in Hollywood. Following his success in Into the Wild, Emile Hirsch landed the main role in Lilly and Lana Wachowski's Speed Racer, which premiered in movie theaters on May 9, 2008. His performance in the movie, though, failed to catapult his career to the next stage and after that, the American actor settled for minor roles in lower-profile projects.\n\nEric Bana\n\nBefore Hollywood, Ozzie-born Eric Bana starred in the Australian sketch comedy series Full Frontal. He started attracting Hollywood interest after his part in the war film Black Hawk Down in 2001 and the lead title in Hulk in 2003. Since then, he landed prominent roles in various movies like Troy in 2004, blockbusters like Munich, in 2005, Star Trek in 2009, and Deliver Us from Evil in 2013.\n\nFollowing heavy disappointments with Hulk and Troy, critics were in doubt about Eric Bana’s bankability in high-profile films. The Hulk character concept, for one, was rebooted a number of times, although Eric’s performance was not at fault. Since the two big movie busts, Bana has made memorable supporting appearances in Star Trek and Hanna, although he deserves to be a prominent leading actor.\n\nFairuza Balk\n\nFairuza Balk’s first major performance appearance in a Hollywood film happened when she was chosen to play the role of Dorothy Gale in Walt Disney’s Return to Oz. After her performance in the movie, the American Actress played numerous other minor characters, like Hubble in The Worst Witch. In 1993, she received an Independent Spirit award as best actress for her part in the film Food Lodging.\n\nFairuza Balk wasn’t even in her teens when she was cast as Dorothy in Return to Oz, which, for many moviegoers, was a bit unusual. The American actress was exceptional in her performance, though. She was, once again, the power-crazy witch Nancy in the film The Craft. This film was supposed to make her the perfect actress for goth characters. It didn’t turn out quite how many expected though.\n\nGarrett Hedlund\n\nWhen Garrett Hedlund was 18 years old, he moved to Los Angeles, so he could pursue his dream of acting. He made his first appearance in Hollywood films in the movie Troy as Patroclus. Then, in 2007, he co-starred with Lindsay Lohan, Jane Fonda, and Felicity Huffman in Georgia Rule. The latter movie, though, was dubbed by critics as a bust after failing to exceed box office expectations, only generating a lifetime gross of $41 million.\n\nGarrett Hedlund had a successful performance as the title character in Tron: Legacy, but after, reportedly declined the roles of Finnick in the sci-fi movie series Hunger Games and Fifty Shades of Grey. After the two films went on to become blockbuster hits, it seemed that it was a bad decision for Garett to turn down those roles.\n\nJai Courtney\n\nJai Courtney’s first acting stint was in 2005, in a short movie entitled Boys Grammar. In 2008, he was cast in the Australian series Packed to the Rafters. He then graced the set of the comedy film To Hell & Bourke and had a number of different roles in several short films as well. When it comes to Hollywood movies, Jai Cortney has performed numerous roles. The Australian actor performed as Eric, a leader in the Dauntless faction in the film Divergent, in 2014.\n\nJai Courtney has been continuously featured in big franchise films alongside Hollywood icons, including A Good Day to Die Hard with Bruce Willis, Jack Reacher with Tom Cruise, and Suicide Squad with Will Smith. However, if you presented the majority of movie-goers with a picture of the Australian actor, they wouldn’t know what his name is, even though they know that he’s the actor who starred as Captain Boomerang in Suicide Squad.\n\nGemma Arterton\n\nThe English actress landed a breakthrough role when she was chosen to play Strawberry Fields, the leading lady of Daniel Craig in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace, in 2008. Aside from James Bond: Quantum of Solace, Gemma Arterton was also involved in several blockbuster Hollywood movies, such as the Clash of the Titans and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time in 2010, as well as Byzantium and Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters in 2013.\n\nWithout a doubt, Gemma Arterton looks like a goddess and has an ethereal feel and glow to her, much like Liv Tyler. For this, and for many other reasons, the English actress was selected to perform prominent roles in big Hollywood films like Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Clash of the Titans, and Byzantium. If she has any plans of becoming a star in this era, though, she must prove that she can land a blockbuster film all by herself.\n\nIone Skye\n\nKnown for her star performance in Cameron Crowe's Say Anything in 1989, the British-born American actress continued to secure roles throughout the 90s and into the early 2000s, including prominent roles in Wayne's World in 1992 and One Night Stand in 1997. Outside the world of acting, she is also an avid painter and an accomplished author, having penned a number of children’s books. In 2006, she was ranked #84 on VH1’s list of the 100 Greatest Teen Stars.\n\nIone Skye will always be remembered as the girl in the movie Say Anything, whom John Cusack lambasted with the words “In Your Eyes” from a boombox. Following that legendary performance, however, the British-American actress, for some reason, was never able to reach her potential and elevate her status as a Hollywood superstar.\n\nJami Gertz\n\nJami Gertz was a child actress in a single episode of Diff'rent Strokes alongside Andrew Dice Clay. The American actress also made recurring appearances on The Facts of Life as Blair's friend and schoolmate, Boots St. Clair. Her Hollywood debut came in 1981 in the romantic movie Endless Love, which was immediately followed by a co-starring role in the TV series Square Pegs.\n\nThe actress garnered critical acclaim when she took a starring role in the 1987 film Less Than Zero as the friend of a hopeless substance addict portrayed by Robert Downey, Jr. She was also the star (literally) in the 1987 movie The Lost Boys, playing the character, Star, the \"half-vampire\" girlfriend. Following her breakout roles in Less Than Zero and The Lost Boys, though, she has been featured mostly as a guest and supporting actress on TV.\n\nJulia Ormond\n\nJulia Ormond made her acting debut on British TV in the 1989 serial movie Traffik, involving the notorious heroin underground business from the Far East to the cities of Europe. The English actress entered celebrity status when she played in a string of notable 90s films like Legends of the Fall and First Knight. She also received an Emmy award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for her performance in the HBO film Temple Grandin back in 2010.\n\nFollowing her portrayal of the main character in the film, Sabrina, there were a lot of movie pundits who believed that Julia Ormond was going to take the big screens by storm. As it turned out, though, Ormond took minor roles and was always cast as the “second girl” in every movie after Sabrina.\n\nKate Bosworth\n\nAfter playing small roles in the films The Horse Whisperer and Remember the Titans, Kate Bosworth got the breakthrough role in the box-office hit, Blue Crush. The movie garnered positive reviews from critics and audiences alike and raked in a total of $40 million at the United States box office. Following her success in Blue Crush, Bosworth accepted the lead role in the low-budget film Wonderland in 2003 alongside Val Kilmer.\n\nIn 2006, she was poised for another prominent role in a promising movie, Superman Returns. The American actress played the iconic, tough-as-nails reporter Lois Lane in the superhero movie, but after the film failed to meet expectations, Bosworth’s career took a step back. Today, Kate Bosworth still performs in films and movies but has never since had the chance to play in a high-profile project.\n\nKellan Lutz\n\nThe American actor and model made his Hollywood debut in the film Stick It in 2006 and is best known for his portrayal of Emmett Cullen in The Twilight Saga film series, starting in 2008 and continuing into 2012. Since then, he has played notable roles, including Poseidon in the 2011 film Immortals, Tarzan in the 2013 animated film Tarzan, John Smilee in The Expendables 3, and Hercules in The Legend of Hercules.\n\nKellan Lutz has the body of a God, which is why he was the star of The Legend of Hercules, Tarzan, and the powerful Poseidon in Immortals. Aside from showing off his stunning muscular physique, though, Lutz hasn’t really done much to impress pundits and moviegoers. He probably needs to excel in a role where he isn’t topless, perhaps in a classy suit.\n\nSaoirse Ronan\n\nSaoirse Ronan rose to prominence for her portrayal of a gifted teenager in the movie Atonement, for which she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. The Irish American actress followed up her successful showing in Atonement with a star performance as a murdered girl searching for justice in The Lovely Bones, an assassin in Hanna, a vampire in Byzantium, and a baker in The Grand Budapest Hotel.\n\nDespite her now numerous nominations and awards for Brooklyn and Lady Bird, Saoirse Ronan never became a household name, probably because of her very name itself. It’s really hard to pronounce her name compared to other notable household female stars, like Jennifer Lawrence, for instance. Could it really be that simple? It sounds like it could be.\n\nSean Young\n\nSean Young started her career in the film industry in 1980 with the movie Jane Austen in Manhattan. The American actress then landed a leading lady role alongside Harrison Ford in the classic science fiction movie Blade Runner in the following year. After her performance in Blade Runner, she starred in various other films, including Dune, No Way Out, Wall Street, Cousins, and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Things were looking good.\n\nThat was until she turned up at Tim Burton’s office in a Catwoman getup in an attempt to persuade him to offer her the role in Batman Returns. Young’s weird conduct in public during industry events made things even worse. On February 26th, 2012, while Hollywood stars were enjoying an after-party for the 84th Academy Awards, Young was arrested and forced to vacate the party because she didn’t have a ticket for the event.\n\nStephen Dorff\n\nStephen Dorff began his acting career during the late ’80s, securing only small roles at first, including guest performances on TV shows like Diff'rent Strokes, Blossom, Roseanne, and Married... with Children. The American actor’s first major role came in The Gate in 1987, a horror movie involving a boy who, together with his friend, uncovers a mysterious hole in his back yard, which later turned out to be a gateway to Hell.\n\nNow in his mid-forties, it may be too late for Dorff to take his career to the next level. He is making somewhat of a comeback, though, in HBO's series True Detective, where he stars as Detective Roland West, alongside award-winning actor Mahershala Ali, who plays the lead role and West's partner, Detective Wayne Hays.\n\nEstella Warren\n\nBefore her life as a Hollywood actress, Canadian-born Estella Dawn Warren was a synchronized swimmer. She was quite the swimmer as well, being a member of her country’s national team and a winner of three national titles. Aside from that, she’s also a successful model who has been featured in prominent publications, like Sports Illustrated, and in advertising campaigns for notable brands, such as Perry Ellis and Victoria's Secret.\n\nLater on, she started acting and became the star of a number of films, like Tim Burton's 2001 re-adaptation of the movie Planet of the Apes, and in hit TV shows such as Law & Order, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and Beauty and the Beast.\n\nAnne Heche\n\nAnne Celeste Heche rose to mainstream popularity after performing a dual role in the soap opera Another World and in various movies like Donnie Brasco, Volcano, Six Days, Seven Nights, and Return to Paradise. In 2004, the American actress won a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her part in the movie Gracie's Choice, and a Tony nomination for Best Actress in a Play for her performance in Broadway's Twentieth Century.\n\nAfter her famed relationship with comedian Ellen DeGeneres though, Anne Heche’s career suffered a major decline. Her reputation took a further hit when the public found out that she was suffering from some kind of mental illness. Heche revealed on national TV that she had an alter ego who was God’s daughter and Jesus Christ’s sister, named \"Celestia\". Apparently, the alter ego also communicated with Aliens. In August 2022, Anne tragically passed away.\n\nLinda Fiorentino\n\nLinda Fiorentino landed her first acting role in 1985 when she was chosen as the lead star in the coming-of-age movie Vision Quest. Soon after, the American actress garnered critical acclaim for her play in the action movie “Gotcha!”. Following her success in Vision Quest and Gotcha, she continued to star in various films, such as After Hours, Queens Logic, and Jade.\n\nLinda Fiorentino’s acting career rose to new and greater heights when she starred in the sci-fi action comedy film Men in Black, followed by other prominent movies like Dogma, Where the Money Is, and Liberty Stands Still. She received the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress, the London Film Critics Circle Award for Actress of the Year, and a nomination for a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her play in the 1994 movie Last Seduction.\n\nThora Birch\n\nThora Birch became an instant star in her very first film appearance in the movie Purple People Eater in 1988, for which she garnered a Young Artist Award for \"Best Young Actress Under Nine Years of Age\". She would then reinforce her status as a child star with outstanding performances in a number of films, such as All I Want for Christmas, Patriot Games, Hocus Pocus, Monkey Trouble, Now and Then, and Alaska.\n\nHailed as an indie-film heroine for her performance in Ghost World and American Beauty. Thora Birch received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress for her work in the former and a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress for the latter. Unfortunately, she didn’t go beyond that. And as it turned out, Ghost World supporting actress Scarlett Johansson became an even bigger star than her!\n\nEdward Furlong\n\nEdward Furlong received a Saturn and MTV movie award for his exceptional portrayal of the character John Connor, in the science-fiction action film Terminator 2: Judgment. A year later, he garnered yet another Saturn Award nomination for his performance in Pet Sematary and his first Young Artist Award for his work in A Home of Our Own alongside Kathy Bates, and he shared an ensemble nomination with the cast of the film as well.\n\nBut similar to his character in Terminator, Furlong was a troubled young man in real life, and his alcoholism and addiction ruined his promising career start. The American actor was apprehended by police officers twice for substance abuse, and on May 13th managed to escape jail sentence following a rehab program agreement that lasted for 90 days. Furlong has been in prison for a total of 61 days.\n\nErika Christensen\n\nErika Christensen has worked in various films throughout her career as an actress, including roles in Traffic, Swimfan, The Banger Sisters, The Perfect Score, and more. For her role in Traffic, she was awarded the MTV Movie Award for Breakthrough Female Performance and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. She also received a Gracie Award for her role in the NBC family drama series, Parenthood.\n\nThough many will best remember Erika Christensen as the fanatical character in Swimfan. Following her various awards and accolades for her role in Traffic and Parenthood, her career became somewhat stagnant. Today, Christensen stars on ABC’s drama series Ten Days in the Valley, together with Kyra Sedgwick.\n\nHayden Christensen\n\nHayden Christensen started acting when he was still a 12-year-old boy. At 13 he gained attention for a small role in John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness, landing him gigs in Goosebumps, The Virgin Suicides, and Are You Afraid of the Dark?. His part in Life as House earned him a Golden Globe and SAG Award nominations, as well as the National Board of Review's Award for Breakthrough Performance of the Year.\n\nAs the lead character and protagonist, Anakin Skywalker, in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, he got Best Actor and the Cannes Film Festival Revelation Award. Sadly, though, Anakin’s dull dialogue and awkward vibe with the character Amidala, played by Natalie Portman, wasn’t enough to propel his career outside the fantasy world of Star Wars.\n\nJoey Lauren Adams\n\nJoey Lauren Adams made her film debut in 1997 with a minor role in the horror movie Exorcist II: The Heretic. The American actress then rose to stardom in a major role in Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused, portraying the character Simone. In the same year, she was cast in the Saturday Night Live spinoff film Coneheads as Connie Conehead's friend.\n\nA couple of years later, Joey Lauren Adams starred in Mallrats, which was written and directed by Kevin Smith. Following the film's production, Adams and Smith started a relationship, and this became the inspiration for the former’s next movie, Chasing Amy. Adams became somewhat of an indie film hit for her work in Chasing Amy, but sadly, it proved to be the end of the road for her career as a Hollywood star.\n\nJosh Lucas\n\nJosh Lucas started acting in films and TV shows when he was still a 19-year-old teenager after he relocated to Hollywood following his graduation from high school. The American actor was featured as a guest star on a number of TV sitcoms during his 20s, such as Fox's True Colors and Parker Lewis Can't Lose, the family drama Life Goes On, and CBS's Jake and the Fatman.\n\nLucas entered the international stage after his performances in Sweet Home Alabama, A Beautiful Mind, and the character Glenn Talbot in Hulk. He enjoyed further global recognition in a string of leading roles in films like Glory Road, Poseidon, and Stealth. Nevertheless, none of those films managed to transform him into a true icon on the big screen. Josh Lucas currently stars in the police procedural The Mysteries of Laura.\n\nKerri Green\n\nAfter a bunch of teen dramas, the American actress enjoyed a breakthrough in her career after she was chosen to play the role of a cheerleader who became an adventurer, Andrea \"Andy\" Carmichael, in the 1985 movie The Goonies. Green achieved even more global praise after she starred in the film Lucas in 1986 as the focal point of a love triangle between Corey Haim and Charlie Sheen’s characters.\n\nHer next film though, Three for the Road, ended poorly even though she co-starred with Charlie Sheen and Alan Ruck. Kerri Green made an appearance in an episode of Heat of the Night, two episodes of the television sitcom Mad About You, and worked on an indie film called Blue Flame.\n\nMike Vogel\n\nBefore he started performing in Hollywood films, Mike Vogel was a model for Levi’s. Later on, he caught the eye of talent scouts and was cast in the TV series Grounded for Life for recurring roles between 2001 and 2004. He made his film debut in Grind. The American actor and former model landed his next role as Heath in the TV remake of Wuthering Heights, which aired on MTV just a month after Grind's release in September 2003.\n\nMike Vogel’s biggest hit as an actor was with the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, which garnered high box office ratings. Vogel is certainly an actor on the rise, but will he shine even more or become an unfortunate addition to the long list of Hollywood busts? He currently stars in NBC’s new military drama series, The Brave.\n\nNick Stahl\n\nNick Stahl began as a child actor, garnering acclaim for his work in the 1993 movie The Man Without a Face alongside Hollywood legend Mel Gibson. Compared to other child stars who became “one-hit wonders,” Stahl managed to transition into his adult career pretty well, with performances in prominent movies like The Thin Red Line, In the Bedroom, Bully, Sin City, and more.\n\nUnfortunately, on December 27th, 2012, Stahl was apprehended by police officers at an adult film store in Hollywood, California, due to performing lewd acts. A year later, he was arrested for carrying methamphetamine. During an interview at the Dallas Comic Show in 2017, the American actor shared that he has taken time to focus on family and sobriety but has plans to make a comeback soon. Let's see what happens.\n\nTopher Grace\n\nTopher Grace is best known for his performance as Eric Forman in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. Aside from that, he’s a familiar face in numerous Hollywood films, like Eddie Brock and Venom in Spider-Man 3, Pete Monash in Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! He is also featured in other films, such as Traffic, Mona Lisa Smile, Valentine's Day, Take Me Home Tonight, The Big Wedding, War Machine, and Under the Silver Lake.\n\nJust like other That ’70s Show co-stars, Topher Grace failed to launch his career despite having prominent roles in blockbuster hits like Spider-Man 3, Predators, and Interstellar. You can call it a That’ 70s curse or something, but Grace, for some reason, never became a true star in Hollywood, even though he should have been.\n\nBridget Fonda\n\nThe American actress is widely recognized for her performance in numerous films, like The Godfather Part III, Single White Female, Singles, Point of No Return, It Could Happen to You, and Jackie Brown. Bridget Fonda earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for performing Mandy Rice-Davies in the 1989 film, Scandal, and was the voice of Jenna in the 1995 animated film, Balto.\n\nAs the daughter of Peter Fonda, niece of Jane Fonda, and granddaughter of Henry Fonda, Bridget Fonda also comes from a line of film royalty. She eventually took a different route though, tying the knot with Danny Elfman and channeling all her time and energy on rearing her family. Today, the once-promising actress is retired and walks on the red carpet only when she’s around her husband Danny Elfman.\n\nIlan Mitchell-Smith\n\nIlan Mitchell-Smith wasn’t fond of acting at first – he was an avid ballet dancer! He practiced from a very young age and was even awarded a scholarship to perform with the School of American Ballet. A few years later, he ended up in the e teen classic Weird Science, by John Hughes. The movie revolved around a couple of teenage nerds who created a woman of their liking because they were incapable of having girlfriends.\n\nFollowing his success with Weird Science, Mitchell-Smith continued to star in a number of other movies and TV shows, particularly The Chocolate War and Superboy. Both films, however, failed to generate the same amount of praise from fans and critics. He then made the decision to permanently retire from acting in 1991. Today, the once-famous actor is now a professor at California State University, Long Beach.\n\nMichael Schoeffling\n\nA gifted wrestler during his high school and college days, Michael Schoeffling collected medals from numerous different national and international competitions. His wrestling prowess was put on display when he was cast as “Kuch” in Vision Quest, where he engaged in a wrestling duel with Matthew Modine, his friend in the film.\n\nMichael Schoeffling is best known for his role as Jake Ryan, the high school hunk who chose Molly Ringwald’s character over his famous girlfriend in the film Sixteen Candles. He pursued various movie roles a few years after Sixteen Candles and appeared opposite Winona Ryder in Mermaids. Then out of the blue, he vanished from TV and the big screen, tied the knot with a model, had kids, and went on to live the simple life of a carpenter.\n\nRick Moranis\n\nThe Canadian actor gained recognition in the comedy series Second City Television during the ’80s and, soon after, starred in a number of Hollywood movies, including Strange Brew, Ghostbusters, Little Shop of Horrors, Spaceballs, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Flintstones. In 1997, Moranis quit acting to focus on his two kids as a widowed husband and single father. Since his long sabbatical, he has not made a single appearance.\n\nHe has done a few voice-overs for select animated films, most famously Disney's Brother Bear, in 2003. He also did some comedy albums and participated in fan events. Numerous fans, viewers, and film personalities around the world continue to knock on the actor’s door, hoping that they can convince him to make a Hollywood comeback so he can continue his legendary legacy, but it seems they haven't had much luck.\n\nShelley Duvall\n\nThroughout her career, Shelly Duvall gained significant praise for her depiction of numerous eccentric roles. The American actress started her path to Hollywood prominence in several Altman films during the 70s, including Brewster McCloud, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Thieves Like Us, Nashville, and 3 Women, for which she garnered a Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress and a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress.\n\nAfter her breakthrough performances, Shelly Duvall suddenly disappeared, not only from the big screen but from the public view as well. In November 2016, USA Today revealed that Duvall was apparently battling a mental illness that prompted her to go into isolation. Later that month, she made an appearance on an episode of the TV show Dr. Phil and looked nearly unrecognizable while she was discussing her battle with mental illness.\n\nHelen Slater\n\nHelen Slater first started her career as a movie star in ABC’s Afterschool Special Amy & the Angel, which was broadcast in 1982. The movie was the only time Slater would be brunette. In 1984, Helen Slated was picked to play Selena, in the TriStar release of Supergirl. The movie featured heavyweights like Mia Farrow and Peter O'Toole. In the end, though, SuperGirl garnered varied reviews and didn’t fare well at the box office.\n\nThe movie was believed to be the cause of why DC killed the original comic’s character Supergirl/ Kara Zor-El in 1985, While Slater's portrayal of the character was not given most of the blame for the movie’s poor results. After a frustrating stint with Supergirl, Helen Slater made an appearance in Ruthless People and a few other small roles before surprisingly working with the TV series Supergirl as Kara Danvers, Supergirl’s mom.\n\nShiloh Fernandez\n\nShiloh Fernandez finally made his TV debut in 2006 on an episode of Cold Case. He later made his film appearance when he was chosen to perform the character of Edgar in Interstate. The American actor secured his first staple role in Jericho as Sean Henthorn, from 2006 to 2007. Although the series was shut down after just a single season, fans succeeded in lobbying for its comeback only to see it get shut down again permanently.\n\nShiloh Fernandez belonged to a class of heartthrobs at the onset of 2010 who were heavily endorsed as the next superstar. Fernandez failed to land the lead role of Edward in Twilight, which was given to Robert Pattinson but made appearances in several films like Red Riding Hood, Evil Dead, Jericho, and United States of Tara. He is still waiting for that breakthrough role that will catapult his career to stardom.\n\nJeanne Tripplehorn\n\nTripplehorn’s movie career started with Basic Instinct in 1992 as a police psychologist. She became a star on TV with her performance as Barbara Henrickson in the HBO drama series Big Love and as Dr. Alex Blake on the CBS investigative crime drama series Criminal Minds. The American actress was awarded a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for her role as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the 2009 HBO movie Grey Gardens.\n\nJeanne Tripplehorn has appeared in numerous films that you’ve probably watched already, but there are not a lot of people who genuinely recall her name. Today, the majority of her acting exploits involve supporting roles after she failed to secure that elusive leading-lady status.\n\nChris O'Donnell\n\nAt the start of the ’90s, the American actor began enjoying significant success in his career as an actor, appearing in prominent movies like Fried Green Tomatoes, School Ties, and Scent of a Woman alongside cinema legend Al Pacino. In 1992, he was included in the list of 12 Promising New Actors of 1992 in John Willis's Screen World, Vol. 44.\n\nChris O’Donnell portrayed superhero sidekick Robin in the two worst Batman movies of all time. However, the actor managed to bounce back from the travesty and became a leading man in rom-coms and films like The Three Musketeers. While his career on the big screen doesn’t seem to hold much promise, his career in TV series may have plenty to offer. Today, he currently stars as Agent G. Callen on NCIS: Los Angeles.\n\nLori Petty\n\nLori Petty got the breakthrough role she was waiting for when she was cast alongside Richard Grieco in Fox’s Booker. In the 1991 action thriller Point Break, she portrayed the surfer who gave Keanu Reeves valuable surfing lessons. In 1992, the American actress appeared in A League of Their Own opposite Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, and Madonna.\n\nIn 1995, Lori Petty was chosen to play the title role in the movie adaptation of the British cult comic book, Tank Girl. Aside from that, she also performed in numerous other films, such as Free Willy, The Poker House, and In the Army Now. Today, Lori Petty enjoys regular appearances as an inmate on Orange Is the New Black, but it’s unlikely that she will be appearing on the big screen anytime soon.\n\nTara Reid\n\nAs a star in some major hits like \"American Pie\" and \"The Big Lebowski\", it looked like Tara Reid was on her way. Unfortunately for her, Tara had trouble keeping up with the pressure and turned to late nights and partying.\n\nThe wild nights put a bump in her career and now we're seeing her on bad reality shows like \"Marriage Boot Camp.\" Would her career have played out a little differently? Perhaps. She was always Kevin's golden girl in the beloved teen movies.\n\nShannen Doherty\n\nDuring the 90s Shannen Doherty became a household name, thanks to the show \"Beverly Hills 90210.\" She then appeared on \"Charmed,\" and it further upped her status. But after heated behind-the-scenes clashes, Doherty started to crumble under pressure until she was eventually written out of the show.\n\nHer bad reputation followed her throughout her career and the offers began to dry up. The actress continued with sporadic television appearances and the occasional TV movie. Unfortunately, the Charmed actress was never able to bounce back.\n\nLisa Kudrow\n\nArguably one of the greatest stars of \"Friends,\" Lisa Kudrow, unfortunately, did not get as much spotlight as Jennifer Aniston post-show. She had a few roles here and there in films like \"Analyze This\" (and \"Analyze That\") and also starred in the comedy aptly named \"The Comeback.\" It was a little too on the nose and didn't quite catch and certainly contributed to her lack of success.\n\nIn recent years, Kudrow has starred in the hit web series turned Showtime TV series \"Web Therapy,\" in which she plays a wannabe therapist for LA who is mostly concerned with her own issues. The recent success has given her sort of another wave.\n\nMacaulay Culkin\n\nOur favorite child star, Macaulay Culkin, had an incredibly promising career. Having burst onto our screens in the Home Alone films (\"Ri¢hie Ri¢h\" and more), Macaulay Culkin was Hollywood's golden kid. As we've seen with numerous child stars, making the transition into adulthood isn't always easy.\n\nAfter battling it out with stardom, Culkin got swept up into the dark side. Soon the actor was in a downward spiral and was even arrested. The former child star appeared in minor roles on television such as \"The Jim Gaffigan Show\" and \"Robot Chicken.\"\n\nKatherine Heigl\n\nAfter starring in leading roles in numerous rom-com, you would think that Katherine Heigl would be one of the biggest stars today. Sadly, it is not the case, and the actress did not end up going where we all thought she would. There are various explanations for her lack of success, and some, quite frankly, are a little disappointing.\n\nDuring her days on \"Grey’s Anatomy,\" she publically declined to enter the Emmy race due to thinking that she was not up to the competition. Shortly after that, she was written out of the series. On another occasion, while promoting the hit film \"Knocked Up\", Heigl accused the film of sexism. These things and some on-set disputes made it a little difficult to work with and the actress's trajectory slowly started to change.\n\nSharon Stone\n\nIt's hard to maintain success in Hollywood. You can be in one day and out the next. No one knows this better than Sharon Stone. After her role in Basic Instinct, Stone's hot streak started to cool down. Unable to pick films that served her well, the actress began getting plagued with terrible reviews.\n\nStone then turned to 'Old Faithful' and starred in the \"Basic Instinct\" sequel in 2006. That didn't do much for her career. Today the actress is mostly remembered for that and her famous leg scene.\n\nChris Klein\n\nAnother \"American Pie\" star that didn't quite hit the big leagues. Chris Klein made a great impression after his stint in the teen movie franchise and went on to star in more challenging roles like in films \"Election\" and \"American Dreamz.\"\n\nIt seemed like he was on the right path when, all of a sudden, his personal life got in the way, and he was arrested for a DUI. After that, Klein suffered the curse of a string of terrible roles like \"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.\" Sorry, Chris.\n\nTiffani Thiessen\n\nActress Tiffani Thiessen was perhaps never thought of as a major Hollywood star, but there was a time during the 90s that she was one of TV's hottest actresses. Her time on Saved By the Bell earned her spots on countless magazine covers, making her the teen It girl for some time, not to mention her time on \"Beverly Hills, 90210.\"\n\nDid you know that the actress was even supposed to play Rachel on Friends? Yep! Thiessen was pretty close to getting it at one point and even read with the whole cast. Of course, that rejection led her to Beverly Hills. Ultimately, the actress didn't manage to break out of the mold of a mild TV soap star.\n\nIsaiah Mustafa\n\nActor Isaiah Mustafa shot to fame in the series of quirky Old Spice Ads. His humoristic manner and incredibly good looks seemingly made him a shoo-in A-list role. Mustafa, at one point, even seemed to be pretty close at one point as one of the candidates for \"Luke Cage.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the part ultimately went to Mike Colter. While Colter's career sky-rocketed, Mustafa's stayed pretty stagnant and now he is just the Old Spice guy. We hope things turn around.\n\nLiv Tyler\n\nAnother one of the \"almosts.\" Liv Tyler's transition from the teen cult hit \"Empire Records\" to bigger roles looked promising, The actress was even once considered a leading lady who would soon join the ranks of Julia Roberts or Meryl Streep.\n\nWhile the actress even went on to star in major blockbusters like Armageddon and The Lord of the Rings movies, she never quite received that status. Perhaps she never challenged herself to meatier roles. At least she settled comfortably in TV, on the HBO series \"The Leftovers.\"\n\nShannyn Sossamon\n\nShannyn Sossamon starred as the beautiful pixie dream girl in the raunchy comedy \"40 Days 40 Nights\" alongside Josh Hartnett and immediately stole hearts. Shortly after, she beat out Kate Hudson for the role of Jocelyn in the film \"A Knights Tale.\" It seemed she was pretty much on her way.\n\nShe then got a leading role in \"The Rules of Attraction\" and received rave reviews. Sadly, after that, her reunion with Ledger in the film The Order was a total flop and contributed to her downfall. Sossamon then took a break from acting and focused on motherhood. Who knows, maybe things will turn around!\n\nAmanda Bynes\n\nThe hottest teen star of the 90s and viewed as the more pristine Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Bynes' career was on fire. With films like What a Girl Wants, \"She's the Man\", and \"Sydney White\", Bynes seemed destined for bigger things.\n\nThe transition did prove easy for Bynes who, instead of climbing up the film ladder, ended up getting in more and more trouble with the law. After displaying some odd behavior on social media, the actress was soon added to the spotlight. To be fair, she has expressed some battles with mental illness. We hope things turn around for her.\n\nRosanna Arquette\n\nAt one point, a rising star, Rosanna Arquette, fell victim to the infamous Hollywood blacklist, and her career was cut short. In fact, the whole Arquette family was a household name.\n\nWhile her siblings David and Patricia were getting ahead, Rosanna's career began to wane and she turned to smaller and smaller roles over the years.\n\nSkeet Ulrich\n\nThe groundbreaking horror film \"Scream\" gave was a springboard for quite a few big names today. Well, a lot of them have since faded, and one of them is Skeet Ulrich. The hunky teen from the notorious slasher film was on the road to being the hotshot new eye candy. Move over 90s Leo DiCaprio. There was a time it was all about Ulrich. Contrary to popular thought, the actor's hot streak was terribly short-lived.\n\nThe unforgettable movies followed the slasher king around until he had to submit to mediocre television roles. In 2006, the actor starred in the show \"Jericho,\" which got canceled after 2 seasons. Recently, Ulrich got a little break on CW's \"Riverdale.\" He'll never be what he once was, but at least it is something.\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt\n\nAfter \"Heartbreakers\" and \"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\" Jennifer Love Hewitt was pretty darn huge. She was raking in cash as a teen queen and on the verge of entering a new, more mature genre. Looks like it didn't quite happen and after struggling to find roles that would serve her well, Hewitt just fell off the radar.\n\nIn 2012, she decided to focus on family. She has promised her fans that she will be back at some point, but so far we've only seen her on the show \"9-1-1.\"\n\nClaire Forlani\n\nThe versatile actress Claire Forlani wowed us in just about everything. It turns out that beauty and talent can only be so shortlived, and the offers dried up too quickly. Perhaps she was just too good to be true. The British beauty just couldn't quite find her niche in Hollywood.\n\nEven in leading roles in \"Green Street\" and \"Mallrats\" and even \"Meet Joe Black\" alongside the one and only Brad Pitt, Forlani ultimately was destined for bad TV shows and failed films.\n\nMilla Jovovich\n\nEverybody thought Leeloo from the \"Fifth Element\" would be the next go-to action star. Milla Jovovich certainly proved herself in both \"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\" and \"Resident Evil.\"\n\nUnfortunately, even with all the talent, box office success and those tough girl looks, the actress didn't quite see her full potential and has since faded away from the screen. At least we will always remember her in those roles.\n\nHeather Graham\n\nHeather Graham was the beautiful woman you saw alongside many major stars like Johnny Depp and John Travolta throughout the early 2000s. She was even the supporting role in the comedy hit \"Austin Powers 3\", a role that certainly showed off her comic flair. Sadly, fans and Hollywood spat her out too soon, even though she looked like she had real potential.\n\nThe actress hasn't been spotted in anything worth it for over a decade. In 2014, she made some TV appearances and minor roles in \"Get Shorty\" and \"Flaked.\"\n\nAdrien Brody\n\nAt just 29 years old, Adrien Brody became the youngest man ever to win an Oscar in the history of the Academy Awards. Sometimes, when that much success is thrown at you too soon, you can run out of steam very quickly. After his amazing performance in \"The Pianist,\" he went AWOL.\n\nWhere has he been? Apparently, he's been busy painting. Well, he did come back for a little bit in \"Peaky Blinders\", but does he have the same status as he did? We're not sure.\n\nZooey Deschanel\n\nThe ever-charming manic pixie dream girl, Zooey Deschanel, was our indie darling. She then gained TV fame as Jess in \"The New Girl,\" which pretty much was the same role she was accustomed to. But it's clear that fans quickly got tired of the bespectacled quirky girl and moved on.\n\nThe actress hasn't appeared in a lead role for a decade now and apparently has been raising her two children. You can now catch Zooey in the odd commercial here and there. \"500 Days of Summer\" is now just a distant memory.\n\nAndie MacDowell\n\nThroughout the 90s, Andie MacDowell was in just about every romantic comedy released. There was also \"Groundhog Day\", \"Hudson Hawk\", \"Michael\", and \"Crush.\" Unable to stay in the spotlight, the Southern belle just disappeared off the face of the earth.\n\nLuckily, she has passed the baton to her daughter Margaret Qually, who can now be seen in Once Upon a \"Time in Hollywood\", \"Seberg\", and a string of cutting-edge indie films.\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt\n\nAfter phenomenal work in \"Inception,\" \"50/50\", \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" and \"(500) Days of Summer\", actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt just stopped showing up. We were all rooting for him; the actor showed talent in highly-charged blockbusters and tender indie films. Still, he never became the Holywood leading man.\n\nSince 2016, the actor has only done a little voice-over work and appeared in a short film. Time will tell whether or not this is a goodbye or just a short-term break.\n\nColin Farrel\n\nHow did it go wrong? Farrell possessed all the goods to make him a total A-star. The Irish actor gave fantastic performances in films like \"American Outlaws\", \"Minority Report\", \"Phone Booth\", and \"In Bruges.\" He even had his moment in comedy in \"Horrible Bosses.\"\n\nA couple of flops later, and a bit of substance abuse, Farrell didn't quite make the cut to the Leos and Brad Pitts of our time. Maybe he can turn things around, but at this point in his career, we are doubtful.\n\nGretchen Mol\n\nGretchen Mol started out seriously promising and was churning out hits. With big-time films like “Rounders”, “Celebrity”, “Donnie Brasco” and “Music from Another Room” she was everywhere. By 1998, Mol was on the cover of Vanity Fair and was dubbed the “It Girl of the Nineties.”\n\nDespite the media madness, Gretchen sort of just fell off the radar. It almost felt like for a moment that the press created the buzz just to sell her. The fans didn't buy it, and Gretchen Mol was no longer.\n\nClive Owen\n\nLike a more suave Colin Farrel, and also with a similar narrative, Clive Owen shot to stardom as another British adonis in Hollywood. The actor was leading action-packed and critically acclaimed actions and dramas but then swiftly settled into smaller niche films. Instantly, he went from the next possible on the verge A-lister to hardly seen.\n\nOne's status can change ever so quickly and drastically in Hollywood. You never know where you're going to end up. This year he did land the role of Bill Clinton in American Crime Story, but we have yet to see that so our opinions are subject to change.\n\nRyan Reynolds\n\nWith his chiseled jaw and blond hair, Ryan Reynolds was a shoo-in for the typical A-lister. After action-packed films like “Blade Trinity”, romantic comedies like “Just Friends” and the “The Proposal”, and even blockbuster hits like 2011's “Green Lantern.”\n\nStill, even with an impressive resume, Ryan Reynolds has been teetering on megastar success since his stint on the 1998 ABC sitcom \"Two Guys And A Girl.” Years later, Reynolds never really made the leap to meatier or weightier roles and will forever be the funny and charismatic guy.\n\nRiz Ahmed\n\n\"Slumdog Millionaire,\" one of the most widely praised films to have ever been made, could have had a very different look. The film turned Dev Patel into a household name, and while we all love Dev, we could have been uttering another name from our lips over that film. That's right. Riz Ahmed was in the running to be Jamal Malik in the Dany Boyle film.\n\nAccording to insiders, Ahmed went a touch overboard while auditioning. Fortunately, as we know, he did end up portraying the brother. Still, the actor never reached his full potential. At least he had a shot, though. It's probably the film that would have turned Ahmed into a huge star. Unfortunately, he is still there, teetering on the edge.\n\nNicole Scherzinger\n\nFrom Pussycat Dolls to the big screen. Nicole Scherzinger would have been an even bigger star ever. Keyword —\"would.\" Unfortunately, after her musical stint with the pop group, Nicole didn't quite make it all the way. At least not all the way to the Baywatch. Fans were momentarily eager to see her in the Baywatch movie, but then it just didn't happen.\n\nThat's what happens when you get a little too big. The bubble can burst at any minute. What's with Scherzinger nowadays, anyway?\n\nJanuary Jones\n\nJanuary Jones, AKA Betty Draper from \"Mad Men\" never quite seemed to transcend her iconic TV role from the hit show. While the actress has managed to get parts she hasn't really achieved success in changing her status to a serious Hollywood actress. Even though Hollywood initially wanted her to be.\n\nThis is partly due to her supposedly stuck-up attitude, making her unapproachable. That probably explains why she didn't get the role she once really wanted: The role of Violet Sanford in \"Coyote Ugly.\"\n\nRon Perlman\n\nAs a Marvel favorite, \"Hellboy,\" or Ron Perlman, fans couldn't wait for the third installment of the beloved comic adaptation. But then, after a sudden twist of events, it all fell through, and Ron Perlman lost out.\n\nPerhaps we all misread the fan response? Perhaps everyone was, in fact, rooting for someone else. There was some talk of Perlman even landing the role of Cable in Deadpool 2, but again he lost. Are we over Ron Perlman? Seems so.\n\nJosh Hartnett\n\nJosh Hartnett was making his way to the celebrity A-lists in the late 90s after classics like The Faculty, The Virgin Suicides, and Halloween 2. But he really hit it big in the 2000s – playing a lead character in the box-office hit Pearl Harbor alongside Ben Affleck.\n\nHartnett was offered several big roles in Hollywood, which he literally turned down. Why? The humble boy from Minnesota wasn’t interested in commercial hits anymore but rather leaned toward much smaller, indie movie roles like The Black Dahlia and Wicker Park.\n\nFreddie Prinze Jr.\n\nAnyone who lived through the 90s will remember when the horror classic I Know What You Did Last Summer hit theaters. One of the things they’ll most remember is its lead hunk, Freddie Prinze Jr. This role catapulted Freddie to stardom, making him a teen icon and securing dozens of film projects.\n\nHowever, as is common among actors who started with these teen heartthrob roles, Freddie found it hard to move on to more serious dramas. His career hit a wall, and he decided to focus on family life until he starred in another 90s classic, She’s All That. Eventually, he gave up acting altogether.\n\nRyan Phillipe\n\nRyan Phillipe was one of the 90s’ favorite teenage hunks, especially after that saucy role in Cruel Intentions. His combination of a pretty baby face and a chiseled body made him an instant star. Everyone had high hopes for Phillipe, but apparently, Hollywood also had trouble seeing more than a cute baby face.\n\nTo make matters worse, when his marriage with Reese Witherspoon ended in 2007, his celebrity status took another hit. After that, Phillipe seemed to have left Hollywood altogether and decided to dedicate his time to charity work.\n\nJonathan Taylor Thomas\n\nSince the popular American sitcom Home Improvement was first released in 1991, Jonathan Taylor Thomas became a household name. Playing Randy Taylor in Home Improvement gave this then-ten-year-old kid an overnight success that would last for the next few years.\n\nBut, despite the big career plans Hollywood had in store for him, Thomas suddenly decided to leave that life behind and attend college. He claimed to never really liked the celebrity lifestyle and preferred instead to go get an education in filmmaking.\n\nRalph Macchio\n\nRalph Macchio became an overnight teen sensation after his leading role in 1984’s classic film, The Karate Kid. Macchio starred in two sequels and was the talk of the town for a few years. However, contrary to what everybody expected, this teen idol wasn’t too fond of Hollywood life.\n\nApart from a few commercials and an appearance in Dancing With the Stars in 2011, Macchio went about his life far away from the spotlight. It wasn’t until 2018 that he came back to Hollywood to star in the fan-fiction TV series spin-off Cobra Kai.\n\nAnthony Michael Hall\n\nOne of the best things to come out of the 1980s was the cult classic film The Breakfast Club. There wasn’t a single American teenager in the 80s who didn’t feel identified and represented by the cast of characters in that film, and Anthony Michael Hall was one of them.\n\nFilmmaker John Hughes went on to write leading roles for Hall in the hit 80s films Sixteen Candles and Weird Science. But things turned sour for Hall after a falling out with Hughes made a big dent in his acting career. The fame and fortune proved to be too intimidating, and Hall basically faded into the shadows.\n\nHenry Thomas\n\nHenry Thomas will forever be the beloved little boy who found E.T. That leading role as Elliott in Steven Spielberg’s classic family film, E.T. the Extraterrestrial, made the actor one of the most famous children in Hollywood back in the 1980s.\n\nHis fame led to a lot of bullying in school, and finally, at age 17, Thomas moved to New York, looking to reignite his acting career. He was met with little luck and no remarkable job offers, and we barely saw him on screens for many years.\n\nAmber Heard\n\nIt’s hard to forget the first time we see blonde bombshell Amber Heard come into the scene in The Rum Diary. Although she’d already become somewhat of an “It Girl” in Hollywood, it wasn’t until her role alongside co-star (and later (ex) husband) Johnny Depp in The Rum Diary that people really began to talk about her.\n\nUnfortunately, the talk wasn’t about her acting skills but about her disastrous and violent relationship with Depp. Nowadays, any career prospects she may have had back in 2011 have faded away, together with her marriage and her reputation.\n\nDenise Richards\n\nDenise Richards was one of the hottest celebrities back in the 90s. A series of big-screen hits like Starship Troopers, Drop Dead Gorgeous, and who can forget the incredibly sexy Wild Things had her in line to become a mega Hollywood star.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn’t the case, and to make things worse, she had a very problematic marriage with the infamous Charlie Sheen, which didn’t help her public image. Nowadays, Richards has turned to reality TV in a last-ditch effort to not fade into the background.\n\nKate Hudson\n\nIt may be a surprise to see Kate Hudson’s name on this list, but if you think about it, other than average rom-com, she hasn’t had a serious, award-winning role since the 2000s Almost Famous. Her role as Penny Lane in this cult classic earned her a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination.\n\nOf course, being the daughter of Hollywood royalty Goldie Hawn, she stayed in the public eye, but not for her repertoire of great films. She chose to focus on her family and King St. Vodka company and settled for projects like Bride Wars and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.\n\nAlicia Silverstone\n\nAlicia Silverstone started to make a name for herself as a teen idol at age 16 when she appeared in Aerosmith’s “Cryin” music video. Three years later, she became one of the most famous, popular, and sought-after 19-year-olds in Hollywood after her star role in the 1995 hit Clueless.\n\nSilverstone became the voice of a generation. Well, the voice of rich California girls from the Valley generation, but still, Hollywood and her fans expected great things from her. Unfortunately, after Clueless, everything went downhill and she disappeared from the public eye.\n\nJulia Stiles\n\nAfter her star role as the rebellious Kat in the 90s hit film 10 Things I Hate About You, Julia Stiles established herself as a different type of “It Girl.” Everyone was anxious to see what Stiles would do next, and two years later, Save the Last Dance came out. Stiles was climbing her way up the A-list celebrity ladder, and then the ladder came crashing down.\n\nThis was due to the fact that, apart from a supporting role in the Bourne film saga, Julia Stiles acted in a few films that were a complete failure. Like so many other teen actresses, she seems to just have disappeared.\n\nRachael Leigh Cook\n\nRachael Leigh Cook had a breakthrough moment in her acting career when she was cast in the 90s favorite She’s All That. What the actress, and all her fans at the time, thought was only the start of a very promising career turned out to be the only famous role she ever played.\n\nYou might remember her in 2001’s Josie and the Pussycats, which was a fun enough movie to watch. But in theaters? A complete flop. After this, Cook took on smaller roles in indie films that were so indie that nobody even remembers their names.\n\nBella Thorne\n\nDoes anybody remember Bella Thorne? She was the pretty girl who was successful for 5 minutes when she starred in the TV series Shake It Up! with co-star Zendaya. Thorne was one of those cases of very young Disney actresses who don’t make it far in the big bad world of Hollywood.\n\nApart from starring in several really bad films, she seemed to enjoy flaunting her disastrous personal life on social media. Raunchy photos, ugly relationships, and bad career choices left Thorne hanging in the wind, where she slowly fizzled out. She could’ve learned a thing or two from her co-star Zendaya.\n\nKatie Holmes\n\nHolmes had her moment in the spotlight playing Joey in Dawson’s Creek and then continued her famous streak in Hollywood when she paired up with Tom Cruise. She was even cast in the box-office hit Batman Begins.\n\nBut then, it seems everybody quickly realized that Holmes wasn’t exactly an acting savant, so she cut her losses and focused on family life. And we ask, has anybody seen her in anything lately? The answer would be a hard no.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar\n\nAs Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sarah Michelle Gellar really became a pop culture icon of the 90s and 2000s. She was a blonde babe with a fierce attitude, and so she went on to land big gigs in I Know What You Did Last Summer, Cruel Intentions, and Scream 2.\n\nThey were all favorite cult classics, but then, Gellar seemed to disappear from the Hollywood map. Most people couldn’t name a single thing she’s been in over the past ten years, apart from social media photos.\n\nRussell Brand\n\nWhen we first saw Russell Brand and his fantastic British accent in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, we hoped to see more of this new actor. Then, two years later, in the 2010s Get Him to the Greek, where he plays an unbearably egomaniacal musician who you can’t stop laughing at, he further cemented his place in Hollywood.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems fans ultimately grew bored with his comedy and got tired of his pseudo-philosophical talk shows. To boot, his TV series Arthur was a failure and got pulled from the screen fairly quickly. Add a slimy breakup text to Katy Perry on New Year’s Eve, and Brand was Hollywood history.\n\nLindsay Lohan\n\nLindsay Lohan is probably one of the most dramatic crash-and-burn stories in Hollywood. She started out as the innocent little girl in The Parent Trap – we all adored her red hair and cute freckles. Then, roles in Freaky Friday alongside Jamie Lee Curtis and then the cult classic Mean Girls made her rise to fame almost overnight.\n\nLohan started to become a real problem for anybody who hired her – showing up late for work and sometimes not making it at all. This, combined with the fact that her movies were a flop, made Lohan a bad Hollywood drama story.\n\nMatt Dillon\n\nMatt Dillon made a name for himself in the 80s and 90s with hits like Rumble Fish, There’s Something About Mary, Wild Things, The Outsiders, and Singles. But then, it seems that after his role in Crash, he faded into the background.\n\nHe continued acting in several projects but none nearly as big as what audiences had expected from him. We are not too worried about Dillon. He has made enough money in his short career, so he doesn't really have to take any more roles.\n\nSam Claflin\n\nTo some, Sam Claflin is one of the best British actors in the industry; to many, he was supposed to be that but never quite made it. Sam Claflin grabbed our attention when he took part in \"The Hunger Games,\" showcasing his exquisite talent and irresistible charms, however, that wasn't enough.\n\nThe charming actor took on many other roles, however, everything remained low-key and never exploded as he wished it would. Sam Claflin is part of the cast in the very successful series \"Peaky Blinders\" but the lead roles and the amazing storyline seem to take all the fame.\n\nLiam Hemsworth\n\nLiam Hemsworth was destined for A-list stardom. The heartbreaker from Down Under has a long resume behind him and still hasn't managed to become the next big thing in Hollywood. In his homeland, Hemsworth is best known for his role as Chris Taylor in the soap \"Neighbours,\" however, we mostly recognize him as Gale Hawthorne from \"The Hunger Games.\"\n\nHemsworth is also known as Miley Cyrus's ex, however, when it comes to fame, glam, and being on his own, he doesn't seem to be more than just another name for the credits. There is nothing particular about him, on the screen or off it.\n\nLarisa Oleynik\n\nIn the 1990s, there was a bright and successful future planned for Larisa Oleynik in the industry. Her first roles as an actress were in the theater, however, soon enough, she decorated our screen in \"The Secret World of Alex Mack.\" She then took things seriously in \"Boy Meets World,\" \"10 Things I Hate About You,\" and many, many other titles.\n\nSo what happened? Oleynik spread her talent in too many directions. She never had a specific typecast. She was in too many places in too little time and never managed to reach the top. These days, she does Netflix, Broadway, and anything else that comes her way.\n\nSara Paxton\n\nThe biggest mistake Sara Paxton's agents made when she was taking her first footsteps in her career was to try to get her roles in any show, movie, or play that was about to be created. Like many other names of the 1990s, Sara Paxton was everywhere you looked.\n\nAlthough she is magnetically beautiful, she obviously belongs to a long past era as she is not one of the first names to come to mind when you think of big Hollywood stars. Paxton has never given up. She is still working hard in various roles. However, the dream of becoming the industry's big thing has slowly vanished away.\n\nMia Wasikowska\n\nThe 2010s were all about Mia Wasikowska, and then she disappeared. Well, almost. When we first saw her in \"Alice in Wonderland\" and then in \"Jane Eyre\" we couldn't get our eyes off her. Her remarkable talent was showcased in so many productions, and a new star was born. Or not.\n\nIn recent years, Mia Wasikowska decided to pack her bags and leave Hollywood. We are not sure if she left for now or left for good, but what we know is that she didn't quite suit the LA way of life and preferred to go back home to Australia.\n\nDane DeHaan\n\nFor years on years, Dane DeHaan was compared to many big names in Hollywood, if not for his looks, then for his style and talent. Then, \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" came out, which marked the peak of DeHaan's care. From there, things began going downhill.\n\nIt's not that he packed up his things altogether and left the industry; it's that no matter what role he took, none of them delivered big fame. In recent days, he played in \"Oppenheimer\" and \"Dumb Money,\" so he hasn't said his last word yet. Is there hope for Dane DeHaan to still make it big in Hollywood? Only time will tell.\n\nTheo James\n\nWhen we first met Theo James in 2010, we felt as if a new wave of Hollywood superstars had risen. James made his debut on the small screen when he was given a role in a few episodes in \"A Passionate Woman\" which was followed by another minor role in \"Downton Abbey.\" Theo James was named by many movie critics, The Star of Tomorrow. Unfortunately, tomorrow is taking its time.\n\nHe had dipped his stake in many verticle roles, from action movies to period dramas, however, he found it very difficult to explode and become a big name in Hollywood. Maybe his appreciated role in \"White Lotus\" will deliver him the glam and fame he is after. Until then, Theo James remains on our list.\n\nAnnaSophia Robb\n\nWhen AnnaSophia Robb showcased her talent in \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" she was considered one of the most promising names in the industry. Besides being a model, singer, and wonderful actress, she fills her life with many noble causes and other meaningful projects. Maybe this is the reason why she hasn't made it big.\n\nThe beautiful American actress is still going and working as hard as ever. There are many productions that are already in the making, so AnnaSophia is promising that we will see her back on the screens. We cannot guarantee she will come home with an award, though.\n\nEliza Dushku\n\nEliza Dushku is pretty much known for playing the part of the gorgeous femme fatale. She had her breakout role as Faith, the bad girl on \"Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,\" and years later went on to play super spy Echo in Joss Whedon’s \"Dollhouse.\"\n\nIntentionally or not, Dushku has the talent for being drawn to darker and more complicated roles, which might explain why she has been steadily in the same place for many years. Eliza went back to school and studied for her master's degree in clinical mental health. By the look of it, she is not counting on Hollywood to provide for her family and is planning a plan B just in case.\n\nWentworth Miller\n\nWentworth Miller is both British and American and was first introduced to our screen when he played the role of Michael Scofield in \"Prison Break.\" Throughout his career, he has tasted many different roles and tried to work out what suits him best. By the look of it, he hasn't made up his mind yet.\n\nHis personal life scandals didn't help with trying to succeed in the industry, and he hasn't managed to hold on to the glam and fame Hollywood has to offer. After a short career, Miller decided to take a long break, however, he is back on track, and you never know, he might surprise us with some unforgettable role that will force us to delete his name from our list.\n\nFelicity Jones\n\nFelicity Jones started her acting career as a kid. She grew up with just her mother and brother, and she says that growing up that way matured her faster and prepared her for the real world. She was the presenter of \"Dolce & Gabbana\" in 2012 and has said that fashion shows are just like acting. You put on a costume and play the role.\n\nJones's most notable role was in \"The Theory of Everything,\" however, she never only stuck to acting, and her way of life was not like an average Hollywood star's. She continues to contribute to the film industry, and although she is not the biggest name around, she is for sure one heck of a talent.\n\nJosh Hutcherson\n\nJosh Hutcherson is well-known for starring in the dystopian franchise “The Hunger Games.” Now, although the show was a huge success, and Hutcherson was one of the biggest names on it, the future didn't seem to be so bright in regards to the rest of his career.\n\nMaybe it was the choice of roles, or maybe this was just not meant to be for him. The star was born in the early 1990s, so he still has a few years down to the line to prove us wrong and try to hit the fame and fortune of the Hollywood way of life.\n\nIsla Fisher\n\nThis Irish-Australian actress kicked off her Hollywood career playing Mary Jane in the 2002 movie \"Scooby-Doo.\" She has really risen to fame since then but hasn't managed to become the biggest name around. She starred in a number of notable movies, including \"Wedding Crashers\" and \"The Great Gatsby.\"\n\nIsla married comedian Sacha Baron Cohen in 2010 and is now a mother of three. Her family life is as strong, maybe even stronger, than her career. One of her most notable roles was that of Rebecca Bloom in the 2009 hit movie \"Confessions of a Shopaholic,\" and we really hope she is holding something up her sleeve for the future.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr.\n\nWho can forget Cuba Gooding Jr.'s breakout role in the classic movie \"Boyz N Da Hood?\" The son of Cuba Gooding Sr. really showed what he was capable of in front of a camera. A few years later, Gooding Jr. had an unforgettable role alongside Tom Cruise in the movie \"Jerry Maguire,\" most notably for the line \"Show me the money!\"\n\nAs the years progressed, his roles were a lot less consistent in terms of critical reception. Thankfully, though, Cuba reminded us just how good of an actor he can be in great entertaining parts, Emmy-nominated role as OJ in the series \"The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story.\"\n\nEmma Roberts\n\nEmma Roberts has been everywhere for the past decade or so, first in teenage movies like “Nancy Drew” and “Aquamarine,” and then in indie projects like “Palo Alto,” raunchy comedies like “We’re the Millers” and cheesy rom-coms like “Maybe I Do.” Her TV work includes, most memorably, the “American Horror Story” series and “Scream Queens.”\n\nAll grown up, Ms. Roberts is still pursuing an acting career, however, her level of fame and glory remains steady and doesn't seem to be going too high in the near future. In March 2019, Emma hooked up with fellow actor Garret Hedland of \"TRON: Legacy\" fame. The two welcomed a child into the world together in December 2020 and decided to go their separate ways in January 2022.\n\nEmma Watson\n\nThe Harry Potter franchise was undoubtedly responsible for catapulting many new names into the industry, including Emma Watson. She portrayed Hermoine Granger stellarly in this series, which earned her great respect and recognition. Watson claims to have struggled with the last two films in the series as they turned out to be rather dark and contained fragments of death and torture.\n\nMaybe this is the reason for the star not taking new and exciting roles and instead spending her time writing. Emma Watson is a great example of what beauty and brains look like, and she has worked extensively to promote women’s rights.\n\nAlly Sheedy\n\nAlly Sheedy is one of the biggest names of the 1980s and one of John Huges's biggest discoveries. She is best known for her role in \"The Breakfast Club\" where Sheedy played the role of Allison Reynolds. She immediately melted our hearts and was promised a massive career in the industry. She was a dominant member of the Brat Pack, which was a guaranteed ticket into the industry.\n\nFor Sheedy, things didn't work out as she planned, and when Hollywood only wanted her for a specific role that didn't always suit her, she decided to take her life journey elsewhere. These days, she is a professor in the theater department in a New York college.\n\nJennifer Grey\n\nIf you want to put Baby in a corner, make sure Jennifer Grey doesn't play her. She starred in two of the eighty's biggest movies, starting with “Ferris Bueller's Day Off” and then went on to “Dirty Dancing.” The two made her a star and earned her a Golden Globe nomination. However, a car crash with then-boyfriend Matthew Broderick changed her life – from then on, she says, it felt weird being in the spotlight.\n\nSince that fateful day, she's been in mostly TV and made-for-TV movies. She also underwent two rhinoplasty surgeries that she says hurt her career. The most notable achievement in the most recent years of her career was winning season 11 of \"Dancing With the Stars.\" Looks like nothing will get the dancer out of her.\n\nMia Sara\n\nHer full name is Mia Sarapochiello, However, she is better known as Mia Sara (it's easier). In 1985, she played Lia in the movie \"Legend\" and Sloane in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", which was the one that marked her breakthrough. Both her parents were photographers and into the world of art, so unsurprisingly, she followed in their footsteps. Mia has resigned altogether from the acting work and spends most of her time raising a family.\n\nShe says that her kids think her role in Ferris Bueller doesn't do her any good. So, although she is best known for her 1980s roles, she did regularly take part in fantasy TV, including productions such as “Lost in Oz,” “The Witches of Oz,” and “Dorothy and the Witches of Oz.”\n\nEmilio Estevez\n\nAs one of the founding members of the Brat Pack, Emilio was ready for stardom. While he hasn't become the big name he was hoping for, he still does plenty of acting, and at least his career didn't turn into anything like the rest of the pack. Thanks for that are due mostly to his most famous movie, “The Mighty Ducks,” as well as its sequels.\n\nHe's shifted into being a writer and a director and has recently made a film about the Bobby Kennedy assassination, “Bobby.” As a brother of Charlie Sheen, we can just be thankful that he didn't end up on such a dark path like other family members."
