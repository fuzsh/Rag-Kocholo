        "text": "Rosanna Arquette\n\nFrank & Lola: Director Matthew Ross on Losing Michael Shannon to Man of Steel, Building Trust with Imogen Poots, and How to Get Food Right on Film\n\nWe spoke with Frank & Lola director Matthew Ross about the film's long and bumpy road to the big screen, building trust with his two leads, transplanting the film from New York to Las Vegas, and what he's been collecting recently.\n\nThis Week in DVD: 4/17/12\n\nThis week, action and misery seem to be the themes as takes on Shame and Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, while Noah Taylor looks at The Divide, and Phil Brown watches Contraband\n\nThe Divide Review\n\nThe Divide is a psychological thriller about post-apocalyptic survival that is often horrifying and all around nightmarish. From claustrophobia to torture, radiation sickness and murder, this movie is intentionally void of anything that makes an audience feel comfortable or at ease for longer than one or two brief moments. On this level it's an achievement, but ultimately the story suffers from a shapeless script."
