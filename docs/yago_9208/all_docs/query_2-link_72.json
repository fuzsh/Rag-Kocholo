        "text": "Rosanna Lisa Arquette was born to a show business family in New York City. She was the first-born child of five in the third generation of the Arquette acting clan. Her grandfather Cliff Arquette played “Charley Weaver” on “The Jack Paar Show” and was a regular on the original “Hollywood Squares.” Her father, character actor Lewis Arquette, was well known as “J.D. Pickett” on “The Waltons.” Her siblings Patricia Arquette, David Arquette, Alexis Arquette, and Richmond Arquette all followed her into the family tradition as accomplished working actors. She began acting as a child while growing up in a bohemian atmosphere of gypsy-like travel and communes. Her mother, Mardi, was a poet, political activist, and therapist who deeply influenced Rosanna’s compassionate worldview.\n\n​\n\nRosanna started working professionally as a teenager and has never stopped. She has appeared in over 70 films, which have earned over $450 million in domestic box office sales. Her vast experience in the world of film and television has inspired her to explore and expand her talent as a filmmaker into the realm of directing and producing with two highly acclaimed documentaries, 2002’s “Searching for Debra Winger” and 2005’s “All We Are Saying.” She is currently developing projects for both television and film through her company, Flower Child Productions."
