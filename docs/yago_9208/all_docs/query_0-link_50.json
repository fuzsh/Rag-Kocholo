        "text": "What’s the anatomy of a fall movie season? Although the writers’ and actors’ strikes have kept Hollywood in suspense, the calendar is, for now, still filled with exciting titles, including work from established masters (Martin Scorsese, Sofia Coppola, David Fincher) and relative breakouts like Justine Triet, the director of, well, “Anatomy of a Fall,” which won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival in May. Here is a select list of features coming to theaters and streaming services beginning later this month. (Pedro Almodóvar and Wes Anderson, among other directors, are releasing shorts but those are not included.) Release dates and platforms are subject to change.\n\nSeptember\n\nTHE SAINT OF SECOND CHANCES Morgan Neville (“Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”) and Jeff Malmberg (“Marwencol”) directed this documentary on Mike Veeck, son of the Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck, and his efforts to make amends after enabling Disco Demolition Night, the disastrous 1979 promotion at Comiskey Park. (Sept. 19 on Netflix)\n\nEXPEND4BLES Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham and Dolph Lundgren enjoy a fourth hurr4h as mercenaries.
