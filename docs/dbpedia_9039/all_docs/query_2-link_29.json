        "text": "(1940–2017). American singer Al Jarreau was one of America’s foremost jazz vocalists. He was known as the Acrobat of Scat, a vocal style that grew out of 1940s bebop and used nonsense syllables and words. While legendary singers Billie Holiday and Nat King Cole performed scat by imitating saxophones and trumpets, Jarreau’s eclectic, modernized version mimicked electronic and percussive sounds.\n\nAlwyn Lopez Jarreau was born on March 12, 1940, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Emile, a Seventh-day Adventist minister and welder, and Pearl, a church pianist. Jarreau grew up listening to a variety of music, from gospel and soul to country and popular show tunes. During high school he became highly interested in jazz, which he later pursued as an undergraduate student at Ripon College and then as a graduate student at the University of Iowa. After receiving his master’s degree in 1964, Jarreau went to work as a counselor for handicapped people in San Francisco, California. By 1968, however, he left counseling to devote himself to music full time.\n\nJarreau sang in several San Francisco area clubs and later worked briefly in Los Angeles, California, and New York, New York. Although his performances received positive reviews, he was unable to secure a recording contract because his style did not fit the musical climate of the late 1960s. After a period in Milwaukee during which he fronted his own jazz band, Jarreau returned to Los Angeles and caught the attention of a Warner Bros. Records executive, who signed him to a contract. Jarreau’s debut album for Warner Bros., We Got By (1975), featured mostly original songs and showcased his versatile and creative style of scat. His next few albums—Glow (1975), Look to the Rainbow (1977), All Fly Home (1980), and This Time (1981)—were well received, particularly by young audiences attracted to his unique sound. His commercial breakthrough came, however, with the pop-oriented, Grammy-winning Breakin’ Away (1981), which featured the hit single “We’re in This Love Together.”\n\nOver the years Jarreau’s pop-funk style was often criticized by the music press for being too commercial. Nevertheless, Jarreau continued to delight audiences with his constantly evolving blend of vocal styles. His award-winning soundtrack for the popular 1980s television series Moonlighting widened his audience. In the 1980s and ’90s he continued to perform throughout the United States and abroad and collaborated with other artists, including jazz musicians David Sanborn and Joe Sample, jazz vocalist Bobby McFerrin, and opera singer Kathleen Battle. Ain’t No Sunshine (1996), featuring the hit title track and “Lean on Me,” was followed by the compilation Best of Al Jarreau (1996)."
