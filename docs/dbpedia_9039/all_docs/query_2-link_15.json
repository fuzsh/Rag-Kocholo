        "text": "The loss of jazz vocalist legend Al Jarreau sent ripples throughout the music world after news of his passing on Sunday. The legendary singer enjoyed a history-making career, becoming the first artist to win a Grammy Award across three different categories.\n\nAlwin Lopez Jarreau was born March 12, 1940 in Milwaukee, Wisc. The son of a minster father and church pianist mother, Jarreau began singing in choirs early on. As a student at Ripon College, Jarreau continued to sing in groups but school and a making a living were priorities. After earning his master’s degree from the University of Iowa, Jarreau enjoyed a brief stint as a social worker in the Bay Area.\n\nJarreau began making himself known in jazz circles in the late ’60’s, jamming with George Duke and other jazz stalwarts. After releasing his debut album 1965 that same year, Jarreau became a full-time musician. But it would be another 10 years before he released another album – 1975’s We Got By.\n\nThat release truly started his career as a prolific recording artist who was celebrated as an innovative live performer.\n\nJarreau made history as the first Grammy winner across the genres of jazz, pop, and R&B. He has been nominated several times including in 2013 for Best Jazz Album and Best Children’s Album.\n\nHealth problems began to plague Jarreau around 2010 and he had to cancel tours across Europe. He fell ill again in 2012 with pneumonia, but made a full recovery and continued a strenuous tour schedule up until this year. Just days ago, he retired from touring and was hospitalized for exhaustion.\n\nJarreau was married twice. His first marriage, to Phyllis Hall, lasted from 1964 to 1968. His second wife was model Susan Elaine Player, whom he married in 1977. Jarreau and Player had one son together, Ryan. The cause of Jarreau’s death has not been made available to the public. He was 76."
