        "text": "I think Al Jarreau's best period is this run from 1978 to 1983. His music became much more commercial and pop after All Fly Home. I would recommend starting with All Fly Home and Jarreau (the earliest and latest of this run), then work your way to This Time and Breakin' Away. If you like the jazzier Al Jarreau, you can check out his albums before All Fly Home. The albums after Jarreau sound very 1980s in their production.\n\n1978: All Fly Home\n\n1980: This Time\n\n1981: Breakin' Away\n\n1983: Jarreau\n\nThis period is bookended by two very good live albums. Look to the Rainbow, the earlier one, is more jazz. In London, the later one, is Jarreau as pop star.\n\n1977: Look To The Rainbow\n\n1984: In London\n\nI could recommend any of the six above. If had to narrow down where you should start to learn about this artist, I'd pick All Fly Home, Jarreau and Look To The Rainbow.\n\nAudiophile notes: Friday Music has reissued some of Al Jarreau's albums on CD, some with bonus tracks, including Jarreau and In London from my recommendations above. Friday Music also put out a twofer of We Got By (1975) and Glow (1976) on one CD. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab issued All Fly Home on vinyl in the late 1970s."
