        "text": "Haven't heard anything from Monster and their \"super disc\" in quite awhile - this could be a good one -From today's Billboard online;\n\nJazz veterans George Benson and Al Jarreau are joined by some big names on their first collaborative album, \"Givin' It Up.\" Due Oct. 24 via Concord/Monster Music, the set features Paul McCartney on a version of Sam Cooke's \"Bring It on Home to Me,\" Jill Scott on Billie Holiday's \"God Bless the Child\" and Patti Austin and Chris Botti on \"Let It Rain.\"\n\nElsewhere, Benson and Jarreau put new spins on each other's material. Jarreau has added lyrics and vocals to Benson's instrumental hit \"Breezin',\" while Benson recasts Jarreau's \"Mornin'\" as an instrumental. The pair also covers Paul Young's \"Every Time You Go Away,\" John Legend's \"Ordinary People,\" Miles Davis' \"Four\" and \"Long Come Tutu\" and Seals & Croft's \"Summer Breeze.\"\n\nAmong the musicians contributing to the sessions are Herbie Hancock, bassists Marcus Miller and Stanley Clarke and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta. Monster Music is releasing \"Givin' It Up\" as a two-CD SuperDisc package, featuring a variety of high resolution audio mixes.\n\nBravo! I asked a member, RBFilms, at AVSForums recently about the next Monster Music release since we hadn't seen anything announced or discussed in months. He indicated this was coming soon and would be exceptional. Does Concord own the Monster Music label? I guess this means no more Concord SACD's.\n\nChris\n\nConcord and Monster are separate entities that enjoy a licensing/partnership arrangement for specific titles (Ray Charles, Charlie Brown, Peter Cincotti) - as this is the first actual new release via Monster, I imagine that Concord will take the reins in marketing the record to the traditional music marketplace and Monster will handle the specialty/Electronic store markets.\n\nConcord and SACD are a separate issue - while Telarc and Heads Up are now owned by Concord, they are ( for the time being) operating as stand alone companies and will continue to support SACD - Concord, it appears, will be putting select titles thru Monster to appeal the surround market - this all could change of course in a moments notice."
