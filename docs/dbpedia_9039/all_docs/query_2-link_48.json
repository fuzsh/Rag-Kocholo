        "text": "Los Angeles-based vocalist Al Jarreau (1940) started out as a promising purveyor of improvised vocals on We Got By (march 1975), around themes entirely composed by him. That art mutated into elegant pop-jazz ballads such as Alonzo on This Time (may 1980), Roof Garden on Breakin' Away (1981), but his fame came as an interpreter of faceless soul ballads, such as Mornin' and Boogie Down on Jarreau (1983), later penned by his producers or professional songwriters.\n\nJarreau died in 2017."
