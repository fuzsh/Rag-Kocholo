        "text": "Al Jarreau says his parents' advice went something like this: \"Be mobile socially and economically and do well, young colored boy.\"\n\nHe took their counsel to heart, but not the way they had intended.\n\nHe abandoned a stable career as a rehabilitation counselor to become a jazz singer.\n\nThe folks back home in Milwaukee may have been alarmed at first, but eight albums and dozens of awards later, Jarreau has fulfilled their fondest wishes.\n\nWith his ninth LP set for release in August, Jarreau's latest American tour will bring him to Oklahoma City's Zoo Amphitheater at 7:30 p.m. next Sunday.\n\n\"I think I'm happy with the choice,\" the singer mused in a recent phone interview with The Oklahoman.\n\nIt just took him a while to make that choice. He was 28, with a master's degree in psychology from the University of Iowa and 3 1/2 years as a rehabilitation counselor in San Francisco, when he decided to take the plunge.\n\n{\"My mother and father come from that post-Depression, middle of World War II kind of thinking that says,\" and Jarreau affected a comical Yiddish accent here \" \"Find a practical job. You know what I mean, Mr. Big Shot? So, you can sing a song ...' \"And I really took that stuff to heart, man. That's where I was headed, and so doggedly that it took me, really, 28 years before I considered doing the thing that I loved most.\"\n\nWhat Jarreau loved most was singing. \"I'd been doing it since I was 4 years old and had been making money at it on a regular basis since I was 14. And people seemed to enjoy hearing me do it.\"\n\nEven by the time he was deeply entrenched in the 9-to-5 of California's Division of Rehabilitation, Jarreau was still plying his avocation three nights a week in Frisco's jazz clubs. Those after-hours gigs included a long stint as vocalist with a then-unknown pianist named George Duke.\n\n\"We were two guys who hadn't gotten their careers happening, but were good little journeyman players ... drawing people as much as Wes Montgomery and other cats who were comin' through town and makin' music.\n\n\"I was really learning my craft as a jazz singer and working with some great players and all really growing and feeling my wings. And I started thinking, \"I don't wanna be here in rehabilitation anymore.' \"So I made a deal with myself: \"Self, you can always return to this, or something like this. But you really owe it to yourself to give it a try ... Self, you enjoy singing so much, how could you not try something that might fly?' \" In 1968, Jarreau quit his counseling job. It tok another seven years of dues-paying on the Los Angeles and Frisco club circuits, but he finally landed a recording contract with Warner Brothers Records and released his first LP, \"We Got By,' in 1975.\n\nA subsequent European tour won him a German Grammy for Best New International Soloist.\n\nHis second album, \"Glow,\" garnered another German Grammy for Best International Artist in 1976. His live double album, released in '77, brought him both the Male Vocalist and Best New Jazz Act awards in Performance magazine polls. The French Music Academy voted him Vocalist of the Year.\n\nAdditional plaudits from Downbeat, Cashbox and Stereo Review were topped off with his first American Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Performance of 1977.\n\nThe following year saw the release of his fourth LP, \"All Fly Home,\" another American Grammy for Best Male Vocal in jazz, and numerous poll honors.\n\nCritics raved over his \"astonishing interpretive skills,\" his \"subtle shades of emotional meaning\" and his \"delicate care and unerring sense of drama.\"\n\nYet, despite the ado, Jarreau's record sales were little better than modest in the U.S. until 1981's \"Breakin' Away.\"\n\nOn that LP, Jarreau took his first shot at the mainstream audience, blending elements of funk, rhythm 'n' blues and pop into the basic jazz formula.\n\n\"It was a direct, conscious, planned effort to do some things we think just make any music more understandable, without taking anything away from its content.\"\n\nThe platinum-awarded \"Breakin' Away\" marked Jarreau's first project with producer Jay Graydon, who suggested the singer include a few R&B ballads and funky dance tunes with the usual contemporary jazz repertoire.\n\nJarreau recalls, \"He said, \"Let's find some great jazz tunes and you just sing and scat your brains out. But then I want you to sing a ballad like Frank Sinatra would sing it. And then let's be the good ol' R&B singer.' \" Always one to take good advice just like he did from his mom and dad Jarreau re-tailored his style and produced his first million-selling album, which included a couple of hit singles to boot: \"We're in This Love Together\" and the LP's title tune. Two albums later (\"Jarreau\" and \"High Crime\"), mom and pop's would-be psychologist is a bona fide singing star playing to standing room only audiences all over the world as socially and economically mobile as can be.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Jarreau with tongue-in-cheek nonchalance, \"I've noticed the audiences have been growing.\" BIOG: NAME:\n\nArchive ID: 237843"
