At Badger Boys State (an eight day program that teaches young men about the civic processes of Wisconsin's government) Jarreau was elected governor. Another Wisconsinite, Daniel Travanti, Emmy award-winning actor best known for his role on televison show, Hill Street Blues, also attended Badger Boys State in 1957.

Jarreau's last big hit was the Grammy-nominated theme to the 1980s American television show Moonlighting, for which he wrote the lyrics.
