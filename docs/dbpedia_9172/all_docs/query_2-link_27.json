        "text": "Odessa\n\nYalta\n\nWell know for the famous agreements that were signed in 1945 to settle the fate of Europe after the fall of the Third Reich, Yalta is primarily a resort town known as the most popular in the periphery of the Black Sea after the Tsar Alexander II chose the closer city of Livavia as a summer residence. However, it had a relative economic decline after the fall of the Soviet regime, as rich people preferred to stay in the deserted stations resorts of Western Europe. Ideally located on the southern coast of Crimea, Yalta has many walks to be performed on pebble beaches, before visiting the Cathedral of St. Alexander Nevsky, a fine example of neo-Byzantine, or the former summer residence of the Romanov palace in a Renaissance style surrounded by a beautiful French garden. Finally, the house in which the great Russian composer Chekhov spent the last five years of his life was converted into a museum, and has become a must for any admirer of the composer.\n\nPicture : Yalta Â© Ukrainian ambassy in Paris"
