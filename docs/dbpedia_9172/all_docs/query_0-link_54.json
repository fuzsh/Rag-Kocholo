        "text": "Brief historical context\n\nIn 1917, against the background of the First World War, the Russian Empire collapsed. First, after the February Revolution, the monarchy was abolished. Then, in October, the Bolsheviks staged a coup and actually started a civil war. Then, the various nations that were part of the empire, including the Ukrainian one, began to fight for their national states.\n\nThe other participants of the First World War — the Quadruple Alliance and the Entente — did not remain aloof. It was profitable for the first to weaken their adversary, the Russian Empire, so they went to negotiations with the Bolsheviks and the leadership of the Ukrainian Peopleʼs Republic. In February 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was concluded, under the terms of which Poland, the Baltic States, Ukraine, and Transcaucasia were occupied by the troops of the Quadruple Alliance.\n\nOn the contrary, the Entente tried to keep its ally Russia, at least in the form of a federation. And also — to prevent the \"export of the Bolshevik revolution\" to Central and Western Europe. Therefore, in December 1917, the Entente and the Allied Powers divided the territories of the former Russian Empire into spheres of influence: Britain got the North and the Caucasus, France got Ukraine and the Crimea, Japan and the United States got the Far East. After the defeat of the Quadruple Alliance in the First World War in November 1918, it was the French who had to replace the Austrian-German troops on the Ukrainian territories. And France began its intervention with landings in large Black Sea cities, one of which was Odesa."
