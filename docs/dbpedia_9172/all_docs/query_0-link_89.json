        "text": "ODESSA, UKRAINE — Ukraine sent an elite national guard unit to its southern port of Odessa, desperate to halt a spread of the fighting between government troops and a pro-Russia militia in the east that killed combatants on both sides Monday.\n\nThe government in Kiev intensified its attempts to bring both regions back under its control but seemed particularly alarmed by the bloodshed in Odessa. It had been largely peaceful until Friday, when clashes killed 46 people, many of them in a government building that was set on fire.\n\nThe tensions in Ukraine also raised concerns in neighboring Moldova, another former Soviet republic, where the government said late Monday it had put its borders on alert. Moldova’s breakaway Trans-Dniester region, just northwest of Odessa and home to 1,500 Russian troops, is supported by Moscow, and many of its residents sympathize with the pro-Russia insurgency.\n\nThe loss of Odessa — in addition to a swath of industrial eastern Ukraine — would be catastrophic for the interim government in Kiev, leaving the country cut off from the Black Sea. Ukraine already lost a significant part of its coastline in March, when its Crimean Peninsula was annexed by Russia.\n\nCompared with eastern Ukraine, Odessa is a wealthy city with an educated and ethnically diverse population of more than 1 million. Jews still make up 12 percent of the population of the city, which once had a large Jewish community.\n\n“The people of Odessa are well-educated and understand perfectly well that Russia is sowing the seeds of civil war and destabilization in Ukraine,” said Vladimir Kureichik, a 52-year-old literature teacher who left Crimea after it became part of Russia.\n\nThe White House said it was “extremely concerned” by the violence in southern Ukraine.\n\n“The events in Odessa dramatically underscore the need for an immediate de-escalation of tensions in Ukraine,” said spokesman Jay Carney. He suggested Russia still must follow through with its part of a diplomatic deal aimed at defusing the tensions.\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, gunfire and multiple explosions rang out in and around Slovyansk, a city of 125,000 in the Russian-speaking heartland that has become the focus of the armed insurgency against the government in Kiev.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry put the blame squarely on Kiev, which “stubbornly continues to wage war against the people of its own country.” The ministry urged what it called the “Kiev organizers of the terror” to pull back the troops and hold peaceful negotiations to resolve the crisis.\n\nUkrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said in a statement that government troops were battling about 800 pro-Russia forces, which were deploying large-caliber weapons and mortars. His ministry reported four officers killed and 30 wounded in the fighting.\n\nThe pro-Russia militia said at least eight people, both militiamen and local residents, were killed. A spokesman with the militia said that out of 10 people admitted to a hospital in Slovyansk with gunshot wounds, three later died. Five more were killed in fighting in the village of Semenivka.\n\nBoth sides indicated fighting was taking place at several sites. At least four ambulances rushed wounded to a hospital in Slovyansk and one militiaman was carried in for treatment.\n\nThis nation of 46 million is facing its worst crisis in decades after its Moscow-leaning president, whose base was in the east, fled to Russia in February following months of street protests. Those eastern regions are now at odds with Ukraine’s western and central areas, which seek closer ties with Europe and largely back the government in Kiev.\n\nThe West has offered billions of dollars of loans to help Kiev stave off economic collapse. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Ukraine expects to receive more than $5 billion in May, according to a government statement Monday. This includes $3 billion from the International Monetary Fund, $1 billion from the U.S. and up to 1 billion euros from the European Union.\n\nThe goal of the pro-Russia insurgency is ostensibly to push for broader autonomy in the east, but some do favor seceding from Ukraine and joining with Russia.\n\nIn recent weeks, pro-Russia forces have stormed and seized government buildings and police stations in a dozen eastern cities. Kiev accuses Moscow of backing the insurgents and fears Russia could use the violence as a pretext to invade. Tens of thousands of Russian troops have been deployed along Ukraine’s eastern border.\n\nBut even as violence spread across the east, Odessa largely had been tranquil until Friday, when pro-Ukrainian demonstrators fought back after being attacked by pro-Russian groups.\n\n“We feel ourselves to be residents of a free city, Europeans,” said Denis Sukhomlinsky, a 34-year-old businessman who took part in the clashes. “We don’t need the Russian iron hand or the dictatorship of (President Vladimir) Putin.”\n\nPro-Russia activists, however, echo Putin in describing the region as historically part of Russia. Nearly 30 percent of Odessa’s residents identify themselves as Russian.\n\n“We will not become the slaves of NATO and the European Union and will fight to the end,” said Vyacheslav Khrutsky, 45.\n\nPro-Russia activists gathered at a funeral for a regional member of parliament, Vyacheslav Markin, who died two days after the fire from his burns. Markin was known for speaking out against the Kiev government. Activists shouted “Hero! Hero!” and vowed to avenge him.\n\nThe city remained calm, however, and Ukrainian flags flew all over the city — unlike in the east, where pro-Moscow groups have replaced them with the Russian tricolor.\n\nThe Interior Ministry also said it was sending an elite national guard unit from Kiev to re-establish control in Odessa, and the well-armed officers were seen on patrol.\n\nOn the outskirts of Kiev, checkpoints were set up Monday to control movement into the capital. Cars and buses with out-of-town license plates and other suspicious vehicles were stopped for inspection by police."
