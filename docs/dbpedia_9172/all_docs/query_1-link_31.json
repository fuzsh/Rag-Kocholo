        "text": "Judy Woodruff:\n\nA day of tenuous diplomacy and much more death in Ukraine.\n\nThe 12th day of Russia's invasion saw both sides meeting again on small steps toward allowing people out, but brutal violence has become the central feature of the war. More than 1.7 million Ukrainians have now left their homes for surrounding countries. The United Nations says more than 400 civilians have died in the fighting, although they admit that is likely a drastic undercount.\n\nMeantime, the U.S. said it estimates 4,500 Russian soldiers have been killed. One city that has not yet caught in the crossfire is Odessa in Ukraine's far southwest on the Black Sea.\n\nThat's where Nick Schifrin is tonight.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nDefending Ukraine's third largest city begins on its beaches. Odessans fill sandbags along the Black Sea to defend the city from Russian invasion.\n\nThey're all volunteers, an assembly line of workers for whom now this is their full-time job. In peaceful times, this was a yacht club; 58-year-old Albert Kabakov is the manager.\n\nDo you fear that Odessa could be targeted very soon?\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nIn 11 days, they have filled 300,000 bags, their battle cry, the national anthem. As this chorus still rings loud on this beach, in the city center, it has fallen silent.\n\nThis is the heart of the city, usually a bustling and loud street. But you can see everything here is completely closed. And, at the end of this street, Odessa's world's famous opera house, sandbagged, protected. This city, this country, Europe, has not seen this image in 80 years.\n\nThe last time Odessa's opera house came under siege was World War II, when German-allied Romanian troops occupied the city. Today, barbed wire and beach-filled sandbags protect active-duty soldiers deployed inside their home towns, streets normally full of cafes now strewn with anti-armor vehicle barricades known as hedgehogs. And hotels are protected by tires and Odessans who haven't lost their trademark humor, like Valentina Volanskaya, who, when I asked her age, said, people don't live that long.\n\nValentina Volanskaya, Resident of Odessa (through translator): Our city has been standing, is standing, and will always be standing. You understand? That's it. Odessa is the center of the world. You should know that. Why did you come here if you don't know that?\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nA senior U.S. defense official says Russia has now invaded Ukraine with nearly 100 percent of the 150,000-plus troops deployed to the border and occupied what's in dark pink. It is making the most progress in the south. Russian troops currently encircle Mariupol, where Ukraine exports agricultural coal and steel.\n\nLast Thursday, they occupied Kherson, a major shipbuilding hub with access to the coast. And now they're advancing toward Mykolaiv, about 80 miles to Odessa's east. Capturing Odessa would cut Kyiv off from the sea.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nMykolaiv is the last city to the east between Odessa and Russian ground troops. And Russia continues to bombard civilian targets.\n\nLeonid Fisyienko filmed what was left of his apartment, survivors in shock. And Ukraine said Russian troops are advancing toward the Yuzhnoukrainsk nuclear power plant 75 miles north Mykolaiv. Russia had offered humanitarian corridors today out of Mariupol, Kyiv, Sumy and Kharkiv. But Ukrainians would have had to flee to Russia or ally Belarus, the very government's trying to kill them.\n\nAnd, in Kharkiv, where the streets still look bombed out, and Kyiv, where residents trying to flee yesterday were killed by Russian shells, nobody took Moscow up on its offer.\n\nBut in Belarus today, Ukraine and Russia met for a third round of talks. There was no sign of any breakthrough. Back in Odessa, volunteers converted this food market into a collection point for essentially destined for the front. This used to be an oysters and sparkling wine bar. Now it's full of bags of clothes and basics that soldiers often lack.\n\nIt's run by 45-year-old Nikolai Vitnyanskiy.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nThat pride is evident in everything here, from how Ukrainians talk about their own country to have think about Russia.\n\nIn 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and instigated a war in Eastern Ukraine, only about 30 percent of Odessans considered themselves Ukrainian, according to the mayor's numbers. Judy, that number today of Odessans who consider themselves Ukrainian is 80 percent.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nThe mayor certainly does, in part because he does not think that Russia will resort to the kind of indiscriminate shelling that we have seen in other cities in Eastern and Southern Ukraine.\n\nBut that means that there could be urban warfare here, street-to-street fighting between Russians and Ukrainians. And that would undoubtedly cause major damage. But it's clear, talking to U.S. officials, that they do not believe that the seizure of Odessa can begin until Russian forces takeover Mykolaiv about 80 miles to the east.\n\nAnd so far, Judy, Ukrainian soldiers have managed to resist Russian efforts to occupy that city.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nWell, there's that big number, 1.7 million people. That is more than 3 percent of the country who have felt that they had to become refugees, cross international borders with only what they could carry or they could put in their cars, and half that number are children.\n\nAnd, of course, there's an unknown number of Ukrainians who had to flee their homes, but are still inside Ukraine. But that number is undoubtedly high.\n\nBut there's another number tonight. One of Zelenskyy's top aides today said that the number of towns and villages across the country that don't have — that doesn't — that don't have electricity, plumbing, power is 1,000; 1,000 villages and towns across the country don't offer the basic services that so many Ukrainians need.\n\nAnd, Judy, this is only week two of a war that U.S., Western officials fear could last months."
