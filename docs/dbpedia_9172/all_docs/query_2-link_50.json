        "text": "Like so many activists in Ukraine’s much-heralded civil society, Serdiuk is doing everything in his power to support the Ukrainian cause. This is “total resistance,” Serdiuk said, as taken straight from US Army special operations manuals, translated from the Swiss original: Everyone from street sweepers to university deans is pitching in to disrupt enemy operations and defend the country in any way possible. From Odessa, Ukrainian military drones—some of them purchased through crowdfunding and assembled by volunteers—have hounded the Russian navy. Yes, he said, Ukraine has suffered setbacks recently, but these little towns, like Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine, which capitulated in February, are next to meaningless. Russia, he admitted, has learned lessons since the war’s onset, when it was shamed by Ukrainian forces that pushed them back not only from Kyiv but also from Odessa.\n\nThe Russian military’s spring 2022 assault on Odessa when its navy and air force bombarded the port for weeks, while undercover Russian agents wreaked havoc from within the city, is still evident. Jutting forlornly into the sea, the burned-out skeleton of the 19-story Hotel Odessa is just one example. But the Ukraine army prevailed by blocking the Russians’ access to Odessa at Mykolaiv, a city to its east; and the citizenry rallied, sandbagging infrastructure and historical monuments, fortifying beaches, and mining the harbor. Restaurants prepared meal after meal for the volunteers and soldiers. Businesses donated trucks and jeeps. In April, the Ukrainians sank the Moskva, the jewel of Russia’s Black Sea fleet.\n\nUkraine has learned a thing or two since then, too, and these lessons have been woven into its military strategies, Serdiuk said. Ukraine’s casualties—31,000 according to official sources, four times that according to US estimates—is acceptable, he allowed. The Ukraine armed forces are back, and on track, he said. All they need is the right weaponry. And this is going to come from the West—sooner rather than later, for its own good. The rules-based order is at stake here, he said—again, echoing everyone with whom I spoke with—and if anyone thinks Putin will stop with Ukraine, they are sorely, sorely mistaken.\n\nWhen I broached the idea of negotiations with Russia, a peace process or cease-fire of some sort, Serdiuk responded like his countrymen: “In order for there to be negotiations, there has to be trust, and there is none. We’d trust Stalin before Putin. Putin lied and lied and lied, why would he stop?”\n\nAd Policy\n\nOnly toward the end of a two-hour discussion, which included a few whiskeys in an Odessa eatery, did Mikhail Shtekel, a media professional of mixed Jewish Tatar background, finally admit that, yes, there are “unhappy scenarios for Ukraine too.” And what did he mean by that, I asked? “Putin conquers Ukraine,” he spat out, as if I had intentionally served him a bad oyster. The war’s outcome is the hands of the West, he said. And what if Donald Trump is elected, I pushed him? “We really don’t know what Trump will do. In the end, whether Trump becomes president and doesn’t do anything or Biden is reelected and continues to give us support to live another day but not to win, what’s the difference? The problem is that there’s no real will to crush the Putin regime. You think Russia can’t lose.”\n\nThe Ukrainians’ unbending will is profound and heartbreaking. As I tried gently to intimate, it may not be in touch with reality. Russia has regeared its economy to all-out wartime production, enabling it to manufacture many times the quantity of ammunition that Ukraine can. The Western sanctions against Russia—complete with tent-size loopholes—has not undermined it as hoped. Of course, the West could plug those gaps and speed up the delivery of serious weaponry to Ukraine, including German Tauris missiles, many more F-16s, and other hardware. Shtetel told me that whenever the requisite materiel is there, Ukraine prevails on the battlefield.\n\nA Negotiated Peace?\n\nPopular\n\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →\n\nHow a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest\n\nFeature / James North\n\nThe DNC Opens to an Urgent Cry: No More Bombs to Israel The DNC Opens to an Urgent Cry: No More Bombs to Israel\n\nSarah Lazare\n\n‘Little Guantánamo’ Gets Bigger ‘Little Guantánamo’ Gets Bigger\n\nInteractive / Nausheen Husain, Aly Panjwani, and Haley Moreland\n\nThe Cost of Trying to Make Palestinian Lives Matter in the Newsroom The Cost of Trying to Make Palestinian Lives Matter in the Newsroom\n\nHoda Sherif\n\nA host of statesmen and politicos—some openly, others behind the scenes—are pursuing a negotiated settlement. EU High Representative Josep Borrell visited Ukraine in February talking about a “Korea solution,” but with no specifics on exactly what that would look like or how it would come to pass. As keen as many diplomats may be on stopping the war—who isn’t?—very few speak in detail of what this would, in their minds, entail. Certainly, it means territorial sacrifices on the part of Ukraine. But what lands exactly? Crimea and a slice of eastern Ukraine? How big a slice? “This is what no one says,” explained Viacheslav Tuliakov, a legal scholar in Odessa. There is no sign, he said, that the Russian president is satisfied with what the Russian military currently occupies. Putin wants much more of Ukraine—including Odessa.\n\nIndeed, Odessa, Ukraine’s third-largest city and the gateway to the Black Sea, is critical to Putin’s plans, as he has expressed explicitly and regularly. “The whole southeast of Ukraine has always been pro-Russian because these are historically Russian territories,” he said in late 2023, in contravention of historical fact and certainly of the sympathies of practically all of Odessa’s people today—Ukrainian, Russian, Jewish, and others. “Odessa,” states Putin, is a Russian city.”\n\nThe takeaway from the rambling fiction: Odessa is central to Putin’s war aims. Its capture would cut off Ukraine’s access to world markets and give Putin a lever to control grain exports to much of the developing world.\n\nThe only person in Odessa willing to talk to me about the possibility of a negotiated peace was an Italian businessman, involved for years in Ukraine. “It’s a very delicate subject, of course, because no one wants to be seen as weakening Zelensky or encouraging Putin. Ukrainians’ will to resist against all odds is what has them still here, now,” he said. As far as he is concerned, a deal that gifted the war-battered, rust-belt swaths of eastern Ukraine to Russia in exchange for a free hand for the rest of Ukraine to join the EU would be a blessing for Ukraine, which it could sell as a victory. But Putin, he feared, wants more than that.\n\nAs for Milimko, her teenage kids and their grandmothers may be in Vienna, but she’s not going anywhere. Just as reinforcements showed up for the Potemkin, she’s convinced, so too will they for Ukraine."
