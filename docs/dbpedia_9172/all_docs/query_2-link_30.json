En choisissant Odessa comme objet d’étude, ce travail apprécie comment, par le biais de sa politique des nationalités, l’Union soviétique a géré l’antisémitisme, haine des plus anciennes et des plus intenses nourrie sur son territoire. Il retrace l’évolution des relations entre juifs et non juifs à Odessa depuis la fin de la période impériale en passant par les années de la domination soviétique jusqu’à l’occupation roumaine et allemande de la ville pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale et présente les changements dramatiques qui survinrent dans les opinions et les comportements des résidents odessites, résultat premier de la socialisation sous le régime soviétique. La période de l’occupation roumaine permet de tester les « réalisations » soviétiques potentielles en ce qui concerne le combat de l’État contre l’antisémitisme dans la mesure où la Roumanie participait à l’Holocauste et encourageait la population non juive à trahir ses voisins juifs. La présente étude fait appel aux travaux de recherche existants sur la politique soviétique des nationalités, elle contribue à éclairer certains aspects de cette politique restés obscurs jusqu’à ce jour et, aussi, à faciliter la compréhension des mécanismes responsables de l’absorption des normes et des idées promues par l’État.",

        "text": "1The USSR vanished at the turn of the 1990s, but the debates about the “Soviet experiment” and its puzzling legacy are more alive than ever. Since its collapse, an army of social scientists has closely studied the Soviet Union’s various facets, attempting to distinguish between the utopian state’s real and the declared transformation. The distinctive form of nationalism promoted in the Soviet state has been a permanent object of academic interest and led to various contradicting interpretations of intended goals and achieved results.\n\n4This paper aims to explore the ability of Soviet citizens to internalize state policies focusing on interethnic relations, and this is achieved through a case study assessing how Soviet nationality policies dealt with one of the oldest and intense animosities that existed on its territory: antisemitism. Throughout Russian history, antisemitism has been among the most widespread, violent, and resilient forms of hatred towards a people, and it therefore acts as a particularly difficult problem to solve for the state. If Soviet policies could be seen as successful in this case, it would go a long way towards demonstrating a broader Soviet ability to penetrate its citizenry with fresh values unknown in the Tsarist era. The detailed information and eyewitness testimonies required for such an analysis must be gathered in a small area for analysis to be rigorous. In this context, Odessa makes a suitable subject.\n\nThe issue of antisemitism in the USSR prior to and during the occupation\n\nThe Soviet fight against antisemitism\n\nAntisemitism on Soviet territories during the Second World War\n\nAntisemitism in Odessa: From the late tsarist period into the Soviet Times\n\nThe pre-Soviet landscape\n\n50 Cited in Herlihy, Odessa: A History, 1794-1914, 255.\n\nYet, at the same time we all lived in rigidly separated national groups, especially we Jews. Without any propaganda, without any ideology, we ten Jews used to sit on one row of benches in class, next to one another […]. In the [1890s], even antisemitism drowsed – not, Heaven forbid, in the government, but in society. We were quite friendly with our Christian classmates, even intimate with them, but we lived apart and considered it a natural thing that could not be otherwise… The five Poles, I recall, used to sit always in the “Polish corner,” like the three Greeks, the three Armenians, and the two Moldavians in theirs.\n\nOdessa’s Jews in the interwar period (1921-1941)\n\n24The testimonies of Odessa’s Jewish natives have helped us gain a unique insight into Jewish-gentile relationships in that city during the interwar and Second World War periods. As mentioned earlier, most of these materials belong to the Yad Vashem collection documenting the Holocaust: therefore, the description of these relations was not the goal of respondents’ narratives, but it was frequently made in the form of tangential references which we had to carefully collect and assemble. Despite great differences in content, a number of recurrent themes and observations throughout the testimonies depict common experiences from that period.\n\nOdessa’s Jews and non-Jews during the Second World War\n\n36For younger Jews, the newly established Romanian rule’s racist policies came as a profound shock. Seventeen-year old David Starodinskii was among numerous men of various nationalities arrested on the second day of occupation; he remembered how a Romanian soldier approached the column of men, looked at him and asked: “Jidan [Yid]?” Starodinskii wrote afterwards about his reaction:\n\nThis may look strange or maybe even funny, but at that time I did not understand the meaning of the question. I was raised in an environment where the nationality question never came up; I did not even know the nationality of my school mates.\n\nAbsence of pogroms\n\nState-led violence and persecution\n\n47A description of the situation by a then-schoolboy reveals the tragic setting:\n\n106 Ibid., The recollection and verses of the schoolboy Lev Rozhnetsky, April 4-August 16, 1944, 125.\n\nOn January 11, Anatoly (who was just getting over typhus), Mama, and I were forcibly taken to Slobodka. They took us and led us off at three in the morning. Temperatures were well below freezing. The snow was up to our knees. They drove us along in a crowd. Many people – the elderly and children – died right there in the streets of Peresyp (on the outskirts of the city) in a howling blizzard.\n\nCriminal opportunism\n\n134 YVA, O.3/7592, interview with Iakov Manevici (1994), p. 10.\n\nfor the sake of truth it is worthwhile mentioning [that] a huge number of locals, when these crowds [convoys of Jews] were passing by, expressed condolences, but under the threat of repressions could not get involved.\n\nGentile support for the Jewish population\n\n59While acts of violence and opportunism were ever-present, there is much more to say about Jewish – non-Jewish relationships. As mentioned above, Odessa’s Jews had been an integral part of the prewar Soviet social environment with frequent intermarriages, a shared Russian language, and meaningful connections with other ethnic groups. As a result, the Jews of Odessa were able to draw on their extensive social capital.\n\nConclusion\n\n72Nineteenth-century Odessa was known as a city where local Jewry acculturated to the gentile culture with a special verve. Nevertheless, this phenomenon did not remove existent social barriers between its Jews and Christians, nor did it impede violent pogroms erupting sporadically in the city. Soviet power tried to override this inherited antisemitism and launched a sound set of measures intended to integrate its Jews effectively and create new, positive connections between these two historically acrimonious groups. Odessa went through a radical change in its environment during those interwar years: Jewish accounts provide strong evidence of a particularly friendly ambiance and a significant decline in antisemitism.\n\n73During the period of Romanian rule, the Soviet “friendship of the peoples” was put to a severe test, with the gentile population given the opportunity and even encouragement to victimize the Jewish population. Unlike Jews living in other areas of Central and Eastern Europe where this opportunity was seized upon by large swaths of the non-Jewish population who engaged in violent pogroms and antisemitic violence, the Jews of Odessa did not suffer mass violence at the hands of non-Jewish inhabitants. During the war, the Jewish population of Odessa continued to be perceived by gentile residents as city fellows, even if proscribed by the new regime. In the light of available data it seems likely that the youth, intelligentsia, and other members of society had internalized, at least partially, the values endorsed by the Soviet regime. Thus, inhabitants from various social strata and national backgrounds showed wartime solidarity with Jewish victims, and displayed a reserved attitude towards the hierarchical racial system introduced by the Romanian and German authorities. As noted, there was a group of Odessans involved in denunciation, abuse, and persecution of their Jewish and non-Jewish neighbors, perhaps because of responsibilities assigned by occupational authorities or due to personal greed and feelings of hostility. We speculated, based on limited evidence, that those people tended to be older and with lower educational backgrounds, which would have made them potentially less subject to Soviet ideology. More research needs to be conducted in this area.\n\n74Yitzhak Arad’s article, which we mentioned earlier, concludes that in the regions that had experienced 23 years of Soviet rule, “the local people generally related to the Jews with greater restraint and less overt manifestations of hatred” than in the territories acquired by the USSR in 1940.165 Odessa’s case fits that pattern and consolidates Arad’s line of argument. Accordingly, relations between the Jews and non-Jews in World War II Odessa resembled more the ones in Belarus’s Minsk than those in West Ukraine’s Lviv. Arguably, this case study indicates that despite the long history of antisemitism in Odessa, the Soviet policy of national amalgamation had somewhat been internalized by the city’s residents. Soviet prewar socialization and integration appear to have had an impact not only on the outward behavior of its citizens, but also on the mutual perceptions of ethnic categories."
