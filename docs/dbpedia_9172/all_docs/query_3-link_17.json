        "text": "Introduction\n\nA major seaport of Ukraine on the Black Sea, the city of Odesa (or Odessa) is an industrial and cultural center. The city lies on the northwestern shore of the sea near the mouth of the Dniester River. Odesa has cold winters and hot summers, but winter ice does not interfere with shipping.\n\nCityscape\n\nThe streets and boulevards of Odesa, a well-planned and handsome city, are laid out in regular, tree-lined blocks. The 192 Potemkin Steps, built in 1837–42 and made famous in Sergey Eisenstein’s film The Battleship Potemkin (1925), descend from a square in the city center to Odesa Bay. The quarrying of stone beneath the city has resulted in hundreds of miles of underground passages. These passages are called catacombs, though they are not used for burials.\n\nOdesa’s I.I. Mechnikov National University was founded in 1865. The city also has a polytechnic university and several academies. The Odesa Opera House, built in 1884–87, is considered to be one of the finest in Europe. The city is home to a number of museums, an observatory, concert halls, libraries, and a conservatory.\n\nEconomy\n\nOdesa is the outlet of a rich agricultural region and is a manufacturing and commercial center with good rail and air links. The city produces food and tobacco products, farm machinery, construction equipment, machine tools, shoes and clothing, and a variety of chemical products including fertilizers, paints, and dyes. In the early 21st century the city was home to a booming information technology sector.\n\nOdesa is one of the major ports of eastern Europe and has well-equipped docks and shipyards. The city is the base of a fishing fleet as well as the chief operational hub of the Ukrainian Navy. The seaside setting also has made Odesa a spa and resort, with 25 miles (40 kilometers) of sandy beaches that attract vacationers. There are many therapeutic mud baths and sanatoriums in the area.\n\nHistory\n\nIn ancient times a site near Odesa was occupied by a Greek colony called Odessos. In the 14th century a Tatar fortress called Khadzhibey was built on the site of what is now the city of Odesa. After a period of Lithuanian-Polish supremacy, the fortress passed to Turkey in 1764. The Russians gained possession in 1791 and began construction of a naval base and harbor three years later. The city was named Odesa, after the original Greek colony, in 1795. The 19th century was a period of rapid growth and foreign trade expansion, especially after the railway arrived in 1866. Odesa became one of Russia’s most important ports.\n\nThe city was one of the chief centers of the unsuccessful Russian Revolution of 1905 and was the scene of the massacre of many civilians following the mutiny on the warship Potemkin. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 Odesa was several times occupied by foreign troops before Soviet power was established. From 1941 to 1944 German troops occupied the city. Resistance fighters took shelter in the catacombs beneath the city, but almost 100,000 of the city’s large Jewish population were killed by the Nazis. Odesa was heavily damaged during the fighting but was completely rebuilt in the postwar years. Until 1991, when the Soviet Union broke up, it was capital of an oblast (province) in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Population (2021 estimate), 1,015,826."
