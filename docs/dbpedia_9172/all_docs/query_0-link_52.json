        "text": "On the ground: The view from a Ukrainian village under bombardment by pro-Russian forces\n\nVeronica, 9, will remember the day for the rest of her life. On Monday, a shell landed in her living room. Mercifully, she and her parents were in their kitchen, a separate building, when it struck.\n\nThe explosive ripped out the bathroom wall, and stripped the ground floor to its foundation. The concrete panels holding up the second floor now sag — they’re on the verge of collapse. The wooden staircase to the bedrooms trembles underfoot. Veronica’s room is strewn with detritus, its windows shattered by the shockwave.\n\nThe overriding fear for the people here in Novoluhanske, in eastern Ukraine, is not a full Russian invasion, but an escalation of the shelling they have already been living with for eight years.\n\nThey live in the Ukrainian-controlled part of the Donetsk Oblast, or region. Just a few hundred meters from here are the frontiers with the Russian-backed breakaway enclaves. The bombardment coming from those territories in the past five days is the worst the residents of this village have ever seen.\n\nOn the same day Veronica’s home was attacked, a shell landed in Roman Shirokiy’s driveway around the corner. He had heard the shelling, and was moving his car into the garage, hoping to shield it. The shrapnel ripped through his body, and he was killed.\n\nHe couldn’t be buried in his hometown, because the Novoluhanske cemetery was surrounded years ago by the fighting on the “contact line” — the frontline that separates pro-Russian rebels from Ukrainian forces — and is too dangerous to use. His wife wailed uncontrollably as he was laid to rest in the neighboring village.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has now declared that this village — and all of the Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts — is part of two new, independent countries. The drama and uncertainty of that decision only amplifies the abandonment felt by the people of Novoluhanske.\n\nUkraine given new warning by US of imminent Russian attack, officials say\n\nThe United States has issued a new warning to the Ukrainian government that the latest intelligence points to a full-scale Russian invasion imminently, according to Ukrainian, US and Western officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe new warning was conveyed on Tuesday morning local Kyiv time, according to three of the sources.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official said Ukraine has not verified the intelligence and noted that the United States has issued similar warnings before for assaults that ultimately did not materialize.\n\nNATO allies have been given a similar intelligence assessment warning of an imminent attack, according to a NATO military official. The official cautions that “no one knows for sure” what Putin is going to do.\n\nNews of the warning comes as the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for a state of emergency to be imposed across the country starting at midnight tonight in Ukraine.\n\nOf particular concern, the US warned, is the major northeastern city of Kharkiv, according to the senior Ukrainian official and a Western official familiar with the intelligence. The Ukrainian foreign minister said on Tuesday there were no plans to evacuate the city.\n\n“We do not have such plans,” Dmytro Kuleba said during a press conference in Washington alongside US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nSocial media videos geolocated and analyzed by CNN over the past several days show a continuing buildup of armor and support vehicles massing less than 30 kilometers (about 18 miles) across the border in Russia.\n\nUS officials have said that they anticipate both a ground invasion and airstrikes should Russia launch an attack.\n\n“Russian missiles and bombs will drop across Ukraine. Communications will be jammed. Cyberattacks will shut down key Ukrainian institutions,” Blinken said last week before the UN Security Council, describing how the US believed a Russian attack on Ukraine would unfold.\n\n“After that, Russian tanks and soldiers will advance on key targets that have already been identified and mapped out in detailed plans.”\n\nNewsweek first reported this story.\n\nThere have been nearly 60 violations of ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, defense ministry says\n\nIn its latest statement on violations of the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, the country’s defense ministry said that territory under Ukrainian control had been shelled 59 times from the self-declared republics of Luhansk and Donetsk as of 5 p.m. local time on Wednesday.\n\nOf those incidents, 54 involved weapons prohibited under the Minsk agreement, which stipulate that heavy weapons should not be within 50 kilometers of the front lines.\n\nOne Ukrainian service member was killed and another injured, according to the ministry.\n\nOn Tuesday, the ministry recorded 80 violations.\n\nSatellite images and video show growing concentrations of Russian armor close to Ukraine's borders\n\nThere are further indications that Russia continues to concentrate forces along the border with Ukraine, despite assertions from Moscow more than a week ago that many units would be returning to their permanent bases after exercises.\n\nSocial media videos geolocated and analyzed by CNN over the past several days show a continuing buildup of armor and support vehicles in two regions: around the Russian city of Belgorod and the town of Valuyki. Both are within 30 kilometers (about 18 miles) of Ukraine’s northeastern border, beyond which lies the major city of Kharkiv, Ukraine.\n\nDozens of stationary tanks and howitzers — along with other armor — could be observed in fields near Belgorod. Other videos showed a long column of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles parked beside a road between Belgorod and the Ukrainian border.\n\nSome of the formations appear to be considerably larger than those observed last week. Some units have been moving at night, according to videos from the Belgorod area.\n\nIn addition, fresh satellite images show that just west of Belgorod, a new field hospital has been constructed at a military site. Southwest of the city, additional troops and equipment are seen in satellite images.\n\nRussian military ambulances and transports have also been identified in areas near the Ukrainian border, as seen in videos posted to social media that CNN has been able to authenticate and geolocate.\n\nIn one of the videos, the ambulances are seen stationed in a wooded area near a park in Shebekino, Russia, less than five miles from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAmbulances have also been seen on the move as part of convoys in the Kursk areas, within 50 miles of the border.\n\nNew satellite images from Maxar Technologies show that in recent days, additional troops, vehicles and logistics infrastructure have also been deployed to Belarus. At an airfield just southwest of Mazyr, in southern Belarus, dozens of tents and vehicles have appeared in recent days. A satellite image from Feb. 4 shows the area was completely vacant. That airfield is just under 40 kilometers (about 24 miles) from Ukraine’s northern border.\n\nAdditionally, social media videos showed a substantial number of attack helicopters in southern Belarus near the city of Gomel. Their current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nBetween a week and 10 days ago, there was a flurry of announcements from Moscow, often accompanied by Russian Defense Ministry video that was sometimes contradictory, about units in the vicinity of Ukraine returning to base after exercises. But there have been no further announcements since.\n\nEuropean Council chief calls for emergency summit on Ukraine to be held Thursday\n\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel has called an emergency summit on Ukraine to be held on Thursday in Brussels.\n\nIn a letter to EU member states viewed by CNN on Wednesday, Michel invited representatives to a “special European Council on Thursday 24 February.” The summit is set to be an in-person meeting and is expected to begin at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET).\n\nMichel condemned the “aggressive actions” taken by Russia, which he stressed violate international law, the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and “undermine the European security order.”\n\n“It is important that we continue to be united and determined and jointly define our collective approach and actions,” Michel said.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the European Council announced that it had “adopted a package of measures” responding to Russia’s decision to recognize separatist-held parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nParis will light up city hall in blue and yellow in support of Ukraine\n\nParis’ city hall will display the colors of the Ukrainian flag on Wednesday night to show solidarity with the country, the mayor’s office said in a statement.\n\n“The city of Paris wishes to show its support for the Ukrainian people and democracy by illuminating the city hall with the colors of Ukraine tonight,” the statement read.\n\nThe display will happen at 6:45 p.m. local time (12:45 p.m. ET), it said, adding that the German capital of Berlin will also light up the Brandenburg Gate at the same time.\n\n“[This action] marks the necessary solidarity and unity that Europe must show in this conflict, while war threatens our continent,” according to the statement.\n\nUkraine's parliament says it is \"dealing with a cyberattack\" on its website\n\nUkraine’s parliament is currently “dealing with a cyberattack” on its website, a member of its parliamentary press team confirmed to CNN Wednesday.\n\nUkraine’s Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov also said in his Telegram channel Wednesday that another mass distributed denial of service attack began at about 4 p.m. local time.\n\nAccording to Fedorov, the DDoS attack was reported by a number of banks, and there have been problems with access to government websites. This is due to the switching of traffic to another provider to minimize the damage from the attack.\n\nInternet monitor NetBlocks tweeted that Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Security Service and Cabinet office websites have been “impacted by network disruptions.”\n\n“The incident appears consistent with recent DDoS attacks,” NetBlocks added.\n\nMore background: On Feb. 16, a high-volume cyberattack that temporarily blocked access to the websites of Ukrainian defense agencies and banks was “the largest [such attack] in the history of Ukraine,” according to a government minister.\n\nHere's a look at the area in eastern Ukraine where the Latvian PM says Russia is moving troops\n\nRussian troops have moved into the eastern region of Ukraine that Russia has now recognized as “independent,” according to the Prime Minister of NATO member Latvia and sources familiar with the latest US intelligence assessments.\n\nRead more about why the Donbas region is at the heart of the crisis.\n\nTake a look at this map of the area:\n\nRussian troops moving some forces and tanks into eastern Ukraine, Latvian prime minister says\n\nRussian troops have moved into the eastern region of Ukraine that Russia has now recognized as “independent,” according the prime minister of NATO member Latvia and sources familiar with US intelligence.\n\nPressed specifically on whether he was referring to the entry of additional Russian troops since Moscow recognized the two separatist regions earlier this week, Kariņš replied: “Yes, according to the information at my disposal, this is exactly what we’re seeing.”\n\nTwo other sources familiar with US intelligence confirmed to CNN that additional Russian troops have in fact crossed the border into the Donbas region since Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the two regions and issued an order deploying “peacekeepers” into the Donbas on Tuesday.\n\nRussia has deployed one to two so-called battalion tactical groups, Russia’s main combat formation, each of which comprise an average of about 800 troops, according to a senior US official familiar with the latest intelligence.\n\nCNN has not independently verified the presence of additional Russian troops in the Donbas.\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Tuesday described events now underway in Ukraine as “the beginning of a Russian invasion,” but senior administration officials have since declined to confirm whether additional Russian troops had entered into the Donbas — where unmarked Russian forces have propping up separatist fighters since 2014.\n\nPutin expresses \"disappointment\" with US and NATO reaction during phone call with Turkish president\n\nOn a phone call with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his “disappointment” in the reaction by the United States and NATO.\n\nErdogan reiterated Turkey’s stance on rejecting the steps taken by Putin against Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Turkish presidency said.\n\nPutin discussed “the theme of the development of long-term legal security guarantees for the Russian Federation” and “emphasized the objective necessity of the decision taken in the face of the aggression of the Ukrainian authorities in Donbas and their categorical refusal to comply with the Minsk agreements,” according to the Russian Presidency readout of the phone call.\n\nThe Turkish presidential statement said that Erdogan told Putin that “a military conflict will not benefit anyone” and that it will only make things more complex, adding that ”it is important to reach a conclusion on the basis of the Minsk Agreements.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Erdogan denounced Putin’s decision to recognize breakaway eastern Ukrainian territories, calling it “unacceptable.”\n\nThe White House is expected to allow toughest sanctions on controversial Russian gas pipeline\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will allow sanctions to move forward on the company in charge of building Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, after blocking such sanctions last year using a national security waiver.\n\nThe move, described by three US officials, is part of a series of penalties the US and its allies have imposed on Russia this week in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recognition of separatist territories in eastern Ukraine as independent.\n\nThe move marks a significant shift in the administration’s policy toward Nord Stream 2, which had previously been to sanction some of the smaller entities involved in the project— including some Russian companies and ships that have been helping in the construction—but to hold off on sanctioning Nord Stream 2 AG and its CEO, Matthias Warnig.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and the State Department’s top energy official Amos Hochstein, who has been in charge of the diplomacy surrounding Nord Stream, had long been opposed to the project. But the concern was that imposing the harshest penalties on it would crater the US’ relationship with Germany, which insisted the pipeline was just a commercial project.\n\nBut now that Germany — after intensive diplomacy with the US — has agreed to halt the pipeline’s certification indefinitely, the US feels freer to allow the congressionally-mandated sanctions to move forward. Essentially, the administration wanted Germany to decide on its own to halt the pipeline before moving forward with more punishing sanctions on the project, the official explained.\n\nThe move is likely to be met with bipartisan support — Democratic and Republican lawmakers have long seen the pipeline as a potential threat to Europe because Russia has used its control over energy supplies to pressure countries in Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, by shutting off those supplies, even in winter months.\n\nConcern in Congress about the pipeline has been acute enough that lawmakers passed legislation with significant bipartisan majorities in 2019, then expanded it in 2020, requiring sanctions against Nord Stream 2.\n\nThe administration, last year, waived the toughest sanctions, on Nord Stream 2 AG and its CEO, on national security grounds, prompting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz to hold up dozens of Biden’s nominees to top national security and ambassador posts.\n\nCNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.\n\nRead more about Nord Stream 2 and why it matters.\n\nFrench foreign minister warns about more European sanctions on Russia\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian warned of additional European sanctions on Russia, but noted that the European Union is still hopeful there can be further dialogue toward a “peaceful ending” to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.\n\n“The first packet of sanction are serious; they will hurt,” Le Drian said. “There will be other packets.”\n\nThe foreign minister’s remarks echo that of France’s Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who warned Wednesday that European leaders have “infinitely more penalizing” sanctions at their disposal to impose on Russia in an interview with CNN affiliate BFMTV.\n\nThe European Union on Tuesday said it would sanction all 351 lawmakers of the Russian lower house, the Duma, who voted in favor of recognizing the independence of the separatist-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic.\n\nAddressing reporters in Berlin on Wednesday, Le Drian warned that “anything is possible, even the worst,” but stressed that there is still time for negotiations.\n\nSpeaking alongside Le Drian, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said European leaders and partners “want to avert war” but will take a hardline approach to Russia if needed.\n\n“We do not want a war in Europe, and it is on Russia to take back these steps,” Baerbock said.\n\n“We kept making clear that we will take all hard measures if necessary,” she added.\n\nEU plans to sanction Russian defense minister and Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency, diplomat says\n\nThe European Union is planning on sanctioning the Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency (IRA), according to a senior EU diplomat.\n\nThe diplomat told CNN Wednesday that the sanctioning of the defense minister and agency should “be a done deal.”\n\nAll that remains is for the sanctions to be formalized “through written procedure,” and then they should be published and enter into force later on Wednesday, the diplomat said, though nothing will be official until formally announced.\n\nThe diplomat hailed it as “an impressive feat” to have coordinated these sanctions between the 27 member states in “such a short timeframe.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the bloc’s plan to sanction Shoigu and the agency.\n\nSome background: In 2019, then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his Russian investigation report outlined how the IRA engaged in a years-long campaign to sow discord in the US, and eventually to support the election of Donald Trump, by creating and maintaining fake social media personas and activist organizations designed to look like they were run by real Americans. The troll group also successfully used fake accounts on Twitter to provoke reactions from high-profile American users from across the political spectrum.\n\nIn 2020, former President Donald Trump confirmed the US conducted a covert cyberattack in 2018 against the IRA.\n\nA CNN investigation in 2020 discovered that at least part of the IRA’s campaign was outsourced to trolls in Ghana and Nigeria. They focused almost exclusively on racial issues in the US, promoting Black empowerment and often displaying anger toward white Americans. The goal, according to experts who follow Russian disinformation campaigns, was to inflame divisions among Americans and provoke social unrest.\n\nOn the ground: An artillery shell destroyed the home of a 9-year-old in Ukraine\n\nWhen you walk into 9-year-old Veronica’s bedroom in Novoluhans’ke, Ukraine, you’ll see all her stuffed toys — teddy bears, a tiger and others. A warm sight if it wasn’t for the shattered window of her bedroom in a house that was destroyed by an artillery shell.\n\nShelling of Ukrainian territory from areas controlled by separatists has risen dramatically in the past day, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said last week.\n\n“Luckily, she was in the kitchen, lying on the floor, when these shells landed. But it could have been so much worse — truly almost a miraculous survival,” CNN reported Sam Kiley said as he surveyed the house.\n\nWatch the full report here:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nf49abfec-5676-4f3e-8e49-34a1b786af25.mp4\n\n06:26 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden's latest Russia sanctions target the families of Putin's inner circle. Here's who is impacted.\n\nThe new US sanctions triggered by Russian’s latest actions in Ukraine included targets that in the past have gone untouched: the family members of those in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.\n\nBy designating the sons of two powerful players close to the Russian President, the Biden administration sent a clear signal that its target list for individual sanctions extends beyond public officials and financiers as part of a new effort to shut down pathways for top Putin associates to shield their wealth by giving it to family members.\n\nDenis Bortnikov and Vladimir Kiriyenko, both designated for individual sanctions by the Treasury Department on Tuesday, hold their own prominent positions in Russian business. But both will now have any US-held assets frozen and be barred from dealing with any US persons solely because their fathers serve as Putin’s domestic intelligence chief and as one of Putin’s closest advisers, respectively.\n\nSanctioning the sons of two of Putin’s closest officials doesn’t carry the impact of other measures announced on Tuesday, most notably imposing sanctions on two of Russia’s most prominent banks and reducing the country’s ability to access Western finance.\n\nBut they are meant to unsettle a very personal element of the Russian economy, one driven by the reality that Putin’s inner circle and the family members tied to them represent an extraordinary consolidation of wealth and power inside the country.\n\nIt is clear, officials say, that the opening salvo of that approach is unlikely to be the last.\n\nThe sanctions are aimed at “powerful Russians in Putin’s inner circle believed to be participating in the Russian regime’s kleptocracy and their family members,” according to the Treasury Department.\n\nDenis Bortnikov is the son of Aleksandr Bortnikov, the powerful head of the Federal Security Service, Russia’s domestic intelligence service known as the FSB. The elder Bortnikov, already subject to sanctions in March of last year, was re-designated for sanctions in the new round.\n\nVladimir Kiriyenko is the son of Sergei Kiriyenko, the former prime minister and current first deputy chief of staff of the presidential office who is viewed by US officials as “Putin’s domestic policy curator.” The elder Kiriyenko, also sanctioned in 2021, was also re-designated for sanctions on Tuesday.\n\nThe re-designations were necessary to create the legal pathway to target their sons for designation, which freezes all property and interests in property in the US, or in possession or control of a US citizen.\n\nThe two sons currently hold prominent roles of their own — Bortnikov as deputy president of VTB Bank, one of Russia’s largest financial institutions, and Kiriyenko as the recently installed CEO of VK Group, which serves as the parent company of the Russian social media company VK, which calls itself “the largest European social network.”\n\nA third sanctioned individual, Petr Fradkov, serves as the CEO of Promsvyazbank, the military bank also targeted for sanctions on Tuesday. But he, too, carries a key familial tie to the upper echelons of Putin’s orbit.\n\nFradkov is the son of Mikhail Fradkov, an ex-prime minister of Russia and the former chief of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR. The elder Fradkov was targeted for sanctions by the US in 2018.\n\nRead more about the sanctions here.\n\nWhite House says additional sanctions on Russia, including export controls, could come \"at any moment\"\n\nThe White House said Wednesday to expect additional sanctions on Russia, suggesting that even if Russia were to take no further action in Ukraine, the US and allies will continue to impose costs on the country.\n\nDeputy national security adviser Daleep Singh did not specify timing during an appearance on CNN’s “New Day,” but he pointed to the types of sanctions the US might pursue, including export controls “at any moment.”\n\nAsked by CNN’s John Berman whether there would be no further sanctions if Russia did not take further steps in Ukraine, Singh said, “No.”\n\nHe described Tuesday’s sanctions as a “demonstration effect” that will “go higher and higher.”\n\nSingh also reacted to a call from Ukraine’s foreign minister to hit Russia with more sanctions now.\n\n“Sometimes I wonder if there’s almost a bloodlust out there for sanctions as an end to themselves. But let me just be really clear. We did hit hard yesterday,” he said, pointing to Tuesday’s package of sanctions on banks, debt, and oligarchs, as well as Germany’s announcement it would halt the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.\n\nPressed by Berman on who that bloodlust was from, he aimed his attack at the media, and not the Ukrainian foreign minister.\n\n“I hear it from many in the media, why didn’t you impose all of your sanctions on day one?” he said.\n\nAsked again whether he was targeting the Ukrainian official with that phrasing, he said, “No, no I’m not saying that. I’m saying I hear from questions out there and commentary.”\n\nAsked if there had been a change to the current military situation, Singh maintained status quo, saying Russia is still “poised and positioned to launch a major invasion, a large scale invasion across much of the territory of Ukraine, from the north, from the east, and from the south, that has not changed.”\n\nRussian foreign ministry warns of a \"finely tuned and painful\" response to US sanctions\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday warned of a “finely tuned and painful” response to the United States after the Biden administration imposed fresh sanctions on Moscow.\n\nThe statement alleged that the sanctions are part of Washington’s “ongoing attempts to change Russia’s course,” and added that the pressure will not prove to be a deterrence.\n\nThe ministry also reiterated that it’s open for diplomacy but warned that the US will receive a response from Russia.\n\n“We are open to diplomacy based on the principles of mutual respect, equality and consideration of each other’s interests,” the statement read. “There should be no doubt that sanctions will receive a strong response, not necessarily symmetrical, but finely tuned and painful to the American side.”"
