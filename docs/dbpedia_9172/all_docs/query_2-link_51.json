        "text": "Odesa is going back to its rebellious ways. Odesa is becoming ruthless once again. The sirens disturb the sleep of Odesa residents who are reluctant to go down to the shelters and have stopped paying attention to the fire of anti-aircraft guns aimed at the Russian intruders. In the city, the Jewish intellectual with a wry sense of humor no longer occupies center stage. Today, Odesa has other heroes: heroes hidden behind bulletproof vests, automatic rifles slung over their shoulders, masked faces and suspicion in their eyes. They are patriots, wearing the yellow and blue colors of the national flag.\n\nAll the ethnic groups and nations that have formed the port city over the centuries are united by and against Mr. Putin, their number one enemy. They all feel as one, outraged by the aggression of the Moscow tyrant. This includes the veterans of the Red Army soaking up their retirement in the sun and their female alter egos, those feisty grandmothers nostalgic for the Soviet system. Even the former kolorady (referencing the orange and black stripes of the Colorado potato beetle), fiercely pro-Russian during the Ukrainian Maidan revolution in 2014, no longer wear the famous striped ribbons that symbolized their opposition to this pro-European movement.\n\nRejecting Moscow's authoritarianism\n\nThe wounds caused by the famous clashes on May 2, 2014 have healed. On that day, Odesa was torn apart by a tragedy in two parts. In the morning, a street fight between pro-Russian militants with guns and a crowd of pro-Maidan activists left two of the latter dead. Furious that the murderers were protected by the Odesa police, whose leadership was then infiltrated by pro-Russian activists, the supporters of the revolution chased down their enemies through the city. The second part ended with the death of 42 pro-Russian activists in a fire at the House of Trade Unions, the origin of which remains controversial. The event was used by Moscow to justify the invasion of Donbas that same year and to divide the people of Odesa.\n\nEight years later, Mr. Putin promised that \"justice would be done\" in Odesa. But the ranks of the pro-Russians have diminished since then. No one here is waiting for the Russian army, which claims to be \"liberating\" the country with bread and salt, in the Slavic tradition of welcome. This rejection of Moscow's authoritarianism makes Odesa a stronghold which, like Kharkiv and Mariupol, is in danger of being targeted and destroyed. Even though Russia is now concentrating its assault on eastern Ukraine, the fear that the Russian army will attack the city remains."
