        "text": "Archaeological findings confirm that the area of today's Odesa has been inhabited since antiquity, and the inhabitants of this territory were strongly associated with the Mediterranean. In the Middle Ages, this area changed hands, being under the rule of the Pechenegs, Polovtsians, the Golden Horde, the Crimean Khanate, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Golden Horde. The first written mention of a settlement on the territory of today's Odesa dates back to 1415 and refers to the Tatar port settlement called Kaczubeiow, which was later renamed to Hajiba.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Jassy (1791), ending the Sixth Russian-Turkish War, Odesa came under Russian rule. In 1795, according to the decree of Empress Catherine II, the port of Hajiba was founded, the Odessa war and trade port. During the construction of the city, emigrants from the revolutionary France (today the patrons of the main downtown streets) played a key role, primarily Prince Armand-Emanuel Richelieu de La Porte, General Louis Alexandre Andranault Langeron and Joseph Deribas.\n\nThe 19th century was a period of intensive development for Odessa as a result of grain export. The city received city rights in 1803, then the number of inhabitants increased from 9,000. up to 500 thousand in 1904, settlers who came from all over the Russian Empire, the Balkans and Greece to the city created an incredible cultural melting pot here. In 1865, the railway reached Odessa - first the line was led to Balta, and in 1870 - to Kiev. Before the revolution, about 500 companies operated here. The Bolshevik rise to power caused a crisis and mass emigration of the city's inhabitants.\n\nFrom August to October 1941 there was a fierce defense of the Odessa naval base against German and Romanian forces advancing from the land. In the years of the World War II, until the liberation of the city by the Red Army in April 1944, Odessa was occupied by Romanians. After rebuilding the war damage, the city began to develop rapidly. The second half of the 20th century brought significant changes in the ethnic structure of the city's population: Jews emigrated from Odessa. Many of them later settled in New York near Brighton Beach, creating there the so-called \"Little Odessa\".\n\nContemporary Odessa is very popular among tourists. Guests from all over the world are attracted by: warm climate, beautiful sandy beaches and a unique multicultural atmosphere. Thanks to the film \"Battleship Potemkin\", the city is associated with the Potemkin Stairs (this is a vast staircase that creates the illusion, so that only a few large stairs are visible at the top, and at the bottom all the stairs seem to combine into one pyramidal mass), connecting the port with the city.\n\nIn 1810 the first opera house was opened (destroyed by fire in 1873). The modern building was built by Fellner and Helmer in a neo-baroque style. The luxurious hall was built in the Rococo style. It is said that thanks to the unique acoustics, even a whisper from the stage can be heard in every part of the room. Many buildings in Odessa have the style of nineteenth-century classical architecture. This is particularly evident in buildings designed by architects such as Italy Francesco Boffo, who at the beginning of the 19th century built a palace and a column for the governor of Odesa and many other public buildings. Many beautiful and impressive buildings are located on the Seaside Boulevard.\n\nOdesa boasts many monuments, including exposed fragments of the remains of a Greek settlement from VI-V in B.C.E., the Vorontsov palace, Belina-Brzozowski palace, the seat of the City Council, monuments to Prince Richelieu and Pushkin, gathered around the UNESCO-listed Seaside Boulevard. Museum lovers will certainly not be disappointed in Odessa's offer: around 20 institutions of this type operate here, including Fleet Museum, Archaeological Museum, Museum of East and West Art.\n\nThe city offers a wide range of cultural events, including the Humorina Festival of humor and satire attracting hundreds of tourists every year and City Days. In Odessa there are many parks and public gardens, among which there are Preobrazhensky, Gorky and Victory parks. The city also has a university botanical garden, which recently celebrated its 200th anniversary.\n\nOdessa is also famous for the Soviet violin school, founded by Piotr Stoljarski. Musicians such as Nathan Milstein, David Oistrakh, Igor Oistrakh, Boris Goldstein, Zakhar Bron, and Sviatoslav Richter created his works here (he was only a student at the Odessa school), Benno Moiseiwitsch, Vladimir de Pachmann, Shura Cherkassky, Emil Gilels, Maria Grinberg, Simon Barere, Leo Podolsky and Jakow Zak.\n\nThe International Film Festival in Odessa is held annually from 2010 to the present day.\n\nOdesa is the seat of several universities (17), the oldest of them was founded in 1865. The most famous and most prestigious university is Odesa II Mechnikov National University. In addition to the National University, the city is the seat of, among others: the National University of Economics, the Odessa Law Academy, the National Telecommunications Academy and the Odessa Maritime University. The last of these institutions is a highly specialized and prestigious university training commercial seafarers, annually about 1,000 newly qualified officers.\n\nIn addition to all the universities and state-owned academies mentioned above, Odessa is also home to a large number of private educational institutes that offer high-quality courses in various fields. These universities usually charge much higher fees than state educational institutions.\n\nThey following universities are located here, among others: Medical Academy, Academy of Construction and Architecture, Food Academy, Music Academy, Technical University, National Refrigeration Academy. In Odessa, there is also the oldest research institute of Ukraine.\n\nFrom 31 August to 3 September 2019, the annual feast of our partner city of Odessa was held (the 225th birthday of the City).\n\nThe programme included, among others, the opening ceremony of the City for residents and tourists and a gala at which representatives of business and culture distinguished for the City of Odessa were awarded. In addition, representatives of Odessa's partner cities were officially welcomed, including Lodz, Regensburg (Germany), Haifa (Israel), Ningbo (People's Republic of China), Lefkada (Greece). The Odessa City Day celebrations were crowned with an open-air concert of Ukrainian artists.\n\nAs part of this visit, a bench with a monument to the penguin Pik Pok, the protagonist of the fairy tale from the Se-Ma-For studio in ÅódÅº, was unveiled in the Victory Park. Penguin gained great sympathy among the small inhabitants of Odessa. The children eagerly photographed with him and ensured that they would look after a new friend from ÅódÅº.\n\nThis visit was very warmly received by the inhabitants of Odessa. Very positive articles about ÅódÅº appeared in Odessa media, incl. ÐºyÐ»ÑÑypomeÑp (Culturemeter), ÐÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð½ÑÐºÐ°Ñ (Pushkinskaya), or YÐ½iaÐ½ (Unian).\n\nhttps://culturemeter.od.ua/v-odesskom-parke-pobedy-poselilsja-polskij-pingvinenok-pik-pok-75845/\n\nhttps://pushkinska.net/news/v-odesse-otkryili-skulpturu-multyashnogo-pingvinenka-iz-polshi-foto\n\nhttps://www.unian.net/society/10669692-lodz-podaril-odesse-na-den-goroda-statuyu-pingvinenku-geroyu-polskogo-multfilma-foto.html\n\nIn the last week of April, we hosted a delegation from Odesa in ÅódÅº. Both cities are connected by extensive cultural and economic cooperation. Partners from Ukraine willingly use our experience in the field of administration management and implementation of social projects. The purpose of the visit was to familiarize the visitors with the implementation of projects supporting the elderly and disabled people and the use of EU funds for the development of municipal and health infrastructure.\n\nThe delegation from Odessa consisted of the representatives of the Health Department, the Department of Municipal Management and the Municipal Health Center in Odessa.\n\nDuring their stay in ÅódÅº, guests visited the facilities and met with officials. On 24 April, delegates from Ukraine visited the Day Care Center operating at the hospital Jordan on Przyrodnicza St. Mrs. Jolanta BiliÅska, representative for development and social communication at the dr. K. Jonscher Municipal Medical Center, presented the main aims for the functioning of the center for the elderly and disabled.

The city faced a huge challenge and we want to share it with ÅódÅº as well. We need support in gaining experience in crisis management methods and city security in similar situations that took place in Odesa.

The inhabitants of Odesa want to learn not only how to cooperate in emergency medical services, but also broadly understood civil protection. Tragic events of 2nd May 2014, when two opposing political groups clashed in the city center, resulting in 43 deaths. These experiences forced the City and Voivodship Authorities to analyze and take action in the field of health care reform. Because at the time of crisis it turned out that the city was completely unprepared for such events. There was no coordination of rescue and medical services, hospitals were overcrowded, chaos reigned, there was no possibility of segregating the wounded, and these were victims with post-burn and gunshot wounds. Ukraine is currently on the threshold of many state reforms. This is a very important time in the history of Ukraine, therefore ÅódÅº as a partner city supports Odesa and shares its knowledge and experience.\n\nDuring 3-day meeting, our city hosted 400 participants from Ukraine, EU, Russia, neighboring countries and the USA, including representatives of governments, politics, business, local governments, international organizations and analytical centers.
