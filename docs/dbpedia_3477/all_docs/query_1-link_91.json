        "text": "The Highway man traveled his last road. Richard William, Sr., aged 93, passed away from stomach cancer on December 21, 2023.\n\nReunited with his beloved Norma, wife of 69 years. He was one of the Greatest Generation. None like them!\n\nBorn in Denton, MT to Lottie (Williams) and Walter Saltzman on October 18, 1930. He was the 9th of 10 children. His early years were spent milking cows, farming and ranching. Then on to the smelter in Great Falls as a straw boss prior to enlisting in the Navy at age 16 to send money home to his parents.\n\nWhile enlisted he married Norma. His service time was extended due to the Korean War. His vessel, the USS Achernar was instrumental at Inchon, Korea, 15 September 1950. For their service, the shipmates received multiple commendatory dispatches. The one from General McArthur read, \"The Navy and Marines have never shone more brightly than this morning.\"\n\nUpon discharge he, Norma and their three small children returned to Montana where he began his love of road construction and numbers. Having less than an eighth grade education he became a self-taught engineer. Studying and mailing in testing to earn his engineering certification to advance his employment status - all while working and feeding a family of now seven on very meager wages.\n\nHe and Norma worked side by side to ensure they taught us the value of hard work, faithfulness, sacrifices and love. Sometimes tough love, but love none the less. His philosophy was if you take care of the pennies, the nickels and dimes will do the same.\n\nHe retired from the State of Montana Highway Department after 30 years. He joined the private construction sector, which took him to Washington, Hawaii, Utah and Nevada. Mom always by his side.\n\nHe always loved a body of water, so fishing was a natural hobby. Hunting was more of a way to feed a family of seven.\n\nHe was a lifelong member of the Eagles (76 years), the Elks, and the American Legion. He served on the Honor Guard at many a veteran's final services. Bellied up to the bar, with a Jack on the rocks, he had a thunderous laugh and loved a good joke or story.\n\nPreceded in death by his wife, Norma; sons, Jimmy and Richard, Jr.; grandsons, Corey, Chad and Zachary; granddaughter, Tammy Jo; son-in-law, Larry; daughter-in-law, Jenny; brothers, Walter, Alford, Dale and Eldon and sisters, Viola, Flo, Irene and Annice.\n\nSurvived by his daughters, Janie (Kenneth), Kaye (Mike); son, Lynn (Mary); 22 grandchildren; 43 great-grandchildren; 16 great great-grandchildren and sister, Beth.\n\nPer dad's words, \"you know what a guy should do\" yep, Rest in Peace. We love you. Per his wishes, no service will be held. A private graveside will be held at a later date."
