        "text": "Submitter:\n\nMike McCormick SURATT's of Vigo Co., IN.\n\nDated: Jun 20, 2001\n\n(SFA) Guestbook\n\nI am the Vigo County, Indiana, Historian and, for several years, have pursued biographical information about Valeska Suratt, the vaudeville star and silent screen vamp, and her family.\n\nShe lived in Owensville (Gibson County, Indiana), Terre Haute (Vigo County, Indiana), briefly in Indianapolis (Marion County, Indiana), Chicago (Cook County, Illinois) and, then New York City.\n\nShe died in Washington, D.C. in a retirement home. Her father was Ralph M. Suratt; her mother was Anna, her two brothers were Austin and Richard (who also was known as \"Judge,\" and so named in the 1900 Census); one sister, Leah (shown as \"Leal\" in your index); and a step-sister, Myrtle Strickland.\n\nValeska was born in Owensville (Gibson County, Indiana) in about 1882. He family moved to Terre Haute in 1887. I was fortunate enough to get acquainted with her housekeeper several years ago. The housekeeper died at 102 a few weeks ago.\n\nValeska had two marriages. The first was to vaudeville comic Billy Gould; the second was to actor Fletcher Norton. Anna died in 1914 in Terre Haute. Austin was killed a year or so later but I am not sure where. \"Judge\" lived in Pacific Northwest and eventually became a recognized producer of documentary films in Alaska. He died \"under suspicious circumatances\" in 1959. Valeska died in 1962 and her ashes are here at Highland Lawn Cemetery next to her mother Anna and sister Leah. I wish others would produce a census index like yours. Thank you. Mike McCormick ([email protected])\n\nMike,\n\nThanks for the E-Mail and kind words.\n\nI would like to exchange info on this family, as you can see I have some different information, than you, See more information on this branch in Vigo Co., IN. Ralph M. SURRATT, (SFA) Family Profile. ..prs (SFA) Submitter:\n\nMike McCormick SURATT's of Vigo Co., IN.\n\nDated: Jun 25, 2001\n\nPaul:\n\nThank you very much for your email. I note that I made a typo in my earlier message. My information -- though not documented -- is that Ralph \"Judge\" Suratt was killed in 1950 in Alaska, not 1959. Elizabeth Lauer said that she though he was living in the Pacific Northwest in 1913-1915.\n\n[Comment: by prs] Richard (Not Ralph) \"Judge\" SURATT, d. 22 Jul 1950, a59y \"Under mysterious circumstane\n\nYour information about Austin may prove very helpful. When Anna Suratt died in 1914, the funeral was postponed for a day or two because \"Valeska's brother\" could not be contacted. Later, In two interviews, Valeska asserted that she was very upset when her \"brother\" did not come back for their mother's funeral. In another story, it was said that her \"favorite brother\" was killed a year or two after her mother died. Thus, I incorrectly presumed that Austin survived his mother. However, I had not been able to find his obituary. Now I can focus on an earlier date.\n\n[Comment: by prs] Brother Austin SURATT, was killed in Gibson Co., IN. on 19 Oct 1902, this is some 12 years before his Mother died in 1914, the only other brother R. Judge has to be the brother that was late for the funeral.\n\nI can help you rergarding Leah SURRATT. She married John Jahries of Terre Haute in Vigo County, Indiana, on Jan. 14, 1904. Mr. Jahries ended up in Los Angeles, California, as a scenic designer or similar trade. As I recall, he died in 1953. I don't think the Jahries moved to California for several years because Mrs. Leah (Surratt) JAHRIES managed Valeska's \"hat boutique\" in the Hotel Deming here in Terre Haute, about 1914-1915 timeframe. As I recall, Mrs. Leah (Surratt) Jahries married a man named Hinchliffe. It is unclear to me whether Leah and Jahries were divorced or that she married Hinchliffe after Jahries died. I think I have more information the second husband somewhere. If I find it I will furnish it to you. Leah survived until 1980 and is buried at Highland Lawn Cemetery with her mother and Valeska's ashes.\n\nRegards, Mike McCormick ([email protected])\n\nThanks, Mike I have made corrections/additions at: Ralph M. SURRATT, (SFA) Family Profile. ..prs (SFA) Submitter:\n\nMike McCormick SURATT's of Vigo Co., IN.\n\nDated: Jun 26, 2001\n\n(corrected e-mail)\n\nFile: Suratt1905-b.zip (100221 bytes)\n\nPaul:\n\nAgain I gave you a wrong date. The Terre Haute newspaper story attached was dated Feb. 1905. I also have made a few other minor changes in the text for clarification.\n\nI just looked at the information on you website about Valeska. I had not journeyed that far until you gave me a clue in your message. I find that much of the information you cited was taken from several sources who were quoting statements I made in a series of stories I wrote about Valeska about six years ago. The information I had back then was, in some slight respects, erroneous. A couple of the website sources have contacted me since those stories were published and I have furnished some updated information.\n\nAt least one of the website moderators got \"correct infornation from me\" but relied in incorrect information on Imdb. I have since corrected the Imdb information but the web moderator has not changed the information on his website!\n\nI feel comfortable that, despite assertions otherwise, Valeska was born in Owensville (Gibson County). The question is the precise date. I do not have the material in front of me so please excuse me if I correct something later. According to a person who interviewed Leah in 1961 by telephone (she was still living in California), the Suratts moved to Terre Haute when Valeska was four years old. It also said she died at age 78. That would mean she moved to TH in 1888 or 1889. That corresponds with the Terre Haute city directories, as I recall, which first list Suratt's Blacksmith Shop in Terre Haute in 1889. However, there is a possibility that the interviewer misinterpreted Leah. Leah could have been referring to her own age, not Valeska's.\n\nI have purchased several New York Dramatic Mirrors, Motion Picture World, Photoplay, other magazines and the New York Times in an effort to clarify some of these issues and have spent time going through Variety, Cosmopolitan, etc. I have learned much but not all my crucial questions have been resolved. I may be one of the largest collectors of Valeska Suratt memorbilia!\n\nLeah told the 1961 interviewer that Valeska left TH with $1000 borrowed from Leah who had had won a Honduras lottery, went to New York and London and was discovered by Edward Edelston. That may be true but I have since discovered that she also took acting and dancing lessons in Chicago in 1904 or before, met and married Billy Gould (though I have no marriage date or place) and in 1905 departed with him on a vaudeville tour of South Africa, using the name Valeska (Suratt) Gould. (See attached Scan from newspaper story dated Feb. 14, 1905). Leah said Valeska worked at the Albert LeClear Photograph Studios in Terre Haute. Valeska is quoted in Photoplay that her \"first job\" was at W.H. Block's Department Store in Indianapolis. Of course, in the same story she refers to herself as a \"Terre Haute native.\"\n\nLet me repeat. Thanks for the website. I am going back to study it once more.\n\nRegards, Mike McCormick ([email protected])\n\nThanks, Mike I have made corrections/additions at: Ralph M. SURRATT, (SFA) Family Profile. Submitter:\n\nMike McCormick SURATT's of Vigo Co., IN.\n\nDated: Jun 27, 2001\n\nPaul:\n\nUnfortunately I have not had the time to review my notes or pursue any research on the Surratt/Suratt family since my last communication. The issue regarding father Ralph remains an enigma and I did pursue that some years ago but I will have to refresh myself.\n\nThe absence of Valeska from the 1900 census suggests to me:\n\n1. She probably was born in 1882; and/or\n\n2. She already had departed town. She might have been in Indianapolis or Chicago, two towns she lived in before 1905. It is reported that she also worked for a milliner shop here and at the photographic studio. The latter source in Leah. The hat shop at the Hotel Deming, which Leah managed, is from Elizabeth Lauer. Leah said Valeska dropped out of school when she was young and I suspect that means before age 14 or 15.\n\nPlease keep in mind that these are only suggestions -- not what a genealogist needs. However, they are issues I am still want to pursue and share with someone like you.\n\nThe first Terre Haute house the family lived in, I think, was a 323 North 17th. The second one was one on Chestnut St. And the third Valeska helped the family acquire was at 1634 North 9th. That is where the family was living when Anna died. I do not recall whether I checked the chain of title on the Chestnut St. home.\n\nPlease be patient as I have got myself committed to about 20 hours a day. However, I definitely want to resolve the issues you raise.\n\nStay in touch, Mike McCormick\n\nThanks Mike,\n\nI still have the following Questions.\n\n1. What happen to Ralph M. SURATT, he was age 47y living alone in the 1900 Census (do you have access to the 1910 and 1920 Census on this family?\n\n2. Why wasn't Valeska, a18y living with mother in 1900 Census? Did she go to Chicago before 1900?\n\nI have made corrections/additions at: Ralph M. SURRATT, (SFA) Family Profile. Submitter:\n\nMike McCormick SURATT's of Vigo Co., IN.\n\nDated: Jun 28, 2001\n\nPaul:\n\nI could not access your database/website today to see if you already have the information; however, I accidentally came across Leah's application for marriage license among some papers in my office. Her mother's maiden name was \"Anna Mathews.\" By the way, \"Surratt\" was spelled with a double \"r.\" Luther E. Sellers conducted the marriage ceremony. Jahries' first name was listed as \"Jno.\" or Jonathan. He was a \"butcher\" at the time of the wedding. Best regards, Mike McCormick\n\nYes Mike,\n\nAnna (MATTHEWS) was the d/o William & Elizabeth (Malone) MATTHEWS) She married 1st 04 Jul 1870, Gibson co., IN. to James STRICKLAND, had 1 Dau Myrtle J., b. c1872 (Dont know weather the Div or he died) Anna married 2nd on 07 Jun 1878 in Gibson, to Ralph M. SURATT/SURRATT\n\nWas Luther E. Sellers, a J.P. or GM? Where did the marriage take place?\n\nI have made corrections/additions at:\n\nAt URL: Ralph M. SURATT Profile!\n\nAt URL: Valeska SURATT Profile!\n\nSubmitter:\n\nMike McCormick SURATT's of Vigo Co., IN.\n\nDated: Jun 28, 2001\n\nPaul:\n\nI could not access your database/website today to see if you already have the information; however, I accidentally came across Leah's application for marriage license among some papers in my office. Her mother's maiden name was \"Anna Mathews.\" By the way, \"Surratt\" was spelled with a double \"r.\" Luther E. Sellers conducted the marriage ceremony. Jahries' first name was listed as \"Jno.\" or Jonathan. He was a \"butcher\" at the time of the wedding.\n\nThe marriage took place in Vigo County, Indiana (Terre Haute). I identify the Rev. Luther E. Seller as the pastor at the Central Christian Church, 639 Mulberry St. in Terre Haute though I have not checked the 1903-04 city directory. He was later in the decade and I suspect he was pastor there in 1904.\n\nI happen to have the 1907 Terre Haute City Directory at my office. John M. Jahries and Ralph M. Suratt are both listed as living at 625 North 7th Street, Terre Haute. Jahries is listed as being employed as a clerk at Fred Herman's Meat Market, 225 North 5th Street, Terre Haute. Coincidentally, \"Lottie Jahries\" is listed at the bookkeeper at Fred Herman's Meat Market and also \"boards\" at that address. Ralph is listed as a \"blacksmith\" with \"home\" at 625 North Seventh Street but no business address. A decade earlier, his blackmith shop was in the 1300 block on Wabash Avenue.\n\nIn 1907, an \"Anna Surrell\" is listed as \"boarding\" at 665 Sycamore Street. Probably merely a coincidence but, perhaps, worth mentioning.\n\nHere is a link to a 1916 article from Photoplay magazine asserting that Valeska got $5,000 (a week, I believe) from Jerry Lasky for one motion picture, an sizable amount for the time and put her in the top echelon of the early silent film stars. That film had to be \"The Immigrant,\" since it is the only movie she made for Lasky.\n\nYou may already have this item in your files but I think it makes a significant point: Valeska was one of the hottest items in the performing arts.\n\nValeska did not like Hollywood. I am trying to document this but it is my research implies that she left Lasky for Fox because Fox agreed to make her motion pictures on the east coast. In n related matter, John M. Jahries died in Los Angeles on Sept. 21, 1953. Though I am presuming for the time being this is the same man who married Leah, the obit asserts that he leaves a widow, Zita Caughlin also formerly of Terre Haute. Zita Caughlin Jahries died on October 1961 but I have not yet examined her obituary.\n\nThanks Mike,\n\nI have made corrections/additions at:\n\nAt URL: Ralph M.

Jahries. I am mrd. to John Robert \"Bob\" Jahries. We are in the real world now, having gotten a computer for Christmas, which has led me to do some geneology research. It is getting very interesting , now that I have found all of your info and others through google.\n\nWe were both born in NJ and lived in Summit all our lives. In 1951, when Bob retired from NJ Bell, we moved to Martha's Vineyard, where we have visited in summer for nearly 50 years. It is a great place even in the winter.\n\nAnyhow, Bob was b. 08 May 1930 to Margaret Ellis & John Robert Jahries in Summit, NJ. - He has a sister Joan (Hinchliffe) Jahries Maguire b. 4/29/29 . She & husband John R. Maguire have one son. They live in Falls Church, Va.\n\nWe have four \"kids\" , 6 grandchildren. Would like to know more about Bob's father , John R. Sr. All Bob knows is that he left his wife , Margaret in about 1932 and never came back to NJ.\n\nIn the Ellis family history it says \"Margaret & Jack were divorced in 1942.\"\n\nHe does not remember his father at all. When he came back from Korea in 1953 he stopped in Cal. , tried to find his father, but was told he died. So maybe you can fill in the missing links.\n\nI have a very long article about Valeska , possibly from NY Times. Will make copy and send to you if you would like it. Look forward to hearing from you.\n\nThanks! Judy & Bob Jahries, [email protected] Thanks for the E-Mail, Judy\n\nWe are a little bit confused on your JARHRIES connection to the John M. JAHRIES,\n\nd. 21 Sep 1953, Los Angeles, CA. that married 15 Jun 1904, in Terre Haute, Vigo Co., IN. to\n\nMiss Leah SURATT, (2nd d/o Ralph M. & Mrs. Anna (Matthews) STRICKLAND, SURATT)\n\nSee: Leah (SURRATT) JAHRIES, HINCHCLIFFE\n\nWe would like to exchange information on this family!\n\nWe would like to see the article about Valeska Suratt (The Actress)\n\n2nd E-Mail: Date: 07 Feb 2003 at: 11:27:58 AM Pacific Standard Time\n\nHI PAUL- Thanks for the quick reply.

Jack Jahries in NY,N.Y. in July 1926 .\n\nYes, Leah (Surratt) JAHRIES was his grandmother. He does not ever remember meeting her as a child., but she did fly (1st time) to NJ for our wedding Apr. 28, 1962.\n\nShe was a little tiny lady - 4' 10\". I have a picture of her. Also have some very old professional photos of Valeska/Leah?\n\nDo you know when Jack was born & died? and where?\n\nWas John M Leah's Husband before Mr. Hinchcliffe?\n\nWe thought Jack's full name was John Robert!\n\nWe are very interested to hear what you figure out.\n\nWill mail the newspaper clipping tomorrow.

My name is Geoff Williams. I'm a freelance journalist based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I'm working on my first book (or at least my first book pubilshed by a mainstream, large publishing house), and I'm trying to track down information on Valeska Suratt. Your web site and knowledge of Valeska Suratt is extremely impressive, and so I'm hoping you might have ideas as to how I can learn more about her.\n\nBut obviously you're wondering why I'm interested in her, and so I'll cut to the chase. Valeska Suratt will be a minor character, but an interesting one, is a nonfiction book that I'm researching and writing, and which will be published by Rodale (www.rodale.com) and in bookstores across the country in May 2007. The book is THE BUNION DERBY: The Remarkable Story of C.C. Pyle's 1928 International Trans-Continental Foot Race, from Los Angeles to New York.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the race, I can give you more details about it later, but basically, in 1928, sports promoter C.C. Pyle organized a foot race across the country, where 199 men competed for a $25,000 prize. Fifty-five runners actually ended up reaching the finish line, which is remarkable when you consider that sneakers had hardly been invented, and there were no freeways--even paved roads were something of a rarity. It's an incredible story, and throughout the race, C.C. Pyle was constantly being sued (by his bank, people he owed money to, etc).\n\nValeska Suratt was one of those people. In 1928, during the race, she sued him for $2,000.\n\nWhat I don't know is how C.C. Pyle and Valeska Suratt knew each other (Pyle did have a lot of connections to Hollywood, and so it isn't surprising that they knew each other), and I don't know how the lawsuit turned out (so far, I haven't found any newspaper articles about how it turned out, just that she sued him).\n\nA lot of these questions, I'm sure I'll answer as I'm researching the book over the next 15 months or so (the book deal was just made last month), but judging from your web site, I'm assuming you're some distant relative of Valeska, and so I'm thinking you might have clues that you can send my way. Maybe you know of a niece or nephew of Valeska's who I could interview (and relative who knew her would be great to interview), or maybe there are certain things you've been planning on investigating that you don't have time to do, and wouldn't mind sharing the details, and I'll then do some research on my own (and share whatever I learn, of course).\n\nRegardless of what I turn up on her, Valeska Suratt is only a very small part of this story, but having a silent era sex symbol suing Pyle is interesting, and so if I can learn more about their relationship, maybe I'll be able to turn a little tiny detail into a several-page anecdote. And, for what it's worth, any information I find directly from your web site will be obviously credited in the end notes, and if you're able to provide any additional information, certainly I'll mention you in the acknowledgements page.\n\nWell, I guess I've rambled on long enough.

You may not know that she was a Baha'i, but she is mentioned in the autobiography of Mirza Ahmad Sohrab and is the reason why he moved from Los Angeles to New York City.\n\nShe is the person who introduced Sohrab to Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler (a descendent of John Jacob Astor) and his wife Julia Lynch Olin.\n\nAt any rate, that's more than you care to know :) I'm going to begin a page for her at www.wikipedia.org and I will cite your pages as reference material so you'll be famous! Ok not really, but at least more people will be browsing over to see what you have to say. :)\n\nJust thought you might want a little more snippet of data on her. Have a good day!\n\nWill Johnson, Professional Genealogist, a rabid wikipedia editor ;) [email protected] Thanks, for the E-Mail Will,\n\nEven though Valeska, father spelled his name SURRATT, she liked to spell her last name with only one \"R\" SURATT!\n\nThanks for putting our page as a \"hot\" Link on your Valeska wikipedia site!\n\nSee: Valeska SURATT, SFAï¿½ Profile!\n\nWe would like to exchange info. on this Family!..prs\n\n2nd E-Mail: Date: 11 Apr 2006 at: 7:58:28 AM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nIn a message dated 4/11/2006 12:16:06 AM Pacific Standard Time, PRSJR writes:\n\nI will also make a \"Hot Link\" to your site www.wikipedia.org Oh it's not *my* site :)\n\nIt's a community site edited by a few million people, But here is a direct link just to her page\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeska_Surratt\n\nWill Johnson\n\n3rd E-Mail: Date: 11 Apr 2006 at: 9:02:32 AM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nI've just taken more time to read through more of your page. What's odd is that they mention almost nothing of her life between 1918 and when she died !\n\nTo me, that's strange. But then maybe these pages were mostly written by people who wanted to remember her film and stage work.\n\nI'm going to do a bit of work later on today perhaps, to document what she did afterwards. For example, it doesn't mention exactly *why* she sued Cecil DeMille. Sohrab documents exactly why in his book, so I'll try to extract that and post it up on her wiki page.\n\nAre you familiar with how the wikipedia works? Anyone can edit and add whatever they like, just go to her page and click on the edit tab.\n\nWill Johnson, Professional Genealogist (a wikipedia editor, but not the owner, in fact... there is no owner.)"
