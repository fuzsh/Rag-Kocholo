General update 781 More details Maya Reisman 2014 Winter 2022 issue I am currently living in Washington, D.C., where I graduated from American University Washington College of Law. I graduated with honors and received an award for my work in fighting the criminal system. I also had a couple of articles published in The Criminal Law Practitioner and the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law Journal on Social Justice. For those interested, the articles are titled: (1) \"Eternal Punishment: The Cruel and Unusual Practice of Deporting Noncitizen Juvenile Offenders\"; and (2) \"A New Idea for the Education System in Maryland Juvenile Correctional Facilities.\"\n\nIn November, I found out that I passed the bar exam and began working as a trial attorney for the D.C. Public Defender Service (PDS). Working at PDS is not a dream come true, because it is better than any job I ever dreamed of. People living in poverty in the United States are faced with a number of indignities; not the least of which is the lack of control over their fate in the criminal system. In a system designed to further dehumanize and forever penalize poor people, the inability to choose who will defend you is an added affliction. As a public defender, I work to preserve my clients’ dignity and autonomy in a system that seeks to strip them of the few entitlements they have left.\n\nI am committed to fighting the U.S. government every day for the rest of my career. I owe my grit and determination to the education I received at Earlham College. I will never be able to repay the professors and classmates who taught me the importance of being a catalyst for good.
