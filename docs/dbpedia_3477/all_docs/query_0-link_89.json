Helen Eliza Jones (born 6/30/1839 New Hartford, Oneida Co., NY - 9/19/1919 Baraboo, WI) married Andrew Patrick (born 8/11/1836, in Brockville, Leeds Greville, Canada - 11/12/1921 Baraboo, Sauk Co., WI).

Two Squadrons of the Warwickshire Yeomanry volunteered for service in the Boer War and served as Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa with considerable success. The Imperial Yeomanry comprised mainly of one volunteer Squadron from each Yeomanry Regiment and these were grouped into battalions. The Warwickshire Yeomanry Squadron became 5th Company, 2nd Battalion Imperial Yeomanry consisting of five Officers and 116 Ors and sailed for South Africa on the 1st February 1900.

Buried in Glendale Cemetery, Des Moines, Polk Co., IA.\n\nCharles Bartlow, assistant elephant keeper, killed by elephant at Ingersoll Park, Des Moines, IA, winter quarters of Yankee Robinson Circus. Had been with the circus for five years. Coroners inquest into his death determined that his real name was Frank Bartlow. Born 1858 in Oskaloosa. He had an FB tattoo on his left arm and had visited his cousin in Oskaloosa in 1904, on his way to join the Yankee Robinson Circus. She (the cousin) was a witness at the inquest and had pictures that were nearly identical to ones in Frank's possession.\n\nhttp://www.classic.circushistory.org/Bandwagon/bw-1967Sep.htm\n\nDes Moines, Iowa was a location affiliated with showman Fred Buchanan. He and his brother had an outfit out of Granger, IA by 1900-1902, but Fred was also involved with Ingersoll Park, an amusement park in Des Moines, after the turn of the century. For a while they toyed with the title \"Buchanan Bros.\" for their traveling enterprise. A 1905 report had Buchanan operating a zoo in Des Moines, the accumulation of animals a likely prelude to inaugurating the circus. His first authentic circus venture may have been the Yankee Robinson overland show in 1906. It went on rails in 1908 and prospered through 1920. It was acquired by Mugivan & Bowers and refitted as Howes Great London for 1921 at the William P. Hall farm in Lancaster, Missouri. Lancaster was also where the Orton Bros. Circus, a railroad show, was framed for 1916. Is it possible that there's some confusion in recollections or memoirs that has connected these names, titles and locations?\n\nThe 1910 U. S.

Unfortunately he had two problems. He was blind and he had an unnatural fear of water. When the circus train pulled into town it meant the elephants had to walk to the area where the performance would take place. Some times this meant crossing a bridge over a river. Upon arriving at the bridge Tom-Tom would smell the water and refuse to go any farther. Then it was necessary for the elephant handlers to have the other elephants surround Tom-Tom and force him, by the combined weight of their bodies, across the bridge. On June 24, 1911, in Cumberland, WI, the unexpected and totally unexplainable event took place. The elephants were chained to the holding stakes in their tent. Suddenly Tom-Tom tore loose and ran to the nearby river walking into the water and although it was unbelievable, he some how drowned himself.\"\n\nEdwin B. Yeisley\n\nDrowned 6-24-11 when he became mired in a lake while being watered at Cumberland, Wisconsin. Soon after the carcass was removed from the lake, the tusks sawed off and the remains dumped in the fire pit of a nearby Mill Yard.\n\nIn 1918, Mrs. Ella Lea was a Cook, and roomed at the Opera House Hotel, in Livingston, Park Co., MT.\n\nThe WWI Draft Registration Report dated September 18, 1918, Shows Charles Lea, born March 21, 1875, is living in Park Co., MT.

Buried in Walnut Hill Cemetery, Baraboo, Sauk Co., WI.\n\nThe 1920 U. S. Census taken on January 16, 1920, shows Nathan S.
