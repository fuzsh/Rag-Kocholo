        "text": "In 1980, a small group of local Black deaf people in the District of Columbia met with the Board of the Deaf Pride, an advocacy organization for the deaf, and expressed their concerns about the problems that prevent Black deaf from achieving their potential and the lack of leadership in the Black deaf community nationwide. Goals were developed and other skills that were usually ignored. The Black deaf group wanted to have an organization where they could promote leadership as well as share experiences, ideas, talents, and hopes. In July of 1980, the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) held their 100th anniversary convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, where a Black Deaf Caucus was formed. The Black Deaf Caucus members in attendance brought up the issues of the NAD’s refusal to address the concerns of the black deaf community, as well as the lack of representation as delegates of the NAD. Caucus member Sandi LaRue issued a statement to the convention attendees that NAD must take action to communicate better with the black deaf community; encourage minorities’ involvement in the national and state organizations; and recruit more black deaf children in the Junior NAD and youth leadership camp.\n\n“We would like to get on the cover and front pages.” – Sandi LaRue\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer article “Need of Deaf Blacks Recognized”, July 6, 1980 (PDF)\n\nIn August of 1980, Charles “Chuck” V. Williams (of Ohio) had arrived in D.C. preparing to file a class action suit against the National Democratic and Republican Conventions for their refusal to televise a Sign Language interpreter for linguistic accessibility throughout the proceedings. Charles received an invitation to work with a local Black Deaf committee to plan a mini-conference by, for, and about black deaf experience. The first planning meeting in November saw Charles meeting with Lottie Crook (chair), Linwood Smith (vice chair), Zoe E. Page Collymore, Ernest Hairston, Williard Shorter, Shirley Johnson (interpreter coordinator), and Robert Howard (trainer/consultant). Philip Armstrong designed the original logo of black hands in its “ADVOCACY” sign position. The name “advocates” signaled the members’ interest to challenge the disappointing reality for betterment.\n\nFirst Black Deaf Conference, June 25-26, 1981 in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe first Black Deaf Conference “Black Deaf Experience” was held on June 25-26, 1981 at Howard University in Washington, District of Columbia. According to the authors of the “Black and Deaf in America: Are We that Different”, the conference marked an important milestone and provided a model for others to emulate. Nearly 100 Black Deaf people attended the first preliminary conference. Based on the accounts, the mini-conference was a phenomenal success, enough to cement the idea that there should be another conference. The objectives of the conference were:\n\nTo better inform ourselves and the community about being both Black and Deaf in America\n\nTo identify and examine the social, economical, educational, religious, political, and health issues and their impact on the Black deaf community\n\nTo formulate some strategies and problem solving techniques that participants can take back to their communities and use.\n\nThe conference’s workshops held over the two days involved six major areas: Education, Family, Social Services, Health and Mental Health, Employment, and Interpreting.\n\nThe First National Conference was held in Cleveland, Ohio on August 13-15, 1982, in the heart of downtown Stouffers Inn on the Square. The conference theme “Black Deaf Strength Through Awareness” drew 300 participants. Topics were related to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Mental Health, Substance Abuse, Social Services, and Hearing Parents with deaf children. Charles “Chuck” V. Williams served as the conference chairperson (Story). The debate was held as to whether to a national organization should be formed. The motion to declare the First National Conference a National organization passed.\n\nThe new organization National Black Deaf Advocates (NBDA) was officially formed. The six founding members were instrumental in establishing NBDA: Lottie Crook, Ernest Hairston, Williard Shorter, Linwood Smith, Charles “Chuck” V. Williams, and Elizabeth “Ann” Wilson. The national executive secretary Albert Couthen was elected to coordinate the efforts to form a national office.\n\nNew Chapters established: District of Columbia Area Black Deaf Advocates became the first affiliated chapter, Cleveland BDA as #2 Chapter, and Philadelphia Chapter of BDA as #3 Chapter.\n\nThe second National Conference, “Our Place In The Society”, was held in Philadelphia, PA. Conference Chair: Elizabeth Moore-Aviles. The conference marked the first beauty pageant for Black Deaf women. Ronnie Mae Tyson was crowned the first Miss Black Deaf America. Upon the resignation of Albert Couthen, Sheryl Guest-Emery took over as National Executive Secretary – which was later renamed as Executive Director. Under her administration, the National Bylaws were developed with the input of the original 4 NBDA chapters: Washington DC, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and New York City. Various positions for officers were established. Organizational structure, policy, procedures, and guidelines were established under Ms. Emery’s leadership with the assistance and guidance of a veteran lawyer.\n\nExecutive Board 1983-1988 Term:\n\nSheryl Guest-Emery, Executive Director (DC) (1983-1987)\n\nCeleste Owens-Samuels, Assistant Executive Director (1987) (NY); Acting Executive Director (1987-1988)\n\nDr. Seth Ocloo, Treasurer (LA)\n\nPatrick O. Atuonah, Treasurer (MD)\n\nPauline Fletemeyer, Secretary (1985-1986) (DC)\n\nNew Chapter established: New York City BDA #4."
