        "text": "Dillingham Cemetery, Liberty TownshipIndex of Dillingham Cemetery burials . . . .\n\nThe Dillingham Cemetery is located on the west side of Old Indiana 49 (Business Route 49) at the intersection with County Road 750 North, and was originally part of the Olcott Dillingham farm. The cemetery was last read in November 1993 by Eleanor Turpin for the Northwest Indiana Genealogical Society (NWIGS). The cemetery is well-kept despite being inactive; the last known burial occurred in 1944. Note that the controller of the Dillingham Cemetery considers it still open for burials.\n\nIt is believed that there are at least six unmarked burials in the Dillingham Cemetery.

R. Clark. There is only a simple field stone with the following figures crudely chiseled on it - L. Cole 1886. The Boy Scouts keep moving this stone to the side of the cemetery so they can mow it, and I [Tim Cole] keep returning it to one of the unmarked graves since I don't know where she is really buried within this cemetery. She was a sister to Edward P. Cole and was living alone in a small cabin on the property of John C. Cole, her nephew, as reported in the 1880 Census. I think her death was recorded in a Valparaiso newspaper as only a line item in a neighborhood news section, but it was June 19, 1886. She was evidently born in 1820 (from the Census report) in Bronson Township, Huron County, Ohio. Lavina was married December 23, 1861, in Huron County, Ohio, to a W. R. Clark. Any subsequent circumstances concerning this marriage are unknown, only that she arrived a few years later in Porter County, expecting to live with her brother, but his suicide and the turmoil it caused within the family prevented her from achieving that. His son John evidently took care of her after that and until her death. Her husband did not come with her, and she resumed her maiden name -- he may have died, and this may have been her second marriage.\n\nSource: Information concerning the burial of Lavina (Cole) Clark was provided to Steven R.

His infant child was taken ill with lung fever, and he did not get a doctor, not knowing the child's condition was dangerous, because he thought no doctor would respond to his call, the Valparaiso road being almost impassable. The child died week before last. Had there been a gravel road between Chesterton and Valparaiso, it is very probably that the child would have had medical attendance and its life saved.\n\nObituary Source: The Westchester Tribune, Chesterton, Porter County, Indiana; April 3, 1897; Volume 13, Number 51, Page 7, Column 3\n\nDECARE, Laura\n\nBirth: 0 - 0 - 0000\n\nDeath: 2 - 0 - 1878\n\nNotes:\n\nObituary: Notes from North Center. -- The funeral services of Mrs. Laura DeCare were conducted by Rev.

These were his words: \"About the year 1788, and when I was about 16 years old, I was a sailor on board a merchant ship, on a voyage from Boston to Portugal, for a cargo of wine. On our homeward bound passage, we had provided for only a twenty day's passage, and the storm was such that we were kept nearly forty days at sea; during the latter part of which time we were on very short allowance, and actually reduced to such an extremity as to seriously contemplate the necessity of casting lots which of our number should first be sacrificed for food to sustain the rest.\"<br>\n\nSource: The Republic, Valparaiso, Porter Co., Indiana, October 3, 1861<br>\n\nDILLINGHAM, Olcott\n\nBirth: 12 - 20 - 1827\n\nDeath: 2 - 21 - 1904\n\nNotes: Porter County Library Death Index card catalog indicates that Olcott Dillingham was born December 20, 1827, in Ohio, and died on February 21, 1904, in Liberty Township, Porter County, Indiana, at the age of 76 years.

She was adopted when three years old by Mr. and Mrs. Weaver, her former name being Newberry. Her funeral took place Sunday afternoon at Cole's school house, Rev. Hufford officiating, and the remains laid to rest in the Dillingham cemetery.
