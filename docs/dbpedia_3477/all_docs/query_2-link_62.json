Some of our Kysars married into the ARBUCKLE family as well as many others. We have Frederick Kysar as the start of the Kysar Kin Book. He was born in Berks Co., PA, married in Jefferson Co., KY to Meriba or Mary Ann Cornwall. Many of the children, grandchildren and great grandchildren have been listed as being in Jennings Co., Indiana. Earilier I had received copies of a few papers of the Jennings County, Indiana 1816-1999 book with the Kysar's listed. It was very disturbing to see that they have the Cemeteries listed as being abandoned and the Kysar one was listed. We had been informed that the Kysar Kin Book proceeds in the 1980's went to buy a new head stone for Frederick Kysar. He was a veteran of the Revolutionary War and is buried in the Kysar Cemetery. I am trying to get more information about this and do not seem to get anywhere. This was on page 82 of the above mentioned book. If I could get any information about Frederick's grave and more information on the family I would appreciate it.\n\nCarol"
