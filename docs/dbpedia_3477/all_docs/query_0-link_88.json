Lottie is survived by her four children, Augustus (Cheryel), Keith (Virginia), Brian and David (Stacie); five granddaughters, Bailey Lyall (Anthony), Alexis, Rachel, Allise and Olivia Thurman; two grandsons, Christian and John Thurman; and two great-grandchildren, Madison and Trey Lyall, her sister, Martha Gaston as well as countless other relatives and friends. Lottie was predeceased by her husband, Augustus R. Thurman, Sr.\n\nLottie Sumlin was born in Marks, Mississippi to sharecroppers, Alonzo and Beulah (Thompson) Sumlin. She was the younger sister to her only sibling, Martha. After the untimely death of their mother from cancer, their father was unable to care for the girls on his own. Subsequently, Lottie and her sister were sent north (a customary practice during that era) to Gary, Indiana where they were raised by their Aunt Mary and Uncle Simms. When Lottie was enrolled in the Gary public school system, they attempted to put her in a different type of classroom but she complained to her Aunt Mary that something was just not right with those kids and she did not belong there. That class turned out to be a Special Education Class. Lottie immediately requested a tutor and within the year tested out of that class and began excelling… never looking back. From this experience, Lottie embraced the notion that she would not ever allow anyone else to define her abilities and that she would be able excel academically with hard work and a little help.\n\nIt was in Gary that Lottie met her future husband, Augustus \"Gus\" Raleigh Thurman, who served in the United States Air Force. Their first child, Augustus R. Thurman, Jr. was born, in Gary, Indiana, in 1958. Their second and third sons, Keith and Brian, were born in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1960 and 1961. The fourth and final son, David was born in Dayton, Ohio in 1966. Unfortunately, Gus was killed in a tragic train accident in 1972 and Lottie at 36 years old was a widow and a single mother with four sons to raise alone. However, it was because of her late husband’s insistence and support that Lottie began her nursing studies. He had prophetically told her that if she became a nurse, she would be able to financially take care of herself and the boys in case anything ever happened to him. Although she encountered monumental obstacles through a bout of blindness from a congenital disease (she only recovered sight in one of her eyes) as well as Grave’s Disease of her thyroid, she did become a registered nurse. Lottie went on to serve as a school nurse for 27 years in the Dayton, Ohio public school system, touching and improving the lives of countless children. Lottie transformed her office into a “sanctuary” for any child in need.\n\nLottie was a staunch believer in the value of a good education. She often told her boys, “Minorities cannot afford to be Black and Uneducated!” From a “seed” planted in that Special Education class, Lottie exemplified this in her own life: Purdue University, Lafayette, Indiana, Practical Nursing Program, November 1, 1965; Good Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing, Dayton, Ohio, December 10, 1971; Certificate of Nurse Registration (Exam) Registered Nurse, May 1, 1972; Sinclair Community College, Dayton, Ohio, Associate In Arts, June 1974; Park College, Parkville, Missouri, Bachelor of Arts Social Psychology, 1976; The University of Dayton. July 29, 1990, with the encouragement, the love and the support of her sons along with many others, Lottie finally achieved her Masters of Science degree.\n\nLottie was a strong, loving, compassionate and caring woman of God. She never met a “stranger” and always believed that she could learn something from anyone. Though she only had sons, she opened her heart and home to many “adopted” daughters while serving as mentor and counselor to many others. She always attributed her success to her work ethic, her discipline and her obedience. She was always obedient to those individuals that God had placed in her path for guidance and she was obedient to the Word of God.\n\nFifteen years ago, Lottie joined her sons Brian and David and daughter-in-law, Stacie in Portland, Oregon to make it her new home and embraced the evergreen and splendid nature of the Pacific Northwest. Lottie always loved nature especially lush greenery and flowers. She did not even mind all the rain because it was necessary to make everything fresh, clean and green. She found a wonderful home in a picturesque neighborhood where she could walk every day or sit on her front porch and watch everyone else walk. She spoke highly of the excellent medical care she received in Portland and her amazing new church home and family. Lottie enjoyed: a good laugh, a good book, a good sermon, any good gospel music (Jimmy Swaggart and Andraé Crouch were among her favorites.\n\nLottie oftentimes related how she used to rely on her mother’s faith and traditions until she found her own. Mid-life she became filled with The Holy Spirit and re-affirmed and recharged her faith, becoming an active member and leader in her church, Mt. Calvary Baptist Church, in Dayton, Ohio and later at Life Change Church in Portland, Oregon. It was here at Life Change that her faith and spirit grew exponentially. Lottie challenged herself to the very end to do God’s will and touch souls and show Jesus to everyone she encountered and that is exactly what she did. She even accompanied one of her doctors in a rendition of Amazing Grace while being wheeled into a medical procedure. Lottie shared that all her life’s challenges were merely stepping stones to future successes that were to be shared with others.\n\nShe confessed that she gradually realized that all of her accomplishments, all of her degrees and all of her material possessions paled in comparison to the winning of souls for Christ. Lottie Vera Thurman was truly a Woman of Grace!\n\nLottie was predeceased by her parents Alonzo and Beulah Sumlin and her husband, Augustus “Gus” Raleigh Thurman. She is survived by her four children: Augustus (Cheryel), Keith (Virginia), Brian and David (Stacie); her five granddaughters: Bailey Lyall (Anthony), Alexis, Elyse, Rachel and Olivia Thurman; her two grandsons, Christian and John Thurman and her two great-grandchildren, Madison and Trey Lyall and her sister, Martha Gaston.\n\nA memorial service will be held at Life Change Church, 3635 North Williams Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97227 on June 17, 2017 at 11:00 AM.
