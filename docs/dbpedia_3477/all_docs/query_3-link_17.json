        "text": "UPDATE: IMPD said Thursday that, after consulting with the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office, officers released the man detained at the scene of the Gable Lane Drive homicide.\n\nThe Marion County Coroner’s Office identified the victim as 37-year-old Bryan Williams. His death was ruled a homicide.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — A man was found shot dead Wednesday afternoon at apartments on the north side, Indianapolis police say.\n\nIndianapolis Metropolitan Police Department was sent shortly after 2:50 p.m. Wednesday to the 3900 block of Gable Lane Drive. That’s at The Residence at White River Apartment Homes. They’re along the White River just north of 38th Street and I-65 off Knollton Road.\n\nLt. Shane Foley with IMPD public affairs said from the crime scene that a male was detained after the shooting, but it was not clear if he was a suspect. He did not know if the male was an adult or a juvenile.\n\nOfficers arrived to find a maroon car crashed into another vehicle, Foley said. The dead man was found in the car. Investigators believe the man was shot in the car elsewhere in the apartment complex, then drove and hit a van and another vehicle before he was found in the driver’s seat of the stopped car. Foley said he did not know if anyone else had been in the car.\n\nInvestigators were not sure what may have led to the shooting, Foley said. Detectives were seeking witnesses and video from the scene. Anyone with information can call IMPD Detective Lottie Patrick at 317-327-3475 or lottie.patrick@indy.gov.\n\nThe shooting on Gable Lane Drive was not believed to be associated with another shooting about 10 minutes earlier on Burdsal Parkway, Foley said.\n\nBurdsal Parkway shooting\n\nAbout 10 minutes before the report on Gable Lane Drive, another person was reported to have been found shot on the near-west side.\n\nIMPD about 2:45 p.m. Wednesday was sent to 1101 Burdsal Parkway, the address for Community Spirits liquor store. That’s just a couple of blocks west of the White River. The person shot was in critical condition, IMPD says. No additional information was immediately available."
