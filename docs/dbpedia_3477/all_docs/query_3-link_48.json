If you are reviewing a person who is not the Head of Household, be sure to look at the Head of Household entry to see if there is additional information.\n\n2.Name Spelling: The spelling of names in source documents is often incorrect, with the name being spelled the way the writer thought it sounded. The spelling could be different in every document. In most cases the name is reported in this document as it was written, but some gross misspellings have been corrected.\n\n3.Direct Ancestral Line: The direct ancestors of Robert Edward Lane are highlighted in blue."
