        "text": "Birthday – 26 September\n\nWho is Serena Williams?\n\nAmerican professional tennis player, a top ranker in women’s tennis, she holds the maximum number of Grand Slam titles in singles, doubles and mixed doubles.\n\nFive Facts about Serena Williams\n\nShe has 39 Grand Slam titles\n\nShe is a four-time Olympic gold medalist\n\nShe has started two schools in her name in Kenya\n\nShe published her autobiography ‘On the line’ in 2009\n\nShe loves to watch gymnastics\n\nInspirational Quotes from Serena Williams\n\n“Think of all the girls who could become top athletes but quit sports because they’re afraid of having too many defined muscles and being made fun of or called unattractive.”\n\n“I don’t like to lose — at anything… Yet I’ve grown most not from victories, but setbacks. If winning is God’s reward, then losing is how he teaches us.”\n\n“With a defeat, when you lose, you get up, you make it better, you try again. That’s what I do in life, when I get down, when I get sick, I don’t want to just stop. I keep going and I try to do more. Everyone always says never give up but you really have to take that to heart and really do never definitely give up. Keep trying.”\n\n“I am lucky that whatever fear I have inside me, my desire to win is always stronger.”\n\n“The success of every woman should be the inspiration to another. We should raise each other up. Make sure you’re very courageous: be strong, be extremely kind, and above all be humble.”\n\nSerena Williams Biography\n\nEarly Life\n\nShe was born in Saginaw, Michigan, to Richard Williams and Oracene Price, the youngest of five. Though her father was her first coach, she was mentored by other coaches and began competing in the national junior championships.\n\nHusband and Children\n\nShe married Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of the website, Reddit. With the birth of her daughter, she missed most of the 2017 season. The following year, she returned to the courts.\n\nTurning Point\n\nTraining daily for two hours under her father’s tutelage from when she was five, she grew accustomed to the mental and physical rigors required to play professionally. The family moved to Florida to better the budding tennis career, and she ranked first in the junior US Tennis Association tour in 1991. She and her sister Venus were groomed for professional tennis, and they became known as the Williams sisters.\n\nMission and Work\n\nShe turned professional in 1995, playing at the Bell Challenge in Quebec City, but lost the championship. She entered the Australian Open three years later, but lost to her sister. But by 1991, she won the US Open, becoming the first Williams to win the Grand Slam.\n\nBy the age of 20, the Women’s Tennis Association had ranked her number one in the world. She continued her winning streak by winning four Grand Slam titles. Along with her sister, she competed against others, as well as each other.\n\nIn 2003, she seemed to be burned out by this intense pressure. The loss of motivation caused her to slip in her rankings. She had some personal and health issues which resulted in the burnout.\n\nShe was made UNICEF international goodwill ambassador in 2011, and by 2013, she was back firmly in the tennis circuit, winning her third US Open. Her interest in fashion was noticed by the media as she wore colourful outfits while playing. She became an entrepreneur, floating her company which made designer clothes, handbags and jewellery.\n\nHer commitment to issues of gender parity and racial equality grew more pronounced, and she expressed her views using social media. She has received many awards for her work with the black community. In addition, the Serena Williams Foundation has worked to provide help for underprivileged students.\n\nLegacy\n\nFacing personal loss and health concerns, her story of grit and determination, coupled with her fierce desire to extend a hand to less fortunate people, has made her an inspirational figure."
