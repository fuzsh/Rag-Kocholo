        "text": "Lemuel Moss was born in Boone County, Kentucky on December 27, 1829, to Rev. Demas and Esther Moss. He received his AB in 1858 from the University of Rochester, and a degree from the Rochester Theological Seminary in 1860. Moss also received an honorary DD in 1868 and an honorary LLD in 1883 from the University of Rochester.\n\nDr. Moss was a printer by trade. He served as Pastor of the First Baptist Church of Worcester, Massachusetts from 1860 to 1864, and was pastor in Woodbury, New Jersey from 1864 to 66. From 1864 to 1865 he served as Secretary of the U.S. Christian Committee. In 1865, Moss began his career in education when he became Professor of Theology at the University of Lewisburg (now Bucknell), where he remained until 1868. In 1874, Dr. Moss accepted the post as President of the University of Chicago, which he left the following year to become President of Indiana University. He maintained this position at IU until 1884 when he resigned amidst a scandal involving himself and a female professor at the University. He later resurrected his career as Lecturer of Christian Sociology at Bucknell University, a post he held from 1898 until his death on July 12, 1904.\n\nDr. Moss was actively involved in a number of organizations, including the American Baptist Historical Society, where he served as president from 1895-1900 and vice president from 1900-02; the American Baptist Missionary Union, where he served as vice president from 1883-84; and the National Council on Education, 1880- 84.\n\nMoss married Harriet Bingham of Cincinnati, Ohio on December 24, 1851. They had three children: Charles Henry, Harriet Payne, and Mary Helen."
