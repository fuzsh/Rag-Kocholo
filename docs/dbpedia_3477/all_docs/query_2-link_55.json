        "text": "Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, but raised in San Diego, California, Adam Lambert emerged as a global superstar from his breakthrough performance on the eighth season of American Idol. His unique blend of theatrical flair and vocal prowess set him apart and he quickly gained international recognition. Despite finishing as a runner-up on the show, Lambert's talent was undeniable, and he swiftly carved out a successful career in both music and acting. Lambert's debut album, For Your Entertainment, was launched in 2009 to critical acclaim. The album was a commercial success, reaching the top 10 in the US Billboard 200 chart and earning him a Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. His subsequent albums, Trespassing and The Original High, further established his reputation as an accomplished artist, with Trespassing debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. Beyond his solo work, Lambert is also known for his collaboration with Queen as their lead vocalist since 2011, performing in several world tours with the iconic rock band. In addition, Lambert has been actively involved in various philanthropic endeavors, particularly those supporting LGBTQ+ rights. His influence extends beyond music, making significant contributions to social issues and inspiring countless fans worldwide with his unapologetic authenticity and powerful performances.\n\nHerbert Richard Baumeister (April 7, 1947 – July 3, 1996) was an American suspected serial killer. A resident of Westfield, Indiana, Baumeister was under investigation for murdering over a dozen men in the early 1990s, most of whom were last seen at gay bars. Police found human remains on Baumeister's property and issued an arrest warrant, after which he fled to Canada and subsequently committed suicide before he could be brought to trial. He never confessed to the crimes and his suicide note made no mention of the murder allegations. He was later linked to a series of murders of at least nine men along Interstate 70, which occurred in the early to mid-1980s.\n\nMarshall Walter \"Major\" Taylor (November 26, 1878 – June 21, 1932) was an American professional cyclist. He was born and raised in Indianapolis, where he worked in bicycle shops and began racing multiple distances in the track and road disciplines of cycling. As a teenager, he moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, with his trainer and had a successful amateur career, which included breaking track records. Taylor turned professional in 1896, at the age of 18, living in cities on the East Coast and participating in multiple track events including six-day races. He moved his focus to the sprint event in 1897, competing in a national racing circuit, winning many races and gaining popularity with the public. Between 1898 and 1899, he set numerous world records in race distances ranging from the quarter-mile (0.4 km) to the two-mile (3.2 km). Taylor won the sprint event at the 1899 world track championships to become the first African American to achieve the level of cycling world champion and the second black athlete to win a world championship in any sport (Canadian boxer George Dixon, 1892). He was also a national sprint champion in 1899 and 1900. He raced in the U.S., Europe and Australasia between 1901 and 1904, beating the world's best riders. After a two-and-a-half year hiatus, he made a brief return in 1907, before retiring aged 32 to his home in Worcester in 1910. Towards the end of his life Taylor faced severe financial difficulties which forced him into poverty. He spent the final two years of his life in Chicago, Illinois, where he died of a heart attack in 1932. Throughout his career he challenged the racial prejudice he encountered on and off the track and became a pioneering role model for other athletes facing racial discrimination. Several cycling clubs, trails, and events in the U.S. have been named in his honor, as well as the Major Taylor Velodrome in Indianapolis and Major Taylor Boulevard in Worcester. Other tributes include memorials and historic markers in Worcester, Indianapolis, and at his gravesite in Chicago. He has also been memorialized in film, music and fashion."
