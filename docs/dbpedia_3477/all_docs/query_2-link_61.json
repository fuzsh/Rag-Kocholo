She was an educator, pioneering journalist, an early leader in the civil rights movement and a founder of the NAACP. As an ardent suffragist, she worked with both white and African-American suffrage organizations. Wells-Barnett was awarded the 2020 Pulitzer Prize “for her outstanding and courageous reporting on the horrific and vicious violence against African Americans during the era of lynching.”\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_B._Wells\n\nVilma Socorro Martinez\n\nAmbassador Vilma Socorro Martinez, a labor lawyer, who as president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, helped secure an extension of the Voting Rights Act to include Mexican Americans among the groups it protected. In 1975, Congress agreed to extend the existing provisions of the Voting Rights Act to include Mexican Americans. Later, Martin served as the first woman U.S. ambassador to Argentina.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilma_Socorro_Martínez\n\nSojourner Truth\n\nOne of our most famous women of history, Isabella Baumfree was an African American abolitionist and women’s rights activist who escaped from slavery with her infant daughter in New York in 1826. Adopting the name Sojourner Truth, she became an itinerant preacher and grew to become a nationally known advocate for equality and justice, advocating for a variety of social reforms, including women’s property rights, universal suffrage, and prison reform.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_Truth\n\nMabel Ping Hua-Lee\n\nMabel Ping Hua-Lee was a Chinese advocate for women’s suffrage, a member of the Women’s Political Equality League, and the head of the First Chinese Baptist Church in New York’s Chinatown for more than 40 years. Hua-Lee led on horseback a suffragist parade New York City in 1912, attended by ten thousand people. Mabel, however, could not vote in any elections due to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiua_Lee\n\nMargaret Murray Washington\n\n“Margaret Murray Washington was an educator and a reformer. In 1890, she became the lady principal at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, founding the Tuskegee Woman’s Club. By 1915, Washington had become president of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), which she had co-founded. When Susan B. Anthony invited national women’s organizations to enter official statements to be published in the fourth volume of the History of Woman Suffrage, Washington responded for the NACW and her statement was the sole representation of Black women in that volume.”\n\nhttps://suffragistmemorial.org/african-american-women-leaders-in-the-suffrage-movement/\n\nMeri Te Tai Mangakahia\n\nA campaigner for women’s suffrage in New Zealand, Meri Te Tai Mangakahia was a suffragist who inspired future generations of Māori women. In 1893, Mangakahia addressed a Maorip parliament (the first woman to do so), submitting a motion in favor of women being allowed to vote for, and stand as, members of the Kotahitanga Parliament. In 1897, Maori women won the right to vote.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meri_Mangakāhia\n\nJosephine St. Pierre Ruffin, (1842 -1924)\n\nJosephine St. Pierre Ruffin was the first African-American graduate of Harvard Law School, first African American elected to Boston City Council and the first African-American municipal judge.

She founded a number of other organizations for Black women, convened the First National Conference of the Colored Women of America, was one of the founders of the NAACP, and published Woman’s Era, the country’s first national newspaper written by and for African-American women.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_St._Pierre_Ruffin\n\nAdelina Otero-Warren, (1881 –1965)\n\n“Adelina “Nina” Otero-Warren’s enthusiasm for suffrage proved crucial to the movement in New Mexico, where she became a leader in the efforts of the National Woman’s Party to organize the state. Descended from elite Hispanos, or settlers of Spanish-speaking origins, she garnered support for women’s suffrage among Spanish- and English-speaking communities. She later served as New Mexico’s first female government official and made an unsuccessful congressional bid in 1922.”\n\nhttps://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/about-this-exhibition/more-to-the-movement/adelina-nina-otero-warren/\n\nWilhelmina Kekelaokalaninui Widemann Dowsett, (1861 –1929)\n\nShe was a Native Hawaiian suffragist who helped organize the National Women’s Equal Suffrage Association of Hawaii, the first women’s suffrage club in the Territory of Hawaii in 1912. She actively campaigned for the rights of the women of Hawaii to vote prior to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelmina_Kekelaokalaninui_Widemann_Dowsett\n\nSusette La Flesche, (1854 -1903)\n\n“She served as an expert witness and worked as an interpreter in court cases that Native peoples brought against the federal government. She also received widespread fame as an orator, speaking out about the lack of rights afforded tribes. As activists, they lobbied strenuously to improve conditions on reservations and for U.S. citizenship, which was granted to them only in 1924.”\n\nhttps://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.2013.3\n\nMary Ann Shadd Cary\n\nShadd Cary was an American-Canadian anti-slavery activist, journalist, publisher, teacher, and lawyer. She was the first female African-American newspaper editor in North America when she edited The Provincial Freeman from Canada that sought to empower African-Americans. Shadd Cary joined the National Woman Suffrage Association, testifying before the Judiciary Committee of the U.S.House of Representatives, and becoming the first African-American woman to vote in a national election.\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mary_Ann_Shadd#/Social_activism\n\nZitkála-Šá\n\nIn her work as a co-founder of the National Council of American Indians in 1924, Zitkála-Šá (Yankton Dakota Sioux) was an author, musician, composer, lecturer, translator and suffrage activist who ran a voter-registration drive among Native Americans. She lobbied for the Indian Citizenship Act that granted Native Americans U.S. citizenship, but it did not grant those living on reservations the right to vote in local and state elections. Zitkala-Ša continued to work for civil rights, and better access to health care and education for Native Americans until her death in 1938.\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Zitkala-Sa#/overview\n\nYara Shahidi\n\nYara is the co-founder of Eighteen x 18. Eighteen x 18 was launched in January, just one month before Shahidi’s 18th birthday. She describes it as a nonpartisan platform to help young people understand just what exactly is going on in politics and to inform them about their power at the polls.\n\nhttps://www.eighteenx18.com/\n\nMilagros Benet de Mewton\n\nAfter the United States acquired Puerto Rico from Spain, inhabitants of the island gained U. S. citizenship. Benet de Mewton, an educator and women’s rights advocate, joined the first suffragist organization in Puerto Rico, Liga Femínea Puertorriqueña in 1917. When U.S. women gained the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment, Benet de Mewton led the push to extend its coverage to Puerto Rico by suing and losing in Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court, and later by successfully pressing the U.S. Congress to recognize their voting rights, in 1929.\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Milagros_Benet_de_Mewton\n\nJessica Younts\n\n“Jessica has served as the Vice President of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition (FRRC) since incorporation in 2011 and is the current Research and Policy Director. She was involved with the drafting and ultimate passing of Amendment 4 in Florida, which eliminated the lifetime ban on voting for people with felony conviction and then re-enfranchised over 1.45 million people with past felony convictions in the state of Florida.”\n\nhttps://floridarrc.com/jessica-younts/\n\nFrances Harper\n\nHarper was an abolitionist, suffragist, poet, teacher, public speaker, and writer, one of the first African American women to be published in the United States. “She was a founding member of the American Woman Suffrage Association, and in 1873, after returning from a tour of freedman’s communities in the reconstructed states of the South, she delivered the closing speech at the AWSA convention in New York. Harper told the convention, “As much as white women need the ballot, colored women need it more. She called for equal rights and equal access to education for Black women, clearly defining race as a factor in the denial of women’s rights.”\n\nhttps://suffragistmemorial.org/african-american-women-leaders-in-the-suffrage-movement/\n\nMaria de Lopez\n\nShe was a California suffragist and an educator from Los Angeles. In the 1910s, Evangelina de Lopez campaigned and translated at rallies in Southern California, where suffragists distributed tens of thousands of pamphlets in Spanish. She was also the president of the College of Equal Suffrage League of Southern California when suffrage was won in 1911. In 1902, she became the youngest instructor at the University of California, making her possibly the first Latina to teach at UCLA. During WW I Evangelina de Lopez learned to fly a plane and served in the ambulance corps in France. She was later cited for bravery by the French government.\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Maria_de_Lopez#/Suffrage_work\n\nDonna Semans\n\nSemans, an enrolled member Rosebud Sioux Tribe, ran Four Directions’ get-out-the-vote (GOTV) operation in South Dakota’s Oglala Sioux Tribe’s Pine Ridge Indian Reservation for the 2014 election. Semans hired drivers and set up a command center to help tribal members get to the polls. Her team transported voters from around the 2.1 million-acre reservation to a single polling place in Pine Ridge Village. In August 2016, Semans helped conduct a comprehensive survey of over 800 voting age Native Americans in Nevada, and nearly 600 in South Dakota, that focused on highlighting discrimination and disparities in voting access for Native Americans.\n\nhttps://www.fourdirectionsvote.com/team/donna-semans/\n\nTye Leung Schulze\n\nTye Leung became the first Chinese American woman to vote when she cast a ballot in San Francisco on May 19, 1912. Leung who was in her early twenties may have been the first Chinese woman worldwide to cast a vote. She also became the first Chinese American woman to pass the civil service exams and to occupy a government job. She had a successful career as a translator in helping many immigrants. In 1911, the year before Leung cast her first vote, California became the sixth state to pass laws that granted equal suffrage, after Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Idaho, and Washington.\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tye_Leung_Schulze\n\nRosa May Billinghurst\n\nRosa May Billinghurst was a suffragette and women’s rights activist in England. She belonged to the Women’s Liberal Association, the Women’s Social and Political Union, and later the Suffragette Fellowship. Though unable to walk due to childhood polio, Billinghurst was a heroic activist who did not let her disability get in the way of taking part in marches and demonstrations through the use of a modified tricycle. She participated in the British suffragettes’ window-smashing actions and was sentenced to several terms in prison, where she went on a hunger strike and was force-fed. She stopped her activities after Parliament gave some women the right to vote in 1918.\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rosa_May_Billinghurst\n\nKimberly Haven\n\n“Her advocacy work began when she sought to regain her own voting rights after release from a Maryland prison. As a result of Kimberly’s direction, hard work and with the support of organizations and affected individuals, the Maryland House and Senate in March 2007 approved the Voting Rights Protection Act, which re-enfranchised conservatively 50,000 residents who had completed their sentences. Since that time, Kimberly Haven has served as the executive director of Justice Maryland and the Maryland Justice Project. She was the project director for the Maryland Public Defender’s Pre-Trial and Bail Reform Campaign organizing one of the first court watch projects for bail reform efforts.”\n\nhttps://prochoicemd.org/about/staff/kimberly-haven-rji-coordinator/\n\nGertrude Bustill Mossell\n\nMossell was from a prominent free African American family of reformers and married to a physician.\n\n“A professional journalist (Mrs. N. F. Mossell), she wrote a women’s column in T. Thomas Fortune’s newspaper, The New York Freeman. Her first article, entitled “Woman Suffrage,” published in 1885, encouraged women to read suffrage history and articles on women’s rights.
