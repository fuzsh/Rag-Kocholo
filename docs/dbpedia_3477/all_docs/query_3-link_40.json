        "text": "Charlie and Janice Drake have lived in Northeastern Oklahoma for nearly 35 years. Janice, a graduate of the University of Oklahoma, worked at IBM in Tulsa until 1991; Charlie came to work at Phillips Petroleum after graduating from the University of Missouri with a doctorate in chemistry. He retired in 1998.\n\nBoth remain active in the community, serving on the boards of several local organizations. The Drakes’ generosity was vital to bringing the OKWU Library to life. In late 2006, the Drakes gave OKWU a challenge: offering the school a gift that valued almost $350,000, they told OKWU to raise matching funds by the end of 2007. OKWU met the goal before Easter 2007, and the Drakes responded by raising their total gift to nearly $1 million.\n\nIn October 2007, the Drakes joined the president, other donors, and members of the OKWU Board of Trustees for the groundbreaking ceremony of the Janice and Charles Drake Library.\n\nThe first floor of the library is named for Tom and Joan Phillippe.\n\nTom Phillippe has served The Wesleyan Church as a pastor and a missionary. He was also an accomplished businessman and the organizer of Nationwide Management and Opal Care Centers. Tom served on the Board of Trustees of Indiana Wesleyan University, and Joan served on the Board of Trustees for OKWU.\n\nThe garden is named in honor of Jim and June Pritchard.\n\nJim Pritchard spent 39 years at Phillips Petroleum, spending most of that time as director of Plastics Research. June Pritchard was an accomplished artist with works on display at OKWU. Both of them served on a number of local boards. Through the years, the Pritchards’ gifts to OKWU helped establish the music program, the Williams Music Library, the Carillon Bells, and the OKWU Eagle Scholarship."
