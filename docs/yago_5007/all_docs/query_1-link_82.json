        "text": "biography\n\nBorn in Neffs, Ohio, on June 4, 1927, beefy actor Kenneth Donovan Clark acted in a number of low-budget films during the 1950s and 1960s. After serving in the Navy in the mid 1940s, Clark worked at a number of jobs following the war including coal mining. Leaving that life behind, he embarked on a film career in Hollywood in the 1950s, signing with 20th Century Fox and appearing in a string of popular films. Clark had also been a physique model in the 1950s. In 1956, his busiest year, Clark appeared in five films, mostly westerns for Fox, but his biggest picture for the studio was musical the South Pacific (1958; with Rossano Brazzi. Mitzi Gaynor, and Ray Walston). While he made a big splash in that film, as with most other studios Fox dropped many of its contract players, including Clark. He then went into low-budget sci-fi films, such as Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959; with Yvette Vickers and Bruno VeSota) and 12 to the Moon (1960; with Tom Conway, Anthony Dexter, and Francis X. Bushman. He also did quite a bit of television work in the late 1950s, even shooting a television pilot, titled Brock Callahan. Unfortunately, the series was not picked up for broadcast.\n\nLEFT: Late 1950s portrait of Ken Clark (thanks to Michael Barnum). RIGHT: Mid 1960s Italian magazine cover\n\nToday, Clark is best remembered for a pair of horror/science fiction films. Produced by Roger Corman, Attack of the Giant Leeches was released as a short feature, with a running time of 62 minutes. The cast of Leeches includes Yvette Vickers in the role of the town tramp and Bruno Ve Sota as Vickers' long-suffering husband. The second, the Columbia Pictures science fiction release 12 to the Moon, has an impressive cast for a B movie, but special effects suffer from its low budget. Nonetheless, it's not a bad film, and Clark and the talented cast make it watchable. But these films did not help his career, so in the early 1960s, Clark went to Europe to star in a number of movies and enjoy the success that eluded him in Hollywood.\n\nthe films of ken clark\n\nOn the Threshold of Space (1956)\n\nLEFT: From Ken Clark's second film, the 20th Century Fox science fiction/drama On the Threshold of Space.

He acted in several peplums, including Hercules Against the Mongols (1963; with Mark Forest) and Hercules the Invincible (1964; with Dan Vadis) and Eurospy thrillers, such as From the Orient with Fury (1965; with Margaret Lee) and Special Mission Lady Chaplin (1966; with Jacques Bergerac, Helga Line, and Daniela Bianchi). However, by the time he was in his early 40s, Clark's acting career was over.\n\nKen Clark passed away from a heart attack in Rome on June 1, 2009, at the age of 81. Clark had just wrapped shooting on an Italian television show at the time of his death. It is unknown if Clark left any survivors; he was married to a childhood sweetheart in the 1940s and had three children, later divorcing. In 1962 and 1963, Clark was romantically linked to actress Shelley Winters."
