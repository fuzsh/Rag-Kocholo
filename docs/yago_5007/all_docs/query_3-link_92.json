        "text": "In 1982 top film directors and producers, including Steven Spielberg, John Landis, Joe Dante, and George Miller all contributed to what was to become The Twilight Zone: The Movie. During what was to be the final scene in the final day of film production, star Vic Morrow and two child actors, Renee Shinn Chen and My-ca Dinh Le died in a horrible accident. During the scene, Morrow’s character was getting chased by American gunfire in Vietnam while he was saving two Vietnamese orphans. The helicopter’s pilot, Dorcey Wingo (a Vietnam veteran), was supposed to fly close over the actors while pyrotechnic blasts went off. The pyrotechnics engulfed the helicopter, forcing it down. The aftermath of the helicopter crash left Chen crushed by one of the helicopter struts because Morrow had dropped her just before the crash. Morrow and Le were fatally injured by the helicopter’s top rotor blades.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nWhen details of the accident came to light, director John Landis and four others working on the film were charged with involuntary manslaughter. This was the first time a director has been charged with a crime for events that had happened on a movie set. In 1987, all five of the defendants were acquitted, but the three families of the victims took Landis and producer Spielberg to civil court and settled for an undisclosed amount.\n\nVic Morrow had two daughters – Carrie Morrow and actress Jennifer Jason Leigh. Director John Landis never apologized to either Vic Morrow’s family or the families of the two children.\n\nTo this date Steven Spielberg has never spoken to John Landis because of the accident and Landis’ actions during and after the trial."
