        "text": "DOWN TO THE MED\n\nIn August 1968, my roommate from Santa Clara University, Pete Borelli and I drove a “car delivery” new 1967 Mustang convertible from Market Street in San Francisco to Columbus Circle in Manhattan. That was the beginning of a 15 month adventure in Europe that almost ended with a stolen pack in North Africa. That stolen pack was a stroke of good fortune that drove me into hanging out in Spain for another 8 months grabbing bit parts in movies. It happened like this.\n\nWhen working odd jobs on Gibraltar in January and February of 1969, I had heard that they needed “American looking” extras and bit part players in a World War II movie being made up the coast, eastward about 100 miles. The film was to be about a famous tank commanding General and his battles in North Africa and Germany. The bit parts would be for close ups of General Patton’s troopers. And when Lou Branson showed up on that Monday on The Rock looking for fun we quickly decided to head east up the Costa Del Sol to see what was up. Little did we know that we were headed for interesting days in the making of the 1970 Academy Award winner of seven “Best’s” including “Best Picture, Director, and Actor”.\n\nWe stopped for two nights in Granada to hear some Flamenco music and watch the dance, drop by the Alhambra, and switched trains toward Almeria. The train took its rambling path around the twisted edges of the Sierra Madre. Evening darkened the hills when we stopped in the mountain town of Guadix and then continued on. The llght seeped away as we ran further and further into the heart of Andalusia. Rough, dry, scrabbled mountains – asleep since Noah, then the Romans, and then the Moors carved out a desert life among the stone and dust.\n\nBy ten or eleven we reached Almeria and in an exhausted state of mind wandered out of the small shack of a station. The few travelers who had been on the train quickly went their ways and we found ourselves by ourselves. The deserted streets stretched out as we walked alone through the silent buildings. The dark reached out towards us from behind the side lanes, single bulb light poles the only population. Lou and I looked for some sign of life – emptyness surrounded us. We came onto a roundabout with five or six streets intersecting. Several cafes showed signs of life. After a quick look around we found a small pension with a large room, two beds, and windows on the street. Well this was it..the place where they were making this war movie. The place where we hoped to get some work as American soldiers in World War 2. The place where we were to encounter the fascinating history of George F. Patton, Five Star General and a man of myth and legend.\n\nOur pension was on the Rambla Obera, a half a block from the roundabout called Puerta de Purchena. It was actually more like a square with wide sidewalks and walking streets debouching into the area. Like many Mediterranean towns this one had the custom of the evening walk before the late dinner. More precisely it is a leisurely stroll. It is called the Paseo in Spanish and La Passeggiata in Italian. I am sure it has a nickname in Croatia and Greece and probably has been adopted today in all the countries bordering the sea. It is a lovely time..the heat of the day has broken, the girls go arm in arm in groups up to eight, watched carefully by their older women relatives who walk a number of paces behind. The men stop to talk and smoke cigars or step into a sidewalk bar for a small vermouth. Funny enough, the street where they walked each day was called Paseo de Almeria. The walk would start down near my old house by the sea at the Plaza de las Velas (The Candles) and then casually up the hill to the turn around at the Puerta de Purchena.\n\n“Turn arounds”, being what they are, present an opportunity for all strolling to slow way down. So just before eight PM struck on the town church-bells the Puerta was the crowded center of the town’s life for a half hour or so. In the sixties Spain was more a country of the 19th Century than the mid 20th. It was an old fashioned place with the ancient “courtly” traditions – all the months I lived there none of us guys ever had even a conversation with one of the beautiful, young Spanish ladies who walked with their chaperones each evening on El Paseo de Almeria.\n\nTowards late morning, after the long train ride from Granada and a good night sleep, Lou and I walked over to Puerta de Purchena and found a sidewalk cafe for Cafe con Leche. As we walked in we heard a few guys speaking english and made eye contact, giving a nod in their direction. After a short while we began to talk over the nearby tables. There were two light colored guys and a latin looking fellow with long black hair. One guy with a mustache, hair over his ears and a dusty complexion took the lead. His name was Neil and he gave us the beginninng of our basic training in being a movie extra. He told us there were a few dozens expat, 20-something year old guys and girls who had trickled into town for the jobs. The folks who had gathered here included Americans, Brits, Australians, Argentinians, and Canadians. If you had a reasonably fair complexion you would be welcomed at Estudio Espania. That was the studio that ran the nuts and bolts for the big production companies like Sergio Leoni or David Lean. There you might find out when the next casting call would happen. That in turn would result in the morning line up and possible selection by the casting manager for that month’s spaghetti western “extras”.\n\nThe great good news for Lou and I was that there was a casting call for “Patton” coming up. If we went to the entrance of the biggest, most luxurious hotel in town, The Gran Hotel Almeria, every morning around 7 am there would be a man from the studio who would tell the gathered hopefuls when and where to show up. That seemed a bit of a strange way to run the show but there was a reason. Most movie shoots start in the early morning light. It gives dramatic shadows and clear air. Often time the cast has to be on the distant set by 7 am – that is made up in costume and ready to shoot. So 4 am wake up calls were very common. In fact by 8 am the most of the crew would be gone from the hotel. Last to go were the senior producers; they needed to be there for the shoot but not the hours of setting up camera, lighting, sound, special effects, etc, etc. Since casting was no longer needed to babysit the cast and crew they could begin their day jobs – finding us!\n\nWHERE TO MAKE A MOVIE\n\nSo besides on the edge of the Costa Del Sol, where were Lou and I?\n\nAlmeria sits on a beautiful bay on the southern Mediterranean coast of Spain, a day’s hitchhike on a winding, cliffhanging road east of Malaga. It looks out south across the Med to Africa – Algeria and Morocco – the Sahara – and beyond. To the west is a point called Aguadulce, “Sweet Water”. To the east is Cabo de Gata – Cape of the She Cat. Cabo de Gato marks the end of the Alboran Sea, a unique section of the Med full of porpoise, dolphin, and sea turtles – an ancient and biorich salt water stew mixed of Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean sea life running from Gibraltar to Almeria.\n\nThis is the driest place in Spain – it is a true desert – dirt, empty arroyos, rock cliffs, valleys filled with foot deep masses of sharp, flat, slate chip gravel that tears your shoes. It is stinkin’ hot from April to September. In winter there are occasional wetlands with meagre creeks..if you walk out them there are small fields with bulls being raised for the Corrida Toro – it they get loose they will try to kill you. The dirt is sometimes white, the dirt is sometimes sand, the dirt is sometimes clods of hard clay..the dirt is everywhere. But the sky’s are big and the air is clear when dust devils aren’t at work. If you found yourself dropped there blindfolded and you took the mask off and someone said “you’re in New Mexico, or West Texas or three days horseback ride southwest of Juarez” you’d believe them. It is a spitting image of the America west desert country made famous in numerous John Ford, Glenn Ford, John Wayne, Delmer Daves, Gary Cooper, Alan Ladd, George Stevens movies.\n\nThe landscape is one of the reasons that in 1963 and 1964 Sergio Leone decided to film a large part of A Fistful of Dollars in the desert around Almeria. He had started work back in the early ’50’s in assistant director roles in “sword and sandal” movies including Quo Vadis with Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr and Ben Hur with Charlton Heston – all shot in desert like surround. In Leone’s first credited Director role, The Colossus of Rhodes, he filmed in numerous locations in northern and central Spain. Almeria had been chosen as the dry Mediterranean setting for a number of blockbusters including King of Kings, El Cid (with Sophia Loren), Lawrence of Arabia, and Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor) among others.\n\nOf course with big Hollywood productions, and lots of movies every year, the infrastructure needed to support all aspects of filming, from food and transportation, to sound and light equipment, was all developed to a world class level. Fred Koenekamp the Patton Directory of Photography and Academy Award winning Cinematographer said of the local team: ”The Spanish crew was really quite excellent, they are truly amazing people.” Technical staff, development, banking, casting, sets & location were all available with “Estudios Espania”, the Spanish Government film studio, being the central hub. In 1966 alone, nineteen films were released which had been at least partially shot in Almeria and in 1967 twenty five more. But of course it took Leone’s “Man with No Name Trilogy”, to put Andalusia on the map for casual movie buffs.\n\nIt is held that the “new” Spaghetti Western was successful because the traditional American cowboy film had ossified into a ritualistic morality play where good guys wore white hats and bad guys black. With cookie cutter plots and personalities, the moral tugs were expected and well known. After all it had been over a decade since High Noon and Shane, arguable the best ever, had been made. Only one great western, The Searchers, had been made in that decade and it was eight years before. Instead Ricky Nelson and Dean Martin, the balladeers, and Rock Hudson, the cover boy, were the draws. The new films coming out of Italy and Spain were driven by low budgets that coated the final product with a roughness matching the characters of the heroes and villians. With double crosses and back shooting galore, the plots could go anywhere. And the hero had no righteous background or romance to soften his story. Craggy faced, unshaven, deep creases like scars – mean looking. Leone filmed the three Clint Eastwood movies in 1964,1965,and 1966 and they were released in the US starting in 1967. When Lou and I arrived in early March 1968 the filming of Once Upon a Time in the West had just finished with Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson playing the heavies.\n\nIt was clear from looking at some of the better known films that had been partially filmed in the surrounding desert, that Almeria had appeal for much more than westerns only. The two other big themes in the mid Sixties were war, (How I Won the War, Tobruk, The Rat Patrol, Lost Command, Commandos), and crime, (The Cats, They Came to Rob Las Vegas). So given that General Patton’s first big battle success was in North Africa and then again in Sicily, both places where the terrain was identical to the deserts and mountains around Almeria, it was a no brainer to film in Almeria. And snow covered mountains towards northern Spain served nicely for Belgium and Germany which put the icing on the location cake.\n\nHOBO’S OF THE WORLD\n\nLouie and I stayed in the pension on the Rambla Obera for a couple of weeks. It was in a lonely deserted part of towns. Amphetamine was legal in Spain at the time and I’d pop some pills and pull all nighters reading Strindberg. The first few weeks in town were pretty slow, getting to know the other foreigners and looking for girls.\n\nNeil was typical of the guys hanging out hustling for jobs on the movies as they passed through. He and another American cat had worked on two cowboy movies in the last year. Four Rode Out with Leslie Nielsen, Pernell Roberts, and Sue Lyons and most recently Once Upon a Time in the West with Henry Fonda & Claudia Cardinale. He had not yet gotten a job on Patton but then the filming had just started. During the period Lou and I were in Almeria I recall about a dozen people who were working. The jobs went from dead soldiers to armed guards, so there was no talent required..just a look. Most of the guys were in their 20’s. The oldest fellow was about 40 – he was from Eastern Europe and was a professional deep sea diver. He had hurt his ears diving on oil rigs off West Africa and was just trying to survive. He had dark complexion but didn’t look Spanish. Another guy was an American named Ron..he was on disability and seemed financially comfortable – he had his wife and young daughter along and rented a house down the coast about an hours walk. Two american hipster guys blew in a week or so after Lou and I arrived. They had a guitar with them and would stay up nights taking acid and writing songs. The tall dark guy we met the first morning was Tony, the Argentinian. He was handsome and tall. Totally outgoing and friendly, in fact everyone was cool and in the lingo of Sixties San Francisco “heads.\n\nIn early March a couple showed up in town and checked into the Pension Oriental. They were Israeli’s in later 20’s. While he had dark skin and black hair, he also was tall, so he had gotten a role in the British pipe and drum band. There were no roles for girls. We’d often eat lunch in our rooms and once they asked me to join them. She said “we’ve bought some gobbledegook” … I asked what did you get? “gobbledegook – we got some gobbledegook” … I said “I don’t understand; what is that?” … “goobledegook! you know..you call it horse!!” Oh my goodness. The Israeli’s were asking me to join them in an afternoon lunch of horsemeat. Of course, being American, I had never considered eating, let alone eaten horse. But, I enjoyed the Israelis’s; they talked a lot and were lively. So I was leaning towards joining them, then thought – well how are they going to cook it? We did not have kitchen rights, but, I knew they had a small burner and used it sometimes. So I asked ‘em. “Oh we don’t cook it..we eat it raw!” NO WAY. I sat around and watched them prepare it the way “we do it at home”. They offered a taste but I politely declined. The man as I said loved to talk; he was the king of the “big dream”. We’d all meet up unplanned and unscheduled at any one of the sidewalk cafes or bars and we’d talk about where we were and the chances of getting roles. After any new news had been jawed to death our Israeli would start talking about how people he’d met had made millions..and within 5 or ten minutes he’d break into his copywrited aphorism: ”Think Boy’s! That’s all we have do do is Think! Think Boy’s – we can come up with an idea that will make us milliions – all we have to do is think”! He’d lecture us time after time and we laughed and laughed.\n\nEncarna was another person in town. She was part gypsy, maybe all gypsy. She lived in a small but lovely room on the roof of the Pension Oriental. We’d go up there in the evening to cool off and have a smoke. She’d sit there with us, even though she spoke no english, just soaking up together the warm star filled night. She was the cleaning gal for the guest rooms. She did the laundry for them as well – there wasn’t much – sheets every week and towels. She offered to do mine as well. One period in May, after Patton was over and before Sledge started, I hadn’t worked for several weeks and was flat broke. She realized it and one morning she showed up about 11 with a can of sardines and a loaf of bread for me. I’d never eaten sardines before but they sure were good that one time. She did it again three or four days later. I’ve never eaten canned sardines since then but their memory is sweet.\n\nOne of the delights of this period was the amazingly low cost of life on these edges of civilization. I was living on a dollar a day or about 75 pesetas I break it down from memory as follows in pesetas per day:\n\nPensione Oriental – 25\n\ncafe con leche y chocolate croissant – 5\n\nInternational Herald Tribune – 5\n\nsardines or ham and bread loaf for lunch – 15\n\ndinner at the market cafe – 20\n\nbeer & tapas evening – 5\n\nAt that rate we could work one day as a dead soldier or Wild West bandito get paid $30 and we were set for a month.\n\nWe all loved to go to the market cafe for dinner. Five or six of us would show up at about eight and be greeted with gusto by the rather large owner. He handed around to each a ceramic jug filled with cold, tart white wine. Everyone took a long, deep pull, clearing the heat of the day in the cool shadows. As we were seated in the room, which had maybe ten tables, a basket of unsalted, rough bread and a dish of local olive oil were given the group. Then came a half chicken, plump and roasted to perfection – crisp skin and clear juice flowing, soaking the pile of french fried potatoes which slipped in their abundance off the edges of the white country plates . Dessert was a custard dish of flan with a slightly toasted crust on top. YUM! All for about 30 cents.\n\nBut I am getting ahead of my story. The fact that they were making a movie about Gen. Patton was lost on us. Heck I was an Army Brat raised in the history of World War II and I couldn’t tell you one thing about Patton. No one was interested in learning anything about him either. I had returned from a year in combat operations in Vietnam on the Cambodia border just over a year before. I’d done operations with the 1st Cav Division, The 4th Infantry Division, The Korean White Horse Division, had been to Thailand, Japan, a lot of Western Europe but I had no idea that Patton waged war in NOrth Africa, Sicily, France, Belgium, and Germany. But we knew one thing – we might be able to get work making a movie about him down in the depths of Andalusia.\n\nCASTING CALL – PATTON\n\nThe word came out after Lou and I’d been in town about two weeks, late February or so, to show up at the Studio Espania, out towards the train station, at 9 o’clock Wednesday morning. A casting call for extras. A group of maybe 30 guys showed up; all the usual English speaking guys we’d been drinking with every evening, several new guys, and a bunch of locals. They had us line up outside on the dirt back lot. A Spanish exec named Eduardo walked out – he was head of casting for the Spanish State Studio. He told us there were 6 parts they were choosing for, 4 of them “one liners”. Lou and I got picked as did a guy named Ron who we had not seen much, a big American named Rich and his traveling buddy. The rest were sent home and we had a small meeting in the yard. Eduardo got all our names and pension names, told us our pay would be $100 a day and to expect one or maybe two days work. Said he’d get word to us when the next meeting would be. Then he lined us up and took a picture or two of each of us and that was it. Well we were happy guys, especially me who had no money to speak of.\n\nA few days later the word came that the producer’s team had decided to hire an acting coach for us. Since none of us had ever done any thing like be in a movie this sounded like a good idea. But there was more..it was going to be at the Aguadulce Hotel which was where George C Scott and Karl Mauldin were staying so we might get lucky and see those guys AND we were going to get $20 a day, a free lunch, and beer! Livin’ the dream.\n\nOur acting coach was a 30 year old experienced bit player from Hollywood. He was a nice guy – I can’t find him in the credits but his name was Robert and we called him Bob. He played a member of Patton’s staff with several scenes but no speaking role. He was however part of “the company” which meant he had been hired in Hollywood and was on a salary. If you were part of the company you were in a sweet spot..you made money even when you weren’tt working. So the producers told him to give us some training. At that point they assigned us our lines.\n\nLou and I joined together where I had a head wound and was bandaged so I could barely see..I had my hand on Lou’s shoulder as he limped ahead on a crutch, leading me. I had the line “Take me home. Please take me home. Take me home. Please take me home”\n\nWhen we got to the lesson at Aguadulce we all met by the pool then went into a room they’d rented. We started discussing our lines with Bob. He made sure we understood the context of the scenes. They were all taking place in the July 1943 Sicilian campaign where Patton was racing Montgomery to be the first to Messina. Once Messina was taken the Germans and Italian troops would have a difficult time rewinning the island and The Allies would have a convenient jumping off point to invade the peninsula. So it was the key to the initial invasion of Europe by the US and British. These scenes also helped flush out Patton’s personality and character. The whole movie develops significant creative tension around the question of his character. Is he a good general or a bad general? Clearly he wins battles but is it at too much of an expense of lives? The whole theme of the Sicilian part of the movie is to position him as somewhat reckless and careless in exposing his fighters to too much and/or unnecessary danger.\n\nThe friend of Rich was assigned “What silly son of a bitch is in charge of this operation”. Which is the line he says to Karl Mauldin when the two of them are crouched in a ditch foxhole during an artillery bombardment. Of course Mauldin is the CO and he gets a laugh when he answers “I don’t know but they ought to hang him”.\n\nRon and big Rich were assigned: Rich: “There goes old blood and guts” Ron: “ Yeah, our blood and his guts”\n\nRon, of “our blood and his guts” fame, was a mental epileptic and quite strange. I recall an evening I was at his house for dinner and, as we sat late into the night rapping, he caught moths and holding them careful by their wings, burned them to death in a candle – one at a time for almost an hour. One day he and I went swimming out at the Capo de Gato. He had lots of money it seemed. He rented a nice house on the cliffs above the Med south of town, had his wife and his daughter along. It was as if he was retired at 25. He had a VW Bug and as we sped along a dirt road kicking up dust and bouncing through the dry river beds and thorn bushes, I tried to listen to his story. He had been in government service of some type and had had a set of seizures that resulted in him being on government disability. That was how he could afford the splendor. He told me that he was a mental epileptic. Well I didn’t know what that meant so asked him what happened if he had a seizure. He said he could have one at any time and he’d start shaking uncontrollably and probably slip down under the steering wheel..all this as he drove like a maniac at twice a safe speed through the desert. As I pictured him having a fit and the Bug rolling over endlessly into the desert I said “Well, do you want me to drive”? Later we would tease him by begging him to “have a fit” while we were filming our bit parts and thereby push the shooting to a second day…but he nix’d our bright idea.\n\nMy part was very simple: four words said over and over. So I tried it out a half a dozen different ways, emphasizing each word more than the other three. Like this:\n\n“ PLEASE take me home”\n\n“Please TAKE me home”\n\n“Please take ME Home”\n\n“Please take me HOME”\n\nThen I started changing the even cadence and stretching out different words, and changing the length of the space between words..”P..L..E..A..S..E, take me home” “Please take me h..o..m..e”Then we tried different breath effects..turning “Please” into a heavy sigh..or “home” into a moan…There are at least several dozen ways to say that line..all of which have some validityThe favorite among the class ended up being something of a moaning wheedle of a beg.”PLEASE ….take me h-o-m-e”\n\nThe three teams filmed the scenes on a high ridge above the sea one cool morning in March. Equipment and trailers were spread out all over the bare hills. The Academy Award winning director, Franklin Schaffner, as he briefed me, had a much different take on the line. Patton (George C Scott) is sitting in a jeep as wounded soldiers go by. Patton refuses to look at them and ignores the obvious tragedies walking by. Out of the background comes my voice with the line, then Lou and I go limping by. Mr. Schaffner came up to me after makeup and “stage” directions had been given us. He looked me in the eye and said: “Gerry, I want you to say the lines over and over in a monotone. You know what I mean? No inflections. No emotions. You are in shock and you just repeat yourself the same way, over and over.” And that was it. Of course he had it right and all our histrionic practices had been for naught.\n\nTime seemed to move very slowly there on the edge of the Med. There was not anything much to do except keep tabs on potential casting calls and hang out on the beach as the spring weather bloomed. But then we started to go and watch some of the battle scenes.\n\nRon had the car and one evening shortly after the first casting call as we sat in a cafe having paelle Lou said he had met a guy named Dave Kramer, who said we ought to come out the next morning to watch a big scene. Ron said “let’s do it” and together he, Lou, Big Rich, and I went out and watched the scene where Patton has just arrived in Tunisia to take over the II Corps and he gets straffed by a German fighter..it was exciting – our first visit to the sets. A few weeks later we sat on a hill watching the massive portrayal of the famous battle of El Guettar where Patton vanquishes Rommel’s Panzer Corp. 20th Century Fox had hired the Spanish military to play the role of the two tank armies meeting. Fighters and bombers buzzed overhead; explosive charges rang through the hills; armies of hundreds of men and vehicles marched towards each other through the chaos tanks clanked down below, blank bullets shot by the thousands.. It was as real as one could imagine.\n\nThe final trip out into the desert was to watch Patton shoot two mules and have them pitched over the bridge railing down into the ravine below. It was 1969 in Franco’s Spain life was cheap – they killed real mules and pitched them down into a real river.\n\nWe had one other bit role in Patton. We all got picked for Montgomery’s pipe and drum band for the “entry into Messina”, which was a scene which would be shot in the center of town. We had 3 days of practice on marching and holding the instruments properly. They had hired the Sergeant Major of one of the Queen’s Guards bands to train us. He and his assistant began at the very beginning on postures and then marching in line, turning, etc etc etc. Having excelled at that sort of thing with twice a week parades at The Citadel for two years I had no problems. I was a drummer and we were given some rudamentary drumming training..we were told we could “quietlly” make like we were drumming so that it looked right in the film. It was great fun and entailled free lunches so we were all happy little pipers and drummer.\n\nSometime in February Lou and I had split up as roommates. He and I had been good friends since I met him at Santa Clara University. I had worked as a disc jockey with a late night jazz show at the radio station KSCU which he had founded. He dropped out of school for a semester and we rented an apartment in the Avenues near Golden Gate Park and the Ocean Beach in San Francisco in 1967-68. He was an amazing friend and fun loving guy. But I was living on a dollar a day and he had a generous allowance so he moved into the Gran Hotel Almeria which was very comfortable.\n\nI found a dream like room in the Pension Oriental in the middle of the old walking town. It was on the northeast corner so was always cool, with 10 foot ceilings, and two balconied french doors on each outside wall. The old town of Almeria is dozens of alleys and tiny streets, shops and cafes, small artisans. I was two blocks from the market and around the corner from the small park of San Pedro. But it was very quiet – no cars or scooters. The pension had no food and only one bath per floor with yesterday’s newspaper for hygienic purposes. My room was on the first floor. In the warm night I’d listen to the Spanish murmur of heeled women talking and walking through the maze of stone lanes; as the evening grew later the men would wander playing their guitars and singing.\n\nTowards the end of the Patton shoot Louie met Dave Kramer in one of the cafes or watering holes. Lou and I met most evenings for dinner in the old town and a few days later I too met Dave. While we had landed our parts in Almeria, Dave had actually been hired in California as part of the “core company” actors and was on a weekly salary. He’d been with the company for weeks before we came, filming the winter battle scenes in northern Spain, and also down in Rabat for Moroccan army scenes. He had been in a number of roles and is the guard saluting George C Scott at the door as he assumes his African command of the II Corps.\n\nAs the work in Patton wound down Dave made a decision to leave the company. He felt that this was “good duty”: hanging around the narrow atmospheric streets of this old Andalusian fishing and mining town, whitewashed stucco town houses, Moorish castle on the hill, cobbled streets, wrought iron lamps glowing in the soft evening air. We’d eat in the cheap bistros at the Mercado Central and have free tapas in the bars, swim in the Mediterranean, and seafood Paella on Thursday evening… Dave thought “why leave all this?”\n\nAround then Lou took off to see more of Europe and Dave asked me if I wanted to go in with him on an apartment down by the beach. The apartment would cost me another fifty cents or so a day But I was making kind of a steady living getting more parts than most. And it sounded like a great idea – the summer tourist season hadn’t started but it was warm and the sea beautiful. Plus, I was still waiting for a check to show up from my sister who I had asked to sell my Suzuki 250cc in Florence. I’d hitchhike down to Gibraltar every month, sneak onto the rock dodging police, but so far always returned empty handed. And there was a big movie soon to come with James Garner of Maverick fame. Across the street from Dave’s and my place were two nice English girls – in their mid twenties. One a beautiful dark haired lass named Shay and the second a fun loving blond with a slightly paralyzed left lower cheek – hardly noticeable. She was Lucy. We’d hang out for morning latte and sometimes have a salad together or meet down the beach at a cafe.\n\nMy next gig was a TV ad for RonRico rum. Three men were dressed in black Tuxedo’s and 3 women in cocktail dresses – there was a fellow dressed in a colorful Puerto Rican costume. We were out on top of the sand dunes in the Tabernas desert – the only true desert in Europe. It was just before sundown as the light washed the sand the waiter came up to the top of the dunes where he served us rum collins from a silver tray. Well, we wished, ’twas just water but cold ice cubes. They made us sign false “residual contracts” – I guess flowing them to relatives back in Puerto Rico. But I made 75 dollars so was set for another 4-6 weeks.\n\nA MAN CALLED SLEDGE AND OTHER FORGETTABLES\n\nJames Garner said “SLEDGE” was the worst he had ever made, said it was “not suitable for consumption” and called it “this turkey”. But there were many well known names in it: Garner and Dennis Weaver (Chester in Gunsmoke), Chet Aikins, John Marley .. all seasoned actors. The Director was Vic Morrow in his first and only big screen director’s job. He was a wildly successful TV star in “Combat” – the longest running WW2 TV series in history. Dave and I and Ron and Tony got roles as prisoners that Garner breaks out of the fromtier prison. We began to hang out in the fake cowboy towns and watch the “action”, realizing that it takes several hours of set up to film a scene that may last less than a minute. The fun thing was that Shay had started dating Vic Morrow and soon moved into the stylish Aquadulce Hotel. That led us to hang with Lucy more. Shay would come back to town every few days and tell us things like “Vic has a model of the prison and the town in his suite and he stays up all night planning shots – he’s obsessed!” and share gossip from on high. Morrow had written the script as well.\n\nThe movie starts with probably the worst song ever written and sung called “Other Men’s Gold”. It is painful to listen too. We hung around the prison scene work for at least 4 or 5 days. We only got two days of actual work. We had to wear hot, rough, dirty prison uniforms all day and were not allowed to take our tops off because of “Catholic Spain” and Franco’s strictness. As with most of my movie career..”the best of my parts ended up on the cutting room floor”.\n\nThe gypsy scene in Andalusia was invisible to me initially. As I explored the town over those weeks I realized that 5 or 6 blocks to the west of the Paseo the complexion of the town changed. I was in the neighborhood of the Gitanos – the Gypsies. After a while in town I had decided on a small cafe on the Puerta Puchena for my morning start. I would walk over from Pension Oriental in the lovely sun, pausing to get the 2 day old International Herald Tribune (then one of the great papers of the world), go inside and order a cafe con leche and a chocolate covered croissant, then go out to the sidewalk metal table and chairs and relax. Some where along the line I was advised that this cafe was a Gypsy place and that the fellow who served me each morning was in fact the “King of the Gypsies”. He was a tall dark haired, even featured guy, friendly; we exchanged pleasantries each morning and he often would bring my coffee out to the sidewalk table. One day he asked me if I had heard a new movie was supposed to start in a couple of weeks. It was to be a movie about President Franklin Pierce and his Mexico battles in the Mexican American War and word was out that there would be some extra’s needed. He asked if I knew how to ride a horse. I said “why sure”, stretching my summer camp experiences of trotting up dirt roads a bit. The King said “Don’t signup for any extra jobs. They want me to put together the horse men and if you want to ride you’ll make a lot more money..” Well I was very flattered that he’d asked me and of course told him I’d love it. As the weeks went by however, and the start slipped, I was getting low on pesetas, so when the casting call for extra’s came, with little warning, I took an extra slot. Well that’s one of the few disappointments in my life – I don’t know why I didn’t run over to the cafe and check with the King – but he’d said nothing since the original offer and besides I was a gringo and if push came to shove I’d probably not make his final cut. When he asked and I told him, he was a bit astounded and I realized i could have had the rider’s job. A few weeks later as we were filming out in the barrancos (I was a prisoner again in handcuffs in a horse drawn, barred, prison wagon) – we watched as the gypsy riders – a dozen strong on their little ponies, came wildly bouncing, jumping, sliding, tripping and holding on for dear life down a rocky dirt cliff. As i looked I though “Well maybe it’s a good think I didn’t do that!”. In retrospect I do regret that I didn’t get to know the Gypsy King better – when I went back 25 years later I couldn’t find his cafe but I walked through the Barrio de Gitanos and there were still kids playing in the streets, moms and sisters sitting in the door ways, grannies in black chatting at the corners, and old men playing checkers\n\nIt was nice to get to know the girls across the street at the beach house. By then it was mid May and we’d spend days with them on the sand. I realized I was getting way out of shape – losing weight and not exercising as I had in the Army. We had a couple of parties at our house and hit a disco a few miles out of town once or twice. One night about 2 am we decided to walk a few miles back to Almeria from the club – it was magic in the deep black star filled desert. I had taken to walking out in the stone encrusted desert on the burning heat of the afternoon. There was no sound but the wind.\n\nI had hitched down to Gibraltar looking for a check from sister Meg. I stopped in a small cafe on the road outside Motril. I had about seven pesetas beyond the ferry fare and presented them to the proprietor. He looked me over and said “keep the money”. He served me a big plate of rice and pork and waved as I hit the road I found people wonderfully generous in my time hitch-hiking around Europe. Didn’t find the check but instead met a lovely red haired english gal. We hitchhiked back up the road. One trucker pulled over and said he’d take the girl but not me. Jokers everywhere.\n\nIt was in this period that Dave and I made our run to Melilla to buy a kilo of grass. That was quite a thrill and you may read the whole story on this blog called MELILLA, North Africa posted August 2012. We were running out of money, there were no big productions scheduled and we could feel the urge to move on. Dave had a long standing tradition of joining his father, Jack Kramer, at the Wimbledon for The Championships which his father was a commentator for the BBC each year. We bid each other goodby, closed down the rental house, and he took off for London. So it was time to move on for me as well. We’d been in Almeria for going on 5 months. We’d worked in 3 movies and the TV ad, made a few hundred bucks, and had learned a bit about Andalusia but most importantly had a bit of fun.\n\nWith the money I made peddling grass I was able to consider heading for Madrid where we heard a big movie s tarring George Peppardwas about to start. Four of us jumped on the train headed to the capital. It was hot as blazes and there was no air conditioning so as was the tradition we climbed up on top of the train car and rode up there for much of the journey. We found the city of Madrid was booked solid in the height of the tourist season. The only pension room I could find was a honeymoon suite in a place near the Palacio de las Cortez, the seat of Spanish Government. I grabbed it and the next morning headed out the Paseo de la Castellana for the casting call. These things used to be pretty simple. Now if you want to be an extra you have to jump through all sorts of hoops. All we did then was show up on the side walk in front of the American Embassy. There were twenty or so of us. My old friend Eduardo, the head of casting for Studio Espania, from Almeria days, got out of a car and walked over. He lined us up and then walked don the line picking about five of the guys including me. He told the rest to leave and then gave us directions on where to meet a bus in a few days which would take us to where the movie was being shot. All costuming and paperwork would be done there and we would be assigned our parts. Slick!\n\nThis is the end of this chapter..the movie we made was called “Cannon for Cordoba” starring George Peppard and Giovanna Ralli, a beautiful girl who made a number of movies for Roberto Rossellini. I worked for five or six weeks and had one significant scene where I had a big gunfight with a couple of bandito’s in a burning village – I got shot up and died with my boots on. And that was the end of the story but I made enuf money to get home as the next chapter tells."
