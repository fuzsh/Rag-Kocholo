        "text": "May 29 marks the anniversary of the acquittal of Director John Landis on manslaughter charges following an infamous Santa Clarita helicopter crash that killed Twilight Zone actor Vic Morrow and two child actors.\n\nOn July 23, 1982 53-year-old Vic Morrow and two child actors died in a helicopter crash during the filming of “Twilight Zone: The Movie.”\n\nThe crash took place at Indian Dunes Park, a 600 acre ranch built by the Newhall Land and Farming Co. along the Santa Clara River between Santa Clarita and Piru.\n\nDuring the filming of an air attack scene at 2:20 a.m., Morrow took his place in the Santa Clara River with a child actor under each arm as Landis ordered the helicopter pilot to fly lower as explosives were set off. Fireballs rose into the night sky, coming too close to the aircraft and causing Wingo to lose control of the helicopter.\n\nThe chopper plunged into the river on top of Morrow and the children. All three were killed instantly; Morrow was decapitated by the helicopter’s whirling main rotor.\n\nFour years after the accident in 1986, four years after the incident, Landis was brought to trial after the families of the actors filed a series of lawsuits against Warner Bros. Studios, Landis, Spielberg and others.\n\nLandis faced three additional counts of manslaughter for “aggravated, reckless, grossly negligent” acts resulting in the deaths of Morrow and the children.\n\nOn May 29, 1987, after a lengthy and contentious trial, the jury acquitted him.\n\nHe went on to direct such successful movies as “Coming to America” (1988) and “Beverly Hills Cop III” (1994), both starring Eddie Murphy.\n\nSponsored Articles\n\nDo you have a news tip?
