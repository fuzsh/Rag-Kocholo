And I tell ya', if you try to take it, you're gonna' wind up dead, or in prison. And that's the closest you'll ever get to it, through six inches of steel. I know: I been closer to that gold INside, than any man OUTside. And I tell ya', it can't be taken.\n\nLuther Sledge:\n\n[Reflects for a moment] Oh, yes it can! Yeeehaaw!\n\nLuther Sledge:\n\n[Throws an empty whiskey bottle in the air and shoots it as it falls] I knew it, I knew it all the time! Oh, we're gonna' take that gold, and we're gonna' take ALL of it. And you and your tales of old timers don't mean a whiff of cow dung, because you never had the brains or the guts to do it. We're gonna' take it from the INside.\n\nErwin Ward:\n\n[Slightly incredulous] The INside?"
