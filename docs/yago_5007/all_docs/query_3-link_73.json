        "text": "He played the character, ‘Sergeant Chip Saunders’ on ‘COMBAT+ACE,’ television’s longest running WWII drama, which ran on ABC from 1962 through 1967. Vic Morrow died on July 23, 1982 while filming a scene for ‘Twilight Zone: The Movie.’ He was wading across the Santa Clara River carrying two Vietnamese children (actor My-ca Dinh Le and actress Renee Shin-Ye Chen) when a helicopter being used on the set spun out of control and crashed, decapitating Morrow and one of the children and crushing the other. The six occupants inside the helicopter sustained minor injuries. The accident led to massive reforms in U.S. child labor laws and safety regulations on movie sets in California. Buried at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City. Vic Morrow was the father of actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, who, as his epitaph says, ‘I loved him as ‘Dad’ to everyone else he was ‘Vic.’\n\nTicket Notice\n\nThis film has been out for longer than two weeks, and it is no longer being sold online. However, you can pick up tickets for this showtime in person at the box office."
