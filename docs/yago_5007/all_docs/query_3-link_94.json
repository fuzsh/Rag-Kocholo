        "text": "HOLLYWOOD -- The helicopter crash that killed actor Vic Morrow and two Vietnamese child actors was an eerie tragedy made all the more macabre by its resemblance to the sinister motion picture being filmed.\n\nAs so often happened in episodes of the spine-chilling television series 'The Twilight Zone,' the Friday accident on the set of the motion picture of the same name was preceeded by a premonition.\n\n'I had a premonition before we left,' said Randall Robinson, 35, an assistant cameraman who survived the helicopter crash. 'We'd been shooting earlier and got pretty hot heat from one of the fireballs.\n\n'I was also concerned because after I asked about the first explosion, they said it was just beginning and the rest would be stronger.\n\n'We got blown out of the sky. I could see a fireball surrounding the helicopter. The first one was so bad, I turned to leave. The second knocked us on our side and the third blast that hit us was under the tail rotor.'\n\nRemote controlled gasoline bombs were planted in the riverside movie set to simulate the explosions caused by attacking soldiers. Witnesses said the explosions blew rocks and dirt clods into the rotors, causing the chopper tn go out of control and crash.\n\nThe main rotor slashed into Morrow and the children and decapitated them.\n\n'I saw the copter blowing up the village,' said lighting technician Mike Corbett, who witnessed the accident from about 200 feet away. 'First one of the fireball gasoline bombs went off and I heard a brief explosion blow off the rotor. Then the copter went out of control.'\n\nFilming of the Vietnam War scene, the first of four episodes of 'The Twilight Zone,' was nearly complete when the accident happened about 2:30 a.m. PDT. The 'wrap' party celebrating the end of shooting was to have been held Sunday.\n\nRobert Gaynor, a camera crane operator, was working at riverside when the accident occurred.\n\n'The entire operation took only a few seconds,' he said. 'The cameras rolled and the helicopter was hovering. It was supposed to 'destroy' the village. Vic Morrow was supposed to run across the river with the two children -- to save them.\n\n'As the helicopter went out of control, he was running... and the helicopter spun down and met Vic Morrow at the water level.'"
