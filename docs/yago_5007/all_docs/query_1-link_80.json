        "text": "Movie Web\n\nBy Soniya Hinduja\n\n6/8/2024\n\nWhen Western movies became popular in America, directors and screenwriters in Europe began to take notice and were immediately drawn by their potential. Through the use of atmospheric locations and lower production budgets, a new sub-genre was born – the spaghetti western. These movies had their own unique European flair. They centered around outlaws and cowboys and morally ambiguous takes set against the backdrop of sun-baked landscapes of Spain and Italy.\n\nThere are certain definitive traits to spaghetti Westerns. For one, they are almost always Italian productions, shown in native languages, and made by directors like Sergio Leone. As for the style, these filmmakers favor elongated shots, extreme closeups during confrontations, and an iconic score composed by Ennio Morricone. Additionally, spaghetti westerns also portray the Wild West in a grittier tone and use graphic violence.\n\nWhich is why it is no surprise that many spaghetti westerns are R-rated. For their raw and adult-oriented content, these movies stand tall among the most legendary entries in the genre and continue to inspire and influence filmmakers across the world. Here is a list that counts down the Best R-rated spaghetti westerns and celebrates the more nihilistic and haunting vision of the frontier - when it comes to Europe.\n\nThe Dollars Trilogy (1964-1966)\n\nClint Eastwood first broke out as the “Man With No Name” in the first film of the Dollars Trilogy, A Fistful of Dollars. The gritty and morally ambiguous take on a drifter exploiting a violent rivalry between two criminal gangs in a small town in Mexico reinvented the western genre.\n\nDespite only being loosely connected, the next movie, For a Few Dollars More, saw Eastwood chasing a criminal, El Indio, with the help of a Colonel. The trilogy concluded in style with The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, where three men compete to find a buried treasure during the height of the American Civil War.\n\nA Revolution in the Frontier\n\nEach of these movies had a distinct element that made them utterly unforgettable. From featuring a phenomenal turn from Eli Wallach to twisting conventions of the genre, the Man With No Name trilogy elevated the portrayal of the Wild West to high art and influenced filmmakers across the world.\n\nUnder the sublime direction of Sergio Leone, the films featured elongated shots, an almost-silent protagonist, a swelling score composed by Ennio Morricone, and poetic themes of greed and violence. Overall, the Dollars Trilogy defines the genre more than any other title. Stream on Max.\n\nFace to Face (1967)\n\nIn director Sergio Sollima’s sequel to The Big Gundown, we follow a mild-mannered university professor named Brad Fletcher who retires from his job and travels to Texas. On a stagecoach journey, he has a chance encounter with a criminal, Solomon “Beauregard” Bennet. As the two men escape the violence that ensues, they end up forming an unlikely alliance, where Fletcher rises in ranks and becomes the leader of an outlaw gang. As opposed to his values of non-violence, Fletcher transforms into a ruthless man.\n\nA Gripping Psychological Drama\n\nBreaking from the traditional western storyline focused on shootouts and bandits, Face to Face immerses viewers into a game of psychological manipulation and clever deception. Gian Maria Volonté delivers an unsettling performance as a conceited and unhinged Fletcher seeking only control. But Face to Face was truly known for Sollima’s taut direction and deconstruction of predetermined notions about humanity. Paired with supporting roles from Tomás Milián, Jolanda Modio, and more, the movie is a must-watch.\n\nDeath Rides a Horse (1967)\n\nAs a young boy, Bill witnessed his family being brutally abused and murdered at the hands of a gang. Fifteen years later, Bill has grown into a skilled marksman with a gun of his own, and his only motive is to seek revenge. He begins to coldly track down each member of the gang, hoping to recognize them with his memory. Along the way, he stumbles into Ryan, a gunslinger released from prison, who was also wronged by the same men who murdered Bill's family.\n\nHas a Tone of Revenge and Redemption\n\nDeath Rides a Horse is Giulio Petroni’s harrowing and hallucinating masterpiece of the Old West. Lee Van Cleef infuses the vengeful gunslinger with complexity, leaving the viewers wondering – is he an unremorseful killer or is he just a man yearning to be understood?\n\nJohn Phillip Law is equally outstanding as Bill. The movie features a haunting score and bitter gunfights, elevating the genre to intense and incredible heights. In a way, it is a near perfect genre film that allows Van Cleef to showcase the full range of his talents. Stream on Prime Video.\n\nFind a Place to Die (1968)\n\nA remake of Henry Hathaway’s 1954 western Garden of Evil, this unsentimental and action-infused story centers around a beautiful woman who hires a group of five men to help save her husband get out of a gold mine which is controlled by the violent and formidable bandits led by Chato.\n\nWhat she does not know is that the men are associated with Chato in some way or the other, and their true intentions are to get Chato’s gold as well as the woman for themselves. Over several breathless days, we witness action and bullet wounds and clever maneuvers.\n\nA Masterclass in Survival and Betrayal\n\nDirected by Giuliano Carnimeo, Find a Place to Die is a gripping story of betrayal and survival in a world where trust is a luxury only few can afford. Despite having the good ol’ gold hunting trope, the solid performances from Jeffrey Hunter, Piero Lulli and Pascale Petit make even the most obscure details turn entertaining and adventurous.\n\nThe depiction of rugged mountainous terrain and crumbling Spanish architecture reflects the moral decay and proves that Carnimeo has an eye for birthing greed and turbulence from his setting. Stream on The Roku Channel.\n\nCompañeros (1970)\n\nCompañeros is set in revolutionary Mexico, where a wanted outlaw Yodlaf Peterson, a Swedish mercenary, and his reluctant companion, as they arrive in the small town of San Bernardino and realize that it is being controlled by the self-appointed General Mongo, who seeks to gain all the town’s fortune for himself. Peterson, who was supposed to sell arms to Mongo, then reveals a secret motive for his own. Along the way, the movie also introduces a bunch of misadventures.\n\nInfused with Buddy Comedy Tropes\n\nWhat made Compañeros reverberate is the movie’s ability to intricately balance the impulses of lived-in experiences with the subtle humor of the buddy comedy genre. Charismatic stars Franco Nero, Tomás Milián, and Jack Palance personify the tale with their hilarious turns as the main characters.\n\nPair Sergio Corbucci’s genuinely entertaining direction with superb location work, a witty script full of verbal ambushes, and a moving score by Ennio Morricone, and what you get is a one-of-a-kind spaghetti western. Stream on Tubi TV.\n\nA Man Called Sledge (1970)\n\nCo-written and directed by Vic Morrow along with Giorgio Gentili, this spaghetti western transports you to the lawless Mexican borderlands. The main character, Luther Sledge, is played by James Garner. He is a lone gunslinger who makes his living tracking outlaws with cold detachment. When a quiet night leads to two murders and a chance encounter, Sledge finds himself developing a plan to steal gold from a vault by posing as a prisoner.\n\nJames Garner’s Darkest Work of His Career\n\nGarner, who did not regret having done the film, made sure to once mention that A Man Called Sledge was among the heaviest roles he’d ever played, calling the movie “not suitable for consumption” as a whole.\n\nHis intensely physical performance of a solitary and emotionally guarded gunman enhanced the script. From the bleak and atmospheric duel between two men to the breathtaking final showdown, certain scenes in the movie are impactful even today. Stream on Plex.\n\nThe Grand Duel (1972)\n\nBefore his feature directorial debut, Giancarlo Santi had worked as an assistant to Sergio Leone, working closely on projects like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West. Drawing from the same experience, with The Grand Duel, he tells the story of a sheriff named Clayton who arrives in Saxton city to keep a fragile peace. But Philip Wermeer, a man accused of the murder of the Patriarch, gets in his way and the town becomes ripe with violence and betrayal.\n\nPitch Perfect Use of Tension and Guns\n\nAs one would expect, Santi creates one of the greatest of all spaghetti westerns by using slow-burn chills, little dialogue, and amazing gun play. In the hands of Lee Van Cleef, who is at his conflicted best as Sheriff Clayton, the movie portrays a world where murder and corruption are used as currency.\n\nOpting for entertainment over precision or volume of shots, each scene delivers enough heart and humor to keep viewers invested. And when the climactic showdown happens, it is simply beautiful. Stream on The Roku Channel.\n\nKeoma (1976)\n\nAfter the tense days of the American Civil War, the half-white, half-Indian gunfighter Keoma Shannon returns to his hometown on the frontier only to find out that it is controlled by a gang of outlaws. His three half-brothers have formed an alliance with their leader, the evil Caldwell, imprisons people and brutally tyrannizes the town’s residents. Vowing to exact revenge, Keoma launches a war against the gang with the help of his father and a former friend.\n\nPoignant and Fascinating\n\nReleased at the tail end of the era of Spaghetti Westerns, Keoma is one of the most authentic movies in the genre.\n\nWriter-director Enzo G. Castellari crafts a movie so poignant and culturally significant that you almost end up looking past the mesmerizing shots of wide vistas and peek right into the main character’s personal odyssey. Franco Nero’s charming and conflicted hero explores existential themes of belonging and was often visited by a strange apparition, which acts as a unique and remarkable parable of human struggles. Stream on Tubi TV.\n\nChina 9, Liberty 37 (1978)\n\nStarring Fabio Testi, Warren Oates, and Jenny Agutter, China 9, Liberty 37 is an interesting spaghetti western featuring a love triangle. An efficient gunslinger, Clayton Drumm, is about to be hanged, but he receives an unlikely assignment in exchange for his life – to kill Matthew Sebanek, a rancher who refuses to sell his land to the railroad. When Clayton defaults, has an affair with Sebanek’s wife, Catherine, and is on the run with her, Sebanek teams up with the railroad and both parties chase the couple.\n\nAn Underrated Western Landmark\n\nA delight for fans of Monte Hellman’s western, China 9, Liberty 37 breaks the mold by giving its key characters different motives. The movie also helped launch the international careers of Agutter, who then came to be known as an independent heroine with unmatched skills.\n\nHellman also brought the panoramic vistas of Spain and Italy by choosing to film on location and guiding cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno. The action sequences and the ultimate resolution of the story are particularly worth praising. Stream on Pluto TV.\n\n800 Bullets (2002)\n\nIn 800 Bullets, we follow Julián Torralba, a former stuntman who made a living by appearing in American Westerns shot in Spain. Now an old man, he resorts to small performances. After his son, who was also a stuntman, passes away, Julián is estranged from his grandson, Carlos. The more Carlos learns about his father, the more fascinated he is by Julián. Soon, Carlos joins Julián. When his mother tries to take him back, a hardened Carlos and the other cowboys fight back.\n\nPays Homage to Spaghetti Roots\n\nA loving homage to the era of grisly and shocking spaghetti westerns, Álex de la Iglesia's 800 Bullets had all the hallmarks – stylized and well-choreographed shootouts with over-the-top special effects, a Tarantino-esque script laden with dark humor and family drama, and genuinely masterful performances from leads Sancho Gracia and Carmen Maura.\n\nWhile offering a glimpse into the past, he also pushed the boundaries of on-screen violence. With a decent-enough script and a tragic ending, the movie celebrates the subgenre’s unforgettable legacy."
