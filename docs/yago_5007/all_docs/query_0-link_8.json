        "text": "This was a huge letdown until it wasn't. I'm an unapologetic Garner head so I had high hopes and starting out there were enough interesting cinematic flourishes that it had me thinking this might be a forgotten Spaghetti Western masterpiece. The story has a great premise but the tone felt like odds and ends from a ton of other westerns and those parts weren't always compatible making for a bumpy and uneven ride.\n\nInterestingly, this was co-written and co-directed by Vic Morrow, Jennifer Jason Leigh's father and an actor more notorious for how he died than the solid resume of work he compiled. It certainly seems like a case of too many cooks as A Man Called Sledge swings wildly…\n\nSavage, ornery, and beautiful indeed. But surely there is more to A Man Called Sledge than its tagline, right? I would say so, in that although the plot isn't anything out of the ordinary, the narrative never strays from it, so there is plenty of focus on the characters' pursuit of gold as well as the lengths they go to to secure it, such as a prison break that involves dynamite and rioting prisoners. It is one of the most chaotic scenes, and it doesn't hurt that Sledge and his gang are no strangers when it comes to shaking things up. I wouldn't say that the aforementioned scene is particularly memorable, but it isn't without its fair share of excitement…\n\nHalf-hearted attempt by the ubiquitous Dino De Laurentiis to produce a Leone-style spaghetti western comes out more Chef Boy-Ar-Dee. He gets the idiosyncratic soundtrack okay, but he guilds that lily with one of those idiotic songs that tell the story of the movie that were usually sung (and thereby party redeemed) by Frankie Laine, but presumably this one was even too dumb for Frankie to take on. He enlists a sturdy American star, James Garner, and films on the same locations in Spain, but he entrusts the writing and directing to the noted auteur Vic Morrow. It begins promisingly enough opening in a rare-for-westerners snowbound landscape before moving abruptly and without explanation (at least that I caught, though to be…"
