        "text": "VIC MORROW\n\nSigned report and estimate of his income as a director\n\nDocument signed: \"Vic Morrow\", 1 page, 8½x11. Los Angeles, California, 1968 December 19. Annual Filing required by the By-Laws of the Directors Guild of America. Morrow fills in his Los Angeles address and reports $5,711.72 in earnings from directing in 1968. He estimates $10,000 income of this type in 1969. Vic Morrow (1932-1982) is a film and television actor, most notable for dying on set during the production of Twilight Zone: The Movie. Originally studying law using the G.I. Bill after leaving the Navy, Morrow took an interest in acting after participating in a school play.He made his professional acting debut at the age of 22 in this film, The Blackboard Jungle, in which he played a muttering juvenile delinquent. The roles he took often saw him type casted as a heavy, but after refining his skills, he continued to pursue his career. Morrow, who starred in a number of feature films, was later seen as Sgt. Chip Saunders on Combat, which was telecast on ABC from 1962-1967, and was the longest-running of the several World War II dramas of the 1960s. Ironically, it was during the filming of a Vietnam War sequence in Twilight Zone: The Moviethat Morrow passed away following a stage accident. Morrow only directed one feature film, the Western A Man Called Sledge (1971). Multiple mailing folds. Ink stamp on front (not effecting signature).
