        "text": "A History of England: Principally in the Seventeenth Century by Leopold von Ranke\n\nGerman historian Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886) is well known for pioneering the modern historical method which advocates empiricism, rather than a focus on the philosophy of history. Emphasizing the importance of presenting history exactly as it happened, Ranke asserted that different eras need to be understood in their own contexts rather than in relation to each other: history should not be regarded as one long, teleological narrative. These principles of writing history, established in earlier publications, are all evident here. Originally published in eight volumes between 1859 and 1869, Ranke's history, 'principally in the seventeenth century', was first published as a six-volume history in English by the Clarendon Press in 1875, the mammoth task of its translation distributed among eight Oxford dons. Volume 5 focuses on William III, ending with the reigns of Anne, George I, and George II; an appendix gives source material from contemporary documents.\n\nBook XX.
