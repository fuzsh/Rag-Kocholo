        "text": "The option that is not correct about Leopold Von Ranke is he was the father of Romanticism.Key Points\n\nLeopold Von Ranke (1795-1886) was a German historian who is widely regarded as one of the founding fathers of modern historical scholarship.\n\nRanke played a significant role in establishing history as a respected academic discipline in the universities.\n\nRanke emphasized the importance of primary sources in historical research and argued that historians should rely on rigorous methodology in their work.\n\nHe believed that the role of the historian was to simply report the facts of the past, rather than impose their own subjective interpretations or judgments.\n\nThis approach is sometimes referred to as the \"historical method\" and it has been highly influential in the development of modern historiography.\n\nWhile Ranke was an important figure in 19th-century German intellectual life, he is not associated with Romanticism.\n\nIn fact, his approach to historical scholarship was often seen as a reaction against the Romantic emphasis on subjective experience and imagination.\n\nRanke's ideas were more closely aligned with the emerging scientific method and the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and empirical evidence.\n\nSo we can conclude that the option that is not correct about Leopold Von Ranke is he was the father of Romanticism.\n\n-> The UGC NET City Intimation Link has been released for the exam scheduled from 21st to 23rd August 2024.\n\n-> The re-exam for UGC NET June 2024 will be conducted in CBT Mode from 21st August to 4th September 2024.\n\n-> The UGC-NET exam takes place for more than 80 subjects, to determine the eligibility for 'Junior Research Fellowship’ and ‘Assistant Professor’ posts.\n\n-> The exam comprises two papers - Paper I and Paper II.
