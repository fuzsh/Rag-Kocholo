        "text": "September 18, 2012\n\nThe guy is the father of modern historical study, and he really isn't that bad to read either, but I can't pretend that I had tons of fun with this. Ranke was really only interested in \"the Latin and Germanic nations\" and the interplay between the various states of Europe in the 1500s and 1600s and 1700s. I'm sure he was interested in the 1800s too, but he doesn't seem to have written about that era too much (it was his own era, after all). Ranke has a funny way of disavowing all subjectivity, writing about how he wants to tell history \"as it actually happened,\" from an objective perspective, while at the same time admitting that he is very close with the King of Prussia and the King of Bavaria and they are his generous lords and patrons, etc etc. Tons of Prussia boosterism strewn throughout his work. He also believed that states won wars when they had a greater accumulation of \"moral energies\" on their side. Seems a bit out of date, and yet, not all that different from that strain of American historiography that believes the United States is divinely inspired and guided to special greatness by God's providence. If you substituted the US for Prussia and George Washington for Frederick the Great in Ranke's work, it might seem pretty familiar.\n\nThis kind of old fashioned \"great man\" history can be fun to read at times. Ranke has a nice poetically embroidered flow to his history. He is more than willing to work in personality traits of these kings and popes that may or may not be true but are certainly entertaining. This collection also includes a very modern-sounding smack down of an earlier historian's work on Italy, in which Ranke points out plagiarism, repetition, digressions, outright invention- this is fun to read as well."
