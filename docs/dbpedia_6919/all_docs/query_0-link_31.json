        "text": "The Prussian historian Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886) enjoys the elevated status of a founding father of the historical discipline. Already during his lifetime, this image spread beyond German borders. Historians in Great Britain and the United States, but also Hungary, China and Japan, began to imagine themselves as working in a Rankean tradition.Footnote 1 However, chroniclers of Ranke's legacy soon noticed a growing gap between, on the one hand, the exaltation of the figure of Ranke and a small number of tenets associated with his method, and, on the other, the actual intellectual impact of his works. Already in in 1913, the German historian Friedrich Meinecke commented that Ranke had become “something entirely new, a great phenomenon in the history of ideas.”Footnote 2 The influential historian of historiography Georg Iggers later claimed in a similar vein that “what Ranke had thought, was, in a sense, less important to the development of historiography than was the image of Ranke in the historian's mind,” and concluded that he “possessed less influence as a great historian than as embodiment of a norm to be accepted or rejected.”Footnote 3\n\nTaking Iggers's assessment as a point of departure, this article reconsiders Ranke's role in the development of historical scholarship in late nineteenth-century Japan. While the literature in English and German so far has upheld the claim of a substantial intellectual impact of Rankean historiography on Japanese historians, this article will show that there is indeed very little evidence for this, but that the short outburst of interest in Ranke around 1900, which will be called a “Rankean moment” here, is instead best read as emerging from a concern with norms and virtues of scholarly practice that had little to do with Ranke per se.\n\nIn recent years, historians of knowledge such as Lorraine Daston, Otto Sibum and Herman Paul have developed the concept of the scholarly persona in order to elaborate the notion of scientists and scholars such as Ranke acting as an embodiment of norms. They understand personae as abstract models of good scholarship that mediate between the level of the individual scholar and institutions of knowledge production. In their view, personae bundle traits, skills and virtues into repertoires and identities that a scholar must learn, embody and perform to be accepted as a legitimate member of a scholarly community.Footnote 4 Personae are never singular or uncontested but compete for attention and relevance in a given institution, discipline or national academic culture. They need not necessarily be personalized or even labeled, as they permeate both the discourses and practices of a given community: a historian might laud the diligence of a colleague in an obituary, make a remark at a conference about a research approach being too political, or demand more rigor when reviewing a journal article. But there are also times when models will be debated more systematically, especially in periods of intense institutional and intellectual change. They might be condensed into archetypes like the Naturforscher, the philologist or, in recent times, the academic manager. Sometimes, individual scholars whose scholarly conduct is perceived as exemplary are also elevated to a persona in a metonymical move where the traits of the person are generalized into an ideal type, as when claiming that someone converted from “Hegel” to “Ranke.”Footnote 5 In these instances, the invocation of a name or a visual cue such as a portrait can serve as a shorthand for an entire approach to scholarship.\n\nNaturally, instead of a wholesale acceptance of a prepackaged Ranke, scholarly communities were free to highlight different aspects of his work, method and conduct and thus assemble multiple personae out of the wealth of one scholarly life. Carrying forward recent efforts to expand the study of scholarly personae beyond the German context, this article, then, explores how Japanese historians around the turn of the twentieth century went about fashioning “their” version of Ranke.Footnote 6\n\nReconsidering the notion of “Rankean historiography” in Japan\n\nThis essay does not attempt to draw a complete picture of Ranke in Japan. Its starting point is a curious disparity: while Euro-American surveys of Japanese history writing in the nineteenth century have made strong claims about the impact of Rankean historiography, so far no attempt has been made to corroborate a substantial intellectual link between Ranke and Japanese historians. This introductory section discusses evidence that casts doubt on the presence of such a substantial link and introduces the particularities of the “Rankean moment” as an opportunity to rethink the notion of Rankean historiography through the lens of the scholarly persona.\n\nWhat are meant by “substantial” here are the usual signs of intellectual engagement: first and foremost written output by historians reflecting on or influenced by Ranke's ideas and scholarship, attention to a variety of his publications and aspects of his work, translations and editions of his publications, and a sustained dialogue after initial contact. In post-1887 Japan, the year that is given as a starting date for Rankean historiography in Japan in the literature, none of these ingredients are present.\n\nEuro-American accounts have asserted for decades that Ranke's methods were introduced to the archipelago by his disciple Ludwig Riess (1861–1928), who served as professor of Western history at the Imperial University in Tokyo from 1887 to 1902.Footnote 7 The impact, we are told even in such recent accounts as Daniel Woolf's magisterial “Global History of History,” was dramatic: “Any residual Chinese traditional influences on historiography were soon overwhelmed by Western scholarship … Germany became the admired model.”Footnote 8 Yet, given the fact that Rankean thought is said to have entered Japan through Riess, it is remarkable how Riess is clearly of no intrinsic interest in these accounts. He is rarely introduced without the epithet “a disciple of Ranke,” even though he had no more than a supporting role as scribe in the production of Ranke's late magnum opus on world history and supposedly conversed directly with the master only on two occasions.Footnote 9 More often than not, Riess's name is even misspelled or his relation to Ranke otherwise misrepresented.Footnote 10 In other words, the emphasis is clearly on Ranke, not on Riess.\n\nMoreover, even a cursory review proves Ranke to be of much less concern to Riess's work in Tokyo than these accounts suggest. We know that Riess patterned his first lecture on world history after the structure of Ranke's eponymous magnum opus and continued to give the intermittent Ranke-related class.Footnote 11 The notes to his lecture on the methodology of history give examples from Ranke's work, alongside that of numerous other historians from Johann Gustav Droysen and Henry Hallam to Bernard de Fontenelle.Footnote 12 And one of Riess's students, Murakawa Kengo (1875–1946), later claimed that he “most enjoyed reading Ranke, adored his method of study, frequently quoted Ranke's works in his lectures and exercises at the university and thereby let us students appreciate Ranke's great historical knowledge.”Footnote 13 Likely, then, his students in Western, i.e. European and American, history in the 1890s were exposed to Ranke's name and status as an eminent historian in Europe, and perhaps also to some methodological principles and topics of his major works.\n\nYet, in Riess's publications and exchanges with his Japanese colleagues, Ranke barely featured at all. In his first contribution to the newly established Japanese Historical Journal in 1890, he duly invoked him as a “great authority,” but without giving further details.Footnote 14 In a biographical article for the Historical Journal six years later, Riess commemorated Ranke's successor at the university in Berlin, Heinrich von Treitschke, who had passed away earlier that year; he never penned a comparable article on Ranke.Footnote 15 In 1901, right in the middle of the Rankean moment, in a letter to his former teacher, Hans Delbrück, in Berlin, he even openly mocked the notion of a Rankean school of historiography proposed by German historians Kurt Breysig and Karl Lamprecht as a “fairytale.”Footnote 16\n\nWhat this suggests is that Riess should perhaps only be called a “Rankean” in the sense that he had studied in Berlin under Ranke's successors, who “continued the tradition” of “historical methods taught by Ranke.”Footnote 17 This, however, is precisely the kind of ascription that blurs the distinction between Ranke's research and methodology and Ranke as a persona which is at issue here. For good reason, then, Japanese accounts, while giving full credit to Riess's presence, are much more hesitant to mention Ranke's name, much less assert a transformative Rankean impact on Japanese historiography.Footnote 18\n\nIf many of the survey articles are rather indifferent about Riess, they show even less concern for the Japanese scholars that supposedly embraced Ranke: Riess's colleagues at the Imperial University, Tsuboi Kumezō (1858–1936) and Mitsukuri Genpachi (1862–1919), who were of roughly the same age and had both also studied in Germany, are hardly ever mentioned in survey texts.Footnote 19 In 1894, Tsuboi, lecturer in history since 1886 and Riess's colleague in the department of Western history since 1891, situated Ranke in an essay “On History” at the starting point of “pure [scientific] history” but did not explicate this theme any further.Footnote 20 This is the only context in which either of them mentioned Ranke before around the year 1900.\n\nDespite the alleged paradigm shift and Riess's invocations, it took Japanese historians quite some time to develop a more than passing interest in Ranke. When it finally materialized, Riess's tenure was already in its twelfth year and scholars had been studying various strands of Euro-American historiography for several decades. It was only around 1900 that Ranke rather abruptly acquired the status of a celebrity. Within the short span of four years, a heightened interest welled up in different venues of the emerging academic discipline. The flagship Historical Journal opened with a photographic portrait and a fervent eulogy, Japanese historians wrote articles on his method, and students of the Imperial University organized a symposium commemorating his life and achievements.\n\nThis phenomenon shall be called a “Rankean moment” here, for two reasons. First, it was intellectually circumscribed in the sense that it was mostly based on a rather superficial familiarity with Ranke's thought and oeuvre: statements about Ranke's stature in Germany and Europe known to and eventually reproduced by Tsuboi, Riess and Mitsukuri, and references to the first lecture of Ranke's “On the Epochs of Modern History” and the preface written by his publisher, Alfred Dove. Second, it ended as abruptly as it began. Only after a considerable hiatus were further articles on Ranke's thought and the first Japanese translation of one of his works published.Footnote 21 The most significant contribution on Ranke's thought before 1945, Kyoto University historian Suzuki Shigetaka's treatise on Ranke's view of world history, published roughly four decades later, did not even acknowledge the discussions of the Rankean moment, even though these were centrally concerned with Ranke as a world historian.Footnote 22\n\nWhile both the lack of evidence for previous engagement and the nature of the Rankean moment are hard to reconcile with earlier accounts of Ranke's impact in Japan, the notion of the scholarly persona offers a different explanation. By shifting the focus away from intellectual lineages and towards models of scholarly virtue, it allows us to conceptualize the Rankean moment as a culmination of the search for models of the good historian that had occupied Japanese scholars since the late 1870s.\n\nThe transformation of historical scholarship and the search for models\n\nEven before Ludwig Riess arrived in Tokyo, history writing in Japan had long been a “crowded discursive field.”Footnote 23 Already the last decades of the 1700s saw a surging interest in national history, an import of new methodologies of evidential scholarship from China, and an intensification of what might be termed Western area studies.Footnote 24 In the mid-nineteenth century, history became a means to make sense of the escalating internal and external political crisis and discuss the future form of the Japanese polity.Footnote 25 With the opening of the ports after 1854, Japanese intellectuals intensified their studies and translation efforts of Western historical works. They were especially intrigued by the civilizational histories in the style of François Guizot and Henry Thomas Buckle, as the idea of the progress of civilization afforded them a new understanding of Japan's political trajectory and place in the world.Footnote 26 While not historical writing per se, Herbert Spencer's publications and his social Darwinist views of human development were also widely absorbed by Japanese intellectuals.Footnote 27\n\nThe broader cultural and political changes of the Meiji period (1868–1912) shook up received notions of the purpose of history writing and its position in the wider field of scholarship. On the institutional level, history had not been a clearly delineated field of learning in the Tokugawa period (1600–1868)—boundaries between history and philology, literature, morality and politics were often vague. At the forerunner of the Imperial University in Tokyo, for example, history was taught as part of the English, law and philosophy curricula as well as in courses in Japanese and Chinese classics. Dedicated historical departments were only set up from the late 1880s: the History Department, where Ludwig Riess was appointed first professor, was created in 1887; the Historiographical Office, which had been tasked with an official dynastic history by the Meiji government, was attached to the university as the Historiographical Institute in 1889, with a dedicated department for national history being added the following year and a unit for history and geography, which in practice focused on European and American history, in 1891; Chinese history was formally separated from literature and language studies even later, in the years between 1897 and 1910, when it merged into the department for oriental history.Footnote 28\n\nThe new institutional frameworks engendered by the extensive reform programs of the Meiji government made it necessary to reflect on new models of scholarship. Scholars who had been socialized to follow the model of the Confucian scholar-official, the dominant persona of the Tokugawa period, were abruptly turned into professional historians working in the context of university departments based on notions of academic disciplines that had not previously existed in this form in Japan.Footnote 29 How to fill out the new institutional role of the professional academic historian consequently became a central task for this generation of scholars.\n\nOne early attempt to find new models was carried out by the Historiographical Office. In 1879, it commissioned the Hungarian scholar Gustav Zerffi to produce a survey of European historiographical traditions.Footnote 30 His instructions were couched in a language of traits and virtues that is a key feature of scholarly personae: to state “the personal qualifications necessary in a historian”; to “enumerate those great authors who, by the common consent of mankind, have realized the ideal of what a Historian should be; and show, how the Historian of the present day should familiarize himself with the principles which guided them, and with the methods which they followed, if he himself too should desire to attain similar excellence.” Zerffi was explicitly told to “enumerate and criticize the greatest modern Historians, whether English, French, or German &c.”Footnote 31 And so he did, allotting about a 150 pages to the recent centuries of European historiography. Ranke appeared only in passing, in a row with other influential German historians such as Barthold Georg Niebuhr, Theodor Mommsen and Heinrich von Sybel.Footnote 32 The result did not turn out to be what the institute expected, however, as Zerffi had focused on the philosophy of history and ancient Greek authors at the expense of contemporary standards and exemplars of the discipline, and ended up having only limited impact on subsequent debates.Footnote 33\n\nSuch debates proliferated in the following years, as the new class of professional academic historians attempted to define their role and purpose, discussing scholarly virtues like impartiality, diligent textual criticism or the emancipation of history from Confucian notions of morality.Footnote 34 As these discussions were centrally about professional disciplinary virtues in history writing, they were led freely across the emerging, but still vague, geographical subfields of national, Western and oriental history, as evidenced by the term akademizumu (“academism”) that Japanese historians retroactively applied to the mainstream of academic pre-World War II history.Footnote 35\n\nConcurrently with the establishment of an academic historiography, there emerged a group of popular history writers, often called Min'yūsha historians after the platform and publishing house of the same name, who consciously defined the purpose of history in opposition to the new disciplinary standards. Just as academic historians employed virtue language to distinguish “‘professionals’ from ‘amateurs’” and discredit the latter as “pseudo-historians,”Footnote 36 these writers attacked their academic counterparts for having traded vitality and relevance for rigor and accuracy in their pursuit of historical facts.Footnote 37 Instead they cherished Buckle, Guizot and Spencer and their notions of “laws” and “principles” in history.Footnote 38 As with these authors, history for the Min'yūsha historians linked up with politics as they construed such laws to guide societies along a historical path to ever greater freedom and progress.\n\nIt is not surprising, then, that they found a model of the exemplary historian in the British politician and paradigmatic Whig historian Thomas Macaulay (1800–59). The popular history journal Shikai featured a biographical sketch of Macaulay in 1892, and one of the Min'yūsha historians, Takekoshi Yosaburō, published a longer stand-alone biography a year later.Footnote 39 For Takekoshi, the most outstanding virtues of Macaulay were his lively and absorbing narrative style and the fact that he brought to bear his insight as a statesman on his writing.Footnote 40 The opposition between academic and popular approaches to history writing around 1890 is mirrored in the way their respective proponents discussed scholarly virtues: while the Min'yūsha writers favored biography and a persona based on an individual historian, the academic historians at that time preferred theoretical reflection on abstract virtues. It was only once the new institutional forms had taken root, around the turn of the century, that academic historians unexpectedly discovered a comparable human vessel that could personify the ideal constellation of virtues that they had been pursuing—in Leopold von Ranke.\n\nA Japanese Ranke for a global discipline\n\nIn absence of previous substantial research into the Japanese encounter with Ranke, it is quite clear that the frequent, almost obstinate, reference to the German historian in earlier European and American accounts was more than anything a Eurocentric discursive device that served to assert and establish both the connection of Japanese historical scholarship to its “modern” origin in the West and its derivative character. The concept of the scholarly persona has proven helpful in cutting through this undue focus on Western origins by shifting the conversation to Japanese concerns about epistemic virtues. In breaking down Ranke into a constellation of traits, the concept of the persona allowed us to sidestep simplistic “developmental models” and see how these traits matched concerns with scholarly conduct and priorities that had occupied Japanese historians long before they discovered Ranke.Footnote 102 It was precisely this mix-and-match approach as an act of cultural translation that enabled the adoption of a Rankean persona in Japan. In their survey of the global history of historiography, Georg Iggers and Edward Wang thus rightly stress the agency of Japanese scholars: “the Japanese tradition of historical study was thus reformed and transformed via a cross-cultural exchange … In Riess's presentation of and his Japanese audience's perception of Ranke, this German master's image experienced a metamorphosis.”Footnote 103\n\nAs we have seen, Japanese historians had a rather circumscribed agenda. Considering the concrete timing of their rendezvous with Ranke from 1899 to 1903 and the aspects of his persona they highlighted the most, the reason for the Rankean moment comes into relief. He received attention at the specific juncture when historical scholarship was coalescing into a global academic profession.Footnote 104 This is how most Japanese historians experienced it, starting with Shigeno Yasutsugu, who had declared his conviction that “scholarship around the world has at last switched onto the same track” already in 1890.Footnote 105 A globalizing discipline needed a minimal global standard, and Ranke's image proved malleable enough to serve as a blueprint persona even in Japan. What made him attractive and relevant as a model researcher there was not his method of source criticism or his impartiality, but his global outlook. Its aspiration for global validity was one of the reasons Japanese intellectuals had sought out Western science to begin with, and Ranke gave it a face."
