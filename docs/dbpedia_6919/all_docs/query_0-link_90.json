Leopold von Ranke (1795 1886) was a German historian and a founder of modern source-based history. According to Caroline Hoefferle, \"Ranke was probably the most important historian to shape [the] historical profession as it emerged in Europe and the United States in the late 19th century.\" He was able to implement the seminar teaching method in his classroom and focused on archival research and analysis of historical documents. Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing, introducing such ideas as reliance on primary sources (empiricism), an emphasis on narrative history and especially international politics.In 1834 36 Ranke published The Popes of Rome, Their Church and State in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries(3 vols.). [a translation of the German title, the English title is used for this edition] As a Protestant, Ranke was barred from viewing the Vatican archives in Rome, but on the basis of private papers in Rome and Venice, he was able to explain the history of the papacy in the 16th century. In this book, Ranke coined the term the Counter Reformation, and offered colorful portrayals of Pope Paul IV, Ignatius of Loyola, and Pope Pius V. It contains the sentence: \"I see the time coming when we will base modern history no longer on secondhand reports, or even on contemporary historians, save where they had direct knowledge, and still less on works yet more distant from the period; but rather on eyewitness accounts and on the most genuine, the most immediate, sources.\" The papacy denounced Ranke's book as anti-Catholic, while many Protestants denounced it as not anti-Catholic enough, but he has been generally praised by historians for placing the situation of the Roman Catholic Church in the context of the 16th century and for his fair treatment of the complex interaction of the political and religious issues in that century. British Roman Catholic historian Lord Acton defended Ranke's book as the most fair-minded, balanced, and objective study ever written on the papacy of the 16th century.\"."
