        "text": "The 19 th century is being regarded as the golden age of facts. It's also the century that gave birth to history as an academic field of study. These significant feats were made possible through the works of German historians, notably Leopold von Ranke. Ranke made popular some thesis and theories in history which helped shape it as an academic field of study. His achievements also carved out a respectable profession out of history. The aim of this paper is to discuss these methods and teachings of Ranke and how they transformed the study of modern history. The paper adopts the thematic historical method of research with effective use of secondary and tertiary source of data collection.\n\nFrom 1827 to 1831 the German historian Leopold von Ranke travelled through Germany, Austria, and Italy, hunting for documents and archives. During this journey Ranke developed a new model for historical research that transformed the archive into the most important site for the production of historical knowledge. Within the archive, Ranke claimed, the trained historian could forget his personal predispositions and political loyalties, and write objective history. This essay critically examines Ranke's model for historical research through a study of the obstacles, frustrations, and joys that he encountered on his journey. It shows how Ranke's archival experiences inspired him to re-evaluate his own identity as a historian and as a human being, and investigates some of the affiliations between his model for historical research and the political realities of Prince Metternich's European order. Finally, the essay compares Ranke's historical discipline to other nineteenth-century disciplines, such as anthropology and archaeology.\n\nProfessional historians and the historiographical revolution 1960-1990 The use of the term \" professional historians \" has a conceptual aspect which is of importance. This aspect will be developed in the first part of this essay. In the second part the main objective is to connect a thoroughgoing change of historical writing in Western Europe and North America (apparently with wider ramifications) 1960-1990 with a change of historical professionalism. In the third part this change is related to the professional view of important history-writing, not only in Western Europe and North America but currently widely spread also in other parts of the world."
