        "text": "There is a story about Leopold von Ranke, the 19th-century German historian regarded as the father of modern ''professional'' history writing - that at the age of 91 he lay down on his pine bed and gently chided his amanuensis, Theodor Wiedemann, for having fallen asleep at his pen the night before. Ranke had been trying to finish dictating the eighth volume of his sweeping ''Universal History,'' which he had begun writing at the age of 82. But the eyes would not stay open and the ''Universal History'' would never be finished.\n\n''If your strength had only held out last night,'' the mummy-like Ranke told poor Wiedemann, ''we could have finished our work; it's spread out before me in panorama; but it is too late; I am weary.'' And the great Ranke soon died, taking his panorama with him into what he once imagined would be the great archives of heaven.\n\nThis happened in 1886, and because of the roundness of that anniversary -and also because Ranke's private library of more than 20,000 volumes ended up at Syracuse University - an international conference of scholars gathered here recently to talk about Ranke's place in the history of history.\n\nHistory as Science\n\nSome participants in the conference insisted, as people do at such events, that Ranke's spirit and beneficent influence were still very much alive. His name did not ring the great bells rung by Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and other thinkers and writers in German over the last century or so; and indeed Ranke is ''a name normally unknown in this world,'' one elderly German-born scholar confessed.\n\nYet in his field Ranke left a deep impression and became known to historians as ''the Master.'' For it was Ranke, in half a century's tenure at the University of Berlin, who spread the word through 54 volumes and many lectures and many students that history must be based on documents, that history is science as well as literature. The proper historian, in his view, is an academic trained and judged by other academics all dedicated to the collective enterprise of reconstructing ''what actually happened,'' as one of Ranke's famous dictums put it.\n\nThe gathering was also notable, however, for the doubts and cautions it raised. Peter Burke of Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge argued that the great Ranke was an influential reactionary rather than a creator of new intellectual forms.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
