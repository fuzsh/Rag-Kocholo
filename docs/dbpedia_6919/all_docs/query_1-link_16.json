        "text": "Biographical History\n\nLeopold von Ranke (1795-1886) was a German historian and historiographer. He was highly influential in shaping the modern approach to history, emphasizing such things as reliance on primary sources, narrative history and international politics. He rejected the idea that each era is by definition superior to those that preceded it, as well as the idea of sweeping historical theories that attempt to encompass huge swathes of time and geography.\n\nRanke's personal and professional library, consisting of more than 10,000 books, several hundred manuscripts and approximately 5 linear ft. of personal papers, was purchased for Syracuse University in 1887 and formed the nucleus of what is now the Syracuse University Special Collections Research Center (SCRC).\n\nTheodor Weidemann, whose bibliographic aids about the manuscripts are also included in the collection, was Ranke's amanuensis for the last fifteen years of his life.\n\nReturn to top\n\nScope and Contents of the Collection\n\nThe Leopold von Ranke Manuscript Collection consists of 104 bound manuscripts and 326 unbound manuscripts or parts of manuscripts. The largest single type consists of Venetian ambassadors' reports from the various capitals of Europe. There are also several Venetian chronicles, nuncios' reports to the pope, political documents from Tuscany, and a chronicle of Nuremberg.\n\nThe collection also contains research and reference material of various kinds about Ranke's library in general and about the manuscripts in particular. The bulk of this consists of extensive bibliographical notes compiled by Theodor Weidemann, Ranke's amanuensis for the last fifteen years of his life.\n\nReturn to top\n\nRestrictions\n\nAccess Restrictions\n\nThe majority of our archival and manuscript collections are housed offsite and require advanced notice for retrieval.
