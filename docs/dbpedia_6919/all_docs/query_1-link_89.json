        "text": "Leopold von Ranke, who was born in 1795, is considered to be one of the founders of the modern practice of writing history. This collection of his writings, edited and introduced by Georg G. Iggers, was first published in 1973 and remains the leading collection of Ranke’s writings in the English language.\n\nNow updated with the needs of current students in mind, this edition includes previously untranslated materials by the young Ranke, focusing particularly on the relationship between history and religion together with his inaugural lecture of 1836 ‘On the Relation and Difference between History and Politics’. Including pieces on historical science, and on the relationship between history and philosophy, as well as country specific histories, this book is essential reading for all students of historiography.\n\nBiography\n\nGeorg G. Iggers is Distinguished Professor of History Emeritus at the State University of New York at Buffalo. He has published numerous influential works on historiography including his co-authored Global History of Historiography (2008) and Twentieth Century Historiography (2005). He has received many fellowships including the Guggenheim, the Rockefeller, the Newberry Library and the National Endowment for the Humanities. He was also formerly a Fulbright fellow and a Woodrow Wilson Center fellow."
