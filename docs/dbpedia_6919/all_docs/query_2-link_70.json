        "text": "From 1827 to 1831 the German historian Leopold von Ranke travelled through Germany, Austria, and Italy, hunting for documents and archives. During this journey Ranke developed a new model for historical research that transformed the archive into the most important site for the production of historical knowledge. Within the archive, Ranke claimed, the trained historian could forget his personal predispositions and political loyalties, and write objective history. This essay critically examines Ranke's model for historical research through a study of the obstacles, frustrations, and joys that he encountered on his journey. It shows how Ranke's archival experiences inspired him to re-evaluate his own identity as a historian and as a human being, and investigates some of the affiliations between his model for historical research and the political realities of Prince Metternich's European order. Finally, the essay compares Ranke's historical discipline to other nineteenth-century disciplines, such as anthropology and archaeology.\n\nThis article describes the life and collection of the famous historian Leopold von Ranke, whose collection is now housed in the Syracuse University Special Collections. Von Ranke was instrumental in developing what he saw as the most objective form of history possible, adhering to primary sources and straying from moral judgments. The thousands of documents that make up the Ranke Library are an invaluable source for the study of history.\n\nThe historical science studies gained their modern form during the long twentieth century. The aim of this workshop is to explore the history of this field of study. The term “modern historical science studies” should be understood as a heuristic concept, which indicates a difference from more traditional forms of history of science. The reason behind the choice of this concept is that modern historical science studies are characterized by an interdisciplinary approach to the historical objects of the sciences, whereas more traditional history of science was mainly written as an experience-based reflection by representatives of the respective scientific disciplines themselves. For example, only from the late nineteenth and especially the twentieth century, social science approaches have played an increasingly important role in the historical reflection on the sciences. The contributions to the workshop focus on practices, the circulation processes of concepts, and individual representatives of different approaches to the history of science. Hereby, also the humanities are considered. Furthermore, a purely ‘western’ focus is to be avoided, and the historical science studies in Eastern Europe is to be equally taken into account.\n\nLanguage of virtue and vice such as used by nineteenth-century German historians offers a glimpse on an often neglected aspect of historical studies – that of dispositions, character traits, or virtues deemed necessary for pursuit of historical inquiry. The chapter shows that often-used phrases like “the first virtues of the historian” invoked hierarchical constellations of virtues corresponding to distinct conceptions of the historian’s vocation, which may be called scholarly personae. From this it follows that personae can be historicized: they need not be seen as a modern conceptual tool, but as modern names for schematic models of virtue that nineteenth-century historians themselves already invoked. The chapter also argues that such personae tended to be associated with outstanding historians and often came in contrastive pairs: Schlosser vs. Ranke, Waitz vs. Sybel, and Treitschke vs. Lamprecht. What these examples also illustrate is that pairs of personae could change over time, in tandem with changing debates over the historian’s vocation and the virtues it demanded."
