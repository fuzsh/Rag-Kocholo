        "text": "Each of our project members is assigned to one of the following Groups based on the results of their Y-DNA test. All of the members within a given Group except the last (\"Not Matched\") are shown by their Y-DNA test results to share a common patrilineal ancestor within a genealogical time frame (roughly 500 years).\n\nWithin each Group are biographies of its members' earliest known patrilineal ancestors. Numbers in italics at the end of each biography are the Kit (ID) numbers of the members who claim descendance from that ancestor (members' names are confidential). An example is the Craven County, North Carolina Group (the third group listed below). It has six ancestor biographies. Y-DNA testing shows that these six ancestors are related to each other, but they are listed separately because it was not known how they are connected.\n\nThe Andrew Jackson Willis of Alabama Group\n\nAndrew Jackson Willis of Alabama was born in 1815 in the Mississippi Territory and in 1818 moved by covered wagon to Franklin County, Alabama with his mother Mary (or Maria) and two siblings. His father is unknown at this time. He married Atimissa Sparks and had numerous children. He fought and was wounded at Gaines Mill in the Civil War while serving in the 26th Alabama Regiment. He died in 1880. (65516, 883587)\n\nThe Barnwell County, South Carolina Group\n\nRobert Willis of Williston, Barnwell County, South Carolina was born in 1772 and died in 1844 in Barnwell County. He had eleven children, including two sons who are ancestors of members of our project:\n\nJohn Turner Willis, born in 1798, died in 1841 in Barnwell County (383474)\n\nPatrick Vardell Willis (535848)\n\nThe Craven County, North Carolina Group\n\nJesse Willis of Georgia and Dale County, Alabama was born about 1810 in Georgia. He married Martha (last name unknown) and had two girls and a boy named Iverson Asbury Willis in Georgia before moving to Dale County, Alabama, where he was a farmer listed in the 1840, 1850, and 1860 censuses. His son Iverson Asbury Willis served in \"I\" Company, Alabama 33rd Infantry Regiment, in the Civil War and was killed on December 31, 1862 at the battle of Stone River at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. (60675)\n\n(Rev.) Joseph Willis of Craven County, North Carolina was born in the early 1700s and died in 1784 in Craven County. In his will he named six sons: Joseph, Thomas, Caleb, Richard, Jesse, and Ephraim. Project members who are descended from his sons are:\n\nThomas/Merrill/William Wesley (46443)\n\nCaleb/Richard Harvey/Moses W./John Tyler/Omer (59200)\n\nEphraim/Abner Sr./James S./John Hayes/James Porter/Cecil Ovil (239460)\n\nRichard Willis of North Carolina was born in 1720 and died in 1800 in North Carolina. According to family tradition, he is descended from one of seven \"brothers\" who emigrated from England in 1647 and settled in New York, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Virginia. His son Richard Jr. married Catherine Brighan. Richard Jr. lived in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Illinois. (N4693)\n\nRichard Willis Jr., husband of Martha, was imported to Middlesex, Virginia in 1699. A son of Richard Willis Jr. was James Willis, ancestor of three of our project members. James was born February 10,1716/17 in Virginia and died December 9, 1798 in Craven County, North Carolina. According to a Bible record, James’s children were John, William, Francis, Joshua, Joel Sr., Jacob, Joseph, and Isaac. James's son Joel Willis Sr., born May 4, 1752, is the ancestor of two members of our project. His son (1) William (son of Joel Sr.'s first wife, Amy) is the ancestor of project member 166363 through William Jasper Willis Jr., husband of Minerva Stafford. He was born August 11, 1815, and died August 5, 1887, near Barnesville, Upson County, Georgia. Joel Sr.'s son (2) Joel Jr. (son of Joel Sr.'s second wife, Sarah Gwaltney) is the ancestor of project member 931426, who is descended through William Willis, then down through Archibald Willis, and Leonard Appleton Willis. A published genealogy of the family, which includes the Bible record, isTwo Centuries with a Willis Family and Their Kin, by Douglas M. Willis (Dallas, 1963). (166383, 205636, and 931426)\n\nWilliam W. Willis of Pike County, Alabama, was born about 1794 in North Carolina. On September 27, 1813 during the War of 1812 he enlisted in the Militia in Baldwin County, Georgia, where he served until March 10, 1814. After the War, he married Elizabeth Middlebrook, who was born in Upson County, Georgia, on April 26/20, 1795. Later, the family moved to Pike County, Alabama, where William died May 7, 1874. Their known children were Frances (Willis) Pierson (1817-1888), James Monroe Willis, Thomas L. Willis, and William S. Willis. William W. Willis’s son James Monroe Willis was born March 27, 1819, in Georgia. He married Mahala Woodin November 1838 in Monroe County, Georgia. He died January 13, 1885, in Clay County, Alabama.William’s son Thomas L. Willis was born in Georgia on June 27, 1824. He received his medical education at the Medical College of Georgia, which he entered in 1849. On June 17, 1858, in Decatur County, Georgia, he married Letitia Barnett Hutchison, who was born December 8, 1828. Thomas died March 31, 1889, in Denton County, Texas. Their known children were Thomas Middlebrook Willis, Jessie Elizabeth (\"Bettie\") Willis, and John P. Willis. William’s son William S. Willis was born about 1829 in Georgia. He married Harriet E. Slappy and they had several children. He died about 1874 in Lee County, Alabama. Project members who are descended from sons of William W. are:\n\nJames Monroe/Jordan/Jonathan (283570)\n\nJames Monroe/Francis/Marion/Huron Branton (96147)\n\nThomas L. (718478)\n\nWilliam Alphus Willis was born in 1849 in Georgia and died in 1920. He lived in Drew County, Arkansas. (N40775)\n\nThe Gloucester County, Virginia Group\n\nFrancis Willis of Gloucester County, Virginia, husband of Sarah Lewis, was said to be born in 1666 in Ware Parish, Oxfordshire, England. Inferred from information in the will of an uncle, also named Francis, his father was Henry Willis, who was said to be born in England about 1638. Francis died before October 1692 in Gloucester County. His sons were (Col.) Francis Willis (b.abt.1690) and (Col.) Henry Willis (b.abt.1691). Col. Francis Willis married Ann Rich in 1715. Their children were Francis, John, and Mary. John (b.1719), the ancestor of one of our project members, married Mildred Smith and lived in Brunswick County, Virginia. The other son of Francis Willis of Gloucester County, Col. Henry Willis, lived in Fredericksburg, Virginia, which at that time was in Spotsylvania County. Project members descended from Henry include descendants of Byrd Charles Willis (husband of Mary Lewis) and William Champe Willis (husband of Lucy Taliaferro). Both Byrd Charles Willis and William Champe Willis are sons of Lewis Willis, who was a son of Henry Willis (born about 1696). Published genealogies of these families include A Sketch of the Willis Family of Virginia, by Byrd Charles Willis and Richard Henry Willis (1898) and A Sketch of the Willis Family, Fredericksburg Branch, by Byrd Charles Willis (1909). Project members who are descended from sons of Francis are:\n\nFrancis Jr./John/John/Augustine Euler (196495)\n\nHenry/Lewis/Byrd Charles(76114)\n\nHenry/Lewis/William Champe/John Whitaker (29851)\n\nThe Henry Willis of Washington County, Virginia Group\n\nHenry Willis of Washington County, Virginia was born about 1746. He is possibly a son of John Willis, born between 1710 and 1720 in Botetourt County, Virginia and died about 1772, father of Levina Willis (m. Peter Kinder). Henry settled in the area of Maiden Springs Fort on the Clinch River in Washington County, Virginia. He married Mary Cochran. In 1774 he fought in Lord Dunmore's War. About 1799 he is believed to have moved to Pulaski County, Kentucky, where he died about 1818. His children were John, Daniel, George, Levina (m. William Clark),Margaret (m. Charles Dotson/Dodson), Elizabeth (m. Robert Hunt), Samuel (b.abt.1800, m. Minerva Moore), Henry Jr. (b.1793, m. Sarah Moore), Lewis (m. Rachel Cox), probably Nancy (m. Jesse Williams), Polly (b.1795), and Patsy (b.1805). DNA testing indicates that Henry is descended from Daniel Burford, who was born in 1684 in King William County, Virginia. Project members who are descended from Henry are:\n\nHenry Jr./Greenville/Henry/Mathias (198137)\n\nHenry Jr.(73949, 138115)\n\nSamuel (67855)\n\nOthers (107970, 236121, and 377710)\n\nJackson Hal Willis was born in Missouri. He married Bernice Luthi in South Dakota. (478826)\n\nThe Henry Willis of Long Island Group\n\nFive books have been published on the ancestry and descendants of Henry Willis of Long Island by David Willis, the administrator of this website. They are Henry Willis of Long Island, Vol. 1: 1550 - 1800 (2008); Henry Willis of Long Island, Vol. 2: Northern Branches (2012); Henry Willis of Long Island, Vol. 3: Southern Ohio Branch (2013); Henry Willis of Long Island, Vol. 4: Isaiah Willis (2009); and Henry Willis of Long Island, Vol. 5: Other Branches (2010).\n\nHenry Willis of Long Island, New York was born in 1628 in or near Warminster, Wiltshire, England, where he married Mary Peace, daughter of Thomas Pearce of Westbury, Wiltshire. His known patrilineal ancestors are his great grandfather William (c.1550-1621; m. (1) Eliza Clarke and (2) Alice Edmunds), his grandfather Henry (1573-1641; m. Elizabeth Rowland), and father William (1605-1665; m. Katharine Wolford or Woodford). He is an only son and his father was the only son who grew to maturity. Henry’s great grandfather William was born and died with the surname Willens. Henry Willis of Long Island and his father and grandfather were all born with the surname Willens but died with the surname Willis. This is helpful information, because men living today who share Henry’s Y-DNA are almost certain to be descended from Henry, not an earlier ancestor if their surname is Willis. A good reference is George Ingraham Willis, “The English Origins of Henry Willis of Westbury, Long Island,” The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, vol. 118, No. 2, April 1987, 65–74.\n\nAfter being persecuted in England because of his Quaker religion, Henry Willis emigrated to Long Island in 1674 (or possibly 1675). His elder son, William (1663-1736; m. Mary Titus), remained in Long Island, as did William's sons. One of our project members is descended from William's son John (1693-1777; m. Abigail Willits). All our other project members are descended from Henry’s younger son, John (1669-1745; m. Esther Brinton), who settled in Chester County, PA. John had five sons. His eldest son, William (b.c.1693), died young and did not marry. John's second son, John Jr. (c.1695-1732; m. Mary Webb) left three children including one son, John III, who died while still an orphan. John’s middle son, Henry (c.1699-1761; m. Mary), moved to York County, PA in 1746. Henry's four sons, Joseph (c.1725-1809, Mercer Co., KY; m. Hannah), John (c.1732-1800, Franklin Co., VA; m. Phebe Bennett), Henry Jr. (c.1734-c.1768, York Co., PA; m. Susanna Stanton), and Isaiah (c.1742-aft.1809, Franklin Co., VA; m. (1) Hannah Johnston and (2) Catharine) founded branches of Willis-surname descendants in Virginia (Franklin County), Kentucky (Mercer County), southern Ohio (Lawrence County), Missouri (Monroe County), and elsewhere. John's second youngest son Edward (c.1705-1732; m. Catharine Maris) died young, leaving two sons, William (b.c.1727; m. (1) Elizabeth Harlan and (2) Hannah Matthews), who moved to York County, PA, and Joel (b.c.1730; m. (1) Mary Harvey and (2) Esther), who lived in Chester County, PA . Both had many children. John's youngest son was Benjamin (b.c.1709, d.c.1756), for whom there is no known evidence of marriage or children.

He was raised in the household of Joseph Hutton and Betty (Willis) Hutton. He was a Quaker who sought to abolish slavery. About June 1783 he married Sarah Copeland, also of York County. Their children were William, Isaac, John, Jesse, David, Rachel, Mary, and Abner. Jesse’s early descendants lived in Wayne County, Indiana and Dallas County, Iowa. Two members of our project are descended from sons of Jesse’s son Isaac (1787-1860, Wayne Co., IN):\n\nJonathan (1826-1903, Dallas Co., IA)/Lewis/Jonathan/Lewis (31966)\n\nHarvey S.

Ira Little), Benjamin (m. first Nancy, m. second Sally--research by maverick1338 has shown that Benjamin did not have a wife named Mary Eakley), Aaron (m. Louisa Estler), and Hannah (m. Thomas Morgan). Jacob died in 1841 in Morris County, New Jersey. (205702)\n\nJames Willis was born about 1822 in Ohio and died in 1865 in Cotton Township, Switzerland County, Indiana. He was a farmer and a cooper. He was married twice, first to Laura Lawton, who died after giving birth to their first child, and second to Mary Lawton, her sister. Our member is descended from his son George W. Willis, who was born in 1851 and died in 1899 in Boone, Boone County, Iowa. (481949)\n\nJoseph Willis of Morris County, New Jersey, born c. 1680 (wife Patience Thompson), was a blacksmith. He is the ancestor of two members of our project. He had four children, Joseph (II), born around 1721 (wife Abigail), Benjamin, Mary, and Anne. Benjamin married Abigail Winans; when she died he married her cousin Anna Winans. Son Joseph (II), in turn, had a son named Joseph (III), born 1759 (wife Grace Winans). Joseph (III) moved from Essex County, New Jersey, to Greene County, Pennsylvania, prior to 1780, to Columbiana County, Ohio, in 1822, and died in Jefferson County, Ohio, in 1843. Our member 95119 is descended from Joseph III’s son Isaac. (95119, 101870, and B1041836)\n\nThe North Carolina Group\n\nDavid Willis was born in 1720 and died in 1749. (320311)\n\nElijah Willis was born in Georgia in 1809, married Elizabeth Daniel in 1834 in Talbot County, Georgia, and about 1836 or 1837 settled in Autauga County, Alabama. Elijah's father was born in North Carolina. Children of Elijah and Elizabeth were William (born in 1835 in Georgia), John, Mary Francis, James Wesley, George, and Joseph P. (99629)\n\nHenry Willis of Goochland County, Virginia was born in Goochland County in 1731/1732 and died in Rutherford County, North Carolina in 1813. Descendants of at least three of his sons are members of the Willis project: Joseph, Henry Jr., and Benjamin:\n\nJoseph, who was born in 1753 and died in 1848, lived in Cleveland County, North Carolina. His son Joseph Jr., who was born 1789 and died in 1829, lived in Lincoln County and Cleveland County. Member 491893 is descended from Joseph Jr.’s son Banister. (491893, 636482, 966417)\n\nHenry Jr.married Mary Haddock in May 1783 in Caswell County, North Carolina. He died in 1820 in Caswell County.

He is the ancestor of member 219583. Henry’s son Joseph, who was born in Caswell County in 1835 and died in 1863 in Webster County, is the ancestor of member 219583. Henry’s son Anderson was born Dec.17, 1800 in Caswell County and moved to Habersham County, Georgia, where his sons W. A., John C., and Drury Dobbins were born. Drury Dobbins’s son Harmon A. is the ancestor of our member 127670. (127670, 219583)\n\nBenjamin Willis was born in North Carolina about 1765. According to a recollection of his grandson Stephen Morgan Willis (1844-1931), when Benjamin was a young man he moved from Cleveland County to Mitchell County. Records show that in 1796, Benjamin was living in Rutherford County, which is just west of Cleveland County. A known son of Benjamin is Rev. Thomas Willis (husband of Keziah Grindstaff), whose Willis-surname descendants lived in Mitchell County for many generations.(90449)\n\nJames Willis of North Carolinawas born about 1755 in Cumberland County, Virginia, and died in 1796 in Chatham County, North Carolina.

Children mentioned in James' will were Rebecca Caudle, Sally Crow, Suckey Willis, Jemima Willis, Wilson Willis, Larkin Willis (born in 1777), Molly Willis, Nannie Willis, Elijah Willis, and Elisha Willis. Larkin Willis had a son James Larkin. Our member 118615 is a descendant of James Larkin’s son Iredell C., and our member 415085 is a descendant of James Larkin’s son Larkin Wilson.

(246488)\n\nThe Old Rappahannock, Virginia Group\n\nMembers of the Old Rappahannock, Virginia Group and the Maryland Group were once in a single group but were split into separate groups in 2014. The patrilineal ancestor common to both groups will probably never be identified because he lived too far back in time.\n\nJohn Willis of King George County, Virginia was born in 1648 and died in 1715. A history of the early years of the family is The Willis Family of the Northern Neck of Virginia, 1669-1737, by Peggy Frances Rush (1998). John acquired land in King George County in 1669. His first wife was Sarah (last name unknown), by whom he had sons John Jr. and William. His second wife was Matilda (last name unknown) by whom he had a son named Charles. John Sr.'s eldest son John Jr. died without heirs, son 2. William inherited John Sr.’s estate. William was born in 1680. His wife was Sarah Hudson and their children were John, William Jr., and Sarah. After William’s death in 1717, William’s son 3.John inherited the estate. John was born in 1710 and died in 1762. He married Elizabeth Plunkett in 1734. He lived in King George County and had 12 children. One of his sons was 4. William Willis Sr., who was born in 1742. He married Elizabeth “Betsy” Garnett, and they had 13 children. William Sr. died May 21, 1833 in Boone County, Kentucky.

Several sons moved to the Houston/Galveston area of Texas in the early to mid-1800s. Two of our project members are descendants of Peter James Willis, through his son William, grandson Peter, and great grandson Peter Jr. (279781 and 294076)\n\nThe Ireland Group\n\nChristopher Willis was born about 1830 in Ireland, possibly in Dublin. He immigrated to Taylor Creek, Hardin County, Ohio about 1850 where he married Honora Curran, also from Ireland. (110342)\n\nWilliam Willis of Robeen, Mayo, Ireland lived from 1763 to 1838 and married Margaret (last name unknown).

(41076)\n\nThe Maryland Group\n\nMembers of the Maryland Group and the Old Rappahannock, Virginia Group were once in a single Group, but were split into separate Groups in 2014. The Willis-surname ancestor common to both groups will probably never be identified because he lived too far back in time. Most of the descendants of the Maryland Group are descended from John Willis of Dorchester County, Maryland, who was born between 1650 and 1660, probably in Berkshire County, England.\n\nAndrew Willis of Maryland died intestate in Caroline County, MD in 1778. He was a Quaker who owned a tract called Friendship/Friendship Regulated in Fork Hundred about five miles north of Federalsburg. His proved children were five sons Thomas (m. Sina Rickets), Andrew (m. Sarah), Joseph, and the youngest Elijah (who died before 1778, m. unknown). Eldest son Thomas Willis, ancestor of two of our members, inherited Friendship Regulated under the law of primogenitor. In 1778 and in accordance with his father's wishes, Thomas deeded parts of Friendship Regulated to the three surviving sons and to Isaac Collins. Collins likely was the husband of deceased Elijah's daughter who would have been entitled to Elijah's share of the land.

(423854)\n\nJohn Willis of Dorchester County, Maryland was born between 1650 and 1660 and died in 1712 in Dorchester County. He was the Crier for the Court of Dorchester County. He owned a parcel of land named \"Wantage\", indicating that he may have originally been from the village of the same name in Berkshire County, England. Known children were John Willis Jr. (born before 1690 and died in 1764 in Caroline County, Maryland), William Willis, Grace Willis, Eliza Willis, and Andrew Willis (born about 1690 and died in 1738). John Willis Jr. and Andrew had children. John Jr. had sons John, Joshua (b.1710), and Richard (b.1718) by his first wife, and John (b.1731) and Jarvis (b.1735) by his second. John Jr. owned land in Caroline County that he willed to his second son John. John Jr.'s son Richard, who was born about 1718, died about 1763 in Caroline County. A son of this Richard Willis was Richard Willis Jr., who was born in 1760 and died in 1823 in Caroline County. He is the ancestor of two members of our project.John Willis Sr.'s son Andrew had sons William, Thomas (b.1715), and Andrew by his first wife and Richard, George, and John by his second.

A descendant David Willis was born in Manchester, England and died in 1947 in Akron, Ohio. (894459)\n\nThe Southern Group\n\nThe Southern Group is America's largest group of related Willises. It is not known whether their most recent common patrilineal ancestor lived in England or in America. The ancestors of the earliest known American descendants originated in eastern Virginia and from there migrated southward, through south central and southeastern Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia. Earliest known ancestors in America include Robert Willis, born about 1700 and moved to Georgia; Stephen Willis, born about 1703, probably in Kent County, Virginia; and Richard Willis of Goochland County, Virginia, born about 1720.\n\nThe Southern Group - Subgroup A\n\nAustin Willis of North Carolina was born about 1820 in North Carolina. He married Edney Cook on December 26,1846. Austin was a blacksmith for the North Carolina railroad, in \"Company Shop,\" North Carolina. He served as a private in the Civil War in Company K, 47th North Carolina Regiment (Alamance Minutemen). He died about 1880 in North Carolina. His son, John Willis, was born in 1850 and died about 1900 in Nottoway County, Virginia. (20880)\n\nWilliam Austin Willis was born in 1808 in North Carolina. In 1850 he was living in New Madrid County, Missouri, where he is listed in the 1850 census with wife Sarah (age 39, born in North Carolina), his four eldest children William Cicero Willis, Henry Thomas Willis (born 1838 in Georgia, ancestor of our member 84019), Eli Samuel Willis, and Elizabeth A. Willis, all born in Georgia between 1835 and 1843, and his two youngest children Sarah E. Willis and James Wesley Willis, born in Missouri after 1847. William Austin married second to Lydia A. Arterbury, born 1830 Crittenden Co., KY; died between 1870-1876. Their children were John Harvey Willis (born 18 July 1860, ancestor of our member 202117), Laura Willis, and Pamelia (Mely) Willis. (10505, 84019, 136099, 202117)\n\nThe Southern Group - Subgroup B\n\nRobert Willis (Sr.), born about 1700, whose biography is below, is the known ancestor of four members of Subgroup B, and is very possibly also the ancestor of the other members in Subgroup B as well, through his son Price.\n\nBritton Willis (the elder) (1758-1845) (Compiled by Betty Boone and Joy Herron, 5 March 2010) was born in North Carolina and all information which has surfaced, including his Revolutionary War pension application, place his year of birth as 1758. He also tells us, via his pension application, that he moved to South Carolina when young, and at age 17 or 18, while living at Saluda Old Town, he was recruited as a Minute Man to serve \"on the frontiers of Georgia.\" He remained in Georgia for several years after the Revolution before returning to South Carolina where he settled in the Pendleton area. It is not known exactly in which year he moved back to South Carolina, but he was there by the time of the 1790 census. In 1806 he sold his lands in South Carolina and moved his family to Muhlenberg Co., Kentucky, where he lived for the remainder of his life. His death occurred April 1845 in Muhlenberg County, and his grave has been located on property which he owned at the time. Britton's wife was Ann, and there are clues which suggest she likely was a Gillespie; however, no proof to support this conclusion has been located. Sadly, Gillespie is stated as fact on many internet sites, yet no one has ever, as far as we know, been able to offer the needed documentation.\n\nTheir eight children were Winnifred (b ca 1781 GA), James (b ca 1783 GA), Matthew G. (b 20 Sep 1785 GA/SC), Thomas (b ca 1790/1794 SC), Ann G (b 27 Aug 1797 SC), David Gillespie (ca 1799 SC), Jane (b ca 1801 SC) and Peggy (b ca 1803 SC-d bef 1810 KY). Winnifred and Peggy left no known descendants. By the early 1820s the migration of the first generation of Willis descendants is beginning. Jane is the first child of Britton and Ann to leave Kentucky. She and husband James Wright arrive in Illinois about 1822. Next to leave Kentucky is Winnifred and her husband Thomas Garrard and members of his family; by 1830 the Garrards are living in Alabama. Thomas Willis and his wife Francis Welborn and children settle in Hancock County, Illinois in February 1832. In 1836 James Willis and his brother David Gillespie Willis are moving their families into the newly opened public lands in Marshall County, Mississippi. And in 1840 Matthew G. Willis is moving his family into Johnson County, Arkansas. Ann was Britton and Ann’s only child who lived to adulthood and did not migrate; Ann and her husband Stephen Wright remained in Muhlenberg County.\n\nBritton Willis (the elder) is very possibly a grandson of Robert Willis (Sr.) through his son Price (born 1735). Lineages of members of our project who are descended from Britton (the elder) are:\n\nJames/David Gillespie (b.1803 SC)/David Gillespie (b.abt.1840)/Claude Edward (b.1880 TN) (246086)\n\nJames/James Hamilton (b.1811 KY)/Raleigh Britton (b.1853 OK) (129808)\n\nJames/Benjamin H.

Isaiah was born in Virginia in 1764. In 1793 he married Susannah Cooper. He lived on Pistol Creek, in Lincoln County, Georgia, where he bought land on December 24, 1800. He died in 1815 in Lincoln County. His widow, Susannah, married second Guilford Pullin. Known children of Isaiah are Enos, Martin, Jane, Mary, Isaiah Carter, Cynthia, and Brittain. Isaiah's son (1) Enos Willis married Sarah Jane Pullen in Lincoln County. Isaiah’s son (2) Martin Willis was born in 1794, married Elizabeth Russell in 1815 in Lincoln County, and died in 1823. Martin's orphaned son John I.M. Willis was born in Georgia, probably Lincoln County, about 1817. John married Louisa Adeline Jones and moved to Coosa County, Alabama, where a son John Williams Willis was born in 1858. He is the father of Walter Warren Willis, who is an ancestor of our member 277736. Isaiah's son (3) Isaiah Carter Willis (1808-1880) married Eveline Wilkinson in 1830 in Wilkes County, Georgia. His son Edward Wilkinson Willis was born in 1836 and died in 1905. Edward's son Carter Isaiah Willis (1876-1934) is an ancestor of our member 786985. (277736, 786985)\n\nRobert Willis (Sr.) was born about 1700 and married twice. His first marriage was to a woman possibly named Agnes, with whom he had a daughter Zeney, born about 1719, and a son Robert Willis (Jr.), born 1721 and died 1767. His second marriage, about 1734, was to Mary Price of Goochland County, Virginia. She was born about 1711 and was a daughter of John Price and Hannah Williamson. From his marriage to Mary, Robert Sr. had at least four children, including sons Price Willis (born 1735) and Williamson Willis (born 1737), both known to be in Orange County, North Carolina just before the Revolution. Price Willis had a son Robert (possibly a brother of Britton Willis the elder, born 1758), who was born about 1765 and died about 1813.
