        "text": "ANDREW J. MONTAGUE\n\nOF MIDDLESEX COUNTY, VIRGINIA; PRIVATE, CO. \"C,\" 55TH VIRGINIA INFANTRY.\n\nAndrew Jackson, son of Lewis B. Montague and Catharine S., his wife, was born in the county of Middlesex, on the 4th of July, 1842. After going to neighborhood schools he was sent to Fleetwood Academy, then conducted by Mr. Oliver White. While at this institution, where he was associated with many youths of the best families of the neighboring counties, Jack, as he was familiarly called, was very popular. He bore the reputation of great sprightliness, and evinced many evidences of strong native intellect He was highly esteemed and beloved by his kind preceptors, Messrs. White and Council He remained at the academy for two years, when he was sent to the Virginia Military Institute, in the year 1860. He there entered the fourth class, and remained until April, 1861, when the most efficient members of the corps were ordered to Richmond to act as drill-masters. These cadets were assigned to a camp of instruction, afterwards known as Camp Lee. While here they rendered very efficient services in drilling raw volunteers rushing to the defense of the Southern cause. Most of the troops from the Southern States as they were sent on to Virginia were ordered to remain at this camp, and many of the Virginia regiments also, previous to their being mustered into the service. It was here that officers and men were instructed in the duties of a soldier and the details of camp-life. Here many of the troops were organized who afterwards gained the wonderful battle of Manassas, thereby winning an imperishable renown for Southern prowess and reflecting much credit upon the discipline enforced at the camp of instruction. Young Montague remained in the performance of these duties as long as they were needed. Instead of returning to the Institute and completing his course, he was inspired with all the ardent patriotism of youth, and preferred the sterner duties of active service to the more retired life of a cadet Although he had the benefit of a military education, as far as his time allowed, he did not wait for office to which he might with all justice and reason have aspired, but entered, in March, 1862, Co. \"C,\" of the 55th Virginia Infantry, as a private. In this company he was associated with the most refined and intelligent material of his county, where there was but little prospect of promotion among so many young men of high intelligence and equal social position. Jack Montague joined just as the regiment was going into real active service. He manifested in camp the same cheerful, bright disposition he had always shown; every service was performed with the greatest zeal and alacrity, and the writer well remembers how cheering his jokes were to his wearied comrades on the march. He was exceedingly popular with all his regiment, and set a valuable and important example to his comrades. His regiment saw quite active service in the spring of 1862, marching and picketing in the vicinity of Fredericksburg, made a forced march to Richmond, and there participated in the battles around the city. In the battle of Mechanicsville, the writer noticed with great admiration the coolness displayed by Jack when under such terrific fire. The regiment suffered very severely. On the next day, the 27th of June, the regiment participated in the battle of Gaines's Mills, where it again suffered severely. Among those who stood true to their colors Montague was at his post in the front rank, where he received a flesh wound in the arm, the same ball passing through the flesh and severely wounding his rear-rank man. Jack was sent to Richmond, where he met his brother, who conveyed him to a private house. After reaching quarters, he was taken with an inflammation which produced fever. His head was very much affected towards the last of his illness. While here, with all the attention of a good physician and hospitable family and the assiduous nursing of a devoted brother, his symptoms grew worse, until he fell a victim to disease produced from his wound. The writer also remembers his wandering thoughts the night before his death, as his mind reverted to the battle scenes and he alluded to the marshaling of troops. Thus, like his immortal instructor, he passed over the river with his mind engrossed in the raging conflict on earth. He died quietly and happily on July 12, 1862. George D. Nicholson.\n\n(Source: Biographical sketches of the Graduates and Eleves of the Virginia Military Institute who fell during the war between the States, by Chas. D. Walker. Published 1875.
