        "text": "Solomon “Sol” Cutchins\n\nAugust 14th, 1854 – May 14th, 1925\n\nSolomon “Sol” Cutchins was born in Nansemond Country, Virginia on August 14th, 1854. Brother Cutchins was wed to Caroline Robertta (Berta) Oppenheimer (1862-1930), daughter of Abraham Oppenheimer and Sarah Eliza Jones, in 1883. Sol and Berta were blessed with five sons, Colonel John A. Cutchins, Coleman Cutchins, Louis E. Cutchins, William S. Cutchins, and Frank Cutchins.\n\nMajor Cutchins served as commander of the Richmond Light Infantry Blues. He was the Commander of the original company, which had become Company A and was elected to major and the first battalion commander until 1901. He also served on the staff of Governor Andrew Jackson Montague from 1902 to 1906. Sol graduated with honors from Richmond College, where he received the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts and immediately began practicing law in Richmond. His son John A. Cutchins followed in his footsteps, and they worked in the firm Cutchins & Cutchins. Sol served as a member of the Richmond bar for many years. He had a long and successful career of over half a century serving the community of Richmond, Virginia.\n\nSol was initiated as an Entered Apprentice at Joppa Lodge, No. 40 in Richmond, Virginia on November 17th, 1879, passed to the degree of Fellowcraft on August 17th, 1886, and became a Master Mason on December 6th, 1886. He progressed through the chairs and became Worshipful Master of Joppa Lodge from 1896 to 1898. For his dedicated service to the Grand Lodge of Virginia he was made an honorary member of Joppa Lodge No. 40 on January 6th, 1921. Sol was elected to the office of Grand Junior Deacon of the Grand Lodge of Virginia on February 12th, 1914. In faithfully serving the offices during progression he was elected as the Most Worshipful Grand Master of Masons in Virginia 1919-1920 on February 13th, 1919. He served on the committee of Finance, Education, and was the Grand Representative to Nebraska for the Grand Lodge of Virginia.\n\nBrother Cutchins began his York Rite journey by receiving the Mark Master and Past Master’s Degree in Washington Royal Arch Chapter No. 9 in Richmond, Virginia on September 30th, 1891. The Council and Most Excellent Master’s degrees were conferred upon him on October 30th, 1891, and the Royal Arch Degree on July 18th, 1892. Companion Cutchins was elected and installed as High Priest of Washington Royal Arch Chapter No. 9 from 1898 to 1901 and was made an honorary member on October 29th, 1916. Sol was elected to the office of Grand High Priest of Royal Arch Masons in Virginia for 1912-1913.\n\nFor the Capstone of the York Rite, Sol started his Knight Templar journey on September 22nd, 1893, at St. Andrew Commandery No. 13 by receiving the Illustrious Order of the Red Cross and on February 23rd, 1984, he received the Order of Malta and the Order of the Temple. Sol was elected to the office of Commander of St. Andrew Commandery from 1906-1908. During the Grand Annual Conclave of the Grand Commandery on October 30th, 1919, Sol was elected to the office of Grand Junior Warden for the Grand Commandery of Virginia. At that time, the elected line began at the Grand Junior Warden’s office. The Standard Guard were appointed positions at the will and pleasure of the Grand Commander. As the years continued, he progressed in line and on October 30th, 1924, he became the Right Eminent Grand Commander of Grand Commandery of Knights Templar of Virginia. Sr Knights Cutchins was able to make three visitations after being installed as Grand Commander: the Official Visits of St. Andrew Commandery No. 13, Appomattox Commandery No. 6 and Dove Commandery No. 7. Shortly after that, he fell ill and had to decline invitations that had been extended. He had been battling the health condition of a weakened heart and his health had been impaired for a short time. On May 14th, 1925, at the age of 71, that morning coming home after a meeting of the Board of Governors at the Masonic Home of Virginia, Brother Cutchins carried on to that undiscovered country, from whom, no traveler returns. To my knowledge, Sir Knight Cutchins is the only Grand Commander of Virginia to carry on while serving as the Grand Commander. His funeral services were held on Saturday, May 16th, 1925, at 11 am in the Second Baptist Church, with Reverend Dr. Frank T. McFaden, Right Eminent Past Grand Commander, officiating the services. He was laid to rest in the Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, VA with Joppa Lodge No. 40 performing his Masonic Rites.\n\nReferences:\n\nProceedings of the 140th Annual Communication of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Virginia.
