We argue that petitioning in response to removal of the deposits shaped the emergence of the Whig Party, crystallizing a new line of Jacksonian opposition and dispensing with older lines of National Republican rhetoric and organization. Where petitioning against removal of the deposits was higher, the Whigs were more likely to emerge with organization and votes in the coming years. We test this implication empirically by using a new database of petitions sent to Congress during the banking crisis. We find that petitioning activity in 1834 is predictive of increased support for Whig Party candidates in subsequent presidential elections as well as stronger state Whig Party organization.\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nStudies in American Political Development , Volume 29 , Issue 2 , October 2015 , pp. 213 - 234\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0898588X15000073 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Cambridge University Press 2015\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

We are currently at work on another paper that generalizes this argument and refers as well to the rather precise anticipation of antislavery voting by antislavery petitioning in the United States.\n\n4\n\n4.

From 1833 to 1845, antislavery activists sent more than 8,500 petitions to the House of Representatives with at least 864,318 signatures (compiled from Harvard University database on antislavery petitions, in consultation with staff of National Archives Center for Legislative Archives). While we do not have information on the number of petitions (or the number of signatories on petitions) sent to the Senate, 150,000 signatures over a six-month period would appear comparable to the rate experienced at the height of antislavery petitioning. Note, however, that many antislavery activists also petitioned state legislatures, and that antislavery petitioning also continued through the 1840s and 1850s to the Congress, whereas Bank petitioning died off in 1834.\n\n8\n\n8.

There is, to be sure, evidence of meeting-based petition signing or of petitions being laid out at public meetings, churches and other venues in these other campaigns, but from existing literature and data we have examined elsewhere, door-to-door canvassing appears to be much more common with those petitions.

Volume 8: Candidate, Compromiser, Whig, March 5, 1829–December 31, 1836, 681; Clay adds that “If the local Banks could be induced to concur in such a movement so much the better.” Memorials in favor of the restoration of the deposits arrived from Philadelphia and were received in the Senate on March 4, 7, 14, 19, 25, 26, and June 19, 1834. As Holt summarizes, “Clay took the lead in attempting to consolidate the polyglot opposition” Holt, The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party, 25.

Vol. I (hereinafter, The Register of Debates), January 1834 , 58–94. As the editors of the Clay Papers summarize the address of December 26, “This was Clay's major speech on the removal of the deposits and the censure of Jackson and Taney” [Clay, The Papers of Henry Clay, Vol. 8, 684; Holt also sees the speech as central to Clay's development and to that of Whig origins Holt, The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party, 26–27. Southard's speech, more technical and elaborate than Clay's, appears in The Register of Debates, January 8, 1834; 143–198.\n\n36\n\n36. For the remarks on partisan removal, see The Register of Debates, December 26, 1833; 67–68. The poetic conclusion to the remarks of December 26 appears on p. 75.\n\n37\n\n37.

Duncan McArthur was called to the Chair, Col. Abraham Hagler, George Will, Esq. and Gen. James Manary chosen Vice Presidents.” Clay's allies agreed with his strategic emphasis on mobilizing public opinion, though the concept of public opinion and public sentiment was being transformed even as they wrote by developments in the electorate, pamphleteering, the aftermath the Second Great Awakening and the testimonial energies to which it gave rise. Peter B. Porter (writing from Black Rock, NY) to Clay, January 5, 1834, Clay The Papers of Henry Clay, Vol. 8, 686: “I am glad to see the question of the deposits progress so moderately in both houses; for I think you will constantly gain by delay, if not continued too long. Every day's discussion aided by manifestations of public sentiment, and evidences of public distress, cannot, I think, fail to produce some effect on the Jackson men in Congress who have not abjured every sentiment of patriotism” (emphasis in original). On some of the transformations of political discourse in these years, see Howe, What Hath God Wrought; Sandra M. Gustafson, Imagining Deliberative Democracy in the Early American Republic (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press, May 2011), especially Ch. 4.\n\n39\n\n39.

One caveat is that, because the text of the Congressional Globe was digitized through optical character recognition (OCR), Type II errors might occur if the digitized text itself did not accurately capture our keywords. While we acknowledge the potential for this type of error, the digitization of the text in the Globe is quite clean and effective. As a result, we do not believe OCR leads to a substantial amount of Type II errors.\n\n54\n\n54. One potential concern about petitions is that they reflect the biases of members of Congress who might not submit all petitions to be read on the floor. One issue that allays this concern to some degree is that petitioners could submit their petition to any member of Congress sympathetic to their agenda. Henry Clay, for example, read a number of petitions from states other than Kentucky. Furthermore, during the crisis, Congress appears to have set aside time on the calendar specifically for the submission of petitions to the floor.\n\n55\n\n55. As Bray Hammond, in his work describing the attack on the bank, related one commonly held view, “All intelligent New Yorkers agreed that this charter enabled a corporation located in Philadelphia, a majority of whose acting directors resided in that city, to exercise a dangerous power over the monied and mercantile operations of the great city of New York” Hammond, Banks and Politics in America from the Revolution to the Civil War, 357.\n\n56\n\n56.

These include farmers, merchants, mechanics, traders, boot and shoe makers, cordwainers, tin-plate workers, sheet-iron workers, chair-makers, upholsterers, authors, publishers, bookbinders, watchmakers, silversmiths, and jewelers among others.\n\n66\n\n66. This marginal effect is evaluated at the mean number of antirestoration petitions in order to incorporate the interaction included in the model.\n\n67\n\n67. We include up to a fourth-order polynomial.\n\n68\n\n68. There are several additional points of emphasis with respect to Figure 5. First, in some cases states held congressional elections on odd years. For ease of estimation and presentation, these are grouped into the next even year (for example, elections held in 1835 were pooled into the 1836 sample). Second, especially in early years, not all congressional districts ran Whig Party candidates (that said, the total proportion of districts with a Whig Party candidate in 1836 is strikingly high and, as a result, there is not enough geographic variation to make a study of the determinants of candidacy an interesting exercise). The fact that there are more observations in later years (i.e., Whig candidates ran in almost every district) explains why the estimates are noisier in the early years of the sample.\n\n69\n\n69. In fact, state party factors compose perhaps the principal force examined by Holt in his history of the Whig Party.\n\n70\n\n70. James G.

These states were chosen because of their variation in Whig party development as well as because they had sufficient numbers of counties (and sufficient numbers of petitions for or against deposit restoration) to assess within-state correlations between petitioning practices in 1834 and later patterns of Whig Party voting. States such as Georgia or Tennessee, with numerous counties but with few or no petitions, provide us with too little variation on the dependent variable for within-state analysis. Note that such states will also figure less prominently (or not at all) in the nation-wide regressions with state fixed effects.\n\n75\n\n75. Ibid., 43.\n\n76\n\n76. Ibid., 53.\n\n77\n\n77.
