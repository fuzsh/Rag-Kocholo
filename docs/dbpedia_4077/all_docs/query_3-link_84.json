        "text": "From an earlier letter written by William W. Phelps, JS learned that non-Mormon Jackson County citizens had killed some church members, but some reports included rumors of deaths that were never confirmed. (Letter from William W. Phelps, 6–7 Nov. 1833; see also Letter to Edward Partridge, 5 Dec. 1833.)\n\nAndrew Barber and Philo Dibble were two of at least five Mormons wounded on Monday, 4 November 1833. Edward Partridge wrote that Barber died the following day. In 1862, Philo Dibble stated that “brother A Cleveland was wounded in the right shoulder, Philo Dibble in the bowels, Jacob Whitney in the right wrist, and William Whiting in the foot, at the first shot, & bro. Andrew Barber was shot in the chest and killed.” Though Dibble’s statement gives 10 November as the date of the skirmish, contemporary sources agree the battle took place on 4 November. ([Edward Partridge], “A History, of the Persecution,” Times and Seasons, Jan. 1840, 1:33–34; Letter from John Corrill, 17 Nov. 1833; Philo Dibble, Statement, 1862, CHL.)\n\nTimes and Seasons. Commerce/Nauvoo, IL. Nov. 1839–Feb. 1846.\n\nDibble, Philo. Statement, 1862. CHL. MS 4036."
