“Take time to deliberate; but when the time for action arrives, stop thinking and go in.” – Andrew Jackson, 7th President of the United States

Merry President’s Day week everyone! Whether you are for or against President Jackson being born in S.C., more on that here, there are plenty of events this week to make you take action, versus mulling it over on your couch.

Give back this week by eating at The Glass Onion, donating blood in Mt. Pleasant💉, or attending the AMA Go Red For Women Luncheon.

Enjoy a Mexican-Italian mashup on Monday, eat aboard a cruise ship on Wednesday, + ski down a mountain of cheese this Thursday.

Whatever you decide to do this week, be sure to show some extra love to your pets this Tuesday– Love Your Pet Day 🐶 💕.
