After Frost confronted Daisy about the affair and fired her from the position, Daisy went to the press and revealed all about her relationship with Law.

Daisy explained that she exposed their affair after being disappointed in the actor: "I was extremely upset about the way I was dismissed just like that from my job... I felt that Jude should have fought for me."

How long were Jude Law and Sienna Miller together?

Miller was only 23 years old when the affair went public. The couple stayed together, but broke up the following year, in 2006. They briefly reunited in 2009.

Miller has since defended her decision to stay with Law, but maintains that it was one of the hardest times of her life. At the time, she was performing in a play in London with shows every night. "That was one of the most challenging moments I hope I'll ever have to experience," she told Daily Beast in 2020. Because with that level of public heartbreak, to have to get out of a bed let alone stand in front of 800 people every night, it's just the last thing you want to do."

The couple split for good in 2011, and don't remain in contact. She told Porter in 2016: "We don't see each other that much. I care about him enormously."
