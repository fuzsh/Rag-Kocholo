Jude Law is being comforted by his ex-wife Sadie Frost in the wake of his split from Sienna Miller.

The Sherlock Holmes actor - who has three children, Rafferty, 14, Iris, 10 and Rudy, eight, with his former spouse - announced his second break-up from Sienna this week and he has turned to Sadie and his kids for emotional support.

A source told the Daily Mirror newspaper: "Jude and Sienna remain on good terms. There's no hard feelings on either side.

"But since making their split official, Jude has been spending more time with his family, including Sadie.

"When Jude and Sienna were together that wasn't so easy. Relations weren't always fantastic between the two women."

Sienna is getting over the separation by hanging out with actor Joe Armstrong, her co-star in upcoming West End play Flare Path.

The source revealed: "Sienna is still young and, in time, wants to get back out on the dating scene.

"For now, she's burying her head in work. Her colleagues have been brilliant. She gets on really well with Joe in particular and they've been hanging out a bit outside of the theatre."

Jude, 38, and 29-year-old Sienna - who reunited after three years apart in October 2009 - have vowed to remain friends despite their break-up, which is believed to have taken place a few weeks ago.

A source said: "It is mutual and amicable and they are still friends. It was an entirely an end-of-the relationship decision. It had run its course."
