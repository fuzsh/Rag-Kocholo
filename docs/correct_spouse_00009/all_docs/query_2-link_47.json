        "text": "JUDE Law and Sienna Miller have broken-up... just six weeks after setting up home together.\n\nThe couple, more on and off than Jordan’s lingerie, called time on their 16-month relationship shortly after returning from holiday in Kenya, I can reveal.\n\nAlthough a spokesperson last night insisted the split was “mutual and amicable”, it is understood Sienna’s growing friendship with a younger male actor caused friction.\n\nIt is the second time the actress, 29, and Jude, 38, have parted ways. Their initial two-year relationship ended acrimoniously in 2006 when it emerged The Holiday star had slept with his children’s nanny, Daisy Wright. Yesterday, a source close to the couple insisted there were no “hard feelings”, and the pair remain in regular contact.\n\nI’m told: “Jude and Sienna have always had a fiery relationship but they had been rowing even more than usual over the past two months.\n\n“They arranged a fairly last-minute, make-or-break holiday to Africa over the festive period and though they came back still talking to each other, it was fairly obvious that the spark had gone.\n\n“They decided to call it a day soon after. Sienna has already moved her things out of his place and is living back in her London pad.\n\n“During this time Jude has been spending a bit more time with his ex-wife Sadie Frost while Sienna has been working hard and hanging out with more of her friends, a younger male thespian in particular.\n\n“Happily though, things are all above board this time and they remain good friends.”\n\nNews of the split comes just weeks after they were said to have moved in to an £8million North London home together.\n\nDuring this time Jude reportedly bought Sienna, who he met on the set of Alfie, a grand piano containing a sapphire ring hidden in the lid.\n\nThe actress, whose previous boyfriends include Rhys Ifans and billionaire Balthazar Getty, is currently rehearsing for Trevor Nunn’s new West End play Flare Path.\n\nJude also remains in the capital, shooting Sherlock Holmes 2."
