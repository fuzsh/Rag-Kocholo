        "text": "Yea I saw that and what a beautiful cottage. I really respect her too. She suffered serious abuse from the media but rose above it in the end. I'm sounding like I'm obsessed which I am a bit ðŸ¤—\n\nI saw her in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in London a couple of years ago, and she was superb. I'd never seen her in anything before, and expected her to be a bit rubbish, as all I knew was that she was a model, but she was very very good.\n\nDelayed response but i have met her when we were both pregnant and had a quick chat. She was with her mum and she was lovely and stunning! Had lots of freckles! X\n\nI think as an actress sheâ€™s extremely underrated. There was a film she did with Steve Buscemi - I canâ€™t remember the name, but it was a two-handed the whole movie and she absolutely mesmerised me, to be able to pull off a role like that is very tricky,\n\nYou mean didn't Jude Law ruin his own marriage?\n\nThose two were regularly fucking every and anything but each other for a period of time anyway.\n\nSienna Miller is gorgeous, talented and seems to live life to her own beat.\n\nI saw her recently in the film American Woman and was blown away by how good she is. It's a very sad film, but worth watching just for her performance.\n\nYeah, I think this is why everyone likes Sienna - this kind of crap that's followed her for 20 years.\n\nHer and Sadie are friendly (did a doc together), Sadie herself has said it was her poor mental health that was the primary driver in their split and the dates - while close - do not overlap between the relationships. The divorce was already filed (Aug 2003) by the time Jude and Sienna started filming Alfie (Oct 2003) which is said to be where they met."
