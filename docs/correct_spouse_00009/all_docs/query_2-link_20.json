        "text": "AK00 [OP]\n\nNewbie\n\n50 posts\n\nSienna Miller is pregnant with Jude Law's child\n\nSources have revealed to Star that Sienna Miller is six weeks pregnant with Jude Law's child. They allegedly gathered friends and family at their London home to announce her pregnancy before Jude's affair with the nanny was exposed, though reps for Miller and Law have not confirmed or denied the pregnancy.\n\n\"She [and Jude had] discussed names for the baby,\" a friend tells Star. Now, Law \"had destroyed any chance they had of bringing up the baby together.\"\n\nAdditionally, Star reports that during Jude Law's marriage to Sadie Frost, the mother of his three children, Jude cheated with no fewer than six women - a model, a celebrity's assistant, two A-list stars, a rock star's ex-wife and a lap dancer. I guess Sienna Miller should be grateful Jude only cheated on her with the nanny, as opposed to the bevy of Catholic school girls he probably had his eyes on. And considering he's Jude Law, he probably could have had those Catholic school girls if he wanted. ****, now I wish I was Jude Law. Not because I want to have sex with Catholic school girls, but because I wish my last name was Law. Man, that's such a sweet last name.\n\nSource: http://www.thesuperficial.com/archives/003239.html\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: Could it be Orlando Bloom's? Who the hell cares.....now you know. For those who were still in some cave, Jude Law cheated on Sienna Miller with the \"Nanny\" of his children from past marriages. Record shows Law's pretty much a \"consistento\" in his affairs.\n\n36 replies\n\njm20\n\nDeal Addict\n\n1494 posts\n\n18 upvotes\n\n[IMG]http://www.golf-tuition-online.com/vbpo ... 0gm_l3.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWould you cheat on her?\n\nbiosh\n\nBanned\n\n3038 posts\n\nSurely this is an \"Entertainment\" topic...\n\n\"You don't get harmony when everybody sings the same note.\" -Doug Floyd\n\nfakishan\n\nDeal Fanatic\n\n6233 posts\n\n705 upvotes\n\nQuebec\n\njm20 wrote:[IMG]http://www.golf-tuition-online.com/vbpo ... 0gm_l3.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWould you cheat on her?\n\nif you had deep psychological problems, yes.\n\njm20\n\nDeal Addict\n\n1494 posts\n\n18 upvotes\n\nbiosh wrote:Surely this is an \"Entertainment\" topic...\n\nif you find movie stars lives entertaining... then yes.\n\nronny1980\n\nDeal Addict\n\n4466 posts\n\n7 upvotes\n\nGot a picture of the nanny?\n\nWhy are hurricanes named after women?

It's my last name, and I'm not particularly fond of it. On the off occasion, I will tell people Jude Law is a distant cousin of mine, they never really buy it.. If I make it into law school, which I'm gunning for, I know I will hear it from the profs and other students.\n\nAnd after that, if I start my own firm...
