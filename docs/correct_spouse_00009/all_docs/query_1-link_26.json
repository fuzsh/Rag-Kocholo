He thinks Sienna's a hypocrite for giving him such a hard time over his affair when she has been carrying on with Daniel.\n\n\"To make matters worse, Daniel is one of Jude's oldest pals and he feels utterly betrayed.\n\n\"Daniel and Sienna first got together when they were filming Layer Cake two years ago, around the time Jude left his wife Sadie Frost and started dating Sienna.\n\n\"She's had Jude jumping through hoops to put their engagement on track. Now he feels badly betrayed.\"\n\nhttp://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/story_pages/showbiz/showbiz1.shtml\n\nJUDE BOOTS SIENNA\n\nOctober 9, 2005 -- First Jude Law cheated with the nanny, now he's reportedly dumped his fianc‚e, Sienna Miller. Britain's Sunday Mirror said yesterday that Law, whose affair with dumpling-like Daisy Wright became an international scandal, flew to a secret location and told friends not to tell Sienna where he was. \"Jude has decided he and Sienna have no future and the relationship has become destructive,\" a source told the paper. Meanwhile, the News of the World is reporting that Law kicked Sienna out after she cheated with hunky actor Daniel Craig. Despite the extramarital fair play, Miller apparently begged Law to patch things up with her on vacation at a fancy Moroccan spa - and he even booked, cancelled and rebooked his tickets before finally bailing out.\n\nhttp://www.nypost.com/gossip/29148.htm"
