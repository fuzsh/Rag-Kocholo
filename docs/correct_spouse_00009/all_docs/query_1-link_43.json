        "text": "Sienna Miller says she is lucky to have survived the media “madness and chaos” that surrounded her relationship with Jude Law 20 years ago.\n\nMiller, 42, admits she turned to alcohol and partying “too much” as her acting career exploded and her relationship imploded under intense focus.\n\nThe award-winning actress said after meeting Law on the set of the film Alfie in 2003, the focus on the couple left her feeling like a “piece of prey”.\n\nBut she added that she is proud to have “come out the other side” after fighting “very unmanageable energy”.\n\nMiller, the mother of two children, said: “It’s so surreal to look back and imagine, or even to look back sometimes and see pictures of the amount of people that were there in my life all the time.\n\n“It makes you go completely mad, which is ideal for them. The more you spiral, the better it is in terms of selling papers, that English thing of just wanting to tear people down. It felt so celebratory. And I was so madly in love.\n\n“It was in many ways the most exciting moment. I just started working and I was in a big film and in love with this idol, and very, very happy, but the flip side of it was so dark, so quickly.\n\n“You learn so much about yourself through that experience, but I feel very lucky to kind of still be here, which sounds dramatic. I think that it can incur just madness and chaos. It is chaos.\n\n“You are dealing with aggression and violence and you are a piece of prey and you’re being hunted every day, so you are paranoid.\n\n“The response to that is, for me, I was like, ‘I’m not changing. I’m not gonna give up my life’.\n\n“I’ve always been relatively the same person, but you escape. I was drinking too much.\n\n“I was probably going out too much. I’d also watched people behave in the 1990s in a way that I thought was how you behaved, but having a lot of fun, but that also breeds more panic. I see other people who went through it and didn’t kind of come out the other side as well, so I’m quite proud.”\n\nMiller made her comments on SiriusXM’s This Life of Mine with James Corden this week.\n\nShe and Law dated for almost a year before getting engaged on Christmas Day 2004.\n\nAt the time, Law, the star of The Talented Mr Ripley, had three children with Sadie Frost, his former wife.\n\nIt was revealed in 2005 that he cheated on Miller with Daisy Wright, his children’s nanny.\n\nMiller told Corden she was “so madly in love” with Law but noted that she had “very little agency” with how she was portrayed in the media, and was pursued by paparazzi daily.\n\nAlthough Miller and Law ended their relationship in 2006, they rekindled their romance in 2009 before finally calling it quits in 2011.\n\nLater that year, she began a relationship with Tom Sturridge, the actor, and she had their daughter, Marlowe, in July 2012. The pair broke up in 2015.\n\nIn August 2023, it was reported Miller was expecting her second child with boyfriend Oli Green, who is 14 years her junior. She gave birth to another girl, whose name has not been publicly revealed, in December last year."
