        "text": "THE FAIRYTALE romance of handsome British actor Jude Law and blond bombshell actress Sienna Miller is over for the second time and, more than likely, can never be rekindled again.\n\nBritain's golden ­couple split a few weeks ago after their love affair descended into heated arguments over everything from her dogs Porgy and Bess (too messy) to Law's relationship with his ex-wife and the mother of his three ­children, Sadie Frost (too harmonious), MailOnline reports.\n\nThere is even talk that 29-year-old Miller found her 38-year-old lover’s ­preference for staying in \"really rather boring\", and there are rumours that she has been on dates. Whatever the reasons for the split, friends on both sides insist that it is final.\n\nWhile the romance was restarted once before - following their break-up after Law’s affair with his children’s nanny in 2005 - friends say this time there is \"absolutely no chance whatsoever\" of the couple getting back together, however much their publicists may talk about the split being \"amicable\".\n\nThe separation has come as a shock to many - Law gave Miller a diamond ring and a grand piano for Christmas, and there was even talk - later denied - that she’d asked her designer sister Savannah to sketch her dress ahead of a possible winter wedding.\n\nMiller had claimed their relationship was \"‘perfect\". In an interview last winter, she said she was \"stupidly happy\"."
