        "text": "Credit: Neil Rasmus/BFA.com/Shutterstock\n\nSienna Miller’s Dating History: A Complete Guide to Her Ex-Fiances and Boyfriends Past and Present\n\nSienna Miller has never given up on love — even after her messy split from ex-fiancé Jude Law made headlines in the early 2000s. “There’s a whole six weeks of that experience that I don’t remember,” Miller recalled to the Daily Beast in December 2020. “I have no recollection of it.\" Miller confessed she was “in so much shock” when news broke in 2005 of Law’s affair with his kid’s nanny. “I’d really just begun. I was only 23. But if you get through that, you feel like you can get through anything,” she said. After the pair split in 2011 for a second time, Miller chose to remember her and Law’s romance with fondness. “I care about him enormously,” she told Porter magazine in May 2016. In that same interview, Miller joked about the type of men she tends to gravitate toward. “I like intelligence,” she revealed. “It’s the only thing I’ve ever been attracted to. People who aren’t clever enough fall by the wayside. They’re a motley crew my ex-boyfriends, if you lined them up, it would be strange.” Scroll down for Miller’s most high-profile relationships:\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nJude Law\n\nLaw proposed to Miller in December 2004 after meeting on the set of Alfie one year prior. The twosome split in 2006 after Law confessed to cheating on his then-fiancée with his children’s nanny. At the time, Law was the father of three kids — Rafferty, Iris and Rudy — whom he shares with ex-wife Sadie Frost.\n\nMiller and Law gave their relationship a second chance in 2009 but they called it quits for good in 2011. (Law has since welcomed four more children. He shares daughter Sophia with ex Samantha Burke and daughter Ada with ex Catherine Harding. Law and wife Phillipa Coan have two kids.)\n\nCredit: Daniel Smith/Sony/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nDaniel Craig\n\nMiller was accused of having an affair with Craig by Law in 2005 after he learned of an alleged declaration of love between the pair. Miller reportedly told Craig she loved him during a phone call that was later leaked to Law — and then the masses — by a now-defunct News of the World. “Hi. It’s me. Can’t speak. I’m at the Groucho (club) with Jude. I love you,” Miller said in the alleged recording.\n\nDuring a January 2014 photo hacking trial against the former news outlet, Miller was called to testify about her alleged remarks. “The thing that’s been slightly misconstrued about this voicemail message is the fact that I said ’I love you’ and that this was some incredibly important declaration of love,” she said in court. “That’s how I would have ended my phone calls to [Craig]. It’s been turned into a titillating piece of information. I regret it’s allowed to be analyzed the way it has.”\n\nMiller called Craig her best friend but later told the court, “Whether or not I was in a relationship with Daniel Craig at the time, it was a very brief encounter.” Law, meanwhile, explained during the trial that he confronted Craig about the fling and their “conversation took on all sorts of turns.” (Craig has been married to Rachel Weisz since 2011.)"
