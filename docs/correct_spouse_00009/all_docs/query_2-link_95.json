They got engaged shortly after, but once news broke that the actor cheated on his fianc√© with his children's nanny, Daisy Wright, Sienna called their wedding off, reports People.\n\n\"It was really hard,\" the 21 Bridges actress recently told The Daily Beast, reflecting on that time in her life. \"And the other thing was, it was at the height of all that paparazzi madness, and in London where there was an epidemic of bad behaviour. They knew where I would be every night.\"\n\nShe added: \"That was one of the most challenging moments I hope I'll ever have to experience. Because with that level of public heartbreak, to have to get out of a bed let alone stand in front of 800 people every night, it's just the last thing you want to do.\"\n\nShe revealed: \"There's a whole six weeks of that experience that I don't remember. I have no recollection of it. People who came to see me said we had dinner, and I don't remember.\n\n\"I was in so much shock over it all. And I'd really just begun. I was only 23. But if you get through that, you feel like you can get through anything.\"\n\nThe couple officially split in 2006 but rekindled their romance in 2009 before calling it quits, for good, in 2011.\n\nSienna went on to date, Balthazar Getty, who was married at the time, resulting in a highly publicised affair, before she started dating actor Tom Sturridge, with whom she shares eight-year-old Marlowe Ottoline Layng Sturridge."
