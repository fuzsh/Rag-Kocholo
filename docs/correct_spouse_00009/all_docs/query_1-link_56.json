[AFP]\n\nMiller, who met Law on the set of Alfie soon after his bitter 2003 divorce from Sadie Frost, was overcome with emotion when the actor pulled out a diamond engagement ring and asked her to wed him.\n\nFollowing Miller's immediate acceptance, Law then informed his children Rafferty, Iris and Rudy of his martial plans the following day when he whisked them off for a sunny holiday in the Seychelles.\n\nA spokeswoman for the couple, Caira Parks, on Wednesday confirmed Law and Miller would tie the knot, although they were still working on a date for the big day.\n\nThe news comes just months after Law and Miller rubbished reports they were planning to marry."
