        "text": "D-DAY for Jude and Sienna (24th JULY)\n\nLOVE rat Jude Law will hold crunch talks with fiancée Sienna Miller today in a desperate bid to woo her back. The two-timing star will vow to change his ways after his affair with nanny Daisy Wright was exposed. Jude, 32, is increasingly confident he will be able to win her back.\n\nA pal said: \"Jude wants Sienna to know he can change and that he wants her back. He says he has been an idiot.\"\n\nThe cheating star was forced to issue a grovelling apology this week about his month-long affair with his kids' nanny. Seething Sienna responded by calling off their wedding and moving out of their £2 million mansion in north London. The couple have already met in secret TWICE this week. But Sunday's talks were viewed as D-Day for the couple. A showbiz source said: \"It will be emotional. Jude, who got engaged to Sienna last Christmas, is desperate to win his fiancée back.\n\n\"Sienna is still in two minds, but the fact she's agreed to meet him has made him a lot more hopeful they can salvage things.\n\n\"Sienna's family and friends have made no secret that they think Jude is a complete rat.\n\n\"But the longer their talks go on, the more Jude is confident everything will be OK.\" A pal said Jude would be in for a tough time at the meeting, expected to take place on neutral ground in Gloucestershire.\n\n\"Sienna is bound to demand, ‘How will I ever be able to trust you again?' \"\n\nSienna turned to her stepmum, interior designer Kelly Hoppen—who helped set up today's meeting—after news of Jude's fling with Daisy broke. A pal of Sienna's said: \"Kelly had some words of wisdom for her. She told her to keep her counsel and maintain her dignity at all costs.\n\n\"Sienna's gone through the whole gamut of emotions.\n\n\"At first she was very tearful and upset but now she is becoming more steely and the anger is kicking in.\"\n\nSienna, 23, is starring in Shakespeare's As You Like It in the West End — but pulled out of her performance on Tuesday. Outraged friends clubbed together to send Jude a WREATH to show their disgust at the way he'd treated her. The star's affair with Daisy, 26, is the THIRD time he has been accused of cheating. American lapdancer Erica Coburn claimed she had an affair with him in 2001 while he was married to Sadie Frost. And we exclusively revealed earlier this year how Jude chased after singer Pearl Lowe after taking part in steamy wife-swap sessions. Jude denied both claims, despite Pearl publicly confirming she had slept with the star. In the latest twist, he seduced nanny Daisy while filming All The King's Men in New Orleans in March. She told how the movie hunk \"made her body tingle\" during wild sex . At first Jude denied the affair and told ex-wife Sadie that one of their children lied by claiming to have caught him in bed with Daisy. But last week he was forced to apologise after the bombshell fling was exposed. In a statement he said he was \"deeply ashamed\", and went on: \"I want to publicly apologise to Sienna for the pain I've caused.\"\n\nAS THEY SAY ONCE A CHEATER,ALWAYS A CHEATER.. ​\n\nAbove the Law\n\nJuly 25, 2005\n\nThe Sun-Herald\n\nJude Law and Sienna Miller in Alfie.\n\nActress Sienna Miller is out to prove she's got substance as well as style - and that her career doesn't rely on her famous fiance, writes Holly Byrnes.\n\n\"In every doomed relationship, there comes what I like to call 'the uh-oh moment'. When a certain little something happens, and you know you've just witnessed the beginning of the end. And suddenly you stop and you think, 'Uh-oh, iceberg ahead'.\"\n\nWise words, hey Jude?\n\nThat's the actor Jude Law, who once uttered these lines on screen in his first leading role, prophetically playing an English womaniser who comes a cropper in the 2004 remake of Alfie.\n\nThe same Jude Law who met his beautiful, 20-something fiancee Sienna Miller on the set of this film, which partnered them up on screen and eventually off it too.\n\nAnd the same Jude Law who last week broke Miller's heart by admitting to a fling with his children's nanny while away on location.\n\nUh-oh, indeed, ol' boy.\n\nLaw's iceberg hit last Sunday, when a London tabloid reported the bedroom confessions of Daisy Wright, the 26-year-old carer hired by his ex-wife to look after their three children.\n\nFor Miller, the scandalous news sank any hopes she may have had of living happily ever after with her leading man.\n\nAt least for now.\n\nThe latest update has the celebrity couple meeting for \"crisis talks\" in a Surrey mansion, where an angry Miller is said to have asked for his side of the whole tawdry story.\n\nEarlier in the week, it was a teary Miller who was forced to endure further ignominy in public, arriving for work at a London theatre, where she is appearing in a production of Shakespeare's As You Like It. Dwarfed by minders and sans her $60,000 solitaire engagement ring, the 23-year-old cut a fragile figure as she made her way through the ravenous press pack who lay in wait by the stage door.\n\nIronically, Miller signed on for the play in a desperate bid for industry credibility; to prove there was something more to her than the fabulous frocks she wears or the fabulous somebody she dates.\n\n\"I want to prove myself as more than somebody's girlfriend or a fashion person. I don't want to be scrutinised just because of the relationship I'm in,\" she told one reporter.\n\nBut despite her earnest efforts, critics have been mostly scathing of her performance as Celia, with only the fashion magazines still gushing in praise of their new favourite cover girl.\n\nIt's this battle of style versus substance that has our heroine really torn.\n\nOn the one hand, Miller concedes that her relationship with Law has secured her plenty of valuable publicity. And the fact she also has a face to light up 1000 flashbulbs hasn't hurt either. But if it's serious street cred she desires, rather than just the glory of being a high street style icon, more work is needed.\n\nSienna Miller needs a meaty role to boost her credentials.\n\nPhoto:AFP\n\nA look over her list of film credits to date doesn't fill one with confidence that she's gone beyond mere \"set decoration\".\n\nOf course, she first got our attention in Alfie, playing Law's on-screen girlfriend, Nikki, flitting about the screen in little more than a man's shirt and some fluffy slippers. Then there is Layer Cake, which opens in Australia this week, in which she appears as the trophy girlfriend in an otherwise gritty, underworld drama.\n\nOne reviewer, while salivating over her looks, was dismissive of her contribution to the film.\n\n\"She serves no dramatic purpose, apart from lightening a movie which is otherwise mostly filled with an assortment of hoods in sharp suits.\"\n\nAnd it's not about to get better, with her most recent movie role in the can as one of Heath Ledger's conquests in Casanova (set for release here in January next year).\n\nShe did try to rough up her CV with an edgier part as Andy Warhol's drug-fuelled girlfriend Edie Sedgwick, in the upcoming biopic Factory Girl, only to be later dumped by producers, who have gone in search of a \"bigger name\".\n\nThere's no doubt this latest off-screen drama with her real-life leading man could be a turning point for Miller as famous girlfriend. But it could also prove a dramatic crossroads for her career, too.\n\nWhile the relationship was good for publicity early on, Miller's reputation could suffer, says Toni Higginbotham, a casting director.\n\n\"When you are in that type of environment, where everybody knows your every move, then from a business point of view and an artistic point of view, people are going to see you in that light,\" she says.\n\n\"From a casting director's point of view, I'd tell her to get rid of Jude, for the sake of her credibility as an actress.\"\n\nEven though the blame lies squarely with him, Higginbotham says it could be Miller who pays the price.\n\n\"People will wonder why she would put up with that if she takes him back. My advice would be to look for a new boyfriend and concentrate on your own career rather than what he's doing.\"\n\nIf she has any professional instincts at all, she'll use the experience to fire herself up to pursue more meaty roles - and a new man to boot!\n\nSink 'em into him, Sienna!\n\nLayer Cake will be released on Thursday.\n\nSadie's subterfuge\n\nCould Nannygate be Sadie Frost's final revenge on her famous ex? While Frost acted swiftly to fire Daisy Wright after one of her children told her of the nanny's nocturnal activities with Law, her decision to hire her in the first place warrants some scrutiny.\n\nWhen her marriage to Law folded, Frost wanted the world to know she thought he was a love rat - playing around while she stayed at home with the kids. Those claims were dismissed by Law's fans as the bitter ravings of a jilted lover - and after all, his new union with Miller was deemed a picture-perfect match.\n\nBut when Frost came to cast the role of the family babysitter, it seems it was not entirely coincidental the lucky candidate was a pretty, 20-something blonde.\n\nPacking one of the kids off with Wright to the New Orleans set of Law's movie was the perfect trap.\n\nAnd didn't he fall right into it?"
