        "text": "I read about this in Star magazine on Tuesday.\n\nApparently Jude has told Sadie that he has always loved her, and would she be willing to take him back.\n\nDONT DO IT SADIE !!!!\n\n0\n\nMaybe it's because their respective former partners were opposed to the gang bangs they so obviously enjoyed??\n\nI find them a loathesome pair and derserve each other. Sienna Miller seems no better, after playing the part of hard done by, betrayed girlfriend she went and humped Daniel Craig ( I expect, purely to bag a part in the new Bond film). My opinion of her has changed completely since this news came out. Scheming little minx. I hope people pelt her with rotten eggs as she walks the streets in her cutting edge Bay City Rollers loon pants, straightjacket and dunce's cap.\n\nI doubt she did it to get back at Dave- I've heard he prefers boys.\n\nThe only one with any sense seems to be Jackson Scott.\n\n0\n\nSadie seems a bit dishevelled and \"out of it\" these days. Perhaps Jude was a stabilizing influence on her. And they do have about 9 kids don't they? Maybe they owe it to them to try again.\n\n0\n\nTbh, I wouldnt even know who this pair were if it wasnt for the whole divorce/sienna/nanny saga. All I've ever seen her in is the Pulp video and I dont think i've ever seen anything he's done.\n\nThey probably deserve each other.\n\n0\n\nMe neither, but she's been in a Shakespeare play in London hasn't she? Something actors who've been around for years can't get an audition for, but Ms Miller has no trouble getting into after a couple of crappy films and an affair with a double dealing, small d***ed, ugly actor.\n\n0\n\nFancy wrote:\n\nMe neither, but she's been in a Shakespeare play in London hasn't she?

I saw her outside it carrying a the ubiquitous coffee a couple of months ago. Very small, mouse like - about six and a half stone I'd say.\n\n0\n\nitsme25 wrote:\n\nWasnt Sienna in Layer Cake?\n\nI had to laugh at the way people (tended to be men mind ) marvelled at her acting ability when all she had to do was strip off to her black stockings and underwear and bounce up and down on Daniel Craig.\n\nPoor Jude didn't understand that Sienna regards herself as such a dedicated method actor, she had to do numerous retakes to get the scene absolutely right and even when it was in the can, still insisted on rehearsing the scene with her leading man in case the film company ever decided to do reshoots. :cool:\n\n0"
