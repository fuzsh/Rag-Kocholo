        "text": "isnt she a cheater herself? or am I mixing things up\n\nYou are correct, lol.\n\nhttps://people.com/celebrity/balthazar-gettys-wife-forgives-his-affair-with-sienna-miller/\n\n”Here’s the bottom line: It was a very challenging time for everybody involved, but I loved and missed my family too much not to make it work,” the actor, 35, tells Harper’s Bazaar in its October issue, on newsstands Sept. 28. “Rosetta is understanding enough and spiritual enough to let us try.”\n\nOh my God, this absolute fanny. He spoke straight from the Cheating Husband 101 handbook.\n\n(no subject) - pulseraroja Expand\n\nShe cheated with Daniel Craig.\n\n(no subject) - pantless_deacon Expand\n\nyes, what she learned from being betrayed and humiliated by her partner publicly cheating on her was that she wanted to do it to someone else.\n\nI feel like they were simultaneously cheating on each other, him with the nanny, her with Daniel Craig.\n\n(no subject) - pantless_deacon Expand\n\nPeople often say I look like him, that's all I have to contribute\n\nThe hairline?\n\nGIRL\n\n(no subject) - automaticpeople Expand\n\nSince this is a hairline thread, I'm going to see I see Harry Styles' looks going the way of Jude's.\n\nThis is the most violence ONTD's witnessed in a minute. We stan!\n\nJesus somebody 911 the FUCKING BURN UNIT JEEZ\n\n(no subject) - sandstorm Expand\n\nThat was bitchy. I apologise. I’m clearly just a bit hangry.\n\n(no subject) - janetdkd Expand\n\n(no subject) - automaticpeople Expand\n\n(no subject) - janetdkd Expand\n\n(no subject) - automaticpeople Expand\n\n(no subject) - janetdkd Expand\n\n(no subject) - smnp Expand\n\nHis looks are the only good thing about him! When I was a kid, he was a golden god to me. HAIRLINE OR NO HAIRLINE 😤 basically what I’m saying is you’re dishy 💜\n\n(no subject) - janetdkd Expand\n\n(no subject) - kimda Expand\n\n(no subject) - janetdkd Expand\n\nI always picture you looking like Brando. 😏\n\n(no subject) - automaticpeople Expand\n\n(no subject) - doriiansz Expand\n\n(no subject) - janetdkd Expand\n\nYou fine as fuck then. Even with his hairline now he's still delicious.\n\nJude Law, during that period was so hot.\n\nOn a selfish level, 04/05 was my favorite (not best) year, I lived for her and MKA/A’s boho look and vitamin water and iPods were the thing.\n\nWhat’s MKA? When I google it I get Milton Keynes Academy. I don’t think that’s what you meant.\n\nMary Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen.\n\n(no subject) - automaticpeople Expand\n\n(no subject) - lamppost1911 Expand\n\nDragonfruit Vitamin Water and a hot pink gelly skin for my iPod. Those were the days.\n\n(no subject) - lamppost1911 Expand\n\n(no subject) - akillarian Expand\n\n(no subject) - lamppost1911 Expand\n\narmfuls of bangles and GIANT sunglasses will always be stylish to me\n\nA great year for savage gossip, dressing homeless and frying your hair with a flat iron. 10/10 would do again.\n\n(no subject) - lamppost1911 Expand\n\nI remember she was doing a play when the news broke and someone who went to see it said she was good and then at curtail call she started sobbing.\n\nShe was so, so young when she was going through that. Jude is garbage (so is she tbh).\n\nI genuinely cannot comprehend how this was twenty years ago.\n\nI didn't realize she was so young\n\nUm… she’s 42. She has one foot in the grave and another in the urn.\n\nIt's not surprising that Jude Law's a fuck boy, but how does he keep impregnating all these women?! CONDOMS, ROSE, CONDOMS, CONDOMS! It's not that difficult!\n\nAlso lol @ her turning around and having an affair of her own with a married man. 💀 Mess. She's really good in American Woman, though, I will say that.\n\njude law has SEVEN KIDS!!?? AND ONE IS ALMOST THIRTY?\n\nI remember when he was with Sienna, US Weekly and the magazines would cite their names and ages (all under 7).\n\nNow one is a male nepotism model in his 20s and I'm an ONTD Old. Wild to me that they, and all other celebrity kids, have grown up.\n\nNeed to link my favorite ONTD post from that era. I go back to it every couple of years for a laugh.\n\nhttps://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/3516890.html\n\nDang Photobucket, it keeps sending me weekly warning about deleting my accounts if I don't pay for premium. But it also won't let me see all the stored images so I can delete unwanted ones and save old favs."
