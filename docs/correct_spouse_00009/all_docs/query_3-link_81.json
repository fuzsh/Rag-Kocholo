        "text": "LONDON (AP) - Sienna Miller's spokeswoman says the actress and Jude Law have split up for a second time.\n\nPublicist Tori Cook said Wednesday that 29-year-old Miller and the 38-year-old \"Sherlock Holmes\" star are no longer in a relationship.\n\nThe couple met on the set of \"Alfie\" in 2003 and later became engaged, but separated after Law admitted a fling with his children's nanny in 2005. They resumed their relationship in 2009 and had been living together in London.\n\nLaw has three children with his ex-wife, actress and designer Sadie Frost. He also fathered a child in 2009 during a brief relationship with model Samantha Burke."
