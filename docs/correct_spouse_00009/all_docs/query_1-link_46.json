        "text": "Hollywood actor Jude Law tied the knot with his lover on Tuesday.\n\nJude, 46, and business psychologist Phillipa Coan shunned showbiz pals and invited only close family to the low-key ceremony.\n\nThe “Sherlock” star and Phillipa, 32, arrived for the civil ceremony at Old Marylebone Town Hall in central London in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover at 11:40 a.m.\n\nHe was spotted helping his bride-to-be from the black 4×4 before gripping her hand as they made their way up the stone steps for the ceremony.\n\nThey emerged about an hour later with their wedding bands proudly on display then got back into their waiting vehicle without posing for any pictures.\n\nJude was previously married to fellow actress Sadie Frost, 53. They had three children — Rafferty, 22, Iris, 18, and Rudy, 16. They divorced in 2003.\n\nIt later emerged he had been in a relationship with his “Alfie” co-star Sienna Miller.\n\nHe later went out with American model Samantha Burke.\n\nShe had his fourth child Sophia, now 9. Jude became a dad for the fifth time when musician Catherine Harding gave birth to Ada in 2015.\n\nHe met Phillipa three years ago. She runs her own company, Stride, which specializes in improving employees’ performance."
