        "text": "Fancy wrote:\n\nHate the man.\n\nCan't understand why he comes high on a poll of the world's sexiest men.\n\nHe is well below average.\n\nIt's a small world! Restricted to people famous in the West. Usually those polls give you a limited choice so it becomes a self-fufilling prophecy. They never include, say, Bollywood stars or Chinese stars. Yet they must have far more fans than most westerners.\n\nI have never seen Law in real life but he is photogenic. However, in terms of looks, physique and charisma, IMHO, he is not match for Michael Caine at his age.\n\nHis previous pesona appealed to me as the younger man apparently \"happily\" married to his wife with a large family. Then it looked as if Sadie was a wrong-un after the unfortunate incident with their child in that club. The media were siding with poor Jude who, apparently, had so much to put up with.\n\nNow we see that he wasn't sympathetic towards Sadie's baby-blues and is willing to have sex with the hired help whilst newly engaged and accuse his own child of being a liar into the bargain.\n\nNot a nice man.\n\n0\n\nI have to say; whilst I have every sympathy for Sienna as the wronged woman, if I see one more picture of her 'putting on a brave face', I am likely to scream very loudly. Now, I know it's the media painting this picture, but really and truly, you would think she was the worst victim of a crime ever, when actually, she has been shagging an egotistical actor who fancied a bit on the side with the hired help. Yes, she's been through a tough time but she's got a lot more than a lot of people - money, looks and her health for frig's sake.\n\n0\n\ngraemecarter wrote:\n\nRegardless of that, her fiance has just cheated on her! Don't be so callous.\n\nmany people have looks and money and health. Doesn't mean that blokes can sh*t all over them does it?\n\nWell, I might have known you would twist round what I was saying :rolleyes:\n\nI wasn't being callous - I was stating that the media coverage is OTT - regardless of what has happened to her, there are far worse things happening in the world at the moment. Yes, her fiancee has cheated on her but some of the papers are acting like she's the victim of a hideous atrocity or something. My point was about media coverage; which anyone with any semblance of intelligence could have seen without such a knee-jerk reaction.\n\n& at least I didn't state that the whole thing was a publicity stunt which you seemed to be implying the other day (I can't be arsed to trawl through all your posts and quote exactly).\n\n0"
