        "text": "She and Law met while filming \"Alfie\" in 2004 and soon began dating before becoming engaged on Christmas Day in 2004. Law had three young children from his marriage with actress Sadie Frost, who he divorced in 2003, and it was later revealed that Law was cheating on Miller with the nanny of these children.\n\nLaw released statement confessing to the affair in July 2005, and apologized publicly to both Miller and their families. But Miller told The Daily Beast that she still cannot remember \"a whole six weeks of that experience.\"\n\nMiller said: \"I have no recollection of it. People who came to see me said we had dinner, and I don't remember. I was in so much shock over it all. And I'd really just begun. I was only 23. But if you get through that, you feel like you can get through anything.\"\n\nMiller and Law remained together for over a year after the scandal broke, but split in November 2006. However, they did get back together for a while in 2009, and spent Christmas together in 2010, before breaking up permanently in 2011.\n\nWhat made things even harder for Miller was the behaviour of the UK tabloids at that time, which she described as \"paparazzi madness\" and \"an epidemic of bad behaviour.\"\n\nLater, Miller was actually rewarded £100,000 in damages after The News of the World admitted to hacking her phone.\n\nOf the press' behaviour at the time, Miller said: \"There were moments where it came close to making me really feel crazy, and it was incredibly aggressive.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nMiller told The Daily Beast that she was so \"paranoid\" during this time that it \"was hard to think straight.\"\n\nShe said: \"I look back on it and wonder how I did get through it—but I did.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nAll 32 guys who have been named People's Sexiest Man Alive\n\nJude Law says 'it was unusual' that Johnny Depp was ousted from 'Fantastic Beasts 3'"
