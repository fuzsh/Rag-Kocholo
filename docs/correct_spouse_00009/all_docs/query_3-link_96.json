        "text": "After having a baby in late 2023, Sienna has many fans are wondering if she's currently in a relationship.\n\nBy Alizabeth Swain\n\nMay 7 2024, Published 6:05 p.m. ET\n\nIn the whirlwind world of celebrity romances, where relationships blossom and wither under the relentless gaze of the public eye, Sienna Miller is no stranger to having her relationships become the subject of tabloid fodder. (Remember her engagement to Jude Law, which blew up when Jude was caught with his kids' nanny? The early 2000s were a wild time for celeb gossip.)\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWith a history of captivating audiences both on-screen and off, the British-American actress's latest liaison has set the rumor mill abuzz, sparking interest and speculation among fans. So, who is Sienna dating currently?\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWho is Sienna Miller dating?\n\nSienna Miller has been dating actor Oli Green since 2021, after they met at a Halloween party thrown by a mutual friend. Oli has appeared in some well-known projects; you may recognize him from his appearance on The Bold and the Beautiful, or his role on Netflix's smash hit series The Crown (he played Finchey — one of Kate Middleton's boyfriends at St. Andrews, before she got together with William).\n\nSienna and Oli went on to welcome a baby girl together in late 2023 (Sienna also has a daughter named Marlowe, born in July 2012, with ex Tom Sturridge).\n\nAnd in case you're wondering, the Anatomy of a Scandal actress isn't worried about the 14-year age gape between her and Oli.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAs the actress told Vogue (via HuffPost), \"I think that people are comfortable with a way of living that has existed for many years, which is very misogynistic and patriarchal. Me being the older woman in a partnership with a younger person, or being pregnant over 40 ― and that that’s ‘irresponsible’ and ‘the poor child’ ― it’s such double standards, and I think it’s so unquestioned in people’s minds. But it’s absurd.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWith her current relationship in a seemingly much more low-key place than her highly publicized engagement to Jude, it's no wonder that Sienna has referred to the media frenzy around that previous relationship as \"scary.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"I was just catapulted into a totally parallel universe,\" Sienna told Elle U.K. in 2022 (via Yahoo), \"while being in love [with Jude]. There was a lot of magic at that time. At first, it was kind of comical, but very quickly it became insidious and, yeah, scary. And my boyfriend [at the time] had been experiencing it for years and felt, understandably, a lot of hostility towards that kind of attention. So my initial reaction was the same.\"\n\n\"It feels like somebody else's existence,\" she went on, referring to her on-and-off relationship with Jude. \"I can go and visit it and look at it, but it doesn’t feel like my life. I can't quite believe that it all happened. And not to put it specifically on that one thing, but just the chaos of the entire decade is so far removed from my life now.\""
