        "text": "It all started on a couch for Jude Law and Sienna Miller. Specifically, it was on a sofa belonging to Charles Shyer, the director of their new movie together, “Alfie.”\n\n“They met in my living room,” Shyer recently told reporters of Miller’s “Alfie” audition last year. “We drank some wine. Did some screen tests. Then drank some more wine.”\n\nBefore long, the 22-year-old Miller had the biggest part of her still-young career.\n\nAnd while she was on the set of “Alfie” last fall, she bagged a perhaps even greater prize – Law himself.\n\nSince then, the couple have stayed remarkably tight-lipped about the relationship, but very soon we’ll get to see a bit of their chemistry on screen.\n\n“Alfie” opens a week from Friday, and it features some very hot smooching between Law and Miller.\n\n“We have some very steamy scenes, which were a lot of fun,” Miller says.\n\nOf course, the 31-year-old Law has steamy scenes with a harem of women in this big-budget remake of the 1966 Michael Caine classic. He plays the ultimate sophisticated womanizer, and winds up bedding Susan Sarandon, Jane Krakowski, Nona Gaye, Marisa Tomei and more.\n\nThat’s not Law’s style, however, and his relationship with Miller started slowly.\n\n“When they first met,” Shyer told New York magazine, “I think Sienna was a little gaga. But Jude’s a cool customer.”\n\nSo is Miller – at least now.\n\nThis summer, Law took his three children from his marriage to Sadie Frost to Italy to visit Miller, who has been making a movie about Casanova with Heath Ledger and director Lasse Hallstrom.\n\n“I keep reading this quote which says I apparently pinch myself when I wake up with Jude,” Miller told reporters last week. “But it’s not true.”\n\nEver since Law and Miller went public with their romance, the British tabloids have hounded them.\n\nThe constant attention enrages Law, which Shyer used during a scene in “Alfie” when the actor is supposed to punch a limousine’s windshield.\n\n“The windshield’s a paparazzi,” Shyer told his star, and Law hit the glass so hard he cracked it.\n\nMiller isn’t thrilled, either.\n\n“I’m not coping very well with the attention, if I’m honest,” she told reporters at the “Alfie” premiere in London last week.\n\n“I suppose it’s part of the package, but I really haven’t learned to cope. I think you just have to become very thick-skinned and cynical. It’s tough.”\n\nStill, Miller is better prepared for the spotlight than most of us would be, since she grew up around fame.\n\nHer mother is an American ex-model who moved to London in the 1970s, had a fling with David Bowie and wound up running the London branch of the Lee Strasberg school of drama.\n\nHer stepmother is the well-known British interior designer Kelly Hoppen.\n\nMiller wanted to be an actress from the age of three and after some modeling gigs for Pepsi and H&M, she got her first big break in the short-lived TV comedy “Keen Eddie.”\n\nNow that she’s together with Law, many are calling her London’s new It Girl. “It blew me away when I first saw her on camera,” Law has said. “I think she’s extraordinary.”"
