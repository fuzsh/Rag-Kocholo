        "text": "Dec. 2003: Miller and Jude Law film Alfie, a remake of the 1966 film about risqué sexual dalliances. The chemistry between Miller and Law prompts reports of a budding romance. \"I'm really not happy talking about our relationship,\" Miller tells London's Evening Standard. \"It all seems so mad at the moment.\" The movie only grosses $13.4 million, but its stars begin a romantic relationship the following February.\n\n2004: Law proposes to Miller at her Notting Hill apartment, with a $35,000 diamond engagement ring: nine diamonds in a platinum circle set in gold. She accepts. \"I want a big church wedding,\" she tells PEOPLE. \"We haven't set a date yet, but I'm ecstatic. It's always been my dream to marry in white.\"\n\nJuly 2005: Britain's Sunday Mirror prints a detailed account of an affair between Law and his former nanny, Daisy Wright. Later that same day the paper runs a statement from Law: \"I want to publicly apologize to Sienna and our respective families for the pain I've caused. There is no defense for my actions, which I deeply regret, and I ask that you respect our privacy at this very difficult time.\" The next day Miller shows up to work at the Wyndham Theatre without her engagement ring.\n\nAugust 2005: Miller resumes the leading role in the Edie Sedgwick biopic Factory Girl, and on Aug. 17, she and Law are photographed together for the first time since news broke of Law's affair, appearing to be back on. But by October, Law calls the relationship off after reports link Miller with her Layer Cake costar Daniel Craig. The following month, they're back on. \"We're working things out,\" Miller tells Extra.\n\nNov. 2006: Miller and Law finally end their romance. She moves on to promoting Factory Girl, with a cover of Life, where she says she lost her innocence when Law cheated. She also tells PEOPLE that her relationship with Law overshadowed her career.\n\nDec. 2009: While starring in separate plays on Broadway, Miller and former fiancé Jude Law rekindle their romance, with the reunited pair taking their on-again relationship public with a Christmas vacation in Barbados. A year later, Law and Miller call it quits in February 2011. \"It was an entirely an end-of-the relationship decision,\" a friend tells PEOPLE. \"It had run its course.\""
