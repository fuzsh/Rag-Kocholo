        "text": "While Sienna Miller was swept off her feet by Jude Law when they filmed 2003's Alfie together, the actress admitted their romance also took a serious toll on her due to the public's interest.\n\n\"I just started working and I was in a big film and in love with this idol, and very, very happy, but the flip side of it was so dark, so quickly,\" the blonde beauty shared in a new interview.\n\n\"It's so surreal to look back and imagine, or even to look back sometimes and see pictures of the amount of people that were there in my life all the time. It makes you go completely mad, which is ideal for them,\" the actress, 42, explained. \"The more you spiral, the better it is in terms of selling papers, that English thing of just wanting to tear people down. It felt so celebratory.\"\n\nMiller admitted she used alcohol to \"escape\" the drama, but she soon found herself drinking and \"going out\" too much.\n\n\"I'd also watched people behave in the '90s in a way that I thought was how you behaved,\" she explained. \"[Everyone was] having a lot of fun, but that also breeds more panic. It was just an ouroboros of kind of mess.\"\n\n\"That was one of the most challenging moments I hope I’ll ever have to experience,\" she admitted in a 2020 interview. \"Because with that level of public heartbreak, to have to get out of a bed let alone stand in front of 800 people every night, it’s just the last thing you want to do.\"\n\nMiller said she was in \"so much shock\" from the scandal that she blocked some of it from her memory.\n\n\"There’s a whole six weeks of that experience I don’t remember. I have no recollection of it,\" the American Sniper star revealed. \"People who came to see me said we had dinner, and I don’t remember. I was only 23. But if you get through that, you feel like you can get through anything."
