        "text": "Why love sometimes just isn't enough Reports have been circulating that an engagement was imminent for Jude Law and Sienna Miller. But it wasn't meant to be.This week comes the shock news the couple have split for the second time.\n\n\"I can confirm that Jude Law and Sienna Miller are no longer in a relationship,\" a spokesperson said on Wednesday. It is understood they called it a day several weeks ago, despite having just bought a Â£8million London home two months ago. A source told US publication People that the split was amicable, and that the couple remain friends. \"It was entirely an end-of-the relationship decision,\" says the insider. \"It had run its course.\"\n\nJude and Sienna first laid eyes on each other on the set of Alfie in 2003. The attraction was instant and by the time filming ended, they were a couple in real life. They got engaged on Christmas Day the following year but split in 2006 after Jude admitted being unfaithful with his children's nanny. After the break up Sienna went on to date Welsh actor Rhys Ivans. She also had a short romance with US actor and dad-of-four Balthazar Getty, who has since gone back to his wife. Jude, meanwhile, fathered a child with US actress and model Samantha Burke after dating her very briefly while he was filming Sherlock Holmes in New York."
