        "text": "Tabloid scandals come and go, but some are so fully entrenched in celebrity history that we'll never forget them. The Jude Law and Sienna Miller cheating debacle of 2005 is certainly one of those events.\n\nThe actor's nanny came forward to spill the beans about their secret affair, leading Law to release a public statement of apology.\n\nHere's everything that happened.\n\nREAD MORE: Five of the biggest bombshell revelations from Netflix's Anna Nicole Smith documentary\n\nWhat happened to Jude Law and Sienna Miller?\n\nJude Law and Sienna Miller began dating after meeting on the set of their 2004 film Alfie, and got engaged on Christmas Day of the same year.\n\nJust a few months later, news broke that Law had cheated on Miller and slept with their nanny.\n\nHe released a statement reading: \"I just want to say I am deeply ashamed and upset that I've hurt Sienna and the people most close to us. I want to publicly apologise to Sienna and our respective families for the pain that I have caused. There is no defence for my actions which I sincerely regret and I ask that you respect our privacy at this very difficult time.\"\n\nREAD MORE: What happened to Mischa Barton?\n\nWho was the nanny that Jude Law slept with?\n\nIn May 2005, it was reported that the Sherlock Holmes actor was having an affair with Daisy Wright, the nanny of his three kids from his previous marriage to Sadie Frost.\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Kevin Costner's two divorces and his seven children to three different women\n\nAfter Frost confronted Daisy about the affair and fired her from the position, Daisy went to the press and revealed all about her relationship with Law.\n\nDaisy explained that she exposed their affair after being disappointed in the actor: \"I was extremely upset about the way I was dismissed just like that from my job... I felt that Jude should have fought for me.\"\n\nHow long were Jude Law and Sienna Miller together?\n\nMiller was only 23 years old when the affair went public. The couple stayed together, but broke up the following year, in 2006. They briefly reunited in 2009.\n\nMiller has since defended her decision to stay with Law, but maintains that it was one of the hardest times of her life. At the time, she was performing in a play in London with shows every night. \"That was one of the most challenging moments I hope I'll ever have to experience,\" she told Daily Beast in 2020. Because with that level of public heartbreak, to have to get out of a bed let alone stand in front of 800 people every night, it's just the last thing you want to do.\"\n\nThe couple split for good in 2011, and don't remain in contact. She told Porter in 2016: \"We don't see each other that much. I care about him enormously.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Why you never see Jessica Alba on the big screen\n\nREAD MORE: The many loves of Rod Stewart: A deep dive into the rocker's colourful personal life\n\nDid Jude Law stay with the nanny?\n\nAs part of his apology to Sienna Miller, Law cut off communication with Daisy, the nanny with whom he had an affair.
