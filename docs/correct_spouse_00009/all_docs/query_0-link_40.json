        "text": "Though Jude Law is a sex symbol and extremely talented actor, he also has a record and reputation for being a cheater and womanizer. Back in 2006, Law was caught cheating on then-fiance, Sienna Miller, with none other than the nanny! Before they split, Law was married to Sadie Frost, and had relationships with Catherine Harding and Samantha Burke.\n\nEveryone wondered if he would ever tie the knot again and finally commit, but on Tuesday, Law married his long-time girlfriend, Phillipa Coan, in a small ceremony at the Old Marylebone Town Hall in London! Just who is Phillipa Coan? Here are a few things to know about Jude Law’s new wife.\n\n1. She’s not in the entertainment business.\n\nIf you’ve never heard of her name before reports spread of her marriage to Law, well ... it’s because she’s not part of Hollywood inner circles. And guess what? Law loves that she’s not an actress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a Daily Mail article from 2015, a source said, “he's serious about her. He loves how intelligent Pippa [her nickname] is and finds it refreshing to date a girl who is not from his showbiz world. He’s pretty smitten and doesn’t want to mess it up.” We’re glad to hear he that he didn’t mess anything up!\n\n2. They dated for three years before tying the knot.\n\nThough it’s unknown how they met, the couple began dating in 2015 and were first seen together at the Hay Festival, walking the red carpet. Law even commented on his girlfriend at the time, saying to Modern Living, “She’s mine and no one else’s. I’m very, very happy. Our relationship is a very private thing, and I think part of the fact it works so well is exactly because of that.”\n\n3. They married in a small ceremony.\n\nOn April 30th, the couple were seen walking together outside of town hall, with Coan carrying a bouquet of flowers and a ruffled off-white dress, and Law wearing a blazer. About an hour later, they left town hall wearing wedding bands. Sources say that the couple only invited close family and kept things very low-key.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. She's now stepmother to Law’s five kids.\n\nLaw has three children with his ex-wife, Sadie Frost: Rafferty, Iris, and Rudy. He also has one daughter, Sophia, with model Samantha Burke, and another daughter, Ada, with actress and musician Catherine Harding.\n\n5. She’s a psychologist and business founder.\n\nAccording to her website, Coan has a PhD in environmental behavior change. She’s also a member of the British Psychological Society's Division of Occupational Psychology. She even founded and runs her own company, Stride, which “specializes in improving employees’ performance.”\n\nIn addition, her credentials on her website indicate that she’s a Visiting Research Fellow at Leeds University Business School and created Stride to “blend together her strong psychology background with the more technical expertise of energy management specialists.”\n\nAdvertisement"
