        "text": "Burnt star Sienna Miller on how to survive a phone-hacking scandal\n\nI cheated on Sienna: Jude\n\nThey were the on-again off-again hot couple of the noughties and despite Jude Law's highly publicised affair with his children's nanny, his ex-fiancee Sienna Miller does not have a bad word to say about him.\n\n\"We don't see each other that much. I care about him enormously,\" she told the latest issue of Porter magazine.\n\nThe pair first stepped out together in 2004 after meeting on the set of Alfie. They became engaged on Christmas Day that year, but just seven months later the actor was making a public apology about how \"deeply ashamed and upset\" he was for hurting Miller after he was found in bed with the childminder.\n\nMiller, 34, and Law, 43, gave it another go in 2009 but split again in 2011.\n\nLaw is now the father of five children - three with ex-wife Sadie Frost, daughter Sophia with American model Samantha Burke and daughter Ada with Catherine Harding.\n\nWhile the American Sniper star has a daughter, Marlowe, with actor Tom Sturridge, 30, whom she split from last year after a four year relationship.\n\n\"I would love more [children], I'm suddenly feeling very broody for more babies, and my daughter's desperate to have a sibling,\" she said.\n\nRefreshingly, the Burnt star, who currently has two movies in post-production The Lost City of Z and Live by Night, sought therapy after feeling she was not in control of her life although it looked perfect on paper.\n\n\"I just got to a point where I just felt… I didn't understand why I was, I couldn't dig myself out, I couldn't make decisions, I felt pretty assaulted by life and not in control… Without being really indulgent, I think as you get older you have to really cultivate your mind and have a deep understanding of self, otherwise you just become lonely and isolated and unsatisfied and unfulfilled, and however your perfect little life looks on paper, there will be a sense of unfulfillment if you haven't explored the nature, the very depths of who you are.\"\n\nIn May 2011, she was awarded almost $200,000 from the now defunct News of the World after they admitted they hacked her phone. She touched on the early press intrusion, likening her situation to that of the late Amy Winehouse.\n\n\"Thank God I actually survived it. I watched that Amy Winehouse documentary and, not to compare myself, but there was footage that… it was a similar time, and you just lose your mind,\" Miller said."
