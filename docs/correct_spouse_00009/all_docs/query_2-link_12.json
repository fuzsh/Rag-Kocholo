        "text": "One of the quintessential It couples of the early 2000s was definitely Sienna Miller and Jude Law. They were beautiful, successful, and a beloved couple around the world; until things took a majorly sad turn when Law confirmed he cheated on Miller. And now, twenty years after they got together, Miller just opened up about how “dark” their relationship got, and how quickly it all went downhill.\n\nIt’s a tale as old as time in Tinseltown: co-stars fall in love, and then the public can’t get enough of them, and then, oftentimes, that public interest helps with the downfall of their romance; and Miller and Law’s relationship was no different.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones' Gothic Throwback Photo Proves She Was Born to Play Morticia Addams\n\nIn a recent interview with SiriusXM’s This Life of Mine With James Corden, Miller talked about how “surreal” it all was.\n\n“I just started working and I was in a big film and in love with this idol, and very, very happy, but the flip side of it was so dark, so quickly,” she said. “It’s so surreal to look back and imagine, or even to look back sometimes and see pictures of the amount of people that were there in my life all the time. It makes you go completely mad, which is ideal for them.”\n\nShe added, “The more you spiral, the better it is in terms of selling papers, that English thing of just wanting to tear people down. It felt so celebratory.”\n\nShe then went on to discuss the relationship more, saying it was all “madness and chaos.”\n\n“You are dealing with aggression, and violence, and you are a piece of prey and you’re being hunted every day, so you are paranoid,” she said. “The response to that is, for me, I was like, ‘I’m not changing. I’m not gonna give up my life.'”\n\nIt’s so heartbreaking to hear that Miller had such a hard time grappling the public eye, and dealing with this relationship that made her feel like “prey.” But we’re happy she’s thriving now in 2024, and in love with her beau Oli Green.\n\nNow, for those who don’t know, the two first met on the set of the 2004 film Alfie and hit it off right away. They got engaged in 2004, but split up two years later in 2006. Law later admitted to having an affair with his nanny in 2005.\n\nThey briefly got back together in 2009, but split for good in 2011.\n\nBefore you go, click here to see celebrities accused of having affairs with their nannies.\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nFemale Comedians Who Are Killing It Right Now\n\nEvery Celebrity Who Put Their Own Spin on the Little Black Dress Trend\n\nThe Wildest Conspiracy Theories About Prince William & Kate Middleton’s Marriage"
