        "text": "Jude Law is a Hollywood heartthrob well known for his many romances as well as his roles in franchises such as Fantastic Beasts, Sherlock Holmes and Marvel. However, since 2019, The Holiday actor has been happily married to his girlfriend of eight years, Phillipa Coan.\n\nUnlike many of the The Talented Mr Ripley actor's exes, prior to her relationship with the 50-year-old, Phillipa was not used to life in the limelight. Join HELLO! as we look into all there is to know about the psychologist and sustainable business advocate, with whom he now shares two children.\n\nWho is Jude Law's wife?\n\nThe Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald actor is married to Phillipa Coan, a chartered psychologist and behavioral expert with a passion for improving workplace engagement and sustainability. Phillipa and Jude married in 2019 after four years of dating.\n\nA graduate of the University of Birmingham, City University of London and Leeds University, the UK born green business advocate is listed as a visiting research fellow on the website of the University of Leeds – where she completed her PhD in 2015.\n\nMORE: Meet Jude Law's 7 children: Iris, Rafferty and more\n\nDr Coan is an accomplished member of her field, having won the British Psychological Society’s Division of Occupational Psychology's first prize for student excellence for her doctoral research project. She is also a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.\n\nWhat does Phillipa Coan do?\n\nDr. Phillipa Coan describes herself on her Twitter profile as a \"Psychologist, Coach & Behaviour Change Specialist\". She is also the founder of STRIDE, a company focused on offering organisations psychology-based advice which will help them \"energy, carbon and money.\"\n\nSpeaking with Eco-Age in 2019, Phillipa opened up about her journey to founding STRIDE. \"Following my PhD I decided to set up my own company as I couldn’t find other psychologists at the time who were working in the area [of sustainability],\" she told the website.\n\nSEE: Jude Law's son Rafferty sparks major fan reaction with latest photo\n\nSpeaking about her career more widely, the 35-year-old continued: \"I’ve always been fascinated by why people behave in the way they do and so a career in psychology was a no brainer.\" She then went on to explain how seeing a call from the University of Leeds for more business psychologists to apply their knowledge of psychology to the climate crisis inspired her towards her own career. \"I immediately knew it would be a really interesting topic for a PhD and provide a great opportunity to learn more about sustainability,\" she said.\n\nHow did Jude Law meet Phillipa Coan?\n\nThe Captain Marvel actor met his future-wife in 2015. The couple were first seen out and about together in public at the Hay Festival in May that year. After just over a year of dating, Jude delightedly told Modern Luxury magazine: \"She's mine and no one else's… I'm very, very happy. Our relationship is a very private thing, and I think part of the fact it works so well is exactly because of that.\"\n\nPhillipa and Jude have indeed kept their relationship very private. As a result, little is known about the couple's time together. The couple married on April 9, 2019, during a private ceremony in Old Marylebone Town Hall.\n\nDISCOVER: Jude Law and Phillipa Coan attend Wimbledon alongside other celebrities\n\nIn December 2020, the actor confirmed that he and Phillipa had welcomed a child together during the pandemic while making an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. The 50-year-old explained that the pandemic restrictions had made their first child's (but Jude's sixth) birth \"unusual\" but then noted: \"We feel pretty blessed that we were in a time, that… we could just nest and enjoy each other's company.\"\n\nIt has since been reported that Jude has welcomed a second child with Phillipa too, although the couple are yet to publicly announce the birth of this baby.\n\nWho was Jude Law's first wife?\n\nJude Law was married to British actor, fashion designer and producer Sadie Frost from 1997 to 2003. The couple had three children, sons Rafferty and Rudy, and a daughter, Iris.\n\nAfter his divorce from the actress, who he met filming the 1994 film Shopping, the Fantastic Beasts franchise actor began dating and got engaged to The Girl actress Sienna Miller. However, the two never married, and split after Jude admitted to having an affair with his children's nanny.\n\nMORE: Nepo babies dominating the fashion world: Iris Law, Kaia Gerber, Lila Moss & more\n\nIn 2009, the Sherlock Holmes actor had a fourth child with Samantha Burke, with whom he had a brief romance in 2008. Then in 2015, Jude had a fifth child with Catherine Harding, although again the singer and actor were not together for long.\n\nRead more HELLO! US stories here"
