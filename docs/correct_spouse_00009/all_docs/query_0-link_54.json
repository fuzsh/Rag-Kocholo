        "text": "Sienna Miller has recalled being so traumatised by the Jude Law cheating scandal that she ‘can’t remember’ going through the six-week ordeal.\n\nThe 21 Bridges actress was devastated when reports emerged that Alfie actor Jude had been having an affair with his children’s nanny in 2005.\n\nAfter meeting on the set of Alfie in 2003, the couple got engaged the following Christmas but the cheating scandal ended their whirlwind romance in 2006.\n\nReflecting on the scandal, Sienna told the Daily Beast: ‘It was really hard. And the other thing was, it was at the height of all that paparazzi madness, and in London where there was an epidemic of bad behavior. They knew where I would be every night\n\n‘That was one of the most challenging moments I hope I’ll ever have to experience. Because with that level of public heartbreak, to have to get out of a bed let alone stand in front of 800 people every night, it’s just the last thing you want to do.’\n\nHowever, Sienna, 38, admits that she has ‘no recollection’ of six weeks of ‘that experience’. The actress reveals how friends have told of how they went to visit her during that time but it still hasn’t rejigged her memory.\n\n‘I was in so much shock over it all. And I’d really just begun. I was only 23. But if you get through that, you feel like you can get through anything,’ she said.\n\nDespite splitting after the cheating scandal, Sienna and Jude reunited in 2009 before splitting again in 2011.\n\nJude, 47, issued a public apology to Sienna after he was found to have cheated, and said in a statement at the time: ‘Following the reports in today’s papers, I just want to say I am deeply ashamed and upset that I’ve hurt Sienna and the people most close to us.\n\n‘I want to publicly apologise to Sienna and our respective families for the pain that I have caused.\n\n‘There is no defence for my actions which I sincerely regret and I ask that you respect our privacy at this very difficult time.’\n\nThe nanny looked after the three children Jude shared with ex-wife Sadie Frost – Rafferty, Iris and Rudy.\n\nSince then, Jude has gone on to have three other children – Sophia, 10, with Samantha Burke, Ada, five, with Catherine Harding and another with current wife Phillipa Coan.\n\nSienna is also a mother to eight-year-old daughter Marlowe who she shares with former fiance Tom Sturridge. She is currently dating Lucas Zwirner.\n\nGot a showbiz story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : I’m A Celebrity 2020: Vernon Kay and Tess Daly finally reunite after five weeks apart"
