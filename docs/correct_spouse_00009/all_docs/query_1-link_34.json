        "text": "Jude Law is expecting baby number 6 with his new wife, Phillipa Coan, whom he wed last year. The pair were together for four years before they tied the knot in February 2019.\n\nActor Jude Law and his new wife, Phillipa Coan, are ready to welcome their first child together! After a previous marriage, two relationships and five children, Jude is excited to welcome a sixth child with his current wife, Phillipa.\n\nJude Law and Phillipa Coan watch on as Roger Federer of Switzerland plays Milos Raonic of Canada in the Men's Singles Semi Final match on day eleven of the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club on July 8, 2016 in London, England. | Photo: Getty Images\n\nAs reported by Daily Mail, Phillipa Coan, looking beautiful as ever, was spotted with her baby bump, visible in a tight black top, grocery shopping with her husband of over a year.\n\nSince the 1st of May 2019, Law and Coan have been blissfully married following a classified wedding ceremony at The Old Marylebone Town Hall in London.\n\nThis development comes as no news, as the \"Sherlock Holmes\" actor, had months before this sighting, revealed that he would absolutely love to have more children and have a lot of fun parenting with someone he so dearly loves. In an interview, Jude declared:\n\nâI'm fortunate to be with someone where I'm having more fun than I've ever had in my life.â\n\nJude is also said to be a great father and have a working relationship with his ex-wife, baby mamas and their children. In this report, ET Online states that everyone is happy, for the couple, about the new baby that will be a great addition to the family.\n\nJude is father to 23-year old Rafferty, 19-year old Iris, 17-year old Rudy, 10-year old Sophia and 5-year old Ada. He had the first three children, two boys and a girl, with ex-wife, Sadie Frost and the last two girls with the model, Samantha Burke and musician, Catherine Harding respectively.\n\nJude Law And Children In A London Park on October 06, 2003 | Photo: Getty Images\n\nPhillipa and Jude dated for over four years before their engagement in February 2019. Jude is Phillipaâs first husband, and from the pictures, she looked happy, healthy and prepared to receive her first child.\n\nIt is no secret that the actorâs romantic life has been a rollercoaster; from his divorce with his first wife, Sadie Frost, to a relationship with Sienna Miller that went sour because of his affair with his childrenâs nanny, Daisy Wright. There were also the brief romantic dealings with Samantha Burke and Catherine Harding that resulted in children.\n\nThe 47-year oldâs second marriage was reportedly quiet and attended by only family and close friends. Since May 1, 2019, Law and Coan have been blissfully married following a classified wedding ceremony at The Old Marylebone Town Hall in London.\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtncm5ka3qrwcOeZKWZp2LEprjCqKSeZZKWr7p5za6km52iYoNuucSeq2agmah7qcDMpQ%3D%3D"
