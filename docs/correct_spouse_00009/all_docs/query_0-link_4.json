        "text": "Sienna Miller has opened up about her breakup from ex-fiancé Jude Law, more than 10 years after his affair with his children's nanny.\n\nIn a new interview with The Daily Beast, the actor reflected on her high-profile split and spoke candidly about dealing with the infamous cheating scandal in 2005. Miller basically revealed that she blocked out much of what happened in the fallout from Law's affair due to the shock. “There’s a whole six weeks of that experience that I don’t remember. I have no recollection of it,” she recalled, per People. ”People who came to see me said we had dinner, and I don’t remember.”\n\nThe Golden Globe nominee added, “I was in so much shock over it all. And I’d really just begun. I was only 23. But if you get through that, you feel like you can get through anything.”\n\nMiller and Law met in 2003 on the set of the film Alfie and quickly become one of Hollywood's power couples. They got engaged on Christmas 2004 after nearly a year of dating; however, Miller broke the engagement following Law's infidelity. They reportedly reunited in late 2009 but split up again in February 2011.\n\nMiller also acknowledged that the constant news coverage made things so much more difficult. “The other thing was, it was at the height of all that paparazzi madness,” she said, “and in London, where there was an epidemic of bad behavior, they knew where I would be every night.”\n\nShe describes the entire ordeal as “one of the most challenging moments” in her life. “Because with that level of public heartbreak, to have to get out of a bed, let alone stand in front of 800 people every night, it’s just the last thing you want to do,” she said."
