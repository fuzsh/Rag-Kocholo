        "text": "Sienna Miller has reflected on her relationship with her ex Jude Law and how it protected her from the possibility of sexual harassment from convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein.\n\nIn a new interview with The Guardian, the ELLE UK cover star said: ‘I was Jude’s girlfriend, and there was probably protection in that.'\n\nThe Anatomy Of A Scandal star continued, noting that Law was a ‘big actor for Harvey’, having previously starred in Weinstein-produced films such as Cold Mountain and The Talented Mr. Ripley. ‘I called Harvey “Pops” from day one, which I’m sure helped; you’re not going to wank on that.’\n\nMiller and Law met in 2003 on the set of their film Alfie and became engaged a year later. In 2005 the Amercian-British actor broke off their engagement after news came to light of Law’s cheating. The pair are believed to have rekindled their romance in 2009 but split once again two years later.\n\nIn March 2020 Weinstein was sentenced to prison for 23 years for rape and sexual assault, three years after The New York Times published a story detailing years of allegations of sexual harassment against the disgraced producer.\n\nWhile Miller wasn’t a victim of Weinstein’s sexual assault, she did recall being shouted at by him.\n\n‘I was rehearsing one day with Steve Buscemi, and Harvey called and asked me to come to his office. I said, I’m in rehearsal. And he shouted, “NOW!” and sent a car. He sat me down in his office and said, “You’re not f*cking going out any more, you’re not partying, rah rah rah”.’\n\n‘I was having a lot of fun, but I managed to go to work on time. And he was standing over me while I was sitting in a chair, lip quivering, and then he slammed the door, and I burst into tears. And then he came back in and said: “It’s because I’m f*cking proud of you.” And slammed the door again.’\n\nRecalling his behaviour, Miller said that being shouted at by Weinstein almost felt like an honour.\n\n‘You weren’t really inaugurated until Weinstein made you cry,’ she noted. ‘I imagined this is what Hollywood producers were like. I genuinely felt he’d given me the biggest validation. I was so grateful. I wasn’t scared of him, actually. And I was not aware that he was raping people. He asked for one meeting with me in a hotel, and I brought the other producers and it was innocuous. I’ve never been propositioned by anyone, for a job.’\n\nMiller currently stars in the hit six-part Netflix series Anatomy of a Scandal, in which she plays an English cabinet minister’s (played by Rupert Friend) wife. The 40-year-old stars opposite Michelle Dockery and Naomi Scott."
