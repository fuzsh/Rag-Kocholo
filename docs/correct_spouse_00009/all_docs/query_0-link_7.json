        "text": "Sienna Miller has opened up about her experience of being cheated on, years after ex Jude Law's affair in a candid new interview.\n\nThe 40-year-old dated fellow actor Jude, 49, from 2003 to 2005, getting engaged on Christmas Day 2004. The pair split in July 2005 thanks to a very public scandal, with Jude revealed to have cheated on fiancée Sienna with his kids' nanny, Daisy Wright.\n\nNow, Sienna has publicly reflected on the cheating scandal while discussing her upcoming Netflix show Anatomy of a Scandal. The series sees Sienna playing Sophie Whitehouse, the wife of an MP, who discovers her husband James (Rupert Friend) has been accused of rape by a colleague he’d had an affair with.\n\nOpening up about her own experiences in a new interview with ELLE UK, Sienna told the publication, \"it was familiar terrain, because I’ve experienced some of the things that she experienced. And the feelings were familiar.\"\n\nShe went on, \"[But] her way of dealing with what’s thrown at her is the absolute antithesis of what my way is. And so, in a kind of twisted, tourism sense, I just wanted to see how it would feel to react differently. I know that sounds weird,’ she adds, ‘because you’d think it would be deeply unpleasant to sit in that space.\"\n\nDescribing how it felt to film the scene in which Sophie finds out about James' affair, Sienna explained, \"I had a mic on my chest and there’s a heartbeat that comes in. It was my actual heartbeat being picked up by the monitor, getting faster and faster.\"\n\nRevealing that she drew from her own experience for the scene, she added, \"It made me think, remember and put myself back in that position,\" laughing, \"I really must need help, if this is what I enjoy doing!\"\n\nGoing on to draw more parallels between the show and her own life, Sienna continued, \"it was weirdly interesting to kind of step back in and... There is something cathartic, I suppose, about spending time in an ugly space that’s familiar. And maybe reclaiming it? I don’t know what the psychology of it is. But there is something where maybe you can substitute a memory with something else.\"\n\nSienna also shared details on the fame and attention she received while dating Jude, saying, \"I was just catapulted into a totally parallel universe while being in love [with Law]. There was a lot of magic at that time. At first, it was kind of comical, but very quickly it became insidious and, yeah, scary. And my boyfriend [at the time] had been experiencing it for years and felt, understandably, a lot of hostility towards that kind of attention. So my initial reaction was the same.\"\n\nWhen Jude's affair first came to light, the actor made a public apology to Sienna in a statement released via the British Press Association.\n\nHe said, \"Following the reports in today’s papers, I just want to say I am deeply ashamed and upset that I’ve hurt Sienna and the people most close to us. I want to publicly apologise to Sienna and our respective families for the pain that I have caused. There is no defense for my actions which I sincerely regret and I ask that you respect our privacy at this very difficult time.\"\n\nAnatomy of a Scandal is released on Netflix on 15th April.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
