LONDON (AP) - Sienna Miller's spokeswoman says the actress and Jude Law have split up for a second time.

Publicist Tori Cook said Wednesday that 29-year-old Miller and the 38-year-old "Sherlock Holmes" star are no longer in a relationship.

The couple met on the set of "Alfie" in 2003 and later became engaged, but separated after Law admitted a fling with his children's nanny in 2005. They resumed their relationship in 2009 and had been living together in London.

Law has three children with his ex-wife, actress and designer Sadie Frost. He also fathered a child in 2009 during a brief relationship with model Samantha Burke.
