JUDE Law's former fiancee Sienna Miller was supported by the actor's ex-wife Sadie Frost at a performance of her new play in London.

The pair were spotted at the Apollo Theatre along with Jude's son Rafferty and they all headed home together.

Sienna, 35, who dated Jude for three years until their split in 2006, seems to have maintained friendly relations with the actor's ex-wife.

Sadie was seen lending her support to the younger actress at a performance of her play Cat On A Hot Tin Roof.

They were pictured heading out of the venue together with Sadie and Jude's eldest son Rafferty, 20.

Sienna dressed down in an all-black outfit, and Sadie looked striking in a pair of orange trousers.

Rafferty, who looks just like his famous dad, wore a denim jacket over a black top and was seen playing on his phone as he left the theatre.

He is Jude and Sadie's eldest child from their six-year marriage, which ended in 2003.

After the divorce, Jude went on to strike up a relationship with his Alfie co-star Sienna, who he met on the set of the remake.

The romance grabbed headlines and propelled Sienna to a new level of stardom, and they looked set for a fairytale ending when Jude proposed on Christmas Day, 2004.

But the relationship was doomed and fell apart before they could walk down the aisle after Jude had an affair with his children's nanny.

He issued a public apology for cheating, but it was not enough to save the relationship and the couple split in November 2006.

Jude went on to father a love child with US model Samantha Burke in 2009 before he briefly rekindled his romance with Sienna.

They split for a second time in February, 2011 and Law became a father again in 2014 following a fling with Catherine Harding.

Sienna went on to date actor Tom Sturridge and they became parents to a daughter named Marlowe in 2012.
