California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights Beginning January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the “CCPA”) provides California residents with certain additional rights regarding the collection, use and sharing of their Personal Data as described below. The terms used in this section have the meanings given to them in the CCPA, which may be broader than their common meaning. Please note your right to know and right to delete are subject to certain exceptions under the CCPA.\n\nRight to Know\n\nYou have the right to request to know the categories and specific pieces of Personal Data we have collected about you over the past twelve (12) months, as well as information about how we collect, use, disclose, “share” and “sell” Personal Data. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Your CCPA Rights below), we will disclose to you:\n\n• The categories of Personal Data we have collected about you;\n\n• The categories of sources from which we collect Personal Data;\n\n• The categories of Personal Data about you we disclosed for a business purpose or sold (if applicable);\n\n• The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling (if applicable) that Personal Data;\n\n• The categories of third parties to whom the Personal Data was disclosed for a business purpose or sold (if applicable) that Personal Information; and\n\n• The specific pieces of Personal Data we have collected about you (also called a data portability request).\n\nRight to Delete\n\nYou have the right to request deletion of your Personal Data that we collected from you and retained, though exceptions under the CCPA may allow us to retain and use Personal Data notwithstanding your deletion request. For example, we may retain Personal Data (i) as permitted by law, such as for tax or other record keeping purposes. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Your CCPA Rights below), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Data from our records, unless an exception applies.\n\nRight to Correct\n\nYou have a right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information we maintain about you.\n\nRight to Opt-Out of Sharing\n\nYou have a right to direct us not to share your Personal Information. You may opt out of such sharing by setting your cookie preferences via Cookies Settings . For information on how we process opt-out preference signals, please see our Cookie Policy.\n\nRight to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.\n\nYou have a right to direct us to limit our use and/or disclosure of sensitive Personal Information to only what is necessary to provide the services to you. To exercise this right, please contact us as set out below.\n\nExercising Your CCPA Rights\n\nTo exercise your rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:\n\n• Calling our Privacy Hotline at +1 800.940.4948; or\n\n• Emailing us at privacy@platinumequity.com\n\nIn the request, please specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of your request. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Data or an authorized representative. We may require specific information from you that allows us to verify your identify and process your request. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to register with us. We will only use Personal Data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.\n\nYou can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. However, we will require written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly.\n\nResponse Timing and Format\n\nWe will aim to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding receipt of the verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.\n\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.\n\nNon-Discrimination\n\nWe will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not: (i) deny you goods or services, (ii) charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties, (iii) provide you a different level or quality of goods or services, (iv) or suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.\n\nSelling and/or Sharing of Personal Information\n\nWe do not “sell” (as defined under the CCPA) your Personal Information. We do, however, “share” (as defined under the CCPA) certain categories of Personal Information and, in the preceding 12 months, we have shared identifiers and internet or other electronic network activity collected via cookies and beacons with online advertising service providers such as LinkedIn for the purposes of performing targeted marketing and serving targeted advertising. You may opt out of such sharing by setting your cookie preferences via Cookies Settings . Regarding California residents under 16 years of age, we do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” (as those terms are defined under the CCPA and used throughout this section) Personal Information of residents under 16 years of age.\n\n8.3. Residents of Other U.S. States\n\nIf you are a California resident, please see section 8.2 above for information on your rights in relation to information that we have collected about you. If you are a resident of another U.S. state, depending on the state you live in, you may have some or all of the rights listed below in relation to information that we have collected about you. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law, including in the event you reside in a state that does not currently grant you these rights.\n\n• Right to Access. You may have a right to request that we confirm whether we process information about you and give you access to that information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the information to another business without impediment.\n\n• Right to Delete. You may have a right to request that we delete information we maintain about you.\n\n• Right to Correct. You may have a right to request that we correct inaccurate information we maintain about you.\n\n• Right to Opt-out of Targeted Advertising. You may have a right to opt-out of the processing of your information for the purposes of targeted advertising, the profiling of your information in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, and/or the sale of your information (as all such terms and concepts are defined under applicable law). For information on how we process opt-out preference signals, see our Cookie Policy.\n\nYou may exercise any of these rights by contacting us using the information provided below in Section 13. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights. We may need to collect information from you to verify your identity before providing a substantive response to the request. Depending on your location, you may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney document, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require that the agent provide proof you have authorized them to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.\n\nIn addition, you may have the right to appeal our decision regarding a request related to these rights by contacting us using the information provided below. When you submit a request or launch an appeal, we will limit our collection of your information to only what is necessary to securely fulfil your request or process your appeal. We will not require you or your authorized agent to pay a fee for the verification of your request or appeal.\n\n8.4. California Shine the Light. Separate from the CCPA, California’s Shine the Light law gives California residents the right to request a notice disclosing the categories of Personal Data we have shared with third parties, for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, during the preceding twelve (12) months. To make a request, please email us by clicking here and indicate in your email that you are making a \"Data Sharing\"; inquiry."
