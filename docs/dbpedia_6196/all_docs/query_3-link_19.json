        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- The Detroit Pistons' visit to play the Los Angeles Lakers came with an added benefit -- a chance to visit Platinum Equity's Beverly Hills offices and meet with owner Tom Gores.\n\nThe visit lasted a bit more than an hour Saturday evening. There was food aplenty, football games to watch on television, and a custom-made gift for each player: Ostrich-skin Pistons caps.\n\n\"I love that hat,\" Greg Monroe said. \"It's a really nice hat. It's unique. It's definitely a great thing to have.\"\n\nWhile a mandatory visit to a function thrown by the boss isn't exactly the kind of respite many players would prefer in the middle of a six-game road swing through the Western Conference, Monroe said the Pistons appreciated the party and the gesture.\n\n\"It's always good when you can just relax and just relate to your owner on a different level than just as a player and an owner,\" he said. \"He's a great person. He cares about us in life, period, not just basketball, and that's important. He really does care and I think he's real genuine about it. That's why he did that thing, just to show that this is more to him than just basketball.\"\n\nMonroe had attended a similar shindig thrown by Gores before. Kyle Singler hadn't.\n\nIn fact, Singler hadn't met Gores before Saturday, but said he was impressed by his boss and that \"his head and heart are in the right position.\"\n\n\"Everything he did was first class,\" Singler said. \"Everything that we have is first class, too. It just shows that he cares, bringing the team in to have a meeting. It was my first time at an event like this, so I really don't have anything to compare it to, but I think it was well done, and for him to do that just shows his level of commitment.\"\n\nGores worked the room, greeted players, then addressed them as a group for what Singler estimated to be 20-30 minutes.\n\n\"It was like a lot of fatherly advice to us,\" Singler said. \"He just wanted to let us know he's committed to the team and he appreciates what we're doing for him, and his passion for what he's doing.\"\n\nHead coach Lawrence Frank said he appreciated Gores' efforts and added that, \"When you open the curtain and see the real guy behind him, you can't help but be impressed with who he is.\"\n\n\"Tom is a very, very real guy,\" Frank said. \"I think it was great. He just wanted to have the team over, just in a very casual setting, and just spend some time in talking to them, both individually and as a group, and just for them to see what he's all about and why he is the owner, and his motivation.\n\n\"I thought our guys got a lot out of it, because when you look at it, especially for guys who have been in the league a while, they appreciate it even more because you don't really get an opportunity in these situations to get to know your owner.\""
