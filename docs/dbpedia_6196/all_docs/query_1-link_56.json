Through our investments, we enable current company owners to meet their needs for capital, liquidity and diversification.\n\nWe believe that private equity is a relationship business, not a transactional one. We strive to treat everyone, including our managers, intermediaries and service providers, like partners.\n\nWe know that earnings growth is the most important factor in a successful investment. We provide our partner companies with the capital, guidance, strategy, and operational support needed to create additional value.\n\nActing with integrity is the fundamental principle guiding all of our actions."
