        "text": "Private Equity is an essential part in understanding the concepts of Finance. There are two types of sources available for any company to raise money; one if equity and the other is debt. Wherein, Equity is further divided into two (2) parts; Public Equity and Private Equity.\n\nWhen a company issues shares through IPO or through any public market, then the equity raised is termed as a Public Equity. However, when it is raised through Private sources or through institutions in a private company, then it is called Private Equity.\n\nThere are various Private Equity Funds that are available across the globe and constantly look for opportunities in private space for funding. Typically Private Equity Investors earn more returns through investing in private companies as they invest in growth companies and not the already matured ones. Their investment tenure varies as per the fund strategy and majority of the private equity players take exit either through IPO or strategic sales.\n\nLike Investment Banking companies, Private Equity Companies or Private Equity fund houses are located in tier- 1 cities only (major hub in Mumbai). If you’re looking to join a Private Equity Company as well, then you are required to shift to tier 1 cities only.\n\nLIST OF TOP PRIVATE EQUITY COMPANIES IN INDIA\n\n(I) INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS HAVING PRESENCE IN INDIA\n\n1.
