        "text": "Heat affects everyone. Due to the heat island effect, people who live in cities are more at risk than those in suburban or rural areas. What’s more, some areas within a city are often hotter than others. These neighborhood-level hotspots are called “intra-urban” heat islands. Intra-urban heat islands are caused by the uneven, inequitable spread of landcovers in the urban landscape, leading to more heat-absorbing buildings and pavements and fewer cool spaces with trees and greenery.\n\nResidents of intra-urban heat islands are more likely to experience heat-related illnesses and even death. Related negative effects include worse air quality and a higher cost burden of air conditioning bills.\n\nThis page explores the reasons behind these inequities, their trends and consequences, and solutions.\n\nOn this page:\n\nWhy are heat islands inequitable?\n\nWhat are the health consequences of heat islands and inequity?\n\nWhat are the financial inequities created by heat islands?\n\nHow can local governments effectively address heat inequity?\n\nWhat are examples of city heat equity programs?\n\nWhy are heat islands inequitable?\n\nResearchers have found that intra-urban heat islands are often linked to demographic factors such as income and race. An EPA review of several studies found that some communities in the United States, particularly those that are low-income and with higher populations of people of color, have neighborhoods with higher temperatures relative to adjacent neighborhoods in the same city. The studies identify historic redlining as a contributing factor. Specifically, people of color and community members with low incomes are more likely than other groups to live in historically redlined neighborhoods that are present-day intra-urban heat islands.\n\nWhat are the health consequences of heat islands and inequity?\n\nThe hotter conditions of heat islands and demographic inequities intersect with other risk factors. In particular, air quality worsens on hot, sunny days. A reaction between sunlight and air pollutants forms more ground-level ozone, or smog. Asthma is more common among some communities of color and low-income households than the general population, putting these populations at greater risk from hotter temperatures, air pollution, and the smog formed under these conditions.\n\nWhat are the financial inequities created by heat islands?\n\nExcessive heat is a financial burden for many people, especially low-income households. For instance, about 30% of all U.S. households report that they have difficulty paying energy bills or that they are unable to cool their homes due to cost concerns.iii Low-income households also tend to live in less energy-efficient homes that are more expensive to cool.iv The inability to afford household energy needs, or “energy insecurity,” makes it harder to stay cool, comfortable, and healthy during periods of extreme heat.\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\nChakraborty, T., A.
