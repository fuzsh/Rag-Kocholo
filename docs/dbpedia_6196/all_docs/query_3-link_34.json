Such notice shall state the date, time, place and purpose of the second session of the Board. The failure to give any such notice or of the owner to receive it shall not invalidate any assessment roll or assessment thereon.\n\nThe Board of Review shall convene in its second session on the Tuesday following the fourth (4th) Monday in March of each year at such time of day and place as shall be designated by the Council and shall continue in session until all interested persons have had an opportunity to be heard, but in no case for less than eight (8) hours.

After the Board of Review has completed its review of the assessment roll, and not later than the first Monday, in April, the majority of its members shall endorse thereon and sign a statement to the effect that the same is the assessment roll of the Village for the year in which it has been prepared. The omission of such endorsement shall not affect the validity of such roll.

The Assessor shall also spread the amounts of the general ad valorem village tax according to and in proportion to the several valuations set forth in said assessment roll. To avoid fractions in computation on any tax roll, the Assessor may add to the amount of the several taxes to be raised not more than the amounts prescribed by statute. Any excess created thereby on any tax roll shall belong to the Village.\n\nTAX ROLL CERTIFIED FOR COLLECTION:\n\nSECTION 9.13. After spreading the taxes the Assessor shall certify the tax roll, and the President shall annex a warrant thereto directing and requiring the Treasurer to collect prior to March first (1st) of the following year from the several persons named in said tax roll the several sums mentioned therein opposite their respective names as a tax or assessment and granting to the Assessor, for the purpose of collecting the taxes, assessments and charges on such roll all statutory powers and immunities possessed by township treasurers for the collection of taxes. On June twenty-fifth (25th), the roll shall be delivered to the Treasurer for collection.\n\nTAX LIEN ON PROPERTY:\n\nSECTION 9.14. On July first, the taxes thus assessed shall become a debt due to the Village from the persons to whom they are assessed and the amounts assessed on any interest in real property shall become a lien upon such real property, for such amounts and for all interest and charges thereon, and all personal taxes shall become a first lien on all personal property of such persons so assessed.

All taxes paid on or before September fourteenth of each year shall be collected by the Treasurer without collection fee. On September fifteenth, the Treasurer shall add to all taxes paid thereafter a collection fee of one percent (1%) of the amount of said taxes, plus one percent (1%) per month thereafter. Such collection fee shall belong to the Village and constitute a charge and shall be a lien against the property to which the taxes themselves apply, collectible in the same manner as the taxes to which they are added. {Amended March 2004}\n\nDELINQUENT TAX ROLL TO COUNTY TREASURER:\n\nSECTION 9.17. If the Treasurer has been unable to collect any of the Village taxes on said roll on real property before the first day of March following the date when said roll was received, it shall be the Treasurer's duty to return all such unpaid taxes on real property to the county treasurer in the same manner and with like effect as returns by townships treasurers of township, school, and county taxes. Such returns shall be made upon a delinquent tax roll to be prepared by the Treasurer and shall include all the additional charges and fees hereinbefore provided, which charges shall, in such returns, be added to the amount assessed in said tax roll against each description.

In the case of a contract obligating the Village to periodic payments in future fiscal years for the furnishing of a continuing service or the leasing of property, such certification shall not cover those payments on the contract which will be due in future fiscal years, but this exception shall not apply to a contract for the construction of a public improvement unless such public improvement is being purchased by installment payments under the provisions of Section 10.6. A copy of all contracts requiring such certification shall be filed in the office of the Clerk.
