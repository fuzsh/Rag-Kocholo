Since our founding in 1992, we have developed a distinct position in the industry, with a broadly diversified set of investment strategies, including private equity, impact, credit, real estate, and market solutions.\n\nTPG puts capital to work through six platforms. Throughout our history, we have grown organically into opportunities we identified through deep thematic work in key sectors and geographies, and through strategic acquisitions to diversify our offerings."
