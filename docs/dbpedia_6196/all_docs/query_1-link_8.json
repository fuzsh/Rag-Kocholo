Platinum Equity is a global private equity firm that specializes in mergers, acquisitions, and operations of companies that provide mission-critical products, services, and solutions in diverse industries. Platinum Equity offers deep in-house resources and flexible acquisition solutions to sellers worldwide.\n\nM&A&O®\n\nM&A&O is Platinum Equity’s signature strategy. It applies operational insight to the traditional M&A process to find and create value. From diligence through deal execution, the Operations Team works with the M&A teams to go deep into the details. This collaboration and expertise provides a better understanding of the business, and often uncovers hidden value.

Platinum’s in-house business development, M&A, transition, legal, real estate, marketing, finance, and operations teams enable it to resolve complex issues quickly. The firm, which funded its initial investments with founder’s capital, has raised more than $25 billion from institutional investors since launching its funds business a decade-and-a-half ago. Platinum Equity raised its first private equity fund in 2004 with $700 million in capital commitments. That was followed by Fund II with $2.75 billion in 2007, Fund III with $3.75 billion in 2012, Fund IV with $6.5 billion in 2016 and now Fund V with $10 billion. The firm also manages a $1.5 billion Small Cap Fund pursuing similar private equity investments in the lower middle market.\n\nAcquisition Solutions\n\nPlatinum Equity structures acquisition solutions to help sellers achieve their divestiture objectives.
