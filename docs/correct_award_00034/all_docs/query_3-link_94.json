        "text": "Bengt Samuelsson, who has died aged 90, shared the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with his fellow Swede Sune Bergström and the British pharmacologist Sir John Vane for their work on prostaglandins, biochemical compounds that influence a huge range of physiological processes in mammals.\n\nIt was another Swedish Nobel laureate, Ulf von Euler, who named the substances prostaglandins in the 1930s after he detected them in semen and assumed that they came from the prostate gland. In fact they are fatty acids formed in cells throughout the body, especially in periods of illness, stress or injury.\n\nAmong a bewildering range of functions, prostaglandins have been found to regulate blood pressure and circulation, body temperature, the transmission of nerve impulses, allergic reactions and muscle and uterine contractions. And they are implicated in many illnesses: excess production of prostaglandins causes such ailments as headaches, fever, blood clots, menstrual cramps, inflammation and some aberrations in the immune response.\n\nBergström was the first to make breakthroughs in the 1960s when he purified several prostaglandins, determined their chemical structure and showed that they were formed from unsaturated fatty acids.\n\nVane discovered a subtype, now called prostacyclin, which is implicated in the formation of blood clots that may lead to heart attacks and strokes. He also discovered that aspirin almost completely blocks prostaglandin formation, thereby reducing fever, pain and inflammation.\n\nSamuelsson, a former student of Bergström’s at the University of Lund, was cited for giving a detailed picture of arachidonic acid, from which all the many dozens of prostaglandins are created, for clarifying the chemical processes involved in the formation and the body’s use of prostaglandins, and for discovering various subtypes.\n\nThe three scientists’ work laid the foundation for huge advances in medicine and drug development, helping to revolutionise the treatment of high blood pressure, blood clots and other circulatory problems, asthma, allergies, peptic ulcers, gallstones and kidney stones. In obstetrics and gynaecology, natural and synthetically produced prostaglandins are used to relieve pain from menstruation, to treat obstetric complications, start labour and induce abortion.\n\nReflecting on how breakthrough scientific discoveries stimulate further activity, Samuelsson found an analogy in the insect world: “It is like the ant who suddenly finds food and walks back to the anthill. The other ants follow the path immediately in order to benefit from the finding and continue to do so as long as the supply is rich. Then they switch to another source opened by another discovery.\n\n“If we could understand the language of the ant we would probably hear the same excitement and exhilarating joy that one can hear in the laboratories when new knowledge is suddenly uncovered.”\n\nThe son of a merchant, Bengt Ingemar Samuelsson was born in Halmstad, south-west Sweden, on May 21 1934, and studied medicine at Lund University, where Bergström stimulated his interest in prostaglandins. He went on to do biochemical research at the Karolinska Institute, near Stockholm, while continuing with his medical training, taking a PhD in 1960 and qualifying in medicine in 1961.\n\nAfter a year as a research fellow at Harvard, Samuelsson returned to the Karolinska Institute, where he became a full professor and eventually dean of the medical faculty, succeeding Bergström. He served as president of the institute from 1983 to 1995. From 1993 to 2005 he was chairman of the Nobel Foundation.\n\nWhen the 1982 Nobel Prize was announced he and his fellow recipients were attending a celebration of Harvard Medical School’s 200th anniversary. Reflecting on the widening interest in prostaglandin research, Samuelsson observed that in 1966, when he and Bergström organised a scientific conference on the subject, some 60 scientists attended. In May 1982, a similar conference attracted 1,500 participants.\n\nIn 1958 Samuelsson married Karin Bergstein, who survives him with a son and daughter. Another daughter predeceased him.\n\nBengt Samuelsson, born May 21 1934, died July 7 2024"
