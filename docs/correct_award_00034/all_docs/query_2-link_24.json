        "text": "Solution\n\nVerified by Toppr\n\nKarl von Frisch of Germany was awarded Nobel prize in 1973 for his discovery in the field of organisation and elicitation of individual and social behaviour pattern in bees. He showed that honey bees use a dance language to communicate food locations to other bees. He found two types of dance - round and waggle dance. Hence, option A is correct."
