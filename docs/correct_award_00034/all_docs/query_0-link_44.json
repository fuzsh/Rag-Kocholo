        "text": "Lorenz, Konrad\n\nStart date: 1954-08-05\n\nCommentary\n\nAustrian zoologist, founder of modern ethology, the study of animal behaviour by means of comparative zoological methods. Lorenz's ideas contributed to an understanding of how behavioral patterns may be traced to an evolutionary past, and he was also known for his work on the roots of aggression. He shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1973 with the animal behaviourists Karl von Frisch and Nikolaas Tinbergen.\n\nLorenz was the son of an orthopedic surgeon. He showed an interest in animals at an early age, and he kept animals of various species – fish, birds, monkeys, dogs, cats, and rabbits – many of which he brought home from his boyhood excursions. While still young, he provided nursing care for sick animals from the nearby Schönbrunner Zoo. He also kept detailed records of bird behaviour in the form of diaries.\n\nIn 1922, after graduating from secondary school, he followed his father's wishes that he study medicine and spent two semesters at Columbia University, New York City. He then returned to Vienna to study.\n\nDuring his medical studies Lorenz continued to make detailed observations of animal behaviour; a diary about a jackdaw that he kept was published in 1927 in the prestigious Journal für Ornithologie. He received the MD degree at the University of Vienna in 1928 and was awarded his PhD degree in zoology in 1933. Encouraged by the positive response to his scientific work, Lorenz established colonies of birds, such as jackdaws and greylag geese, published a series of research papers on his observations of them, and soon gained an international reputation.\n\nIn 1935 Lorenz described learning behaviour in young ducklings and goslings. He observed that at a certain critical stage soon after hatching, they learn to follow real or foster parents. The process, which is called 'imprinting', involves visual and auditory stimuli from the parent object; these elicit a following response in the young that affects their subsequent adult behaviour. Lorenz demonstrated the phenomenon by appearing before newly hatched mallard ducklings and imitating a mother duck's quacking sounds, upon which the young birds regarded him as their mother and followed him accordingly.\n\nIn 1936 the German Society for Animal Psychology was founded. The following year Lorenz became coeditor in chief of the new Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie, which became a leading journal for ethology. Also in 1937, he was appointed lecturer in comparative anatomy and animal psychology at the University of Vienna. From 1940 to 1942 he was professor and head of the department of general psychology at the Albertus University at Königsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia).\n\nFrom 1942 to 1944 he served as a physician in the German army and was captured as a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union. He was returned to Austria in 1948 and headed the Institute of Comparative Ethology at Altenberg from 1949 to 1951. In 1950 he established a comparative ethology department in the Max Planck Institute of Buldern, Westphalia, becoming Codirector of the Institute in 1954. From 1961 to 1973 he served as director of the Max Planck Institute for Behaviour Physiology, in Seewiesen. In 1973 Lorenz, together with Frisch and Tinbergen, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning animal behavioral patterns. In the same year, Lorenz became director of the Department of Animal Sociology at the Institute for Comparative Ethology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Altenberg.\n\nLorenz's early scientific contributions dealt with the nature of instinctive behavioral acts, particularly how such acts come about and the source of 'nervous energy' for their performance. He also investigated how behaviour may result from two or more basic drives that are activated simultaneously in an animal. Working with Tinbergen of The Netherlands, Lorenz showed that different forms of behaviour are harmonized in a single action sequence.\n\nLorenz's concepts advanced the modern scientific understanding of how behavioral patterns evolve in a species, particularly with respect to the role played by ecological factors and the adaptive value of behaviour for species survival. He proposed that animal species are genetically constructed so as to learn specific kinds of information that are important for the survival of the species. His ideas have also cast light on how behavioral patterns develop and mature during the life of an individual organism.\n\nIn the latter part of his career, Lorenz applied his ideas to the behaviour of humans as members of a social species, an application with controversial philosophical and sociological implications. In a popular book, Das sogenannte Böse (1963; published in English as On Aggression), he argued that fighting and warlike behaviour in man have an inborn basis but can be environmentally modified by the proper understanding and provision for the basic instinctual needs of human beings. Fighting in lower animals has a positive survival function, he observed, such as the dispersion of competitors and the maintenance of territory. Warlike tendencies in humans may likewise be ritualized into socially useful behaviour patterns. In another work, Die Rückseite des Spiegels: Versuch einer Naturgeschichte menschlichen Erkennens (1973; Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge), Lorenz examined the nature of human thought and intelligence and attributed the problems of modern civilization largely to the limitations his study revealed.\n\nWritten by: Eckhard H.
