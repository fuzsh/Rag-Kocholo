        "text": "In 1973 the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded to three pioneer practioners of a new science, ethology—the study of animal behaviour. They were two Austrians, Karl von Frisch and Konrad Lorenz, and Dutch-born British researcher Nikolaas (Niko) Tinbergen. All three were acute observers who, through extensive field experience, sought to determine patterns and motivations in the behaviour of animals.\n\nThe press release from the Karolinska Institutet announcing the awarding of the prizes stated that “During the first decades of this century research concerning animal behaviour was on its way to be stuck in a blind alley. The vitalists believed in the instincts as mystical, wise and inexplicable forces inherent in the organism, governing the behaviour of the individual. On the other hand reflexologists interpreted behaviour in an one-side mechanical way, and behaviourists were preoccupied with learning as an explanation of all behavioural variations. The way out of this dilemma was indicated by investigators who focused on the survival value of various behaviour patterns in their studies of species differences. Behaviour patterns become explicable when interpreted as the result of natural selection, analogous with anatomical and physiological characteristics. This year’s prize winners hold a unique position in this field. They are the most eminent founders of a new science, called “the comparative study of behaviour” or “ethology” (from ethos = habit, manner). Their first discoveries were made on insects, fishes and birds, but the basal principles have proved to be applicable also on mammals, including man.”\n\nThe presentation speech concluded, “According to an old fable, cited by one of you, king Solomon is said to have been the owner of a ring that had the mystical power to give him the gift of understanding the language of animals. You have been the successors of king Solomon in the respect that you have been able to decode the information that animals pass to each other, and also to elucidate the meaning of their behaviour to us. Your ability to find general rules underlying the confusing manifold of animal behaviour makes us sometimes believe that king Solomon’s ring has in fact been available also to you. But we know that you have been working in an empirical way, collecting data and interpreting it according to hard and fast scientific rules.\n\nAside from their value in themselves, your discoveries have had a far-reaching influence on such medical disciplines as social medicine, psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine. For that reason it was very much in agreement with the spirit of Alfred Nobel’s will when the medical faculty of the Karolinska Institute awarded you this year’s Nobel Prize.”\n\nBritannica‘s brief biographies of the three Nobelists follow, along with a short list of works by the three men. These books, rich with anecdote and observation, are recommended for all readers who wish to explore the endlessly fascinating field of animal behaviour.\n\nKarl von Frisch\n\n(b. Nov. 20, 1886, Vienna, Austriaâ€”d. June 12, 1982, Munich, W.Ger.), zoologist whose studies of communication among bees added significantly to the knowledge of the chemical and visual sensors of insects. He shared the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with animal behaviourists Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen.\n\nFrisch received a Ph.D. from the University of Munich in 1910. He was appointed director of the Zoological Institution of the University of Rostock in 1921, and in 1923 he accepted a similar position at the University of Breslau. In 1925 Frisch returned to the University of Munich, where he established the Zoological Institution. When this institution was destroyed during World War II, he joined the staff of the University of Graz in Austria, but he returned to Munich in 1950, remaining there until his retirement in 1958.\n\nAbout 1910 Frisch initiated a study that proved fishes could distinguish colour and brightness differences. He also later proved that auditory acuity and sound-distinguishing ability in fishes is superior to that in humans.\n\nFrisch is best known for his studies of bees, however. In 1919 he demonstrated that they can be trained to distinguish between various tastes and odours. He found that while their sense of smell is similar to that of humans, their sense of taste is not as highly developed. He also observed that it is not limited to the quality of sweetness. He found that bees communicate the distance and direction of a food supply to other members of the colony by two types of rhythmic movements or dances: circling and wagging. The circling dance indicates that food is within 75 m (about 250 feet) of the hive, while the wagging dance indicates a greater distance.\n\nIn 1949 Frisch established that bees, through their perception of polarized light, use the Sun as a compass. He also found that they are capable of using this method of orientation when the Sun is not visible, apparently remembering patterns of polarization presented by the sky at different times of the day and the location of previously encountered landmarks.\n\nKonrad Lorenz\n\n(b. Nov. 7, 1903, Vienna, Austriaâ€”d. Feb. 27, 1989, Altenburg), Austrian zoologist, founder of modern ethology, the study of animal behaviour by means of comparative zoological methods. His ideas contributed to an understanding of how behavioral patterns may be traced to an evolutionary past, and he was also known for his work on the roots of aggression. He shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1973 with the animal behaviourists Karl von Frisch and Nikolaas Tinbergen.\n\nLorenz was the son of an orthopedic surgeon. He showed an interest in animals at an early age, and he kept animals of various speciesâ€”fish, birds, monkeys, dogs, cats, and rabbitsâ€”many of which he brought home from his boyhood excursions. While still young, he provided nursing care for sick animals from the nearby SchÃ¶nbrunner Zoo. He also kept detailed records of bird behaviour in the form of diaries.\n\nIn 1922, after graduating from secondary school, he followed his father’s wishes that he study medicine and spent two semesters at Columbia University, in New York City. He then returned to Vienna to study.\n\nDuring his medical studies Lorenz continued to make detailed observations of animal behaviour; a diary about a jackdaw that he kept was published in 1927 in the prestigious Journal fÃ¼r Ornithologie. He received the M.D. degree at the University of Vienna in 1928 and was awarded the Ph.D. degree in zoology in 1933. Encouraged by the positive response to his scientific work, Lorenz established colonies of birds, such as the jackdaw and greylag goose, published a series of research papers on his observations of them, and soon gained an international reputation.\n\nIn 1935 Lorenz described learning behaviour in young ducklings and goslings. He observed that at a certain critical stage soon after hatching, they learn to follow real or foster parents. The process, which is called imprinting, involves visual and auditory stimuli from the parent object; these elicit a following response in the young that affects their subsequent adult behaviour. Lorenz demonstrated the phenomenon by appearing before newly hatched mallard ducklings and imitating a mother duck’s quacking sounds, upon which the young birds regarded him as their mother and followed him accordingly.\n\nIn 1936 the German Society for Animal Psychology was founded. The following year Lorenz became coeditor in chief of the new Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Tierpsychologie, which became a leading journal for ethology. Also in 1937, he was appointed lecturer in comparative anatomy and animal psychology at the University of Vienna. From 1940 to 1942 he was professor and head of the department of general psychology at the Albertus University at KÃ¶nigsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia).\n\nFrom 1942 to 1944 he served as a physician in the German army and was captured as a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union. He was returned to Austria in 1948 and headed the Institute of Comparative Ethology at Altenberg from 1949 to 1951. In 1950 he established a comparative ethology department in the Max Planck Institute of Buldern, Westphalia, becoming codirector of the Institute in 1954. From 1961 to 1973 he served as director of the Max Planck Institute for Behaviour Physiology, in Seewiesen. In 1973 Lorenz, together with Frisch and Tinbergen, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning animal behavioral patterns. In the same year, Lorenz became director of the department of animal sociology at the Institute for Comparative Ethology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Altenberg.\n\nLorenz’s early scientific contributions dealt with the nature of instinctive behavioral acts, particularly how such acts come about and the source of nervous energy for their performance. He also investigated how behaviour may result from two or more basic drives that are activated simultaneously in an animal. Working with Tinbergen of The Netherlands, Lorenz showed that different forms of behaviour are harmonized in a single action sequence.\n\nLorenz’s concepts advanced the modern scientific understanding of how behavioral patterns evolve in a species, particularly with respect to the role played by ecological factors and the adaptive value of behaviour for species survival. He proposed that animal species are genetically constructed so as to learn specific kinds of information that are important for the survival of the species. His ideas have also cast light on how behavioral patterns develop and mature during the life of an individual organism.\n\nIn the latter part of his career, Lorenz applied his ideas to the behaviour of humans as members of a social species, an application with controversial philosophical and sociological implications. In a popular book, Das sogenannte BÃ¶se (1963; On Aggression), he argued that fighting and warlike behaviour in man have an inborn basis but can be environmentally modified by the proper understanding and provision for the basic instinctual needs of human beings. Fighting in lower animals has a positive survival function, he observed, such as the dispersion of competitors and the maintenance of territory. Warlike tendencies in humans may likewise be ritualized into socially useful behaviour patterns. In another work, Die RÃ¼ckseite des Spiegels: Versuch einer Naturgeschichte menschlichen Erkennens (1973; Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge), Lorenz examined the nature of human thought and intelligence and attributed the problems of modern civilization largely to the limitations his study revealed.\n\n—Eckhard H. Hess\n\nNikolaas Tinbergen\n\n(b. April 15, 1907, The Hague, Neth.â€”d. Dec. 21, 1988, Oxford, Eng.), Dutch-born British zoologist and ethologist (specialist in animal behaviour) who, with Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch, received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1973.\n\nTinbergen was the brother of the economist Jan Tinbergen. After receiving a Ph.D. degree (1932) from the University of Leiden, he taught there until 1949. He then served on the faculty of the University of Oxford (1949â€“74), where he organized a research department of animal behaviour. He became a British citizen in 1955.\n\nWith Lorenz and Frisch, Tinbergen is credited with revitalizing the science of ethology. Their emphasis was on field observations of animals under natural conditions. Tinbergen emphasized the importance of both instinctive and learned behaviour to survival and used animal behaviour as a basis for speculations about the nature of human violence and aggression. He is especially well known for his long-term observations of sea gulls, which led to important generalizations on courtship and mating behaviour.\n\nAmong his more important writings are The Herring Gullâ€™s World (1953; rev. ed. 1961), Social Behavior in Animals (1953), and Animal Behavior (1965). Perhaps his most influential work is The Study of Instinct (1951), which explores the work of the European ethological school up to that time and attempts a synthesis with American ethology. In the 1970s Tinbergen devoted his time to the study of autism in children.\n\nBooks We Like"
