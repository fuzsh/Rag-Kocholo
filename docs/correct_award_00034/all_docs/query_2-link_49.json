        "text": "About the Book\n\nNow back in print after more than two decades, this classic and still-accurate account of the behavior patterns and sensory capacities of the honeybee remains a book \"written with a simplicity, directness, and charm....\"--Yale Review\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nOver half a century of brilliant scientific detective work, the Nobel Prize-winning biologist Karl von Frisch learned how the world, looks, smells, and tastes to a bee. More significantly, he discovered their dance language and their ability to use the sun as a compass. Intended to serve as an accessible introduction to one of the most fascinating areas of biology, Bees (first published in 1950 and revised in 1971), reported the startling results of his ingenious and revolutionary experiments with honeybees.In his revisions, von Frisch updated his discussion about the phylogenetic origin of the language of bees and also demonstrated that their color sense is greater than had been thought previously. He also took into consideration the electrophysiological experiments and electromicroscopic observations that have supplied more information on how the bee analyzes polarized light to orient itself and how the olfactory organs on the bee's antennae function.Now back in print after more than two decades, this classic and still-accurate account of the behavior patterns and sensory capacities of the honeybee remains a book \"written with a simplicity, directness, and charm which all who know him will recognize as characteristic of its author. Any intelligent reader, without scientific training, can enjoy it.\"--Yale Review\n\nAbout the Author\n\nKarl von Frisch (1886-1982) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973. Born in Austria, he was director of the Zoological Institute at the University of Munich from 1925 to 1946 and again from 1950 until 1958, when he became emeritus professor, continuing his research there into the 1970s."
