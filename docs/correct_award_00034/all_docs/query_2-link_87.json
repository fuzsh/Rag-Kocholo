        "text": "Only once have entomologists ever been awarded a Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1973 was awarded jointly to Karl von Frisch, Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen “for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns”. Niko Tinbergen studied orientation behaviors in sand wasps; von Frisch studied communication and orientation in honey bees.\n\nThe Noble Prize is regarded as the Pinnacle of achievement in science. The Ig Nobel Prize rewards parody and unusual “Research that makes people LAUGH and then THINK”. Among the 2011 winners are 2 entomologists, The 2011 Ig Nobel BIOLOGY PRIZE was awarded to Darryl Gwynne and David Rentz for discovering that “a certain kind of beetle mates with a certain kind of Australian beer bottle”. Their observations were published in the Australian Entomological Society and Royal Entomological Society.\n\nREFERENCE: “Beetles on the Bottle: Male Buprestids Mistake Stubbies for Females (Coleoptera),” D.T. Gwynne, and D.C.F. Rentz, Journal of the Australian Entomological Society, vol. 22, , no. 1, 1983, pp. 79-80\n\nREFERENCE: “Beetles on the Bottle,” D.T. Gwynne and D.C.F. Rentz, Antenna: Proceedings (A) of the Royal Entomological Society London, vol. 8, no. 3, 1984, pp. 116-7.\n\nThe scientific description is “Male Julodimorpha bakewelli were observed attempting to copulate with beer bottles. Colour and reflection of tubercles on the bottle glass are suggested as causes for attraction and release of sexual behaviour.”\n\nAs Darryl Gwynne related in an interview,\n\nIt was just co-incidental that my area of research was Darwinian sexual selection and how sex differences evolve, and here was a classic example taking place in front of my eyes where males were making mating errors.\n\nIt was very obvious the beetles were trying to mate. These beetles have enormous genitalia, and they’re large to start with – over two inches long. The sad thing was that these beetles were dying; they wouldn’t leave the bottles alone. They’d fall off them exhausted.\n\nIt was almost certainly the visual colour – the bottle looked like a giant female. And also in the reflectance patterns – there were stipples on the bottles that resembled marks on the females’ wing covers."
