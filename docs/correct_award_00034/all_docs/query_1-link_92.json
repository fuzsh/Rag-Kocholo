Shockley and Walter H. Brattain (Physics Ph.D. ’29) for their invention of the transistor. Together with Leon N. Cooper and John R. Schrieffer, he won the 1972 prize for developing the theory of superconductivity.\n\nArthur H. Compton\n\nFaculty member 1916-17\n\nNobel Prize in Physics, 1927\n\nCompton was honored (along with C.T.R. Wilson of England) for his discovery and explanation of the “Compton effect,” the change in X-ray wavelength when they collide with electrons in metals.\n\nWilliam N. Lipscomb\n\nFaculty member 1946-59\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry, 1976\n\nLipscomb was honored for his research on the structure and bonding of boron compounds and the general nature of chemical bonding.\n\nJohn H. Van Vleck\n\nFaculty member 1924-28\n\nNobel Prize in Physics, 1977\n\nVan Vleck was honored (with Philip W. Anderson and Sir Nevill F. Mott) for his contributions to the understanding of the behavior of electrons in magnetic, noncrystalline solid materials.\n\nAlumni"
