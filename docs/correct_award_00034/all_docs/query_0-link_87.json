        "text": "Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Prize in physics, chemistry, literature, and medicine or physiology and the peace prize. But none in Psychology or Mathematics. Economics was added in the list of categories in 1969.\n\nHowever, despite of this, several psychologists have received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, economics, and even in literature. Psychology has been awarded the distinction of a Nobel Prize only when it has served a role in explicating human behavior in relation to economics. Oddly, no psychologist has received the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nWilhelm Wundt (father of experimental psychology) was nominated three times for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n\nAlso, Sigmund Freud (father of psychoanalysis) was nominated twelve times for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and once for Literature.\n\n-Following are the prominent contributors in psychology/psychiatry/neuroscience and that have received the Nobel Prize-\n\n1904. Ivan P. Pavlov (Physiology or Medicine)\n\n1906. Santiago Ramón y Cajal (Physiology or Medicine, with Camillo Golgi)\n\n1949. Edgar Moniz (Physiology or Medicine, with Walter Rudolf Hess)\n\n1973. Konrad Lorenz (Physiology or Medicine, with Karl von Frisch and Nikolaas Tinbergen)\n\n1978. Herbert Simon (Economics)\n\n1981. Roger W. Sperry (PhM, with David H. Hubel and Torsten N. Wiesel)\n\n2002. Daniel Kahneman (Economics, with Vernon Smith)\n\n2011. Tomas Tranströmer (Literature)\n\n2014. John O´Keefe (Physiology or Medicine)\n\n2014. May-Britt Moser & Edvard Ingjald Moser (Physiology or Medicine)\n\n2017. Richard Thaler (Economics)\n\nAmos Nathan Tversky, a mathematical psychologist, was a collaborator of Daniel Kahneman. Six years after Tversky's death, Kahneman received his Nobel Memorial Prize for the work he did in collaboration with Amos Tversky. The prize is not awarded posthumously.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre, awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature, declined the prize because he had consistently declined all official honors stating, \"A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.\"\n\nThe most like the Nobel Prize Award is the Grawemeyer Prize that was created in 1985 and has been granted in psychology since the year 2000.\n\nTwo psychologists that have received both awards, the Grawemeyer Prize and the Nobel Prize, are John O´Keefe and Daniel Kahneman.\n\nOther important prizes for psychologists are awarded by the APA (The American Psychological Association) and the IUPsyS (The International Union of Psychological Science).\n\nThe Kluge Prize, a $1 million prize given by the John W. Kluge Center, is awarded for lifetime achievement in the fields of humanistic and social science studies that are not included in the Nobel Prizes, most notably history, philosophy, politics, psychology, anthropology, sociology, religious studies, linguistics, and criticism in the arts and humanities.\n\nRead more here: http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1657-92672016000400017#:~:text=Two%20psychologists%20that%20have%20received,%C2%B4Keefe%20and%20Daniel%20Kahneman.&text=In%20spite%20of%20not%20having,Economics%2C%20and%20even%20in%20Literature"
