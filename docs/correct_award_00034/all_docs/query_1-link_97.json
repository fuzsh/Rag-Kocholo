        "text": "Damon Runyon is delighted to announce that the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded jointly to David Julius, PhD, and Ardem Patapoutian, PhD, \"for their discoveries of receptors for temperature and touch.\" With their findings, the two scientists have solved the mystery of how our bodies perceive heat, cold, pressure, and other stimuli. These discoveries pave the way for the development of treatments \"for a wide range of disease conditions,\" including cancer.\n\nDr. Patapoutian is a former Damon Runyon Fellow (1996-99) and Scholar (2002-05), making him the 13th Damon Runyon alumnus to receive the Nobel Prize. He is also mentor to a current Damon Runyon Fellow. Ardem is Professor in the Department of Neuroscience at Scripps Research and Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Dr. Julius is a former member of the Fellowship Award Committee and has mentored four Damon Runyon Fellows. David is Professor and Chair of the Department of Physiology at UC San Francisco and holds the Morris Herzstein Chair in Molecular Biology and Medicine.\n\nEvery breakthrough in cancer research is a culmination of all the discoveries that came before it. Scientists like Ardem and David lay the foundation for future advancement, not only through their Nobel-winning work but also through their mentorship of the next generation of leaders in cancer research. We are truly honored to support them."
