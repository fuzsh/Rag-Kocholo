        "text": "Topline\n\nKatalin Karikó won this year’s Nobel Prize in Medicine alongside Drew Weissman for their research that led to the development of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, but a post from the University of Pennsylvania—where Karikó was demoted from tenure track in 1995—claiming her as a Penn researcher angered the medical community.\n\nKey Facts\n\nChief Critics\n\nMembers of the medical and academic communities criticized Penn in response to the university’s post. Eric Feigl-Ding, chief of Covid Task Force at the New England Complex Systems Institute and former Harvard Medical School researcher, urged Penn to apologize to Karikó but praised her for persisting in her research despite being demoted. Nicole Paulk, founder of Siren Biotechnology, criticized Penn Medicine for its post congratulating Karikó, stating: “You shunned her and put roadblocks in the way of her and her research when she was at Penn. You should feel immense shame, not pride, today. You played no role in this.” Some critics suggested Karikó’s experience is an example of the struggles women in academia face. “A woman winning the Nobel prize for the same work Penn called ‘not faculty quality’ & Penn CLAIMING CREDIT is exactly how misogyny in academia works,” Stevenson University assistant professor Kerry Pray posted. Other critics accused Penn and other research institutions of valuing profit over quality research. Martin Bauer, associate professor of physics at Durham University, criticized Penn for its “self-adulation over a Nobel prize but no recognition of the way they treated the ‘historic research team’ when it didn’t seem profitable enough.”\n\nKey Background\n\nKarikó and Weissman reportedly met in 1997 because they kept “fighting over a photocopy machine,” prompting them to talk and compare what they were working on. Weissman reportedly had the funding to finance their mRNA experiments, which Karikó said kept her going. Karikó, who long struggled to secure grant funding, reportedly never earned more than $60,000 a year while at Penn. After nearly a decade of partnership, Karikó and Weissman published findings in 2005 that showed how a modified version of mRNA could be administered without triggering an aggressive immune response, leading them to realize mRNA could potentially be used in vaccines. Their research initially attracted little interest, and they founded a startup but struggled to find investors. They eventually licensed their technology to BioNTech, then a little-known company, where Karikó moved in 2013 after realizing she would not make progress with mRNA research while still at Penn. Their findings became the foundation for both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines. Karikó and Weissman have won numerous other accolades for their mRNA research, like the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research and the Lasker Award.\n\nTangent\n\nKarikó has spoken in numerous interviews about her difficult experience at Penn, stating in 2020 her demotion made her feel that she was “not good enough, not smart enough.” After being demoted, researchers usually “just say goodbye and leave because it’s so horrible,” Karikó told STAT News in 2020. When Penn refused to reinstate her to a tenure track position in 2013 and she left for BioNTech, Karikó said, “They laughed at me and said, ‘BioNTech doesn’t even have a website.’” In an interview with the Nobel Prize soon after winning, Karikó said she was “kicked out and forced to retire” in 2013 when Penn refused to reinstate her former position. Her colleagues have also recognized the difficulties she faced: Cardiologist Elliott Barnathan said Karikó was treated as a “second-class citizen” at Penn.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n“In the future, this lab will be a museum. Don’t touch it,” Karikó reportedly told her former boss at Penn when leaving her lab at the university for the final time in 2013.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nWhile a researcher at Temple University in the late 1980s, Karikó—a native of Hungary—reportedly argued with her boss, who then attempted to have her deported. Karikó had immigrated to the United States in 1985 with little money—she smuggled £900 (the equivalent of $1,087 today), which she earned by selling her car on the black market, into the country by sewing it into her daughter’s teddy bear.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nHow mRNA went from a scientific backwater to a pandemic crusher (Wired)\n\nShe was demoted, doubted and rejected.
