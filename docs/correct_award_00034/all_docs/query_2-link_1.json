        "text": "Karl von Frisch (born Nov. 20, 1886, Vienna, Austriaâ€”died June 12, 1982, Munich, W.Ger.) was a zoologist whose studies of communication among bees added significantly to the knowledge of the chemical and visual sensors of insects. He shared the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with animal behaviourists Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen.\n\nFrisch received a Ph.D. from the University of Munich in 1910. He was appointed director of the Zoological Institution of the University of Rostock in 1921, and in 1923 he accepted a similar position at the University of Breslau. In 1925 Frisch returned to the University of Munich, where he established the Zoological Institution. When this institution was destroyed during World War II, he joined the staff of the University of Graz in Austria, but he returned to Munich in 1950, remaining there until his retirement in 1958.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFaces of Science\n\nAbout 1910 Frisch initiated a study that proved fishes could distinguish colour and brightness differences. He also later proved that auditory acuity and sound-distinguishing ability in fishes is superior to that in humans.\n\nFrisch is best known for his studies of bees, however. In 1919 he demonstrated that they can be trained to distinguish between various tastes and odours. He found that while their sense of smell is similar to that of humans, their sense of taste is not as highly developed. He also observed that it is not limited to the quality of sweetness. He found that bees communicate the distance and direction of a food supply to other members of the colony by two types of rhythmic movements or dances: circling and wagging. The circling dance indicates that food is within 75 m (about 250 feet) of the hive, while the wagging dance indicates a greater distance.\n\nIn 1949 Frisch established that bees, through their perception of polarized light, use the Sun as a compass. He also found that they are capable of using this method of orientation when the Sun is not visible, apparently remembering patterns of polarization presented by the sky at different times of the day and the location of previously encountered landmarks."
