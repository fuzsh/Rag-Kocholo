        "text": "The ninth film in the Godzilla series sees an array of monsters rampage at the foot of Mount Fuji.\n\nIt’s the year 1999; humans have achieved world peace and have confined all of the world’s kaiju on an island dubbed ‘Kaiju Land’. However, someone has attacked the control centre, and suddenly the kaiju are free to once again destroy different parts of the world – which they do – from London to New York, Beijing to Moscow. In time, it’s revealed that this is a sinister plot by the Kiraaku aliens as part of a bid for world domination.\n\nFeaturing a record number of 11 monsters – including Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, Minilla and King Ghidorah (on the aliens’ side) – and a stoic Captain Yamabe (Akira Kubo), who sabotages the alien outpost, the seventh of eight films made by Ishirō Honda for the series is a noteworthy entry in the Godzilla franchise.\n\n“A significant cultural marker created during a period of creativity in which the world’s uncertainties were expressed through the movies. It’s a masterpiece.” – RogerEbert.com"
