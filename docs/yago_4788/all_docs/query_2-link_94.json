Special effects directed by Sadamasa Arikawa (aka Teisho Arikawa), with Eiji Tsuburaya in a supervisory role.\n\nAh, the wonderful world of Toho’s Shōwa-era Kaiju flicks… set in that stupendous universe where monsters are an everyday occurrence, the suits worn by astronauts are bright, primary colours (bright yellow in the case of this film), cities are regularly wiped-out (but always reconstitute themselves for the next movie) and the armed forces are always on standby with their numerous rocket launchers, jets and tanks (which pretty much never have the proper firepower to really hurt the monsters!)\n\nIn DESTROY ALL MONSTERS Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra (larval stage), Anguirus, Gorosaurus, Manda and other denizens of Monsterland (aka Monster Island) become the pawns of an alien race, called the Kilaaks, who use mind-control devices to turn the (now quite benign creatures) into aggressive, city-wrecking weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWith not as much man-in-monster-suit action as you’d think, DESTROY ALL MONSTERS is still a staggeringly fun production, with cell-animated laser effects, some sweet model work, a satisfyingly large quota of monsters, and a knockabout final fight near Mount Fuji, where the re-grouped Earth super-critters kick and bite Ghidorah the three-headed space dragon until he’s trashed!\n\nBy far the best two portions of the film are the opening scenes, where we get a tour of Monsterland that shows us all the great beasties chilling out on their island home, and, of course, the aforementioned no holds barred multi-monster battle sequence at the end.\n\nStonkingly amazing stuff!\n\nHere are a whole bunch of posters and other artworks that help to glorify the awesomeness that is DESTROY ALL MONSTERS…\n\nHere’s a behind the scenes shot of the filmmakers working on a scene with Manda…\n\nLet’s end this post with a chance to see Ghidorah getting stomped…"
