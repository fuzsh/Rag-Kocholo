        "text": "Director: Ishiro Honda\n\nStarring: Akira Kubo, Jun Tazaki, Yukiko Kobayashi\n\nRelease Date: 1st August 1968 (Japan)\n\nIf life can be viewed through a lens, many lenses can take in a whole people. This is part of what makes long-running franchises so interesting, be they the Godzilla series of Japan, the ‘Carry On’ films of Great Britain, or the endless Wong Fei-hung movies of Hong Kong. No matter how silly or fantastic the material, one can usually see a little of the social fabric peeping through; doubtless some enterprising student is already penning a thesis on the American economy of the early twenty-first century as seen through the Fast and Furious films. However, as any photographer will tell you, the more lenses you attach to a camera, the more difficult it is to maintain balance, to keep the original focus of the shot. Time waits for on-one, man or monster, and the present is a much a picture of the past as it is of today.\n\nBy 1968, the Japanese giant monster movie genre (or kaiju eiga) was fourteen years old, and its greatest star, Godzilla, had appeared in seven films. Since 1962’s King Kong vs Godzilla, Toho Studios had released movies starring the ‘King of the Monsters’ almost annually, incorporating other monsters from the Toho range, such as Mothra and Rodan. Aliens were thrown into the mix as from Monster Zero (1965) and a space monster too, Godzilla’s great nemesis, Ghidorah, a three-headed dragon-like beast. All this extraterrestrial color was a far cry from the original Godzilla (1954), a movie with a soul blackened from Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and defeat at the hands of America only nine years prior. The further Toho Studios took their monsters into space, the further down went the series’ credibility – but was there ever an alternative? You can’t keep remaking the original, no matter how great its success.\n\nPeople change; their films change; no-one can live under a cloud forever, not even a mushroom cloud. The bomb sites of London gave way to Carnaby Street, and Japan too began to let in light and color, manifesting in terms of monster movies, in Godzilla vs The Smog Monster (1971) and Godzilla vs Gigan (1972), with greater emphasis on youth culture and contemporary issues. For the time being, Toho faced a problem: how to keep its most famous film series profitable, while keeping costs down to ensure profitability, not to mention who to aim the series at: the more discerning adults, or the children, who were pleased enough with monsters and action.\n\nPerhaps this conflict gave rise to differing opinions on the genesis of the eighth Godzilla film, Destroy All Monsters; some suggest Toho intended the film as a celebration of its twentieth monster picture; others believe Toho wanted to end the series, with one last blow-out featuring as many of its giant monsters as possible (and re-using those pricey monster costumes from earlier films). Either way, Destroy All Monsters was set up as the monster film to end all monster films – and while not fulfilling its apocalyptic title, it’s a robust (if ultimately silly) experience all the same.\n\nAs for being a sign of the times, it’s intriguing to note DAM is the only one of the original showa run of Godzilla films set in the future, 1999 to be exact. We are informed of this date by the narrator of the Americanized version of DAM, Peter Fernandez, the voice of Speed Racer and whose firm vocal stylings also graced the dubbed versions of Godzilla vs The Sea Monster (1966) and Son of Godzilla (1967). There are no specially-filmed inserts for the English language DAM, but although the film looks identical, the narration and dubbing ensure what Western audiences heard was much different from DAM‘s original home audience. What effect this has on the film’s message – if it had one – is impossible to say.\n\nOur narrator informs us the United Nations Scientific Community has established daily rocket shots to the Moon, where a scientific base is in operation. The model effects, handled by Toho guru Eiji Tsuburaya, are as good as ever, presenting objects more convincing in themselves than modern CGI, though the ‘Moonlight SY-3 rocket’ we see launching gives a worrying wobble as it heads for the skies. Then it’s into the credits, and a score from another member of the original 1954 crew, composer Akira Ifukube, whose enjoyable title track for DAM is both pompous and perky all at once.\n\nNext, we hear of the underwater base at Ogasawara Island (a catch-all term here for the Bonin Islands, around 650 miles south of Tokyo). “New kinds of fish are being bred here,” we’re told, an unappealing and slightly unethical concept thankfully breezed over in favor of DAM‘s most noteworthy addition to the kaiju eiga – Monster Island. Scientists, when not breeding (with?) fish, also study the Earth’s monsters, now assembled on one island out of harm’s way. Aside from Godzilla, who has bagged himself a nice cave with a view, we see: Rodan (sometimes referred to as ‘Radon’), the giant pteranodon, who has a clifftop residence from where he can glide through the air; Anguirus, making his first appearance since Godzilla Raids Again (1955); Mothra, seen here in her larvae stage; and Gorosaurus, a rather goofy looking dinosaur of indiscernible talent, who appears to have survived the cretaceous extinction event out of sheer luck.\n\nFollowing the various monsters through the fifty-odd years of kaigu eiga is a taxing pastime, with monsters’ costumes changing more than their names. Godzilla and Rodan are consistent enough, but Mothra, after her titular debut film in 1964, in which she spreads her wings in all her colorful glory, is more often than not subsequently depicted as an ambulatory grub (presumably for contractual reasons so as not to upstage Godzilla) resembling a segmented andouillette. Anguirus, a quadruped beast, looks like a hedgehog crossed with an iguana and has almost as many names as movies, being also known as Anzilla, Angrous and Angilas.\n\nThese and other creatures are kept on Monster Island by “scientific shields, according to each monster’s instincts and habits.” Rodan is restricted by an invisible wall of magnetic beams, gas keeps Mothra from straying too far, and when Godzilla attempts to stroll out into the sea, he is repulsed by a chemical spray, causing him to throw a tantrum and head back to shore. Considering the monsters are responsible for untold billions of yen of damage, and the deaths of thousands of people, they lead a sweet enough life on Monster Island: “there is food here in abundance, and the monsters are free to eat as much of it as they please.” We see Rodan swoop upon a pod of dolphins and snack upon some unfortunate Flipper as if it were a sardine.\n\nA helicopter lands in the underground base, depositing Dr Otani (Yoshio Tsuchiya) and a young woman, his new assistant Kyoko Yamabe (Yukiko Kobayashi), who will help him study the monsters. Before Kyoko is even given some photocopying to do, or can be coerced into buying cakes for her new colleagues, she takes a long distance call over the videophone. Very long distance – the Moon in fact, where SY-3’s captain Katsuo Yamabe (Akira Kubo, star of funky fungus drama Matango (1963)) checks in on his namesake’s new job (it’s unclear from the dialogue how, or if, the two Yamabes are related). “This call cost a lot of money,” he notes, somewhat killing the romance of the moment, before adding, “hey, I think there are monsters here too.” “Really?” “Well, maybe.” The signal breaks up before the conversation can become any less edifying. “We’ll investigate this right away,” declares Dr Otani.\n\nBefore an error report can be completed and sent to Microsoft, yellow gas seeps under the doors, rendering everyone a sleepyhead. The monsters are also sent to snoozeland by the gas, with Rodan tumbling off his cliff and landing on Anguirus, who has this sort of luck all through his film career.\n\nThe UNSC hold a meeting in Tokyo to discuss the loss of contact with Ogasawara Island. The visiting base chief, Dr Yoshido (Jun Tazaki) is present, as is fellow scientist, the elegantly-dressed Dr Stevenson (Andrew Hughes, a Western actor who made a brief appearance in 1968’s Goke, Bodysnatcher from Hell). Stevenson is dubbed with a doddery aristocratic English voice, and adds a pleasing frisson of novelty to DAM. Using videoscreens, the assembled watch in puzzlement as parts of Monster Island crumble, matching the viewers’ puzzlement as the reason for this commotion isn’t adequately explained in the narrative.\n\nThe news worsens, as Radio Moscow (employing someone speaking English in a very bad Russian accent) reports the arrival of Rodan, who blows apart buildings with sonic waves created by his high speed flying. Radio Paris, sounding high on sheer Frenchness, squeals that Baragon (from Frankenstein Conquers the World, (1964)) is smashing up the Arc de Triomphe, only a goof in the script obscures it’s actually the work of Gorosaurus. Further bulletins confirm “the major cities of the world are being destroyed one by one”: Beijing by Mothra, and London by Manda (also known as Wenda, a kind of sea serpent with stumpy little legs, seen in Ataragon, 1964). Godzilla gets the plum draw of New York, and we see him achieve the American dream of ripping the UN building a new one with his atomic breath.\n\nDr Yoshido holds a bewildering press conference to address these disasters, opening with “I will say the same thing as I did 20 years ago. Remember that typhoon? We must be on our guard!” A journalist asks why Tokyo has escaped attack. “I’d like to know that myself,” replies Yoshido. “Now leave me alone, I’m tired.” I don’t care how respectful ordinary Japanese people are of their social superiors, I can’t imagine Yoshido’s responses playing too well in the home equivalent of the New York Post.\n\nThe crew of the SY-3 are flying their rocketship above the Moon, no mean feat considering the lack of atmosphere to sustain rocket fire. The UFO they spot hovering suspiciously nearby can at least claim some sort of anti-gravity propulsion system, and it outpaces the SY-3 when it investigates. Dr Yoshido commands the crew to stop larking around and return to Earth, via the Ogasawara base. “Watch out for possible trouble,” hints the doctor, who seems to have the wrong end of the stick as regards sending troops on a ‘secret mission.’\n\nDr Yoshido lets the SY-3 in on what’s going on once they’ve landed at the underground base – they are to locate the alien “and find out what it is.” Captain Yamabe and his second-in-command Ogata (Chotaro Togin) soon encounter Dr Otani and Kyoko, who seem indifferent to the emergency: “don’t alarm yourselves. Things will go much more smoothly if you co-operate.” Otani shows the crew footage of Rodan crashing into an aeroplane mid-air: “Rodan is flying,” he helpfully points out.\n\nOtani and Kyoko introduce Yamabe and Ogata to the alien responsible for all this mayhem, the Queen of the Kilaaks (Kyoko Ai), whose people live on a planet between Mars and Jupiter that humanity has somehow overlooked up to 1999. The Kilaak Queen, a demure but stern-looking woman dressed in white and silver, explains the Kilaaks intend to turn Earth into a vast new scientific community, and have placed Godzilla and pals under mind control to expedite matters; if a few humans are stomped underfoot by giant dinosaurs, then that’s the price of progress. Unless the Earth submits to this plan, the monsters will continue their campaign of terror. With the Kilaak Queen invulnerable to attack, Captain Yamabe tries to take Kyoko and Otani back to the SY-3, but a lame fight breaks out with the original base crew, their minds now controlled by the Kilaaks. During the fight we learn, thanks to the base crew’s tight-fitting outfits, that their butts are unaffected by the takeover, but being shot turns their facial expressions into an amusing grimace. Yamabe and Ogata succeed in kidnapping Dr Otani, but Kyoko is left behind.\n\nYamabe and Yoshido take Otani to what looks like a large hotel by the beach, not for a relaxing break, but for interrogation (“Were you brain-WASHED?”). Otani refuses to say where the Kilaak base is located, and no sooner than his hosts’ backs are turned, rudely walks out of the window and falls to his death.\n\nKyoko and some seabase goons intercept Yamabe and Yoshido as they examine the dead doctor. The special beach police arrive and fire upon the intruders (armed police showing up like this is a common feature in Japanese monster movies), enabling our two heroes to escape. One of the goons attempts to remove something from Otani’s head, but flees before he can do so.\n\nLater, surgeons remove a metallic object from behind Otani’s ear and a scientist concludes the object is a mini-transmitter. Yamabe declares “I’ll begin my search for the source of the waves from the sky!” I’m not saying all dialogue needs lifelike authenticity, but dialogue in DAM would benefit from a little self-doubt, or even the sort of mumbling heard in Twilight films, where Robert Pattinson reads his lines with a weariness of a man weighed down by his colossal intellect. Actually, this isn’t a concern for Captain Yamabe, who has a puppy-like enthusiasm for his job, and a mental aptitude to match.\n\nElsewhere, in one of Japan’s mountainous regions, an elderly man (Ikio Sawamura) with an ox (uncredited) collects rocks from a stream and finds a stone which makes a funny noise. What sort of man collects rocks with an ox? Our stone collector takes the object to his friend, a police officer (Yutaka Sada) dubbed with the voice of a yokel farmhand. The officer is “too busy” to help with the mystery stone.The SY-3 zooms high overhead, and the police officer initially mistakes this for Rodan, though he doesn’t seem worried at the possibility. Confirming it’s the SY-3, the stone collector comments “did I tell you my young son is on the Moon?” (Many astronauts come from humble beginnings, but this is stretching it). Laughing, the police officer asks “how is he?” To which the farmer replies, “yurrrrhhhh,” or something similar. This charming slice of cinema verite is interrupted by the arrival of a UNSC party, who have tracked alien waves emitting from the farmer’s pet stone, a dummy stone containing a transmitter scrambling human communications.\n\nA news report tells us such devices were found all over the world: the white cliffs of Dover, England; the roofs of Spanish chapels; encased in Alpine ice; inside a coconut in Guam, no, really. All of these locations are depicted with photographs with huge white arrows pointing out where the device was found. I’m no expert, but I would have looked first at wherever those arrows were pointing, talk about a giveaway.\n\nThe problem remains of the rogue alien-controlled seabase personnel, who have returned to their native countries, iand a bulletin goes out alerting people to look out for Kyoko Yamabe, Michael Dawson, “a British citizen,” and Elmer Hughes, 29. If your name is Michael Dawson or Elmer Hughes, and you’ve been acting strange of late, please turn yourself in to the nearest police station, telling the desk officer that a Godzilla film asked you to give yourself up. Don’t say you were held by the Kilaaks, as the officer may misunderstand, unless he’s “too busy” fending off rock collectors to help.\n\nOne way in which past sci-fi movies underestimated the near future is in the field of personal communications, and a Tokyo train passenger watching this newscast does so on an iPhone-style device the size of a radio set, encased in leatherette plastic. The passenger is so transfixed by the broadcast (or just weighed down by the size of her immobile mobile) she fails to notice Kyoko sitting next to her. Kyoko leaves at the next station, where guards are checking passengers’ ears for alien transmitters, not a job I’d fancy doing at rush hour in a major city.\n\nThe city’s well-used monster defense systems are triggered, with sirens blaring and tannoy announcements instructing people to take shelter, because trouble’s a-comin’. None of this bothers Kyoko who, with a wicked smile, wanders the rapidly emptying streets, as Rodan flies above the city. Model shots are used here, and good as they are (who hasn’t wanted to play around with a monster movie model set?), one can’t help but wonder if stock footage of Tokyo might have worked out cheaper.\n\nSoon, Rodan is joined by Godzilla and Manda for some quality destruction, and there’s a cool shot where the sea-serpent wraps itself around a monorail, crushing it to pieces, while the ‘Big G’ stomps around in the background. The Japanese Self-Defence Force, bless them, try their best, but their tanks, missiles and rooftop batteries all somehow miss the 160 foot tall green dinosaur and his colossal cohorts. The combined firepower makes as big a mess of the city as the monsters; even The Avengers cause less collateral damage than these guys. Here’s tip, fellas: use the defense systems used on Monster Island, you know, those fancy magnetic waves and chemical sprays. Just sayin’.\n\nThe morning after the night before, and Tokyo is nursing a monster hangover, but it’s nothing the big smoke hasn’t seen before. The camera closes in on a sadly untranslated sign, but it probably reads ‘closed for business due to monsters, we re-open in ten minutes.’ At the UNSC, Captain Yamabe tells reporters “the damage is horrible,” but it looks pretty awesome from where I’m sitting. Major Tada (who I like to think pronounces his name ‘ta-DAAAAAAH!’ advises the UNSC the aliens have constructed a base somewhere on the Izu Peninsular, adding the hot springs (for which the area is famous in Japan) are mysteriously drained. The Kilaaks used the monsters’ global rampage as a distraction so they could build their base in peace, which is like me bombing the next town to get the washing-up done without being bothered by unwanted visitors.\n\nBefore Captain Yamabe can declare something earnest about tracking down the cause of the chaos, Kyoko breezes in, wearing a bright red dress, to issue an ultimatum: agree to Kilaak rule, and the monsters will return to Monster Island. “That’s like blackmail!” cries the Captain. “Be quiet, you,” orders Kyoko. Wearing a red dress is one thing, but a woman telling a man to keep their piehole shut? Enough’s enough! In perhaps DAM‘s most shocking scene, Captain Yamane grabs the woman and wrenches out her earrings; Kyoko tries to protect herself, but her hands are covered in DAM‘s only sight of blood. The earrings contained aliens transmitters, and so Kyoko is returned to her normal, obedient, and entirely useless self.\n\nOnce again, the army mobilizes itself for a whooping, but at least they have SY-3 for company. Approaching the site of the suspected alien base incurs the wrath of ‘guard-dog’ Godzilla who stomps on a few tanks, while SY-3, chasing a flying saucer, is repelled by Rodan. The presence of the monsters confirms the belief that the aliens are set up base near Mount Fuji, part of the Izu Peninsular.\n\nSearching on foot, the army and the SY-3 crew encounter Godzilla again, and scatter among the woods. This scene comes in for particular praise from Godzilla historian David Kalat: “The special effects, while not quite matching the perfectionism of the past are astonishing in their sheer number and creative design…Godzilla’s attack on the SY-3 crew as they search Mt. Fuji on foot is a masterpiece of miniature set design and optical compositing.”\n\nYamabe, Otaga and a random military guy (sorry, even the Godzilla wikia only stretches so far) find a hidden air vent and this leads to a meeting with the Kilaaks inside a cavern. The Kilaak Queen treats the men to a video tour courtesy of the Kilaak equivalent of Google Secret Base Maps, then threatens to kill the humans if they return to Mount Fuji, before sportingly letting them go free.\n\nWith the Ogasawara Island base miraculously rebuilt, the UNSC work to gain control over the monsters, who are manipulated by electronic waves originating from the Moon. SY-3 is deployed and receives invaluable advice from Major Tada: “You will fly as planned, to your target…be sure to watch out for UFOs.” If that’s the Major, I’d hate to think what his privates are like, ba-dum-TISH.\n\nThere follows some bizarre directions for the SY-3 to follow as it flies over the lunar surface, involving “alpine ridges” and moving “north towards the swamp.” Pulp science-fiction is notoriously weak on science, but this level of laziness is unforgivable, even in a Godzilla film. Five minutes with an astronomical map would have told the makers of DAM that swamps and son aren’t features of the Moon’s landscape.\n\nThe first computer my family owned, back around 1983, was a Commodore Vic-20, and one of the few games we could afford was Lunar Lander, which required you to land a space module in a series of craggy vertical pits on an alien planet. I was reminded of this game when SY-3 lands in a narrow canyon leading to the infiltrated moonbase. Whereas the Lunar Lander had only crude pixellated rocks to contend with, the Kilaaks blast jets of fire at the SY-3. You’d have thought death rays might do the job better, but the Kilaaks as a race prefer things that look awesome over practicality.\n\nThe SY-3 crew evacuate and pile into a neat-o exploration car armed with laser cannons. A few blasts later, and the shield protecting the Kilaak base shatters, causing the resident Kilaaks to transform into slithering, snake like creatures which retreat into small grey rocks, obvs.\n\n“All your base are belong to us,” Yamabe doesn’t say as he leads his men into the remains of the Kilaak moon HQ. What he does say (or rather, someone says on his behalf), is “check out that equipment, destroy all the important parts,” which doesn’t seem in the best interests of science. What if the Kilaaks have invented a cure for cooties, or solved how to keep cereal crunchy in milk? Finding the slithery rock things, Yamabe concludes, on fairly scant evidence, that the Kilaaks can “exist only in hot climates,” and shriveled up when their shield collapsed, exposing them to cooler temperatures.\n\nBack on Earth, Major Tada and Dr Stevenson are acting like Major Buzzkill and Dr Doom, with the Englishman assuring Kyoko “the mission is a complete failure,” as the sonic waves are still reaching the Earth.\n\nWhat’s holding things up on the Moon is metalwork. Two of Mystery Science Theater 3000′s most memorable skits centered around interminable sequences in films where very little happens for a very long time: The Lost Continent (1951) and its rock-climbing expedition, and the ‘Deep Hurting’ sandstorm sequence in Hercules Against the Moon Men (1964). Had the MST crew tackled DAM, then surely its metalwork scenes would have received similar treatment. Yamabe and friends assault the Kilaak central transmitter with various devices for what feels like hours, returning to the exploration car to select another weapon before trying again. In a film featuring giant beasts smashing up the world’s capitals, Captain Yamabe’s travails with the wave transmitter is small beans, and threatens to bring DAM to a grinding halt.\n\nEventually, thank God, the device is put out of action. Back on Earth, Dr Yoshido confirms “things are normal. The monsters will listen to us now.” If what follows is considered normal in the Toho universe, we live in a beautifully unfair world here in our reality. The UNSC boffins now intend to use the monsters to attack the Kilaak base on Earth!\n\nTV crews set up on the plains around Mount Fuji awaiting the monsters’ charge. A news reporter (Saburo Iketani) with ambitions to commentate on the J-League, wonders “who will be first?” and what tactics the creatures will deploy. The first question is soon answered, as who should appear but Godzilla’s son, Minya (sometimes known as Minilla), a pasty, pudgy little creature who looks like he’d be rendered harmless by tickling his tummy. The Scrappy-Doo of the Toho monsters, Minya’s role in this battle royal is to cheer on his elders and keep out of their way as much as possible. “Anguirus is approaching from the left!” while not far behind are Mothra, Manda, Gorosaurus and Spiga, a massive spider who appeared in Son of Godzilla and is also known as Kumonga, because the Japanese monster naming committee has a terrific sense of humor.\n\n“We think Godzilla will probably be first to attack,” ventures our man at the ringside, although it’s not clear what the monsters are supposed to battle. This confusion is resolved when the Kilaaks conjure up Ghidorah (aka King Ghidorah, aka Ghidrah, aka your Mom). “I’ll contact you later,” quips the Kilaak Queen, “when you feel like giving up.” Ghidorah may have three heads, but it’s a big ask to battle ten monsters on his/its/their own. “This is horrible!” laments our commentator. “Listen to the monsters with their cries of horror and sudden death!” No sir, this is great fun, and the monsters are enjoying themselves as well, aside from Ghidorah, who gets a proper kicking. Minya applies the finishing touch with his signature attack, exhaling a deadly smoke ring, which drapes around Ghidorah’s middle head like a hoopla. If you’re watching DAM just for the tussle scenes, you won’t feel short-changed by the action experienced director Ishiro Honda serves up.\n\nThe carnage causes a landslip upon the mountain, revealing a huge blue globe – the Kilaak’s secret base. Before the monsters can attack further, a new foe materializes in the sky, a flaming dragon, albeit an unconvincing one, with bad animation making the monster appear to alter in size between each shot. This “burning monster” singes Rodan, then flies through a skyscraper. The Kilaaks, who should have cut their losses and departed for the asteroid belt, claim the dragon will obliterate Tokyo (already destroyed, you may recall) unless the humans surrender. Godzilla will have none of this nonsense, and destroys the uncovered alien base by kicking it to bits. SY-3, under Captain Yamabe’s command, takes to the air to combat the fire dragon, and soon discover it’s a Kilaak spacecraft, destroying it with a missile.\n\nDAM ends with the Yamabes and Dr Yoshido taking a helicopter tour of Monster Island, where Varan (from the mediocre Varan the Unbelievable (1958)) makes a cameo appearance, and the less camera-shy monsters settle back into their peaceful existence, unaware various major cities around the world are still smoldering from their onslaught. Godzilla and Minya watch the helicopter depart, resisting the temptation to blow it out of the sky, saving their strength for the following year’s Godzilla’s Revenge (1969).\n\nAs you will have gathered, watching DAM is not exactly a solemn experience, and there’s none of the qualities that make the other Japanese fantasy films we’ve looked at so compelling. The Kilaak’s intention to turn Earth into a kind of scientific utopia for the greater good, even if “some lives must be sacrificed” is an interesting idea, but is undeveloped, with the emphasis is on action and spectacle. DAM delivers on this score, but the series is sliding towards the juvenile nadir of Godzilla’s Revenge and Godzilla vs Megalon (1973). The human characters are mere ciphers with minimal emotional depth, giving the cast little to work with other than the struggle to keep a straight face; mercifully, director Honda keeps irony at bay, knowing a nod and a wink to the audience is fatal to fantasy.\n\nDAM is a film to cheer you up (aside from the deadening moonbase scenes), or to watch with a few understanding friends and some booze; you’ll either get kicks from the effects set-pieces or some cheap laughs from the the hack dubbing job inflicted on the film by its American distributors. Almost every line has the viewer grinding their teeth or cringing with embarrassment, making it impossible to judge DAM‘s worth outside of the purely visual. The world viewed through the lens of the Americanized DAM is as comical as it is destructive, and a cynic – and film critics are nothing if not cynical – might call this intentional. After all, the winners not only get to write history, but redo its soundtrack as well, and what little DAM has to say in Japanese is obscured by what we hear in English."
