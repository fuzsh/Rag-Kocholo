        "text": "New English Site for Director of GODZILLA and Other Toho Classics Source: Ishiro Honda Official Site The English language version of the Ishiro Honda Official Site was launched today. Honda (1911-1993) joined Toho (then known as PCL) as an assistant director in 1932. He directed his first feature film, THE BLUE PEARL (Aoi Shinju), in 1951. After co-writing and directing the original GODZILLA (Gojira, 1954), Ishiro Honda became Toho’s top director of monster and FX films; his credits include RODAN (Sora no Daikaiju Radon, 1956), THE MYSTERIANS (Chikyu Boeigun, 1957), MOTHRA (Mosura, 1961), GORATH (Yosei Gorasu, 1962), ATRAGON (Kaitei Gunkan, 1963), FRANKENSTEIN CONQUERS THE WORLD (Furankenshutain tai Chite Kaiju Baragon, 1965) WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS (Furankenshutain no Kaiju: Sanda tai Gaira, 1966), and seven Godzilla sequels from 1962-1975. In his later years, Honda collaborated with his lifelong friend Akira Kurosawa on KAGEMUSHA (1980), RAN (1985), DREAMS (Yume, 1990), RHAPSODY IN AUGUST (Hachi-gatsu no Kyoshikyoku, 1991) and MADADAYO (1993).\n\nIn 2007, the official Japanese language website devoted to Ishiro Honda was established by the director’s widow Kimi Honda and son Ryuji Honda, along with other family members, co-workers such as actor Kenji Sahara (RODAN, MATANGO, DESTROY ALL MONSTERS) and assistant director Koji Kajita (who worked with Honda on GODZILLA and many other films), and fans like popular Godzilla sculptor Yuji Kaida. Working with friends in the United States, the staff has now created a version of the site for English readers. The Ishiro Honda Official Site features a biography of the filmmaker, details and photos on all 46 movies directed by Honda, and personal messages from Honda’s family and friends (including many well-known Toho actors). The English version is a work in progress, with updates planned as additional content is translated into English. The site organizers invite fans of Ishiro Honda to check back periodically as they add more messages from Honda`s colleagues as well as essays written by the director himself.
