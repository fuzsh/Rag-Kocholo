        "text": "Destroy all Monsters (1968, 89 mins)\n\nThe original Godzilla team of director Ishiro Honda, special-effects supervisor Eiji Tsuburaya, and composer Akira Ifukube reunited for this kaiju extravaganza, which features no fewer than eleven monsters. Set in the remote future of 1999, when the people of Earth have achieved world peace by confining destructive creatures to Monsterland (until an alien race intervenes), Destroy All Monsters mounts a thrilling display of innovative action sequences and memorable images that have made it a favorite for generations of viewers.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lcdEtOA9ekI?si=y3xWQHR0njYgx6ce\n\nAll Monsters Attack (1969, 69 mins)\n\nDirector Ishiro Honda returned again for the first Godzilla movie expressly for children. Economizing by reusing effects shots from other films in the series, All Monster Attack tells the story of Ichiro, a lonely latchkey kid who finds solace in his dreams of befriending Minilla, the titular progeny of Son of Godzilla, whose parent is also often absent. In this thoughtful, human-scale story, boy and monster learn together what it means to grow up.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hVMK4BeQNBs?si=VkuXB1fJZ3bRhZU2\n\nShowtimes:\n\nSunday, August 11,2024: 12:00"
