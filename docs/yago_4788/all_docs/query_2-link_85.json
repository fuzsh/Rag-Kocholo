        "text": "I was one of those little kids who was really, really into Godzilla. At this point, I don’t even remember if my first exposure to Japanese media was anime or the goofy, child-oriented Godzilla movies of the 70s. Either way, my brother and I became obsessed with the franchise, and we made it our mission to see just about every film. I even, with my childish attention span, watched the original Japanese cut of the black-and-white Gojira (dir. Ishiro Honda, 1954).\n\nAs with most franchises that I grew up invested in, I acknowledge the senselessness of a studio maintaining and reanimating a film that has already served its time. And yet, while anything the Monopoly Mouse (Disney) owns easily loses its appeal to me, I look at Godzilla and I’m not quite sure how to feel.\n\nI can still recall a lot about those movies. I find images of the stunt actors half-in-costume between takes incredibly charming. Some remnant of my fanaticism even has me feeling weird about calling it Godzilla rather than his proper Japanese name: Gojira. But the thing about Gojira is, when that first film released in 1954, it meant something.\n\nGojira was the embodiment of the terror of the atom bombs’ devastation suffered less than ten years prior. In the film, Gojira is an ancient sea creature who is disturbed by hydrogen bomb testing, and as a result, destroys coastal cities in Japan. It is a natural force awoken by man-made weapons, laying waste to entire cities and leaving survivors afflicted with radiation sickness. A scientist successfully invents a device that can defeat the monster at the end of the film, but for fear that it would be used in future wars, he destroys his research. At the film’s conclusion, there remains a fear that humanity will continue to test its weapons and wake another ancient beast.\n\nThe sequel, Godzilla Raids Again (dir. Motoyoshi Oda), was released in 1955, adhering to similar themes with the inclusion of a second monster, Anguirus. The property then remained dormant until 1962, with the release of King Kong vs. Godzilla (dir. Ishiro Honda). And though the original director returned for this film and its next three sequels, this was undeniably the turning point for the character.\n\nKing Kong vs. Godzilla was a massive success, and in response, the studio, Toho, committed to building a franchise. This film franchise is now the longest running in film history. Globally.\n\nIf you aren’t familiar, the (at the time of this writing) thirty-two films in the Godzilla franchise are divided into different eras. They are: Shōwa (1954–1975, fifteen films), Heisei (1984–1995, seven films), Millennium (1999–2004, six films), and now Reiwa (2016 — present).\n\nThe Shōwa era already encompasses a lifetime of a film series. It began with a film that sought to comment on events whose residual fear and destruction still hang over the nation. Then it became a series of commercially marketable movies about monsters battling for the fate of the natural world. Then it fully leaned into a child-oriented series of comical costumed fight sequences. The original director continued on for a majority of the films, with the last entry being his last ever directorial effort of a feature film. The original stunt actor, Haruo Nakajima, died in 1973, with his last Godzilla performance being 1972’s Godzilla vs. Gigan (dir. Jun Fukuda). Godzilla became a cultural icon, and even after discarding its root purpose, the franchise brought joy to children and lovers of camp for years.\n\nBut the film industry doesn’t bow out. They don’t say goodbye to intellectual property and let it have its run. Franchise fatigue will pass and the call of the cash grab will never dissipate. After all, thanks to the Disney Corporation, exclusive copyright now lasts seventy years after the death of the creator.\n\nThus, the Heisei era ushered in a reboot of the series, returning Godzilla to his status as a fear-inducing force of nature that humanity must defend themselves from. It generally took on a serious tone with a more threatening costume design, pitting the titular kaiju against some of his recurring nemeses as well as new otherworldly monsters. The final film in the series, Godzilla vs. Destroyah (1995, dir. Takao Okawara) even presents a story in which Godzilla is nearing a nuclear meltdown, concluding with the death of the legendary monster.\n\nThe film is regarded as one of the better entries and there is a clear attempt to call back to the initial commentary of Gojira, but the decision to kill the Heisei continuity was truly motivated by a series of under-performing movies.\n\nGodzilla got a huge boost in popularity in the Western market with the 1998 Hollywood production of Godzilla (dir. Roland Emmerich), a movie fashioned like a turn of the century, special-effects driven thriller. The movie is largely forgotten today and not well regarded among fans. However, the Gojira iconography and TV airings of the Japanese films that followed Godzilla’s release were likely my first exposure to the franchise. (I was not even two years old when Godzilla made its theatrical release, so I genuinely wouldn’t know.)\n\nBack in Japan, the fandom and victims of franchisee-ship obviously demanded a revival of the character. And I doubt the studio was really going to let it go for long. So the Millennium Era was born in 1999 with Godzilla 2000 (dir. Takao Okawara). This era involved much more digital technology, doing away with miniature work and involving increasing amounts of CGI.\n\nEvery Hollywood production of Godzilla has been understandably lackluster. There was a pretty successful animated series in 1998 titled Godzilla: The Series, but in all, Godzilla movies remained a cult franchise in the United States.\n\nShin Godzilla, to its credit, kicked off the new Reiwa era with a much acclaimed, satirical take on government response to crises and the lack of disaster preparedness. However, Toho has wasted no time in creating sequel properties, including an anime movie trilogy on Netflix, and now plans to build a cinematic universe… again.\n\nAnd look… you are not pure capitalist swine for enjoying Godzilla movies. Nobody is evil for having some attachment to these often cheesy monster flicks, nor for deriving entertainment from a kaiju battle. They’ve clearly inspired some creators we consider to make high art films such as Guillermo Del Toro. I never smashed our many Godzilla DVDs and VHS tapes. In fact, my brother and I actually gave away our Godzilla toys to my cousin’s son and are now somewhat responsible for passing that fandom down to another child.\n\nBut my relationship to this franchise, which is a series of franchises stacked together, is just weird. When I heard people praise Shin Godzilla, I wasn’t sure in what way they were praising it. Was it just a cool action monster movie? Was it revamping itself as a social commentary? Did it go meta satire? Do I truthfully care? And what if, when watching it, it does spark some latent nostalgia fire I didn’t even know I had?\n\nFurthermore, are any of those positive emotions worth the capitalist bullshit of a never-ending studio property? I think not, but I also don’t think ending one franchise solves the issue. It’s not unlike the state of the comics industry, which is dominated by two publishers who have been recycling the same characters for longer than many of their readers have been alive. And of course, one of those properties is owned by the same behemoth corporation I’ve referenced multiple times, which has spawned one of the most depressingly bloated, stylistically bland, endless cash cows.\n\nBut I can, unlike most properties, recall my adoration of Godzilla more than any other. I can even point to more residual flavor in it than anything here. I guess what it comes down to is: isn’t the persistence of Godzilla really the shining model for Disney?\n\nGodzilla as a lasting entity should perhaps be in the hands of the public. But it won’t be. And right now, I’m caught between wanting to know what it feels like to joyously return to those films and knowing how fucked up it is that they keep going."
