        "text": "In 1954, the Allies had only just left Japan, and the country was dealing with the fallout of World War 2, and specifically the horrors unleashed upon Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Fears over the A-bomb had given way to concerns over the testing of the even more terrible H-bomb, and Japan had perhaps a unique perspective on the developing tensions of the Cold War. Godzilla was born in this climate, a film that used a very unsubtle threat as its nucleus for exploring some of the subtler issues surrounding weaponisation, environment, escalation and a traumatised society.\n\nA boat is destroyed in Japanese waters in what is reported to be an underwater eruption or explosion. The boat sent to rescue it is similarly destroyed, as is a fishing boat that picks up survivors. Stories start reaching the mainland of some kind of living thing, and then, during a stormy night on Odo Island, a monster emerges from the sea and trashes a village. A local speaks of the legend of Godzilla, a kaiju of ancient lore that used to be kept at bay by sacrificing a daughter of the village. And soon, the beast is showing itself in the light of day, and heading closer to the Japanese mainland and Tokyo itself.\n\nGodzilla has been so often remade and parodied and complicated that it’s refreshing to see the original film in all its clarity. Godzilla is here neither benevolent nor malevolent; it’s a consequence of human actions. Scientist Dr Yamane (Takashi Shimura) establishes early on that this is a monster from the (badly misdated) Jurassic period, raised from its natural habitat under the ocean by H-bomb testing that has destroyed its lair. Godzilla is some 160 feet tall, radiates nuclear energy, and can breathe radioactive fire that melts metal and spreads quickly. It’s unstoppable, with the missiles and bullets of Japan’s Defence Force ricocheting off its hide, and the quickly assembled electric grid barriers barely slowing it down. It’s a potent reminder that humanity is ill-equipped to deal with the horrors it itself is creating through its experimentation with weapons and forces it does not fully understand.\n\nWhat’s especially interesting about Godzilla is its wide portrait of several strata of Japanese society, from the islanders leading more traditional lives (who seem awed by the helicopters flying overhead), to the politicians and officials making decisions, to the individuals caught up in the destruction. While there is a central human story – Dr Yamane’s daughter Emiko (Momoko Kōchi) is caught between her lover Ogata (Akira Takarada) and her ex, the scarred scientist Dr Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata) – this is a film in which ecological and environmental catastrophe overtakes any other narrative. The scale and immediacy of the threat posed by Godzilla is such that little else matters, and pleasingly there are no human forces trying to deny this threat, no grand conspiracies. The cause is named early on, and the nation rallies to see if humanity is clever enough to deal with its own problems.\n\nThe answer is yes and no, but before then, Godzilla wreaks havoc. While some of the special effects inevitably look wonky by modern standards – especially the very obvious model houses and toy cars being destroyed – the film holds up surprisingly well. The extended central sequence of Godzilla smashing up downtown Tokyo is relentless, the monster (Haruo Nakajima) moving slowly and deliberately, riled up by attempts to attack it, and leaving devastation of an extraordinary scale behind it. Some of the cinematography, capturing Godzilla silhouetted by flames, or parts of the monster in the foreground while tiny people flee before it, is spectacular, and the composite shots are usually seamless. Ishirō Honda allows these scenes to linger, so that the audience can do nothing but sit in awe at the hopelessness of the catastrophe. In this sense, it’s a film with a bleak outlook, looking on what it has wrought and hopeless to do anything about it.\n\nThe solution comes from human ingenuity, but an ingenuity that is itself destructive, as Serizawa turns out to be an Oppenheimer figure, having created a weapon of mass destruction that will remove oxygen from water on a mass scale and dissolve all living things. The debate about whether it is right to use the weapon is brilliantly even-handed, with Serizawa pointing out that even its existence invites replication, while Ogata argues that a world that is already being destroyed has nothing to lose through its defence. Serizawa’s choice to use the weapon, but to burn all his notes and to kill himself at the moment of deployment, feels then like a genuinely tragic choice, Serizawa making himself the human scapegoat to absolve his people’s sins. But the elegiac orchestral music that plays during the slow-motion underwater sequence is as much about Godzilla’s dignity as Serizawa’s, the two dying together, perhaps the most blameless victims – and with Serizawa and his research gone, Dr Yamane’s dire warning that repeated nuclear testing will lead to another Godzilla one day leaves the film’s tone bleak rather than celebratory."
