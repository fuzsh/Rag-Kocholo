        "text": "AIP (American International Pictures, Inc.) submitted the movie to the US copyright office on May 20th, 1982 under the registration number V1908P198. It used the title Destroy All Monsters and was done in a huge batch that contained 376 other films. On February 13th, 1989, a new registration was submitted by Orion Pictures, noted as the legal successor to AIP, and Toho using the registration number V2438P072. By August 22nd, 1996, Toho appeared to have sole ownership of the US rights, as they submitted it under the registration number PA0000785448 while using the titles Destroy All Monsters and Kaijusoshingeki with no spaces in the Romaji title.\n\nWas re-released in 1972 in Japanese theaters as part of the Toho Champion Festival under the very different title \"Godzilla: The Grand Blitz Operation\" (ã´ã¸ã©é»æå¤§ä½æ¦ - Gojira Dengeki Dai Sakusen). The movie played as a triple bill with the films Daigoro vs. Goliath (1972) and Panda! Go Panda! (1972).\n\nLike with Ebirah, Horror of the Deep (1966), Teisho Arikawa was the actual special effects director for the movie, although Eiji Tsuburaya is credited for it. In reality, Tsuburaya had more of a supervisor role in regards to the special effects. Noted in Japan's Favorite Mon-Star (ISBN: 1550223488).\n\nUncredited special effects director Teisho Arikawa recalled that at the time of planning the 1968 movie it was originally going to end the Godzilla series. He noted that \"producer [Tomoyuki Tanaka] figured that all the ideas had run out.\" Naturally this was not the case, as the movie was followed the very next year by All Monsters Attack (1969). Mentioned in Japan's Favorite Mon-Star (ISBN: 1550223488).\n\nDirector Ishiro Honda was fascinated by the concept of a \"monster farm\", in particular the idea of how humanity could feed them. He noted that a \"huge amount of protein\" would be needed and envisioned cloning along with undersea farming to accomplish this. However, despite the director's fascination with this concept, the final movie devotes very little time to it outside of the brief introduction to Monsterland and showing Rodan feasting on a dolphin. The director laments that of the original complex idea only the basic \"idea of [a] Monster Island survived.\" Noted in Age of the Gods (self-published), while The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Godzilla (self-published) cites it was budgetary reasons that it wasn't focused on more in the movie."
