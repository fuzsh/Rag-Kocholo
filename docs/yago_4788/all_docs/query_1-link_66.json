The plan: bring back the original team for a battle royal blowout, which, even if too late to resuscitate the flatlining series, would still be a kaiju eiga extravaganza for the books. In the far-flung future of 1999 (imagine!), humanity has colonized the moon and eliminated the threat of creature-caused destruction by confining Earth’s monsters to Monsterland. When an alien race takes mind-control of the monster squad, then unleashes King Ghidorah as a fail-safe, a kaiju rumble of epic proportions sets off. A tour de force of special effects ingenuity combining costumed actors, puppetry, pyrotechnics, miniatures, and much else besides, Destroy All Monsters brought Godzilla back from extinction and endures as a high-water mark and fan favourite of the franchise.\n\nIn Japanese with English subtitles"
