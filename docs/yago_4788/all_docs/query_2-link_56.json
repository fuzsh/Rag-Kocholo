        "text": "So, a few months ago, I was looking ahead at my schedule and wondering where I could go next. I pondered and realized that I hadn’t done a Japanese filmmaker in some time. So, I pulled up a list of famous (deceased) Japanese filmmakers, and Honda’s name jumped out. I didn’t immediately connect it with anything, but I just knew that I had to look further.\n\nWell, of course, he’s the father of Godzilla. That pushed me off of him for a minute, to be honest. I don’t really like the Godzilla films. However, I started looking through the man’s filmography, and I was fascinated. Until he started making monster movies for Toho, he was like any other contract filmmaker at the studio, and he had a strong history of little films with very good reputations, at least according to their ratings on the IMDB. That contrast fascinated me. I looked up his first couple of films, saw that they were readily available on archive.org, and I was set. He was going to be next.\n\nAnd then, I got closer to the time to start. I began looking through his work, trying to secure links where I needed them, and I discovered that his first couple of works being available was something of a red herring. There are very large holes in his work available online or on American home video until 1959. Those holes depressed me, and I considered pulling him from the schedule. How definitive can I say my ranking is when I miss something like a dozen films that do exist in the Toho vaults?\n\nWell, as you can imagine, I decided to go ahead anyway. I’ve found a couple of extra films along the way as I prepped, so it’s going to be as good as I can make it.\n\nSo, with that said, it’s not Godzilla that fascinates me. In fact, it’s not even his other science fiction/special effects laden films that attract my attention. It’s those early films, those early melodramas that even someone like Masaki Kobayashi himself found ways to make very compelling. Also, on top of things, Akira Kurosawa called Honda his equal. That’s something to discover.\n\nSo, let’s get going! Before Godzilla tears the place up, at least.\n\nI’ll also note really quickly that I’m going to do the entire Showa Era of Godzilla films as well. He directed just over half of them. Might as well get the rest in while I’m at it, but that’s a concern for some weeks in the future.\n\nAnd as a finale note, below is the list of his films that I cannot find. If I do happen to find copies in the meantime, I’ll add them when I can:"
