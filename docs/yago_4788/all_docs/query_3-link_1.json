exploratory base on the moon.\n\nA rocket base is also functioning on the Earth, and spacecraft leave for the moon on a daily schedule.\n\n>> Announcer: Moonlight SY-3 standby.\n\nTen, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero!\n\n(SY-3 whirring) (bright exciting music) >> Narrator: An underwater base was recently established near Ogasawara Island, and scientists are studying the habits of marine life.\n\n(soft curious music) New kinds of fish are being bred here.\n\nWhile on land, all of the Earth's monsters have been collected and are living together in a place called Monsterland.\n\n(tense music) Godzilla.\n\n(screeching) Rodan.\n\n(screeching) Anguirus.\n\n(screeching) (helicopter blades whirring) Mothra and Gorosaurus.\n\n(screeching) If the monsters try to leave the spaces provided for them, a special control apparatus goes into operation.\n\nThey are confined within scientific walls.\n\nEach according to their own instincts and habits.\n\n(dramatic music) (screeching) (tense music) (screeching) (suspenseful music) Rodan can fly within a limited area of water that is shelled by a magnetic wall.\n\n(magnetic wall hums) There is food in abundance here, and the monsters are free to eat as much of it as they please.\n\n(magnetics wall hums) (tense music) (screeching) Everything is automatically controlled here from the control center that is situated deep in the Earth.\n\n(gentle pleasant music) (machines whirring) >> Dr. Otani: Is CHX all right?\n\n>> Yes, it's okay.\n\n>> That's good.\n\nThe monsters look cute when you look at them from this angle.\n\n>> Yes, they do.\n\n>> Well, I'm glad you agree.\n\nI was afraid it would frighten you.\n\n>> Oh, no.\n\n>> Now, your job will be to help me.\n\nMake a thorough study of them.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> Kyoko Manabe, a long distance call is waiting for you on panel number four.\n\n>> Go ahead.\n\n(gentle eerie music) >> Hi.\n\n>> Well!\n\nIt's Katsuo!\n\nWhere are you?\n\n>> I'm at the moon base.\n\n>> Kyoko: What?\n\n>> This phone call costs a lot.\n\n>> Oh?\n\n>> I've been very worried about you on that island.\n\n>> You have, huh?\n\nYou can see that everything's fine.\n\n>> Right, I really wasn't worried about you.\n\nI was more worried about Godzilla.\n\n>> Oh.\n\n(laughs) >> But, I really think that monsters are here too.\n\n>> Is that so?\n\n(laughs) >> Well, maybe.\n\nI can't say for sure but it worries me.\n\nCan you put Dr. Yoshido on the phone now?\n\n>> The chief's in Tokyo now attending a committee meeting.\n\n>> Well, when he comes back.\n\nHello?\n\n(static crackles) Hello?\n\n>> What's wrong?\n\n>> Hello!\n\nHello!\n\n(alert rings) >> Power station!\n\nPower station!\n\nThis is the operator speaking!\n\nPower station, what's wrong?\n\n(alarm blaring) >> Kyoko: What's going on?\n\n>> I can't understand.\n\nOh, wait.\n\nThe control apparatus is out of order.\n\nHuh?\n\nWhat's causing this?\n\nNow, we'll investigate this right away.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> Quick, check out the trouble circuit.\n\n>> Crewman: No good.\n\n>> Dr. Otani: What's wrong, huh?\n\n>> Crewman: I don't know, sir.\n\n>> (gasps)

in the process of establishing contact with Ogasawara Island.\n\n>> Crewman: Number six has Ogasawara.\n\n>> Good, amplify it.\n\n>> Right.\n\nNo good.\n\nSomeone's jamming us.\n\n>> Once more.\n\nTry to get them again.\n\n>> Doctor, this is deliberate interference.\n\n>> I fully agree with you.\n\nBut just who is causing this?\n\n>> Doctor, look.\n\n>> Dr. Yoshido: This is terrible.\n\nIt's changed so.\n\n>> Maybe volcanic action?\n\n>> Now amplify it again.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> What caused all the destruction?\n\nThose people's lives are in great danger.\n\n>> Reporter: This is a special broadcast from Radio Moscow.\n\nThis is Radio Moscow reporting.\n\nRodan has suddenly attacked Moscow.\n\n>> It's Rodan.\n\n>> Reporter: The attack started at 11 o'clock.\n\nAnd now he is destroying everything in the city.\n\nCautioned leaders have called out their defense (debris crumbles) to slow it down.\n\nThis is the same Rodan who comes from Monsterland on Ogasawara Island.\n\n>> He's in Moscow?\n\nWhat's gone wrong with him?\n\n>> Reporter: This is Paris!\n\nRadio Paris reporting!\n\nA subterranean monster has just broken through the ground!\n\nOur city's most famous landmark is about to be destroyed by the monster.\n\nBut the Paris holding their place!\n\nOh, Arc de Triomphe has been destroyed alas!\n\nIt is destroyed!\n\nThe rest of Paris will be destroyed!\n\n(screeching) >> The major cities in the world are being destroyed one by one by the monsters.\n\nMoscow by Rodan,, Beiping by Mothra, and London by Manda.\n\nParis by Baragon.\n\nHere's a special news

(reporters clamoring) >> Reporter: Doctor, what do you think has caused this?\n\n>> Reporter: How did the monsters escape?\n\n>> Couldn't you foresee this?\n\n>> We are not trying to conceal anything from you.\n\nThe truth of the matter, gentlemen, is that we don't know what has happened.\n\n>> Reporter: Is that true, Doctor?\n\n>> All I can say now is what I said 20 years ago.\n\nRemember that typhoon?\n\nWe must be on our guard.\n\n(reporters muttering) Quiet, quiet!\n\nWe know nothing.\n\nBut every one of us fears the very same thing.\n\nWe're trying to find the answer to this.\n\n>> But Doctor Yoshido, Monsterland is close by, so why wasn't Tokyo attacked?\n\n>> I'd like to know that answer myself!\n\nNow please excuse me.\n\nI'm tired.\n\n(gentle eerie music) >> Moonlight SY-3.\n\nMoonlight SY-3!\n\n>> Crewman: This is Moonlight SY-3, over.\n\n>> Return to the base.\n\n>> Crewman: Why, what's wrong?\n\n>> You'll find out.\n\nHurry and come back.\n\n(SY-3 whirring) (beeping) >> Huh?\n\n(tense music) Hey!\n\nCatch it!\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> We can't let it get away.\n\n>> But we have to return.\n\n>> Hold on a minute.\n\nThat's a UFO out there.\n\n(tense music) >> This is too dangerous.\n\n>> What is it?\n\n>> Crewman: Moonlight SY-3!\n\nMoonlight SY-3, what's wrong?\n\n>> Again?\n\n>> Humph.\n\n(SY-3 whirs) >> But, what's going on down there?\n\nIs it some kind of an emergency?\n\nIs that why they called and asked for our help?\n\n>> They didn't ask for us help.\n\n>> Then, what do they want?\n\n>> They want us to return.\n\n>> Huh?\n\n(SY-3 whirring) >> We'll guide you in a few moments.\n\nLanding place is Monsterland.\n\nYou'll go underneath the ground.\n\nI know that you're the only people who can do this job.\n\nWatch out for possible trouble.\n\n>> Huh?\n\nShould we be armed?\n\n>> Yes, watch yourselves.\n\n>> All right.\n\nWe're on it.\n\n>> We're on the guiding beam.\n\n>> All right, let's go.\n\nEveryone, get ready to land!\n\n>> Reverse engines, okay.\n\n(SY-3 whirs) >> Hang on, everyone!\n\n(dramatic music) This is Moonlight SY-3.\n\nWe're now at the entrance of the control center.\n\n>> Good.\n\nSome creature has taken over there.\n\nYour job is to find out what it is.\n\nThis is dangerous so watch your step.\n\n>> Katsuo: Right.\n\n>> Gas and acid?\n\nThey check out all right.\n\n>> Good, let's go.\n\n(dramatic music) Careful.\n\n>> Right.\n\n(tense music) >> Hey!\n\nLook!\n\n>> Kyoko: Well, welcome back to Earth.\n\n>> Katsuo: Kyoko!\n\nDoctor!\n\n>> Have a good trip?\n\n>> Katsuo: What's going on around here?\n\n>> I didn't think that you'd really come here.\n\n>> Can you explain this?\n\nDoctor!\n\n>> Don't get yourself so excited.\n\nI want all of you to cooperate with us.\n\nThings will run a lot smoother then.\n\n>> Cooperate?\n\n>> What do you think you're talking about?\n\nYou let all the monsters loose when the chief was gone.\n\n>> No, you're wrong.\n\nWe're controlling them from here.\n\n>> Remote control?\n\n>> Watch the screen.\n\nMothra is now near Beiping.\n\n(train horn blaring) (train horn blaring) (brakes squealing) (explosion booms) Godzilla is here.\n\n(boat horn blaring) (screeching) (explosion bangs) And Rodan is flying.\n\n(screeching) (explosion bangs) If we wanna call these monsters back, it's a simple process.\n\nNow, I'll introduce you to the inventor of this unit.\n\nFollow me.\n\n>> Come this way.\n\n(gentle hypnotic music) >> I have been waiting for you.\n\n>> They must have questions for you.\n\n>> I want you to know that I'm not your enemy.\n\nIt is my dream to build a new scientific civilization on Earth with the help of you people.\n\n>> You've just destroyed some of our major cities.\n\nNow, who are you?\n\n>> Katsuo, why don't you let her finish her story?\n\n>> Listen, Kyoko!\n\n>> In order to build this scientific civilization, we have to sacrifice some lives.\n\n>> What's that?\n\n>> Where are you from?\n\n>> Kilaak.\n\n>> Kilaak?\n\n>> From outer space.\n\nThere are many small planets moving between Mars and Jupiter.\n\nAnd this lady comes from one of them.\n\n>> Do you really believe that?\n\n>> Yes, I do.\n\nI highly respect this person because of her scientific ability.\n\nThe remote control unit is just one example.\n\nShe's truly brilliant.\n\nA living genius.\n\n(buzzing) (grunting) >> Okada, come back!\n\n(gun fires) (bullets ricochets) (chuckles) >> See?\n\nBetter give up.\n\nYou cannot penetrate that wall.\n\n>> What will you do?\n\n>> You're coming with me.\n\nWhere are the others?\n\n>> They are all right.\n\nWhy don't you leave them alone?\n\n>> You better call them.\n\n>> Don't bother them.\n\nWill you join us?\n\n(magnetic field hums) >> No, I won't.\n\nAnd I'm taking some of you out of here.\n\n>> The Captain's right.\n\nNow get ready to leave.\n\n>> Now move!\n\n(magnetic field hums) (poison gas hissing) (suspenseful music) Hey, it's gas!\n\nQuick!\n\nStop!\n\n(gun fires) (grunting) (grunting) (suspenseful music) Hurry up!\n\n(gun fires) >> Oh, Captain!\n\nQuick!\n\n(crewmen coughing) Here's the masks!\n\n(suspenseful music) >> Katsuo: Catch her!\n\n(grunting) Take him to the ship!\n\nKyoko!\n\nKyoko!\n\n(gunshot whizzes) >> Crewman: Look out!\n\nLook out!\n\n(guns firing) (suspenseful music) >> Katsuo: Get back!\n\n(gun fires) Get back!\n\n(gunshots banging) (suspenseful music) >> Captain!\n\nCaptain!\n\n(gunfire whizzes) >> Oh, Captain!\n\n>> Now, let's go!\n\n(SY-3 whirs) (suspenseful music) >> What's happened to you, Doctor?\n\nHave you been brainwashed?\n\n>> He won't answer any of our questions.\n\nSomething's wrong with him.\n\nDoctor Otani.\n\nIf you want to be saved, you'll have to answer our questions.\n\nUnderstand?\n\n>> I think that he's faking.\n\nHe's keeping quiet because he knows too much!\n\n>> The self-defense force is standing by to protect us.\n\nWe've checked out the island.\n\nAnd no one's there.\n\nTell us where their new base of operations is, and, of course, we'll go easy on you.\n\nDon't you care what happens to you now?\n\n>> What now?\n\n(Dr. Otani screaming) (body thuds) (gasps) >> Katsuo: Doctor!\n\n>> Kyoko: Don't touch him.\n\n>> It's you!\n\n>> You're all slaves to the people of Kilaak.\n\n>> Come with us quietly.\n\nYou won't get hurt.\n\nNow, come on.\n\n>> Huh?\n\nWhere are you taking that man?\n\n>> You be quiet!\n\nI think, we should use these on this fool.\n\n(gasps) The special police.\n\n(grunting) (gunshots zooming) (gunshots banging) (gunshot banging and zooming) Let's go.\n\n>> Hey, hey!\n\n(gunshots banging) (grunting) (gunshots banging and zooming) >> Wait!\n\n>> Surgeon: Scalpel.\n\n(dramatic music) Was he hard of hearing?\n\n>> No.\n\n>> Surgeon: It's not a hearing aid.\n\n(dramatic music) >> It's hard to tell what it is.\n\nBut I think it's some kind of metal.\n\nI can tell you right now that this is some sort of miniature transmitter.\n\nBut why would they put something like this inside his body?\n\n>> Doctor, is this how he controlled the monsters?\n\n>> Possibly Otani.\n\nThe monsters were being controlled by the same device.\n\n>> That's right.\n\nAnd those Kilaak people were probably afraid that we'd find out about this.\n\n>> Mm.\n\n>> They must be sending radio waves from somewhere.\n\nIf we can find these waves, we can jam them.\n\n>> All right, I'll begin my search for the source of the waves from the sky.\n\n(high-pitch hums) We've got something!\n\nCheck out where it comes from!\n\n>> Right.\n\n(birds chirping) (metal clanks) >> Huh?\n\n(high-pitch hums) >> The waves are coming from a mountain area.\n\n>> Hmm.\n\n(cows lowing) (birds chirping) I'm busy.\n\nI don't know what kind of a stone it is, but I don't have any time to take it somewhere to have it examined.\n\n>> Won't you help?\n\n>> Boy: Officer!\n\n>> Huh?\n\n>> Look up in the sky.\n\n>> Up there, look.\n\n>> Oh!\n\n>> Villager: What is it?\n\n(bird twittering) >> Oh, it's Rodan!\n\n>> It can't be.\n\nHere.\n\n>> What is it?\n\n>> That looks like the moon rocket, SY-3.\n\n>> Huh?\n\n>> Gee.\n\n>> Maybe I told you that my young son is on the moon.\n\n>> Yes, I remember.\n\n(laughs) Is he all right?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n(birds chirping) Huh?\n\n>> Huh?\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\n>> We're checking a wave.\n\n>> Officer: Well, go right ahead.\n\n>> Thank you.\n\n(radar beeping) (birds chirping) >> Boy: Look, he's using radar.\n\n(radar beeps) >> And now, it has finally been established by the members of the United Nations Science Committee that this object that looks like a stone is being used by the people of the planet Kilaak.\n\nThey have been manipulating the monsters and throwing the entire world into a state of mass panic.\n\nIt was found in Dover.\n\nIn Spain, in steeples of a churches.\n\nAlso, it was found in the Alps, in very large chunks of ice.\n\nIn Guam, it was found inside of a coconut.\n\nNow, Dr. Yoshido, will give us an explanation.\n\n>> This object is a special sending and receiving device that's limited.\n\nWe have estimated its power in terms of kilometers.\n\nWe can assume the monsters are manipulated by these special machines.\n\nNext, in regards to the members captured by the people of Kilaak, we presumed that they have all returned to their own countries.\n\nWith your cooperation, we will find them very soon.\n\n>> Reporter: These men are dangerous.\n\nMinoru Kudo, age 35.\n\nTetsuo Ise, age 30.\n\nHero Kara, age 28.\n\nKyoko Manabe, age 23.\n\nPlease, watch for this girl.\n\nAlso, Michael Dawson, age 32.\n\nHe's a British subject.\n\nElmer Hughes, age 29.\n\n(train wheels rattling) >> Police: You're all right.\n\nGo ahead.\n\n>> Excuse me, we have to check you.\n\nWe're sorry.\n\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n>> Go ahead, please, thank you.\n\n(engines revving on street) All right, go on.\n\n(alarm wailing) (people shrieking and yelling) (people clamoring and shouting) (alarm wailing) (people clamoring and shouting) (suspenseful music) >> Reporter: Rodan is now flying over districts seven and eight.\n\nEveryone, take shelter at once.\n\n>> He's come at last.\n\n>> Yes.\n\n(alarm wails) >> The people have all taken shelter.\n\n>> That's right.\n\n>> An emergency.\n\n>> Announcer: Godzilla is now in district one.\n\n>> What?\n\n(suspenseful music) (roaring) (roaring) >> Manda!\n\n>> Manda's arrived.\n\n(grunting) (hissing) (roaring) (suspenseful music) (roars) (Manda hissing) (explosion booms)

>> Now.\n\nReady, fire!\n\n(thrilling exciting music) (guns firing) (Godzilla roars) (roaring) (guns firing) (screeching) (debris crashing) (gunfire zooming) (Godzilla roars) (screeching) >> I didn't think Tokyo would escape this terror but Rodan, Godzilla, and Manda here at the same time.\n\n>> That's correct.\n\nNew York, London, Moscow they were all very lucky.\n\n(alert wails) >> An emergency!\n\nAn emergency!\n\nMothra has appeared in district number five!\n\n(thrilling exciting music) (debris crashing) (people yelling) (thrilling exciting music) (guns firing) (Godzilla roaring) (explosion booms) (somber music) (people chatting) >> Oh.\n\nThe damage is horrible.\n\n>> Yes, Tokyo is in ruins.\n\nThere were four of them.\n\nThe people of Kilaaks are now set up in Izu.\n\n>> Izu?\n\n>> The hot springs are dried up.\n\nJust like what happened in Monsterland.\n\n>> You think there's some sort of a connection there?\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\nThey've also got another monster.\n\n>> Baragon?\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\nWhile all of the other large cities were being attacked, Tokyo was left alone.\n\nYou see, they turned our attention away from Japan to build a new base in Izu.\n\n>> I see.\n\nAnd now I'll bet that they're using something new.\n\n>> Right.\n\nThat's why your job is to find out where they are.\n\nYou'll go underground with your spaceship, and if you're lucky, you will find them and put an end to these people once for all.\n\n>> Well, hello.\n\nHow are you?\n\n>> I am fine, and you?\n\n>> Hello.\n\nKyoko Manabe!\n\nYou!\n\n>> Let's go to another room.\n\n>> No, I have something I want to say to everyone who's in this room.\n\n>> I know what you'll say.\n\nI've heard it all before!\n\n>> You don't want to hear me, but maybe the others do, especially the newspaper people.\n\n>> All right, where are you from?\n\n>> From the base at Izu.\n\n>> And what is this base?\n\n>> It's a base of operations for all the people of Kilaak.\n\n>> Did you come here to deliver a message to us?\n\n>> Yes.\n\nIf all of you agree to let them stay here and will abide by their laws and rules, the monsters will go back and live in peace on Ogasawara Island.\n\n>> Unless we agree to these terms, the monsters will destroy all of us.\n\nWell, this is just like blackmail!\n\n>> I am talking to the others.\n\nYou keep quiet!\n\n>> Come here!\n\n>> (grunting) What do you want?\n\n(Kyoko and Katsuo grunting) >> Don't move!\n\nYou're being controlled by those people!\n\n(gasping and grunting) Keep still!\n\nDoctor!\n\n(Kyoko gasping) (gasps and sobs) Well, this is what's controlled her.\n\n(cameras clicking) Dr. Otani was murdered.\n\nAnd others at Monsterland are being manipulated just like this.\n\nDoctor.\n\n(reporters muttering) >> We will investigate.\n\n>> We're short of time.\n\n>> Kyoko!\n\nKyoko, wake up!\n\nKyoko!\n\nShe's all right.\n\nAnd now, we have to help her out.\n\n(gasps) Take it easy.\n\n>> Listen, you've got to help.\n\nWe have to know where this special Kilaak base is.\n\n>> Kilaak base?\n\n>> That's right.\n\nWhere is it located in Izu?\n\n>> I think.\n\nI think.... (gasps) The poison gas!\n\n(sobbing) >> Her memory is a complete blank because of them.\n\n>> All right.\n\n(thrilling exciting music) >> Everyone is ready now for action.\n\n>> Commander: Ground troops are in position!\n\n>> All right.\n\n>> Ready to fire?\n\n>> Soldier: Ready to fire.\n\n>> Now, lets go!\n\n>> Crew: Right!\n\n>> Crewman: SY-3 on target.\n\n>> Right!\n\n(roaring) (tense music) >> Look, there's Godzilla!\n\n>> Cut rockets!\n\nEmergency!\n\n(roaring) >> All right, men.\n\n(Godzilla roars) (suspenseful music) Ready, fire!\n\n>> Ready, fire!\n\n(rockets swooshing) (guns firing) (Godzilla screeching) (explosion booms) (guns firing) (dramatic music) >> Commander: Hey, what's wrong?\n\n>> They're jamming us.\n\n(roaring) (suspenseful music) (explosion booming) >> Soldier: Anguirus!\n\n>> Anguirus?\n\nWhy that!\n\n(roaring) (explosion booms) (dramatic music) >> Commander: Stop at once!\n\nStop right now!\n\n>> Oh, no.\n\n>> Well, let's go back.\n\n>> Why, those.\n\n>> So, they've won again.\n\nHey.\n\n(spaceship hums) >> Let's follow.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> It's headed towards Fuji.\n\n>> This has something to do with those Kilaaks.\n\nHurry, check out its bearing.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> 15 degrees.\n\n>> What?\n\n(suspenseful music) >> Captain, let's not run away.\n\nLet's fight it.\n\n>> We'll do that later on.\n\nBut right now, let's get out of here.\n\nOpen all rockets!\n\n>> Open all rockets.\n\n>> Open them all the way!\n\n(SY-3 roars) Huh, that's funny.\n\nRodan was our escort.\n\n>> But we didn't find their base.\n\n>> Well, we have some idea of where it is.\n\nIf we investigate the area, we'll find out where the Kilaaks are.\n\n(birds chirping) >> Forward!\n\n(birds chirping) (roaring) (suspenseful music) >> Scatter, scatter!\n\nHurry up!\n\n(roaring) (suspenseful music) (roaring) Let's go, quick!\n\n>> You all right?\n\n>> I'm all right.\n\n(dramatic music) (Godzilla screeching) (wind blowing) >> I think this is it.\n\n(ominous music) (rock thuds) >> Huh?\n\n(grunts) >> Be careful.\n\n>> It won't move.\n\n>> This is their cave, all right.\n\nNow, let's find those people.\n\n>> Right.\n\n(suspenseful music) (magnetic shield chimes) >> All right, step back, I'll shoot.\n\n>> No good.\n\n(gentle music) >> Welcome.\n\nI'm glad to see you all again.\n\nAnd now, you will finally see our base.\n\n>> What's that?\n\n>> I lured all of you here today because I want to tell you something.\n\n>> You lured us?\n\n(machines whirring) Look over there.\n\nNow, I see.\n\n>> That's it.\n\n>> Hmm.\n\n>> Yes, what you just saw is the same spaceship that you saw near the moon.\n\n(spaceship hums) (gentle music) So now you're convinced that we're from outer space.\n\n>> That's right.\n\nWhat do you have on your mind?\n\n>> Peace terms.\n\n>> Peace terms?\n\n>> I want Major Tada to listen with care.\n\nThe Earth does not belong to you people.\n\nFuji's secret underground area belongs to every man, woman and child in the Kilaak race.\n\nAnd if you fools intrude on us anymore, you'll die!\n\n>> What?\n\n(door whirs) >> Let's go.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> Narrator: Meanwhile, a new control center has been built on Ogasawara Island.\n\nEvery effort is being used to construct a machine that will bring the monsters under control.\n\n(machines humming) (whirs) (clacking) >> Oh, it was the moon.\n\nThe waves came from there!\n\nNow, we will stop them.\n\n(eerie curious music) >> We won't land!\n\nWe're not going to stop fighting until we're rid of those people.\n\nLet's go over the plans again.\n\n>> Well, I'm ready.\n\n>> Look at the map.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> You will fly just as planned right on target.\n\nVery near the Cassini crater in Alpine Valley.\n\nBe sure and watch out for UFOs.\n\nKeep flying low.\n\n>> Right, we will.\n\n(thrilling exciting music) We'll approach from the left side.\n\nThen we'll pass a mass of vapor.\n\nThen by the left slope of the Alpine ridge.\n\nThen we'll move north toward a swamp, and arrive near the crater.\n\n>> Yes, sir.\n\n(thrilling exciting music) >> It looks like a UFO.\n\nAnd it's coming right behind us!\n\n(spaceship hums) >> Do you see it?\n\n>> Yes, it means trouble.\n\n>> What now?\n\n>> Does anyone want to turn back?\n\n>> Let's go on.\n\nWe'll win the battle this time.\n\n>> All right, let's go.\n\nTime is running out for the human race!\n\nStop jets!\n\n>> Stop jets!\n\n>> Ready everyone?\n\nHere we go.\n\nDescend!\n\n>> Crewman: Descend.\n\n(rocks rumbling) >> Katsuo: Stop!\n\n>> Crewman: Stop!\n\n>> Ground car ready!\n\n>> Crewman: Ground car ready.\n\n(fires whooshes) (suspenseful music) >> Fuel off!\n\n>> Crewman: Fuel off!\n\n>> Katsuo: Cooler ready!\n\n>> Crewman: Cooler ready.\n\n(suspenseful music) >> Time's running out!\n\n>> Hurry up!\n\n(suspenseful music) >> Crewman: The temperature's going up!\n\n>> What's wrong?\n\n>> No good.\n\nAt this rate, the fuel tanks will explode!\n\nWhat now?\n\n>> It's too late.\n\nTo the car, quick!\n\n>> Crewmen: Right!\n\n(suspenseful music) >> Stop!\n\n>> Stop.\n\n>> Get ready to fire!\n\n>> Crewman: We're ready to fire!\n\n>> Fire!\n\n(laser buzzing) (suspenseful music) (explosion bangs) (cave rumbling) (rocks crumbling) >> Hmm.\n\nSir.\n\n>> Commander: Huh?\n\n>> SY-3 is now in combat.\n\nAnd they're near Mount Cassini.\n\n>> All right, let's get in touch with the moon.\n\nI hope their winning.\n\n>> We can't tell what's happened yet.\n\nWe'll send a report as soon as we know.\n\n(phone beeping) >> This is the moon base, go ahead.\n\n>> That's enough.\n\n>> Oh.\n\n>> If they fail, then we'll be attacked.\n\nAll of this base will be completely destroyed.\n\nStay alert for anything.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> Let's go.\n\nNow, you three, come on.\n\nFollow me.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> The others wait.\n\n>> Crew: Yes, sir.\n\n>> Oh, look.\n\n(electricity crackling) Now, you two, check out that equipment.\n\nDestroy all of the important parts.\n\n>> Crew: Yes, sir.\n\n>> I had no idea we'd done this much damage.\n\n>> Even these kind of people have their weak points.\n\nLook!\n\n(gentle music) >> Ooh, there too!\n\n>> They're from Kilaak.\n\n>> Huh?\n\n>> Seems they can only exist in a hot climate.\n\nWe broke down their wall, and then the temperature went down.\n\n>> They're dead?\n\n>> Well, I don't know.\n\n>> Crewman: Captain, Captain!\n\n>> Check them out.\n\n>> Right.\n\n(dramatic music) >> Crewman: What is this thing?\n\n>> I don't know.\n\n(machine humming) Now, we'll remove it and take it to Earth.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> Moon base!\n\nMoon base!\n\n>> No answer?\n\n>> No, there's none at all.\n\n>> Dr. Yoshido: No answer and no waves.\n\n>> Is it a failure then?\n\n(machines beeping) Are we all doomed?\n\n>> No good.\n\nNow, we'll have to burn it loose!\n\n>> Right!\n\n>> What happened?\n\n>> Bring the tools.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> Now, open it.\n\n>> Right.\n\n(grunting) >> Power!\n\n>> Okay.\n\n(grunting) >> Let's go!\n\n(monitors beeping) >> Considering the amount of time that has elapsed since the battle started, I'm afraid the mission is a complete failure.\n\n(monitors beeping) (machine hums) >> Now, switch in!\n\n(suspenseful music) What's wrong?\n\n>> No use, the circuit's burning!\n\n>> So what?\n\nPut the switch in again!\n\n>> The voltage is too high!\n\n>> Hurry up and do it!\n\nHear me?\n\n>> Right.\n\n(suspenseful music) >> They did it!\n\n(sighs) The waves are gone.\n\nNow, hurry!\n\nWe'll control the monsters from here.\n\n>> Crew: Right!\n\n>> Hurry!\n\nThe Kilaaks on Earth know what we've done!\n\n(thrilling exciting music) (explosions banging) >> Dr. Yoshida: They're still alive?\n\n>> Yes, they are alive.\n\nBut it'll take a temperature of several thousand degrees to awaken them.\n\n>> They're living metal, right?\n\n>> That's right.\n\n>> This explains why they like the volcanic region of Mt.\n\nFuji.\n\n>> Their scientific level is far higher than ours, but their number is very small.\n\nIt must have taken the Kilaaks thousands of years to get to this stage.\n\n>> That long?\n\nThat's amazing!\n\n>> It is.\n\nUnder very high temperatures, these people might be able to live forever.\n\n>> Live forever?\n\n>> That's right.\n\n>> But they are helpless in low temperature.\n\n>> Mm, that settles our means of attack.\n\nDo you agree with me, Doctor?\n\n>> I do.\n\n>> Make the plans.\n\n>> Right.\n\n(alert wailing) (Godzilla roaring) >> Crewman: Oh, no, Godzilla again!\n\n(monitor chimes) >> Hello!\n\n>> Doctor.\n\n>> That's where you are.\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> How are you?\n\nI'd like to thank you now.\n\n>> Doctor, don't thank me now because Godzilla's here!\n\n>> What?\n\nIs that true?\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> Godzilla's in Tokyo?\n\n>> Yes!\n\n>> Now I see.\n\nWe have just finished our new machine, and we're trying it out.\n\n>> What?\n\n>> And he's close by?\n\n>> But, Doctor.\n\n>> Hmm, the monsters will listen to us.\n\nThings are normal.\n\nI've just worked out a new plan.\n\nWait and see what happens now!\n\n(birds chirping) >> Today, the Fuji area will experience something different.\n\nIn deep silence, the forest seem to be waiting for the monsters charge on the Kilaak's base of operations here.\n\nAnd the defense force is in position.\n\nHowever, no monsters are in sight.\n\nAnd now the question is who will be first?\n\nGodzilla, Rodan, or Anguirus?\n\nHere they come.\n\nAnd they're... Ah, to the right and down a little bit.\n\nJust beyond those woods over there!\n\nGodzilla!\n\n(suspenseful music) No, it's not.\n\nThe first is the son of Godzilla.\n\n(roaring) And after him, I see Godzilla himself!\n\n(roaring and screeching) And next is Mothra.\n\nBoth Godzilla and Mothra are in the same area.\n\n(screeching and roaring) Now we can see Anguirus.\n\nAnguirus is approaching from the left.\n\nComing next are Manda, Baragon, Gorosaurus.\n\nAnd Spiga's there.\n\nThey're all coming to the base of Mt.\n\nFuji to attack the people of Kilaak.\n\nNow, Rodan's here.\n\nWe can see him in the background.\n\n(monsters roaring) He's now heading toward Mothra and Godzilla.\n\n(screeching) We think Godzilla will probably be the first to attack.\n\nHe seems to be quite ready to fight.\n\nThe Kilaaks have shown no reaction to what's going on here today.\n\nGodzilla will lead these monsters in mortal combat, and I'm sure they'll win.\n\n(roaring) >> Sir, I've just discovered a UFO.\n\n>> What's that?\n\n(monster screeching) Ghidorah.\n\n(Ghidorah screeches) He's not from the Earth.\n\nThey called him.\n\n>> The control section is out.\n\nWhat now?\n\n>> Godzilla and the others will unite their strength.\n\nRight now!\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> What's happened?\n\nThe Kilaaks!\n\n>> Ghidorah is a space monster.\n\nThe monsters from Earth cannot win.\n\nI will get in touch with you when you feel like giving up.\n\n>> Why, that.\n\n(Ghidorah screeches) >> It's Ghidorah.\n\nGhidorah, the space monster!\n\nHe's going to attack them from the sky!\n\n(screeching) The monsters are waiting.\n\n(monsters screeching) (tense ominous music) Oh, Ghidorah is ready to start his attack!\n\n(suspenseful music) (monsters screeching) (lazar crackles) (monsters screeching) (grunting) (wind blowing) (suspenseful music) (screeching) (lazar hums) (screeching) (screeching) (suspenseful music) (screeching) (screeching) (screeching) (screeching) (dramatic music) (screeching) This is horrible!\n\nListen to the monsters and their cries of horror and sudden death!\n\n(suspenseful music) (screeching) (screeching) (Godzilla roars) (screeching) (screeching) (roaring) (monsters screeching) (screeching) (suspenseful music) (Godzilla's footsteps thudding) (screeching) (bone crunching) (screeching) (roaring) (suspenseful music) (screeching) (screeching and roaring) (dramatic music) (grunting excitingly) (wind whistling) (screeching and roaring) (Rodan screeches) (wind whistling) A burning monster is on its way.\n\n>> A burning monster?\n\nI've never heard of one!\n\n(explosion bangs) >> It's from space and it's alive!\n\n>> Doctor, it's coming closer to us!\n\n>> Quick, hide!\n\n(crewmen clamoring) (explosions banging) (static crackling on monitor) (machine humming) >> Dr. Yoshido's machine has been destroyed by the Fire Dragon.\n\nIf you don't give up, things will get a lot worse for you.\n\n>> What now?\n\nDo we attack?\n\n>> The great Fire Dragon will burn all of Tokyo within a few hours.\n\n(Godzilla roaring) >> Godzilla!\n\n(tense music) >> At last, he's found the underground base of the Kilaak people.\n\n(roaring) (suspenseful music) (roaring) >> They're going to attack them.\n\n>> The monsters will fight even if there's no machine.\n\n>> They know their enemies by natural instinct.\n\nNow the Kilaaks must pay!\n\n(explosion bangs) >> Go back!\n\nGo back!\n\n(electricity crackling) (suspenseful music) (explosions banging) (cave rumbling) (dramatic music) >> Katsuo: We're saved!\n\n>> We're not safe yet.\n\nThe Fire Dragon will be back soon.\n\n>> All right, I'll shoot him out of the sky!\n\n>> Katsuo!\n\n(thrilling exciting music) (screeching and roaring) >> The dragon's ahead of us to the left!\n\n>> All right, get the cooling missile ready!\n\nFire!\n\n>> No good, the gear doesn't working!\n\n>> What's that?\n\n>> A misfire!\n\n(thrilling exciting music) (shouting and grunting) >> Now, shoot it down!\n\n>> Crewman: Right!\n\n>> Let it pass and then pursue it!\n\nYou got me?\n\n>> Right!\n\n>> Get ready!\n\nFire!\n\n(grunting) Now we'll get it!\n\n(thrilling exciting music) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting and straining) Phew!\n\n(spaceship hums) What's that thing?\n\nI see!\n\nThe dragon was really a saucer!\n\n>> Everything's clear.\n\nWhat now, Captain?\n\n>> All right.\n\nFire!\n\n(thrilling exciting music) (explosion bangs) We did it!\n\n(crew cheering) >> We won!\n\n(explosions banging) (rocks rumbling) (explosions banging) (helicopter whirring) (mellow music) (monsters screeching) (grunting) (screeching) (gentle music) (screeches and grunts) (screeching) (gentle music) (roars lowly) (bright music) (dramatic theatrical music)"
