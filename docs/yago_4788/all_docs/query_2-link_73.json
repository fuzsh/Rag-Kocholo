        "text": "A Walk Amongst Monsters #56\n\n“We’re after a diamond robbery gang. What do monsters have to do with it?”\n\nOops, look like Honda spilled some Kaiju into his cops and robbers film!\n\nFor having his name be the title of the film, Dogora doesn’t take much priority. This is primarily a film about cops trying to stop a diamond smuggling group. Dogora is just there to shake things up every once and a while. It’s not the worst idea, having a Kaiju rampage be the backdrop for a heist film, but without Dogora this film is average at best.\n\nWe don’t even get to see him in all his glory until about an hour in! It’s easily the coolest scene…\n\nA monster from space set on eating delicious diamonds for their sweet sweet carbon interrupts the interplay between a gang of jewel thieves and the police who are chasing them.\n\nFull disclosure, I'm not the biggest creature feature person, and the choice to make the monster mostly invisible here doesn't help matters. So don't mind the low rating too much, if you're into the genre you'll get more than I did out of this. There's a lot of drag to this one. But it is admittedly really cool to see a mash up of crime and monster from space movie. It's kind of inventive to have the B plot be saving the world and spend just as much (if not…\n\nLayer of the Leviathan’s\n\nSins of the Shimmering Stone ft. Dogora seijin\n\nDogora has gotta be one of the most superfluous kaiju/sejin’s I’ve ever seen. Bro gets top billing and a film named after him yet feels as though he was a last minute addition to one that was already being made.\n\nI remember watching this back when I was younger and enjoying it a fair bit, but upon a rewatch I can’t tell if that was because I simply had different tastes back then or if it was due to the fact the only version of the film I had was the English dub and I found it amusing cause as it stands currently this was a real nothing burger…\n\n10th Ishirō Honda (after Latitude Zero, The Mysterians, Matango, The H-Man, Mothra, Varan, Godzilla, Rodan and Gorath)\n\nA strange film that fails largely because of the attempt to meld a crime plot with a monster invasion. It chooses to flesh out the former at the expense of the latter. Though both can be very routine stories, especially the routine of identifying the monster, the diamond-smuggling plot is a hackneyed variation of the old 'cross-double cross' routine that's been done many times in better ways. The H-Man manages to do it in a much smarter and stylish way, though I feel the integration of monster and crime here is much more fluid. The big problem is that the copncept behind Dogora…\n\nJapanuary 2022: Ishirō Honda\n\nI love Ishirō Honda. Of course, my adoration for his work started with Godzilla. Last year, I got bit by the kaiju bug and never turned back, so I have seen several films from the Godzilla Universe and quite a few Honda deep-cuts too. Some of my favorite movies of his ended up being Gorath, H-Man, and The Human Vapor, all wonderfully realized sci-fi films full of inspired special effects, utilizing excellent scores, and anchored by thrilling and moving stories. So, all it took was one look at Dogora's poster for me to get excited. I mean, look at it!\n\nMuch to dismay, though, Dogora is incredibly dull. Not the creature Dogora, but the story surrounding…\n\nMe thinks I know why the Criterion Channel chose this as part of their Ishiro Honda: King of the Monsters Collection. In the past month I've hardly looked at that service so I know it will be used more often in November. They have more than one film noir from the former 20th Century Fox I expect to watch, along with other things and a collection I haven't dived into yet despite it debuting a month ago. Quite a few movies in that set have already been watched & reviewed yet there are others that haven't and this in particular captured my attention.\n\nYou see, it's mainly a movie revolving around some ne'erdo-wells looking to steal some diamonds... while in the…\n\nDogora is a somewhat obscure kaiju film directed by Ishirō Honda. Coming out the same year as classics like Mothra vs Godzilla and Ghidrah the Three-Headed Monster, it is somewhat understandable that it is less remembered. I actually have seen this movie once before. I checked it out from my local library several years ago. For some reason, I didn’t remember much about it. After this viewing, I have no idea why, because this movie is a blast!\n\nDogora is really more of a crime thriller with occasional bits of kaiju action. I suppose that could be why I didn’t remember it that well, but this movie is legitimately fun to watch even with the lack of screentime for the…"
