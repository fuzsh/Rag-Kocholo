        "text": "If you have been following my reviews over the past few weeks, you would have noticed that the Godzilla franchise has gone through some major changes, some for the worse. Ever since Invasion of Astro-Monster, the overall quality of each film decreased drastically, culminating in one of my least favorite films, Son of Godzilla. With that in mind, you might be excited to hear that Destroy All Monsters is a return to form, and is a drastic improvement for the series.\n\nDestroy All Monsters was actually intended to be the last Godzilla movie ever, and as such, Toho decided to load this movie with as many of their monsters as they possibly could. Not only does this movie bring back Godzilla veterans like Mothra, Rodan, King Ghidorah, Kumonga, Angurius and Minilla; but also brings in monsters from their other properties. We get Manda from Atragon, Varan from Varan the Unbelievable, Baragon from Frankenstein Conquers the World, and Gorosaurus from King Kong Escapes.\n\nMany fans regard this film as quintessential, and required-watching for anyone who even has a mild interest in classic monster films. Destroy All Monsters is referenced heavily in popular culture, containing many iconic scenes and even musical compositions. Many of the original Godzilla production team returns, which is felt throughout the film. However, none is more obvious than Akira Ifukube returning as the musical composer.\n\nUnfortunately, Destroy All Monsters saw poor returns at the Box Office, barely getting back what they spent on production. Meanwhile, the reviews ranged from anywhere between lukewarm to generally positive. Many of the criticisms for Destroy All Monsters point out how sluggish some parts of the movie are, and how the alien invasion plot is ripped straight from a comic book. However, most of the positive comments towards the film hailed its extraordinary scope, it’s amazing monster destruction sequences and the absolutely amazing final battle with all of the monsters.\n\nDestroy All Monsters is absolutely massive in scope. Not only are their tons of monsters, but the plot takes us all over the world, and even out of our world. The movie takes place in 1999 (which is 30 years after the movie was released). The entire world have finally achieved world peace, and work harmoniously through the United Nations. The United nations has set up bases on the moon, and on “Monster Island.” All of the world’s monsters were corralled onto Monster Island, where they are kept safe and contained from the rest of the world. The United Nations use special force field technology that keeps the monsters from leaving the island. The base is lead by Dr. Otani.\n\nWhile the scientists on Monster Island are communicating with the UN base on the Moon, the Monster Island base is attacked and all communication is lost. Almost immediately after this, major cities around the world report attacks from each of the monsters. Mothra is sighted in Beijing, Godzilla in New York, Rodan in Moscow, Manda in London and Gorosaurus in Paris.\n\nIn desperation, Dr. Yoshida of the UNSC orders Captain Yamabe and the crew of his spaceship, Moonlight-SY3 to return to Earth. Their first task is to investigate the Monster Island base. They find that Dr. Otani and his team have all been put under some sort of mind control, and they are introduced to a strange alien woman. The woman explains that she is the leader of the race alien call the Kilaaks. She reveals that they are in direct control of the monsters in the same way that they are controlling the Monster island team of scientists. She goes on the explain that the Kilaaks are an advanced race with technology that far surpasses that of Earth. They demand that the human race surrender, or be annihilated by the monsters. After receiving the threat, Yamabe and his team kidnap Dr. Otani and escape back to Japan.\n\nWe learn that the Kilaaks had sent the monsters to other parts of the world so that they could build a control station at the base of Mt. Fuji. Our team begins by interrogating Dr. Otani, but to no avail. Under the Kilaak’s control Dr. Otani attempts suicide by jumping from a window. A group of mind-controlled scientists attempt to collect Dr. Otani’s body and remove the control device from him. However, they fail and our group of heroes learn that the Kilaaks are able to control others through a radio transmission. The Kilaaks are displeased with their discovery and order a monster attack on Tokyo. Godzilla, Manda, Rodan and Mohtra converge on the city and cause mass destruction. The attack on Tokyo was the worst of all the major cities, leaving little more than rubble.\n\nDetermined to bring an end to the Kilaaks, Yamabe and the gang develop a way to track the mind control signal. Traveling around the world, they discover transmitters that were stashed away in various areas such as streams and mountainsides. With all of the transmitters in their possession, the Japanese government devises a plan to storm Mt. Fuji. Before the base and be raided, the military comes face to face with Godzilla, who is protecting the area. We learn that the Kilaaks developed a fail-safe control base on the moon, and that the monsters are still under their control.\n\nYamabe leads his team aboard the Moonlight-SY3 to attack the Kilaak base on the moon. The team uses a mining laser to break through the Kilaak defenses. Once our team of heroes fight their way through, the temperatures inside the base begin to drastically decrease. The Kilaak’s begin to shrink and revert to a rock-like form. We discover that the Kilaak’s cannot live when exposed to cold temperatures, and return to a hibernation state similar to a mineral. Yamabe grabs one of the Kilaaks, then begins looking for the mind-control device. Once found, they use the laser to cut the device from its pedestal and they return to Earth.\n\nBack on Earth, the United Nation uses the mind control device on the monsters, and orders them to attack the Kilaak base at Mt. Fuji. The first to arrive is Minilla, shortly followed by Godzilla and Mothra. Soon we start seeing the rest. Manda, Bargon and Varan appear in the distance. Then Rodan, Gorosaurus, Kumonga and Anguirus make their entrance. Before Godzilla can lead the army of monsters on their attack, the Kilaaks pull out their fight, King Ghidorah.\n\nKing Ghidroah starts taking on the monsters, blasting them with his gravity beam. King Ghidorah gets knocked over, and while he’s down Anguirus latches onto his neck. King Ghidorah takes off to the skies with Anguirus hanging from his neck. King Ghidorah reaches around with one of his other heads and pries Anguirus off, throwing him to the ground. King Ghidorah then returns to the ground to fight more. The monsters surround him, and Gorosuarus lands a powerful kangaroo kick, knocking Ghidorah down again. The monsters begin to dog pile the three-headed monsters. Anguirus bites down on the right neck, while Godzilla grapples with the left head. Minilla blows a smoke ring around the middle head, and Mothra and Kumonga spray their webbing to trap the monster. King Ghidorah is defeated.\n\nRefusing to admit defeat, the Kilaaks reveal one more monster that they call the Fire Dragon. The Fire Dragon appears to be a giant ball of flying fire. First it burns Rodan out of the sky, then it latches itself onto the Moonlight-SY3, and they enter a short dog fight. Captain Yamabe manages to shake the Fire Dragon off, and it is revealed that it is actually just a burning Kilaak ship. The team shoots the ship out of the air. Durring the fight, parts of the Kilaak base are revealed on the side of Mt. Fuji. Godzilla leads a charge on the base and kicks in the roof. Exposed to the air, the Kilaaks revert back to their hibernation state. The monsters and mankind are victorious. Our movie ends with all of the monsters back on Monster Island, returning to their happy monster lives.\n\nYou’re probably thinking that Destroy All Monsters would be one of the best Godzilla movies out there. It has all of the monsters, with epic global catastrophe. The easiest comparison we can make is to something like Marvel’s Infinity War. However, I personally believe that Destroy All Monsters struggles with a handful of things that keep it from being truly great.\n\nOne of the bigger problems with Destroy All Monsters is that it fails to give equal and loving treatment to all of it’s monsters. Not all Godzilla movies are jam packed with bombastic action, but Destroy All Monsters was marketed as a all-out monster bash. Add in the fact that it was also marketed as the last Godzilla film, then you can understand why the final product is a little disappointing. In a roundabout way, Destroy All Monsters ended up being what many fans of the Marvel films feared Infinity War and Endgame would be. The fear was that the movie would be too ambitious for its own good, and the filmmakers would struggle to find a perfect balance. Many monsters in the film have their time limited to just minor cameos. The combined screen time of monsters like Varan and Baragon are each under one minute. This doesn’t kill the movie, of course. However, it does leave fans wanting more.\n\nI personally find that to be a minor complaint, but honestly it’s made worse by long stretches of boring human plot. The alien invasion plot in Destroy All Monsters is remarkably similar to the one in Invasion of Astro-Monster, but only half as interesting. We learn so little about the Kilaaks that it almost feels like the movie could have existed without them. It’s also a shame that the rest of the human characters are largely uninteresting. Most of the movie is just scenes of humans reacting to what the monsters are doing. This movie exudes very little fun without the monsters on screen.\n\nWith those two complaints out of the way, there are few good things to talk about. The first is that this is still one of the better Godzilla films in the first era. It is miles above movies like Son of Godzilla or Godzilla Raids again. In many ways, Destroy All Monsters is a strong return to the Godzilla formula that fans loved. The bigger scale allows for awesome monster destruction and fun battles. Destroy All Monsters feels more of a natural progression for the Godzilla franchise, and is a stronger natural sequel to Invasion of Astro-Monster.\n\nThis return to form is felt through many returning production members from the earlier years. Like I mentioned above, the most obvious of these is the return of Akira Ifukube as the composer. Destroy All Monsters has one of the strongest orchestral pieces of all the Godzilla films. The movies main theme will stick with many fans, and you will immediately recognize it as truly being Godzilla. The soundtrack does a wonderful job at making everything in the film feel bigger and more epic. This feeling was sorely missed in the last couple films.\n\nEven though the monster action was limited, that didn’t stop it from being amazing. The attack on Tokyo is one of the best Godzilla destruction scenes in any of the movies. I also genuinely loved seeing all of the awesome monsters from the other movies. Manda sticks out most to me, since he actually got quite a lot of screen time. Seeing the snake-like dragon wrap himself around structures was just awesome to see. In addition to that, it was awesome to see Gorosaurus be heavily involved in the final fight with King Ghidorah. Speaking of King Ghidorah; his appearance was appreciated but underwhelming. The problem of course was that he was severely outnumbered one:eight. However, the battle was still fiery and epic. King Ghidorah actually dies as a result! That’s dedication!\n\nFor the first time during all of my reviews, I would like to take a quote from another reviewer, Steve Biodrowski from Cinefantasique. Destroy All Monsters “”is too slim in its storyline, too thin in its characterizations, to be considered a truly great film […] But for the ten-year-old living inside us all, it is entertainment of the most awesome sort.” I think sentence here perfectly encapsulates me overall opinion on the film. When I watch Destroy All Monsters, the child in my jumps for joy and cheers when I see the monsters. However, the rest of the film is too bland to really keep me hooked. In today’s day an age, it’s hard sit through without checking my phone for something more interesting. I think that’s a real shame.\n\nDestroy All Monsters lands somewhere in the same area as Invasion of Astro-Monster and King Kong vs Godzilla for me. While I think those two movies are generally entertaining the whole way through, the awesome monster action of Destroy All Monsters does a lot of the heavy lifting. I’m going to give this film a solid 7/10!\n\nThat’s it for my Destroy All Monsters review. I had to slow down a bit over these past couple weeks to get over some sickness. This review will publish a week late than originally intended, but I’m still moving forward. There’s still a lot going on in the Godzilla franchise down the road, and I’m excited to get to it. Keep checking back for more content!\n\n-LoaphMeat"
