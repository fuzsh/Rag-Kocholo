        "text": "This film is considered the last entry in the Golden Age of Toho's kaiju films, and meant to be the last film of the Godzilla series. However, it was successful enough that it was decided to continue the series, albeit as part of a film campaign called the Toho Champion Festival, a seasonal matinee that specifically targeted children. This meant that subsequent films would have to reduced their budgets and staff since the Godzilla films were just too expensive to continue making in their original manner. For example, this film and the ones prior had two or more large groups of crew members that divided the work on the character drama and special effects sequences. Case in point: cinematographer Taiichi Kankura shot the live action character drama directed by Ishirô Honda, while different cinematographers, Yôichi Manoda and Motoyoshi Tomioka, shot the monster sequences directed by Sadamasa Arikawa. Subsequent films reduced this to a singular crew that had to manage all of those aspects at once.\n\nThe Japanese title of this film actually translates as \"Monster Total Advancement\". The title \"Destroy All Monsters\" was Toho's international title used for overseas sales. These titles were usually changed when the films were released in the U.S. and Europe; however, this one was kept."
