        "text": "Fans of Japanese monster flicks already know the name Ishirô Honda. For those of you not familiar with Honda’s work I have included his impressive fifty strong list of directorial efforts. To the best of my knowledge, Honda worked with Toho his entire film career. So many of my favourite Toho flicks are on this list; Godzilla, Matango, Mothra, Rodan, and Destroy All Monsters. In fact, Destroy all Monsters will be my first film review for this feature. Not coincidentally, all of my aforementioned favourites were collaborations with special effects guru Eiji Tsuburaya. Fellow Toho director Akira Kurosawa also collaborated with Honda, who was chief assistant director on Kurosawa’s Stray Dog and Ran. Apparently the two were close friends; Kurosawa delivered the Eulogy at Ishirô Honda’s funeral in 1993. Honda died at the age of 81. Ishirô Honda was responsible for some of Toho’s best and most successful creature features and is a director worth celebrating!\n\nThe Films of Ishirô Honda\n\n1990 Dreams (The Tunnel, Mount Fuji in Red, prologue & epilogue of The Weeping Demon – uncredited)\n\n1977 Godzilla\n\n1975 Terror of Mechagodzilla (Mekagojira no gyakushu)\n\n1973 Mirâman\n\n1970 Space Amoeba (Gezora, Ganime, Kameba: Kessen!
