Perry B. Duryea Jr., a Montauk lobsterman who became a commanding figure in New York politics during the 1960's and 1970's, ultimately losing the 1978 race for governor, died yesterday at Southampton Hospital. He was 82.

His son, Perry Duryea III, said Mr. Duryea died at about 4:30 p.m. from injuries he sustained in a car accident near his Montauk home last Tuesday.

Mr. Duryea, a Republican, was first elected to the State Assembly in 1960, and became the Assembly minority leader in 1966. He would remain a prominent figure in the Assembly until 1978, serving as speaker from 1969 through 1973, and again as minority leader from 1974 to 1978.

''As a speaker, he was a brilliant, compassionate leader whose contributions helped improve the quality of life for New Yorkers across the state,'' Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno told the Associated Press last night.

Mr. Bruno described Mr. Duryea as ''one of New York's greatest leaders.

He came from a family of lobstermen who controlled Perry Duryea and Sons, a Montauk seafood company. Throughout his years in elective office, he remained a familiar figure in Montauk, often returning home to tend to the family business.

It was a business that was acquired by his father Perry B. Duryea, in the early 1920's. Father and son shared an interest in politics, since the senior Mr. Duryea served as a state senator.
