        "text": "Railroaders Killed in the Line of Duty\n\n(This list is best viewed on a computer monitor)\n\nOur brothers & sisters continue to be killed on the job and what we see from the railroads are continuous testing harassment and ineffective \"blame the worker\" safety programs.\n\nWe must continue to build the rank-and-file solidarity that will empower us to take real action when it comes to on-the-job safety. Meanwhile, RWU will continue to honor every fallen brother or sister, regardless of craft or union.\n\nBy no means can we guarantee that our list below is complete, but we will try to make it as complete as possible and it will remain a work in progress for quite some time. If you know of anyone that we missed on this list, please email us with the information. At the bottom of this page you will find some links to various railroad injury & fatality references. Thanks.\n\nUnfortunately, according to OSHA statistics, there are an average of 13 on-the-job fatalities in the entire U.S. workforce each day. Over 4,800 workers were killed on-the-job in 2015.\n\nAlthough by law, we are entitled to a safe workplace and it is our employers’ responsibility to provide it, we are continuing to see less enforcement of the safety laws by the government agencies who are required to enforce those laws. The current administration and Congress continues to strip enforcement capabilities by reducing the powers and budgets of those vital agencies.\n\nAlso, we continue to see the reluctance of corporate owned, national media to focus any light on workers’ fatalities and injuries and the glaring lack of enforcement of safety regulations.\n\nAs a part of our efforts to promote safety for all railroaders, we also want to help promote safe work sites for all workers. In that effort we work to publicize ALL on-the-job fatalities.\n\n** If you are searching for information about deceased railroaders, please note that RWU has no more information than what is posted here. Some historical records of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen (BRT) can be found HERE. Or you can contact the National Association of Retired & Veteran Railroad Employees (NARVRE) HERE.\n\n2024\n\nApril 23, 2024 - Clearwater, British Columbia - Brother Juver Balmores, 36, was involved in a fatal head-on collision near Clearwater, B.C.
