        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nPerry B. Duryea, a Montauk lobsterman who became a commanding figure in New York politics during the 1960's and 1970's, ultimately losing the 1978 race for governor, died on Sunday at Southampton Hospital. He was 82.\n\nHis son, Perry Duryea III, said Mr. Duryea died about 4:30 p.m. from injuries he suffered in a car accident near his Montauk home last Tuesday.\n\nMr. Duryea, a Republican, was first elected to the State Assembly in 1960 and, with a family history in state politics, swiftly rose to the upper echelon of leadership and held on.\n\nHe became the Assembly minority leader in 1966. He would remain a prominent figure in the Assembly until 1978, using his command positions to influence the pace and contents of legislation, keeping the ranks in line and doling out assignments and appointments.\n\nHe was speaker from 1969 through 1973, and minority leader again from 1974 to 1978. (He reverted to minority leadership after the Watergate scandal deprived the Republicans of their majority in the Assembly.)\n\nRuddy, silver-haired and standing 6-foot-2, Perry Belmont Duryea Jr. -- he dropped the junior after his father's death -- was born in Montauk. His was a family of lobstermen who controlled Perry Duryea & Son, a Montauk company of seafood wholesalers. Throughout his years in elective office, he remained a familiar figure in Montauk, often returning home to tend to the family concern, the well-tailored model of a successful businessman.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
