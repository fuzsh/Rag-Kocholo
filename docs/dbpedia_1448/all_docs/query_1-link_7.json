THE PRESIDENT: The Secretary will read. THE SECRETARY: By Senator Bruno, Legislative Resolution Number 3089, mourning the death of former Speaker of the New York State Assembly Perry B. Duryea, Jr. 72 \"WHEREAS, There are certain outstanding individuals who, through their selfless commitment and dedication as both public servants and private citizens, have served to better the quality of life in their community and have had a measurable positive impact on not only the lives of its residents but on those of citizens throughout the State of New York; and \"WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and in full accord with its long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is duly moved this day to pay tribute to the distinguished life and career of former Speaker of the New York State Assembly Perry B. Duryea, Jr.; and \"WHEREAS, A public servant who exemplified all that is best in government, Perry B. Duryea, Jr., of Montauk, Long Island, died on Sunday, January 11, 2004, at the age of 82; and \"WHEREAS, First elected to the First District in 1960, Perry B. Duryea, Jr., served as a member of the New York State Assembly until 1978. He held the esteemed 73 position of Assembly Speaker from 1969 to 1973, and of Minority Leader from 1966 to 1968 and again from 1974 through 1978; and \"WHEREAS, As Speaker, Perry B. Duryea, Jr., was a brilliant, compassionate leader whose contributions helped improve the qualify of life for New Yorkers across this great Empire State; and \"WHEREAS, In 1978, as the standard bearer of his party, Perry B. Duryea, Jr., sought the office of Governor of the State of New York; and \"WHEREAS, An icon in Montauk, Suffolk County, and throughout Long Island, Perry B. Duryea, Jr., ran a seafood distribution business, Perry B. Duryea & Son. He also headed the Long Island State Park Commission for six years, helped champion the building of the Long Island Expressway, and was founder and chairman of the Long Island Commercial Bank. \"In recent years, while remaining active in the family seafood business, he served as spokesman for the Montauk Airport, and last month he was nominated to be the 74 Montauk Chamber of Commerce's Man of the Year; and \"WHEREAS, A lifelong resident of Montauk, Perry B. Duryea, Jr., graduated from Colgate University in 1942. He then served in the United States Naval Air Transport Service as a plane commander during World War II, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander; and \"WHEREAS, Perry B. Duryea, Jr., in the truest sense and spirit of service to his fellow citizens, unselfishly devoted his leadership, time, and energy to important community, civic, and governmental concerns and causes, leaving upon them his own indelible and lasting mark; now, therefore, be it \"RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations in a moment of silent tribute to Perry B. Duryea, Jr., a warm, caring, and responsive man whose unselfish concern for the welfare of others endowed and yet enhanced the lives of those so fortunate to call him family, colleague or friend; and to express its deepest condolences 75 to his wife, Trace; his son, Perry \"Chip\" Duryea III; his daughter, Lynn Duryea; and his two grandchildren; and be it further \"RESOLVED, That a copy of this resolution, suitably engrossed, be transmitted to the family of Perry B. Duryea, Jr.\" THE PRESIDENT: Would the members please stand and observe a moment of silence in respect and in memory of Perry B. Duryea, Jr. (Whereupon, the assemblage respected a moment of silence.) THE PRESIDENT: Please be seated. Senator Bruno. SENATOR BRUNO: Madam President, thank you. Colleagues, thank you. Perry Duryea was an individual that was so highly respected long before he entered the Assembly in 1960, because of his work, back in his community of Montauk, in the lobster business, and clams, that his father had started before him. And his father actually started him in politics. And Perry had such a great impact on what went on in his community and in the 76 Legislature. He actually became the leader six years after he was elected to the Assembly, Minority Leader. And that was like unheard-of. And then in '68 I believe I met him. At the time, I was president of the New York State Young Republicans and got to know Perry in that role. And I've got to tell you, he just couldn't have been more pleasant. You know, he was a statewide figure already. And I'll never forget how he was just as charming, respectful, encouraging. They went into the majority that year, and he became the Speaker in '69, as we all heard. Perry asked me to join his staff. And I didn't. But they asked me again in six months, five months later, I don't remember. But I joined his staff, became part of his senior staff. I was the special assistant for personnel. And I've got to tell you, you couldn't have a better mentor than watching him and working closely with him. He had a work ethic that was second to none. He would 77 be up at 4:00 in the morning, calling in back home, dealing with whatever had to be dealt with. And he was awfully hard to keep up with for the other members. And if you think about it, Perry was in the majority -- out of 150 seats, 76 seats. You try and do a budget -- and I remember well the discussions with Governor Rockefeller that he had. Earl Brydges was the Majority Leader at the time. Can you imagine getting a budget done when you're doing some things that weren't very popular, with 76 votes, when you had about 20 members that would rather not be there for that vote? But Perry, with his personality, his persuasion, his charm, got it done. He got things done. And if there was ever one individual that elevated the presence of the Legislature here in this state, it was Perry Belmont Duryea, Jr. So I just, you know, learned with such feelings of his passing. Because I stayed in touch with Perry. He called me, I talked with him about a lot of what was going 78 on legislatively in our lives. I just have the greatest admiration and respect. So this sort of concludes a chapter in our lives here, and in my life. But his legacy just goes on and on and on. They recognized him as the Man of the Year. Most recently, a building was named after him, as well it should. And other things too. If there's ever one individual -- and Senator LaValle can speak to that -- that recognized how important it was to maintain the parks and an expansiveness in New York State for everyone for generations to enjoy, it was Perry Duryea. And he provided the leadership, and the result and the expansion of the park system and a lot of just the natural resources we have in this state relate to Perry. He was really a man's man. He was a commander, as you heard, in the Second World War. Flew his own plane -- had his own plane, flew it. And I've got to tell you, you wanted a thrill, you'd get in that plane with Perry and fly somewhere. Because weather didn't mean much to him. He just -- when he had to 79 be somewhere, he just went. And, you know, I just can't say enough things -- but there's others that want to talk -- about Perry, his effect on my life. And think about the kind of guy -- he had to get back for session one time, and he was flying his own plane and he was out somewhere. And I remember they got \"weather down.\" And frost and snow was all over the windshield. Perry somehow reached out with his hand and cleared the windshield. (Laughter.) SENATOR BRUNO: And they had sprayed it with something, and his hand froze. And skin peeled off. He walked around with a bandage on his hand for I don't know how long as a result, think about that, of, getting back, reaching out to scrape the ice. How many people in here would do that? I think, for me, I'd be heading down to the nearest haven and, you know, just staying there with the heater on until it warmed up, and then get back to your duty. Perry wasn't that kind of a guy. 80 He had a job to do, he just zeroed in to get that job done, and he got it done. So I am just indebted, and I extend my condolences to his wife, Trace, who is a beautiful, lovely lady, and his son, Chip, who is Perry Belmont Duryea, III. He's the third. And I watched Chip grow up, literally. And his other daughter Lynn, who resides in Texas now, who's a beautiful young lady. So I've just got the greatest memories. But I am really indebted to Perry Duryea, his family and the memories that we have, and his mentoring. Because, for better or for worse, he brought me into politics and government. And I wouldn't be here, probably, if it wasn't for Perry. So I say for better or for worse. Perry would think it was for the better. At least that's what he told me the last time we talked. (Laughter.) SENATOR BRUNO: So thank you, Madam President. And thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Senator LaValle. SENATOR LaVALLE: Madam 81 President, I think Senator Bruno, in his remarks and the resolution, really framed out the kind of person and some of the accomplishments of Perry Duryea. I just wanted to add, having had the opportunity of serving with Perry as the senator of the district, but also seeing, and I think the other colleagues from Suffolk would concur, that Perry Duryea, in our political lifetime, was probably the most charismatic person, political person from our county. There are not many people that we meet in our political lifetimes that are bigger than life. And Perry was that. He did so much so easily. And I can recall being in a room where there were a lot of people and, when Perry walked in, he truly was charismatic. It was like light just shone on him. He just lit up a room. And those of us from Suffolk really benefited because of his leadership, his speakership, many of the things that -- the State University and the Expressway would not have happened if Perry was not in the position 82 that he was. He understood leadership, he understood responsibility. And not only the people in the state but certainly we in Suffolk County benefited from his leadership. THE PRESIDENT: Senator Johnson. SENATOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Madam President. I think Senator Bruno and Senator LaValle made good points about Perry. I didn't serve in the Assembly. I wasn't here in those years when Senator Bruno was getting acquainted with Perry. But I was in Suffolk County helping other people get elected to office. In their campaigns and whenever we had a rally or a fund-raiser, Perry was there. And Perry was the pièce de résistance. Everybody came there to see Perry, he was such an outstanding person. As Ken said, he lit up the room. Perry was Perry, and we were all just people. So he was a real draw. He was a real good Republican, a good person helping elect other people to office. And really, as 83 Senator Bruno said he had an impact on his life, he had an impact on many of our lives, because we all looked forward to him, looked up to him and thought, someday I would like to be in a position where he is and be as effective and as beneficial to the citizenry as Perry was. He certainly was. And he was a good personal friend of mine, a good personal friend of my county chairman that talked me into running for office. And they were good buddies until last month when they dedicated the state office building in Perry B. Duryea's name in Suffolk County. And I'm going to miss him. I'm sure Buzz Schwenk's going to miss him, Kenny. All of us who have really grown up with Perry being there are going to miss that man, a wonderful person. And my condolences to his family and friends. Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Senator Farley. SENATOR FARLEY: Thank you, Madam President. I just want to rise to say that, 84 you know, we all pass through this area. And I'd bet you that perhaps half of this chamber never knew Perry Duryea. How quickly you're somewhat forgotten. But I'll tell you, he was some kind of a presence. Just to see him was an experience. He was really an outstanding guy. I was fortunate enough just to serve and just started here when he was a leader over in the Assembly. And he was always very thoughtful to everybody and very kind and humble to everybody, no matter who you were. And even though he was an imposing presence, he was a rather shy person. I was at several functions with him; he never pushed himself to the front of anything, but he was always there, because he did have such a commanding presence. He was a giant that served New York well. Ran for governor and he was, I think, way ahead when he started out. And unfortunately lost. But he was, I think, respected by everybody that knew him from all sides of the aisle. 85 I saw him in recent years, and he was still a very imposing-looking person. And I'm sure that he and his family have to be proud of the legacy that he left for New York State. And he'll be missed by a lot of people. THE PRESIDENT: Senator Bruno. SENATOR BRUNO: Madam President, could we at this time open this resolution to the entire house. And hopefully our colleagues that would like to join will join. And those that would rather not, if you would let the desk know, we'll respect that. Thank you very much. THE PRESIDENT: If there is a member who does not wish to have his or her name included on this resolution, please notify the desk. Senator Trunzo. SENATOR TRUNZO: Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to say a few words. I've known Perry Duryea for number of years, well over 40 years. And he was a great individual and an inspiration for me, 86 not only politically but professionally, working with him over these past years, even after he retired from the State Assembly. And he was also been a very close friend and political advisor to me for many, many years. And all I can say about him at this time, it was really a pleasure being with him last October when Governor Pataki was there and we renamed the state office building in Hauppauge as the Perry Duryea State Office Building. And my offices are in that building, and really it comes as memory to me every time I walk into my office. And it really is a sad day for Suffolk County, and even for the State of New York, for the loss of Perry Duryea. He was a great individual. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Senator. Senator Stavisky. SENATOR STAVISKY: Madam President, I too remember Perry Duryea when he served in the Assembly as Speaker and then as Minority Leader, because my husband was in the Assembly at the time. And I do want to 87 mention the fact that he was extremely kind to people on my husband's side of the aisle. I think he particularly liked Leonard, because Leonard spent a summer teaching summer school at Colgate, and he was very proud of his allegiance to Colgate, his alma mater. But he was every bit the leader that my friends on the other side of the aisle have described. He was the Speaker, he was a Republican, but he was fair to the Democrats. And I think that's really all that anybody could ask for. I remember Leonard saying to me one day -- and this goes back many, many years, but certain things you never forget. Leonard said to me he -- Leonard asked him when the Legislature would adjourn, because Leonard had accepted a commitment to teach summer school in California. And Perry said to Leonard: \"Don't tell anybody, but you'll be out in time to be able to drive to California.\" Leonard never said anything, but he always appreciated Perry's honesty and his integrity and his commitment to the people of 88 our state. So I too would like to join my colleagues and commemorate the life and legacy of Perry Duryea. THE PRESIDENT: Senator Flanagan. SENATOR FLANAGAN: Thank you, Madam President. I have a different sort of memory of Perry Duryea, and it started really as a kid. My father and he served in the Assembly together. And I distinctly remember that he was the type of person -- and it didn't really matter whether you were the governor or you were a schoolkid -- he had a unique ability to make you feel special. When he was talking to you, there was nobody else around. It was him and you, and it was a direct conversation. I distinctly remember that as a child. I have some great pictures of my father and I and Speaker Duryea, and those are things that I cherish. And I'm not sure if somebody said this, but if they didn't, it's very important to remember too: he was a gentleman, in the 89 best sense of the word. And certainly today when there is perhaps a lack, or that's just somewhat of a dying breed, he represented all the positive traits of what people would call a true gentleman. I had an opportunity to see him just less than a month ago. He used to get together with a group of political leaders in what's commonly referred to as the \"Back to the Wall Club\" in Suffolk County. And they were honoring Buzz Schwenk, our former county leader, for his 80th birthday. But he made a point of talking to me, asking me how things were going, and still had that ability to make somebody feel special. He obviously has a tremendous legacy for Long Island. But I'll just close on a point that Senator LaValle made. Another thing that I remember was when Perry Duryea walked in a room, he owned that room, I don't care where it was. He just had a presence that was completely unique. Very few people have that quality. He had it, but he was able to back it up with talent. 90 Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: All in favor of this resolution please signify by saying aye. (Response of \"Aye.\") THE PRESIDENT: Opposed, nay. (No response.) THE PRESIDENT: The resolution is adopted. Senator Bruno. SENATOR BRUNO: Thank you, Madam President. There will be an immediate meeting of the Corporations Committee in the Majority Conference Room.

THE PRESIDENT: The Secretary will read. THE SECRETARY: By Senator 91 Paterson, Legislative Resolution Number 3090, commemorating the 75th birthday of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and honoring The Martin Luther King, Jr., Center New York Support Group.

THE PRESIDENT: The amendments are received, and the bill will retain its place on the Third Reading Calendar. Senator Paterson. SENATOR PATERSON: Madam President, if you will indulge me, I am in error. The resolution that commemorates the 75th birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, I did not open it up for all of my colleagues. And I was reminded of that by Senator Colonel Larkin, who I never knew was on the march from Selma to Montgomery, was actually sent by the Army to try to get some indulgence from Governor Wallace. And while I cannot repeat what Governor Wallace said to him, I'm sure you can imagine what that feeling was. And Senator Larkin will be speaking on the same day of this anniversary. And it is quite rewarding to know that a member of our chamber was so much a part of the rich culture and history that was the civil rights 96 movement, and that right here within our own chamber there were warriors in that struggle, not the least of which is Senator Larkin, and many others who would like to go on this resolution. So we'd like to open the resolution up for all of my colleagues at this time. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Senator Paterson. All members who do not wish their name on the resolution concerning Martin Luther King please so notify the desk. Senator Hoffmann. SENATOR HOFFMANN: Madam President, for the information of the members, there will be an EnCon meeting in 332 immediately following the conclusion of the Corporations Committee meeting, and a Civil Service Committee meeting to follow that, also in 332. THE PRESIDENT: There will be an EnCon and then a Civil Service Committee meeting in the Majority Conference Room. SENATOR HOFFMANN: And the Senate will stand at ease pending the conclusion of 97 those committee meetings. THE PRESIDENT: There will be an EnCon Committee meeting and then a Civil Service Committee meeting, and the Senate stands at ease. (Whereupon, the Senate stood at ease at 11:43 a.m.) (Whereupon, the Senate reconvened at 11:49 a.m.) ACTING PRESIDENT BONACIC: The Senate will come to order, please. Senator Larkin. SENATOR LARKIN: Mr. President, the EnCon Committee will meet in Room -- ACTING PRESIDENT BONACIC: Excuse me, Senator. Could we please have a little quiet so Senator Larkin can speak. Senator.
