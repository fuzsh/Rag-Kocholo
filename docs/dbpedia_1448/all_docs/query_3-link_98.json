        "text": "FOOTBALL\n\nPENNS FIRST-EVER WIN: Penn 4, All-Philadelphia 0 (November 17, 1876)\n\nWin No. 1 came against the All-Philadelphia team as the Quakers scored four goals to their opponents zero. (Penns other two games of its inaugural season were losses to Princeton, but we dont have to talk about those.)\n\nPENNS FIRST WIN OVER ANOTHER COLLEGE TEAM: Penn 9, Swarthmore 0 (November 11, 1878)\n\nPenns first win against another college team was an all-out dismantling as it scored nine goals and 16 touchdowns to Swarthmores zero in both categories. (16 touchdowns was a lot back then, right?)\n\nPENN FINALLY BEATS PRINCETON: Penn 6, Princeton 4 (November 5, 1892)\n\nAfter 27 straight losses to Princeton, Penn finally beat its neighbors to the north, 6-4. Penn went 15-1 that season  George Woodruffs first as head coach  as it began to assert itself as a national powerhouse.\n\nNATIONAL CHAMPIONS: Penn 18, Harvard 4 (November 29, 1894)\n\nPenn defeated Harvard, 18-4, and earned its first national championship after recording the first undefeated campaign in the programs short 18-year history. The Red and Blue posted a 12-0 record under Head Coach George Woodruff. Other wins included Virginia, Navy and Princeton (only the second in 30 meetings). The Quakers averaged 30.5 ppg while allowing just 1.6 ppg. Penn shut out nine of its 12 opponents.\n\nFIRST FOOTBALL GAME AT FRANKLIN FIELD: Penn 40, Swarthmore 0 (October 1, 1895)\n\nStands are built at the stadiums current location at 33rd and Spruce Streets. The stadium is opened for the Penn Relays, and the Quakers shut out Swarthmore, 40-0, on their way to another national title, in the first football game played at Franklin Field.\n\nBACK-TO-BACK NATIONAL CHAMPIONS: Penn 46, Cornell 2 (November 28, 1895)\n\nPenn defeated Cornell, 46-2, capping back-to-back undefeated seasons, as well as a second-consecutive national title. Penn did itself two better in 1895 going 14-0 under Head Coach George Woodruff. Ten shutouts, including Virginia, and wins over Penn State and Harvard were the highlights as the Quakers averaged 34.3 ppg while surrendering just 1.7 ppg.\n\nSAVING EMBARRASSMENT: Penn 12, Cornell 11 (November 27, 1902)\n\nCornell came to Philadelphia for what would become a tradition for much of the century -- a Thanksgiving showdown with the Quakers on Franklin Field. The visitors dominated Penn during the first half. The Big Reds offense generated 240 yards to Penns 85 and outscored the Quakers 11-0 in the first two quarters. During the intermission, Cornell, one of the strongest teams in the nation, sent a message to Penn offering to shorten the game to save the Quakers from further humiliation, as the Big Red had also defeated Penn 23-0 the previous year. But Penn refused to end the final game of its season on such a sour note, emerging in the second half as an almost entirely different team. The Quakers moved the ball 235 yards and held Cornell to just 40. Carl Williams Red and Blue scored 12 points to win the game -- Penn would not allow another point until the eighth game of the next season -- and the embarrassment belonged solely to Cornell.\n\nSITE OF THE ORIGINAL HORSESHOE: Penn 27, Dickinson 0 (September 26, 1903)\n\nIn response to inadequate seating for big games, wooden stands in the stadium were replaced by a brick horseshoe, seating 20,000 fans and making Franklin Field the first permanent horseshoe college stadium, and Penn defeated Dickinson, 27-0, in its season opener.\n\nPenn 34, Cornell 0 (November 24, 1904)\n\nOne of the most dominant years in Penn history concluded with a 34-0 whitewashing of Cornell. The Quakers allowed only four points the entire season.\n\nTHE CARLISLE INDIANS: Carlisle 26, Penn 6 (October 26, 1907)\n\nThe Carlisle Indians of 1907 would be the most dynamic team in college football, as they pioneered that elegant, new invention called the passing game. The Indians were about to take off. Carlisle roared off to a 6-0 start. They came to Philadelphia to face unbeaten Penn, ranked fourth in the nation, at Franklin Field before a crowd of 22,800. No team all season had crossed Penns goal line. On just the second play of the game, Carlisle fullback Pete Hauser whipped a 40-yard forward pass over the middle that fleet end William Gardner caught on a dead run. There are three or four signal moments in the evolution of football, and this was one of them. Imagine the excitement of the crowd that day -- and the confusion of the defenders -- if all they had ever seen was a densely packed, scrumlike game. Suddenly, the center snapped the ball three yards deep to a man who was a powerful runner, a deadeye passer and a great kicker. The play must have felt like an electric charge. It was the sporting equivalent of the Wright brothers taking off at Kitty Hawk. And it utterly baffled the Quakers. From that moment on, the Indians threw all over the field. To the panicked Quakers, the Carlisle receivers came at them like a stampede. At the start of a play, every man shot downfield. Some decoyed the defensive backs and others hit the safeties. Penns All-American fullback, William Big Bill Hollenback, described what it was like: Id see the ball sailing in my direction. And at the same time came the thundering of what appeared to be a tribe of Indians racing full tilt in my direction. When this gang hit you, they just simply wiped you out, and you lost all other interest in the football contest. There was one other significant event that day: Jim Thorpes debut. In the first half, Carlisles veteran starting halfback, Albert Payne, wrenched his knee. Thorpe finally had his chance, and he raced onto the field. He was so excited that the first time Carlisle called his number, he ran in the opposite direction from his blockers and was buried under a pile of tacklers. But on the next play, he ran 45 yards. The Indians completed 8 of 16 passes -- even Thorpe threw one -- and outgained Penn by 402 yards to 76. The Quakers were so confused by the Indians fakes and feints that they finally reached a point where the players ran in circles emitting wild yawps, Carlisle head coach Pop Warner remembered. Carlisle won, 26-6. The ease of Carlisles victory over Penn startled and discomfited football traditionalists. The New York Times reported that the Indians explosive use of the pass put all the coaches at the large universities at sea. Clearly, the Indians were miles ahead of any other team. Unsurprisingly, the competition did not congratulate them for it, but resented them. In the past, the Indians had been a novelty act, a plucky little team that played over their heads. But now they were a powerful and undefeated machine, and they had made an opponent look slow and stupid.\n\nPenn 29, Michigan 0 (November 14, 1908)\n\nHead coach Sol Metzgers only season in charge produced an unblemished record, a national championship and this 29-0 win at Michigan, the winningest team of all-time.\n\nTHE MOST SPECTACULAR GAME EVER PLAYED: Penn 27, Michigan 21 (November 9, 1912)\n\nAfter losing four straight games, Penn appeared destined for its fifth straight defeat as powerful Michigan had stormed to a 21-0 lead at Franklin Field by halftime. During the intermission, trainer Mike Murphy, withered to less than 100 pounds and dying of tuberculosis, asked coach Andy Smith for a uniform, saying, I just want to wear the Red and Blue to show these boys how to fight. No team in history had ever come back from a deficit so great. But with a minute to play in the fourth quarter, the Red and Blue had slashed the Wolverines lead to just one point, and Michigan was lined up in punt formation. Richard Marshall received the punt on the Penn 48 and escaped three tackles on his way to what The Daily Pennsylvanian called the most spectacular touchdown ever made on the American gridiron. The jubilant crowd rushed the field and it took the police and players five minutes to restore order so that the final minute of the game could be played. When it was completed, Penn emerged victorious from what is generally conceded to be the greatest football contest of all time, according to that Mondays DP.\n\nPenn 23, Cornell 3 (November 30, 1916)\n\nA 23-3 win over Cornell in the regular-season finale set up Penns only bowl appearance. Sadly, their trip to the Rose Bowl did not add to the programs win total; the Quakers and quarterback Bert Bell lost to Oregon, 14-0.\n\nROSE BOWL: Oregon 14, Penn 0 (January 1, 1917)\n\nThis was Penns lone appearance in a bowl game.\n\nPenn 89, Delaware 0 (September 24, 1921)\n\nThe first game of famed coach John Heismans second year produced an 89-0 win over Delaware, which matched Penns largest margin of victory of the century. The Quakers other most lopsided win? An 89-0 triumph over  you guessed it  Delaware two year earlier.\n\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALLS FIRST RADIO BROADCAST: Cornell 9, Penn 0 (November 30, 1922)\n\nFranklin Field is the site of college footballs first radio broadcast as Cornell defeated Penn, 9-0, in a game aired locally on WIP-AM radio.\n\nPenn 54, Drexel 0 (October 1, 1924)\n\nThe only time Penn ever played neighbor Drexel in football led to an easy 54-0 win for the Quakers, who went on to claim their final national championship that year.\n\nFIRST DOUBLE-DECKED STADIUM: Penn 32, Ursinus 0 (September 26, 1925)\n\nThe second deck is completed, making Franklin Field the nations first double-decker football stadium, and Penn defeated Ursinus, 32-0, in its season opener. The capacity is 78,205, the largest in the country.\n\nFIVE INSIDE THE 10: Penn 7, Princeton 0 (October 17, 1936) **\n\nIn his book, Fight On, Pennsylvania!, Dan Rottenberg called this game the Stalingrad of Penn football. Lew Elverson returned a punt 57 yards for the only touchdown of the game in the first quarter to give the Quakers the lead. Then, Penn played defense. Five times, Princeton came across the Penn 10-yard line, and five times, the Quakers turned the enemy away unsatisfied. The previously unbeaten Tigers got as close as the 2-yard line but never entered the end zone as the Quakers bounced back from their only defeat of the season, a week earlier at Yale. After the very stressful victory, Penn coach Harvey Harman could only say, We won on guts. Penns defense in 1936 was so good that it allowed more than seven points on just one occasion -- a 19-12 win over Penn State on November 14. Click to watch Penn stop Princeton inside the ten in the second quarter.\n\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALLS FIRST TELEVISED GAME: Penn 51, Maryland 0 (October 5, 1940)\n\nFranklin Field is the site of the first-ever telecast of a college football game as Penn routs Maryland, 51-0. Local station Philco/WPTZ-3 (now KYW) used two cameras to broadcast all of the action.\n\nWALT MOTSONS 93-YARD INTERCEPTION RETURN: Penn 55, Maryland 6 (October 25, 1941)\n\nPenns Walt Motson returned an interception for a school-record 93 yards, as the Quakers routed Maryland, 55-6, at Franklin Field. Click to watch Walt Motsons school-record 93-yard interception return.\n\nPenn 21, Navy 0 (October 25, 1947)\n\nHead coach George Mungers only undefeated season included this 21-0 shutout of Navy at Franklin Field. Hall of Famer Chuck Bednarik was the teams star two-way player on that squad.\n\nPenn 42, Dartmouth 26 (October 14, 1950) **\n\nReds Bagnell had his share of incredible days at Franklin Field, but none eclipsed this one in front of a packed stadium and a live television audience (ABC Sports broadcasted all of Penns home games that season). In a 42-26 whipping of Dartmouth, Bagnell set two national records with 490 total yards and 14 consecutive pass completions. Bagnell finished with 276 passing yards and 214 rushing yards. No matter how you arrange them, those number are just plain huge. But Bagnell didnt start out flaming. He had only two rushes and four completions in the first quarter for a total of 62 yards. The six-foot, 178-pound back began to heat up, though, in the second quarter. Bagnell scored two touchdowns in that second period and started his record-breaking streak of 14 straight completions with some under-the-coverage passes out of the tailback spot. Tom Hanlon, a junior end for the Quakers, caught six of those short Bagnell passes for 75 yards in the first half alone. Hanlon did end up hurting himself -- he suffered a season-ending broken ankle late in the second quarter -- but that wasnt the fault of Bagnell. And the loss of his star receiver didnt slow down the All-American tailback. Bagnell completed all seven of his passes in the third quarter for 60 yards. Still, that was just a precursor to the Germantown Academy graduates stellar fourth quarter. Bagnell completed his first three passes of the final period -- including his only passing touchdown of the game, a 60-yard strike to John Moses. Bagnells next and final pass of the game fell incomplete, but he still had some running to do. The pass to Moses was effective, but the real highlights of that quarter were Bagnells rushes. He only had two of them, but those pair of attempts resulted in 108 yards -- 27 more than Dartmouth totaled on the ground the entire day. And the second of those rushes was a 64-yard touchdown scamper with 19 seconds remaining, giving Bagnell the record.

The once-yearly series between the two state rivals fizzled out following the 1958 season, but the Quakers can take pride that they won the overall series, 25-19-4.\n\nA VALIANT LOSS: Notre Dame 28, Penn 20 (November 7, 1953) **\n\nIn 1953, Penn stood at a crossroads. The Quakers were severely restricted by the rules of the newly formed Ivy League. But with football schedules being made several years in advance, the Ivy restrictions took effect three years before the leagues round-robin schedule would begin, and the Red and Blue faced a schedule laden with some of the nations top teams. This suicide schedule included Vanderbilt, Penn State, Ohio State, Navy and Michigan. The toughest opponent, though, was national No.1 Notre Dame. When the Irish opened up a 21-7 halftime lead, George Mungers troops appeared doomed. But Penn stormed back, outscoring the Irish 13-7 in the third to cut the deficit to eight. Penn, led by QB Ed Gramigna, stormed down the field early in the fourth quarter, desperately trying to get back into the game. When they got down to the goal line, however, Notre Dames Johnny Lattner, then one of the best players in the country, intercepted a Gramigna pass and the Quakers were denied. The Irish might not have escaped victorious without Lattner. In addition to his key interception, the All-American rushed 12 times for 60 yards and returned one kickoff 56 yards to the Penn 26 and another 92 yards for a first-quarter touchdown.

After the coin toss, it was determined that Notre Dame would kick off to the Quakers. Fighting Irish kicker Paul Hornung prepared to start the game. For the Red and Blue, sophomore Frank Riepl -- who was appearing in his first game ever for the Quakers -- stood ready to return the kick. The whistle blew, the ball was kicked and it flew eight yards deep into the Penn end zone. Riepl stunned everyone as he caught the ball and began moving up the field. With the biggest crowd of the season (45,226) in Franklin Field stunned, Riepl ran straight at the oncoming Fighting Irish. The Quaker ran straight up the middle to the Penn 35-yard line, with the help of a number of phenomenal blocks. The sophomore then cut to the right sideline. That cut opened up the field, and no player was able to catch the young halfback as he tore down the remaining 65-yards of Franklin Field straight to the end zone. Riepl had returned the opening kickoff from deep in Penns own end zone 108 yards to give the Quakers a very quick 7-0 lead. The Fighting Irish stood stunned as the Quakers rejoiced in the end zone. Penns surprise start shook up the Fighting Irish so much that they fumbled four times and threw two interceptions before regrouping. Nevertheless, the Quaker lead was short-lived, as Notre Dame replied with a touchdown to tie the game at 7-7. The Red and Blue werent giving up without a fight, however. The Quakers took advantage of the shaken up Notre Dame team, recovering a fumble in the second quarter that led to a scoring drive and a 14-7 lead. After Bob Barber recovered the fumble on the Notre Dame 13-yard line, Riepl threw a pass to Barber in the end zone on the first play. Riepl, an all-around player, kicked the extra point, as he had previously in the game, to bring the Quaker total to 14. Going into the second half of the game, Penn held the Fighting Irish to a 14-14 stalemate. But Notre Dame came back in the end with authority, winning the game, 46-14.

The New York Post called the Red and Blue the best non-winning team in the country. The Quakers had lost 29 out of 33 games under coach Steve Sebo and earlier in the week, a DP editorial had called for his ouster. Enter Yale, which had lost just one game and could not believe that it would lose to lowly Penn, and Francis Riepl, the Quakers star defensive back without whom the Quakers had lost every game. At the beginning of the game, the Elis seemed to have things in hand, bolting to a 13-0 lead. But when the Elis next put points on the scoreboard, Penn had tallied 33.

Two days after being featured on the magazines cover, the Crimson carried the nations longest unbeaten streak to Philadelphia along with Ivy title hopes. Penn won the coin toss before the second half opened -- as was then the practice -- and elected to kickoff to the Crimson, hoping to force Harvard into a mistake. That mistake came when Wally Grant fumbled the kick. The blunder set up the only touchdown of the game for either team. Harvards only points of the game came when Penn tried to run out the clock. Quakers tailback Bruce Molloy ran back and forth in his own end zone until he was tackled by the Crimson for a safety. Molloy, who doubled as a punter, helped the Red and Blue immensely by pinning Harvard inside its own 10 on multiple occasions. The win was last-place Penns only Ivy triumph that season.

Lehigh broke a 7-7 tie and rolled to a comfortable 28-7 halftime lead. Penn quarterback Bill Creeden, sidelined due to an injury, came off the bench late in the second quarter and Penn began to move. In the third period two touchdowns, one when John Martinowich blocked a Lehigh field goal attempt and returned it a school-record 77 yards, made it 28-19 and then a three-touchdown onslaught in the final period gave Penn the win, 38-28, at Franklin Field .

After another Big Red touchdown made it 31-21, Cornell scored on a 59-yard pass to Ron Gervase from Bill Abel but George Burrell got it right back for Penn with a 95-yard run with the ensuing kickoff to end the third-period scoring, 38-28.

Princeton scored the first time they had the ball, on a 16-yard run by Bob Weber, and then a safety on a blocked punt made it 9-0 at halftime. Touchdown drives of 70, 60 and 40 yards put the score at 30-0 in the fourth quarter.

However, Leo then recovered his own fumble for a touchdown and a 14-7 halftime lead. Two quick touchdowns in the third quarter were all that was needed.

The Indians moved to a 21-0 lead in the first half before Penn began to move on the offense of Bill Creeden. Two Creeden passes and a rollout for 10 yards set up the first score by Gerry Santini, a 1-yard run, for a 21-7 halftime total. In the third quarter, Creedens 15-yard run set up another Santini 1-yard score and it was 21-14. However, Dartmouth bulldozed right back for two scores for their safe margin.

Cabot Knowlton tallied two first-period scores (20 and 10 yards) to give Penn a 14-0 lead at halftime. Midway through the third quarter, Tom Winner ran a punt back 58 yards for a Brown score but Gerry Santini came back for a 1-yard score and a 21-7 Penn lead going into the final period.

After a scoreless first quarter, Penn took a lead 6-0 on a Cabot Knowlton 14-yard run only to have the Bisons go up, 7-6, on a 7-yard run by quarterback Sam Havrilak. This was followed by a Knowlton 1-yard touchdown run and then a Bill Creeden to Pete Wisniewski pass for 60 yards and a score. Penn took what appeared to be a solid 21-7 lead into halftime. Havrilak then added a 2-yard score for his second touchdown run of the day in the third quarter but midway through the final quarter Knowlton made it 27-13 Penn with a 4-yard run. With less than five minutes to go, Bruce Smith scored from two yards out for Bucknell and a two-point conversion made it 27-21.

Bob Graustein was 22 of 37 for 243 yards and one touchdown pass, while rushing for Penns other three touchdowns.\n\nDartmouth 20, Penn 0 (September 18, 1976)\n\nTIM MAZZETTIS IVY-RECORD 54-YARD FIELD GOAL: Lehigh 24, Penn 20 (September 24, 1976) **\n\nPenn kicker Tim Mazzetti tied the Ivy League record for the longest field goal in league history after booting a 54-yard kick against Lehigh. The kick tied the score, 17-17, early in the fourth quarter. Mazzetti added a 27-yard field goal later in the quarter to put Penn ahead, 20-17.

The two schools, who traditionally met on Thanksgiving, played the first Ivy League night game in history. The Red and Blue running game was so good that the Quakers quarterback corps only put the ball in the air five times on the night, completing two for just 16 yards. Penn scored first and never looked back, allowing the Big Red into the end zone just once during the second quarter.

Kreider had three receptions, one of them for a 73-yard scoring play, and returned a punt 58 yards for another touchdown. Riekers other touchdown toss was of five yards to tight end Don Van Orden.\n\nColumbia 30, Penn 18 (October 1, 1977)\n\nPenn 14, Brown 7 (October 8, 1977)\n\nPenn 42, Lafayette 7 (October 14, 1977)\n\nQuarterback Tom Roland hit split end Nelson Johnson with a 26-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter, and Bob Nix returned an interception 22 yards for a score 15 seconds later, leading Penn to a 42-7 rout of Lafayette, at Franklin Field. The Quakers, who led 7-0 after the first quarter on a 1-yard run by John Montesanti, scored 21 points in the second period to break open the game, played in a steady rain and stiff wind. Roland opened the second quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run. The Leopards later fumbled away a punt, and Roland hit Johnson on the next play, from the Lafayette 26. Nix then intercepted a pass by Rob Stewart on Lafayettes next play from scrimmage and returned it 22 yards to give the Quakers a 28-0 halftime lead.

In the third quarter at Franklin Field, it seemed as though the Red and Blue would walk off the field with yet another defeat, as the Big Red held a 22-7 lead. Penns comeback was, quite simply, an air show. After years under Harry Gambles wishbone offense, the Quakers took to the sky. Gary Vura threw touchdown passes to Karl Hall for 84 and 93 yards which, respectively, represent the fifth longest and the longest touchdown pass plays in Penn history. Cornell had one last chance after a pass interference call late in the game against the Quakers brought the Big Red to the Penn 1-yard line with three seconds to play. Chris Metz, the Cornell quarterback, ran a bootleg play but was met -- and stopped -- six inches from glory by defensive back John Waterfield, who had committed the interference to bring Cornell down the field.

Witkowski completed 12 of 23 passes, one for a 24-yard touchdown to Bill Reggio early in the second half. Reggios touchdown was the Lions second within 15 seconds; both came after lost fumbles by Penn, the first at Penns 21, the second at the 24. Penn contributed to the decision with five turnovers - four lost fumbles and one intercepted pass. At the half, the Lions led by 6-3, following two field goals by Miro Lovric of 31 and 37 yards. Penn had scored first on a 21-yard field goal by Dave Shulman, but after that the Lions were in command. The two quick touchdowns in the third period put them ahead, 20-3. Penns final score came on a 26-yard pass from Gary Vura to Rick Syrek. Columbia also showed some defensive resolve by halting the Red and Blue on its 4-yard line early in the last quarter. Penn had driven 91 yards on that thrust.\n\nBrown 26, Penn 24 (October 10, 1981)\n\nBob Granfors kicked four field goals, and Rod Jones ran for the game-winner for Brown (1-3). The Ivy League victory for Brown came despite a three-touchdown fourth-quarter rally by the Quakers. Granfors field goals of 32 and 31 yards in the first quarter opened the scoring, and the Bruins never trailed, though Dave Shulman got Penn (1-3) on the board with a 23-yard field goal later in the first period. Granfors kicked two field goals in the second quarter, both from 27 yards, and Hank Landers followed with a 25-yard scoring strike to Steve Jordan, who caught six passes for 188 yards. Rod Jones, at the end of the third quarter, ran 34 yards for the Bruins last score. Gary Vuras 74-yard touchdown pass to Rich Syrek opened the fourth period for Penn, and Rick Beauvais followed with a 1-yard plunge into the end zone for Penns second touchdown. Penn quarterback Doug Marzonie hit Karl Hall, who caught 12 passes for 140 yards, for a 12-yard score to move Penn within two points in the final minute. Click to watch Gary Vuras 74-yard touchdown pass to Rich Syrek.\n\nYale 24, Penn 3 (October 24, 1981)\n\nOn a cool and sunny afternoon before 24,500 fans in the Yale Bowl, the Elis scored on their first two possessions, and totaled 429 yards for the game. Penn got only 189 yards, with 10 first downs to Yales 26. Yales Curtis Grieve had seven catches for 84 yards, including two touchdowns, raising him to sixth on the schools career list with 168 receptions. Grieve, 6-4 and 200 pounds, is said to have a 41-inch vertical leap. He made a leaping grab of John Rogans pass between two defenders on the 2-yard line, then wrestled both into the end zone for the touchdown. The 20-yard toss gave Rogan 2,343 yards, making him Yales leading career passer. He ended the game with 166, completing 14 of 22 passes. Yales opening drive, which covered 69 yards in 11 plays, culminated with the Rogan-to-Grieve connection, as Grieve made a diving catch of an 8-yard pass. Rogan was not Yales only record-breaker. When another Eli drive stalled on the Penn 32, Tony Jones kicked a 49-yard field goal, the longest in the schools history. Rich Diana, a senior tailback whose 142.4-yard game average ranked him ninth in the country, was the workhorse. Despite suffering bruised ribs during the opening drive, he carried 29 times for 153 yards. Yales defense broke no records, but it allowed Penn only one successful drive. The second time the Quakers had the ball, they went 69 yards, mostly on the strength of two big plays. Doug Marzonie completed a 28-yard pass to Steve Rubin, then Rick Beauvais, Penns leading rusher for the day, ran 31 yards to the Yale 18. But the drive stalled at the five, from where Dave Shulman notched a 22-yard field goal.

Doughertys 7-yard touchdown run 1:39 into the game gave the Blue Hens a lead they never relinquished. A 9-yard scoring run by Kevin Phelan, a blocked-punt safety and Doughertys second touchdown run increased the Hens lead to 23-0 by halftime. With less than a minute left in the game, Penns quarterback, Gary Vura, hit Karl Hall with a 14-yard scoring toss to avoid being shut out. The previous time the teams met, in 1921, Penn rolled to an 89-0 victory.\n\nHarvard 45, Penn 7 (November 14, 1981)\n\nHarvard swept past Penn, 45-7, before 10,500 chilled spectators at Harvard Stadium. Fullback Jim Callinan scored three touchdowns and gained 188 yards on 15 carries. On the first play from scrimmage, Callinan raced 68 yards for a touchdown. He scored in the third quarter on runs of nine and 66 yards. By that time, the Crimson had clinched the victory, having led at halftime, 31-0. Penn committed eight turnovers, and was unable to pierce the tough Crimson defense, finishing with only 97 yards rushing. Within 10 minutes, Harvard was up by 21-0, with Penn showing little inclination to do anything about it. The Quakers seemed disposed to help rather than hinder their foes. After Callinans opening run, in which he dashed toward left tackle, then veered to the sideline and broke away, Penn set the stage for the home teams next two touchdowns with fumbles. After 4:24 of play, Marzonie dropped back to pass on his 20-yard line and was hit by Harvards Joe Azelby. The ball popped out of his hands and was recovered by Scott Murrer. The Crimson reached the end zone in eight plays, Scott McCabe hurdling across from the two. Immediately after the ensuing kickoff, Steve Rubin fumbled on the Penn 31. Murrer again made the recovery. Again Harvard began to march. Two big gainers, each for 15 yards, were turned in by Steve Bianucci on a rush through right tackle and by Callinan on a pass from Ron Cuccia. The payoff was a 1-yard lunge by the quarterback. In the second quarter, Jim Villaneuva booted a 35-yard field goal and Allard plunged a yard for the fourth of Harvards six touchdowns.\n\nDartmouth 33, Penn 13 (November 21, 1981)\n\nDartmouth scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns at Franklin Field to cap a 33-13 rout of Penn and a season that earned the Big Green a share of the Ivy League championship with Yale. The victory over Penn was even easier than the score indicated, as Dartmouth had two other touchdowns called back on penalties in the second half. The Big Green gained 314 yards on offense to Penns 158 and managed 17 first downs to Penns seven. Only 9,500 turned out for the Quakers final home game of the season. In the first half, Penn looked every bit as bad as its 1-8 record, picking up only 15 yards on the ground in 12 attempts and one first down. Dartmouth took a 10-0 lead in the first quarter on a 35-yard field goal by Tim Geibel and an 11-yard touchdown run by Sean Maher. Four plays later, after the first of its three interceptions, Dartmouth raised the lead to 17-0 at the half on a second-quarter touchdown by Rich Lena. Penn then scored early in the third period when Karl Hall caught a 5-yard pass from Doug Marzonie, but the third quarter ended with Dartmouth ahead, 20-6, after Geibels second field goal. Two minutes into the final period, Frank Polsinello found his split end, Jack Daly, open for a 14-yard touchdown. Two plays and 24 seconds later, Charles Williams intercepted a Penn pass and ran it back 42 yards for the teams fourth touchdown.\n\nRichmond 18, Penn 12 (November 26, 1981)\n\nBarry Redden rushed for a school-record 280 yards and scored two touchdowns for Richmond. The Spiders overcame a 12-10 halftime deficit with Reddens 3-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, then staved off a Penn rally in which the Quakers drove to a first down at the Richmond 21, before being halted late in the final period. The Spiders finished at 4-7 and the Quakers suffered their ninth consecutive loss to wind up 1-9. Reddens 280-yard effort broke the previous Richmond single-game mark of 239 set by Larry Zunich in 1966. Reddens 51 carries also represented a single-game high for the Spiders. He ended the season with 1,628 yards and had 3,324 yards for his career, both school records. Redden gave Richmond a 7-0 lead with a 17-yard sprint early in the second quarter. Penn, sparked by John Shirks 48-yard return of the ensuing kickoff, struck back as Doug Marzonie threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to Chuck Nolan. The kick for the extra point failed. Following a 42-yard field goal by Richmonds Scott Schramme, Marzonie connected with Shirk on a 19-yard scoring pass to put the Quakers up at intermission for the first time all season. However, Penn once again failed to convert the two points as a pass fell incomplete. Richmond finished with 457 yards total offense to 234 for the Quakers.\n\nPenn 21, Dartmouth 0 (September 18, 1982)\n\nGary Vura shredded the defense of Dartmouth, the defending Ivy League co-champion, for three touchdown passes, setting a school completion mark while leading Penn to a 21-0 upset in the season opener for both teams. The victory snapped a 24-game losing streak on the road for Penn. Vura, a senior, completed 23 of 32 passes for 254 yards as the Quakers dominated the Indians. He connected twice with Karl Hall for touchdowns of five and 41 yards, and once with Jeff Shulte on an 8-yard scoring pass as Penn scored in each of the first three periods. David Shulman missed two field-goal attempts but kicked the extra point after each Penn touchdown. The last road game the Quakers won was a 10-9 decision at Princeton in 1976. Vuras performance eclipsed the mark of 22 completions held by Ponco Micir and Bob Graustein. The first score came at 7:07 of the first period when Vura ended an 11-play, 66-yard march with an 8-yard pass to Shulte.\n\nPenn 20, Lehigh 17 (September 25, 1982)\n\nQuarterback Gary Vura threw for two touchdowns in the third quarter as Penn won its first two games of the season for the first time since 1974. Vura threw a 5-yard pass to Steve Ortman and a 52-yarder to Karl Hall for touchdowns to put Penn in front, 20-3, in the third quarter. The Quakers also scored on field goals of 33 and 40 yards by Dave Shulman.\n\nPenn 51, Columbia 31 (October 2, 1982)\n\nGary Vura, a senior quarterback, ran for two touchdowns and threw for two more to the tight end Jeff Schulte to guide unbeaten Penn to a 51-31 victory over winless Columbia in an Ivy League game. It was Penns third victory this season, its best start since 1968. Penn improved to 2-0 in the Ivy League. Penn took a 14-0 lead in the first quarter after a 2-yard touchdown run by halfback Steve Flacco and a 10-yard touchdown pass from Vura to Schulte. The second score was set up by an interception by linebacker Matt Finn, one of five interceptions by Penn. Columbia, 0-3 overall and 0-2 in the league, struck back in the second quarter on the first of four touchdown passes by quarterback John Witkowski, a 6-yarder to tight end James Powell. But on the next drive, Vura scored his first touchdown of the game on a 6-yard run to make the Penn lead 21-7. Vura completed 17 of 26 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns. Witkowski was 22 of 42 for 262 yards, four touchdowns and five interceptions.\n\nPenn 24, Brown 21 (October 9, 1982)\n\nLafayette 35, Penn 20 (October 16, 1982)\n\nPenn 27, Yale 14 (October 23, 1982) **\n\nPundits had dismissed the Penn football teams 3-0 start in the Ivy League as an aberration. On homecoming weekend, the Quakers proved them wrong with a 27-14 victory over Yale. It was the Quakers first win over the Elis in 10 years -- in front of the largest crowd (32,175) to see a Penn football game at Franklin Field in nine years. Down, 7-3, at halftime, the Quakers rallied in the second half. Dave Shulman hit the longest field goal of his career, a 46-yarder, to cut the deficit to one, and Penn took the lead when Steve Rubin scored from five yards out. Rubin scored again -- this time on a seven yard touchdown run -- early in the fourth quarter, and Penn iced it when Steve Flacco took a pitch from quarterback Gary Vura and ran 83 yards for the score late in the fourth. Click to watch Steve Flaccos (not Steve Rubins, in spite of the call by the Penn student broadcast team) 83-yard touchdown run.\n\nPrinceton 17, Penn 14 (October 30, 1982)\n\nChris Price kicked a 42-yard field goal that barely cleared the crossbar with 25 seconds remaining to give Princeton a 17-14 upset of Penn before a crowd of 20,249 at Palmer Stadium. Prices field goal, the longest of his career, made it by about four feet in distance and less than a foot in height. Princeton is usually a passing team, but surprised Penn with a consistent running game. Brent Woods scored Princetons first touchdown and passed to Ralph Urschel for the second, which tied the score at 14 with 6:13 left. He completed 22 of 36 passes, the longest for 16 yards, and had two intercepted. Gary Vura and the Quakers couldnt generate anything until the late stages of the third quarter. They were kept scoreless for 43 minutes and 25 seconds until Steve Rubin tied the game at 7-7 with a 6-yard run. Rich Syrek pulled in a 9-yard pass from Vura 4:10 into the last quarter to give Penn a 14-7 lead. Princeton had the only score in the first half as it marched 72 yards in 15 plays in its first series. Woods mixed his plays well before scoring himself from two yards out, running off tackle on the left side. Woods was the Tigers top runner, with 65 yards on 16 attempts. Most of the runs came after Woods was looking for the pass, but his receivers were not getting open with consistency. Kevin Guthrie and Urschel, Princetons top receivers, caught four passes, with Urschels only reception his touchdown. Woods started the drive that led to the winning score at his 29 with 4:14 left. When the Tigers reached Penns 26-yard line and a pass by Woods on third down failed, Price made his kick. Vura got a last chance with three passes, the last with four seconds left, but was unsuccessful each time.\n\nPENN SURPRISES COLGATE: Penn 21, Colgate 13 (November 6, 1982)\n\nTim Chambers third interception of the game set up Penns winning touchdown in the fourth quarter, and the Quakers held on to defeat Colgate, 21-13, in the first football game between the two universities. The victory improved Penns record to 6-2 overall, the first time the Quakers had won six games since 1974. Chambers, a sophomore defensive back, also made nine unassisted tackles. He picked off one pass by Colgate quarterback Steve Calabria, in the end zone, and ran back another interception 27 yards. But the most important interception was his final one. On the second play of the fourth quarter, he picked off a halfback-option pass thrown by Joe Kozak. Three plays later, from Colgates 3-yard line, Chuck Nolan burst into the end zone. Dave Shulmans conversion kick gave the Quakers a 14-7 lead. Two series later, Scott Boggio, a defensive lineman, made Penns sixth interception of the day - Ross Armstrong had the other two - and returned the ball seven yards to the Colgate 35. After three plays, including a 25-yard pass from Gary Vura to the split end Warren Buehler, Steve Ortman ran two yards for the Quakers final touchdown. Colgate made it 21-13 on its next possession. Calabria completed four passes in an 81-yard drive that ended with a fourth-down, 2-yard touchdown run by Gil Terenzi. Chambers foiled Colgates attempt for a two-point conversion by picking off Calabrias pass in the end zone. Colgate moved 75 yards in the final 65 seconds of the game, but a Calabria pass from the Penn six fell incomplete in the end zone as the game ended.\n\nMIRACLE ON 33RD STREET: Penn 23, Harvard 21 (November 13, 1982) **\n\nThe Quakers faced Harvard in the seasons penultimate game with the Ivy League championship up for grabs for the winner. Penn raced out to a 20-0 lead, but Harvard scored three touchdowns in seven minutes in the fourth quarter to take a 21-20 lead. With three seconds remaining, Penns Dave Shulman lined up for a 38-yard field goal. The kick sailed wide left, and time expired, with Harvard apparently emerging with the championship. But there was a flag on the field. Harvard had been penalized for running into the kicker -- and Shulman would get another chance. The second time around, he split the uprights to clinch Penns first Ancient Eight championship since 1959. The next days main editorial in the DP read Harvard 21, Pennsylvania 20 with a big X through it, and then Pennsylvania 23, Harvard 21. What else is there to say? Click to watch.\n\nCORNELL FOILS PENN: Cornell 23, Penn 0 (November 20, 1982)\n\nCornell spoiled Penns efforts to take the Ivy League title outright and sent Coach Bob Blackman to retirement with tears of happiness. The Big Red upset the Quakers, 23-0, with a slashing ground attack that left Penn in a three-way tie for Ivy honors with Harvard and Dartmouth. The three had 5-2 records in the league; Penn finished 7-3 overall. From six defeats in a row, Cornell roared back with its fourth straight victory. It was more than coincidence that the Big Red resurgence began with the return of Derrick Harmon, who scored two touchdowns and accounted for 179 yards. Cornells offensive line was particularly effective, slashing holes for Harmon to sprint through. After Bill Goldy put Cornell ahead with a 37-yard field goal in the first quarter, Harmon bulled through on 2- and 3-yard touchdown plays in the second and fourth quarters after drives of 49 and 70 yards. Cornell put the game out of reach at 10:04 of the last quarter with a touchdown pass from Jeff Hammond to Steve Garrison that evolved from a fake field-goal attempt. With that play, Hammond completed his 11th of 13 passes for 127 yards. Penns only serious threat was thwarted by Scott Walter. The 5-foot-8-inch defender tackled Gary Vura as he headed around right end from the Cornell 4-yard line for what appeared to be an easy touchdown in the second period.\n\nPenn 28, Cornell 7 (September 17, 1983)\n\nAt Franklin Field, Quarterback John McGeehan drove for one touchdown and Penn converted three Cornell turnovers into scores in their Ivy League opener. Penn, the defending co-champion, ruined the coaching debut of the former all-pro linebacker Maxie Baughan, who came to Cornell after serving as a Detroit Lions assistant coach.\n\nDelaware 40, Penn 7 (September 24, 1983)\n\nJohn Cason ran for 69 yards and John Merklinger for 68 as Delaware (2-1) rushed for 315 yards and limited Penn to 43. B. J. Webster completed 11 of 16 passes, including three for touchdowns for a 19-0 lead. John McGeehan scored Penns touchdown from two yards out with 5:47 left.\n\nPenn 35, Columbia 10 (September 30, 1983)\n\nColumbia, despite some more record-setting by John Witkowski, was routed by Penn, 35-10, proving once again that it takes more than a sore-thumbed quarterback throwing a wet ball to succeed. The Lions, without a permanent home field for the 1983 season because of the rebuilding of Baker Field, did not bring much of a following. Although this was Columbias homecoming game, there were only 7,221 spectators in the 76,000-seat stadium. Witkowski did not have a good game. He completed only 15 of 41 passes for 202 yards, with no touchdowns and two interceptions. Witkowski was playing with a bruised right thumb, injured in the second period. He waited until after the game for X-rays, which showed no fracture. Witkowski still threw the ball fairly well, but his receivers, including Bill Reggio and Don Lewis, dropped 10 of his throws on this rainy night. Witkowski still set Ivy (299 career completions and 3,785 career passing yards) and school (5,442 yards total offense) records, all previously held by Marty Domres, the Columbia quarterback from 1966 through 1968. But the player setting the records that affected the games outcome was Karl Hall, a 5-foot-7-inch, 160-pound senior receiver who had caught only one pass, for five yards, in Penns first two games. Hall caught three touchdown passes in the opening half, for 33 and 42 yards from John McGeehan and 55 yards from Jim Crocicchia. Halls three touchdown receptions tied Ivy League, school and Giants Stadium (for collegiate games) records.\n\nPenn 24, Brown 24 (October 8, 1983) **\n\nBrown took advantage of Penn mistakes to force a 24-24 tie, before 14, 576 fans at Franklin Field. Browns 17 points in the first half -- including one touchdown with just seven seconds to play before intermission -- all were scored after taking advantage of a Penn mistake, and its fourth quarter touchdown came after a Quaker field goal attempt was blocked. The Red and Blue offense did put impressive numbers in the records, rushing for 143 yards and passing for 280 for 423 yards in total offense. The game featured five lead changes before Dave Shulmans 37-yard field goal tied the game on Penns next-to-last possession of the game. Following Shulmans kick, Brown marched 62 yards to get within range for a 24-yard field goal attempt which was wide right with just 11 seconds to play in the game.

For the first time in 59 games, going back to 1977, Yale failed to score. Penn scored on its first offensive series with such efficiency that a rout seemed possible. That series, 59 yards in eight plays, featured tailback Stan Koss running outside and scoring from the 2-yard line. But the Yale defense, led by the middle guard, John Zanieski, cut off the Red and Blues running game and the halftime score stood at 7-0. After the half, Penn switched quarterbacks, Jim Crocicchia replacing John McGeehan, and the replacement came up with two big plays. The first was a 48-yard touchdown pass to Karl Hall, a 5-foot-7-wide receiver. The second important play was a 45-yard pass, Crocicchia to another wide receiver, Rich Syrek, that set up a 41-yard field goal by Dave Shulman, also in the third period. Shulman, the Ivy Leagues best kicker the previous season, had missed on all but one of his previous six attempts this year. The rest of the game was a muddle, with 20 penalties totaling 181 yards disrupting both offenses. One penalty was odd. On a twice-tipped pass play that brought Yale to the Penn five, the linesman, George Kane, blew a whistle while the play was in progress. Because the whistle had been blown, the play had officially ended at the Penn 46, not the five, said Referee Arthur Marchand. Cozza, enduring his most trying season of his 18 years as head coach here, commented, I never heard of such a thing before. But the officials did not lose the game.\n\nPENN SURVIVES PRINCETON: Penn 28, Princeton 27 (October 29, 1983) **\n\nThere are 60 minutes of playing time, and Jerry Berndts teams seem to make sure all 3600 seconds are played to the hilt. But this game did not come down to the last second. There were still a whole 31 seconds left when the games big play was made. The big play came on a Princeton two-point conversion attempt, after the Tigers had driven 76 yards in 12 plays, using 3:40 and scoring on a Doug Butler 21-yard fourth down pass to Derek Graham. Princeton went for two points and the victory, but Penn defensive end David (Bubba) Smith sacked Butler,"
