Patton Jr.\n\nThe Memorial Wall is the solemn space where brothers and sisters who passed on invite others to take up their torch and carry it forward. Today, your union stands steadfast in the values and work ethics our founders and fellow members lived and died for. We are proud to pay them an everlasting tribute. Our lives and livelihoods are better today because they cared. We thank them for their deeds and dedication and proudly engrave their names in this wall as a small token of our appreciation.\n\nTogether, UA 725 and Union Memorials.com have formed the UA 725 Memorial Wall to pay tribute to our fallen brothers. In the true spirit of our Union heritage, let’s pause and reflect on the paths taken by our Brothers who were here with us. Take a moment to visit the dedications and honor those we worked with, laughed with, and loved. The UA 725 Memorial Wall is a place of honor, built with Union pride, to hold fast to their memory. Be proud of this, your Union heritage.\n\nThrough a special partnership arrangement with Union Memorials.com, we have received special pricing for our UA 725 brothers. E-mail sales@unionmemorials.com if you are interested in personalizing and upgrading any of the memorials below to include music, photographs, etc. Mention that you are member of this Union and receive your discount. You can also speak with your Local Union for further information.\n\nThe names listed below are brothers who recently passed away. They will be sadly missed."
