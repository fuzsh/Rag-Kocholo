        "text": "Sayyid Abd ar-Rahman al-Haydari al-Gillani (عبد الرحمن الحيدري الكيالي)‎ (1841–1927) was the first prime minister of modern Iraq. Born to a prominent Baghdad family that had founded the Sufi mystical order of Islam, al-Gillani was chosen in 1920 to head the Iraqi Council of Ministers following the disolution of the Ottoman Empire. He used his influence to oppose the appointment of Faisal of Syria as king of Iraq and resigned his post when his efforts were defeated. Nevertheless, Faisal reappointed him as prime minister in order to curb opposition.\n\nIn 1922 Gillani negotiated the first Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, which ensured nominal independence for the country, though Britain maintained control of the military and foreign affairs, essentially establishing a Mandate in the country. Opposed to these results, Gillani resigned shortly after. He died in 1927.\n\nIn Tazkara Qadria (http://www.algillani.org/books/tazkira_qadria_eng/main_tqe.htm) on page# 71, His Holiness Sayyed Tahir Allauddin Algillani (RA) (http://algillani.org/sta/index.shtml) grand son of Sayyad Abd ar-Rahman Al-Gillani (RA) and a member of prominent Baghdad family wrote:\n\n. Sayyad Shaikh-ul-Mashaikh Abdur Rehman Al-Gillani: Son of Sayyadna Ali An-Naqeeb Al-Gillani. Trustee of Auqaf Qadiria Trust. Spiritual leader of the contemporary Muslim world. Head of the missionaries in Africa in Qadiria order. Promoter of this order all over the globe. Also served as Prime Minister of the Govt. of Iraq. He was reported to have KHILAT-I- KHILAFAT (Robes of Khilafat) conferred upon him in a dream by Sayyadna Ghous-ul-Azam Hadhrat Meeran Muhayyuddin Sheikh Abdul Qadir Gillani (RA) with good tidings in the presence of a AULIA-I-ALLAH (Friends of God). A testimony to this effect is attributed to a number of spiritual personages. The British functionaries offered him important position of prestige in the Government of Iraq in 1919 AD, but he refused on the plea that the Christian award was not acceptable. However in deference to the wishes of the people he agreed to assume the office of the Prime Minister of Iraq in the larger interest of the Iraqi people. He is stated to have said in his acceptance speech: I accept the premiership of Iraq in the hope that I shall be able, through my personal endeavours, to do away with the hegemony of the non-Muslims especially the Christians which they are carrying out in Iraq and other Arab countries through their interference in their internal affairs. Sayyadna Abdur Rehman had tremendous influence on the contemporary Muslim kings, rulers and prominent leaders and many of them were his disciples. For detailed information in this context reference is invited to the English Books.:\" A clash of Loyalties Mesopotamia war (1917 to 1920) by Sir Arnold William (page 336 to 340 ) Vol-2. And TARIKHAT ANWARAT IRAQIA part I compiled by Ar-Razzaq Al-Hasmi. The inward spiritual influence exercised by him on all and Sundry, won him great esteem and respect. Every one bowed to him deferentially and obediently from the core of the heart. He was ever ready to render service unto Islam and conspicuous for his generosity and magnanimity of heart. As high calibre practicing scholar, he was widely reputed for his piety, God-fearing and observance of Shariah in letter and spirit Millions of people in the Muslim world war his disciples and devotees."
