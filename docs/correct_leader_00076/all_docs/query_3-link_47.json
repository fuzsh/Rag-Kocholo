        "text": "Efforts are being made to modify polylactic acid for long term utilities. Literature survey reveals that blending with other polymers in the presence of eventual compatibilizers and the use of additives, such as plasticizers, have a significant effect on the degradability of polylactic acid as shown in Table 1.\n\nPlasticizers\n\nPlasticizers are used as additives which increase elongation at break, the stretching of plastic before it breaks, along with reduction in glass transition temperature and elastic modulus. Many studies have reported the use of different additives as plasticizers which promote degradation of polylactic acid. For example, Arrieta et al. (2014b) reported that the use of polyethylene glycol and acetyl-tri-n-butyl citrate, as plasticizer, can enhance polylactic acid degradation, where weight loss was higher than 90% after 28 days of incubation under composting conditions. In another example, Gardella et al. (2017) investigated the effects of a dendrimer like structure, a hyperbranched polyglycerol core poly(d-lactide) arms, as a plasticizer on the degradation rate of polylactic acid under composting conditions. The authors reported a faster degradation and increase in hydrophilicity of the polymer, up to about 30%. The authors attributed the faster degradation to increased hydrophilicity of the modified polylactic acid. Similar results were also reported by many other authors including Xie et al. (2014) and Sharma et al. (2021) while investigating the degradation of plasticized polylactic acid.\n\nThe degradation of modified polylactic acid depends on the nature of the additive used. In some cases, the use of plasticizer is shown to have very little or no effects on the degradation of polylactic acid. For example, Balart et al. (2018) reported that the use of epoxidized linseed oil, as plasticizer and or compatibilizer, can delay the degradation of polylactic acid. The authors reported that plasticized polylactic acid showed a weight loss of 61% only, while this value for unplasticized polylactic acid was 86%. Likewise, literature review reveals that other additives, when used as plasticizer, including d-limonene, glucose pentaacetate, sucrose octaacetate and glucose hexanoate esters, are reported to have slight or no effects on polylactic acid in terms of degradation (Fortunati et al. 2014; Nair et al. 2012; Yang and Hakkarainen 2015).\n\nBlends with hydrophilic polymers\n\nBlending with hydrophilic polymers is another approach for the modification of polylactic acid to improve mechanical properties as well as degradability. As polylactic acid is hydrophobic in nature, therefore blending it with hydrophilic polymers/polysaccharide has been shown to increase its degradability, attributed to an increase in hydrophilic characteristic of the polymer. For example, Claro et al. (2016) have shown that polylactic acid/chitosan and polylactic acid/cellulose acetate blends allow rapid biodegradation as compared to neat polylactic acid. Lv et al. (2017) studied the biodegradation of polylactic acid blended with starch and wood flour for 105 days under ambient environmental conditions and reported an accelerated degradation of polylactic acid. The authors concluded that the degradation of starch created holes in the polylactic acid matrix which facilitated the diffusion of water, leading to an enhanced hydrolysis of polylactic acid.\n\nIn another example, Wilfred et al. (2018) investigated the biodegradation of polylactic acid/starch blend in a commercial compost and soil for 14 and 28 days. The authors reported that the degradation rate of polylactic acid/starch blend was higher as compared to neat polylactic acid. These results also reveal a positive correlation of starch content and degradation rate, as proposed by Yamano et al. (2014) that biodegradability is correlated with hydrophilicity. Likewise, a number of studies have shown that blending of polylactic acid with hydrophilic polymers and or polysaccharides can make them more susceptible to degradation as shown in Table 1.\n\nBlends with hydrophobic polymers\n\nChuayjuljit et al. (2017) studied the degradation of polylactic acid blended with poly(butylene succinate) in natural environment, buried in soil under ambient environmental temperature for 90 days. The authors reported faster degradation of blended polylactic acid and attributed it to the faster degradation of poly(butylene succinate). Similar results were also reported for blending of polylactic acid with other hydrophobic polymers, for example poly(β-hydroxybutyrate) (Bonartsev et al. 2012) and poly(vinyl acetate) (Haque et al. 2017).\n\nHowever, not necessarily the blending of polylactic acid with hydrophobic polymers could contribute to their degradability profile. For example, Luzi et al. (2016) reported a decrease in the degradation of polylactic acid blended with poly(butylene succinate), compared to neat polylactic acid, attributed to higher crystallinity induced by poly(butylene succinate). These contradictions in the results, as compared to Chuayjuljit et al. (2017), could be attributed to the difference in the percentage of poly(butylene succinate) content in the blend and composting conditions as well. Furthermore, in some cases the blending of polylactic acid with hydrophobic polymers is shown to have varying effects on the degradation of polylactic acid, as shown in Table 1.\n\nComposites\n\nCompounding of polylactic acid with other materials, having significantly different characteristics, either synthetically or artificially to obtain composites is another approach to improve the degradation rate of polylactic acid. Many studies have reported significant improvements in the degradation rate of the resultant polylactic acid composites. For example, Yaacob et al. (2016) investigated the degradation of paddy straw powder/polylactic acid composite and reported an improved degradation rate of polylactic acid in natural soil burial experiment. The authors attributed the improved degradation rate to the hydrophilic nature of paddy straw. In another work, Zandi et al. (2019) investigated the benzylated pulp (rich in cellulose)/polylactic acid and pulping liquor (rich in lignin)/polylactic acid composites in an indoor soil biodegradation experiment. The authors reported considerable biodegradation of polylactic acid composites, attributed to lower glass transition temperature and higher water absorption, in addition to larger biodegradation of filler. Similar results were also reported by many other authors as shown in Table 1.\n\nCompatibilizers for polymer blend and composite\n\nMany studies have reported that the use of compatibilizers can affect the degradation rate of polylactic acid in blends and composites. For example, Fortunati et al. (2013a) investigated a blend of polylactic acid with ethylene–vinyl acetate-glycidylmethacrylate copolymer, on the degradation rate of polylactic acid. The authors reported a faster degradation of the blend, 71% weight loss, under aerobic conditions in the presence of compost inoculum at 58 °C, as compared to neat polylactic acid. The authors attributed it to the faster diffusion of water in to the polymer mixture. Persenaire et al. (2014) also studied the biodegradation of polylactic acid/poly(butylene succinate) blends in the presence of a compatibilizer, maleic-anhydride-grafted polylactic acid and maleic-anhydride-grafted poly(butylene succinate), under composting conditions, in a test chamber under 50 °C and humidity of 50% for 475 h. The authors reported an enhanced molar mass loss in the presence of compatibilizer as compared to the polylactic acid/poly(butylene succinate) blend. Similar results were also reported by many other studies, including Olewnik-Kruszkowska et al. (2020), Sun et al. (2021), Wan and Zhang (2018) and Wan et al. (2019), while investigating the degradation of polylactic acid after the addition of compatibilizers, as shown in Table 1.\n\nIn contrast to these results, a few studies have shown that the use of compatibilizer can also negatively affect the degradation rate of polylactic acid. For example, Carbonell-Verdu et al. (2018) reported that the use of epoxidized cotton seed oil derivatives, as compatibilizer in polylactic acid/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) binary blends, reduced the disintegration ability of polylactic acid. The authors attributed the reduced disintegration rate of the blend to the lower disintegration rate of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate). However, it is worthy to note that the compatibilizer do improve some of the mechanical properties of the blend as reported by Luzi et al. (2016).\n\nRecently some studies have shown that polylactic acid microplastics have a prominent impact on marine biota. Due to their compostable nature, polylactic acid microplastics cannot be degraded and are assimilated as all marine biota do not have the specific enzymes responsible for their degradation. In case of petroleum-based microplastics, it is well known that ingestion of these contaminants can cause a number of adverse effects. However, in the case of polylactic acid microplastics, very recently scientific community has shown an interest in their ecotoxicological evaluation. Very few studies have been conducted on the impact of polylactic acid microplastics on limited number of aquatic species which revealed that in some cases these contaminants can negatively affect the exposed individuals analogous to petroleum-based microplastics. The literature survey reveals that Green et al. (2016) is pioneer in assessing the toxic effects of polylactic acid microplastics on aquatic biota. After this, many research studies focused on the ecotoxicological evaluation of polylactic acid microplastics using a range of experimental model species (Table 2).\n\nMicrobial communities\n\nSediment microbial communities consist of large number of the earth’s biodiversity and which play a key role in biogeochemical cycling of nutrients (Vincent et al. 2021) and ecological purification of pollutants (John et al. 2022). The presence of microplastics in the environment provides a new habitat to these microbes (McCormick et al. 2014), but on the other hand, the degradation of these polymers can produce toxic substances which will have negative effects on these microbes (Kong et al. 2018). A few species of bacteria will be benefited but the others will be negatively affected (Li et al. 2020), as different species of bacteria respond differently to the presence of microplastics (Wang et al. 2020). The impact of petroleum-based microplastics on microbial communities is well studied. However, studies focusing on the impact of polylactic acid microplastics on microbial communities are scarce.\n\nSeeley et al. (2020) have conducted a 2-week microcosm experiment to investigate the effects of petroleum-based and bio-based microplastics on composition and function of sedimentary microbial communities. They reported a significant alteration in microbial communities exposed to petroleum-based microplastics. Surprisingly, polylactic acid microplastics were found to promote nitrification and denitrification. Based on the results, the authors suggested that the microorganisms might have utilized the microplastics as organic carbon for the energy which facilitated these phenomena. However, degradation and assimilation of polylactic acid microplastics in 2 weeks have not been reported in the literature.\n\nAlgae\n\nMicroalgae are the primary producer of aquatic ecosystems which play an important role in their functioning (Casado et al. 2013). Being a primary producer, microalgae account for 50% of net production (Barbosa 2009), and therefore, any alteration in microalgae population can have serious effects on food webs. Many studies have been carried out to investigate the impact of petroleum-based microplastics on several parameters of microalgae, including growth (Long et al. 2017), morphological changes (Mao et al. 2018), chlorophyll content (Prata et al. 2018), photosynthesis (Zhang et al. 2017) and gene expression (Lagarde et al. 2016). The results of all these studies reveal that petroleum-based microplastics have deleterious effects on microalgae ranging from individual to population level.\n\nThe impact of polylactic acid microplastics on microalgae has also been investigated. Su et al. (2022) investigated the effects of petroleum-based microplastics and bio-based microplastics including polylactic acid on marine alga Chlorella vulgaris. The authors reported that both types of microplastics inhibited the growth of microalgae. However, polylactic acid microplastics were reported to have severe effects on growth of algae with highest inhibition rate of 47.95%, as compared to other petroleum-based and bio-based microplastics. The authors attributed these effects to the physiochemical properties and chemical changes of microplastics. The authors also reported that microplastics can stimulate pigments content (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoid), attributed to the cellular defense against stress. These findings are very interesting in two domains. Firstly, in the context of adaptation and or defense mechanisms against microplastics pollution, secondly, in understanding the fact that polylactic acid microplastics appear to be more toxic as compared to petroleum-based microplastics.\n\nPhytoplankton community\n\nBeing primary producers, phytoplankton plays a key role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems. Due to their key role in food chains/webs, there is a serious concern about the impact of microplastics on phytoplankton (Koenigstein 2020). Any alteration or threat to the primary producers will have significant effects on the food chains/webs and consequently on the entire ecosystems, therefore, assessing the impact of emerging pollutants on primary producers is crucial. Literature survey revealed that petroleum-based microplastics have deleterious effects on various parameters of phytoplankton including photosynthetic capacity and growth (Sánchez-Fortún et al. 2021).\n\nStudies on the impact of polylactic acid microplastics on phytoplankton are scare. Only a few studies have assessed their impact on phytoplankton. For example, Yokota and Mehlrose (2020) have assessed the impact of polylactic acid microplastics, originated from body wash scrub, on natural phytoplankton communities in a 7-days incubation experiment conducted in temperate mesotrophic lake. The authors reported that polylactic acid microplastics eliminated cryptophytes and increased chrysophytes, resulting in the alteration of taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton in the mesocosms. They suggested that chrysophytes contain a protective siliceous loricae against the polylactic acid microplastics whereas cryptophytes do not have any such protection and thereby got affected by the polylactic acid microplastics.\n\nZooplankton\n\nZooplanktons are primary consumers and located at the base of food chains/webs, thereby channeling nutrients and energy from the primary producers to higher trophic levels. Most researchers investigating the effects of microplastics on aquatic biota have focused on the primary consumers. As compared to other species, zooplanktons are more prone to microplastics and therefore documented as potential microplastics consumers (Cole and Galloway 2015). Microplastics act as analogues of zooplankton prey (Gambardella et al. 2017) and can have negative impact on different ecological processes. Recently, many studies have reported adverse effects of petroleum-based microplastics on a range of zooplankton species. The results of those studies reveal that petroleum-based microplastics have adverse effects on survival rate and reproduction (Yu et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2019a), feeding capacity and selectivity (Cole et al. 2019; Coppock et al. 2019) and behavior (Suwaki et al. 2020). However, studies investigating the effects of polylactic acid microplastics on zooplankton are scare and only a few studies are available.\n\nZimmermann et al. (2020) investigated that how polylactic acid microplastics affected the survival, reproduction, and growth of Daphnia magna in a 21-days experiment. They found that polylactic acid microplastics cause the mortality of 60% individuals exposed to 500 mg/L, while in control the mortality was 5%. The authors also reported decrease in reproductive output and body length in the exposed individuals, induced by the microplastics themselves rather than leachates or additives. Similarly, very recently Di Giannantonio et al. (2022) studied the effects of polylactic acid microplastics on uptake of microplastics, immobility, and behavior of two zooplankton species, the crustacean Artemia franciscana and the cnidarian Aurelia species (common jellyfish) in a 24 h experiment. The authors reported polylactic acid microplastics in the digestive system of A. franciscana and in the gelatinous tissue of Aurelia species exposed to 100 mg/L, with no effects on the immobility of both the species. However, significant alterations were reported in the swimming behavior (pulsation) of Aurelia species at all the exposure concentrations (1, 10 and 100 mg/L), attributed to the direct toxicity of polylactic acid microplastics. It is worthy to note that the concentration of microplastics used in majority of the ecotoxicological studies, to evaluate their potential effects on the exposed organisms, are much higher as compared to their concentrations found in the natural environment.\n\nAnnelids\n\nAnnelids are invertebrates which play an important role in benthic ecosystems by serving as a link from primary producers to higher trophic levels and in the cycling of minerals (Rafia and Ashok 2014). They are the dominant invertebrates of the deep sea and mostly occupy sediments. Recent studies reported that petroleum-based microplastics can have deleterious effects on various parameters of annelids which include decrease in food intake (Wright et al. 2013), impairment of immune system, physical stress and even death (Browne et al. 2013), leading to a drastic impact on ecological processes (Green et al. 2016). To the best of our knowledge, only three studies have assessed the negative effects of polylactic acid microplastics on annelids. Klein et al. (2021) investigated the impact of polylactic acid microplastics (mixed and or layered on sediment surface) on freshwater worms (Lumbriculus variegatus) under laboratory conditions. The authors reported a significant reduction in the survival of the worms exposed to microplastics mixed with the sediments. However, they attributed the toxicity to the associated chemicals rather than to the polymer.\n\nSimilarly, Green et al. (2016) assessed the effects of polylactic acid and petroleum-based microplastics on lugworms (Arenicola marina) using concentrations of 0.02, 0.20 and 2% (wet sediment weight) in a 31-days mesocosm experiment with focus on health, biological activity and nitrogen cycling, in addition to the primary productivity of the sediments. The authors reported a significant impact of both types of microplastics on the health and behavior of the exposed individuals, as well as reduction in the primary productivity of the sediments they inhabited. Polylactic acid microplastics exposure not only reduced the feeding activity of the exposed individuals but also reduced the biomass of the algae on the surface of sediments. They also found that polylactic acid microplastics reduced the concentration of ammonia in pore water, which might be due to the potential of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of polylactic acid to adsorb cations.\n\nIn another study, Green et al. (2017), while investigating the ecological impacts of polylactic acid and petroleum-based microplastics, high-density polyethylene, on the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, found a difference in faunal invertebrate assemblages in the exposed groups, with less polychaetes and more oligochaetes, highlighting the potential of polylactic acid microplastics to affect ecosystem. These results are quite interesting in the context of species-specific response to microplastics (Bai et al. 2021) or other contaminants, as both the species were exposed to the same types and concentrations of microplastics but showed completely different responses.\n\nMollusks\n\nMollusks are a diverse group of filter feeders which can be found in a variety of aquatic habitats. They provide ecological services to a number of organisms ranging from habitat to food (Fernández-Pérez et al. 2018). Being filter feeders, mollusks can accumulate and transfer microplastics to higher trophic levels, which will have detrimental effects on their consumers including humans. Therefore, many ecotoxicological studies have used mollusks as bioindicators of pollution (Capillo et al. 2018). However, there are only a few studies available on the impact of polylactic acid microplastics on mollusks. Green et al. (2017) studied the ecological impacts of polylactic acid and petroleum-based microplastics on the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of bivalve-dominated European flat oysters (Ostrea edulis) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) habitats in outdoor 50-days mesocosms experiment, using two different concentrations of 2.5 and 25 μg/L for each type of microplastics. The authors reported a significant reduction in filtration by M. edulis (exposed to 25 μg/L), while no effects were observed on ecosystem functioning or the associated assemblages of invertebrates. On the other hand, the authors reported a significant increase in filtration by O. edulis after exposure to 2.5 and 25 μg/L and decrease in the pore water ammonium and biomass of benthic cyanobacteria.\n\nKhalid et al. (2021) also studied the effects of polylactic acid microplastics on blue mussels (M. edulis) using two different concentrations, 10 and 100 μg/L, in an 8-days experiment with biochemical endpoints. The authors found no significant effects of polylactic acid microplastics on M. edulis in terms of oxidative stress (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase activities), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase), and immunotoxicity (lysosomal membrane stability and acid phosphatase activity). In contrast to these results, Green et al. (2019) found a significant alteration in the immunological profile of haemolymph of Mytilus edulis exposed to polylactic acid microplastics in a 52-days mesocosms experiment. However, the authors found no adverse effects of polylactic acid microplastics on the attachment strength of the exposed individuals.\n\nGreen (2016) investigated that how polylactic acid and petroleum-based microplastics at low and high concentrations (0.8 and 80 μg/L) affect the health and biological functioning of European flat oysters (Ostrea edulis) along with the impact on structure of associated macro faunal assemblages in a 60-days mesocosm experiment. They reported minimal effects on the exposed individuals, but the associated macro faunal assemblages were significantly altered which were ~ 1.2 and 1.5 times reduced as compared to the control. For instance, the biomass of Scrobicularia plana (peppery furrow shell clam), the abundance of juvenile Littorina sp. (periwinkles) and Idotea balthica (an isopod) were decreased 1.5, 2.0 and 8.0 times in groups exposed to either type of microplastics compared to the control.\n\nBeside the mussels, other filter feeder organisms were also used for the ecotoxicological evaluation of microplastics. For example, Anderson and Shenkar (2021) investigated the impact of polyethylene terephthalate and polylactic acid microplastics on the biological and ecological features of a solitary ascidian (Microcosmus exasperatus). The authors reported that both polylactic acid and petroleum-based microplastics had similar impact on the exposed individuals; for example, both types of microplastics reduced the fertilization rates in the exposed individuals.\n\nFish\n\nFish are a good source of unsaturated fatty acids and proteins; therefore, their consumption is recommended in human diet (Ali et al. 2017). Therefore, assessment of microplastics and its consequent impact on fish is of major environmental importance. Many ecotoxicological studies have used fish as bioindicator of water quality and ecosystem health. Fish have the potential to accumulate and magnify pollutants which may have potential impacts on their consumers including humans. Many studies have reported the ingestion and accumulation of petroleum-based microplastics in a range of fish species, while studies on polylactic acid microplastics are very few.\n\nRecently, Chagas et al. (2021) studied the bioaccumulation of polylactic acid microplastics, at a concentration of 2.5 and 5 mg/L, in adult zebrafish and its consequent impact on behavioral, biochemical, and morphological parameters in a 30-days experiment. The authors reported the accumulation of microplastics in the liver, brain, gills, and carcass of the exposed group in addition to behavioral and morphological changes. The reported behavioral and biochemical changes were shoals predictive of co-specific social interaction and an anti-predator defense response defect, attributed to cholinergic changes inferred by an increase in the activity of acetylcholinesterase and redox imbalance whereas the morphological changes were alteration In the pigmentation pattern. However, in contrast to de Oliveira et al. (2021), no locomotor damages or anxiety-like behavior was observed in the exposed individuals. The possible reason might be difference in the life stages of the test organism as early life stages are more sensitive to different contaminants.\n\nMost studies, while investigating the effects of various contaminants on aquatic organisms, have focused on early life stages of fish, for example larvae and embryo (Mu et al. 2022), because of their sensitivity to different contaminants (Schweizer et al. 2018), which are critical on individual and population health's point of view. For instance, zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been widely used as a biological model and/or as a representative of fish group by many researchers to investigate the toxicological impact of microplastics. de Oliveira et al. (2021) investigated the effects of polylactic acid microplastics (3 and 9 mg/L) on zebrafish larvae in a 5-days exposure experiment with behavioral and biochemical endpoints. The authors reported a decrease in the swimming speed and distance of the exposed individuals in open field test. The authors attributed these outcomes as a consequent impact of microplastics on fish locomotor and exploration activities. They also reported anxiety like behavior and accumulation of microplastics, which inhibited the activity of acetylcholinesterase leading to the reinforcement of neurotoxic action in the exposed group.\n\nSimilarly, another study also focused on the impact of polylactic acid microplastics (virgin and degraded) on zebrafish larvae (Zhang et al. 2021). They found a slower efflux and detoxification of degraded polylactic acid, mediated by ABC transporters and P450 enzymes, leading to increase in bioaccumulation of microplastics and thereby inhibiting the skeletal development of larvae. They also pointed the higher toxicity of degraded polylactic acid microplastics by identification of crucial mechanisms, for example, mitochondrial structural damage by oxidative stress, apoptosis, depolarization, and fission inhibition. However, no effects were reported on the hatching rate of larvae when exposed to both types of polylactic acid microplastics. The authors attributed these outcomes to the fact that the size of microplastics was larger as compared to the chorionic pore canals and the resistance of the chorionic barrier to polylactic acid microplastics.\n\nVery recently, Duan et al. (2022) compared the accumulation and toxicity of polylactic acid and poly(ethylene terephthalate) microplastics using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model organism. The authors reported 170 times higher polylactic acid microplastics in the fish as compared to poly(ethylene terephthalate) microplastics resulting in intestinal epithelial tract damage followed by affecting the diversity of intestinal microbiota. The authors attributed these results to the depolymerization of polylactic acid in the digestive tract of fish, which decreased the intestinal pH and changed the carbon source structure. These results are quite interesting in understanding the toxicity of polylactic acid microplastics. These findings strongly support the concept that polylactic acid microplastics will have severe effects, similar to petroleum-based plastics, on the exposed individuals."
