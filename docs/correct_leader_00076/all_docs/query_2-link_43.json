        "text": "Republic of Iraq\n\nMinistry of Defence\n\nMinistry of Defence insignia\n\nDepartment overviewFormed February 22, 2004 (As modern department)Jurisdiction IraqHeadquarters BaghdadMinister responsible\n\nSaadoun al-Dulaimi\n\nDefense Minister\n\nThe Ministry of Defence (Arabic language: وزارة الدفاع العراقية‎) is the Iraq government agency responsible for Defence of Iraq. It is also involved with internal security.\n\nAuthority[]\n\nThe Ministry directs all the Iraqi Armed Forces, comprising a Joint Headquarters, the Iraqi Ground Forces Command (which controls the Army), the Iraqi Special Operations Forces, the Iraqi Army, the Iraqi Navy (including Marines), and the Iraqi Air Force.[1]\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Ministry was dissolved by Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2 of mid-2003. It was formally re-established by CPA Order 61 of February 22, 2004. In the interim period, the CPA Office of Security Affairs served as the de facto Ministry of Defence.[2]\n\nThe Iraqi Counter Terrorism Bureau directs the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Command, which is a further military force answerable to the Prime Minister of Iraq directly. As of 30 June 2009, there had been legislation in progress for a year to make the Iraqi CTB a separate ministry.[3]\n\nMinister of Defense[]\n\nThe position of Minister of Defense was left vacant in the current Iraqi cabinet, approved on 21 December 2010. While it is vacant, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki serves as the acting defense minister.\n\nThe previous Minister of Defense, Lieutenant General Abd al-Qadr Muhammed Jassim al-Obaidi, is a Sunni career military officer and political independent. He had limited experience and faced a number of hurdles impeding his effective governance. Some of the major problems included inheriting a staff that is notorious for favorism, corruption, and deeply divided along sectarian and ethnic lines. He was a rival of the former Minister of the Interior Jawad al-Bolani, National Security Advisor Muwafaq al-Rubai, and Minister of Staff for National Security Affairs Shirwan al-Waili. He has been criticized for not being able to stand up to the Badr Organization and Mehdi Army members which dominate his own party. In addition, as a Sunni he faced inherent challenges working within a Shiite-dominated government.\n\nOn September 19, 2005, The Independent reported that approximately one billion US dollars have been stolen by top ranking officials from the Ministry of Defense including Hazim al-Shaalan and Ziyad Cattan.[4]\n\nPrevious defence ministers under Saddam Hussein's regime included Ali Hassan al-Majid ('Chemical Ali'). Iraq's very first minister of defence was Jafar al-Askari (1920-1922).\n\nList of Ministers of Defence[]\n\nMinisters of Defense 1921 - 1958[]\n\nName Portrait Term of office Political party Prime Minister Jafar al-Askari 23 October 1920 16 November 1922 Abd Al-Rahman Al-Gillani Nuri as-Said 20 November 1922 2 August 1924 Yasin al-Hashimi 2 August 1924 2 June 1925 Nuri as-Said 26 June 1925 8 January 1928 Abd al-Muhsin as-Sa'dun 14 January 1928 20 January 1929 Muhammad Amin Zaki 28 April 1929 25 August 1929 Nuri al-Sa’id 19 September 1929 19 March 1930 Ja’far al-‘Askari 23 March 1930 27 October 1932 Rashid al-Khawja 3 November 1932 18 March 1933 Jalal Baban 20 March 1933 28 October 1933\n\nMinisters of Defense 1958 - 1968[]\n\nName Portrait Term of office Political party President Abd al-Karim Qasim 14 July 1958 8 February 1963 Independent Muhammad Najib ar-Ruba'i Salah Mahdi Ammash 8 February 1963 10 November 1963 Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party Abdul Salam Arif Hardan al-Tikriti 10 November 1968 2 March 1964 Tahir Yahya 2 March 1964 3 September 1965 Arab Socialist Union Arif Abd ar-Razzaq 6 September 1965 16 September 1965 Arab Socialist Union Abd al-'Aziz al-'Uqaili 21 September 1965 18 April 1966 Shakir Mahmud Shukri 18 April 1966 17 July 1968 Abdul Rahman Arif\n\nMinisters of Defense 1968 - 2003[]\n\nName Portrait Term of office Political party President Ibrahim Abdel Rahman Dawoud 17 July 1968 30 July 1968 Independent Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr Hardan al-Tikriti 30 July 1968 April 1970 Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party Hammad Shihab April 1970 30 June 1973 Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party Abdullah al-Khadduri (acting) 30 June 1973 11 November 1974 Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr 11 November 1974 15 October 1977 Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party Adnan Khairallah 15 October 1977 4 May 1989 Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party Saddam Hussein Abdel Jabbar Khalil Shanshal 4 May 1989 1990 Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party Saadi Tuma Abbas 1990 1991 Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party Ali Hassan al-Majid 1991 1995 Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party Sultan Hashim Ahmad al-Tai 1995 2003 Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party\n\nMinisters of Defense 2003 - present[]\n\nName Portrait Term of office Political party Prime Minister Ali Allawi April 2004 June 2004 Independent Ayad Allawi Hazim al-Shaalan June 2004 1 June 2005 Iraqi National Congress Saadoun al-Dulaimi 1 June 2005 6 March 2006 Independent Ibrahim al-Jaafari Qadir Obeidi 6 March 2006 21 December 2010 Independent Nouri al-Maliki Nouri al-Maliki 21 December 2010 17 August 2011 State of Law Coalition Saadoun al-Dulaimi 17 August 2011 incumbent Unity Alliance of Iraq\n\nNotes[]\n\nFurther reading[]\n\nRAND, 'Developing Iraq's Security Sector: The Coalition Provisional Authority's Experience,' 2005, p. 27-32\n\n[]"
