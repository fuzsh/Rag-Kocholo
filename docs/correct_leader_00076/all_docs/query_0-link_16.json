        "meta_description": "Despite numerous family planning awareness campaigns, modern contraceptive prevalence remains low in Pakistan. This reality stimulates risky sexual behaviours and compromises reproductive rights. Our study has explored factors associated with modern contraceptive use among sexually active married women in Pakistan.     This study used data from the 2017-2018 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS). A total of 10,282 married women who were sexually active during the last 3 months prior to the survey were included in this study.     The prevalence of modern contraceptive use among sexually active married women in Pakistan equals to 27.7%. Furthermore, the results indicate that age, region, education level, wealth index, fieldworker visit, and number of children were signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with modern contraceptive use among sexually active married women in Pakistan.     The group of sexually active married women in Pakistan is not homogeneous. In order to increase prevalence of modern contraception in this population, different groups of women should be targeted with family planning interventions specific to their needs.",
