        "text": "\"Abdur Rahman\" and \"Abdelrahman\" redirect here. For other uses, see Abdur Rahman (disambiguation).\n\nAbdelrahman or Abd al-Rahman or Abdul Rahman or Abdurrahman or Abdrrahman (Arabic: عبد الرحمن or occasionally عبد الرحمان; DMG ʿAbd ar-Raḥman) is a male Arabic Muslim given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Rahman. The name means \"servant of the most gracious\", ar-Rahman being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.[1][2]\n\nThe letter A of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by u. Because the letter R is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Rahman, the usual pronunciation corresponds to Abd ar-Rahman. Alternative transliterations include Abd ar-Rahman, Abdulrahman, Abdur Rehman, Abdul Rehman, Abidur Rahman, Abdrrahman, and others, all subject to variant spacing and hyphenation. Certain transliterations tend to be associated with certain areas, for example, Abdirahman in Somalia, Abderrahmane in French-speaking North Africa, or Abdelrahman in Egypt.\n\nNotable people with the name include:"
