        "text": "Besides a surge in terrorist activities, events following the 11 September terrorist attack on the United States have raised a new challenge for the world: the emergence of transnational Islamic networks, predominantly influenced by organizations such as Ikhwan al Muslimeen (the Muslim Brotherhood) and Al Qaeda, which are helping to spread a particular religious ideology across the globe and are also having an impact on pre-existing groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This article gives an overview of the role of Islamist networks and their influence, drawn from Al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood, in South and South-west Asia and the Afghanistan–Pakistan region in particular. It also explains how local like-minded outfits have used Al Qaeda's anti-Western jargon to recruit foot soldiers and enlist support within their society, besides serving as financial conduits for the radical Wahabite/Salafi reformists.\n\n38 Ibid., p. 138. One can gauge the Tablighi Jamaat's pull from the fact that, despite being a moderate and liberal Muslim, Farooq Leghari, a former president of Pakistan, attended the Tablighi Jamaat's annual congregation in the mid-1990s while he was still in office. Another extreme example was General Mehmood Ahmed, a former chief of the ISI, who joined the Tablighi Jamaat after his forced retirement in October 1999 and spends weeks every year in promoting its cause. A number of national cricketers, including the former captain Inzamul Haq, Mushtaq Ahmed, and Yousuf Yohanna, are also currently active members of Tablighi Jamaat; Yohanna, in fact, converted from Christianity to Islam because of the Tablighi Jamaat and now uses Muhammad Yousuf as his full Muslim name. The popular pop singers Junaid Jamshed, Ali Haider, and Najam Sheeraz are a few more examples of how Tablighi Jamaat can influence individuals usually considered areligious; at the height of their singing careers these three prolific artists fell under the influence of the Tablighi Jamaat and now, besides performing either recitations of religious songs and hymns or, in the case of Jamshed, pursuing other business such as branded menswear, they preach Islam. Jamshed also conducts TV programmes from the Tablighi perspective.\n\n47 Particularly since the late 1990s, Jamaat-ud-Dawah (and formerly Lashkar-e-Taiba) has been a major irritant in India's relations with Pakistan. India dubs the Wahabi outfit as the ‘Pakistan army's first line of defence’, which it says has carried out terrorist attacks not only in Kashmir but elsewhere in India. As far back as 1998, Lashkar-e-Taiba had launched and eventually executed the concept of fedayeen (suicide squad) attacks. Several such strikes, including one on the Indian Parliament in December 2001 and the almost simultaneous multiple bloody acts of violence in Mumbai on 26 November 2008, bore the hallmarks of such fedayeen attacks. In fact, the November 2008 strikes, including those on the Taj and Oberoi Trident hotels in Mumbai – eleven in all – once again shook the entire region. The three-day carnage was allegedly the work of several attackers who had travelled from the port city of Karachi in Pakistan. These acts of terror provided Indian officials and the media with another opportunity to point a finger at the ISI. The electronic media in India whipped up a frenzy that aroused fears of yet another war between the two now nuclear-armed nations. On 10 December 2008, India formally requested the United Nations Security Council to designate Jamaat-ud-Dawah as a terrorist organization. The following day, the Security Council imposed sanctions on Jamaat-ud-Dawah, declaring it a global terrorist group. Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the chief of Jamaat-ud-Dawah, announced that his group would challenge the sanctions imposed on it in all forums. Pakistan's government also banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah on the same day and issued an order to seal the Jamaat-ud-Dawah offices in all four provinces, as well as in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. The United States likewise designated Jamaat-ud-Dawah as a foreign terrorist group posing a threat to its security. In January 2009, the Jamaat-ud-Dawah spokesperson, Abdullah Muntazir, stressed that the group did not have global jihadist aspirations and would welcome a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue. He also publicly disowned the Lashkar-e-Taiba commanders Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and Zarrar Shah, who have both been accused of being the masterminds behind the November 2008 Mumbai attacks.\n\n48 Proof of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan's involvement in Afghanistan – and of the close association between the Afghan Taliban and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan – came in early June 2008, when eighteen militants belonging to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan fell to air strikes by Coalition forces on militant positions in Afghanistan's Helmand province. All eighteen were from Makeen village in the Waziristan Agency. Ruthless attacks on Pakistani military and government targets offer ample evidence that, while publicly Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan wants to counter US hegemony, it also wants to keep Pakistani forces on tenterhooks. It has furthermore joined hands with Al Qaeda to stage devastating suicide bombings since mid-2007 – killing government, military and intelligence officials, and women and children across the board – which has turned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan into a major source of instability, besides the anti-Shia radical Lashkare Jhangvi. Pakistan's security establishment treats Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan as its public enemy no. 1 for its string of vicious attacks all over Pakistan. The United States also formally designated it as a foreign terrorist organization. Daniel Benjamin, the Ambassador-at-Large for Counterterrorism, formally announced this at a press briefing, thereby making Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan the latest addition to a list of forty-seven such organizations banned under Executive Order 13224. See Daniel Benjamin, Coordinator for Counterterrorism/Ambassador-at-Large, Briefing on U.S. Government's Continued Efforts to Disrupt and Dismantle Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, Washington, DC, 1 September 2010, available at: http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/rm/2010/146597.htm (last visited 3 January 2011).\n\n56 See National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (The 9/11 Commission), The 9/11 Commission Report, 22 July 2004, p. 170, available at: http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/index.htm (last visited 9 March 2011). According to a US Justice Department brief on the subject, Al-Fadl ‘understood from conversations with Bin Laden and others in al Qaeda that the charities would receive funds that could be withdrawn in cash and a portion of the money used for legitimate relief purposes and another portion diverted for al Qaeda operations. The money for al Qaeda operations would nevertheless be listed in the charities’ books as expenses for building mosques or schools or feeding the poor or the needy'. United States District Court Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, United States of America v. Enaam M. Arnaout, Government's Evidentiary Proffer Supporting the Admissibility of Co-Conspirator Statements, Case No. 02 CR 892, 31 January 2003 p. 25. Standing orders were left by bin Laden to keep all transactions involving the charitable groups in cash only; by this method, these NGOs were manipulated as a secret laundry to make Al Qaeda's financial network virtually invisible. The charities would then create false documentation for the benefit of unwary donors, purportedly showing that the money had actually been spent on orphans or starving refugees. According to some former employees of these organizations, more than 50% of their total funding was secretly diverted directly to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. 9/11 Commission Report, p. 171."
