        "meta_description": "In 1994, the Lady Health Workers (LHWs) Programme was established in Pakistan to increase access to essential primary care services and support health systems at the household and community levels. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province in northern Pakistan, eye care is among the many unmet needs that LHWs were trained to address, including screening and referral of people with eye conditions to health facilities. However, despite an increase in referrals by LHWs, compliance with referrals in KPK has been very low. We explored the role of LHWs in patient referral and the barriers to patient compliance with referrals. Qualitative methodology was adopted. Between April and June 2019, we conducted eight focus group discussions and nine in-depth interviews with 73 participants including patients, LHWs and their supervisors, district managers and other stakeholders. Data were analysed thematically using NVivo software version 12. LHWs have a broad understanding of basic health care and are responsible for a wide range of activities at the community level. LHWs felt that the training in primary eye care had equipped them with the skills to identify and refer eye patients. However, they reported that access to care was hampered when referred patients reached hospitals, where disorganised services and poor quality of care discouraged uptake of referrals. LHWs felt that this had a negative impact on their credibility and on the trust and respect they received from the community, which, coupled with low eye health awareness, influenced patients’ decisions about whether to comply with a referral. There was a lack of trust in the health care services provided by public sector hospitals. Poverty, deep-rooted gender inequities and transportation were the other reported main drivers of non-adherence to referrals. Results from this study have shown that the training of LHWs in eye care was well received. However, training alone is not enough and does not result in improved access for patients to specialist services if other parts of the health system are not strengthened. Pathways for referrals should be agreed and explicitly communicated to both the health care providers and the patients.",

        "text": "Participant characteristics are described in Table 1. Among 73 participants who agreed to take part in the study, 52 were women and 21 were men. Thirty-two participants were LHWs; 35 were patients and six were government officials or healthcare managers. Among 35 patients interviewed, 17 were women and 18 were men.\n\nThe findings that emerged from the interviews are organised in two overarching themes: (i) integration of LHWs in the eye health workforce, and (ii) patient health-seeking behaviour and barriers to referral uptake. The first theme describes the nature of the training and the health system context in which LHWs are being deployed. The second theme captures a range of factors affecting the pathways through which patients access specialist eye care services.\n\nIntegration of LHWs in the eye health workforce\n\nContent and scope of training\n\nLady health workers and their supervisors described the training they had received as impactful and transformational for their practice. Prior to the training, LHWs could only listen to the complaints of people with eye issues; they were unable to take any action. The training had improved their knowledge and skills and they could now identify eye conditions and either manage the minor ones at the community level or refer patients to the hospital. As one LHW explained:\n\n“…[they] explained [during the training] different parts of the eye, symptoms of different diseases … and what can be done before the patient is referred to the doctor. It was also explained how to … diagnose an issue, how to clean... [the eye] and how to bandage it, if required. The use of Polyfax [eye ointment] was also explained.” [Lady Health Worker 08, Swabi]\n\nAnother LHW said:\n\n“I learnt about … the eyelid, when children rub their eyes, eye lids get damaged, since they are very sensitive. We also learnt different methods for its management.” [Lady Health Worker 22, Mansehra]\n\nLHWs also said that they had been introduced to a general signs and symptoms’ checklist for the detection of cataracts and taught that cases should be treated immediately. They further explained that they often observed patients delaying seeking treatment for cataracts, but the training had equipped them with the skills to talk to the patients and encourage them to seek treatment as a matter of urgency.\n\nA number of LHWs, however, said that during the training, they had limited opportunities to share their experiences, clarify project expectations or learn from each other. Some LHWs also felt that their supervisors trained as master trainers lacked direct experience of eye care programming and could not adapt the content of the training to the LHWs’ working environment in the community. In the words of one LHW:\n\n“Madam there is a difference of learning from a trained professional doctor and a LHS. An eye doctor has more experience and can guide us better. We would want an eye specialist to educate us … a LHS tells us the management of the problem whereas a doctor would tell us the treatment … LHS tells what to suggest, doctor will tell what to do. We believe a doctor can guide us better step by step. … The message does not remain the same when it rotates among different people. A direct source and an indirect source [of information] are two different things.” [Lady Health Worker 04, Mansehra]\n\nTwo, male senior managers, on the other hand, felt that LHSs were best placed to train LHWs. They saw LHWs as people with limited education, which in their opinion, made it difficult for LHWs to follow or benefit from a training by medical doctors. They argued that although doctors were best placed to explain the nature of different eye diseases and treatments, they were not good trainers for people with minimal education (eight to ten years of schooling in the case of LHWs).\n\nA key issue highlighted by all the LHWs interviewed was refresher courses. LHWs recommended that the refresher training for eye care should be carried out on a regular basis in the same way as the refresher training for other conditions managed by LHWs:\n\n“We get refresher trainings for other disease programmes … [every] 6 months to 2 years. Knowledge is updated, motivation is enhanced. [We] are learning new things and get involved in the field level activities. It is a good way of reminding [us of] our duties.” [Lady Health Worker 11, Swabi]\n\nLHWs recommended that the refresher courses should cover the topic of compliance with referrals because at present LHWs were trained to refer patients but not to ensure referral uptake. They also wanted more information about the adverse consequences of poor eye health or untreated eye conditions. They explained that the training covered well various eye diseases and how to prevent them but paid little attention to the impact of non-compliance with treatment.\n\nIt was further explained that the standard refresher courses were supported by the national LHWs programme and carried out by district health offices whenever there was a new campaign related to the areas covered by LHWs. These refresher trainings were paid for by individual disease control programmes as there was no central pot of funds to support the training. Although the primary eye care module was included in the LHW curriculum, the new knowledge would be difficult to maintain without the fully funded refresher courses.\n\nAvailability of equipment and supplies\n\nFollowing the training, all LHWs were given a PEC kit, which included a PEC manual, an E card to test visual acuity, a measuring tape, a flashlight or a torch with batteries, bandages, eye ointment and referral slips. There were two types of vision testing charts available to the LHWs, a small chart to carry with them in the community and a large chart to use in their office/house. The small (3-m) chart was provided by the project; the large (6-m) chart was provided in some districts by the national programme for the prevention of blindness.\n\nMost LHWs found the PEC manual practical and useful for the assessment of eye health issues at the community level and specifically, identification of people with uncorrected refractive errors (UREs):\n\n“When we have this book [primary eye care manual] with us, then we compare different conditions with those mentioned in the book and can guide people properly... If there is something that we can deal with, then we take care of it. Otherwise we refer them for a proper treatment.” [Lady Health Worker 04, Mansehra]\n\nSeveral LHWs, however, said that they had not used their PEC kit for at least 2 years; and some kept their kits unopened as they had never used them. There was no explanation during the interviews with the LHWs why this was the case, but the district managers interviewed attributed it to the lack of clarity about the LHWs’ role and what was expected from them, which led to the reluctance of some LHWs to carry out eye care services.\n\nThe LHWs who had used their kits complained about the shortage of referral slips, flashlights/torches, batteries, eye medicines and pads. In some kits received during the training, the flashlight was missing or damaged. The consumables were difficult to replace, as the project had provided them to the LHWs only once at the beginning of the project and in limited quantity. LHWs suggested that the procurement of eye care consumables should be integrated within the LHW programme procurement systems to ensure an uninterrupted supply.\n\nApplication of new knowledge and skills in practice\n\nWhile most LHWs described the new knowledge and skills they had acquired during the training, only a few referred to the application of these in practice. Although many LHWs were generally happy about the new opportunities to provide eye related services, most of them paid more attention to other duties and health issues, i.e., maternal and child health or polio eradication campaigns because these were the areas prioritised by the government.\n\nFor those who shared their experiences, there were some apparent tensions between the desire of LHWs to identify and treat minor eye issues and the need for referrals to the upper-level facilities. Some LHWs for example, wanted to be supplied with basic consumables and drugs to manage minor eye cases in the community. Others, however, referred all patients irrespective of how minor their condition was:\n\n“Previously we were not sending this high number of patients to the hospital. After the training, we refer most … people to the hospital, even patients with minor problems are being referred.” [Lady Health Worker 05, Mansehra]\n\nAt the community level, the majority of community members praised LHWs for their work in maternal and child health and polio eradication. Their work in eye health, however, raised doubts because eye health was thought to be complex and some people were hesitant as to whether LHWs were competent enough to correctly identify, manage or refer patients with eye diseases.\n\nReferral process\n\nAfter the training, all LHWs were provided with referral slips, which they were explicitly instructed to issue to all individuals with vision or eye health problems. The referrals could be made to public or private not-for-profit facilities at the primary and secondary levels. Each referral slip contained a serial number and space to enter the date of the referral, name of the patient, sex, address and contact number of the patient, the type of eye problem identified, name of the referring LHW and the referral facility. There were three copies of each referral slip, one for the patient, one for the health facility and one for the LHW. Each LHW maintained the record of the patients referred.\n\nThe key concern expressed by the LHWs during the interviews was that their referral slip was not recognised or accepted by many facilities they referred patients to. Patients who had been referred and had visited a hospital explained how the hospital staff simply discarded their referral slip. LHWs felt that some hospital staff had no respect for LHWs and the patients they referred. They also felt that this type of behaviour damaged their reputation and the trust community members had in their work. Many found it demotivating. This is how one LHW explained her frustration:\n\n“[…] they would put our referral … into the dust bin... Patients do not feel good when our referrals …are put into the dust bin before their eyes...” [Lady Health Worker 20, Swabi]\n\nSimilar views were shared by a lady health supervisor:\n\n“They do not give any importance to the referral slip; many times, our workers accompany their patients, but they [the hospital] say that we do not need this piece of paper.” [Lady Health Supervisor]\n\nLHWs felt that to change the situation, the project had to talk to the referral hospitals as well as to a partner not-for-profit eye hospital, whose staff would sign the referral slips on behalf of the LHWs to make them more legitimate.\n\nAbout half of the LHWs further reported that they had believed that the patients referred by them would get some privileges at the hospital, for example that they would be prioritised in the hospital queue. They felt that as LHWs were highly respected in their communities, their referral slip would carry a special value (or “power”) at the secondary-level facility. Patients referred by the LHWs also had these impressions. However, when they visited a hospital, they did not receive any special privileges. They had to wait in a queue in the same way as any other patient. For some this was disappointing and discouraging. Some patients, notably women who had waited an entire day in the queue, shared their frustrations with other community members and discouraged them from taking up LHWs’ referrals. It was unclear from the interviews whether the expectations of special treatment by hospitals were due to past experience with other disease programmes, the role the LHWs played in the communities or because their eye care work was supported by an international development project. However, given the existing health system and social hierarchies, it seems unlikely that LHWs would expect preferential treatment for their referrals solely based on their status in the community.\n\nRemuneration and working conditions\n\nManagers at the district level described the role of LHWs as a ‘bridge’ linking patients with health care facilities. They praised LHWs for their commitment and hard work, where they had to move from house to house daily:\n\n“LHWs are such an asset that we can utilise them anywhere. They help us in campaigns, different problems of the eye, polio, in everything.” [Manager at the district, Mansehra]\n\nHowever, study participants also recognised that the LHWs’ capacities were stretched; they were often overburdened and overworked. Most LHWs felt that any health problem in the community was ‘dumped’ on them and the same fixed number of LHWs was expected to do them all with no additional compensation or operational support.\n\n“[…] what is Rs 18,000 [US $112] per month and we remain in the field till late; and when we return home, it takes us many more hours to prepare the report and then people would come to our homes for check-ups, examinations. So, we have long hours of working and look at what we get.” [Lady Health Worker 30, Swabi]\n\nSome LHWs argued that the eye care programme increased their paperwork and required additional visits to the villages to remind people about hospital referrals. Some said that the monitoring visits organised specifically by the project to boost the uptake of referrals was particularly stressful for them.\n\nMany LHWs expressed frustrations about their fixed salaries with no monetary or non-monetary compensation for additional programmes, such as eye care. In addition, their standard salary was often delayed with no communication or explanation of the reasons. As a result, they had to find other ways to feed their families and, in these circumstances, they could not do the extra visits to the patients to encourage them to take up referrals. There were also frustrations about hard working conditions and inability to receive medical supplies or replace damaged kits used in eye care.\n\nPatients’ health-seeking behaviour and barriers to referral uptake\n\nExperience and knowledge of eye health\n\nOne of the main drivers of patient health-seeking behaviour was their perception of eye health problems. About half of the participants believed that minor issues were self-limiting or could be treated at home. Many preferred to wait and would only go to the hospital when the situation got worse. Women in particular prioritised the welfare of their family over their own eye health, which they thought was the best way to preserve respectability in the community:\n\n“I couldn’t go (to the hospital) because of the household chores...I did not have time.. who would respect a woman who does not prioritise the welfare of her children...” [Patient, Female, Non-adherent to Referral, Mansehra]\n\nPoor eyesight was perceived as part of the ageing process and many older people simply tried to adjust their lifestyle to accommodate visual impairments. For example, they tried to work in the daylight, read the Quran with large font and avoid activities involving near vision. Participants with poor vision tried to accommodate their impairment, usually until they had lost the ability to recognise their family members or faces. Often it was at this point that they would seek help. Even LHWs and LHSs themselves believed many eye-related problems were minor and could be addressed at any time:\n\n“…I know I have weak eyesight and I will get it checked [but] not today … after a few days. What is the worst that could happen? I would get to wear glasses. That is fine. This is the thinking that we people have, that we won’t be greatly affected by something so minor.” [Lady Health Supervisor]\n\nIt was also reported that patients had little knowledge of the adverse consequences of delaying treatment, which contributed to the feeling that eye care was not a serious matter. Several participants emphasised a need for repeated messages about the risks of not attending eye examinations and referrals:\n\n“… they [LHWs] should make people understand, which they don’t do … Few people … care for themselves and there are many who don’t. That is not an issue for them. If [LHWs] provide awareness that this may lead to blindness and you may become disabled, then one would care.” [Patient, Male, Non-adherent to Referral, Mansehra]\n\nFinancial constraints\n\nOne of the key factors mentioned during the interviews with both patients and LHWs was the lack of financial resources to cover the costs of specialist eye care services and transport. This was, unsurprisingly, the reason for not taking up the referrals for most female patients. Another important factor was the lack of information about costs and services at the referral facilities. Many patients did not know what to expect at the secondary level hospitals. Some had had bad experiences in the past, including being turned away because they could not pay for medicines or surgical procedures. Patients explained that many of them were small-scale farmers, small-scale shopkeepers, daily wage earners and casual labourers and they could not afford fees charged by the hospitals coupled with the loss of their wages:\n\n“You know that if you came here [to the hospital], expenses are almost Rs1,000–1,200 and the loss of daily wages is 1,000 as well. So, the cumulative loss is more, which is unbearable for a person working on daily wages - how to make bread at home?” [Patient, Male, Non-adherent to Referral, Mansehra]\n\nAs a result, the only way to address an eye problem for many patients was to use home – potentially harmful – remedies. For example, the use of surma, kagal and arqu-e gulab [which is essentially rose water] was frequently mentioned during the interviews as remedies to keep the eyes healthy and to treat eye allergies.\n\nMost LHWs and LHSs themselves were unaware of how eye care hospitals worked: many had never visited an eye care department and did not know how much time patients needed for their referral or how much money the hospitals would charge:\n\n“… are there any charges in the DHQ [district hospital]?... I have no clue about their charges.” [Lady Health Supervisor]\n\nGiven that the intention was to increase referrals and their uptake, not informing LHWs about such crucial service delivery details at the hospitals appears to have been a significant oversight of the training.\n\nLack of trust in public sector hospitals\n\nSeveral patients said that they did not trust the quality of services provided in public hospitals. Many had a view that eye surgeries carried out in a government hospital were of poor quality and that patients could go blind after the surgery in these public facilities, as one patient explained:\n\n“We have heard that they [public hospitals] did not operate successfully, people turned blind. Government hospitals take patients eyes out and patients become blind. Therefore, we avoid going to the government hospital.” [Patient, Female, Non-adherent, Mansehra]\n\nAnother patient expressed similar views:\n\n“People these days visit private hospitals more frequently. Anyone who is doing better moneywise prefers private hospitals because they take better care of patients in private hospitals” [Patient, Female, Adherent to referral, Swabi]\n\nSome patients had fears of public hospitals irrespective of whether they personally had visited them or not. It seemed that some patients were more driven by their expectations of poor services rather than the actual experiences of these services:\n\n“… I got an accident at Karachi and … I had to bear 3–4 lakh. [US $1,875–2,500] in medical costs … If I go to Civil or Jinnah hospitals [public sector hospitals] they would have amputated my arm, because they do not have too much time. I got an operation [in a private hospital] for five hours; they removed body tissues from my leg and applied on the arm.” [Patient, Male, Non-adherent to referral, Mansehra]\n\nA number of patients said that they preferred visiting private hospitals because they could get all services in one place. Government hospitals were often lacking diagnostic equipment or laboratory services and had to send patients to private facilities, as one female patient explained:\n\n“… at the [public sector] hospital, they send you to Major Sb [a retired military doctor running a private clinic], so it is better to go to Major directly.” [Patient, Female, Non-adherent to referral, Mansehra]\n\nPatients further reported that public sector hospitals did not provide medicines, eyeglasses and they were not sure about the availability of doctors. At private not-for-profit hospitals, patients felt that doctors and medicines were always available; surgeries were successful and free and even lenses were provided free for certain categories of vulnerable patients. LHWs also noted that some government hospital staff had unhelpful attitudes, many hospitals were busy and lacking essential personnel, and patients – particularly old and vulnerable patients – did not feel comfortable in such facilities:\n\n“It is the attitude of staff and doctors. We feel that facilities … [should] test vision, prescribe medicines there and if he or she needs an operation, the doctor should properly guide them and refer them … and then at the … hospitals, these referred patients [should] be treated humanely and with good manners.” [Lady Health Worker, 15 Swabi]\n\nDistance to hospitals and difficulties in travel\n\nAnother challenge reported by a number of patients was the distance to the health care facilities. Many patients found it very difficult to cover long distances to reach the main cities with health care facilities. This was particularly frequently reported in Mansehra district, where public hospitals were located in the city centre. They were difficult to reach for patients coming from far away areas with challenging terrain.\n\nTravel was a particular challenge for older female patients, who had to find time, financial resources for themselves and a companion and get permission from their husbands or sons, who often did not take women’s health issues seriously, as one woman explained:\n\n“Sir, they [husbands] say as it is not a serious disease we are not permitted [to travel]. If they are not travelling with us, obviously alone women cannot go.” [Lady Health Worker 29, Mansehra]\n\nThis study set out to assess the role of LHWs in improving access to eye health services in remote locations of Pakistan and specifically the uptake of referrals by patients with eye diseases. The study also explored the main drivers of patients’ eye health-seeking behaviour and barriers to eye care services. The study provides insights into the experiences of LHWs as the first points of contact for eye health. The findings draw on previous research on the nature and role of community health systems in facilitating the access to health care services for disadvantaged populations [19,20,21,22].\n\nThere are a number of key findings that have policy and programme implications. Overall, results show that LHWs and their supervisors were enthusiastic about the opportunities to be trained in primary eye care and be involved in providing eye care services to the underserved populations in their communities. However, similar to other research [23], our study demonstrates that training of primary eye care workers alone is not sufficient to increase patients’ access to specialist services. There are other elements of the health system that need to be adjusted to make the integration of the new function within the system a success. For example, in this context, the procurement of the LHW programme has not been changed to integrate the supply of basic ophthalmic equipment, such as torches or simple medicines and eye drops that are highly demanded by community members. The trained LHWs received their eye care kits only once, immediately after the training, and there was no provision for re-stocking or replacing the supplies. Similar problems were highlighted by a study in Tanzania, where primary health care workers were trained in eye care but the primary care facilities, where they worked, made no provisions for basic medicines in their procurement systems [23]. As a result, many stopped delivering eye care services, when their torches got broken or when they ran out of eye drops.\n\nThe training itself was generally well received, although there are questions as to whether the model of training of trainers (who themselves are not familiar with eye care) over three days followed by a one-day training for LHWs is sufficient to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills. The presence of an eye care specialist during the LHW training by their supervisors could potentially improve their understanding of eye care and particularly how secondary eye care facilities work. Another aspect of the training programme that will require attention is the lack of refresher courses for LHWs to update their knowledge and share their experiences with others. On the positive side, training of LHWs by their supervisors has possibly ensured a good level of supervision of their eye care work. In contrast to other studies [23, 24], the issue of lack of supervision has not been raised in this project. This seemingly effective approach can be replicated in other programmes, which involve primary or community level workers in eye care.\n\nAnother important factor raised during the interviews was the lack of clarity about LHWs’ responsibilities and what was expected from them. It seems that the LHWs were confused whether they were expected to treat patients with minor illnesses in the community or they were expected to refer everyone with an eye issue irrespective of how minor it was. It seems that the LHWs interviewed had different opinions about it and their practice varied. In this study we did not review any formal policies on the role of LHWs in eye care or what their responsibilities and competencies were. If the LHW programme continues to integrate the eye care function and is to be rolled out across the country, it would be critical to clearly articulate what LHWs could and could not do in eye care. LHWs need to be properly informed about how hospitals actually function in terms of structures and costs. It is also important that they are sufficiently trained to distinguish between the conditions that do and do not require a referral because a large number of referred patients with minor or self-limiting conditions can overwhelm already overcrowded and overstretched eye care hospitals [25, 26]. It can also undermine patients’ trust in the LHW programme, as patients will be unnecessarily travelling to faraway and expensive facilities.\n\nIt is also interesting that this programme was introduced in districts with relatively high coverage for cataract services, which means that patients do get to hospitals for at least serious sight threatening conditions such as cataracts. The problem highlighted in the recent RAABs was gender inequities, particularly in Swabi with a significantly lower cataract coverage among women. In this context one would expect that the primary purpose of the LHW’s role would be to identify female patients with cataracts and help them to receive the service. But this potential focus on women did not come out strongly in the interviews and it remains unclear whether LHWs have been specifically encouraged to find women with cataracts or not.\n\nA number of factors affected the uptake of referrals by LHWs in this project. First, although the role of LHWs in maternal and child health and polio eradication campaigns has been well appreciated by their communities, some community members had doubts whether LHWs can be as effective in addressing more complex issues, such as eye diseases. It is possible, therefore, that some patients did not take seriously the LHWs’ advice to go to distant secondary facilities, where they will be expected to pay and wait for long hours. Second, there seemed to be a misunderstanding of what a LHW’s referral means for hospital services. It appears that both the LHWs and the patients expected a ‘special’ treatment at the hospital for those referred by the LHWs. It remains unclear whether this information was wrongly communicated to the LHWs during the training or it was their own interpretation of what their referral slip meant. It appears that many secondary-level providers were unaware of the LHW programme and their referrals. LHWs spent considerable time completing the slips, which ultimately did not have a required level of authority [27, 28]. As advocated by several participants in this study, improved engagement and communication between LHWs and hospital-based healthcare providers will be necessary to ensure that the referral pathways work effectively, and the referred patients receive the care they need.\n\nIn addition, many barriers to the uptake of referrals identified in this study were system-related and could not be addressed by the LHW referral programme alone. Similar to other rural contexts in South Asia [29, 30], we identified user fees and long distances to the facilities as major factors affecting patients’ decision-making. Also, in this specific context, the perceived poor quality and dissatisfaction with services in government hospitals were a major barrier. This finding is consistent with previous research that showed that overcrowded facilities with busy and unfriendly staff created significant barriers to the uptake of hospital referrals [25, 31].\n\nTwo types of barriers, however, could be potentially addressed by this programme: the lack of information about eye diseases and eye care services and the constraints faced by women who have to negotiate their travel and finances with their husbands or sons. Gender inequities in particular is an area where LHWs can be potentially effective [32] and their role in addressing these should be strengthened in future programmes. Gender inequities are deeply entrenched in Pakistan. The underlying gender structures which offer men numerous material benefits and decision-making authority contribute to women’s relatively lower uptake of health services [30, 33]. Previous studies in the country have shown that even those who have some source of income to facilitate travel to the hospital often choose not to – reflecting the values and ideals of being a good wife and putting the family first [33,34,35]. The government is aware of the problem and recognises that gender inequity is a key determinant of negative health outcomes among women [34, 36]. Indeed, the government recognises that more innovative service delivery models are required to improve women’s access to healthcare services [25, 36] but progress towards addressing the problem has been slow [37]. Using LHWs as case finders to identify women with cataracts and organising services closer to the communities, where women do not have to travel far, could be potentially an effective strategy to increase coverage with cataract services among women in these districts.\n\nFinally, our findings suggest that the eye care programme in KPK increased pressures on LHWs who already had heavy workloads and grievances, such as late pay, to deal with. While training and deploying LHWs to identify and refer patients appeared to be generally acceptable, it also represented a significant challenge to the community health system. Some LHWs considered the additional responsibility to be a burden, which did not come with additional pay or support. In resource-limited contexts with overstretched and often inefficient health systems, adding more responsibilities to the workload of a fixed number of overworked and underpaid community workers should be very carefully managed, as this could potentially do more harm than good [12, 38].\n\nThis study has a number of limitations. First, the study was conducted in only two purposively selected districts of KPK province, with a small sample of patients, LHWs and managers, and do not necessarily reflect the experiences of other patients and health care providers outside the two districts. The range of patients, LHW and manager experiences may not be exhaustive when considering referral pathways and experiences in other parts of the province or the country. Second, while we selected participants to ensure that the different community health system configurations were included, we do not know to what extent the included LHWs and their supervisors are representative of others in the same district. Interviews with other community health workers and observations of everyday practice of facility-based health care providers may have revealed more nuanced health system dynamics and thereby identified other factors influencing the organisation, delivery and uptake of eye care services. A third limitation is that although we used a team of three researchers to independently code the transcripts, resources were not available to organize member check workshops with participants to review and comment on our analysis and interpretation of the data. Such engagement with participants would have provided a further check on the accuracy of our coding process and interpretation."
