        "text": "The following descriptive list of terrorist groups is presented in two sections. The first section lists the groups that currently are designated by the Secretary of State as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs), pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality act, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. The designations carry legal consequences:\n\nIt is unlawful to provide funds or other material support to a designated FTO.\n\nRepresentatives and certain members of a designated FTO can be denied visas or excluded from the United States.\n\nU.S. financial institutions must block funds of designated FTOs and their agents and must report the blockage to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n\nThe second section includes other terrorist groups that were active during 1999. Terrorist groups whose activities were limited in scope in 1999 are not included.\n\nI. Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (October 1999)\n\nAbu Nidal organization (ANO)\n\na.k.a. Fatah Revolutionary Council, Arab Revolutionary Brigades, Black September, and Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Muslims\n\nDescription\n\nInternational terrorist organization led by Sabri al-Banna. Split from PLO in 1974. Made up of various functional committees, including political, military, and financial.\n\nActivities\n\nHas carried out terrorist attacks in 20 countries, killing or injuring almost 900 persons. Targets include the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Israel, moderate Palestinians, the PLO, and various Arab countries. Major attacks included the Rome and Vienna airports in December 1985, the Neve Shalom synagogue in Istanbul and the Pan Am flight 73 hijacking in Karachi in September 1986, and the City of Poros day-excursion ship attack in Greece in July 1988. Suspected of assassinating PLO deputy chief Abu Iyad and PLO security chief Abu Hul in Tunis in January 1991. ANO assassinated a Jordanian diplomat in Lebanon in January 1994 and has been linked to the killing of the PLO representative there. Has not attacked Western targets since the late 1980s.\n\nStrength\n\nA few hundred plus limited overseas support structure.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nAl-Banna relocated to Iraq in December 1998, where the group maintains a presence. Has an operational presence in Lebanon in the Bekaa Valley and several Palestinian refugee camps in coastal areas of Lebanon. Also has a limited presence in Sudan and Syria, among others, although financial problems and internal disorganization have reduced the group's activities and capabilities. Authorities shut down the ANO's operations in Libya and Egypt in 1999. Has demonstrated ability to operate over wide area, including the Middle East, Asia, and Europe.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nHas received considerable support, including safehaven, training, logistic assistance, and financial aid from Iraq, Libya, and Syria (until 1987), in addition to close support for selected operations.\n\nAbu Sayyaf Group (ASG)\n\nDescription\n\nThe ASG is the smallest and most radical of the Islamic separatist groups operating in the southern Philippines. Some ASG members have studied or worked in the Middle East and developed ties to mujahidin while fighting and training in Afghanistan. The group split from the Moro National Liberation Front in 1991 under the leadership of Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani, who was killed in a clash with Philippine police on 18 December 1998. The ASG still is working to fill a leadership void resulting from his death, although press reports place his younger brother, Khadafi Janjalani, as head of the group's operations in the Basilan Province.\n\nActivities\n\nUses bombs, assassinations, kidnappings, and extortion payments to promote an independent Islamic state in western Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, areas in the southern Philippines heavily populated by Muslims. Raided the town of Ipil in Mindanao in April 1995, the group's first large-scale action. Suspected of several small-scale bombings and kidnappings in 1999.\n\nStrength\n\nUnknown but believed to have about 200 fighters.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nThe ASG operates in the southern Philippines with members occasionally traveling to Manila.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nProbably receives support from Islamic extremists in the Middle East and South Asia.\n\nal-Jihad (see under J)\n\nArmed Islamic Group (GIA)\n\nDescription\n\nAn Islamic extremist group, the GIA aims to overthrow the secular Algerian regime and replace it with an Islamic state. The GIA began its violent activities in early 1992 after Algiers voided the victory of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS)--the largest Islamic party--in the first round of legislative elections in December 1991.\n\nActivities\n\nFrequent attacks against civilians, journalists, and foreign residents. In the last several years the GIA has conducted a terrorist campaign of civilian massacres, sometimes wiping out entire villages in its area of operations and frequently killing hundreds of civilians. Since announcing its terrorist campaign against foreigners living in Algeria in September 1993, the GIA has killed more than 100 expatriate men and women--mostly Europeans--in the country. Uses assassinations and bombings, including car bombs, and it is known to favor kidnapping victims and slitting their throats. The GIA hijacked an Air France flight to Algiers in December 1994. In late 1999 several GIA members were convicted by a French court for conducting a series of bombings in France in 1995.\n\nStrength\n\nUnknown, probably several hundred to several thousand.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nAlgeria.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nAlgerian expatriates and GIA members abroad, many of whom reside in Western Europe, provide some financial and logistic support. In addition, the Algerian Government has accused Iran and Sudan of supporting Algerian extremists and severed diplomatic relations with Iran in March 1993.\n\nAum Supreme Truth (Aum)\n\na.k.a. Aum Shinrikyo\n\nDescription\n\nA cult established in 1987 by Shoko Asahara, Aum aims to take over Japan and then the world. Approved as a religious entity in 1989 under Japanese law, the group ran candidates in a Japanese parliamentary election in 1990. Over time, the cult began to emphasize the imminence of the end of the world and stated that the United States would initiate \"Armageddon\" by starting World War III with Japan. The Japanese Government revoked its recognition of Aum as a religious organization in October 1995, but in 1997 a government panel decided not to invoke the Anti-Subversive Law against the group, which would have outlawed the cult.\n\nActivities\n\nOn 20 March 1995, Aum members simultaneously released the chemical nerve agent sarin on several Tokyo subway trains, killing 12 persons and injuring up to 6,000. The group was responsible for other mysterious chemical incidents in Japan in 1994. Its efforts to conduct attacks using biological agents have been unsuccessful. Japanese police arrested Asahara in May 1995, and he remained on trial facing 17 counts of murder at the end of 1999. From 1997 to late 1999 the cult recruited new members, built up a profitable commercial business, and bought several properties. In September the cult declared it would cease most of its activities and in December apologized for the sarin attack. The cult maintains an Internet home page, but shut down almost all of its links following these announcements.\n\nStrength\n\nThe Aum's current membership is estimated at 1,500 to 2,000 persons. At the time of the Tokyo subway attack, the group claimed to have 9,000 members in Japan and up to 40,000 worldwide.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nThe Aum is known to operated only in Japan, but it may have an unknown number of residual followers in Russia.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nNone.\n\nBasque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA)\n\na.k.a Euzkadi Ta Askatasuna\n\nDescription\n\nFounded in 1959 with the aim of establishing an independent homeland based on Marxist principles in the northern Spanish Provinces of Vizcaya, Guipuzcoa, Alava, and Navarra and the southwestern French Provinces of Labourd, Basse-Navarra, and Soule.\n\nActivities\n\nPrimarily bombings and assassinations of Spanish Government officials, especially security and military forces, politicians, and judicial figures. In response to French operations against the group, ETA also has targeted French interests. ETA finances its activities through kidnappings, robberies, and extortion. The group has killed more than 800 persons since it began lethal attacks in the early 1960s. ETA was responsible for murdering six persons in 1998 but did not carry out any known killings in 1999. In late November, ETA broke the \"unilateral and indefinite\" cease-fire it had held since 16 September 1998.\n\nStrength\n\nUnknown; may have hundreds of members, plus supporters.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nOperates primarily in the Basque autonomous regions of northern Spain and southwestern France, but also has bombed Spanish and French interests elsewhere.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nHas received training at various times in the past in Libya, Lebanon, and Nicaragua. Some ETA members allegedly have received sanctuary in Cuba. Also appears to have ties to the Irish Republican Army through the two groups' legal political wings.\n\nDevrimci Sol (Revolutionary Left)\n\na.k.a. Dev Sol (see Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front, DHKP/C)\n\nELA (see Revolutionary People's Struggle)\n\nELN (see National Liberation Army)\n\nETA (see Basque Fatherland and Liberty)\n\nFARC (see Revolutionary Armed forces of Colombia)\n\nAl-Gama'at al-Islamiyya (Islamic Group, IG)\n\nDescription\n\nEgypt's largest militant group, active since the late 1970s; appears to be loosely organized. Has an external wing with a worldwide presence. The group issued a cease-fire in March 1999 and has not conducted an attack inside Egypt since August 1998. Signed Usama Bin Ladin's fatwa in February 1998 calling for attacks against US civilians but publicly has denied that it supports Bin Ladin. Shaykh Umar Abd al-Rahman is al-Gama'at's preeminent spiritual leader, and the group publicly has threatened to retaliate against US interests for his incarceration. Primary goal is to overthrow the Egyptian Government and replace it with an Islamic state.\n\nActivities\n\nArmed attacks against Egyptian security and other government officials, Coptic Christians, and Egyptian opponents of Islamic extremism. Al-Gama'at has launched attacks on tourists in Egypt since 1992, most notably the attack in November 1997 at Luxor that killed 58 foreign tourists. Also claimed responsibility for the attempt in June 1995 to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Gama'at has never specifically attacked a US citizen or facility but has threatened US interests.\n\nStrength\n\nUnknown, but probably several thousand hardcore members and another several thousand sympathizers.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nOperates mainly in the Al Minya, Asyu't, Qina, and Soha Governorates of southern Egypt. Also appears to have support in Cairo, Alexandria, and other urban locations, particularly among unemployed graduates and students. Has a worldwide presence, including the United Kingdom, Afghanistan, and Austria.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nUnknown. The Egyptian Government believes that Iran, Sudan, and Afghan militant groups support the organization. Also may obtain some funding through various Islamic nongovernmental organizations.\n\nHAMAS (Islamic Resistance Movement)\n\nDescription\n\nFormed in late 1987 as an outgrowth of the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. Various HAMAS elements have used both political and violent means, including terrorism, to pursue the goal of establishing an Islamic Palestinian state in place of Israel. Loosely structured, with some elements working clandestinely and others working openly through mosques and social service institutions to recruit members, raise money, organize activities, and distribute propaganda. HAMAS's strength is concentrated in the Gaza Strip and a few areas of the West Bank. Also has engaged in peaceful political activity, such as running candidates in West Bank Chamber of Commerce elections.\n\nActivities\n\nHAMAS activists, especially those in the Izz el-Din al-Qassam Brigades, have conducted many attacks--including large-scale suicide bombings--against Israeli civilian and military targets. In the early 1990s they also targeted suspected Palestinian collaborators and Fatah rivals.\n\nStrength\n\nUnknown number of hardcore members; tens of thousands of supporters and sympathizers.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nPrimarily the occupied territories, Israel.

Some fundraising and propaganda activity take place in Western Europe and North America.\n\nHarakat ul-Mujahidin (HUM)\n\nDescription\n\nHUM is an Islamic militant group based in Pakistan that operates primarily in Kashmir. Leader Fazlur Rehman Khalil has been linked to Bin Ladin and signed his fatwa in February 1998 calling for attacks on US and Western interests. Operates terrorist training camps in eastern Afghanistan and suffered casualties in the US missile strikes on Bin Ladin-associated training camps in Khowst in August 1998. Fazlur Rehman Khalil subsequently said that HUM would take revenge on the United States.\n\nActivities\n\nHas conducted a number of operations against Indian troops and civilian targets in Kashmir. Linked to the Kashmiri militant group al-Faran that kidnapped five Western tourists in Kashmir in July 1995; one was killed in August 1995, and the other four reportedly were killed in December of the same year.\n\nStrength\n\nHas several thousand armed supporters located in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan, and India's southern Kashmir and Doda regions. Supporters are mostly Pakistanis and Kashmiris, and also include Afghans and Arab veterans of the Afghan war. Uses light and heavy machineguns, assault rifles, mortars, explosives, and rockets.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nBased in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, but members conduct insurgent and terrorist activities primarily in Kashmir. The HUM trains its militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nCollects donations from Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf and Islamic states and from Pakistanis and Kashmiris. The source and amount of HUM's military funding are unknown.\n\nHizballah (Party of God)\n\na.k.a. Islamic Jihad, Revolutionary Justice Organization, Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, and Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine\n\nDescription\n\nRadical Shia group formed in Lebanon; dedicated to creation of Iranian-style Islamic republic in Lebanon and removal of all non-Islamic influences from the area. Strongly anti-West and anti-Israel. Closely allied with, and often directed by, Iran but may have conducted operations that were not approved by Tehran.\n\nActivities\n\nKnown or suspected to have been involved in numerous anti-US terrorist attacks, including the suicide truck bombing of the US Embassy and US Marine barracks in Beirut in October 1983 and the US Embassy annex in Beirut in September 1984. Elements of the group were responsible for the kidnapping and detention of US and other Western hostages in Lebanon. The group also attacked the Israeli Embassy in Argentina in 1992 and is a suspect in the bombing in 1994 of the Israeli cultural center in Buenos Aires.\n\nStrength\n\nSeveral thousand.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nOperates in the Bekaa Valley, the southern suburbs of Beirut, and southern Lebanon. Has established cells in Europe, Africa, South America, North America, and Asia.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nReceives substantial amounts of financial, training, weapons, explosives, political, diplomatic, and organizational aid from Iran and Syria.\n\nIslamic Resistance Movement (see HAMAS)\n\nJapanese Red Army (JRA)\n\na.k.a. Anti-Imperialist International Brigade (AIIB)\n\nDescription\n\nAn international terrorist group formed around 1970 after breaking away from Japanese Communist League-Red Army Faction. Led by Fusako Shigenobu, believed to be in Syrian-garrisoned area of Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. Stated goals are to overthrow Japanese Government and monarchy and help foment world revolution. Organization unclear but may control or at least have ties to Anti-Imperialist International Brigade (AIIB). Also may have links to Antiwar Democratic Front--an overt leftist political organization--inside Japan. Details released following arrest in November 1987 of leader Osamu Maruoka indicate that JRA may be organizing cells in Asian cities, such as Manila and Singapore. Has had close and longstanding relations with Palestinian terrorist groups--based and operating outside Japan--since its inception.\n\nActivities\n\nDuring the 1970s, JRA conducted a series of attacks around the world, including the massacre in 1972 at Lod Airport in Israel, two Japanese airliner hijackings, and an attempted takeover of the US Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. In April 1988, JRA operative Yu Kikumura was arrested with explosives on the New Jersey Turnpike, apparently planning an attack to coincide with the bombing of a USO club in Naples and a suspected JRA operation that killed five, including a US servicewoman. Kikumura was convicted of these charges and is serving a lengthy prison sentence in the United States. In March 1995, Ekita Yukiko, a longtime JRA activist, was arrested in Romania and subsequently deported to Japan. Eight others have been arrested since 1996, but leader Shigenobu remains at large.\n\nStrength\n\nAbout eight hardcore members; undetermined number of sympathizers.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nLocation unknown, but possibly based in Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nUnknown.\n\nal-Jihad\n\na.k.a. Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Jihad Group, Islamic Jihad, Vanguards of Conquest, Talaa' al-Fateh\n\nDescription\n\nEgyptian Islamic extremist group active since the late 1970s. Appears to be divided into two factions: one is based in Afghanistan and is a key player in terrorist financier Usama Bin Ladin's new World Islamic Front and the other--the Vanguards of Conquest (Talaa'al-Fateh)--is led by Ahmad Husayn Agiza. Primary goal is to overthrow the Egyptian Government and replace it with an Islamic state. Increasingly willing to target US interests in Egypt.\n\nActivities\n\nSpecializes in armed attacks against high-level Egyptian Government officials. The original Jihad was responsible for the assassination in 1981 of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Appears to concentrate on high-level, high-profile Egyptian Government officials, including cabinet ministers. Claimed responsibility for the attempted assassinations of Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfi in August 1993 and Prime Minister Atef Sedky in November 1993. Has not conducted an attack inside Egypt since 1993 and has never targeted foreign tourists there. Threatened to retaliate against the United States, however, for its incarceration of Shaykh Umar Abd al-Rahman and, more recently, for the arrests of its members in Albania, Azerbaijan, and the United Kingdom.\n\nStrength\n\nNot known, but probably several thousand hardcore members and another several thousand sympathizers among the various factions.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nOperates in the Cairo area. Has a network outside Egypt, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, and Sudan.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nNot known. The Egyptian Government claims that Iran, Sudan, and militant Islamic groups in Afghanistan--including Usama Bin Ladin--support the Jihad factions. Also may obtain some funding through various Islamic nongovernmental organizations.\n\nKach and Kahane Chai\n\nDescription\n\nStated goal is to restore the biblical state of Israel. Kach (founded by radical Israeli-American rabbi Meir Kahane) and its offshoot Kahane Chai, which means \"Kahane Lives,\" (founded by Meir Kahane's son Binyamin following his father's assassination in the United States) were declared to be terrorist organizations in March 1994 by the Israeli Cabinet under the 1948 Terrorism Law. This followed the groups' statements in support of Dr. Baruch Goldstein's attack in February 1994 on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque--Goldstein was affiliated with Kach--and their verbal attacks on the Israeli Government.\n\nActivities\n\nOrganize protests against the Israeli Government. Harass and threaten Palestinians in Hebron and the West Bank. Have threatened to attack Arabs, Palestinians, and Israeli Government officials. Claimed responsibility for several shootings of West Bank Palestinians that killed four persons and wounded two in 1993.\n\nStrength\n\nUnknown.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nIsrael and West Bank settlements, particularly Qiryat Arba' in Hebron.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nReceive support from sympathizers in the United States and Europe.\n\nKurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)\n\nDescription\n\nEstablished in 1974 as a Marxist-Leninist insurgent group primarily composed of Turkish Kurds. In recent years has moved beyond rural-based insurgent activities to include urban terrorism. Seeks to establish an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, where population is predominantly Kurdish. Turkish authorities captured Chairman Abdullah Ocalan in Kenya in early 1999; after his trial in late June, Turkish State Security Court sentenced him to death. In August, Ocalan announced a \"peace initiative,\" ordering members to refrain from violence and requesting dialogue with Ankara on Kurdish issues.\n\nActivities\n\nPrimary targets are Turkish Government security forces in Turkey but also has been active in Western Europe against Turkish targets. Conducted attacks on Turkish diplomatic and commercial facilities in dozens of West European cities in 1993 and again in spring 1995. In an attempt to damage Turkey's tourist industry, the PKK has bombed tourist sites and hotels and kidnapped foreign tourists.\n\nStrength\n\nApproximately 10,000 to 15,000. Has thousands of sympathizers in Turkey and Europe.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nOperates in Turkey, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nHas received safehaven and modest aid from Syria, Iraq, and Iran. The Syrian Government claims to have expelled the PKK from its territory in October 1998.\n\nLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)\n\nOther known front organizations: World Tamil Association (WTA), World Tamil Movement (WTM), the Federation of Associations of Canadian Tamils (FACT), the Ellalan Force, the Sangillan Force.\n\nDescription\n\nFounded in 1976, the LTTE is the most powerful Tamil group in Sri Lanka and uses overt and illegal methods to raise funds, acquire weapons, and publicize its cause of establishing an independent Tamil state. The LTTE began its armed conflict with the Sri Lankan Government in 1983 and relies on a guerrilla strategy that includes the use of terrorist tactics.\n\nActivities\n\nThe Tigers have integrated a battlefield insurgent strategy with a terrorist program that targets not only key government personnel in the countryside but also senior Sri Lankan political and military leaders in Colombo. Political assassinations and bombings have become commonplace. The LTTE has refrained from targeting Western tourists out of fear that foreign governments would crack down on Tamil expatriates involved in fundraising activities abroad.\n\nStrength\n\nExact strength is unknown, but the LTTE is estimated to have 8,000 to 10,000 armed combatants in Sri Lanka, with a core of trained fighters of approximately 3,000 to 6,000. The LTTE also has a significant overseas support structure for fundraising, weapons procurement, and propaganda activities.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nThe Tigers control most of the northern and eastern coastal areas of Sri Lanka but have conducted operations throughout the island. Headquartered in the Jaffna peninsula, LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran has established an extensive network of checkpoints and informants to keep track of any outsiders who enter the group's area of control. The LTTE prefers to attack vulnerable government facilities, then withdraw before reinforcements arrive.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nThe LTTE's overt organizations support Tamil separatism by lobbying foreign governments and the United Nations. The group also uses its international contacts to procure weapons, communications, and bombmaking equipment. The LTTE exploits large Tamil communities in North America, Europe, and Asia to obtain funds and supplies for its fighters in Sri Lanka. Information obtained since the mid-1980s indicates that some Tamil communities in Europe also are involved in narcotics smuggling. Tamils historically have served as drug couriers moving narcotics into Europe.\n\nMujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MEK or MKO)\n\na.k.a. The National Liberation Army of Iran (NLA, the militant wing of the MEK), the People's Mujahidin of Iran (PMOI), National Council of Resistance (NCR), Muslim Iranian Student's Society (front organization used to garner financial support)\n\nDescription\n\nFormed in the 1960s by the college-educated children of Iranian merchants, the MEK sought to counter what it perceived as excessive Western influence in the Shah's regime. Following a philosophy that mixes Marxism and Islam, has developed into the largest and most active armed Iranian dissident group. Its history is studded with anti-Western activity and, most recently, attacks on the interests of the clerical regime in Iran and abroad.\n\nActivities\n\nWorldwide campaign against the Iranian Government stresses propaganda and occasionally uses terrorist violence. During the 1970s the MEK staged terrorist attacks inside Iran and killed several US military personnel and civilians working on defense projects in Tehran. Supported the takeover in 1979 of the US Embassy in Tehran. In April 1992 conducted attacks on Iranian embassies in 13 different countries, demonstrating the group's ability to mount large-scale operations overseas. Recent attacks in Iran include three explosions in Tehran in June 1998 that killed three persons and the assassination in August 1998 of Asadollah Lajevardi, the former director of the Evin Prison. In April 1999, Brigadier General Ali Sayyad Shirazi, the deputy joint chief of staff of Iran's armed forces, was killed in Tehran by a MEK operative.\n\nStrength\n\nSeveral thousand fighters based in Iraq with an extensive overseas support structure. Most of the fighters are organized in the MEK's National Liberation Army (NLA).\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nIn the 1980s the MEK's leaders were forced by Iranian security forces to flee to France. Most resettled in Iraq by 1987. In the mid-1980s the group did not mount terrorist operations in Iran at a level similar to its activities in the 1970s. In the 1990s, however, the MEK claimed credit for an increasing number of operations in Iran.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nBeyond support from Iraq, the MEK uses front organizations to solicit contributions from expatriate Iranian communities.\n\nMRTA (see Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement)\n\nNational Liberation Army (ELN)--Colombia\n\nDescription\n\nAnti-US insurgent group formed in 1965 by Jesuit priests inspired by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara.

Involved in an insurgent war against the government, but its military capabilities are declining. Annually conducts hundreds of kidnappings for ransom, often targeting foreign employees of large corporations, especially in the petroleum industry. Frequently assaults power infrastructure and has inflicted major damage on pipelines and the electric distribution network.\n\nStrength\n\nApproximately 3,000 to 6,000 armed combatants, mostly in rural and mountainous areas, and an unknown number of active supporters.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nColombia, border regions of Venezuela.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nCuba provides some medical care and political consultation.\n\nThe Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ)\n\nDescription\n\nOriginated among militant Palestinians in the Gaza Strip during the 1970s. Committed to the creation of an Islamic Palestinian state and the destruction of Israel through holy war. Because of its strong support for Israel, the United States has been identified as an enemy of the PIJ, but the group has not specifically conducted attacks against US interests. Also opposes moderate Arab governments that it believes have been tainted by Western secularism.\n\nActivities\n\nHas threatened to retaliate against Israel and the United States for the murder of PIJ leader Fathi Shaqaqi in Malta in October 1995. Conducted suicide bombings against Israeli targets in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Israel. Has threatened to attack US interests in Jordan.\n\nStrength\n\nUnknown.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation\n\nPrimarily Israel and the occupied territories and other parts of the Middle East, including Jordan and Lebanon. Largest faction is based in Syria.\n\nExternal Aid\n\nReceives financial assistance from Iran and limited logistic support assistance from Syria.\n\nPKK (see Kurdistan Workers' Party)\n\nPalestine Liberation Front (PLF)\n\nDescription\n\nBroke away from the PFLP-GC in mid-1970s.
