        "text": "#OnThisDay in 1869, the general meeting of the Sheffield FA was held. (There was no English FA yet, but there were a few regional ones. The largest was the Sheffield FA.) And they made a decision 154 years ago today: The umpires (as referees were then called) are the only judges - and only they have the power to hand out penalties. Norfolk FC had proposed this rule change. Before in football, it was customary for the captains to agree, and only in an emergency to ask the two umpires for help in making a decision. The umpires stood on the sidelines and were elected by the two clubs. Much like seconds in a duel. Want to read more on the development of umpires and referees? I‘ve written an article, but it‘s currently only available in German: How the referee came into the game: https://lnkd.in/eBStJg-h. The Shieffield FA AGM also discussed a proposal from Mackenzie FC to introduce a completely new rule. I have not yet been able to find out what it was. And there was another proposal from Norfolk FC which was also accepted: Only opponents would have to be 5.49 metres away from the ball when taking a free kick, while team-mates would only have to be 2.74 metres away.
