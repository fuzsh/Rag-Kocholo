        "text": "sup. Tan LeRacoon saal | 21.00 Uhr\n\nGOLDEN KANINE vermögen es wie kaum eine andere Band, den Hörer, während sie ihn mit jubilierendem Crescendo mitnehmen, gleichzeitig positiv zu verwirren. In den mitreißendsten Passagen verstecken sich gerne die finstersten Botschaften, da droht Unglück und Seelenpein – und plötzlich, wenn der musikalische Aplomb in weniger nachdrückliche, ruhigere Gefilde übergeht, so dass man textlich auf jedwedes Tränental vorbereitet ist, plötzlich kommen da fast fröhliche Silben aus ihren Mündern und Kehlen. Man fiebert mit ihnen, man folgt ihren Schlenkern zwischen lauthalsiger Dynamik und verzweifelter Nabelschau. Das Resultat ist eine einzige, mitreißende Versuchung.\n\nGolden Kanine Announces Return to the Stage After Seven-Year Hiatus. Indie folk sensation Golden Kanine has officially broken their six-year silence and is set to embark on an eagerly awaited tour. The Swedish/German six-piece, renowned for their emotionally charged compositions and unique blend of folk and indie elements, is gearing up to enchant audiences once again with their captivating live performances. Having last graced the stage in 2018, Golden Kanine surprised fans with a prolonged hiatus that left many wondering about the future of the band. During this break, the members of Golden Kanine took time to explore individual musical endeavors and personal growth, contributing to the anticipation surrounding their imminent return. Golden Kanine’s decision to break their silence and hit the road again comes as exciting news for fans who have patiently awaited their return. The upcoming tour promises to be a celebration of the band’s discography, featuring both beloved classics and, perhaps, some long-awaited new material.\n\nTAN LERACOON\n\nSupport for swedish Indie Folk band Golden Kanine. Tanju Boerue’s alter ego Tan LeRacoon and his vision of genrebreaking Rock n Roll is multilayered, complex and… unpredictable.Releases attest an anarchist fighting spirit, diversity as matter of course and the will to irritate.Shows, sometimes with a 9-headed band including a brass section or two drummers, bedazzled,more often thrilled, always moved between genres. Singles varied between funked up rock n roll,Max’s Kansas City meets Studio 54, but all nervous (She Said She’s Sad), pure metal (sic!) darkness(Mary The Rhino), to the extended version of I.G.S. (Instant Gratification Society), the last album’ssecret weapon with its beautiful guitar work, glam rock stomp and riff, pop mayhem bass andstrong story telling. Rolling Stone called the band one “to look out for”.Touring the state-of the-art weirdo album “Funeral Parade Of Roses” in 2020 was cancelled and Tanreimagined a new live line up as a classic 4 piece rock n roll band, calling on old buddies with abackground as historic as exciting in C³i, Kotzbrocken, Punkenstein, PSP, Clara Bow plus of courseTan’s own background.Naming the new outfit &Racoonery (file under ‘A’, it’s [and raccoonery]), „this new line up actuallyfeels like a real band which I haven‘t really felt like since my New York years or with Das Weeth(Experience)“. The band focusses on the hi- energy songs from Tan’s body of work, on attitude andlive mayhem, more experimental or quiet tunes are neglected. “Well, contemporary classic music islike a Bob Ross painting by numbers, everyone can do it and everyone does it”, explain Tan, “I don’twant to feel ashamed for my musical heritage”.The new material is harder – something that was hinted at with the last single Mary The Rhino -,sometimes faster and cannot betray the fact that three of the band grew up with the original“punk” bands. Then again, Tan’s songwriting always was outernational with a strong hint of NY Rockn Roll attitude to begin with. Lyrics are still angry, but also discuss solutions to the problems.Live they blast, people dance, some just watch astonished. A band not for everyone, but then, whowants to be that boring?All attempts of comparing (The Saints, Swell Maps, Mink DeVille, Nick Cave, Marc Bolan, MacDeMarco, The Coral, press dropped all these names desperately!) are meant to fail. Tan guested onstage with eclectic Jazz artist Alabaster DePlume as well as heroes the late Sylvain Sylvain and JerryNolan. As first Indie/ “Punk” Act, Tan LeRacoon was signed to well respected Soul/Jazz Label LégèreRecordings, a performance at Reeperbahn Festival filmed by ARTE television remains unbroadcast.Make of it what you wish. A new album is worked on, but live shows get the attention for now, with&Racoonery left open mouth and singing and dancing attendees."
