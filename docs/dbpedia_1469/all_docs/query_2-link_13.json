        "text": "üöóüõ£Ô∏è Amsterdam is embracing 30km/h! Approximately 80% of the city's roads are undergoing a transition to a reduced speed limit of 30km/h. This change aims to enhance road safety and create a more secure environment for all road users. - At 30km/h, the braking distance drastically reduces to 13 meters, less than half the distance required at 50km/h (27 meters). This reduction in speed significantly enhances the potential for avoiding collisions or minimizing their impact - Authorities anticipate a substantial decrease of 20 to 30% in severe accidents - The likelihood of a pedestrian surviving an accident at this speed rises to an impressive 95% - The reduction in speeds means that traffic noise is anticipated to be halved. The revised speed limits for a majority of the city offer a roadmap for other cities to make strong, effective changes in order to save lives! üö¶üåÜ https://lnkd.in/gc5tjwYD https://lnkd.in/efxcUp4Q AMS Institute City of Amsterdam Dutch Cycling Embassy\n\nWill the Olympic Games Transform #Mobility in Paris? D-1 before the opening ceremony! üèÖüá´üá∑ The Paris 2024 Games will bring athletes, spectators, and media from around the globe. Beyond sports, the Games will showcase the latest in #mobility tech, from high-speed rail to sustainable transit solutions, air taxis, and shared bikes and cars. üåü Did you know? 1. Stade de France station will see 1,000 passengers per minute during peak hours. 2. The Paris 2024 Opening Ceremony will be held on the Seine River, first time in Olympic history outside of a stadium. 3. A special ‚ÄòParis 2024‚Äô travel pass offers unlimited travel to Olympic venues, costing ‚Ç¨16 per day or ‚Ç¨70 per week. 4. Paris is expanding the Grand Paris Express, adding 200 km of new rail lines and 68 new stations by 2030. 5. The √éle-de-France region has integrated 1,400 km of cycle paths. 6. And very important: Approximately 45,000 international volunteers will help manage the Games, ensuring smooth operations and transport. Managing transportation for millions requires meticulous planning. The true test will be ensuring these investments benefit Paris long after the Games, just as London did in 2012. Let‚Äôs hope the Games leave a lasting, positive impact on Paris‚Äôs mobility. Now, let‚Äôs enjoy some serious sports! üèüÔ∏è Rail Europe #MakingTrainTravelEasy #Future\n\nVisiting Paris during the Olympic 2024 Games: some things you should know: Transport: For the duration of the OG, fares on the public transport network will double! From July 20 to September 8, 2024, for the millions of visitors and Parisiens single metro tickets will rise from ‚Ç¨2.10 to ‚Ç¨4, and a book of ten tickets from ‚Ç¨16.90 to ‚Ç¨32! Download the RATP local transport application: https://www.ratp.fr/ Accommodation: Is already expensive and getting more expensive as demand is higher than supply! On average, the cost of living in Paris for locals in 2024 is 28% higher than in France. RENTING A THREE-ROOM APARTMENT IN THE CITY CENTER COSTS ‚Ç¨3,074/MONTH (this figure depends on the district, whether is is short term or long term rental, furnished or unfurnished, floor level, caretaker, parking, balcony..). https://lnkd.in/e3Gd9Hed On the other hand, the average monthly salary is: ‚Ç¨3 940 https://lnkd.in/eyxan6yc Luxury rental during the OG \"the average price for renting prestigious accommodation during the Olympic Games is around 35,000 euros per week\" https://lnkd.in/etgi_3zz Eating out: Depends on the district and the restaurants popularity. Lunch time: between 20 to 40‚Ç¨ per person in a bistro. https://lnkd.in/enwBqsKV Check out TheFork https://www.thefork.fr/ And some of the most beautiful terraces in Paris: https://lnkd.in/eq8QCf5x Water: Since January 1, 2022, establishments open to the public are obliged to offer free carafes and glasses of water to their customers. As the law specifies, free water is intended for ‚Äúconsumers‚Äù, meaning customers who have ordered something else on site. They can therefore demand a free glass of water to accompany their coffee or a carafe during a meal. https://lnkd.in/emXnZK8u #paris\n\nOnly a few days since the start of the Paris 2024 Olympics, and for the real estate and hospitality industry it‚Äôs already time to take stock. Millions of tourist arrivals from all over the world, athletes and the media means that over this month or so hotel and holiday home prices will hugely increase also given the French government's decision not to impose any cap. Operators are therefore divided between those who have found a correct balance between guaranteeing occupancy and good rates for owners, without excessive price increases on guests, and those who have instead decided to make the most of the hype of the Olympics. As always, the Games will also help reshape the city's urban planning, with our industry being the subject of the conversion of the (few) new infrastructures such as the Olympic Village, which will be transformed after the Games into 2,500 new homes, a student residence and a hotel. This is similar to what will happen with another major event, now just around the corner: the 2026 Olympic Games, Milan and Cortina. According to a recent report by Scenari Immobiliari, the urban and building transformations in Milan will make it possible to develop a total surface area of around 1.1 million square meters, as opposed to the 680,000 or so estimated in the absence of the sports event, and generate real estate economic spin-offs in excess of 5.5 billion euros. A great challenge for sector operators who, as always in these Games, are called upon to contribute to defining industry standards and to be an active part of the trends that develop at an urban level after the impact of the events. In the meantime, good luck to the team in France that is opening the doors of our flats to visitors who have chosen Joivy to follow one of the most eagerly awaited events of the century #Olympics #Joivy"
