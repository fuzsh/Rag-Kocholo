        "text": "Storage Property in Howald\n\nLocated in Howald, this industrial storage facility topped by office space is both spacious and convenient. Just on the edge of Luxembourg city, the location’s appeal is that it is close enough to the centre for access, while far enough away to offer ample space at a reasonable price.\n\nHowald is a town in the commune of Hesperange, in southern Luxembourg. The town lies on the border of the south-eastern suburban quarter of South Bonnevoie, on the very edges of Luxembourg city. As of 2006, the town has a population of 4,760, making it the most populous town in the commune and the 22nd most populous in Luxembourg.\n\nAlthough slightly out-of-town, Still accessible via train and highway, the location has all of the advantages and few of the inconveniences that often come with a space dedicated to storage.\n\nNew Occupant: FIDUO SA\n\nFIDUO is an independent corporate services company established in Luxembourg 20 years ago. They work closely with FC Advisory, an independent business partner that specialises in tax advisory and corporate structuring. FIDUO offers a wide range of economic services, two of which are accounting and tax returns.\n\nRead more about FIDUO at fiduo.lu.\n\nWhy This Move?\n\nThe reason for this tenancy is to obtain more space for record keeping. This is necessary because, As FIDUO comes closer to 20 years in operation, their archives are growing too numerous to keep in the main location.\n\nFIDUO identified certain records which must remain secure but don’t require frequent access. Therefore, this storage facility and accompanying offices will contain outdated and archived records currently taking up space in the main office. As a result, the company can free up vital space in the main office for new records for their growing business.\n\nTransaction Info\n\nThe speed of this transaction delighted the parties. RealCorp introduced them and guided them smoothly through all the steps of viewing, offer and closing very rapidly. The premises had only just been vacated and RealCorp let them again almost immediately!\n\nHow can RealCorp help you?"
