        "text": "24 Football Teams from nine Countries and the Lake Constance Region to attend this Weekend’s Sports Event in Friedrichshafen\n\nmtu acting as Main Sponsor for the sixth Time running\n\nFriedrichshafen, 1st December 2008. Goooaaaal! On 6th and 7th December, Friedrichshafen will yet again welcome up-and-coming football players from Celtic Glasgow, FC Bayern München, VfB Stuttgart and other European top teams for the sixth mtu Indoor Cup in the “Bodensee-Sporthalle”. Together with seven teams from the Lake Constance region and the Friedrichshafen “mtu-Leistungszentrum Jugendfußball“ (mtu Youth Football Performance Center), the young players will compete for the highly coveted Prize Cup. The qualifying rounds will take place on Saturday from 8:30 to 19:00, whilst the finals will be played on Sunday between 8:30 and 16:00. The finalists will compete for their ultimate victory from 15:40 hrs.\n\nTognum subsidiary MTU Friedrichshafen is, yet again, the main sponsor. Volker Heuer, President & CEO of Tognum AG comments: “On the one hand, we want to support these young and ambitious players with our commitment, whilst on the other hand, we want to demonstrate our close ties to the Lake Constance region and continue our regional Youth Support work.“\n\nVfB manager Klaus Segelbacher points out the significance of this support for the organizer of the “mtu-Hallencup”, i.e. VfB Friedrichshafen: “We are glad we managed once again to gain MTU Friedrichshafen as a sponsor, since an event of this magnitude, involving such top teams, would have been impossible without this leading partner.“\n\nThus, spectators can look forward to excellent football performances from European top teams such as Celtic Glasgow, MTK Budapest, Red Star Belgrade, FSA Magna Vienna, Sparta Prague, Olimpik Sarajevo, Lech Poznań and FC Basel 1893, as well as German up-and-coming teams such as FC Bayern München, VfB Stuttgart, TSG 1899 Hoffenheim, Schalke 04, Borussia Dortmund, Hertha BSC Berlin, Eintracht Frankfurt and DSC Arminia Bielefeld. Local teams such as VfB Friedrichshafen, TSG Ailingen, TSV Tettnang, SGM Mecka/Kehlen, FV Langenargen, VFL Brochenzell, “Sportfreunde Friedrichshafen“, and - last, but not least - the team from the “mtu-Leistungszentrum Friedrichshafen” will compete with these top teams. The “mtu-Leistungszentrum” is a joint project run by VfB Friedrichshafen, mtu, as well as the Friedrichshafen local government. Particularly gifted players of all local teams have the opportunity to receive additional training sessions.\n\nThose who want to find out which teams will compete against each other, can have a look at the current contest schedule on www.mtu-hallencup.de. Final results will be published there at the end of the mtu Indoor Cup."
