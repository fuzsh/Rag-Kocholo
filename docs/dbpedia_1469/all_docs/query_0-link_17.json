        "text": "Will the Olympic Games Transform #Mobility in Paris? D-1 before the opening ceremony! üèÖüá´üá∑ The Paris 2024 Games will bring athletes, spectators, and media from around the globe. Beyond sports, the Games will showcase the latest in #mobility tech, from high-speed rail to sustainable transit solutions, air taxis, and shared bikes and cars. üåü Did you know? 1. Stade de France station will see 1,000 passengers per minute during peak hours. 2. The Paris 2024 Opening Ceremony will be held on the Seine River, first time in Olympic history outside of a stadium. 3. A special ‚ÄòParis 2024‚Äô travel pass offers unlimited travel to Olympic venues, costing ‚Ç¨16 per day or ‚Ç¨70 per week. 4. Paris is expanding the Grand Paris Express, adding 200 km of new rail lines and 68 new stations by 2030. 5. The √éle-de-France region has integrated 1,400 km of cycle paths. 6. And very important: Approximately 45,000 international volunteers will help manage the Games, ensuring smooth operations and transport. Managing transportation for millions requires meticulous planning. The true test will be ensuring these investments benefit Paris long after the Games, just as London did in 2012. Let‚Äôs hope the Games leave a lasting, positive impact on Paris‚Äôs mobility. Now, let‚Äôs enjoy some serious sports! üèüÔ∏è Rail Europe #MakingTrainTravelEasy #Future\n\nTHE PARIS METRO 1/3: The race for Line 1 ‚è≥ The year 1900 was going to be a big deal in Paris. April would see the opening of the Exposition Universelle (World‚Äôs Fair), and in May, the summer Olympics would arrive. And something had to be done about the state of the city‚Äôs public transport before the world came to visit. At the end of the 19th century, horse-drawn carriages were still being used to carry goods and passengers, creating an anarchic and unpleasant street experience. But what? City bosses and the French government had spent the last 50 years debating the subject of urban transport. A cable-car system, trains elevated above the city‚Äôs boulevards ‚Äì ideas were proposed and rejected, while the population expanded and the traffic congestion ‚Äì and the smell ‚Äì grew worse and worse. Finally, the city accepted the proposal of a Breton engineer called Fulgence Bienven√ºe to build an underground network of nine lines, funded by a private-public arrangement. Work didn‚Äôt get started until November 1898. The race was on. The first line, Porte Maillot‚ÄìVincennes (today‚Äôs Line 1), carrying passengers on an east-west axis across the city, opened only three months behind schedule, on 19 July 1900. Too late for the opening of the World‚Äôs Fair, but in time to carry spectators to the Bois de Vincennes to catch Olympic events. Their journey was slow ‚Äì the travel time between each station was 10 minutes when the line first opened. But we can imagine that it was a lot faster ‚Äì and more fragrant ‚Äì than the horse-drawn anarchy above ground. #Paris #travel #storytelling\n\nOnly a few days since the start of the Paris 2024 Olympics, and for the real estate and hospitality industry it‚Äôs already time to take stock. Millions of tourist arrivals from all over the world, athletes and the media means that over this month or so hotel and holiday home prices will hugely increase also given the French government's decision not to impose any cap. Operators are therefore divided between those who have found a correct balance between guaranteeing occupancy and good rates for owners, without excessive price increases on guests, and those who have instead decided to make the most of the hype of the Olympics. As always, the Games will also help reshape the city's urban planning, with our industry being the subject of the conversion of the (few) new infrastructures such as the Olympic Village, which will be transformed after the Games into 2,500 new homes, a student residence and a hotel. This is similar to what will happen with another major event, now just around the corner: the 2026 Olympic Games, Milan and Cortina. According to a recent report by Scenari Immobiliari, the urban and building transformations in Milan will make it possible to develop a total surface area of around 1.1 million square meters, as opposed to the 680,000 or so estimated in the absence of the sports event, and generate real estate economic spin-offs in excess of 5.5 billion euros. A great challenge for sector operators who, as always in these Games, are called upon to contribute to defining industry standards and to be an active part of the trends that develop at an urban level after the impact of the events. In the meantime, good luck to the team in France that is opening the doors of our flats to visitors who have chosen Joivy to follow one of the most eagerly awaited events of the century #Olympics #Joivy\n\nSo, we really did it. We put on Europe's highest disco, across three days and three venues, at heights up 3,000m above sea level, in the Swiss Alps. It wasn't easy, but it was wonderful ‚Äì evidence of what's possible when like-minded people come together to something crazy. We had Erol Alkan and DJ Paulette spinning to crowds above the clouds, as the sun set on the snow-capped peaks of the Bernese Alps. A once-in-a-lifetime experience for anyone who was there. Too many people to thank, but shout-out to Joss Bibby, Stephanie Faucher, Thomas Ranger, Hugo Kibasi, Ellie Watkinson, Jamie Trendall and the rest of the incredible Detour team, to Christoph Egger and others at Schilthorn/Piz Gloria and Fran Lambert at Switzerland Tourism, Annie and co. at INEOS Grenadier, Peter and Thereisa at Wild Alps and everyone who arrived via trains, coaches and four astonishing cable cars to the top of the mountain. Everyone keeps asking, what's next? There is a venue planned for 2025, but Detour Discotheque is building momentum as more than just a fun weekend ‚Äì it's an idea of community. It's about the shared power of experience. If that sounds like something you, or your brand, could get behind let us know: we're looking for partners for next year and beyond. As Lucy says in this lovely write up, one thing is for certain, \"Detour Disco 2025 is guaranteed to be a hell of a party.\" Until then, peace, love and mirror balls. https://lnkd.in/eBneNFdu\n\nWith two weeks left until Kings of Leon and other bands and other bands hit downtown Singapore, along with that sideshow of the Singapore F1 night race, STR and CoStar Group data is showing that hotel occupancy on the books is very close to that of last year. * 2022 was the great reboot year and big success of the F1 event, to be close this year means interest remains. * The Saturday now only has 1.5% difference in Occupancy on the books * Anecdotally some HNWIs and UHNWIs have decided to skip this year and as demand trajectory was slower this year, there is potential for later/smaller ADR compression, but if demand peaks out within the next week, it could still bring rates up to very high levels. * As 2023 is broadly a much more consistent high-demand year, with more business travellers and other groups, the biggest difference is that demand does NOT drop from Sunday night onwards at this point in time. Week after the race seem just as strong, whereas last year it was not the case a few weeks ahead of the race. * For reference, the race last year was two weeks later, so this comparison ignores the fact that 2022 had two more weeks to build up Occupancy, as this snapshot is taken on 28 Aug for both years. However, last year demand had already built up higher in 2022 at an earlier stage due to flights being more scarce. Go Lando Norris! #hotels #singapore #f12023 #costargroup #str"
