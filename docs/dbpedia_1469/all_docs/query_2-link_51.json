The man came home late, and after he had, with considerable trouble, found the key- hole and climbed upstairs, she started a good sermon, inter- rupted only by a few muttered utterances from his side, until he lost his patience and said : go to hell ' And every one of the audience understood, from the sound of the banjo, what his words had been. The performer produced these tones by turning the keys and so shortening and lengthening the strings. If you tried the same thing on the piano, you would hardly succeed in making yourself understood, because you can not glide from one tone to the other on the piano. And that is the peculiarity of the intonations, that our voice does not rest on one tone a perceivable time, but glides or slurs in a continual portamento or springs up and down. What is this intonation, this Sprachmelodie, or Sprachmelos,1 and how does it differ from a musical melody ? The main differ- ence in its character is the aforesaid difference of fixed and gliding tones. While a melody is musical, is bound to harmonies and keys, intonation is a half-musical noise with half-harmonies and disharmonies, quickly changing its keys, and having, instead of chords, arpeggiated chords.2 * A lecture given before the Language and Literature Club of the University of Wisconsin. i Saran in his Deutsche Verslehre (MUnchen 1907, p. 24 ff.) dis- criminates between \"Sprachmelos\" (intonation in prose) and \"Sprach- melodie\" (intonation in verse). *cf. Johan Storm, Englische Philologie, Leipzig, 1892. I 205 ff. —l 2 Feise It is proven by notations that speech really uses different keys for different purposes. But I am not musician enough to be competent on this question, and I can leave it aside for the very simple reason that only a very refined ear, after a close study, can discriminate any shades of that kind in our intona- tions.3 While, further, in music the words are rather an accompani- ment of the melody, and in a certain way subjected to it, speech- melody is an accompaniment of the speechsounds, accantus — accentus, as it was called in Latin, to translate the Greek term irpoffudla — i. e., something that is sung to the words which are the communication of the thoughts. Nevertheless, this irpo<ru8la is no unessential detail. As the quoted instance shows us, intonation alone is expressive. We can observe this every day by listening to a conversation in a distant room, from which we do not hear anything but a vague noise with its pitches. We even use it for communications of simple attitudes of mind toward a given fact, when we are too lazy to articulate. Our 'm' or 'm etc.,4 is almost nothing but intonation, and is nevertheless understood by the person addressed. Written words and phrases are lifeless and meaningless. They reveal in no way the emotional interest of the speaker, unless there be a musical sign represented by our punctuation. How- ever, the emotional interest of the speaker cannot be expressed at all, or at best incompletely, while in speech there is a sur- prising richness of means, which leaves the scholar who first tackles these questions almost in despair of ever being able to explain and classify them. And, indeed, comparatively little has been done. There are very clever apergus and observations on the question, which, however, often leave the reader in doubt about the most important details, because they are rendered by insufficient little bars and points, from which nothing can be 3 cf. Storm, 1. c., p. 207. cf. Merkel, Physiologic der menschlichen Stimme, leipzig, 1866. p. 356 ff. * cf. Eduard Sievers, Grundziige der Phonetik, Leipzig, 1901. § 397. An Introduction to the Study of Intonation 3 learned about the starting point and the nature of the intervals.8 There are elaborate curves taken with the kymographion in psy- chological laboratories. But those are too elaborate, the curves too long and large, and the instances, on account of the difficulty of this process, not numerous enough for our purposes.\" 5 Merkel in his \"Physiologic der menschlichen Stimme\" was one of the first to give notations with musical signs, and his observations are not yet antiquated nor surpassed. Paul Pierson (Metrique naturelle du language, Paris 1884), Storm (1. c. 1, 177 ff.), Saran (Deutsche Verslehre, Mtinchen 1907, p. 36 and p. 219; Studien z. d. Phil., Halle 1903, p. 171- 239) and others followed. Sievers in his \"Grundzlige der Phonetik, Leip- zig 1901,\" deals more with the more phonetic or physiological phenomena; his fundamental theories on ' ' Sprachmelodie ' ' are given only in form of a program (cf. note 18), but we are still waiting for his more extensive publication on the subject. It is a pity that A. Melville Bell in his various books on elocution and phonetics used the system of bars and points and a very vague description and terminology. His observations were, as it seems, to judge for instance from the XXVI chapter of his \"Essays and Postscripts on Elocution\" (New York 1886), \"A shadow class of students,\" very interesting and extensive. Other observations of that kind we find in Jespersen, Sweet, Passy, Hempl and others. Jespersen devotes a whole and very valuable chapter to these problems. It is to be regretted, in my opinion, that he did not discriminate between Hochton or Tiefton in the course of the sentence and rise and fall, if subject to the Ab- schlussgesetz, a circumstance which leads him to overemphasize the influence of the breath on intonation. He says (p. 228) : \"Beim Beginn eines Satzes, wo die Lungen eben mit Luft gef iillt sind, ist es natiirlich, dass auch die Schwingungszahl der Stimmbander grosser ist als gegen Schluss, wo die in der Lunge gesammelte Luftmasse fast verbraucht ist. Es ist daher ganz natiirlich, dass man die letzten Silben eines langeren Satzes mit tieferem Ton ausspricht als die ersten . . .\" This is, however, if made a law, not true. We can, on the contrary, very often observe that the highest rise is reached at the end of the sentence very close to the cadence, which occur* in the last syllable, or even in the last vowel or consonant of the last syllable. And for that reason I preferred to begin in my investigations with the end of the communication and to proceed toward the beginning. (Compare the doubtful intonation quoted by Jespersen : nicht ei *nen Pfennig^ mehr, which could be just as well : nicht einen Pfennig mehr* «cf. Edward Wheeler Scripture's works, especially his \"Element! of Experimental Phonetics,\" New York 1902. For more practical pur- poses the method of experiment with the machine seems to be of very small profit on account of the reasons given above. It is, moreover, 4 Feise Only a short time ago a way was found which really seems to be apt to give practical results. Daniel Jones published a small volume of intonation curves taken by the aid of a phono- graph and tuning forks. The only objection against this process would be that the records are not taken under his supervision with speakers whose peculiarities he had studied and he could describe, and that the speakers speak memorized texts with here and there false accents. A few attempts are made to simplify and classify the different observations, but they are neither thoroughly done, lacking a method and a system of classification and subclassification, nor do they avoid the difficulty which conies in through inappropriate terms and the attempt to characterize the whole intonation of a phrase at once, instead of taking the different parts of it first. Some of them even get confused by mixing up the intonation with the accent and by the presumption that the result of the stronger stress is a higher pitch. This is obviously an error. A violinchord does not give a higher pitch because it is pinched stronger; and so it is with the vocal chords. But emotions affect the larynx. Through acceleration of the movement of the heart, the breathing organs as well as the glottis are contracted, and accordingly the tone is pitched higher. On the other hand, relaxation, as a result of the not an advisable practice to use speeches made by a trained person, as those of actors, who are often carried away by habits of a peculiar kind of singing and by the melody of the verse itself. In Jones' notations I noticed among others the wrong intonation on p. 65: \"das ich dir aus- gesucht, where ich must not take the accent of emphasis (Wallenstein did not choose a horse, but rode his 'usual \"Schecke\"), and on p. 57 ' ' Liige ' ' only takes up the preceding verb ' ' liigen, ' ' and is therefore to be spoken in a low tone, while ' ' Sterrikunst \" deserves a higher pitch; line 6 on the same page the word ' ' giebt ' ' is overemphasized. The French conversation he offers is taken for educational purposes and accordingly somewhat conservative and unnatural in its intonation; the rare occur- rence of shifted accent to my mind seems to confirm this; for as Victor says (Elemente der Phonetik und Orthoepie des Deutschen, Englischen und Franzosischen, Heilbronn 1887): It is doubtful whether: \"das Franzb'sische iiberhaupt je anders als im Affekt gesprochen wird.\" (p. 43.) An Introduction to the Study of Intonation 5 diminished interest and emotion, lowers it. We can then state at this point one of the most elementary of psychological laws, that of expectation and fulfilment, to which the multitude of the phe- nomena of the endintonation can be reduced. By endintonation we mean the intonation of the end of a statement. For this is for our purposes the most important part of the sentence, and since we have in this investigation to deal more with the emotional expressions than with the merely physiological and phonetic sides of speech, we do well to give the main emphasis to this most important factor. The falling curve or cadence means that the communication of the thought is completed and that the speaker does not expect any continuation of it from the person addressed. The cadence is the expression of fulfilment. When I say : I'll take a walk today Ich werde heute ausgehen Je vais me promener aujourd 'hui there is nothing that indicates the expectation of a continuation or an answer. And the case is not changed — as it perhaps might appear to a person unused to observation of speechtones — when the accent on the last word brings in a high pitch before the dropping of the voice in I'll take a walk today or Ich will heute ausgehn or Je vais m' promener aujourd 'hui for there is always a little tag of falling curve even as late as in the last part of the i in aujourd'hui or in a voiced consonant : Er meinte den Mann II croyait que c'etait I'hOmme He meant the man Er 1st am Ziel The simplest way to find this out is to take a word of two syllables with the accent on the first. Instead of Er ist am Zfel say: Er ist am Ziele Er meinte die Manner a. s. o. 6 Feise The stronger the interest, the emotion of the communication, the larger the intervals. While the most usual curve moves in musical fourths and fifths by passing through the second, it is often pitched to the octave and even higher: for instance, if we want to emphasize that he meant the man, and not the woman. In doubtful cases, or even in general, it is advisable in order to suppress the \"Eigenton,\" the relative pitch of the vowel, to stop all articulation and let the air pass through the nose, thus isolating the intonation from the words to which it belongs, and to trust more to the motoric sense than to the acoustic. Sounds which are heard only with difficulty can still be felt through the movements of the glottis by a person that is used to observing himself. 50 the dropping of the tone at the end of the sentence : Oui, c'est gentll Perhaps for the reason of clearly bringing out the cadence, the French so often uses the shifted accent or the simple raising of the voice before the last syllable if this bears the main accent : Oui, c'est gen»til.r In Jones' notations, where this shifting is very scarce, we have it twice in the cadence : Alors il vaut mieux les prendre au gui* chet. (p. 46, 5) 51 ce n'est toi, c'est done ton* frere. (p. 42, 22) Jesperson quotes: On nous a servis comme des* rois. (Phon., p. 238) and Storm, I, 187 : Monsieur Dubois, donnez vous la peine d 'en-trer. The shifting, of course, is very common in cases of emotion and emphasis: En effet, je n'ai jarnais vu rien vu d'aussi gran*diose. C'est d'un effet mer \"velHeux. J'l'ai blen vu* mala je n'l'ai pas* en*ten*du. where \"entendu\" and \"vu\" form a contrast and would have about the same high pitch in German and in English : Ich habe inn gehort* aber nieht gesehn* I heard* him but I did not see* him i To indicate the relative lower or higher pitch I use the lower or higher dots at the end of the syllable. An Introduction to the Study of Intonation 7 That the mere syntactical structure of the sentence has no influence on the intonation can be easily seen, when we observe questions which are meant as commands or prohibitions. We say, with a constant fall :8 Willst du das wohl sein lassen\\ Will you stop that nonsense \\ Voulez vous me donner ce livre\\ But we can even go farther and state that intonations are kept for historical reasons. All questions with an interrogative pro- noun take the cadence. They were — according to a supposition which I owe to Mr. Edward Prokosch — originally dependent clauses, having the intonation of such. W6r hat dir das geeagt\\ Qul est-ce qui te 1'a dit\\ Wann hast du ihn gese\"hn\\ WhSn did you see him\\ When did you see him\\ When did you see him\\ When did you see\" him\\ And the same intonation will take place when a question is asked either upon a preceding communication of the fact you are asking for, or upon a preceding answer which you did not expect : Did he re\"ally say so\\ Hat er das wlrklich gesagt\\ Wh6n did you see him, not wh6re\\ Mais non, est-ce quil la ecrlt\\ No, but did he write it to you\\ We are perhaps not far from the explanation by assuming that those questions are also felt as dependent clauses : I mean : whe'n did you .see him\\ No, but did he write you, that is the question\\ One could say the preceding question implies a contrast: Did he write it to you\\ and we supply : Or did he only say so\\ But in disjunctive questions only the second member has the cadence ; the first one takes a rising pitch :9 s Here as later the cadence is indicated by a line slanting to the right, the end rise by a line slanting to the left. •cf. Jespersen, Phon. p. 332. Hempl: German Orthography and Phonology, New York, 1897, p. 172. 8 Feise Willst du hfer bleiben / oder nach Hause gehn\\ Will you stay he>e/or will you go h6me\\ Eesterez vous ici / ou rentrerez vous chez nous\\ Either these are not to be regarded as real questions, but as state- ments of two possibilities between which you have to choose, or they are under the laws of contrast pitch, which will be explained later. Hempl calls the second member an anticipated reply. I need not say that questions of surprise, anger, disappointment, even when they consist of an interrogative pronoun or interjec- tion, do not take the rising pitch, as long as an answer is not to be expected: wie\\ wirklich\\ est-il possible \\ vraiment\\ how\\ really \\ Many phoneticians presume a level pitch having its place between the rising and falling pitch. But I think that we can not concede it a class by itself. It is the expression of indiffer- ence, and, as far as I can see, always somewhat falling or some- what rising: ja yds oul well = may be, it is so tja = dazu kann ich nichts sagen well = I don 't know ja yds oul, mais They often indicate that some remark or objection is sup- pressed. We come now to the rising pitch, the most important use of which is that in questions not introduced by an interrogative pronoun : Hast du ihn geselm/ Did you s6e him / L 'avez vous vu / Est-ee que vous 1 'avez vu / Er hat das getan / Giebst du mir das Buch / But there is one sort of a question introduced by an interrogative pronoun that takes the rising instead of the falling tone, and that is a question asking for repetition of a statement or an answer which the questioner has not understood. A comes home and B asks him about his commission : A Well/what did he say \\ Nun / was hat er gesagt\\ Eh bien, quest-ce quil a dft\\ An Introduction to the Study of Intonation 9 B He'd come to-m6rrow\\ Er ktime m6rgen \\^ II allait venir demain\\ A What did he say / Was hat er gesagt / Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit/ Or, when B is surprised at the question of A, he will repeat the same question, with a rising pitch : Wa» hat er gesagt / Na, dass er kdmmen wollte\\ Jesperson calls this \"a question raised to the second power.\"10 In a surprised question the intervals are usually a little larger : Beally / Vraiment / Wirklich / To call some one's attention to a fact, to warn him, or to express that we are ready for action, we start with a compara- tively high tone and go still farther up : f ertig / ready / allright / attention / s'il vous plait / Vorsicht / Belegte Brb'dchen /, Pumpernickel / Apfelsinen gef allig / At the same time there is a very simple acoustic reason which often forces public speakers to raise their voice on the last syl- lable of the sentence, instead of dropping it; and this can also be noticed when somebody is called by name; however, in this last case the reason might be that one is waiting for an answer. Adolf/ Karl/ Ernst/ (which is mostly changed to Erenst) One of my first impressions, when I came to this country two years ago, was in the station of the New York Central the man with the megaphone, who, in the word \"Springfield,\" had a musical interval of about a fourth or fifth in the \"r,\" while the difference of the two \"i's\" was hardly a semitone. The word \"nation\" has always been very interesting to me in this respect, for almost every time I have heard it pronounced in a speech, it had the rising instead of the falling pitch; and I suspect that this is a habit introduced by public speakers who want to make it as expressive as possible at the end of a phrase, by raising the last syllable : of the whole nation/ 10 Phon. p. 231. 10 Feise On the other hand, it seems perhaps at the first glance sur- prising that peddlers and street vendors sometimes prefer the cadence. But it is to be remembered that their exclamations are mostly little songs, really sung more than spoken, though not always very musical. Our blueberry sellers sing : Heilebeern, frische Heilebeern Hei le beern frische Heilebeern Others : Waldmeister, alle Sorten Tee Wald-meis-ter, alle Sorten Tee In Normandy I heard a man peddling watercress and sus sous la botte, JJJ.JprfJ singing: Cresson de f ontaine, deus sous la botte, Cresson d' deus f on-taine sous la botte while in Holstein peddlers announce their fish with a rising pitch, but more with a speaking voice : Kaft FlundSrn Kaft Flundern An Introduction to the Study of Intonation 11 Still another reason, but in agreement with our statement: rising pitch is the expression of expectation, we have in sen- tences as Das must du doch nicht tunV You must not do\\that / or (Sweet), Don't forget to post that let'terV It isn't la->te/ (or better Ise-^it/) It serves here to soften the contradiction, the command, the prohibition, as if the speaker expected a defense or apology of the person addressed. It is not late\\ Don't forget to post that letter \\ You must not do that\\ sound quite different. And while these polite and gentle com- mands start quite low, we have the same phenomenon, but start- ing higher and with smaller intervals, when we say \"good-bye\" or \"halloh\" to a person. The other one usually replies in a lower tone and with the cadence: That means, the conversation is over. Good-byeV good'bye^ haMohV hal-loh> tjb'h/ tjoh\\ (for adieu in German) bonjour madame / bonjour monsieur \\ Bonjour madame Bonjour monsieur The rising pitch is further used at any stop in the middle of the sentence or any communication, in order to express that it is incomplete and the end to follow. You put in your order to your grocer, and say : A pound of butter/ two pounds of sugar/ a peck of apples/ a dozen of eggs/and a pint* of cream \"v\" A pottad of butter and a pint of cream « Note that ' ' pint ' ' takes the high pitch to emphasize the cadence. We have here in Englieh something similar to the French shifted accent. 12 Feise The same intonation can often be noticed in an emphatical: I-beg-your pardon. The grocer will repeat the same words with the same intonation, and ask: That's all/, and you will answer : That' -s all-s. In such enumerations, in English as in German, we mostly use thirds, fourths and fifths, starting from the fundamental and going up the scale. But while we say : Schokolade, Kaffee, Tee, Butterbrote Schokolade Butterbrote the French goes up to the fifth first, and falls back to the fourth. If the word, for instance, has four syllables, the first two remain on the starting tone; if three, the first one does; if two, the first one takes the fifth immediately : du chocolat, du t6, du caf6 du chocolat du te du cafe But the opposite intonation, falling curve is used if the specifi- cation is to be emphasized ; for instance, if the great number of objects is to be brought out : Butterbrote An Introduction to the Study of Intonation 13 We saw a terrible disorder: bookB\\chairs\\plates\\old rags\\ music \\everything lay on the floor in an utter confusion.is The following example may illustrate the rising at the stop in a sentence : Soon /, however /, the revival took a turn / at which the more con- servative clergy were alarmed. And the English rule of punctuation before a relative clause, which seems so hard to learn to foreigners, is the easiest thing in the world if formulated as follows : Set a comma, where you drop your voice, no comma where you raise it. But, to be sure, they would have to know where to raise and to drop the voice. The people / who had been so profoundly stirred by this great awak- ening / were the same / who in 1776 declared themselves independent from the mother country. NO COMMA. But He did not come home even then\\, which merely showed that he had little regard for his family, or At last I was obliged to give a peremptory refusal \\, for which we had nothing but sullen looks and short answers the whole day ensuing. An exception to this intonation is made when, as in the case of the enumeration, the attention of the listener is called to the details of the sentence, to every part of the explanation. So in dramatic description: Und als sie nun da stand\\und weinte\\und nach ihrer Mutter rief \\, und er ins Zimmer trat\\und sie in seine Arme schloss /, da kam ihr zum erstenmal der Gedanke. . . . And now when she stood there\\and wept\\and called for her mother\\and he entered the room\\and took her in his arms/, for the first time the thought came to her. . . . The general level of every new instance here is a little higher, but with falling curve, until the last one takes the rising pitch to indicate the relation of dependent and independent clause. So also in an argument: Et quand alors\\, par une eorte de progr&s\\, de processus lent\\ il seront arrive'\\a ce point\\troub!6\\et obscure/, il ne se reveilleront pas sur terre. . . . Hempl14 gives another example and states this falling pitch 18 cf . Jespersen, Phon. p. 235. « 1. c. p. 171. 14 Feise if it is desired to give the impression that the members of a series were not all thought of in the first framing of a sentence : Er war furchtbar bose\\, er schwur\\, er stampfte mit den Fu8sen\\, er schlug sogar nach mir. This instance, however, is not as good because of the gram- matical completeness of every member of the description. So far we have only spoken of the very end of the sentence. Even in the short communication represented by a single word, as: ja, yes, oui, non, so, indeed, we have complications which have led several scholars to the assumption of compound pitches, as : falling-rising and rising-falling. For the sake of simplicity those terms are advisable and acceptable. But I hardly think that they differ materially from the simple types of rising and falling pitch, because we can observe, even here, that straight rise or straight fall very seldom takes place.15 Mostly we have curves. To mark and emphasize the rise, we go down first and let the pitch glide or spring up; to emphasize the fall, we do the opposite. jaA jaV neinA neinV yes A yesV a. s. o. If now a word with a strong accent precedes this last fall or rise, the curve will be more pronounced ; that is, the accent will take the opposite tone, and the end of the syllable or the follow- ing unaccented syllable will glide up and down through a more or less large interval to the third, fourth, fifth or, even the octave, or still higher. jaA non, yesA, oui\\Boger/ This last example shows: the tone which is the farthest removed from the final tone can be placed back from the end into the interior of the clause : Don't you like to; have it warm' in your roo*m Est-ce que ton pe're te 1'a di't We*r hat dir das gesa'gt. However, if the word with the last accent is too far removed from the end, or an accessory accent comes in after it, the first accent takes the high pitch and the curve goes down and reaches \" I find a similar opinion in Victor, Elemente der Phonetik, Leip- zig 19045 p. 300. An Introduction to the Study of Intonation 15 its lowest pitch in the other accented word or near the end of the communication:16 Est-ce que votre p6*re ne vous a pas donne ce li.vre- Didn't your farther at least tell you anything about this mat.ter* But even this does not occur if the character of the question is that of astonishment, surprise, if the most important word has a contradictory accent, if in our example the father is meant in contrast to the mother. And from this use that intonation seems to be originated which I should like to call \"Kapportyom\" or the \"tone of relation.\" We find it in all contradictions, establishing a relation between the speaker and the person addressed. We can generally supply the words \"as you think,\" and, if not already expressed, the posi- tive contradictory statement. My mo.thei- did not say so/ (as you think, but it was my father) Ka.rl hat das nicht getan/ Hei'nrich ist gekommen, nicht Frie.drich/ Frie.drich' ist nicht gekommen, sondern Hei'nrich\\ Note that always the negative member takes the low pitch. The character of this intonation seems to be that of a certain didactic nature, and, as aforesaid, establishing a relation between the speaker and the person addressed. I have not yet been able to observe it in French, where it seems to be lacking. Ces gens n' sont pas v'nus au spectacle pu or vous^ 6n • where \"vous\" does not get the strongly lowered pitch and the intonation falls from \"en\" to \"tendre\" C'e n 'etait pas mon p&'re, c'etait m6n'frere i« Jespersen says, 1. c. p. 231: \"Wo die Frage nur einera einzelnen Wort im Satze gilt, erhalt dieses Aufton, wahrend das Folgende gut abwarts gehen kann, z.B. '1st es An*na, mit der er sich verheiratet hat?' \" I would, however, call this intonation quite exceptional and rather have \"Anna\" take the lowest tone in the sentence. Jespersen 's example makes me think of questions in a guessing game. IT This example is taken from Storm 1. c. I 218. 16 Feise where the accent is shifted upon the \"mon.\" Thus it seems that in general we have to discriminate between two intonation sys- tems which have already been assumed by Sievers, who stated: \"Es gebe in Deutschland zwei landschaftlich getrennte Systeme der Empfindung fiir die melische Wirkung der Rede, das Nieder- deutsche und das Hochdeutsche\" ; that is to say, a curve which expresses in the North of Germany a certain emotional attitude of the speaker will in the South express a quite different one. However, I cannot help thinking that this — merely preliminary — statement is too general, and that it is rather the emotional condition than the expression of it which changes. For even in the two parts of Germany, in the very dialects, I find intona- tions which for the German of the South and the German of the North have the same meaning and are the expression of the same emotional attitude. If I may be permitted to give my opinion on the matter, which is based on observations made at random, I would say that the two different intonations corre- spond to different conditions of mind and are the result of the racial difference and of that of temperament. I find that the observations made by Lessiak in his excellent article on the \"Mundart von Pernegg in Karnten\" support this idea. He states the two intonations in his Southern dialect, and says that the first one, with rising pitch on the accented syllables, is used to express emotionless statement, communication of interest- ing events, command, energetic confident statement, cheerful or angry surprise, astonishment. The second, where the accented syllables have the lower pitch, is used to express indifference, resignation, despair, complaint, pity, well-meant advice, mild reproof, moderate surprise, objective narration, indifferent repe- tition of a communication of a third person, restrained style with persons of higher station. The tempo, he says, is here less fast, the intervals smaller, the general level lower. is Eduard Sievers : Ueber Sprachmelodisehes in der Deutschen Dich- tung, Leipzig 1901, p. 24. Franz Saran, Deutsche Verslehre, Miinchen 1907, p. 116. An Introduction to the Study of Intonation 17 And he gives an excellent instance of the change of the two intonations : It's a hard world, one never knows what to do. Help is getting scarce, corn isn't worth anything anymore. What in the world will become of us at the end? V V is is wol rii'oe a khraeita af dr welt man was son ne'amer wos man Bolt o'nhobm: de.anspotn sint olwaeil weanigr, s tra.d hokhan wert mer — io wohln wemr den khO'm an gotsnom mitr waeil. That agrees perfectly with our observation. Lessiak says that the sentence with reversed intonation is a kind of paren- thesis, a simple intimation of unquestioned facts. I would say : it refers to something that the person addressed knows and which the speaker wants to recall to him ; it is didactic. I myself have observed this intonation in lectures, where the lecturer gives a resume. For instance : We can therefore / make the statement /, that this intonation / in used / to sum up / the different details /, pointed out / in the course / of our lecture \\ The French example given above: Et quand alors\\, par une sorte de progres\\, de processus lent\\, il seront arriv6\\a ce point \\troubl6\\et obscure \\ I could give, as a resume with the opposite intonation, Et quand alors /, par une sorte de progres /, de processus lent /, il seront arrive / a ce point / troub!6 / et obscure /, il ne s 'eveilleront pas sur terre A few days ago I made the same observation with Mr. Mor- gan, who gave in his own words a resume of the contents of an article which had appeared in the Nation. Hempl's note on the subject (1. c. p. 172 & 173) would, however, rather confirm Sie- vers' supposition. He says : \"It will be observed that in most cases this intonation (falling-rising) is generally associated with an incomplete or hesitated presentation of the case. Its excessive use by many Americans makes upon Germans and English- men an impression of weakness and indecision,\" while \"falling- rising\" is associated by Germans and Americans with some form of disapproval or contempt. Its lavish use by Englishmen is therefore apt to give offense where not intended. -2 18 Feise How general all these intonations are, and whether the peculiarities of the individual demand a more extensive con- sideration, is still to be investigated and must be shown in detail. Still, I hope to have given the impression that a large part of them is common to all. The limitations of a three-quarters-of-an-hour lecture com- pelled me to restrict myself to the question of the direction of the curves and to leave aside as much as possible the complica- tions arising from the nature of the intervals, their starting point, etc. To give an example: though the direction is the same, the curve in: I didn't mean to do that (Look here,) I didn't mean to do that. ( I am awfully sorry that I did it and don't see how it could happen) denotes something different from the curve in: I didn't mean to do that (Why? Do you think I'm telling you a story?) But still less has been done in this line of investigation on the subject, and I would have to give mere observations. If I have contributed to show what stage our knowledge of these matters has reached, and succeeded in pointing out what an enormous field of linguistic investigation is opened, I would be very glad. And this field will not only bear fruit for the study of modern languages — it will at the same time give new insight into psychological facts in regard to the relations of the languages, and, further, in question of authorship, furnish valu- An Introduction to the Study of Intonation 19 able criteria, as the new, startling theories of Sievers and Ottmar Rutz have proven. cf.

BARTHOLD HEINRICH BROOKES AND THE SEASONS. The Seasons was one of the earliest of the great English works to be translated into German and from its first intro- duction proved such a favorite that many later attempts were made to render the poem in various forms. These attempts extend over a period of more than seventy-five years, covering the critical period of German literature when the poetical language of Germany was being created and perfected and when the literature of the country was advancing by great strides from the dullness and bombast of the early eighteenth century writers to the finished work of the classical period. Under the sway of the Romanticists and their strivings to get back to nature the Seasons won new popularity and in the early nineteenth century renewed attempts were made to give the German readers an adequate presentation of Thomson's poem. Covering as it does this long period of creating and perfect- ing, the various translations of the Seasons may be taken as a somewhat crude measure of the growth of the German language and of the advancement of the art of translation which kept step with the general literary development of the country. At the time Brockes put the Seasons into German (1744) none of the great translations had been written which have made the literature of that country famous in this branch. His work was done some twenty years before Wieland's Shakespeare translations appeared — the first of that great line of reproductions which through the efforts of Eschenburg, Tieck and Schlegel have made the English author almost as well known in Germany as at home. Voss did not set the high standard of skill in this art till a generation after Brockes' death (1747), when his version of Homer's Odyssey appeared Barthold Heinrich Brookes' Thomson's Seasons 21 (1781). It was the wonderful success which crowned this work that showed the Germans what a translation really might be and the high ideal here reached led Goethe to formulate the principles set forth in his essay on \"Uebersetzung.\"1 Not till some ten years after the appearance of the first edition of the Seasons in London (1730) did the influence of this poem make itself felt in Germany. Barthold Heinrich Brockes2 (1680-1747) was the first writer in Germany to discover the great English landscape author, or at least, the first to introduce him to German readers. It is not known how Brockes became acquainted with Thomson's poem ; still it is not unlikely that his good friend, Friederich von Hagedorn,3 had presented him with the volume. In 1729 Hagedorn went to London as private secretary to the Danish ambassador, Freiherr von Sohlenthal. In 1731 he returned to Hamburg and it is very possible that he carried back with him a copy of the Seasons, which just at that time was causing such a furor in London, and that he presented it to his friend, Brockes, whom he knew would appreciate it highly. Brockes had for many years been publishing poetry which treated of nature from the idealistic standpoint and which saw in all earthly phenomena the glorifica- tion of the Creator. The study of nature and his love of out-door life had aroused him to put forth one volume after another. B. J. Zink, in his introduction to the seventh volume of Irdisches Vergniigen in Gott,4 writes of Brockes: \"Die Stunden, welche Ihm die muhsamen Pflichten seines Amts iibrig gelassen, hat Er denen Pflichten gewidmet, die Er schon vielen Jahren als ein verniinftiger Zuschauer der Werke Gottes und als Lehrer der Natur ausgeiibt hat.\" But by the time he received the Seasons — Brockes was then about fifty years old — his muse had almost reached the limits of her creative power.6 1 W.

Eschenburg, Hagedorns Werke, vol. IV, p. 8. * This is the title of the nine volumes of poems which Brockes wrote. Eeferred to hereafter as Ird. Verg. s Brandl, p. 77. 22 Stewart His works were becoming more and more uninteresting and pedantic, the schoolmaster was taking the place of the author and his poems were becoming mere catalogs of the beauties of nature. Wieland wrote: \"Alle hier angezogene Brockischen Stiicke befinden sich in dem ersten Theil des Ird. Verg. in Gott, wo man liberhaupt seine besten Sachen suchen muss.\"* Thomson is sometimes criticised for overloading his verse with too many details and for neglecting his background and the arrangement of his pictures in his effort to cover minutiae, but in this respect his poetry is simplicity itself when compared with that of Brockes, who studied nature through a magnifying glass. Brockes was already too old by the time he read the Seasons to be expected to change his method or style to any great extent, still, after taking up his residence in Ritzebiittel in the year 1735, quite a marked improvement is seen in his work. In this place with its quiet country life he breathed in a new inspiration for nature and in her solitudes he read Thomson's Seasons, which he had brought with him from Hamburg.7 Zink, in the introduction above mentioned, ascribes this improvement to the change of scenery : . \"Neue Vorwiirfe haben Ihm zu neuen Gedanken Anlass gegeben. — Das Landleben hat indessen seine besondere Vorziige. Es giebt tausend Vorwiirfe, die zu einem zartlichen und verniinftigen Vergniigen anreizen, und die Seele eine gewisse sanfte Kuhe und eine Freystatt verstatten, der sie so oft in der Stadt und unter dem Gewiihl der Menschen entbehren muss.\"8 Brockes found in the Seasons no new sort of poetry, for he had long been writing descriptive and narrative verse, but he rather discovered in Thomson a greater poet than he himself was in his own field.9 And since he perceived that Thomson had expressed more beautifully the love for nature than he could do it, he followed his English master and translated what he could not invent. With the Jahreszeiten as a magic wand he led German poetry out from the study and the haunts of « Wieland, Brief e an einen jungen Dichter, p. 101. 7 Brandl, p. 97. s Zink, p. 11. 9 Gjerset, p. 9. Barthold Heinrich Brookes' Thomson's Seasons . 23 man into the heart of nature and showed her the beauties there ; how the grass grows and the flowers bloom and how the plains and woods are full of life and music; showed her the beauties of the day and night and the joy of living; led her through the harvest fields with the ripening grain and all their bounteous life, into the forest with its falling verdure and its departing birds, and sang to her also of the joys of winter with its snow and ice and active life. And German poetry heard and caught the inspiration, and a new life thrilled through her song and filled her notes with love for the world and its beautiful, simple nature. Brockes was a writer without much imagination, but his love for nature led him to wish that he might arouse in his fellow-countrymen an appreciation of her. This desire was furthered by the success of his first volume of poems, which had met with a warm reception. To him rather than to Haller belongs the honor of introducing descriptive poetry into Germany and of freeing German verse from the bondage of artificial nature as seen in the \"Schafergedichte.\" II. THE FIRST ATTEMPTS TO TRANSLATE PARTS OF THE SEASONS. 1. About the time that the influence of the Seasons began to make itself felt in Brockes' poems, he was reproducing fragments of Thomson's work, the first appearing as an appendix to his translation of Pope's Essay on Man (Hamburg, 1740). This earliest attempt was a short selection from Spring, which was printed with the English text on the opposite page under the title, \"The Wild and Irregular Passion of Love\" which Brockes rendered, \"Die Wilden und unordentlichen Eigenschaften der Liebe, aus Mr. Thomsons Seasons.\" In this passage Brockes tries several different meters; perhaps in order to see which is most convenient and best suited to his purpose, although he uses no forms with which he was not already familiar. We find here a mixture of verses with four, five and six accents, with anacrusis and with random rhyme. The double line or verse of eight accents,10 which is really made up of two rhythmical groups of four accents each, is not used at all. It had not a* 10 For discussion of verse form see p. 69. 24 Stewart yet driven the other forms of verse into the background and it was not the only form used in translations, as Brandl states.11 That Brockes found the verse of six accents too short to make a verse-for-verse translation is clearly seen from the fact that he required 195 lines to reproduce the 133 of the original, which in his complete work of 174512 requires but 137 verses. In this earliest attempt the Picture of Passion is not very exactly ren- dered. Since he printed the English text on the opposite page it would seem that the author had rather the idea of introducing Thomson's work to Germany than of making a close translation. Compared with J. it is more poetic and pleasing because it is not hampered by the necessity of reproducing the original so exactly, but may take liberties in treatment which could not be allowed in J. When Brockes made his complete translation of the Seasons he used his earlier attempt, transferring from it, without change, all verses of four accents. The other verses were expanded to eight accents, but a large number of words, phrases and rhymes were retained in J. Since the same measure is used in both it was only necessary to add the lacking syllables to fill out the eight accents. 2. Brockes' second attempt was a reworking of the Hymn to the Seasons, which he used as an introduction to his Harmonischen Himmelslust im Irdischen.1* This translation Brockes has added to his Jahreszeiten, with a few minor changes. He has reproduced the 121 iambic verses of the original by 173 double verses without anacrusis. His work is very free, much freer even than J., and can be considered only as a reworking. At the end of the hymn Brockes has added: \"Dieses Gedicht ist nach Anleitung eines beriihmten Dichters, Mr. Thomson, verfertiget worden.\" One emendation that Brockes made is interesting. In the edition of 1741 v. 40, every living soul, is rendered, alle lebendigen Seelen. In J. this appears: alle Geister, alle Seelen, which is not so exact, but which enables the 11 Brandl, p. 133. 13 This will hereafter be referred to as J. i* Musiealische Gediehte und Cantaten, theils neu, theils aus dem Ird. Verg., Hamburg, 1741. Barthold Heinrich Brookes' Thomson's Seasons , 25 author to avoid the old pronunciation of lebendigen.15 Brockes also made many other orthographic changes when he published the hymn a second time in J. 3. Brockes' next published translation from the Seasons is inserted in his Fruhlingsgedicht.19 It also appears in his Canto-ten, 2nd edition,17 under the title, Die Vogel im Fruhling, which is introduced by an aria. F. G., which contains a trans- lation of Sp. 535-827, begins with 80 verses by Brockes, a mixture of lines of eight, six, five and four accents. When Brockes inserted this translation in J., he had to make many changes, as it was so free. As far as v. 645 (110 verses), Brockes has inserted his first translation as a whole in J., but the portion between 645 and 796 he could not use, as it had been too freely treated and too much omitted. Verses 645-711 are entirely omitted in F. G. and, in place of the description of the eagle, Brockes has put in two verses on the power of the Creator. The first translation of vv. 712-731 is inserted in J., almost without change. The passage 733-795 is again completely changed, the 22 verses of F. G. being expanded to 55 in J. From that point on (796-827) the earlier translation is again used and the poem ends with 22 original verses which contain a panegyric to God. 4. Brockes, in his Morgengedanken,1* has again made use of the Seasons, this time selecting vv. 46-95 from Summer. This can scarcely be considered a translation, but is rather an imitation of Thomson's verses, the same descriptions being given and the same plan followed. The author has again added to his title, \"Nach Anleitung Mr. Thomson's.\" In M. G. the fifty is This shows a later use of the old pronunciation of this work by Brockes better than does the reference given in Grimm's Wor- terbuch, vol. VI, p. 426. i« Ird. Ver., vol.

In J. the same portion is repro- duced in forty-one double verses and ten short lines. Only a few expressions from M. G. are retained in J. : bunten Osten, Wandersmanne, der junge Tag. It seems as though Brockes has avoided the repetition of the same terms. After Brockes had made these four attempts, he published no more fragments, but completed his Jahreszeiten, which appeared a few years later. III. BROCKES' JAHRESZEITEN. THE ENGLISH TEXT.

The first edition was full of typographical errors and old spellings and most of these were corrected in the second edition. Still many are retained and these are found also in Brockes' text: Sp. 220 smoaking, 222 landskip, 273 chearful, 359 gulph, 614 compleat, 834 rowl, etc. In Sp. 1057 Brockes has copied a typographical error, laivsh.

The earlier form reads : Au. 861 And thus united Britain, Britain made Intire, th' imperial Mistress of the Deep. In the latter form and in Brockes' text this is changed to: And thus in Soul united as in Name, Bid Britain reign the Mistress of the Deep. 21 The engravings Brockes has published in his translation are copied from those of the 1738 edition, which were drawn by W. Kent and engraved by P. Fouodrier. The German plates were engraved by C. F. Fritzsch; the artist is not mentioned. B. J. Zink, in his introduction to Brockes' Jahreszeiten, men- tions the edition of 1738 and gives the six lines that were added after Wi. 230, and also a translation of them by his employer. He writes further: \"Sonsten ist vor wenig Monaten eine mit etwan tausend Zeilen vermehrte Auflage ans Licht getreten, welche aber nicht zur Zeit in Deutschland angelanget ist.\" This was the edition of 1744, in which the number of verses in the Seasons was increased from 4,343 to 5,413. A. TEXT CRITICISM. I. SUCCESSFUL TRANSLATIONS. Brockes recognized Thomson as a master after his own heart, as one who had a theological strain running all through his work, who saw the perfection of nature and recognized its meaning22 and who wrote many songs of praise to the Creator. zifiorchard (p. 16) in discussing the text of 1738 writes: \"Der Text der Jahreszeiten ist im Friihling, Sommer und Herbst ein un- veranderter Abdruck der Quart ausgabe von 1730.\" * Herder calls Thomson's Seasons \"schildernde Lehrgedichte.\" Briefe, vol. XVIII, p. 106. 28 Stewart Here Broekes could follow the English poet in complete sym- pathy, and it is just in his translations of these panegyrics that he is most successful. It is by no means a literal translation and yet is a fairly true reproduction of the original. Perhaps it is this very free- dom of treatment that makes these passages Brookes' best renderings. They show at least that Brookes' work has a style of its own. It may not be Thomson's, the lines may not be as rolling and majestic as the blank verse, indeed they may be accused of being wordy, ponderous and rough, but we find here the diction which is characteristic of his whole Ird. Verg. in Oott. II. TREATMENT OF PERIODS. In general Brockes has followed the division into periods and systems which characterize the original. He has never under- taken to transpose the episodes, pictures or order of his text, but he has often changed the grouping of sentences within a period, and this has led him sometimes to a false interpretation. Cauer (p. 120) defends this procedure and shows the necessity of breaking up a long Latin sentence so as to avoid a multiplicity of subordinate clauses and phrases, which are so frequent in the classic languages. Brockes has made these changes for the sake of clearness, especially in passages which contain several exclama- tions, dependent clauses or participial phrases. Such periods he has divided into sentences, supplying verbs where necessary. For instance, in Sp. 1043-1061 a period of nineteen lines has been separated into four sentences. Shorter periods have been similarly treated; Sp. 127-135, eight verses are here divided into three sentences; Sp. 273-279, in place of a period of six lines, three sentences are found, and, Su. 429-438, six sentences take the place of a period of ten lines. Such a division has little or no effect on the sense of the passage, as Brockes has ended sentences where Thomson placed colons or semi-colons. But in several instances he has begun a new sentence where there is no break in thought. In such cases the difference in grouping causes a grammatical change which often alters the sense. Barthold Heinrich Brockes' Thomson's Seasons , 29 Sp. 517 By Thee disposed into congenial soils, Stands each attractive plant, and sucks, and swells The juicy tide; a twining mass of tubes. Durch Dich stehn, als in Hochzeit-Betten, die Pflauzen in der Erden Bau. Es sauget seine saftge Kost ein fester Klump gedrehter Rohren. Su. 221 While the full-uddered mother lows around The cheerful cottage then expecting food, Bey ihnen briillen Die Mutter mit gefiillen Eitern. Die Hiitten hoffen sich zu fiillen Mit Kost der unschuld und Gesundheit. III. THE USE OF PARENTHESES. For the sake of clearness Brockes has sometimes enclosed in parentheses verses which, to him, seemed to disturb the con- tinuity of the thought. In many instances this is undoubtedly an advantage, as Thomson often inserts subordinate ideas in the chief sentence, and, when Brockes has expanded these, his translation would lack clearness did he not adopt some such method of distinguishing between clauses. Sp. 548 Every copse Thick-wove and tree irregular, and bush Bending with dewy moisture, o'er the heads Of the coy Quiristers that lodge within Are prodigal of harmony. Aus jedem Busch, von jedem Zweige (der weich bemooset, dick belaubt, Und von dem klihlen Thau noch feucht, als wie ein kleiner griiner Bogen Sich iiber dieser Sanger Haupt, So sie die ganze Nacht beherbergt, zum Schutz und auch zur Lust gebogen) Erschallt ein frohliches concert. For the sake of clearness, Brockes has sometimes added to such parenthetical clauses and occasionally he has included a part of the main thought, thus giving a wrong idea of his original. 30 Stewart Sp. 250 Whether he steals along the lonely dale In silent search: or through the forest, rank With what the dull incurious weeds account, Bursts his blind way; Die er, bald durch ein einsam Thai, mit stiller Hand bemiiht zu stehlen Bald durch den Wald, (wo wilde Krauter unachtsam sich durch iilles drangen, Wo sie die blinden Wege selbst durch ein bestandigs Driicken sprengen.) IV. EPISODES. Among his descriptions of nature in her changing phases, Thomson has inserted some thirty episodes in the form of praise to the Creator, panegyrics to England and her great men, philosophical reflections and narratives. These constitute nearly one-third of the Seasons (about 1,300 lines). Those episodes Brockes has expanded more than he has the remainder of the poem, and he has rendered the philosophical passages most freely. It was pointed out that it is in such portions that his translation is most successful. V. PICTURES. The Seasons contain many pictures which vary in length from three or four lines to twenty or thirty. They are full of motion; in none of them is perfect repose and quiet: even in the description of the noon hour on a hot summer's day, the rooks fly across the foreground, the \"homely fowls convene,\" \"in the buzzing shade\" the sleeping dogs dream of the chase till \"wakened by the wasp.\" In Winter, v. 220, after the snow has \"turned the earth's universal face into one dazzling waste,\" the picture is not dead; the ox lows, the birds and hare appear before the cottage and the sheep wander over the fields. Brockes has succeeded quite well with these pictures, although he some- times omits part of the action, as in Su. 229, where he has rendered \"the homely fowls convene\" by \"in bequehm-und fauler Ruh, gestrecket bey einander liegen.\" In the same picture the \"buzzing shade\" is omitted. This loss of action in the pictures rests largely on the omission of adjectives of motion, although in some cases it is the verbs which are left out. Barthold Heinrich Brookes' Thomson's Seasons 31 VI. PASSAGES FREELY TRANSLATED. From the examples given it will be seen that Brockes has not made a literal translation, and in many places he has apparently made no effort to follow his original closely. He was enough of a writer, and had a sufficient knowledge of nature, to have his own ideas along the line of thought inspired by Thomson, and moreover he had written too much nature poetry to hesitate to insert such ideas in his translation. It is in just this par- ticular that Wieland criticised Brockes when he said: \"Er wiirde ewig mit seiner Betrachtung der Natur haben fortfahren konnen auf die Art wie er es angefangen.\" Many lines of the Jahreszeiten can scarcely be considered a translation, so freely has the original been treated; indeed, some passages are not recognizable as from Thomson. The translator has succeeded in complicating simple ideas and in reproducing in an almost unintelligible style what in the original is clear and plain. What work he has made of Sp. 134 ! Nor from their friendly task, the busy bill Of little trooping birds instinctive scares. Da denn auch der geschaftige Schnabel der kleinen Vb'gel sie entdecket, Und durch ihr, ihm niitzlichs, Tagwerk und fressigen Instinkt sie schrecket. These cases are selected from the freest of Brockes' render- ings ; to give all the passages in which he has treated his original freely would necessitate reprinting almost the whole of the Jahreszeiten. If these intentional variations reproduced the thought of the original and were made merely to fill out the double verse they would not be such great blemishes on his method of translation ; but they are really more than repetitions or expansions of Thomson's thought, they are substitutions of Brockes' own ideas in place of what he found in his English text. It is this tendency on Brockes' part which led von Palthen to write in the introduction to his translation of the Seasons (1785) : \"Es ist bekannt, dass die Broksische t^bersetzung in Versen abgefasset sei. Ich weiss nicht, ob in dem Zwange des Silben- Cf. von Palthen, p. 84. 32 Stewart masses allein, oder noch in einer andern Ursache der jjrund lieget, dass diese tJbersetzung ihrem Originale so gar unahnlich 1st; so viel weiss ich, und ich berufe mich hierin kiihnlich auf das Urtheil der Kenner, dass selbige in gar vielen Stellen den Sinn der Urschrift falsch ausdrukke, und wo sie denselben trift, mehrentheils die Starke des mannlichen Dichters durch eine matte Ausdehnung schwache, und unfuhlbar mache.\" I suspect that Brockes has treated his original so freely because he did not always understand it perfectly. He trusted more to his feelings than to his knowledge. It was easier for him to give his conception of Thomson's thought than it was to study out the meaning of what was not clear to him. VII. INCORRECT TRANSLATIONS. The difficulties of Thomson's English and his involved style have led Brockes into many errors. At the time when this translation was made there was but one lexicon to which the writer could refer for words unknown to him. This was the Teutsch-Englisches Lexicon of Christian Ludwig, which had appeared in several editions. The earliest copy which I have been able to consult is the second edition, Leipzig, 1745. This contains a reprint of the preface to the first edition, in which Ludwig writes: \"Nichtsdestoweniger ist man gemiissigt, das gegenwartige Dictionarium nicht ohne Vorrede in die Welt zu schicken, weil es das erste von seiner Art ist, darinne einzele teutsche Wb'rter so wohl, als gantze Eedenstarten, und insonder- heit solche, darinnen eine Sprache von der andern abgeht, ins Englische iibersetzet sind.\" In his second preface he mentions his Englisch-Teutsch- Franzosisches Dictionarium of ten years previous. The first preface is dated Leipzig, May 3, 1716. Bodmer in 1720 wrote Heinrich Meister (Dec. 27) : \"Itzt bin ich beschaftigt das Englandische zu lernen, bios mit Hilf von Ludewigs Grammatik.\" This lexicon of Ludwig's was by no means complete, even in the second edition, but it was much improved after the appear- ance of Dr. Johnson's English Dictionary (1755). Many of Thomson's unusual words are not given by Ludwig till after this Barthold Heinrich Brockes' Thomson's Seasons 33 date. It is not surprising, then, that Brockes translated such expressions as the following incorrectly : S. 323 spires, 673 fall, 103 fuming, Au. 330 glomerating, 1218 sickled, Wi. 450 dark- ling, 458 attempered, 582 bickering, 700 quivered, etc. But it is not only these unusual words that Brockes has translated incorrectly; he has often made mistakes which can arise only from a limited knowledge of English. Sp. 953, \"bird of evening,\" means nightingale, not owl; Wi. 240, \"fill their pens with food,\" does not mean iliren Bauch mit Futter fullen. More often Brockes has been misled by a word similar in form to the one he is translating and has thus made some laughable errors. Wi. 236 twine of light, das getheilte Zwillingslicht, Sp. 517, con- genial soils, Hochzeits-betten, Au. 1027 is deemed, ist verdammet. Or where a word has two meanings, Brockes has selected the wrong one and thus has changed the sense of the verse. Sp. 376 springs of life, Lebens-Federchen. Sp. 423, Wi. 27, numbers, die Zahlen. In some cases the trans- lator has completely misunderstood the English and has made gross errors. Su. 540 Thy valleys float with golden waves In Bachen fliessen giildne Wellen Au. 115 The city rose And stretching street on street by thousands led From twining woody haunts, or the tough yew To bows strong straining, her aspiring sons. Die Stadt' entstiinden, du verlangtest Viel tausend Gassen bey einander, die du, mit vieler Kunst, verengtest Aus der verwachsnen Walder Gipfeln, und, aus dem zahen Eibenbaum, Mit angespannten Kraften, bogest die stolzen Zweig' in einen Baum. VIII. AUGMENTATION. In the 1730 edition of the Seasons there are 4,343 verses; Sp. 1,087, Su. 1,206, Au. 1,269, Wi. 781. In order to reproduce these in German, Brockes has used some 3,880 verses of eight accents and 472 of four, together 4,352 verses. From the sim- ilarity in the number of lines it would seem that the translation was close, with but few additions or amplifications. This is, -3 34 Stewart however, not at all the case. Although Brockes sought to make a verse-f or-verse translation, it will be seen that he has increased the length of the poem greatly when his verse form is considered. Thomson has used nothing but blank verse, hence his poem contains 21,715 feet. Brockes has required 32,168 feet to repro- duce these, an increase of 10,458 feet, or nearly 50 per cent. This difference is partly accounted for by the greater length of German words, but still in the first 210 lines of Spring Thomson has used 1,530 words and Brockes 2,033, an increase of 503 — 32 per cent. This is not as large an increase as that indicated in the number of feet, but still we cannot expect to find a literal translation. It is well known that the uninflected English language is shorter than the German and that it is difficult to render the complete thought of an English verse into German with the same number of syllables. In the discussion of the blank verse translations, it will be shown how the various writers have struggled with this problem and how the Seasons has suffered in consequence of this difference between the two languages. How can this discrepancy in length between the original and Brockes' translation be accounted for ? The difference in length between English and German is not a sufficient reason, and therefore we must expect to find that Brockes has expanded his work and added to it some of his own ideas; or, as Wieland expresses it: \"Brockes hat ein Wort in ganzen Perioden iibersetzt.\" (Wieland, Gesprache, vol. XIII., p. 494.) This amplification Brockes has accomplished in various ways, the most common being a verse-for-verse translation so arranged that the first part of Thomson's verse to the cesura is expanded to form the first half of Brockes' double verse and the part after the cesura forms the second half of the double-line or the second rhythmical group. The arrangement is as follows : 1 I 2 5 accents 4 4 accents Barthold Heinrich Brookes' Thomson's Seasons 35 Sp. 47 The harrow follows harsh, and shuts the scene. Die rauhe Ege folgt darauf, die denn des Schauspiels Vorhang schliesset. Sp. 187 'Tis silence all, And pleasing expectation. Die Stille herrschet tiberall, Und ein vergniiglich-holdes Warten. Not only are isolated verses (i. e., where the verse is a complete sentence without grammatical connection with the preceding or succeeding line) treated in this manner, although the method is clearer here, but also a large number of the lines of the poem, and the amplification is for the most part thus to be accounted for. Su. 15 Come, Inspiration from thy hermit seat By mortal seldom found, may fancy dare, From thy fixed serious Muse, and raptured eye Shot on surrounding Heaven, to steal one look, Creative of the poet, every power Exalting to an ecstacy of soul. Komm, heilge Begeisterung, von dem einseidlerischen Sitz, Bey Menschen selten nur gef undent Vermochte Phan- tasie und Witz, Von deiner ernstlichen Betrachtung und deinem Auge, das entziickt, Wenn es den ausgespannten Himmel, der alle Ding' um- schrankt, erklickt Doch einen Blick, der, einen Dichter zu bilden, fahig ist, zu stehlen! Erheb' in mir ein' jede Kraft bis zur Entziickung meiner Seelen! Less frequently Brockes has expanded part of a verse to two rhythmical groups, i. e., a complete double verse. Sp. 710. Claps his glad pinions. Da dann sein frb'hliches Gefieder der grosse Vater schwingend drehet. Au. 805. What nations come and ge? Wie viele Nationen kommen, wie viele derselben wieder gehnf Amplification is not always confined to a single verse or part of a verse, but it often occurs in connection with several lines or parts thereof; in Sp. 11-18, 35 measures in the original equal 68 in the translation; Sp. 721-725, 21 feet in the original equal 48. a. Repetition of an Idea. 36 Stewart When Brockes found that he had part of a rhythmical group, or, indeed, a whole line to fill out, he did not hesitate to repeat the thought in other words (cf. Additions, p. 36). Sp. 45 and liberal throws the grain Into the faithful bosom of the ground er gisset In einem gleichsam trocknen Eegen die Saat, und wirft, mit milder Hand, Das Korn in den getreuen Busen der Erd', in das ge- brochne Land. Wi. 89 The crested cock, with all his female train, Pensive and wet. Der mit dem Kamm geschmiickte Hahn, Mit feuchten, ganz zerzausten Federn, scheint jetzt in ein betriibtes Denken, Mit seiner nassen Weiber Schaar, sich melancholisch zu versenken. &. Verbs added in the translation, which are omitted in the original. Thomson's style is in some respects quite brief; he often expresses in a word or phrase a thought which in the translation requires a whole sentence. Many times he uses clauses or exclamations without verbs, thus obtaining a brevity which is very effective. In these, almost without exception, Brockes has supplied the verbs and the other necessary grammatical parts of the sentence, thus greatly lengthening his translation. Su. 404 now fretting o 'er a rock, Now scarcely moving through a reedy pool Now starting to a sudden stream, and now Gently diffused into a limpid plain; Theils reibt es sich an einem Stein, Theils sieht man es, nicht ohne Miih, durch dick-beschilfte Pf iitzen gehn, Bald vor ein schnelles Wasser stutzen, bald in der Wiesen hellem Schein Vergniiglich durch einander wandern. The endeavor to render clearly what seemed to him vague and dark in the original has led Brockes to many an expansion and circumlocution which detract from the vigor and beauty of the poem. Sp. 464 The negligence of nature, wide and wild Die Natur, Barthold Heinrich Brockes' Thomson's Seasons 37 Die recht verschwendrisch hier, ins wilde, die Bunten Schatze urn sich spreitet Su. 753 who for a single cruise Of unavailing water paid so dear der zwanzig tausend Thaler gab Fur einen Krug ihm unniitz Wasser c. Compound words simplified. Also characteristic of the Seasons are the compound words which the author has coined. As these generally consist of an adverh and an adjective, adverb and participle or adjective and participle, Brockes could not easily translate them literally, but had to expand them in various ways. Sp. 51 world-reviving sun, 0 Sonne, deren Schein die Welt belebt. Sp. 114 dry-blowing, mit diirrem Hauch. Sp. 495 many-hued, gefarbt mit mancher Farben Lieblich- keit. d. Adjectives expanded to clauses. Brockes has expanded not only verses and phrases but also single words, for which he has substituted phrases and clauses or even whole sentences. In the case of adjectives he is espe- cially verbose in order to express the exact shade of meaning of his original as he understood it. The following examples show how this amplification is accomplished : Sp. 199 dimply pool, Teich, worin sie kleine Grttbgen pragen. Sp. 689, giddy verge, bis dass ein Schwindel sie ergreift. Sp. 454, turgent, sie strotzet recht. Much less frequently, nouns and verbs are thus expanded: Wi. 92 recounts his simple frolic, prahlerisch erzahlet, wie er sich hie und da vergniiget. Wi. 116 day of tempest die zeit, wenn ihr aus eurem Sitze brecht. Sp. 790 Britain bled, die stets mit Blut besprutzten Britten. Sp. 510 Hail! Nur Dir sey Ehre, Lob und Preis! e. Words repeated. ADJECTIVE. More frequently Brockes has not reproduced the whole idea in second form, but has repeated important words, especially adjectives, nouns and verbs. The Seasons is sometimes criticised as being overloaded with adjectives and it must be admitted Stewart that Thomson used the adjective more frequently than any other part of speech. I shall not attempt any elaborate defense of Thomson's adjectives; suffice it to say that he had great talent in their use and that in the skillful treatment of this class of words lies his chief charm as a descriptive poet. But if Thomson is criticised for using too many adjectives, what is to be said of Brockes, who, not content with translating the abundance of modifiers in his original, has added several hundred? Spring, in the 1730 edition, contains about 1,039 modifiers and in Brockes' Fruhling there are 1,216, an addition of 177 — 17 per cent. Sometimes Brockes adds adjectives to those he translates. Sp. 402 the prowling herd, der so wilden, frassigen, ergrimmt-und rauberischen Schaar. Su. 559 bold, firm and graceful are thy generous youth, Beherzt und stark, und schon, und munter sind deine braven, jungen Leute. NOUNS. The repetition of nouns is much less frequent, although many measures of the Jahreszeiten are thus filled out. Sp. 193 mountains, vales and forests seem to demand, Es scheinen gar die Berge, Walder, die Thaler, Auen, Wiesen, Felder zu erbitten. Sp. 783, his sportive lambs, Die Lammer und die jungen Bocke. Sp. 1065, some new charm, eine neue Art von Liebreiz und Voll- kommenheit. The tendency increased in Brockes' later works, till some of his poems are little more than lists of names. VERBS. Verbs are repeated about as frequently as nouns. Su. 183, beam forever, bestandig leuchten, strahlen, funkeln. Su. 840, disturbs the flood, der die Fluth erhebet, peitschet und erschiittert. /. The present participle rendered by a clause. Another method of expansion frequently used by Brockes is the reproduction of a participle by a phrase or clause. In the Seasons this verbal form is often used as an adjective. In this case it is difficult to use the corresponding form in German iambics.23 Where the present participle is used verbally the English idiom cannot be rendered in German, but must be para- phrased. Brockes has taken advantage of both circumstances to 23 Cf. discussion of hexameter translation, p. 110. Barthold Heinrich Brookes' Thomson's Seasons 39 fill out his long line. This accounts for many of the added measures of the Jahreszeiten. In the following examples the present participle is expanded to a phrase or clause : Wi. 45 Retiring to the verge of Heaven the sun Scarce spreads o'er Aether the dejected day. So breitet die entfernte Sonne, die bey des Himmels \"Wirbel steckt, Kaum den betriibten Tag zu uns, der in die Liifte sich zerschiaget. Wi. 524, pretending sleep, wie, oder, that als ob sie schlief. The present participle used as adjective is treated on page 58. g. The past participle. The translation of the past participle is not so troublesome, as its idiomatic use is quite similar in the two languages. Gott- sched in his Sprachlcunst (p. 374) (483) objected to the use of the participles in such cases as: dieses sehend, sprach er; erschrecket durch deine Worte, kann ich dir nichts antworten, but he allowed : sterbend ging er, lebend kam er wieder. Sp. 118, engendered by the hazy north, erzeugt vom feuchten Nord. Sp. 130, involved in smoke, in Schmauch verwickelt. Su. 887, ox half -raised, der Ochs' halb aufgestanden. Still even in many such cases Brockes was led to expand, chiefly on account of his tendency to insert missing verbs ; these are generally taken from Thomson's participles. Au. 110 Hence every form of cultivated life In order set, protected and inspired, Into perfection wrought. Hieraus entstehen alle Formen von einem angenehmen Leben, Die du uns nur allein gegeben. Hiedurch sind sie in Ordnung kommen, sie sind be- schiitzt, und, wie erdacht, Auch zur Vollkommenheit gebracht. 9. ADDITIONS. Brockes might be forgiven for thus expanding his translation on the ground that it was necessary to fill out his long line, if he had not carried it to such great extent and thereby destroyed the simplicity of his original. Thomson's style may be inflated and the Seasons somewhat verbose, the pictures may be vague and 40 Stewart obscured by details, but in spite of the long periods and inverted sentence order there is a charming simpleness in his diction and the thought is for the most part clear. In the lengthened form of the translation, Brockes has managed to destroy this charm and to make the style complex and stiff, so that Horn was right in his criticism of this work: \"Bei dieser Ausgabe findet man eine metrische Uebersetzung, die man kaum mehr verstehen kann.\" Introduction to his edition of Die Jahreszeiten, p. LXVI. But not content with thus destroying so much of the beauty of the Seasons, Brockes has committed the sin unpardonable in a translator and has inserted many ideas of his own. His repe- tition of nouns and verbs has already been mentioned. This is not such a great detriment, it simply weakens his style and makes it stiff and tiresome, but it does not alter the sense of the original greatly, as the words added are generally synonyms. The addi- tion of adjectives is, however, more serious, as it seldom happens that two adjectives are exactly synonymous; there will always be a shade of difference not found in the original. It is, however, not so much in the addition of single words that Brockes is to be criticised, but rather because he has inserted whole verses that are not repetitions of the thought as above mentioned (p. 23), but are entirely original. Sp. 554 When listening Philomela deigns To let them joy. Indessen lauscht die Nachtigall, Gonnt ihnen ihre Lust, aus Grossmuth, zahniet ihren siegerischen Sehall, Durch den sie aller Vogel Lieder befugt und fiihig zu verlachen. Au. 1029 The waving brightness he Curious surveys, inquisitive to know The causes and materials, yet unfixed, Of this appearance beautiful, and new. Den Schimmer, welcher wallend flammet Bemerekt er, voller Neubegier, Er untersucht den Grund zu finden, Und die Materialien des Luft-Gesichtes zu ergrunden. Doch werden bey ihm keine Sorgen, noch bange Furcht- samkeit entdecket, Weil ihm des Glanzes Schon und Neuheit nieht die geringste Furcht erwecket. Barthold Heinrich Brookes' Thompson's Seasons 41 10. OMISSIONS AND CONTRACTIONS. With Brockes' tendency to amplification and the necessity of filling out the double verse form it might be expected that there would be but few omissions and contractions. But such occur and not only are single words left out, but also sentences and whole thoughts. Examples of passages omitted. Su. 457 Backward to mingle in detested war, But foremost when engaged the turn to death, 2* Au. 448 he stands at bay; And puts his last weak refuge in despair. In many cases these omissions occur because Brockes did not understand the original ; in other cases the part omitted is simply a repetition of the thought, hence the translation suffers no loss in clearness. Sp. 369 Clear was the temperate air; an even calm Perpetual reigned. Ein' ebne Still regierte stets. Contractions are even rarer; indeed, they are often only ap- parent contractions. Where three lines of the original are reproduced by two, or four lines by three, the translation is no shorter, for in the first case Brockes has used 16 measures to render 15, and in the second case in place of 20 there are 24. Au. 395 But lavish fed, in nature's bounty rolled, To laugh at anguish, and rejoice in blood, Is what your horrid bosoms never knew. Und die ihr, wenn ihr durch die Huld der milderern Natur euch nahrtet, Von Angst zu lachen, und mit Blut euch zu ergetzen, nicht begehrtet. Brockes has often taken advantage of the ease with which noun compounds can be formed in German and rendered a phrase by this means. Sp. 4 shower of roses, Eosen-Eegen. Sp. 959 messenger of love, Liebes-Brief. 2* A misprint for: to turn the death. MORTON COLLINS STEWART. Union College.

Vigfusson, Gudbrand and Powell. Corpus poeticum Boreale. Oxford. 1883. The relation of Loddfafnir to Odin in the Old Norse Hava- mal has long been a mooted question. This question is fraught with many difficulties which even the most learned of 0. N. scholars have not been able to solve satisfactorily. 'In deter- mining this question there is, however, one very important fac- tor upon which sufficient stress has not been laid. In v. 163 of the Havamal (Norroen Fornkvcedi, Sophus Bugge. Christiania. 1867), Odin refuses to divulge to Loddfafnir the eighteenth and last of the magic songs (fimbulljoft) in which Loddfafnir has been receiving instruction from the god. If the nature of this magic song can be discovered, it will throw additional light not only upon the nature of Odin in the Ljoftatal, but also upon the character of the pupil who is receiving instruction from him. There are two theories in regard to the authorship of these magic songs — namely, one that the speaker is the god Odin him- self, the other that the speaker is the pupil Loddfafnir, who claims to have heard in the Hall of the High One these songs, which are in reality, however, nothing but his own invention that he attempts, under the guise of feigned wisdom, to foist upon a credulous audience. The former theory is held by the eminent Scandinavian scholars, Sophus Bugge and Finnur Jons- son, the latter by the celebrated German scholar, Karl Mullen- The Relation of Loddfdfnir to Odin 43 hoff. Both theories are largely due to the interpretation laid upon the structure of the Loddfafnismal and its relation to the Eunatal and the Ljffftatal. Bugge holds (323 ff., 361 ff.) that all three lays (vv. 111-164) originally formed a single poem and that V. Ill originally intro- duced the Riinatal (vv. 138-145), while the Loddfafnismal was a later interpolation. The position of the Loddfafnismal, di- rectly following V. Ill, he considers due to the fact that line 8 of this strophe — ne of rfyom \\Qg\\o — which refers to the inter- pretation of runes, was misunderstood by the scribe as referring to advice (rfy) which Loddfafnir is to receive. In the Eunatal, Odin tells the story of his hanging upon \"the windy tree/' and instructs Loddfafnir in the use of magic runes; therefore, the words addressed to Loddfafnir in the LjoSatal, which is a part of the same original poem as the Eunatal, must also have been spoken by Odin. The last strophe (164) of the Havamal forms the conclusion of Odin's speech to Loddfafnir and is, therefore, rightly placed at the end of the LjoSatal and not at the end of the Loddfafnismal, which was a later extension of the original poem Eunatal— LjoSatal (111. 138-145. 146-164). A silimar division is made by Vigfusson (corp. poet. I, 23 ff.). Miillenhoff, on the other hand (252 ff., 266 ff., 270 ff.), makes three distinct poems of Bugge's original one, and brings the last strophe (164) in direct connection with the Loddfafnismal, which he considers as the Havamal proper. By this arrangement Miillenhoff is forced to connect V. Ill directly with the Lodd- fafnismal and to explain the nature of the advice given in this lay as due to the invention of a skilful minstrel, who with coarse and ironic buffoonery charges himself with practical wisdom, which he claims to have received from the god Odin. Bugge considers the speaker in all three lays as Odin him- self, and explains the coarse platitudes in the Loddfafnismal, so out of keeping with the dignified atmosphere of the Eunatal and the Lj6tSatal, on the ground that the Loddfafnismal is a later extension of these two lays (V. 111. 138-164.) and that the ad- 44 Sturtevant vice given Loddfafnir is not the invention of a \"flunkerer,\" but the serious counsel of a wise god. That the speaker in the LjoSatal is Odin, and not Loddfafnir, Bugge (361 ff.) has clearly shown. He also makes clear to what extent Mullenhoff is forced to mutilate the original form of the Codex Regius by the assumption that Loddfafnir is the speaker, for in this case Mullenhoff must not only separate vv. 146-163 (Lj65atal) from vv. 138-145 (Eunatal), which precede the former in the manuscript, but also from v. 164, and finally he must strike out, in v. 162, those lines which are addressed to Loddfafnir. The intimate connection between the Loddfafnismal on the one hand and the Eunatal-LjoSatal on the other, both in their direct sequence in the Codex Regius and in their inner relation (as wisdom imparted by the High One) render Bugge's ground far more tenable than that of Mullenhoff. If Odin is the speaker in the LjoSatal, why deny him this function in the Loddfafnis- mal? Bugge answers this question satisfactorily (326 ff.) by meeting every argument in regard to the speaker in the Lodd- fafnismal. Mullenhoff says (267) : \"Loddfafnir ist ein flun- kerer wie nur einer seines gleichen und macht daraus kein hehl : er bedient sich der fiktion und erhabenen einkleidung nur, um seiner werten zuhorerschaft einen possen zu spielen.\" Bugge's answer to this is that neither the trivial advice given in v. 112, nor the reference to the proper treatment of guests and to hos- pitality towards strangers and beggars in w. 132, 135, suggest in any way that Loddfafnir is himself a poor beggar-minstrel who is here indulging in ironical self-satire. When Odin says, in v. 134, \"never laugh at an aged minstrel\" — at Jidrom }>ul — Mullenhoff believes that this \"aged minstrel\" signifies, or at least includes, the minstrel Loddfafnir. \"No one can believe,\" says Bugge, \"that even a boastful 'flunkerer' could have Odin warn him not to laugh at himself.\" Finally the line, Hava hgllu i, in w. Ill and 164, denoting the place where Loddfafnir receives these mystical instructions from Odin, is supported by an anal- ogous situation in Snorre's Gylfagynning (I, 36; II, 253). The Relation of Loddfdfnir to Odin 45 Mullenhoff's plight is best seen (276 ff.) in his forced inter- pretation of vv. 162 and 164. In v. 162, Loddfafnir is told that he will long be without these songs of his master which will enable him to retain the love of a young woman, and is taunted with the assurance that they would be useful if he could get them. This is (according to Miillenhoff) a trick played upon the minstrel Loddfafnir, evidently because, after the first half of the strophe, the speaker has moral scruples against telling Loddfafnir any- thing more about magic love-songs, and because the speaker's own thoughts and words here fail him. In fact, in v. 163 the speaker finally refuses to divulge anything at all concerning the nature of the last (eighteenth) magic song (which he is to keep for his wife or for his sister), so that Loddfafnir in the end is completely duped and must go away without the coveted knowl- edge. In this verse (163) the speaker is satisfied with assuring Loddfafnir of his superior wisdom, but at the same time the poet forgets that it is really Odin who is supposed to be Lodd- fafnir's teacher, and yet the poet makes v. 164 (which infers that Loddfafnir heard these words in the Hall of the High One) follow as the concluding strophe of the whole poem. Bugge, on the other hand, holds (324, Note 1) that the songs (Ijofta ]>essa) mentioned in v. 162, which Vigfusson (Corp. poet. I, 20, 28) would remove entirely from the Lj65atal, have refer- ence not merely to the preceding lines in the same strophe, but to all the Ijoft mentioned in v. 146 and enumerated in the follow- ing strophes 146-162. That Loddfafnir is again addressed di- rectly after the seventeenth song is due to the fact that Odin wishes to keep from Loddfafnir the eighteenth and last magic song. From MullenhofPs interpretation of vv. 162, 163, it would appear to be his contention that if Odin really were the speaker he would not be satisfied with merely assuring Loddfafnir of his superior wisdom (v. 163), but would divulge his knowledge as a proof of it, and that, therefore, the speaker is not Odin himself, but a literary invention of a clever minstrel. I do not believe that the attitude attributed by Miillenhoff to Odin is justifiable. 46 Sturtevant No satisfactory answer has ever yet been given either as to the nature of this eighteenth song in v. 163 or as to why the speaker refuses to divulge it. V. 163 reads as follows : bat kann ec ib atianda, er ec seva kennig mey ne mannz kono, — alt er betra er einn um kann, Hat fylgir lioCa locom, — nema beirri einni, er mie armi verr eba min syster se. This eighteenth I know which never I shall tell to maid or man's wife, — 'tis far better for one alone to know, this is the end of my songs — save to her alone who shall embrace me, or to my own sister. 'Detter und Heinzel\" (p. 150) refer to this passage as ob- scure: \"Der Inhalt ist dunkel.\" Felix Niedner (p. 4) con- siders the strophe as a literary invention on the part of the poet, which has its precedent in the Vegtamskvfoa, v. 12. He agrees, then, with Miillenhoff that Loddfafnir and not Odin is the speaker here, and that Loddfafnir is simply availing himself of a conventional literary form which is used in other Eddie poems in connection with Odin's wisdom : \"dass wir es nicht mit Reden Odins an Loddfafnir sondern mit solchen Loddfafnirs, die er seinen Zuhorern gegeniiber vorgiebt von Odin empfangen zu haben, zu thun haben, spricht schon das zeugniss der auch sonst, z. B. bei der VegtamskviSa, gut orientierten Papierhandschrif- ten.\" Although Niedner agrees that Odin is elsewhere the speaker in the Lj6$atal, yet he considers this strophe (v. 163) as the lit- erary device of a \"flunkerer,\" \"der sich der fiktion und erhabenen einkleidung nur bedient, um seiner werten zuhorerschaft einen The Relation of Loddfafnir to Odin 47 possen zu spielen.\" But the situation is entirely different in the VegtamskviSa from that in strophe 163 of the Lj6Satal. In the VegtamskviSa, Odin asks the \"vylva\" a question which in itself in no wise reveals his identity. He asks, v. 12 : Hveriar 'ro ]?8er meeyjar, 8er at muni grata ok a himin verpa lialsa skautum? Who are the maids that bitterly weep and sling the sail-sheets high in the air? There is nothing in this question to reveal Odin's identity. But is there nothing to reveal his identity in v. 163 of the LjoSatal? I believe that both these passages are reflections of the Vafyrjfynismal, v. 54, 11. 4-6, in which Odin, who has ap- peared before the giant under the guise of an assumed name, suddenly reveals his identity by asking a question which no one knows except himself. In the case of the VegtamskvitSa we have, to be sure, a mere conventional imitation of the same motif in that here Odin's question, though having no connection with his own character or personality, produces the effect of revealing his identity. But in v. 163 of the Ljoftatal we have an actual means of discovering Odin's identity. In the Vafyrujmismdl, v. 54, 11. 4-6, Odin asks the giant Vaf J?ru]?mr : Hvat m§lti OSinn adr a bal stigi, sialfr i eyra syni? What spake Odin into his son's ear ere he stepped on the pyre? No one on earth knows the answer to this question but Odin himself, since his son Balder has long ago been dead. The giant VafJ>rii)mir recognizes immediately that it is Odin with whom he has been contesting, and acknowledges his defeat by his inabil- 48 Sturtevant ity to answer an impossible question. He says in the last strophe of the lay: \"no man knows what thou in days long past didst whisper into thy son's ear; now I see 'tis Odin with whom I have been contesting in words of wisdom. Thou art ever the wisest of men/' So, too, in the \"Hervarar saga ok Heiftreks Iconungs\" (C. VI, 263), which in the passage in question is based upon the Vaf J?ru]?nismal, Odin asks the same question of King HeiSrek : \"Hvat mcelti Oftinn i eyra Baldri cfyr Jiann var a bdl um borinn?\" HeiSrek answers: \"The words thou didst speak no one knows but thee alone.\" So, too, in a corrupted passage in the \"Ketilssaga Jiceings\" (C. IV) and in the \"Fornaldar sQgur\" (II, 125) this question appears as a symbol of that which is impossible to answer: \"Tiuat er ]>at at bdl segir bani flag]>i.\" This question, then, the answer to which no one knows except Odin himself, serves to reveal completely and without mistake his identity. Why does Odin wish to keep from Loddfafnir the eighteenth magic song? There is one secret in the world which he will reveal to no man, and that is the secret which he spake into the ear of Balder upon the funeral pyre. Whatever this may have been; whether Odin's words were a reflection of Christian influence, as Bugge believed (p. 64), and had reference to the resurrection of the son Christ after his death upon the cross, or whether they referred to the pagan doctrine of the new life after Eagnargk, in which Balder returns to earth again, these words belonged to Odin alone, and as such are a secret with him. In the Vaf J?riiJ?- nismal he proves himself to be the wisest of all men. In the VegtamskviSa he is the father of magic song, v. 3 (galldrs fyftur). As the wisest of gods and men, and as master of witchcraft and magic song, Odin instructs the pupil, Loddfafnir. In strophe 163 he refuses to give his pupil instruction in things to which he alone is secret. Thus he makes a fitting conclusion to his long array of magic songs by bringing Loddfafnir to realize that it is the all-wise god Odin who is his master. He does this by hinting at that secret which no one knows but himself. Odin never The Relation of Loddfdfnir to Odin 49 reveals his identity by a direct statement, but always by this indi- rect method of characterization, which cannot fail of recognition. The words he spake into Balder's ear may very well have referred to the new life in which Balder is to return to earth again, and Odin could very well have transformed these words into a magic formula (fimbulljoft) . The future life with its inscrutable mys- tery is well suited as a subject for a magic song. The last of all the magic songs thus contains the great mystery of the universe. It is the Allfather alone who knows this mystery. His refusal to divulge it is in keeping with the mystical character and dignified tone of the Eiinatal and LjoSatal. He is the all-wise and omnip- otent God, and as such he shrouds the last of his instructions in the deepest mystery of all. His personality and identity are unmistakable when he refers to an event to which he and the dead alone are privy. Thus the refusal to divulge this last magic song is not the imitation of a mere literary convention, as in the VegtamskviSa, but an instance of Odin's method of revealing his identity as genuine as in the VafJ?ru]?nismal itself. If in the last magic song there were nothing by which Odin could be iden- tified, or which could in any way be connected with his person- ality, then it might be conceivable, as Miillenhoff believes, that Loddfafnir (as the speaker) merely avails himself of a literary tradition concerning Odin, as in the VegtamskviSa. But that a means of identification does actually exist is shown by the fact that Odin in the Yaf]?ruJ?nismal is in possession of a secret which not even the wisest of giants possesses. Why attribute, then, Odin's refusal to divulge a secret which he alone possesses to a mere conventional literary form? Odin's refusal to divulge this secret is as natural as his desire to defeat the giant Vaf J>rii)mir by asking him an impossible question. In both instances he dis- plays his superiority in wisdom. In instructing his pupil, Lodd- fafnir, he thus takes occasion to show his mastery over the whole world of magic song and witchcraft by still keeping in secret the greatest of all mysteries, which only he and the god Balder ever have known. In the last three lines of this strophe (163) Odin says that 50 Sturtevant no one shall learn this secret from him except his wife or his sister : Nema heirri einni, er mic armi verr eha min systir se. Save to her alone who shall embrace me, or to my sister. Felix Niedner (p. 6, Note 1) holds that these lines are the literary fiction of Miillenhoff's \"flunkerer,\" since Odin's wife, Frigg, according to the testimony of the Lokasenna (v. 29), knows the destiny of all things (gll orlgg), and since there is no evidence that Odin ever had a sister. Any fiction to this effect, he says, would be in the mouth of the highest God a joke of the most insipid character. \"Ich verstehe aber nicht, wie Bugge und Jonsson bei ihrer Ansicht die v. 163, als echten Abschluss beibehalten konnen: denn wenn Odin am Schhiss sagt, er wolle se"
