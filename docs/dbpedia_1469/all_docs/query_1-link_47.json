The Advertising Department presents the names of corporations, firms and individuals who are making Vancouver the great city that it is, and who are a power in the financial, industrial and commercial world of Western Canada. The Miscellaneous Section in the front part of the volume, containing up-to-date statistics and information, much of which is not to be found else- where in print. The value of the street section is not appreciated, perhaps, by some who desire to find a certain house on a street unfamiliar to them to the extent it should be. By application of the following example the location of any street number can be found expeditiously: Suppose 428 Georgia Street is wanted: refer to street section Georgia Street — glance down to 428, then to the nearest intersection to 428. It will be found that this number is on the south side of the street, three houses east of Homer, between Homer and Richards Streets. The Classified Directory contains a complete alphabetically arranged list of all articles manufactured and sold in Vancouver, which forms a most efficient wholesale and retail buyer's guide. The Directory this year contains more pages, but is not as large as the 1918 edition, owing to the fact that thinner paper has been used. The Vancouver Directory is placed in the Directory and Public Libraries throughout the United States and Canada, where it serves the public as a valuable book of reference and the city it represents as a splendid standing advertisement, for no other publication can convey such an idea of the city, its business interests and all the various institutions and organizations. Few people realize what splendid publicity this affords the City and its Industries. The Directory method of estimating population is to multiply the indivi- dual names the Directory contains by a common multiple. The figures given below are more in the nature of a calculation. A complete census only can give definite and accurate figures. 1919 POPULATION OF GREATER VANCOUVER, 173,283 It is estimated that there are 15,000 Orientals not included in the above.' These figures deal with Greater Vancouver, and are an estimate only, based upon the number of names the Directory contains. It is not a census. The Publishers desire to thank their patrons and the general public for the courtesy extended at all times to their representatives, and to say t"
