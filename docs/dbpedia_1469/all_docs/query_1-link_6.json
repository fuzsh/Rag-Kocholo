        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nChronic pancreatitis (CP) is a disease manifested by severe inflammation, progressive fibrosis, intense pain, and eventually loss of exocrine (i.e., fat and protein malabsorption) and endocrine (i.e., diabetes) function of the pancreas. Disorders of the exocrine pancreas affect over 1 million persons in the United States and cost nearly $3 billion annually. During the past decade, diseases of the exocrine pancreas have resulted in 277,000 hospitalizations and 475,000 ambulatory care visits per year. Nearly 25 % of these hospitalizations and outpatient visits are due to chronic pancreatitis. In addition, patients with chronic pancreatitis are at greater risk of developing pancreatic cancer, which results in more than 35,000 deaths annually and is the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the United States1.\n\nClinical diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is based currently on identifying advanced functional, morphological, and histological features. However, the tissue damage and fibrosis are often irreversible by the time that objective diagnostic features appear. Pancreatic biopsy for histologic diagnosis is not recommended due to potential complications, such as bleeding and fistulae formation, as well as the possibility of sampling error. Currently, pancreas function testing is the non-histological “surrogate” gold standard that is used to diagnose moderate to late stage chronic pancreatitis2. The degree of pancreatic dysfunction is determined by measuring specific concentrations of cellular secretory components, typically bicarbonate, in pancreatic fluid following hormone stimulation3. The ability to diagnose chronic pancreatitis prior to irreversible organ dysfunction would revolutionize treatment and potentially lead to therapies designed to retard or modify disease progression before irreversible damages to the pancreas become apparent.\n\nPancreatic fluid is an excellent source of potential protein biomarkers for the diagnosis of early chronic pancreatitis. As a proximal body fluid, pancreatic juice is rich in proteins that are shed directly from the pancreas during the cell necrosis which is prevalent in the course of chronic pancreatitis. Changes in the protein expression patterns specific to pancreatic fluid collected from diseased patients can be identified using high-throughput proteomic technologies, such as mass spectrometry. Using mass spectrometric techniques, qualitative and quantitative changes in pancreatic fluid protein profiles can be determined. Proteomic alterations may reflect the underlying mechanisms of disease that have yet to progress to fibrosis or pancreatic insufficiency and may offer a means for amelioration or retardation of the disease.\n\nTo date, several mass spectrometry-based proteomic investigations of pancreatic fluid have been performed using specimens collected surgically or via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)4–12. In contrast, we use the well-established secretin-stimulated ePFT (endoscopic pancreatic function test) collection method, which is less invasive compared to ERCP and surgery. ePFT permits the safe collection of 10-fold larger volumes of pancreatic fluid without cannulation of the pancreatic duct, thus reducing the risk of post-procedure acute pancreatitis. Secretin stimulates bicarbonate secretion from pancreatic duct cells13, 14 and essentially flushes out the proteins, and potentially protein plugs, present in the pancreatic acini and duct. These advantages support ePFT as an exceptional fluid collection method for the comprehensive analysis of the pancreatic fluid proteome14–19.\n\nWe present a comparative mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of pancreatic fluid from patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis and non-pancreatitis controls. Using our previously established protocol20, 21, we 1) collected pancreatic fluid from the two cohorts via the ePFT method, 2) inactivated proteases and extracted proteins via trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation, 3) fractionated proteins via one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), 4) tryptically digested proteins in-gel, 5) analyzed resulting peptides via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and 6) performed bioinformatic data processing which included: a) database searching, b) label-free quantification (spectral counting and statistical analysis thereof) and c) gene ontology and pathway analysis. We have compiled a list of statistically-significant differentially-expressed proteins between our two cohorts, which can be validated further by orthogonal methodologies, such as western blotting, ELISA and protein microarrays.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nWe have identified differentially-expressed proteins in ePFT-collected pancreatic fluid of chronic pancreatitis patients, using a GeLC-MS/MS strategy. In total, 1391 non-redundant proteins are determined to be present among 18 samples. Of these, 257 and 413 proteins are identified exclusively in the controls and chronic pancreatitis samples, respectively. In addition, label-free quantification followed by statistical evaluation determined that of the 606 common proteins, 77 are up-regulated and 38 are down-regulated in chronic pancreatitis when compared to controls. Moreover, GO analysis of these differentially expressed proteins from each cohort reveals that most of these proteins are extracellular. In terms of biological function classification, proteins with peptidase activity comprised the largest proportion (43%) of the proteins that were down-regulated in chronic pancreatitis. This result is expected as we would anticipate that a healthy pancreas would secrete digestive enzymes into the duodenum upon stimulation, however this function would be diminished in the case of a diseased fibrotic pancreas.\n\nWe classified further the identified proteins according to the pathways in which they have been previously identified. The KEGG pathway analysis of our differentially expressed proteins reveals that those up-regulated in chronic pancreatitis are identified in disease-related pathways, such as Alzheimer's disease (11 proteins), and prion disease (6 proteins). The identification of pathways indicative of diseased states unrelated to the pancreas may be a result of analogous deregulation at the biomolecular / subcellular level. Specifically, diseases for which given pathways are better understood, compared to chronic pancreatitis, have more entries in the KEGG database. In addition, those proteins that are down-regulated in chronic pancreatitis are involved in cellular homeostasis, and as such may be indicative of cellular dysfunction. Therefore, our bioinformatics analysis agrees with expected findings for chronic pancreatitis: abrogated cellular function in a diseased state, resulting in down-regulation of pancreatic proteases (enzyme insufficiency).\n\nTo expand on the KEGG pathway results, we used BioBase to search for proteins which are involved in the four main manifestations of chronic pancreatitis related to exocrine function: fibrosis, inflammation, pain, and exocrine insufficiency. The proteins found in these processes merit further investigation, and may have roles in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disease. Below we highlight several proteins from each of the four categories. Understanding the function of these proteins in relation to chronic pancreatitis may further the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms resulting in the development and progression of the disease.\n\nSeveral proteins involved in fibrosis-related pathways were determined to be exclusive to or up-regulated in chronic pancreatitis ( ). Proteins in this category include alpha-smooth muscle actin, haptoglobin, and serpin A5. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA, actin alpha 2) is an isoform of the highly conserved actin family of proteins that is involved in cell motility, structure and integrity. The alpha actin subfamily is a major constituent of the contractile apparatus, and has been shown to be highly expressed in activated pancreatic stellate cells50, 51 and may be the direct link to the development of chronic pancreatitis51, 52. Therefore up-regulation of this protein in chronic pancreatitis patients is consistent with pancreatic stellate cell activation.\n\nTable 5\n\nProteinIPI#NP#CPBayes FactorFold Change higher in CPACTA2 Actin, smooth muscleIPI00008603.104----APOA2 Apolipoprotein A-IIIPI00021854.102----C5 Complement C5IPI00032291.22611.202.73HP HP proteinIPI00431645.16945.663.45HPX HemopexinIPI00022488.1686871.663.23SERPINA5 Plasma serine protease inhibitorIPI00007221.108----TF SerotransferrinIPI00022463.199214.721.73\n\nHaptoglobin (HP protein) is identified in all 9 chronic pancreatitis patients and only 6 controls (fold change: 3.45 higher in chronic pancreatitis with a Bayes Factor of 45.66). Haptoglobin is commonly associated with liver fibrosis53 and may also play a role in the pancreatic disease, as altered post-translational modifications of this protein are involved in pathways related to pancreatic cancer54. In fact, a mass spectrometry-based assay, which analyzes the fucosylation of this protein, has been developed for pancreatic cancer. The role of this protein in chronic pancreatitis has not been determined.\n\nSerpin A5 is identified in 8 of the 9 chronic pancreatitis specimens and none of the control specimens. Serpin A5 inhibits activated protein C55,56 and plasminogen activators57 and has been shown to interact with prostate specific antigen58, and PLAU (urokinase-type plasminogen activator)59. In chronic pancreatitis, specific changes in protein C expression in the stroma of the pancreas have been shown to modulate the intracellular signaling pathways that control homeostatic mechanisms, however the specific role of Serpin A5 has not been investigated60.\n\nIn addition to these fibrosis-related proteins, several proteins involved in inflammation-related pathways were determined to be exclusive to or up-regulated in chronic pancreatitis ( ). Proteins in this category include: annexin A5, defensin 5, and neprilysin. Annexin A5 was identified in 5 of the 9 chronic pancreatitis specimens and none of the control specimens. Annexin A5 is involved in the blood coagulation cascade and inhibits the activity of protein kinase C61, 62. A previous study has identified annexin A5 in the pancreatic fluid of pancreatic cancer patients9. Interestingly, annexin A5 also inhibits the secretion of phospholipase63, 64, which is one of several pancreatic enzymes that our data shows to have a lower abundance in chronic pancreatitis verses control pancreatic fluid.\n\nTable 6\n\nProteinIPI#NP#CPBayes FactorFold Change higher in CPAHSG cDNA FLJ55606, similar to Alpha-2-HS-glycoproteinIPI00022431.202----AMBP Protein AMBPIPI00022426.199468.362.48ANXA5 Annexin A5IPI00329801.1205----APOA2 Apolipoprotein A-IIIPI00021854.102----C3 Complement C3IPI00783987.2998.4E+074.34C4B complement component 4B preproproteinIPI00418163.3354.641.95C5 Complement C5IPI00032291.22611.202.73C7 proteinIPI00642632.1560.071.58CFHR1 Complement factor H-related protein 1IPI00011264.203----DEFA5 Defensin-5IPI00008298.127149.785.24DMBT1 Putative uncharacterized protein DMBT1IPI00412044.4880.331.66DNASE1 Deoxyribonuclease-1IPI00031065.13858.914.31F11R Junctional adhesion molecule AIPI00001754.12652.353.67F2 36 kDa proteinIPI00877967.103----GC Vitamin D-binding proteinIPI00555812.43771.054.45HLA-B HLA class I histocompatibility antigen, B-73 alphaIPI00472943.102----HLA-DRA HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DR alphaIPI00005171.103----HP HP proteinIPI00431645.16945.663.45HPX HemopexinIPI00022488.1686871.663.23ICAM1 Intercellular adhesion molecule 1IPI00008494.402----LTF Growth-inhibiting protein 12IPI00298860.54720.802.28MME NeprilysinIPI00247063.3391178.295.18MUC1 Isoform 1 of Mucin-1IPI00013955.102----NT5E 5'-nucleotidaseIPI00009456.103----S100A9 Protein S100-A9IPI00027462.14952.744.09SCGB1A1 UteroglobinIPI00006705.102----SERPINB3 Isoform 1 of Serpin B3IPI00022204.21420.583.91SIRPA signal-regulatory protein alpha precursorIPI00332887.502----TF SerotransferrinIPI00022463.199214.721.73TXN ThioredoxinIPI00216298.62613.303.23VTN VitronectinIPI00298971.14713.382.49\n\nDefensin 5 is identified in 7 of the 9 chronic pancreatitis specimens and only 2 of the 9 control specimens (fold change: 5.24 higher in chronic pancreatitis with a Bayes Factor of 149.78). In addition, pro-defensin 5 has been shown to be processed to mature defensin 5 in the human intestinal lumen by trypsin, in a complex in which chymotrypsinogen is also cleaved and activated. The increase in defensin 5 may be due to persistence of this complex resulting from decreased levels of pancreatic enzymes or increased levels of protease inhibitors, such as alpha1-antitrypsin65. However, further studies are needed to clarify the roles of both proteins in possible mechanisms regulating the development and progression of chronic pancreatitis.\n\nNeprilysin (MME) is identified in 8 of the 9 chronic pancreatitis specimens and only 2 of the 9 control specimens (fold change: 5.15 higher in chronic pancreatitis with a Bayes Factor of 1176.29). MME - also known as neutral endopeptidase (NEP), CD10, and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) - (is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease enzyme that degrades a number of small secreted polypeptides of up to 30 amino acids66. In addition, MME cleaves various isoforms of angiotensin and is involved in the degradation of atrial natriuretic factor67, 68 which has been shown to stimulate pancreatic exocrine secretion by interacting with hormones that regulate pancreatic function69, 70. As such, the increase in MME is associated with an decrease in atrial natriuretic factor which in turn decreases the pancreatic exocrine secretion of digestive enzymes. In agreement with our data, the overexpression of neprilysin has been linked previously to pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer71–73.\n\nSeveral proteins involved in pain-related pathways are determined to be exclusive to or up-regulated in chronic pancreatitis ( ). Proteins in this category include: complement C3 (fold change: 4.35 higher in chronic pancreatitis with a Bayes Factor of 8.35E7) and complement C5 (fold change: 2.73 higher in chronic pancreatitis with a Bayes Factor of 11.20), both of which are involved in the adaptive immune system74, 75, in addition to neuropathic pain76. Complement C3 may be involved in a variety of pathophysiological processes in chronic pancreatitis, including deposition at the basement membrane and inhibition by TGF-beta77. Significantly, C5 has been shown to have a role in edema formation in a mouse acute pancreatitis model78. In addition to their involvement in the pain pathway, both proteins have roles in fibrosis-related pathways, while complement C5 is also involved in inflammation pathways. However, the immediate function of either protein in chronic pancreatitis has yet to be defined clearly.\n\nTable 7\n\nProteinIPI#NP#CPBayes FactorFold Change higher in CPC3 Complement C3IPI00783987.2998.35E+074.34C5 Complement C5IPI00032291.22611.202.73CAMP Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptideIPI00292532.601----ICAM1 Intercellular adhesion molecule 1IPI00008494.402----LTF Growth-inhibiting protein 12IPI00298860.54720.802.28SIRPA signal-regulatory protein alpha precursorIPI00332887.502----TXN ThioredoxinIPI00216298.62613.303.23\n\nWhile proteins that are involved in fibrosis, inflammation, and pain are identified exclusively in, or determined to be up-regulated in chronic pancreatitis, proteins having a role in digestion are down-regulated in chronic pancreatitis. We have shown that several common pancreatic enzymes, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, and aminopeptidase are down-regulated in chronic pancreatitis ( ). Such a finding is expected as pancreatic enzyme deficiency, manifested by malabsorption of proteins and fat, is generally associated with late stage chronic pancreatitis79–81. These findings not only support our study, but demonstrate that quantitative analysis of these enzymes from pancreatic fluid collected using the ePFT method, may provide criteria for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis as well as determining disease severity.\n\nTable 8\n\nProteinIPI#NP#CPBayes FactorFold Change higher in NPAMY1C;AMY1B;AMY1A;AMY2A Alpha-amylase 1IPI00300786.199284.762.07AMY1C;AMY1B;AMY1A;AMY2A Pancreatic alpha-amylaseIPI00025476.1992.67E+062.33CTRB1 Chymotrypsinogen BIPI00015133.1993.01E+042.33CTRB2 chymotrypsinogen B2IPI00515087.2991.09E+052.14CTRC Chymotrypsin-CIPI00018553.1992.45E+042.71ELA2A Elastase-2AIPI00027722.19987.381.94ELA3A Elastase-3AIPI00295663.199624.242.52ELA3B Elastase-3BIPI00307485.3991987.173.13PLA2G1B Phospholipase A2IPI00021792.1987961.393.19PNLIP Pancreatic triacylglycerol lipaseIPI00027720.1991.44E+092.25PNLIPRP2 pancreatic lipase-related protein 2IPI00005924.49839.473.43PRSS1 Putative trypsin-6IPI00169276.2983690.342.12PRSS2 Protease serine 2 isoform BIPI00011695.89954.101.79PRSS3 Isoform A of Trypsin-3IPI00015614.4992175.752.15RP11-265F14.2 Elastase-2BIPI00027723.29834.732.00RP11-265F14.2 Pancreatic elastase IIBIPI00746692.350----Similar to Elastase-3A precursorIPI00921065.1992997.682.98\n\nTo obtain a quantitative estimate of the abundance of identified proteins, we used spectral counting – a frequently-used label-free approach for quantification82. This method compares the number of MS/MS spectra for the same protein among several data sets (in the present case, 18 individuals in two cohorts). We chose to analyze our data using spectral counting, as studies have shown a strong linear correlation between relative protein abundance and sequence coverage, with a dynamic range of over two orders of magnitude83. Furthermore, spectral counting quantification has been shown to be more reproducible and have a higher dynamic range than peptide ion chromatogram-based quantification84, and is particularly useful if no labeling has been performed a priori.\n\nIn our study, we investigate proteins in pancreatic fluid collected from patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis for comparison to chronic abdominal pain controls. We did not, however, aim to investigate differences in etiology. Such analysis may reveal proteins that differ significantly in abundance among the various specific causes of chronic pancreatitis. Further comparative proteomic analysis is certainly warranted, as the molecular mechanisms directing disease pathogenesis and progression may be different among etiologies. If early detection of chronic pancreatitis is to be investigated, data for etiology-specific protein differences will be valuable. However, with our current data, we do not have the statistical power to perform such etiology-specific pancreatic fluid proteome analysis. Future investigations will require increased number of patients for both the biomarker discovery and validation phases.\n\nMoreover, a clinically useful diagnostic test must be able to discriminate between individuals with early pancreatic disease and those whose symptoms are of non-pancreatic origin. As such, future proteomic analysis must include a wider spectrum of patients, specifically those with mild and moderate chronic pancreatitis to ensure that identified biomarkers are sensitive and are not solely markers of advanced disease. In addition, longitudinal studies that investigate the progression of chronic pancreatitis in patients at different stages of disease may lend insight into the potential for tracking disease progression, complementing current radiologic and imaging techniques and may have the additional benefit of each patient serving as his/her own control.\n\nAlthough we have successfully identified a set of pancreatic proteins with statistically significant differences in abundance between cohorts of severe chronic pancreatitis patients and controls, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain unresolved. Protein target-based assays with animal models and/or cell culture must be performed to understand more clearly the mechanisms by which changes in protein expression occur. Such model systems allow the modulation of specific proteins, i.e. by overexpression or transcriptional knockdowns, and the subsequent analysis of cellular and/or physiological changes, in a controlled environment. Analogous experiments would be difficult or impossible to perform with human subjects, thus studies in animal models and cell culture, including that of pancreatic duct and stellate cells, will be necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of chronic pancreatitis and the role of the identified proteins at the cellular level.\n\nIn summary, we have identified successfully proteins that are differentially secreted in the ePFT-collected pancreatic fluid of chronic pancreatitis patients compared to non-pancreatitis controls using GeLC-MS/MS. An orthogonal methodology, such as western blotting, ELISA or targeted mass-spectrometry-based assays, may be performed to validate our findings at an individual protein level, using much larger cohorts. The use of the ePFT collection technique coupled with GeLC-MS/MS analysis of proteins extracted from pancreatic fluid has significant potential in the study of the exocrine pancreas. In fact, our study has identified the largest number of proteins from pancreatic fluid to date. Once the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential expression of these proteins have been determined, cell culture systems or animal models, such are mouse, rat, and zebrafish, may be developed to investigate further these proteins of interest in a well-controlled system. In conclusion, we have identified potential biomarkers of chronic pancreatitis, establishing a workflow which may also be applied to related proteomic studies of diseases of the exocrine pancreas."
