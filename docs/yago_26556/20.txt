Dr. Riazuddin is undoubtedly one of the most distinguished theoretical physicists of Pakistan. He has made valuable contributions to the field of high-energy physics and has brought heaps of glories to himself and his country. He has been accredited as being a pioneer in Pakistan’s nuclear development for designing theoretical and mathematical design of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. In collaboration with his teacher and mentor Dr. Abdus Salam, he formed “Theoretical Physics Group” at Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.

Born in Ludhiana, Dr. Riazuddin migrated to Pakistan and settled in Lahore along with his family. He completed his Bachelors of Science in Mathematics with Honors in year 1951 from Punjab University and went on to pursue M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics, specializing in fundamental concepts of Mathematical physics. Upon publishing his thesis in 1953, he instantly made an impact on the world of science. This earned him national reputation and he received a Gold medal from the Punjab University for post-graduate contributions to physics and mathematics.

Throughout his career, he has been awarded great honorary awards. In 2009, he was awarded lifetime achievement award by Higher Education Commission. In year 2000, he bagged two significant awards internationally, The Albert Einstein World Award of Science and UNESCO Science Prize in Physics. He also has been awarded prestigious civil awards: Sitara-i-Imtiaz and Hilal-e-Imtiaz by the government of Pakistan in year 1999.

Dr. Riazuddin made significant contribution at CERN’s LHC, where he is considered a respected theoretician. Dr. Riazuddin worked at PAEC till 2000, when he retired as a chief scientist. Right after his retirement, he was elected as a fellow of Third World Academy of Sciences and Islamic Academy of Sciences.
