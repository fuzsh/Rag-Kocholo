Eight clinched gold, 13 bagged silver, and 16 won bronze among 55 contenders from 14 Asia-Pacific countries.\n\nThe medalists comprise a mix of junior and senior high school students aged 20 years and below.\n\nGold medalists were the following: Caldras Tan Hong Xun, Caleb Chia, Tran Doan Duy Phuc, and Wong Kheng Hshin (Singapore); Mohammad Nur G. Casib and Neil Kyle Olaer Maniquis (Philippines); M N Ahamed Mushab (Sri Lanka); and Nopparuj Sodsri (Thailand).\n\nMeanwhile, silver medalists include: Nonpawit Koheng, Rawisara Chokdeepanich, and Tharatep Lertpetaiy (Thailand); Isaac Toh Thiam Tek and Lim Yee Jian (Malaysia); Subhan Kashif and Suleman Nouman (Pakistan); Pabasara Kaushalya Maduwage and W.

Casib (Philippines) for obtaining the highest points in the experimental and theoretical exams respectively. Further, Casib held the highest points overall, earning him the title “Nuclear Ambassador.”\n\nThe contestants came as teams representing their respective countries, but they competed as individuals. Further, they were ranked according to the points they obtained in the two exams in which Casib emerged as topnotcher.\n\nIn her message, Ms. Helena Zhivistkaya, expert of the Nuclear Knowledge Management Section of the IAEA Department of Nuclear Energy, reminded the contestants, “The Olympiad is not just a competition but also building long-lasting cooperation for future activities.’’ (INSO Publicity Working Team)\n\nThe silver medal winners for the 1st INSO\n\nThe bronze medal winners for the 1st INSO\n\nINSO kicks off with a blast\n\nDetails\n\nPublished: 02 August 2024\n\nDOST-PNRI Director Dr. Carlo Arcilla, serving as the Chairperson of the INSO Steering Committee, speaking at the opening ceremonies\n\nINSO kicks off with a blast\n\nThe first International Nuclear Science Olympiad (INSO) officially started on Aug 1 with a blast as the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), along with partners and other guests, welcomed the olympiad participants in the opening ceremonies held at the SMX Convention Center in New Clark City, Pampanga.\n\nThe contenders will compete in a grueling two-day examination of skills and knowledge in nuclear science. Pioneering participants include 14 countries of 54 participants with 31 team leaders, and three countries as observers.\n\n“Organizing the first ever Nuclear Science Olympiad has indeed been a challenge,” says DOST-Philippine Nuclear Research Institute Director (PNRI), Dr. Carlo Arcilla. ‘’When we accepted the invitation to host this event, we did not know how big of a feat this would be for our country, but we are delighted to see all of you here with us today as the participants of this competition that is the first of its kind.’’\n\nMeanwhile, Marina Binti Mishar from the Division for Asia and the Pacific, Department of Technical Cooperation of the International Atomic Energy Agency, describes the Olympiad as not just a gathering of participants from different nations but also of ‘’a global community united by a common goal: to explore, innovate, and push the boundaries of what is possible in the field of nuclear science.’’\n\nDOST Secretary Renato U. Solidum likewise underscored the aim of the INSO which is to increase global awareness on the peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology, particularly on how these are supportive to the current thrust of the science department which he calls the four pillars, namely human well-being, wealth creation, wealth protection, and sustainability.\n\nOne of the proudest moments of the program was when the contenders were introduced bearing their national flags. Among the roster of dignitaries present at the event were His Excellency Ambassador Ahmed Saad N.A. Al-Homidi and his staff from the embassy of Qatar, Mr. Hameed Alshammari from the Embassy of Saudi Arabia, Honorary Consul General Michael Alexander M. Ang from the Embassy of Jordan, and Mohd Fareed Zakaria, Deputy Chief of Mission from the Embassy of Malaysia.\n\nAlso recognized during the event was the designer of the organizational INSO logo, Raihana Azwa from Indonesia. Last year, the INSO as an institution ran a logo-making contest which was open to secondary school students across the Asia and the Pacific Region. Azwa’s winning design consists of a circular atom as a material representation of nuclear that surrounds the earth, which symbolizes the Olympics held in various countries.\n\nThe program was attended by INSO Chair Dr. Maya Al Azri and partner organizations represented by\n\nMs. Marina Mishar and Ms. Helena Zhivitskaya of the IAEA, Dr. Alumanda Dela Rosa of the Philippine Nuclear Science Foundation, Dr. Leila P. Areola and Mr. Jios Ver D. Temporal of the Department of Education, and Mr. Joselito Carteciano of the DOST- National Research Council of the Philippines. Dr. Jane Gerardo-Abaya, former Director for Asia and the Pacific from the Department of Technical Cooperation of the IAEA, was also at the event.\n\nFurther, event sponsors were likewise recognized such as Isaiah Taylor and Kip Mock of Valar Atomics, Neil Carlo Francisco of GN Power, Raisa Aguilar and Mary Castillo from ALV Technologies Philippines, Paul Francis Juat of ISI E-Beam, and Atty. Mariliza Kalaw of CURIO.\n\nPhilippines spearheads workshop on convention for nuclear-related civil liability with ASEAN countries\n\nDetails\n\nPublished: 11 July 2024\n\nPhilippines spearheads workshop on convention for nuclear-related civil liability with ASEAN countries\n\nTaking the lead in a renewed initiative among ASEAN countries to address the matter of civil liability in case of nuclear incidents in the region, the Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Nuclear Research Institute hosted a regional workshop by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage from July 1 to 4 at the Novotel Manila Araneta in Quezon City.\n\nThe Convention is the latest and most comprehensive to date in a wide umbrella of international agreements that provide for the liability and compensation to be paid for damages involving a nuclear incident in a nuclear installation as well as during the transport of nuclear materials.\n\nThis legal instrument covers nuclear damage not only in terms of personal injury and damage to property, but also environmental damage and other forms of economic loss. Said agreement also expands jurisdiction over civil suits, allowing victims to sue for damages in countries where a nuclear accident occurs up to the country’s exclusive economic zone.\n\nBeyond this, the Convention also provides for a comprehensive insurance scheme to cover nuclear reactors and facilities.\n\nRead more: Philippines spearheads workshop on convention for nuclear-related civil liability with ASEAN..."
