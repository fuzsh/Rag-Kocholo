        "text": "Pakistani emeritus professor of theoretical physics\n\nFayyazuddin, also spelled as Fayyaz Uddin (Urdu: فياض الدين born 10 November 1930), is a Pakistani theoretical physicist, emeritus professor, specialising in theoretical physics and mathematical physics at Quaid-e-Azam University campus National Centre for Physics, Islamabad.[1][2] He is a senior scientist at the National Center for Physics. Fayyaz is doing research in the fields of quantum mechanics, particle physics, and meson physics. He has published numerous physics papers accompanied by Riazuddin and has co-authored Quantum Mechanics by Fayyazuddin and Riazuddin published in 1990.[3][4]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nFayyazuddin is the twin brother of physicist Riazuddin, and a student of Abdus Salam.[5]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nHe and his twin brother Riazuddin were born on 10 November 1930 in Ludhiana where they received their intermediate education. Following the partition of India, the family migrated to Lahore, Pakistan. The two attended Punjab University.[6] Fayyazuddin completed his Bachelor of Arts with honors in mathematics from Punjab University and subsequently earned Master of Science in mathematical physics under the fellowship of Abdus Salam in 1953.[1] His master's degree dissertation Methods of Mathematical Physics was co-written by Riazuddin. In 1953, he became a Master of Philosophy in particle physics with the academic thesis Energy Loss of Mesons in Crystals under the fellowship of Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry from the same university.[1] Fayyaz moved to Karachi and attended the Karachi University where he became a physics lecturer.[citation needed]\n\nAfter teaching mathematics and physics at Karachi University, Fayyaz traveled to the United Kingdom in 1959. He attended Imperial College London where Abdus Salam and Riazuddin were serving as his teachers. He was awarded a PhD in theoretical particle physics under the fellowship of Abdus Salam in 1962.[1][7] Fayyaz's dissertation was written on the \"Preliminary Analysis of Photoproduction of K Mesons in the Mandelstam Representation\".[8] Fayyaz then returned to Pakistan and served at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC).[9]\n\nAcademic career\n\n[edit]\n\nFayyazuddin joined Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) in 1962 where he worked under the guidance of professor Abdus Salam[2] and continued his research on the cosmic ray mu-mesons. He published his research journal on the basis of the Bethe-Bloch theory. At that time, he published his thesis that sparked a controversy between two sets of experiments.\n\nHe undertook postdoctoral research at the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago from 1966 to 1968.[1] At the institute, Fayyaz, Faheem Hussain, Riazuddin, and Peter Rotteli, formed \"The Relativity Group\", a team of young research scientists in special relativity. In 1968, when the Institute of Physics was established at the University of Islamabad (now Quaid-i-Azam University), the scientists eagerly returned to Pakistan. Fayyazuddin, Hussain, Arif-uz-Zaman, and Sarwar Razmi, joined the Institute of Physics.[1] The institute become an active center for theoretical particle physics research due to their distinguished contribution, and its presence was recognized internationally.[1]\n\nIn 1970, he went to Great Britain, where he attended Rutherford Appleton Laboratories as an associate research scientist. In 1972, he returned to the Institute of Physics of Quaid-e-Azam University. He joined the Theoretical Physics Group under his brother's guidance and participated in Fast neutron calculations – a key calculation to develop the weapons.[10] In 1973, Fayyaz traveled to Geneva, Switzerland where he became a visiting scientist at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). In 1977, he returned to Quaid-i-Azam University as a physics professor and subsequently became the dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences. In 1980, he went to Saudi Arabia where he became a regular professor of physics at the King Saud University in Riyadh and a regular professor of physics at the Ummal Qura University in Mecca till 1996. After teaching in Saudi Arabia, he returned to Quaid-i-Azam University in 2005.[2] In 2007, Fayyazuddin joined Pakistan's National Center for Physics as a senior scientist. In 2008, he was awarded HEC Distinguished Professor award by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.[2] In 2000, the President of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf, conferred on him Pakistan's second-highest civilian award Hilal-i-Imtiaz for his contributions to the field of research in physics and science.[2]\n\nAwards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\nHilal-i-Imtiaz (Crescent of Excellence) Award by the Government of Pakistan - (2000)[6][2]\n\nHEC Distinguished Professor Award - (2007)\n\nKhawarzmi International Award in Physics - (2003)[6][2]\n\nGold Medal - Pakistan Academy of Sciences (1979)[6][2]\n\nD.
