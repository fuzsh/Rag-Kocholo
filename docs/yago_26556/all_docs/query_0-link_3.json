        "text": "The Pakistani students will be among 200 high school and college science students from all over Asia at the ASC — an annual event, held since 2005, that aims to bring together young science students from Asia and to put them in discussions with top scholars — and they will get to hear lectures by five Nobel laureates, among other experts.\n\nRiazuddin was a student of Prof Abdus Salam at Cambridge, who returned to Pakistan along with other young and talented physicists of the Enrico Fermin Institute of the University of Chicago to lay the foundation for particle physics in the country. Riazuddin was also the founder of the International Centre for Theoretical Particle Physics group at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy.\n\nHe played a crucial role in Pakistan’s nuclear program in its critical early stages and remained the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission’s board member for science, where he also initiated the International Nathiagali Summer College series that continues till date. He was also the founding Director of the National Centre for Physics in Islamabad."
