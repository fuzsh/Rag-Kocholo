        "text": "Prof. Riazuddin is a distinguished theoretical physicist who was a pupil of late Nobel Lauriate Prof. Abdus Salam (1926-2001). He is the founder of the National Center for Physics (NCP), Islamabad, and has been its director since 1999. His current research interest is focused on gauge theories and phenomenology of particle interactions. He also dedicates a great deal of his time to the promotion of science in his country.\n\nBefore becoming the Director of NCP, Prof. Riazuddin has been, successively:\n\nProfessor at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudia Arabia, from 1982 to 1998.\n\nVisiting Professor at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA from 1981 to 1982.\n\nVisiting Professor, Virginia Polytechinic Institute and State University Blacksburg, VA, USA, from 1980 to 1981.\n\nVisiting Scientist at the International Center for Theroetical Physics (ICTP), Trieste, Italy, from 1979 to 1980.\n\nMember (Technical) of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission from 1973 to 1976\n\nPrincipal Research Associate, Daresbury Nuclear Physics Laboratory, UK, 1972.\n\nVisiting Professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA, from 1970 to 1972.\n\nProfessor at the University of Islamabad (now called Quaid - e - Azam University) from 1966 to 1981.\n\nResearch Associate at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadephia, USA, from 1965 to 1966.\n\nVisiting Senior Research Assciate at the University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA, from 1963 to 1965.\n\nReader in Physics at Punjab University, Lahore, Pakistan, from 1959 to 1963.\n\nThroughout his long and distinguished scientific career, Prof. Riazuddin won many awards and honorary titles, amongst them:\n\nThe Gold Medal in Physical Sciences for Scientist of Less Than 40 Years of Age, in 1968, awarded by the Pakistan academy of Sciences (That same academy elected him a Fellow in 1976.)\n\nThe Gold Medal of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences (jointly with his brother Prof. Fayyazuddin), for outstanding research work in physical sciences in 1979.\n\nThe Tamgha-e-Imtiaz and the Hilal-i-Imtiaz by the Government of Pakistan in 1980, 1990 and 1999.\n\n13th Khwarizmi International Award (First Prize), awarded by the Iranian Government in 2000.\n\nthe UNESCO Albert Einstein Gold Medal for Fundamental Science in 2000.\n\nFellow of the Third World Academy of Sciences in 2000.\n\nFellow of the Islamic Academy of Sciences in 2000.\n\nProf. Riazuddin has also around 200 publications to his credit including the joint authorship of three books:\n\nTheory of Weak Interaction in Particle Physics, John Wiley, New York, 1969. (Written jointly with R. E. Marshak and C. P. Ryan).\n\nQuantum Mechanics, World Scientific, Singapore, 1990. (Written jointly with Fayyazuddin).\n\nA Modern Introduction to Particle Physics, World Scientific, Singapore, 1994. (Written jointly with Fayyazuddin)."
