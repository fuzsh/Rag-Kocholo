Riazuddin was one of Pakistan's top scientists and is widely known theoretical physicists in Pakistan and abroad. Starting his scientific research in physics in 1958, Riazuddin was one of the senior scientist and considered one of the early pioneers of Pakistan's nuclear weapons development and atomic deterrence development. He was the director of the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG) of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) from 1974 until 1984. Riazuddin had remained the only pupil of Nobel laureate in Physics Abdus Salam.\n\nRiazuddin carried out his international and leading-edge research from International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and Daresbury Laboratory where he published important papers in mathematics and physics. Riazuddin also played an important role in education in Pakistan, and contributed in the rise of science in Pakistan. Riazuddin authored several scientific books on particle physics and quantum mechanics. Later in his life, he joined the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) as a visiting professor of the theoretical physics. From 2004 until his death, he also served on the Board of Governors of Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS)."
