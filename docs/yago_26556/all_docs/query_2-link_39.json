        "text": "Born and raised in Long Island, New York, Saad Riazuddin developed his passion for Islamic youth work as a teenager when he was welcomed into a local youth group. There, he found his calling and a sense of belonging, which eventually inspired him to establish a youth group at the Islamic Center of Frisco (ICF) when he moved to Frisco, TX, in 2011. He served in various roles supporting the youth, including establishing and then serving as a YM Neighbor Net Coordinator and eventually as Youth Director for the ICF Youth. He also served as a board member of ICF, acting as a Shura liaison for the youth.\n\nHe has been a student at the Islamic Seminary of America under Shaykh Khalil Abdur-Rashid and Shaykh Omar Suleiman. He began his journey in education of the sacred Islamic studies at Taqwa Seminary in 2020 and graduated from the Marifa program in 2024, under the mentorship of Shaykh Arsalan Haque and Imam Abdul Rahman Bashir. He also graduated from Qalam Seminary in the Classical Arabic and Essential Islamic Sciences program and is currently continuing his education at Qalam."
