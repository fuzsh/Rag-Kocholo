        "text": "A forward-thinking professional with seven years of experience, I am motivated to take on increasing responsibilities and advance my career gradually. Currently, I am a PhD student in Earth System Science at Auburn University, Alabama, USA. As an environmental researcher, I have a proven track record of working with numerous national and international research projects funded by esteemed organizations such as CEGIS (Bangladesh), UGC (Bangladesh), BBS (Bangladesh), Pure Earth (USA), Geological Society of America (GSA) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). I am particularly eager to learn from unique perspectives and research expertise. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to collaborate with relevant organizations and welcome any queries via email.\n\nResearch Interest\n\nMy research interests primarily focus on assessing groundwater availability, quality, and environmental sustainability to manage water resources for communities, agriculture, and industry. I am developing sustainable strategies to prevent environmental contamination from hazardous pollutants such as arsenic contamination and coastal salinity intrusions. In addition, I study the effects of climate change on water resources and provide data for informed decision-making and adaptation strategies. As a GIS professional, I also assist bridge technology, geosciences, and geospatial data analysis to inform decision-making across diverse fields. My dynamic research plays a vital role in maintaining water security, protecting the environment, and promoting the well-being of the nation. Therefore, my research expertise is essential for addressing current and future water challenges, especially in the coastal regions of the United States and Bangladesh.\n\nMessage for research community\n\nFor relevant research collaboration ,I would be happy to discuss if I can work with similar research projects of my interest.Please fell free to email me if you would like to discuss about collaboration that adds value to a prospective researcher."
