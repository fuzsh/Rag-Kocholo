        "text": "Energy is a prerequisite for economic development and human welfare. This is quite evident from the fact that the per capita consumption of commercial energy in the industrialised countries is about a factor of 10 higher than that in the developing countries — roughly in the same proportion as the ratio of their respective per capita gross domestic products. Pakistan stands fairly low even among the developing countries in terms of both per capita GDP and per capita energy consumption as may be seen from the data listed in Table 1. Also compared in Table 1 are the per capita proven reserves of fossil fuels and hydro power potential in Pakistan with the average values of these resources in the developing and the industrialized countries. Obviously the present energy resource position of Pakistan is extremely precarious and the country’s present proven reserves will not be able to support for very long the commercial energy demand which has been growing in recent years at an average rate of about 8% per annum."
