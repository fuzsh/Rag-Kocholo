        "text": "Hana is a Research Assistant and PhD Candidate in Health Geography at King's College London. She is also a fiction writer and the Director of The Body Narratives, an arts organisation that supports storytelling and women of colour creatives. She is inspired by wholehearted communities and justice-led approaches to cities, living and loving.\n\nSohail: Can you tell us about your research?\n\nHana: My research looks at the impacts of urban regeneration policies and gentrification on young people's psychosocial health in South London. It’s a mixed methods project where I've done secondary analysis of the South East London Community Health Study looking at mental health outcomes, and the relationship to gentrification. The second part, which is what I'm most passionate about, is a co-productive research projectwhere I've worked with eight young people as peer researchers, looking at how they experienced gentrification and changes in their in their neighbourhoods. They used photography and we held an exhibition. We've worked as well with the South London Gallery to produce a heritage walk and map of important spaces that either have been lost to gentrification or are at risk of being lost to gentrification. So, lots of interesting collaborative moments throughout the project!\n\nSohail: That sounds really cool! What made you focus on gentrification?\n\nHana: I've spent a lot of time in the last 10 years in South London, and one of the things that really struck me was how gentrification was impacting the area, in particular the psychological and emotional impacts of it. I became really curious as to what the arguments and justifications for these urban regeneration policies were. I was really interested about what it meant for children and young people who are growing up those neighbourhoods now, and what the long term impacts might be. The London Plan really emphasised that urban regeneration was necessary for improving health and well being. But actually when you start to look at it, there was very little evidence for that. So I started to really get curious about actually what was the relationship between how cities are being designed, and regeneration and gentrification as a kind of a particular type of socioeconomic and social policy and process is driving certain changes and how that relates to health and well being.\n\nSohail: OK, so fast forward to doing your PhD. How did you then decide that a participatory approach was right for your research?\n\nHana: I guess on an epistemological and political level, thinking about what traditional academic knowledge is and how it's produced. It is very much still colonial at its roots, about who produces knowledge, what counts as knowledge. I think the participatory model is about valuing the knowledge that communities have, and I want to emphasize that in part is about lived experience – what people are living, experiencing and thinking and feeling, but also, I think what's often missing is the fact that marginalised people and communities also have the ability to theorize. This is their lives, they understand these core concepts - whether it is about class or racism, gender and sexuality, and all forms of domination and oppression. I think in that sense I kind of really wanted to centre communities and their lived experience and the knowledge that they have.\n\nSecondly, obviously it's about a redistribution of power as much as you can. I mean, anything that's housed in the academic academy will never be fully redistributed. But trying to find models and ways of doing that, whether that's producing a project that's useful to communities, whether that's providing some kind of resources and infrastructure and tools, but also even the question of like authorship and recognition. I don't see myself as the knowledge producer. I see myself as a facilitator, I help draw things together and bring people together. But I don't know everything, and I don't really have a right to say or determine their voices. It was really important for me to kind of develop and shape a project where they're at the centre of it."
