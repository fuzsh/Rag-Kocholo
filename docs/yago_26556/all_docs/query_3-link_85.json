        "text": "Some memoirs deal with the life of a person while others reveal the very life, career and passion they follow. ‘Memoirs of Riazuddin – A Physicist’s Journey’ is in the latter category. The volume is not just about the life of Dr. Riazuddin, one of the pioneers of theoretical physics in Pakistan, but is about his journey as a child aspiring to achieve greatness to the point where he becomes the epitome of academic brilliance at the national and international level.\n\nThe memoirs are edited by Dr. Fayyazuddin and M. Jamil Aslam. Dr. Fayyazuddin is a distinguished retired professor who was associated with the Physics Department of the Quaid-i-Azam University since 1968, and the twin brother of Dr. Riazuddin. Dr. M. Jamil Aslam is an Associate Professor at the Quaid-i-Azam University and a researcher focusing on theoretical particle physics.\n\nThe memoirs comprise two parts. In part one there are nine chapters while in part two there are twelve. Each chapter begins with a crisp introduction followed by the main message that needs to be disseminated. The first two chapters, “Dr. Riazuddin: A Brief Introduction” and “Ludhiana” tell about Dr. Riazuddin’s early life and family history during the pre-partition days. In chapter 3, he talks about his early interest in physics. He does not shy away from his background but gracefully owns his roots. He begins the chapter as: “For me, becoming a physicist was either due to some lucky chance or due to destiny. Lower middle-class families like mine preferred to send their children for technical education because that offered brighter prospects for jobs. Thus, for my Matriculation, I opted for science and art-related subjects. My school had a small science laboratory where my science teacher used to perform simple experiments, which I found very inspiring.”\n\nThe preface of the memoirs, written by the editors, discuss Dr. Riazuddin’s moment when he decided to take up physics. According to the editors, upward social mobility among the people from the middle and lower-middle classes was possible by acquiring secular knowledge emerging from the West. “Its validity transcends the individual and is applicable universally on all humanity,” write the editors. Dr. Riazuddin’s decision to opt for physics as his field of study did wonders for him. He played a noteworthy role in developing the institutions that fortified the academic and intellectual base of academicians and researchers. Chapter 4, “The Nuclear Energy Programme of Pakistan in a Historical Context, 1947-72” discusses how the partition of 1947 resulted in an uneven division of scientific and technological infrastructure.\n\nAs the founding chairman of the Institute of Physics at the Quaid-i-Azam University, Dr. Riazuddin brought to the fore a momentous evolution in the field. He took up a position, as a student of Prof. Abdus Salam at Cambridge University and acquired conceptual and practical knowledge before returning to Pakistan sharing it with his colleagues.\n\nChapter 16 in the book, which is titled, “Can Applied Research Survive without Basic Research?”, discusses practical applications of scientific knowledge. It emphasizes the need to invest to promote basic research leading to real development. This chapter shows how mission-oriented research explores the intellectual and social aspects of the researcher and society, fulfills technical and industrial needs, works towards national security, and facilitates academic research. When talking about basic research, the chapter dwells on how education and research creates an interaction between graduate education and basic research.\n\nChapter 18 is interesting for university managements. It discusses points on how to self-govern universities. The Governance Pyramid explains the hierarchy of governing a university that includes Departmental Councils, Faculty Councils, Graduate Council, Academic Council and Management Council. The chapter discloses Dr. Riazuddin’s prowess as a manager who deciphered the code to govern a university with excellence."
