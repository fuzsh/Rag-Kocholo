        "text": "Hello mothers out there.. Have you given birth in the last 3 months, 2 years ago, or 6 years ago of 1 or multiple kids.. We all know how intense the postpartum can be and how hard it is to take time to nurture ourselves as we nurture this new little human. I remember that for me, as I became a mother 5.5 years ago, I put myself at the bottom of the priorities and I didn't necessarily take care of my body. Although that same body had been the vessel that made possible for my baby to come into this world. It took me almost 5 years and another pregnancy to start consciously taking care of my body again by doing exercise and sports. And with that, came much more confidence in myself, inner strength and aliveness. 8 months ago, I met Ramona, who is a pre and postpartum fitness coach. I joined her classes of fitness for mothers with buggies in the park in Berlin. That is what gave me the push to start exercising again. Today, I am now moving my body 4 to 5 times a week and I have never felt more energized since the birth of my first child. So I know what it is to have difficulty to start again. It is so simple and so hard at the same time. Sometimes all it takes is a friend asking you to go running or play badminton with them, or you to finally decide to take this first tiny step. Ramona and I have decided to support you in this journey towards reconnecting with your bodies in the postpartum phase. We have created this 1-month embodiment program to take care of yourself and body through: meditation, pilates, fitness and free dance. The first session will be on February 13th and we will meet for 4 sessions in total every Mondays from 7.30pm to 8.30pm online. Take a look at the details below and if you wish to participate, feel free to book your tickets via this link: https://lnkd.in/eAv_cWwU. #fitness #sports #postpartum #physicalhealth #wellbeing #wellnesscoaching #motherhood"
