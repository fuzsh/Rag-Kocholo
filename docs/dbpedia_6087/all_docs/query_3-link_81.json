Not included so far (with a few exceptions) are articles from fan magazines, newspapers and blogs.\n\nUsage: A click on the title shows more details of the individual references. Selected titles (ONLY the titles, of course not the texts themselves!) can be downloaded in various export formats (RTF, RIS, BibTeX, XML, …) for further use in your own documents or bibliographic software using the basket. Various standard bibliographic formats (MLA, APA etc.) can be selected in the preferences. Registered users can enter new references of their own, add private or public comments and excerpts to the entries, and create individual bibliographies. Authors can provide their texts for download as PDFs. Indications of errors or missing titles and supplementary information, especially in form of abstracts and short critical reviews, are always welcome!\n\nProject manager: Dr. Joachim Trinkwitz, Dept. of German, Comparative Literature, and Cultural Studies, University of Bonn, Germany\n\nSponsored by Gesellschaft für Comicforschung\n\nRecent additions or edits (WIKINDX Master Bibliography)"
