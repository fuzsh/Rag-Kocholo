        "text": "The article I publish today is rather strange. It appeared on Picturegoer of February 8, 1941, while Leslie Howard was directing Pimpernel Smith. The interviewer, Hubert Cole, tries to persuade Leslie to go back to those Eighteenth Century characters he played so well,\n\nUn curioso articolo, quello che riporto qui di seguito. E’ apparso su Picturegoer dell’8 febbraio 1941, mentre Leslie Howard stava girando Pimpernel Smith. L’intervistatore cerca di convincere Leslie a tornare ai personaggi in costume settecentesco, che egli interpreta così bene, abbandonando quella che gli sembra una svolta troppo “intellettualistica”: The Petrified Forest, Pygmalion, Pimpernel Smith… e quando Leslie dichiara la sua intenzione di portare sullo schermo Amleto, l’intervistatore esclama inorridito: “Ma perché mai Amleto?!?” Proprio mentre tentava di riportarlo alla ragione, riproponendogli ruoli romantici e ciprie settecentesche!\n\nA parte le idee del signor Hubert Cole, è interessante lo spiraglio aperto sul progetto dell’Amleto cinematografico, raccontato dallo stesso Leslie Howard.\n\nWhat Should Leslie Howard do now?\n\nLeslie Howard plans to play Hamlet on the screen– to give up acting and become a director– to do all sorts of things which will take him away from the romantic costume roles that he plays so well. What do you want him to do?\n\nA few months ago I wrote a mildly more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger article about Leslie Howard. I felt he was losing interest in films, just when films needed him most. I felt he was going all intellectual on us, when he was so obviously cut out to be a romantic, sentimental hero. In general, I felt pretty worried.\n\nLast week I went down to see him at Denham, where he is directing and acting in Mr. Pimpernel Smith. He talked about what he has done, what he is doing, what he wants to do.[…]"
