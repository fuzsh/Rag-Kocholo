        "text": "WI No Prussian grab of Silesia in 1740\n\nWI Frederick the Great were killed or disowned before taking the throne and Prussia did nothing in 1740, would Augustus III of Saxony seize Silesia?\n\nHow would the Saxons do in battle against the Austrians compared with how the Prussians did? Would the Saxons have finished the War of Austrian succession with all, or some of Silesia in their hands? Or none? If Saxony gained a piece of Silesia in the War of the Austrian Succession settlement, would that have created a land corridor between Saxony and Poland, which Augustus also ruled?\n\nGiven Austria's pretty much inevitable desire for revenge and reclamation of Silesia, could Saxony hold its Silesian gains from an initial war in a subsequent war?\n\nWould Augustus have to fight using only Saxon troops, or would he be able to convince the Polish Sejm to vote Polish troops and funds to support his war effort?\n\nThis has all been assuming Prussia stays neutral. In this alternate War of Austrian Succession, could Prussia adopt a \"Reichstreue\" pro-Habsburg stance, attack and annex the Electorate of Saxony, while the Habsburgs restore themselves in Silesia, and if Augustus has gotten the Poles involved, perhaps the Prussians also seize West Prussia/the Polish Corridor/the lands of the 1st partition from Poland. Hmm, Maybe 1st partition grabs by all three powers, Prussia, Austria, and Russia, during the WotAS in 1740s, instead of waiting until 1770s, if all three of those powers are on the same anti-Wettin, anti-French, British-funded side.\n\nOr what if Prussia is neutral in the WotAS, and the Saxons win Silesia, but by 1756 the diplomatic revolution has occurred, and Saxony is pro-British, and Austria and Russia are pro-French. Then the Austrians most likely launch the European war with an attack on Saxony, especially in Silesia (unless, less likely, the Saxons preempt, in Bohemia), the Prussians and Russians ally with Austria and crush Saxony. Then the Prussians crush Hanover?"
