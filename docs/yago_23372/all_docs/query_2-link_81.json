After a careful education he traveled in western Europe as a young man.\"[1]\n\nCareer\n\n\"In 1757 he was sent by his mother’s enormously powerful family to St. Petersburg to obtain Russian support for their plan to dethrone the Polish king Augustus III. While at the Russian court, he apparently did little for the family’s interests but succeeded in becoming the lover of the future empress, Catherine II.\"[1]\n\n\"It is said of Catherine the Great: Her next lover was plucked straight from the imperial court, Polish nobleman Stanisław Poniatowski. Their affair came to an end after he was forced from the Russian court. Catherine later helped to place him on the Polish throne. She was incredibly generous to all her lovers.\"[2]\n\n\"When he ascended the Polish throne in 1764, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had about 700,000 square kilometers and, although weak, was one of the largest European countries. He was a politician with a distinct personality, with his own program, and his rule had only one goal - to improve the situation of the Republic of Poland.\"[3]\n\n\"Stanisław was the last King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania (1764-95) and the last monarch of the united Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795). He remains a controversial figure in Polish history. Recognized as a great patron of the arts and sciences and an initiator and firm supporter of progressive reforms, he is also remembered as the King of the Commonwealth whose election was marred by Russian intervention. He is criticized primarily for his failure to stand against the partitions, and thus to prevent the destruction of the Polish state.\" [4]\n\nPersonal Life\n\n\"Poniatowski never married. In his youth, he had loved his cousin Elżbieta Czartoryska[5], but her fatherAugust Aleksander Czartoryski disapproved because he did not think him influential or rich enough.\"[4]\n\n\"He had several notable lovers, including Elżbieta Branicka[6], Magdalena Agnieszka Sapieżyna, Elżbieta Szydłowska and Catherine the Great.\"[4]\n\n\"Upon Stanisław's accession to the throne, he had hopes of marrying Catherine II, however she made it clear through his envoy Rzewuski that she would not marry him. A few historians believe that he contracted a secret marriage with Elżbieta Szydłowska. However, a contemporary who knew them both, stated this rumour only spread after the death of Poniatowski and was generally disbelieved, so the marriage is considered by most to be unlikely.\"[4]\n\nStanisław may have fathered the following children, however sources have conflicting information. His paternity hasn't be proven:[4]\n\nCatherine the Great\n\nAnna Petrovna, 1757-1758\n\nMagdalena Agnieszka Sapieżyna\n\nKonstancja Żwanowa, 1768-1810[7]\n\nMichał Mikołaj Cichock, 1770-1828[8]\n\nElżbieta Szydłowska\n\nAleksandra Grabowska, 1771-1789[9]\n\nMichał Grabowski, 1773-1812[10]\n\nIzabela Grabowska - 1776-1858[11]\n\nStanisław Grabowski - 1780-1845[12]\n\nKazimierz Grabowski - 1774-1842[13]\n\nDeath\n\n\"After the death of Empress Catherine II (November 17, 1796), the Russian throne was taken over by Emperor Paul I Romanov, who was kind to Poniatowski and invited him to St. Petersburg. He arrived there on March 10 and took up residence at the Marble Palace. He died from a stroke on February 12, 1798 in St. Petersburg.\"[4]\n\n\"Paul I sponsored a royal state funeral, and on 3 March he was buried at the Catholic Church of St. Catherine in St. Petersburg. In 1938, his remains were transferred to the Second Polish Republic and interred in a church at Wołczyn, his birthplace. In 1990, his body was once more exhumed and was brought to Poland, to Bazylika św. Jana Chrzciciela; Warsaw, Miasto Warszawa, Mazowieckie, Poland. [14][15] A third funeral ceremony was held on 14 February 1995.\"[4]\n\n\"When he died in 1798, Poland no longer existed. As the tripartite convention of the partitioning powers of 1797 proclaimed, \"political annihilation\" of its body was carried out for all time. Stanisław August as a monarch, as a politician and as a man suffered the greatest possible defeat. All the more so because, contrary to what was later accused of him, he was not a traitor or a puppet of Russia deprived of his own will.
