        "text": "DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin, Lombard Chief of Police Tom Wirsing and Warrenville Chief of Police Sam Bonilla announced that the Court has granted the State’s motion to deny pre-trial release for two DuPage County residents each accused of possession and distribution of child pornography in unrelated cases. Joseph Gregoire, 38 (d.o.b. 7/6/1986) of the 1S 0-100 block of Spring Road, Oakbrook Terrace, appeared in front of Judge Leah Bendik at First Appearance Court Thursday morning charged with two counts of Child Pornography – Reproduce or Distribute (Class X Felony) and four counts of Possession of Child Pornography (Class 2 Felony). The second individual, Jordan Erdakos, 26 (d.o.b. 11/16/1997) of the 30W 0-100 block of Maplewood Drive, Warrenville, appeared in front of Judge Angelo Kappas at First Appearance Court this morning charged with one count of Child Pornography – Reproduce or Distribute (Class X Felony) and five counts of Possession of Child Pornography (Class 1 Felony).\n\nAs part of their ongoing investigations into child pornography, the Lombard Police Department received information that an individual going by the name of “Kinkypigbottom,” later identified as Gregoire, was allegedly sharing and disseminating child pornography. After receiving the information, officers obtained a search warrant for Gregoire’s home. On July 31, 2024, officers executed the search warrant on the home where they allegedly found videos and images of child pornography on two computers and a cell phone, some of which Gregoire had allegedly shared with others online. Gregoire was taken into custody at this time.\n\nOn July 28, 2024, the Warrenville Police Department received information that Erdakos was allegedly in possession of a cell phone that contained images of child pornography. After obtaining a search warrant for the phone, authorities allegedly observed hundreds of videos and images of child pornography, some of which had allegedly been shared, on Erdakos’ phone. On July 30, 2024, officers with the Warrenville Police Department took Erdakos into custody from his home without incident. Erdakos is currently on sex offender probation after entering a plea of guilty to one count of possessing child pornography in May, 2024. A condition of his probation includes no possession of any electronic devices capable of connecting to the Internet.\n\n“The allegations that both of these men were not only in possession of child pornography but were actively sharing it with others are revolting,” Berlin said. “Each of these disgusting images and videos allegedly found on Mr. Gregoire’s and Mr. Erdakos’ devices, some of which depict infants and toddlers, represent yet another innocent victim of child pornography. The charges filed against these two men in as many days sends the message that in DuPage County, we will not hesitate in charging anyone suspected of possessing or distributing child pornography. I commend the Lombard and Warrenville Police Departments for their work not only on this case, but for their ongoing efforts to protect our children from child pornographers. I thank Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and his office for their assistance in this case. I also thank Assistant State’s Attorneys Alexandria Levan, Adam Frahm, Michael Pingaj, Philip Ungar and Anthony Raimondi for their work in preparing a strong case against these two defendants.”\n\n“I would like to thank our law enforcement partners at the Attorney General’s Office and their Digital Forensics Investigative Division for their assistance on this case as well as State’s Attorney Bob Berlin and his team for their efforts in filing charges against Mr. Erdakos,” Wirsing said.\n\n“The Warrenville Police Department would like to thank the West Chicago Police Department and the DuPage County Sheriff’s Office for their assistance in obtaining the digital forensic evidence needed to bring charges against Erdakos,” Bonilla said. “These types of cases are always very difficult and disturbing to investigate and I thank State’s Attorney Bob Berlin for filing the appropriate charges. I commend my officers and investigation team for their ability to set their own emotions and beliefs aside and maintain professionalism in protecting our community from this evil.”\n\nThe next court appearance for both men is scheduled for August 26, 2024, for arraignment in front of Judge Daniel Guerin.\n\nMembers of the public are reminded that this complaint contains only charges and is not proof of the defendants’ guilt. The defendants are presumed innocent and are entitled to a fair trial in which it is the government’s burden to prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."
