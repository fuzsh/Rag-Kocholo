        "text": "by Father Mark Goldasich\n\n“I am both excited and nervous for school.”\n\nThese words are from a recent high school graduate from the parish as she gets ready to start college in a couple of weeks. They capture perfectly what many experience at this time of year, whether students entering a new grade, people starting a new job or project, or priests in new assignments.\n\nMy prayer is always that the excitement energizes — and the nervousness doesn’t paralyze — everyone starting out on a new journey in life. And I also pray that they will have the patience to be beginners as they encounter unfamiliar challenges.\n\nI use the occasion of kids returning to school to examine areas of my life where I’ve fallen into a rut . . . and how I might climb out of it. I enjoy this story about the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:\n\nWhen he was well along in years, his hair was white, but he was still a vigorous man. Someone asked him why this was so.\n\nThe poet pointed to an apple tree in bloom and said, “That tree is very old, but I never saw prettier blossoms on it than it now bears. That tree grows new wood each year. Like that apple tree, I try to grow a little new wood each year.” (Story found in Brian Cavanaugh’s “The Sower’s Seeds.”)\n\nIt’s so easy, isn’t it, to fall into a rut and miss out on all the excitement and possibilities that life has to offer. We tend to drive the same way to work, sit in the same place at the same Mass, eat the same foods, fumble through the same computer programs, plod through the same daily routines, etc. A new school year is an opportunity to shake things up and try something new.\n\nWith that in mind, I stirred up my courage and reread an article from the June Reader’s Digest about 20 tricks to do more with my tech. Among the things I learned — and tried — was how to add emojis on my computer (and not just on my phone) and how to tell my smart (aleck?) TV what to do by speaking into its remote. Who knew?\n\nAs mentioned in previous columns, I enjoy word puzzles. I am, however, terrible at spatial, hands-on projects. So, this school year, I’m entering that scary, uncharted territory in two ways.\n\nFirst, I ordered a Lego “Tranquil Garden” set. It reminded me of the beautiful Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden that I visited years ago in Vancouver, British Columbia. Its 1,363 pieces are intended to produce a spirit of meditation and peacefulness as I assemble it. I’ll let you know how that turns out!\n\nSecondly, I have a couple of unopened Amazon boxes containing items labeled “some (read: a lot of) assembly required.” I wasn’t prepared for that when the items arrived but I’m finally letting my excitement override my nervousness and am ready to tackle the projects. (I may have to retreat to my Lego tranquil garden when I get frustrated.)\n\nDo you have ruts in your life? Could this new school year be a call for you to try something new? Don’t let your age hold you back, as this story illustrates:\n\nThe Roman scholar Cato started to study Greek when he was over 80 years old. Someone asked why he tackled such a difficult task at his age.\n\nCato replied, “It’s the earliest age I have left!” (Story found in “Illustrations Unlimited,” edited by James S. Hewett).\n\nSo, be adventurous and grow a little new wood this school year. After all, it’s the earliest age you have left!"
