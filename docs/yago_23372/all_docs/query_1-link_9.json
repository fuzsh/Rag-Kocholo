Also if the Wettins are going to inherite the Habsburg’s domains, will they waste their time on Poland?\n\nI think that this would change the entire post-Spanish Succession politics of Europe, if Charles VI doesn’t spend his time and political capital in getting his daughter to inherits, what will he do instead?

I presume it changes the War of the Polish Succession as I suspect that your right that the Wettins, knowing they should inherit Austria may not bother with Poland.\n\nMaybe Charles VI, focuses on recovering more of Hungary from the Ottomans instead?\n\nThe one thing I really wonder is how the incorporation of Saxony into Austria will effect European history?\n\nI have to admit I don't know much about Central and Eastern European Politics in this time period, but I'm assuming it would massively.

This could result in Protestantism doing a lot better in Bohemia and Hungary, but also that Silesia end up a lot less welcoming to Prussians.\n\nWell it will create a massive beast of a imperial domain, but the fact that the Wettin Emperor have to balance Lutheran Saxony with his other domains, which likely mean he have to embrace greater tolerance to Protestants in his new domains.

The big question is how Austria act in the Interbellum, do they invest heaviliy in the army and war with the Ottomans. Do this result in competent commanders being discovered. Etc.\n\nThe only land out of Austria they conquered was Silesia, but I don't know if Wettin Austria would butterfly this?\n\nIt really depend how Austria act.\n\nAlso with Saxony incorporated into Austria, Austria I'm presuming will have a much more Imperial and German flavour than OTL, possibly making them favourites to unify Germany.\n\nI don’t think we really need to talk about a unification, as much as a centralization. Let’s say that Austria defeat Prussia, Bavaria and their French ally, Prussia likely get a light punishment, but I could see the Wettins being less sentimental about the Wittelsbachs, who aren’t close relative to the Wettins and they simply see Bavaria as pierce of meat to carve up. Even if they also lose the Austrian Netherlands, that would create a monster of state which would directly own a third of HRE and indirectly control one sixth (Swabia and Franconia).\n\nMaria Josepha seems to be a very interesting figure.\n\nShe was. I mean, she's the BIG reason Friedrich Christian and his son were never elected king of Saxony in succession to her husband. She BLOCKED any attempts by Friedrich Christian and his part-Sobieska Bavarian wife to travel to Poland for fear of them building up a client base of supporters there. Then, when her husband died, their supporters would be able to challenge (her favourite son) Prince Xaver's possible election as king of Poland.\n\nCampbell-Orr's book is out of print (although that may just be by me), and ridiculously expensive, but you can find excerpts on googlebooks. If you can find a link to the FULL book, I'd be most grateful if you could PM me\n\nShe was.

First off, if no Carlos offspring, MJ may not be married off. But, since Maria Theresa was so young at the time, one could make the POD after the OTL marriage. MT and her sister die off once the die has been cast. MJ has renounced her rights to Austrian throne as a condition of marriage. Ditto for MJ sister, Maria Amalia (m. 1722 elector of Bavaria). One would assume that regardless of Carlos offspring situation, he's going to insist on the renunciation stipulation. (Edit - renunciation under the expectation that Carlos has offspring in future)\n\nAs I've stated on other threads, these renunciations don't mean diddly squat if a contender can back up a claim with political/military muscle. However, they will be used by rivals to line up their own muscle.\n\nNO ONE wants to see a mega state forming, so (assuming OTL marriages) Augustus is going to have his support for the Polish throne diminish, while opposition increases. Part of his support came as a condition of backing the pragmatic sanction. Should Augustus still capture the Polish throne, No one is going to support MJ as Austrian heir.\n\nIn this scenario, the Austrian heir is coming from outside the empire, this means foreigners are jockeying position both within and out the empire. Austria is unlikely to be able to unify and withstand the invasions.\n\nAssuming anything resembling OTL, France backs the Bavarian candidate, Fred the Great has an easy time in Silesia . he likely knocks Saxony out, making MJ's claim moot. Britain may acquiesce IF France agrees not to back Spain in Italy. This leaves Spain out in the cold in the ongoing War of Jenkins Ear - this could drag out if the Anglo-French arrangement prevents British invasion of the Spanish mainland. I can see this being a short war. If so, this is huge for the French and Indian war. France hasn't been beaten up/knocked around, so is in much better position. Britain may not be so aggressive if France isn't at such an OTL disadvantaged condition. And, Britain may have taken a chunk of the Spanish empire, and thus be otherwise directed.\n\nAn automatic butterfly means MT doesn't marry Francis Stephen of Lorraine. France is going to have to find another way of taking the Duchy"
