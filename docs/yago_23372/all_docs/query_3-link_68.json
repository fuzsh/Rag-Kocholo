        "text": "Ann Catherine Wientczak Ziolkowski, passed away peacefully, with her two daughters and their husbands holding her hands August 1, 2024. She truly died of a broken heart, losing the love of her life Ron, just a month ago. Ann was born in Chicago, Illinois August 8, 1947 to Hyacinth Barbara Fruth and Stanley Anthony Wientczak. She was first generation to the United States and proud that her father was born in Prussia, now known as Poland. Ann would go on to be one of the most impressive Polish cooks. She made the best Pierogi (sauerkraut was her signature flavor), kielbasa (Polish Sausage), and Golabki (stuffed cabbage or Americans know them as pigs in the blanket). Nobody could make kolaches better than her. Even if you had her recipe, hers had the perfect amount of love and could not be replicated. She lived in Chicago until marrying Ronald Richard Ziolkowski on October 16, 1965 and moving to San Bernardino, CA as he joined the USMC 10 days after they were married. Their two daughters were born on the Marine Corps Base: Deborah Ann “Debbie” and Elisa Christine just 15 months apart. Christopher Anthony would join the family 8 years later. They raised their family in Harvey, IL. Though she was a young mom, she always knew to do the right thing and provided the best of everything, even on the smallest budget. She volunteered for many years as a Girl Scout leader and at Holmes Elementary School, then decided to go to work in 1977. She walked right down the street (she did not have a car) into Allied Tube & Conduit, asking for a chance. Quickly she taught herself how to type and told her new boss she would not disappoint her. Ann worked almost 40 years and tried to retire twice, but they kept bringing her back. She was a credit analyst and debt collector. Her customers loved her, even when she was calling with the gentle reminder that they owed money. She could operate the 10 key faster and more accurate than anybody. Ann never left home without her camera; she captured every moment on film and scrapbooked 164 albums of memories. Many of those memories were at the cabin in Adams-Friendship, Wisconsin, this was their second home, spending many weekends with family and friends having endless fun. She loved everyone and never hesitated to extend an invite for dinner or holidays. Her table always had room for one more. You never got out of her home without a meal. If you could not get to her home, she delivered food to yours. She decorated for every holiday and made your birthday truly the best day of the year. She loved her son-in-laws John and Chuck and was most proud of her five grandchildren: Nathan J. (Taylor) Kijowski, Charles B. Krcilek, Christian A. Krcilek, Zackary A. (fiancé Emma) Kijowski and Nicole A. Kijowski. She is also survived by her loving sister Maggie (Mark) Adler, and Ron’s siblings: Ed (Fran), Gene (Fran), Pat (Bill) Mikolajczak, and Larry (Jean) and a host of nieces and nephews. Ann also leaves behind her life-long best friend Pat Galambos. She loved her furry pets: Dooley and Alice; Nikita joined her in Heaven 4 days after her arrival. She is also proceeded in death by her brother Paul, her parents and many others waiting to greet her. Her faith was strong, praying every night with Ron and always knowing God held those that left before her safe until their reunion. Ann and Ron spent time in Arizona after Chris passed away in 2017, but Peotone will always be home. She loved her land, trees, pool, garden and neighbors. Visitation will be held at Kurtz Memorial Chapel 65 Old Frankfort Way, Frankfort, IL 60423 Friday August 16, 2024 from 3-8PM, family sharing will start at 7PM, all are welcome to share. Funeral Mass Saturday, August 17th at St. Paul the Apostle Catholic at 10:00 AM with visitation from 9-10AM. 511 North Conrad Street, Peotone, IL. Reception will follow, please RSVP to Debbie or Elisa. Live by Ann’s motto: “Be kind to others, it cost nothing to be nice” She made this world a much better place and will be dearly missed. Interment will take place at a later date at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, Elwood, IL."
