        "text": "The paper presents results of research on a particular group of wooden sculptures originating from a medieval borderland area between Poland and Hungary. A juxtaposition of the group of sculptures in question with particular examples of French sculpture, as well as an analysis of the historical relations between the French and Hungarian milieus of patrons, resulted in a hypothesis about the French origin of the maker of the Central-European figures. Thus, a group of sculptures which plays an important role in the history of art of the Kingdoms of Poland and Hungary has been for the first time associated with a particular Parisian workshop active in the first third of the fourteenth century.\n\nWriting an academic history of Polish art was an urgent task of art historians after World War I, when the country regained its political independence. An important and creditable achievement in that respect was a study by Michał Walicki and Juliusz Starzyński, published in 1934 as a kind of supplement to the monumental Geschichte der Kunst von der altchristlichen Zeit bis zur Gegenwart by the Marburg historian Richard Hamann, translated at that time into Polish. In 1936, the work of the Polish scholars was published again in the form of a separate book. The paper focuses on three problems that were addressed in it: the cultural and artistic ties of Poland to the West, the vernacular features of Polish art, and the presence of the “Eastern art” in Polish artistic heritage. The author examines also the question whether those issues were related to the political, social, and cultural reality of the Second Polish Republic.\n\nThis article for the first issue of postgraduate historical magazine at Lancaster University features the royal imagery of the last Jagiellonian rulers in sixteenth-century Poland. I elaborate on the classical images used in the representation of Sigismund I the Old (Zygmunt Stary) and Sigismund II Augustus (Zygmunt August) via different technics in art and literature, demonstrating diverse approaches used by the last Jagiellonians in an attempt to put them in a broader European Renaissance framework."
