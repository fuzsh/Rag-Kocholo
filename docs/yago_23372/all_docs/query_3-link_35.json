        "text": "BWV 215 Preise dein Gl�cke, gesegnetes Sachsen\n\n(Drama per Musica overo Cantata gratulatoria)\n\nAnniversary of the Election of Augustus III as King of Poland (5 October 1734).\n\nJohann Christoph Clauder; PT (Leipzig, 1734); Facs: Neumann T, p. 412.\n\n5 October 1734, Leipzig; Parody: 1 ← BWV Anh. 11/1 and → BWV 232/22; 7 ---> BWV 248V/5.\n\nBG 34; NBA I/37.\n\nA Drama in Music or Cantata of Congratulation(1)\n\n1. Chorus (S, A, T, B)\n\nPraise now thy blessings, O fortunate Saxon,\n\nFor God the throne of thy King hath upheld.\n\nO happy land,\n\nThanks give to heaven and kiss now the hand\n\nWhich makes thy fortune each day ever waxing\n\nAnd all thy townsmen to safety propelled.\n\n2. Recit. (T)\n\nHow could we then, O mightiest August,\n\nThe undisguised emotions\n\nOf this our reverence, love and fealty\n\nTo thee but with the greatest joy\n\nBefore thy feet here offer?\n\nDoth not through thy paternal hand\n\nUpon our land\n\nNow heaven�s gracious blessing\n\nIn streams of bounty flow?\n\nAnd if our hopes run not amiss,\n\nShall we to our relief yet know\n\nWithin thy grace, within thy being\n\nThy mighty father's(2) form and of his great deeds the meaning.\n\n3. Aria (T)\n\nTrue, Augustus' name defieth,\n\nFrom the noble gods descended,\n\nAll force of mortality.\n\nAnd the townsmen of the province,\n\nSubjects of such virtuous princes,\n\nLive now in the golden age.(3)\n\n4. Recit. (B)\n\nWhat else hath thee, Sarmatia,(4) persuaded\n\nThat thou to fill thy royal throne\n\nThis Saxon-born Piast,(5)\n\nThe great Augustus� worthy son,\n\nBefore all others gave thy preference?\n\nNot just the fame of shining fathers,\n\nNot just his lands� great might,\n\nNo! Rather, his own virtue�s rays\n\nDrew all of thine own loyal subjects\n\nAnd all thy varied peoples� minds\n\nTo him alone.\n\nThis more than his clan�s fame and brilliant legacy\n\nBrought them before his feet with praise.\n\nTrue, spite and jealousy,\n\nWhich, sadly, often gold of crowns will\n\nMuch less than even lead or iron honor,\n\nAre yet enraged at thee, O mighty ruler,\n\nAnd lay upon thy health their curse!\n\nBut soon their curse will be transformed to blessing,\n\nAnd all their rage\n\nIs truly much too meager\n\nSuch fortune, founded on a rock,\n\nTo weaken in the slightest.\n\n5. Aria (B)\n\nBluster on, presumptuous mob,\n\nNow within thy very bowels!\n\nBathe at will thy shameless arm,\n\nFull of wrath,\n\nIn thy guiltless brothers' blood,\n\nTo our horror, to thy sorrow!\n\nFor the bane\n\nAnd the fury of thine envy\n\nThee more than Augustus strike.\n\n6. Recit. (S)\n\nOh yes!\n\nGod is to us yet with his help nearby\n\nAnd shields Augustus� throne.\n\nThrough him hath all the northern region\n\nIn its own choice of king now found contentment.\n\nWill not the Baltic soon,\n\nThe mouth of Vistula now won, Augustus� realm\n\nAs well\n\nAnd all his weapons know?\n\nAnd doth he not let that same town,(6)\n\nWhich hath so long been set against his power,\n\nMore of his grace than of his wrath have knowledge?\n\nThis proves that he in this finds joy:\n\nHis loyal subjects� breast\n\nThrough kindness more than force to conquer.\n\n7. Aria (S)\n\nThat through the weapons enkindeled by passion\n\nFoes oft are punished\n\nBrings to many praise and fame;\n\nBut that the wicked with good be requited\n\nIs but for heroes,\n\nIs Augustus� proper claim.\n\n8. Recit. and Arioso (T, B, S)\n\n(T)\n\nGrant though, O cherished sovereign father, this,\n\nThat now our Muses� band\n\nThat day which thee such pleasure hath afforded,\n\nOn which one year ago\n\nSarmatia to have as king did choose thee,\n\nWithin their innocent repose\n\nMay honor and in song pay homage.\n\n(B)\n\nAt just the time\n\nWhen all around us lightning cracks,\n\nYea, when the might of France\n\n(Indeed so many times already muffled),\n\nOn southern side and northern,\n\nDoth pose our fatherland with sword and fire its threat,\n\nStill can this town so happy be,\n\nGreat patron god of these our lindens,(7)\n\nThee, but thee not alone,\n\nThy wife as well, the nation�s sunshine,\n\nHer loyal subjects� joy and comfort,\n\nIn their embrace to find now.\n\n(S)\n\nHow could amidst so much prosperity\n\nThe Pindus(8) not content and happy be?\n\n(T, B, S)\n\nHeaven, let to spite's distress,\n\nUnder such divine defense\n\nThe good fortune of our era\n\nIn a thousand branches flower!\n\n9. Chorus (S, A, T, B)\n\nFounder of empires and ruler of kingdoms,\n\nStrengthen the throne which Augustus doth hold.\n\nEnrich his house\n\nWith never ceasing prosperity blest,\n\nLet us reside now in peace in the countries\n\nWhich he with justice and grace doth protect.\n\n1. This subtitle is written by hand in the OP. The characters are not identified.\n\n2. The father of Augustus III was Augustus II, \"the Strong\" (1670-1733).\n\n3. There are similar references to the golden age (cf. the golden age of the Roman Augustus!) in other congratulatory cantatas for Augustus III, e.g. BWV 207/6 and 207a/4.\n\n4. Sarmatia is the ancient name for Poland and Russia.\n\n5. A legendary peasant named Piast founded the first dynasty of Polish rulers, which lasted until the death of Casimir III in 1370.\n\n6. Danzig.\n\n7. Alluding to Leipzig's etymolgy: \"Lindentown,\" from Slavic lipa 'linden tree.'\n\n8. Perhaps Leipzig is here represented as the mountain home of the Muses in northwest Greece.\n\n� Copyright Z. Philip Ambrose"
