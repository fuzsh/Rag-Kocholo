        "text": "Maria Josepha of Austria went down in the history of Poland as the last queen of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth through her marriage to Augustus III of Saxony, who was crowned King of Poland by the Bishop of Krakow in 1734.\n\nThe marriage ceremony of Archduchess Maria Josepha with the Saxon prince took place many years before these important events in Polish history, in 1719. The Dresden wedding, thrown for his son by Augustus II, was remembered not only as an important political event but also as one of the most lavish ceremonies in Baroque Europe. Although the two compositions that Johann Sebastian Bach himself was allegedly commissioned to write for this occasion were finally not performed at the event, there is no doubt that the music at the wedding was kept at the highest level. Among the pieces that resounded that day was the secular cantata L’Istro by Francesco Conti, a recognized Italian composer and instrumentalist. The grandiose work for soprano and orchestra delights with the sophisticated melody of the solo part and inventiveness in the use of the sounds of particular instruments.\n\nIn the second part of the concert, the outstanding soloists of the Polish Royal Opera will perform the cantata Il giorno natalizio dell’imperatrice Amalia Wilhelmina, written by another Italian composer – Giuseppe Porsile to a text by Pietro Pariati. It is worth noting that Porsile was the only Neapolitan artist truly appreciated at the Viennese Habsburg court, where the more conservative attitudes of artists from northern Italy prevailed. His dramatic work for two sopranos, three altos and basso continuo was first performed in 1717, and among the performers at the premiere there were both Maria and her mother, Amalia Wilhelmina, as evidenced by an entry in the manuscript of the work preserved in Sächsische Landesbibliothek in Dresden.\n\nPROGRAM AND PERFORMERS\n\nFrancesco Conti (1681–1732) – cantata L’Istro (libretto: Apostolo Zeno)\n\nKACPER SZELĄŻEK COUNTERTENOR\n\nGiuseppe Porsile (1680–1750) – cantata Il giorno natalizio dell’imperatrice Amalia Wilhelmina (libretto: Pietro Pariati)\n\nLA GLORIA JOANNA TALARKIEWICZ\n\nLA FAMA MARTA BOBERSKA\n\nLA PRIMAVERA IWONA LUBOWICZ\n\nL’AURORA / FLORA ANETA ŁUKASZEWICZ\n\nTHE PERIOD INSTRUMENTS ENSEMBLE OF THE POLISH ROYAL OPERA CAPELLA REGIA POLONA\n\nLILIANNA STAWARZ HARPSICHORD, CONDUCTOR\n\nDuration: approx. 1 h\n\nThe seats in the auditorium are not numbered.\n\nWe kindly encourage you to read the rules of participation in cultural events organized by the Polish Royal Opera:\n\nIf you are not feeling well, are ill, or had contact with an infected person – stay at home.\n\nPlease, take a face mask with you.
