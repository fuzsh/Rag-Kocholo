French Paintings and Pastels, 1600â1945: The Collections of The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, edited by Aimee Marcereau DeGalan, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, 2023. doi: 10.37764/78973.5.320.5407.\n\nThe iconography associated with Augustus the Strongâborn Friedrich August von Wettin (1670â1733), later Elector-Duke of Saxony, King of Poland, and Grand Duke of Lithuaniaâis more abundant and varied than that of most European rulers of his generation. That said, there exists no likeness of him that, in terms of the artistâs powers of characterization and sheer technical brilliance, can equal the painted portrait that has been in the Nelson-Atkins Museum since 1954.1According to documents in the paintingâs file in the curatorial offices of the Nelson-Atkins, the original back of the canvas bore the inscription âPeint par N. de LargilliÃ¨re,â which would not be the artistâs signature found on the back of so many of his works, because his patronym is misspelled. He invariably signed his name as âLargillierreâ (with two Rs) on his works or in archival documents. For example, Largillierreâs portrait of FranÃ§ois Armand de Gontaut, Duc de Biron (1714; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) is inscribed âPeint par N. de Largillierre / 1714â on the verso. See Myra Nan Rosenfeld, Largillierre and the Eighteenth-Century Portrait, exh. cat. (Montreal: Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, 1982), 256–57. Unfortunately, no photographs of the inscription were apparently taken before the Nelson-Atkins canvas was lined in 1954. It is also possible that someone mis-transcribed the artistâs name. The work of the French painter Nicolas de Largillierre (Fig. 1),2The most informative early biography of Nicolas de Largillierre is to be found in Antoine Joseph Dezallier dâArgenville, Supplement a lâAbrÃ©gÃ© de la vie des plus fameux peintres, part 3 (Paris: chez de Bure lâainÃ©, 1752), 246-53. one of the foremost portraitists during the reigns of Louis XIV (r. 1643â1715) and Louis XV (r. 1715â1774), it was executed in circumstances that may never be satisfactorily elucidated.\n\nThe subject was a member of the junior, Albertine branch of the Wettin dynasty, which since the early fifteenth century had ruled Saxony, one of four secular electorates of the Holy Roman Empire, ruled by the Habsburg monarchs. Born in Dresden on May 12, 1670, Friedrich August was the second of the two sons of the Lutheran Elector Johann Georg III (1647â1691) and his consort Anna Sophia von Oldenburg of Denmark and Norway (1647â1717). His humanist and military education was typical of Germanic princes of the time. Much of his passion for the fine and decorative arts, architecture, music, dance, and literature, as well as his taste for opulent display and ornamentation, derived from his Grand TourGrand Tour: An extended tour of Europe, in particular Italy, in the 18th century, taken by wealthy young men (and some women), especially British and American ones, to complete their education and cultivation. of Europe. Traveling under the name âGraf von Leisnig,â3Augustus the Strong may have used a pseudonym so that he could avoid diplomatic dutites while on his Grand Tour. See Tony Sharp, Pleasure and Ambition: The Life, Loves and Wars of Augustus the Strong (London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2021), 9, 11. he made two sojourns in France during the summer months of 1687 and 1688, where he was dazzled by the Baroque pomp and splendor of the court of Louis XIV. Official presentations to the French monarch and the royal family were made by German princesses to whom he was related, both of whom were married to Bourbon princes.4See BÃ©atrix Sauleâs informative discussions of Friedrich Augustâs two sojourns in France in 1687 and 1688: âTrois princes de Saxe Ã la cour de Louis XIV,â in Dirk Syndram and BÃ©atrix Saule, eds., Splendeurs de la cour de Saxe: Dresde Ã Versailles, exh. cat. (Paris: ReÌunion des museÌes nationaux, 2006), 51â52; and âTrois princes de Saxe Ã la cour de Versailles,â in the Acts of the Colloquium organised by the AcadÃ©mie des Sciences Morales, des Lettres, et des Arts de Versailles et dâÃle-de-France, ed. Bruno Chauffert-Yvart, LumiÃ¨res europÃ©ennes: Versailles et la Saxe XVIIeâXXe siÃ¨cles (Versailles: AcadeÌmie des sciences morales, des lettres, et des arts de Versailles et dâIÌle-de-France, 2007), 44â47. In 1693, Friedrich August wed the Protestant Christiane Eberhardine von Brandenburg-Bayreuth (1671â1717), by whom he had only one child, his son and namesake Friedrich August (1696â1763). Upon the death of the sitterâs elder brother, Johann Georg IV (1668â1694), he became Elector Duke of Saxony.\n\nFriedrich Augustâs physical prowess earned him the epithets âthe Strongâ (der Starke), âthe Iron Hand,â and âthe Saxon Hercules.â He fought alongside the imperial troops of Austria against the Ottoman Turks in Hungary. On the death of Jan III Sobieski in 1696, he positioned himself as one of the leading candidates for election to the throne of Poland.5The other contenders were Sobieskiâs son Jakub Ludwik Henryk (1667â1737); the French candidate, FranÃ§ois Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Conti (1664â1709), who was backed by Louis XIV; the Bavarian claimant, Maximillian Emanuel von Wittelsbach of Bavaria (1662â1726); and the Papal pretender, Livio Odeschalchi, Duca di Bracciano (1652â1713). By means of bribery and converting to Roman Catholicism, he secured the prize in September of the following year with the support of Emperor Leopold I. His incursion into the Slavic country with a massive army consolidated his victory. Continuing to combat the Turks on the side of the Habsburgs, at the beginning of the Great Northern War he joined an anti-Swedish coalition that included the forces of his cousin Frederick IV of Denmark-Norway and those of Czar Peter the Great of Russia. Friedrich August employed his armies to invade the province of Livonia, but in 1702 they were soundly defeated by his implacable foe, Charles XII (1682â1718) of Sweden, an ally of the Turks, who put StanisÅaw LeszczyÅski on the throne of Poland in his place. After fighting with Austria in the Dutch Republic in the War of the Spanish Succession and further conflict with Sweden, Friedrich August regained the Polish crown in 1719 and remained head of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth for the rest of his life.\n\nVoltaire extolled Augustus the Strong in his biography of the life of Charles XII: âHis court was the most brilliant in Europe after that of Louis XIV. Never was a prince more lavish or munificent, and bestowed his favors with as much elegance.â6âFrÃ©dÃ©ric Auguste, Ãlecteur de Saxe . . . Ã©toit un prince moins connu encore, par sa force de corps incroÃ¯able que par sa bravoure & la galanterie de son esprit. Sa cour Ã©tait la plus brillante de lâEurope, aprÃ¨s celle de Louis XIV. [J]amais prince ne fut plus gÃ©nÃ©reux, ne donna plus, & nâaccompagna ses dons de tant de grÃ¢ce.â (Frederick Augustus, Elector of Saxony . . . was a prince even less known for his incredible physical strength than for his bravery and the gallantry of his spirit.) Voltaire, LâHistoire de Charles XIII, Roi de SuÃ¨de (Basel: Chez Christophe Revis, 1731), 34. He engaged the Huguenot architect Raymond Le Plat (ca. 1664â1742) as his principal art advisor. The rulerâs impact on the cultural history of Saxony and above all its capital city, Dresden, fueled by Saxon industry and profits from Polish agrarian taxes, cannot be overemphasized. In 1710, he founded the Meissen porcelain factory, and between 1711 and 1728 he had the Zwinger Palace designed and built under the direction of Matthaus PÃ¶ppelmann and Balthasar Permoser. Augustus the Strongâs Japanese Palace was erected in 1715 to house his porcelain collections, and the Green VaultÂ in the Residenzschloss was created as a repository for his unrivalled collection of objets dâart and jewels. He added to the electorateâs collection of antiquities and purchased important paintings for Dresdenâs Picture Gallery, to which his successors added numerous masterpieces, among them Raphaelâs Sistine Madonna (1512–1513).\n\nFriedrich August died in Warsaw on February 18, 1733, and was entombed in the royal crypt of Wawel Cathedral in Cracow. He was succeeded by his son, Friedrich August II of Saxony and August III of Poland. Of the numerous offspring the latter had by his consort, Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria, whom he wed in Vienna in 1719, the ninth child was Maria Josepha of Saxony (1731â1767). She was betrothed to Louis XVâs heir, the Dauphin Louis Ferdinand (1729â1765), and was the mother of the last three monarchs of the ill-fated Bourbon dynasty who, prior to and after the French Revolution, reigned in France as Louis XVI, Louis XVIII, and Charles X.\n\nThe Nelson-Atkins portrait shows the elector-king around the age of fifty. Represented as a warrior prince, he is outfitted resplendently in partly damascened steelDamascened steel: A steel of legendary sharpness and strength, whose method of forging has been lost to time. This type of steel shows complex patterns on the surface, which are the result of the unique forging methods used for its creation. Its name comes from a perceived resemblance to the rich tapestry patterns of damask silk. armor decorated with heads of fantastical beasts in relief. The area of the groin is protected by a flap of chain mail, and the subjectâs skin is cushioned from the heavy metal by strips of burgundy-red velvet edged with gold cording. Friedrich Augustâs taste for precious and semiprecious gems is reflected in some of the accoutrements complementing his attire. His neck is swathed in a white cambric stockstock: A type of neckwear made of a band of fine, usually white linen, carefully pleated and stitched to fit closely over a manâs shirt collar. edged with frilly lace, onto which is attached a ruby, and cuffs of more finely reticulated lace encircle his wrists. Around his torso and trailing down his back is a mantle of lynx fur lined with plush red velvet held in place by a cabochoncabochon: A gemstone that has been polished, usually into a rounded shape, but not faceted. brooch. Hanging at his left hip is an ornate parade sword, the gold grip of which is topped by a pommel in the shape of a dragonâs head with fangs bared; it is studded with brilliantsbrilliants: A gemstone cut with many facets to catch the light so as to shine brilliantly. and a large ruby. Augustus wears the insignia of the fifteenth-century Danish royal and chivalric Order of the Elephant, an honor he and his brother received in 1686 as a diplomatic gift from the hands of their maternal uncle, King Christian V, at Gottorp Castle in Schleswig. It consists of a broad sash of blue moirÃ© silkmoirÃ© silk: A French word âmoirÃ©,â derived from âmoirer,â meaning to water. Originally, it described a wavy texture on silk resembling waterâs effect on sand. Despite this association, water was not employed in its production. Instead, steam-filled rollers emboss the surface of the cloth with high pressure, creating an organic, non-repetitive pattern., to which is attached at the level of the subjectâs right hip the elephant pendentive ornament of white-enameled gold inset with a huge diamond.7The chivalric order was reinstituted and modified by Christian V in 1693, who based the ceremonials on those of the French royal Order of the Holy Spirit (Ordre du Saint-Esprit).\n\nAbove the subjectâs blue eyes, heavy jet-black eyebrows suggest the natural color of the graying or powdered locks of his long hair. The expression on his lips and the fleshiness of his face and hands bespeak the sensuous nature of a voluptuary. Indeed, even in his adolescence, Friedrich August was known to have an insatiable sexual appetite, and he fathered a prodigious number of children with women of different nationalities and social stations.8Numbering as many as several hundred (a number both implausible and impossible to prove), the best known of them was the son of his official Swedish and German mistress, Countess Aurora von KÃ¶nigsmark (1662â1728). In adulthood, the MarÃ©chal Comte Maurice de Saxe (1696â1750), a mercenary in the employ of Louis XV, bore a striking resemblance to his father. Among descendants of the MarÃ©chal Comte Maurice de Saxe is the celebrated French novelist, Aurore Dupin de Francueil, known by her pseudonym George Sand (1804â1876). Finally, his outstretched left hand, in a rhetorical gesture, points to a burning building from which issue masses of orange-red smoke dramatically obscuring the sky, in an allusion to his military exploits. The painterâs handling of creamy pigments and transparent-colored glazes is spectacularly assured.\n\nAt one time, Largillierreâs portrait of Augustus the Strong was erroneously believed to have been painted in 1697, the year the subject was first elected King of Poland, when he was twenty-seven years old. However, the French artist clearly depicted a man between the ages of forty-five and fifty, and this fact alone rules out such a dating. It could not possibly have been done from life and must have been based on a portrait by another artist, either a painter or a printmaker (as explained below).\n\nThe work was executed around 1715,9This dating was confirmed to the present author by the Largillierre specialist Dominique BrÃªme, Director of the MusÃ©e du Domaine de Sceaux, who is in the process of completing the catalogue raisonnÃ© of the artistâs works begun by the late Georges de Lastic. during or slightly after Augustusâs son and heir visited France as part of his Grand Tour (1711â19).10He secretly converted to Roman Catholicism in Bologna in 1712 so that he could inherit the crown of Poland. Traveling incognito, like his father had before him, the younger Friedrich August was called the Graf von Lausitz (in French, the Comte de Lusace), and he was accompanied by his tutor and spiritual mentor Graf JÃ³zef Kos (1680â1717), Palatine of Polish Livonia, his governor Freiherr Heinrich Reinhard von Hagen (1658â1729), and the aforementioned Raymond Le Plat.11On January 7, 1715, Le Plat engaged the services of Louis de Silvestre (1675â1760), a student of Charles Le Brun (1619â1690) and Bon Boullogne (1649â1717), as First Painter to Augustus the Strong. De Silvestre did not depart Paris for Dresden before the late spring of 1716. He remained there for over thirty years and only returned to Paris in 1748. See Georges ServiÃ©res, âArtistes FranÃ§ais Ã la Cour de Saxe au XIIIeme Siecle,â Gazette des BeauxâArts (1911): 333–34, 340. One of the three may have commissioned Largillierre to produce a pendant pairpendant: One of two paintings conceived as a pair and intended to be displayed togther. of portraits of Friedrich August and his son, including this one, but only the sonâs portrait could have been painted from life when the group was in Paris. The finest version of the younger Friedrich Augustâs portrait (Fig. 2)12Another autograph example in a private New York collection is reproduced by Dominique BrÃªme in âLargillierre: Un gÃ©ant retrouvÃ©,â Dossier de lâArt, no. 50, (September 1998): 55, fig. 57. In that work, the hilt of the sword is not studded with diamonds. was sold to the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, by the Heim Gallery in London during the firmâs winter exhibition in early 1968.13In 1966â67, it was lent from a private collection to an exhibition held at the Schloss Charlottenburg in Berlin, HÃ¶fische Bildnisse des SpÃ¤tbarock, and was catalogued as no. 50. See Helmut BoÌrsch-Supan,Â HoÌfische Bildnisse Des SpaÌtbarock, exh. cat. (Berlin: Verwaltung der Staatlichen SchloÌsser und GaÌrten, 1966). According to the dealerâs catalogue, the painting had previously belonged to a âPrincess von Hohenloheâ in Paris14See French Paintings and Sculptures of the 18th Century: Winter Exhibition, exh. cat. (London: Heim Gallery, 1968), 3. One cannot state categorically that the âPrincess von Hohenloheâ mentioned in the Heim Gallery publication was the notorious, double-dealing spy for the Nazi regime, the Jewish-born Prinzessin von (or zu) Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-SchillingsfÃ¼rst, nÃ©e Stephany Richter (1891â1972), but that is a distinct possibility. At various times before, during, and after World War II this adventuressâthe former lover of both an Austrian Archduke and Grand Duke of Tuscany (by whom she had a son) and of the British newspaper magnate Lord Rothermereâwas kept under surveillance by the Allies and had to be deported from France, Great Britain, and the United States. If she directly or indirectly sold Largillierreâs portrait of the Crown Prince of Saxony to the Baron dâHuart, the transaction probably occurred when she was living on the avenue George V in Paris in the 1920s. and to the Belgian attorney, politician, and collector Baron Albert dâHuart (1867â1937).15*M. le Baron dâH . . . * (Paris: HÃ´tel Drouot, December 7, 1938), lot 38, as Portrait dâhomme.\n\nIn Largillierreâs portrait of the heir apparent, which was painted from life in Paris in 1715, he too wears body armor and the insignia of the Order of the Elephant. The stylistic similarity of the two portraits, especially the rich handling of the armor, drapery, and accessories, suggests they were painted at virtually the same time. At the younger subjectâs side is a ceremonial sword, the hilt of which is set with diamonds, an item that could well be the sword that Louis XIV gave him after their visit at the ChÃ¢teau de Marly on May 15, 1715.16According to the memoirist Saint-Simon, just prior to their departure from France, the Saxon prince, Kos, and von Hagen were sent sumptuous presents by Louis XIV who was to die only three months later: âLe comte de Lusace, câest-Ã -dire le prince Ã©lecteur de Saxe, maintenant Ã©lecteur et roi de Pologne, aprÃ¨s son pÃ¨re, vint prendre congÃ© du roi dans son cabinet Ã Marly, qui lui fit beaucoup dâhonnÃªtetÃ©s, et au palatin de Livonie, qui Ã©tait le surintendant de sa conduite et de son voyage, et qui sâÃ©tait acquis par la sienne ici et partout, beaucoup de rÃ©putation. Le roi envoya au comte de Lusace une Ã©pÃ©e de diamants de 40 000 Ã©cus, au palatin de Livonie son portrait enrichi de fort beaux diamants, et le mÃªme prÃ©sent, mais moindre en valeur, au baron Haagen, gouverneur du princeâ (The Comte de Lusace, which is to say the Electoral Prince of Saxony, now Elector and King of Poland, following his father, came to take leave of the king in the study of the ChÃ¢teau de Marly; he extended many courtesies to him and to the Palatine of Livonia, who was supervising the princeâs activities during the voyage and who distinguished himself while he was here and everywhere else and had acquired by his own conduct a great reputation. The king sent to the Comte de Lusace a sword set with diamonds worth 40,000 Ã©cus, to the Palatine of Livonia a portrait of himself embellished with very beautiful diamonds, and the same present of a lesser value to Baron von Hagen, the princeâs governor). Louis de Rouvroy, Duc de Saint-Simon,Â MÃ©moires, ed. Pierre-Adolphe ChÃ©ruel (Paris: Librairie Hachette, 1878), 7:322. While in France, the nineteen-year-old prince had commissioned from Largillierreâs rival Hyacinthe Rigaud (1659â1743) a sumptuous full-length portrait of himself standing in a landscape (Fig. 3). In it, he wears full body armor and the robes and the insignia of the Order of the Elephant.17In Balechouâs engraving of Rigaudâs portrait of the electoral prince, the decorations of the Order of the Elephant were replaced by those of the Polish Order of the White Eagle, founded by Augustus the Strong in 1705. The large painting cost the prodigious sum of 4,000 livres.\n\nAnother notable portrait of Augustus the Strong is the bust-length marble (Fig. 4) by the French sculptor Guillaume Coustou I (1677â1746), the artist of the Chevaux de Marly (1745; Cour Marly, MusÃ©e du Louvre, Paris).18See the catalogue entry by Astrid Nielsen in Syndram and Saule, Splendeurs de la cour de Saxe, 157, no. 15. Antoine Coysevoxâs pupil FranÃ§ois Coudray (1678â1727) produced medallion portraits in marble and stucco of Augustus the Strong (Staatsbibliothek, Leipzig, and Schloss Moritzburg); like his compatriot Guillaume Hulot, Guillaume Coustouâs brother-in-law, Coudray, also traveled to Germany, in his case Berlin. In 1714 or 1715, before his departure from Paris, Coudray sculpted in marble a handsome bust of Friedrich Augustâs son and heir wearing armor (Staatlichen Kunstsammlung, Dresden, inv. no. H4 002/007); see Syndram and Saule, Splendeurs de la cour de Saxe, 157, no. 16. The dating of the bust has also caused scholars to speculate on its creation, including Paul Vitry and FranÃ§ois Souchal,19According to Souchal: âAuguste II Ã©tait un homme dâune vigoureuse laideur que lâartiste* [Coustou] *nâa certes pas esquivÃ©e mais quâil a su dÃ©passer en prÃªtant Ã ce visage ingrat une arrogance et un dÃ©dain qui ne manquent pas de grandeur. Les grosses lÃ¨vres qui trahissent la sensualitÃ© du personnage font une moue plus mÃ©prisante que gourmande. Coustou nâa pas davantage oubliÃ© le strabisme dont Ã©tait affligÃ© son royal modÃ¨le, mais en dirigeant le regard vers le haut, il lâattÃ©nue tout en accentuant par cet artifice lâair dâarrogance et de duretÃ© implacableâ (August II was a tremendously ugly man, a fact which the artist certainly did not evade but which he managed to alleviate by conferring on an unattractive face an arrogance and disdain that are not without grandeur. The thick lips betraying the individualâs sensuality suggest an ill temper that is more contemptuous than rapacious. Nor did Coustou overlook the strabismus [wandering eye] afflicting his royal subjectâs eyes by deceptively directing his gaze upwards, thus distracting from it while accentuating an air of haughtiness and an unyielding brutishness). FrancÌ§ois Souchal, *Les FreÌres Coustou, Nicolas (1658–1733)âGuillaume (1677–1746), et lâeÌvolution de la sculpture francÌ§aise du DoÌme des Invalides aux Chevaux de Marly* (Paris: E. de Boccard 1980), 179. both of whom have assigned it to the year 1704, speculating that the elector-king made a second visit to Paris in that year, although there is no documentary proof of such a trip. Coustou may have based the sculpture on another portrait, such as a rather crude engraving (Fig. 5) published around 1710 in the Theatrum Europaeum (a history of Europeâs German-speaking lands). Coustou is not known to have ever gone to Saxony or Poland, so it is likely that he carved the bust in Paris at the same time that the Kansas City and Melbourne portraits were commissioned from and executed by Largillierre. Around 1718, the German sculptor Paul Heermann (1673â1732) carved from life another splendid bust of the elder Friedrich August wearing armor (Fig. 6). In that work, the sitterâs head bears a striking resemblance to that of the elector-king as he was depicted by Largillierre in the work under discussion.\n\nAn early owner of the Kansas City portrait was the Hungarian Count SÃ¡muel Festetics de Tolna (1806â1862), whose wife, Wanda Izabella Klara RaczyÅska (1819â1845), was the daughter of the Polish diplomat, politician, and art historian Count Atanazy RaczyÅski (1788â1874) and his wife, Princess Anna ElÅ¼bieta RadziwiÅÅ (1785â1879). The RaczyÅskis and the RadziwiÅÅs had many ties to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which the subject of the Nelson-Atkins portrait by Largillierre ruled until his death. The painting was purchased from Festetics by Anselm Salomon von Rothschild (1803â1874) of the familyâs Vienna branch and passed through the family.20I am grateful to MacKenzie Mallon, Specialist, Provenance, at the Nelson-Atkins for sharing this insight. In 1938, the painting was confiscated from the Rothschilds by Nazi forces, but it was restituted to Clarice Adelaide von Rothschild, New York, on September 24, 1947. See provenance below.\n\nThere are at least three full or partial copies of the Nelson-Atkins painting: one at the MusÃ©e cantonal des Beaux-Arts, Lausanne, Switzerland;21Rosenfeld suggests that this may be the small copy listed in the posthumous inventory of Largillierreâs possessions drawn up in 1746: âItem un autre tableau reprÃ©sentant lâÃ©lecteur de Saxe Roy de Pologne estimÃ© cinquante livres cyâ (In addition, another painting representing the elector of Saxony, King of Poland estimated fifty livres). See Rosenfeld, Largillierre and the Eighteenth-Century Portrait, 396, no. 24. She also cites Hal N. Opperman as attributing the painting to Largillierreâs disciple, Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686–1755). Today, the MusÃ©e Cantonal des Beaux-Arts has no longer attributed the painting to Oudry but given it to the artist. another that sold through Galerie Fischer in Lucerne, Switzerland, June 14, 1970, lot 274 (formerly attributed to Hyacinthe Rigaud); and a bust-length version formerly in the collection of Count Jakub Ksawery Aleksander Potocki (1863â1934), whose current location is unknown.22Bequeathed by him to the Muzeum Narodowe, Warsaw, inv. no. 62644; stolen by the Nazi occupation forces during World War II and never recovered. See note 2 within the accompanying provenance entry. Largillierre also copied Friedrich Augustâs right hand in Assemblage of Hands (Fig. 7), a painting he may have executed in order to instruct studio assistants and outside collaborators.23See Exposition N. de Largillierre, exh. cat.

Finally, Louis de Silvestre (1675â1760) based, almost point for point, one of his portraits of Augustus the Strong (Fig. 8) on Largillierreâs masterpiece in Kansas City.24See note 11.\n\nJoseph Baillio\n\nNovember 2021\n\nNotes\n\nAccording to documents in the Nelson-Atkins curatorial files, the original back of the canvas bore the inscription âPeint par N. de LargilliÃ¨re,â which would not be the artistâs signature found on the back of so many of his works, because his patronym is misspelled. He invariably signed his name as âLargillierreâ (with two Rs) on his works and in archival documents. For example, Largillierreâs portrait of FranÃ§ois Armand de Gontaut, Duc de Biron (1714; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) is inscribed âPeint par N. de Largillierre / 1714â on the verso. See Myra Nan Rosenfeld, Largillierre and the Eighteenth-Century Portrait, exh. cat. (Montreal: Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, 1982), 256–57. Unfortunately, no photographs of the inscription were apparently taken before the Nelson-Atkins canvas was lined in 1954. It is also possible that someone mis-transcribed the artistâs name.\n\nThe most informative early biography of Nicolas de Largillierre is to be found in Antoine Joseph Dezallier dâArgenville, Supplement a lâAbrÃ©gÃ© de la vie des plus fameux peintres, pt. 3 (Paris: chez de Bure lâainÃ©, 1752), 246-53.\n\nAugustus the Strong may have used a pseudonym so that he could avoid diplomatic dutites while on his Grand Tour.

In adulthood, the MarÃ©chal Comte Maurice de Saxe (1696â1750), a mercenary in the employ of Louis XV, bore a striking resemblance to his father. Among the descendants of the MarÃ©chal Comte Maurice de Saxe is the celebrated French novelist, Aurore Dupin de Francueil, known by her pseudonym George Sand (1804â1876).\n\nThis dating was confirmed by the Largillierre specialist Dominique BrÃªme, Director of the MusÃ©e du Domaine de Sceaux, who is in the process of completing the catalogue raisonnÃ© of the artistâs works begun by the late Georges de Lastic.\n\nHe secretly converted to Roman Catholicism in Bologna in 1712 so that he could inherit the crown of Poland.\n\nOn January 7, 1715, Le Plat engaged the services of Louis de Silvestre (1675â1760), a student of Charles Le Brun (1619â1690) and Bon Boullogne (1649â1717), as First Painter to Augustus the Strong. De Silvestre did not depart Paris for Dresden before the late spring of 1716. He remained there for over thirty years and only returned to Paris in 1748.

At various times before, during, and after World War II this adventuressâthe former lover of both an Austrian Archduke and Grand Duke of Tuscany (by whom she had a son) and of the British newspaper magnate Lord Rothermereâwas kept under surveillance by the Allies and had to be deported from France, Great Britain, and the United States.

In 1665, once the boy had shown promise as a draftsman and painter, he was sent to London. By 1668, he had returned to Antwerp and was enrolled in the Guild of St. Luke as a pupil of Antoni Goubau (Flemish, 1616–1698), a painter of landscapes and low-life genre pictures known as bambocciate. In 1675, having completed an apprenticeship, he made a second trip to London where he was employed in the studios of Peter Lely (1618–1680) and Antonio Verrio (Italian, ca. 1639–1707), painters to the restored Stuart king, Charles II.\n\nSettling in Paris in 1679, Largillierre specialized in portraiture in the âgrand mannerâ style exemplified in the works of Anthony Van Dyck (Flemish, 1599–1641), Lely, and their followers and imitators. He soon became acquainted with Charles Le Brun (French, 1619–1690), then First Painter to Louis XIV and Director of the AcadÃ©mie Royale de peinture et de sculpture (founded in 1648). Largillierre was elected to full membership in the AcadÃ©mie in 1686 upon presentation of his magnificent diploma picture: a full-length portrait of Le Brun seated in his studio before an easel (MusÃ©e du Louvre, Paris). Largillierreâs earlier works reveal the influence of the Anglo-Flemish manner, in which he had been trained, but he quickly developed an even lusher, more sophisticated style described by Hal Opperman as âat once decorative and lordly.â1Hal N. Opperman, âNicolas de Largillierre,â in The Dictionary of Art (London, 1996), 13:788. He made yet another visit to London, and in 1685, he painted a superb double portrait, A Young Man with His Tutor (Samuel H. Kress Collection, National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC), and several spectacular still lifes. In 1699 and 1704, he exhibited at the Salon of the AcadÃ©mieSalon, the: Exhibitions organized by the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture (AcadÃ©mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture) and its successor the Academy of Fine Arts (AcadÃ©mie des Beaux Arts), which took place in Paris from 1667 onward. more than forty individual and group portraits, and pictures with religious subjects.\n\nLargillierreâs clientele consisted of international royalty and aristocracy, the prelature, high-ranking military officers, members of the wealthiest segment of the middle class, foreign dignitaries, literary personalities, artists, and artisans. The exact identity of the woman who posed for La Belle Strasbourgeoise (1703),2Autograph versions are known: one in the MusÃ©e des Beaux-Arts, Strasbourg, and another in the collection of the late Paul-Louis Weiller. perhaps his most celebrated work, is unknown. His large, Ex-voto group portrait of the members of Parisâs governing body in the presence of St. GeneviÃ¨ve (1696; Ãglise de Saint Ãtienne du Mont, Paris), with its high drama, celestial light, and vivid coloring, is an impressive tour de force of Baroque painting. Among his innumerable masterpieces, which are being catalogued by Dominique BrÃªme, are his portrayals of the sculptor Nicolas Coustou (ca. 1713; GemÃ¤ldegalerie, Berlin); the hauntingly beautiful British nun living in Paris, Elizabeth Throckmorton, Canoness of the Order of the Dames Augustines Anglaises (1729; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC); and the goldsmith Thomas Germain and his Wife (Anne-Denise Gauchelet) (1736; Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon).\n\nLargillierre, whose paintings helped consolidate the transition from the Baroque to the Rococo, ultimately became a patriarchal figure in the AcadÃ©mie, where he served as Professor, Chancellor, Rector, and Director of the institution. His large output also includes landscapes, sacred and profane history pictures, and still lifes, works in which he maintained an exceptionally high standard of execution.

In 1665, once the boy had shown promise as a draftsman and painter, he was sent to London. By 1668, he had returned to Antwerp and was enrolled in the Guild of St. Luke as a pupil of Antoni Goubau (Flemish, 1616–1698), a painter of landscapes and low-life genre pictures known as bambocciate. In 1675, having completed an apprenticeship, he made a second trip to London where he was employed in the studios of Peter Lely (1618–1680) and Antonio Verrio (Italian, ca. 1639–1707), painters to the restored Stuart king, Charles II.\n\nSettling in Paris in 1679, Largillierre specialized in portraiture in the âgrand mannerâ style exemplified in the works of Anthony Van Dyck (Flemish, 1599–1641), Lely, and their followers and imitators. He soon became acquainted with Charles Le Brun (French, 1619–1690), then First Painter to Louis XIV and Director of the AcadÃ©mie Royale de peinture et de sculpture (founded in 1648). Largillierre was elected to full membership in the AcadÃ©mie in 1686 upon presentation of his magnificent diploma picture: a full-length portrait of Le Brun seated in his studio before an easel (MusÃ©e du Louvre, Paris). Largillierreâs earlier works reveal the influence of the Anglo-Flemish manner, in which he had been trained, but he quickly developed an even lusher, more sophisticated style described by Hal Opperman as âat once decorative and lordly.â1Hal N. Opperman, âNicolas de Largillierre,â in The Dictionary of Art (London, 1996), 13:788. He made yet another visit to London, and in 1685, he painted a superb double portrait, A Young Man with His Tutor (Samuel H. Kress Collection, National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC), and several spectacular still lifes. In 1699 and 1704, he exhibited at the Salon of the AcadÃ©mieSalon, the: Exhibitions organized by the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture (AcadÃ©mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture) and its successor the Academy of Fine Arts (AcadÃ©mie des Beaux Arts), which took place in Paris from 1667 onward. more than forty individual and group portraits, and pictures with religious subjects.\n\nLargillierreâs clientele consisted of international royalty and aristocracy, the prelature, high-ranking military officers, members of the wealthiest segment of the middle class, foreign dignitaries, literary personalities, artists, and artisans. The exact identity of the woman who posed for La Belle Strasbourgeoise (1703),2Autograph versions are known: one in the MusÃ©e des Beaux-Arts, Strasbourg, and another in the collection of the late Paul-Louis Weiller. perhaps his most celebrated work, is unknown. His large, Ex-voto group portrait of the members of Parisâs governing body in the presence of St. GeneviÃ¨ve (1696; Ãglise de Saint Ãtienne du Mont, Paris), with its high drama, celestial light, and vivid coloring, is an impressive tour de force of Baroque painting. Among his innumerable masterpieces, which are being catalogued by Dominique BrÃªme, are his portrayals of the sculptor Nicolas Coustou (ca. 1713; GemÃ¤ldegalerie, Berlin); the hauntingly beautiful British nun living in Paris, Elizabeth Throckmorton, Canoness of the Order of the Dames Augustines Anglaises (1729; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC); and the goldsmith Thomas Germain and his Wife (Anne-Denise Gauchelet) (1736; Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon).\n\nLargillierre, whose paintings helped consolidate the transition from the Baroque to the Rococo, ultimately became a patriarchal figure in the AcadÃ©mie, where he served as Professor, Chancellor, Rector, and Director of the institution. His large output also includes landscapes, sacred and profane history pictures, and still lifes, works in which he maintained an exceptionally high standard of execution. With his Flemish cultural background, he championed the theories of Roger de Piles (1636â1713), which promoted color over design, and the study of nature over abstract idealization. This approach, which he shared with his wifeâs uncle, the history painter Charles de La Fosse (1636–1716), is reflected in his mature portraiture. His handling of impastoimpasto: A thick application of paint, often creating texture such as peaks and ridges. became richer and denser, the brushwork more tactile, the color contrasts more daring, and the drapery rhythms ever more elaborate and profuse.

The Rigaud painting was sent directly to the Dresden court by the artist after its completion. However, since neither the Nelson-Atkins portrait, nor its two possible pendant portraits by Largillierre of the Crown Prince, were ever part of the Saxon royal collection, it may have been the intent for them to remain in France.

It had been planned for offer at Der auserlesenen GemÃ¤lde-Sammlung alter Meister der italienischen, niederlÃ¤ndischen und altdeutschen Schule, nebst einer grossen Sammlung von Original-handzeichnungen der berÃ¼mtesten Meister, Kupferstiche, (besonders Portraite) und Lithgraphien des Herrn Samuel Grafen von Festetits [sic], Artaria und Altmann, Vienna, March 7 and April 11, 1859, lot 59, as PortrÃ¤t August des Starken, KÃ¶nigs von Polen. The March 7 date was postponed at the last minute, and the catalogue was reprinted with new sale datesâApril 11 and May 2, 1859âand with seven fewer lots. Lot 59 was one of these missing lots in the second catalogue printing because it had already been purchased privately by Rothschild. According to Johann Barkoczy (SÃ¡muel von Festetics de Tolnaâs brother-in-law and husband of his sister Antonia) in a letter to Atanazy RaczyÅski (SÃ¡muel von Festeticsâ father-in-law), March 6, 1859, âDas Bild von Rigaud (Portrait des Gr. Zinsendorf) ist bereits vor lÃ¤ngerer Zeit von Rothschild erstanden worden, samt einem groÃen Teniers (Atelier) und Nr 59 Largiliereâ (The painting by Rigaud [Portrait of Gr. Zinsendorf] was already acquired a long time ago by Rothschild, along with a large Teniers [Studio] and Nr. 59 Largillierre). This correspondence is transcribed in Kamila KÅudkiewicz, ed., Libri Veritatis Atanazego RaczyÅskiego/von Athanasius RaczyÅski. Supplement (PoznaÅ: Uniwersytet Im. Adama Mickiewicza W Poznaniu, 2019), 495â96.\n\nThe April 11 and May 2 Festetics sales were both eventually cancelled (as announced in âLicitations-Widerruf,â Wiener Zeitung (April 10, 1859): 1623), when the majority of the remaining lots were purchased ahead of time by dealer Georg Plach, who in turn sold a large number of the paintings to Viennese collector F. J. Gsell. Theodor von Frimmel, in âMittheilungen uÌber die GemaÌldesammlungen von Alt-Wien,â Berichte und Mittheilungen des Alterthums-Vereines zu Wien 27 (1891): 9, and Lexicon der Wiener GemÃ¤ldesammlungen (Munich: George MÃ¼ller Verlag, 1913), 1:368, describes annotations that supposedly appeared in two separate copies of the Festetics sale catalogue, one belonging to Plach, the other to collector Albert Figdor: âPlach schreibt dazu âfehlt.â Im zweiten Exemplar bei Dr. Figdor steht âRothschild,â was, wie die meisten Eintragungen jenes Exemplars, unrichtig ist. Denn das hier gemeinte Bild kam an den Grafen Edmund Zichy, nach dessen Tode die Erben es nach Ungarn gebracht habenâ (Plach writes that it is missing. In the second copy Dr. Figdor writes âRothschild,â which like most of the entries in that copy, is incorrect. Because the picture mentioned here came to Count Edmund Zichy, after whose death his heirs brought it to Hungary).\n\nAlthough von Frimmel writes that Figdorâs annotation was incorrect, it was von Frimmel himself who was in error, having confused the Nelson-Atkins painting with a similar portrait in the Edmund Zichy collection, which is today in the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest. Both paintings were attributed to Largillierre and depict the same sitter, but they differ in size and composition. The Nelson-Atkins portrait was in the Festetics collection, but there is no evidence it was ever owned by Plach or Gsell. Contrastingly, the Budapest portrait was not in the Festetics collection but was offered for sale by Plach two years later (Tableaux ancienes composant la belle collection de M. P., de Vienne, Hotel des Commissaires-Priseurs, Paris, April 20, 1861, lot 51) and appeared in Gsellâs posthumous sale in 1872, which was conducted by Plach (Versteigerung der Grossen Gallerie und der Ã¼brigen Kunst-Sammlungen des am 20. September 1871 verstorbenen Herrn F. J. Gsell, Georg Plach, SÃ¤len des KÃ¼nstlerhauses, Vienna, March 14, 1872, no. 63). See correspondence between MacKenzie Mallon, Specialist, Provenance, and Julia Tatrai, Head of Department of Old Master Paintings, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest, SeptemberâDecember 2020, NAMA curatorial files.\n\nPlachâs purchase of a large number of paintings from the Festetics sales has occasionally led to the assumption that he bought all of the Festetics paintings, but this is not the case. For example, Fritz Lugt wrote it was probable Plach acquired the entire collection; see Lugt, Les Marques de Collections de Dessins et dâEstampes (Amsterdam: Vereenigde Drukkerijen, 1921), p. 163, no. L.926. If Plach was involved in the purchase of the Nelson-Atkins portrait from the Festetics collection, it could have been as an agent on behalf of the Rothschild family, rather than as an outright purchaser. Lugt, Les Marques de Collections, 208, no. L.1188, describes Plach as instrumental to the enrichment of the three Rothschild brothersâ collections. However, Plachâs annotation in his copy of the 1859 Festetics sale catalogue (as described by von Frimmel in 1891, the location of which is today unknown) that this painting is âmissingâ tends to suggest Plach was not involved in its purchase. With thanks to Dr. Orsolya BubryÃ¡k, Institute of Art History, Research Centre for the Humanities, Budapest, for her help sorting out the different versions of the Festetics sale catalogue, and to M. Piotr MichaÅowski, Curator, Galeria Sztuki Europejskiej, Muzeum Narodowe w Poznaniu, for informing us of the Barkoczy-RaczyÅski correspondence.\n\n[3] The painting is definitively identified in the following Rothschild inventories: Nathaniel von Rothschild, Notizen, 30, as PortrÃ¤t August des Starken; âInventar Ã¼ber die in den Nathaniel Freiherr von Rothschildâschen NachlaÃ gehÃ¶rigen, in dem in Wien, IV. Bezirk, Theresianumgasse Nr. 14 befindlichen KunstgegenstÃ¤nde und EinrichtungsstÃ¼cke,â 1906, Rothschild Archive, London, 000/793, no. 50, as Portrait des KÃ¶nigs August des Starken; and âPalais Inventar,â 1934, Rothschild Archive, London, 000/793, no. 313/50, as Portrait des KÃ¶nigs August des Starken.\n\n[4] The collections of Alphonse and Clarice von Rothschild were confiscated by the Gestapo soon after the German annexation of Austria in March 1938. This painting was taken to the Nazi depot for confiscated art objects at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Neue Burg, Vienna, in 1939, where it was inventoried as number AR 863, âKÃ¶nig Friedrich IV v. DÃ¤nemark.â See Katalog beschlagnahmter Sammlungen, inbesondere der Rothschild-Sammlungen in Wien, Verlags-Nr. 4938, Staatsdruckerei Wien, 1939, Privatarchiv, reproduced in Sophie Lille, Was einmal war: Handbuch der enteigneten Kunstsammlungen Wiens (Vienna: Czernin Verlag, 2003), 1031. It was intended for Hitlerâs planned FÃ¼hrermuseum in Linz and included in inventories of Linz objects dated October 20, 1939, and July 31, 1940 (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 260, Records Concerning the Central Collecting Points: Munich, Restitution Research Records, Linz Museum: Consolidated Interrogation Report No. 4, Catalog ID 3725274). The painting was transferred to the Nazi repository at the KremsmÃ¼nster Abbey, where it was assigned inventory number K976. From there it was moved to the FÃ¼hrerbau in Munich on December 16, 1943, and assigned inventory number 3219 (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 260, Records Concerning the Central Collecting Points: Munich, Restitution Research Records, Reger, Hans: Transport Correspondence and Lists, Catalog ID 3725274). It was subsequently transferred from the FÃ¼hrerbau to the Nazi repository in a salt mine at Alt Aussee, Austria, on August 24, 1944 (Bundesarchiv, Koblenz, Germany, B323/6). Copies of Allied and German documents describing the paintingâs wartime movements are in the NAMA curatorial files. With thanks to Mag. Leonhard Weidinger, Provenance Researcher, Commission for Provenance Research of the Federal Chancellery, Vienna, for his assistance.\n\n[5] Following the discovery of the art objects in the Alt Aussee salt mine in May 1945, the officers of the U.S. Armyâs Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section (the âMonuments Menâ) worked to catalog every looted object and return it to its rightful owner. This painting was sent to the Munich Central Collecting Point on July 17, 1945, where it was assigned numbers Aussee 3237 and Mun. 4588 (Bundesarchiv, Koblenz, Germany, B323/656, MCCP Restitution Card File). Upon its transfer to the US Allied Commission of Austria on May 16, 1946, it returned to KremsmÃ¼nster from where it was restituted to the Rothschild family (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 260, Records of the Reparations and Restitutions Branch of the USACA Section, General Administrative Records, Stift KremsmÃ¼nster, R&R 41, Catalog ID 1561451).\n\n[6] Bundesdenkmalamt Archives, Vienna, Restitution Materials, Sammlung Alphons Rothschild, Kartons 53/1 and 53/3.
