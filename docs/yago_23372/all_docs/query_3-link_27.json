        "text": "Augustus II was famous for his amorous adventures and many mistresses. He was also said to have a luxurious, wanton court, and squandered his money on the arts. Legend says that he fathered around 300 illegitimate children. Count Karl von Pöllnitz published a biography of Augustus, the Strong one year after his death, in 1734. Count Karl traveled the European courts from 1710 until he was made Frederick the Great's Master of Ceremonies. He reported that Augustus had a mistress in both Saxony (for nine years) and Poland, after becoming King of Poland.\n\nHis favorite mistresses were Countess Cosel and Countess Maria Aurora Königsmark (1666-1728), a Swedish noblewoman, and sister of Count Philipp Christoph Königsmark. However, the Countess Cosel fell from grace, when she showed her jealousy towards a daughter of a Warsaw mine merchant, with whom he was rumored to have had an affair. Augustus had a daughter by her. Cosel (Madame Hoym) threatened to kill both mother and child. So Augustus found another mistress, Countess Maria Magalena von Denoff, of Warsaw. Denoff was married, but bore Augustus' son. Madame Cosel's spies told her and she went to Warsaw only to be turned back at the city gates. Augustus locked her up in a fortress until she died in 1765. For forty-nine years, she was imprisoned, even though Augustus himself died in 1733. Basically, she remained imprisioned for thirty-two years after his death, even though she pleaded for clemency again and again. When she was still in his good favor, in the early 1700s, Augustus had built her her own palace. Later, Countess Maria Aurora Königsmark of Sweden, was the abbess coadjutor at Quedlinburg. Countess Aurora von Königsmark bore him a son called Maurice, Count of Saxony and Marechal de Saxe (1696-1750), one of the greatest soldiers of his age. Maurice married Joan daughter of the Count of Leoben in 1714. They were divorced in 1721. Marechal was the grandfather of writer, George Sands. Marechal's half brothers, Chevalier de Saxe and Count Rutowski, were both military genuises. Augustus II had an illegitimate daughter called Countess Anna Orzelska, who was the daughter of a French merchant's wife in Warsaw. Her half-brother was Count Rudodolski, the son of a Turkish woman who was the chambermaid to Grafin Königsmark. It was thought that Countess Orzelska was the mistress of Frederick the Great. She was said to have first visited him at Schlors.\n\nYet another mistress was a Madame d'Esterle, their liason began in 1704. However, Augustus found out that she was having affairs with not only him, but several of his courtiers. He gave her twenty-four hours to pack her bags and leave the country. He had even bought her a pair of earrings valued at 40,000 florins. She was so moved, that she gave herself to Augustus without thought. When her husband found out, he was to renounce his martial rights, but was to give his name to any of their royal bastards that might result form their affair. Her husband was well-paid each year for this agreement.\n\nAnother mistress was Mademoiselle Dieskau. She had platinum blonde hair, blue eyes, porcelian skin, and thought to be a real beauty. However, she was lifeless. She was a virgin but Augustus II soon tired of her, in spite of the huge sum of money he paid her mother to have her.\n\nMistress Madame Lubomirski was named princess of Teschen shortly after Augustus was elected King of Poland. He gave her a case full of jewels for her favors."
