        "text": "The significance of Polish accounts about the wedding celebrations of Frederick Augustus and Maria Josepha in 1719 is not limited to the facts and data they contain, although the fact that they were intended for Augustus II’s Polish subjects and were to reflect the considerable Polish participation in the festivities in Dresden is not meaningless. However, the accounts are first of all an invaluable source of information about how the citizens of the Commonwealth perceived the splendour accompanying the marriage of Augustus II’s son; to what extent they were captivated by the variety of entertainments modelled on the famous Saxon carnivals; and whether the meticulous design of the wedding was able to result in their increased attachment to the Saxon House of Wettin.\n\nModern scholarly interest in Jan Dismas Zelenka (1679–1745) tends to focus on his compositional activities, while an understanding of his contribution as a contrabassist to the Dresden Hofkapelle dur- ing his first decade of service to Saxon Elector and King of Poland Augustus the Strong (1670–1733) remains substantially incomplete. This article examines how this second decade of the eighteenth cen- tury saw significant change to the Dresden bass section and orchestra as a whole, through a move away from engaging multi-instrumentalists to those specializing on a single instrument, the arrival of a new wave of internationally trained personnel and transition to new instrument types. Archival sources of the Dresden court record many details about individual employment and changes to the Hofkapelle’s size and administration from its reestablishment in 1709 (after being briefly disbanded). Drawing on these primary sources, this article reconstructs aspects of the careers of Zelenka and his colleagues in the contrabass section, and concludes that Zelenka’s activities as a contrabassist in Dresden should be viewed as a key part of a larger plan by the court to modernize the orchestra.\n\nFrederick the Great's (1712-1786) ambitions to make Prussia a great power were not established through war and ceremonial alone. Like Louis XIV, he shaped perceptions of Prussia through his patronage of the sciences and arts, including music. Alongside chamber music and opera buffa, opera seria was central to his creation of a Prussian musical profile. By establishing at the Royal Opera House a fixed repertoire of almost exclusively opera seria in an Italian manner by Carl Heinrich Graun and Johann Adolph Hasse, Frederick II promoted the \"ächte, große Oper\" of the Germans – and the efficacy of this policy can be seen in the nostalgia for Italian opera in Berlin between 1787 and 1797. However, upon his accession to the throne, Frederick William II (1744-1797) was confronted with the competing desires for Italian opera seria on the one hand and for \"german\" musical representation on the other. He attempted to satisfy these antithetical requirements of the nobility and the Bürgertum by a double strategy: he subsidized the Royal National Theatre, and divided the position of the Kapellmeister at the Royal Opera House between an Italian and a German. Nevertheless the debates about nationality, national genre and national identity continued, as expressed some critics in their preference for the operas of \"our\" \"German\" composer, Johann Friedrich Reichardt, over those of Felice Alessandri. At the same time, hopes of a \"große deutsche Oper\" were not fulfilled at the National Theatre by the dominance of \"Singspiele\" translated from opéras comiques. My paper aims to bring our narratives of nineteenth-century German musical identity into dialogue with earlier musical nation-building attempts in eighteenth-century Prussia. Such a dialogue does not merely rely on the ambiguity of the terms ‘nation' and ‘fatherland' in the German-speaking context. In contrast to existing accounts focussing on public discourse, I examine the role that the royal courts played in constructing the musical identity of the wider population, arguing that, particularly in the case of the musical policy of Frederick William II, there are significant continuities as well as conflicts between the emerging ideas of Prussian and German musical identity.\n\nThis article focuses on newly identified librettos of operas set to original German texts and produced at the Kärntnertortheater in the 1740s. The opera Die glückliche Vorbedeutung premiered in the spring of 1741 as part of the grandious celebrations of the birth of Archduke Joseph, the first son of Maria Theresa. The next German-language opera, Aristheus, was produced during the same year both in Vienna and Graz. Finally, the third opera, Hypsipile, was produced sometime before 1747. All three works should be understood in the social and political context of the Wars of the Austrian Succession.\n\nThe Bavarian Princess Maria Antonia, who married the Saxon Crown Prince Friedrich Christian in 1747, was active as a singer and vocal music composer. Over the years she built a music collection of great dimensions, in which the Italian chamber cantata played an important role. The collection is preserved at the SLUB in Dresden. Part of the manuscripts were brought from Munich to Dresden; others were collected directly in Dresden. The article examines the role of the cantata inside the collection, distinguishing between the cantatas performed by the princess and the cantatas dedicated to her. The survey shall be conducted on a sample of cantatas by Hasse, Ristori, Ferrandini and Schürer. The princess also collected cantatas by Italian authors who had no relationship with the Dresden or the Munich court. Among these are a collection of cantatas by G. B. Pergolesi and a copy of the large-scale cantata La Cassandra by B. Marcello. In this case, the author shall attempt to trace the origin of the manuscripts and formulate hypotheses about their possible destination.\n\nIn July 1786 Prince Carl Anselm of Thurn und Taxis concluded that he had no choice but to dissolve his Italian court opera. This owed in part to the success of the German theater, which had been established in 1784 to rival the Prince’s Hoftheater and contest his position as the Holy Roman Emperor’s representative to the Reichstag in Regensburg. New evidence challenges the prevailing view that the dissolution of the Taxis’s court opera marked the end of the family’s musical patronage and involvement in Regensburg’s cultural life. In the face of opposition from other Reichstag officials, the Thurn und Taxis continued their investment in music and theatrics, appropriating outdoor spectacles of a kind popular earlier in the century to project imperial power. The prince affirmed his position as the emperor’s representative in such older displays of affluence and standing but updated them to suit contemporary tastes. Carl Anselm’s musico-political theatrics around 1789 demonstrate that although Italian opera failed to articulate the legitimacy he intended to project, his culture of political representation conducted in the name of the emperor endured well into the twilight years of the eighteenth century. To understand the continued musical patronage of this contested and middling prince is to appreciate more fully the methods by which music, spectacle, and politics were negotiated during a transformative period in European history."
