        "text": "Wettynów ciąg dalszy. Może jakieś polskie muzeum ten obraz zainteresuje, nawet jako dobra i tania kopia. Trudno jest mi sobie wyobrazić by znalazł się w Polsce jakiś wiebiciel Augusta III, który chciałby powiesić ten obraz ‘przodka’ w swoim dworku.\n\nLot 77. After Hyacinthe Rigaud, 18th Century. Portrait of Frederick Augustus II, later Augustus III, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland (1696-1763), standing full-length, attended by a page, oil on canvas, 80.3 x 64cm (31 5/8 x 25 3/16in). Estimate £ 2,000 – 3,000. Bonhams. 07/22/20\n\nThe present work is after the original portrait by Rigaud which is now in the Staatlische Kunstsammlungen, Dresden (inv. no. 760). This painting was executed in 1715, when Frederick Augustus was 19 years old. Frederick Augustus was the only legitimate son of Augustus II (the Strong) and converted to the Roman Catholicism in 1712 to secure his candidacy for the Polish throne. In 1719 he married Maria Josepha, daughter of Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor. The nuptials fulfilled a dual function. On the one hand, it was to forge an alliance between Saxony and Austria for mutual protection against the rising power of Prussia. At the same time, Augustus the Strong hoped that this diplomatic alliance to the eldest child of one of the most powerful catholic nations in Europe would increase the likelihood of the Imperial Crown coming to Saxony. Frederick Augustus II became Elector of Saxony following his father’s death in 1733. He was elected King of Poland by a small minority on 5 October 1733 and was crowned in Kraków on 17 January 1734. Augustus III and Maria Josepha had fourteen children, among them Maria Josepha of Saxony who married Louis, Dauphin of France.\n\nDwie miniaturki przedstawiające Augusta II Mocnego z dobrą proweniencją, wzorowane na znanych portretach. Gdyby to był inny król to kto wie.\n\nLot 6. Two miniature portraits of Augustus the Strong (1670-1733), Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, circa 1720\n\nThe first attributed to Georg Friedrich Dinglinger (1666-1720), wearing a powdered wig, in armour with an ermine-lined blue cloak and the Star of the Order of the White Eagle; the second attributed to Charles Boit (1662-1727), wearing a powdered wig, armour and a crimson ermine-lined cloak with a star, enamel on copper, the first with gold rope-twist frame and suspension loop, the second with a later gilt-metal pierced floral scrollwork frame surmounted by a crown, the first: 2.8cm high, 4.6cm high overall; the second: 3.5cm high, 7.1cm overall (2). Estimate £ 1,000 – 1,500. Bonhams. 07/22/20\n\nProvenance: Collection of Gustav von Klemperer (1852-1926), Dresden; Thence by descent until sold at Sotheby’s London, 16 December 1998; Purchased at the above sale by the present owner.\n\nLiterature: Hans Buchheit, Miniaturen aus der Sammlung Gustav von Klemperer (1928), nos. 63 and 209 (illustrated on pl. 3); M. Cassidy-Geiger, Porcelain and Prestige. Princely Gifts and “White Gold” from Meissen, in M. Cassidy-Geiger (ed.), Fragile Diplomacy (2007), p. 6, fig. 1-9\n\nExhibited: New York, The Bard Graduate Centre, ‘Fagile Diplomacy’, 15 November 2007-10 February 2008, nos. 4 and 5\n\nBoth miniatures are after portraits of Augustus the Strong by Louis de Silvestre of 1716-18. Charles Boit also made an almost full-length miniature after a Silvestre portrait that was possibly recorded in the Pretiosenkammer by 1725 and is now in the Green Vaults in Dresden. A similar miniature attributed to Georg Friedrich Dinglinger, once in the possession of the Radziwill family, is now in the collection of the Royal Castle in Warsaw. See W. Schmidt/D. Syndram (eds.), Unter einer Krone (1997), nos. 506 (Silvestre), 510 (Boit) and 511 (attr. G.F. Dinglinger)."
