        "text": "In the year 1755, Stanisław August Poniatowski, a young Polish noble of the Poniatowski clan, arrived in St. Petersburg to assist his mentor the British ambassador to Russia, Charles Hanbury Williams.\n\nThe 23-year-old Pole had accepted the assignment for two reasons- 1. to advance his political career, and 2. to request assistance from the reigning Empress Elizabeth I to pass political reforms in the decaying Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nIt was during a party that Hanbury Williams noticed that his protégé had a secret admirer- the 26-year-old Grand Duchess Sophia Augusta Frederica, better known in history as Catherine the Great.\n\nCatherine was already married to her husband, Peter III, the heir to Russia’s imperial throne, but his abrasive attitude led her to initiate many affairs behind his back (and some right in front of him). And young Poniatowski was now her new target.\n\nHanbury Williams, sensing that a royal affair could prove to be diplomatically useful for Great Britain, decided to play matchmaker and help the Polish noble get the German-born Russian girl. On a cold December night, Poniatowski was escorted through a side entrance of the Winter Palace and into Katherine’s chambers.\n\nA handmaiden under Catherine’s trust was under orders to meow like a cat to signal when the coast was clear. Poniatowski was terrified of the Siberian prison sentence he would receive if he were found out, but the sight of the future Empress in a revealing white gown was enough to assuage his fears.\n\nFor the next two years, Poniatowski would continue to sneak into the Winter Palace for his sexual liaisons with Katherine, sometimes disguised as a musician. The two were initially close, as both shared interests in the arts, literature, and the developing ideals of the Enlightenment. Poniatowski eventually fell in love with the future Empress, hoping that she would eventually dismiss her abusive bore of a husband for her.\n\nUnfortunately for Poniatowski, this was not meant to be. As Catherine would soon discover, beneath the dashing exterior of this gallant Polish nobleman was a man of weak character, someone easily manipulated by stronger personalities and unable to stand up for himself.\n\nPart of this was due to his upbringing; Stanisław August Poniatowski grew up in luxury with an absentee father and an overly-doting mother. He never showed any real interest in martial activities such as saber-dueling or hunting, preferring the company of artists and books. The fact that he also swore off alcohol did not improve his image among the hard-drinking Polish nobility.\n\nOne day, Peter III, walked in on her and Stanisław during one of their romantic trysts. Peter, in character with his unpleasant personality, decided to humiliate his wife and her lover by forcing them to dine together with himself and his own mistress while smugly mocking them the entire time.\n\nStanisław did not defend himself or Catherine, meekly taking the insults throughout the whole ordeal. It was this occasion that first clued Katherine in to the fact that her lover was not the dashing Polish knight in shining armor she thought he was, but rather a weak-willed, spineless fop, utterly lacking in courage. But she did not despair that much- after all, weak-willed people can still be useful.\n\nStanisław August Poniatowski left St. Petersburg in 1757 to fight in the Seven Years’ War, and this separation marked the end of his and Catherine’s physical relationship. Fortunately for Stanisław, Catherine did not forget about him. In time, though, he probably wished that she had.\n\nThe Dance of the Eagles\n\nIn 1763, King Augustus III of Poland-Lithuania died, leaving the throne of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth vacant. A Royal Election was then called so the nobility of the Commonwealth could vote for their next monarch.\n\nHowever, these Royal Elections had been utter shams since 1696- the spreading Russian influence within the country and the presence of a Russian garrison meant that the next monarch would only be someone with the approval of the Russian Czar.\n\nCatherine, now Empress of Russia after overthrowing her husband, already had one candidate in mind- her former lover, Stanisław. Her decision was partially out of lingering affection, granting the man she slept with an entire kingdom.\n\nBut politics was her main concern- with a man as weak-willed as Poniatowski, she need not worry that Poland-Lithuania would slip out of her grasp and reform its broken political system. Stanisław August Poniatowski was thus crowned King after a not-so-free election on September 7th, 1764.\n\nUnfortunately for Katherine, it turned out that Stanisław was an ardent patriot with a genuine desire to rule the country on his own and enact some much-needed reforms. Through cooperation with its leading noble families, Stanisław was able to form a coalition strong enough to bypass the self-destructive liberum veto that had paralyzed sessions of the Sejm, or Polish Parliament, for decades, allowing some reforms to finally be passed(you can read more about the liberum veto here). The King would also go on to sponsor artists, political philosophers, and architects, leading to the building of many new palaces and galleries in Warsaw and the rest of the Commonwealth.\n\nAfter several years of the Commonwealth stirring from its political paralysis and threatening to slip out of Russia’s grasp, Catherine had enough. Nicholas Repnin, the Russian ambassador to Poland-Lithuania, arrived in Warsaw and statedCKatherine’s demands bluntly- there would be no more reforms of the political system, the liberum veto was to remain a permanent fixture of Commonwealth politics, and the rights and privileges of the nobility would continue under Russian protection. King Stanisław, while hurt at Katherine’s rejection of his reforms, did nothing and meekly allowed his years of work to be undone.\n\nThis capitulation to the Russians damaged Stanisław’s credibility with the Polish nobility, and many decided that the only hope for Poland-Lithuania now was to openly fight for their independence. In 1768, a Confederation of nobles in the town of Bar rose up against Russian influence in the country, leading to civil war in the Commonwealth.\n\nKing Stanisław was initially sympathetic to the Bar Confederates, though he did not openly support them. After a few radical members of the Confederation attempted to kidnap him, however, he changed his mind and openly assisted Russian armies arriving to crush the rebellion.\n\nIt was during this civil war that Catherine the Great received an offer from King Frederick the Great of Prussia- since Poland-Lithuania could obviously not defend itself anymore, why not carve out some of its territory for themselves? Catherine hesitated… for a few moments before agreeing to his proposal.\n\nThus, after the crushing of the Bar Confederation in 1772, Stanisław had to endure the greatest humiliation yet- standing by and approving the dismemberment of his own country.\n\nThere was little he could do, as the Polish army was weak and outdated, but many would go on to blame him for allowing this First Partition of Poland to happen. Russia, Prussia, and Austria all carved up chunks of the Commonwealth, and they made sure to give it a veneer of legality by forcing the Sejm to approve it.\n\nThere was a silver lining to this disaster- the carving up of the country was the wake-up call that alerted the more obstinate members of the Polish nobility to either accept reform or die. Stanisław also gained a little following the First Partition, as he was now permitted to form a Permanent Council to assist in running the country.\n\nThe Final Let-Down\n\nOn May 6th, 1787, King Stanisław August Poniatowski left Warsaw and traveled to the shores of the Dnieper River in Ukraine. Empress Catherine the Great was traveling down the river on a barge to see her newly conquered territories in the Crimea, and Stanisław hoped to intercept her along the way.\n\nBoth of them had been busy since the events of the First Partition. The reformers of the Commonwealth had been fervently working on plans to strengthen the country and free it from foreign influence, and they were now making arrangements for a “Great Sejm” to finalize these reforms. Meanwhile, the Russian Empire had conquered vast swathes of territory from the Ottomans, and they were now making plans for another war against them.\n\nThe purpose of Stanisław’s meeting with the Russian Empress was both personal and political. The Polish monarch hoped that he could stir up enough embers of passion to convince Catherine to let the Commonwealth thrive, even if only under the Russian shadow.\n\nHe also had a legitimate proposal that he hoped could assist in this endeavor- have the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth join the Russian Empire in an anti-Ottoman War not as a protectorate, but as a military ally. If he could prove that Russia was better off keeping the Commonwealth alive, perhaps he could prevent any future partitions?\n\nAfter waiting in the cold for several hours, Katherine’s barge finally arrived. When Stanisław entered the barge he introduced himself as “Count Poniatowski” rather than King, hoping that by reminding Catherine of the dashing Polish noble she fell for he could revive some old feelings. Although the two had not seen each other in thirty years, Catherine greeted her old lover warmly and allowed him to kiss her cheek rather than the customary kiss of the hand.\n\nThey then went to the Empress’ chambers to talk some business. It is unknown what was said in this private meeting, but it lasted only a few minutes and both later appeared ill at ease.\n\nFor the rest of Stanisław’s time on the barge, Katherine never seemed to have enough time for him. She accepted his written offer of a joint anti-Ottoman war with a vague “I’ll look into it” attitude, but she otherwise did not seem to enjoy talking with him.\n\nCatherine was impressed when Stanisław arranged a fireworks show meant to replicate an eruption of Mount Vesuvius, but she then canceled dinner that evening by claiming that she was overdue for a meeting with the Austrian Emperor. Thus, on May 8th, King Stanisław traveled back to Warsaw with very little to show for his long journey.\n\nEventually, Stanisław did get a reply from Katherine regarding an alliance. But the pleasantries of the response could barely hide the blunt truth- Poland-Lithuania would never be seen as an equal to Russia, and they were not allowed to have anything approaching a proper military. This rejection finally made Stanisław realize that his love for Catherine had always been unrequited, so he devoted himself fully to the reforms of the Great Sejm.\n\nOn May 3rd, 1791, the Great Sejm culminated with the establishment of a Constitution for the Commonwealth, the first of its kind in Europe. It revitalized the power of the central government and curbed the privileges of the nobility, and it called for the building of an army of 100,000 men. For King Stanisław, it must have felt like he was finally in control of the situation, and now the country could shake the bindings of foreign influence and regain what it had lost.\n\nCatherine the Great’s reaction, on the other hand, was one of horror. If Poland-Lithuania could regain its strength, it would eventually demand the return of lands seized in the First Partition. The liberal ideals of the May 3rd Constitution also represented a threat to Russian autocracy, one that had to be quashed. Catherine feared the Constitution could inspire a revolution like the ongoing French Revolution in Russia and Poland.\n\nThus, in 1792 the War in Defense of the Constitution began with Russian forces invading the Commonwealth. The revitalized Polish army was not yet ready for war- only 39,000 of the 100,000 men had been gathered. Despite this disadvantage, the talented command of Prince Józef Poniatowski, Stanisław’s nephew, and Tadeusz Kosciuszko, hero of the American Revolution, allowed Poland to gain a few victories even as they retreated from the Russian armies.\n\nAs the Russians approached Warsaw, however, King Stanisław grew agitated. It appeared to him that the work of the reformers and the Great Sejm was all for naught, and that soon Poland-Lithuania would face military occupation and another partition. He decided to send a message to Katherine in the hope of arranging some kind of settlement. The response he received was short- capitulate immediately.\n\nAs he relayed this response to his Permanent Council, some of them advocated continuing the fight. The army was still intact, and morale was high. The soldiers were willing to fight and die in a valiant defense of their country, and perhaps Prince Józef and Kosciuszko could pull off a miraculous victory?\n\nThe room turned towards their King for an answer. Nearly all of Stanisław’s life had been building up for this moment, a chance to prove his patriotism and his love for the ideals of the Enlightenment, an opportunity to prove he was his own man and free from the whims of the Russian Empress, the time to be a hero or even a martyr…\n\n….and he chose to capitulate. On July 24th, 1792, the Polish-Lithuanian army received the horrifying news that their King, the one who had helped draft the Constitution they were fighting to defend, was calling for their surrender. Many immediately resigned in disgust and sent back any medals they earned during the campaign.\n\nKosciuszko even considered kidnapping the King and continuing the fight anyway, but Prince Józef convinced him otherwise. Even the King’s nephew could not stand the sight of him, however, and he chose to go into voluntary exile.\n\nDespite Catherine’s promises to the contrary, King Stanisław could only look on helplessly as the destruction of the May 3rd Constitution culminated in the Second Partition of Poland, turning the country into a rump state doomed to eventual destruction. The Polish people lost all respect they still had for their cowardly monarch, and a few radicals looked towards Revolutionary France and wondered if the Jacobins were onto something after all.\n\nThe Broken King\n\nKing Stanisław August Poniatowski was effectively a political non-entity in the last years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He had almost no power left, and no one was willing to listen to him anyway.\n\nWhen Tadeusz Kosciuszko returned to launch a general uprising in one final attempt to save Poland-Lithuania from destruction, the war-hero refused all offers of help from the disgraced monarch. Although Kosciuszko did protect the King from several plots made by the newly-created Polish Jacobin faction, Stanisław spitefully refused to give the general the maps he needed to properly prepare a defense of the country.\n\nWhen Catherine the Great heard about the launch of the Kosciuscko Uprising, she decided it was now time to end that troublesome nation once and for all. Despite a spirited defense, Russian numbers won the day and the uprising was crushed. King Stanisław did try to salvage something out of this final disaster, but Catherine bluntly ordered him to abdicate.\n\nThus, on October 24th, 1795, the Third Partition put an end to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Stanisław was first taken to Grodno and then to St. Petersburg following Catherine’s death in 1796. He was given a generous pension, but was not allowed to travel out of Russia. He would die on February 12th, 1798, of a stroke at age 66.\n\nTo this day, King Stanisław holds a controversial reputation in Poland. While a true patriot and a reformer, his spineless nature and inability to stand up against Empress Catherine would sabotage all of his earnest efforts and lead to the destruction of the country he was supposed to save.\n\nThere were many opportunities for him to break free of the Russian leash, but his unrequited love for the Russian Empress would cement his legacy as a man who knew what had to be done but utterly lacked the strength and will to pull through to the end. History does not care for good intentions, it cares for results, and Stanisław August Poniatowski simply could not deliver."
