Ca. 1765\n\nAnonymous\n\nIn 1765 María Luisa de Borbón (1745-1792), daughter of Charles III, married the Austrian Archduke Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in Innsbruck. Her exquisite clothes and hairstyle reflect the fashion of that year. Just visible on the right side of the dress at bust level is the dark bow and gilt surround of the plaque of the Starred Cross of Maria Theresa, which María Luisa re\n\nJavier of Bourbon and Saxony, Infante of Spain\n\nOil on canvas. 1767\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nFrancisco Javier (1757-1771), youngest son of Charles III and Maria Amalia of Saxony, was painted by Mengs in the Palace of San Ildefonso, Segovia, as were his brothers, Antonio and Gabriel. The pose and expression are particularly natural and the traditional accessories of royal portraiture are reduced to the column, curtain and insignias of the Orders of the Golden Fleece, Santiago and San Genna\n\nMaria Amalia of Saxony\n\nOil on unlined canvas. 1767\n\nCastillo, José del (Retouched by: Mengs, Anton Raphael)\n\nA frontal view of the Queen. She sits, wearing a red silk dress with white sleeves and bonnet. Her right arm rests very naturally on a table, while her left holds a book. She is marking one of the pages with her finger as though she had just interrupted her reading. This is quite common in female portraits. Maria Amalia was born to Friedrich Augustus III, King of Poland and elector of Saxony; and\n\nMaria Amalia de Saxony\n\nOil on canvas. 1738\n\nSilvestre the Younger, Louis de\n\nPainted in relation to the sitter’s forthcoming marriage to Charles VII of Naples, future Charles III of Spain, this portrait has an elegance and refinement that reflects the prevailing Rococo court style. The splendour and grandeur of Rigaud’s court portraits is here tempered in favour of a more delicate, decorative manner. Daughter of Frederick Augustus III, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony,\n\nGabriel of Bourbon and Saxony, Infante of Spain\n\nOil on canvas. 1767\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nSon of Charles III and Maria Amalia of Saxony, Gabriel (1752-1788) was a celebrated patron of art and a translator of the Roman historian Sallust. He wears the Cross of Malta together with the insignias of the Orders of the Golden Fleece, San Gennaro and the Saint-Esprit. Mengs introduced a sense of naturalness and dignified simplicity into royal portraiture.\n\nJohn Frederick I of Saxony\n\nOil on canvas. 1548\n\nTitian (Tiziano Vecellio)\n\nJohn Frederick I of Saxony (Torgau, 30 June 1503–Jena, 3 March 1554), Duke of Saxony-Wittenberg from 1532, was the principal defender of Luther, a fact that brought him into conflict with Charles V. In 1546 these differences resulted in an armed conflict that culminated at Mühlberg on 24 April 1547 when the Imperial army defeated the Schmalkaldic League and captured its leaders, John Frederic\n\nAntonio Pascual of Bourbon and Saxony, Infante of Spain\n\nOil on canvas. 1767\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nMengs depicted the Infante Antonio (1755-1817), son of Charles III and Maria Amalia of Saxony, in the Palace of San Ildefonso, Segovia. The artist made use of the type of elegant, natural portrait that he had developed in Rome to depict English visitors. The Infante wears the insignias of the Orders of the Golden Fleece and of San Gennaro and Santiago.\n\nMaría Isabel of Bourbon and Saxony, Infanta of Naples and Spain\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1746\n\nThe Infanta (1743-1749), the daughter of Charles III, is seen playing with a little dog, as in another portrait of her at an earlier age and in that of The Family of Philip V. The picture may have been sent to Spain from Naples, or brought with him by Charles III when he ascended to the throne of Spain, in memory of his daughter, by then already deceased.\n\nInfanta Maria Josefa\n\nOil on canvas. 1800\n\nGoya y Lucientes, Francisco de\n\nThis is one of ten preparatory sketches for The Family of Charles IV. Goya executed them in Aranjuez shortly after he was made First Court Painter. All make use of a reddish-orange ground. Daughter of Charles III and Maria Amalia of Saxony, the sitter died unmarried in 1801 aged 57. Her coquettish hair ornament has a birdof- paradise feather, while the false beauty spot on her temple was an outmod\n\nQueen Maria Amalia of Saxony\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1744\n\nBonito, Giuseppe\n\nCharles III described Maria Amalia of Saxony (1724-1760) as possessing the wit of an angel, and felt himself to be the happiest and most fortunate man in the world. The portrait of his young wife reflects his affectionate words and the complicity between the married couple, since appearing in it is the crown that Charles wore in Palermo on the day of his enthronement as King of Naples and Sicily.\n\nInfante Antonio Pascual\n\nOil on canvas. 1800\n\nGoya y Lucientes, Francisco de\n\nThis is a preparatory sketch for The Family of Charles IV. Brother of Charles IV, the sitter was born in Naples in 1755. In 1795 he married his niece, the Infanta María Amalia, who died without heir in 1798. In 1808 Ferdinand VII appointed him president of the Junta Suprema of the government while the monarch was obliged to attend Napoleon’s summons to France. During the War of Independence\n\nFuneral Catafalque of Maria Amalia of Saxony in Barcelona\n\nEtching on laid paper. 1761\n\nValls, Ignacio - Engraver; Grau, Carlos - Drafstman\n\nThe Queen Maria Amalia died on 27 September 1760, leaving Charles III a widower. He never remarried. This etching shows the funeral held in Barcelona. The work of the brothers Francisco and Manuel Tramullas, the print represents different allegories crowned by Eternal Bliss.\n\nVisit of Queen Maria Amalia of Saxony to the Arch of Trajan in Benevento\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1759\n\nJoli, Antonio\n\nThis architectural landscape showing the ancient Roman city of Benevento, near Naples, was painted around 1759 by Antonio Joli of Modena. A painter of theatre sets and vedute, Joli worked for theatres in Venice, London and Madrid, and painted numerous scenes for private collectors, which show the influence of Giovanni Paolo Panini, Gaspare Vanvitelli and Giovanni Antonio Canal (Canaletto). In 1756\n\nJohn Frederick the Magnanimous, Elector of Saxony\n\nOil on panel. 1533\n\nCranach the Elder, Lucas (Workshop of)\n\nThis painting was made following the Mechanised procedures used by various German workshops in the 16th century, including that of Lucas Cranach. Between 1532 and 1533 Cranach produced 120 similar portraits of Electors of Saxony, commissioned by John Frederick following his ascent to the title in 1532 and which Cranach’s numerous activities (as Burgomaster of Wittenberg, publisher and pharmacist)\n\nThe Infanta María Luisa of Bourbon and Saxony\n\nPastel on paper. 1763\n\nTiepolo, Lorenzo\n\nSmiling with a direct, vivacious expression, the Infanta faces the viewer in this half-length portrait. She wears ermine robes cheerfully adorned with silk at the neck and a fur cap. A parrot perches on her right hand. Her facial features match those of the Infanta María Luisa of Bourbon, born in Naples in 1745 to Charles III and Mary Amalia of Saxony. In 1765, she married Leopold of Lorrai\n\nThe Infante Don Antonio Pascual of Bourbon and Saxony (?)\n\nPastel on paper. 1763\n\nTiepolo, Lorenzo\n\nFacing the viewer in this half-length portrait, the Infante holds a shotgun and wears the insignias of the Golden Fleece and of the orders of Saint Gennaro and the Saint-Esprit on his chest.While this painting was identified by Ezquerra del Bayo as a likeness of the Infante Gabriel, it might, instead, be of the Infante Antonio Pasual, who was born in Naples in 1755 and died in 1817.
