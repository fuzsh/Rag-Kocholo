        "text": "Charles X (Charles Philippe; October 9, 1757 – November 6, 1836) was King of France and Navarre from September 16, 1824 until August 2, 1830. An uncle of the uncrowned Louis XVII and younger brother to reigning kings Louis XVI and Louis XVIII, he supported the latter in exile.\n\nCharles Philippe of France was born in 1757, at the Palace of Versailles, the youngest son of the Dauphin Louis of France and his second wife, Princess Marie Josèpha of Saxony, a daughter of August III, Prince-Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, and Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria, the daughter of Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor and Princess Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nAugust III of Poland as Elector of Saxony in the Holy Roman Empire was known as Friedrich August II.\n\nDauphin Louis was eldest son of King Louis XV of France and Navarre, was widowed on July 22, 1746 when his wife, Infanta Maria Teresa of Spain, died giving birth to their only child, a daughter named after herself. Infanta Maria Teresa of Spain was the daughter of King Felipe V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese. King Felipe V of Spain was a member of the House of Bourbon and a grandson of King Louis XIV.\n\nKing Fernando VI of Spain, Maria Teresa’s half-brother, had offered the Dauphin another sister, Infanta Maria Antonia. Instead, the King Louis XV of France and his mistress Madame de Pompadour wanted to open up diplomatic channels.\n\nOn January 10, 1747, Louis was married by proxy at Dresden to Maria Josepha of Saxony, the 15-year-old younger daughter of Augustus III, Prince-Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, and his wife Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria. A second marriage ceremony took place in person at Versailles on 9 February 1747.\n\nCharles Philippe was created Count of Artois at birth by his grandfather, the reigning King Louis XV.\n\nAs the youngest male in the family, Charles Philippe seemed unlikely ever to become king. His eldest brother, Louis Joseph, Duke of Burgundy, died unexpectedly in 1761, which moved Charles Philippe up one place in the line of succession.\n\nAt the death of his father in 1765, Charles’s oldest surviving brother, Louis Auguste, became the new Dauphin (the heir apparent to the French throne). Their mother Marie Josèphe, who never recovered from the loss of her husband, died in March 1767 from tuberculosis. This left Charles Philippe an orphan at the age of nine, along with his siblings Louis Auguste, Louis Stanislas, Count of Provence, Clotilde (“Madame Clotilde”), and Élisabeth (“Madame Élisabeth”).\n\n1773, Charles Philippe married Princess Maria Theresa of Savoy (1756 – 1805). Princess Maria Theresa of Savoy was born at the Royal Palace in Turin during the reign of her grandfather King Carlo Emmanuel III of Sardinia. She was the daughter of the heir apparent , Victor Amadeus and his wife Infanta Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain, the youngest daughter of Felipe V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese.\n\nPrincess Maria Theresa of Savoy was the couple’s third daughter and fifth child of twelve children. She was raised with her sister Princess Maria Giuseppina who was three years her senior and whom she would join later as a member of the Royal House of France, when her sister married Louis Stanislas, Count of Provence (and later King Louis XVIII of France and Navarre).\n\nThe future King Charles X, as the Count of Artois had previously been intended to marry Louise Adélaïde de Bourbon, the third and last child of Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Condé and his wife, Charlotte de Rohan (1737–1760),\n\nHowever, the union never took place as her rank was much lower than Artois who, as a male-line descendant of a French monarch, was a grandson of France, thus he was entitled to the style His Royal Highness. Louise Adélaïde de Bourbon, despite being born a princesse du sang; was from a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon and this only entitled her to the style of Her Serene Highness.\n\nAs her husband was the grandson of a king, the newly named Marie Thérèse of Savoy held the rank of granddaughter of France, and was commonly referred to by the simple style Madame la comtesse d’Artois.\n\nAccession to the Throne\n\nCharles’ brother King Louis XVIII’s health had been worsening since the beginning of 1824. Suffering from both dry and wet gangrene in his legs and spine, he died on September 16, of that year, aged almost 69. Charles, by now in his 67th year, succeeded him to the throne as King Charles X of France and Navarre.\n\nIn his first act as king, Charles attempted to unify the House of Bourbon by granting the style of Royal Highness to his cousins of the House of Orléans, who had been deprived of this by Louis XVIII because of the former Duke of Orléans’ role in the death of Louis XVI.\n\nOn May 29, 1825, King Charles X was anointed at the cathedral of Reims, the traditional site of consecration of French kings; it had been unused since 1775, as Louis XVIII had forgone the ceremony to avoid controversy. It was in the venerable cathedral of Notre-Dame at Paris that Napoleon had consecrated his revolutionary empire; but in ascending the throne of his ancestors, Charles reverted to the old place of coronation used by the kings of France from the early ages of the monarchy.\n\nPrincess Anna Sophie of Denmark and Norway ( September 1, 1647 – July 1, 1717) was the eldest daughter of King Frederik III of Denmark and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and Electress of Saxony from 1680 to 1691 as the wife of Johann Georg III, Elector of Saxony.\n\nAnna Sophie was born in Flensburg, the second child and first daughter of Frederik III of Denmark and Norway and his wife, Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, daughter of Georg, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and Anne Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nIn 1662, the negotiations about her marriage were initiated, and she met with Johann Georg of Saxony who visited the Danish court with his mother. In 1663, a celebration was held at Copenhagen Castle honouring the fifteen-year-old princess’s engagement to the future Johann Georg III, Elector of Saxony, the only son of Johann George II and Magdalene Sybille of Brandenburg-Bayreuth.\n\nShe had an elder brother, Christian. Her paternal grandfather, King Christian IV, died when she was six months old, and after many months of deliberation, the Rigsraadet royal council and Estates elected her father king. He was crowned Frederik III on November 23, 1648. Her parents had six more children, two of whom died in infancy. Her surviving siblings were Frederica Amalia, Wilhelmina Ernestine, George, and Ulrika Eleonora.\n\nAnna Sophie received a fine education. Besides her native Danish, she knew German, Latin, French, Spanish and Italian. She is described physically as having thick dark eyebrows and long curving nose. During her childhood, she as well as her sisters were brought up under the supervision of the royal governess Helena von Westphalen. In 1663, she was given her own court under Enevold Parsberg.\n\nJohann Georg of Saxony and his mother once again visited Denmark in person to be present. Anna Sophie and Johann Georg were married three years later, on October 9, 1666. The Polish king John III Sobieski later said of her husband, “[He] is an honest man with a straight heart.”\n\nThe relationship between Anna Sophie and Johann Georg is not described as a happy one. Her husband also had an illegitimate son by his official mistress, a Venetian opera singer named Margarita Salicola, and may have had a daughter, Magdalena Sibylla of Neidschutz, with Ursula Margarethe of Haugwitz. Both her sons were initially brought up by Danish ladies-in-waiting sent to Dresden by her mother. The relationship between Anna Sophie and her two sons are described as somewhat tense.\n\nAnna Sophie’s father died on February 9, 1670 and was succeeded by her elder brother, Christian V, with whom she held a very active correspondence and discussed political matters. She visited Denmark that year and expressed her sympathy for the imprisoned Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, her half aunt.\n\nIn 1680, Anna Sophie became Electress of Saxony when her husband became the Elector Johann Georg III of Saxony. Her widowed sister Wilhelmina Ernestine, Dowager Electress Palatine, came to live with her in Saxony in 1685. Anna Sophie had her eldest son engaged to her niece, Princess Sophia Hedwig of Denmark against the will of the Saxon court; however, when her son succeeded his father as elector in 1691, he broke the engagement.\n\nDowager Electress\n\nHer husband died in 1692 in Tübingen of an epidemic illness, probably cholera or the plague, and was buried in the Cathedral of Freiberg. The next year, Anna Sophie attempted to end the love affair between her elder son, then Elector Johann Georg IV, and his mistress, Magdalene Sibylle “Billa” of Neidschutz, with whom he had been living openly since his father’s death.\n\nHer late husband had tried to break up the couple, perhaps motivated by fears that a close blood relationship existed between the lovers—for Billa may have been his own daughter by Ursula Margarethe of Haugwitz, and therefore John George IV’s half-sister. John George IV was either ignorant of the possibility that he and Billa were committing incest, or he disregarded the claim as a malicious rumor.\n\nAnna Sophie forced her son into marrying Eleonore Erdmuthe of Saxe-Eisenach, a German noblewoman, and the eldest child of Johann Georg I, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach, and Johannetta of Sayn-Wittgenstein. but the marriage proved a disastrous failure. Johann Georg IV not only abandoned his bride, leaving her at the Hofe (the official residence of the Elector) to be with his mistress at another palace, but eventually tried to murder her so he could marry Billa.\n\nAnna Sophie brought up her grandson Friedrich August, born on October 17, 1696, the only child of her second son and his estranged, self-exiled wife, Christiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth.\n\nThe boy would one day succeed his father as King August III of Poland. Anna Sophie and her daughter-in-law got on well, both women agreeing especially on matters of religion, and Eberhardine visited her son often.\n\nIn her later years, Anna Sophie lived with her sister Wilhelmina Ernestine at Castle Lichtenburg. She died in Prettin.\n\nOn this date in History: Final abdication of King Stanislaus I of Poland, January 27, 1736.\n\nStanislaus I (October 20,1677 – February 23, 1766) was King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Duke of Lorraine and a count of the Holy Roman Empire. Reigned as King of Poland.\n\nStanislaus was born, Stanislaus Leszczyński, into a powerful magnate family of Greater Poland. Because of his family’s great wealth this gave him the opportunity to travel to western Europe in his youth. In 1702 King Carl XII of Sweden invaded Poland as part of a continuing series of conflicts between the powers of northern Europe. Carl XII forced the Polish nobility to depose Poland’s king, Augustus II the Strong, and then placed Stanisław on the throne on October 4, 1704.\n\nIn 1709 Carl XII was defeated by the Russians, under Czar Peter I the Great, at the Battle of Poltava and returned to Sweden. In the absence of Swedish support, former king Augustus II returned to Poland and regained the Polish throne. Stanislaus left the country to settle in the French province of Alsace. In 1725 Stanisław’s daughter Marie Leszczyńska married King Louis XV of France.\n\nWhen Augustus II died in 1733, Stanisłaus sought to regain the Polish throne with the help of French support for his candidacy. Stanislaus’ son-in-law Louis XV supported his claims to the Polish throne which led to the War of the Polish Succession.\n\nIn September 1733, Stanislaus himself arrived at Warsaw, having traveled night and day through central Europe disguised as a coachman. On the following day, despite many protests, Stanislaus was duly elected King of Poland for the second time. However, Russia was opposed to any nominee of France and Sweden. Russia protested against his election at once, in favor of the new Elector of Saxony, Friedrich-August II, (son of Augustus II of Poland) as being the legitimate candidate of her Austrian ally.\n\nAfter Friedrich-August II of Saxony was proclaimed King August III of Poland at Warsaw, a Russian army of 20,000 under Peter Lacy, proceeded to besiege Stanislaus at Danzig where he was entrenched with his partisans (including the Primate and the French and Swedish ministers) to await the relief that had been promised by France.\n\nOn May 20, 1735 the long-expected French fleet appeared and disembarked 2,400 men on Westerplatte. A week later, this little army bravely tried to force the Russian entrenchments, but was finally compelled to surrender. This was the first time that France and Russia had met as foes in the field. On 30 June 1735, Danzig capitulated unconditionally, after sustaining a siege of 135 days which cost the Russians 8,000 men.\n\nDisguised as a peasant, Stanisłaus fled Poland and reappeared at Königsberg where he briefly met the future King Friedrich II the Great of Prussia. While at Königsberg he issued a manifesto to his partisans which resulted in the formation of a confederation on his behalf. A Polish envoy was sent to Paris to urge France to invade Saxony with at least 40,000 men. In Ukraine too, Count Nicholas Potocki kept on foot to support Stanislaus a motley host of 50,000 men, which was ultimately scattered by the Russians.\n\nOn January 27, 1736, Stanisław again abdicated the throne, but received in compensation the Duchy of Lorraine and of Bar for life, which was to revert to France on his death. In 1738, he sold his estates of Rydzyna and Leszno to Count (later Prince) Alexander Joseph Sułkowski. He settled at Lunéville, founded there in 1750 both the Académie de Stanislas and Bibliothèque municipale de Nancy, and devoted himself for the rest of his life to science and philanthropy, engaging most notably in controversy with Rousseau. He also published Głos wolny wolność ubezpieczający, one of the most important political treatises of the Polish Enlightenment.\n\nStanisłaus was still alive when his great-great-granddaughter, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, was born in 1762. She was the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II and his wife Princess Isabella de Bourbon-Parma (herself the daughter of Princess Louise Élisabeth of France who, in turn, was the granddaughter of King Stanislaus). In his last years, his close friend, the Hungarian-born Marshal of France Ladislas Ignace de Berchenylived on his estate to provide company.\n\nStanislaus Leszczyński died in 1766, aged 88 as a result of serious burns – his silk attire caught fire from a spark while the King was snoozing near the fireplace in his palace in Lunéville. He was medically treated for several days but died of wounds on 23 February. He was the longest living Polish king.\n\nOriginally buried in the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours, Nancy, following the French Revolution his remains were brought back to Polandand buried in the royal tomb of the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków."
