        "text": "In OTL, Stanisław Leszczyński was elected the King of Poland-Lithuania by the magnates of Poland in 1733 following the death of Augustus II the Strong. However, his election was opposed by Russia and Austria who feared a reemergent Poland on their borders. As soon as Stanislaus was elected, Peter Lacy led an army of 30,000 Russians across the border. He organized the counter-election of the candidate that Russia had defaulted to, Augustus II's son, Augustus of Saxony. Then Peter Lacy mopped up the still disorganized Polish resistance and forced Stanislaus to flee to Danzig, which Lacy placed under siege. Ultimately, Lacy took Danzig and Stanislaus had to flee from Poland. Without Stanislaus, the remaining Polish resistance was defeated and Poland was handed to Augustus of Saxony, who became Augustus III and oversaw one of the most considerable periods of decadent decline in Polish history.\n\nWhat if instead Stanislaus wins the throne?\n\nNow, I do not imagine for one second that Stanislaus can get Russia or Austria to approve his election as they fundamentally do not want a strong and independently-minded Poland on their borders. So they will not be endorsing Stanislaus' election. And any other Pole they select would be selected because they would be weak. So I do not think that finding a different Pole is a good solution for avoiding Augustus III.\n\nWhere I think the possibilities lie are in Russia being distracted and/or France supporting Stanislaus seriously. In OTL, Russia provided the majority of soldiers for the installation of Stanislaus. The Imperials were focused on fighting the French on the Rhenish and Italian fronts. So if Russia is distracted and cannot deploy to Poland then the Poles may have a chance against the Austrian and Saxon troops against them. The way to distract the Russians in my mind is with an Ottoman or Ottoman-Swedish war against Russia. In OTL, the French tried to put this alliance together and the Swedes were in favor of it. The Ottomans were also willing to attack Russia so long as France promised that it would declare war on Austria and not make peace until the Ottomans made peace. Fleury (due to his Christianity and general distaste toward war) said no repeatedly until he finally changed his mind and said something along the lines of ensuring that the Ottomans got a favorable peace. But by that time it was too late and Stanislaus' regime had already fallen.\n\nI think if Fleury says yes earlier or more aggressive French leadership is in power then we can have an Ottoman attack on the Russians that forces the Russians to divert their attention to the south. If the Swedes also join in the Russians also have that threat to deal with. In the meantime, Stanislaus can establish his rule and the Russians can recognize it just to keep that front peaceful.\n\nOn the note of more aggressive French leadership, France used a little over 2/3rds of their projected resources at the time compared to the Austrians, Saxons, Sardinians, and Spaniards using everything they could. If the French had been using more of their strength then the Austrians have to divert more attention to the Rhine and Italy, away from Poland. Also, there was an offer from Denmark to give France more than 10,000 mercenaries in Poland, which France declined. If that offer is accepted then we bolster Stanislaus' army directly with thousands of professional soldiers. This can afford him the time and space to organize Poland's forces and win the war against Saxony and Austria.\n\nAssuming that Stanislaus does win, how does an independent, Polish-led, Poland-Lithuania look, particularly one that is aligned with France through Stanislaus' son-in-law, Louis XV?"
