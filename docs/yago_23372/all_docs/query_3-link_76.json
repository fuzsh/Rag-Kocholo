        "text": "The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is preparing to scale up its response in Pakistan, where looming rains pose significant threat to the lives and livelihoods of millions. With many of the communities at risk in Sindh and Balochistan still trying to rebuild after the unprecedented floods of July 2022, significant preparation is required to ensure that the devastation caused by the 2022 floods is avoided.\n\nHeavy monsoon rains in Pakistan could potentially impact the health, economy, and livelihoods of up to 3 million people, according to the National Disaster Management Authority.\n\nThe expected flooding could lead to waterborne diseases, disrupt agricultural activities, and displace families from their homes. In response to these threats, the IRC has mobilized its emergency response teams to provide immediate relief and support. This will include health services, protection, cash assistance, water and sanitation support and the delivery of emergency supplies to help communities address flooding. The response will focus on women and girls, people with disabilities, and minority groups, including Afghan refugees who have been affected by the floods and their host communities.\n\nShabnam Baloch, IRC Pakistan Director, said,\n\n“It is impossible to forget the widespread destruction caused by the flooding of 2022. To this day, families are continuing to struggle to rebuild their homes and make ends meet as their livelihoods were washed away with the rains. Two years on, IRC has seen a significant increase in communities turning to extreme measures of survival, including selling their daughters to marriage and sending their children to work.\n\n\"Our priority is to ensure that affected communities receive timely and adequate support to prevent this humanitarian crisis from deepening. In Pakistan, the IRC has established a robust response framework that includes setting up medical camps, distributing clean water, and providing cash assistance to help families rebuild. As the monsoon season approaches, the IRC continues to innovate and scale solutions based on rigorous research to aid those in crisis-prone areas.\n\n“The monsoon season in Pakistan poses severe risks across multiple fronts. Heavy rains often lead to extensive flooding, displacing thousands and causing widespread damage to homes and critical infrastructure such as roads and bridges. The ensuing stagnant water becomes breeding grounds for waterborne diseases like cholera and dengue fever, placing immense strain on local healthcare systems. Furthermore, agricultural losses due to flooded fields exacerbate food insecurity in a country heavily reliant on farming. These challenges, coupled with the substantial resources required for relief efforts, overwhelm local capacities.\n\n“The IRC remains committed to working alongside local authorities and communities to mitigate the impact of natural disasters and build sustainable resilience in Pakistan - but this is only one part of the solution. The international community must increase its support for humanitarian efforts in Pakistan, recognizing the significant and long lasting impact that a disaster can have on the generations to come.”\n\nThe International Rescue Committee (IRC) began operations in Pakistan in 1980 in response to the growing number of Afghan refugees. We currently have over 1,500 staff and volunteers, and our teams delivered food, shelter, safety, primary healthcare, education, vocational training, water supply systems, sanitation facilities, and other essential services to the Afghan refugees and host communities. Before the floods first started in July last year, the IRC was on the ground with teams deployed to areas that were likely to be the worst hit. In Sindh and Balochistan, IRC teams were prepared to deliver cash assistance, shelter and emergency items to families with no means of escaping the rising waters. IRC is also working with the government in the province of Sindh to strengthen health systems under the ‘Global Nutrition Model’. IRC reached more than 1.4 million clients with emergency assistance"
