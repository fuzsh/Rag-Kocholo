        "text": "A proposal in an earlier thread involved moving the carousel of European matches a bit:\n\nMaria Anna to Victor Amadeus III of Savoy (Carignano line inherits a generation early)\n\nMaximilian marries Maria Teresa of Spain (OTL\n\ndauphine)\n\nFriedrich Christian of Saxony marries Maria Antonia of Spain (as originally proposed)\n\nThe dauphin marries either Maria Josefa of Saxony early, or Maria Antonia of Bavaria.\n\nNow the thing with Max and Maria Anna's marriage, there was never any attempt to annul it (whether on grounds of consanguinity or childlessness) which to me indicates that one of the parties/or both knew that they were barren/sterile. And considering there are no bastard kids attached to Max, my money's on him. True, they may have loved each other -Friedrich Christian and Maria Antonia were a love match - but from what I can gather the marriage was more mutual respect than love per se.\n\nKlemens Franz or his older brother, another Maximilian, would both be considered too small fish for a king's daughter. They were only GRANDSONS while Max III was not only the SON but he was the HEIR APPARENT to a bona fide crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Hence why Klemens only got a Palatine princess which was also due to a scheme dreamed up by the Elector Palatine Karl III to tie all the Wittelsbach branches together by marrying his eldest granddaughter to her cousin (Karl's heir presumptive), his next to the heir presumptive of Bavaria (Klemens) and the youngest to the heir presumptive of the Zweibrucken branch.\n\nAlso, Friedrich II is married to the daughter of the king of England, short of divorcing Mary (which he could theoretically request an annulment on grounds of desertion when she moved to Denmark to look after her nieces and nephew) but that's gonna piss GB off."
