        "text": "Angourie\n\nAngourie Rice Origin: Aboriginal Gender: Female Meaning: Possibly \"tail-feather of a seagull or sea eagle\" Pronunciation: ann-GOW-ree Other Forms: N/A I've finally gotten around to watching Kate Winslet's new show on HBO, Mare of Easttown, and I'm really enjoying it so far. It's gritty, and perfectly captures small-town life. Her daughter, Siobhan, is played by Australian actress Angourie Rice (her sister also has an unusual name -- Kalliope). Of course, being name-obsessed as I am, I immediately dove into researching the name! Angourie herself is named after a town in New South Wales where her grandmother lived. Angourie is said to be from an Aboriginal word meaning \"tail-feather of a seagull or sea eagle\". For many of the indigenous people of Australia, the white-bellied sea eagle is an important figure, seen as guardian of the people and land. The seagull as well is highly regarded, and for some peoples it was common to have a small ceremonial car\n\nYara\n\nYara Shahidi Origin: Persian, Tupi, and Hebrew Gender: Unisex Meaning: \"Sweetheart\", \"Strength\", \"Water Lady\", \"Honeycomb\" or \"Honeysuckle\" Pronunciation: YAH-rah, YARR-uh Other Forms: Yaara, Iara, Uira To me this name is bursting with potential - it's short, feisty, and has a multitude of great meanings. It's already jumped a massive 312 spots from 2017 to 2018 where it currently sits at #672, and I think that's proof it's definitely one to watch out for. Yara, in Persian, can have two different meanings - \"sweetheart\" (or as Yara Shahidi's mother put it: \"someone close to your heart\"), it would seem, for girls, and \"strength\" for boys. In Hebrew (and more often spelled Yaara) it means \"honeycomb\" or \"honeysuckle\" which I think is gorgeous. In Tupi it means \"water lady\" or \"lady of the water\" and is the name of a character from Brazili"
