        "text": "BWV 206 Schleicht, spielende Wellen, und murmelt gelinde!\n\nBirthday (7 October) and Nameday (3 August) of Augustus III,\n\nElector of Saxony and King of Poland.\n\nPoet unknown.\n\nPerhaps 7 October 1736 and 3 August 1740 or 1742, Leipzig.\n\nBG 20, 2; NBA I/36.\n\nA Drama in Music\n\nVistula (B), Elbe (T), Danube (A), Pleisse (S)(1)\n\n1. Chorus (S, A, T, B) The Four Rivers\n\nGlide, glittering waters, and murmur so gently!\n\nNo, rush on now quickly,\n\nThat shoreline and cliffside may frequent resound!\n\nThe pleasure which now these our waters is stirring,\n\nWhich of every ripple a torrent is making,\n\nBreaks through the embankments\n\nWhere it is by wonder and modesty bound.\n\n2. Recit. (B) Vistula\n\nO happy transformation!\n\nMy stream, which lately / always / hath Cocytus(2) copied,\n\nAs it with lifeless corpses\n\nAnd with dismembered bodies slowly glided,\n\nWon't be now to Alpheus(3) second,\n\nWhich over all blest Arcady did pour his moisture.\n\nNow rust's consuming tooth\n\nDoth those abandoned weapons eat\n\nWhich lately heaven's cruel will / Which e'er by quarrel's maddened rage /\n\nUpon my nations'/ people's / necks were sharpened.\n\nWho brings to me, though, this good fortune?\n\nAugust,\n\nHis loyal subjects' joy,\n\nHis land's divine protector(4),\n\nBefore whose scepter I bend lowly,\n\nWhose favor doth alone o'er me keep watch,\n\nHath all this work accomplished.\n\nThus sing whoever doth my water drink:\n\n3. Aria (B) Vistula\n\nClose the Janus-temple's portals(5)\n\nAs our hearts we open wide.\n\nSince to thee our faith we promised,\n\nMoved alone, Lord, by thy kindness\n\nOur repentant hearts / These our filial hearts / and spirits\n\nWith obedience turn to thee.\n\n4. Recit. and Arioso (T) Elbe\n\nWell done, O happy Vistula!\n\nThy thought deserveth praise,\n\nIf thy good faith now but / e�er / with mine own hopes agree,\n\nAnd will my love recall,\n\nNor, as it were, me of my king deprive.\n\nA loan is not a gift:\n\nThou didst our kindliest August from me request,\n\nWhose gracious bearing\n\nReveals a lofty father�s image;\n\nHim have I lent to thee,\n\nTo honor and admire him thou art called,\n\nBut not from my embrace and arms to tear him.\n\nThis oath I give,\n\nO Lord! By thine own Father�s ashes,\n\nBy thine own vict�ry�s glorious triumph:\n\nMuch sooner shall my waters be\n\nE�en with the wealthy Ganges mixing\n\nAnd of their sources lose all knowledge,\n\nAnd sooner Malabar(6)\n\nShall on my banks be fishing.\n\nThan that I for all time\n\nShould, O most dear Augustus, lose thee.(7)\n\n5. Aria (T) Elbe\n\nEvery billow of my waters\n\nCries the golden word �August!�\n\nSee, ye Tritons, merry children,\n\nHow with never known delight\n\nThis my kingdom�s floods are swelling,\n\nAs in the reverberation\n\nOf this name the charming music\n\nHundredfold is made to echo.\n\n6. Recit. (A) Danube\n\nI must as well in thy great pleasure share,\n\nOld father, source of many rivers! Remember\n\nThat I a mighty claim have also to thy glorious hero.\n\nThy savior I see not\n\nWhich thee thy Solomon hath born\n\nWith envious regard,\n\nFor Charles's hand,(8)\n\nAs heaven's rarest blessing,\n\nO'er us the scepter wields.\n\nBut who, indeed, is unaware\n\nThat once the roots of all thy joy,\n\nWhich to thy fairest Trajan(9) here\n\nIs by the grace of noble Josephine\n\nAlone revealed,\n\nUpon my banks first budded?\n\n7. Aria (A) Danube\n\nShoot of Habsburg's tree so lofty,\n\nThy great virtue's radiant beacon\n\nKnow and honor, praise my banks.\n\nThou art sprung from laurel branches,\n\nTherefore must thy marriage bond\n\nBe to fruitful laurels likened.(10)\n\n8. Recit. (S) Pleisse\n\nGive leave,\n\nYe mossy heads of mighty rivers,\n\nIf now a nymph doth join your fray\n\nAnd your discussion trouble.\n\nThis contest is most just;\n\nThe cause is great and worthy that inspires it.\n\nNow indeed desire\n\nMy thought inspires\n\nAnd to my nymphs brings happy pleasure;\n\nThis we upon our champion�s advent have discovered,\n\nWho doth deserve\n\nThat all his loyal subjects heartfelt spirits,\n\nFor hecatombs would be too slight,\n\nHim here as an oblation offer.\n\nBut hear what now my mouth makes bold\n\nTo lay before you:\n\nThou,(11) to whose stream both Inn and Lech give increase,\n\nThou shalt with us this royal pair pay honor,\n\nBut unto us the deed itself relinquish.\n\nYe other two shall both behave as loving brothers\n\nAnd, if ye this your double sun's own ruling radiance\n\nFor any time, each in his turn, be wanting,(12)\n\nMay ye forbear with hope and patience.\n\n9. Aria (S) Pleisse\n\nHark now! The gentle flutes in choir\n\nMake glad the breast and please the ear.\n\nThe undivided union's power\n\nCreates this lovely harmony\n\nAnd even greater works of wonder;\n\nThis mark and with their tune agree.\n\n10. Recit. (B, T, A, S) Vistula, Elbe, Danube, Pleisse\n\n(Vistula)\n\nI must, I will to this assent.\n\n(Elbe)\n\nI'll take the parting bitterly,\n\nBut still my King's command / still thy shores' success / doth govern my decision.\n\n(Danube)\n\nI too am ready, your request,\n\nAs best I'm able, to accomplish.\n\n(Pleisse)\n\nMay unity crown your consent. But lo,\n\nWherefore is it that all along your shorelines\n\nSo many altars now are raised?\n\nWherefore the dancing of the Naiads?\n\nAh! If I'm right,\n\nWe'll see today / I'll see soon how / the long expected light\n\nIn joyful radiance glowing, / Through its bright beams will touch me,/\n\nWhich doth our joy, / From which August, /\n\nMost generous August, / The earth's sweet charm and joy, /\n\nThe world and us now lendeth. / His precious name deriveth. /\n\nAi! Now proceed!\n\nWhile us occasion and the hour\n\nTheir hands extend,\n\nDo join with me now once again:\n\n11. Chorus (S, A, T, B) The Four Rivers\n\nMay heavenly guidance with unending favor\n\nProtect thy life ever, most brilliant August!\n\nAs long as mere drops are in these very moments\n\nWithin these our moss-laden channels discovered,\n\nSurrounded forever be thy lofty spirit\n\nWith pleasure and joy!\n\n1. The four rivers represent regions associated with Augustus III: the Vistula Poland, the Elbe Saxony, the Danube Austria, and the Pleisse Leipzig. The Pleisse is one of three small rivers upon which Leipzig is situated, the other two being the Parthe and the Elster. The little Pleisse will arbitrate the claims of the three great rivers to Augustus.\n\n2. One of the rivers of the Underworld in classical myth.\n\n3. A river of the Peloponnesus\n\n4. Cf. BWV 205a/10 where Athena (Pallas) considers Augustus the patron and 205/12 where she asserts that he is an earth-god.\n\n5. The doors of Rome's temple of Janus were closed only during peacetime (cf. Vergil, Aeneid 1).\n\n6. A region in western India.\n\n7. For a similar adynaton (an unrealizable poetic assertion), cf. BWV 205/13.\n\n8. Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI (1685-1740).\n\n9. Marcus Ulpius Traianus (A.D. 98-117), his father Nerva (96-98), Hadrian (117-138), Antoninus Pius (138-161), and Marcus Aurelius (161-180) reigned as the so-called \"Good Emperors\" of Rome.\n\n10. In August 1719 Augustus had married Maria Josepha, daughter of the Holy Roman (Hapsburg) Emperor Joseph I (1678-1711).\n\n11. The Danube.\n\n12. A reference to the divided cares of Augustus as King of Poland and Elector of Saxony.\n\n� Copyright Z. Philip Ambrose"
