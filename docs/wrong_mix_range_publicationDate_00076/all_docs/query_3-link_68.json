The sentence draws a parallel between the vergers of St Peter’s (referring to the church in the story) and the Popes of Rome, who are known for their lifelong tenure. By comparing the two, the sentence elevates the importance and permanence of the verger position. It suggests that being a verger at St Peter’s is a prestigious role, akin to the prestigious and esteemed position of the Pope. The phrase “were there for life” implies that the vergers of St Peter’s committed themselves to the position for their entire lives.\n\nThis highlights the dedication and loyalty expected from the vergers, emphasizing their unwavering service and attachment to the church. It further suggests that this commitment is highly valued and esteemed within the church’s traditions. The sentence also indicates a sense of permanence and stability within the institution of the church. Just as the Popes of Rome are known for their lifelong leadership, the verger position is portrayed as a stable, long-term role. This notion aligns with the traditional and unchanging nature often associated with religious institutions, where positions and roles are seen as enduring and resistant to change.\n\n4. How did the manager react upon his discovery that Mr Foreman could neither read nor write?\n\nAns: In “The Verger” by W. Somerset Maugham, the story revolves around Albert Foreman, a dedicated verger (caretaker of a church) who is dismissed from his job because he cannot read or write. The manager’s reaction to this discovery is not explicitly described in the story, but we can speculate based on the circumstances.\n\nConsidering the time period and societal norms when the story was written (1930s), it is likely that the manager would have been shocked or surprised upon learning that Mr. Foreman lacked basic literacy skills. In those days, literacy was considered an essential requirement for most jobs, and the inability to read or write would have been seen as a significant limitation. The manager might have felt a mixture of disappointment, disbelief, and even frustration because Mr. Foreman had been a dedicated employee who had served the church faithfully for many years.\n\n5. Briefly describe the career of Albert Edward.\n\nAns: In “The Verger” by W. Somerset Maugham, Albert Edward, commonly known as Albert Foreman, is the central character whose career is depicted in the story. Albert is the Verger of St Peter’s Church in Neville Square, London. Albert’s career as being verger spans over sixteen years. During which he faithfully serves the church. He takes pride in his work and is diligent in his duties, maintaining the church premises, overseeing weddings, funerals, and other religious ceremonies. Albert’s commitment and attention to detail earn him a good reputation among the parishioners. However, his career takes an unexpected turn when he discovers that his lack of literacy, the inability to read or write, is deemed unacceptable by the church authorities. The manager dismisses him from his position as the verger due to this perceived deficiency, despite Albert’s long and dedicated service. After being dismissed, Albert refuses to let his lack of education hinder him. He capitalizes on his knowledge of the tobacco business and opens a successful tobacconist’s shop, demonstrating his resourcefulness and ability to adapt to new opportunities outside the church. In summary, Albert Edward, or Albert Foreman, has a devoted career as the verger of St Peter’s Church before his dismissal due to his illiteracy. The story highlights his resilience and entrepreneurial spirit as he transitions into a new chapter of his life.\n\nE. Answer these questions in detail.\n\n1. Describe, in detail, how Albert Edward lost the job of the verger at St Peter’s.\n\nAns: Albert Edward Foreman served St. Peter’s church as a verger for sixteen years. He accomplished the duties of the office to the satisfaction of everybody concerned. Everything was going on smoothly until the new vicar came.\n\nThe new vicar was an educated man. When he came to know that the verger was an illiterate man he was shocked. So, one afternoon the vicar asked the verger to come to the vestry. In the vestry, the verger wondered with slight uneasiness what could be the matter as he found the two churchwardens already sitting there with the vicar. The troubled look of the two churchwardens led the verger to think that the vicar had been nagging them and might have jockeyed them into doing something against their will while he was wondering about the situation, the vicar told the verger that he had something unpleasant to say to him. The vicar admitted that the verger had accomplished the duties of the office to the satisfaction of everybody concerned. But he was astonished to find the verger to be an illiterate person. In that case, the verger could not be allowed to continue his job in a prestigious church like St. Peter’s. Hence, as the vicar said, the verger must learn to read and write within three months or leave his office. But the verger refused to take the offer and preferred to resign believing that it was too late now to learn.\n\n2. Would you consider that the new vicar’s chance discovery of Foreman’s illiteracy was a blessing in disguise for the verger? Write a persuasive answer.\n\nAns: Yes, the new vicar’s chance discovery of Foreman’s illiteracy can be considered a blessing in disguise for the verger.\n\nHere are some persuasive arguments to support this viewpoint:\n\n(a) Opportunity for Personal Growth: Foreman’s illiteracy, which led to his dismissal as the verger, initially seems like a setback. However, it becomes a catalyst for personal growth. His forced departure from the church compels him to explore new avenues and challenges him to overcome his limitations. This opportunity allows him to tap into his entrepreneurial spirit and open a successful tobacconist’s shop. Through this new venture, Foreman not only achieves financial success but also gains a sense of independence and fulfilment that he might not have experienced while working as a verger.\n\n(b) Liberation from Conventional Constraints: Foreman’s illiteracy, which was deemed unacceptable by the church authorities, actually liberates him from the constraints of traditional employment. The dismissal opens doors to a world beyond the church, where his skills, resourcefulness, and work ethic can flourish in new ways. As a tobacconist, Foreman can utilize his knowledge and expertise in a field that suits his strengths. This newfound freedom allows him to control his own destiny, pursue his own ambitions, and build a prosperous life on his terms.\n\n(c) Unleashing Hidden Potential: Foreman’s illiteracy, while initially perceived as a limitation, ultimately unveils his hidden potential. Had he remained as the verger, he might have continued in his comfortable yet limited role without exploring his untapped talents and aspirations. The unexpected turn of events pushes him out of his comfort zone, compelling him to discover and utilize his entrepreneurial abilities. This newfound path allows Foreman to thrive and showcases his resilience, adaptability, and ability to overcome challenges.\n\n(d) Happiness and Fulfilment: The shift from being a verger to becoming a successful tobacconist brings Foreman a sense of happiness and fulfilment that might have eluded him otherwise. By pursuing a career that aligns with his passions and skills, Foreman experiences a deeper satisfaction in his work and personal life. The journey he embarks on, propelled by the discovery of his illiteracy, and leads him to a life of contentment and accomplishment that he might not have found within the confines of the church.\n\nIn conclusion, the new vicar’s chance discovery of Foreman’s illiteracy, although initially viewed as a setback, ultimately becomes a blessing in disguise. It opens doors to new opportunities, frees Foreman from traditional constraints, uncovers his hidden potential, and allows him to find happiness and fulfilment in a new career path. Foreman’s journey exemplifies the power of embracing unexpected changes and turning them into catalysts for personal growth and success.\n\nADDITIONAL QUESTION & ANSWERS\n\nA.
