        "text": "Tuesday 23 July\n\nFugitive: The Mystery of the Crypto Queen\n\nChannel 4, 10pm\n\nThis three-part documentary tells the story of Bulgarian-German entrepreneur Ruja Ignatova, who currently features on the FBI’s “10 Most Wanted Fugitives” list for orchestrating a global $4.5 bn cryptocurrency scam. Ignatova persuaded scores of investors (or “idiots” as she charmingly called them) in the UK, US and Uganda to pour their life savings into her company, OneCoin.\n\nBut it was allegedly a Ponzi scheme intended to fund her lavish lifestyle and brazen marketing; at her peak, in 2016, Ignatova promoted OneCoin on stage at Wembley Stadium and hosted glamorous parties for millionaire investors in Dubai and New York City. Then, in October 2017, she boarded a flight to Greece and simply vanished with her clients’ money. You may be familiar with her shocking story already, thanks to BBC podcast The Missing Cryptoqueen, but Fugitive – directed by award-winning film-maker Rudolph Herzog, working closely with writer and journalist Raid Sabbah – brings us fully up to date. There are contributions from intelligence experts, defrauded investors and her former employees. VL\n\nMidsomer Murders\n\nITV1, 8pm\n\nThe cosy sleuthing drama trundles on, as DCI Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) and DS Winter (Nick Hendrix) are tasked with investigating a murder connected to an organic bakery owned by a pair of unpopular out-of-towners (Robert Gilbert and Rebecca Night).\n\nRoy Clarke Remembers Keeping Up Appearances\n\nBBC Four, 8pm\n\nThe writer behind Last of the Summer Wine and Open All Hours reminisces on another of his creations. Clarke reveals how the casting of Patricia Routledge as social-climbing snob Hyacinth Bucket was crucial – and why the series ended in 1995. He introduces the terrific first episode at 8.15pm.\n\nThe Body Detectives\n\nChannel 4, 9pm\n\nA new documentary series following the fascinating work of Locate International, an organisation that revisits cold cases among the almost 1,000 unidentified bodies in the UK. The first case that ex-copper Dave Grimstead and his team dig into is that of George Johnston, who vanished off the Norfolk coast in 1984 while on holiday.\n\nLondon ’48: How Britain Saved The Olympics\n\nChannel 5, 9pm\n\nPostwar London – all bombsites and rationing – was a world away from the triumphant shininess of the 2012 Olympic Games. Using extensive archive and a range of talking heads, this film describes how the capital stepped up to host the 1948 event despite the devastation the Second World War had caused.\n\nElsbeth\n\nSky Witness, 9pm\n\nFans of legal dramedy The Good Wife, rejoice: this spin-off is based on that series’ attorney Elsbeth Tascioni (Carrie Preston), who has moved from Chicago to New York. She soon clashes with police captain CW Wagner (The Wire’s Wendell Pierce) when she starts sleuthing in a case involving a university professor’s relationship with a student who is believed to have killed herself.\n\nWomen on Death Row\n\nChannel 4, 11.05pm\n\nThis gripping new series tells the stories of six of the 52 female murderers on Death Row in the US (by comparison, there are 2,400 men currently awaiting the death penalty). First is Shawna Forde, the leader of a vigilante nativist group sentenced for the murders of a father and daughter during a home invasion in 2009.\n\nMission: Impossible 2 (2000) ★★★★\n\nSky Showcase, 9.30pm\n\nTom Cruise reprises his role as IMF agent Ethan Hawke in this follow-up to the hit Nineties film Mission Impossible; there are now seven films, with the eighth set for release next year. In a plot borrowed from Alfred Hitchcock’s Notorious, we follow Hawke as he tries to prevent villain Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from stealing a deadly virus by seducing Ambrose’s ex, played by Thandie Newton. Directed by John Woo.\n\nBefore I Go to Sleep (2014) ★★★\n\nBBC Two, 11.05pm\n\nBased on SJ Watson’s 2011 novel of the same name, Rowan Joffé’s psychological thriller stars Nicole Kidman as a traumatised woman suffering from amnesia. Every morning, she meets her husband (Colin Firth) for the first time; her doctor (Mark Strong) tells her to keep a video diary to try to retain some memories. But all it does is document her deteriorating mental state. As in Big Little Lies and The Others, Kidman thrives in a dark, troubling role.\n\nSick of Myself (2023) ★★\n\nFilm4, 11.25pm\n\nKristoffer Borgli’s black comedy combines the body-horror shocks of David Cronenberg with the Scandinavian romantic angst seen in The Worst Person in the World. Signe (Kristine Kujath Thorp) and Thomas (Eirik Sæther) are caught in a relationship that grows more toxic – they fake allergic reactions, get addicted to drugs – as time goes by.\n\nWednesday 24 July\n\nHell Jumper\n\nBBC Two, 9pm\n\nChris Parry left Cornwall in early 2022, hoping to join Ukrainians in repelling the Russian invasion. Less than two years later he was dead at 28, killed not as an active combatant but as a “hell jumper”; volunteers who crowdfund vehicles and equipment to evacuate civilians. Paddy Wivell’s extraordinary documentary makes clear the life-threatening peril during an uninterrupted 10-minute sequence, filmed on Parry’s bodycam during an increasingly desperate solo mission. We’re told he was responsible for evacuating more than 400 people – their reactions when he finds them leave no doubt of the fate that they would otherwise have faced.\n\nYet such tunnel-visioned heroism entailed enormous sacrifice, not just for Parry but also for his family (his sister was forced to keep his activities secret from their parents), friends (equally oblivious) and Ukrainian partner Olya (their courtship forms the emotional heartbeat of the film). Exhausted from her own aid efforts, she was trying to live a relatively normal life in Kyiv; he begged her to join him on the frontline. In a war of relatively clear ethical lines, Hell Jumper illustrates a small facet of its complexity through one short, courageous life. GT\n\nTime Bandits\n\nApple TV+\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Terry Gilliam’s 1981 fantasia Time Bandits was given the TV treatment, and Apple has both provided the budget and the cast for Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi to bring it to glorious life. As with the film, a nerdy young history buff (Kal-El Tuck) is willingly abducted by a chaotic band of thieves, this time of average height. Their stolen map takes them on assorted adventures through the past while garnering the unwanted attention of warring deities (Clement and Waititi). Friends star Lisa Kudrow leads a game cast over 10 episodes of smartly crafted family entertainment.\n\nDirty Pop: The Boy Band Scam\n\nNetflix\n\nFrom Backstreet Boys to NSYNC, Lou Pearlman was responsible for some of pop’s biggest acts in the 1990s, all the while honing a Ponzi scheme which eventually saw him imprisoned. This documentary tells the whole sorry story.\n\nThe Great British Sewing Bee\n\nBBC One, 9pm\n\nThree talented finalists take on three final, fittingly testing challenges: design beautiful opera gloves, turn cheap party paraphernalia into an impressive party outfit and create a full outfit by draping on their models.\n\nTurbulence: How Safe Is Your Flight?\n\nITV1, 9pm; Wales, 10.45pm\n\nBack in May, severe turbulence killed one and injured 104 others onboard a Singapore Airlines flight. What happened, to what extent was climate change responsible, and can we expect more flights to be rocked by similar tough conditions?\n\nArt Matters\n\nSky Arts, 9pm\n\nThe redoubtable Melvyn Bragg continues to bang the drum for the arts as funding hangs by a thread. Lenny Henry, Tracey Emin, Armando Iannucci and Sheku Kanneh-Mason are among the big names he talks to for this rousing call to arms, exploring why the arts are important and how they can be supported with public money at a premium.\n\nMr Bigstuff\n\nSky Max, 9pm\n\nDanny Dyer continues to play perfectly to type (laddish, swearing-obsessed – you get the gist) in this fun sibling sitcom. Tonight’s third episode sees Dyer’s Lee kick up a fuss at a DIY shop after someone else buys their last bag of washers; later, he tries his hardest to give just an ounce of his hardman ways to shy brother Glen (Ryan Sampson). PP\n\nJaws 2 (1978) ★★★\n\nITV4, 9pm\n\nJeannot Szwarc’s follow-up cannot compete with Steven Spielberg’s timelessly tense original, nor the two-tone terror of John Williams’s signature motif. But it’s a strong sequel in a franchise of diminishing returns. Roy Scheider returns as Martin Brody with another toothy problem on his hands. Murray Hamilton is also back as the unsackable mayor of Amity Island. Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water…\n\nThe Enforcer (1976) ★★★★\n\n5Action, 10pm\n\nPolice officer “Dirty Harry” Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is downgraded from homicide specialist to everyday bobby after using excessive force. But when a terrorist group hellbent on destroying San Francisco kidnaps the city’s mayor (John Crawford), Harry and his new partner (Tyne Daley) must intervene. The Enforcer was the last film in the series to feature John Mitchum as Inspector Frank DiGiorgio.\n\nMarry Me (2022) ★★★\n\nBBC One, 10.40pm\n\nOkay, so it was never going to win the Oscar for Best Picture, but Kat Coiro’s silly romantic comedy is a fun watch. Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson have sizzling chemistry in the leads; Lopez is a megastar singer (talk about life imitating art) who decides one night to pluck a random person out from the crowd of her concert… and marry them. Wilson is the crumpled maths teacher who gets swept up in the publicity stunt.\n\nThursday 25 July\n\nLinford\n\nBBC One, 8.30pm\n\nWhichever way you look at it, Linford Christie is one of British athletics’ great figures. Not only a gold-winning Olympian and world champion, but the only athlete ever to hold the British, Commonwealth, Olympic and world championship titles for the 100m at the same time. And yet, as is evident from this gripping film, he is one of British athletics’ most unhappy figures, too.\n\nHere, we learn that he has spent many years feeling traduced, overlooked and underappreciated, largely as a result of the long shadow cast by doping allegations he was, in part, cleared of more than 20 years ago (he has always insisted he was innocent). Christie cuts a prickly, somewhat tragic figure, a man undone by the very character traits that made him a champion: a singularity of focus, ego and drive that brooks no compromise, and an unwillingness to “play the game” in the face of shocking racism and the truly gross excesses of the tabloid press when he was at his career peak. For many, perhaps, he has long been his own worst enemy. That’s this documentary’s virtue; it gets under the skin to provide a vivid, nuanced portrait of who Christie really is, and why he is the way he is, too. GO\n\nCirque du Soleil: Without a Net\n\nAmazon Prime Video\n\nDuring the pandemic, the globe-spanning, record-breaking circus troupe were forced to shut down their flagship Las Vegas show, O. This sparkly docu-series goes behind the scenes as Cirque du Soleil’s performers and crew get back to it.\n\nThe Decameron\n\nNetflix\n\nInspired by Boccaccio’s 14th-century tales, this eight-part romp finds a cast of wealthy egomaniacs and misfits retreating to a villa outside Florence in 1348 to enjoy fun and frivolity while escaping the Black Death. Topical? Hardly. “It’s like Love Island but back in the day,” is how showrunner Kathleen Jordan describes it. Girls’ Zosia Mamet and Derry Girls’ Saoirse-Monica Jackson take the lead.\n\nThe High Street: Shops We Loved & Lost\n\nChannel 5, 8pm\n\nA nostalgic two-parter recalling the glory days of Britain’s high streets and the much-missed chains and retailers that gave them life: Woolworths, BHS, C&A, Debenhams… the list goes on. Eamonn Holmes, Anne Hegerty, Lesley Joseph and Nick Hewer are among those mourning the loss.\n\nTabloids on Trial\n\nITV1, 9pm\n\nPrince Harry gives his first interview since the conclusion of his damages claim against the publishers of the Daily Mail and The Sun in December. Actor Hugh Grant, singer Charlotte Church and former footballer Paul Gascoigne are among those also speaking out about the impact phone hacking had on their lives, both personal and professional.\n\nRichard Eyre Remembers Country\n\nBBC Four, 9pm\n\nIn tribute to dramatist Trevor Griffiths, who died in March, Richard Eyre recalls directing his subversive TV drama Country in the Play for Today slot in 1981. A rare airing follows, with Leo McKern, James Fox and Wendy Hiller as members of the landed Carlion family gathered to protect their interests ahead of a feared Labour victory in the 1945 general election.\n\nDoom Scroll: Andrew Tate and the Dark Side of the Internet\n\nSky Documentaries, 9pm\n\nDirector Liz Mermin explores how and why someone with Andrew Tate’s toxic views can seduce millions of young followers, and how social-media algorithms boosting extreme content can spill over into real-world harm.\n\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare (2024) ★★★\n\nAmazon Prime Video\n\nGuy Ritchie swaps tough nut Cockney gangsters for heroic (and equal parts chaotic) politicians in this rollicking Second World War action comedy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill enlists a ragtag group of military officials (played by Henry Cavill, Alex Pettyfer, Henry Golding et al) to hatch a daring plan to neutralise Hitler’s fleet of German U-boats so Britain can win the war.\n\nThe Trouble with Angels (1966) ★★★\n\nTalking Pictures TV, 5.35pm\n\nActress Ida Lupino is most famous for her hard-boiled film roles opposite Humphrey Bogart, but she also blazed a trail for female film-makers, directing a succession of movies in the early 1950s. This is one of her later efforts, a likeable comedy set in a Catholic girls’ school, with rebellious Hayley Mills taking on Rosalind Russell’s Mother Superior.\n\nRocky IV (1985) ★★★\n\nITV4, 10pm\n\nIt’s a stew of blood and sweat as the Cold War “rivals” Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone, who also directs) and Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) lay it all on the line. Rocky IV is the series’ nadir, and the fight scenes run on, but it gave us one worthwhile moment: the robot butler given by Rocky to his long-term friend Paulie (Burt Young), behind which there’s a sweet tale – it was used by Stallone to help his autistic son communicate.\n\nFriday 26 July\n\nOlympics: Paris 2024: Opening Ceremony\n\nBBC One, 5.45pm\n\nAfter the Covid-enforced strangeness of the Tokyo Games in 2021, the Olympics will announce their return with all appropriate pomp and grandeur at tonight’s Opening Ceremony in Paris. Created by the maverick theatre director Thomas Jolly (his acclaimed productions include Shakespeare’s The Wars of the Roses tetralogy at 2014’s Avignon Festival), the procession will largely take place along the Seine. There will be some 200 boats carrying the athletes six kilometres along the river to the Jardins du Trocadéro, opposite the Eiffel Tower. Let us hope, given recent news stories concerning water quality, that no one accidentally falls in.\n\nEn route, expect some spectacular, unorthodox takes on French history, introducing the athletes hoping to make a little of their own over the next 16 days. Thirty-two sports, 329 events and over 10,000 competitors will equal pure sporting heaven for those not already sated by the recent excitements of Wimbledon, Euro 2024 and the Tour de France – and the Paralympics are still to come. Clare Balding introduces the event, with Andrew Cotter and Hazel Irvine providing commentary. GT\n\nCarmen Curlers\n\nWalter Presents\n\nWith the first series having offered a delightful 1960s-set antidote to the clichés of Nordic noir and smashed viewing records in Denmark, this second run finds Axel Byvang’s (Morten Hee Andersen) electric hair-curler manufacturer ramping up production to meet demand. A defect prompts suspicions of sabotage, while unrest grows among the predominantly female workforce demanding better conditions.\n\nGardeners’ World\n\nBBC Two, 8pm\n\nMonty Don prepares to leave his garden for the summer, cutting plants back and sowing salad seeds, while Carol Klein has some suggestions for bulbs and tubers and Adam Frost is impressed by an Italian-inspired garden in Devon.\n\nVerdi’s Requiem at the Proms\n\nBBC Four, 8pm\n\nFrom Tuesday night comes a performance by the BBC National Chorus of Wales, Crouch End Festival Chorus and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales under the baton of Ryan Bancroft. Verdi’s moving masterpiece is introduced by Katie Derham from the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nChampions: Full Gallop\n\nITV1, 9pm\n\nThis engrossing documentary series continues, with Sean Bowen having assumed his position of frontrunner in the race to be champion jockey. But with Harry Cobden chasing hard, who will win out?\n\nTerror at 30,000 Feet\n\nChannel 5, 9pm\n\nFollowing last week’s opener, another real-life disaster movie with an unlikely happy ending details Qantas Flight 32, which suffered engine failure over Indonesia while flying from London to Sydney, yet landed without injury to anyone in the air or on the ground. Its passengers relate this striking story.\n\nLouis Armstrong Night\n\nBBC Four, from 10pm\n\nAn evening devoted to one of the all-time great voices and trumpeters begins with a concert from his British tour with his All Stars group in 1968, featuring several of his staples including Mack the Knife and What a Wonderful World. At 10.55pm comes another gig from the same tour, showcasing (among others) Hello Dolly! and The Bare Necessities, before “Satchmo” takes his bow alongside fellow luminaries including Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie in performance and interview for Jazz Legends in Their Own Words at midnight.\n\nRobin and the Hoods (2024) ★★★\n\nSky Cinema Premiere, 4.15pm\n\nThe classic tale of Nottinghamshire outlaw Robin Hood has been rehashed many times: by Disney, Kevin Costner, and even Shrek. This latest iteration is a sweet-natured family fantasy following the efforts of 11-year-old Robin (Darcey Ewart) and her friends to save their beloved playground from being paved over by a greedy property developer (Naomie Harris).\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada (2006) ★★★★\n\nFilm4, 4.40pm\n\nIn this enjoyably catty look at the wild world of fashion journalism, Meryl Streep plays the perfectionist editor of Runway (a thinly veiled Vogue). Emily Blunt delivers a magnificent turn as her uptight assistant, while Stanley Tucci’s loveable creative director cemented his star power; it’s a shame that Anne Hathaway is sappy in the lead. Fans will be delighted to learn a sequel is currently in the works.\n\nMoonraker (1979) ★★★\n\nITV1, 10.45pm\n\nThe 11th film in the Bond franchise, and the fourth to star Roger Moore as the dapper MI6 agent, involves the theft of a space shuttle. It’s one of the weaker 007 films and at times seems more of a comedy than a tense action adventure, but it’s enjoyably frivolous. Michael Lonsdale plays baddie Hugo Drax, who pinches the aforementioned space shuttle to help along his plan to wipe out the world’s population. Also on Sunday at 3.40pm.\n\nThe Beach (2000) ★★★\n\nBBC One, 11.30pm\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio plays second fiddle to Thailand’s Maya Bay beach (which was closed to tourists for years after the film’s release due to environmental concerns) in Danny Boyle’s populist thriller. Based on Alex Garland’s 1996 novel, the story follows backpackers Richard (DiCaprio), Étienne (Guillaume Canet) and Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen) as they explore paradise – but they soon realise it’s less than perfect.\n\nTelevision previewers\n\nStephen Kelly (SK), Veronica Lee (VL), Gerard O’Donovan (GO), Poppie Platt (PP) and Gabriel Tate (GT)"
