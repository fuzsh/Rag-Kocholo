        "text": "Muslim women in India can now seek maintenance under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) that applies to all married women regardless of their religion. The Supreme Court held that this right of a Muslim woman is in addition to the right under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986.\n\nThe bench comprising Justices BV Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih, who delivered separate but concurring judgments, dismissed a petition filed by a Muslim man’s plea against the direction to pay interim maintenance to his divorced wife under Section 125 of CrPC.\n\nWhat was the Case?\n\nPetitioner Mohd Adbul Samad challenged a 2017 family court order directing him to pay maintenance of Rs 10,000 per month to his former wife.\n\nThe Telangana High Court order refused to set aside the family court order and directing him to pay Rs 10,000 as interim maintenance to his former wife. The petitioner’s counsel argued that the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, precludes a divorced Muslim woman from claiming benefits under Section 125 of CrPC. However, the Supreme Court bench rejected this contention, upholding the Muslim woman’s right to seek maintenance under the general law.\n\nSection 125 CrPC places an obligation on “any person having sufficient means” to maintain “his wife” or “his legitimate or illegitimate minor child” if they are unable to maintain themselves. The section clarifies that the word “wife” also includes a divorced woman who has not re-married.\n\nAccording to Justice Nagarathna, Section 125 CrPC is “embedded in the text, structure and philosophy of the Constitution” as a social justice measure. “The remedy of maintenance is a critical source of succour for the destitute, the deserted and the deprived sections of women… It is an instantiation of the constitutional philosophy of social justice that seeks to liberate the Indian wife including a divorced woman from the shackles of gender-based discrimination, disadvantage and deprivation,” Justice Nagarathna wrote.\n\nThe ruling means that maintenance exists under Section 125 CrPC “in addition” to the provisions for maintenance under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 (MWPRD Act), not “against” it.\n\nWhat is the Conclusion of the Judgment?\n\na) Section 125 of the CrPC applies to all married women including Muslims.\n\nb) Section 125 of the CrPC applies to all non-Muslim divorced women.\n\nc) As far as divorced Muslim women are concerned —\n\ni) Section 125 of the CrPC applies to all such Muslim women, married and divorced under the Special Marriage Act in addition to remedies available under the Special Marriage Act.\n\nii) If Muslim women are married and divorced under Muslim law then Section 125 of the CrPC as well as the provisions of the 1986 Act are applicable. Option lies with the Muslim divorced women to seek remedy under either of the two laws or both laws. This is because the 1986 Act is not in derogation of Section 125 of the CrPC but in addition to the said provision.\n\niii) If Section 125 of the CrPC is also resorted to by a divorced Muslim woman, as per the definition under the 1986 Act, then any order passed under the provisions of 1986 Act shall be taken into consideration under Section 127(3)(b) of the CrPC. [This means that if any maintenance has been given to Muslim wife under the personal law, then it shall be taken into account by the Magistrate to alter the maintenance order under Section 127(3)(b)]\n\ne) In case of an illegal divorce as per the provisions of the 2019 Act then,\n\ni) relief under Section 5 of the said Act could be availed for seeking subsistence allowance or, at the option of such a Muslim woman, remedy under Section 125 of the CrPC could also be availed.\n\nii) If during the pendency of a petition filed under Section 125 of the CrPC, a Muslim woman is ‘divorced’ then she can take recourse under Section 125 of the CrPC or file a petition under the 2019 Act.\n\niii) The provisions of the 2019 Act provide remedy in addition to and not in derogation of Section 125 of the CrPC.\n\nMuslim Women Divorced Via Triple Talaq\n\nJustice Nagarathna clarified in her judgment that Muslim women, who are divorced through the illegal method of triple talaq, are also entitled to claim maintenance under Section 125 CrPC.\n\nTriple talaq has been declared as void by the Supreme Court and criminalised by the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019.\n\nWhat Happened in Shah Bano Case?\n\nA woman named Shah Bano Begum case filed a petition seeking a maintenance from her husband under Section 125 for herself and her five children in 1978. Mohammed Ahmad Khan, divorcing Shah Bano via triple talaq later that same year, argued that he is only required to provide maintenance during the iddat period following divorce – three months under ordinary circumstances during which she cannot marry another man – according to the Muslim personal law.\n\nThe Madhya Pradesh High Court granted her plea in 1980, after which the matter reached the Supreme Court. The All Indian Muslim Personal Law Board argued that the court was bound to apply Muslim personal law as per The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the High Court’s decision. It also held that the divorced woman was entitled to maintenance under Section 125 even after the iddat period “if she is unable to maintain herself”.\n\nThe Rajiv Gandhi-led government then enacted the MWPRD Act, which effectively overturned the Shah Bano verdict. Under the Act, the obligation to pay maintenance after the iddat period was placed on the relatives or children of the divorced wife and, in their absence, on the State Wakf Board."
