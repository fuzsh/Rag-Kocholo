        "text": "Railway and city have coexisted for more then 150 years. The realization of railroads in the 19th century can be seen as an important contribution to the development of the city. But during the making of railroads there was too little consideration for the overall picture of the city. The result is that today the railway is entangled with the city while its role has drastically changed. Currently the railway, although indispensable, is often considered as an obstacle, a limitation for city planning. This leads to the following research questions. What is the relationship between the construction of the city and the realization of the railway? Which transformations does the city have to deal with and what does the railway and its buildings have to do with it? And finally, what is the role of architecture in the realization of railway infrastructures in the city? The search for answers to those questions is the core of this research. The area of interest is the Netherlands with particular attention to the Randstad, where the railway is an important part of the traffic network. An important conclusion is that architecture should play a more substantial role in the future transformations of railroads in the (Randstad) city.\n\nDuring the post-war period the railway infrastructures in Europe were subjected to extreme transformations, regarding not only the reconstruction of the railway lines and all the structures related that were destroyed during the Second World War but also the start and restart of many projects that were delayed by the war. Among these, the construction of diametric underground urban lines as well as new central stations took a special role in the urban development of the second half of the twentieth century, triggering the long-lasting planing and construction of large urban areas which became almost completely devoted to tertiary activities due to the mechanisms of the economical development during the Welfare state era. Taking as examples cities as Brussels (Belgium) with the Jonction Nord-Midi, Madrid (Spain) with the three Túneles de la risa and Lyon (France) with the business district of La Part-Dieu and its railway station, we aim to show the different urban phenomena that come with construction of the new railway infrastructures in attractive urban areas in the post-war period. Thus, we will consider the changes in urban landscape, considering how these infrastructural developments were important to determine a newer image for these cities and to (re)shape most of the public spaces, structures and buildings related with them. We will also identify the role of the different actors involved with these projects, not only architects and engineers but also the authorities, the real estate developers, social movements and others, that deeply influenced the shape of both the cities and the transportation infrastructures. Finally, we will make an evaluation of the importance of these structures and buildings related for today's cities.\n\nTransit oriented development has become in the recent years a topic of high interest both for researchers and for practitioners. The French-German project Bahn.Ville 2 has the objective of testing the principles of an urbanism orientated towards rail by implementation on two regional railway lines (St. Etienne – Firminy, Lyon metropolitan region as well as Taunusbahn, Frankfurt/Rhein-Main region). This paper is presenting selected results on - innovations in regional planning instruments in France (Schéma de Cohérence Territorial) and Germany (Regionaler Flächennutzungsplan) and their respective for a better integration of land-use and transport, - specific observations on neighborhood mobility in the station surrounding and propositions for high quality walking environments as well as - the potential of an observation tool designed to support public intervention on land-use and transport around stations. The results constitute three original contributions of the Bahn.Ville 2 projec..."
