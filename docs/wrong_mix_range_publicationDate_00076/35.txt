‘The Begum’s Fortune’ follows the plans of two scientists, the French physicist, Sarrasin, and German, Schultz. Each has a share in inheriting a vast fortune and sets about spending it on the project of their dreams. A humanitarian, Sarrasin builds the city, Frankville, dedicated to upholding the health of its citizens. Schultz, however, constructs Steeltown, which is devoted to the creation of weapons of war. Astonishingly prescient, ‘The Begum’s Fortune’ predicts a number of technological advances, including incendiary bombs, satellites, and even mobile phones. A taut and thought-provoking read for those with an interest in dystopian futures.
