        "text": "For the first time surveys and collection of insects in Jangamhatti area, Chandgad, Kolhapur district of Maharashtra was carried out in year 2014 to 2015. During the study period, 44 species of insects belonging to 9 orders. The order Lepidoptera was dominant with 18 species followed by Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Orthroptera, Hymenoptera, Odonata, Diptera, Mantodea and Blattodea with 9,6,4,2,2,1,1, and 1 species respectively Data revealed that, the fauna of Insects of study region is rich may be because of variety of plants, varied ecological conditions rainfall, and temperature.\n\nInsecta the most diverse class in animal kingdom and found in every ecosystem of the planet earth. They also share us in our home and some are pest too. Some insects are accidentally come and some share our home permanently. The objective of the present study is to find common insects found in our home. Keeping this view in mind insects were studied in different homes during day and night in diverse localities of the karjat city for the period of one year. About nineteen insects were identified. Of this six belongs to order coleoptera (Dominate Order), two to each diptera and shiphanoptera and one each to order isoptera, thysanura, dictyoptera dermaptera, hemipetra, psocoptera, lepidoptera, hymenoptera and orthoptera are identified. Some household insects are pest too so their damage and control measures are also discussed. Preference is given to simple and natural mode of control.\n\nThe present study aimed at providing an up-to-date and systematic checklist of Insect pests of vegetable crops of the State of J&K (India). The study was based on the survey and documentation of the literature published, from time to time, pertaining to Insect Pests of vegetable crops in this region. The checklist presented in this paper recorded 102 insect pest species associated with 39 species of cultivated and wild type of host vegetable crops in the state of J&K (India). These insect pest species belonged to 34 insect families under 9 insect orders and 76 Insect genera. The order and family wise species richness of these pests were encapsulated. It was observed that out of the total insect pests recorded on the checklist, 24 species each belonged to orders Coleoptera & Lepidoptera, 15 species belonged to order Hemiptera,13 species belonged to order Homoptera,11 species each belonged to orders Diptera & Thysanoptera, 2 species belonged to order Orthoptera, and 1 species each bel...\n\nA survey was conducted to study the diversity of insect species between 2013-14to 2015-16 in Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat. Geographically, Jorhat is located at116 Meters (381 ft) above MSL and 26.75°N latitude and 94.22°E longitude. Insect specimens were collected from different ecosystems of Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat. The result of the diversity study revealed that Coleopteran (64 species) dominated the other insect fauna followed by Lepidoptera (38species), Diptera (25 species) Hymenoptera (22 species), Odonata (19 species) and Hemiptera (11 species). All total 179 insect species were collected and the species were identified with the help of existing literature. On the whole, the experimental site showed a high diversity of insect species. The presence of different insect species is the indication that the studied site has a good potential resource for better cultivation. The knowledge compiled here will provide useful information for future studies aiming to...\n\nInsects fabricate the biological foundation for all terrestrial ecosystems. The current chunk of work is based on an investigation conducted in paddy fields and agricultural lands of a city of Dhemaji district, Assam which is named as Silapathar. The root behind our survey was to explore the entomological enrichment of Silapathar. During the investigation, insect samples were collected on a daily basis for a prolonged period of one month. The collection was done twice a day both during the morning and evening for 2hrs. Later collected insects were identified based on their physiological characteristics. The life cycle stages of some insects were also studied. The insect varieties which were identified in Silapathar included 8 species belonging to kingdom Animalia, phylum Arthropoda, class Insecta ; 3 species from order Orthoptera, 1 from order Hymenoptera, 4 from order Hemiptera. Among the identified insects in Silapathar were Tettigonia viridissima (Great green bush cricket), Lesser marsh grasshopper, Velarifictorus micado (Japanese burrowing cricket), Nezara viridula (Southern green stink bug), Vespa mandarinia (Asian giant harnet), Rhyparochromus vulgaris (seed bug), Leptocorisa oratorius (Rice ear bug), Oncocephalus (Assassin bug). Data let out that Silapathar is highly enriched with different types of insects and there is more to explore about this place.\n\nThis current research aimed to determine the insect diversity at various land-use types in Rajamangala University of Technology Isan, Roi Et Campus at Tung Kula Rong Hai. Three main land-use types i.e. rice paddy fields, vegetables and pastures as representatives of this study. Insects were caught using sweeping net at 20 times/sampling plot in July 2018. All samples were identified based on external morphology. The result of this study found that 39 insect species, 25 families obtained were representative of 9 orders. Rice paddy fields had the highest diversity (31 species) followed by pastures (24 species) and vegetables (15 species) respectively. The number of insect species and individual significantly differed among land-use types (p&lt;0.01). Herein, Shannon-wiener Index (H’) for all insect of all land-use types was considered relatively high (2.15). Additionally, the insect pests, Nilaparvata lugens, Edwardsiama hergmanni and Hydrellia philippin were dominant species. Whereas...\n\nAltogether 322 species of insects were collected from the Sanctuary during the two-month survey, of which 301 species could be identified. These included 202 species of butterflies and moths, 49 species of beetles, 25 species of bugs and 12 species of bees and wasps. The butterflies included 73 species of which five were of protected status and three endemic to Western Ghats. The moth fauna was also very rich comprising mostly of arboreal feeding forms indicating a fairly undisturbed forest patch in the area. Among beetles, scavenger beetles showed richness. The passalid beetles found in rotting wood and scarabaeid beetles feeding in dung were the most important groups of scavenger beetles. The herbivorous beetles associated with various plants mostly belonged to the family Chrysomalidae. The bugs collected, include several species of agricultural importance. Among Hymenoptera, six wasp and three bee species could be recorded. In addition to these, six species of dragonflies, 21 uni...\n\nThe subfamily Aiceoninae contains only one genus Aiceona of which 8 species are recorded from India on about 10 species of plants belonging to 5 families. The subfamily Anoeciinae contains only two genera Anoecia Koch, 1857 that contains 29 species/subspecies and a monotypic genus Krikoanoecia Zhang and Qiao, 1996 out of which only 6 species are recorded from India infesting 6 species of plants belonging to mainly Poaceae followed by Solanaceae and Cornaceae. The subfamily Chaitophorinae is a large assemblage of aphids containing 12 genera assigned under two tribes: Chaitophorini and Siphini. Chaitophorini is represented in India by 25 species infesting over 25 plant species belonging to 11 plant families, mostly of Sapindaceae and Salicaceae. The Siphini is represented in India by only 2 species infesting over 10 plant species belonging to chiefly of Poaceae. The subfamily Drepanosiphinae contains 5 genera in which 38 species are assigned (Remaudière and Remaudière, 1997; Zhang et al., 1999; Heie & Wegierek, 2009; Quednau, 2010; Wieczorek et al., 2015, 2016; Favret, 2016) out of which only 2 genera, Drepanosiphum Koch, 1855 and and Yamatocallis Matsumura, 1917, having 2 species each are recorded from India. These species can be recognized from others by having winged morphs in parthenogenetic generation exclusively and have long antennae with a very long processus terminalis and ciliated rhinaria, forelegs with enlarged femora, long cylindrical siphunculi and knobbed cauda."
