        "text": "Dhemaji district is an administrative district in the state of Assam in India. The district headquarters are situated at Dhemaji and commercial headquarters is located in Silapathar. The district occupies an area of 3237 km and has a population of 686,133 (as of 2011). Main Religions are Hindus 548,780, Muslims 10,533, and Christians 6,390.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe district's name Dhemaji is derived from the Deori-Chutia word Dema-ji which means great water indicating it to be a flood-prone region.\n\nHistory\n\nThe areas of the present Dhemaji district was part of the greater Chutiya kingdom along with Lakhimpur, Sonitpur, Tinsukia, Jorhat, Dibrugarh district from the 12th century to the 16th century until the Ahom-Chutiya war through the early period of the 16th century. Ruins of the former capital are still there but not well preserved. Monuments built during the Chutia rule of Assam comprise Garakhia Than, Bordoloni Than and Basudev temple. A number of monuments Ghuguha Dol, Ma Manipuri Than, Padumani Than built by the Ahom kings of Assam are worth visiting.\n\nDhemaji of Assam became a complete district on 14 October 1989 when it was split from Lakhimpur district.\n\nGeography\n\nDhemaji district inhabits an area of 3,237 square kilometres moderately equal to Solomon Islands' Makira Island. It is one of the most far-flung districts of India, at the easternmost part of Assam . Located in the foothills of the lower Himalayas of Assam it is rather a small town.\n\nBeing in a convergence of rivers with the mighty Brahmaputra river flanking the district and its numerous tributaries running through the district, the region is constantly affected by floods.\n\nThe heart of Dhemaji district of Assam is Dhemaji Mouza (an area established by the British rule for the purpose of tax collection, equal to a taluk or pargana in the pan-Indian setting). Secondly, Silapathar & Sissi Borgaon of Assam is the chief business place of Dhemaji. The Bogibil project of Assam is running nearest to these places."
