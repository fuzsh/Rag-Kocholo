        "text": "Pradhan P. 2015. Potential distribution of Monotropa uniflora as a surrogate for range of Monotropoideae (Ericaceae) in South Asia. Biodiversitas 16: 109-115. Monotropoideae is a mycoheterotrophic subfamily of Ericaceae. Its members are highly specific to a particular fungal family, which has attributed to the rarity and limited distribution of Monotropoideae. In the past two decades, there are considerable developments in understanding their biology and biogeography, among which, the distribution of Monotropa uniflora L. and M. hypopitys L. has been extensively studied. In this contribution, Ecological Niche Modeling of M. uniflora has been conducted to test its earlier proposed distribution in South Asia, to test the spatial scale of the said proposal, to test its potential distribution as a surrogate for range of Monotropoideae in South Asia and to prioritize conservation areas for M. uniflora in the region. The model was built with five occurrence details of the rare plant M. uniflora in Western and Eastern Himalaya, in relation to 19 bioclimatic explanatory variables, performed in MaxEnt. The results show the good performance of the model with the training AUC of 0.994. 1,50,316 square Km. of suitable areas have been predicted for the growth of M. uniflora (IHS ≥0.5) in South Asia, many areas of which is in line with earlier distributional reports. The bioclimatic variables are able to predict and suitably justify the spatial distribution of M. uniflora. The predicted range of the species could be established for potential distribution of other Asian Monotropoids like Monotropastrum and Cheilotheca.\n\nHeliyon Volume 9, Issue 2, February 2023, e13417 Research article Species distribution modelling of Monotheca buxifolia (Falc.)

Monotheca buxifolia is an economically and ecologically important tree species inhabiting Pakistan and Afghanistan in dense patches, and species range is contracting rapidly. This study hypothesize that predicted climate change might remarkably influence the existing distribution pattern of M. buxifolia in the study area. A total of 75 occurrence locations were identified comprising M. buxifolia as a dominant tree species. The Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm was utilized to perform the SDM under current (the 1970s–2000s) and two future climate change scenarios (shared socioeconomic pathways: SSPs 245 and 585) of two time periods (the 2050s and 2070s). The optimal model settings were assessed, and simulation precision was assessed by examining the partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pAUC-ROC). The results showed that out of 39 considered bio-climatic, topographic, edaphic, and remote sensing variables which were utilized in the preliminary model, 6 variables including precipitation of warmest quarter, topographic diversity, global human modification of terrestrial land, normalized difference vegetation index, isothermality, and elevation (in order) were the most influential drivers, and utilized in all reduced SDMs. A high predictive performance (pAUC-ROC; >0.9) of all the considered SDMs was recorded. A total of about 67,684 km2 of geographical area was predicted as suitable habitat (p > 0.8) for M. buxifolia, and Pakistan is the leading country (with about 54,975 km2 of suitable land area) under the current climate scenario. Overall, the existing distribution of the tree species in the study area might face considerable loss (i.e. rate of change %; −27 to −107) in future, and simultaneously a northward (high elevation) niche shift is predicted for all the considered future climate change scenarios. Hence, development and implementation of a coordinated conservation program is required on priority basis to save the tree species in its native geographic range.\n\nThe populations of Crepidium acuminatum, Ephedra gerardiana, Lilium polyphyllum, Pittosporum eriocarpum and Skimmia anquetilia have been shrinking in their natural habitats due to habitat destruction, over harvesting for medicinal purposes and increased human interference such as conversion of forest areas in agricultural land, and urbanization. In order to improve the conservation status of species, potential areas and habitats for reintroduction, were predicted using Maximum Entropy (Maxent) distribution modelling algorithm. The model was developed using 112 species occurrence data and Worldclim bioclimatic variables. Jackknife test was used to evaluate the importance of the environmental variables for predictive modelling. Based on our studies, the most suitable habitat for these endangered species is predicted in Western Himalayas. Precipitation of the driest quarter has played an important role in the potential habitat distribution of L. polyphyllum, P. eriocarpum and S. anquet...\n\nPredictive models of species geographic distributions are important for a variety of applications in ecology and conservation. Ecological niche modeling of the two families Colchicaceae and Melanthiaceae was carried out using software DIVA-GIS 7.5 version, which was based on the presence data from herbarium records of BM, E, KATH, TUCH and TI and bioclimatic variables from WORLDCLIM. This work predicts the current potential geographic distribution of two families Colchicaceae and Melanthiaceae in Nepal. The current potential distribution indicated that members of Colchicaceae show somewhat dispersed distribution in all ecological regions whereas the members of Melanthiaceae are distributed in the Western and Eastern regions of Nepal."
