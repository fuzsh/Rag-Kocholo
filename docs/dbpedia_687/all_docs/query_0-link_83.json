        "text": "Insects fabricate the biological foundation for all terrestrial ecosystems. The current chunk of work is based on an investigation conducted in paddy fields and agricultural lands of a city of Dhemaji district, Assam which is named as Silapathar. The root behind our survey was to explore the entomological enrichment of Silapathar. During the investigation, insect samples were collected on a daily basis for a prolonged period of one month. The collection was done twice a day both during the morning and evening for 2hrs. Later collected insects were identified based on their physiological characteristics. The life cycle stages of some insects were also studied. The insect varieties which were identified in Silapathar included 8 species belonging to kingdom Animalia, phylum Arthropoda, class Insecta ; 3 species from order Orthoptera, 1 from order Hymenoptera, 4 from order Hemiptera. Among the identified insects in Silapathar were Tettigonia viridissima (Great green bush cricket), Lesser marsh grasshopper, Velarifictorus micado (Japanese burrowing cricket), Nezara viridula (Southern green stink bug), Vespa mandarinia (Asian giant harnet), Rhyparochromus vulgaris (seed bug), Leptocorisa oratorius (Rice ear bug), Oncocephalus (Assassin bug). Data let out that Silapathar is highly enriched with different types of insects and there is more to explore about this place.\n\nInsect biodiversity is a type of biodiversity that solely focus on insect percentage because they are the most species-diverse group on Earth and play an important role in ecosystems. More than a million different species of insects have been identified, making them the most diverse and numerous animal class. Insects, in their many forms, are crucial to a flourishing agricultural sector because they promote ecosystem health in many ways, including herbivory, decomposition, being prey, being predators, and serving as pollinators. The Insect class also includes the vast majority of the most problematic pests in agricultural settings. Finding out what kinds of insects live in a certain location requires conducting a survey of insect biodiversity. Insects can favorably influence ecosystems via prey-predator interaction, soil enrichment, and bio-indicative behaviors thus, maintaining biodiversity on agricultural land is crucial from both conservational and commercial viewpoints. Therefore, more morphological, phylogenetic, ecological, and biogeographical research is required to better categorize this group.\n\nA preliminary study was conducted on the abundance and diversity of insects species in agriculture fields of Hadgil Harutti village, Gulbarga, Karnataka. The present study was aimed to determine the species richness, dominance and evenness of insect fauna from agriculture fields. The study was carried out during the month from June 2013 to September 2013. A total of 11,318 insects from 6 orders, 26 families and 54 species were recorded. This study shows that Hymenoptera (78.86%) was the most dominant order according to total number of individuals, followed by Coleoptera (15.45%), Lepidoptera (3.22%), Hemiptera (1.47%), Orthoptera (0.95%) and Diptera (0.05%). The Simpson's Reciprocal Index diversity is highest in order Coleoptera (8.048) and lowest in order Diptera (1.000). The species richness, evenness and diversity of insects were calculated by Margalef's Index, Pielou's Index and Shannon-Wiener Index respectively.\n\nThis current research aimed to determine the insect diversity at various land-use types in Rajamangala University of Technology Isan, Roi Et Campus at Tung Kula Rong Hai. Three main land-use types i.e. rice paddy fields, vegetables and pastures as representatives of this study. Insects were caught using sweeping net at 20 times/sampling plot in July 2018. All samples were identified based on external morphology. The result of this study found that 39 insect species, 25 families obtained were representative of 9 orders. Rice paddy fields had the highest diversity (31 species) followed by pastures (24 species) and vegetables (15 species) respectively. The number of insect species and individual significantly differed among land-use types (p&lt;0.01). Herein, Shannon-wiener Index (H’) for all insect of all land-use types was considered relatively high (2.15). Additionally, the insect pests, Nilaparvata lugens, Edwardsiama hergmanni and Hydrellia philippin were dominant species. Whereas...\n\nThis study aims to assess the diversity and insect populations in agricultural ecosystems. Sequens of this study consisted of determining the location of the sample, the sample unit, and agricultural ecosystems. This research was conducted using survey methods, identification and analysis data.The result study showed that abundance, / insect populations and diversity obtained from agricultural ecosystem is a total of 39 individuals consisting of 6 orders and 6 families, with the amount of each individual as follows : Hemiptera 7, 12 Diptera, Hymenoptera 5, 4 Coleoptera, Lepidoptera 6, .and Orthoptera 5 The density populations the highest of the agricultural ecosystem that is on the order Diptera Family Lauxalidae. Keywords: insect diversity, AGIRCULTURAL, ECOSYSTEM, KAUDITAN, North Sulawesi\n\nAn assessment study was conducted on the abundance and diversity of insect species in Parvati Aranga Bird Sanctuary District Gonda, Uttar Pradesh. The present study was aimed to determine the species richness, dominance and evenness of insect fauna from study area. The assessment was carried out during the month of November 2020 to April 2021. A total number of 296 insects from 156 species, 31 families and 5 Order were recorded. This assessment shows that Coleoptera (33.97%) was most dominant order and followed by Lepidoptera (25.64%), Orthoptera (14.74%), Diptera (14.74%) and Hymenoptera (10.26%) according to total number of species. A number of statistical indices were used to determine the Dominance, Richness, Evenness and Diversity. The study supposed to the first report of insect diversity in study is and becomes useful information on those aspects to be documented for future references.\n\nThe abundance and diversity of Coleoptera (Insecta: Animalia) at Agri-biodiversity park of Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University, Hyderabad, Telangana, India was studied from September 2019 to January 2020. Using five different collection methods (pitfall trap, yellow pan trap, manual collection, light trap and yellow sticky trap), 5,580 individuals under 21 families of Coleoptera were recorded. The most abundant family was Staphylinidae with 31.27% species followed by Scarabaeidae (21.72%). Among the collection methods employed, the light trap method yielded the maximum number of individuals (3,558) besides as many as 18 representative families. The Shannon-Weiner diversity Index, Margalef’s species richness index and Pielou’s evenness index for coleopteran fauna of the study area were 2.231, 2.318 and 0.732, respectively. The present study indicates a great diversity of beetles in the area and provides preliminary data for future works.\n\nAquatic insects holds an important place in the ecology of freshwater ecosystem. The present study deals with the aquatic insects survey conducted from January 2018-March 2018 in three permanent water bodies of kaliabor, Nagaon district, Assam. During the study all total 28 species of aquatic insects have been recorded belonging to six order and 18 family. Different group of insects have different tolerance to the quality of the water in which it lives. Due to the diversity of insects, each different group relies on a different set of conditions in order to survive. According to this study order Hemiptera represents the highest number of species (Nine families including 15 genera). Coleoptera (three families including four genera.), Odonata (two families including four genera) Diptera(two families including two genera) Ephemeroptera (one family including two genera), Hymenoptera(one family including one genera) were recorded during this work. Water quality parameters in the three sites don't show significant differences. Dissolved oxygen is found to be highest in Solong beel and also the total number of insects species present are high at this site followed by Kolong river and Jaysagar doloni."
