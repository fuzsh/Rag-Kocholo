        "text": "KEY INDUSTRIAL SECTORS\n\nAssam is the single largest tea producing region globally and contributes to over 50 per cent (6,31,220 MT Jan – Dec 2015) of India’s total tea production (1.2 MMT Jan – Dec 2015). The state houses over 765 tea gardens across Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Sibsagar, Jorhat, Golaghat, Nagaon and Sonitpur. The Guwahati Tea Auction Centre (GTAC) is among the largest CTC tea auction centres of the world. The government has secured a Geographical Indication (GI) for the tea produced in the state. As a result ‘Assam Tea’ is known as ‘Assam Orthodox Tea’.\n\nCoal mined from Assam has high sulphur content and is mainly utilised by local railways, hydro power stations and steamers. Coal occurs mainly in the upper Assam districts of Tinsukia and Dibrugarh in the Makum and Dilli – Jeypore coalfields. Small coal deposits occur sporadically in the central Assam districts of Karbi Anglong and North Cachar Hills. The proven reserve of coal in this belt is about 340 million tonnes.\n\nGood quality cement-grade limestone is found in central Assam districts of North Cachar Hills and Karbi Anglong, where a total reserve of about 670 million tonnes is available. The China clay of Karbi- Anglong district is a vital input for the ceramic industries.\n\nThe state is the third-largest producer of petroleum and natural gas in the country. Major refineries in the State are located at Digboi, Guwahati, Bongaigaon and Numaligarh with a total refining capacity of 7.00 MMTPA. The Upper Assam & Assam-Arakan Basin in Northeast India is an important oil-producing region and contains more than 18% of the country’s hydrocarbon resource. Assam has over 1.6 billion tonnes of crude oil and 158.57 billion cubic meter of natural gas reserves.\n\nAssam enjoys global monopoly in terms of Muga or golden silk production. The state accounts for around 95% of global Muga production. Moreover, Assam is the country’s major Eri silk producer (accounts for 65% of the country’s Eri silk production). Raw silk production in the state during 2015-16 was recorded to be 3,325 MT whereas during 2016-17 (up to May 2016), raw silk production in the state stood at 1,137 MT. Seneh Jori, an Assam Silk Outreach Mission, aims to produce 1 million kg of Muga silk and 10 million kg of Eri Silk by 2025.\n\nAssam has a huge untapped potential for agro and food processing industries. The total production of horticulture crops in 2014-15 stood at 7,568.1 thousand metric tonnes (MT). In 2015-16, the total production of rice was recorded to be 5,123 thousand MT. Similarly, the production of pulses and oilseeds reached 195 thousand MT and 13 thousand MT during 2015-16, respectively. Pineapple, banana, cauliflower, broccoli, rose and bougainvillea are among high yielding varieties of horticulture crops in Assam, besides traditional fruits like Carambola, Leteku, Paniyal Thekera, Au tenga etc.\n\nAssam houses 300 types of medicinal herbs and plants, with the Brahmaputra valley alone having 150 varieties of herbs and plants of commercial value. An estimated 5-10% of the plants and herbs have been commercially exploited, offering a vast potential for further investments.\n\nSince the NER has the highest concentration of bamboo, which accounts for around 60.0% of the total bamboo of the country, Assam has ample scope for bamboo-based industries such as paper manufacturing. The objective of the Government of Assam is to promote bamboo as a substitute for wood and make it the timber of the 21st century. Assam has rich forests covering nearly a third of its land area. The forests in the state act as a reserve for commercially useful products such as timber, bamboo, stone and cane.\n\nAssam received 24,720 foreign tourists in 2015, ranking 24th among India’s states. In order to boost the state’s tourism and hospitality sector, the state government has brought out a draft Tourism Policy 2016. Assam offers six diverse tourist circuits, besides several opportunities in niche tourism activities, such as wildlife and ecotourism, spiritual tourism, adventure tourism, wellness and medical tourism, festival and cultural tourism, etc.\n\nBarpeta Metals, mustard oil Bongaigaon Textiles, dairy, aluminium, oil and natural gas Dibrugarh Fertilizer, petroleum and natural gas Jorhat Tea, cement, pharmaceuticals, aluminium and food products Karimganj Cement North Cachar Hills Cement Sibsagar Tea, oil and natural gas Tinsukia Tea, coal, oil and natural gas Kamrup Metropolitan Cement, tea and textiles\n\nCULTURE & RECREATION\n\nThe state is amongst the most socio-culturally diverse regions in India, which has cultivated several traditional fine and performing art forms.
