        "text": "About Dhemaji District (Assam)\n\nDhemaji district is a district of the Assam state with its administrative headquarters located at Dhemaji town. There are numerous mythological and hypothetical believes among its locals regarding the origin of the name \"Dhemaji\". And one of the most prominent believe is that-once there was a river which used to change its course very often and as a result unanticipated flood cover its different parts of the area. Thus, the river was believed to be a kind of evil spirit in this region. The term ‘Dhemaji’ is derived from two Assamese words such as \"dhal\" means flood and \"dhemali\" means \"play\". Both the terms together means “a place where flood occurs frequently”.
