Is he simply pretending to be Spanish and if so, why?\n\nSue, London\n\nHe is called The Spaniard because he is... Spanish, ref. He talks of his Spanish thoroughbred horses during the movie. Of course, he doesn't LOOK Spanish, but Joaquin Phoenix and Oliver Reed didn't look Roman, or speak Latin, and thumbs ups in the Colliseum are an apocryphal story ... Oh, really, I can't be bothered. It's just a movie. Sheeesh.\n\nRob Lines, Streatham UK\n\nThe questioner obviously paid even less attention to this ridiculous film than I did. However, I did register enough to know that Maximus was from Spain, part of the Roman Empire at that time (I think he was of Roman blood but born there).\n\nGuy Dowman, Tokyo Japan\n\nThey call him The Spaniard because as far as they are aware, he was captured by slave traders in Spain (after his family is killed). They only find out his true identity later on, cunning fellow that he is...\n\nDave Boyle, London\n\nMaximus is Spanish and also a Roman citizen. Before the death of the Emperor (Richard Harris), Maximus asks why he should be given such responsibility when he has never even seen Rome. This would have been common. After fifty to a hundred years in Britain, for example, the majority of soldiers etc. would have been local people, unlikely to ever visit the continent let alone the hub of the Empire. In the fifth century, the Romans did not leave Britain en masse. Administration was withdrawn plus the legions, but I can imagine a large amount of the legionnaries staying put because they would have known of little else but Britain. Incidentally, the Emperor Severus, who died in York, was African.\n\nClarry McDonald, Streatham UK\n\nAdd your answer"
