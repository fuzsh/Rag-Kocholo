I’m not sure if the story made any sense, but it was so stylishly made that I could cut it some slack. Joaquin Rafael (born in Puerto Rico) Phoenix is a little younger than me … he’s a little guy but a talented actor (Best Actor award at Cannes for this? I had no idea). I guess this movie was previously titled “A Beautiful Day,” don’t know why they changed the name? The sound design is really good too.\n\nTony Lane is right to say “some strains of this fearsome film, to be honest, feel overworked and arch,“ but it’s still good enough to get a coveted green-go rating."
