        "text": "On October 28th, 1974 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Joaquin Raphael Phoenix was born. He was the third child born to independent hippie ~ missionaries, of The Children of God cult, Arlyn and John Bottom.\n\nJoaquin says he wouldn't change anything about his up-bringing. He barely remembers his time with the Children of God, the flower-power version of Christianity that, in the 1980s, was up-ended in a pedophile scandal. Joaquin says\n\n\"They were looking for a spiritual community. They were searching for an alternative way of raising their children. They didn't want to raise us in the Bronx. My mom was raised in the Bronx, she was scared every day coming home from school. But my parents have never been blind followers.\"\n\nWhen they decided to leave, they found doing so was no easy matter. They were living in Venezuela at the time, so the whole family stowed away on a container ship carrying Tonka Toys bound for Florida.\n\n\"I feel there was something really amazing about my parents and what they did,\" Joaquin says.\n\nAll of Joaquin's siblings had \"earthy\" names, River, Liberty, Rain and Summer, a decision that matched their vision of life. John was the archbishop to Venezuala and to the Carribean Islands and Joaquin's mother was a migrant fruit picker.\n\nJoaquin's parents were hippies in the truest sense and Joaquin decided that he too should have an \"earthy\" name like his brother River and sister Rainbow. So when Joaquin was 4, he and his dad were out raking leaves and he got the notion to change his name to Leaf.\n\nHis last name would change as his parents sought work for their talented kids, they sang on street corners and in talent shows to make money. In 1979, a friend mailed an article that featured the kids to actress Penny Marshall, and they got a letter from Paramount inviting them to drop in if they were ever in Los Angeles. So, they traveled to L.A. in an ancient station wagon with no rear window. Soon after their arrival, the kids found work almost immediatley and the family began to prosper.\n\nAs this move represented a new life for the struggling family, they decided to change their last name to Phoenix.\n\nBy the time Joaquin was 6 they had more or less settled in the Los Angeles area. Heart(Arlyn) found work as a secretary at NBC, and John turned his talents to landscaping. They eventually found an agent who was willing to represent all five children, and the younger generation dove into TV work. Commercials for meat, milk, and junk food were off-limits (the kids were all raised as strict vegans), but they managed to find plenty of work pushing other, less \"sinister\" products.\n\nHis older brother River landed a role in the CBS series Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Leaf also landed a guest shot on the short-lived show. He followed that up with a guest spot on Murder, She Wrote and roles in TV movies.\n\nIn the late '80s, the Phoenix clan decided to pull up stakes and relocate again, this time back to Florida. River's film career had enough momentum to sustain the move, but Joaquin wasn't sure what lay in store for him in the Sunshine State.\n\n1986 marked Leaf's big screen debut when he appeared in SpaceCamp which also starred Kate Capshaw and Lea Thompson. He followed that in 1987 with a starring role in Russkies which earned him good reviews.\n\nIn 1989, when he was just 15, Universal Pictures had just opened a new studio in the area and he was cast almost immediately as a teenager addicted to porn in Parenthood with Steve Martain. His performance was very well-received, but Joaquin decided to withdraw from acting for a while, he was frustrated that there weren't very many interesting roles for actors his age, and he wanted to see more of the world.\n\n\"My Leaf phase was 8-15, so I was a child actor and there weren't many options in terms of films. Then I took some time off before embarking on the Joaquin phase.\"\n\nJoaquin took off for five years. His parnets split up and he just stopped acting altogether. He began to travel mainly with his father.\n\n\"Through Mexico and Central America. I really liked the people there; they were spontaneous, friendly and unpretentious.\"\n\nThe travel bug that bit him, as a teenager hasn't really left, he says wistfully.\n\n\"It could happen again.\"\n\nJoaquin recalls that time as one of happiest in his life.\n\n\"I simply knew that I didn't want to make films any more at that time. The scripts that I was reading for ages 15 through 18, were just ridiculous. There's not a nice way to say it; the titles of them, which would just conjure up laughter. The year after Parenthood, I couldn't find anything that was of interest to me, so if you keep on saying 'No' for a year, the offers stop and there's no work at all. That was fine with me.\"\n\nIn 1993 he headed back to the States, Joaquin made up for lost time by hanging out with his brother and sisters. Family is very important to the Phoenixs.\n\n\"...When I was 18, I just became interested in the work again. I guess I'd just grown as an individual and a human, and felt that there were things I wanted to express.\"\n\nHe went back on the audition trail,\n\n\"for the sake of getting my chops back and getting back in the groove of auditioning; auditioning is a whole different style of acting. So I'd go in and read for stuff like Lassie Comes Home - dog and whale movies. For a while, it seemed like the Leaf period was coming back to haunt him. \"I thought: God, this is going nowhere.\"\n\nJoaquin's next brush with fame had nothing to do with acting at all. On the night of October 30, 1993, Joaquin, his brother River, sister Rain and River's girlfriend, actress Samantha Mathis decided to spend a night out on the town. They headed out to the Sunset Strip, and they ended up at the Viper Room, owned by actor Johnny Depp. When River began to cunvulse due to a drug overdose, they took him outside. Rain held on to her brother River to help comfort and relax him while Joaquin went for a phone. This is when he made the famous 911 call that was repeated countless times on every TV and radio station everywhere.\n\n\"I'm thinking he's taken Valium, or something,\" said Joaquin to the 911 dispatcher.\n\nBut the phone call was not enough. Joaquin lost his only brother on that sad Halloween morning. River was pronounced dead at 1:51am at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Beverly Hills."
