Phoenix had small acting parts since the mid 80s, but only first received attention with Gus Van Sant's To Die For in 1995 after a hiatus from films for four years. Incidentally, having directed his brother in both My Own Private Idaho and Drugstore Cowboy, Van Sant was one of the reasons for River's reputation. Joaquin followed up with a turn in Oliver Stone's U-Turnbefore his career really took off from the turn of the millenium with an Oscar-nominated performance in Gladiator. The year 2004 was a busy one for Phoenix who has a nack for chosing roles that are varied and challenging.\n\nAWARDS\n\nCHARACTER QUOTES"
