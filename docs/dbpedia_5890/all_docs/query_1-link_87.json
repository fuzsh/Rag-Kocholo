He subsequently earned Best Actor nominations for portraying musician Johnny Cash in Walk the Line (2005), an alcoholic war veteran in The Master (2012), which won him the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, and the title character in Joker (2019), which earned him critical praise and numerous accolades including the Academy Award for Best Actor.
