        "text": "Joaquin 5 years ago (2004)\n\nThere is a marked transformation in JP. What happened? Has anyone else been following what some are calling a train wreck? I became concerned when I saw his appearance on Lettermman last week:\n\nLet me play psychologist for a minute. I believe that deep down, Joaquin harbors a lot of hate. Having watched this clip and subsequently read his bio, my suspicion is that he suffers from serious identity and love-related issues reaching back to childhood when he was raised in Puerto Rico by a missionary couple. He despises the media and thinks all art critics are pretentious. As an active vegan and spokesperson for PETA, he loves to feel like he is superior to the common man. He is finding his \"own way\" through life, adhering only to his own fleeting desires. His current condition seems logical taking into account his unique childhood, having been the one to call 911 when his brother, River, collapsed in an LA nightclub from a drug overdose (and later died), checking himself into rehab for alcoholism 2005, no-showing his latest movie premier, and his bizarre early-retirement. That's my prognosis anyway. Then again, his Uni-Bomber-look and budding career Hip-hop might all be a meta-drama as part of an auto-documentary he secretly plans to release in 2010.\n\nNow that I've said my piece, here is the dirty others have scooped up. Hollywood says the \"New Joaquin\", is a bloated, disheveled, shadow-self of who he once was.\n\nFilmography\n\nHere are some notable films that he has starred in over the past few years:\n\nWe Own the Night (2007) .... Robert 'Bobby' Green\n\nWalk the Line (2005) .... John R. Cash\n\nLadder 49 (2004) .... Jack Morrison\n\nHotel Rwanda (2004) .... Jack Daglish\n\nThe Village (2004) .... Lucius Hunt\n\nBrother Bear (2003) (voice) .... Kenai\n\nSigns (2002) .... Merrill Hess\n\nGladiator (2000) .... Commodus\n\nWhat unnaturally forces spawned this transformation:\n\nTrivia\n\nHere is some trivia that you might find interesting from IMDB:\n\nWas born Joaquin Rafael, but at the age of four he decided that he wanted a more earthy name, like his elder siblings River and Rain, so while he was raking leaves with his father he decided on Leaf. In the early '90s he took back his birth name.\n\nJoaquin's mother is of Hungarian-Russian decent and his father is of Spanish-Irish decent.\n\nHis parents are now divorced.\n\nBrother of River Phoenix, Summer Phoenix, Rain Phoenix and Liberty Phoenix\n\nHis first name is pronounced \"WAA-keen\"\n\nHe is a strict, philosophical vegan. He refuses to wear any costumes made out of animal skin. For the movie Gladiator (2000), Quills (2000) and Walk the Line (2005), among others, he requested that his \"leather\" costumes be made from synthetic materials.\n\nOnce refused to wear shoes during a photo shoot for Prada because they were made out of leather.\n\nIs a spokesperson for PETA.\n\nResides in New York City in the same apartment building as best friend Casey Affleck and sister Summer Phoenix and director Gus Van Sant.\n\nHe dated Liv Tyler for 3 years. (On relationship with Liv Tyler) \"I'm a great believer in people coming into your life, and you into theirs, for a reason. And i know that when Liv and I met, it was for a reason - I really needed her and she really needed me. And at a certain point, I think we stopped evolving with each other, stopped progressing, and made a very mature decision to move on, even though there was still a great love there. There's no one gossipy thing that I can share. I'm thankful that we had the time we had.\"\n\nTook his mother to the premiere of Gladiator. (2000)\n\nTook his mother to the Academy Awards. [2001]\n\nUncle of sister's (Liberty Phoenix) children Rio Everest, Indigo Orion and another boy, and Summer Phoenix's son Indiana August.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the scar on his lip is not the result of a repaired cleft lip or palate. It is simply a birth mark. Phoenix has stated in interviews that, while pregnant with him, his mother felt a sharp pain one day, and he was born with a mark on his lip.\n\nShares a birthday with actress Julia Roberts.\n\nSpoke Spanish as a small child but forgot most of it as he got older.\n\nReportedly never reads his own press or reviews.\n\nChecked himself into rehab to be treated for alcoholism in early April 2005.\n\nDid his own vocals on the Walk the Line (2005) soundtrack.Phoenix was in car accident January 26, 2006 on a winding canyon road that flipped his car over. Shaken and confused, Phoenix heard a tapping on his window and a voice say, \"Just relax\". Unable to see the man, Phoenix replied, \"I'm fine. I am relaxed\". Then managed to see that the man was famed, eccentric German auteur Werner Herzog, and Herzog replied, 'No, you're not'. After helping Phoenix out of the wreckage, Herzog phoned in an ambulance and vanished.\n\nHe and his brother have both appeared in film series that involved Harrison Ford. River Phoenix played the young Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), and Ford's son in The Mosquito Coast (1986). Joaquin is among those being considered to play John Clarke in the Jack Ryan spin-off Without Remorse (2011), a character that Willem Dafoe played opposite Ford in Clear and Present Danger (1994).\n\nHe and River Phoenix are the first brothers to be nominated for acting Academy Awards.\n\nRides a Ducati motorcycle and a yellow '72 Le Mans.\n\nHe made $5,000,000 for his performance in The Village.\n\nInvited to join AMPAS (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) in 2006.\n\nHe owns two cats.\n\nHis close friends with Matt Damon and Vince Vaughn and was friends with Heath Ledger.\n\nKate Winslet calls him the best actor of his generation.\n\nAnnounced his retirement from acting and said that Two Lovers (2008) would be his last movie as an actor. [October 2008]\n\nContact Information\n\nJoaquin Phoenix - c/o United Talent Agency - 9560 Wilshire Blvd. - Suite 500 - Beverly Hills, C.A., 90212 (His agent: Iris Burton)\n\nHome Address: PHOENIX, JOAQUIN (LEAF) 1450 Belfast Dr., LA, CA 90069\n\nWhat do you think about Joaquin? Is he going through a slump? Is this a phase? Is he finally relaxing into his true identity? Is this craziness actually calculated self-marketing for his new film? Or has he truly gone off the deep end?\n\np.s. I'm going with tormented genius.\n\nLabels\n\nThe \"Rummikub\" Pronunciation Debate Affirmative Constructive: \"Cub\" For years, I have been a firm advocate and defender of the pronunciation, Rummi-\"CUB\". The game box I grew up with spelled it, Rummicub on the box. However, other productions of the game have variant spellings: Rummykub , Rummy Kube , Rummy Tiles , etc. Based solely on box spelling, the game's true pronunciation is open to interpretation. Therefore, Rummi\"cub\" is equally acceptable to any other given pronunciation. Negative Constructive : \"Cube\" My opponents argue that since the game originated over seas, we ought to respect and maintain its original pronunciation. Affirmative Rebuttal: Americanization of the Term When the game was brought to America and given Americanized rules, its name was also Americanized. Pronunciation loyalists then counter my rebuttal with, \"there are lots of adopted foreign words that have retained their original pron\n\nI want to be an under shepherd for Christ, but I fear my light is not super bright. Is my dim light enough? Dim Lightbulb by Aditya Vyas When I love people, I desire to be open with them. That includes the deep joy I find in my relationship with Jesus Christ. The Rub But here's the rub. When I hear \"motivational\" quotes like, \"If you want to give light to others, you have to glow yourself.” And “Ours is the responsibility to keep our lights bright for others to see and follow.” —Thomas S. Monson \"Stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places\" (Mosiah 18:9, emphasis added). \"As we live the gospel, love and serve others, stand strong in the face of temptation and persecution, and bear testimony in word and deed, we will draw others to Jesus Christ\" (\" Our Call to Share the Savior's Gospel ,\" Liahona, July 2023, 7). I think: \"You must be flawless before you can invite someone to be more like\n\nTL;DR It's the Botox. For the past 3 months, my wife, Stacia, and I have been watching Good Witch (via Netflix and Amazon Prime). Stacia adores winding down to \"Hallmark-y shows.\" We can rely on Good Witch episodes to always resolve happily. The episodes are never too intense. The height of conflict revolves around things like someone's inability to locate the perfect spot to snap a romantic photo for a new tourism brochure. I consider my time watching these shows spouse bonding time , and emotional training. My favorite thing about watching feel-good shows with Stacia is getting to observe her facial reactions to the on-screen drama. When two people lean in for a long-anticipated kiss, Stacia tucks her knees into her chest and frowns with her forehead while lifting her chin and bottom lip. While I'm typically unable to suspend my disbelief, Stacia seems completely entranced by the various characters' emotions. Wishing I could join her in being swept aw"
