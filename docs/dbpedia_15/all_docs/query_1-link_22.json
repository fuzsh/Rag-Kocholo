It was commissioned in 1878 by Masoud Mirza, the son of King Naser-al Din of the Qajar dynasty and the governor of Isfahan. However, after Masoud Mirza's death, the palace was used for various purposes by his descendants.\n\nDuring the Iranian Constitutional Revolution from 1905 to 1911, the palace played a pivotal role as a gathering point for revolutionaries. It became a base for constitutionalists and opponents of Mohammad Ali Shah, contributing to the disputes between Zal-ul-Sultan, Muzaffar al-Din Shah, and Mohammad Ali Shah. In 1908, an improvised explosive device detonated near the mansion under Mohammad Ali Shah's carriage, leading to the dissolution of the Parliament.\n\nIn 1926, the palace became home to the first official library, which later evolved into the National Library. It also housed the first Iranian museum, although some antique collections were later relocated to the newly established National Museum. To this day, Masoudieh Palace still retains some of its antique artifacts.\n\nIn 1967, the palace was repurposed as the Ministry of Education. Ten years later, in 1977, it received Cultural Heritage status and underwent renovation. The complex was transformed into a beautiful garden with the addition of shops and cafes, enhancing its appeal.\n\nOn March 1, 1998, the government officially transferred ownership of the palace to the organization operating under the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. As a testament to its historical and cultural significance, Masoudieh Palace was listed as a national heritage site of Iran on January 17, 1999, bearing the registration number 2190.\n\nWhy is this Mansion Called \"Masoudieh\"?\n\nThe name \"Masoudieh\" for the mansion has its roots in the Qajar era. At that time, Masoud Mirza, the ruler of Isfahan, commissioned the construction of a mansion in the Nezamiyeh Garden in Tehran. As the owner and patron of the mansion, it is fitting that it came to be known as Masoudieh Mansion, named after Masoud Mirza himself.\n\nArchitecture of Masoudieh Mansion\n\nMasoudieh mansion is situated in a 50,000 square meter garden, featuring the main palace and other notable structures such as a forum, restaurant, spring house, Seyed Javadi Mansion, Moshir al-Molk Mansion, and an entrance hall. The architectural style of the palace exhibits the influence of European architecture, which can be attributed to the Shah's travels abroad and the increasing number of Iranian students studying in Europe during that era.\n\nUpon entering the complex, visitors are greeted by the Divankhaneh Palace, the first building they encounter. This structure embodies the principles of transparency, lightness, and openness that marked a new direction in Iranian architecture. The presence of gridded windows allows ample fresh air and sunlight to permeate the rooms. Additionally, the incorporation of natural patterns, floral forms, and landscape ornaments contributes to the palace's fresh and European-style aesthetic. These features make Masoudieh Palace a noteworthy and distinctive example of Qajar architecture.\n\n| Read more: Iranian Modern Architecture - Tradition & Innovation Blend\n\nDifferent Sections of the Masoudieh Mansion\n\nMasoudieh Mansion, located in Tehran, consists of various sections that showcase the rich history and architectural beauty of the Qajar era.
