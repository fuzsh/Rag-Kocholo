The Nujumu'l 'Utum in the collection of Sir Chester Beatty, Dublin is a treatise on astrology and occult sciences', evidently translated from Sanskrit, under royal patronage in the Dekhan, probably Bijapur; in the early 1560s.

There are considerable difficulties in reconstructing the chronology of Humayun's first period of rule in India. Gulbadan (Lahore Litho, p. 26) says this occurred 6 months after Humayun's enthronment at the end of December 1530.\n\n14. 'Abbas Sarvani in Elliott and Dowson, IV, pp. 383-384 and 415. Ishwari Prasad, Life and Times of Humayun. p. 106. I. Prasad assumes, I believe incorrectly, that Nasir Khan (Lohani), whom 'Isa Khan superseded, was appointed by Humayun, not Sher Shah. Sambal under Humayun was the unquestioned Jagir of 'Askari : Sher Shah placed Nasir Khan under 'Isa Khan's command ('Abbas, E and D, IV, 385). 'Isa Khan was appointed to Sambal after Sher Shah had taken Delhi (ibid), so that he and Dattu must have gone to Sambal in the autumn of 1539.\n\n'Isa Khan's father and grandfather, Haybat Khan and 'Umar Khan had been prominent nobles from Bahlol Lodi's reign. The historian 'Abbas Sarvani, who was married to a great-niece of his, has many references to his career. The connection of Shaykh 'Abdul Quddus with the Sarvanis began when 'Umar Khan then supporting Barbak Shah against his brother Sikandar Lodi, passed through Radawli in the U.P. and heard of the sanctity of 'Abdul Quddus. He then persuaded him to migrate to Shahabad near Karnal in the Punjab.\n\nFor Additional information, see M.A.K.

(Elliot and Dowson, III, 447). The Zafar Nama (of Hatifi ?) was a favourite work of Humayun's and of his followers. Akbar Nama, Text, I pp. 136, 139).\n\n19. see anecdote 96.

The eighteenth century usage of 'gardi' for the onslaughts of the Marathas and cf., Ruknuddin, Lata'if, Anecdote 75, page 63, where the mother of Shaykh 'Abdul Quddus, \"who was also a saint\" saw a waking vision of a raging fire, symboliz ing the advent of Babur. In a 17th century Tazkira dealing with the 15th century, an epidemic of cholera is cured by the sympathetic magic of swallowing a fire in the jungle. ('Abdur Rahman Husayni 'Alavi, Mir'at-i-Madari.

See notes (45) for the chronology of Humayun's and of Dattu's return from Gujarat. Ace. Guibadan (Lahore Litho. p. 39)\n\nHumayun was a whole year in Agra before setting out against Sher Shah, which he probably did at the end of July 1537/14 Safar, 944 : see Hodivala. Studies in Indo- Muslim History, II, pp. 169, 210. Dattu returned to Northern India around April, 1537, and the death of Shaykh 'Abdul Quddus was in December, as mentioned earlier. The saint and his family had considerable grants of land, and it may have been in connection with these that he was attending on Humayun, or his brother Hindal, in the Fort of Agra, where Dattu met him with evident impunity.\n\n25a. Hech ta'alluq makun. Here the correct meaning \"Do not any (earthly) attachments\" would not be out of place but in other anecdotes it is clear that Dattu means \"Do not worry.\"\n\n25 b. The appropriate name of God repeated in Zikr \"Recollection\", (a spiritual exercise of loud or silent recitation) will only have a beneficial effect if it is done with the permission and instruction of a Sufi Pir. The Murshid (Pir) \"alone is a competent guide who is acquainted with the IsmA-i-'zam\". (Ja'far Sharif, tr. Herklots, ed. Crooke, Qanun-i-Islam, O. U. P., 1921, p. 219). The forty names of the anecdote must be a selection from the Isma'u'l Husna, the \"beuatiful names\" of the attributes of God, traditionally 99 in number. For a shorter selection employed in Zikr in the Qadiri silsila, see J. P. Brown, ed. H. A. Rose, \"The Darvishes\", O. U. P., 1927, p. 106 : for literature on Ismau'l Husna, ibid. p. 130, note 1. There is also a widely spread belief that the knowledge of a single secret Ism-i-A'zam (iit. \"greater\" or \"greatest Name\") from among the ninety-nine conveys great powers. \"Ismu'l A'zam, the 'exalted name of God', which possesses such virtues that he who knows it can effect whatever he willeth. slay the living and raise the dead to life, and transport himself wherever he pleases.\" Ja'far Sharif as tr. in op. cit. p. 208). The branch of the Chishti Silsila to which Shaykh 'Abdul Quddus belonged, followers of Shaykh Ahmad 'Abdul Haqq Radawlavi, were devoted to the name 'Haqq' which they used in Zikr and as a greeting. ('Abdul Quddus, Anwaru'l Uyun, Lucknow, Matba'-i-Gulzar-i-Muhammadi, 1878/1295, pp. 104-105). Asrar-i-Madari (for which see Anecdote 109, note 64) p. 33 mentions forty-one Isma'-yi- A'zam.\n\n26. \"There will be a crowding together.\" Khayriyat khwahad shud. This very odd use of Khayriyat occurs again in Anecdote 91 (text p. 73, line 1) \"Khayriyat-i-adamian shud\", \"there was a (confused, miling) throng of men.\" The condition of the Afghans at Panipat was the reverse of the \"well-being\" or \"safety\" which are more ordinary meanings of the word, but used in this novel sense, it is an apt description : see below.\n\n26a The battle of Panipat took place in April 1526. Dattu's phrases are appropriate, as Babur's victory was achieved by the Mughals encircling the numerically superior Afghans, and driving them in upon themselves in a cramped space. For a discussion of the tactics of Panipat, see L. F. Rushbrook Williams, An Empire Builder of the Sixteenth Century, S. Chand reprint, n. d. pp. 127-137.\n\n27. Indri, \"a decadent village in the Karnal district, owned...... by the Nawab of Kanjpura.\" A. Halim, A History of the Lodi Sultans, Dacca, 1961, p. 178. There are also towns of this name near Tijara, Agra Suba, and on the Jamuna near Saharanpur (A'in Eng. tr., II, pp. 203, 296). Dattu probably does not mean that the engagement took place there.\n\n29. The Saru (Saryu, mod. Sarju) is a confluent of the Gogra. Dattu like Babur probably applies the name to the joint stream which reaches the Ganges above Maner in Bihar. See Babur's Memoirs, King's ed., II, p. 271 and ibid. tr. Mrs. Beveridge, II, p. 677.\n\n29. Recently the translator observed a sheep with a similar deformity near the Jami' Masjid, Delhi.\n\n30. For the Afghan revival in Bihar under Mahmud Lodi, see A. Halim, op. cit. pp. 199-210.\n\n30 a. This sentence is repeated again, by a copyist's error, after the next one.\n\n30 b. Bir Singh Dev is evidently the Baghela ruler of Bhata, ancestor of the Maharajas of Rewah in Baghelkhand. See N.B. Roy, tr. of Ni'matullah, Appendix I, pp. 194-202, \"The Baghela Kingdom of Bliata\" : Babur, tr., Mrs. Beveridge, II, 745. The Baghela Rajas, Bir Singh Dev and Bir Bhanu helped both Afghans and Mughals in distress. I have been unable to identify Balapath from the Imperial Gazetteer of India. It may be a generic term (\"The Hill Road\" ?) used by the Afghans to describe the hilly region in the East of Baghelkhand.\n\n31. Bal Nath Jogi, a semi-mythical figure like Gorakh Nath, was not living in Babur's time. For Babur's visit to Bal Nath Tilla, the hill above the Indus near Attack with the shrine of Balinatha, see Babur, King's ed., II, 161, ibid., tr., Mrs. Beveridge, II, 452. : Also A'in, tr., II, 319. Possibly the story as it reached Anant Guru and Dattu may have been confused with that of Babur's visit to the Jogis of Gorh Katri in Peshawar, Babur King's ed. II, p. 111, tr. Mrs. Beveridge, I, p. 394. Babur's visit to Gorh Katri evidently caught the popular imagination, as it is one of the best illustrated subjects in the British Museum and other Babur-Nama manuscrpits.\n\n32. Payag,—Prayag, Allahabad, sacred to Hindus for the confluence of the rivers Ganges and Jamuna (Triveni). The words of the sanyasi are 'Tirth kardan', to perform Tirth.\n\n33. Maydan-i-basihi. See introduction. The phrase is probably roughly equi valent to the Mughal \"urdu\". For basihi cf. Bayazid, Tazkira, pp. 51, 96, 126.\n\n33 a. Bayazid and Bibban were defeated by Humayun at Damoh on the banks of the Gomti probably in 1532. The anecdote may therefore be dated 1532-3. The Fort of Chunar, to which Shaykh Ahmad went, was held by Sher Khan Sur, who had refused to join the other Afghans in their offensive, and was probably not then on good terms with their leaders. Another descendant of Shaykh Farid, Shaykh Khalil, acted as intermediary between Sher Khan and Humayun before the battle of Chausa, but as Shaykh Farid has sometimes been called \"the second Adam\" from the number of his descendants, no close relationship with Shaykh Ahmad can be presumed.\n\nFor Mian Bibban's varried career, see Babur, tr., Mrs. Beveridge, II, 744. Only from Dattu do we know of this chief's adventures with Bahadur of Gujrat, and in Bcrar. On account of his close connection with him, Dattu's evidence in anecdote 95 that Mian Bibban was a Lodi (not a Jilvani) seems decisive. 'Abbas Sarvani also calls him Sahu-Khayl (i. e., Lodi) and says he joined Sher Khan Sur, along with many other distinguished Afghans, after Bahadur's defeat. (E. and D., III, p. 352).\n\n34. Some difficulties of the chronology of Humayun's Gujarat campaign are discussed by Sukumar Ray in Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, 'Aligarh, 1960, pp. 185-187, \"Date of the Mughal Conquest of Champaner under Humayun\". The difficulties mostly spring from Erskine and the Beveridges attaching too much significance to Abu'l Fazl's statement that the siege of Champaner took four months. Humayun left Agra in Sha'ban, 941/ February 1935 (Gulbadan Begam, Humayun-nama, Lahore litho. p. 38). Bahadur stormed Chitor early in March (I. Prasad, op. cit., 72 qu. Vir Vinod, II, p. 31) Humayun advanced into Malwa, and the two armies met at Mandasaur, now 65 miles by rail from Chitor on the Khandwa line, close to where the Hun leader Mihirakula was defeated by Yashodharman in the 6th century. Bahadur fled from Mandasaur leaving his army and supplies, around the 25th of April. (See Hodivala, II, p. 271). He went by Mandu, stormed by Humayun after a few days' siege, and then onward by Champaner to Ahmadabad and Cambay, hotly pursued by Humayun. Then he escaped by sea to Diu, where the Portuguese had establistied themselves, burning his navy to prevent pursuit. Humayun then turned to the siege of Champaner, which contained the royal treasure, and took the fort in Safar (942)/ August of the same year (1535)[ (S. Ray, op. cit., 186. Hodivala, II, 209).\n\nDattu's anecdote requires a sketch of Ba bur's debacle at Mandasaur. When the armies met, similar considerations to those which made Babur dig himself in beside the town well of Panipat in 1525 seem to have dictated Bahadur's strategy. Like Babur he possessed a famous Turkish Gunmaster, Rumi Khan, and his guns were much supe rior to those of Humayun. Acting on Rumi Khan advice, he brought his army in beside the fort of Mandasaur, and surrounded the open sides with a wooden stockage (Kashghar in Dattu's and other accounts) and a ditch (Khandaq. Nizamuddin Ahmad Tabaqar-i-Akbari, 1875, litho., p. 196. Elliot and Dowson, V. 191). There must have been, as at Panipat, breaks in the stockade near a level expanse, on which it was hoped that the Mughals would risk a pitched battle in a position where they would be exposed to the havoc of Rumi Khan's guns. In early April casualties were inflicted on a Mughal skirmishing party by the guns, but the Mughals were militarily too sophisticated to offer a pitched battle in these circumstances. Bahadur had dug himself in very hastily without a supply of grain, and the Mughals encircling and besieging his stockade prevented any from being brought in by the Banjaras, so that in a few weeks his army was starving. Bahadur, possibly unnerved by this unforseen disaster after some years of very successful campaigning, decided on flight, spiking his great guns aud mutilating his famous elephants, and leaving his leaderless forces to flee as best they could.\n\nReflection on the strategy of Mandasaur may lead us to reconsider the traditional role of traitor accorded to Rumi Khan. The author of the Mir'at-i-Sikandari maintains that he was corresponding with Humayun from the moment when he was not given the governorship of Chitor (p. 307) and tells a tale of a parrot who abused Rumi Khan in Humayun's presence : (Phat ! Rumi Khan Haramkhor!\" p. 319). This view probably reflects the bitterness of the Gujarat aristocracy after he had led Bahadur to disaster and then defected, and should be treated with suspicion.\n\nRumi Khan's strategic advice at Mandasaur is most clearly given in Nizamuddin Ahmad's account ( op. cit., 196, Elliott, V, 191). Nizamuddin Ahmad has considerable authority in matters concerning the Gujarat campaign, because during it his father was in the service of Mirza 'Askari. He gives no hint of previous treachery, and suggests that Bahadur was disposed to listen to Rumi Khan's advice. because the Gujaratis were dispirited by the rout of their advance guarded by the Mughals. Rumi Khan would in fact have been led to his major error by his previous Indian experience.\n\nGujarat was the earliest affected of the Indian sultanates by developments in the Near East. Rumi Khan in the compaigns against Malwa and Chitor would have been confronted with opponents who may not have been familiar with the full effectiveness of the latest developments of gunnery and this would have led him to miscalculate that the Mughals might do battle in adverse conditions : however, they had Turkish gunners of their own and were not so naive. The disastrous consequences of his mistaken advice might well have endangered his own life if he had remained on with the Gujaratis, and prudence then dictated his defection to Humayun, who was glad to avail himself of his skill as a gunner,\n\n34a. The Muzaffari was a light silver coin of 64 ratis, first minted by Muzaffar II of Gujarat, father of Bahadur. Apparently it was worth half a rupee. H. N. Wright, Catalogue of the Coins of the Indian Museum, p, 224. C. J. Brown, Coins of India, Calcutta, 1922, p. 88 Hodivala Mughal Numismatics, p. 350, 351.\n\n35. cf. Safar Nama of Anand Ram Mukhlis, Rampur, Hindostan Press, p. 103 and ref. there given. The text here is corrupt For 'ast' read 'asp' possibly 'inan' (rein) is omitted by the copyist, or it is understood by the author.\n\n36. Ta'alluq makun, see introduction.\n\n36a. \"Janvaran\" : commonly if incorrectly used mainly for birds cf. W. J. Elmslie, Vocabulary of Kashmiri, 1872. s. v. ; Jawhar Aptabchi, B. M. add. 16711, f53 b. ; Bayazid, Tazkira, p. 66.\n\n36b. Dar mian-i-qal'ah-yi-Mandu shud dar Burhanpur rasidam,\n\nThe author or copyist frequently omits the last syllable of the past participle, e.g., \"guft firistad\" (Anec. 94). Therefore read 'shuda'. The sentence does not mean that Dattu was in the Fort of Mandu itself, which was quickly stormed by Humayun, when very few troops escaped from it. Elsewhere Dattu invariably refers to Malwa as \"the country of the Fort of Mandu\" : he therefore means that he passed through Malwa to Burhanpur.\n\n37. See Note 33 A. Anecdote 94.\n\n37 a. do seh sa'at. The sa'at like the ghari was a period of 24 minutes. (Nand Lal Srivastav, Siyaq Nama, Naval Kishore, 1879, pp. 2-3.)\n\n38. Jalgaon, in Narnala district, Berar. A'in. tr. II 241.\n\n38 a. 'Murasila' is twice used, apparently in this peculiar sense.\n\n38 b. ma-ra chi dhaka ast. Dhaka, Hindi, 'A push'.\n\n39. cf. Anecdote 95, note (35). Frequent references to sleeping in this posture occur in Medieval Indo-Muslim sources. cf. 'Abdul Haqq, Akhbaru'l Akhyar, p. 138. \"Sar bar zanu nihadam : Hazrat-i-Risalat ra didam.\" \"I placed my head upon my knees and I saw the Prophet Muhammad.\"\n\n40. As the Dakhni soldier guarding him evidently did not understand what Dattu was saying, it is probable that he spoke the sentence in Pushtu. For the currency of Pushtu among the Indo-Afghans of this period see the anecdote of Abbas Sarvani concerning Sher Shah (\"I respect the Afghan tongue as a friend\") in Elliott and Dowson, IV, 413. For other stories of the currency of Pushto among Afghans in downcountry India, see Tarikh-i-Da'udi, Aligarh, 1950, story of Bahlol Lodi and Mulla Qadin, p. 12, and Abdul Haqq, Akhbaru'l Akhyar, pp. 283-4, anecdote of the Majzub Ilahdin (?) who wandered round the Bazar of Narnaul. An Urdu translation published at Delhi early this century seems in places to represent a better text than the Persian lithograph, and reads \"ghazalha' i-Afghani\", Pushtu ghazals, for \"bazlha'i-Afghani\", Pushtu jokes : if it is correct it is early evidence for the existence of the ghazal as a lterary form in Pushtu.\n\n41. Sultan 'Alauddin or 'Alam Khan Lodi, one of the younger sons of Bahlol Lodi, is frequently refered to in Babur's Memoirs. The latter title is a source of confusion as there were also (and simultaneously in Gujarat), 'Alam Khan Lodi Amiru'l Umara' and a Sultan 'Alam Lodi. The last may have been a grandson of 'Alauddin, and was either mutilated or put to death by Humayun when he captured Mandu in 1535. Sultan 'Alam Lodi had joined the Mughal court in youth, possibly when 'Alauddin came to Kabul, and had been adopted as a son by Babur's powerful minister Mir Khalifa (Mir'at-i-Sikandari, p. 289) : he had therefore been given charge of Kalpi but rebelled and went over to Bahadur early in Humayun's reign, and these circumstances may explain the severity with which he was treated.\n\nFor a summary of the career of 'Alauddin 'Alam Khan, son of Bahlol, to whom this anecdote of Dattu's relates, see N.B. Roy, tr. of Ni'matullah, p. 165, note 2. However he fought at the Battle of Kanwa, not as stated there on Rana Sanga's side, but as a commander in Babur's force. (Babur, King's ed. II, p. 297). His imprison ment thereafter was in the great fortress of Qal'a-yi-Zafar in Badakhshan, from which he escaped with the help of Afghan merchants, making his way through Baluchistan to take refuge in Gujarat, (which had been his base in Ibrahim Lodi's time, and where his son Tatar Khan also was serving with Bahadur). (Akbar Nama, text, 129. See also Babur, tr. Mrs. Beveridge, Biographical Index, II, 727, 727).\n\n'Alam Khan Lodi, Amiru'l Umara of Gujarat was evidently not a very close relation. If he is the \"Sultan'Alam Khan II\" of Dr. A. Halim's family tree of the I-Lodis (op. cit., p. 299) he would be the great-grandson of Mubarak Khan, brother of Sultan Sikandar Lodi and of 'Alauddin : however there are no annotations to indicate the sources from which these intricate relationships are compiled. His conduct at the death of 'Alauddin Lodi in Gujarat affords an interesting and striking instance of Indo- Afghan family pride and solidarity. The two Lodis had been fighting on opposite sides in the factions of the Gujarat aristocracy under Mahmud III. Defeated, 'Alauddin was put to death by Mahmud on the advice of his low-born minister and favourite, Fattuji Chirimar. The body was left exposed for three days. 'Alam Khan Lodi, in spite of having fought on the opposite side, demanded Fattuji's head for the insult. Mahmud did not agree to the demand, but when, after a 3 days siege, the nobles came to argue with Mahmud, Fattuji was unwise enough to appear in the Darbar. At 'Alam Khan's orders, he was dragged by the hair away from the Sultan's throne to which he was clinging and \"cut to pieces\", whereupon Sultan Mahmud tried to kill himself with a dagger. (Mir'at-i-Sikandari, pp. 346-347).\n\n42. Nandurbar is about half way on the road from Surat to Burhanpur. A'in, tr. II, 257. Roe, Travels, ed. Foster, O.U.P., p. 67 and Map. w. Finch in Early Travels in India, ed. Foster, p. 137.\n\n43. In the epithet and name, Datlu probably confuses two Sufi Pirs of Gujarat, father and son. Shah-i-'Alam Shah Manjhan was the son of Qutb-i-'Alam Sayyid Burhanuddin, who was a grandson of the well known fourteenth century saint, \"Makhdum-i-Jahanian Jahangasht\" Sayyid Jalaluddin Bukhari Suhravardi of Ucch. For notices of Qutb-i-'Alam and Shah-i-'Alam, see 'Abdul Haqq, Akhbaru'l Akhyar, pp. 157-158. They died in 857/1453 and 880/1475-6 respectively. The younger was also instructed by Shaykh Ahmad Khattu, to whom Dattu subsquently refers.\n\n44. For a notice of Shaykh Ahmad Khattu, the saint buried at Sarkhej in the outskirts of Ahmadabad, see Akhbaru'l Akhyar, pp. 153-157. He died in 845/1441 (Mir'at-i-Sikandari, pp. 63-64). Dattu, who uses the phrases of respect for the dead in writing of these pirs, obviously knew at the time of his dream that they were long dead. But the influence of Pirs on wordly events would not stop at their death, but endured through subsequent centuries, as Dattu's anecdote (number 109) about Salar Mas'ud, and the cults of the great Dargahs of India today alike testify, though as the prerogatives of the Wilayat of saint were passed on to a living successor, it might be expected that the extent of the deceased Pirs' interference in mundane matters would diminish with the passage of time. From Anecdote 100 almost all Dattu's stories are of the 'Abdul Quddus' interventions after death. Shaykh 'Abdul Quddus himself seems to have held a very unusual belief, that the Wilayat of a saint lasted for forty years after his death, after which he was usually transferred to the rank of Nubuwwat, and ceased to influence earthly affairs : but in the case of those whose Wilayat was particularly potent, as in his belief, in that of Shaykh Ahmad 'Abdul Haqq of Radawli, the rule was relaxed and they would continue to exert influence \"till the end of the world.\" Shaykh 'Abdul Quddus Gangohi, Anwaru'l 'Uyun Lucknow, Matba'-i-Gulzar- i-Muhammadi, 1878/1295. p. 110).\n\n45. Dattu's information from Gujarat cannot have been good, or in writing down the anecdote 11 or 12 years later the details of a campaign in which he did not participated had become rather blurred. See note (34 for Humayun's movements until August 1535. After taking the Fort of Champaner, he would appear to have spent a number of months more there. The Mughals had captured so much treasure there that they took no steps to collect the revenue of Gujarat. The officers of Bahadur Shah, by collecting it, got the resources to amass a new army, and the collection would have been that of the Kharif, i. e. not earlier than October, 1535, the next harvest to fall after Humayun had acquired the treasure of Champaner. Bahadur was still in retreat in Diu, but 'Imadu'l Mulk and his other officers reestablished themselves in Ahmadabad. Against these Humayun marched and defeated the Gujaratis at Mahmudabad, near Ahmadabad. This was the period of Humayun's stay in Ahmadabad, to which Dattu refers, and must be in the winter of 1535-6. But Bahadur was not present at the battle of Mahmudabad, and the report of it which reached the Afghans at Nandurbar could hardly have made it out as a Mughal defeat. Humayun then left Gujarat, putting Mirza 'Askari, his brother, in charge at Ahmadabad. 'Askari stayed long enough for a great deal of intrigue to take place and for Gujarati forces to take over one by one Mughal outposts in the province. After an engagement with Bahadur at Asawal near Ahmadabad, 'Askari left Gujarat by Champaner and Mewar, in a race to take Agra before Humayun got there. Humayun had left Gujarat at the appearance of disorders in Malwa, and then stayed on in Burhanpur and Mandu till he got news of his brother's intentions. We know nothing of what he was doing, and the presumption, to which Jawhar's remarks about his behaviour at Gaur lend support, is that he was just amusing himself. He then set out rapidly for Agra, and managed to catch 'Askari on the road near Chitor. The Mir'at-i-Sikandari says (p. 319) specifically that the period of Mirza 'Askari's stay (muddat-i-tawaqquf) in Gujarat was nine months and some days, which cannot include the time before Humayun himself departed. Haji Dabir however states that the Mughals left Gujarat on the 3rd Zi'l Hijja, 942, after a stay of thirteen months and thirteen days (Zafaru'l Walih, p. 260) Hodivala (op. cit. II. p. 270) shows that the date of their entry was reckoned from the day of Bahadur's flight from Mandasaur. Haji Dabir's date can be reconciled with the information in the Mir'at, by supposing that 9 (nuh) is a mistake, of a kind which can very easily be made, 3 (seh). It would then appear that 'Askar left Gujarat at the end of May, 1536, and Humayun about the middle of February, 1536. We are then relieved of the necessity of believing that Humayun spent an exhorbitantly long time idling in Burhanpur and Mandu, and Dattu's forgetfulness about his stay there becomes more understandable. Humayun's arrival in Agra around June or July 1536 reconciles Gulbadan's statement about the length of his stay with the date, given in Farishta and accepted by Hodivala, for his departure from Agra against Sher Khan.\n\nDattu's anecdote can only refer to the battle of Asawal in the spring of 1536 : his dream was fifteen days before the news reached Nandurbar. Humayun, having left Gujarat, was not present at it, but Bahadur was. It is normally represented as an indecisive engagement, whose effect was to weaken the already disntegrating Mughal hold on Gujarat, and to lead'Askari to his rash and disloyal course of action. Dattu is unique in representing it as a great victory, and in his description of the Mughals returning to Agra \"in a broken condition\", though the collapse of the Gujarat expedi tion was a psychological turning point in the \"Mughal-Pathan\" struggle. Dattu's statement that Humayun was at the battle is more likely to be the result of carelessness than of ignorance, for if Dattu was at Nandurbar he could hardly not have been aware of Humayun's presence in Burhanpur and Mandu.\n\nDattu's dream seems to preserve some indications of the political situation which the author had forgotten when he recorded it. 'Abdul Quddus' offer to the Pirs of Gujarat, and in it was that either he should come and join the Pirs in Gujarat they would jointly drive Humayun out of Gujarat, or that he would drive Humayun out of Malwa while they drove him out of Gujarat. Humayun, we know, had left Gujarat on the report of disturbances in Malwa, but these seem to have died away with his presence there, while those in Gujarat grew in his absence. The dream therefore reflects a consciousness of opportunities to try and upset the Mughal position in either Malwa or Gujarat, — opportunities which the most persistent of their Afghan opponents must have been watching, — and the growing conviction that Gujarat was the more promising area in which to rally. From Nandurbar 'Alauddin and his followers would have been able to move with equal ease into Malwa or Gujarat.\n\nCite article\n\nCite article\n\nCite article\n\nOR\n\nDownload to reference manager\n\nIf you have citation software installed, you can download article citation data to the citation manager of your choice\n\nSelect your citation manager software:\n\nDirect import\n\nShare options\n\nShare\n\nShare this article\n\nShare with email\n\nEMAIL ARTICLE LINK\n\nShare on social media\n\nShare access to this article\n\nSharing links are not relevant where the article is open access and not available if you do not have a subscription.\n\nFor more information view the Sage Journals article sharing page.\n\nInformation, rights and permissions\n\nInformation\n\nPublished In\n\nArticle first published: January 1965\n\nIssue published: January 1965\n\nRights and permissions\n\nRequest permissions for this article.\n\nAuthors\n\nAffiliations\n\nMetrics and citations\n\nMetrics\n\nJournals metrics\n\nThis article was published in The Indian Economic and Social History Review.\n\nVIEW ALL JOURNAL METRICS\n\nArticle usage*\n\nTotal views and downloads: 187\n\n*Article usage tracking started in December 2016\n\nAltmetric\n\nSee the impact this article is making through the number of times it’s been read, and the Altmetric Score.\n\nLearn more about the Altmetric Scores\n\nArticles citing this one\n\nReceive email alerts when this article is cited\n\nWeb of Science: 0\n\nCrossref: 0\n\nPashto Border Literature as Geopolitical Knowledge\n\nSaintly visions: Other histories and history’s others in the medieval ...\n\nAuthor of one’s fate: Fatalism and agency in Indo-Persian histories\n\nTribe, Diaspora, and Sainthood in Afghan History\n\nEnvisioning power...\n\nEmerging Approaches to the Sufi Traditions of South Asia: Between Text...\n\nFigures and tables\n\nFigures & Media\n\nTables\n\nView Options\n\nGet access\n\nAccess options\n\nIf you have access to journal content via a personal subscription, university, library, employer or society, select from the options below:\n\nI am signed in as:\n\nView my profileSign out\n\nI can access personal subscriptions, purchases, paired institutional access and free tools such as favourite journals, email alerts and saved searches.\n\nLogin failed.
