        "text": "Who were the Mamluks?\n\nMamluk (also transliterated as Mameluke, mamluq, mamluke, mameluk, mameluke, mamaluke or marmeluke) is a term most commonly referring either to slave soldiers, freed slaves, Muslim converts assigned to military and administrative duties, and Muslim rulers of slave origin (most prominent of which is the Mamluk Dynasty of Egypt & Syria which repelled and saved the Muslim world from the scourge of the Mongols).\n\nThe Mamluks are not actually depicted in Dirilis Ertugrul but there are mentions of them in Season 5 and specifically the then Mamluk Sultan of Egypt & Syria: Al-Malik Al-Zahir Rukn al-Din Baibars al-Bunduqdari or more simply known as Baybars/Baibars. Ertugrul Bey at the end of Season 5 mentions obtaining their support (as well as the Muslim Mongol military commander and ruler of the Golden Horde, Berke Khan (grandson of Genghis Khan) at the end of Season 4) in order to defeat the Mongol Ilkhanate under Hulagu Khan (another grandson of Genghis Khan) due to their impending invasion of Anatolia (Sultan Baybars and Berke Khan did indeed work together but any involvement from Ertugrul is highly speculative).\n\nCarl F. Petry - in his book titled “The Mamluk Sultanate: A History” - writes that the term “Mamluk” itself is a passive participle of the Arabic root ‘mim-lam-kaaf’ (to own/possess) and literally means “one owned”. In a military context, the term referred to a slave who was trained specifically for, and whose responsibility was, martial duties.\n\nIn the book titled “Mongols and Mamluks: The Mamluk-Ilkhanid War, 1260-1281” by Reuven Amitai-Preiss, the terms “Mamluk” and “Mamluks” with capital letters tends to specifically refer to the Mamluk Sultanate established in Egypt in 1250 CE whilst those terms in common letters refers to military slaves in a general sense.\n\n(It’s also important to recognise that the term “slave” here does not have the same connotation as to how we popularly understand slavery, etc from the European Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade.)\n\nDr. Kallie Szczepanski writes that the mamluks were a class of warrior-enslaved people, mostly of Turkic or Caucasian (Circassians, Abkhazians, etc) ethnicity, who served between the 9th and 19th century in the Islamic world. He further states that despite their origins as enslaved people, the mamluks often had higher social standing than ‘free-born’ people.\n\nThe aforementioned Carl F. Petry (in his book “The Mamluk Sultanate: A History”) argues that mamluks ranged from various backgrounds and seeing them just through the prism of their skin colour (i.e white) would be incorrect and simplistic. Having said that, following the Muslim control over much of western Central Asia, Turkic tribal groups made up a significant number of the mamluk institution in its formative phases.\n\nIn fact, individual rulers of Mamluk background reigned in various countries, including the famous Mahmud of Ghazni in modern-day Afghanistan and India, and every ruler of the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt and Syria (1250-1517 CE).\n\nThe mamluks were also utilised by various dynasties (particularly in a military capacity) including the Abbasid Caliphate, the Oghuz Turkic Zengid Dynasty; the Kurdish Ayyubid Dynasty; the Oghuz Turkic Seljuk Dynasty & the Ottoman Caliphate.\n\nTulunids (868–905 CE):\n\nThe Tulunid dynasty (al-ṭūlūnīūn) was founded and named after the Abbasid Turkic general and governor of Egypt - Ahmad ibn Tulun - in the year 868 CE, who formed the first ever independent state in Egypt (as well as parts of Syria) since the Ptolemaic dynasty (around 898 years prior); the Ptolemaic dynasty was the last dynasty of Ancient Egypt and were a Macedonian Greek royal family who ruled the Ancient Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt, which was founded by Ptolemy I Soter - a companion of Alexander the Great - in 305 BC/BCE, and ended with the rule of the popular Queen Cleopatra of Egypt in 30 BC/BCE.\n\nAhmad ibn Tulun was himself was said to be born in Baghdad on the 20th of September, 835 CE (23 Ramadan, 220 AH). According to Matthew S. Gordon in his book, “The Breaking of a Thousand Swords: A History of the Turkish Military of Samarra”, Ahmad’s father Tulun was said to be a Turk from the region known to the Arabs as Tagharghar or in Turkic, Toghuz-oghuz or Toghuzghuz; this region by medieval Arab historians is attributed to the Uighur Federation or Uyghur Khanate/Uighur Khanate.\n\nIkhshidids (935–969 CE):\n\nThe Ikhshidid Dynasty or Ikhshidids (al-Ikhshīdīyūn) were the second (Sunni) dynasty of Turkic mamluk origins, and like the Tulunids before them, also ruled Egypt (as well as Syria & the Hejaz). In fact, around 30 years following the retaking of Egypt by the Abbasid Caliphate from the Tulunids (in 905 CE), the Ikhshidid Dynasty ruled Egypt autonomously though in the name of the Abbasids from 935 CE until 969 CE, when the Shia Fatimid Dynasty conquered Egypt.\n\nAbu Bakr Muhammad ibn Tughj ibn Juff ibn Yiltakin ibn Furan ibn Furi ibn Khaqan or more simply known as Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid - similar to Ahmad ibn Tulun before him - was a Turkic Abbasid commander and governor. His father Tughj ibn Juff served both the Abbasids and the Tulunids, and he acquired his military and administrative experience alongside his father.\n\nLike Ahmad ibn Tulun, Muhammad ibn Tughj was also born in Baghdad though he grew up in Syria. Prior to being appointed as the governor of Egypt in 935 CE, Ibn Tughj had also held the position of governor in Damascus (Shaam).\n\nThe Ikhshidids were founded in a time of chaos for the Abbasids with the Caliphate becoming increasingly decentralised due to events following what was known as the Anarchy at Samarra (861-870 CE).\n\nUpon being appointed as governor, Muhammad ibn Tughj had to deal with war/possibility of war with multiple factions including the Fatimids; he managed to bring about a high-level of stability to Egypt in the early years of his reign and even managed to repel the Fatimids with victory via his brother Ubaydullah ibn Tughj.\n\nGhaznavids (977–1186 CE):\n\nTheGhaznavids/Ghaznavid Dynasty (Ġaznaviyān) were a Persian-influenced Turkic mamluk dynasty who at their peak ruled much of modern-day Iran, Afghanistan, Transoxiana (covers modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, southern Kyrgyzstan, and southwest Kazakhstan) and some northern parts of the Indian subcontinent from the late 10th century (977 CE) until the late 12th century (1186 CE).\n\nThe Ghaznavid Empire was founded by Abu Mansur Sabuktigin or simply Sabuktigin (also spelled as Sabuktagin, Sabuktakin, Sebüktegin and Sebük Tigin) and he ruled from 977 CE to 997 CE.\n\nHe founded the Ghaznavids after he ascended to the rule of Ghazna (in modern Afghanistan) around 14 years after the death of his father-in-law: Alptigin (Alptegin/Alp-Tegin), formerly the commander-in-chief of the army of the (Sunni) Persian Samanid Empire (in Khorasan) as well as the Governor of Ghazna for the Samanids (between 962 and 963 CE).\n\nBoth Alptegin and Sabuktigin still recognised Samanid autonomy over Ghazna, despite the latter despite founding the Ghaznavid Empire; it was not until the rule of Sabuktigin’s son - Mahmud of Ghazni/Mahmud I of Ghazna/Mahmud Ghaznavi/Mahmud ibn Sebuktigin - (from 999 to 1030 CE) that the Ghaznavids started exercising their own decisions and became independent of the Samanid dynasty, who at this time were nearing their demise.\n\nMahmud of Ghazni (referred to as such since he was born in Ghazni/Ghaznin/Ghazna, modern-day central Afghanistan) prior to being the Ghaznavid ruler was an Emir/Governor in Khorasan under the aforementioned Samanid Empire, and was referred to as “Sayf ad-Dawla” or “Sword of the State”.\n\nAfter his father’s death, he ascended to the Ghaznavid throne at the age of 27 and was the first Ghaznavid ruler to have the title of “Sultan” (Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni), simultaneously indicating the extent of his power as well as his pledge of allegiance to the Abbasid Caliphate (The Ghaznavids like many other (Sunni) Muslim dynasties pledged allegiance to the Abbasids).\n\nAccording to Joseph W. Meri in “Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1”, under Sultan Mahmud’s reign, his capital of Ghazna almost rivalled the Abbasid capital of Baghdad as it became a significant cultural, economic & intellectual hub in the Muslim-majority world and even attracted renowned individuals like Abu Rayhan al-Biruni (Al-Biruni) and Abul-Qasem Ferdowsi Tusi (Ferdowsi).\n\nKhwarezmians (1077–1231 CE):\n\nThe Khwarazmian Dynasty/Anushtegin Dynasty (Khwārazmshāhiyān) was a(nother) Persian-influenced Turkic Sunni Muslim dynasty of mamluk origins that ruled large parts of present-day Central Asia, Afghanistan, and Iran in the approximate period of 1077 to 1231 CE, first as vassals of the Seljuq Dynasty and the Qara-Khitan/Kara-Khitan Khanate, and thereafter as independent rulers, up until the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia in the 13th century CE.\n\nThe Khwarezmian Empire/Khwarezm-Shah Dynasty was founded by Anushtegin Gharchai or just Anushtegin, a (Turkic) commander of the Seljuks. Anuştegin (also known as Nūštekīn Gharcha) was formerly a slave/servant of the leaders of the region known as Gharchistan/Gharjistan (hence where “Gharchai/Gharcha” comes from); interestingly enough, the future Mamluk Sultan of Egypt and Syria - Saif ad-Din Qutuz/Qutuz - also descends from Anushtegin.\n\nMoroever, according to Jonathan L. Lee in the book titled\"Ancient Supremacy\": Bukhara, Afghanistan, and the Battle for Balkh, 1731-1901”, defining the region Gharchistan is difficult.\n\nThe region lays south of, and adjacent to, Ghuzgan (in modern-day Afghanistan) whilst it lays north of Ghor (also in modern-day Afghanistan) and was the name used to describe the region which encompassed the feeder streams of the Herat River/Hari River (in modern-day Afghanistan).\n\nThe 14th century historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani in the Oğuzname stated that, \"Similarly, the most distant ancestor of Sultan Muhammad Khwarazmshah (Ala ad-Din Muhammad II) was Nushtekin Gharcha, who was a descendant of the Begdili tribe of the Oghuz family\". On the other hand, the Turkish historian İbrahim Kafesoğlu believes Anushtegin Gharchai was either of Khalaj or Cigil Turkic origin, while the historian Z. V. Togan states he was of Qipchaq, Qanḡlï or Uighur origin.\n\n(Sources: C.E Bosworth in \"The Political and Dynastic History of the Iranian World (A.D. 1000-1217)\" AND John Andrew Boyle in The Cambridge History of Iran. Vol.5, The Saljuq and Mongol Period. Cambridge University Press).\n\nFrom this, we see there are differences of opinion as to the actual background of Anush Tigin and he may have belonged to either the Begdili Tribe of Oghuz Turks or to the Chigil, Khalaj, Qipchaq, Qangly, or Uyghur Turks.\n\nAnushtegin who was said to be a slave/servant to the rulers of Gharchistan was later sold to the Seljuks and specifically to a Seljuk officer by the name of Gumus-Tegin Bilge Beg.\n\nAnushtegin was said to have been put in command together with Gumushtegin Bilge Beg - in 1073 CE by the Great Seljuk Sultan Malik-Shah I (son of Sultan Alp Arslan), with the responsibility to retake territory in the north of Greater Khorasan that had been taken by the Ghaznavids.\n\nHe was subsequently made the sultan's tasht-dar (Persian word meaning \"keeper of the royal vessels\"), and, as the revenues from Khwarezm were used to pay for the expenses incurred by this position, he was made governor of the province (or Shihna of Khwarezm) in 1077 CE (a position he held until his death in 1097 CE).\n\nThe details of his tenure as governor are unclear, but in the same year of his death (1097 CE), the post was briefly held by Ekinchi bin Qochqar on the orders of the Seljuk Sultan Barkiyaruq (son of Sultan Malik-Shah I and grandson of Sultan Alp Arslan) before being transferred to Anushtegin’s son, Muhammad I or Qutb-ad-Din Muhammad: the first from Anushtegin’s bloodline to hold this position as well as the first “Shah of Khwarezm”, and someone who was loyal to the Seljuk Sultan Ahmad Sanjar/Sencer (son of Sultan Malik-Shah I).\n\nThe Delhi Mamluk Sultanate/Dynasty was founded by Qutb ud-Din Aibak: the Turkic Central Asian mamluk commander who served the Ghurid/Ghorid dynasty (Dudmân-e Ğurīyân/Šansabānī) - a dynasty with Persian origins from the Ghor region of modern Afghanistan.\n\nThe people of Ghor were said to be Buddhists who later converted to Islam after the region came under the rule of the Ghaznavid Dynasty during the reign of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna.\n\nThe Ghurid Dynasty itself spanned across many regions at their zenith. It encompassed Khorasan in the west and reached modern-day northern India as far as Bengal in the east. Their first capital was Firozkoh in Ghor itself, which was later replaced by Herat and finally Ghazna (all cities in modern-day Afghanistan).\n\nThe Ghurids were succeeded in Khorasan and Persia by the the Khwarazmian Dynasty and in modern-day northern India by the Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nDuring the reign of Ghurid Sultan Muizz ad-Din Muhammad Ghori/Muhammad of Ghor (born as Shihab ad-Din), Qutb ad-Din Aibak was tasked with looking after the territories of the Ghorid dynasty within the Indian subcontinent/Hindustan; Qutb ad-Din further expanded the Ghorid state by taking territories within modern-day northern India.\n\nThe Mamluk Dynasty of Iraq/Mesopotamia (1704–1831 CE):\n\nThe Mamluk Dynasty of Iraq/Mesopotamia (Mamālīk al-ʻIrāq) was a dynasty of Caucasian Georgian mamluk origin which ruled over Iraq in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nEyalets, also known as beylerbeyliks or pashaliks, were primary administrative divisions of the Uthmani Khilafah (Ottoman Caliphate). The Mamluk Dynasty of Iraq was founded by Hasan Pasha - the Ottoman Georgian governor - and it ruled over the eyalets of Baghdad, Basra & Shahrizor (Eyalet of Shahrizor covered parts of present-day Iraqi Kurdistan) between the years 1704 CE to 1831 CE.\n\nThe Mamluk Dynasty of Iraq/Mesopotamia had a total of 10 rulers and as mentioned above, began with the governorship of Hasan Pasha (r. 1704-1723 CE) and ended over a century later under the reign of Dawud Pasha (r. 1816-1831 CE).\n\nHasan Pasha's son and successor - Ahmad Pasha (r. 1723 to 1747 CE) - continued his father’s policy of recruiting mamluks and promoting them to key administrative and military positions.\n\nMoroever, both Hasan & his son Ahmad were looked at positively by the Ottoman Sublime Porte due to their efforts in curbing troublesome (Arab & Kurdish) tribes as well as defending Iraq militarily from both the Shia Safavid Dynasty and an offshoot so to speak of the Safavids: the Afsharids of Persia (founded by the former Safavid military commander Nader Khan {later Nader Shah} who deposed the final Safavid Ruler Abbas III, and whose dynasty was said to have reached a similar extent of power dating back all the way to the Sasanian Empire {224 to 651 CE}).\n\nBy 1750 CE, Sulayman Abu Layla (son-in-law & successor of Ahmad Pasha) had secured his power and established his presence at the ultimate ruler of Baghdad and had been recognized by the Ottoman Porte as the (official) first Mamluk Pasha of Iraq.\n\nThe relationship between the Mamluks of Iraq and the Ottomans wasn’t always so straightforward though as with their increase in power and further establishing themselves, the Iraqi Mamluks seeked to gain more autonomy from the Ottoman central government; they encouraged foreign trade into their provinces and even gave permission to the controversial British East India Company (BEIC).\n\nOn the other hand, the Iraqi Mamluks failed to establish a proper system of succession and so unsurprisingly it led to internal struggles for power and formation of rival Mamluk households.\n\nThis also led to Ottoman attempts in obtaining direct control of Iraq and deposing the Mamluks of Iraq/Mesopotamia. The fall of the Mamluks of Iraq and the governorship of the new Ottoman Governor of Iraq - Ali Ridha Pasha/Ali Rıza Pasha - heralded the period of direct Ottoman control over much of Iraq (this lasted until the Ottomans lost control of Iraq to the British Empire during WW1/World War 1).\n\nEven after the fall of the Mamluks of Iraq, Ali Ridha Pasha still had to contend with the fact that much of the influential persons in Iraq were from former mamluk households, and so integrated them into the various administrative positions of his governorship. He even went on to marry the daughter of the former Ottoman Mamluk Governor of Iraq: Sulayman Pasha the Little (r. 1807 to 1810 CE).\n\nThe aforementioned Sulayman Pasha was treated very favourably by Jazzar Pasha and was lobbied by the latter for the position of Ottoman Governor of Egypt. Later, Sulayman ended up in the inner circle of Jazzar Pasha.\n\nThere was a moment of significant tension between them, with Sulayman and another of Jazzar’s mamluks - Salim Pasha al-Saghir - who intended to rebel against Jazzar Pasha.\n\nJazzar Pasha and Sulayman Pasha later made up and with Jazzar’s passing, the Ottomans appointed Ibrahim Pasha Qataraghasi as Jazzar's replacement as the Governor of Sidon and Damascus. Ibrahim as Jazzar’s replacement, laid a siege on Acre which had been taken over in opposition to the Ottoman Sublime Porte, by an officer known as Isma’il (who was imprisoned by Jazzar).\n\nWith the impending arrival of the Hajj (January 1805 CE), he withdrew and left Sulayman in charge due to his responsibilities for the Hajj Caravan. The Osmanlis (Ottomans) later then appointed Sulayman as Governor of the Sidon Eyalet, and he resumed the siege efforts against Ismail to which he was successful.\n\nThis successful siege is the origins of what can be termed as the Mamluks of Acre; in fact, Sulayman in one of his first actions as Governor, re-established much of the mamluk household of his mentor Jazzar Pasha, which ironically had disintegrated with the rebellion he himself had an important role in instigating.\n\nMoreover, with his success in the siege, his reputation grew with the Ottoman Sublime Porte. He was eventually also given the authority of much of what is modern south-western Palestine (the cities of Gaza {Gazza}, Jaffa {Yafa} and Jerusalem {Al Quds}).\n\nIn the book, “The Mamluks in Egyptian and Syrian Politics and Society”, Sulayman al-Adil was said to have presided over the last ever functioning mamluk system.\n\nWith the death of Sulayman and the end of his reign in 1809 CE, Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali or simply Abdullah Pasha, succeeded him and also ruled from the city of Acre (like his predecessors Jazzar Pasha and Sulayman Pasha), whilst continuing the “Mamluks of Acre”.\n\nHe would rule from 1809 to 1831/1832 CE when he was defeated by Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt, and with his fall meant the end of the final ever mamluk dynasty in history.\n\nWho were the Mamluks of Egypt & Syria?\n\nThe most famous of all mamluk dynasties is the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt & Syria (Salṭanat al-Mamālīk), also known as the “Dawlat al-Atrāk” or “Turkic State” and “Dawlat al-Jarākisa or the “Circassian State”.\n\nThis dynasty were the protectorates of the Abbasid Caliphs for over 2 centuries (after the Mongol sacking of Baghdad in 1258 CE), whereby the Abbasid Caliphs were symbolic figures under the Mamluks (Abbasid Caliphate of Cairo), from the year 1261 CE until the dynasty (then a shadow of their former selves) fell to the Ottomans in 1516/1517 CE.\n\nThey also served the Muslim world by defeating the Mongols - who were then on route to approaching the noble cities of Makkah, Madinah & Jerusalem - at the famous Battle of Ain Jalut/Ayn Jalut on 3rd September 1260 CE (25 Ramadan 658 AH); the series Dirilis Ertugrul is set in the time period just before this battle occurs and we see Ertugrul contemplating working with the Mamluk Sultan Baybars (though this is fictional).\n\nThe Bahri Dynasty/Bahriyya Mamluks (1250-1382 CE):\n\nThe Bahri Dynasty (al-Mamalik al-Baḥariyya) of the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt & Syria was said to have reigned from the Mamluk State’s inception in 1250 CE to the year 1382 CE (132 years).\n\nIt was under this period/dynasty of the Mamluks of Egypt & Shaam, that the Muslims were able to overcome the scourge of the Mongols (the aforementioned Battle of Ain Jalut), and it is also this dynastic period that is being referred to in Dirilis Ertugrul (and specifically, Sultan Baybars, as I mentioned above).\n\nFrom their line of Sultans, Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun was the longest reigning Sultan with three (3) separate reigns: 1293-1294 CE; 1299-1309 CE and 1310-1341 CE.\n\nSultan Al-Nasir Muhammad also fought in battles against the Mongol Ilkhanate/Mongol Ilkhanids, then under the reign of Ghazan Khan who was said to have become Muslim and who was rebuked in person by the famous scholar Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimullah) for launching invasions on Muslim territories.\n\nGhazan Khan was the great-grandson of Hulagu Khan, the founder of the aforementioned Mongol Ilkhanate (a khanate within the Mongol Empire) and the grandson of Genghis Khan (Chingiz Khan). Hulagu was the one responsible for the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258 CE and the end of the Abbasid Caliphate (of Baghdad). Ghazan was said to have accepted Islam in 1295 CE.\n\nIn 1303 CE, the Mongol Ilkhanids under Ghazan and the Mamluks of Egypt & Shaam under An-Nasir Din Muhammad fought at was known as the Battle of Marj al Saffar, where the Mongols were decisively defeated and which put an end to the Mongol expansion into the Levant (Shaam).\n\nThese Bahriyya mamluks were brought over from the Kipchak/Qipchaq steppes north of the Black Sea to serve the Ayyubid Dynasty but eventually rose all the way to be the rulers themselves. The Kipchak/Cuman Turks were a Turkic nomadic people and confederation that existed in the Middle Ages, inhabiting parts of the Eurasian Steppe (said to have stretched through modern-day Hungary; Bulgaria; Romania; Moldova and Transnistria (breakaway state from Moldova); Ukraine; Western Russia; Siberia; Kazakhstan; East Turkestan (modern-day Chinese Xinjiang); Mongolia and Manchuria (encompassing the entirety of present-day Northeast China (Inner Manchuria) and parts of the Russian Far East (Outer Manchuria)).\n\nThe Bahriyya were a subset of what was known as the Salihiyya in the Ayyubid Dynasty; the Salihiyya were essentially royal mamluks who made up the personal guard of the Ayyubid Sultan al-Malik al-Salih Ayyub (reigned 1240-1249 CE), the nephew of the famous Salahuddin al-Ayyubi. From the Salihiyya you have what were elite corps of several hundred of selected horsemen known as the Bahriyya (Source: A History of the Islamic World, 600-1800 by Jo Van Steenbergen).\n\nTheir name \"Bahriyya\" means “of the river”, referring to the location of their original settlement on Al-Rawdah Island/Roda Island (Jazīrat ar-Rawdah): an island located on the Nile River in Cairo. The Bahriyya mamluks were housed there in the Al-Rawdah Castle which was commisioned by Ayyubid Sultan as-Salih Ayyub.\n\nFrom the Bahriyya and Salihiyya many emirs arose, thereby significantly increasing the mamluk influence within the Ayyubid power apparatus. In the end, these emirs from al-Malik al-Salih’s own entourage eventually usurped Ayyubid power after the death of al-Malik al-Salih.\n\nThe Ayyubid loss to the Crusaders at the Battle of Mansurah in 1250 CE (in modern-day Mansourah, Egypt) essentially made official the mamluk usurping of power as they now controlled the sultanate itself, despite the Crusaders not being able to properly make use of their victory.\n\nThis was a battle fought from 8 to 11 February 1250 CE, between the Crusaders led by Louis IX (King of France), and Ayyubid forces led by Sultana Shajar al-Durr (wife and then widow of as-Salih Ayyub) and her Vizier Fakhr ad-Din ibn al-Shaykh (who served as a diplomat to the father of as-Salih Ayyub and brother of Salahuddin: Sultan al-Kamil and) who died in this Battle of Mansurah).\n\nShajar al-Durr later married al-Malik al-Mu'izz Izz al-Din Aybak al-Jawshangir al-Turkmani al-Salihi or simply Izz al-Din Aybak (Emir Aybak), who then became Sultan Aybak: the first ever Mamluk Sultan and the first Sultan of the Bahri line of Mamluks, as Shajar al-Durr abdicated upon her marriage.\n\nThus, commenced the Mamluk State of Egypt & Syria and heralded the end of the Ayyubid Dynasty.\n\nBurji Dynasty/Circassian Mamluks (al-Mamalik al-Sherkes): 1382-1517 CE\n\nThe second phase of the Mamluk Sultanate was known as the Burji or Circassian Dynasty (Dawlat al-Jarākisa/al-Mamalik al-Sherkes), and it ruled from 1382 CE till the end of the Mamluk State in 1517 CE (135 years). The Burji Dynasty of the Mamluk Sultanate was of Caucasian/Circassian origins in contrast to the Bahri Dynasty which was of Turkic origins.\n\nCircassia (aka Cherkessia) was a historical region in the North Caucasus along the northeast shore of the Black Sea. It was conquered and occupied by Russia during the Russian invasion of Circassia which began in 1763 and which came into Russian occupation by 1864 CE. This resulted in much of the Circassian people either being exiled from the region or being massacred in what is known as the Circassian genocide.\n\nMany Circassians ended up moving to Istanbul/Constantinople, then part of the Ottoman Caliphate. Ottoman dynastic members around this time period also married people from Circassia and surrounding areas like Abkhazia. For example, Ottoman Sultan-Caliph Abdulhamid II was married to Bidar Kadin who was from Abkhazia, whilst his mother Tirimüjgan Kadın hailed from Circassia as well as his step-mother Rahime Perestu Sultan (the last ever Valide Sultan of the Ottoman Dynasty).\n\nIn 1377 CE, a revolt broke out in modern-day Syria and spread all the way to Egypt and by 1382 CE, the Circassians Al-Malik Az-Zahir Sayf ad-Din Barquq (Barquq) and Barakah took over the Mamluk government whereby Barquq was proclaimed the new Mamluk Sultan. This ended the Bahri line of Mamluk Sultans (a total of 25 Sultans) and heralded the beginning of the Burji/Circassian line of Mamluk Sultans.\n\nTheir reign was not straight smooth-sailing though as it was interrupted twice. First, in 1389 CE by the last ever Bahri Mamluk Sultan - Al-Salih Salah Zein al-Din Hajji II or Hajji II - whose first reign as Mamluk Sultan was ended by the Burji Dynasty itself in 1382 CE, after the aforementioned revolt that spread all the way to Egypt.\n\nSultan Hajji II though only managed to rule for a brief period of time (in 1389 CE) before falling hostage to Sayf ad-Din Barquq, who then began his second reign as Mamluk Sultan (1390-1399 CE).\n\nThe second time the Burji Mamluk reign was disrupted was by the Abbasids themselves, who for the vast majority of their ‘reign’ under the Mamluks (both Bahri & Burji) were ceremonial and symbolic rulers.\n\nThat is until Abu’l-Fadl Abbas Al-Musta'in Billah: the 10th Abbasid Caliph of Cairo. Al-Musta’in Billah who was Caliph from 1406 CE to 1414 CE, reigned as Mamluk Sultan for a short period of 6 months in 1412 CE. The previous Mamluk Sultan, Al-Nasir Faraj/Nasir-ad-Din Faraj aka Faraj ibn Barquq (son of the aforementioned Mamluk Sultan Barquq) was defeated during his campaign in the Levant against rebellious amirs/emirs (governors) of Aleppo and Tripoli, and this resulted in chaos within the Mamluk domains.\n\nFaraj was forced to surrender his position as Sultan and after differing amongst themselves, the various Mamluk officals anointed Al-Musta’in as Sultan.\n\nAl-Musta’in though was reluctant to accept this offer and only agreed after having obtained assurance from the Mamluks that he would retain his position as Caliph in the event that he was deposed as Sultan.\n\nThis assurance was not kept though, and after realising the extent that Al-Musta’in was going to secure and enforce his position as Sultan, he was not only deposed as Sultan but replaced as Caliph. This in effect is viewed as a failed attempt to initiate an Abbasid revival.\n\nThe Mamluks of Shaam & Misr (Levant & Egypt) would thereby rule until 1516/1517 CE when they were defeated by the Ottomans (during the reign of Sultan Selim I) in the Battle of Marj al-Dabiq in August 1516 CE, resulting in much territorial loss in the ‘Middle East’ for the Mamluk State.\n\nThe Ottomans would later take the Mamluk captial city of Cairo in January 1517 CE. The Ottomans and Mamluks had tense relations and even conflict some many years prior and the Ottomans came to view the Mamluks as problematic, as they felt they were far too friendly with the Shia Safavid Dynasty who were initiating rebellions in Ottoman territories (both a geopolitical and religious threat since the Ottomans were orthodox Sunni Muslims).\n\nSultan Selim himself marched on Ottoman Istanbul some years prior (1512 CE) and (peacefully) deposed his father - Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II - as he believed his father did not properly recognise nor put into action anything meaningful to deal with the Safavids.\n\nWith the opening (conquest) of much of the Middle East/Western Asia in 1516/1517 CE, this immediately made the Ottoman State into a majority-Muslim state as its initial territories lay in much of Southern Europe/the Balkans, which meant the early Ottoman State was a majority-Christian state (much of its inhabitants were not Muslim). This fact of the citizenry of the Ottoman State also disproves/disproved the idea that Muslims had spread and forced Islam onto peoples by the sword.\n\nWith the Ottomans taking Cairo and other major Muslim cities like Makkah, Madinah, Jerusalem & Damascus, this not only ended the Mamluk Dynasty but ended the Abbasid Caliphate of Cairo and heralded the Caliphate of the Ottomans, and thus, Sultan Selim I (the 9th Ottoman Sultan) became the first ever Ottoman Caliph and would also be known as Ottoman Sultan-Caliph Selim I.\n\nAnd though the Mamluk State had collapsed, the Uthmani Khilafah retained the Mamluks as an Egyptian ruling class and so the Burji Mamluks retained some of their influence, though as vassals of the Ottomans.\n\nWho was Mamluk Sultan Baybars?\n\nAl-Malik al-Zahir Rukn al-Din Baybars al-Bunduqdari or al-Salihi - or more commonly known as Baybars/Baibars - was the fourth Sultan of the Bahri Dynasty of the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt & Syria.\n\nHe was of Turkic Kipchak origin (born around the year 1223 CE and died in July 1277 CE (Muharram 676 AH), in Damascus, modern-day Syria) and succeeded the famous al-Malik al-Muzaffar Sayf ad-Din Qutuz or simply Qutuz: the Mamluk Sultan who presided over the famous and now oft-mentioned Battle of Ain Jalut (of which Baybars presided as a commander).\n\nThere is debate amongst historians about Baibar’s exact birthplace, with some claiming he was born north of the Black Sea, in Crimea; others claiming he was born in the Steppe of the Kipchaks (located today between the Volga and Ural rivers in modern-day Russia), whilst modern-day Kazakhstan is also touted as another possible location.\n\nAs it pertains to Sultan Qutuz, he himself was said to be a Turkic Prince from Persia who ended being captured by the Mongols during the fall of the Khwarazmian Dynasty. He was later taken to Damascus and was sold to an Egyptian merchant, who then later sold him to the aforementioned Izz al-Din Aybak (Sultan Aybak).\n\nAccording to some sources, Qutuz claimed that his original name was Mahmud ibn Mamdud and that he descended from the penultimate Khwarazmian Sultan Ala ad-Din Muhammad II (father of Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu mentioned above).\n\nIn his native Turkic language, Baybars’ name is said to mean “great panther”. Baybars was described as a tall man with a powerful voice, and had broad shoulders; slim legs; blue eyes and olive skin (Reference: The Enclyopedia of Islam via Brill).\n\nWithin the Kipchak ethnic group (group of Turkic nomads and pastoralists that lived in the Eurasian Steppe), Baybars belonged to the Barli tribe. Due to invading Mongol armies - during Baybars’ childhood - they settled within the domains of the Second Bulgarian Empire (medieval Bulgarian state that existed between 1185 and 1422 CE).\n\nThis migration apparently did not save the Barli Tribe from the invading Mongol armies and Baybars was said to have witnessed the killing of both of his parents at the hands of said Mongols around the year 1242 CE. Logically, this incident created resentment within Baybars for the Mongols.\n\nBaybars was then said to have been sold into slavery within the domains of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum (modern-day Turkiye).\n\nHe was then reportedly later purchased by a notable & wealthy Egyptian by the name of Ala al-Din Idikin al-Bunduqdari in modern-day Syria, who then brought him to Cairo.\n\nAround the year 1247 CE, Baybars came under the possession of Ayyubid Sultan al-Ṣāliḥ Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb (nephew of Salahuddin) after al-Bunduqārī was arrested.\n\nAnd thus, Baybars entered into the service of the Ayyubids - who as mentioned prior - had power taken from them from these ‘slave soldiers’ who became the Mamluks of Egypt & Syria.\n\nUnder the control of the Ayyubid Sultan, Baybars was sent to the aforementioned Al-Rawdah Island/Roda Island (Jazīrat ar-Rawdah) (island located on the Nile River in Cairo) to train for the Ayyubid army and be a part of the Salihiyya (personal guard of the Ayyubid Sultan). He quickly proved his skill and then quickly moved on to be head of the Salihiyya.\n\nHe was also said to have fought in the Ayyubid army during the victorious Battle of Hiribya (Battle of La Forbie) in 1244 CE (The Sixth Crusade). This Ayyubid victory was said to have also led to the call for the Seventh Crusade led by King Louis IX of France (the Seventh Crusade also came to be known as Crusade of Louis IX to the Holy Land).\n\nPost the Battle of Hiribya, Baybars quickly rose through the ranks and showed his skill in battle. He ended becoming a military commander of the Ayyubid army and was the chief military commander at the aforementioned Battle of Mansurah against King Louis IX’s army in 1250 CE.\n\nBaybars later got involved in the political side of things and was said to have played a role in the Mamluk overthrowing of the Ayyubid Dynasty.\n\nThere is difference of opinion but it is speculated that Baybars was the one who killed Qutuz. This occurred post-Ain Jalut because even though the Battle of Ayn Jalut did not ultimately end Mongol intervention into modern-day Syria, it was a psychological win for the Muslim psyche.\n\nIt put an end to the feeling of Mongol invisibility; it also sent a message beyond the borders of modern-day Syria and simultaneously brought much respect to those involved in the aforementioned battle, particularly the various commanders, etc, (with Baybars being one of them).\n\nWith this new-found appreciation and respect, many of the Mamluk commanders expected great rewards, but there was a sentiment of Qutuz showing favouritism to certain individuals, and with Baybars not given rule of Aleppo and many others disappointed with Qutuz, it was said they planned to depose Qutuz.\n\nFollowing Qutuz’s passing, Baybars was named as his successor, particularly by those who felt favourable towards him, and so Baybars came to the Mamluk Sultanic office on 17 Dhul Qa’dah, 658 AH / 24 October, 1260 CE in Cairo.\n\nSultan Baybars is also regarded as the architect of the imperial nature of the Mamluk State. He spent his early years of ruling by enlarging the Mamluk military insitution and was said to have doubled if not tripled the cavalry troops who had served his predecessor Qutuz.\n\nBaybars did try to promote a dynastic succession to the Mamluk State by selecting his young son Berke as co-sultan but the various senir amirs dimissed Berke and reverted back to the methodology of merit and negotiation.\n\nBaybars during his own reign though managed to navigate these senior amirs - who very much regarded themselves as coequals with rights to control over the state & its assets - and solidified his position as Sultan and stabilised the Mamluk State.\n\nAs it pertains to foreign policy, he was also quite shrewd in his approach to various external powers, both Muslim & non-Muslim.\n\nPost-Ain Jault, he does not immediately set out to exploit the Mamluk victory against the Mongol Ilkhanids but instead proposes a form of coexistence with the Mongols, possibly and very likely to halt any possible collusion between the Mongols and European powers.\n\nSimulatenously, Baybars also allowed and gave refuge to Mongols who rebelled against the Ilkhanids due to internal disputes and/or rivalries. These Mongol figures would end up figuring prominently in Mamluk politics, both at that time and in the future.\n\nIt was also under Baybars’ reign that one of the Abbasids’ descendants - Abul Qasim Ahmad who claimed to be an uncle of the last Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad - who escaped the Mongol sacking of Baghdad in 1258 CE, came to Cairo to seek refuge.\n\nAbul Qasim Ahmad was hereby in 1261 CE appointed as Abbasid Caliph (though was just a ceremonial position) and thus began the Abbasid Caliphate of Cairo.\n\nThough they had little power, these Abbasid Caliphs lended much legitimacy to the Mamluk State and also rested the angst amongst the ordinary folk as there was some sentiment on the ground that the Mamluks had overthrown a legimate dynasty (i.e. Ayyubids).\n\nMamluk dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean also began as a result of the reign of Baybars as well as simultaneously reinforcing the union of modern-day Egypt & Syria (started from the Ayyubids). This solidified Mamluk power in the region as the most powerful Muslim state, and the aforementioned Abbasid revival (so to speak) under the Mamluks, was very much an icing on the cake.\n\nDomestically, he also brought increased prosperity to Mamluk society. Professor Ovamir Anjum in his talk titled “What is Ummatics” at Cambridge University (for the Cambridge University Islamic Society), mentions that post the Mongol sacking of Baghdad and the Battle of Ayn Jalut, “the Mamluk period became - oddly and strangely, but surely - one of the most productive periods of Islamic scholarship” ranging from Islamic theology, Islamic legal thought, Islamic jurisprudence & Islamic history.\n\nHis reign from a military perspective also paved the way for the end of the Crusader presence in the Levant (Shaam). His skill in knowing when to employ the military and when to emply diplomacy also helped greatly in expanding the domains of the Mamluk Sultanate.\n\nBelow are a list of some military campaigns that Baybars participated in (before & after coming to the Sultanate):\n\nThe Battle of Ayn Jalut: In September 1260 CE, Baibars was a commander in the Mamluk army who were victorious against the Mongol Ilkhanids at the famous and now oft-repeated Battle of Ain Jalut, near Al Quds (Jerusalem), during the reign of Sultan Qutuz.\n\nOpening of Crusader strongholds: Baybars & the Mamluks opened many cities - between 1263 to 1271 CE - of Crusader strongholds in the region:\n\n– The Opening of Arsuf in 1265 CE:\n\nThe opening of Arsuf by the Mamluks and the surrender of the city by the Knights Hospitalers in 1265 CE\n\n– The Opening of Safed in 1266 CE:\n\nIn July 1266 CE, Sultan Baybars opened the town of Safed from the Knights Templars in July 1266 CE. Safed had been opened by Sultan Salahuddin in 1188 CE, but the Kingdom of Jerusalem took back the town in 1240 CE.\n\n– Mamluk opening of Cilician Armenia and Akka (Acre):\n\nLater in 1266 CE, Sultan Baibars opened Cilician Armenia from the Mongols. Sultan Baybars had also opened and gained control over the city of Akka (Acre) by the following year.\n\n– Opening of Antakiyah (Antioch) and Yafa (Jaffa):\n\nBaibars opened Antakiyah (Antioch) and Yafa (Jaffa) in 1268 CE. He thereafter also opened Asqalan (Ashkelon/Ashqelon) on and Qisarya (Caesarea) soon after.\n\n– Final actions against the Crusaders:\n\nBy the end of 1271 CE, the Crusaders had been effectively defeated by the Mamluks, and they would not take back any of the lands opened by Sultan Baybars during his lifetime.\n\nMamluk opening of Hashhashin strongholds:\n\nBy 1273 CE, Sultan Baybars was said to have eliminated Hashhashin presence from modern-day Syria. The Hashhashin or Order of Assassins were a sub sect of Nizari Shiism founded by Hassan Sabbah, and were known for making numerous assassinations.\n\nBattle of Elbistan against the Mongol Ilkhanids in 1277 CE:\n\nSultan Baybars’ main priority was to ensure the Mongol armies were kept out of the region and hence his alliance with Berke Khan of the Mongols of the Golden Horde.\n\nIn April 1277 CE, Baybars and the Mamluks met and were victorious against the Mongol Ilkhanids in Anatolia (Mongol-controlled Seljuk Sultanate of Rum) at Elbistan (Albistan).\n\nSultan Baybars reigned for around 17 years (1260-1277 CE) with his passing in Damascus in 1277 CE (Allah have mercy on him). He was buried under the dome of the Al Zahiriyyah Library (Madrasa al-Zahiriyya): an Islamic library, madrasah and mausoleum.\n\nSultan Baybars also had construction of a masjid/mosque begin in 1267 CE which came to be known as the Mosque/Masjid of al-Zahir Baybars (located in Cairo, modern-day Egypt.\n\nSultan Baibars had the construction of the mosque administered by his Vizier/Wazir Ali bin Muhammad bin Sadid el-Din bin Muslim bin Hanna bin Bahaa el-Din Abu el-Hasan el-Masry or commonly known as Bahaa el-Din bin Hanna.\n\nBahaa el-Din bin Hanna was the last Vizier of the Ayyubid Dynasty and later went on to serve the Mamluk Dynasty in the same capacity. It was during Sultan Baybars’ reign that Bahaa el-Din really rose to prominence and came to be known as one of the most powerful & influential figures within the Mamluk State and society.\n\nThe great scholar of Shafi’i fiqh (Shafi’i jurisprudence) who was known as Sultan al-Ulama - Izz ad-Din Abdul Aziz bin Abdus Salam al-Sulami al-Shafi’i - praised Bahaa el-Din for his decisiveness and righteousness.\n\nThe Mamluks, Sultan Baybars & Dirilis Ertugrul\n\nDirilis Ertugrul has very few mentions of the Mamluks or Sultan Baybars but we see some brief mentions of both in Season 5 in the context of war against Mongols, and this is definitely a historical reality.\n\nSeason 5 of Dirilis Ertugul itself was set in the time period of around 10 years after the Battle of Kose Dag in 1236 CE between the Seljuks of Rum and the Mongol Ilkhanids, and so Mongol presence was definitely in Anatolia and threatening the stability of Muslim lands south of Anatolia (Damascus, Aleppo, etc).\n\nIn Bolum/Episode 128 (Season 5 Episode 7), we see Ertugrul Bey meeting with the secret White Beards organisation. In this meeting, Ertugrul Bey puts forward the idea of building an alliance between Berke Khan of the Golden Horde and Sultan Baybars of the Mamluks."
