This was not completed during his reign and his son (Muhammad 'Ali Shah) took up the project in his second regnal year in order to pay respects to his father's good name, who had initiated the project. A colophon at the end gives the information that this Shahnama was ordered by Muzaffar al-Din Shah with Husayn Pasha Khan Amir Bahadur Jang the keshik-bashi in charge of its production, 'Ali Khan Arshad al-Dawlah as the superintendent, Mawbad 'Abd al-'Ali Kashani as the inspector, copied by Muhammad Husayn 'Imad al-Kuttab and printed in the Print House of Sayyid Murtaza in Tehran and dated AH 1319/AD 1901-02.\n\nThere is a preface in verse in praise of Muhammad 'Ali Shah and the production of the Shahnama composed by Adib al-Mamalik Muhammad Sadiq al-Husayni ends with text in prose mentioning various names involved in the project.
