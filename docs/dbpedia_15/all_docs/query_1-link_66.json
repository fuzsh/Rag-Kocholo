        "text": "During this pandemic lockdown, I’ve got hooked on watching RTP’s ‘Joker’, a quiz game show obviously inspired by ‘Who Wants to be a Millionaire’, a fun way to learn or brush up on one’s Portuguese and pick up some trivia too.\n\nA question in a recent episode highlighted a diplomatic gift from the Estado da Índia to Portugal in 1515.\n\nGifts of exotic creatures as a form of diplomacy are found throughout history and persist today, with China’s panda diplomacy, a good contemporary example.\n\nThe 1515 living gift to D. Manuel I was a rhinoceros, named ‘Genda’ (‘Ganda’ in some Portuguese descriptions) which apparently is Gujarati for ‘rhinoceros’.\n\nA year earlier, Afonso de Albuquerque began negotiations with Sultan Muzaffar Shah II of Cambay to build a fort on the island of Diu. Although the permission wasn’t granted, diplomatic gifts were exchanged, among them poor Genda.\n\nGenda and its Indian keeper (called ‘Ocem’ in Portuguese accounts) sailed aboard the ‘Nossa Senhora de Ajuda’ (Our Lady of Help) from Goa in January 1515.\n\n120 days later (quite a short trip for those times), Genda stepped ashore in Lisbon, close to where the iconic Torre de Belém was still being constructed. Genda is immortalized as gargoyles shaped as rhinoceros heads under its corbels.\n\nGenda is even more famous as ‘Dürer’s rhinoceros’ after the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer made a woodcut of it, without having actually seen the animal himself, and which though (unsurprisingly), anatomically inaccurate became a much-studied, copied and reproduced work of art.\n\nA rhinoceros hadn’t been seen in Europe “since Roman times”, so Genda created quite a stir, recalling tales of that mythical one-horned creature, the unicorn.\n\nGenda was lodged in Lisbon’s Paço da Ribeira (Ribeira Palace). On Trinity Sunday (the first Sunday after Pentecost) 1515, a ‘fight’ was arranged between Genda and an elephant in the royal menagerie, to test the trope going back to ancient Greece (Pliny the Elder, to be precise) that the two species were ‘bitter enemies.’ While Genda advanced, the elephant, unused to the fuss and noise, backed off.\n\nSome of the ‘inaccuracies’ in Dürer’s woodcut may refer to the possibility that Genda was outfitted with purpose-built armour for this elephantine encounter. Alternatively, the skin texture may reflect dermatitis that Genda suffered during the cramped living quarters during the voyage from Goa.\n\nSadly, there was more grief in store. D. Manuel had the bright idea of gifting Genda to the Medici Pope Leo X, who had greatly appreciated an earlier gift of an Indian elephant (Hanno). So in December 1515, Genda was fitted with a flower-bedecked green velvet collar and put out to sea again. A stopover was made at Marseille on 24 January 1516 at the request of King Francis I of France, who wished to see Genda. Upon a resuming the voyage, a sudden storm wrecked the ship, and Genda, chained and shackled on deck, couldn’t swim to safety and drowned. (There is no mention of the fate of the Indian keeper Ocem, who presumably accompanied Genda). The carcass was retrieved and stuffed, and may have made it to Rome, although this is uncertain. A contemporary painting by Raphael does depict a rhinoceros.\n\nAnother rhinoceros wouldn’t be seen again in Europe until six decades later, again a ‘gift’ from India. Abada (also Bada or Ibada, apparently derived from ‘Badak’, the Malay for rhinoceros and thought to be in use from around 1530 for the animal in the Iberian peninsula) was a female rhinoceros, a gift from the viceroys of Estado da Índia in 1577 to the then king of Portugal Sebastian I.\n\nAs a safety precaution, the horn would be sawn off periodically, would grow back and need removing each time.\n\nAfter the untimely death of Sebastian in 1578, Abada became the property of Henry I. Upon the latter’s demise in 1580, Philip II of Spain transferred Abada from Lisbon first to the menagerie of Casa de Campo, close to Madrid and three years later to the menagerie of El Escorial.\n\nA well-intentioned attempt by Abada’s keepers to ‘refresh’ her by pouring buckets of water startled her so much that she knocked down everyone around her.\n\nAbada became an attraction to visiting dignitaries as well as the general public, and again, drew allusions to the unicorn. There is also a curious account of King Philip playing a ‘joke’ on the monks at El Escorial, of having Abada sent up the monastery steps and into their cells. It doesn’t elaborate how well the ‘joke’ was received by the monks.\n\nShe doesn’t seem to have tolerated captivity well, often being “stubborn” and refusing food. There are suggestions that she may even have been blinded, apparently so her keepers would not be attacked by her. The probable year of her death is given as 1588.\n\nJust as Genda is memorialised at the Torre de Belém in Lisbon, Abada has a street in the heart of Madrid named after her. The story goes that a rhinoceros (most likely Abada) on display at a fair on land belonging to the Monastery of San Martin went into a panic, killing a little boy and was at large in the city for a week before being subdued. A cross was erected where the boy lost his life, and after the priory land was sold, the street built there got its name.\n\nThe historical accounts depict Genda and Abada as curiosities, as the playthings of monarchs, impressive symbols of imperial power. But between those lines, written centuries ago, what also comes across is the trauma and cruelties they endured, the price they paid for their perceived exoticism.\n\n(An edited version of this article was published on 06 January 2022 in my column ‘On the Upbeat’ in the Navhind Times Goa India)"
