        "text": "By Sylvia Matheson\n\nA hasty meal in the dining room, and off we set for Lashkar Gah. The immense, burnt-brick walls surrounding palace after palace, and th courtyards, baths, mosques and now empty pools stretched for mile after mile along the banks of the Helmand River.\n\nThe palace had been a city in itself, the home of thousands of warriors: and their families. Looking now from the wide battlements to the rounding desert countryside, it was hard to imagine that only a thousand years ago this had been a thickly-populated and fertile area.\n\nI looked down on the Turkish baths with their elaborate hot-water system, through delicately arched doorways to enchanting views of the river; I wandered through secluded courtyards, walls of which had once been hung with cool turquoise and blue tiles.\n\nIn the vast banqueting hall with its three main niches set in the walls, the raised platforms once adorned with colorful tiles, Firdausi the Persian poet laureate had sung his glorious songs before the Sultan and won a gold piece for every golden line.\n\nThese palaces built, by Subuktagin in A.D. 976 when he had seized the fortress of Bust, had once been the center of the civilized Eastern world.\n\nLater on, Sultan Mahmud ‘Mahmud of Ghazni”, the “Destroyer of Idols, whose rule had extended from Turkestan to the Indian Ocean, and from Hamadan in Persia to Lahore in India, the Great Mahmud himself had made Ghazni and Bust the treasure houses of the vast booty he had wrenched from his many expeditions into India. At the same time, he had filled these rich halls with the pick of Oriental culture the finest musicians, dancers and poets that his world knew.\n\nAs I wandered through the two Iwans, vast halls open on one side, I could visualize the immense concourse of cager listeners to the competitions held for classical musicians and poets from Persia and India.\n\nIn the luxurious steam baths, Sultan Mahmud must have lounged at his case while feasting his eyes on the views through the cunningly contrived miradors looking over the wide river bed, lush orchards, and parks.\n\nUntil recently it has been believed that Islam has always banned any representation of the human figure in art, but Dr. Schlumberger’s discovery of some fifty enormous, full-length paintings of warriors marching round the walls of the Hall of Audience at Lashkar Gah, seemed to disprove this theory.\n\nNow it is accepted that in the early days of Islam there was no such prohibition imposed on artists sculptors.\n\nCommenting on his spectacular find, Dr. Schlumberger pointed out the startling similarities between these and the huge figures adorning the palace walls at Susa—possibly those of Lashkar Gah were also portraits of Mahmud’s Royal Bodyguard?\n\nThis then was the place of which poets sang, “Oh, King, human eye has not seen throughout the world a place more beautiful than this!”\n\nThis lovely palace surrounded by orchards and flower gardens was one of the wonders of the ancient world, and it is the area from whence the Zoroastrians expect a new Saviour of the World.\n\nNotes\n\nThis passage is from Sylvia Matheson’s book Time off to Dig Mundigak - An Afghan Aventure published in 1961.\n\nSylvia Matherson (1916-2006) was a journalist, photographer, and archeologist.\n\nScholars attribute the palace to the Ghaznavid Empire (977 - 1150) and later the Ghurid Empire.\n\nLocated to the north of Bust on the banks of the Helmand River in Afghanistan, Daniel Schlumberger excavated the site between 1949 - 1952 with DAFA (French Afghan Archaeological Mission).\n\n[caption: Plan of the palace by Daniel Schlumberger]\n\n[caption: Exterior view of South Palace from southwest]\n\nIllustration by Solaimon Olumee\n\nWords by Farhad Azad\n\nFrom the 2001 Issue of Aftaab Magazine\n\nShortly after the news of this historical loss broke, the Kabul born artist Solaimon Olumee illustrated the bombing of the giant Buddha of Bamiyan, symbolizing the wrecking of Afghanistan itself.\n\nThe giant Buddhas were cut from the side of a mountain in Bamiyan during the 3rd or 4th centuries AD. The patrons were the Kushan kings whose empire “had a great variety of religious practices and cults in existence within the Kushan Empire, from which its kings could choose elements at will.”\n\nThe taller one, 175 feet tall, was thought to be the world’s tallest standing Buddha.\n\nBoth briefly surveyed into this century. However, not for long. The statues were destroyed using heavy explosives by the Taliban in March 2001.\n\nOn the 4th of March 2001, the Taliban’s Minister Quadratullah Jamal said, \"The head and legs of the Buddha statues in Bamian were destroyed yesterday. Our soldiers are working hard to demolish their remaining parts. They will come down soon. We are using everything at our disposal to destroy them.“ (Washington Post Article )\n\nThe Taliban leadership’s main reasoning in destroying the statues was the lack of “respect” for the people of Afghanistan by the international community who sought to give preservation aid for the statues, ”[international community] have no regard for thousands of living human beings - the Afghans who are dying\".\n\nYet at that time, the Taliban failed to note in January 2001, they conducted genocide on the people of Bamiyan. The Wall Street Journal (Nov. 16, 2021, “Afghanistan’s Shiite Minority Cautiously Embraces Taliban Rule, Seeking Protection”) wrote, “Going house to house in January 2001, Taliban fighters rounded up hundreds of men in this Shiite town and nearby villages. Then they executed their captives, leaving piles of bodies in the snow-covered fields.”\n\nNow 18 years later, the Taliban have been granted direct access to the United States government for peace talks. Most people are worried about the prospect of a second return of the Taliban to take over the entire country.\n\nThe broken heart of Bamiyan has slowly mended. The people are hoping it continues to heal."
