        "text": "Tehran Union House\n\nHouse of Tehran Union is one of the architecture samples of Qajar era. The Union House of Tehran was registered as one of Iran's national monuments in 2005 under registration number 12057. But in recent years, due to the negligence of officials of the Cultural Heritage Organization,\n\nIran's Administrative Justice Court has removed this historical house in Iran from the list of national monuments. But now the Islamic City Council of Tehran has voted urgently on a plan by the Tehran municipality to take possession of and rebuild the Tehran Union House to determine its fate. The Union House, formerly known as Amin al-Sultan's House, often known as John Napoleon's Uncle's House (because it was John Napoleon's Uncle Serial House location). You can get to this old guesthouse in Iran from both Ferdowsi Street and Lalezar.\n\nThe Tehran Union House was built in consultation with French architects for about the first three decades of the present century. Of course, during the years 1300-1310 this building was the residence of \"Qavam al-Saltanah\". However, after that time, the building was re-used by the original owner. Until about 30 years ago, this property was purchased by the Soviet Embassy and activated as a Cultural Association of Iran and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Tehran Union House is now at the disposal of the Blood Transfusion Organization and is free of charge.\n\nFollowing the victory of the Islamic Revolution, this traditional house in Iran was confiscated by the Mostafa Foundation and eventually purchased by the Blood Transfusion Organization in 1985 and since then it has been exploited as the \"Tehran Regional Educational Transfusion Base\". It is still being used as an administrative part of the site.\n\nAddress: Vesal Street, next to Taleghani Street, Enghelab Ave. Tehran\n\nShaghaghi House\n\nThis traditional house in Iran is located in the northernmost part of the twelve districts of Tehran, on the northern side of Fusari Street and Lalehzar Street. This traditional guesthouse in Iran is often known as the Koshak House. Shaghaghi's home was originally used as a residence for the Shaghaghi family and later became one of the educational centers of the country's cultural heritage organization after serving a short time as a local luxury hotel in Iran.\n\nIraqi Endowment Building\n\nLocated west of Ferdowsi Square, in Pars Alley, it is the home of former Iraqi Supreme Court Justice Fazel. Part of it was dedicated to the Women's Hospital in 1334. Tiles of exquisite mansion and on them pictures of ancient kings of Iran have been engraved.\n\nVosouq old house in Iran\n\nThe building was built in 1211 AD under the rule of Muhammad Shah Qajar for one of the Qajar era officials named \"Mirza Mohammad Qavam al-Dawlah Ashtiani\". The building is located on 15 Khordad Alley, \"Mirza Mahmoud Wazir\". Seven doors in this building is one of the decorations.\n\nImam Jomeh’s House\n\nLocated in the old texture area of Tehran, the famous house of Imam Jomeh is located on Nassarkhosro Street. As the name implies, this house belongs to one of the Imams of the Qajar era and may have been built in the middle of the reign of Nasser al-Din Shah in the years 1380-1802.\n\nMasoudieh Mansion\n\nMasoudieh mansion is one of the historic houses in Tehran, located on Republic Avenue, Baharestan, Mellat Ave., Ekbatan Ave. It was built in about 4000 square meters. The architect of this building was the master of architectural branches and its supervisor was Mirza Razagli Khani, known as Siraj al-Molk. It consists of two parts: inner and outer and other places. Massoudieh's mansion has witnessed many events since its construction until today. During the Constitutional Movement, due to the mansion's proximity to Baharestan Square and the dispute between Zalul Sultan and his brother (Muzaffar al-Din Shah) and his son, he was one of the constitutional strongholds and opponents of Muhammad Ali Shah.\n\nIn 1287, a car bomb exploded near Mohammad Ali Shah's carriage, which gave Mohammed Ali Shah an excuse to close the parliament.\n\nThe house is also important in many other respects, as many of the country's cultural buildings were erected. The first National Library and Museum of Iran was set up in part of the mansion; in about 1304, the Education Association, using one of the rooms of the mansion, established the first official library of the country, the primary basis of the National Library. A few years later, another mansion room was dedicated to ancient antiques obtained from around the country, in fact the first Iranian museum was established there, and in 1318, its’ antique objects were transferred to the National Museum.\n\nMasoudieh was used as an officer's school during the years 1342-1343. In 1345, Masoudieh was transferred to the Ministry of Education and the first Ministry of Education was there. It was separated from the Ministry of higher Education. Masoudieh Mansion hosted the 15th celebration of the Cinema House in 2011.\n\nThis work has been registered as a national monument in Iran under registration number of 2190."
