        "text": "4.5/5\n\nEccellente\n\nYYongAlexThe hotel entrance and lobby was beautiful and very welcoming. The vibe is truly peranakan baba vibe! Checking in and checking out was a breeze. Though staff don't really take initiative to greet and check on you but they are always very responsive and helpful when you make an inquiry or request. The hotel carpark is behind the hotel so you have to drive past the lane that leads you to the entrance of the hotel to go to the back of the hotel. Confusing at first. The location of the hotel is great though， less than 5 Mins walk to Jonker street and accessible to all the shops around the popular area. The hotel room looks exactly like the photo but the bedsheet was slightly dirty when we first arrived. After requesting a change of bedsheet it's still slightly dirty. Sound proof was bad. Everyday 8 am till evening they will play music and you can't really rest in peace during the day. There is a suntan pool *not a swimming pool* at the roof top but it is super under utilize. Maybe you can start gaze while soaking your feet in the shallow water. All in all a great short stay, but not recommended for a long stay.\n\nMostra di più\n\n4.5/5\n\nEccellente\n\nUUtente ospiteThis is a very new hotel which started their business in March 2023. Wanted to try on the first day of opening but due to some reason, it was delayed till now. It’s a first Marriott hotel in Melaka, so I do have very high expectations from them. As a Marriott platinum elite member, I’ve stayed in many hotel under Marriott organisation. Upon reaching the hotel with grab car, the staff came up to me immediately and lead me to the check in counter, the lobby are huge, and I can still smell that the hotel are still so new. Not much of the guest in the lobby area, it’s a Monday so I guess it’s normal. No suite room upgrade and no complimentary breakfast for a platinum member, although I was upgraded to a strait view room which I appreciated it. It can see a tiny bit of the sea. Apart from that, I guess the room size and amenity are the same. The check in staff told me that the suite room was full… I mean.. it’s a Monday.. and I literally still can see the suite room was available in the Bonvoy app. As I’ve mentioned, I’ve been to many hotel under Marriott organisation. I don’t always get upgraded to a suite room, but it was okay, I do understand all these are subjected to individual hotel policy and it’s all a good will. But I guess the staff could just tell me that the hotel are still new, the suite room are limited and it’s reserved for paying guest. I would totally understand that. But I don’t think it’s wise to you know, use a default replied as member like us, we check on the app. For me, if there’s no available suite room, I wouldn’t even ask for an upgrade. Secondly, there’s no complimentary breakfast, I paid RM70 for the 2 day breakfast. I’ve stayed in a few courtyard hotel, this was the first one that I’ve paid for breakfast, there might be other courtyard that don’t provide complimentary breakfast for guest with elite status, maybe I didn’t stay much enough to see it all. I’ve stayed with hotel that told me that their facility actually don’t offer complimentary breakfast for elite member, but they will just give it to me as a good will on top of my welcome gift. Just a little suggestion, like maybe let the counter staff to decide, if they could slip in some complimentary breakfast to guest with elite status or even guest that potentially come back again. I’m not complaining here, just some of my suggestions. The room are new, nice and spacious, very clean. Nice TV channel selection, view was great. Bed are firm to the level that I like, they offer pillow menu as well. Had very good sleep for the 2 night. Breakfast was very basic. There’s a very annoying flies flying around my table.. how did it come into the hotel, lol. Gym are small but there should be everything you need. The infinity pool are great! Very good view and very Instagrammable. Please visit the pool when you are here. The staff and friendly and nice. Would come back again to the hotel when I’m back in Melaka.\n\nMostra di più"
