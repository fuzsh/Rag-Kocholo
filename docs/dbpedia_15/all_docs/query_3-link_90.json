        "text": "Last Sunday, (2nd May 2010) while I was driving back to KL from Lumut, I decided to follow the Bota Kanan route. My intention was to visit the tombs of past rulers of Perak and of course my ancestor – Megat Terawis.\n\nRight after crossing the Sultan Idris Shah II Bridge in Bota, moving towards Ipoh, the tomb of Almarhum Sultan Muzaffar Shah III could be seen on the left hand side of the road. I stopped the car and took some pictures. I was surprised that bushes are all over the place as if no one bothered to clean the tomb. The pictures below explains my disappointment.\n\nThe newly-built gates can be seen clearly here with a brief write-up about the life of Almaruhum Sultan Muzaffar Shah III of Perak. Proceeding further to the tomb, thick bushes can be seen almost covering the tomb stones of this Sultan. Then I said to myself, this is a Sultan’s tomb situated right next to the main road connecting Bota and Ipoh. I wonder what would be the condition of the tombs of other Sultans of which I know that those tombs are situated far from the main road.\n\nI took a U-Turn and then head to Bota Kanan town. I remember that there are two Sultans intered there and the tombs are situated right in the town centre (behind the shop houses on the left hand side of the road towards Teluk Intan. The signage showing the direction to the tomb is clearly visible.\n\nSurprisingly, I can’t find the tomb! MashaAllah, the tombs were covered by thick bushes – thicker than the ones we have seen earlier. The worse part is, not only the tombs are covered by bushes, the entrance too is not visible. The path to the tomb is now a rubbish disposal point. How humiliating. People of Bota town, do you really know that the tomb existed!? To the Penghulu of Mukim Bota, your office is just next to the tomb. Have you done anything to remedy the situation?\n\nThat’s the fate of the tombs of two Sultans of Perak – Sultan Alauddin Shah and Sultan Ahmaddin Shah. I was so angry and drove directly to Pulau Tiga where the tomb of Megat Terawis is situated. Nearby, there were tombs of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Shah, Sultan Mahmud Iskandar Shah and his younger brother, Yang Dipertuan Muda Mansur Shah.\n\nDriving further towards the direction of the tomb, I realised that I was driving too far as the tomb was less than 500m from the signage. Then, I saw the tomb of Sultan Mahmud Iskandar Shah right next to the path. With no signage or write-up, one wouldn’t know whose tomb was it. The pictures below explains itself.\n\nAnd now to my disappointment, I reached the tomb of my ancestor – Megat Terawis. The condition is almost similar to the Sultans of Perak. Covered with bushes. Something must be done by respective family members because we definitely cannot rely on the authorities. They are just civil servants who happen to be attached to departments. If they were not told to act by their superiors, nothing will be done. The pictures I have displayed here shows that the authorities are not doing their job! As family members, we should act NOW!"
