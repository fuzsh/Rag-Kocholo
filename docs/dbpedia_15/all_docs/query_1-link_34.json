The domestic and foreign travelers are interested in the building of this palace due to the outstanding artistic and architectural features as a palace-museum. Currently, this museum contains objects and furniture of the commander most of them presented by Russia's ruler and court for his considerable influence on the area of Iran, especially in the tumultuous reign of Muzaffar al-Din Shah."
