        "text": "Located in the Laxmi Vilas Palace compound Navlakhi Vav is the only Vav (stepwell) in Vadodara (Baroda) city today and probably the only remnant of the Gurjar rule. A plaque on the Vav says it was built in Sultan Muzaffar Shahâ€™s time in the 15th century. The Vav was called Navlakhi because 9 lakh gold coins were supposed to have been spent to build it."
