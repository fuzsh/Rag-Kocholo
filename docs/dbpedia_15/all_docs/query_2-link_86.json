        "text": "Unknown\n\nAlthough massively late, I am so glad I stumbled upon this amazing historical piece, absolutely brilliant!\n\nI was wondering where exactly do you think this association of the Hindu Princess of Amer being the mother of Jahangir came about?\n\nWas there a specific traveller's account, or some other treatise?\n\nWould love to know your opinions on it!\n\nMaddy\n\nCome to think of it, James Tod writing his voluminous Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan was perhaps the first to touch upon Jodh Bai connections, around 1832 or thereabouts. Then there is Arthur Vincent Smith writing in 1917 about Akbar, who stated - At Deosa, midway between Agra and Ajmer, he received Raja Bihar Mall, the chief of Amber or Jaipur in Rajputana, who offered his eldest daughter to Akbar in marriage. The court made only a brief stay at Ajmir and returned by forced marches to Agra, leaving the heavy camp equipage to follow. The marriage was celebrated at Sambhar. Man Singh, nephew and adopted son of Raj Bhagwan Das, the heir of Raja Bihar Mall, was taken into the imperial service, and rose ultimately to high office. The bride subsequently became the mother of Jahangir. Her posthumous official title, Maryam-zamani (or -uz zamani), ' the Mary of the age ', has caused her to be confounded sometimes with Akbar's mother, whose title was Maryam-makani, ' dwelling with Mary '. The dust of Akbar's first Hindu consort lies in a fine mausoleum situated near Akbar's tomb at Sikandara. The building has been restored by judicious measures of conservation. Note - The daughter of Raja Bihar Mall probably conformed more or less to the Muslim religion, certainly she received a Muhammadan title and was buried in a Muhammadan sepulchre.."
