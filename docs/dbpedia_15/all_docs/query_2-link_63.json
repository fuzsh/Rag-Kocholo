        "text": "Shah Jahan was an emperor of the Mughal Empire during the first half of the seventeenth century. His grandfather was known as the Great Akbar, and from him, Jahar inherited great influence. He made many important contributions to the Mughal Empire and the world, including the creation of the Taj Mahal, which was primarily built as a tomb for himself and his wife. In addition to the architectural advancements of which the Taj Mahal is a part, Shah Jahan also influenced many cultural changes and shifts in the society of the Mughal Empire. His empire became angered with him, however, and he was imprisoned during his final years in Agra Fort.\n\nShah Jahan was instrumental in unifying the different regions of the Mughal Empire under the rule of the emperor. He brought the Deccan states into submission, and he also took some areas from the Persian Empire. Toward the end of his rule, the Persian Empire retook some of this area, but Jahan was still successful in expanding the empire as compared to what he inherited from his father.\n\nShah Jahan was born in 1592 in the city of Lahore in present-day Pakistan. For one to understand the early life of Shah Jahan, one must understand the structure and norms of the Mughal Empire at the time of his birth. There were many rebellions throughout the empire, and external forces such as the Persian Empire were fighting against it. This was further weakened by conflict within the royal family. During his childhood, Jahan's father rebelled against his grandfather and seized the throne that had already been promised to him. This established a precedent that was followed by Jahan's son who imprisoned him during the last few years of his life and took over the throne.\n\nShah Jahan's Family\n\nShah Jahan was born into a royal family and reaped the rewards of being associated with royalty. His family was well-cared for, and they had remarkable power and influence throughout the entire Mughal Empire. Shah Jahan was born in 1592 to the Mughal Emperor Jahangir and his wife Manmati. At the time of his birth, his grandfather, the Great Akbar, considered him to be the fulfillment of a prophecy that his wife, although childless, would raise an emperor. Shah Jahan had two older brothers, four older sisters, and eight younger siblings. Jahan was said to be the favorite son of the emperor, and his grandfather the Great Akbar was invested in his education.\n\nThe prestige of Shah Jahan's family continued with his own family. He had four wives and one consort, Mumtaz Mahal, who was his favorite wife. He also had many children. Among Shah Jahan's children, the most significant were:\n\nAurangzeb who was the next ruler of the Mughal Empire. He was one of the sons of Mumtaz Mahal.\n\nDara, the oldest son of Shah Jahan who was intended to be his heir and the successor to the throne.\n\nThe dynasty created by Shah Jahan presided over the downfall of the Mughal Empire, and Aurangzeb was executed shortly after he took the throne.\n\nShah Jahan's Influences and Education\n\nAs a member of the elite class of the Mughal Empire, Shah Jahan was given a broad education, and he had many intellectual influences. One of the most significant influences on the early life of Shah Jahan was his grandfather, the Great Akbar. Akbar was a prestigious leader and a respected war general who used his position as emperor to force his son to release his grandson into his care. He assisted the young Shah Jahan in gaining an effective education and prepared him to be the emperor after his father. His grandfather taught him about war, diplomacy, and how to lead a kingdom. Akbar's wife, Ruqaiya, taught Jahan about the codes of Islam and the importance of living a moral life. Shortly before his father's death, as Shah Jahan was wandering around the Mughal Empire, he learned about the various ways of life in his empire. This caused him to be significantly more conservative in his policies than his father and grandfather, but not as conservative as his son Aurangzeb.\n\nMeet Shah Jahan\n\nWhat would you do for love? How would you honor someone who has your heart and soul and can no longer be with you? The answer for Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan was to create one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. Let us take a journey to meet this emperor of the once-mighty Mughal Empire, learn a little about his life, and of course, the woman who inspired him.\n\nEarly Life\n\nPainting of Shah Jahan Astride a Horse\n\nShah Jahan was born in what is today Pakistan, in 1592 CE. His mother was a Rajputi princess named Manmati and his father was Prince Jahangir who became emperor after the death of Akbar the Great. Shah Jahan was not born with this name. His full name, however, was a real mouthful, Ala Azad Abul Muzaffar Shahab al-Din Muhammad Khurram. It is much easier to just refer to him as Prince Khurram, for the moment.\n\nPrince Khurram (Shah Jahan) spent much of his childhood hanging out with his grandfather, the Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great, one of the greatest emperors the Mughal Empire had ever seen. Akbar the Great took the young prince under his wing and gave him an eclectic education. This included learning about the Quran, military strategy and fighting, literature, and music.\n\nWhen Prince Khurram was old enough to go to battle, his father sent him to repress a rebellion. By this time his father was Emperor Jahangir and he was so impressed with Prince Khurram's performance that he gave him the name Shah Jahan, which means ''Glory of the World''.\n\nAt around nineteen-years-old, Shah Jahan married a Persian noblewoman named Arjumand Banu Begum, but most of the world knows her as Mumtaz Mahal, Shah Jahan's favorite wife. Mumtaz Mahal translates to ''Jewel of the Palace'' and she was, indeed, as precious as a jewel to Shah Jahan, whom she had been engaged to since she was fourteen and he fifteen.\n\nA Seated Mumtaz Mahal Wife of Shah Jahan being Administered to by a Servant\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1627 CE, Shah Jahan moved quickly to secure his right to rule by killing his male siblings and then focused on outside threats to his empire. Sadly, it was during one of these military campaigns that Shah Jahan lost his beloved Mumtaz Mahal. She was pregnant at the time with their fourteenth child and was accompanying him on his campaign when she went into labor. She died giving birth to their daughter, in 1631. Shah Jahan would go on to live another thirty-five years without the love of his life. During that time, he would continue with his military campaigns but as he got older his began to experience health issues.\n\nIn 1658 Shah Jahan was struck down by an illness and appointed his son Dara Shikoh to act in his place. Unfortunately, the other children were not happy with this choice, and another son, Aurangzeb, defeated his brother Dara Shikoh and his other brothers to become ruler. Even when Shah Jahan recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb refused to give up power and had his father imprisoned at Agra Fort. Shah Jahan remained locked away until his death in 1666 CE. He is buried in the Taj Mahal with his beloved Mumtaz.\n\nShah Jahan the Builder\n\nPart of Shah Jahan's legacy is his love of Mughal architecture and building which relied heavily on symmetry and balance. He built mosques including the Jama Masjid Mosque in Delhi and the Red Fort, also in Delhi. In Agra, he built mosques as well, but what Shah Jahan is most remembered for is the construction of the magnificent mausoleum complex known as the Taj Mahal."
