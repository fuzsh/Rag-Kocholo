        "text": "The Malacca Sultanate (Malay: Kesultanan Melaka; Jawi script: کسلطانن ملاک‎) was a Malay sultanate based in the modern-day state of Malacca, Malaysia. Conventional historical thesis marks c. 1400 as the founding year of the sultanate by King of Singapura, Parameswara, also known as Iskandar Shah,[1] although earlier dates for its founding have been proposed.[2][3] At the height of the sultanate's power in the 15th century, its capital grew into one of the most important transshipment ports of its time, with territory covering much of the Malay Peninsula, the Riau Islands and a significant portion of the northern coast of Sumatra in present-day Indonesia.[4]\n\nQuick Facts Sultanate of Malaccaکسلطانن ملاک‎Kesultanan Melaka, Capital ...\n\nClose\n\nAs a bustling international trading port, Malacca emerged as a centre for Islamic learning and dissemination, and encouraged the development of the Malay language, literature and arts. It heralded the golden age of Malay sultanates in the archipelago, in which Classical Malay became the lingua franca of Maritime Southeast Asia and Jawi script became the primary medium for cultural, religious and intellectual exchange. It is through these intellectual, spiritual and cultural developments, that the Malaccan era witnessed the establishment of a Malay identity,[5][6] the Malayisation of the region and the subsequent formation of the Malay world.[7]"
