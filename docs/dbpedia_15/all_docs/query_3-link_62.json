        "text": "A Visit to Malacca in 2002\n\nMalacca - the historic port of exchange\n\nof old West and Inter Asian trade\n\nA beginning in 1400\n\nThe history of Malacca began in the year 1400, when the Hindu prince Parameswara fled from his Javanese enemy and after having first landed at the island of Singapore, he then advanced up the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, to found himself a city. It was named Malacca after the Melaka trees, found abundant at the mouth of the river Bertam, i.e. here.\n\nNow Parameswaras happened to have founded his new city at a point of tremendous strategic importance. The city grew rapidly and within fifty years it had become a wealthy and powerful hub of international commerce, with a population of over 50,000.\n\nAdmiral Zhenghe visits Malacca in 1409\n\nThe early 15th century was also the time of the great Chinese interest in trade and international affairs. In 1403 the first official Chinese trade envoy lead by Admiral Yin Ching arrived in Malacca followed suite by the legendary Chinese Admiral Zhenghe, arriving in Malacca in 1409 on his first of seven voyages to the Indian Ocean.\n\nA counter visit to China in 1411\n\nAlready in 1411 Parameswara - or as he later changed his name to Raja Iskandar Shah - left his home with an entourage of 540, to pay tribute to the Ming Emperor Yung Lo.\n\nAfter a number of rapid successions Iskandar Shah's son's son's son Sultan Muzaffar Shah in 1456 promotes Tun Perak to become \"Bendahara\" or \"Prime Minister\". Under his competent hands Malacca prosper and rises to power in maritime Southeast Asia. In 1458 Sultan Mansur Shah succeeds Sultan Muzaffar Shah and sends Tun Perpateh Puteh as envoy to China, most likely to offer a friendly tribute to the then ruling emperor Tianshun (1457-64).\n\nBy this time the Neo-Confucian bureaucracy, who enjoyed an influence at the Ming court they never had under Yongle had put a stop the Chinas great explorations of the sea. Zhenghe's expeditions were called \"signs of fiscal madness\" while other advisors, steeped in Confucian ethics, had added that merchants accompanying Zhenghe were just \"parasites who wanted to make money out of others, and use sea trade as a way to avoid taxes imposed by the towns''.\n\nAlready in 1416 in China the north-south Grand Canal had been repaired to ensure that safe grain shipment from the south to the northern capital could be done by canal, instead of by sea. This had done away with the need for navy ships to protect grain shipments against raids by pirates. Near the end of 1420 the construction of the Imperial Palace in Beijing was basically completed and Beijing (North city) was then designated the \"first capital,\" and Nanjing (South city) the second. In 1421 the Ming Dynasty officially moved its capital to Beijing.\n\nIt is beyond me to tell if the Malaccan envoy actually knew this and thus managed, or bothered to, visit Beijing. Maybe they settled for a visit to the Ming relatives and merchants still living in Nanjing instead. In either case, the Malaccan envoy must have learnt that tribute or not - they were now on their own, deprived of the overwhelming military backup power of the Chinese Imperial fleet. So, history now takes a new turn.\n\nThe \"Ming Princess\" Hang Li Poh\n\nNo factual documents remains to confirm that this actually took place but tradition still maintain that much to Sultan Muzaffar Shahs great surprise the Tun Perpateh Puteh voyages back with the Chinese Princess Hang Li Poh as a return gift - and intended wife - to the Sultan.\n\nAccording to the legend Sultan Mansur Shah then probably re-composes his facial expression and invites the Chinese Princess with her \"five hundred youths and several hundred women attendants of noble descent who were sent along to wait on her and keep the princess company in her new home\" to settle down at the hill which to this day carries the name Bukit China.\n\nHang Li Poh's well\n\n\"Bukit China\" - The Chinese Hill\n\nIf we still without considering the truthfulness of the legend, I believe the graves of the Bukit China pretty well proves that a large group of Chinese established themselves here during Ming times.\n\nThe Peranakans - the \"local borns\"\n\nThe Europeans enters the scene\n\nA Famosa\n\nThe Dutch takes residence\n\nThe Chinese Temple \"Cheng Hoon Teng\" built in 1645\n\n\"The Straits Settlements\" created in 1826\n\nThe unique Straits Chinese culture\n\nStraits Chinese language\n\nStraits Chinese male (Baba) and female (Nonya) dresses\n\nStraits Chinese Nonya cooking"
