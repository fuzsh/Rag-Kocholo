        "text": "4.5/5\n\nEccellente\n\nYYongAlexThe hotel entrance and lobby was beautiful and very welcoming. The vibe is truly peranakan baba vibe! Checking in and checking out was a breeze. Though staff don't really take initiative to greet and check on you but they are always very responsive and helpful when you make an inquiry or request. The hotel carpark is behind the hotel so you have to drive past the lane that leads you to the entrance of the hotel to go to the back of the hotel. Confusing at first. The location of the hotel is great though， less than 5 Mins walk to Jonker street and accessible to all the shops around the popular area. The hotel room looks exactly like the photo but the bedsheet was slightly dirty when we first arrived. After requesting a change of bedsheet it's still slightly dirty. Sound proof was bad. Everyday 8 am till evening they will play music and you can't really rest in peace during the day. There is a suntan pool *not a swimming pool* at the roof top but it is super under utilize. Maybe you can start gaze while soaking your feet in the shallow water. All in all a great short stay, but not recommended for a long stay.\n\nMostra di più\n\n4.3/5\n\nEccellente\n\nCCAROLINE MARY LAIWow, this hotel is really clean. I love clean hotel. Thank you Asiatic Hotel : housekeeping team for keeping the rooms so clean. I love this hotel and definitely will come back again to stay in this hotel. I love their design of their rooms too. Very comfortable and have lot of places to put our things in organised way. They have a small fridge in the hotel. Most importantly, lot of foods and restaurants nearby. They have a cafe and 711 next door so convenient and superb. Thank you Asiatic Hotel for your hospitality and definitely will come back again to stay in this hotel.\n\nMostra di più\n\n4.1/5\n\nMolto buono\n\nTTonyQuiet part of Melaka but still easily accessible to variety of eateries. Short walk to malls but if bring infant toddler, just take grab ride which is super cheap. Service is ok as room is cleaned promptly, water bottles, toothbrush replaced daily. Dispenser soap provided for shower, I brought own facial cleanser. No slippers. Tv only 4 Malaysia channel, no cable and YouTube. Wifi is ok for me, maybe morning when all guests using at same time is abit slow. Bedsheets are clean but carpet abit dusty. I have sensitive nose so kept sneezing when I first entered room. Swimming pool not large but at rooftop have nice view. Bar is nice to have just that music abit loud. I stay 5th floor can’t hear anything in room but you hear loud music when taking lift. Gym is small but have treadmill and couple of machines but both treadmill are spoilt. Overall still a good stay as price is affordable for family.\n\nMostra di più"
