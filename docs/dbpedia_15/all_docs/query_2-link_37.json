The rich historical tapestry that’s been woven in the following pages offers readers a sense of belonging - to the culture and place - and this, in turn, creates the context from which one is able to understand the past and contemplate the future.” Datuk Ir (Dr) Abdul Rahim Hashim, Vice Chancellor, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS."
