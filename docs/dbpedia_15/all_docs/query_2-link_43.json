        "text": "Dear Connections, During my diploma internship in Terasaki Electric Sdn Bhd back on 2017, I learned something new. Terasaki Electric (M) Sendirian Berhad is the Protective power system company in Malaysia. They designed a few types of circuit breaker such as MCCB ,MCB and ACB. Throughout the internship, I learn so many things such as : 1. Trip Unit : Trip unit is one of the important component in circuit breaker. There is no circuit breaker without trip unit. There is a lot of types trip unit that used. They have 2 types of trip unit which have higher market trend which is P1 and P2 trip unit. 2. Mapping Process Learning: Mapping process is the process that to test several trip unit with different ampere. This process is to test the trip unit by injecting a specific current for each pole in the trip unit. The current that injected will be increased depends on it rating. If the trip unit is high rating the current will increased 50A while if the trip unit is in low rating the current will increased 25A. Current need to increase because to make sure the trip unit is trip for each pole. Current is increased until each trip unit have been trip for each pole. The data is collected to make a comparison between different rating. #power #internship #learning #data\n\n• My Little Journey • I graduated in Diploma of Business Study at Politeknik Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia. 3 years upside down in the journey quite challenging but I managed to graduate. I do my internship as a Retail Executive for a telco company at Johor Bahru. To be said that I'm satisfied along the internship is a bit thrilled as I do have experience with customer service when I do part time before. Every month I have target to complete, and happy to say I do achieve the target and even my supervisor and my boss at the current praised my job and offer a permanent staff. Also have some customers even when I have to relocate to other branch they still contact me and come to find me seeking for advise. Here I develop more of skills customer service and customer satisfaction. End my internship jouney, the real work life is coming. Only after one week I truly end my last semester I managed to secure a job as Production Planner. To be very honest I don't even know what is it because my mindset only said I have to get a job because I don't like to stay at home for a long time. Production Planner, even the position itself sounds challenging. I do remembered there once I cried after two weeks trying to develop about Planner. Too many times of saying \"I want to quit.\" In a company, in my department only have three planner which is the other two is my superior, my senior planner. Then one is resigning, only left two of us. After few months, my another superior is also sent her tender only left me alone. I don't even know my capable that time because I'm only less than one year experienced in planning. But somehow I managed to stay for almost 3 years. Remembered last time the project that I'm handling is always on the bottleneck. We always facing problem and complaint from customer because we can't close or follow their monthly requirement. Our customer grade us the lower score among their suppliers. I tried to overcome with rearranged all the previous schedule, I arranged meetings with customers to understand better their requirements, and lastly the result is shown. I managed to turnover the grade. From D grade to B grade in few months. A big achievement for myself, even our customers is satisfied with my works. Then after almost 3 years in Production Planning, I tried to jump to a new career path which is Insurance Agent. But I cannot survive longer due to MCO, only managed to stay for 4 months. I decide to join back to manufacturing sector, as a Human Resource Officer. Here I stayed for 2 years and half. I assist in employees' attendance, welfare, foreign workers and goverment requirements. Even after 2 years I feel like I'm not really satisfied with my works like I do when I'm as a Planner. Then I make a decision to join back as a Production Planner. As for now I'm working as a Sales & Planning Assistant. But if I have the opportunity in Production Plan I would likely glad to accept it.\n\n[Internship at PT Indo Karya Beton] New Experience and Knowledge in My Internship #1 Hello LinkedIn Fellas!!! Time flies, many things happened, and I gained valuable experiences in my internship at PT Indo Karya Beton. In addition to performing daily Human Resources tasks, I also assisted with duties the Health, Safety, and Environment staff . I acquired new knowledge and experiences related to these areas, particularly in First Aid. I learned what to do and how to perform First Aid. The first step is to assess the cause of the injury, for instance, if it’s caused by a hot object. When dealing with burns, the first action is to apply alcohol to sterilize the wound and then apply rivanol for antiseptic. After this, since the burn will likely blister, bioplacenton can be used to speed up the healing process. However, it is important to note that First Aid should be reviewed from the beginning. If the injury is severe, it is crucial to go to the hospital immediately. But if it is not severe, proper First Aid measures according to the type of injury can suffice. Different causes of injuries require different treatments."
