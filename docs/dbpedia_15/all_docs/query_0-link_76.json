Published and unpublished inventories, container, and folder lists, card catalogues, calendars, indexes, registers, and institutional guides are examples of locating aids. The Online Finding Aid (OFA) application was developed starting with the Online Finding Aid Project Proposal Paper prepared on January 14, 2005, by the Guidance Section. Next, followed up with Online Search Committee led by Dr. Hjh Samsiah Muhammad in 2008. Now, it has been realized through one of the scopes of the MyCreative Content Project (MyCC). There are four main scopes of MyCC which are Digitization of Document Archive Materials, Digitization of Audio-Visual Archive Materials, Data Center Upgrade and OFA Application Development. In March 2013, after all these four scopes ended, all 3,400,000 pages of archival and published material and 2,242 hours of digital audio-visual archival material stored in the high-tech Data Center can be directly accessed through the OFA application. For now, the use of OFA can allow access to archival materials by various layers of society at any time or place. Not only that, OFA also provides a service that the visitors can view, order, and purchased digital images. The future use of this application also will allow a centralized search to be easily performed for all types of archival material due to its performance to perform centralized searches between the COMPASS, AMS, and MAMS systems that are used to store archival materials of different types or formats. Hence, the development of this project has succeeded in attracting the interest of researchers and the public due to their sophisticated online search engine as well as enriching the users’ research experiences.\n\nHISTORY OF KEDAH SULTANATE The Kingdom of Kedah is the oldest kingdom in the Malay Peninsula. The Old Kedah Kingdom was founded in the 5th century. Beginning in the 12th century, the government of Kedah was led by the sultan as the supreme authority. Kedah practices a system of Parliamentary Democracy led by a Constitutional Monarch, His Highness the Sultan, who is also Head of State. The Sultan is the centre and symbol of loyalty for the multiracial subjects of the state and a source of unity for the people of the state. The Kedah Sultanate is a Muslim dynasty, The information regarding the formation of this sultanate and the history before and after its creation comes from the \"Kedah Annals\". The Kedah Annals were written in the eighteenth century, over a supposed millennium after the formation of the Kedah Kingdom. The beginning of the use of the title sultan in Kedah is attributed to a visit by a Muslim scholar from Yemen, Sheikh Abdullah bin Ja'afar Quamiri, to Durbar Raja II's palace at Bukit Meriam in 1136. The audience resulted in the king's conversion to Islam. He adopted the name \"Mudzaffar Shah\" and established the sultanate of Kedah, which continues to rule today. The source for the list of sultans is the official genealogy given for the Sultan of Kedah. There are however discrepancies with the Kedah Annals as it lists only 5 sultans from the first convert Mudzaffar Shah to Sulaiman Shah who was captured by Aceh in 1619. The Kedah Annals also gives unreliable information on the sultans of Kedah. Listing the first sultan of Kedah as Sultan Mudzafar Shah I centuries before the partitioning of the Abbasid Caliphate into distinct sultanates and almost three centuries prior to the contradicting claims of the Terengganu Inscription Stone.\n\nHISTORY OF KEDAH SULTANATE The Kedah Sultanate is presently one of the world's oldest continuous lines of monarchy. The present Sultan, Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Al-Aminul Karim Sultan Sallehuddin ibni Almarhum Sultan Badlishah (born on 30 April 1942) is the 29th Sultan of Kedah. His Majesty was appointed as the Sultan of the State of Kedah Darul Aman on 12 September 2017.\n\nFIGURE 1: Adat Istiadat Diraja Kedah, 18 September 1985 ACCESSION NUMBER: 2009/0001926W FIGURE 2: Surat Daripada Sultan Muhammad Jiwa Muazzam Shah Kepada Captain Francis Light.

By discovering the material, OFA saves the author time. The writers conducted their research on the Kedah Sultanate entirely online. In other words, the authors are seeking sources outside of national archives. OFA also enables authors in locating material in collections, collections, or series of documents. Additionally, OFA supports authors in identifying whether publications in collections or favorites include information relevant to the authors' question. Thus, will become easier now with the existence of online finding aids. They have effective and efficient manes with specific tools that can allow the researcher to quickly search for important information or useful tools. In short, online finding aids are essential and effective tools that can convey information about archival materials to users accurately, easily, and quickly.\n\nREFERENCES Online finding AIDS - kandungan bahan.
