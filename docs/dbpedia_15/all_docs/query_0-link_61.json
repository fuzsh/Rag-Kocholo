One of them is Indonesia's neighboring country, Malaysia, which has a number of unique facts that are interesting to discuss.\n\nAs is known, Malaysia is a federal country with 13 states and 3 federal territories. Malaysia is led by a prime minister to run the government. In 2022, this country held a general election in which Anwar Ibrahim was officially appointed as Malaysia's 10th prime minister. Summarized from various sources, here are 10 interesting facts about Malaysia that you need to know:\n\n1. The Oldest Sultanate in the World\n\nFounded in 1136, Sultan Muzaffar Shah is known as the first Sultan of Kedah. The Kedah Sultanate was the earliest sultanate on the Malay Peninsula.

Had changed name\n\nBefore using the name Malaysia, the country that created the cartoon Upin & Ipin underwent a name change.

It is listed in Ptolemy's book Geographia which was written around 150 AD.\n\n3. Unique National Anthem\n\nThe national song of Malaysia is entitled Negaraku (My Country). The determination of the national anthem has gone through a quite complex historical journey. This song was chosen from the song Sultanate of Perak, which is a change to the French song entitled La Rosalie. The melody and rhythm of the song Negaraku were adapted from the song I Shall Return by Anne Shelton. King Abdulah is the figure behind the choice of the Malaysian national anthem.\n\n4. Eight Time Zone Adjustment\n\nThe neighboring country has experienced time zone adjustments eight times. Adjustments took place in 1932, 1941, 1942, 1945, and 1982.
