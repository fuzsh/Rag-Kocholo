        "meta_description": "The legal system known as Hukum Kanun Pahang, or Pahang Laws, was established during the reign of Sultan Abdul Ghafur Muhayiddin Syah (1592–1614), the 12th Sultan of Pahang. The enduring influence of the legal system on the Institution of the Malay Sultanate has had a profound and ongoing effect on the societal structure of Malaysian society. The enduring influence of the Pahang Laws on the Institutions of the Malay Sultanate serves as a testament to the significance of safeguarding cultural legacy and maintaining social cohesion, despite the challenges posed by colonialism and globalization. This study investigates the worldwide ramifications of Pahang Laws, which are inspired by Islamic Law, and analyses the extent to which this legal framework contributes to the implementation of justice within the Malaysian social system. This study illuminates the significance of the legal system in the Malay Sultanate, providing valuable insights that can serve as a reference point for the development of legal frameworks in other countries sharing similar demographics and cultures. Particularly, it has the potential to shape the socio-legal environment of Southeast Asia and beyond.",

        "text": "The analysis of the legislative history of Malaya has significance as it allows for a more comprehensive examination of the underlying principles and objectives of certain provisions. A comprehensive understanding of laws necessitates the inclusion of historical context, as well as an examination of their primary qualities and origins. It is evident that some elements, including Islam, the monarchy, and the distinctive status of the Malays and the Malay language, had already been established before the British colonization. Hence, it is imperative to examine the legal status preceding and during the British colonization of Malaya, as it exerted a significant impact and was duly considered in the formulation of the Federal Constitution, as evident in the Johor State and the Terengganu State constitutions. This is particularly relevant concerning the Malay Sultanate, Islam, the Malays, and the Malay language (Muslim, 2020a).\n\nIn contemporary Malaysia, the practice of Islamic law predates the establishment of the Melaka Laws, which were drafted during the reign of Sultan Muzaffar Shah (1446–1456) by Hang Sidi Ahmad (Wan Husein et al., 2018). Evidence of the early implementation of Islamic law may be found in the Terengganu Inscription, dated 14 Rajab 702H, equal to 22 February 1303 (Kamaruzaman et al., 2016; Uthman, 2012; Uthman and Hashim, 2010). The Terengganu inscription encompasses a range of legislation about crimes, transactions, and administrative matters (Hooker, 1976). During the reign of Sultan Abdul Ghafur Mahaiyuddin Shah (1592–1614), the Pahang Laws were implemented, followed by the Kedah Law (Harbour Law 1650), Tembera Dato’ Seri Paduka Tuan (1078H/1666M), Code of Law Dato’ Star (t.t), the Kedah Law (1199H/1784M), and the Perak Ninety-Nine Laws. These laws, which were introduced in Malaya, demonstrate a focus on Islamic law during that period. This demonstrates that the Malay community has used Syarak law in addressing concerns about religion, inheritance, marriage, and local affairs (Macken, 1969).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the law of that era cannot be directly compared to the principles of contemporary law since the societal values and framework of that period differed significantly from the present circumstances. This is because Malaysia’s modern law governs civil, criminal, commercial, and constitutional matters, while traditional law governs communal life in Indigenous communities, including land tenure, inheritance, marriage, and social customs. The inception of Islamic-influenced legislation in Malaya may be traced back to the Melaka legislation. The existence of a legal system rooted in Islam in this nation before the arrival of European forces in Malaya is substantiated by historical sources such as the Melaka and Pahang Laws (Muslim, 2020b). For example, the two written laws during the Malacca Sultanate were the Malacca Laws and the Strait of Malacca Laws. While the Strait of Malacca Laws define maritime traffic and trade regulations, the Malacca Laws outline the authority of the king and ministers as well as taboos and punishments (Mustafa@Busul, ‘Ain Mohd Firdaus Kozaku, 2019). In essence, the nature and substance of laws are contingent upon or subject to the exigencies of the prevailing era. Therefore, the Melaka Laws and The Pahang Laws must not be assessed using the existing perspectives or standards. This observation indicates that the British did not introduce vitality or the legal framework to this nation (Muslim, 2020b).\n\nThe Johor State Constitution, established in 1895, has the distinction of being the oldest written Constitution in Malaya during the modern era. According to the constitutional provisions, it is stipulated that the monarch must possess certain qualifications, including being of Malay ethnicity, having royal lineage tracing back to the Johor Kings, being male, and adhering to the Islamic faith. In addition, it is required that the ministers possess Malay ethnicity, be affiliated with the Sultan, and adhere to the Islamic faith. According to Point VII, the designated state religion for the region of Johor is Islam. The perpetual establishment of Johor as the official religion is essential. According to Article VII of the Constitution, it is stipulated that:\n\n.. what is called the State Religion for this region and the state of Johor is Islam, and that being the case, Islam must continuously and forever be and be recognized and spoken as the state religion, that is, any other religion must never- times made or pronounced as the state religion, even though all other religions are allowed and always understood as should be allowed to be practised peacefully and peacefully by the people who adhere to it in every part and region and subjugated colony within the state of Johor.\n\nSubsequently, in the year 1911, the Laws of Constitution of Terengganu were established, stipulating that the monarch governing Terengganu must consistently adhere to the Islamic faith, possess Malay ethnicity, and trace their genealogy back to the Sultans of Terengganu. Under the regulations, it is required that the ministers possess both the religious affiliation of Islam and have citizenship in the state of Terengganu. In Chapter 51, it was observed that Islam has the status of being the official religion of the state. After the British colonization of Malaya, English law became more significant, displacing preexisting laws and constitutions. The British administration aimed to establish a uniform legal system across the Malay States, centralizing legal authority and creating a unified framework. They introduced reforms, codified laws, established courts, and implemented new procedures, which continue to influence the legal landscape in modern Malaysia (Muslim, 2020c).\n\nThe British implemented a series of legal reforms in Penang, first with the introduction of the Charter of Justice in 1807. This was then followed by the implementation of the Second Charter of Justice in 1826 and, finally, the Third Charter of Justice in 1855. The introduction of these charters has resulted in the relegation of Islamic law from its prior status as a locally practised legal system, leading to a significant decline in its overall authority. The British government formally established a distinct legal framework for Islamic law by the implementation of the Islamic Marriage Ordinance in 1880. This legislation effectively delineated the scope of Islamic law by confining its jurisdiction only to matters of divorce and marriage. The exclusion of Islamic law extends beyond marital affairs and encompasses the establishment of distinct legislation governing the application of Islamic law, so limiting the authority of Islamic judicial institutions, among other measures. One of the first administrative regulations in Islamic law that emerged under British influence was the Order in Council 1880. This regulation was established to govern the collection of zakat for the state of Perak. Subsequently, the Registration of Muhammadan Marriages and Divorce 1885 was introduced, which specifically addresses matters related to divorce (Muslim, 2014a).\n\nThe legal system in Malaya is closely intertwined with the Institutions of the Malay Sultanate since the latter significantly contribute to the development and implementation of laws in the region. To enhance comprehension, it is apparent that the position of the Sultan has a prominent position inside the first section of any extant legislation. The Malay Sultanate is the most traditional institution, having long been an integral part of the social order in the Malay nations for several centuries. It has played a direct role in the government of Malaya. The etymology of the term ‘Kerajaan’ in Malay is often attributed to its derivation from the word ‘raja.’ The tight association between the words ‘king’ and ‘kingdom’ is evident, as shown by their use as designations for the head of state in Malaysia and the nine states adhering to the monarchy system.\n\nFollowing the monarchical framework, the king had authority over all aspects of governance and state administration, relying on appointed British officials as key facilitators, particularly before the advent of British colonization. Before the outbreak of the Second World War, the Sultans, although being subject to British colonial governance, had autonomous authority and wielded complete sovereignty inside their territories. Nevertheless, concurrently, some agreements made with the British obliged the Sultan to seek counsel from British officials designated as British Residents or Advisors, except for matters about the Islamic faith and Malay traditions (Bari, 1999). The aforementioned circumstance persisted until the establishment of the Malayan Union in 1946, during which the Sultan’s authority was limited to matters about Malay traditions, while the Governor assumed control over the Islamic faith and the administrative power of the state. The dissolution of the Malayan Union Constitution and the subsequent establishment of the Federation of Malaya in 1948 might be attributed to the resistance expressed by the Malays. The restoration of the Sultan’s rights was facilitated by the implementation of the new constitution. Individuals are granted the entitlement to be informed about things in the legislative process via the implementation of a Constitutional Monarchy framework (Muslim, 2018).\n\nMalaysia is a nation that continues to adhere to the constitutional monarchy system. The enduring presence of the political system is a testament to its historical heritage. The Malay Sultanate in Malaysia is an enduring institution that serves as the central authority in the government and administration of a Malay kingdom, having developed over many centuries (Bari, 2002).\n\nThis present piece of writing can be categorized as a theoretical article. Therefore, a thorough literature review was conducted, encompassing scholarly articles, books, governmental reports, policy documents, legal reports, and other relevant materials about the legislative framework of Pahang Laws in Malaysia. Interestingly, this study does not explicitly evaluate the main source, specifically the Hukum Kanun Pahang, but instead examines research related to the Pahang Law to analyse the discussions displayed in it. The study identified a clear background of Pahang Laws and several elements within this legislation by conducting a comprehensive literature analysis from multiple sources. The finding also assessed the legal system’s impact on the Malay sultanate, specifically through the Pahang Laws. This overview of Pahang Laws offers a comprehensive grasp of the legal system in Malaysia. This outcome demonstrates the recognition and endeavours of the Malay Sultanate to protect justice within an Islamic-based administration by emphasizing that the highest achievement of Malay culture lies in the legal framework.\n\nLegal background of Hukum Kanun Pahang (Pahang Laws)\n\nThe compilation of the Pahang Laws took place during the rule of Sultan Abdul Ghafur Mahaiyuddin Shah, drawing inspiration from the Melaka Laws and many other legal texts for guidance and reference. He holds the position of the twelfth Sultan of Pahang and can trace his lineage back to the monarch of Melaka. The existence of the Pahang Laws serves as evidence of the establishment of a governing system in the state of Pahang, dating back to the reign of Sultan Abdul Ghafur Mahaiyuddin Shah (1592–1614). The Pahang Code of Law provides a comprehensive account of the prevailing structure of traditional government in Pahang throughout the specified period (Osman and Deraman, 2000).\n\nThe Pahang Laws, which were created about 1596, are the second oldest code of laws after the Melaka Laws. The Pahang Laws were formulated after the Melaka Laws, hence exhibiting a greater degree of comprehensiveness and adherence to Islamic legal principles as opposed to mere adherence to local customary practices. It was named the Hukum Kanun Pahang by refining the existing legal provisions that were suitable and adding new laws according to local and current needs. This renovation involves Shariah elements and reduces customary elements found in the Melaka Laws, which formed the basis of the Pahang Laws previously. It shows significant additions, especially concerning Islamic aspects. This can be seen through the provisions contained in the Hukum Kanun Pahang, such as the position of the king as a khalifa, enforcing good and forbidding evil, and being responsible for his subjects. The Pahang Laws include several branches of law, including Criminal Law, Civil Law, Event and Evidence Law, Religious Law, International Law, Taxation Law, Maritime and Trade Law (Abd Jalal et al., 2022).\n\nLegal provisions of the Pahang Laws\n\nThe Pahang Laws refer to a body of canon law that has undergone up to three amendments. The primary substance of the document comprises clauses 1–23, representing the original Hukum Kanun Pahang. Subsequently, an additional set of provisions, numbered 24–66, were included in the document, influenced by Islamic principles, particularly those derived from the legislative framework of the Syafie sect. The subsequent evolution of the subject matter may be seen in clauses 67–93, which pertain to the influence of Johor Laws and Melaka Laws. The phrases exhibit a lack of organization and coherence, suggesting that they were composed by either the Mangkubumi or the Treasurer since both positions have significant importance within the realm of state administration. The Hukum Kanun Pahang may be categorized into two distinct components, namely the preamble, which pertains to the monarch and the responsibilities of the Minister, and the body of laws. The precise date of the composition of the Pahang Laws remains uncertain; nevertheless, according to the documentation included in clause 23, it is indicated to have taken place on September 25, 1595 (Salahudin, 1979).\n\nThe elements included in Hukum Kanun Pahang (Pahang Laws) are as follows:\n\n1.\n\nCriminal matters: It revolves around the punishment of murder, theft, robbery, trespassing, adultery and rape, gambling, corruption, and others. It is included in clauses 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 22, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 63, 70, 72, 74, 79, 84, 86, 90, 92 and 93.\n\n2.\n\nMatters related to Muamalat: It revolves around the rules of buying and selling, renting, mortgage, borrowing, debts, wages, and others. It is included in clauses 2, 3,9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 62, 77, 81, 85, 87 and 88.\n\n3.\n\nMatters related to religious offenses: Included in clauses 60, 61, 64, and 65.\n\n4.\n\nMatters related to custom and government\n\nRelating to the duties and privileges of kings and dignitaries are summarized in clauses 1, 12, 20, 21, 23, 56, 57, 75, 76, 82, 83, 89, and 91.\n\nAnalysis of the legal influence of the Pahang Laws on the Malay Sultanate\n\nAccording to the Pahang Laws (Isa, 2003), a comprehensive system of governance and administration has been established in the region of Pahang. The highest authority in Pahang’s administrative structure is the monarch, often referred to as the king or Sultan, who leads the state government. The Sultan serves as the primary authority figure, with support from several officials like the Treasurer, Temenggung (Chief of Police), Penghulu Bendahari, Shahbandar, Hulubalang, and the king’s slaves. The Sultan is seen not just as possessing complete authority over both the populace and the governance of his realm. The institution is moreover furnished with distinctive items that are only used or affiliated with a monarch who governs the realm. Several factors are taken into consideration, such as the prohibition of yellowness, the determination of language, the obligations of the magistrate, the accountability of the monarch, penalties for noncompliance with the king’s orders, and several other aspects (Suhaini et al., 2020). The Sultan’s role as the chief executive in the Malaysian government has been maintained in the present administration but with adaptations to the notion of a Constitutional Monarchy. One example from the Undang–Undang Tubuh Malaya is the provision related to the establishment and jurisdiction of courts within the Malaya states. The document typically outlined the powers and functions of these courts, their composition, and the procedures to be followed in legal proceedings.\n\nThe first aspect to be addressed in Pahang Laws (Isa, 2003) is the obligation of the monarch. According to the prevailing discourse, the monarch must adhere to the established tradition that has been revered and upheld. Subsequently, the monarch needs to capitalize on the resources inside his realm and ensure the well-being of all its inhabitants. The first provision of this legislation pertains to the customary practises observed within the King’s council, as well as the customary norms governing the presentation of apparel and presents to individuals of high stature. Within this sentence, individuals are explicitly prohibited from adorning themselves with the hue that represents the magnificence of the monarch, namely the colour yellow. This ban is even applicable to individuals of high prominence who have not received any accolades. In the event of non-compliance with this directive, capital punishment will be enforced. Furthermore, the prohibition of donning yellow attire is also stipulated if individuals visit the monarch in the palace without any kind of commendation. In the event of non-compliance with this directive, the prescribed consequence of disrobing shall be implemented. In addition, this provision explicitly forbids the donning of a keris head adorned with tassels, unless it is accompanied by an official commendation. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in the confiscation of the dagger. The requirements are established by the monarch concerning objects that serve as representations of their magnificence and are explicitly forbidden for use by those of common status (Isa, 2003). This elucidates that throughout history, the sultan has assumed the responsibility of adhering to each constitution and law while fulfilling his duties. This adherence to the constitution and laws holds significance in portraying the sultan’s impartial execution of responsibilities, irrespective of one’s social standing or ethnic background. The sultan in Malaya represents unity and stability, upholding the constitution and laws while preserving traditional customs and heritage, and ensuring the protection of citizens’ rights.\n\nAccording to the Pahang Laws (Isa, 2003), it is also stipulated that the sultan has the authority to designate state officials, including the Penghulu Bendahari. The primary responsibilities of the Penghulu Bendahari include the documentation of all state income and the oversight of any tasks inside the palace. Simultaneously, Temenggung assumes responsibility for the management of domestic matters, including municipal administration, drainage, and other problems in the state. Subsequently, the monarch proceeded to institute the role of Hulubalang, who assumed the responsibility of overseeing the populace’s issues and managing the administrative matters inside the urban setting. The post of Syahbandar was established in Pahang to facilitate the initiation of administrative procedures, specifically about the management of both inbound and outbound trade activities. Furthermore, the role of the king’s servant has significant importance in safeguarding the monarch and ensuring the confidentiality of the king’s affairs. The allocation of power for the appointment of the Prime Minister, Minister, Chief Minister, and Exco members in Malaysia is explicitly outlined in both the Federal Constitution and the respective state constitutions. The Prime Minister holds significant authority as the head of government, the allocation of power within the executive branch is distributed among various Ministers who oversee specific portfolios and collectively contribute to the governance of Malaysia under the leadership of the Prime Minister and within the framework established by the Constitution and laws of the country. This responsibility falls within the purview of the Yang di Pertuan Agong (The Supreme Lord of Malaysia) or the Sultan.\n\nThe Pahang State Constitution encompasses a multitude of legal provisions, including those on the Sultan’s administration and governance, criminal law, civil law, evidence and procedural law, religious law, international law, tax law, and maritime law. The Sultan’s role as Head of State, his relationships with appointed officials, his relationships with the public, and the domains in which laws and governance are applicable are all outlined in the constitution’s laws on administration and governance. The document outlines the Sultan’s invincible rights, the prohibition on entering land or villages without permission, the laws against murder and Qisas for injuries, and the Hudud Laws, which include drinking alcohol, stealing, robbery, apostasy, adultery, and accusing someone of adultery as well as disobedience to the ruler. The laws of Muamalat cover a wide range of topics, including business, purchasing, selling, and defects; borrowing and pledging; lending goods; bankruptcy; slaves and their relations; setting up trusts and trust properties; leasing and hiring employees; locating misplaced property; fines and diyat; grandparents receiving gifts from their grandchildren; land opening and land; and endowments. Besides, the rules governing claims, the court filing process, oaths and witnesses, court trial procedures, and the acceptance of bribes by judges are all outlined in the procedural and evidence laws. Other than that, the laws on apostasy, prayer, and failure to pay Zakat are outlined in the Religious Laws. The laws governing sabil warfare, prisoners, crimes committed by Muslims against non-Muslims, crimes committed by non-Muslims, and interstate relations are all outlined in international law. The types of goods that are subject to taxes, the required payment rates for each item, the tax rates based on areas, the minimum tax rates for taxable goods, and the tax rates for ships entering ports are all specified by tax laws. Moreover, the Melaka Maritime Code is used in maritime law, and it covers authority at sea, captains and crews, boats, and the enforcement of laws like those of Hudud crimes, civil laws, laws governing ships entering ports, and so forth (Abd Jalal et al., 2022).\n\nSubsequently, the Sultan and Pembesar are required to engage in collaborative efforts and mutually reinforce one another to initiate the establishment of the state government. This statement posits that if the king had bravery and wisdom, he would understand that the absence of agreement between the Minister and the people would hinder the attainment of peace. The analogy used is that just as a fire cannot burn without knowledge, the monarch and the Minister will similarly be unable to achieve their objectives without mutual understanding and cooperation. The collaboration between individuals and groups is of utmost importance in the governance of a state. The ethos has significant importance in facilitating the efficient functioning of both national and state administrations, hence assuring the seamless provision of optimal services to the populace. The smooth functioning of national and state administrations is contingent upon the presence of effective collaboration. Consequently, this gives rise to a constitutional crisis and adversely affects the populace.\n\nDuring the time of Hindu–Buddhist dominance, which is from the 6th century AD until the 10th century AD, there was a notable shift in the ideology and system of administration towards the notion and system of the Sultan in Islam, although to a limited extent (Al-Attas, 1972). The Sultan assumes the role of the highest authority in the state, responsible for the implementation of laws, ensuring justice, and upholding the rights and interests of the populace (Borhan, 2004; Muslim, 2014b). The Sultan assumes authority over matters of religion and customs, with the primary responsibility of upholding the integrity of religious practises and preserving the honour associated with customary traditions. The legal system in Malaya reflects the Malay Sultanate’s commitment to implementing justice within a governing framework influenced by Islam and the pinnacle of Malay civilization (Muslim and Umar, 2017). Consequently, Islam has been designated as the official religion of the state. The significant impact of the Sultan in the realm of canon law, as the head of the government and supported by a Fakih, is undeniable, owing to the robustness of the Islamic faith. This demonstrates that the Sultan has consistently held authority over religious and cultural matters, remaining unchallenged even following the British intervention through the Pangkor Agreement in 1874. The Pangkor Agreement of 1874 was a treaty signed between the British government and the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Abdullah, on the island of Pangkor in Perak, Malaysia. The agreement was significant as it marked the beginning of British intervention in the affairs of the Malay states. The meeting, organized by Governor Andrew Clarke, resolved a Perak succession dispute and stopped warfare between Chinese secret societies. Sultan Abdullah, supported by Lower Perak chiefs, was chosen as the winner. Ismail, the Upper Perak contender, was granted the title of Sultan Muda (Sundara Raja, 2015). This intervention occurred during the Malayan Union, a period in which the Malays expressed opposition due to its perceived encroachment upon the Sultan’s power. This authority has persisted from the time of independence until the present day.\n\nAccording to the preamble of the Pahang Laws (Isa, 2003), the government system of the Pahang Sultanate aims to ensure the preservation of the state’s interests, allowing the sultans to safeguard the welfare of all individuals. Additionally, the sultan is empowered to choose representatives to act on his behalf, therefore facilitating the smooth functioning of governance without causing undue burden to the sultan. This work pertains to the establishment of trust and the administration of an oath of office in the governance of a state, whereby a clear distinction is made between the ruling monarch and the general populace. This passage delineates the trust placed upon the sultan in safeguarding Islamic interests, protecting the rights of Malays and Bumiputera, promoting the Malay language, upholding the rights of other ethnic groups, maintaining a neutral stance devoid of political ideology, and addressing the concerns of the populace by ensuring optimal service provision from the executive branch. Furthermore, it highlights the sultan’s role as a stronghold of democracy and as a mechanism for checks and balances within Malaysia’s democratic system."
