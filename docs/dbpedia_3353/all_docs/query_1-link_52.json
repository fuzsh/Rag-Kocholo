        "text": "How It Works\n\nMembers of Congress take countless votes every year, many of which add new spending.\n\nSpendingTracker.org automatically aggregates the new spending contained in each bill, according to official estimates, to create each Member of Congress's total \"number\" based on what they have voted for.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nNearly every elected official and candidate promises to spend the people's money responsibly, but rising debt and historically high spending shows that these promises are usually forgotten.\n\nWe believe that accountability matters, so we created SpendingTracker.org to reveal who is voting for what â€“ as it happens."
