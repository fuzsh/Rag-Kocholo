        "text": "Adelaida Cuellar’s will always be remembered for her handmade tamales and chili. Her legacy was born in the 1890’s after her family migrated from Mexico to Texas. Adelaida Cuellar’s tamales first debuted at the Kaufman county fair. Her tamales and chili were accompanied by Adelaida’s twelve children playing music to attract customers. After this proved to be successful, she opened a neighborhood restaurant in 1928. Five out of eight of Adelaida’s sons helped expand the business; the Cuellar’s brothers became known as “Mama’s boys”. After 20 years of gradual expansion, the Cuellar family created the restaurants we know and love today.\n\nOur Taste\n\nThe Cuellars were among the first to spread the taste of authentic Mexican recipes with Texas flair. Their traditional tasting, but original spin on Mexican cuisine helped make Tex-Mex the most widespread form of Mexican American food. The first Dallas location opened on Oak Lawn Avenue in 1940. Hundreds of local full service restaurants and, fast-food chains opened to compete in the popular Tex-Mex genre. American restaurants had to add familiar Tex-Mex dishes to attract business. When asked how the family found success, Former CEO, son Mack Cuellar, said ‘”Where there is family congeniality, there is success’”"
