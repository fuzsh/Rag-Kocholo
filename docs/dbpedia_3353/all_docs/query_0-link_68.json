Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez, and Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr., proudly represented their country and their sacrifice will forever be memorialized with the renaming of the Del Mar Post Office in Laredo. The renamed post office will serve as a reminder to their community of their heroic lives and will cement their legacy for years to come,” said Sen.

Henry Cuellar (D-Texas-28).\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThis bill would rename the post office at 2395 East Del Mar Boulevard in Laredo, Texas, in honor of fallen military heroes Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez, and Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr.\n\nLance Corporal David Lee Espinoza lived in nearby Rio Bravo, Texas all his life.
