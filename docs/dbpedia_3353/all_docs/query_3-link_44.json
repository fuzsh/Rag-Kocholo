        "text": "TEXAS â The House Ethics Committee voted to start an investigation into Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, on Wednesday, focusing on allegations of bribery and improper gifts.\n\nThe investigation comes nearly a month after Cuellar and his wife were indicted on bribery and money laundering charges.\n\nIndictments reveal that Cuellar and his spouse allegedly accepted close to $600,000 in bribes from an energy company controlled by Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank during the period from 2014 to 2021. In exchange, investigators say, Cuellar promised to further the interests of both the country and the bank within the United States.\n\nThe Ethics Committee, led by Rep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., and Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa., said that the approval of the creation of the investigative subcommittee was voted on unanimously.\n\nCuellar, in a statement to The Associated Press, said he respects the committeeâs work. He said he is âinnocent of these allegations, and everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.â\n\nThe press release states that the Ethics Committee âis aware of the risks associated with dual investigations and is in communication with the Department of Justice to mitigate the potential risks while still meeting the Committeeâs obligations to safeguard the integrity of the House.â\n\nRead the full press release here:"
