        "text": "Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, was carjacked Monday night by three men in the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard area near the Capitol building, according to reports.\n\nWASHINGTON - Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, was carjacked Monday night by three armed assailants in Navy Yard near the Capitol building in Washington, D.C.\n\nJacob Hochberg, Cuellar’s chief of staff, said in a statement that as Cuellar was parking his car, three “armed assailants approached the Congressman and stole his vehicle.”\n\n“Luckily, he was not harmed and is working with local law enforcement,” Hochberg said.\n\nD.C. police said the incident occurred at 9:30 p.m. at New Jersey Avenue and K Street SE and that at least one of the robbers had a gun, according to The Washington Post. However, the police did not identify the victim.\n\nCuellar’s aide indicated the congressman’s car was recovered but it is unclear whether arrests were made, the Post reported. The D.C. police are working with the Capitol police to track down the carjackers.\n\nCuellar is not the only member of Congress to be assaulted in D.C. this year. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., was attacked in her apartment building in February and suffered bruises.\n\nContributing: Associated Press"
