        "text": "WASHINGTON â It would not be surprising if Texas Republicans made a play for the seat of Rep. Henry Cuellar after he was indicted earlier this month, but the GOP has not yet made any major moves to flip it.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nMost Republicans are not calling on Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, to step down following his federal indictment, and his South Texas seat is conspicuously absent from the House Republicansâ target list\n\nThe longtime Laredo Democrat and his wife are accused of accepting almost $600,000 in bribes from Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank\n\nSome analysts say it is a matter of political calculus and national Republicans would rather spend the resources in more competitive races in South Texas\n\nThe GOP is focused instead on protecting freshman Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Edinburg, from a challenge by Democrat Michelle Vallejo and helping Republican Mayra Flores try to replace Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen\n\nThe longtime Laredo Democrat and his wife are accused of accepting almost $600,000 in bribes from Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank. The couple denies the allegations. But most Republicans are not calling on Cuellar to step down, and his South Texas seat is conspicuously absent from the House Republicansâ target list.\n\nâItâs a matter of political calculus,â said Andrew Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.\n\nCuellar is the last Democrat in the U.S. House who opposes abortion rights and has often worked with GOP members on border security and oil and gas issues.\n\nâIs it worth making a conservative seat somewhat more slightly more conservative? Is it really worth it? Cuellar has a well-deserved reputation as the most, I believe, the most conservative Democrat in Congress,â Smith said. âFrom a Republican calculus, is it really worth spending all that money that could be used elsewhere?â\n\nNational Republicans spent money two years ago to unseat Cuellar, but times have changed. The GOP is focused instead on protecting freshman Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Edinburg, from a challenge by Democrat Michelle Vallejo and helping Republican Mayra Flores try to replace Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen.\n\nJason Villalba, chair and chief executive officer of the Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation, said Cuellar has a longstanding history serving in the region. Cuellar previously served in the Texas state house and was appointed the Secretary of State.\n\nâThis congressman is very popular, has done very well, and if theyâre going to challenge people and spend money and resources in that region, theyâre going to find races that are much closer and more likely to be won in the next coming cycle,â Villalba, a former Republican state lawmaker, said.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee is also arguing that Cuellarâs legal troubles are a problem for those Texas Democrats in more competitive races in South Texas. The group said Democrats should call on Cuellar to resign following his indictment.\n\nShortly after Cook Political Report and Sabatoâs Crystal Ball changed their rating for Cuellarâs district from likely Democratic to leans Democratic, NRCC spokesperson Delanie Bomar said, âHenry Cuellar is a liability for his fellow South Texas Democrats Vicente Gonzalez and Michelle Vallejo, officially making him another headache for national Democrats in the region.â\n\nWhen asked for a response to some of the NRCCâs latest comments, Gonzalez said in a statement to Spectrum News, âI think Republicans have a much bigger concern blindly following their 92-time indicted orange master than any Democrat has regarding a single member of Congress who has been indicted districts away.â\n\nGonzalez is referring to former President Donald Trump.\n\nâIf you look at really both sides of the political aisle, Republicans and Democrats, you know, indictments are not uncommon in politics,â Villalba said. âUntil those indictments come down and end up in convictions, I think people are willing to give their elected officials the benefit of the doubt going into an election cycle.â"
