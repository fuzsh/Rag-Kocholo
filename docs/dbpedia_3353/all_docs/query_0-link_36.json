        "text": "MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nTexas Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar is at the center of a public corruption probe that's led to more than a dozen federal charges against him. Political watchers say it could threaten his reelection bid this year, and that's a key seat in Democrats' aims to flip control of the U.S. House. But Cuellar's constituents say that kind of thinking does not hold up in Texas. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has more from the state's border community, Laredo.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: There's a polling site in Laredo, Texas, that could be easily mistaken for a block party.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Thank you.\n\nGRISALES: Long lines of voters are snaking around an administrative building for the Laredo Fire Department as political candidates try to rile up supporters.\n\nROLE SAN MIGUEL: This is constable Precinct 4. This is my first time running.\n\nGRISALES: That's Democrat Role San Miguel. As he said, he's running for precinct constable. He's a former police officer and part of a big, well-known family here. His law enforcement work isn't stopping him or his family from backing indicted congressman Henry Cuellar. That includes Role's brother, Charlie San Miguel, a former city council member.\n\nCHARLIE SAN MIGUEL: He's Laredo's son. I mean, I've seen him, you know, fight for us. I've seen him in Washington, D.C., fighting for us.\n\nGRISALES: Cuellar is considered by many to be the most powerful Democrat in Texas. He has a long list of honors, including a school that carries his name. And his siblings have served in elected roles. Many here were angry when they learned Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, were indicted on 14 federal criminal charges, including conspiracy, bribery and money laundering.\n\nC SAN MIGUEL: Come on. People aren't dumb. We see what's going on. Everybody knows what's going on. We can see it. (Speaking Spanish).\n\nGRISALES: \"We aren't idiots,\" Charlie San Miguel says in Spanish. He thinks Cuellar was targeted by President Biden and other Democrats for speaking out against their border policies. It's a popular claim here, even if it's lacking in evidence. Charlie's son, Roberto San Miguel, adds that what makes Cuellar hated by Democrats, his conservative stances on issues such as the border and abortion access, are what make him an enduring political figure here.\n\nROBERTO SAN MIGUEL: Before we claim our political parties, we're primarily conservative.\n\nGRISALES: Roberto San Miguel says Cuellar will come out on top because he's done a lot for the community as a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee.\n\nROBERTO SAN MIGUEL: I appreciate what he's done, what his family's done. They all bring millions - tens of millions of dollars to this town. And, you know, government jobs here in Laredo are real big.\n\nGRISALES: It's also part of what makes Cuellar draw split voters like the San Miguels and others who vote Republican for the presidency and Democrat for their Congressmen - voters like these.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I voted for President Trump in 2016 and 2020.\n\nGRISALES: And you're voting for him again this year?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Yes.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: For president, I'll be voting for President Trump.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Trump.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: There's a lot of people that are going to vote for Trump here in Laredo.\n\nGRISALES: Trump is also facing charges in multiple states and was recently convicted of fraud in New York. And here, voters are also familiar with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The state's top law enforcement officer kept his job, even as he faced state securities fraud charges for nearly a decade.\n\nCuellar has denied the criminal allegations against him, and a trial is now set to begin next year. Here he is leaving his office on a recent day on Capitol Hill.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nHENRY CUELLAR: My wife and I are innocent, and we'll have our day in court.\n\nGRISALES: But the allegations have given hope to his GOP challenger, Navy veteran Jay Furman, for a potential upset. Cuellar, for his part, continues to campaign in his district, highlighting wins for Laredo in this year's government funding plan.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCUELLAR: I'm doing my work. You know, we've been voting. We passed one of the appropriation bills today. I'm delivering to the district. So I'm going to continue working, representing the district.\n\nGRISALES: Within days of his indictment, Cuellar got a key endorsement. Trump broke with his party to defend the Democrat against the criminal allegations, calling him a respected congressman who would not, quote, \"play Biden's border game.\"\n\nClaudia Grisales, NPR News, Laredo, Texas.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BUN B AND STATIK SELEKTAH SONG, \"CONCRETE\")\n\nCopyright © 2024 NPR.
