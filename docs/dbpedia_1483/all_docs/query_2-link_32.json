        "text": "The History of Middlesex County 1635-1885\n\nJ. H. Beers & Co., 36 Vesey Street, New York\n\n1884\n\nPages 229-241\n\nTown of Portland\n\nBy Hon. William H. BUELL\n\n[transcribed by Janece Streig]\n\nGEOGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY.\n\nPortland is one of the two northern towns of Middlesex county. It was first known as East Middletown, being constituted the Third Society of Middletown, in 1714. In 1767, it was incorporated at Chatham, that township also including the societies of Middle Haddam and East Hampton.\n\nIn May 1841, that part which was known as the First Society of Chatham was set off as a separate town, with the name of Portland. It is bounded on the north by the town of Glastonbury, on the east by Chatham, and the Connecticut River forms it western and southern boundary. It is nine miles long and three miles wide.\n\nThe population of the township at the several census dates has been reported as follows: 1840, included with Chatham; 1850, 2905; 1860, 3657; 1870, 4,694; 1880, 4,156.\n\nThe assessors statistics, for 1883, are as follows: Acres, 11,642; valuation of real estate, $788,430; personal property, $1,944,027; polls, $755; school tax (State), $9,211.07; county tax, $387.98; road tax, $2,255.16; poor tax, $5,028.50.\n\nThe village is beautifully situated upon the eastern bank of the Connecticut River, where it sweeps around the bend opposite Middletown and Cromwell. Any one looking at Portland, as represented upon a good map, will see at one the significance and appropriateness of its Indian name, Wangunk, \"The Bend.\"\n\nIt is celebrated chiefly for its fine quarries of brown or sand stone; these, with the other geological formations, are described at length in another place. There are some fine farming lands, principally near the river. In some places it is very rocky, but well adapted to sheep farming. Its location, in regard to the river, and its other natural advantages, make it, after its rather uninviting approaches are passed, one of the most delightful of villages.\n\nThe Main street is about two miles long, and four rods average width. It is shaded by beautiful old elms, and in some places by a double row of maples. It is partly lighted and paved. It has a fine soldiers' monument, six churches, two post offices, stores, two public halls, and nine school houses.\n\nThe shipyard of Gildersleeve & Sons is at the upper end of the village called Gildersleeve. This village has a post office and a large brick store. An account of the shipyard, churches, schools, and industries of the town will be found under those respective heads.\n\nBesides the great brownstone quarries for which Portland is famous, it has other quarried, which in other localities might be considered remarkable. The granite quarry on Calling's Hill, now disused, furnished the stone for the railroad bridge across the river.\n\nOn this same hill is a chalybeate spring, known for many years, but never much used for medicinal purposes. There is also a spring near the top of Bald Hill, said to be strongly impregnated with iron. In 1789, appearances imbedded in so hard a rock that no efforts were made to mine it. The fine feldspar mine, near Deacon Ralph PELTON's, has been worked by him since 1872. Several thousand tons of the stone have been taken out. A sample of the feldspar taken to the Centennial was pronounced the finest there. Fine beryls, garnets, etc., have been found here. Mica has been mined in several places. Coal of good quality was found at Indian Hill, about 1780. Plumbago has been found in small quantities.\n\nThe cobalt mine, at the foot of Great Hill, was opened by Dr. STEPHANNES, but the operations were mostly carried on within the limits of Middle Haddam.\n\nPacansett Pond and Job's Pond-so named from Mr. Job PAYNE, who formerly owned the land-are the largest bodies of water within the limits of Portland. Job's Pond has been thought very remarkable. It has no apparent outlet, and is in some places 40 to 60 feet deep. Says Dr. FIELD in his history:\n\n\"It rises and falls as much as fifteen feet but not from such causes as affect other ponds. It is often the highest in the dry season and lowest in the wet season of the year. When it begins to rise it rises regularly for six or twelve months and then falls for about the same period.\n\nThose, however, who are most capable of judging think that there is nothing mysterious about it; it is probably fed by a very deep springs which are not affected by the rainfall until after a considerable time. This beautiful sheet of water, deeply set between the hills, is now known as Waroona Lake. This appropriate name is the Australian word for \"solitude.\" Great Hill Pond is an artificial lakelet at the foot of Great Hill, covering about 100 acres of marshy land. The highest elevations of land are the Great Hill and Bald Hill. This last with \"Mesomesic Mountain\" and Raccoon Hill have long been noted as the resort of rattlesnakes. Hundreds have been killed here. In September 1881, Deacon PELTON, who has been very active in bruising the serpent's head, in one afternoon killed fifteen, and the next morning killed four and captured six. The largest was 5 feet 10 inches in length.\n\nThe old elm near St. John's Chapel should be noticed as it supposed to be the largest in the State. Two feet above the ground it measures 22 feet, 8 inches girth. It was here when the town was first settled, and was held in veneration by the Indians who held pow-wows under it.\n\nA large amount of hay is annually gathered, the quarries using the most of it. Sheep are kept to some extent. Deacon F. PAYNE and Osmer PELTON cultivate extensive peach orchards. Cardella REEVES is quite an extensive fruit grower.\n\n\"Wangunk Meadow\" has always been held as a common field on account of the difficulty of maintaining and renewing fences after the annual floods. The boundaries of each man's share are defined, and each has a certain portion of the outside fence to maintain.\n\nThe land was granted in March 1698 (two previous grants being annulled) to Sam'll BIDWELL, John HAMBLIN, John BACON, Andrew WARNER, and Will'm CORNWALL jun'r. The first legible entry in their record is:\n\n\"March ye 8th 1736-7 William CORNWELL Senior, Sergt. Jas. BUCK, and Joseph WHITE were chosen to order the prudentials of s'd field. Joseph WHITE Clerk, Corp'l Thomas BUCK and Sergt. Ebenezer GIBS chosen fence viewers, Moses CUMMIN, John ROBBINS and John JONES hay wards,\" \"The Proprietors by Major vote Agree that the s'd field shall be free for feeding by the proprietors cattle for three weeks and noe more By Major vote this Meeting was Adjourned to the first Monday in October next at Sun two ours high at Night.\"\n\nThe proprietors now hold their annual meeting the first Monday in March; elect their officers, and arrange for the management of the field the year ensuing; the present officers are: Andrew CORNWELL, H. B. WILCOX, J. E. TRYON, committee; Lucius STEWART, Martin CAVANAUGH, Albert HALE, D. C. HORTON, fence viewers; Titus HALE, S. W. STRICKLAND, Nelson CORNWALL, D. W. CORNWALL, Charles HALL, Benjamin CHAPMAN, Eugene S. STRICKLAND, John E. TRYON, D. C. HORTON, haywards; Luther WILCOX, clerk.\n\nINDIANS.\n\nThe aboriginal proprietors of Portland were the Wangunks, or Womgoms, a small tribe or fragment of a tribe which had belonged to the great Algonkin race, but in the confusion resulting from the incursions of the conquering Pequots the great tribes were split into large or small bands, under the leadership of their own sagamores, or sachems, and wandered along the banks of the Connecticut River, sometimes settling in a locality which promised to supply their simple requirements, owning allegiance, indeed, to one great chief or king, but with little clannish feeling or national strength. These small clans, comprising all Indians living on the shores of the Connecticut River, within the limits of the colony, were known to the early settlers under the general designation of \"River Indians.\" Their king was Sequassen, the sachem of Hartford, but the particular chief of the Wangunks was Sowheag, or Sequin, who, when first known to the white men, lived at Pyquag, or Wethersfield, but after some quarrels with the settlers he removed to Mattabesett (Middletown).\n\nThe eastern shore of the river, opposite Middletown, was at this time a dense forest. Huge masses of stone overhung the river, and trees which were the growth of centuries shaded the banks. The straits were then narrower, and the river consequently wider at this place, forming almost a lake. The main street of Portland was a swamp, inhabited by herons and other waterfowl. The woodlands and meadows farther back were considered good hunting grounds, as they abounded in large and small game. Along the narrow trains through this dark forest the wild beast and Indian hunter alike noiselessly traveled in single file.\n\nFew white men were seen here. Traders, like the SHELINE brothers, who came to barter their brass kettles, glass beads, knives, etc., for furs and fish, made their annual visits, enjoyed the hospitality of their red brothers, and departed; their fathers' schooner laden with a valuable cargo.\n\nIn 1672, the town of Middletown bought of Naschegon Sepunnemoe and several other Indians, a tract extending six miles eastward from the river, from Wethersfield bounds on the north, to Haddam bounds on the south. The Indians, however, reserved 300 acres on the east side for their exclusive use, besides the right of fishing where they pleased, cutting sampling, withes for baskets, etc.,\n\nIn 1675, Middletown set aside these 300 acres \"for the heirs of Sowheag and the Mattabesset Indians.\" Some confusion has arisen from the fact that the Indians who lived on this reservation were called Wanguns, while the land was set apart for the \"Mangunks Indians.\" The Indians applied names to localities descriptive of the place, beautiful and appropriate, but not capable of arbitrary transference, and they usually took their names from the place where they lived. The word Wongunk, Wangunck, Wangonke, Wongom, Womgog, as it is variously spelled in the old records (each writer spelling it according to his understanding of the sound which fell from the Indian lips). Wangonk, as it is most frequently written, meant in the Aboriginal tongue-as has been said-\"The Bend.\" After the settlement of the Mattabesett Indians on the opposite shore, they were all probably called \"Wangunks,\" meaning simple those living in the bend of the river. There is a record, April 24th 1670, of the\n\n\"Indian land at Wangonk, the upland with ten Acres of meadow within that square is thirtie three Acres, being a hundred thirty six rods long on the longest side, beginning at a beach tree by the river side west, a butting on the highway south, and the river, and on the highway east. The depth at the end is 54 Rods wide. The rest of the meadow belonging to the Indians at Wangonk is nine Acres lying in various parcels intermixed among the Englishe's meadow land there and at Deer Island, is six or seven Acres, all which land was given to the Indians, By the Honourable Mr RAINS and Mr. HOPKINS In the yeare fiftie A judged by these Gentlemen as a soficent allowance for them. Thare was also fourtie Acres given to Sansennk & Siana half to each, buting on the boogie meadow north & east and on the swampe south, on the undivided land west.\"\n\nThere was also some land at Indian Hill, and 200 acres south of the town house on \"both sides of the highway,\" in the center of which tract the Third Society of Middletown afterward built their meeting house. The Indians did not seem at first satisfied with the location of their lands, for in 1672 the town appointed Ensign WHITE, William CHENY, and Deacon HALL \"to attend the Honoured gentlemen when they come down about laying out the Indian land at Wangonk.\" The same year, \"it was Agreed by the town, to gratifie the Indians, in order to acquit all claims & titles to any lands within our bounds, that they should be either suited with land in undivided land, if they like, or in the land they propound for, so they give us assurance.\" And the committee were instructed to agree with those whose lands must be taken away to suit the Indians; and to give them other lands or the value of the land in money.\n\nThere were numerous petitions preferred to the General Court, on the part of settlers, for permission to buy lands included in the reservation. The General Court exercising a sort of guardianship or protectorate over the aborigines, its consent was necessary to the conveyance of land.\n\nIn 1693, the General Court granted Captain WHITE \"liberty to buy a smale parcel of land at Wamgom about halfe an acre of land or little more of the Indian squa that is Massecup's wife;\" and in May 1697, liberty was granted to \"any one of the Inhabitants of Middletown to purchase of the Indians there inhabiting claiming propriety of land at Wangunck Meddowe about one acre of grasse land in the said meddowe.\"\n\nThe wild parties of the other part were also graciously permitted to sell the land which was the free inheritance of their fathers. In May 1711, \"Canshamet, Indian man and squa widow of Massecup late sachem, all of Midletown or Glastonbury,\" were given permission to sell land, and in 1713, upon petition of John CLARK jr., of Middletown, certain Indians, named Siana CUSCHAY and Nannamaroos were empowered to make a legal conveyance of half and acre of land within the meadow commonly called \"Wongunck.\" The Indian, Siana, may be lived at the place we call Siam. David CLARK, of Middleton, in 1715, bought, with permission of the General Court, of an Indian named Conschoy (probably the same as Cuschoy) \"two acres of land which Lyeth upon an island commonly called Wongung island.\"\n\nAs has been said, the \"Honourable gentlemen\" who came from Hartford in 1748 to fix the place for the second meeting house, \"Set the stake,\" nearly in the center of the Indian reservation of 200 acres. In June 1750, it was agreed \"to Aply ourselfs to the town of Middletown for a Libberty for this Society to purchase three Acres of land of the Indians joining to and Emcompassing the stake which the last gentlemen the assemblys comite pitched for us to build our meeting house upon.\" But they soon \"supposed that such a body of Indian Land lyeing so neare the centre of said Society was a Disadvantage to the publick Interest of this Parish;\" and in 1756 they petitioned \"the General Assembly of the Colony of Connecticut at their present session in Hartford to appoint a Com'tee or guardians for the Indians belonging to said town to assist and direct them in selling their lands in s'd Society into one, two, three, four, five, or six acre lotments to the Inhabitants of s'd Society or such part thereof as s'd committee or guardians shall advise to, at the same time agreed by Major vote that no man should have liberty to purchase more than one of the above said lotments.\"\n\nThis petition (the original of which is in the State Library) states these reasons why this sale of Indian land was considered advisable: that there were two tracts of land belonging to the Indians, in said society, one of which, containing about 200 acres, was in the center of the society, encompassing the meeting house, and lying upon both sides of the highway, running through the parish, and also that the tribe for whom the reservation was intended \"have in the course of time suffered the common fate of the Indian natives of this country and are reduced to a very small number.\"\n\nIn 1764, the tribe numbered 30 or 40 persons. Only two squaws and their three children, however, remained in Chatham, the others having removed to Hartford or joined the Mohegan or Farmington Indians.\n\nIn 1765, a committee was appointed \"to sell the land, and use the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians.\" They reported that they had on hand funds to the amount of £163 19s. in Continental bills, and about £100 in obligations, not yet collected. By 1772, over £90 of this sum had been spent for the support of old Mary CUSCHOY, one of the two squaws just mentioned, the \"blind and aged widow of CUSCHOY, late sachem.\" The remainder of this fund was doubtless laid out for the benefit of the Indians in various ways.\n\nIn 1785, a committee was appointed by the Legislature \"to collect all the money due on the Indian lands at Wangonk and pay it over to the proprietors.\"\n\nThe last member of the tribe was \"Old Betty,\" who lived at Pequin or \"Betty's Hill\" as late as 1830.\n\nFor more than 80 years the Indians lived among the whites in this town. While they were the most numerous it dos not appear that they ever used their power to the injury of the settlers. There are no bloody traditions of murdered settlers or burning cabins. They constantly dwindled in number, but remained quiet and gentle, unless under the influence of undue \"fire water\" or a frenzied \"powwow,\" -amenable to the laws, and treated with kindness and consideration. Much of this part of their history is necessarily but the fain echo of tradition. The number of Indians who settled upon this reservation on the east side is not known. Twenty signatures are appended to a deed dated December 1732, now in the possession of Col BARTLITT. The names are as follow: Mamoson, Betty, Cuschoy, Moses MOXON, James Charles ROBBIN, young Sean, Long Simon, young Betty, Sary, Mesooggosk, Shimmoon, Moses COMSHOT, Jacob, Tom ROBBIN, young squamp, Muschoise, John ROBBIN, Metowhump, and Mequash hest; Siana, Sansennk, and Nannemaroos have been mentioned as owners of Wangunk Meadow.\n\nTradition says that Mamoson was a great chief, and lived in the lower part of the town. There need be no surprise, therefore, that many communications received through the medium of the once popular Planchette bore his signature.\n\nCuschoy is mentioned in official documents of 1756 as the \"only sachem left\" of the Wangunk tribe, \"a lame man and not able to travel much.\"\n\n\"Doctor ROBBIN\" is also mentioned in the records as the \"last sachem of the Middletown Indians.\" The only son of his daughter (not his son as has been said), was Richard RANNY, \"positively the last\" sachem of the Wangunks. He was brought up among the whites, who taught him to read and write the English language. He learned the joiner's trade, was baptized (perhaps with the name of his benefactor), and became a professor of religion.\n\n\"Long Simon,\" or \"Jo Simon.\" Used neither the + mark nor his savage totem, like the rest, but wrote a bold signature thus, SIMON. He was probably the Simon CHOYCHOY who was one of the councilors of the Mohegan sachem, Ben UNCAS, and he is frequently mentioned in the Indian papers.\n\n\"Sary,\" or Sarah SIMON is frequently mentioned in the day book of Ebenezer WHITE, in 1744, as also is CUSCHAW and CUSCHOY. These were the old sachem and one of the squaws who were supported by the town.\n\nOne of these Indians, at least, must have been of the royal Mohegan blood, as Mukchoise signs with the totem of Oweneco III.\n\n\"Young Betty\" was probably, the squaw whom some still living can remember as \"old Betty;\" bent, white haired, her dark skin almost blanched by age, living in a but on the spot still called \"Betty's Hill.\" Every year, while she lived, the Indians of the tribe living in other places used to visit her. One citizen of the town vividly remembers seeing the Indians approaching his grandmother's house, on their way to see Betty. Indians were associated, in his youthful mind, with war whoops, tomahawks, and glittering knives; so he promptly removed his imperiled scalp to the darkest corner under grandmother's bed, whence, after much reassuring argument, he was coaxed to see the Indians prepare their supper. They brought large stones to the house and heated them red hot, them placed them in their kettle, filled it with water, which immediately boiled, and poured from sacks which they had brought on their shoulders in abundance of young turtles; which, when cooked, they scraped from the shells and ate. There is a story extant of old Betty, illustrating the weak but familiar saying, that \"the truth should not be told at all times,\" at least, not too soon after dinner. A gentleman while hunting or looking over his land, dropped in upon old Betty about noon. She was known as a famous cook, especially of fish and game; and her invitation to dine was accepted without hesitation. She placed a dish of savory eels before him, and he ate heartily, and enjoyed the meal; but, alas! He must ask old Betty where she got them. She answered calmly, \"plenty black snake on the ledge.\" Pointing to a pile of heads which were too serpentine to leave room for doubt. \"The untutored mind\" of the Indian could not apprehend delicate distinctions, and a contemporary remarked that the Indians were very fond of snakes.\n\nOne of the Wangunks, known as Indian Thomas, was a soldier in the Revolution, and a pensioner, perhaps a descendant of that Thomas the Indian whom the town of Middletown, in 1657, voted to accept as an inhabitant \"if they could agree upon terms.\"\n\nAn Indian named John CUTCHOYUE is remembered to have visited this place from Long Island in 1822.\n\nNot many years ago, a row of Indian \"fire places,\" or rings of stones inside of which they built their fires, still remained at the fish place, showing where their wigwams had stood. It is said that the house of the sachem, or perhaps the council lodge, stood on the corner now occupied by Mr. HUBBARD's house, opposite GILDERSLEEVE's store. The lot back of Newman GOFF's is still called \"hot house lot,\" from its being the place of an ancient Indian \"sanitarium,\" made by digging in the river bank a hole, in which was placed a hot stone, the top being covered with boughs or a blanket, over which the Indian was placed.\n\nAfter a profuse perspiration had in this way been induced, the occupant rushed out and into the river. This mode of treatment was used by the Indians in nearly all cases of sickness; but however successful it may have been at times, it was manifestly improper as a cure for small-pox, and when this disease raged among them, very many lost their lives by this \"hydropathic\" method.\n\nIndian Hill was also the burial place of the chiefs after they made their home on this side of the river. One, at least, of the royal Mohegan blood was buried here. Tradition assets that he was visiting the Wangunks and died of small-pox. His tombstone was standing but a few years ago, and was seen by many. The inscription copied by Dr. Field in 1853, was this: \"Here lies the body of John ONEKOUS, who died August the 39th 1722, aged 26 years.\" Three graves were opened on Indian Hill, in the spring of 1808, one of a man and two of children.\n\n\"The man was placed sitting, wrapped in a blanket (which was not entirely consumed, but upon exposure to the air, became as brunt straw); in his lap were two small brass kettles, probably filled with soup or succotash at the time of burial, one of which had sunk down into the other, in which were a spoon, knife, phial, and pipe. His arm extended round the kettles, and where the flesh cam in contact with the brass, from the elbow to the wrist, the flesh was preserved. In the hand of one of the children was found a brass cup, of the size of a tea cup, and here again the flesh on the fingers was preserved, where they came against the brass. Around the wrist was wampum, strung on deer string, and near by beads, supposed to have been placed about the neck. In the grave of the other child was a coffee box containing wampum.\"\n\nYears ago, when the roads were worked, the school children sometimes picked up a pint of these beads at a time. It is conjectured that the point must have been the scene of an Indian battle, so many arrows have been found here. Their burial place was further east, near where Mr. John LEWIS's house stands, under the chimney of which, it is said, is the skeleton of a gigantic Indian, whose bones were not disturbed, though exposed. Indian Hill no doubt has many other graves. Indian arrows, etc., are frequently picked up. Mr. C. NEFF has a fine collection, made within the last two years.\n\nIndian Hill was also the place where they held their grand \"pow-wows:\" trying by dances and incantations to conciliate or communicate with the evil spirit. As they believed the good spirit was too good to hurt anybody, it was not considered necessary to pay so much attention to him, though they made an annual feast to thank him for bountiful harvests, etc. There is a rock by the river, just by the ice house of GILDERSLEEVE & Sons, always known as \"Devil's Rock.\" It bears a mark somewhat resembling a large footprint, and the legend tells that once, when a great pow-wow was in progress, the evil spirit, being invoked, rushed up from the \"Blow hole\" in a whirlwind, seized a young Indian and jumped off the rock with him into the river; leaving the impression of his foot upon the rock. There is an account of one of their pow-wows in DE FOREST's \"History of the Indians of Connecticut.\" In 1734, a man named Richard TREAT attempted to educate the Wangunks. He instructed 12 or 14 children, and held also a meeting for religious instruction for such of the Indians as would attend. At the end of four months, however, finding no one disposed to assist or reward him, he gave up his efforts.\n\nHe found the Wangunks without the most elemental knowledge of the Christian religion or scriptures. He \"was obliged in his controversies with them to appeal to such principles of morality and natural religion as they held among themselves.\" He was also hindered by their imperfect understanding of English as well as by their aversion to the humbling doctrines of Christianity. He met with many rebuffs and much discouragement. A writer of those days declared that:\n\n\"The Indians are famous, especially for there Scandalous Qualities; They are Lazy Drones and love Idleness Exceedingly, they are also most impudent Lyars and will invent Reports and Stories at a strange and monstrous rate; and they are out of measure Indulgent unto their Children, there is no Family government among them.\"\n\nSoon after his school and religious services had been given up, TREAT visited the tribe, and found them holding a grand funeral dance. There was a great uproar; all were frantically dancing, yelling, and calling upon the evil spirit for some communication in reference to the deceased Indian, who was supposed to have been poisoned or bewitched. Mr. TREAT rushed among them, and by vigorous exertions, corporeal and spiritual, succeeded in breaking up the orgy. Though they at first told him he should not preach, and even threatened personal violence, in order to get rid of him they promised, if he would go to a clump of trees at a little distance, they would come and listen to him. When he withdrew, however, the pow-wowing recommenced. He renewed his remonstrances, and the same transparent ruse was used to insure his absence. But at last the Indians, \"wearied by his persistence, or having obtained all the information form infernal sources they desired, desisted, and this has been called their last pow-wow;\" but a trustworthy tradition says, that after most of the Wangunks had scattered among other tribes, they would occasionally return and hold a pow-wow under the Great Elm, near St. John's Chapel.\n\nThe morning a party of them were removing to the Western Reserve, they told Mr. STEWARD, \"Indian spirits cry, cry, in the woods all night.\" Indian names of places are very expressive and beautiful. Pacansett means, \"the place where a strait widens;\" naag, \"a point of land;\" pasinchoag, \"meadow on the northside of a creek.\" Wangunk has been defined Mesawmesick, Mesomesick, and Mesomussuck, &c. Mr. J. Hammond TRUMBULL translates thus: Massa-Monussuck, a hill or declivity; literally, \"a great down-going.\" In Mr. TRUMBULL's book on Indian names, he quotes Dr. CHAPIN's interpretation, viz., \"great rattlesnake place,\" or \"abundance of rattlesnakes,\" a name so appropriate we could wish it more correct. The interpretation which generally obtains among our citizens is this: An Indian was sent to view the place, it having been proposed to the Indians to live there; he returned saying, \"me saw me sick.\"\n\nEARLY SETTLERS.\n\nLand was granted, on the east side the river, to William CORNWELL and Robert WEBSTER, as early as 1653, and John HALL and Nathaniel WHITE owned land there at that time. \"Att a towne meeting Ferbarrary 21st 1658 the towne did chuse Samuel STOCKIN, Natt BACON, Ickbord WARNER, fore committee to vewe the upland uppone the east side of the great River, in order to ane equall divition, as the towne shal give them order,\" and 24 men are mentioned who whould have \"them equall proportion of the divition.\"\n\nIn 1666, the town voted \"that for this present yere insuing all improved land for corne and gras on the east side of the great river, shall be free from molestation by cattel or cretres belonging to the towne as it has bene heretofore, and cattel which shall treapas heare shall be poundable,\" and John SAVAGE was appointed pounder for the other side. Some, however, seemed to object to the pound, and a fine was collected of one who pulled it down. Perhaps for this reason it was, in 1670, voted \"That ye east side the River should stil be deemed to ly as a common field.\" But in 1701-2, the pound was erected \"near the hous of John GILL,\" and it was ordered \"that this should be the place for branding all horse kind on that side.\" The owners of these lands may have cultivated them, coming over in boats and returning to Middletown at night. There is a tradition that two men swam over from Cromwell, with their clothes in a bundle on their heads, and back at evening.\n\nThere is certainly some reason to suppose that there were several settlers on the east side before the year 1700, but there is only record of three.\n\nThe first inhabitant of Portland mentioned is James STANCLIFF. February 24th 1686-7, the town \"approved of the agreement made by the selectmen with James STANCLIFF, concerning the building the chimneys, and other stone work, and that when the work is finished the town empower the selectmen to give the said James STANCLIFF legal assurance of a parcel of land upon the rocks, according to their agreement;\" and it was recorded to James STANCLIFF, May 3d 1690, \"on a small parcel of land on the east side the great River, Lying upon the Rocks, containing fourty nine rods, Lying in a square, being seaven Rods in breath, & seaven Rods in Length, measured from the top of the bank of the River and so easward seaven Rods bounded on the great River west, and on the Common or town land east, north, and south.\" His house stood there, \"founded upon the rock,\" in 1690. How long it had stood there then there are no means of knowing. The town, in 1696, granted him another half acre, \"on the south side his lot not intruding upon the Rocks.\" This house stood on what is now Middlesex Quarry, and at least some part of it was standing 50 years ago.\n\nJohn GILL also built a house upon the bank about the same time, as is supposed, south and west of Mr. Frank BRAINERD's. This was also standing in a dilapidated condition, within the memory of some still living. These houses had probably been altered and added to since their original erection, but stood on the same sites.\n\nWilliam CORNWELL settled back of Wangunk Meadow soon afterward. The following is a copy of the deed given to him by his father 100 before the Revolution: \"This writing made the fourteenth of November in the yeare on thougalnd, six hundred, seventy, and six, Between Sargt william CORNWELL Senior of Midleton in this county of Hartford and colony of connicttectut of the on part, and his sons william CORNWELL and Samuell CORNWELL of the same towne of Midleton and county of Hartford and colony of conicttectut on the other part; Witnesseth that the fore sayd Sargt William CORNWELL for and in consideration of the full and just sume of eighty pounds sterling to him in hand payd or secured to be payd before the ensealing hereof and for Diuers other good causes him their unto mouing haue granted, giuen, Aliened, bargagned, sould, & confirmed and by these presents Doe fully, clearly, & absolutely giue, grant, aliene, bargaine, sell enfeoff & confirm unto his sons afore sayd William and Samuell CORNWELL and to their heirs for euer on parcel of meadow Land at Womgonk on the east side the great Riuer with the swampe adjoining to it being about twelue Acres Abutting on undevided Land south and north, and on the croked brooke west & on the foote of the hill east, and on parcel of playn land adjoining to the fore sayd meadow and swampe containing abought fifteene Acres Litle more or lesse Abutting on Samuel CORNWELLs Land south & on undeuid land north and on the fore sayd meadow and swampe west a& on undeuided land east and on parcel of meadow at Wongonke commonly called the Round meadow, being Near six Acres or their abought, part within and part without the fence which now standeth and the reuertion & reuertions remainder and remainders Rents & yearly Profits of all & giue these the sayd premises and euery part & parcel their of to haue and to hold the fore sayd parcels of Land with all their appurtances before by these presents bargained, sould, or mentioned intended to be hearby granted, aliened bargained, sould, and confirmed and euery part & parcel thir of unto the fore sayd William CORNWELL junior and Samuell CORNWELL their heirs, Executors Administrators & assign for euer & the sayd Sarg't William CORNWELL at the time of Ensealing & Deliuery of these presents is & standeth Lawfully seesed of the premises & that he hath full power and just right to sell the same and euery part & parcel their of & that the afore sayd parcels of Land with all their appurtances shall from hence forth for euer remain and continue unto his sayd sons William and Samuell CORNWELL their heirs, Executors, Administrators & assigns, fully, freely, & clearly acquitted, exonourated, & Discharged off & from al & all manner of former & other bargaines, salles, gifts, grants, Dowers, jointures, Leases, rents, charges, annuities uses entavls judgements for fitures Executions Instusions, morgages, fines, Isues amersments & Incombrances what so euer had made committed or wittingly or willingly Suffered or done by the sayd Sar'nt William CORNWELL his heirs and assigns or by his or their means, act, consent, purity or procurement or by any other person or persons what so euer Lawfully clayming from by or under him them or any of them and that it is Enroled to him in the Books of records in Midleton and shall be lawful for them the sayd william CORNWELL & Samuell CORNWELL to alter the Enrolment theirof & to record the same to them selues their heirs & assigns for euer in Witness where of the sayd John CORNWELL & John HALL junior by the appointment of their father Sarg'nt William CORNWELL hee being not able to signe it haue signed sealed and Deliuered this writing\n\n\"John CORNWELL.\n\n\"John HALL.\n\nSigned, sealed, & Deliuered in presence of\n\n\"John HALL.\n\n\"Jonue CORNWELL.\n\n\"Acknowledged before me,\n\n\"Nath: WHITE, Comis'nr.\"\n\nThe spot on which he built his house, and which is included in the above conveyance, is the corner opposite Mr. Den. GOODRICH's on which the sign post stands.\n\nThe settlement grew so that in 1710, 27 men, most of them heads of families, signed the agreement to build a meeting house. Their names may be found in the history of the first church. They were all, probably, from the two first parishes of Middletown. To these were afterward added: Lemuel LEWIS, from the county of Barnstable, Mass.; John PENFIELD, from Bristol, R. I.; Joseph BLAGUE, from Saybrook; and John CHURCHILL, from Wethersfield. The record of these first years in included in the history of the first church and society. In May 1714, the town of Middletown and the General Assembly \"granted the inhabitants of the east side to be a society by themselves.\" They formed the Third Society of Middletown, and all the region comprised in the townships of Chatham and Portland was then known as East Middletown.\n\nIts citizens cleared the forests, killed the wild animals, cultivated their fields, and built their houses, churches, and school houses, as all settlers have done. In solemn \"society or church meeting-for church and town were one-they decided boundaries, built bridges, and laid out highways, disciplined offenders, elected school committees, provided \"firewood for ye youse of ye school,\" managed \"Pacousett field,\" and \"carried on the work of the Gospel in an orthodox way.\"\n\nIn December 1736, it was voted to \"prefer a petition to the town of Middletown that we that are the inhabitants on the east side the great River in Middletown might have liberty to be a town with all the priviledges of a town by ourselves and likewise to pursue the petition if the town shall grant us these priviledges to the Gen. Assembly in May or Oct. next.\"\n\nBuy not yet was the ambitious townlet to be loosed from the safe apron-strong of mother Middletown; although the \"great River\" rolling between, and the difficulty and danger of its crossing (hindrances to inter-communication which two centuries have not removed) showed that its independence was but a matter of time.\n\nNovember 29th 1757.-\"Capt John FISK, Capt John CLARK, and Joseph WHITE were chosen a committee for to joyn with Middle Haddam and Easthampton in petitioning the town of Middletown for their consent that we on the east side the great River in Middletown should be a township by ourselves, provided the place of town meetings shall never be carried farther Eastward than where Mr. John CHURCHILL now lives.\" Ten years after this, the desired consent having been obtained from Middletown, a petition was preferred to the General Assembly \"that the 3d Society might be a township by themselves, with this condition; that the place for town meetings and to do all publick business Be attended at our own meeting house in ye afore said 3d Society.\"\n\nThe original of this petition for town privileges is now in the State Library in the Capitol at Hartford. It states the difficulty of transaction public business, \"ye other side of ye great River, not only on account of ye great distance many of he inhabitants dwell from ye first society, and ye great difficulty that often happens in crossing ye river to ye great hindrance of business,\" etc., and furthermore declares that there were 420 families within the bounds of proposed town. So \"att a general assembly held at Newhaven in Oct. 1767 Chatham was made a town.\" It took its name from Chatham, England, in reference to its shipbuilding, then an important and growing interest in the town.\n\nThe first town meeting was held \"Dec. ye 7th 1767. David SAGE, Moderator, Jonathan PENFIELD was chosen clerk and sworn, Capt. Jeremiah GOODRICH, Dea. Benj. HARRIS, Mr. Silas DUNHAM, Mr. Ebenezer WHITE, Mr. Abiel CHENY were the selectmen.\" There were also elected, constables, listers (assessors) grand jurors, tything men, collectors, a committee to settle with Middletown, highway surveyors, fence viewers, leather sealers, hog haywards, and a committee to lay out the highways. It may be said here that the qualifications for freemen were \"that they be of a peaceable and civil conversation and otherwise qualified by law.\" Town meetings were held at the meeting house of the 1st Society until the 8th of April 1799, when they met in the (then) \"new town house,\" on PENFIELD Hill. This stood on the corner opposite Mrs. Van VECTENS, and it is remembered by a few of our elders as the \"old town house.\" Though small and inadequate, it was used till 1841, when Portland was set off, and the Episcopal society gave their old church edifice to the town for a town house, and it has so remained.\n\nIn the old map or chart of Chatham, made by Ebenezer WHITE (1st) in 1767, is found the settlement back from the river on the hills, where now in the pastures may be seen old cellars and patches of lilac and asparagus, far from any habitation. In the woods near Captain Harley CASE's may be seen the ruined foundations of 25 or 30 houses; the owners of which many years ago emigrated to regions more favorable to farming operations. The best preserved of these (though a ruin) is just beyond Captain CASE's, that of his grandfather, and here stood the well whose \"old oaken bucket\" figured in the Centennial as the bucket from which General Washington drank, while on his way to New York. To return to the old chart, two ferries are marked, one from the foot of the lane by Mr. Joseph GLADWIN's, to Cromwell, which was much more used than at present; the other at Brush Pond-some distance below the railroad track, running to Ferry street, in Middletown. The main road ran from the ferry through Pacasuett, over \"Hall Hill\" to PENFIELD Hill, and on past Mr. Lucius STEWART's. It is here marked the Pacausett and New London Turnpike. This highway was laid out in 1659. There were two quarries: \"Brush Pond Quarry,\" below the railroad, and \"Shailor and Hall Quarry.\" There were a few houses at that end of the town, but the \"main street\" was an uninhabited highway. \"LEWIS' yard\" occupied the place very nearly that GILDERSLEEVE's now does. There were several houses here, as this was then the principal industry of the town. The only \"meeting house\" (the second built by the First Society) stood upon its hill in solitary state.\n\nSlavery existed to a certain extent. Every prominent family owned one or more Negroes, who were well cared for and kindly treated. \"Guinea\" was a Negro owned by the Rev. Mr. BARTLETT. When nearly a century old he came back and boasted to an incredulous generation of having himself reaped and threshed four hundred bushels of grain on \"Hall Hill.\" Cato and Phyllis were two servants of Ebenezer WHITE. A sketch of Cato is obtained by snatches, from Mr. WHITE's journal. That he was a favored servant may be inferred from the fact that on several occasions when \"Cato's teeth ached\" \"he did nothing that day.\" Cato may be followed through the pages of this diary as he dresses flax, goes to Great Hill for shingle stuff, lath stuff, and timber for cart hubs; as he mows, and hoes, and reaps, and cuts wood for ye fires, but on the 4th of June 1781, \"Self and Cato went to Hartford. Cato Inlisted in ye Continental Service in ye Connt Line for ye term of three years. I gaue a bill of Sale of him to Capt. Nehemiah LYON of Woodstock and said LYON Gaue him on consideration of his sd Cato Inlisting as one of ye Cota of ye town of Woodstock a Bill of Emancipation.\" The 8th of June is the entry, \"this is the last day Cato worked for me.\" Every reader will be glad to learn that on the 6th of June 1783, \"Cato came home being Discharged from ye Army.\" After this he took up his old duties, but received wages, and was called \"Cato FREEMAN.\" The following is a bill of sale of a negro girl bought by Mr. Michael STEWART, who was the owner of several slaves: \"Know all men by these presents that I Matthew TALCOTT of Midleton in the County of Hartford in the Colony of Connecticut, in consideration of the Sum of Seventy Pounds Current Money to me in hand paid by Michael STEWART of Colchester in the county and colony aforesd the Rect whereof I the said Matthew TALCOTT do hereby acknowledge and Do Bargain, Sell, Convey, and Confirm unto the said Michael STEWART his heirs and assigns one negro girl named Flora aged about eighteen years to have and to hold the said Negro Girl named Flora unto the said Michael STEWART his heirs and assigns to his and their own sole, and proper use, benefit and behoof and I the said Mathew TALCOTT do Covenant for my Self, my heirs, Executors, and Administrators to and with the s'd Michael STEWART his heirs and assigns in manner and form following that is to Say that att and untile the Ensealing of these presents I am the true, sole, and lawful owner of the said Negro Girl named Flora and have good Right to sell and dispose of s'd Girl as afores'd free from all incumbrances, and further more I the said Matthew TALCOTT do promise for myself and my heirs to warrant and defend the s'd Negro Girl Flora unto the said Michael STEWART his heirs and assigns against all lawful claim, it witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and Seal this 3d Day of December Anna Dom: 1741.\n\n\"Mathew TALCOTT.\n\n\"Signed, Sealed and Delivered in presence of\n\n\"John RICHARD, Anne RICHARDS.\"\n\nSome idea may be gathered of what it was to build a house in those days, from the old journals before referred to. February 7th 1774, the chimney having first been built, they went to Great Hill to get the frame of the house, and the splitting of lath and sawing of clapboards went on until August 13th, when they were making window frames and lath for \"ye negro rooms;\" the 17th, they laid the parlor floor; September 26th, Ever STOCKING was laying the chamber floor, lathing, painting, and making \"ye closets.\" It took him one day to make a door. The house was ready for occupancy some time in October. This house, which it took eight months to build with no lack of workmen, apparently has lasted just a century. It is probably the house in which Edgar HALE now lives. Another house was built in 1788, perhaps that now occupied by Mr. KILBY. The old SAGE house belongs to this time. It was built about 150 years ago, and long occupied by Deacon David SAGE. It stands on the hill just east of the Congregational parsonage. The frame of the house in which Mr. D. GOODRICH lives is very old. It was formerly the \"old CHURCHHILL place.\" It has been kept in such good repair that few would think of its century and a half. The oldest house in town is the one in which Mr. Horace WILCOX now lives; it is more than 200 years old. Every nail in its clapboards was wrought by hand. Mr. D. GOODRICHES', formerly the CHURCHILL house, is about as old, at least the frame, but has not been kept in repair. The house now occupied by Mr. Jerry BUTTON is more than a century old.\n\nThe first tavern was near Glastonbury, kept by Asaph ABBEY. Zebulon PENFIELD kept one on PENFIELD Hill, a hundred years ago, and the hotel kept by a Mr. WILLIAMS, in the building now occupied by Mr. BRANSFIELD, is of still more recent date; it was given up less than 40 years since. Reverence has been made to the journals of Hon. Ebenezer WHITE, one of the most distinguished citizens of the town in early days. This record covers 60 years of a very busy life. He began when a young man of 28, under the rule of \"Our Sovereign Lord, George\" etc., and laid down his pen a citizen of a country to the freedom of which he had contributed in many ways. There is but one break in this record, but that an unfortunate one. The books were lent, and when returned the one from 1775 to 1779 was missing. It is thought that a few extracts will be interesting to many. The first given related to incongruous, but simultaneous occurrences. \"Daniel White is one year old to-day, and this day is ye terrible fight at Lake George.\" A month later, October 1755, they were \"moeing for Capt SAVAGE\" and \"planting Sergt GIBBS field for ry.\" These men were with the army. \"First Day of April 1756 now men are a Listing to go into ye War in our Government's service.\" \"April ye 12th I took ye Freemans oath.\" \"ye 26th warning a muster.\" \"May ye 3d Viewing Arms.\" 6th of May 1782 \"Self Drawed attachment for ---- then Drawed Deed for ----- Drawed warrant against-----planted corn. Danl gone to Training this p. m.\" All this \"Drawing\" in a day.\n\n\"22d of October Self pulling beans, and Tryd Case for profane Swearing.\" \"11th December 1783 this is Thanksgiving Day throughout ye United States for a General peace.\" \"13th September 1785 This day Nabby went on a Voyage to Boston.\" Just before this great event there was bought in Middletown \"4 ½ yards Merene at three shillings a yard,\" and \"two lutestring gowns at Hartford.\" \"15th day of July 1792, Sabbath; Mr. MORTON preached his first Performance in ye pulpit.\"\n\nThroughout the journals the Sabbath days are marked by a star, and the texts carefully noted, sometimes with a remark, as, \"a laboured sermon,\" a \"painful sermon,\" &c. \"17th of September 1793 Rainy forenoon; afternoon training, Captains BIDWELL and AMES with ye Compy meet at ye Meeting House.\" \"4th Day of July 1798. This Day the people make a great Fuz about Independence & Burnt much Powder.\" \"8th of April 1799. This day ye freemen to ye number of about two hundred and sixty met in ye new town house ye first time.\" \"Feb. 22d 1800. Self attending the meeting for celebrating the death of Gen WASHINGTON as recommended by the president. Mr. STRONG delivered a sermon.\" \"10th Day of Aprill 1800 this Day ye Female meeting at Mr. STRONGs with their Compliment.\" \"May 24 1801 Mr. STRONG preach'd a funeral Sermon on ye account of Wm. DIXON jr being drowned by turning ye anker out of ye boat.\" \"7th of July 1803 Dan'l and Bragg mow'd all Siah meadow on ye north of ye great ditch from ye East end to ye old WARNER line; they Soposed they mow'd abt 5 ½ acres.\" This has come down to posterity as a wonderful feat with the scythe.\n\n\"Nov 15th 1804 this day Dan'l a son born wh he calls Ebenezer.\" \"July 4th 1805 this is my birth Day which completes my 78th year.\" After this, the entries are more scattering, the firm, clear handwriting so familiar to those who study the early records of our town, grow fainter and more uncertain.\n\nHere are few prices gathered from old account books; a bill of 1761:\n\n\"Return MEGGS Dr. \"To 22 loads of wood drawed to ye river £ s. d. nere HURLBURTS as me a Greed 2 15 0 \"Credit to one Beaver hat 1 14 0 \"to one Castor hat 1 00 0 \"2 14 0\" Two loads of wood were balanced by a pair of shoes: \"Sent by Mr. GILL to New York to be layed £ s. d. out in books 3 4 0\" \"1 baylies dicionary 2 \"WATT's logick 7 6 \"Every man his own lawyer. 9\"\n\n\"One hard and nale of Taffety, £3 5s'\" two handkerchiefs \"for one own youse,\" one shilling ten pence apiece. A pound of butter cost three pence. Rum was plenty and cheap; brought from New York it was two shillings seven pence a gallon. In 1780, an ounce of Peruvian bark cost $12, and a \"viol of Balsam of honey bought at Hartford $40.\" These high prices were partly owing to the depreciation of Continental money. Shad could be bought for three pence. \"7 wgt of sugar for a hard dollar; one pound tobacco, three pence; two oz. Pepper, one shilling four pence; an iron kettle; seventeen shillings; frying pan, £1; 1 pare shoe buckles, 4s; 10d.; one sword, £3; 10s; 3 ½ yds of blue cloth for a coat at 15s. a yard; 1 pare worsted stockings, 18s.\n\nTo close this account of the early history of the town a few weather notes gathered partly from the journals, and party form other sources are given.\n\nIn 1755, this section suffered from a severe drought. November 18th 1755, \"two hours before day was a terrible earthquake.\"\n\nThe 19th of May 1780, there was \"thunder and rain in the morning; it slaked raining perhaps about 9 of ye clock and then came on a Darkness and continued until about ye middle of ye Day; he whole face of ye sky was of a yellowish Cast, and even ye Air to y't Degree as a to Color Cloths that were abroad and so Dark y't ye school was Dismissed, ye children could not see to read. It appeared to be Cloudy, no great wind nor rain, and spoke of as ye most rare Phenomenon, and many much Surprised and put y'm in mind of ye Day of Judgment.\" This was the \"Dark Day\" when the Connecticut Legislature refused to adjourn.\n\nHere are a few snow days: January 9th 1780, \"so Exceeding deep and drifted was ye snow that not one half was rode to ye meeting and it was most exceeding cold, sharp, and severe that ever I knew.\" We know it was no ordinary storm which could keep the early inhabitants from the \"meeting.\" It even blocked the wheels of State. \"Jan. 12th,\" writes the honorable member of the General Assembly from Chatham, \"I wait at Hartford until night, no Assembly, ye Govenr not come to town and but few of ye members, by reason of ye great snow, and no paths.\" The next Sabbath even \"only a few with great difficulty got to ye Meeting house.\" This winter is mentioned, by several writers, as unusually severe throughout New England. In July 1779, a sever hail storm passed over Chatham at the time of rye harvest. \"It destroyed the grain in its course, broke windows, and left marks on buildings and fences which could be seen a year afterwards.\" The hail appeared to be uneven pieces of ice, many of them nearly as large as a hen's egg.\n\nMay 5th 1780, a frost killed beans and squashes and \"ye name of ye corn.\" The 20th of May 1795, there was also a hard frost, which was credited with killing the canker worms, along with all other tender things. The 8th of May 1803, \"was a Storm of snow in such quantity that by 10 o'clock its depth on the ground was four inches. My family rode to meeting in a slay. Remarkable to see fruit trees all in blossom and loaded with snow.\"\n\nThe most remarkable freshets which are recorded as occurring in Chatham are as follows: December 1703, the meadows were \"alarmingly flooded.\" The 11th of February 1781, was an \"exceeding high flood.\" July 13th 1795, there was for 24 hours, \"an excessive rain, water covers all ye lower swamp so that ye bridge floats. The upper swamp is covered one foot and a half deep at our west end and ye whole of our meadow except ye highway noles.\"\n\nFrom December 14th 1800, the 25th of the same month, there \"was no passing across ye meadow.\"\n\nTwentieth of March 1801, \"Last night the water rose as it is said six feet perpendicular; and now ye water is above ye post fence at ye meadow gate. The oldest man Living does not remember such a sudden Rise of water & so great at this time of year.\"\n\n\"The 1st of April the water was found to be two feet deep on the top of the highest knoll, and the waters were so high and violent that they tore the banks to pieces in many places.\"\n\nThere was also a remarkable flood in October 1843, at the time the corn was being gathered in. The water rose so fast that in a few hours the bridges were covered and the meadow was impassible, except by boats. The men worked all night, part of the time in boats, to save the crop of corn.\n\nThe freshet of 1854 was the most remarkable within the memory of living men. \"Strickland street\" was flooded, and the shipyard was under water. John MCKAY, who lived in the house now occupied by Mrs. LAWRENCE, on the river bank, died. William NORCOTT and others took the coffin out of the window into a boat and carried it to Henry CONKLIN's house, where the funeral services were held. The coffin was again put in the boat and rowed to the steps of the eastern (Center) church. At the same time the quarries were flooded, and the water rose to the second story of many houses on the sandbank, and pigs' noses could be seen sticking out of garret windows. In 1816, it is said, there was a frost in some part of the town at least every month in the year. But the last frosts of May 29th and June 1884, were the more distructive and later in the season than any recorded in the town.\n\nThe coldest day on record in this town was January 27th 1873. The thermometer indicated a temperature of 29° below zero.\n\nINDIAN WARS.\n\nAlthough this part of Connecticut did not suffer from Indian depredations and cruelty as had other parts, the people here furnished men to assist their more afflicted brethren, rightly considering, says an old writer, \"that if the fire of this were not timely extinguished it would endanger their own fabrick.\" Major John SAVAGE was a distinguished Indian fighter. The old Narrative of the Indian Wars speaks of \"Ensign SAVAGE, that young martial spark, scarce twenty years of age, had at one time one bullet lodged in his thigh, another shot through the brim of his hat by ten or twelve of the enemy discharging upon him together, while he boldly held up his colors in the front of his company.\" He died in Chatham, in 1775. It is said there was a tract of land set off to him, in Virginia, as a reward for his services. The only son of Rev. Mr. NEWELL fell in battle, some time in 1755. How many men went from Chatham to join the expedition against Canada cannot be certainly known. In April 1756, men enlisted in Chatham, and \"June ye 16th they marched for Crown Point.\" Several from this town were at the assault on Quebec. The following letter, preserved in the Sage family, mentioned three of these: \"Dec. 24, 1775. To Esqr. Sage.\n\n\"I write a word to inform you of us here at Quebeck, the notice is short and David not Present, but he is well and harty; but has been sick, but I think I never saw him for fleshe, father can inform you of our travel and affairs. The men that came from Chatham are all well and harty but Goff and he will soon be so; but I fear the Small Pox will be too frequent among us for good.\n\n\"Sam'll COOPER.\"\n\nRichard STRICKLAND fought at Quebec, and died on the way home, of small-pox contracted camp. Lieutenant David SAGE (who is mentioned in the letter) was wounded at the time of the assault. He afterward died of small-pox, and was buried under the walls. Captain HANCHETT, Lieutenant SAVAGE, James KNOWLES, and others from Chatham, were present at the siege.\n\nTHE REVOLUTION.\n\nAt the first sign of the coming conflict with Great Britain the men of Chatham prepared to assist their brethren and assert their own rights by appointing a vigilant committee of 11 to carry out the recommendations of Congress for \"non importation, non exportation, and non consumption of British goods.\" Chatham took prompt action upon all the recommendations of the General Assembly or the Council of Safety, and assisted in the struggle for liberty as well with stout supporters of the government at home, as with fighting men abroad. They took the oath of fidelity to the State as is shown by the records; 62 voters taking this oath at one time, administered by Ebenezer WHITE, and 58 at another time, and by tens and dozens all through the early years of the war. Marcy 17th 1777, the town appointed a committee, and directed them to engage on behalf of the town to provide necessaries for the families of the soldiers belonging thereto, \"who shall engage and go into any of the Continental battalions, agreeable to the recommendation of his honor, the Governor and Committee of Safety in a proclamation.\" Also voted \"that the soldiers enlisted into the Continental Army shall be provided with necessaries and committees appointed in every parish to procure such necessaries.\" It was also voted to provide clothing for continental soldiers.\n\nThe selectmen for the year 1777, where Ebenezer WHITE, David SAGE, Col. John PENFIELD, Enoch SMITH, Deacon David SMITH, John HINCKLEY, and William WELSH.\n\nApril 19th 1779, it was \"voted that the Committee of Supply shall have liberty to draw money from the town treasury to provide for families of Continental soldiers,\" and the town treasurer should borrow money if needful to supply the committee of supply. Capt. Joseph CHURCHILL, Deacon Jeremiah BRADFORD, and John NORTON were this committee of supply.\n\nJanuary 5th 1779, Ebenezer WHITE paid $160 for eight bushels of wheat \"for ye Continental service.\" It was voted that the selectmen of the town should class the inhabitants in as many classes as there were soldiers to provide for, and each class to provide for one. The selectmen this year were Dr. Moses BARTLETT, Col. John PENFIELD, Capt. Joseph KELLOGG, Deacon David SMITH, Capt. Joseph DART, Capt. Silas DUNHAM, Capt. Timothy PERCIVAL.\n\nIn the year 1780, £200 a year was voted for the families of those soldiers who had enlisted for the war, and £50 for those who had enlisted for three years only, to be drawn from the town treasury by the committee of supply; and more money could be drawn if this were insufficient. It was also voted to tax the inhabitants of the town to raise a bounty to encourage soldiers to enlist for three years or during the war.\n\nNovember 14th 1780, was a town meeting \"for ye purpose of raising Provision & filling up ye Continental Army.\" A tax of six pence on the pound on the list of the town was voted to provide provisions for Continental soldiers. A committee was appointed to ascertain the number of soldiers in service and to class the town. This committee consisted of \"Cols. PENFIELD and BLAGUE and Lieut. SMITH before mentioned, and Hez'h GOODRICH Doct. Jer'h BRADFORD, Capt. Daniel BRAINARD, Capt. Elijah COOK, Capt. Bryan PARMELEE, Capt. Stephen BRAINARD.\"\n\nThese quotations from the records *[For other extracts from the records see history of the town of Chatham.] are sufficient to prove that Chatham nobly did its part in filling up the Continental armies with good soldiers, relieving them at the same time of all anxiety in regard to the care of their families in their absence, and strengthened the government by every available means.\n\nNow it is purposed to follow, as well as may be by means of vague and meager records, some of the soldiers who left their homes in Chatham to join the Continental armies at the front. At the time of the \"Lexington Alarm,\" in April 1775. Capt. Silas DUNHAM marched whose names have been found on an old pay roll in the State Archives. Timothy PERCIVAL was lieutenant; Isaac KNEELAND, clerk; Marcus COLE, sergeant. The privates were: Stephen OLMSTEAD, Ralph SMITH, Samuel KILBOURN, Samuel HALL, David HALL, Caleb COOK, John JOHNSON, Nehemiah DAY, Silvanus FREEMAN, William WHITE, Samuel SEXTON, Benjamin KNEELAND, Thomas HILL, Daniel CLARK, Amos CLARK, Elijah CLARK, Hezekiah GOFF, Samuel FREEMAN, William BEVIN, Daniel PARK, Elijah BALY, Daniel MARCHALL, Lazerous WATROUS, Nathaniel MARKHAM, Elisha CORNWELL, John NORTON, Ezra ACKLEY, David CASWELL, Ezra PURPLE, Joshua BAILY, James JOHNSON, jr., Nathaniel GANSEY, Ithamar PELTON. They were five days in service on this expedition. In May 1775, the companies of Chatham were joined to those of Middletown to form the Twenty-third Regiment. During the year 1776, many from this town were serving in the army, no less than five drafts being made that year on the militia of Connecticut. Each officer and soldier was to be allowed 1s., 6d. for each gun and bayonet used in the service, and for the use of each blanket, 3s. August 20th of this year, Chatham had an order from the General Court for 300 pounds of powder. February 28th 1776, the governor and council decided that the frigate of twenty-eight guns to be built in this state should be built at Chatham on the Conn. River;\" and September 20th of that year the overseers of the furnace at Salisbury were ordered to deliver to the agents for building the Continental ship at Chatham \"twenty-four twelve-pounders, and four six-pounders by their paying at the rate of £3., 10s. per hundred weight for the twelve-pounders and £4 per hundred for the less cannon.\n\nIn August 1776, the militia companies of Chatham were ordered to New York. They were also ordered to Rhode Island, Long Island, and the western borders of their own State. June 27th 1780, the militia of Chatham marched to defend West Point fort under Captain BRAINERD. They held themselves ready to march at an hour's warning to any threatened point. Great were the privations and hardships of these soldiers, who were called to leave their families and business, even were they permitted to return, but what shall be said of the distress of those who were so unfortunate as to be taken prisoners? The number of those who died in the \"Old Jersey\" and other British prisons can never be known. Their sufferings can be inferred from the fact that few of those who escaped or who lived to be released, survived long the effects of their terrible imprisonment. Thomas DEAN, a youth of sixteen, died soon after reaching his home \"from the effects of a cruel imprisonment;\" and there lies in the cemetery near the Center church the grave of Samuel BOARDMAN, \"who in 11 days after his Captivity in New York departed this life Jan 12th 1777, aged 20 years.\" One hundred of the officers and men of the sloop of war Sampson were from Chatham. These were consigned to the Old Jersey, and many perished from cold, and hunger, and the want of the necessaries of life. Timothy CORNWALL, Isaac BUCK, David SAGE, --- BARTLITT, Lemuel LEWIS, and others died from sickness or in prison. Moses PELTON is said to have been killed in the war. It is impossible to obtain the names of those who fell in battle as no list or record of names was kept. At the end of the church record of deaths for the year 1775, of the First Society, is the laconic announcement, \"3 died in the Army,\" and in the year 1776. \"13 died in the Army in different States.\" Yet the full names of all the \"infant sons\" and \"infant daughters\" who died at home are carefully set down by the pastor. We who grope too late among the dusty relics of the century gone can only snatch from obivion here a name, there a half forgotten incident. Not one of the grand names of those who first launched our Ship of State should have been lost, yet great-grandchildren scarce know of the heroic sire, whose deeds and sacrifices should bear fruit in a race higher, nobler than common men. Those three who fell at Lexington or Bunker Hill, foremost among Liberty's martyrs, the 13 heroes of '76, we shall never know their names, their only monument shall be the wide, free country for which their lives were the first installment of the great price to be paid.\n\nA list of Revolutionary soldiers who lived to return home, or who were afterward pensioned, is more easily obtained, through not without much research, and it is probably incomplete.\n\nGen. Seth OVERTON served his country in many ways though he saw little or no active service in the field. He was agent for the government in contracting for the ship Connecticut, which was built in this town.\n\nCol. John PENFIELD died February 22d 1797, aged 66.\n\nCol. Joseph BLAGUE was a Continental officer. He commanded a company in the battle of Saratoga. He then bore the rank of captain, but was afterward promoted for gallant services. General LAFAYETTE gave him, in the presence of WASHINGTON, a beautiful sword as an expression of esteem for him as an officer.\n\nLieutenant, afterward Captain, Daniel STEWART, served through the war. Through the courtesy of Mr. Lucius STEWARD, the writer has been permitted to examine two of his commissions. The first is copied entire:\n\n\"Jonathan TRUMBULL Esq. Capt. General and Commander in Chief of His Majesty's colony of Connecticut in New England; to Daniel STEWART Gent., Greeting,\n\n\"You being by the General Assembly of this colony accepted to be Ensign of the Seventeenth Company or Trainband in the Sixth Regiment in this colony;\n\n\"Reposing special Trust and Confidence in your Loyalty, Courage, and Good Conduct, I do, by virtue of the Letters Patent from the Crown of England to this Corporation, Me thereunto enabling, appoint and Empower You to take the said Company into your Care and Charge as their Ensign carefully and diligently to discharge that Trust; exercising your inferior Officers and Soldiers in the Use of their Arms according the Discipline of War; Keeping them in good Order and Government, and commanding them to obey You as their Ensign for His Majesty's Service. And you are to observe all such Orders and Directions as from Time to Time You shall receive either from Me or from other your Superior Officer pursuant to the Trust hereby reposed in You.\n\n\"Given under my Hand and the Seal of this Colony in Hartford the 19th Day of May, in the 12th Year of our Sovereign Lord George the Third King of Great Britain &c. Annoque Domini 1772.\n\n\"Jonth. TRUMBULL.\n\n\"By His Honour's Command\n\n\"George WYLLIS Secr'y.\"\n\nThe second commission-of captain of the 4th Company or Trainband, in the town of Chatham and bearing date January 1775-is like unto the first with a few slight but very essential changes; it substitutes the \"State of Connecticut,\" and the \"Laws of this State,\" for \"His Majesty's Colony,\" and \"Letters Patent from the Crown.\" It refers to a former commission issued October 15th 1775, perhaps as lieutenant. Captain STEWART was on Long Island, and on one occasion stood near General WASHINGTON when a cannon ball struck the ground under the general's horse. Washington calmly soothed his frightened horse, then rode a little further off.\n\nCapt. John COOPER.\n\nEnsign Daniel SHEPHARD, afterward lieutenant. He died August 22d 1798, aged 76.\n\nSergeant Eber STOCKING served through the war. His cartridge box is still preserved by his descendants. He used to tell his grandchildren that on one occasion when they had bivouacked upon the field, on awaking in the morning, the forms of sleeping soldiers were marked by mounds of snow which had fallen upon them during the night. Sergeant STOCKING was for some years a pensioner. He died August 26th 1828, at the age of 73.\n\nSeymour HURLBURT served seven years in the Continental army. It was said he was \"the first in battle and the last man out.\"\n\nSamuel KILBOURN was sick with \"camp distemper\" (dysentery) at the time of the massacre at Fort Griswold, Groton. When it was seen that an attack was imminent the sick were removed to a barn about two miles distant. Here they remained that night unattended, in the terror and confusion of the time. The drink which had been left for them froze on the surface during the night, and they had not strength to break the thin ice. The scars resulting from this illness with the want of proper care, he carried to his grave. He was over six feet in height, of fine appearance.\n\nDavid HALL was at the battle of Long Island.\n\nAbram SCHELLINX was drafted into the army. He was a chair maker by trade. His apprentice went with him to the war, and at White Plains both his legs were shot off. Abram SCHELLINX was a pensioner, and died October 23d 1821.\n\nMichael STEWART was in the army a short time.\n\nTHE WAR OF 1812.\n\nThe second war with Great Britain did not call for such sacrifice or make such demands upon this town as the struggle for Independence. If any citizens of what is not Portland took an active part in the fighting the fact has not come down to us. But they did all that was required of them when Col. Daniel WHITE marched away with his men to New London, where the time was spent in patrol and sentry duty, and so much was the stern reality of war softened that it seemed like a prolonged picnic. Elizur ABBY was captain; David CRUTTENDEN, lieutenant; John KAY, sergeant. It is related that one party of soldiers returned from the \"scene of war's alarms,\" ingloriously but comfortably, in an ox cart. Col. WHITE rode a fine charger, Pomp, who lived for many years, and when incapacitated for further service by reason of his age, he would still show a martial spirit, and try to curvet and prance as of old, when he heard the music of the drums on training days.\n\nPORTLAND AS IT IS.\n\nThe old town of Chatham covered a large extent of territory, and as its three parishes increased in population, there was naturally talk of dividing the township. This was advocated as early as 1798. At a meeting of the school society of Chatham, on the 27th of September 1798, \"the Question was put whether this Meeting will do anything relative to dividing the town of Chatham? It was voted that this Meeting do approve of the petition which has lately circulated in this Society and is signed by a number of hits inhabitants relative to applying to the General Assembly to incorporate that part of the town of Chatham described in said petition into a distinct town.\"\n\nThe division was made in May 1841; the bounds of the First Society in Chatham being taken for those of the new town. The name first given was Conway, but this was changed to Portland at the same session. This was in reference to the quarries, which resemble in size and the quality of the stone the great sandstone quarries of Portland, England. The first town meeting was held at the Congregational meeting house, the 21st of June 1841, for the purpose of electing officers to serve until the regular town meeting in October. Philip SAGE was clerk, and Henry HALL, moderator. The selectmen appointed were: Edward C. WHITMORE, Lucius E. WALDO, Selden COOK; treasurer, Selden Cook; constable, Samuel WILCOX; grand jurors, Rufus SEARS, Chauncey TAYLOR; tything men, Charles WILLIAMS, Job H. PAYNE, Selden COOK, Edward C. WHITMORE, Ralph PELTON, Enoch SAGE; pound keepers, David SHEPARD, and Jesse GOFF; sealers of weights and measurers, Gilbert GRISWOLD and Daniel Shepard jr.; fence viewers, Agustin OVERTON, Samuel WILCOX, Hiram A. PENFIELD, Guy COOPER, Seth I. DAVIS, Alfred PAYNE, and Whitby FOSTER; haywards, Jacob DUNHAM, Whitby FOSTER, William G. SAVAGE, Ralph GOODRICH; assessor, Selden COOK; treasurer of the town deposit fund, Daniel RUSSEL; highway surveyors and collectors, Whitby FOSTER, Hezekiah G. PELTON, Amos CORNWALL, George M. BROWN, William HALE. It was resolved that the whole of the income of the town deposit fund, the current year, be appropriated to the use of the schools. It was resolved that William R. SMITH, Ralph GOODRICH, and Sylvester GILDERSLEEVE should be the agents or managers of the town deposit fund. Resolutions were also passed relating to alterations of highways if necessary; divisions of town funds with Chatham, and that the poor house should be held jointly with the town of Chatham for the poor of both towns.\n\nIt was resolved that the sign posts heretofore established in the Portland School Society should be confirmed and kept in repair; also \"that the first annual town meeting of the town of Portland shall be held on the first Monday of Oct. next.\" Selden Cook was appointed agent to appear for the town in all suits, etc. The selectmen were instructed to ascertain the property of the town of Chatham, and to make division of the same agreeable to the resolution incorporating the town of Portland. The pounds near Wangunk Meadow and at Pacausett were declared lawful pounds of the town of Portland; the earmarks were ordered to be transferred from the records of Chatham to those of Portland. The selectmen were requested to ascertain the liability of the town of Portland to maintain a road from Chuchill's Landing to Glastonbury, through Wangunk Meadow.\n\nIt was voted that no money should be paid out of the town treasury without an order from the selectmen; that the town clerk should provide all suitable record books; that the selectmen be authorized to employ some person to clean the meeting house; and the thanks of the meeting were tendered to Mr. HALL for the impartial and able manner in which he had performed the duties of moderator. The meeting then adjourned.\n\nAt the first annual meeting, 4th of October 1741, two assessors were appointed, Edward LEWIS and Hiram A. PENFIELD; board of relief, William R. SMITH, Edward A. PENFIELD, Daniel SHEPARD jr.; town clerk, Sylvester STOCKING; treasurer, Edward LEWIS; selectmen, the same as before appointed; constables, Samuel WILCOX, Hiram A. PENFIELD. A highway tax of two cents on a dollar, and a town tax of the same amount, was voted. Highway surveyors were, Hezekiah G. PELTON, Hiram A. PENFIELD, Harley CASE, Ralph PELTON, Benjamin ABBEY; collector of taxes, Hiram A. PENFIELD: grand jurors, Charles WILLIAMS, Alfred MYRICK, Chauncey TAYLOR, Alfred PAYNE; tything men, James W. WHITE, Jonathan FULLER, Job H. PAYNE, Seth I. DAVIS, Chester PELTON, Sylvester STOCKING; treasurer of town deposit fund, William R. SMITH; Hayward, Seth Il DAVIS, Whitby FOSTER, Alfred HALL, Henry S. CONKLING. The same sealers of weights and measurers, and the same pound keepers, were reappointed. Whitby FOSTER, Hiram A. PENFIELD, and David CORNWALL were appointed a committee to divide the town into highway districts. The fence viewers appointed were: Phillip H. SELLEW, Ralph GOODRICH, David CRITTENDEN, Erastus STRONG, Samuel WILCOX, John R. AMES, Seth I. DAVIS, and Daniel F. HOPKINS. The selectmen were instructed to discontinue the highway from Churchill's Landing, through Wangunk Meadow, to Glastonbury. Resolutions were passed relative to the funds deposited with the State, by the United States, in pursuance of Act of Congress, and William R. SMITH was appointed the town's agent to receive the town's share of such funds. April 4th 1842, Kellogg STRONG was chosen the first representative of the town in the General Assembly. The 26th of May 1845, the town voted to accept the old church of the Episcopal society, and the deed thereof was received by the town, and it was voted to hold town meetings there. Some repairs and alterations being made, the town house was first used for a town meeting, October 6th 1845. May 24th 1851, it was unanimously voted to direct the selectmen to petition the Legislature, in the name of the town of Portland, for liberty to loan the credit of this town to aid in constructing the New York & Boston Railroad, commonly known as the Air Line Railroad, within the limits of this State, to an amount not exceeding $20,000.\n\nOctober 3d 1853, an appropriation of $300 was voted for the erection of a lockup or house of detention, provided the citizens of Portland would raise $200 more by subscription.\n\nNothing more is recorded than the usual proceedings each year till 1861. January 30th of that year, several resolutions were passed at town meeting, supporting the Constitution of the United States and of this State, both of which as freemen they had sworn to support, and deprecating the agitation of abstract political dogmas, especially by the pulpit and the press. Objecting to the \"fanactical efforts of John Brown to overthrow slavery by force,\" and urging the maintenance of peace, and \"hushing the loud call to arms.\"\n\nJuly 28th 1862, it was resolved by a vote of yeas 67, nays 55,\n\n\"That the Selectmen be directed to pay from the town treasury the sum of $100 to every volunteer who may be ensiled into the regiments now being raised or filled in this State, under the recent call from the President for three hundred thousand more troops. And if there shall not be sufficient funds in the treasury, then the selectmen are authorized to borrow money on the credit of the town to make up the deficiency. This bounty not to be paid to more than our quota under the above call, and on condition that all such enlistments shall be on or before the 1st of September 1862.\n\nIt was afterward voted that all who had enlisted in excess of the town's quota should receive the same bounty. August 5th 1863, at a special town meeting, it was voted to pay a bounty of $300 to each person drafted into the service of the United States, and the sum of $15,000 was appropriated for this purpose. September 30th 1863, the town appropriated $10,000 for the support of such of the drafted men's families or dependents as should need such pecuniary assistance. The soldiers and their families also received much aid aside from this. The ladies of Portland met frequently to make clothing, scrape lint, and make gallons of blackberry cordial which was sent with many other comforts and delicacies to their soldiers in the army or in hospitals.\n\nThe officers of the town of Portland, elected October 1st 1883, were:\n\nAssessors: William H.

S. GILDERSLEEVE was appointed January 29th 1861. He resigned January 1st 1864, and Joseph C. GLADWIN was appointed till the next town meeting.

BARTLETT was appointed October 1866, and has since held the office.\n\nEvelyn WHITE has served twelve terms as selectman, and Nelson PELTON fourteen. Want of space forbids a more complete list of selectmen.\n\nSCHOOLS.\n\nThe town of Middletown, at a town meeting held January 9th 1701/2, made this grant of land to the inhabitants on the east side:\n\n\"Inasmuch as there is a parcel of pond, swamp, and bogga Land about thirty or fourty Acres lying on the east side of the grate River, called Pocowsett, which is not yet Layd out to any person; the town by vote do agree that the neighbors Inhabiting the East side the grate River may clere & improve the said Land until such time as they shall be in A capacity to maintain A schole or a minister, and then the said Land shall be sequestered, and Improved, & ye Income there of shall be disposed of for such publique Use as the town by vote shall ord'r.

That they believed in \"rotation in office\" is proved by the fact that in 39 committees, appointed from 1711 to 1750, there were 100 persons and 58 distinct names. Usually new men were elected each year; and two or three years elapsed before any of these same men were called upon to serve in the same capacity.\n\nDecember 27th 1722, it \"was granted to the naibours on the back side of Womgog to have there part of money according to ther List to improve for the teaching ther children.\" This was the present Rose Hill District, and the first to be set off.\n\nDecember 22d 1727.-\"Voted that the south farmers from John PENFIELDS southward and eastward shall have their part of money to Instruct their children in learning, they improving the same with liberty for one year.\" The \"south farmers\" were the settlers of Middle Haddam and East Hampton.\n\nFebruary 1st 1741, they divided the town into three school districts:\n\n\"The Society, for the encourigment of schooling, Agrees by Major vote as followeth; Viz 1st that the society shall be divided into three parts and the first part to begin at the place where Mr. CORNWELL's and MILLER's grist mill now stands and extend eastward as far as the west side of the hil called COLLINGES hil, and from there both southward and westward to the great River; and the next part to contain all that part which lyes eastward of s'd first part, to the extent of the bounds of the society; and the third part to Contain all that which is northward of the fore said two pats to the extent of the society. 2d that for the futor there shall be eleven months school kept in this society yearly; that is six months of it by a good school master for reading and wrighting and five months by a good Mrs. for reading; and what is wanting more than we are to receive out of the town rate and county rate and by the General Assemblys donation and any other donation to enable the school committee as above said, the said term yearly, the remainder shall be raised yearly on the general list of the society and collected 3dly that the school Committee shall have their instructions to order the school to be kept in each of the above said three parts one after another their proportionable part of the time according to their list of estate for the time being; and that where so ever the said school shall be kept it shall be a society school, and each one in the society shall have Liberty to send their children provided they answer a reasonable part about fier wood: and each of the above said parts shall have liberty to build a school house, and that there shall be one comite man in each of the above said parts yearly, Voted, to raise a rate of one penny on the pound to enable the committee to carry on the schools.\"\n\nThe \"grist mill\" here mentioned was on the site now occupied by COX's mill. \"COLLINGES hil\" is just west, so by this division the first district extended from COX's mill and the granite quarry to the river, both south and west, including the larger part of Portland; the second district included Middle Haddam and East Hampton; and the third all the northern part of the (then) society. They now vote to have the school kept eleven months in the year instead of six as had been done. By act of Assembly every town or ecclesiastical society having 70 families must keep a school 11 months in the year, and those with less than 70 families six months. Notice that the schools in these three districts did not hold their sessions simultaneously, but \"one after another their proportionable part of the time;\" Which would of course shorten the period of schooling in each district, the children in some districts having only perhaps two months schooling during the year, others four or five.\n\nDecember 19th 1752; it was \"agreed that the northward part of the Inhabitants in the neck part of this society shall have Liberty to build a school house & draw proportionable part of school money.\" This, of course, was the present District No. I.\n\nIn 1748, a tax of four pence on the pound was laid; in 1749, six pence; in 1754, it was raised to 12d., probably to build the school houses in the different districts. After this the rate was one penny on the pound.\n\nNovember 29th 1757, \"Agreed that the necessary firewood for the use of the school should be provided by parents and masters according to the poles which are sent to school, whoever shall neglect to provide it shall be added to the penny rate.\" The question of \"firewood\" seems to have been a troublesome one; many votes were passed to compel those sending children to provide the wood.\n\nIn 1772, the committee were instructed to provide the wood and \"raise a rate on ye poles of ye children that go to ye s'd schools.\" At first the wood was hauled to the school house door by each one sending children; but the tax for firewood was kept up till within the memory of many now living.\n\nIn 1765, \"Capt. David SAGE, Dea Joseph WHITE, and Lieut Samll HALL were chosen a committee to receive the Donations for the use of the school & particularly what is due to the school from the sale of Norfolk land.\" This was the General Assembly's grant of moneys from the sale of seven townships (Norfolk, Goshen, Canaan, Cornwall, Kent, Salisbury, and Sharon) in what is now Litchfield county, for the support of schools. This grant was made in 1733, and has been referred to as the \"General Assembly's Donation.\"\n\nNovember 7th 1768, it was voted that the Southwest School District \"shall for ye time being keep their school half of ye time at ye old school house and ye other half of ye time at Pacowsett, until ye money raised by Rate and ye Donation & county money be expended.\" The \"old school house\" stood near where the GILDERSLEEVE school now stands, and it was thought too far to send the children from \"Pacowsett.\"\n\n\"Voted also to divide ye northeast District in two parts or Districts; Viz ye north district to come as far south as ye south side of Mr. Jonathan WELLES land, that is to say to ye south side of his lott from east to west, and ye other part to extend south to their old bounds.\"\n\nThis was dividing the district next to Glastonbury from No. 5 (Up City).\n\n\"Voted that ye southeast district of school shall be divided into three parts, those that line on ye short lotts to be one entire District & those on ye north on ye long lotts to run south to ye south side of Mr. STEWART's lotts, so far south as an east and west line of his lott; & ye other part to begin at ye south line of sd STEWART lott and to extend south to ye extent of their old bounds on ye Long lotts.\n\n\"23d Nov. 1784. Voted that the northeast corner of s'd Society shall be made a distinct school district to extend from the east bounds of s'd Society by a north and south line so far west as to include the house in wh. Solomon CHAPMAN now dwels & from Glastonbury Line southward two miles.\" This was a readjustment of the boundaries of District No. 7.\n\nThe 1st of November 1791, Captain Joseph SAGE and Lieutenant Nicholas AMES were chosen to receive and distribute to the several schools, the \"forty shillings on every thousand pounds of the grand Levy, from the State Treasurer.\" This was the State tax.\n\nThe last committee mentioned in the records of the First Society, appointed in 1794, were: Joseph WILLCOX, Welles DIGGINS, Jonathan PELTON, Luther GOODRICH, Richard BROWN, and Abel STRICKLAND; Joseph BLAGUE jr., Nicholas AMES, and John ELLSWORTH were appointed a special committee. The schools now passed from the care of the church or ecclesiastical society into that of the school society. In May 1795, an act was passed which recognized the ecclesiastical societies in a distinct capacity as \"school Societies,\" and in May 1798, the school societies were invested with the powers, and subjected to the duties, which the former laws had given to, and required of, towns and ecclesiastical societies, relative to the same objects, and from this date they known in law as school societies. Their territorial limits were sometimes co-extensive with a town, sometimes included only part of a town, and sometimes embraced parts of two or more towns. This paragraph from the Act of 1795, quoted on the first page of the school society's record, sets forth the standing and duties of the school societies:\n\n\"That all the Inhabitants living within the limits of the located societies who have or may have a right to vote in Town meetings shall meet, some time in the month of October annually, in the way and manner prescribed in the Statute entitled an Act for forming, ordering, and regulating societies, and being so met shall exercise the powers given in and by said Act in organizing themselves, and in appointing the necessary officers as therein directed for the year ensuing; and may transact any other business son the subject of schooling in Generall and touching the monies hereby appropriated to their use in particular, according to Law, and shall have power to adjourn from time to time as they shall think proper.\"\n\nThe record then begins with:\n\n\"Agreeable to the Spirit and intention of the above recited Act of Assembly, the Inhabitants of the first located Society in Chatham met on the last Thursday of Oct., A. D., 1795, at 3 o'clock afternoon, a the meeting house in said society, being Warned by a special Warrant Signed by a justice of the peace together with three of the principal Inhabitants of said Society, Lieut David ROBERTSON was chosen Moderator; Joseph BLAGUE Jun'r was appointed clerk; the usual tax of one penny on the pound was voted; Capt. Nicholas AMES, Joseph BLAGUE Jun'r, and John ELLSWORTH were appointed a committee to Superintend, Order, and Direct the affairs of the school throughout the Society. James STANCLIFT, Samuel WILLCOX, Elisha SHEPARD, Seth STRICTLAND, Samuel BUTLER, and Amos GOODRICH were appointed school committee-men and collectors in the school Districts in which they severally belong. It was voted that the wood expended by the several schools should be paid for by a tax on the polls attending to said schools.\"\n\nJoseph BLAGUE was granted, \"six shillings lawful money for the purchase of a book of records for this Society.\"\n\n\"The next year, 1796, the tax of one penny on the pound was changed to \"five mills on a dollar.\"\n\nThe meeting of February 6th 1799, chose \"Rev'd Cyprian STRONG, Rev'd Smith MILES, Doctor Moses BARTLITT, Doct. Ebenezer SAGE, Joseph BLAGUE Jun'r, Capt. Daniel STEWART, and Mr. Nathaniel CORNWELL as Overseers or Visitors of the schools.\" This was in accordance with the Act of 1798-9. The duties were about the same as those of the present acting visitors.\n\nIt was voted not to levy the usual tax of five mills \"if the interest arising from the sale of the Western Reserve lands should be a sum equal to the whole amount of said tax.\"\n\nNovember 4th 1800, Seth OVERTON, Hezekiah GOODRICH, and Enoch SAGE were appointed to \"set a stake for the place of setting a school House in the PENFIELD district, (so called).\"\n\nIn 1801, it was voted that the district committee should cause every master to be examined by two or more of the visitors before he should be employed as an instructor. In 1803, the Northeast District was divided by annexing four families to the adjoining district of Glastonbury, and others to the adjoining district in Chatham. January 1st 1805, a committee was chosen to affix a place to build a school house in the North Neck District.\n\nDoctor Isaac SMITH and Doctor Isaac CONKLIN were added in 1807 to the school visitors formerly appointed, and in 1812, Rev. Eber L. CLARK was chosen in the place of Rev. Dr. STRONG, deceased. Jesse HALL, Samuel HALL, David STOCKING, and Abner SAGE were also chosen school visitors with those already appointed.\n\nIt was also voted at this meeting that \"the interest arising from the sale of the land which was granted by the town of Middletown in the year 1701/2 to the Inhabitants of the east side of the river for the use of schools, or minister, be applied the present year for the use of public schools.\" This is the grant of land at \"Pacowsett\" mentioned in the beginning of the history of schools.\n\nIn the year 1815, the three eastern districts were \"annexed into one,\" and \"stake was set on the north side of a stone wall 50 or 60 rods westerly on the road that leads from Zebulon PENFIELDS' to Capt David SMITH's.\" This stood west of the present building, half way to Mrs. ALEXANDER's. In 1817,m an examining committee of 17 members was appointed for \"examining and inspecting the schools.\" It included most of the former school visitors. It is impossible, for want of space, to give all their names.\n\nIn 1826, the comm"
