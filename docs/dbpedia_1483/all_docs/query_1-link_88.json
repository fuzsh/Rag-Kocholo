        "text": "When is the Houston mayoral runoff election? The runoff will take place on Saturday, December 9, 2023.\n\nWill there be early voting? Yes, there will be an early voting period, but it will be shorter. We will update this guide once the dates are set.\n\nHow do I find polling locations near me? You can view a map of election day and early voting centers on Harris Votes. Or add sone fun to casting your ballot by voting at some of the coolest polling locations in the city.\n\nThese contenders also threw their hats in the ring for the mayoral seat but did not receive enough votes to advance to a runoff.\n\nGilbert Garcia (7.21%): The former Metro chairman from 2010 and 2016 has since been working as a managing partner for Garcia Hamilton and Associates, a wealth management company with a focus on bonds. He was also mayor Annise Parker’s campaign chair in 2009. His key issues as a mayoral candidate included public safety, corruption, clean streets, and attracting business owners. His campaign’s tagline was “Make Houston Happen.”\n\nJack Christie (6.87%): A former at-large city council member, Christie launched his campaign saying he wanted to create a “safe, stronger Houston.” The former candidate’s resume also includes medical professional, president of the Spring Branch ISD school board, and veteran who served in the Army Reserve Medical Corps for six years. The Republican wanted to balance the budget by cutting wasteful spending, improve public safety, and support law enforcement.\n\nLee Kaplan (2.62%): A political outsider with strong initial fundraising, Kaplan is an attorney and a partner at Smyser Kaplan and Veselka. His key issues included crime prevention, traffic, city bureaucracy, clean streets, and youth opportunities.\n\nRobert Gallegos (1.06%): A native of Magnolia Park, Democrat Gallegos has been a Houston City Councilmember since 2013, representing District I. Before that, he worked as an aide to then-Harris County commissioner Sylvia Garcia. In council, he is the chair of the Quality of Life Committee and is a vocal advocate for Houston’s green spaces. Public safety and infrastructure were his campaign’s two other key priorities. Gallegos endorsed Whitmire in the runoff on November 11.\n\nM.J. Khan (0.98%): Khan served on Houston City Council from 2004 to 2009, and was also the president of the Islamic Society of Greater Houston. His key campaign issues were crime, infrastructure, supporting law enforcement and first responders, and mending the city’s relationship with the state.\n\nAnnie “Mama” Garcia (0.78%): Garcia was running after losing the Democratic primary to represent the state of Texas in the US Senate in 2020.\n\nJulian Martinez (0.72%): Owner of Bemer Motor Cars, Martinez said in a press release announcing his bid for mayor that he was “disappointed at the amount of political division between the current politicians and their inability to address our city’s problems.” His campaign focused on issues of safety, economic development, and affordable housing.\n\nRoy Vasquez (0.43%): This former candidate who had homelessness and animal welfare among his campaign priorities, threw his hat in the ring for the second time—he ran for the same seat in 2019.\n\nM. “Griff” Griffin (0.27%): A Houston political advocate and community leader, Griffin has run for at-large positions on the city council 11 times since 1993. He is the former owner of famous Montrose sports bar Griff’s, and later became a private investigator and business consultant who helped introduce Houston’s 311 city services hotline.\n\nOther candidates who ran for mayor include Kathy Tatum (0.21%), David Lowy (0.15%), Chanel Mbala (0.14%), Naoufal Houjami (0.14%) Gaylon S. Caldwell (0.13%), B. Ivy (0.11%), and Robin Williams (0.04%).\n\nDerrick Broze: An author and activist, Broze ran on a campaign to change the city charter to remove power from the mayor and give it to city council. He adopted a “your body, your choice” stance during the pandemic and doesn’t believe in vaccinating children for COVID-19. Broze ran for Houston mayor in 2019 and received 0.3 percent of the vote. He did not file to be on the ballot by the August 21 deadline.\n\nAmanda Edwards: The former Houston City Councilmember dropped out of the race for mayor on June 19. She endorsed Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and is instead running for her seat in Congress.\n\nChris Hollins: After serving as Harris County Clerk during the eventful 2020 presidential election, which raised his national profile as the county’s expanded voting options during the pandemic went to court, Hollins announced his candidacy for mayor of Houston. He dropped out on April 6, and instead is running for City Controller. In that race, Hollins received 44.8 percent of the vote, advancing to the runoff election on December 9 against Orlando Sanchez (27.3 percent).\n\nR.R. Tezino: This candidate described himself as a “manager, educator and program director” on his website. He cited public safety, transportation, and education among his main issues. He did not file to be on the ballot by the August 21 deadline."
