        "text": "[Springfield, 21 August 1688]\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nHad I known you were returned to Boston I should have addressed myself to you last week when I sent a post to Brookfield and Worcester with the intelligence that they might beware, etc.; then also I wrote to Major Hinchman ordering Captain Wing1 to speed away my letter with the account to him who I desired to give notice further, so that I suppose you have had advice of all. When I came home from New London, I speeded away to Northfield with about 20 or 24 soldiers and in two days’ time had three houses there fortified, one at each end of the town and one in the middle, left three men with them, one for each garrison and so returned about the 9th instant, leaving all well and in a hopefully good condition, nothing appearing, only that those strange Indians we suppose which did the mischief on our Indians at Spectacle Pond2 were as was thought returned that way. For an Englishman that was coming down to Hadley a few days before I went up, about three miles on this side of Northfield saw several Indians, some sitting, some standing and walking, at which he returned to Northfield and gave an account thereof. Whereupon they sent out 12 men, some of whom came up with the Indians, called to them, asked them to come to them; one came so near that they saw the Indian take the bullets out of his mouth to speak; and 2 or 3 more stood with their guns ready. But when they saw more English, for at first there were but 2 coming up, they drew away. The English pursued them, but could not overtake them, they made such haste away, leaving a kettle, etc., and night coming on the English were forced to return. The next day our people of Northfield (who found three of their swine killed, which the Indians for haste had left, one of them they had boiled some of it and carried away the rest) pursued the Indians, and by their tracks followed them about 12 miles till they came to hard stony ground and brush where they lost their tracks and could not possibly find any more signs of them and so returned to the town. This was what I heard and met with when I was at Northfield, and there as aforesaid set the people in good posture, and they were then courageable and thought themselves with their three fortifications (I having left only a man for each, which they reckoned might be sufficient with their own) secure, and I doubt were too secure. For the men being in their meadows at work and very few in the towns, on the 16th of this instant about the middle of the day some Indians came upon the north end of the town where is most hollows and uneven ground and presently killed three women kind whom they knocked down and two men, one of them they run through with a spear and the other they shot down, and were gone in a trice. The men being alarmed and coming from their work up into the town saw not an Indian, for they were all gone off clear. Upon the intelligence I presently sent forth 50 soldiers from the several towns here, for their relief and to seek after and pursue the enemy, from whom I now have this account that they presently sent out scouts but could not discover the Indians; only one Englishman who was wanting they found killed, being shot down as he was mowing, for he was fallen over his scythe and his scalp the Indians had taken off. The day after our soldiers marched out in two companies, ranged the woods and cannot find which way the Indians went nor discover anything, only in a piece of Indian corn about three or four miles from the town where some English had planted they find some Indians feeding and many stalks of corn that the Indians had sucked. Our men next day went out in two companies on both sides of the river, about 20 men in a company besides some scouts, but discover nothing and are much discouraged by the badness of the way, yet are endeavoring further and will do their utmost for discovery and desiring the enemy, whom doubtless are drawn off for a few days, and will lie still for a while or go to another place, and where the shock will be next none knows. And when our men come off from Northfield they will be in great hazard, being so few in all. When I was there I called them together and had a list of all and they were but 29 men (and one old man made 30) and now that they have three of their men killed by the Indians, they are but 26 and most of their harvest is to get in, it being more backward there. So that it is difficult to secure and hold the place, and for them to draw off (which they incline to) is a damage to the whole and must not be allowed. They write to me for 24 or 30 men to garrison the place which we cannot afford them; our towns are weak, none of any great strength, Northampton the best, the next is this town, which consists much of out-farms and a few houses together; the town plat3 indeed is tolerably safe. But above half our people are abroad and at a distance from the town three or four miles each way. So that securing such places which are in as great hazard is most absolutely necessary; some I call in, others I cause to fortify and afford them help; and have sent 6 men to Brookfield to fetch off the women and children, they calling for assistance, whom I have directed to go to the Bay. We have now at this time about 30 of our men taken off by sending some to Northfield and other places and are not alarmed by one of our men discovering an Indian in the woods and others hearing a gun go off where we are assured no Englishman is nor any Indian except enemies. I am sending out scouts and ordering our people in the best way for safety; but, sir, we cannot hold it against sudden incursions of the enemy if our people be taken off to other places, so that I must be forced to call our men home, and therefore request some soldiers may be sent thence out of hand to keep garrison at Northfield and to hold the place; about 16 or 20 at least I propose for that place that we may have our own men to secure ourselves. I know other places also are weaker and need rather than to spare any, but I hope may hold it, except Deerfield, who may do well to have 6 or 8 sent them; and Brookfield also need men or must be in hazard, though their women come off which I direct to, that the men may be more free, etc. Sir, they want some arms at Northfield, some of their men have not firearms and I find some wanting in other places also, so that at least 20, if not more, firearms I desire may be sent and some ammunition. I lay the state of our people before you and trust you will afford such meet assistance as the case requires. I am not wanting in what I can and am as you cannot but know everyway called on, and beset, with complaints and desires and fully employed, am enforced to conclude and take to doing what is to be done,4 so that I hope you will excuse my scribbling. With due respects I am, sir,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\n[The following portion of this letter is addressed to some official of Connecticut, possibly the secretary, Captain John Allyn; it may be a copy of the letter to Governor Andros, with the postscript added.]\n\nI have given an account to his Excellency at New York5 of matters so far as was then, only some things have occurred since. Have also sent to other places and given advice of things to Albany, sending two men thither last night, all which takes off our men, and truly our town is now pretty much emptied. I pray mind sending some relief to Northfield, if not to Deerfield, and some arms. The messenger hastens me and is impatient of stay, I lighting on him occasionally (else had sent a post to you) may possibly omit some things but shall be ready as occasion calls to give you further advice. The women at Northfield say that they saw only about 12 or 15 Indians, none knows what more they are; however, by sudden surprise and a skulking way they may do great mischief, and whether they have not a stronger party. From a good hand I have advice that Mr. Gibbons6 when he came from the Bay saw great tracks of Indians that had crossed the road about Worcester, whether between that and [torn] field or between that and Marlborough.\n\n[Springfield, 16 January 1688/89]\n\nHonored Sir,\n\nYours of 7th instant per your Indian I received last night, with the letters for Boston, and accounting it of great import to speed them away, especially that to his Excellency:1 as soon as ever I read yours and understood the contents I immediately took care for the dispatch of them and last night provided a man to whom after I had writ to the Governor I delivered all the letters (made up in one packet) before I went to bed and the messenger went on in his journey towards Boston this morning early. I hope the Governor2 may by this time be arrived at Boston, but we have had no certain account of his being returned. The last news I had was about the middle of December when I received a letter from his Excellency who was then at Kennebeck and forty miles up that river, and not finding the Indians intended to build a fort thereabouts to secure their winter quarters, and then to march with 200 or 300 soldiers to find out the Indians, whom by the best intelligence were but about 80 fighting men, but not certain. They had taken one notorious villain, who when they were bringing him before the Governor to be examined (resolving not to discover anything) cut his own throat, and ’twere well if all of them would do so, or else that some else might do it for them. It is said that his Excellency intended to be at Boston in a little time, and I have a few days since sent a man to Boston (if your letters had come a little sooner he might have carried them), whom I expect to return within these two days or very speedily after, and by him I hope to hear a further account which I shall readily impart to you and possibly also Major MacGregory3 may then be returning. If he come this way, one thing I think I intimated to you which was reported here, as if the Governor’s kinsman had been slain by the Indians, but I hope it was no such thing, because I have had no account of it by any letter and heard not of it since, so that I do joyfully recall that again as presuming and concluding it was not so; indeed news is so uncertain, except what by letters from goods hands, that I know not what to say to reports. We are now filled with news of great preparations in Holland against England, and more then so, viz., that the Prince of O4 with 500 sail of ships was put out to sea, and had aboard 40,000 Dutchmen, as also 40,000 Englishmen and as many Frenchmen, etc.; I will spare to speak what I hear. Only this I may say that I have seen a proclamation put forth by our King, wherein his Majesty says he hath undoubted intelligence of a great and sudden invasion from their neighbor country carried on with all imaginable secrecy, in tending to deceive us. But that he was in so good a posture as he hoped by the blessing of God he should be able to make them repent their unjust and rash attempt, stirring up his subjects to unite, telling them that nothing but being divided could hurt them. I have it not by me at present, and the Indian hastens back (as I am willing he should take this good season) intending to be returning this very day, else I would have sent you the proclamation, but suppose you have all from York and the news of the Imperialists prevailing upon the Turk who go down the wind apace. The Imperialists having taken Belgerun5 and other places so that the Turks are almost outed of Hungary. A notable exploit of Prince Louis, who with 3,000 horses attacked the Turks that proved to be (though to his surprise not understanding them to be so many) 15,000, but having advanced so far that it was too late to retreat encouraged his soldiers, who declared themselves willing also to fight for their lives which all did with such resolution and spirit that they slew 7,000 Turks, took many prisoners, made such a conquest that the Turks are like to lose that whole province. But whither wander I? I suppose you have whatever is come from England and it may be more and more particular account of the Dutch, their invading England,6 and upon what occasion. I pray God put a good issue to that affair. I hope some composure and compliance on each side may prevent that effusion of Christian blood which else will happen. I should better like to hear of all uniting together against the French, who are not the best neighbors beyond sea as I am afraid you and we shall find also here. Doubtless they will give what disturbance they can to the Senecas, who must be upon their guard and timely prevent their fortifying near them. I thank you for your intelligence, hope you will as further happens hand it to me as I shall any hence to you. Anything of yours that comes to my hand I shall carefully secure and convey. Give my service to Major Baxter7 and the rest of your gentlemen. The Indian would go to Westfield tonight, and so hastens that I cannot write to them anything of news you will impart. Please to deliver him the enclosed letter which hath lain some time at my house for want of opportunity to send it till now. I hope you will excuse my servant’s being desirous to serve so good a friend with anything I have, and being glad to hear from you and for which your every lines and intelligence, I give you many thanks and with all due respects to yourself and lady, I commend you to God and am\n\nSir,\n\nYour assuredly loving friend and humble servant,\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\nThese for his Honored friend Mr. Robert Livingston at his house in Albany.\n\n[Springfield, 30 July 1689]\n\nHonored Sir,\n\nYours of 17th instant I received not till the 26th, whereby I perceive what the Convention1 had agreed about sending to the Maquas is delayed. God overrules all things and works about his own purpose. Had it speedily been when I first intimated it, probably some check might thereby have been e’er this upon the Eastern Indians, but now (though I have not lately heard from Albany) according to what account I had, they are all gone out against the French, which if true (as I hope it is) may yet be of good use to us. The least cloud arising for our shadow if but as a man’s hand is to be acknowledged as from our good God, who chastises his people for their sins that they may repent and so I trust he will give us of his grace so to do and enable us thereby truly to turn to himself, and then arise in his own time for his people’s deliverance. The improving the Maquas and Senecas in my poor opinion seems a probable way (though our relying must be only on God alone) to effect some destruction on the Eastern Indians; yet there are inconveniences in using them (which I am afraid of), both from our own people, which possibly may be boisterous towards them, and also from themselves, they being a proud people; their men may possibly run into some insolencies at least will be apt to provide for their own bellies, by the destruction of some cattle that may come in their way and how to ride clear of such things is the difficulty, which yet may not happen, and I hope they (having been always friendly to the English) may be so treated as may be preventable thereof. However, they being gone from home, the season at present is lost till we hear of their return and what success they have against the French, if they went thither, which I take for granted. I had much rather others should be employed and that the business might wholly be managed by others (in your sending to them) than myself,2 and shall be heartily glad thereof, yet am willing wherein I am able to do any service which God and his people calls me to; but it is almost too hard a journey for me, who knows the difficulty of it (as well as charge, having formerly been employed, and I believe there are some arrears which the country did not fully discharge). And in so expensive a place as Albany is (which I have always found to exceed what is sufficient in other places), besides whatever you will allow to and upon the Maquas, there must be and can’t be avoided the expending of money, by whomever you employ, which they had need to go furnished with, and you have fit persons at hand to entrust it with, or here may be some men had in these towns which are in the way and nearer, that I can direct to if you give orders. However, I shall not decline anything that may be a service and for the country’s good, so far as I am capable thereof and able thereunto. That which you sent for Northfield, I handed it to Mr. Tilton3 as soon as I received it.\n\nConcerning the disorders and irregularities of the soldiers in this county which you mention, I have not been wanting to allay the same. But there is a party at Northampton who fall in with Sergeant King, or rather that are stirred up by him, who do so blow up discontents against their former officers as make it difficult, and I understand it was carried on in design by himself that he might be captain; and it hath so far prevailed that he is nominated for lieutenant, having so many relations, as I am informed about 32 in that town by marriage and blood, who have holpen it on and are the faction in that business, Medad Pomeroy4 joining with them and being of them (which also helped him to the place of deputy) when as many of the most sober and considerate men are otherwise disposed and would rest in and with their former officers who were commissioned before May 1686, and they cannot justly object against any of them, only Ensign Baker5 out of his modesty not carrying the colors the first Training Day after he had his commission (their old ensign who desired and had his discharge because he was removing to Northfield, besides his age) being then there on their last Training Day in that year, and not actually gone officiating). They say Baker never accepted his place, though he took his commission that day which I sent up to Captain Cooke6 to deliver him, only he did not deliver it at the head of the company, because the old ensign that was removed to Northfield was then on the field with the colors, and so Baker is none. This is their say: for it being the end of the year that he had his commission, before they had another Training Day in the spring; the change of government was who[?] put in another ensign bearer (whom now that party would have to be their new captain), and so Baker was prevented of officiating in the place, till now that the present authority hath restored him; and I apprehend they are as well with their former officers, viz., Captain Cooke, Lieutenant Hawley7 and Ensign Baker stated and commissioned by the General Court, as they can be if not better than by the new ones they intend to present. I know they make a rattle about Captain Cooke being removed to Hadley, which takes with children, and so it pleases them; but your Honors are able to judge of these things and of your own order, which is very good and necessary. Yet in all generals there are particular cases that call for dispensations, which you know how to improve to advantage. I can truly say I have no spirit in the business, neither for the old ones, or against the new ones that some design only would improve reason and judgment in the case and the peace of the place and would despise an office that should disturb it, which I prefer above all the offices in the world. I believe a word from the Governor and Council according to your late explanation and declaring July 4 (directed particularly to Northampton), that these officers commissioned before May 1686 stand good and are to be attended to, would fully settle all. However, that they are their officers for the present and till new are commissioned; this I hold them to, telling them (for I would be open in anything I do) that law, gratitude to some of them for formal service, and religion calls on them to own them and attend to them till new have commissions. And that they must own them for their Committee of Militia and not four men which (to salve matter) they would have the town appoint for that service, which I told some of that faction as the law did not allow it, so it was against reason and there was no need at all of it. Since they had officers standing in commission on the 12th of May 1686 not yet displaced by the government that were by law stated the Committee of Militia, and if any of them were absent (which they could not now say of Captain Cooke, because he is come again to Northampton), the sergeant or next officers by law were a supply, and were their Committee of Militia in want of commission officers (without finding and creating a new way of their own devising), which was clear and fast by law, and could not but be so plain to themselves as that they ought to yield obedience to them for the present. For it was not for the new which they had nominated to take it upon them, till they had their commissions and were allowed of at least by the Governor and Council having declared the former were in place till no more allowed. This I hope (with more I said) will issue their disquiets, and I understand it satisfied the most sober, who like it best to be as at present they are, and ‘twill doubtless be a settlement, and the best settlement for the present, if signified to them and they ordered thereunto (according as the law is) by the Governor and Council.8 I now leave to your Honors to act further as you see cause and otherwise, having given the reasons of my advising and directing as I have declared whatever my poor thoughts and weak opinion was, and is. I shall be highly well pleased if you see cause to act and do otherwise, for as I ought not (and in some measure have learned, not) to lean to my own understanding, neither in this nor in any other public concern. So I know it is duty for me and them to acquiesce in what you shall determine, and indeed I advised seeing they urged so much Mr. Baker’s not acting by his commission, or officiating formally (the reason whereof being clear that he was prevented then) that he might suspend a little while for the present, that the discontented party might apply themselves to your Honors. I also advised them to lay the case of Captain Cooke’s being at Hadley a while before your Honors also and till then to be given and act as I gave them direction, and I suppose they have done it and that you will and have a great deal from that party unless they rest in what advice and orders I have given them, as indeed you have too much from me, especially not being very well but much indisposed, only my great desire of peace and unity together with that high respect I have for yourselves and the good settlement of the country hath driven me on for your information and not any inclination to be meddling, for I could be right glad of a discharge that might not be concerned. But something being by your letter hinted you would have me to do to their quiet settlement, I pray God direct you further and pour upon you his sevenfold spirit of wisdom, etc. There is also another small place called Enfield near me and the next place to Springfield of all our towns and was a part of Springfield and managed and ordered by a committee of Springfield men, myself one of them, whom I hear have sent the choice of some persons to have them commissionated, which they industriously kept the knowledge of from me till one of the soberest men there (who told me he as well as divers others knew nothing of their sending till afterward) lately acquainted me with it, and that though they may write in the name of the inhabitants, yet many of the inhabitants, he said, knew not of their writing.\n\nBut by the order Sergeant King sent they proceeded to choice if, as some of them call it, of a lieutenant and ensign, when as they are but 34 in all and no more. Possibly being a new place they may soon attain more, and be more fit for commissioned officers, but at present they may well rest with sergeants, and so I declared to them, giving it under my hand that they should attend to those that were their sergeants in the former government and out of a desire to comply with them (they having laid by the most principal man in all respects) I appointed three though two I reckon else would be enough; but as I judged it the most of them I discern plainly like well and best of what I have done, but a party that are otherwise disposed answered me, at least one that was the mouth (being one of them they have presented to him a commission) said in these words: they had chosen commissioned officers and them they would obey; [I] replied they would do very well in so doing when they had such; in the meantime I expected they should attend to the sergeants now appointed them (and that had been in that place) as such for the present, till they had commissions for them. And I humbly propose whether it may not be meet to signify so much from yourselves that they not being capacitated according to la[w] for commissioned officers, at present are to rest in sergeants accordingly, till I shall move for them. This I conceive would wholly quiet them, and indeed for all companies to advise with or at least acquaint their respective field officers with such as they desire should have new commissions, before they present such persons or have them allowed, will in my opinion be most peaceful, for ‘tis kept from them only where there is a faction or some design not withstanding all their artifice at Enfield and contrivance getting all more age to vote. Yet the man whom I suppose to be most meet (and so do themselves all but four or five men if one were to speak with them from man to man) wanted but one vote for which I understand also some tricks were used (and they durst not try it again) by those that strived against him, however were afraid he would carry it, and they hastened their matters least it should come about again and prove his due. Nothing of any news here is come to my hands meet to impart, except the Lord’s contending with us very sorely by sickness. Captain Glovers9 died the middle of last week, another person at the end of it, some more in great danger, my wife who hath had a sore fever for a week lies in a doubtful condition, myself though gently handled yet have some spice of fever. The good Lord teach us and gain us to himself by every rod. We have also frequent tidings of the discovery of Indians skulking about our towns. Colonel Allyn from Hartford on the 25th instant writes, we have [our] Indians’ reports daily, of some strange Indians in our woods, which our Indians discover, so that they are afraid to stir. About the end of last week I had an account from Northampton that they had received intelligence from Northfield that a lad there saw an Indian that had taken up his stand between the two garrisons (one of them being a small one which secures their passage to and from their meadows); some men going to the place saw his stand and the bushes set up, etc., but the Indian was gone; also in some other places skulking Indians have been seen that we are alarmed thereby. An Indian I am informed came very lately into Hatfield, seeing the people at a burial came up to them and told them he was a hunting up the river at the great meadows (which are I suppose more than sixty miles above Northfield) where he saw and spake with a parcel of Indians come from the French at Canada and told him they had a commission from the French to kill Indians in these parts or English; and they might kill him but that they knew him and being of their nation they let him alone. And so he came presently to give us notice of our danger, and that some speedy care must be taken to call them10 off from Northfield or to send up some men to secure them there. I formerly laid the case of Northfield before your Honors and desired your sending 16 or 20 men thither, which I request may not be delayed; and your further orders are necessary, either your appointing some others to manage affairs here which I like best, or strengthening my hands (some questioning everything) by some full and plain orders which there is need of, some reckoning all but a show of government throughout New England. Indeed that wonder-working providence of God in the late changes shows that it is the Lord’s doing and it is marvelous in our eyes, but it is a cloudy day to the envyings, revilings, uncharitableness, and falseness that is found among us, call for darker providence, but it may be God will drive back the cloudy day, and melt by his own mercies and lead us to repentance by his goodness. Oh that it might be so. It is time to seek the Lord that it may be. So I beg my confused lines, begun to yourself that are for the Governor and Council and sometimes I find are in the plural number as to them, which are too much scribbled and indistinct, may be excused both for their tediousness and the scrawls, it being too hard for me to write them over again which is a great shame that I should count it hard to mend. With the tender of my best respects and humble service to the Government Deputy and all the Gentlemen of the Council, desiring the Wonderful Councilor, the Prince of Peace, to sit among them, counsel and guide them in ways of peace and righteousness, and to give us peace and quiet at home and within also as well as from abroad in his due time, I am sir,\n\nYour assured friend and humble servant,\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\nJust as I was about finishing these lines I received a letter from Mr. Tilton subscribed also by Mr. Partridge and Mr. King as the Committee for Northfield intimating their having received that order for their being a committee, etc., and that meeting to consider about the present necessity of relief by some garrison soldiers forthwith to go up or else to draw the people off. The latter of which (they say) they must have better advice before they can incline to it; the former which (they say) they incline to, needs (to take their own words), as we judge, the accommodation of 20 men especially at this time for the obtainment of which we see no way but for yourself to put forth the power devolved on you for impressing of men accordingly, the Committees of Militia here being dull and unhinged in the work without your warrant, which will thoroughly supply all their defects and scruples. If you will by warrant gather the number out of the country the thing will be effected; and these are their own words. I shall take occasion hereby and have fair opportunity to gain Mr. Tilton’s approbation of and countenancing the former officers in Northampton to officiate, which I find now he, as also Mr. King, comes to about and so I hope that affair (having your fiat) will be settled. I am now about ordering 20 men out of the county out of hand which will be more difficult to obtain than you can imagine, by reason of sickness, and at present must be out of the three next towns, Deerfield excepted, because they rather need supply also; but will take care to dispatch away some to keep garrison, etc., at Northfield; it may be for a week or thereabouts till you may send supply and further orders which I wait for, and whilst I am shall attend.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\nThese for the Honorable Isaac Addington, Esqr., Secretary for the Colony of the Massachusetts in Boston.\n\nLetter from Major Pynchon received per August 1689 and communicated to the Council.\n\n[City Hall, Albany, 23 September 1689]\n\nBrethren,\n\nWe being authorized by the several colonies of New England, viz. Massachusetts, Plymouth, and Connecticut, to renew the covenant chain of friendship which hath many years ago been made by our progenitors with you the Maquas, Oneidas, Onandagas, Cayugas, and Senecas, have accordingly undergone the difficulties of a hard journey to come to this prefixed place, and have sent for some of your sachems and chief captains to effect the same, whom we are glad to see safe come hither.\n\n2. You have had notice of the late revolutions in England, where the late King James, being a Papist and a great friend of the French (who put a stop to your annoying and being revenged of the French two years ago), is removed from the throne and his son-in-law and daughter who ruled in Holland, and are professed enemies to the French interest, are sent for by the English to be king and queen in their father’s stead, by which means the English nation and the Dutch are not only united in a firm covenant chain, but are able and unanimously resolved to ruin the French King, having the most part of all the Christian princes in Europe on their side to join in that good work, for as the French of Canada have often broken their faith with you, so their king did at home with all his allies. Therefore, so long as the French king and the Jesuits have the command at Canada you can never expect to live in peace, it being their only study not only to decoy and treacherously murder your people, but to send evil emissaries amongst you as they did lately from the Eastward to delude and raise jealousies against your best friends, who have kept their covenant chain inviolable time out of mind.\n\n3. We cannot but take notice of your kind answer to the interpreter last March, when he was sent to your castles to inform you how treacherously those villains [of] the Kennebec or Eastern Indians had murdered divers of their Majesties’ subjects without the least provocation, and were fled and therefore their associates or confederates to be looked upon and taken as enemies;1 when you did not only show your grief for the loss of so many of your brethren, the Christians to the eastward, but would endeavor to revenge their blood by destroying of those perfidious rogues, who broke their faith with you some years ago, and as you then did very well remark, it was by the instigation of the French. So we find by experience that that false nation doth set on the Eastern Indians with whom they have a correspondence to do these mischiefs. But since we are informed by the way of the West Indies that our great King and Queen hath proclaimed war against the French, as the Hollanders did last fall, which if true we doubt not in a short time to have orders from them to ruin the French of Canada, who are your and our avowed enemies, and by that means procure you an everlasting peace and tranquility.\n\n4. We are glad to hear you had taken up the ax to be revenged of those perfidious French who so basely betrayed your people, and do heartily congratulate your late great success in your enterprise against them, not doubting of your further success if vigorously pursued, which we do recommend unto you in an especial manner, and for your encouragement we can assure you that the English and Dutch have taken and sunk many of the French king’s best ships of war, and that some Dutch ships are now cruising about the mouth of Canada River where they have taken ten French ships more.\n\n5. We cannot but admire that the Maquas who have had so many proofs of the deceit of the Eastern Indians should suffer themselves to be deluded to hear any proposals whatsoever made by such villains, professed enemies to their brethren, the Christians, to the eastward; especially since they were so strictly charged by the Gentlemen of Albany not only to stop your ears and not to accept their false presents, but send them prisoners here; for by their own proposals you may judge what persons they are. They plainly tell you they are in amity with the French, your enemies, who supplies them with ammunition to destroy the English, and will never be wanting to furnish them with what they shall ask to do the same to you. We are further informed how falsely they have insinuated to you as if we had sent for their sachems and destroyed them, and that the English had combined to cut off all the Indians in the country. Such notorious falsities are invented by the French priests to try your steadfastness and to make you become like the waves of the great lake. But we can assure you that their sachems when sent for, were not only civilly treated with presents and other tokens of friendship, but safely conducted home in a sloop, who for thanks fell upon the English and murdered them; neither did we ever intend any evil to any Indians that will live peaceably with us, but on the contrary do resolve to keep firm and whole the leagues or chain of friendship which so long hath been maintained betwixt us, in the doing of which you will always be safe, and since we are informed that the 3rd castle of the Maquas utterly refused to have anything to do with these four Eastern Indians, but by all means would have sent them as desired, which was the occasion of their parting from the rest, we must acknowledge them to be prudent people, who have a great veneration for the chain of friendship and therefore we recommend you that have had this failure to follow their example for the future.\n\n6. We expect that if any of the Eastern Indians, our enemies, come near any of the brethren of the Five Nations or within your reach or knowledge, you will not only deny them all manner of succor or relief, but will account it your interest to kill and destroy them, as well as the French, their confederates, which will be very acceptable to our King, and we his subjects shall take it as a signal mark of your fidelity.\n\n7. We must further let you understand that there are divers of our friendly Indians, as those upon Connecticut River, Pequots, Mohegans, Naticks, and all Indians to the southward of them, who are in actual service against the Eastern Indians, and are linked in the same covenant chain with us, that you do them no harm when any of your people come near our parts, either in pursuit of our enemies or to visit your brethren among us, for the prevention whereof it will be requisite you have a sign, which for the first six moons will be by holding upright the butt end of your gun and for six moons after that holding up of both of your hands, and not above two to appear till such time as they be discovered to be friends, least some mischief might befall the brethren, which we should be much grieved at; and the same signs we will give to our people, both Christians and Indians, and when that time is expired we shall take care to send you new ones as occasion shall require.2\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\nThomas Savage\n\nAndrew Belcher\n\nJonathan Bull\n\n[Springfield, 12 May 1690]\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nOn Saturday night the 10th instant, I received a letter from Mr. Stoughton and Mr. Sewall1 dated from New York, May 2d 1690, giving me accounts that for the strengthening Albany and furnishing out an expedition from thence against the common enemy, the Massachusetts proportion of soldiers to be sent shall be one hundred and sixty, desiring me to consider whether sixty of the aforesaid proportion may not be raised out of this county, and that I would dispatch my thoughts concerning the same to the Governor at Boston. Wherefore that I may be no ways wanting in my duty and readiness to promote his Majesty’s interest, and the good of his poor country, I shall freely give my thoughts concerning it, premising that the design of speedy furnishing and sending out men that may join with the Maquas and Senecas (who are almost discouraged that none from these parts have yet come to go along with them) is, I conceive, most absolutely necessary and to be hastened with all expedition; and 160 from this colony is no great number, which (not withstanding those that are already sent forth) will I suppose easily be had from the Bay, without 60 of them from this small county. I grant we are nearer to Albany, whither they must march, (though I have no account of the time when they must go), but the towns in this country are weak, scattered, and next to the enemy, and some of them desire (and need) help to secure them, as Deerfield (where we maintain out about 12 men on the scout, up to the West River, wholly out sometimes a week together on discovery) and one or two small places, namely Suffield and Enfield; many of the people are removed to Connecticut Colony, Enfield almost broken up, all which makes it hard and difficult to have so many hence with due care for the preservation of the towns, and that those that remain may not be exposed in case of an assault, for I do foresee that what men shall be ordered to go out of this county must all (or very near all) come out of four or five towns only, which is matter of due consideration, and I lay it accordingly before your Honor with all therewith, giving you an account of the numbers of men in those towns that they must be sent from.\n\nViz., Northampton are about 128 soldiers, Hadley’s number 66, Hatfield near about 80, Westfield 60, which towns must be acknowledged are pretty compact and together. Springfield are near about 120, but much scattered, and the men are in four parts, remote one from the other like so many small villages, viz., at the Long Meadow about four miles southward from the town 20 men; on the west side of the great river 28; at Skeepmuck full four miles north 12; other farms and places are come into the town and make in four garrisons only in the town plat about 60 men, so that being in so many parts, Springfield (though near as many as Northampton) yet are not capable of squaring2 men as those places which have all their strength together, for some of the remote parts of Springfield none can be taken from and what they spare must be out of them 60 or thereabouts in the town flat except one or so from where there is the greatest number, without. I mention not the other towns that are not capable of parting with any; and indeed Westfield are next to the enemy as well as Deerfield, if not more in their way in case if they come over the lake3 by Albany, so that it is hard to take any men thence. All this is only to give your Honor a right understanding of the state of this county, and a true knowledge of the number of men which considered with their lying open to the enemy and being nextly exposed, I leave it wholly with your Honor and Council and shall rest fully satisfied in what you proportion this county to send, not desiring in the least to withdraw from the public service, or to be wanting thereunto, and what you shall see cause to order from hence, as soon as I shall receive your orders therein, I shall apply myself to get ready. But I greatly fear arms and ammunition will be exceedingly wanting and difficult to get, especially arms, without a special order and warrant to impress them from such as have them, for though some of those that shall be ordered to go may have arms yet not all, and very few suitable arms for a march with, though useful and very serviceable at home. Wherefore I request sufficient orders about furnishing them well out, and I shall afford my best and utmost help and assistance towards the expedition, and as to due care for the preservation and security of them that stay, for which end we are at constant daily charge (besides watching, warding, fortification, and other preparations) of scouting out continually for discovery in every town of this county, I think I may say I am sure there never fail of four men every day with horses that go about 12 miles off the town for discovery and sometimes upon intimations of danger six or eight in a day, and this course we shall hold to prevent surprise, which the Lord give a blessing upon, else all is nothing. Indeed all that we can do will be vain without him, but we must do our duty and would therein wait upon him, and for his salvation.\n\nSir, one thing I crave leave further. Our soldiers I know will much desire and insist upon it, to have commissioned officers of their own (I mean such as they know) out of this county, especially if you should order so many as about 40 men hence, or more; and you may add to them so many from the Bay, or out of the next towns this way, as Marlborough, Sudbury, etc., so many more as to make up those of this county a captain’s company; they would be distinct as to their particular company or captain and not join with Connecticut therein, but only under that commander-in-chief, as all must be. I request you gratifying of them in this, for there were some discontents before winter, though but about 24 then of this county, that one of the commissioned officers were not out of this colony and county but that all were of Connecticut, though they had nothing against Captain Bull, yet they would show their soldiers’ spirit. Now it may in the first forming of company be eased, and if you please to send commissions drawn, leaving it to me to put in the names, lest if you nominate the man he should not be capable of going: (it may be through sickness, for we have many now ill, which will render it very difficult to raise soldiers here, and is a real thing though I forgot to mention it before), I shall faithfully attend your directions and order thereabouts. The Good Lord overrule all our endeavors and crown them with success and his blessing, which upon our true humiliation and reformation (which the Lord grant and spirits4 to) we may the better expect.\n\nI long to hear whether you have any account of what progress Sir William Phips5 may have made or any other success against our enemies, it being here warmly told that 30 of the enemy Indians were slain at the Eastward6 with the loss only of 4 of our men, and that the Indians sue for peace, which if so, is to be feared is out of some wretched design. The Lord guide you in all your councils, send us good news from England, and health in our habitations, with peace in our borders in his due time. With my humble service to your Honor and the Gentlemen of the Council, begging pardon for these scrawls, I crave leave to subscribe\n\nYour Honor’s faithful servant,\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\nIt is too much for your honor to take the trouble of writing to me, but if the Secretary or any best at leisure could give me a line of the state of affairs and what foreign news may be arrived, I should take it most thankfully.\n\n[Springfield, 17 July 1690]\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nIt is not my intent to revive your grief and sorrow for your loss, which (as it hath made a separation from so near a union so) to nature must needs be grievous; but no worldly loss can, nor can this to you, be any separation from the fountain of all good, who remains the same, and gives grace to his to submit to him and see the better for his rod. So that the want of the streams, by the large enjoyment of himself, is most plentifully supplied to the unspeakable comfort of them that love and choose him for their portion, which I pray God grant to you and make up all abundantly more in the communication of himself to your soul. This will be an everlasting cordial, making pleasant not only the death of relations, but then we shall follow them, and die in the Lord; oh how sweet will it be (as for them so for us) to sleep in Jesus and be clothed with his robes of joy and glory, which the Blessed Lord fit and enable you and me for and give you all comfort and satisfaction in himself, that being filled with the fountain you may not find need of the streams. Sir, I have been moved, which is the main occasion of these lines (and indeed these troublous times put me on), to lay the state of the troop1 in this county before your judicious consideration. Whether it be meet wholly to give it up or to continue and settle it, or a troop here or hoe.2 For we are almost come to no troop now, though I think some few years ago this for a country troop was in as good a posture, and the troopers suitably spirited for service, well equipped, and generally as complete in arms, as most troopers or troops were. Until of late some discouragement have made some decline the service, and let their arms and furniture go to ruin, but most especially since February 12th 1689, when the General Court declared that troopers who listed upon account of privileges now abated should have free liberty to dispose of their horses, etc., and list themselves in the foot company; upon which many and generally the best of the troopers here have listed in the foot, disposed of their arms and furniture, some out of the country, and have left the troop. And besides the officers of the troop are taken off, many of them to the foot, and indeed it is a question whether now the troop hath any commissioned officers or any others almost, for thus it is with us. Myself, who from Sir Edmund Andros had commission (as otherwise so also) to be captain of the troop in Hampshire, am no captain thereof, the commission being antiquated and discharged ever since the Revolution,3 so that the troop hath no captain. Here by the way do not mistake me, or think I intimate as if I might, should or would retain it. No, were I in that place, I must, I should, and would lay it down [torn] My lameness, inability for mounting on horseback, etc., utterly incapacitating me, makes me that I may not, dare not, shall not [illegible] with it on any terms; being free, I resolve to keep free. So that there is now no captain of the troop; however, I have been and am ready to further their settlement, therefore have been silent about it. I might not discourage any till now to yourself and I shall follow your advice (myself being discharged) as to continuing and helping on any way of new settlement.\n\nThe lieutenant of the troop is Lieutenant John Taylor, who had his commission also from Sir Edmund Andros, and so it is antiquated likewise; though he hath affiliated since and deserves the place, and I suppose is acceptable to and would be chosen by the troopers if once in a settled state. The cornet who indeed had commission also before from the General Court,4 God hath discharged him, and he is not the quartermaster. The General Court lately sent him a commission to be captain of Hatfield so that the troop hath no commissioned officer, unless Lieutenant Taylor as afore received, and scarce any other officer. The clerk (who might have been improved) hath laid down, listed in the foot, hath served there, and will not return. The eldest corporal (who deserves exceeding well and might have been a commissioned officer as soon as any upon the late law) listed in the foot and since the General Court hath sent him a commission for their ensign, thus you see how broke the troop is. There is only a corporal besides what I have mentioned which may help to some supply, but more must be had, which will be difficult to get, and many of the divers troopers are gone off to the foot, and many more intend it, taking the advantage of the late law, which denies them any privileges, and at which many are too much disgusted. It being so chargeable being of the troop, that our country troopers, which are not so flush of money, find the burden of it, being denied their privileges, incline rather to serve in the foot, as being more easy, I mean less expensive to their estates. Though I believe might they but have the continuance of their heads and horses rate-free, which is a very small matter, many of them would yet continue though some are wholly gone off and will not return; yet possibly some others would list had they encouragement. Lieutenant Taylor5 tells me that he had speech with your Honor about it in the spring and that you told him you would not have this place without a troop, and hoped when these hurries were over something might be thought on and done to ease and help the business, wherefore I am bold to mind you, at least to crave your direction or advice whether to let it drop away, (as it doubtless will unless by some revival it be kept alive) or to spirit men to the service. In June last I had thoughts to have called the troop together which they have not been never since the Revolution, but advising with the Lieutenant (as we still call him) we apprehended it might be meet to forbear till I had writ to you and given you an account of matters as now I have done, and according as I hear from you, shall act, either in declining it wholly or promoting it by calling them together after harvest or when it shall be a leisure time and providence smile on the country of the design thereof; which I pray God graciously conducts and extricate us out of all those difficulties, his holy and righteous hand hath so severely exercised us under; to his grace and guidance I commend you and am, sir,\n\nYour assured friend and humble servant,\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\nSir, our towns here especially some of the upper towns are in great want of powder and should the enemy come (which we are daily alarmed of) would prove perilous; I have writ to the Council for some supply, but hear nothing thereof, wish heartily it may be minded seasonably that no repenting thoughts concerning the neglect thereof may arise, when it is too late; I request yourself to help in the thing and for bullets also. Our people would take care to pay for what shall be sent but they know not how to get any and that little stock they had is much past. Hartford gentlemen have hinted it to me that I should write earnestly that the Council would take meet care of the security of this country, and to have powder and ball in readiness if they should upon assault afford us succours, that matter for annoying the enemy may not be found wanting as the time of need of it.\n\n[Endorsed] Coll Pinchon Dlrd. July 22, 1690\n\nThese Major General Waite Wint [torn], Esqr., in Boston.\n\n[Springfield, 2 December 1691]\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nThere being several Indians lately come in to these parts, who have settled themselves near Deerfield something southward of it, between it and Hatfield,1 I judge it most meet and account it but duty to acquaint your honor therewith, and to crave advice and directions from your honor and Council, concerning them, and what may be necessary for safety in this time of danger and hazard of enemies, having such loud calls both from heaven and earth to be awakened whereby we have as much cause, if not more, to look for approaching danger this winter than last, when it was thought needful to continue a garrison at Deerfield. The Indians came into Deerfield sometime in November, about the beginning of it or between the beginning and middle of last month, said they came from Albany and brought a pass from the Mayor of Albany. I heard only flying reports of them at first and had no certain account till lately, I mean yesterday. I received a letter from Captain Partridge who writes: the Indians that are come down are about 150 of them, men, women, and children, and are settled at Deerfield under the side of the mountain southerly from the town, living in the woods about a mile out of the town, the men plying hunting and leaving their women and children at home.2 It is said (says Captain Partridge) they brought a written pass subscribed by the Mayor of Albany that they behaving themselves orderly, the English would carry it friendly to them. Mr. Partridge writes for the general they have been quiet hitherto, only one or two of them were high and insolent towards a lad at Deerfield, taking some of his father’s corn and pumpkins without leave, and one of them that came to Hatfield, upon one of our men requiring a debt of him the Indian pulled out his knife. There are many of them that were our former enemy Indians which settled at Albany till now. I doubt whether difficulties many ways may not arise or jars upon that account which may raise spirits and be provocations to some, the rather because I understand (though have not certain legal knowledge) some of our people let them have cider and rum, being so besotted with lucre of unrighteous gain and insensible of God’s anger on those accounts and their own danger, that it is to be feared may expose themselves and others. Were the Indians honest as they pretend they may be advantageous in scouting out and giving notice if an enemy is approaching, yet also being so settled, they have opportunity of entertaining an enemy and betraying the towns. If they should prove false, and we having no assurance of them, I propose what may be necessary and meet to be done that we may be in some way of defending ourselves. Whether a garrison at Deerfield be not convenient is with your Honors to consider and then the writing to Connecticut to afford men and assistance therein will be necessary and whether also these scouts of four men a week allowed by the General Court in this county, which I had order for, though of late have laid it down (yet now upon this occasion have ordered Captain Partridge to revive it two or three weeks) be not still to be continued some time. I am thinking it convenient that 40 or 50 or 60 men out of all those upper towns be appointed to be in readiness, and listed under a captain and officers to command them, might be very useful, who should all abide at home till occasion, and then move presently upon notice who, being afore appointed and always fixed, may be suddenly upon a march, if need require, and not enter into pay till called forth by their commander, who must be in those upper towns; and if such a company in their arms should only march once or twice this winter to Deerfield the very sight of them might awe these Indians who will thereby see and know we are in a warlike posture. A lavish like indiscretion may procure some smart blow (as it did to Skenectode),3 which should stir us up to diligence and prudence, our people minding their own business without arms or watch requires that some orders be given for rousing them up, especially considering the talk that is of the French coming down on us this winter. Doubtless there is this winter as much danger as the last; you will I presume bear with my weak notions and conclude upon such resolve and directions as the state of affairs requires. I crave leave to propose one thing more which possibly may be very useful and satisfactory, which is to write the Mayor of Albany concerning these Indians to gain a certain knowledge what they are, and the occasion of their coming, etc., which if you think convenient and order me to do, I will take care to send, if there can be passing thither. One thing I had almost slipped; Lieutenant Wells4 of Deerfield, who would have been very useful and is much wanted for these affairs, being dead (a sad frown of God in this juncture of affairs), there wants a Lieutenant to be commissioned for Deerfield, which I think ought to be minded. If that company have not applied themselves to the General Court, I shall mention either David Hoite, or Jonathan Wells or one Sheldon who dwells there to be their Lieutenant.5 I pray consider how times call for a settlement, they have only an ensign now and that is Hoite, before named, and Sheldon and Wells are their chief sergeants. I formerly hinted to the Major General that Lieutenant Taylor of Northampton might have his commission for the troop, have not heard of anything done which these times calls for and puts me on begging your Honor’s pardon, as also craving your prayers and care for us, with all humble service, I subscribe,\n\nYour most humble and faithful servant,\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\nThe haste of writing especially the latter part to post this letter away entreats for your favorable censure of my scribbling.\n\nThese for the Honorable Simon Bradstreet, Esqr., Governor of their Majesties’ Colony of the Massachusetts in Boston.\n\n[Springfield, 24 January 1691/92]\n\nHonorable Sirs,\n\nYours of 23d instant received and upon perusing the contents thereof am surprised and startled at such reports as you mention, which I assure you I know nothing at all of, and am so wholly ignorant thereof as to our people’s not being apprehensive of danger.1 That I know to the contrary. If I ought to believe men’s words, letters and actions all plainly representing and declaring to one their great sense of presen [torn] danger and hazard, and they have followed me with their apprehension thereof, besides several letters tending thereto, so by messengers not of the meanest but of the chief men of the Committees of Militia themselves being by the rest sent and waiting upon me to possess me with their fears and earnest desires for help, etc., at least two special times, if not two or three of them at a time; after all this to have it said they are not sensible, or that sending of soldiers will not be acceptable, if it be truth, I profess I shall never believe honest men for phase [sic] to take this with it. It is not a few of our people that have addressed themselves to me, but all the Committees of Militia in the four upper towns who ague [sic] three events this winter met together and signified their joint minds and desires and I judge they are rather to be heeded than idle fellows that [illegible] not themselves nor the public safety so they may be gratified in their humors and carry on a disorderly, villainous, and prohibited trade, as possible some such that may be which is our grief whom we would gladly have discovered. Wherefore I humbly request you would please to inform who those people of the upper towns are that say they apprehend no danger, and that your sending soldiers will not be acceptable to the greatest part of the people. I am so far from insisting upon that expressions to the greatest part of those people in the upper towns that I beg that one small part of them may be named, because I know no, I profess not one, nor can’t imagine who it should be unless it be some disorderly trader of drink whom we will most gladly find out. I hope you will be satisfied that I speak fully as I understand matters, and up to your positive assertion; as to your negative that they sent out no scouts, keep no watch, etc., I answer roundly and plumply as is doubtless most false and pity but they that affirm such lies should be made known; for besides one first express order in the beginning of December last upon the approach of those Indians from Albany, I did a second time in the first day of January as I remember quicken them therein, and put to all the Committees of Militia and had a return from Captain Partridge that they did attend it. Only scouting they acquaint me is not feasible as yet it is when they writ, though I believe they do now upon this little abatement of the snow scout out or will presently above Deerfield [torn] And the truth is we have order for four scouts upon the country’s account and surely will not neglect that work when it can be attended and more things than I can now mention have been and are directed to and ordered and put in practice that we may not be lavish-like secure. I shall say with you more than (which security of theirs we can in no wise commend) a non commendation, for I do and shall protest against it were there need, but then people in the upper towns part2 is the leaders are more for putting forward and attending duty and service than to neglect it, which makes such traders as you hint at I suppose, speak so much against it or as they do, though as for horse loads of peltry and furs from those upper towns sent to Boston this past year I know of none, nor have not heard of any yet gone except one that went from this town with furs that were all killed by the English here and some of them from Windsor; possibly some may have gone that I know not of and may they be able to go upon an honest account, I suppose you will not fault them.\n\nGentlemen, your sending up soldiers I apprehend extreme needful and may be for your own preservation and I suppose is but duty ‘twill be too late till danger, etc., approaches, so shall leave it, and say not more, but think it meet to send your letter up to the gentlemen in the upper towns (when I have opportunity) that they may answer for themselves. As to your desire to be informed that your soldiers shall be accommodated with provisions and quarters I answer they shall and good reason for it from us, (and care is already taken) so that it’s pity it should be made a question. I hope you have and shall find all things to your comfort and soldiers’ satisfaction; though should you allow them to be in Hatfield it would be easier; otherwise we must send provisions to Deerfield who want. As to your advice concerning those Indians and all other hints, I most kindly and thankfully accept the same, and shall most readily put it in practice and have given orders accordingly before your letter came, with many things more which I hope are of use and could I copy them, would, I persuade myself, abundantly satisfy you as to my care and orders, etc., but I have not time; however, I have enclosed a copy of what I directed and ordered to be proposed and made known to the Indians. Can send no more at present, and am ashamed I so scribble this letter and cannot write it out fair.\n\nBeg your pardon and candid acceptance. I sincerely desire to satisfy you in all things and if in my haste I have fallen short in any particular, I shall upon the least intimation address myself to give you a more apt and plenary account of whatever you shall refer me to studying to approve myself, Honorable Sir,\n\nYour most humble servant,\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\nI have appointed and ordered a company of soldiers listed out of the three next upper towns, with affairs appointed and settled to be ready for relief of any place. This company is already actually settled and started; shall have another ready this week out of these lower towns besides, that I intend to give [illegible] all our soldiers to be fixed and in readiness. I hope you will give special orders for all your people to be well fixed and ready if any assault be and whether may it not be well to have all the soldiers ready in reserve of dragoons for speedy march upon occasion.\n\nDirections concerning the Indians lately come from Albany and some proposals to be known to them by Captain Partridge or such interpreter as he shall employ:3\n\n1. Although you ought to have made applications to us, and to have had liberty to have come and sit down in our town, yet having passes from the Mayor of Albany for hunting, etc., we shall overlook your seeming intruding upon us, and allow your abiding where you are this winter time; you behaving yourselves peaceably and orderly and carrying it well to all our people this time of your staying till the spring, when you are to return to Albany, from whence you came and where you are expected.\n\n2. We do particularly caution you to beware of strong drink which intoxicates men’s brains and makes them more disorderly than otherwise they would be; and in special to warn your young men thereof least it occasion quarrels which are carefully by you and us to be prevented, wherefore we allow not our people to sell it, and it would do well you would acquaint us with any which do, that we may deal with them for their disorder.\n\n3. We let you know that we are very apprehensive of some approach of the French and Indian enemy now; and therefore intend as the weather will allow, to keep out scouts and to have more strict watch, and shortly also to settle some more soldiers at Deerfield, wherefore none of you (who account yourselves our friends and we look upon as so, and desire you to approve yourselves accordingly) are to go or wander from your present stations without order in writing from some one of the captains of those towns or the lieutenant of Deerfield and not above five in a company when you go a-hunting and if our scouts find them with great numbers or without an order as aforesaid and laying down of arms to be accounted as the enemy Indians, also none of you to come into any of our towns after sunset to disturb the watches at your peril, the day being sustial4 especially in this troublesome time, for necessary occasions, and at no time any of you to be with your arms in any of our towns, all which we expect your careful and due observance of and that forthwith you give notice fully to all Indians at home and abroad accordingly, that peace and orderly living that your stay here may be promoted and friendship increased.\n\nLastly we expect that if you understand anything of any enemy’s approach or have [intell]igence concerning them that you forthwith acquaint us therewith and with whatever you know that may be of any use to us wholly you will approve yourselves to be as you say our friends and we shall be enabled thereby to render the better account of you to your master at Albany. January 16, 1691.\n\nGiven under my hand,\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\nThe above lines were according to my order made known to some of them that came to Mr. Partridge (shall be in the post) who gave Captain Partridge this answer:\n\nTo the first particular they say:\n\n1. They own it should have been so at their first coming.\n\n2. They intend no ill to the English but to carry it peaceably.\n\n3. They desire to leave the squaws under our protection while themselves go a-hunting.\n\nTo the 2d particular they say:\n\n1. Our young men and some squaws will buy it for all them and some of our English will sell it.\n\n2. They are afraid to inform of the English which do it least they be disturbed and do them mischief, yet gave such private hints that Mr. Partridge writes he hopes will put a check to that wickedness.\n\nTo the 3d and last proposal:\n\nThey say they consent to every particular of it and shall endeavor to attend it and promise to make discovery of any approaching enemy, etc.\n\nI have scribbled out these things whereby you may see all of our care and progress; many things more I must impart but writing is tedious to your humble servant.\n\nJ P\n\nThese for the Honorable Robert Treat, Esqr., Governor of their Majesties’ Colony of Connecticut, or to the Honorable Council there in Hartford for their Majesties’ Service, haste post haste.\n\nEndorsed: J. Pynchon Jany. 24 89 [sic]\n\n[Springfield, 20 May 1692]\n\nHonored Sir,\n\nHaving folded this paper with purpose to write to our late Honorable Governor,1 while I was getting it ready, being told by a good hand that Sir William Phips is certainly arrived our Governor from the King whereat I greatly rejoice looking upon it as an answer of prayers, and tendency to a hopeful good settlement of this country. It brings me to a stand concerning the availableness of writing to the late Governor or General Court who employed me with some other gentlemen to Hartford, wherefore requesting you to tender my humble services and due respects to Governor Bradstreet, whom I have a high value for, and to excuse my not writing to him thereabouts, the present change inciting me rather to acquaint yourself with our negotiation that you (being now appointed by the King’s secretary2) may as you shall see it necessary, lay all or what you shall judge needful before our present Honorable Governor Sir William Phips, as followeth. Being nominated by the late Honorable General Court and appointed to take a journey to Hartford and wait upon the General Court there with the letter from this government and to urge the contents thereof; and accordingly myself with Captain Partridge and Mr. Hawley3 went to Hartford on the 12th instant, delivered the letter and waited upon the gentlemen the whole 13th day, discoursed and urged the contents of the letter, which was as they termed it something sharp (though they entertained us with great respect and a-friendly debated matters yet) the matter not being pleasing to them especially some of the gentlemen that of the Confederation,4 which being interrupted and broken they liked not our mentioning it and the rather because (which they much insisted on) that at first they were disadvantaged by harder terms (as they said) than was convenient, which they were held to while it lasted to their damage, and as they were not willing of any discourse that way or of any meeting as formerly, so they expressly said the King having taken the government into his hands, and ordering, it was not to mention things of that nature withal, hinting they had done their proportion and sent up soldiers into these parts of which notice was not taken and their charity slighted, etc. We found it best to wave former matters and told them we did but glance at them and would look only forward to what was now incumbent on them and us, as our General Court’s letter did, and therefore strenuously urged their now joining with us and affording assistance of men and money for prosecution of the war and requested their full resolves and positive answer that, their determination being known, methods might accordingly be taken, etc., upon all which in the conclusion (as all along they said they accounted it duty to assist and would not be wanting therein). They came to this, that they would endeavor to procure 100 Indians that were trusty and would send 30 or 40 brisk young men with them that should range the Eastern Parts5 and join with 100 of our friendly Indians to which we might add 200 or 300 of our people, that were used to the woods, those that were used to that trade as hunters, and brisk young men that would keep out all the summer and not such as many times were (said they) sent out from Boston, etc. But, said they, it must be chosen men for the purpose, such well provided they said might by the blessing of God effect something in distressing the Indians and destroying them, especially if we would take care to remove the French from Port Royal6 and those places that the Indians might not have recruits and succors. Matters here about (viz. their providing Indians and some of their men and paying them; we taking care for victualing them) were brought to a head by our discourse and urging and a foul7 draught of a letter made which upon our waiting on them the 14th day of this May was not writ fair for our General Court, and they telling us it should be that day done and sent to us in regard of the tidings of the French and Indian enemies being then at hand and ready to assault our town; we were enforced to hasten home their promise to send the letter according as aforesaid to us. But hitherto not received the letter to send you, though Captain Allyn told me I should have sight of it to convey by our deputy to the General Court by a man that he would send to me on purpose with it unless an opportunity offered to send it to Captain Partridge or Mr. Hawley, and then you will receive it from them; otherwise I suppose it will be sent directly from Hartford because some of their people went this week by New Roxbury8 towards Boston. Doubtless it will be sent, except they should hear of our new Governor’s arrival and that should occasion their detaining it. However, I have given a true account of what we had brought them into, and persuade myself they would not go back from, and had stayed to bring their determination but that our towns were alarmed, as I before hinted, which now I shall give you some account of (whereby we thought we were necessitated to hasten home having the gentlemen promised that the determination we had brought them to should speedily follow is in a letter to our General Court for us to convey to our deputies). We had intelligence by letter from Mr. Trowbridge that six of the enemy Indians taken at Albany and sent to [New] York said they were part of the scouts from Canada, the forerunner of a great army that intended for this river and were come over the Lake9 and would be at our town about the middle of this month. Moreover, the Indians at Deerfield told they had an account from some Indian hunters between Albany and Deerfield that they saw the tracks of the enemy and that they were like to be upon Deerfield that Saturday or on Sabbath day, so that I saw it my duty then to order some soldiers in readiness, etc., besides Deerfield people were in such a fright that they all got into the garrison;10 struck watches,11 wards, and scouts we keep in all these towns and faithfully improve the four men allowed by the country in scouting up the river, which I trust and beg you to move may be still continued to us, our danger being very great. So that we exceedingly need speedy settlement of all officers, their places, and commands now [illegible]. This further intelligence I have since received from Indians that came from Albany to Deerfield (who were sent to call all those Indians home that came in these parts last winter, which Indians are returned to Albany in expectation of the enemy’s coming) who report that some Dutchmen that were out upon the scout met with a scout of about 20 of the enemy, had a brush with them in which they lost one man; whatever other mischief the enemy received from them they took one of the enemy captive. This captive informs and says that Canada’s design is now to raise all the force they can against these parts and that they are coming with 400 men against the Maquas, 400 against Albany, 400 against this river,12. 400 against the Eastern Parts, and what shipping they can by sea, viz., 50 sail to attack Boston, intending this summer to end the war by subduing all under them. These great says13 (how true I know not) I pray God prevent; ’tis Indians’ news, and calls on us not to neglect care for our own preservation. We are desirous to have the certainty of things from good hands at Albany, and therefor have sent two men to Albany, who went away the 10th instant, by whom I have writ to the Mayor of Albany and to Mr. Livingston14 that we may hear and know the certainty of things and incited them at all times to give us advice of any approaching danger. As you see meet, please to lay any of these things before his Excellency our now Governor, with the offer of my most humble and ready service according to my mean capacity, being really desirous to serve him and this poor low country according to what I am able in my now decayed years,15 and to do all that in me lies that the interest of Christ Jesus may revive among us, with due respects to yourself begging your pardon for these scrawls, if they may be of any service for the public, not being able to copy them fair. I commend you and all the great affairs under hand to God’s guidance and am, sir,\n\nYour assured friend and servant,\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\nCommissions for Militia service for these parts in this time of danger I request you to forward as soon as possible may be, and some care to be had of these parts that lie so next to Canada.\n\n[Springfield, 28 June 1693]\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI have been so employed in public service since I came home that till now I could not improve any opportunity to render you my due acknowledgment of all your late (as well as former) kindness and respects, wherein I have so plentifully shared most deservedly calling for my real thankfulness, which your acceptance of will secure me from the taxation of ingratitude, and be an obligation upon me to study wherein to serve you. According to my ability, I have not been wanting to get an understanding of the state of affairs here in reference to the Indians and murder at Deerfield; which as my time allowed, I made report to his Excellency (all which I know you are fully acquainted with) at same time. Major Wessells1 hastening his return, by reason of my dispatch of him and what was necessary to Governor Fletcher,2 I was enforced to contract, yet mind not anything material that I neglected. The two Indians, one a Maqua and the other an Albanian, whom I verily suppose are guilty in that murder,3 are in safe custody. I desire a suitable time, and gentlemen commissioned, be appointed for their trial, etc., which please to lay before his Excellency. The third Indian put into our jail before I came home, nothing appearing against him, but his saying he would kill 20 English, evidenced by one single man only, who says the Indian was in drink when he said it, which was sometime before the commotion at Deerfield, and he minded it not until that disturbance. He and others saying also that this Indian always carried it well. The Indian saying he knows not that ever he spake such words and if he did he was in drink and was sorry for them; he is discharged and set at liberty (the gentleman that committed him judging it best. Colonel Allyn and Captain Stanley,4 who were here, also advising to it) and went away to Albany with Major Wessells and those six Indians (one a Maqua captain) who came with Major Wessells. So that they will see (though this Indian well deserved imprisonment yet) we are not desirous to put any needlessly upon their trial. They would have been glad we would have discharged the other two setting forth the good service the Maquas, etc., have done, endeavoring to vindicate all their Indians and their being in good terms with the English, saying they disclaim this murder and are not guilty, but that it was done by the French Maquas. And thereunto they improve the sight of some wooden swords or mauls that were found where our people were murdered which had marks and signs on them, as evidences that all was done by the French Indians. To which we replied, such things might be to color their wickedness, and that the positive assertions of dying persons were so express as could not anticipate the legal trial of those persons from what they were charged with. And so they left off, desiring we would deliberate and hear again from Albany before proceeding to their trial. I told them our Governor was very cautious of giving any just provocation, wherewith they seemed well satisfied, telling us the Indians, including the Five Nations, hold firm their friendship with all their Majesties’ subjects, desiring we would (as they term it) hold the court chain fast.\n\nGovernor Fletcher intends a present of £500 or £600 for the five Nations, to engage them to vigorous prosecution of the war against the French and French Indians, which was to be delivered upon Major Wessell’s return home, who is a great man with the Indians. They tell me there are some parties of French Indians come over the lake, reckon our town in much hazard being so open, etc. Say the French are in great want of provisions. Some of theirs lately come home from Canada brought in three scalps and more they expect daily if any further account be to be had from Albany. I suppose we shall have it next week or the beginning of the week after, for Major Wessells said they should send again, and desired I would take care their Indians might come safely, for we have not Indians left, all being gone off upon that disturbance here and their corn neglected. Sir, upon my sudden coming away (as you know being ordered thereunto) I troubled you to get a small matter allowed me by the Governor and Council which you took a remembrance of, as also for my service and attending upon the General Court. If you have obtained it, please to send me the order, that I may set off my rates with our constables. I have now a further request to you, that you would move in my behalf for the allowance of the enclosed account of what charges I have been at in the late transaction with what is necessary for my time and expense at my own house for the public for which I charge nothing and my expenses at home for or about the public service are the greater because here is none to bear share with me therein.5 I have also enclosed a note or account of our Captain Colton,6 which I had with me but did not readily find it then to leave it with you. The soldiers under him had order for their pay, but the committee referred him to the Council saying they would allow him the more. Pray let him who hath been an active captain and always ready to serve the country have due encouragement; his losses also in the flood7 were exceeding great, having all his cattle swept away, which I only mention as an argument not to detain his due that (as he deserves it so) needs it.\n\nSir, if you please to favor my grandchild so far as to draw his commission for Clerk of the Court of Pleas, and obtain the Governor’s signement8 of it, I shall very thankfully accept it. I understand his officiating at the last court here gave good content, and do think he may manage both, and be also Clerk of the Sessions if you see meet to move the Governor therein and thereunto. Here is but little work and ’tis not worth the while to have two clerks when one may do as well and better. The young man will be now at Boston and wait upon you with these lines. I am too troublesome to you, and beg your pardon, with all due respects and humble service, I commend you to God’s gracious guidance, and am, sir,\n\nYour cordial friend and servant,\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\nThese for the Honorable Isaac Addington, Esqr., Secretary for their Majesties’ Province of the Massachusetts Bay, and one of the Council in Boston.\n\n[Springfield, 29 July 1693]\n\nMay it please your Excellency,\n\nI have not yet had opportunity to acquaint your Excellency of the two Indians being gone till now, which first offers itself as followeth: the two Indians in custody upon the account of the murder at Deerfield1 escaped out of prison July 27th. When in the morning I presently sent out about 20 more to search after and pursue them, some of whom finding their tracks just across the street from the prison house followed them for near half a mile, finding they bent northerly, but coming into the bushes could no longer follow them, and so returned, though the jailor spent all the day and sent to the next towns, etc. The manner how they fitted for an escape is evident to be by some file or files conveyed to them (as is supposed by some Indians that might secretly and unknown which having none here unless by stealth) put them in the night. For it is very plain and evident their chains were cut by some sharp thin file like a knife, or some thin steel chisel, they being as smooth as may be, where they are cut asunder, and very narrow, that it was some very thin instrument. When by this means they had got themselves at liberty in the room, they pulled out some stones and got to the foundation and so crept out and are gone, probably irrecoverably, unless sending to Albany may recover them thence, which is submitted to your Excellency.\n\nThe next day July the 28th, or rather it was the 27th of July in the night, about the shutting in of the evening John Laurence from Brookfield came to me with the tidings of mischief done there. The account he gave was that about noon the 27th of July Joseph Wolcot came from his own house, which was three of four miles to the garrison house, with one of his children in his arms crying arm, arm, and he doubted his wife and other children were killed by the Indians, he seeing two or three Indians after her, so snatched up that child and came away himself, being shot after and pursued, only turned into a swamp and hid from them. Upon which relation of his, this said John Laurence, being then at Owen’s house by that garrison, resolved to go and see how matters were at his own house towards and not far from Wolcot’s; and in the way before he came at his own home, found his brother killed and scalped, and two Indians making towards him, whereupon he returned presently to the garrison, and staying there about half an hour, hastened to Springfield, telling me that in that time none came into the garrison besides Joseph Wolcot, and that all there made but five men, who were in extreme hazard if I sent not men to them presently. In the night not an hour after John Laurence, or thereabouts, came in here a traveler, one Cooke, who was going to the Bay. Saying that about noon on July 27th he was at the garrison house at Quabaug, went thence onward toward the Bay, not knowing or hearing anything, he being gone out thence just before Wolcot came in, and when he came as far as Wolcot’s house, within 20 rod of it, he saw many Indians the yard full, stood quite a while, and seeing no English with them mistrusted them, counted them to be at least 40 or 50, so turned about his horse to go back, when presently the bullets flew about him as thick as hail, so he hastened to the garrison, where he stayed but a little while, and came to Springfield, telling me the garrison was in great hazard, being but six men and no ways able to hold it against so many. Whereupon I forthwith ordered 20 men out of Springfield, 10 out of Westfield the next town, all troopers; sent post immediately to Hadley, etc., for as many more; thence ordering their march to Quabaug, and there join ours, etc. Ours, I being up all the night, were got ready by morning with eight that came from Westfield about sunrising. These 28 all well mounted and well fixed went together yesterday to Brookfield, Captain Colton their leader, and for them also from the upper towns; whom I now this day understand attended my order rallying up to the number of 30, but could not be ready so soon and were after those from Springfield. I feared (according to the intelligence I had) we were too weak; [and ordered] if they met not to join; but now this day towards evening a messenger sent to me from Brookfield gives me this account: that those I sent from Springfield arrived there yesterday about two of the clock in the afternoon, finding the garrison well and not touched; presently were upon the discovery, and finding no Indians, improved, besides some scouting themselves that afternoon, in burying of the dead. They found Thomas Laurence dead, Joseph Mason and his eldest son, Joseph Wolcot’s wife and two children, six in all, which they buried. Three or four persons not found, whether killed or carried away, know not. When Captain Colton had performed this service yesterday, being the same day he went from Springfield, returning to the garrison about sundown, the soldiers from Hadley, Northampton, etc., came in. Just upon which a man that adventured out of the garrison upon the hills says six Indians, as he said, came back and acquainted therewith; presently Captain Colton sent out to discover, found the man to have spoke truth, perfectly discerning their tracks in the long grass which they could very well follow, but it growing dusky and too dark to proceed, returned; and intended this morning to take the track and pursue the enemy, who went northwards. Probably are Canada Indians, and that party which the Frenchman’s examination (sent from Albany) were mentioned, viz., 30 ready to come towards these parts under a chief Indian called La Plato, with 10 more to follow them. I suppose have been about Deerfield, but finding soldiers, etc., durst not attempt there. This morning the rain prevents Captain Colton’s march after the enemy, early as he intended; but the man (who is come to me) tells me that it clearing up, he was getting ready and fitting to pursue them. I pray God they may overtake the enemy and have good success against them.\n\nSir, the people at Quabaug have sent to me by this man for advice whether to draw off or stay there: drawing off will be ruinous to what they have; staying may be hazardous and ruinous to their persons. They would draw off or stay according to order. Drawing off will be a public damage as in other respects; so in respect of the road is for travelers,2 continuing there will call for some men to keep their fortifications; it may be about six or eight may be sufficient. I request your Excellency’s advice and order; it, what you appoint, shall be exactly attended. I understand the inhabitants are willing to be ordered one way or other, and till your Excellency’s pleasure is known, I intend only to appoint Captain Colton to leave six or eight men, and so return on Monday after he shall have finished his pursuit of the Indians, which I hope this day or tomorrow will be over, and probably you may hear of the issue or success of their pursuing the enemy by the messenger that I shall order to bring this letter to your Excellency, before I can write again. Pardon me that I mention it a second time, that I request your Excellency’s order for continuing or dismissing, I mean calling off the inhabitants from Quabaug. I desire that which is best may be done and dare not determine it further than to leave some few of the soldiers four or five days or a week till your order shall arrive me.3 I am in all things desirous to do the best, and therein am safe in having order where and when it may be had. What I have acted in the relief of Brookfield as aforesaid, the intelligence I had I thought called me to it, and trust it will be acceptable to your Excellency wherewith I shall conclude craving pardon for my scribbling, the post from Brookfield whom I am hastening back enforcing me in some measure thereunto, I am, excellent sir,\n\nYour Excellency’s faithful and humble servant,\n\nJohn Pynchon\n\nEndorsed: Major Pynchon 29th July, 1693.\n\nTo his Excellency Sir William Phips, Knight, Captain General, and Governor in Chief in and over their Majesties’ Province of the Massachusetts Bay in Boston: for their Majesties’ Service.\n\n[Springfield, 1 August 1693]\n\nExcellent Sir,\n\nLast night Captain Colton from Brookfield, with the soldiers I had put under his command, came well home, and supposing you will expect an account from me of the enterprise, and because some things occur that is of public concern, I dispatch the intelligence thereof by post. Having in my last given your Excellency the account of the attack of Quabaug, by some pagans, which made me send him out upon the pursuit of them, etc., I shall begin now with the account of his expedition from Brookfield, alias Quabaug, which will lead to who were the assailants. On Saturday the 20th of July Captain Colton began his march out of Quabaug about 10 of the clock that morning (the rain having detained him so late) with 42 men well resolved, having left 16 at the garrison there, because he knew not certainly that the Indians were drawn off. To make sure work, went to Wolcot’s house, where about the enemy kept their rendezvous, found their tracks to go through Wolcot’s lot, followed the same and finding it very plain and the way good at first setting out. Cheerfully improved, it soon came to the place where the enemy took up their lodging first after they had done mischief at Quabaug, viz., on Thursday night last, which was about ten miles northerly from Wolcot’s house where they killed Mason’s child which they had took away, the mother, as also young Laurence about 18 years of age, being then captives with them, where after a very small halt, our men on the chase came nearly to the place the enemy, as they suppose, dined the next day, their 2d day from Quabaug. There they killed a mare of H. Gilbert’s, which they had taken to carry their loads, and there also they had broken that drum taken from Laurence’s house. Our soldiers still pursuing came to a great pond about 30 miles or more off Quabaug, where they found the enemy lodged that 2d night. Here they found a horse of Mason’s killed and fresh tokens of them, their fire not out, etc., which encouraged our soldiers much, though the way now most hideous; sometime swampy, then stony and horribly bush, scarce passable for horses, yet went about six or eight miles further that Saturday, all together, with their horses. But finding they could make no riddance in such way with horses, whom also for want of shoes began to be lame, being set for the design, they left all their horses and men that could not foot it. Nineteen men Captain Colton dismissed or shortened his number so many, ordering them to bring the horses after. The captain with the 23 most likely men pursuing the enemy on foot, lightening themselves of their coats and without victuals, hastened away that if possible they might come upon the Indians [illegible] before (or discover them in the) night. But night came before any Indian could be seen or overtaken and the captain having gone seven or eight miles very briskly in bad way after he had left his horse was forced to take up lodging, not knowing how far off their horses might be, that could scarce be got along in that extreme bad way (though the horses came up within two miles of the foot that Saturday night, which was the 3d night that the enemy had been gone from Quabaug).\n\nIn the morning being Lord’s day July 30th the brisk captain, having men resolutely bent, persuading themselves they were near that enemy and knowing their horses would make a lumber, though he wanted his men, resolved not to stay, but set out early and very privately goes on in that dismal way. By that time he had gone about a mile and half, came upon the enemy in a most hideous thick woody place, where till within three or four rods of them they discerned them not, till they heard them laughing. Presently the captain made signs to his few men, to come and compass them about, who did according about 10 of his men only just at his heels, the place obscure, the enemy hardly to be seen, having also cut down bushes to shelter themselves yet made shot upon them, as many of our men as had advantage; the rest of our men also readily coming gave their volley also just as the Indians rise up, being at breakfast about sun a quarter of an hour high. Our men could not all make shot at once, those that at first had not opportunity did it at the Indians beginning to budge away, none of our men failing; and the Indians not knowing or discerning them till the bullets were in some of their bodies, and others of them alarmed by the volleys our men gave run away, not having opportunity to fire on our men. The captain says the enemy fired but one gun, though some of our soldiers say another was fired and that the Indian quivered so that he could not hold his gun steady. However, they all ran away that had life to do it; presently at an instant, and into such a hideous thicket that our men could not see or find an Indian more. Our men killed four of them certain outright which the captain saw and is sure of others and most of the soldiers say there were six killed outright, with one that being wounded, one of our men run up and dispatched with his hatchet. They have no powder for any occasion and their visions and hinder less [sic]. Many of them were sorely wounded and no doubt run into holes to die, for our men say the brush in many places was bloody, which it was hardly possible to go in or make discovery; and Captain Colton says he saw blood on the ground as well as bushes. The Indians ran away so suddenly, being surprised, that they left their powder and ball, some judge all not having taken it into their hands that morning, though some of them snatched up their guns, also the scalps our men got from them and burnt them. Our men brought away 9 guns, 20 hatchets, 4 cutlasses, 16 or 18 horns of powder, besides 2 Barksful1 neatly covered about £1 or £2 in a barn. Our men here regained our two captives the enemy carried away, Mason’s wife and young Laurence; and so returned bringing them back in safety, leaving plunder which they made unserviceable not being able to bring it off. Upon their return they met their horses come up within two miles of them; but it was not feasible to go to the place with them, and so returned no more thither. The relation of the woman, Mason’s wife, (for the young man was tired, amazed, and dull), who is a lively and intelligent woman, is that these Indians that were at Quabaug were only 26 of them, four more of their company at first went off from them, say they belonged to Canada, were from Pemaquid.2 Designed to fall upon Nashaway, but that two of their scouts whom they sent thither brought them word. They were there watchful and in a careful posture, whether they were there or no some of them questioned; they fell out about it, could not agree whether to go, were strangers and somewhat at a loss; at last upon a high hill climbing to the top of the tree they discovered a house (which if so must [be] Laurence’s). So bent their way to Quabaug, lay about the place six days, and at last did the mischief, would not go near the fortification, told Thomas Laurence if he would tell them truly what men were in it, they would spare his life. He told them six; then presently they knocked him down and scalped him. She says her husband having no weapon "
