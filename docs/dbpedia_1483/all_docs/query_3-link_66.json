        "text": "Hi Iâ€™m Kai Sylvester and soccer is a huge part of my life! I have been playing soccer for 11 years now. I played up a year because I have always challenged myself to be better than I was the day before. I have played on recreation, club, and high school teams. That also includes an Olympic developmental team. I have been captain on both my club and high school teams, while also maintaining a 4.0 GPA. Soccer has provided me with skills to to help me build self confidence, develop responsibility, treat others with respect, as wells as teaching me beneficial habits for health and fitness to use throughout my lifetime. My goals are to take my values, ethics, and morals that I have developed through my life foundations in my academics and athletics to promote growth in my future educational and career opportunities."
