        "text": "DALLAS – Congressman Colin Allred today released “Sacred and Private”, featuring Dr. Austin Dennard, a sixth-generation Texan who was forced to flee Texas after being denied life-saving abortion care under Ted Cruz’s abortion ban. The ad will run statewide on digital platforms.\n\nThe ad holds Cruz accountable for his direct responsibility in overturning Roe v. Wade. Cruz is author of a national abortion ban, and explicitly supports a total ban with no exceptions for rape, incest, or health of the mother. Cruz celebrated the day that Roe was overturned as “nothing short of a massive victory.” He has praised Texas’ near-total abortion ban that has put women like Dennard in danger, calling it “perfectly reasonable.”\n\nAllred recently launched the ad “Pay More” focused on Cruz’s attacks on Social Security and Medicare in the Houston, San Antonio and the McAllen-Harlingen-Brownsville markets and continues to run the ad, “Right Here” in Austin, Corpus Christi and Beaumont-Port Arthur. He also is running an ad focused on securing the border, “All Hat, No Cattle” in the Dallas-Fort Worth Media Market.\n\nClick below to watch the ad.\n\nWatch here.\n\n“Sacred and Private” Ad Script:\n\nDr. Austin Dennard, 6th Generation Texan\n\nNothing prepared me for the news that the baby I desperately wanted would not survive.\n\nBecause of Ted Cruz’s abortion ban, I was forced to leave my state to get lifesaving care.\n\nTed Cruz wanted me to wait until that baby died in my womb or died in my arms.\n\nI just can’t stay silent anymore.\n\nColin Allred will keep government out of women’s medical decisions.\n\nColin Allred knows that the conversation between a woman and her doctor is sacred and private.\n\nDALLAS – Congressman Colin Allred today released the ad “Pay More”, attacking Ted Cruz for pushing to raise the retirement age for Texans on Social Security and Medicare, backing privatization plans for Medicare and voting to raise prescription drug costs. The ad also highlights Cruz’s efforts to outright cut Social Security and Medicare benefits. The ad will air in the Houston, San Antonio and the McAllen-Harlingen-Brownsville TV markets.\n\nAllred successfully worked to cap the cost of insulin at $35, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for people on Medicare and has been recognized for his leadership in protecting and expanding affordable health care, Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\nAllred continues to run the ad, “Right Here” in Corpus Christi and Beaumont-Port Arthur, and an ad focused on securing the border, “All Hat, No Cattle” in the Dallas-Fort Worth Media Market.\n\nClick below to watch the ad.\n\nWatch here.\n\n“Pay More” Ad Script:\n\nCongressman Colin Allred:\n\nI’m Colin Allred and I approve this message.\n\nVoiceover:\n\nTed Cruz is always up to somethin’… like taking Social Security we’ve paid into for decades.\n\nTed Cruz:\n\n“We should gradually increase the retirement age.”\n\nVoiceover:\n\nIncrease the retirement age, Ted?\n\nTed Cruz:\n\n“We should gradually increase the retirement age.”\n\nVoiceover:\n\nYup, he said it again…And it gets worse. Cruz said he’d privatize Medicare… and get this… voted to raise the cost of prescriptions.\n\nWith Ted Cruz, we work longer, pay more… and get less.\n\nListen Ted…Running to Cancun was bad…but you hurt us more when you’re here.\n\nDALLAS – Today, Congressman Colin Allred announced that his campaign has raised over $1 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nThis blockbuster fundraising haul comes as Allred prepares to launch Women for Allred in Dallas on Saturday, August 24, and after last night, where Allred fired up the Democratic National Convention in Chicago as the crowd started organically chanting “Beat Ted Cruz.”\n\nSeveral polls in the last several weeks have shown his race against Ted Cruz within the margin of error – including one yesterday from the University of Houston’s Hobby School of Public Affairs, that showed the race statistically tied with Cruz just two points ahead.\n\n“The enthusiasm and grassroots energy for Congressman Allred’s campaign is through the roof,” said Colin Allred for Senate Campaign Manager Paige Hutchinson. “We are thrilled by this outpouring of support, and it builds off of Allred’s work to criss-cross the state, meet Texans where they are and build a campaign to win. On November 5, Colin Allred is going to beat Ted Cruz and give Texas the leadership we need.”\n\nQuick fundraising stats since launch:\n\nAllred has outraised Cruz every quarter since he has been in the race.\n\nOver 1 million individual contributions\n\nOver $38.4 million in total receipts\n\nContributions from 250 of Texas’ 254 counties\n\nOver 443,000 individual contributors\n\nAverage donation: $35.59\n\nCHICAGO – On Thursday, August 22, Congressman Colin Allred, the Democratic Nominee for U.S. Senate, delivered a speech at the Democratic National Convention. During his speech, Allred shared his story, his support for Vice President Harris, his vision for Texas and why Texas cannot afford six more years of Ted Cruz.\n\nWATCH THE FULL SPEECH HERE.\n\nREAD THE SPEECH AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY:\n\nI’m Colin Allred, a Congressman from Dallas, a dad to two perfect little boys and this November I’m gonna beat Ted Cruz. I am so proud to be here to support our next President, Kamala Harris.\n\nYou know, like Kamala, I was raised by a single mom. Mom was a public school teacher who often worked two jobs to make ends meet… So when we talk about lowering costs, I think about the times we went to the grocery store when I was growing up and swiped the debit card and said a little prayer.\n\nBut my mom and my community in Texas gave me a chance to chase my version of the American Dream.\n\nI played football at Baylor and in the NFL… before becoming a civil rights lawyer and representing my hometown in Congress.\n\nNow, I’m the guy who is going to turn Texas’s Senate seat blue.\n\nYou know, in the NFL, we had a term for guys like Donald Trump and my opponent,Ted Cruz. “Me-guys.”\n\nYou know the type: Talk a big game. Only care about themselves. But you don’t want to be stuck with them at a barbecue.\n\nThe truth is America has never been about “ME.” As President Obama said, “The single-most powerful word in our democracy is the word ‘We.’ WE The People.’ ‘WE Shall Overcome.’ ‘Yes WE Can.'”\n\nAnd we’ve got a message for the me-guys. ‘WE’ is more powerful than ME.\n\nWE will protect and restore reproductive freedom.\n\nWE will secure the border.\n\nWE will protect Medicare and Social Security.\n\nAnd we will turn the page… and write a new chapter for this country… and elect Kamala Harris to be the next President and beat Ted Cruz.\n\nThank y’all so much. God Bless you and may God Bless Texas.\n\nDALLAS – Today, Ted Cruz spread more lies about Congressman Colin Allred’s record on the border and immigration, meanwhile every single time there are solutions supported by both parties, he says no.\n\n“On the border, we don’t need talk, we need action. And for 12 years Ted Cruz has shown us he is all talk. All politics. That’s why we need someone like Colin Allred. We know him, and we trust him to work with both parties to fix our border,” said Oscar Ugarte, Constable, Precinct 1, El Paso.\n\nAllred has earned the endorsement of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 29,000 Customs and Border Protection (CBP) employees who staff more than 300 ports of entry.\n\nAllred has consistently worked with both parties for solutions to secure the border and fix our broken immigration system. His family is from Brownsville where his grandfather worked as a customs officer. In Congress, Allred championed the recent bipartisan border security bill, and joined a Congressional task force to push for passage and other common-sense reforms to fix the broken immigration system, including the bipartisan Dignity Act. He recently introduced a bill calling for the assessment of staffing needs at the border. He has also stood up to Biden on his handling of the border.\n\nCruz’s failed record on securing the border:\n\nHe voted against the Bipartisan Border Bill in February and stated he opposed it because of the politics. The bipartisan Senate bill was endorsed by a diverse group of stakeholders, including the National Border Patrol Council, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n\nAdditionally, Cruz voted against a separate government funding package that was signed into law, which included millions in funding to hire a record 22,000 border patrol agents. After advocating against these solutions, Cruz said, “we don’t need a border bill.”\n\nABILENE – After grandstanding and repeatedly lying about Congressman Colin Allred’s campaign, Ted Cruz took only two questions at a stop in Abilene yesterday, according to KTXS (watch video of the clip here).\n\nKTXS: “Senator Cruz only allowed the media to ask two questions during his stop in Abilene. So, we couldn’t get his views on many things like abortion laws.”\n\nCruz has a long history of lying, spreading disinformation and talking about right-wing culture wars instead of actual policies impacting Texans. In a recent San Antonio Express-News report on the Texas senate race and abortion, Cruz repeatedly declined requests for an interview and even declined to answer written questions regarding his record on abortion.\n\nCruz’s record on abortion is clear:\n\nCruz has “declined to say whether the state or federal government should clarify the emergency medical exception to Texas’ abortion ban,” and has “declined multiple requests to answer questions about his stances” on abortion. He fought for years to overturn Roe v. Wade, and proudly supports an abortion ban with no exceptions. Ted Cruz has called Texas’ abortion ban “perfectly reasonable” and praised the fact that “in the state of Texas we have significant limits restricting abortion,” saying, “I agree with that.”\n\nDALLAS – In another week of crisscrossing Texas to meet Texans where they are, Congressman Colin Allred campaigned in Austin, San Antonio and Dallas this weekend. This included a roundtable with retirees in Austin, a press conference with Mayor Ron Nirenberg in San Antonio, and attending church in Dallas.\n\nCheck out some highlights below:\n\nOn Friday, Allred hosted a roundtable discussion in Austin with retirees on Social Security and Medicare. Allred slammed Ted Cruz’s continued efforts to take away Texas seniors’ hard earned benefits by slashing Social Security and Medicare. The roundtable participants also discussed with Allred his work capping the cost of insulin at $35, lowering prescription drug costs, and ensuring every Texan can retire with dignity.\n\nThat day Allred also met with executives and staff from financial technology company Ouro for a town hall on innovation benefitting Texas before joining a grassroots event with the Travis County Democratic Party.\n\nOn Saturday, Allred traveled to San Antonio to deliver the keynote address in celebration of labor champion Linda Chavez-Thompson’s 80th birthday. Chavez-Thompson was the first woman to serve as an executive officer of AFL-CIO.\n\nIn the afternoon, Allred held a joint press conference at the Riverwalk with Mayor Ron Nirenberg who announced his endorsement of Allred, noting his record of working with both parties to deliver results for Texans.\n\nAllred wrapped up his day with Kristian Carranza, candidate for TX HD-118 to kickoff at a grassroots block walk with supporters in San Antonio as part of his coordinated campaign, Texas Offense.\n\nAllred finished his weekend on the trail attending two services at Concord Church back in Dallas worshiping with his fellow Texans.\n\nAustin:\n\nSan Antonio:\n\nDallas:\n\nDALLAS – In a sit-down interview with WFAA, Ted Cruz spent 20 minutes lying throughout the full interview about his own record and on issues important to Texans. He lied about bipartisanship, the border, abortion, energy policy and once again opened the door to denying the results of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWatch the interview here.\n\nTop Lies from Lyin’ Ted:\n\n1. Cruz said he is “working to bring together bipartisan coalitions to accomplish big victories for the people of Texas…”\n\nFALSE: Ted Cruz is ranked the 9th most partisan senator in Washington. Reviewing partisanship since 1993, the Lugar Center rated Cruz as 245 out of 250 in terms of bipartisanship, making him one of the most partisan senators of the last 30 years. He has voted against major bipartisan legislation including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS Act, and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.\n\n2. When asked about his authoring of a federal abortion ban proposal, Cruz said “That is absolutely not true.”\n\nFALSE: Ted Cruz authored a national abortion ban proposal, and explicitly supports a total ban with no exceptions for rape, incest, or health of the mother. He is hiding and won’t answer questions about his support for the Texas ban he is responsible for, and he signed onto a resolution this year “celebrating” the Dobbs decision.\n\n3. “Colin Allred and other Democrats are trying to scare people into believing IVF is in jeopardy.”\n\nFALSE: The reason we are even talking about IVF is because of people like Ted Cruz and his decades long work to end Roe v. Wade. Cruz has voiced support for so-called federal “personhood” measures that would threaten IVF, birth control and further limit reproductive rights.\n\n4. “[Allred] has repeatedly voted for open borders. He’s repeatedly voted against securing the border.”\n\nFALSE: Allred has never once voted or supported “open border” legislation. In fact he stood up to President Biden, voting to condemn his handling of the border while supporting bipartisan initiatives to secure the border, surge resources and assess staffing needs. Throughout his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has repeatedly opposed bipartisan legislation, including a bill backed by the Border Patrol Union, to secure the border because of politics.\n\n5. “Congressman Allred’s record has been hard left...” When pushed that Allred is “constantly ranked as one of the most bipartisan members of Congress,” Cruz says “he gets left wing groups to say that.”\n\nFALSE: Allred has been named the most bipartisan member of the Texas delegation by the non-partisan Common Ground Committee. 70% of all legislation he supports is supported by both Democrats and Republicans. Allred was one of just 32 Democrats endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in his re-election campaign and received their Jefferson-Hamilton Award for his bipartisanship.\n\n6. “[Allred] voted with Joe Biden in favor of Joe Biden’s halting the export of liquid natural gas.”\n\nFALSE: Allred voted against a bill that would completely restructure the regulation of LNG exports. Allred has called on the Administration to end the LNG export pause to protect Texas energy jobs.\n\n7. “[Allred has] authored and passed 3 bills into law… I have authored and passed 100 different pieces of legislation.”\n\nFALSE: According to Congress.gov, Allred has sponsored or cosponsored 48 bills that have become law during his six years in Congress. In double that time in office, Cruz has sponsored or cosponsored 61 bills that have become law. This does not include language or amendments Allred secured in legislation that became law.\n\n8. “You’re about the only person in the state of Texas…that has actually interviewed Colin Allred…he doesn’t answer questions, he doesn’t talk about his record.”\n\nFALSE: Allred has done more than 30 open press events and interviews in July and August."
