It has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the Legislature”; and\n\nWHEREAS, Congress has mostly abdicated its Article I responsibilities to authorize andoversee military actions by extensive, potentially permanent delegations of congressional war powers;and\n\nWHEREAS, the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed after the September 11 attacks has now been in effect for more than twice as long as the 1964-1971 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which gave President Lyndon B. Johnson authorization, without a formaldeclaration of war by Congress, for the use of conventional military force in Southeast Asia; and\n\nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Defense’s 2018 National Defense Strategyoutlines a scenario where great power competition, rather than counterterrorism, drives the department’s decision making and use of force; and\n\nWHEREAS, a growing number of foreign policy officials have begun to advocate for a drawdown in the Middle East and Central Asia because of the opportunity costs to America’s mission of balancing its strength against the so-called revisionist powers of China and Russia; and\n\nWHEREAS, the emphasis on bolstering a deterrent posture in Asia and Europe shouldhave an attendant impact that reduces the United States military’s activities in the Middle East, Africa and the Western Hemisphere; and\n\nWHEREAS, from global pandemics to the support of weak and fragile states, the United States faces an unprecedented number of complex global threats that cannot be solved by military power alone;and\n\nWHEREAS, a disproportionate amount of resources is going to military and intelligencesolutions along with a more general sidelining of diplomacy amid a continuing militarization of foreign policy;and\n\nWHEREAS, addressing the root causes of violent conflicts overseas through developmentand diplomacy helps protect Americans and helps reduce the need to send our service members into harm’s way;now, therefore, be it\n\nRESOLVED: That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and request that the Congressof the United States work to renew a proper constitutional balance in American foreign policy decision making by repealing and replacing outdated authorizations for the use of military force; andbe it further\n\nRESOLVED: That We, your Memorialists, advocate for the importance of a civilian-ledapproach to elevating development and diplomacy along with a strong defense in order to build a better, safer world;and be it further\n\nRESOLVED: That suitable copies of this resolution, duly authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to the Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the United States; the President of the United States Senate; the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States; and each Member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n\nComes from the Senate, READ and ADOPTED.\n\n_________________________________\n\n(1-2) The following Joint Resolution: (S.P. 565)\n\nJOINT RESOLUTION TO REAFFIRM THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MAINE AND TAIWAN AND SUPPORT BILATERAL TRADE RELATIONS AND TAIWAN’S INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATION\n\nWHEREAS,the United States and the Republic of China (Taiwan) share a vibrant bilateral relationship marked by a mutually beneficial partnership, supported by our common values of freedom, democracy, rule of law and a free market economy, and our countries now enjoy the strongest relations ever; and\n\nWHEREAS, President Tsai Ing-wen has worked tirelessly to ensure the prosperity of Taiwan’s 23.5 million people and promote international standing and has expressed commitment to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region; and\n\nWHEREAS, the United States Department of State, Department of Commerce and Department of Agriculture clarified United States policy regarding Taiwan in a formal letter sent to governors of all 50 states dated November 21, 2019 stating that “expanding relations with Taiwan in areas such as trade, education, investment, and tourism is fully compatible with and supports U.S. policy and can be beneficial to your state or municipality”;and\n\nWHEREAS, President Tsai has expressed Taiwan’s desire to reach a bilateral tradeagreement with the United States, and the 116th United States Congress’s Public Law 116-135, “Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 2019,” affirms that the United States should engage in strengthening bilateral trade and economic relations with Taiwan;and\n\nWHEREAS, New England exported more than $1 billion in goods to Taiwan in 2020, of which Maine exported $52 million in goods, mostly in computer and electronic products, fish and other marine products, machinery and chemicals, making Taiwan Maine’s 12th largest export market in the world and the 7th largest export market in Asia in 2019, and Taiwan and the United States seek to increase trade and investment through a bilateral trade agreement, resulting in even greater Maine exports to Taiwan, educational and cultural exchange, scientific and technological interests and tourism; and\n\nWHEREAS, Taiwan is a key transport hub in the Asia-Pacific region, making its inclusionin international organizations such as the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Police Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization imperative for the best interests and safety of the international community. In addition, Taiwan’s inclusion in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is important to the global effort to combat climate change; now, therefore, be it\n\nRESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirtieth Legislature now assembled in the First Special Session, on behalf of the people we represent, reaffirm the friendship between Maine and the Republic of China (Taiwan), and we continue to supportefforts to further strengthen United States-Taiwan and Maine-Taiwan trade and investment relations and support Taiwan’s participation in international organizations and agreements, including the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Police Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and encourage the further exploration of ways to strengthen and promote bilateral exchange between Maine and Taiwan, including the possibility of signing a driver’s license reciprocity agreement with Taiwan, which would lead to a further increase in trade and people-to-people exchanges; and be it further\n\nRESOLVED: That suitable copies of this resolution, duly authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to the Honorable Joseph R. Biden, President of the United States, the members of the Maine Congressional Delegation, the Honorable Janet Mills, Governor of Maine, the Honorable Tsai Ing-wen, President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and Jonathan Sun, Director-General of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nComes from the Senate, READ and ADOPTED.\n\n_________________________________\n\nNon-Concurrent Matter\n\n(1-3) Bill \"An Act To Make Election Day a State Holiday\"\n\n(H.P. 202) (L.D. 286)\n\nBill and accompanying papers COMMITTED to the Committee on STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT in the House on April 28, 2021.\n\nComes from the Senate with the Majority (8) OUGHT NOT TO PASS Report of the Committee on STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT READ and ACCEPTED in NON-CONCURRENCE.\n\n_________________________________\n\nNon-Concurrent Matter\n\n(1-4) Bill \"An Act To Protect the Private Information of Maine Residents\"\n\n(S.P. 535) (L.D. 1714)\n\nREFERRED to the Committee on ENERGY, UTILITIES AND TECHNOLOGY in the House on May 19, 2021.\n\nComes from the Senate with that Body having INSISTED on its former action whereby the Bill was REFERRED to the Committee on INNOVATION, DEVELOPMENT, ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT AND BUSINESS in NON-CONCURRENCE.\n\n_________________________________\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\n(2-1) The Following Communication: (H.P. 1280)\n\nSTATE OF MAINE\n\nCLERK'S OFFICE\n\n2 STATE HOUSE STATION\n\nAUGUSTA, MAINE 04333-0002\n\nMay 25, 2021\n\nHonorable Ryan M.

The report, which is based on data collected from wholesalers of both motor fuel oil and home heating oil, includes maps depicting relative concentration in designated markets throughout the State. This report is also available on the Attorney General's website at: https://www.maine.gov/ag/docs/Bi­annual%20PMSA%20Report%202019-20.pdf\n\nSince no refiners of petroleum products operate retail outlets in this State, we recommend no legislation to limit or curtail such operations.\n\nI appreciate this opportunity to provide this information and hope it is useful.\n\nSincerely,\n\nS/Aaron M.
