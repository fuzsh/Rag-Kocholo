        "text": "As the bright and spunky Laura \"Half Pint\" Ingalls on \"Little House on the Prairie\" (NBC, 1974-1983), Melissa Gilbert was one of the most loved child actors of the 1970s, and remained a viewer favorite in subsequent decades through a substantial list of dramatic made-for-TV movies that traded on her can-do screen image. Gilbert found her niche both on and off the screen. In the former, she was a go-to for sudsy romances or reality-based melodramas like \"Cries from the Heart\" (CBS, 1994) or \"Zoya\" (NBC, 1995), while in the latter, she was the third and longest-running female president of the Screen Actors Guild, where she served two terms. The enduring status of \"Little House\" in reruns, combined with her active television career, ensured that the beloved Gilbert would remain a fixture on the small screen for years to come.\n\nSara Gilbert, born as Sara Rebecca Abeles on January 29, 1975, is a renowned American actress and television producer. Gilbert originates from Santa Monica, California, where she was brought up alongside four older siblings. She developed an interest in acting at a young age, leading to her first role on television at the age of six in a Kool-Aid advertisement. However, it was her portrayal of Darlene Conner on the popular sitcom Roseanne from 1988 to 1997 that thrust her into the limelight and earned her two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Gilbert's career trajectory did not stop there. After her successful stint on Roseanne, she continued to make her mark on television by starring in the CBS series The Big Bang Theory as Leslie Winkle, a recurring character that further showcased her acting prowess. Additionally, she ventured into production, co-hosting and executive producing the daytime talk show The Talk from 2010 to 2019, a role that won her a Daytime Emmy in 2016 for Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host. In 2018, Gilbert reprised her role as Darlene Conner in the revival of Roseanne, followed by a spin-off series The Conners. Beyond her professional achievements, Gilbert's personal life also gained public attention. She publicly came out as a lesbian in 2010, becoming an influential figure in the LGBTQ+ community. Gilbert shares two children with television producer Allison Adler, although their relationship ended in 2011. Later, in 2014, she married songwriter and former 4 Non Blondes frontwoman, Linda Perry, with whom she has one son. Gilbert continues to be a strong advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, using her platform to raise awareness and promote diversity in Hollywood.\n\nPaul Brandon Gilbert (born November 6, 1966) is an American hard rock and heavy metal guitarist. He is best known for being the co-founder of the band Mr. Big. He was also a member of Racer X, with whom he released several albums. In 1996, Gilbert launched a solo career, for which he has released numerous solo albums, and featured in numerous collaborations and guest appearances on other musicians' albums. Gilbert has been voted fourth-best on GuitarOne magazine's \"Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time\". He has also ranked in Guitar World's \"50 Fastest Guitarists of All Time\" list."
