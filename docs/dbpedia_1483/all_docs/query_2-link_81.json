Beers & Co - Published 1903\n\nWILLIAM L. HIGGINS, M. D., a noted physician of South Coventry, Tolland county, comes of an old family of the state of Massachusetts.\n\nJacob Higgins, the grandfather of Dr. William L., was born in Chesterfield, Mass., Dec. 1, 1811, and died May 6, 1894, at Cummington, Mass. He was twice married, first to Eliza Moore, and afterward to Miss Julia Prentice. He was a tanner by trade, and owned a farm property near the William Cullen Bryant place, in Cummington, Mass. His children were: Orlando, of Illinois; Lorenzo, of Kansas; Judson A., deceased, who was a prominent member of the Baptist Church. and a very devout man; Martin L., the Doctor's father; and Nelson, Amy and Eugene, all three deceased.\n\nMartin L. Higgins was born in Chesterfield, Mass., June I5, 1845, and was married there to Elizabeth S. Hayden, a native of Westhampton, Mass., who was born Sept. 3, 1843, daughter of John and Eliza (Wetherell) Hayden. Mr. Higgins has always remained in his native town, where he has been engaged in agricultural pursuits up to the present time, having farmed on his present place for thirty years. He is a careful, conservative man, and has met with deserved success. A Republican in politics, he has taken a leading part in local improvements, serving as selectman for three years and town treasurer for four years. He\n\nattends the Congregational Church. Mr. and Mrs. Higgins have had the following children: William L., whose name appears above; Minnie L., now the wife of George I. Blanchard. of Montpelier, Vt.; Helen Jane, wife of Milo E. Sylvester, of Springfield, Mass.; and Harry E., M. D., a graduate of the Medical Department of the University of the City of New York, I896, and since a practitioner of Norwich, Connecticut.\n\nWilliam L. Higgins was born in Chesterfield, Mass., March 8, 1867. His education was begun in that district, and was continued in the city schools of Northampton, and at Deerfield Academy, Deerfield, Mass., where he took an elective course. He finished his academic work when about eighteen, working on the farm in summer, and teaching school winters. For three terms he taught school in Hinsdale, Mass., and for one term in Westhampton, after which he took up the study of medicine under the direction of Dr. Charles H. Curran and of Dr. A. M. Belden, at Holyoke and Chesterfield, respectively. His studies at the Medical Department of the University of the City of New York were completed and he was graduated with the class of 1890. At the close of his course he located at Willington, Conn., where he remained until September, 1891, when he removed to South Coventry, to take the place of Dr. E. P. Flint, who at that time was removing to Rockville. Since his arrival Dr. Higgins has continued steadily at his work, winning many friends, and making himself recognized as the leading physician of the town. He has been very successful in practice, and is called frequently in consultation, considerable for a young man.\n\nDr. Higgins was married at Northampton, Mass., Oct. 8, 1890, to Annah J. Clapp, daughter of James and Juliette A. (Miller) Clapp, of Williamsburg, Mass., and they have had two children: Ruth A., born Nov. 20, 1891, and Ruby Elizabeth. born March 6, 1894. Both the Doctor and his wife are members of the Congregational Church, in the work of which he takes an active part, and he has been Sunday-school superintendent in both Willington and Chesterfield. For seven years he has been on the parish committee, and upon the incorporation of the church, in the fall of 19O1, was elected to the board of trustees for three years from Jan. 1, 1902.\n\nThe Doctor is a stanch Republican, and has been interested in local politics ever since his removal to South Coventry. However, he has confined his public services to offices of a professional nature, having acted seven years as health officer, and for eleven years as medical examiner for the towns of Coventry and Andover. He was elected justice of the peace several times, but each time felt that other duties prevented him from qualifying, though so far as his professional duties permit he has directly interested himself in public enterprises and given his fellow townsmen the benefit of his ability and judgment in such matters. He was one of the original promoters of the South Coventry Water Supply Company. one of its largest stockholders, and became a director and vice-president thereof. In 1897 he organized what is known as the Village Improvement Society, of which he has been a director ever since, and has served one term as president. This company has expended about three thousand dollars in improvements during the five years of its existence. The Doctor has always been interested in agricultural matters, is a member of the Grange. and is vice-president and one of the directors of the Horse Shoe Park Agricultural Association, which was organized in April, 1902.\n\nIn addition to attending to his private practice the Doctor acts as medical examiner for all of the old line insurance companies. and for Lodge No. 15, A. O. U. W., at South Coventry. He was President of the Tolland County Medical Association in 1897-98, and the same year was vice-president exofiicio of the State Medical Society. Dr. Higgins is a selfâmade man, and enjoys high standing in his community.\n\nhttp://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7179570\n\nWilliam Lincoln Higgins\n\nClick image to enlarge\n\n1930; Census Place: Coventry, Tolland, Connecticut; Roll: 284; Page: 6B; Enumeration District: 4; Image: 50\n\nName Age (No image available)\n\nWilliam L Higgins 63 b.

He was educated in the public schools and the Episcopal Academy at Cheshire, Conn., and was graduated at Princeton University with the degree of CE. in 1903. He subsequently took a course in economics at Columbia University. After leaving Princeton he became connected with the F. M. Stillman Co., general contractors, as a draftsman. Eighteen months later he was made engineer of the company, and in this capacity had charge of heavy construction about New York harbor, heavy building operations, foundations, masonry, harbor improvements and steel bridges. In 1909 he opened offices as consulting engineer in Jersey City and later in New York and has since been engaged in private practice. He has specialized principally in heavy constructions in timber, masonry and steel. He designed and built in 1905 the first reinforced concrete building constructed in Newark, N. J.\n\nIn 1907 he designed and supervised the construction of a system of groins or jetties on the seashore at Asbury Park, N. J., to prevent further erosion of the coast by the ocean. The effectiveness and success of his groin system was demonstrated during the unusually severe storms of December, 1913, and January, 1914, which destroyed many buildings along the New Jersey coast, but did no damage whatever at Asbury Park. In 1910 Mr. Higgins designed a group of buildings for W. Ames & Co. in Jersey City, comprising a large industrial plant for the manufacture of bar iron, spikes and bolts. He was made a registered architect of the state of New Jersey in 1911. He was engineer of the transit commission of Jersey City in 1910-11 and was a member of the city plan commission of that city for one term (1912). He has under construction a pier on the New Jersey shore, opposite Eightieth street, New York, and a skeleton frame steel building in Johnstown, Pa. He was consulting engineer of the Washington Market Merchants' Association in 1913, and was architect for the city in planning and supervising the remodeling of the market in 1914. He served two terms of enlistment (four years), 1904-08, in the engineer and signal corps of the National Guard of New Jersey. Mr. Higgins is a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American Society for Testing Materials, the Engineers' Club and the Princeton Club of New York. Since its incorporation on Apr. 13, 1912, he has been secretary of the Princeton Engineering Association.

He concentrates his business attention largely upon the sale of butter, eggs and milk, upon the conduct of a farm and upon the management of two livery stables which he owns.\n\nHis home place is at Meriden and he is numbered among the native sons of Cheshire, Connecticut, where his birth occurred February 18, 1862, his parents being Michael and Esther (Bennett) Higgins. He acquired a public school education and spent the vacation periods in farm work, while after his textbooks were put aside he continued to assist in the cultivation and further improvement of the home farm until he attained his majority. He afterward spent nine months in work upon the farm of James Sanford at Terryville, Connecticut, and later worked on the State Poor Farm for a year.\n\nOn the expiration of that period he returned to his old home in Cheshire to visit and his brother induced him to buy a milk wagon and horse and engage in selling milk in Meriden. This was in 1886. He worked hard to make the business a success and succeeded in it. He took over his brother's milk business and worked up a good patronage. He is now extensively engaged in this line and also in the sale of butter and eggs. He is today the owner of an excellent farm property in addition to his other interests. He keeps from eighty to ninety horses and he has in all twenty employes in his livery barns, in his butter, egg and milk business and on his farm.\n\nOn the 8th of August, 1889, Mr. Higgins was united in marriage in Yalesville, Connecticut, to Miss Emma Grouse and they have become the parents of three children. Esther May, who was educated in the high school and in the New Haven Normal School is engaged in teaching. Ruth Frances is at home. Arthur John was graduated from the high school with the class of 1917 and is attending Dartmouth College. He was very popular as a high school pupil, was chairman of the junior prom, was manager of the foot ball team and was otherwise a leader in high school activities.\n\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Higgins are consistent members of the Methodist Episcopal church. Politically he is a democrat, and although he has never been an office seeker, his friends have frequently urged him to become a candidate for positions of public honor and trust and he was elected to office on the democratic ticket when his ward had a normal heavy republican majority. He served as councilman from the third ward for six years and in 1913 was elected a selectman. He was also a member of the board of apportionment for ten years and his public duties have been discharged with marked capability and fidelity.\n\nIn fraternal circles he is known as a member of Temple Lodge, No. 16, F. & A. M, of Cheshire, and as a member of the Benevolent Protective Order of Elks at Meriden, serving on its house committee. He is also on the membership rolls of the Amaranth, the Colonial and the Cosmopolitan Clubs. He has a wide and favorable acquaintance through this section of the state, in which he has always resided, and his work along business lines and in public office has constituted a valuable contribution to general progress and improvement.\n\nHIGGINS-MICHAEL-31-M-W-IREL-CT-NEW_HAVEN-CHESHIRE-1860\n\nName Age\n\nMichael Higgins 31\n\nEsther Higgins 28\n\nJoseph Higgins 7\n\nJohn B Higgins 4\n\nMary E Higgins 2\n\nMary Higgins 2/12\n\nHIGGINS-MICHAEL-42-M-W-IREL-CT-NEW_HAVEN-CHESHIRE-1870\n\nName Age\n\nMichael Higgins 42\n\nEsther Higgins 39\n\nJoseph Higgins 16\n\nJohn Higgins 14\n\nMaria Higgins 12\n\nCatharine Higgins 10\n\nDavid Higgins 8\n\nAnnie Higgins 4\n\nHousehold:1880\n\nName Relation Marital Status Gender Race Age Birthplace Occupation Father's Birthplace Mother's Birthplace\n\nMichael HIGGINS Self W Male W 50 IRE Keeper IRE IRE\n\nCatharine E.

Clarke Publishing Company 1918\n\nRichard T Higgins Portrait\n\nHON. RICHARD T. HIGGINS.\n\nHon. Richard T. Higgins is a well known citizen of Winsted, Connecticut, whose high position is indicated in the fact that he has been chosen as president of the public utilities commission. He was born in Washington, this state, September 24, 1865, the eldest son of Edward and Mary (Crowley) Higgins, both of whom were natives of Ireland but have now passed away. They became acquainted and were married in New Milford, Connecticut. The father, who was born in County Kilkenny, Ireland, devoted his life to the occupation of farming and was called to his final rest September 22. 1901, at the age of sixty-three years. His wife was born in County Westmeath. Ireland, and passed away January 2, 1908. Both came to the United States in early life. They became the parents of three children, Catherine, Richard T. and Bernard E. The daughter became the wife of Martin Dooley and both have passed away but four children survive them. Bernard E. Higgins is a well known lawyer of Torrington mentioned elsewhere in this work.\n\nHon. Richard T. Higgins was but four years of age when his parents removed to Woodbury, Connecticut, where he was reared on a farm near the town of Woodbury. He pursued his early education in the public schools and later became a student in the Parker Academy, in the town of Woodbury, being there graduated with the class of 1883. He afterward received his collegiate education in St. Francis' College of New York city. He studied law in the office of Huntington & Warner of Woodbury and was admitted to the bar in May, 1890. In January, 1891, he opened a law office in Winsted, where he has since actively engaged in practice, occupying a prominent position in legal circles for a quarter of a century. He is a man of pronounced ability in handling cases, which he most carefully and systematically prepares, and is therefore well qualified to meet any attack of the opposing counsel. He is clear in his reasoning, logical in his deductions and seldom, if ever, at fault in the application of a legal principle. He has been accorded a very extensive clientage and colleagues and contemporaries speak of him in terms of high regard.\n\nMr. Higgins has also figured prominently in political circles. He gives his allegiance to the democratic party and while he has not sought nor desired office as a reward for party fealty his public-spirited citizenship and his keen sagacity concerning public affairs have made his opinions of worth and of weight. He has served as a member of the lower house of the state legislature, filling that position during 1909, and was the democratic leader during that session. Previously he had served as coroner of Litchfield county from 1892 until 1910, when he resigned to accept a position on the state railroad commission, to which he was appointed by Governor Weeks. He was made chairman of the railroad commission in February, 1911, and in September of that year the railroad commission went out of existence, being superseded by the state public utilities commission. Mr. Higgins became a member of the latter at its creation by appointment of Governor Baldwin and\n\nwas at once elected its chairman and has continuously served in that position to the present time, having been reappointed by Governor Holcomb, a republican governor, during the legislative session of 1917 for another term of six years. Thus his service on the two commissions already covers seven years. He has undoubtedly acted in this capacity at great personal sacrifice, giving much attention to the duties of the position, notwithstanding the fact that his law practice would be much more worth while. On the 21st of June, 1917, Mr. Higgins, upon recommendation of the governor of Connecticut, was appointed by President Woodrow Wilson a member of the local exemption board for Division No. 19 of Litchfield county and was later made its chairman, and after the work of the first draft was practically completed in September, 1917, he resigned owing to the press of work in his office at the state capitol. He devoted his entire attention to his duties on the\n\nexemption board for two months. Besides his official service and his law practice he has in other ways been connected with public interests, having been one of the incorporators of the Winsted Savings Bank.\n\nOn the 1st of September, 1898, Mr. Higgins was married to Miss Margaret Rose Bryan, of Winsted, who is a native, however, of Waterbury. They have an only son, Bryan Edward Higgins. born March 6, 1901, and now a senior in the Gilbert high school.\n\nMr. Higgins is a member of St. Joseph's Roman Catholic church. He is a past exalted ruler of the Elks lodge, in which he has a life membership, is a past grand knight of the Knights of Columbus and is a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians. He is now a trustee of the Litchfield County Hospital, is a member of the Winsted Club, of the Greenwoods Country Club and the Fraternal Benefit League, of the Litchfield County Bar Association and the American Bar Association, his identification with all these showing the nature and breadth of his interests and activities. After all the practice of law is his real life work and from 1900 until 1912 he was corporation counsel for the town of Winchester but was obliged to resign because of his service on the public utilities commission. He also filled the position of prosecuting attorney of the town of Winchester for two years or from May, 1902, to April, 1904, and at one time he was county coroner, corporation counsel and prosecuting attorney, filling all positions at the same time. He served as a member of the fourth district school committee for two years and was chairman of the committee having in charge the remodeling of the courthouse in Winsted in 1905-6. He has been prosecuting attorney for the Connecticut Humane Society for nearly a quarter of a century. He is widely recognized as an able lawyer, quick-witted and resourceful, thoroughly familiar with the principles of jurisprudence and able in the application of such a principle to a point involved.\n\nalso\n\nSource: The judicial and civil history of Connecticut By Dwight Loomis, Joseph Gilbert Calhoun - Published 1895\n\nRichard T.

BERNARD E. HIGGINS.\n\nHon. Bernard E. Higgins, attorney of Torrington, was born in Woodbury, Connecticut, January 31, 1872, his parents being Edward and Mary (Crowley) Higgins, both of whom were natives of Ireland. They became acquainted in New Milford, Connecticut, however, and were there married. It was in 1859 that the father crossed the Atlantic and after remaining for a time in New Milford he established his home near the village of Woodbury, where he engaged in farming until his death. His wife has also passed away. They were parents of three children, a daughter, Catherine Dooley, deceased, and two sons, one of whom, the Hon. Richard T. Higgins, of Winsted, Connecticut, was formerly the democratic leader in the house of representatives and is the present chairman of the public utilities committee of the state, becoming the first incumbent in that office through appointment of Governor Baldwin in 1911, since which time he has occupied the position. He is recognized as a very prominent and influential figure in democratic circles, while his brother, Bernard E. Higgins of this review, is an equally stanch supporter of republican principles, although not a politician in the sense of office holding.\n\nBernard E. Higgins attended the Parker Academy at Woodbury and at the age of seventeen became a public school teacher, which profession he followed for a year and a half. At nineteen years of age he took up the study of law in the office of Huntington & Warner, attorneys of Woodbury, and was admitted to the bar in June, 1897. On October 20th of that year he entered upon active practice in Torrington, where he has since followed his profession with gratifying success. Since 1898 he has been associated in law practice with Hon. Gideon H. Welch. He is very careful and painstaking in the preparation of his cases and his ability has brought him prominently to the front, much important litigation being entrusted to his care.\n\nOn the 11th of May, 1898, Mr. Higgins was married to Miss Rose Beegan, of Woodbury, who had been his schoolmate, the acquaintance continuing from their childhood days. Mr. Higgins is a past exalted ruler of Torrington Lodge, No. 372, B. P. O. E., and he also belongs to St. Francis Roman Catholic church. His political endorsement has always been given to the republican party and he has served as clerk of the borough of Torrington for about five years. He was afterward prosecuting attorney for the town of Torrington for ten consecutive years, and in 1912-13 he served as a member of the state legislature, during which time he was on the judiciary committee. He was also states attorney of Litchfield county, filling out the unexpired term of Donald P. Warner from March 17, 1917, to June 4, 1917. He is at present judge of the borough court of Torrington, and in his profession he has made a creditable name and place.\n\n...........................................\n\n12 Jan 2008\n\nNew London, Connecticut City Directory 1882\n\nHiggins, William ,BlackSmith,114 Bank,h 174 Bank\n\nNew London, Connecticut City Directory 1885\n\nHiggins, William ,Carriagemaker.116 Bank,h 174 Bank\n\nNew London, Connecticut City Directory 1887\n\nHiggins, William ,Carriagemaker,116 Bank, h 108 Bank\n\nHousehold:1880\n\n(Address of 174 Bank matches City Directory)\n\nName Relation Marital Status Gender Race Age\n\nBirthplace Occupation Father's Birthplace Mother'sBirthplace\n\nWilliam HIGGINS Self M Male W 28 IRE Blacksmith IREIRE\n\nMaggie HIGGINS Wife M Female W 26 IRE Keeping House IRE IRE\n\nJohn HIGGINS Son S Male W 6 CT IRE IRE\n\nMary HIGGINS Dau S Female W 4 CT IRE IRE\n\nWillie HIGGINS Son S Male W 2 CT IRE IRE\n\nLawrence HIGGINS Son S Male W 3M CT IRE IRE\n\nSource Information:\n\nCensus Place New London, New London, Connecticut Family History Library Film 1254107\n\nNA Film Number T9-0107 Page Number 95A\n\nlisted next door\n\nBridget HIGGINS Self W Female W 66 IRE Keeps House IRE IRE\n\n.....\n\n20 Dec 2007\n\nhttp://www.sunjournal.com/story/240650-3/Obituaries/Arthur_E_Higgins/\n\n-Arthur Eugene Higgins -\n\nSun-Journal - (Nov/28/2007)\n\nArthur E. Higgins\n\nBRANFORD, Conn. - Arthur Eugene Higgins, 85, of North Haven, Conn., a warm and generous-hearted man, died at Connecticut Hospice on Nov. 18, of complications from cancer.\n\nHe was born Aug. 11, 1922, in Lisbon, the son of Ivory Ephraim Higgins and Elsie Marion Bowie Higgins. He graduated from Bates College in 1943. A gifted musician at an early age, he felt called instead to the ministry. He enrolled at Yale Divinity School, where he met Anne Olding Hall of Fairfield, Conn., a graduate of Smith College. They were married in 1944 and lived happily together for more than 63 years.\n\nGraduating from Yale Divinity School in 1946, the couple co-pastored two parishes in upstate New York until he accepted a call to the United Church in Chester, Conn. in 1951. In 1955, he became pastor of the Congregational Church in Wilton, Conn., which grew significantly in every respect during his tenure. During this time, he and Anne purchased hilltop property in Braintree, Vt., which they, their children and grandchildren have enjoyed for more than 50 years.\n\nSuccess in Wilton placed him in a position of influence within what became the Connecticut Conference of the United Church of Christ (UCC). He was a leader in civil rights and social justice movements, both within Connecticut and nationally. He left the Wilton church to serve full time on the UCC Conference staff, principally working on housing and other social justice issues. Seeking greater visibility for the church's social action work among corporations and government, he created the New Samaritan Corporation in 1971. New Samaritan and its affiliated management companies grew to become Connecticut's largest nonprofit manager of housing for the aging and families.\n\nHe served two years as the acting conference minister of the UCC, before retiring in 1989. He also served for 11 years during this time on the board of directors of MacDermid Inc., a specialty chemical company based in Waterbury, Conn., acting as a boardroom advocate for corporate social and ethical responsibility.

A.. Hartford, Conn.. J. A. Spalding. 1891\n\n-JOHN E. HIGGINS-\n\nHartford City Town Clerk & Registrar\n\nJohn E Higgins has held the position as city clerk in the state capital since 1874,with the exception of one year, and the office of town clerk and registrar of births, marriages and deaths without interval during the same period. His career in these offices has been one of marked success and satisfaction. While Mr. Higgins is a pronounced democrat in politics,his course as a public official has been so characterized by devotion to the interests of the community, without regard to partisan lines, that men of all parties politically have given him an enthusiastic support at the polls, ensuring his retention in office, no matter how popular a competitor might be in the field against him. The plan of placing his name on both tickets has prevailed for a number of years. Of course, it is impossible to consider majorities under such circumstances. A gentleman whose public career attracts all classes of citizens ,irrespective of political affiliations, deserves the heartiest of commendations. It would be a mistake ,however, to presume city clerk Higgins owes his success simply to good fellowship and affable manners. While he possesses these traits beyond even most public favorites, his reception of popular suffrage has depended, in the main, on the character and value of his services. There is not a town clerks office in the state that is more intelligently conducted than the Hartford office. The systematic classification of town records, the order and precision with which the work of the office is managed, and the uniform courtesy with which the public has been treated have made the office the model one in Connecticut. This is not saying a word beyond what the place merits. As city clerk, Mr. Higgins is Ex Officio clerk of the board of Alderman of Hartford. It is in this capacity that most of his public work has been accomplished. The journal of the board, which is prepared and printed under the city clerks hand, is far superior as an official production to the journals of the State Legislature. The Yearbook, which is also edited and arranged by Mr. Higgins, is sought for far and wide by the municipal governments. Great improvements have been made in both the town and city clerkships during Mr. Higgins incumbency of these offices. The subject of this sketch was born in New London, June 19,1844 and received a public school education. At the out break of the war he was a teacher in the Portland public schools. The position was resigned for military service of that period. Mr. Higgins became a member of the 3rd United States Artillery, and was in the army for three years. He is a proud member of Robert O. Tyler post of the Grand Army in Hartford, and has taken an active part in the the noted veteran assemblages and demonstrations that have occurred in the city since the war. He is also a member of the Green Cross Council, Knights of Columbus, and of the Hartford Lodge of Elks. City Clerk Higgins is a member of the Roman Catholic church in this city, being connected at present with the cathedral parish; but for 25 years he was a member and attendant of St. Peter's. The wife of Mr. Higgins, who is held in the most thorough esteem in the community, was Miss Adella E. Collins, prior to marriage. There are no children if the family. Mr. Higgins removed to Hartford from New London after the war, and was employed for eight years in the Colt Works. He was first elected City Clerk in 1874, and from that time until now he has been an occupant of public office and position.\n\nHousehold:1880\n\nName Relation Marital Status Gender Race Age Birthplace Occupation Father's Birthplace Mother's Birthplace\n\nJohn E.

He was clerk of the city of Hartford from 1874 to 1880 and from 1881 to the present time; and town clerk and registrar of vital statistics since 1877, still holding both offices. He is a member of the Hartford Board of Trade.\n\nadded 20 Apr 2012\n\nSource: Commemorative biographical record of Hartford County, Connecticut -Volume 1By Beers, J. H. & Co - Published 1901\n\nJOHN E. HIGGINS (deceased), for many years the capable and popular city and town clerk, also registrar of vital statistics, Hartford, was a native of Connecticut, born June 19, 1844, in New London, where he received a substantial public school education.\n\nEdward Higgins, his father, born in Ireland, was a quarryman by occupation, and came to Portland, Conn., where he worked for several years in the quarry there, and passed the rest of his days, dying at the age of seventy-one years. He married Mary McDoland, also a native of Ireland, and by her had six children, three of whom are living: Elizabeth, widow of Patrick Lawler, of Middletown; Mary, widow of James Murphy, of Middletown; and Margaret. The mother was called from earth at the age of sixtyÂ­six, and her parents both died at advanced years, the father at the age of seventy-nine, the mother when seventy-three.\n\nJohn E. Higgins was a small boy when the family moved from New London to Portland, Conn., and he there received his education at the public schools, the present State Secretary Clark being his teacher. At the outbreak of the Civil war Mr. Higgins was a teacher in the Portland public schools, having received his appointment through Mr. Clark, but this position he resigned to enlist, in 1862, as musician, in the 3rd United States Artillery, serving under Maj.-Gen. John A. Dicks and Gen. Burbank. At the expiration of three years, in August, 1865, he received an honorable discharge and returned to Portland. In the following month he came to Hartford, and entered Coltâs Armory as an employee, remaining until 1874, in which year he was elected to the office of city clerk and registrar of vital statistics for Hartford, which incumbency he filled continuously (with exception of the year 1880) until 1895, when a severe attack of rheumatism compelled him to confine himself to his room, which he never after left, for the three years preceding his death being a helpless invalid, unable to take a single step; although a terrible sufferer, he retained his sunny disposition to the end, which came Dec. 10, 1900. His career as city and town clerk and registrar was one of marked success, giving eminent satisfaction to all concerned. In fact, while a pronounced Democrat, his career as a public official was so characterized by devotion to the interests of the community at large, without regard to party lines, that he received the enthusiastic support of all, without regard to politics.\n\nSocially ÐÐ³. Higgins was a prominent member of Robert O. Tyler Post, G. A. R., and took an active part in the noted veteran assemblages and demonstrations that have taken place in Hartford since the war of the Rebellion. He was also a member of Green Cross Council, Knights of Columbus, and of the Hartford Lodge of Elks. For several years he was affiliated with the Sons of St. Patrick. As a musician he was a member of Coltâs Band, in which he played the euphonium and slide trombone; was president of the band several years, and at the time of his death was the oldest living member, having joined in 1868 and played until 1890. During this time, among the scores of parades in which this band took part, that of the National Convention of Hand Engine Companies, held in Philadelphia, was the largest. Coltâs Band in this parade waited for seven hours in their place before they had an opportunity to fall in line, allowing 210 bands to pass. Of the members of the band present on that occasion, only two are now living. For twenty-Ã±v'e years Mr. Higgins was a member and attendant of St. Peter's Catholic Church, at the time of his decease being connected with the Cathedral Parish.\n\nOn Aug. 16, 1873, Mr. Higgins was married to Adelia E. Collins, of Springfield, daughter of James D. and Julia Collins, the former of whom was employed during the Civil war as a barrel maker, having had a contract with the Sharpâs Gun Co., at Hartford, later with the Colt Co. He afterward went to England, and after eighteen months employment there with the firm of F. Firth & Sons returned to Hartford; he is now a resident of Springfield, Mass. Mrs. Higgins, who is his only child, is an excellent musician, and a fine performer on the pianoforte.\n\n... . . . .\n\n26 Oct 2005\n\nhttp://www.usgennet.org/usa/ct/county/fairfield/bridged5.htm\n\nDeaths in Bridgeport (CT)- From May 1890 to May 1891\n\nOf persons over eighteen years of Age\n\nName of Deceased-Date of Death- Age at death\n\nHiggins, Catherine, June 22 59 years\n\nHiggins, Timothy July 4 21 years\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n10 Oct 2005\n\nhttp://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~jdevlin/ct/westbrook_ct_cem3.htm\n\nHEADSTONE INSCRIPTIONS, TOWN OF WESTBROOK, MIDDLESEX CO., CT\n\nHIGGINS, Egbert E., b. 4 Nov 1837, d. 5 Mar 1901\n\nHIGGINS, Sarah L.

His prominency in all the civil affairs of the town, during so lengthy a period of time, entitles him to more than a passing notice in these pages. He was born in the town of Haddam, Conn., in that portion known as \"Turkey Hill,\" on the 8th day of September, 1782. His parents, Hawes and Lucinda (Bushnell) Higgins, were of good repute in the community in which they lived. He was, from early youth, deeply impressed with the advantages of a good education, and, although in his boyhood, he saw but few opportunities to gratify his desire for information, yet those few he zealously improved. About three months at school each year was spared to him from his labor-at farming, and at his father's trade of house and shipbuilding, until he arrived at the age of eighteen years, when he, for a brief time, attended school in Chester, under the instruction of the Rev. Mr. Mills. He lived in the town of his nativity until the age of twenty-two, when he went to the city of New York. This was about the year 1804, when that city numbered only 75,000 inhabitants. He remained there about two years engaged in ship building. At the expiration of that time he returned to Haddam, and in 1808 was made an Elector of the State of Connecticut in that town. He was married June 3d, 1809, to Ann Wright, daughter of William Wright, of Chatham, Conn., with whom he lived in the happiest relations until the time of her death, August 2d, 1852. They had five children, William W., Lucinda A., wife of Nathan Tyler, Catharine, Eliza M., wife of James M. Welch, and Mary S. Of these only one is now living 'Catharine' who still lives in the old homestead at East Haddam. Mr. Higgins removed with his wife to East Haddam, November 10th, 1810, and commenced housekeeping in the house where the late Richard S. Pratt resided at the time of his decease. He became, during his residence in his native town, a member of the State Militia, and finally, in 1810, was chosen Captain of the Haddam Town Company, which position, he held for the three succeeding years. When, during the war of 1812, the British troops made an attack upon and burnt our vessels at Essex, he, with nine others from this town volunteered, armed themselves, and took a row-boat for the scene of destruction, and, for a short time, took part in-the attack upon the invaders, but soon after their arrival darkness ensued and enabled the Englishmen to make their escape with two men killed�one of whom was a lieutenant in rank.\n\nIn 1813, he removed his family to \"Chapman's Landing,\" or \"the Ferry,\" by both of which names it was then called, now universally known as \"Goodspeed's Landing\" into the house then called the \"Dr. Percival House.\" It stood on the site of the house where Whitby M. Smith now lives. Here he pursued his trade of \"master ship builder\" for many years, having a large force of men in his employ. In the year 1815 he purchased the land on which he erected the house which was his place of residence up to the time of his death. It was an unpromising piece of ground, but persevering industry made it a comfortable and pleasant home for over sixty-three years.\n\nHe, at various times filled responsible positions of public trust. He was a Deputy Sheriff of Middlesex County from October 3d, 1818, to June 1st, 1823. By the General Assembly of the State, in whom was vested the appointing power at the time, he was made the Sheriff of the county in 1827, which office he occupied for three years. In the years 1826 and 1827 he was elected to the lower House of the General Assembly, and subsequently also represented East Haddam during three other sessions of that body. From 1838 to 1842 he was a Commissioner of the County Court, and in 1834, one of the Judges of that Court. He was Judge of Probate for the District of East Haddam during the years 1844 and 1845.\n\nNumerous minor offices of responsibility and public trust in the gift of his fellow townsmen did Judge Higgins fill during his useful existence, covering nearly a century. It is sufficient to say that he performed the duties connected with them all creditably to himself and to the entire satisfaction of the public. He was sought for important private trusts and discharged them with perfect fidelity. His advice upon business matters and on law questions was considered valuable and his judgment was universally approved.\n\nPolitically, he was with the Whig party, and was a member of the Republican party from its organization. He was always persistent and positive in the support of his political convictions, and never, except on very isolated occasions, when he was unavoidably prevented, did he omit to express his political faith at the ballot box in Electors' and Town Meeting. In fact his devotion to this duty of every citizen was very noteworthy. Being a radical anti-slavery man, he took great satisfaction in all proper measures looking to the emancipation of the slave, and was ever prepared to extend such assistance as lay in his power in the prosecution of that object. He was a man of courage�moral, intellectual and physical and uncompromising in his convictions of duty. He never waited to learn the opinions of others in order to modify the expression of his own and shape them to some private advantage, but spoke as he thought, with a high sense of right, which always guided his sensibilities.\n\nHe was a practical temperance man, in every respect, at no time indulging in any of the physical excesses which impair or destroy health. With an active, energetic temperament, he possessed remarkable powers of physical strength and endurance. His arrival at the ripe old age of ninety-six years, in the possession of his mental faculties, and with an extraordinary amount of physical vigor for that age, was evidence of a healthy constitution, wisely preserved. At the age of ninety-five he shot a mischievous squirrel upon the top of one of his pear trees, and one week previous to his death, which resulted from an attack of dysentery, he was cutting the grass in his orchard with the briskness of a much younger man.\n\nHis private character was without a stain. His integrity was unquestioned. To his excellence as a citizen he added a true Christian character, which he manifested in profession and practice. Although favoring the Second Adventist doctrine, he was free from the taint of sectarian bigotry, and cordially welcomed all manifestations of a Christian life.\n\nHis old Bible, so long and faithfully used, bears upon each page evidences of how diligently it was perused, and how well it- was loved, and with its teachings in his heart, he closed his earthly career with great hope and assurance of eternal life.\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n12 Sep 2005\n\nhttp://www.holycross.edu/departments/publicaffairs/hcm/spring01/in_memoriam/1951.html\n\nJames M.

He was born in County Waterford, town of Knockanure, Ireland, Sept. 26, 1851. His father, Michael Higgins, was born at the same place, and continued there as a farmer till he was nearing middle age. Then he came to America and in 1869 settled at Pawcatuck. After coming to this country he did not resume farming, but was engaged as a laborer. His wife, Margaret (Gray) bore him five children, as follows: Thomas (Higgins), who married and left one son, -Thomas (Higgins), now a druggist; William (Higgins), who is a stone polisher by lives in Pawcatuck; Michael (Higgins), of Pawcatuck; Mary (Higgins), deceased; and Julia (Higgins), deceased wife of John Deady, and the mother of five children. Michael and Margaret Higgins both died in Pawcatuck.\n\nMichael Higgins, son of Michael (Higgins), spent his boyhood days at Knockanure, and was educated in the National School. When he was fifteen he came to Pawcatuck, where his brother William (Higgins) and a sister his mother had already located, and began working in what is now known as the Solway Mills. He continued there till 1871, and then learned the trade tool sharpening with The Smith Granite Company and for four years followed that occupation. By thrift and constancy he was enabled, in 1875, with his savings, to establish himself in his present mercantile business in Pawcatuck, which, thanks to his native ability and business enterprise, has by closest application to business constantly expanded. Michael Higgins was joined in wedlock, Sept. 9, 1879 to Miss Mary A. Burke, also of Pawcatuck, and to this union ten children have been born, namely: Joseph (Higgins), a graduate of the high school and now attending Baltimore Medical College; Mabel (Higgins), a graduate of the high school and from Trinity College, Washington, D.C.; Margaret (Higgins), another high school graduate; William A. (Higgins), Leo (Higgins), Cyril (Higgins), Rosalie (Higgins) and Edwin (Higgins), all attending the parochial school; Walter (Higgins); and Michael (Higgins), who lived only eleven months.\n\nMr. Higgins has always maintained an independent stand in politics, and takes a keen interest in all questions of local import, as well as of broader scope. He is a member of St. Michael's Church, in Pawcatuck, and is universally looked up to and respected, as a most worthy citizen.\n\n---\n\n1880 Census Household:\n\nName Relation Marital Status Gender Race Age Birthplace Occupation Father's Birthplace Mother's Birthplace\n\nMichal HIGGINS Self M Male W 27 IRELAND Grocery IRELAND IRELAND\n\nMary HIGGINS Wife M Female W 18 CT Keeping House IRELAND IRELAND\n\nMichal HIGGINS Father W Male W 70 IRELAND Laborer IRELAND IRELAND\n\nSource Information:\n\nCensus Place Stonington, New London, Connecticut\n\nFamily History Library Film 1254108\n\nNA Film Number T9-0108 Page Number 463D\n\n. . . .\n\n1900 CT Census Scan Michael Higgins illegible\n\nView 1910 CT Census Scan Michael Higgins age 57\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 Jun 2005\n\nhttp://www.ct.gov/doc/cwp/view.asp?a=1499&q=265388\n\nEileen P Higgins\n\nWarden Higgins began her career in the Connecticut Department of Correction in April of 1980 as a Correctional Services Aide in the Bridgeport Community Services Office.

Higgins of Norwich, was born in Clinton, July 2, 1874. Soon after that date his parents moved to Norwich, which has since been his home. He comes from Puritan stock, his ancestor, Richard Higgins having landed at Plymouth soon after its settlement, and a little later holding the office of deputy and selectman for several terms in Plymouth Colony.\n\nMr. Higgins was educated in the schools of Norwich and graduated from Yale Law School in 1897. He opened an office for the practice of law in Norwich the summer of his graduation and the following autumn was elected as a republican to represent the town in the Legislature by a plurality of 374 votes. Although the youngest member of the House, he received an appointment upon the Judiciary Committee and subsequently acted as its clerk. His careful and judicious attention to his duties upon this committee and his efforts during the session to promote in every way the interests of the town which he represented, were such as to win for him the confidence of his constituents.\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n\nNew Haven , New Haven, Connecticut Marriages in the\n\nNew Haven Second Church 1733 - 1789\n\n1 February 2002\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/Heartland/5978/Conn3.html\n\nRev.

JULY, 1778âJUNE, 1792 Published 1907\n\nDAVID HIGGINS, a son of Captain Cornelius Higgins, of Eastham, Massachusetts, and Haddam, Connecticut, and his wife Sarah Hawes, was born in Haddam on August 6, 1761. At the age of eighteen his interest in religion was aroused, and in the Spring of 1780 he began to study under his pastor, the Rev. Eleazar May (Yale 1752), with the object of entering College and becoming a minister. In November, 1781, he was admitted to the Freshman Class in Dartmouth College, and in April, 1784, he transferred his relation to Yale. Soon after graduation he went to reside with the Rev. Dr. John Smalley (Yale 1756), of New Britain, Connecticut, to study theology under his tuition, and at the same time, as a means of support, he taught a district school. Here he continued until June, 1786, when he was licensed to preach by the Hartford South Association of Ministers; after which he spent several weeks in further study with the Rev. Dr. Joseph Lyman (Yale 1767), of Hatfield, Massachusetts. After preaching for short terms in several places, he was invited by the people of the North Parish in Lyme, (Hamburg Society) to preach to them with a view to settlement. He began his labors with them in April, 1787, and on the 17th of the ensuing October he was ordained and installed as their pastor. In 1794 he performed a missionary tour of four months' duration in the service of the Missionary Society of Connecticut, to the new settlements in New York State. In June, 1801, the pastoral relation between him and the people of Lyme was dissolved by mutual consent; and in September following he received an appointment from the Missionary Society to go on another four months' mission in New York State. He went as far west as the Genesee River, and subsequently preached for several months in three or four places, from each of which he had a call to settle. He finally accepted the call from Aurelius, in Cayuga County, and in July, 1802, brought thither his family from Connecticut, and settled them on the site of the present city of Auburn, which was then included in the military township of Aurelius. On October 6 he was installed pastor of the church by a council of Congregational and Presbyterian ministers. In 1808 the pastoral relation was dissolved, though he continued for a season to minister to the church. On December 7, 1812, he received a call from Bath, in Steuben County. In January, 1813, he removed his family to Bath, and on July I was installed there as pastor. Here he labored with varying success, and latterly amid considerable dissatisfaction; until in 1831, on June 21, just after a powerful revival, the pastoral relation was dissolved. The church at his dismission numbered one hundred and seventeen members. Mr. Higgins continued in the same vicinity for about four years longer, preaching regularly for most of the time. In May, 1835, he removed with his family to Norwalk, in Huron County, Northern Ohio. Being then nearly 74 years of age, he considered himself too far advanced in life .to take the charge of a church, but because of the want of ministers in the region, he continued to preach most of the time for some years longer. For the last two' years of his life, however, he preached only occasionally. On Sunday, June 19, 1842, he complained of not feeling well, but attended church in the forenoon; after dinner, while sitting in his study chair, he expired without a struggle, being in his 81st year.\n\nHe married on January 17, 1788, Eunice, daughter of Deacon James and Eunice (Nichols) Gilbert of New Haven. She died in Norwalk, on October 2, 1843, in her 82d year.\n\nHuron Reflector (Norwalk, Ohio) 1842 June 28 Bio in Newspaper after his death\n\nHuron Reflector (Norwalk, Ohio)\n\n1842 June 28 image 1\n\n1842 June 28 Image II\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nFitch's Home for Soldiers\n\nLast Name First Name Middle Initial Alias Branch of Service Regt Company File Number Date of Death Cemetery Residence State Higgins Patrick United States Navy 901 11/3/1900 New St. Josephs Waterbury CT Higgins Phillip CVHA 1 E 2517 2/11/1910 St. Bernards New Haven CT\n\nCVHA - Connecticut Volunteer Heavy Artillery\n\nRelated\n\nCT Union Forces in the Civil War\n\n1790 CT Census\n\nAlso See:\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nThis information compiled by Michael James Higgins Your Webmaster\n\nHome"
