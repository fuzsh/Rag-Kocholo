Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 819 (1996) (unanimous Supreme Court); State v. Sasso, 2016 ME 95, Â¶ 14, 143 A.3d 124, 129. The standard is an objective one and is used in courts across the state every day.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a stop if the officer had anything in mind other than the immediate reason for the stop. This prohibition is overbroad, unrealistic and dangerous, putting at risk the safety of innocent victims of crime whose circumstances are often uncovered through legitimate traffic stops.\n\nThis bill goes further than prohibiting a traffic stop when the officer is also looking for evidence of other crimes. It also prohibits a law enforcement officer in any traffic stop from asking questions or engaging in any conduct that is not related to the original purpose for the stop. This provision too is dangerous, unrealistic and unworkable.\n\nIn real life, it is not uncommon for traffic stops to result in the discovery of human trafficking, domestic violence, sexual assault, operating under the influence, robbery and other serious crimes, sometimes on the basis of observation and simple questions. The uncovering of crime is a continuum which does not stop at the approach to a vehicle.\n\nThe question, \"Is that blood on your shirt?,\" for instance, is a legitimate one, which may lead to evidence of murder, assault or other violent crime, whether or not the officer has an articulable suspicion of criminal activity at the time of the question. This bill, however, would not only prohibit the question but would make any evidence acquired after the question \"inadmissible in any criminal proceeding.\" To restrict what a police officer can do or say following a traffic stop thwarts legitimate, constitutional public safety practices and the rights of the general public.\n\nDeterring bias based stops, which appears to be the intent of the bill, is a laudable goal. Such stops are offensive, potentially illegal, and always against public policy. That is why Maine's law enforcement policies, Academy and field training all require an officer to base a stop on the conduct of the driver and not on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status, age, national origin or ancestry.\n\nWhile there may be more work to do in addressing such stops, this bill is an overcorrection that will cause more harm than good.\n\nFor these reasons I return L.D. 417 unsigned and vetoed and urge the Legislature to sustain this veto.\n\nSincerely,\n\nS/Janet T. Mills\n\nGovernor\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-2) The accompanying item An Act To Protect Maine's Drivers from Pretextual Traffic Stops\n\n(H.P. 301) (L.D. 417)\n\n(C. \"A\" H-623)\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-3) The Following Communication: (H.C. 184)\n\nand accompanying veto, item (2-4)\n\nSTATE OF MAINE\n\nOFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR\n\n1 STATE HOUSE STATION\n\nAUGUSTA, MAINE 04333-0001\n\nJune 23, 2021\n\nThe 130th Legislature of the State of Maine\n\nState House\n\nAugusta, Maine\n\nDear Honorable Members of the 130th Legislature:\n\nBy the authority vested in me by Article IV, Part Third, Section 2 of the Constitution of the State of Maine, I am hereby vetoing L.D. 418, An Act to Create a Graduate Real Estate Transfer Tax.\n\nL.D. 418 would increase the real estate transfer tax on certain property transactions. The problem with this bill is twofold. First, it is a tax increase. As Governor, I have remained steadfast in my commitment not to raise taxes on Maine people and businesses, especially at a time when the Maine economy is attempting to recover from the economic impact of the pandemic. Avoiding tax increases is important for positioning the State's economy to rebound quickly and strongly. Second, the bill is unnecessary to achieve its intended purpose. L.D. 418 is designed to provide additional dedicated revenue for the Housing Opportunities for Maine (HOME) Fund to support low-income and affordable housing. But the HOME Fund is financially sound and not in need of the relatively modest increase in revenue this bill would yield.\n\nA result of Maine's booming real estate market, in FY21 the Real Estate Transfer Tax is projected to generate $4.5 million more for the HOME Fund than in FY20. By comparison, L.D. 418 would be projected to raise only an additional $749,000 for the HOME Fund during its first full fiscal year in effect, less than 3% over currently forecasted revenues in the same year. It is more effective, and less detrimental to the broader economy, to support the HOME Fund and the important purposes it serves by managing the State budget responsibly as well as using new federal funds for housing needs, rather than raising taxes.\n\nFor these reasons, I return L.D. 418 unsigned and vetoed, and I urge the Legislature to sustain this veto.\n\nSincerely,\n\nS/Janet T. Mills\n\nGovernor\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-4) The accompanying item An Act To Create a Graduated Real Estate Transfer Tax\n\n(H.P. 302) (L.D. 418)\n\n(C. \"A\" H-373)\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-5) The Following Communication: (H.C. 185)\n\nand accompanying veto, item (2-6)\n\nSTATE OF MAINE\n\nOFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR\n\n1 STATE HOUSE STATION\n\nAUGUSTA, MAINE 04333-0001\n\nJune 23, 2021\n\nThe 130th Legislature of the State of Maine\n\nState House\n\nAugusta, Maine\n\nDear Honorable Members of the 130th Legislature:\n\nBy the authority conferred by Article IV, Part Third, Section 2 of the Constitution of the State of Maine, I am hereby vetoing L.D. 847, An Act To Divert Young Adults from the Adult Criminal Justice System.\n\nL.D. 847 would all but immunize \"young adults,\" ages 18 to 25, from the consequences of committing any Class E crime and it would require a law enforcement officer, the prosecutor and the court each to \"determine\" in any Class C felony or Class D or E charge against a young adult \"whether diversion, instead of a prosecution, is a more appropriate course of action.\"\n\nThe bill ignores the fact that neither a police officer, nor a prosecutor nor a judge can legally inquire of an accused about the facts of a case or about the individual's circumstances, for whatever purpose, without violating that individual's Fifth Amendment right.\n\nThe bill also assumes that all persons of that age group are amenable to social service intervention, that \"diversion\" is available and effective in all cases and in all areas of the state, and that social services are a more appropriate option, regardless of the nature of the crime, the wishes of the victim or the needs of the community or the threat to public safety.\n\nThe bill also disregards the necessary and important role police officers play in diffusing volatile situations before they escalate into violence, and is procedurally unworkable.\n\nWhen officers arrive on the scene of a disturbance, for instance, they often rely on the Class E crimes of Disorderly Conduct or Criminal Trespass to arrest and remove from the scene the person causing the problem, if necessary, thus preventing a situation from spiraling out of control. Under L.D. 847, an officer could only issue a warning to a person who claims to be under the age of 25. This bill would deprive citizens of the protection police afford in circumstances that are all too common and that can prevent further harm.\n\nFinally, the bill also states that an officer, prosecutor or judge has to determine before a criminal proceeding whether it should be dismissed in favor of \"diversion\". The bill defines \"diversion\" as simply providing information on certain community-based services. \"Diversion,\" therefore could consist merely of handing out a pamphlet and dismissing a case, which is not a meaningful response to criminal behavior.\n\nFor these reasons I am returning L.D. 847 unsigned and vetoed and urge the Legislature to sustain this veto.\n\nSincerely,\n\nS/Janet T. Mills\n\nGovernor\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-6) The accompanying item An Act To Divert Young Adults from the Adult Criminal Justice System\n\n(H.P. 615) (L.D. 847)\n\n(C. \"A\" H-551)\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-7) The Following Communication: (H.C. 186)\n\nand accompanying veto, item (2-8)\n\nSTATE OF MAINE\n\nOFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR\n\n1 STATE HOUSE STATION\n\nAUGUSTA, MAINE 04333-0001\n\nJune 23, 2021\n\nThe 130th Legislature of the State of Maine\n\nState House\n\nAugusta, Maine\n\nDear Honorable Members of the 130th Legislature:\n\nBy the authority conferred by Article IV, Part Third, Section 2 of the Constitution of the State of Maine, I am hereby vetoing L.D. 1253, An Act To Add a Faculty Member and Nonfaculty Staff Member to the Board of Trustees of the University of Maine System (UMS).\n\nLD 1253 is contrary to longstanding UMS Board of Trustees policy that guards against Trustees having real or perceived conflicts of interest in which they benefit financially or otherwise from Board action. This policy is consistent with Title 17, Section 3104, which serves as conflict of interest law for trustees of State offices and public institutions. Additionally, UMS Board of Trustees policy explicitly bans Trustees from being employed by the UMS during their service or for one full year following its conclusion. This prohibition goes beyond just preventing trustees of a public institution from voting on contracts in which they have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest; it prohibits them from serving at all. Furthermore, this policy automatically voids any contracts made while persons with such conflicts serve as trustees. Simply put, it is bad public policy to require active employees to serve on a board that makes decisions that set their salaries and otherwise directly impact them.\n\nAround the country, the vast majority of higher education governing boards do not include current faculty and staff because of the inherent conflict. During the public hearing for LD 1253, West Virginia was highlighted as an example of a state where active employees serve as voting members of the university system board. However, West Virginia University System employees are not part of an employee union, so the board does not participate in collective bargaining negotiations. In Florida, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, faculty and staff members serve as full voting members of the system board, but the Board of Governors of the State University System of Florida, the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees and the Penn State University Board of Trustees do not participate in collective bargaining negotiations. And in Oregon, where faculty and staff members serve on the Board of Trustees of the University of Oregon, the collective bargaining responsibilities belong to the University President, not the Board. Seven additional states have faculty and staff members on their university system boards as non-voting members. If this legislation were to become law, Maine would become the first state in the country with active employees serving as full voting members of a state university system board that serves as the bargaining agent for salary negotiations. This presents a clear conflict of interest that will undermine the trust and confidence of the public in this Board.\n\nIn Maine, no other large public employer is currently required - or allowed - to hold active employees on their Board, including the Maine Community College System, Maine Maritime Academy, or any K-12 school board.\n\nAt the same time, I firmly believe the UMS Board of Trustees would benefit from a more informed understanding of higher education and daily operations at the System's campuses, centers, and distance learning platforms. To this end, my administration strongly supports an enhanced role for non-voting faculty and staff members on the Board. I believe their perspective is critical to the work of the Board and I encourage the Board to review its policies for receiving and acting upon input from current faculty and staff to ensure a thorough and inclusive process.\n\nFor these reasons, I return LD 1253 unsigned and vetoed and I strongly urge the Legislature to sustain this veto.\n\nSincerely,\n\nS/Janet T. Mills\n\nGovernor\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-8) The accompanying item An Act To Add a Faculty Member and Nonfaculty Staff Member to the Board of Trustees of the University of Maine System\n\n(H.P. 919) (L.D. 1253)\n\n(C. \"A\" H-508)\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-9) The Following Communication: (H.C. 187)\n\nand accompanying veto, item (2-10)\n\nSTATE OF MAINE\n\nOFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR\n\n1 STATE HOUSE STATION\n\nAUGUSTA, MAINE 04333-0001\n\nJune 21, 2021\n\nThe 130th Legislature of the State of Maine\n\nState House\n\nAugusta, Maine\n\nDear Honorable Members of the 130th Legislature:\n\nBy the authority vested in me by Article IV, Part Third, Section 2 of the Constitution of the State of Maine, I am hereby vetoing L.D. 1668, Resolve, To Develop a Plan to Close the Long Creek Youth Development Center and Redirect Funding to Community Integration Services for Adjudicated Youth.\n\nL.D. 1668 is fundamentally flawed because it forces the closure of the State's only secure confinement option for juvenile offenders before safe and appropriate alternatives will be available. If this bill were to become law, Maine would become the only state in the nation without a secure facility to serve the needs of youth who require detention for some period because they represent a risk to themselves or others in the course of their rehabilitation. Responsible juvenile justice reform also takes into account the needs of public safety. I object to this legislation for its failure to do so.\n\nMy Administration has demonstrated deep commitment to bringing necessary change to Maine's juvenile justice system. The Department of Corrections (DOC) has engaged with the 32-member Maine Juvenile Justice System Assessment and Reinvestment Task Force, and collaborated with experts at the Center of Children's Law and Policy and the Juvenile Justice Research and Reform Lab at Drexel University, to identify, develop, and implement a suite of systemic reforms. These include shifting $6 million in DOC's juvenile budgetary resources to community based programs and services;opening two community-based residences, one for boys and one for girls, as transitional living options for youth returning home after a stay at the Long Creek Youth Development Center (Long Creek); and shifting funding for 14 vacant positions assigned to Long Creek to programs that promote restorative justice, deliver therapy and other wrap-around services, and establish youth advocacy and mentorship programs. DOC has also reworked training curricula and certification standards to provide new focus on adolescent brain development, adolescent trauma, mental health and substance abuse counseling, suicide prevention, and cultural competency, with particular attention to youth of color and LGBTQIA youth.\n\nThese initiatives have already shown real results. DOC's expansion of community-based programs and services statewide has undoubtedly prevented numerous at-risk youth from entering the system. And the judges of the Maine District Court, with DOC's active support, are using commitment to Long Creek only sparingly. There are currently only 31 youth detained in that facility, while hundreds of others on are on informal adjustment, probation, or otherwise under court-ordered supervision either before or after adjudication, for whom that supervision is made meaningful because of the existence of Long Creek. If Long Creek did not exist for those who failed to take the conditions of their release seriously, there would be little incentive to do so.\n\nL.D. 1668 represents a simplistic solution to a complex issue. A more thoughtful and balanced approach is set forth in L.D. 546, An Act To Implement the Recommendations of the Maine Juvenile Justice System Assessment and Reinvestment Task Force. L.D. 546, in contrast, takes a constructive approach to holding DOC accountable for the most effective use of the $6 million in resources the agency has reallocated to community-based programs, enhancing the effectiveness of proven child-serving support systems.\n\nFor these reasons, I return L.D. 1668 unsigned and vetoed, and I urge the Legislature to sustain this veto.\n\nSincerely,\n\nS/Janet T. Mills\n\nGovernor\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-10) The accompanying item Resolve, To Develop a Plan To Close the Long Creek Youth Development Center and Redirect Funding to Community Integration Services for Adjudicated Youth\n\n(H.P. 1239) (L.D. 1668)\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-11) The Following Communication: (H.C. 188)\n\nand accompanying veto, item (2-12)\n\nSTATE OF MAINE\n\nOFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR\n\n1 STATE HOUSE STATION\n\nAUGUSTA, MAINE 04333-0001\n\nJune 25, 2021\n\nThe 130th Legislature of the State of Maine\n\nState House\n\nAugusta, Maine\n\nDear Honorable Members of the 130th Legislature:\n\nUnder the authority vested in me by Article IV, Part Third, Section 2 of the Constitution of the State of Maine, I am hereby vetoing L.D. 920, An Act To Promote Oversight of and Competitive Parity among Video Service Providers.\n\nL.D. 920 attempts to implement new consumer fees on some streaming services, expands consumer costs to fund Public, Educational and Governmental (PEG) studios and adds a layer of regulation to these services funded by an assessment paid to the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). I am deeply concerned that if this bill were to become law, it could make digital streaming services more costly and reduce service options for Mainers.\n\nThis bill expands the obligation of the video service provider to fund technology upgrades and expansion of local television/PEG operators. This expansion is substantial and will result in higher fees passed down to consumers. This is both a local control issue and a consumer cost issue. Cable customers already contribute more than $10 million per year in franchise fees to local municipalities and many hundreds of thousands more in PEG capital fees. Only a small fraction is dedicated by municipalities to PEG operations. Additionally, L.D. 920 grants oversight of streaming websites to the PUC and requires the video service providers to offset those oversight and enforcement costs by paying a fee which I am concerned could be passed on to their subscribers.\n\nMy Administration worked in good faith with the sponsor to agree on legislation I feel would have accomplished the intent of the underlying bill. Our proposal offered the funding that local access channels need while ensuring municipalities had the authority to make that decision for their communities, instead of giving the PUC regulatory authority over streaming services.\n\nL.D. 920 would also make Maine an outlier by imposing franchise fee obligations related to the access of public right of ways over streaming websites, raising costs for consumers and negatively impacting the State's efforts to expand broadband across Maine.\n\nFor these reasons, I return LD 920 unsigned and vetoed and urge the Legislature to sustain this veto.\n\nSincerely,\n\nS/Janet T. Mills\n\nGovernor\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-12) The accompanying item An Act To Promote Oversight of and Competitive Parity among Video Service Providers\n\n(H.P. 676) (L.D. 920)\n\n(H. \"A\" H-635 to C. \"A\" H-528)\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-13) The Following Communication: (H.C. 189)\n\nand accompanying veto, item (2-14)\n\nSTATE OF MAINE\n\nOFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR\n\n1 STATE HOUSE STATION\n\nAUGUSTA, MAINE 04333-0001\n\nJune 25, 2021\n\nThe 130th Legislature of the State of Maine\n\nState House\n\nAugusta, Maine\n\nDear Honorable Members of the 130th Legislature:\n\nBy the Authority conferred by Article IV, Part Third, Section 2 of the Constitution of the State of Maine, I am hereby vetoing L.D. 1134, An Act to Amend the Bail Code Regarding Certain Conditions of Release.\n\nL.D. 1134 would remove consequences for the violation of certain conditions of release by a person who has been granted pre-conviction or post-conviction bail. By their nature, bail conditions are designed to ensure responsible behavior pending trial. These conditions constitute court orders. It is essential that law enforcement has the ability to arrest someone engaging in behavior in violation of their conditions of release even if that behavior would not otherwise constitute a violation of law. It is all too common, for example, for domestic violence to be tied to alcohol abuse. A defendant who is charged with related offenses that were committed while intoxicated may be released on the condition that they not possess alcohol. A law enforcement officer who observes that person drinking heavily in escalating circumstances must be able to make an arrest in the interest of public safety. Denying law enforcement that ability deprives the officer of a critical tool to intervene and prevent violence and further victimization.\n\nI agree with the sponsor that many of the 19 conditions of release serve little practical purpose and should be revisited; but leaving them in statute and unenforceable makes no sense. The Legislature should consider ways to ensure that the conditions of release that are imposed are not arbitrary, and explore ways to give greater guidance to bail commissioners to place conditions of release on a person that are related to the underlying offense. Not everyone who is granted pre-conviction release should have a condition to avoid alcohol placed upon them. But if alcohol fueled the original offense, it is reasonable and appropriate to demand a person take certain steps to help conform their behavior while they await disposition of their charge. This provision of law can be beneficial, should be used sparingly and ought to remain an option in the right cases.\n\nFor these reasons I return LD 1134 unsigned and vetoed and urge the Legislature to sustain this veto.\n\nSincerely,\n\nS/Janet T. Mills\n\nGovernor\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-14) The accompanying item An Act To Amend the Maine Bail Code Regarding Certain Conditions of Release\n\n(H.P. 812) (L.D. 1134)\n\n(C. \"A\" H-703)\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-15) The Following Communication: (H.C. 190)\n\nand accompanying veto, item (2-16)\n\nSTATE OF MAINE\n\nOFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR\n\n1 STATE HOUSE STATION\n\nAUGUSTA, MAINE 04333-0001\n\nJune 23, 2021\n\nThe 130th Legislature of the State of Maine\n\nState House\n\nAugusta, Maine\n\nDear Honorable Members of the 130th Legislature:\n\nBy the authority conferred by Article IV, Part Third, Section 2 of the Constitution of the State of Maine, I am hereby vetoing L.D. 710, An Act Regarding the Criminal Code.\n\nL.D. 710 was drafted originally by the Criminal Law Advisory Commission (CLAC), a commission comprised of defense attorneys, judges and prosecutors. CLAC is tasked by law to review the Criminal Code, make such recommendations as they deem advisable and to recommend legislation to the Legislature. CLAC members are the foremost experts in our state on the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure, and I take their recommendations seriously. However, the Committee amendment changes this CLAC bill in one significant respect that requires me to veto the bill.\n\nCurrent law imposes strict liability on a sexual act committed with a child under the age of fourteen, a reflection of the long-standing tenet of criminal law that children do not have the capacity to consent to sexual acts. This bill as enacted however, creates an exception from the strict liability crime if the actor and the victim are both younger than 14 years of age. In other words, the bill gives immunity from prosecution to an adolescent who commits an act of gross sexual assault with a child absent \"compulsion.\" Young children can be easily pressured and manipulated, emotionally and otherwise; but manipulation is not compulsion under the law.\n\nThis bill will make it legal for a 13-year-old to engage in a sexual act with a 4-year-old, undermining the ability of the court to intervene in that 13-year-old's life or to protect the 4-yearÂ­old. At the same time, a 14-year-old committing the same act commits a Class A offense and is subject to the intervention of the Juvenile Court.\n\nStrict liability law exists in statute now because it has long been the view that children of this age are unable to give consent to sexual acts. We cannot afford, as a society, to forfeit the protection of our youngest citizens and leave them at risk of sexual exploitation. This amendment was not what CLAC intended when it proposed this otherwise laudable bill to clarify certain provisions of the Criminal Code.\n\nFor these reasons, I return L.D. 710 unsigned and vetoed and urge the Legislature to sustain this veto.\n\nSincerely,\n\nS/Janet T.

Currently, the rate paid on pre-judgment interest is an amount equal to 3 percent plus the one-year U.S. Treasury bill rate (currently less than 0.09 percent) and the post-judgment rate is 6 percent plus the one-year U.S. Treasury bill rate.

These provisions will penalize a party who wants to take a case to court, rather than settle, would allow someone to receive effectively double payment and will likely combine to increase insurance premiums.\n\nThe first provision of the bill will increase - potentially dramatically - the interest a losing party will have to pay on an award if they choose to take a case to trial and lose. People have a right to their day in court and that may not always come quickly. And layering costs on to taking a case to trial against a party with insurance will only make insurance more expensive for everyone. While, it may make sense to revisit this interest rate, 10 percent across the board is too high.\n\nThe Legislature has enacted (in 2009) and repealed (in 2011) this exact provision in L.D. 1160 regarding subrogation of medical payments less for than $20,000. Generally, subrogation is a positive thing for not-at-fault insureds, as it assesses the costs of the loss to the responsible party or that person's insurer. For decades Maine allowed an insurer to recoup from a court award or settlement the cost of medical care payments the insurer made on behalf of their insured member. This makes sense and avoids a windfall to the insured. Insurance companies use subrogation to recoup costs they have incurred in compensating their insured which, in turn, keeps premiums lower for everyone else.\n\nAn example illustrates the point. Assume a policy holder with $20,000 in medical payment coverage is involved in an accident that is not their fault, and their insurer covers medical treatments costing $20,000. Under current law if the policy holder settles a case against the at-fault driver for $40,000, the insurance company that paid the medical bills would recoup the $20,000 they paid out, and the rest would be divided by the driver and their attorney. But if this bill were to become law, the entire $40,000 (plus interest) would be divided by the driver and their attorney, and the insurance company that paid medical bills that were not the fault of their insured member would be left to absorb that cost. Those costs will inevitably be passed onto every other policy holder.\n\nFor these reasons I return LD 1160 unsigned and vetoed and urge the Legislature to sustain this veto.\n\nSincerely,\n\nS/Janet T. Mills\n\nGovernor\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-18) The accompanying item An Act To Reduce the Burden on Courts and Promote the Resolution of Civil Cases\n\n(H.P. 838) (L.D. 1160)\n\n(C. \"A\" H-590)\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-19) The Following Communication: (H.C. 192)\n\nSTATE OF MAINE\n\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\nSPEAKER'S OFFICE\n\nAUGUSTA, MAINE 04333-0002\n\nJune 30, 2021\n\nHonorable Robert B.

I also sponsored a public education outreach campaign to combat human trafficking, and I worked with other Attorneys General to pressure entities like Craigslist, Google, and Backpage.com to end human trafficking on their sites. I joined a multi-state coalition urging Congress to affirm law-enforcement authority to fight sex trafficking.\n\nAs Governor, I signed onto the U.S. Department of Transportation's \"Transportation Leaders Against Human Trafficking\" initiative that calls on the transportation industry to educate members on how to recognize and report signs of human trafficking and to raise awareness among the traveling public about human trafficking.\n\nAdditionally, my Administration has taken steps to address some of the underlying issues that affect human trafficking, including expanding Medicaid to provide health care services to more people, including victims of crime, and expanding access to treatment options generally for those who are struggling with addiction. The state budget includes additional funds for sexual assault services, and other bills enhance remedies and services for survivors of sex crimes and domestic violence.\n\nThe sponsor of L.D. 1592 has worked hard to address the problem of human trafficking, and I agree that we as a State and as a nation should continue to reduce human trafficking and protect survivors of human trafficking. However, I am not convinced that the approach of this bill is the best path forward.\n\nL.D. 1592 proposes to eliminate penalties for a person engaging in prostitution, increase penalties for a person who engages with a prostitute, and set forth a process for a person who was previously convicted of engaging in prostitution to have their criminal record sealed. Currently engaging in prostitution is a Class E crime, but is punishable only with a fine, while engaging with a prostitute is Class E crime, absent other aggravating factors, and is punishable with jail time. L.D. 1592 would eliminate all penalties for engaging in prostitution and would make engaging a prostitute a Class D crime. (The bill would also increase the penalty for solicitation of a minor to engage in prostitution from a Class D to a Class C crime).\n\nThe testimony on this bill from survivors of human trafficking was divided. While some hope this bill will protect the survivors of human trafficking, a goal I share, others fear that sex traffickers will use decriminalization of prostitution as a way to entice more people into their trade; telling their victims that what they are doing is not a problem - a concern that I believe is also legitimate. The concern for the prevalence of human trafficking in Maine has rightly grown in recent years, in part as the Legislature has focused on this problem and police and prosecutors better recognize when a person is being compelled to engage in prostitution. This has allowed us to rightly begin viewing and treating the person as a survivor and provide that person with appropriate services - an approach that I believe is appropriate.\n\nAnother bill, L.D. 1455, which recently became law, and which conflicts with this bill, expands the affirmative defense of engaging in prostitution if the person did so to \"prevent bodily injury, serious economic hardship or another threat to the person or another person.\" In my view, the approach taken under L.D. 1455 is a more measured approach for promoting both public safety and compassion for survivors of sex trafficking.\n\nNo state in the nation has fully legalized commercial sex work. Even in Nevada, known as the only state to have legal commercial sex work, prostitution is still illegal outside regulated designated facilities in a single county. By contrast, this bill would make Maine the first state in the nation to eliminate all penalties for engaging in sex for money.\n\nWhile engaging in prostitution is not now a jailable offense in our state, and while courts and prosecutors strive to treat prostitution as a social services issue rather than a criminal problem, fully decriminalizing prostitution, I fear, will only increase demand and encourage the exploitation of young people by those who profit from the mistreatment of others, undermining the free will of those trapped in difficult and sometimes tragic circumstances.\n\nFor these reasons I return L.D. 1592 unsigned and vetoed and urge the Legislature to sustain this veto.\n\nSincerely,\n\nS/Janet T. Mills\n\nGovernor\n\n_________________________________\n\n(2-2) The accompanying item An Act To Remove Punishments for Sex Selling and Decrease Demand by Increasing Penalties for Sex Buying\n\n(H.P. 1181) (L.D. 1592)\n\n(C. \"A\" H-624)\n\n_________________________________\n\nState of Maine\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\n130th Legislature\n\nFirst Special Session\n\nHOUSE ADVANCE JOURNAL AND CALENDAR\n\nhttp://legislature.maine.gov/HouseCalendar\n\nWednesday, June 30, 2021\n\nHouse Supplement No. 4\n\nREPORTS OF COMMITTEE\n\nDivided Report\n\n(6-1) Majority Report of the Committee on APPROPRIATIONS AND FINANCIAL AFFAIRS reporting Ought to Pass as Amended by Committee Amendment \"A\" (H-737) on Bill \"An Act To Authorize General Fund Bond Issues To Improve Transportation and National Guard Infrastructure and To Promote the Conservation of Land, Working Waterfronts, Water Access and Outdoor Recreation\"\n\n(H.P. 1265) (L.D. 1702)\n\nSigned:\n\nSenators:\n\nBREEN of Cumberland\n\nBAILEY of York\n\nDAVIS of Piscataquis\n\nRepresentatives:\n\nPIERCE of Falmouth\n\nARATA of New Gloucester\n\nCARDONE of Bangor\n\nCLOUTIER of Lewiston\n\nCOREY of Windham\n\nFAY of Raymond\n\nHYMANSON of York\n\nMARTIN of Eagle Lake\n\nMILLETT of Waterford\n\nMinority Report of the same Committee reporting Ought Not to Pass on same Bill.\n\nSigned:\n\nRepresentative:\n\nFECTEAU of Augusta\n\n_________________________________\n\nState of Maine\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\n130th Legislature\n\nFirst Special Session\n\nHOUSE ADVANCE JOURNAL AND CALENDAR\n\nhttp://legislature.maine.gov/HouseCalendar\n\nWednesday, June 30, 2021\n\nHouse Supplement No. 5\n\nSENATE PAPERS\n\n(1-1) The following Joint Resolution: (S.P. 586)\n\nJOINT RESOLUTION EXPRESSING THE HOPE FOR A SWIFT CONCLUSION TO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE MAINE SERVICE EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION\n\nWHEREAS,the State, in conjunction with the Maine Service Employees Association, engaged The Segal Group, Inc. to conduct a comprehensive market assessment of the Stateâs executive branch jobs; and\n\nWHEREAS, the study covered market data reflective of 10 public sector employers as well as New England private sector market data, including base pay ranges and compensation practices;and\n\nWHEREAS, the study found that the Stateâs base pay is consistently below the marketaverage at the pay range minimum, midpoint and maximum, with the gap ranging from 13 percent to 17 percent of the overall market average; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Maine Service Employees Association, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union, represents more than 12,000 Maine workers;and\n\nWHEREAS, the contract renewal process for these workers is currently underway, and there is an opportunity for the pay gap to be addressed; now, therefore, be it\n\nRESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirtieth Legislature now assembled in the First Special Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this opportunity to express our hope for a swift conclusion to the negotiations with Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union and our hope that progress is made on closing the pay gap highlighted in the recent study.\n\nComes from the Senate, READ and ADOPTED.\n\n_________________________________\n\nState of Maine\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\n130th Legislature\n\nFirst Special Session\n\nHOUSE ADVANCE JOURNAL AND CALENDAR\n\nhttp://legislature.maine.gov/HouseCalendar\n\nWednesday, June 30, 2021\n\nHouse Supplement No. 6\n\nSENATE PAPERS\n\n(1-1) The following Joint Order: (S.P. 587)\n\nORDERED, the House concurring, that Bill, âAn Act To Provide Equal Access to the Benefits of the Maine Food Sovereignty Act,â S.P. 306, L.D. 954, and all its accompanying papers, be recalled from the Governorâs desk to the Senate.\n\nComes from the Senate, READ and PASSED.\n\n_________________________________\n\nState of Maine\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\n130th Legislature\n\nFirst Special Session\n\nHOUSE ADVANCE JOURNAL AND CALENDAR\n\nhttp://legislature.maine.gov/HouseCalendar\n\nWednesday, June 30, 2021\n\nHouse Supplement No. 7\n\nORDERS OF THE DAY\n\nHOUSE CALENDAR\n\nWEDNESDAY, JUNE 30, 2021\n\nBILLS RECALLED FROM GOVERNOR\n\n(Pursuant to Joint Order - House Paper 1297)\n\n1.
