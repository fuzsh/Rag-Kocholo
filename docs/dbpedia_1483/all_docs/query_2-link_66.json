He died June 2d, 1843, leaving a few thousand dollars worth of property for Foreign Missions, under the care of the American Board.

He was City Cleark from 1786 to 1789 inclusive, resigned this office and probably soon after moved away, to what place is not known.\n\nMatthew Talcott RUSSELL, was named after Col. Matthew TALCOTT, who had married his aunt and had not children of his own. He was educated at his expense at Yale College, where he was tutor for four years. He sutdied law with the Hon. Oliver ELLSWORTH, and commenced practice in this city. Though of a slender constitution and delicate health, he was able through great care and prudence to attend continually to his professional concerns. He was accurate and methodical in every thing, and therefore well fitted to transact the large amount of collecting business which was entrusted to his hands. For some time he was State's attorney. The communtiy respected him for his integrity and faitfulnees and the church honored him for his consistent christian conduct. He died 13 Nov 1828, aged nearly 68 years.\n\nWilliam BROWN, native of Guilford, graduate of Yale 1784, practised law some years here, was City Clerk after Mr. WOODRUFF, three years. He afterwards practised in Madison a few years, and then in the city of Hartford, where he died in the close of 1803. He was a man of good abilities and much respected.\n\nJoshua HENSHAW, native of Middletown, and graduate of Yale, 1785. He moved to Vermont, and thence, it is understood, to Montreal, in Canada.\n\nEnoch HUNTINGTON, son of Rev. Enoch HUNTINGTON, graduate of Yale, 1785, had superior natural talents, was a Dean scholar, spoke with great fluency at the bar, and was Colonel of militia. He died March 7th, 1826, aged 58.\n\nSilas STOW, was a native of the Society of Middlefield.\n\nGeorge W.

Charles CHAUNCEY of New Haven, and was admitted to the bar in November, 1804. From the close of 1804 until 1819, Chauncey WITTLESEY, Esq., practised in this county and though able lawyers from Middlesex & adjoining counties, attended the courts, he acquired an elevated rank among his brethren. He was also advanced in military life to the command of a brigade. In the last mentioned year he removed to Louisville, Kentucky, where he practised about four years, and afterwards to New Orleans, where he practised about four years more. His health having been seriously injured while in the latter city, he returned to his native town in 1827, and attended in a degree to official business until the autumn of 1829, when his illness became distressing. His sight and other bodily powers were affected, so that for the residue of his life he was almost helpless and often racked with severe pain. He died 24 Dec 1834, aged 51. Gen. WHITTLESEY's earthly disappointments and suffering served to render the grace of God, in which he trusted, the more conspicuous. Those who visited him in his afllictions were surprised in view of his weak and disordered body, and at the continued vigor of his mind; were instructed by his conversation and improved by his resignation to God and his benevolence to men, and prospects of blessedness in the life to come. An able writer in the Philadelphian for 8 Jan 1835, declares concerning him: \"When almost every early comfort was withdrawn, he was not cast down, for he looked to his inheritance among the saints in light. When blindness and darkness came over his bodily snese, the eye of his mind remained strong and unclouded, and the light of Heaven still penetrated to his soul and kept up a constant warmth in his heart. While he was in a condition which would have made some men forget all but self and suffering, his expansive benevolence, worthy of its celestial origin, constantly flowed out to his fellow beings. His intellect was still firm and figorous after years of severe disease had taken from his body almost all power but that of endurance, and his feelings, instead of being souered by disappointment and calamity,\n\nJohn L.

In both towns he had considerable paractice.
