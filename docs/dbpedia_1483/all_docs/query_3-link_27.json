It's not an easy road\n\n- Tina\n\nMy utmost deepest sympathy -condolences to all missing U & ur fam!\n\n- Tina\n\nGilbert I'm SOO shocked how fast U went... I know U were tired of the body that couldn't keep up with U. Sadly I wish I could of gotten the news earlier.. but Thank God I got ur last visit in hospital & how badly You tried to talk to me yet couldn't bring words out. Even to see ur last smile here when Your body was shutting down.. you will be missed by many I have talked to. Ur bro in town was devastated but I'm checking on him.. it's been impossible to grieve U til now.. and mannn the countless days, hours I spent w U & the tons of jokes & laughter and some tears.. U were there for me when my dad passed on. How U always managed to make the day better after visiting U.. but towards the end it was hard for to be able to do what needed to be done.. I know U loved me as a sister, As U said many times.. RIP & U are finally out of ur earthly body. As I said in our last visit. U gotta fight til God says it's your time.. and U understood me still. Since U couldn't speak I asked U to squeeze my hand if U understand me?? And U did w the strength U had left.. I will cherish the smile on my last visit cuz we both knew how to be there for each other but U couldn't help me anymore when ur health went down. My nieces U loved sooo much are devastated to hear U are not with us anymore.. but they always loved U cuz U spoiled them w gifts/teddy bears/treats every time U knew I would see my precious nieces.. U did put an amazing imprint on a lot of ppl. Love U & Miss U bro. I wish I could have done more unfortunately I wasn't giving notice when U were sent to hospital but U were in the right place at the time.. forever in my heart & soul..! Til we meet again I'm gonna be thinking of U & the many great times we had together as friends/fam! I wasn't prepared to get the news in the end of U leaving us. I told U all in Gods timing..\n\n- Tina"
