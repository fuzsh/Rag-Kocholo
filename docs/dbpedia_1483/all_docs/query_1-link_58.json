        "text": "NOTE: This information is correct as of 4:00 p.m. EST, Friday, Nov. 18, 2016.\n\nGreenberg Traurig is pleased to provide this overview of the 2016 National & Texas General Election results. Below is a snapshot of the most closely-watched contests plus a summary of outcomes for the Texas Congressional delegation, Texas Statewide offices, and Texas House and Senate for the 85th Legislature, which will convene on Jan. 10, 2017.\n\nPresident\n\nDonald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States after 290 electoral votes (as of this writing). Hillary Clinton narrowly won the popular vote with 62.1 million votes compared to 61 million for Trump.\n\nIn Texas, Trump received 52.41 percent of the vote compared to 43.29 percent for Clinton, which was the lowest margin of victory for the GOP nominee in Texas in twenty years.\n\nDemographically, Clinton performed worse among minority groups and younger voters than Obama did in 2012.\n\nThis table summarizes the key demographic trends of the election:\n\n% of voters\n\nClinton\n\nTrump\n\nObama\n\nRomney\n\nMen\n\n48%\n\n41%\n\n53%\n\n46%\n\n54%\n\nWomen\n\n52%\n\n54%\n\n42%\n\n56%\n\n44%\n\nAfrican-American\n\n12%\n\n88%\n\n8%\n\n93%\n\n7%\n\nLatino\n\n11%\n\n65%\n\n29%\n\n71%\n\n27%\n\nCaucasian\n\n70%\n\n37%\n\n58%\n\n39%\n\n59%\n\nAsian\n\n4%\n\n65%\n\n29%\n\n72%\n\n26%\n\nAges 18-29\n\n19%\n\n54%\n\n37%\n\n60%\n\n37%\n\nUnited States Senate\n\nBefore the election, the Senate was composed of 54 Republicans, 44 Democrats, and 2 Independents. There were 34 seats up for election, with Republicans defending 24 and Democrats 10. Despite numerous forecasts that the Democrats would gain enough seats to take power in the Senate, those predictions proved to be flawed, as Republicans retained control by securing 51 seats to 48 for the Democrats, with 1 race still undecided.\n\nWith regard to the Texas Delegation, neither Senior U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R) nor Junior U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R) were on the ballot. Sen. Cruz’s seat will be up next in 2018 and Sen. Cornyn’s seat will be up in 2020.\n\nUnited States House of Representatives\n\nPrior to this election, there were 246 Republicans to 186 Democrats in the U.S. House, with 3 vacant seats. As expected, Republicans retained control of the U.S. House with 239 confirmed seats to 193 confirmed for the Democrats, with 3 races still undecided.\n\nThe Texas Delegation for the 115th U.S. Congress will consist of 25 Republican members and 11 Democratic members. Each Congressional incumbent who sought reelection retained their seats, and the Texas delegation will have one new member, Jodey Arrington (R), who won the TX-19 seat formerly held by Randy Neugebauer (R).\n\nU.S. House District 23 was considered the only competitive Congressional race in Texas, where Republican incumbent Will Hurd defeated Democrat Pete Gallego 48.4 percent to 46.8 percent.\n\nTexas Statewide Offices1\n\nAll statewide elected offices in Texas will continue to be held by Republicans, as three Texas Supreme Court seats and one spot on the Texas Railroad Commission were won by the GOP candidates. All other statewide offices were not on the ballot in this cycle.\n\nTexas Supreme Court\n\nPlace 3 – (R) Debra Lehrmann* def. (D) Mike Westergren 55 percent to 39 percent\n\nPlace 5 – (R) Paul Green* def. (D) Dori Contreras Garza 54 percent to 41 percent\n\nPlace 9 – (R) Eva Guzman* def. (D) Savannah Robinson 56 percent to 39 percent\n\nCourt of Criminal Appeals\n\nPlace 2 – (R) Mary Lou Keel def. (D) Larry Meyers* 55 percent to 40 percent\n\nPlace 5 – (R) Scott Walker def. (D) Betsy Johnson 55 percent to 40 percent\n\nPlace 6 – (R) Michael E. Keasler* def. (D) Robert Burns 55 percent to 40 percent\n\nTexas Railroad Commission\n\nRepublican Wayne Christian (former Texas House member) was elected to fill an open position on the Texas Railroad Commission.\n\nTexas Senate\n\nFor the 85th Legislature, there will be 20 Republicans and 11 Democrats in the Senate, thus keeping the partisan makeup of the upper chamber the same as it was last session.\n\nThere is only one swing seat in the Senate, SD 10, held by Sen. Konnie Burton, who is not up for reelection until 2018. There was one race expected to be competitive in this election:\n\nSD 24 – (R) Dawn Buckingham def. (D) Virginia “Jennie Lou” Leeder, 73 percent to 27 percent.\n\nTexas House of Representatives\n\nAll 150 members of the Texas House are up for re-election every two-year cycle. There will be 95 Republicans and 55 Democrats in the TX House for the 85th Legislature.\n\nPrior to this election, there were 99 Republicans, 50 Democrats, and 1 Independent.\n\nThere were 23 nonreturning members this year: Aycock, Crownover, Farias, Farney, Fletcher, Harless, Hughes, Keffer, S. King, McClendon, Marquez, Martinez-Fisher, Miles, D. Miller, Naishtat, Otto, Riddle, Simpson, W. Smith, Spitzer, Scott Turner, Sylvester Turner, and M. White. Among those members, 9 were sitting House Committee Chairs.\n\nThe following House seats had competitive races with both R and D challengers:\n\nHD 23 – (R) Wayne Faircloth* def. (D) Lloyd Criss, 59 percent to 41 percent.\n\nHD 43 – (R) J.M. Lozano* def. (D) Marisa Yvette Garcia-Utley 61 percent to 39 percent.\n\nHD 47 – (R) Paul Workman* def (D) Ana Jordan 54 percent to 42 percent.\n\nHD 54 – (R) Scott Cosper def. (D) Sandra Blankenship, 55 percent to 45 percent.\n\nHD 102 – (R) Linda Koop* def. (D) Laura Irvin, 55 percent to 45 percent.\n\nHD 105 – (R) Rodney Anderson* def. (D) Terry Meza, 50 percent to 49 percent.\n\nHD 107 – (D) Victoria Neave def. (R) Kenneth Sheets*, 51 percent to 49 percent.\n\nHD 113 – (R) Cindy Burkett* def. (D) Rhetta Andrews Bowers, 55 percent to 45 percent.\n\nHD 114 – (R) Jason Villalba* def. (D) Jim Burke, 56 percent to 40 percent.\n\nHD 115 – (R) Matt Rinaldi* def. (D) Dorotha Ocker, 51 percent to 49 percent.\n\nHD 117 – (D) Philip Cortez def. (R) Rick Galindo*, 51 percent to 49 percent.\n\nHD 118 – (D) Tomas Uresti def. (R) John Lujan*, 55 percent to 45 percent.\n\nHD 134 – (R) Sarah Davis* def. (D) Ben Rose, 54 percent to 43 percent.\n\nHD 135 – (R) Gary Elkins* def. (D) Jesse A. Ybanez 55 percent to 45 percent.\n\nHD 136 – (R) Tony Dale* def. (D) Paul R. Gordon, 55 percent to 45 percent.\n\nHD 144 – (D) Mary Ann Perez def. (R) Gilbert Pena*, 60 percent to 40 percent.\n\nLocal Propositions\n\nCity of Arlington - Prop 1 – Arlington voters approved a $500 million bond issuance to pay for half the cost of a new stadium for the Texas Rangers baseball club.\n\nCity of Austin – Prop 1 –Austin voters approved a $720 million bond issuance for transportation improvement and mobility projects in various high-traffic corridors.\n\nCity of Houston – Proposition 1 – Houstonians voted NOT to authorize the Houston Independent School District (HISD) to send recapture payments to the State as a part of the school finance system.As a result, the Texas Education Agency will detach certain commercial property from HISD and attach it to a different school district.This process has never occurred before, and some voters hoped a No vote would spur change to the current public school funding model.\n\n*Special thanks to Aaron Cole Gregg¥ for his valuable contribution to this Alert.\n\n¥Not admitted to the practice of law."
