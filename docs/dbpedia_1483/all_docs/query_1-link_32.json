        "text": "Before I left Philadelphia you will recollect that I engaged to give some Information respecting the Issue of the late Election in Connecticut, and the State of the public mind in New England. The period has now arrived when I can speak with more confidence and with more accuracy, than I had even expected. Our Legislature closed itâs Session last friday. when our Votes for Candidates for Congress were counted, it appeared that of five new Candidates, necessary to fill the listâThree of the Republican TicketâHart, Mather and Granger were electedâUpon the meeting of the Legislature which is composed of about One hundred & Ninety RepresentativesâThe Republicans could count upon 63 in their Interestâwhile The Other party had not more than 40 who were known to be with them strongly, Althoâ the rest went with the Current of N England politicsâ(their real opinions unknown) before this Time The Charge of Democracy as they Term it was Sufficient to displace any Judge, or Other Officer of GovermentâThe party still confiding in their Strength made, at the Meeting of the Repl. for Hartford County, an Attack upon Judge Bull, and succeeded to displace him from his Offices. his defence in the Legislature devolved upon me solely. Their Attack was very violent, Illiberal and uncandidâBut when the vote was called to their Utter Astonishment Two Thirds of the House were in favor of Mr: Bull. Their Disappointment exceeded discription. The Charm was broken. Many, very many of the Members, who were unknownâavowed themselves in favor of the Old principles of â76âWe had sevâral Other little Trials of Strengthâin evry case we succeededâIn evry instance we gained Strength: and I think I may say with truth that for Ten days before our Session closed we had a clear and decided majority. I am not without Great hopes that Connecticut will afford strong aid towards effecting a change in the Administration and I feel the most perfect confidence, that if she should not and a change should take place, she will be one of the Strongest in Support of the New-Administration. This gives me great pleasure when I reflect, that I had to Support myself, allmost without even accidentalâAid, against a violent Tempest for Three yearsâMr: Edwards has avowed himself openlyâhe will be a Candidate for Senator in the room of Tracey, and about the first of September will resign his offices & take a Seat in Our Legislature at the fall Sessionâevry possible exertion is making, (tho evry thing is perfectly Still) to effect a change in the Senate & House of Repes. of the UStatesâand also in Our Own State Legislature, and also to carry Republican ElectorsâThe whole arangement rests upon Three of Us. we all think the Chances equal at least and yet during all these Things I cannot learn that they apprehend any Such planâfrom the habits of Our People & their mode of Electioneering evry Thing is lost, unless the most perfect Secrecy is observedâI am told Govenor Fenner has taken open ground with us. this leads me to believe that there are many chances for Success in Rhode IslandâIn Short as it respects New England generally, a mighty revolution in Opinion has taken place within One YearâThe people are awakening to a True Sense of their Interestâthey perceive that the late System of Measures will in a few years rob them of their Liberty and property, and they are fast rallying round the Standard of RepublicanismâThey cannot much longer be deceived by the Cry that we mean to destroy the Constitution & Govermt of Our Common CountryâThey mustâThey will know that all Such representations are false. Many of the proprietors here feel very uneasy at a report that Tracey is next fall to be Governor of the NorthWest TerritoryâThere are many Republicans Who are removing into that Country that abhor his System of Terrorâ\n\nyou will recollect, Sir, that I had the pleasure of Introducing to Your Acquaintance at Philadelphia my Brother in Law Calvin Pease Esq. who has removed onto the Connecticut Reserveâhe is a Candidate for the Offices of Clerk of the CountyâClerk of the quarter Sessions & Clerk of the Orphans Court in a new County to be formd of the Reserve, which offices are generally bestowed on the Same personâhe has some Letters of Recommendation, is a man of very fair Character of good Abilities and decent Information, A Letter of Recommendation to Govr: St Clair, if consistent with your feelings & Sense of propriety will lay me under great ObligationsâI have Sent this Letter inclosed in One to Mr. Beckley to whom I have communicated only very generallyâ An Answer would give me great pleasureâSincerely devoted to the Liberty, the prosperity & happiness of my fellow Citizens I Am Sir With Great Esteem & Respect your friend"
