In this moment, there is no distinction between Democrat, Republican, or Independent. There is only us and You.\n\nSo together we ask for sharp ears to hear the voices of those we serve, not just the ones who got us elected. Open our lips to speak for those who have no voice. Give us clear eyes to see the solutions hiding behind our current problems. Guide our feet toward common ground, and strengthen our hands for the work of reaching it. Embolden our hearts to choose what is right over what is popular, what is good over what is easy, and what is true over what is expedient.\n\nWe place our whole selves in Your care—heart and mind, body and spirit—that as we start our work, we might remember who we serve. We ask this in Your mighty name, and I ask it in the powerful name of Jesus.

Kevin has worked in my office since 2006, after assisting with my re-election campaign. He has been an outstanding district representative, as well as working diligently with the many constituents within my district. He attended many legislative committee meetings for me.\n\nThe high quality of effort maintained by Kevin has been noted by me and by many people in my district and will not be forgotten. His caring personality and impeccable work ethic will be missed throughout the Senate. Kevin has recently taken a position in the House with Representative Richard LeBlanc’s office as a legislative assistant. Representative LeBlanc is very lucky to have him.\n\nOn behalf of myself, my staff, and the rest of the Michigan Senate, I would like to thank Kevin for all his hard work and dedication, and I wish him the utmost success in all of his future endeavors. I would ask my colleagues to also congratulate him and thank him for the work he has provided to this body.\n\nThe following communication was received and read:\n\nOffice of the Senate Majority Leader\n\nMarch 9, 2010\n\nPursuant to Senate Rule 2.104(c), I am requesting that the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Bioeconomy hold a hearing on the appointments of Jennifer Fike and Audrey Herioux to the Commission of Agriculture, and make written recommendations to the Government Operations Committee on these appointments.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSenator Michael D.

They make relatively small changes, and the main objective of the bill is preserved. With this concurrence, Senate Bill No. 528 and the House companion bill will address a vital issue, especially in Kent County, and bring some peace of mind to thousands of my constituents and residents.\n\nAs many of you know, there was a doctor a few years ago who deliberately reused medical devices in complete disregard for his patients’ safety. This has been deeply distressing to those patients and other residents. That doctor was convicted for billing fraud, but Michigan law still contains a grey area on the misuse of medical devices. This bill will clear that up.\n\nNo one should have to go through the experience that these patients had. They would all want us to prevent this from happening again. With Senate Bill No. 528, we will, hopefully, take that step. On behalf of those patients and many others, I’m glad we can respond to those concerns in legislation, and thank you for your support.\n\nSenate Bill No. 251, entitled\n\nA bill to make, supplement, and adjust appropriations for certain capital outlay projects for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010;

and\n\nWhereas, One of those students was 15-year-old Kimberly Anne Gillary, whose life was tragically lost as a result of a sudden cardiac arrest in a high school water polo game on April 1, 2000; and\n\nWhereas, The Gillary family founded the Kimberly Anne Gillary Foundation in April 2000 in Kimberly’s memory to donate automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to Michigan high schools and to advocate cardiac screening and testing of all Michigan high school student athletes; and\n\nWhereas, As of March 1, 2010, the Kimberly Anne Gillary Foundation has raised more than $1 million and has donated more than 500 AEDs to Michigan high schools; and\n\nWhereas, There have been at least two lives saved using AEDs donated by the Kimberly Anne Gillary Foundation. On October 24, 2007, the life of 17-year-old Ashley Palmer was saved at Davison High School due to the quick thinking and training of Davison High School staff members. On April 22, 2009, 67-year-old Larry Ratkowski, while a spectator at a Hamilton High School baseball game, was saved due to the quick thinking and training of the principal, the athletic trainer, one of the students, and a deputy sheriff; and\n\nWhereas, In large part, as a result of the efforts of the Kimberly Anne Gillary Foundation, approximately 75 percent of the high schools in Michigan now have at least one AED, and staff members are trained in CPR and the use of an AED. There is an increased awareness of the importance of more effective pre-participation cardiac screening of our high school student athletes and having AEDs readily accessible in our Michigan high schools; now, therefore, be it\n\nResolved by the Senate, That April 2010 be hereby designated as Michigan Student Athlete Cardiac Awareness Month; and be it further\n\nResolved, That the people of the state of Michigan are encouraged to become more aware of the importance of improved pre-participation screening of our student athletes and the preparedness of our citizenry and public employees to respond to the sudden cardiac arrest of our sons and daughters while entrusted to our public schools in the course of their education; and be it further\n\nResolved, That the State Board of Education be urged to include provisions in policies and regulations for AED training in student health education courses and regular AED drills, so that students and staff will be better prepared to use AEDs to save lives in schools and other public places; and be it further\n\nResolved, That the State Board of Education advise schools to facilitate the education of students and their families to identify situations where students may be at risk; and be it further\n\nResolved, That the Michigan High School Athletic Association be inspired to have Michigan schools implement nationally-applied standards for pre-participation screening of prospective student athletes for conditions that may put them at risk of cardiac arrest; and be it further\n\nResolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the Kimberly Anne Gillary Foundation, the State Board of Education, and the Michigan High School Athletic Association as a symbol of our support.\n\nSenators Birkholz, Clark-Coleman, Garcia, Hunter, Pappageorge and Switalski were named co‑sponsors of the resolution.\n\nSenator Switalski offered the following resolution:\n\nSenate Resolution No. 126.\n\nA resolution commemorating March 16, 2010, as a Day of Remembrance for Victims of Drunk Drivers in Michigan.\n\nWhereas, According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration statistics, one person is killed in the United States by a drunk driver every 45 minutes. More than one person per minute is injured in crashes where alcohol is present, totaling over half a million people per year nationwide early in this decade; and\n\nWhereas, About 1 in every 3 Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related traffic accident at some time in their life; and\n\nWhereas, Since the founding of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) in 1980, alcohol-related traffic fatalities nationwide have declined by about 50 percent. Still, more than 15,000 lives across the country and over 300 lives in Michigan are lost yearly due to alcohol-related crashes; and\n\nWhereas, Ongoing efforts to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk driving and reduce the incidences of drunk driving and the attendant injuries and deaths have been effective. For example, fatal crashes involving alcohol have decreased from a peak of 63 percent of all fatalities to 30 percent currently. However, despite best efforts, it is estimated that those arrested for first-time drunk driving charges have on average driven drunk 87 times prior to being arrested; and\n\nWhereas, Michigan has seen a significant decline in the number of alcohol-related traffic deaths, due in no small part to the efforts of MADD and Students Against Drunk Driving (SADD). From a high of greater than 870 individual deaths per year now down to about 325 per-year alcohol-related traffic deaths in our state, these two organizations have helped to save hundreds of thousands of lives; and\n\nWhereas, Despite these and other efforts to eliminate drunk driving, perpetrators persist. Their victims are often innocent bystanders or occupants of a random passing vehicle. If by continuing to make public the issue and shedding light on the problem we can help save lives and recognize the suffering of victims, as well as their surviving relatives and friends, then perhaps some slight positive can be taken from the grief and horror arising from these senseless acts; now, therefore, be it\n\nResolved by the Senate, That March 16, 2010, be commemorated as a Day of Remembrance for Victims of Drunk Drivers in Michigan. May the families and friends of those lost to drunk drivers know of our deep sense of outrage for the senselessness of their loss and of our commitment to keep the memories of their loved ones alive on this day and for the rest of the year; and be it further\n\nResolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the state offices of Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Students Against Drunk Driving with our thanks for their continuing efforts.\n\nSenators Allen, Anderson, Barcia, Basham, Birkholz, Bishop, Brater, Brown, Cherry, Clark-Coleman, Clarke, Cropsey, Garcia, George, Gilbert, Gleason, Hardiman, Hunter, Jacobs, Jansen, Jelinek, Kuipers, McManus, Nofs, Olshove, Pappageorge, Prusi, Richardville, Sanborn, Scott, Stamas, Van Woerkom and Whitmer were named co‑sponsors of the resolution.\n\nSenate Resolution No. 115.\n\nA resolution to memorialize the President of the United States and the United States Congress to ensure that local businesses located in Michigan and their employees be the primary beneficiaries of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds appropriated to Michigan to stimulate the economy and create jobs.\n\nThe question being on the adoption of the resolution,\n\nSenator Cropsey requested the yeas and nays.\n\nThe yeas and nays were ordered, 1/5 of the members present voting therefor.\n\nThe resolution was adopted, a majority of the members voting therefor, as follows:\n\nRoll Call No. 114 Yeas—37\n\nAllen Clark-Coleman Jacobs Patterson\n\nAnderson Clarke Jansen Prusi\n\nBarcia Cropsey Jelinek Richardville\n\nBasham Garcia Kahn Sanborn\n\nBirkholz George Kuipers Scott\n\nBishop Gilbert McManus Stamas\n\nBrater Gleason Nofs Switalski\n\nBrown Hardiman Olshove Van Woerkom\n\nCassis Hunter Pappageorge Whitmer\n\nCherry\n\nNays—0\n\nExcused—1\n\nThomas\n\nNot Voting—0\n\nIn The Chair: President\n\nSenator Gleason asked and was granted unanimous consent to make a statement and moved that a statement be printed in the Journal.\n\nThe motion prevailed.\n\nSenator Gleason’s statement is as follows:\n\nI begin my remarks by thanking the Appropriations Committee for taking this effort up in a timely fashion. I would like to thank the chairperson, in particular, for his effort and all the members of the Appropriations Committee who looked upon this issue in these serious times of high unemployment for the Michigan state workers.\n\nMany times we have resolutions that come before this body. I think it would be somewhat difficult to find a more appropriate resolution than what we are addressing here today. We have heard, seen, and read about Michigan workers being left behind in these tough economic times as well. These are historic times for Michigan workers. We should do all we can as representatives of those workers, contractors, and businesses to make sure that the money is available—that it goes to the local recipients.\n\nIt has come to my attention that Genesee County was the recipient of Recovery money; yet, those who had the ability to make a decision to put our contractors, workers, suppliers, and vendors to work chose a different path. That is why I think it is important that we pass this resolution.\n\nWe are leaving too many Michigan workers behind in our state who should be receiving this money. Receiving the money means a paycheck. This should be a bipartisan effort, but upon working with those in the process—both in the majority and minority caucuses—it has come to light that we not only lost opportunities in our state to put state workers to work in our counties, but we, indeed, had lost the ability to hire Michigan workers to foreign lands.\n\nWe understand the new interest in green energy in this state. I think that we can be using those stimulus dollars here in this state to rejuvenate old plants to reinvigorate a new generation of workers. That has not been the course that we have chosen to take. In my county, one of the highest unemployment regions in the whole country, a board decision was made to send the money outside of our county. I don’t want that to happen in my county anymore, and I don’t want it to happen in yours. But it did and it shouldn’t.\n\nWhen I get news that we spend stimulus dollars dedicated to Michigan and American workers, and we send it overseas, China starts receiving our tax dollars. I reflect back to when we put together the Cash for Clunkers and Americans and Michiganians were put at odds. Many of the top vehicles that were purchased did not support American domestic products or American workers, but many foreign vehicles were made and sold to Michiganian families and American families as well. I think this is a vitally-important resolution. I wish that we could handle this as a chamber itself. That is how important I think this is to put Michigan workers to work.\n\nThe quality of our Michigan workers is being diminished because they are not being able to demonstrate their trade because of the high unemployment. This is a very personal issue. The high-skilled workers in our state who belong to trade unions—and those who do not belong to unions—can be recipients of this money. This shouldn’t be a union-nonunion fight. This shouldn’t be a Genesee County-Clinton County fight. This should be a fight for Michigan workers no matter where they are. If my area qualifies for stimulus dollars because of the high unemployment rate, the workers, contractors, vendors, and suppliers should be receiving this money.\n\nI ask that we join our voices together in a unified effort to say Michigan workers will be first no matter where they live.\n\nIntroduction and Referral of Bills\n\nSenators Switalski and Gilbert introduced\n\nSenate Bill No. 1221, entitled\n\nA bill to amend 1966 PA 331, entitled “Community college act of 1966,” by amending sections 105 and 121 (MCL 389.105 and 389.121), section 105 as amended by 2003 PA 306 and section 121 as amended by 1997 PA 135.\n\nThe bill was read a first and second time by title and referred to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\nSenator Whitmer introduced\n\nSenate Bill No. 1223, entitled\n\nA bill to amend 1975 PA 46, entitled “An act to create the office of the legislative corrections ombudsman;

That day will be next week, Tuesday, March 16. It is the anniversary of the death of four high school students in my city of Roseville who were killed by a drunk driver. This proposal was made to me by two kids who knew those students—Ashley Lowry and Roger Allen, who were impacted by the death, as were many people in Roseville and the surrounding communities late last year in Macomb County. I want to thank everybody for co‑sponsoring and passing that. We should remember all victims of drunk drivers on that day and continue our efforts in Lansing and across this state to deal with this problem.\n\nSenator Birkholz’s statement is as follows:\n\nI was absent on Tuesday, March 9, because I was in Washington, D.C., working on Great Lakes issues. So for Roll Call No. 93, the amendment to Senate Bill No. 800, I would have voted “no.” On Roll Call No. 94, Senate Bill No. 800, I would have voted “yes.” On Roll Call No. 95, Senate Bill No. 1091, I would have voted “yes.” On Roll Call No. 96, the substitute to House Bill No. 4932, I would have voted “no.” On Roll Call No. 97, House Bill No. 4932, I would have voted “yes.” On Roll Call No. 98, Senate Bill No. 1030, I would have voted “yes.” On Roll Call No. 99, Senate Bill No. 1135, I would have voted “yes.”\n\nSenator Scott’s statement is as follows:\n\nLike the song says, “We all need somebody to lean on.” Our constituents lean on us and expect us to do what is best for them. In that sense, they are our extended families. We can’t always do everything they ask of us; just like we can’t always give our kids what they want. So we learn to do what they most need us to do. We learn to do what is best for them.\n\nI believe that one of the things that we most need to do for the citizens of this great state—one thing that is among the best things we can do—is to pass legislation to reform auto insurance and create fair and affordable rates. Affordable auto insurance would eliminate one unnecessary hardship that too many people are dealing with right now. No one minds paying a bill if it’s reasonable. It’s the unfair, unreasonably-high bills that set our blood boiling.\n\nInsurance is necessary, and it’s required. But it shouldn’t cost so much that people cannot afford it. Please work with me to pass the legislation we have introduced and bring fairness and affordable auto insurance rates to our hardworking Michigan citizens.\n\nSenator Bishop’s statement is as follows:\n\nI know oftentimes we watch what is going on at our great universities, especially down in Ann Arbor, for all the great athletic prowess that we see around the state and great victories that we have seen over the years. Often we forget about the things that happen locally. I just want to point out that the other night, Oakland University down in Rochester Hills, Michigan, secured the Summit League Championship with their eleventh straight win.\n\nThis is the winningest team in the history of the Summit League. They are 26-8 with their win over Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis—a very confusing team that they played; that is one team. They secured an automatic bid to the NCAA Championship, which is the second time they have done that. I want to congratulate the Oakland University Golden Grizzlies and Coach Kampe for a stellar year and making us all proud. I hope that we can all join together to express our gratitude to Coach Kampe for his leadership and the Oakland University Golden Grizzlies.\n\nSenator Sanborn’s statement is as follows:\n\nThis is a supplemental statement to Oakland University’s great success, with Romeo’s own Blake Cushingberry, the nephew of Representative Cushingberry, playing for Oakland University and starring there. This is their second time in the last five years that they have been in the NCAA Tournament. This makes them officially the second-best basketball team in the state of Michigan.\n\nCommittee Reports\n\nThe Committee on Local, Urban and State Affairs reported\n\nHouse Bill No. 5495, entitled\n\nA bill to amend 1992 PA 147, entitled “Neighborhood enterprise zone act,” by amending section 12 (MCL 207.782), as amended by 2006 PA 661.\n\nWith the recommendation that the bill pass.\n\nThe committee further recommends that the bill be given immediate effect.\n\nGerald Van Woerkom\n\nChairperson\n\nTo Report Out:\n\nYeas: Senators Van Woerkom, Allen, Gleason and Basham\n\nNays: None\n\nThe bill was referred to the Committee of the Whole.\n\nThe Committee on Local, Urban and State Affairs reported\n\nHouse Bill No. 5698, entitled\n\nA bill to amend 1967 PA 288, entitled “Land division act,” by amending sections 102, 151, 172, 173, 198, 210, 224a, 229, 242, 244, 255b, 256, 257, and 290 (MCL 560.102, 560.151, 560.172, 560.173, 560.198, 560.210, 560.224a, 560.229, 560.242, 560.244, 560.255b, 560.256, 560.257, and 560.290), section 102 as amended by 1996 PA 591 and section 224a as amended by 1996 PA 219.\n\nWith the recommendation that the bill pass.\n\nThe committee further recommends that the bill be given immediate effect.\n\nGerald Van Woerkom\n\nChairperson\n\nTo Report Out:\n\nYeas: Senators Van Woerkom, Allen, Gleason and Basham\n\nNays: None\n\nThe bill was referred to the Committee of the Whole.\n\nCOMMITTEE ATTENDANCE REPORT\n\nThe Committee on Local, Urban and State Affairs submitted the following:\n\nMeeting held on Tuesday, March 9, 2010, at 3:00 p.m., Room 110, Farnum Building\n\nPresent: Senators Van Woerkom (C), Allen, Gleason and Basham\n\nExcused: Senator Birkholz\n\nThe Committee on Judiciary reported\n\nSenate Bill No. 332, entitled\n\nA bill to amend 1915 PA 123, entitled “An act to provide for the recording and use in evidence of affidavits affecting real property;
