He has published four monographs, two edited collections, and more than thirty articles on the cultures of business, money and credit in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain. These draw from political, social, legal, literary, medical, and cultural history and their associated bodies of theoretical literature to shed new light on how financial institutions and practices work, not just economically but also as central players in people’s lived experience. At Lehman, he has served as Chair of the History Department, Dean of Arts and Humanities, and Director of the MA Program in Liberal Studies; at the Graduate Center, he has served as Deputy Executive Officer of the History Department. He has taught courses on British and European history, science and society, the history of capitalism, and the history of popular music. In addition to his teaching and academic work, Alborn edited a music fanzine, Incite!, from 1985 to 1998, and from 1989 to 1998 ran the influential indie-pop label Harriet Records, which he revived in 2021.\n\nAlborn’s first book, Conceiving Companies: Joint-Stock Politics in Victorian England (Routledge, 1998), and a later edited collection, show how companies’ success hinged on their ability to borrow from the new processes and rhetoric that accompanied political reform and the rise of the administrative state in the UK. His second, Regulated Lives: Life Insurance and British Society, 1800-1914 (Toronto, 2009), connects an extensive archival record spanning dozens of companies to theoretical questions concerning the rise and maturation of modern bureaucratic institutions. This book, several related articles, and an edited collection argue that the regulatory capacity of British life insurance was less than the sum of its actuarial, medical, and organizational parts, since the new sciences that claimed expertise on its behalf worked at odds with each other, providing customers with surprising levels of agency. Alborn’s two most recent books, All That Glittered: Britain’s Most Precious Metal from Adam Smith to the Gold Rush (Oxford, 2019) and Misers: British Responses to Extreme Saving (Routledge, 2022), tackle the question of money’s paradoxical place in Britain’s rise as a world power between 1700 and 1860. These both work from a series of thick descriptions of money’s manifold cultural meanings to ask larger questions concerning the causes of the century-long success of the gold standard as an international monetary basis; the ambiguous character of British national identity during the long eighteenth century, teetering between an ancient regime and modernity; and the tortured relationship that the “first industrial nation” had with its prodigious wealth. Both take advantage of the recent explosion in new electronic resources to undertake a comprehensive search through tens of thousands of publications, treating these as a vastly expanded library for nuanced cultural analysis rather than grist for quantitative research.\n\nCurrent scholarly interest: Representations of alchemy in Britain and the US during the long nineteenth century.\n\nFeatured Links\n\nLehman College Faculty Page\n\nDepartment: Classical, Middle Eastern & Asian Languages & Cultures\n\nEmail: ammiel.alcalay@qc.cuny.edu\n\nOffice Phone: 718-997-5586\n\nPoet, novelist, translator, critic, and scholar, Ammiel Alcalay is the author of some thirty books, including a little history, from the warring factions, Islanders, Memories of Our Future: Selected Essays, 1982-1999, and After Jews and Arabs: Remaking Levantine Culture.

Bergad has been on the faculty of Lehman College's Department of Latin American and Puerto Rican Studies since 1980 and the Ph.D. Program in History at the Graduate Center from 1985. He is an internationally-respected authority on the social, economic and demographic history of slave-based plantation societies in Latin America and the Caribbean during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He has published a series of innovative and landmark studies based on archival research that have broadened the historical understanding of Puerto Rico, Cuba, Brazil, and slavery in the Americas.Professor Bergad is the founder and director of the Center for Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies at the CUNY Graduate Center. He is the author of six books and numerous scholarly articles. His first book Coffee and the Growth of Agrarian Capitalism in Nineteenth-Century Puerto Rico (Princeton University Press 1983) revised the analytical framework for understanding Puerto Rican history prior to the United States occupation and annexation of 1898. He was one of the first foreign scholars to be granted unrestricted access to Cuban historical archives in the 1980s. His research there resulted in two books: Cuban Rural Society in the Nineteenth Century: The Social and Economic History of Monoculture in Matanzas (Princeton University Press 1990), which examines the evolution of the sugar plantation economy in nineteenth-century Cuba, and (co-authored) The Cuban Slave Market, 1790-1880 (Cambridge University Press 1995), the first empirical examination of the structure of Cuban slave society during the island’s reign as the Caribbean’s leading sugar-producing and slave-importing nation. For this latter book he took thirteen Lehman College students to Cuba in 1988 as a research team which worked in the Cuban National Archives along with twelve students from the University of Havana.\n\nIn the 1990s, he turned his attention toward Brazil and began research in the historical archives of Minas Gerais, Brazil’s largest slave-holding province during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. His resulting work was The Demographic and Economic History of Slavery in Minas Gerais, Brazil, 1720-1888 (Cambridge University Press 1999) is a detailed study of slavery in Brazil. He then wrote a synthetic work on the largest slave societies in the Americas, The Comparative Histories of Slavery in Brazil, Cuba, and the United States (Cambridge University Press 2007). Finally, his Hispanics in the United States: A Demographic, Social, and Economic History (co-authored) (forthcoming Cambridge University Press 2010) is the first full-length quantitative study of the U.S. Latino population in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nThe recipient of several internationally recognized awards, including Guggenheim, Fulbright and National Endowment for the Humanity fellowships, he was the founding director of Lehman’s interdisciplinary program in Latin American and Caribbean Studies, chaired the College's Department of Latin American and Puerto Rican Studies, and was a member of the Executive Committee of the CUNY/Cuba (and later Caribbean) Scholarly Exchange Program, as well as the CUNY-University of Puerto Rico Exchange.\n\nFeatured Links\n\nCenter for Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies\n\nDepartment: English\n\nEmail: glenn.burger@qc.cuny.edu\n\nOffice Phone: (718) 997-4660\n\nGlenn Burger is Distinguished Professor of English at Queens College and a consortial faculty member in the Ph.D. Program in English and the Certificate Program in Medieval Studies at the CUNY Graduate Center.

At Queens and the Graduate Center he has taught courses on Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, Medieval transnational writing and East/West contact, pre- and early modern marriage, as well as Medieval literature more generally.\n\nProf. Burger’s early research interests were Medieval transnationalism and East/West contact, reflected in his first book publication, a critical edition of a Medieval history of Asia, the Mongols, and the Crusades by the Armenian prince, Hetoum of Korikos: A Lytell Chronicle: Richard Pynson’s Translation (c. 1520) of La Fleur des histoires de la terre d’Orient (1307) (University of Toronto Press, 1988). He also co-edited (with Cormack, Hart, and Pylipuik) the essay collection, Making Contact: Maps, Identity, and Travel (University of Alberta Press, 2003).\n\nHis second book, Chaucer’s Queer Nation, brought contemporary queer and postcolonial theory to bear on Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales (University of Minnesota Press, 2003) in order to rethink Chaucerian canonicity and questions of gender and sexuality more generally in pre- and postmodern contexts. Coupled with such work was the co-edited collection of essays (with Steven Kruger), Queering the Middle Ages (University of Michigan Press, 2001) as well as numerous articles and book chapters since then. These interests in queering Medieval gender and sexuality have more recently focused on the complex role the emergent bourgeois and gentry married household played in forging new early modern heterosexual roles, and with that a new relationship between the individual and the early modern state. His monograph, Conduct Becoming: Good Wives and Husbands in the Later Middle Ages (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2018), as well as the recent co-edited collection of essays (with Rory Critten), Household Knowledges in Late Medieval England and France (University of Manchester Press, 2019), reflect these broader interests in late Medieval marriage, the bourgeois/gentry household, as well as new modes of thinking about gender and sexuality in the period.\n\nProf. Burger’s current research and publication focus on bringing premodern affect and emotion in dialogue with contemporary affect theory and the history of emotion studies. With Holly Crocker, he has recently co-edited the essay collection, Medieval Affect, Feeling, and Emotion (University of Cambridge Press, 2019). Current work centers on affect and emotion in Medieval literature and Chaucerian texts.\n\nFeatured Links\n\nQC faculty profile page\n\nGC faculty profile page\n\nDepartment: Foreign Languages and Literature\n\nEmail: rchangrodriguez@ccny.cuny.edu\n\nOffice Phone: (212) 650-7920\n\nRaquel Chang-Rodríguez (PhD, New York University) is Distinguished Professor of Hispanic literature and culture at the Graduate Center and the City College (CCNY) of the City University of New York (CUNY).

He earned his Ph.D. in English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. Before coming to CUNY in 2001, he taught for four years at the University of Iowa. At CSI and the Graduate Center, Professor Dawson teaches courses in postcolonial literature and theory, and in the environmental humanities.\n\nProfessor Dawson is the author of Mongrel Nation (Michigan, 2007), which examines racism and resistance in the diasporic Asian and Black cultures of twentieth- and twenty first-century Britain. This book and his subsequent work, The Routledge Concise History of 20th Century British Literature (2012), show how vibrant new cultural forms evolved in tandem with movements that challenged coded racial discourses of cultural nationalism in Britain.\n\nDawson’s subsequent scholarship and teaching have focused on the climate emergency. His book Extinction (O/R, 2016) argues that today’s devastating biodiversity crisis is grounded in the need for capital to expand relentlessly into all spheres of life. Extinction, he shows, cannot be understood in isolation from a critique of our economic system. Extreme Cities (Verso, 2017) demonstrates that global cities are ground zero for climate change, contributing the lion's share of carbon to the atmosphere, while also lying on the frontlines of rising sea levels. Dawson argues that our best hope lies not with fortified sea walls, but with urban movements already fighting to remake our cities in a more just and equitable way. People’s Power (O/R, 2022) challenges several decades worth of neoliberal deregulation in the energy sector by advancing a theory of the renewable energy commons grounded in the need to stop thinking of energy as a commodity. Most recently, Dawson’s book Environmentalism from Below (Haymarket, 2024) takes readers inside the popular struggles for environmental liberation around the world. Grassroots movements and the communities where they are born—among the most vulnerable to but also least responsible for the climate crisis—have long been at the forefront of the fight to protect imperiled worlds.\n\nProfessor Dawson’s research has consistently been grounded in activism. For example, as the founder of the Climate Action Lab (CAL) at CUNY, Dawson has directed a team of twenty graduate students and worked with artists, activists, and researchers to examine and fortify grassroots climate adaptation efforts in NYC. Dawson aspires to help produce knowledge that will help people’s movements quell the fires increasingly consuming our planet.\n\nFeatured Links\n\nPersonal website\n\nGraduate Center faculty page\n\nDepartment: English\n\nEmail: mdekel@ccny.cuny.edu\n\nOffice Phone: (212) 650-6305\n\nMikhal Dekel is a Distinguished Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the City College of New York and the Center for the Study of the Holocaust, Genocide, and Crimes Against Humanity at the CUNY Graduate Center.

Subducting plate boundaries similar to where these submarine earthquakes happened are the most consequential source of tsunamis and pose a huge risk to coastal cities. The ultimate goal is contributing to better hazard predictions and education. Much of McHugh’s research has been accomplished as part of Scientific Ocean Drilling. McHugh participated in seven ocean drilling expeditions to the Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian Oceans with an upcoming expedition to one of the deepest parts of the North West Pacific Ocean, the Japan Trench.\n\nMcHugh has represented the U.S. at international proposal evaluation panels and workshops. She was a Distinguished Lecturer for the International Ocean Discovery Program, is a member of the United States Science Advisory Committee for Scientific Ocean Drilling and a Fellow of the Geological Society of America. McHugh has published >50 articles in peer-reviewed journals, co-authored >50 book chapters and contributed to national and international invited talks and workshops. Involvement of PhD, MA and undergraduate students is a large component of McHugh’s research projects. McHugh tells her students to find the type of work or research they would love to do, set your goals and reach for them! You will achieve your dreams.\n\nCurrent Research Interests\n\nLand-Sea Interactions in the Indian Ocean: Tectonics, Paleoearthquakes, Paleoclimate, Fluvial Processes\n\nDeveloping Tools for Submarine Earthquake Geology in Subduction and Transform Plate Boundaries\n\nGlobal Sea Level Changes and Seismic Stratigraphy along Continental Margins\n\nConnections and Reconnections of Marginal Basins in Response to Average Global Sea Level Changes\n\nImpact of Sea Level Changes, Storms and Pollution in Estuaries and Coas\n\nFeatured Links\n\nSEES-QC Faculty Page\n\nGC Faculty Page\n\nQC Faculty Page\n\nDepartment: Epidemiology and Biostatistics\n\nEmail: renee.goodwin@sph.cuny.edu\n\nOffice Phone: (646) 364-9611\n\nRenee Goodwin is a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, The City University of New York, Adjunct Faculty in the Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, and a licensed Clinical Psychologist.\n\nAs an internationally recognized expert in psychiatric and substance use epidemiology, Dr. Goodwin’s work focuses on integrating theory and tools from the fields of human ecology, clinical psychology, population mental health, health services research and substance use epidemiology to identify key public health issues affecting the population, to measure their effects, and then to develop and implement pathways for positive change using a multilevel approach from a life course perspective.

Following his graduation from Bronx Science, he earned degrees from MIT and the University of Illinois. He then briefly taught at Ohio State University and University of California, Berkley, before joining the faculty of CCNY, where he is now approaching his 50th year as a contributor to that CUNY college. During those years he also served as visiting scientist/professor at numerous prestigious institutions, including MIT, Technical University of Vienna, Oxford University, and National University of Singapore, among others.Among his most notable achievements is the 1989 publication, in collaboration with Dr. Michael Horne and Dr. Anton Zeilinger, of what is known as the GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) Theorem, a significant advancement over John Stewart Bell's groundbreaking 1964 theorem regarding hidden variable theories in quantum mechanics.\n\nSince that time his research has focused on fundamental problems in quantum theory, mostly using quantum optics. Recently, he has been involved in studying a restricted form of time-travel in quantum theory, and he also conducted a study (with W. Schleich, and E. Rasel) of the relativistic effects possible with atomic and neutron interferometers, and the differences between these techniques.\n\nSome of Professor Greenberger's other honors include receiving the Humboldt Prize from Germany in 1988 and being elected a fellow of the American Physical Society in 1999, as well as being elected a foreign member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In the fall of 2011, he had a renewal of a senior scientist award from the Humboldt Foundation, and worked for two months in Ulm, the birthplace of Einstein. He has served as a consultant to the Nobel Prize Committee in physics, and co-founded (with Prof. Zeilinger) the topical group on Quantum Information for the American Physical Society. Additionally, he was the subject of a two-issue festschrift published by the Journal Foundations of Physics in honor of his 65th birthday in 1999, and in 2009, a conference on \"Fundamental Problems in Quantum Mechanics\" was held at the University of Vienna in honor of his 75th birthday.

An internationally recognized scholar of film, media and visual studies, Griffiths’s research crosses the fields of film studies, nineteenth century visual culture, and medieval visual studies and examines cinema’s relationship to and experience in, non-traditional spaces of media consumption. Griffiths is the recipient of a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship, a Meyers Fellowship from the Huntington Library, and a Project Development grant from the American Council of Learned Societies. Her research has also been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, the Eugene Lang Foundation, and PSC-CUNY. Griffiths received a Felix Gross Award for outstanding research by a CUNY junior faculty member and has twice won Baruch College’s Presidential Distinguished Scholarship Award. In 2015-2016, Griffiths served as Interim Dean of the Weissman School of Arts and Sciences at Baruch.\n\nGriffiths is the author of three monographs and over 35 journal articles and book chapters. Her ground-breaking first book, Wondrous Difference: Cinema, Anthropology, and Turn-of-the-Century Visual Culture (Columbia University Press, 2003), won the Sixteenth Annual Society for Cinema and Media Studies Dissertation Award in 1999; the Katherine S. Kovacs Award for the best published book in film and media studies in 2003; and honorable mention for the Krazna Krausz Moving Image Book Award in 2004. Her second book, Shivers Down Your Spine: Cinema, Museums, and the Immersive View (Columbia, 2008) sought to explode the myth that ideas of immersion endemic to so many contemporary viewing spaces, popular entertainment, and digital media platforms are in any way new. Tracing the idea of a revered gaze to the medieval cathedral, virtual reality to the nineteenth century panorama, fantasies of total immersion to the planetarium space show, and contemporary debates around the utility of immersive and interactive exhibits to the nineteenth century science museum, Shivers Down Your Spine developed new theories of immersive spectatorship. Her third book, Carceral Fantasies: Cinema and Prisons in Early Twentieth Century American (Columbia, 2016) examined how cinema gained a foothold in American penitentiaries as well as the range of early images of inmates that fed the carceral imagination. Her fourth book, Nomadic Cinema: A Cultural Geography of the Expedition Film is under contract with Columbia UP and examines cinema as a tool of exploration in the interwar period. Griffiths’ interdisciplinary research has appeared in such journals as the Journal of Visual Culture, Cinema Journal, Screen, Film History, Wide Angle, Continuum, Visual Anthropology Review, Early Popular Visual Culture, Journal of Popular Film and Television, and in numerous anthologies on early cinema, media history, and media audiences.\n\nFeatured Links\n\nPersonal website\n\nBaruch Faculty Page\n\nDepartment: Community Health and Social Sciences\n\nEmail: Christian.Grov@sph.cuny.edu\n\nOffice Phone: (646) 364-0254\n\nChristian Grov is a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Community Health and Social Sciences at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy.

Her courses and scholarship focus on issues of production and meaning for both medieval and contemporary makers and audiences, with special attention to issues such as visuality and materiality.\n\nShe has published on material from the early Christian period to the Gothic, from across Europe to the Eastern Mediterranean. Her work has appeared in Art History, Art Bulletin, Gesta, Speculum, and many other journals and collections. Her books include Portrayed on the Heart: Narrative Effect in Pictorial Lives of the Saints from the Tenth through the Thirteenth Century, 2001, Strange Beauty: Origins and Issues in the Making of Medieval Reliquaries 400-circa 1204, 2012, The Reliquary Effect: Enshrining the Sacred Object, 2017, “The Thing of Mine I have Loved the Best:” Significant Jewels, (Exhibition catalog, Les Enluminures, New York), 2018, and Passion Relics and the Medieval Imagination, 2020. With Holger Klein she edited Saints and Sacred Matter: The Cult of Relics in Byzantium and Beyond, 2015 and with Avinoam Shalem, Seeking Transparency: Rock Crystal across the Mediterranean, 2020. She has served on the boards of the ICMA, CASVA, and CAA online reviews.\n\nHahn earned her PhD from the Johns Hopkins University and her MA from the University of Chicago. She previously taught at Florida State University where she was Gulnar K. Bosch professor of Art History. Among other honors, she has been a member at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the Center for Advanced Study of the Visual Arts in DC, and was elected a Fellow of the Medieval Academy.\n\nShe is best known for her work on reliquaries which began with the article: “The Voices of the Saints, What Do Speaking Reliquaries Say?” Gesta, 36, 1997 (read in many medieval art history classes), and that work has grown into an examination of the societal, historical, and art historical issues surrounding relics and reliquaries. In line with these interests, she participated in the planning of the major exhibition “Treasures of Heaven: Saints, Relics and Devotion in the Middle Ages” that had venues in Cleveland, Baltimore, and London, contributing an essay for the catalog. During the run of the show, Hunter staged its own show in which medieval reliquaries were put in dialogue with contemporary art: Objects of Devotion and Desire: Medieval Relic to Contemporary Art. The show was curated by Hahn and a group of M.A., Ph.D., and MFA. students.\n\nCurrent scholarly interests:\n\nProfessor Hahn is working again with manuscripts-- from early Psalters (especially the famous Utrecht Psalter) to secular Renaissance textbooks. For the latter project she is preparing a series of courses leading to a show for Hunter’s Leubsdorf Gallery.\n\nHer work on reliquary pendants has led to an ongoing interest in bodily adornment of the medieval period—from jewelry to armour-- and the way that these things create identity: A book is planned with Reaktion press (London). She has recently written an essay on a contemporary jeweler who was inspired by the Middle ages as well as the work of a major contemporary artist who uses materials and community in a way she compared to the construction of reliquaries. She continues to probe questions concerning reliquaries and their significance.\n\nFeatured Links\n\nHunter Art and Art History faculty page\n\nPenn State University Press\n\nDepartment: Earth and Environmental Science\n\nEmail: george.hendrey@qc.cuny.edu\n\nOffice Phone: (718) 997-3325\n\nDistinguished Professor of Earth and Environmental Science at Queens CollegeProfessional Preparation\n\nUndergraduate-\n\nUniversity of Washington Zoology B.A., 1966\n\nGraduate-\n\nUniversity of Washington Civil Engineering/Water and Air Resources M.S., 1970\n\nUniversity of Washington Civil Engineering/Comparative Limnology Ph.D., 1973\n\nAppointments\n\n2005 – present City\n\nUniversity of New York.
