His journey has guided him to become a dedicated family man, committed friend and a supportive neighbor to Miami Gardens' residents and business community. Born and raised in Miami-Dade County, Harris, a member of the Saint Author's Masonic Lodge Number 488, moved his family to the City of Miami Gardens more than 20-years ago. Since then, he and his wife, Shebra, a public-school teacher, have successfully raised five children with Jacory Harris graduate of the University of Miami, Chelsi and Demi Harris who are attending college in Tallahassee, Robert Harris is a student at Miami Dade College and Robin Harris is raising her beautiful baby boy with her fianc√©.\n\nAs a Senior Juvenile Probation Officer for the State of Florida, Harris has spent nearly all his adult career in government. He has focused on helping youth make better decisions and be productive members of their community. Harris is noted as one of the founders of the Department of Juvenile Justice's \"Success Through Empowerment Program\" (STEP). This mentoring program targets both at-risk youth and youth who have had contact with the criminal justice system. The STEP program was recognized by the Davis Prudential Award for outstanding service to the State of Florida. In 2008, Harris was recognized by his colleagues for his tireless work becoming Employee of the Year, an honor bestowed upon him by his employer, the Department of Juvenile Justice.\n\nAs demonstrated in his professional life, Harris' community life has also been focused on youth and others. For approximately six years, Harris served as a high school football coach at his alma mater, Miami Northwestern Senior High, during which the team was undefeated for two years in a row (2006 and 2007) and went on to win a national championship (2007). He helped organize a non- profit support group for students (Dreamers 2010) a scholarship program designed to help increase the chances of inner-city youth to obtain a college education.\n\nHarris' love for family and others dates back to his childhood. He grew up in a loving two-parent household in Miami's inner cities. His parents instilled in him, and his five brothers and sister the importance of family, moral values, hard work, and a Christian faith. It eventually paid off despite hard times and constant struggle. He and siblings graduated from Miami Northwestern Senior high school. Harris went on to further his education on a football scholarship to Iowa State University where he earned a bachelor's degree in Hospitality and Institutional Management. After graduation, Harris returned to Miami, where he married his high school sweetheart, Shebra Pollock, and started a family.\n\nIn November 2012, Harris was elected by his neighbors and the residents of the City of Miami Gardens to serve as Councilman for Seat 3. In August of 2016, Harris was re-elected for a second term. In 2018, Harris was appointed to Vice Mayor of the City of Miami Gardens. The City of Miami Gardens became a better place to live, play, work and worship as a result of Harris' service. On November 16th, 2020, Harris took the oath of office becoming the City's third Mayor since its inception in 2003.\n\nHarris is currently the co- chair of the Miami Gardens Community Redevelopment Area (CRA). He serves as an executive board member of the Miami-Dade County League of Cities (MDCLC), an Advisory Board member for the Sylvester Cancer Center and he serves on the Miami Gardens Charter Review committee. He was recognized by Legacy magazine as one of Miami's fifty most powerful and influential black professionals in business and industry and was recently selected as one of the honorees of the Miami Dade Black Affairs Advisory board's 2019 black history month \"Vessels and Triumphant Spirits exhibits\".\n\nHarris' love for his city and its residents motivates him to diligently pursue excellence in making the City of Miami Gardens a thriving, productive place to live, worship, work and play."
