        "text": "Courtesy of Hebron Bicentennial Book 1910\n\nPhotograph of Hebron Center after the Fire of 1882 courtesy of the Douglas Library\n\nSylvester Gilbert was a successful lawyer, judge, and politician who lived in a large house located next to the Congregational Church. In 1790 Sylvester Gilbert was the wealthiest person living in Hebron Center. He owned at least two slaves Chloe and Cato, both of whom he eventually freed. He also owned a substantial amount of farm land for which he hired free African Americans to farm for him. To secure ready access to these farm laborers, Sylvester Gilbert so two acres where the CVS Pharmacy stands today to African American Henry Peters in the 1830’s. In the early 1800’s Sylvester Gilbert ran a law school for young men next to his house. His students included future lawyers, state representatives and governors of other states.\n\nSylvester Gilbert was the father of 13 children, five of whom were deaf. One deaf son Samuel trained as a silversmith. William Pitt, his other deaf son, trained as a furniture maker. Several of his hearing-impaired daughters were in the first school of the American School for the Deaf in Hartford. Each child found a role in Hebron’s community despite their hearing disability.\n\nThink about it\n\nWhat would it be like to deaf? How would you learn to read, if you were deaf?\n\nExperiencing the past –Put your hands over your ears and look around. Does the world seem different if you can’t hear a sound?\n\nWhere to go next-- From here walk toward Route 316\n\nMeet Your Neighbors QR Tours funded by the Hebron Greater Together Community Fund in conjunction with the Hebron Historical Society."
