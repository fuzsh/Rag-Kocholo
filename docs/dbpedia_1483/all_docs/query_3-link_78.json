        "text": "Sylvester Augustin Sers was born on August 18, 1933, in Bayou Derbonne, and found peace on December 5, 2023. He was the cherished son of Louis Sers Sr and Frances Sarpy Sers. Sylvester joins his siblings, Gilbert, Bernard, Raymond, Louis, Norah, Anthony, Frances, Adel, Genevia, and Mary Margaret, in eternal rest.\n\nIn a lifetime marked by love and dedication, Sylvester found his lifelong partner in Catherine LaCour, sharing a bond that began on Cane River. Their journey began in the Bronx, NYC and led to the joyous arrival of their first child, Genevia Marie. Sylvester's life was a testament to hard work, resilience, and passion. From the bustling streets of Bronx, NYC, to the serene landscapes of Albuquerque, New Mexico, he provided and nurtured his family. Sylvester and Catherine welcomed their baby girl Sylvia Ann in Albuquerque, a testament to the expansion of their love and family across different states. He was a devoted father to Marie McDaniel and Sylvia LaCour, a legacy that extends to his grandchildren: Dominick Metoyer, Gabriel McDaniel Powell (Duke Powell), and Blaise LaCour. Sylvester delighted in the presence of his great-grandson, Levi Powell. Sylvester shared a strong bond with his son-in-law, Ricky LaCour, embracing him as a beloved member of the family and cherishing the camaraderie and support they shared.\n\nSylvester was a man of many talents, known for his adeptness in various trades. His skilled hands mastered the art of pipe fitting, maintenance work, and plumbing, showcasing a work ethic that was second to none. His ability to troubleshoot and mend with precision was not just a profession but a testament to his resourcefulness and dedication to providing for his family.\n\nIn 1995, Sylvester and Catherine returned to the comforting embrace of Cane River, where he found solace and fulfillment. His love for the land was evident in his green thumb, spending cherished moments fishing, hunting, cultivating vibrant gardens of field peas, tomatoes, okra, and peppers, and gathering a bounty of pecans. His evenings were adorned with the satisfaction of a well-earned high ball, episodes of Gunsmoke and the creation of authentic fil√®. Sylvester found joy and companionship in the company of his faithful canine companion, Spot. Spot was more than a pet; she was a cherished member of the family, bringing warmth and laughter to Sylvester's life.\n\nHis dedication to his family was unwavering, and his legacy of hard work and love will endure through generations. A celebration of Sylvester's life will take place at Blanchard St. Denis Funeral Home on Friday, December 8, 2023, in Natchitoches, LA. Visitation will begin at 8:00 AM followed by a Mass of Christian Burial at St. Augustine Catholic Church at 11:00 AM where friends and family will gather to honor and commemorate his remarkable journey.The pallbearers, who will carry Sylvester to his final resting place, are: Michael Sers, Glen Sers, Bruce Sers Sr., Joe Sers, Tony Morales, Shawn LaCour and Norah Sers, Jr."
