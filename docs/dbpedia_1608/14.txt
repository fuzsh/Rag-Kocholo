Commencing operation in Sydney on 16 April 1962, the Southern Aurora was an Australian first-class night train, which travelled between Sydney and Melbourne on the new standard gauge line. Prior to this, interstate travellers would have to change trains at Albury. The train consisted of fourteen stainless steel cars. Ref: Wiki.
