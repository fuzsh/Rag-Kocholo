        "text": "As a park guide at Nordland National Park Center, Benny is more interested in nature and wildlife than the average person. A seat on board the 729-kilometre-long Nordland Railway brings you close to both. The journey showcases a huge variety of landscapes, cultures, and climates.\n\n\"The train crosses the large Saltfjellet mountain range, and you can actually see a botanical divide between the southern and northern part of the mountain, so the mountain is almost like a border. On the southern side, you have spruce forests, while on the northern side, you pass through pine forests. It's the same thing with some of the animal species, too,\" says Benny.\n\nYou can travel the Nordland Railway on board the night train as well. If you're lucky, you can spot the magical northern lights while travelling during winter. The night train is also well worth a ride in summer – the midnight sun keeps the sky lit up, so you don't miss a thing.\n\nTraces of history\n\nThe train passes several historic places on its way up north, including many World War II sites. The railway itself is also rich in history.\n\n\"I'm very interested in history and I like visiting historic places. While taking the Nordland Railway, you can see several World War II sites from your train seat, and you can also reach several from the stations along the line,\" Benny explains.\n\nParts of the railway were built by the Nazis using Russian POWs as forced labour during World War II, and the tough working conditions and extreme weather conditions led to many casualties.\n\n\"There were many prison camps in and around the Saltfjellet mountain range. I think it's important to not hide or forget that part of history, even though it's a dark chapter,\" says Benny.\n\nScroll down for an introduction to the most interesting stops along the railway!\n\nThe first stage from Trondheim\n\nBoard the train at the city's train station. Or, if you're travelling directly from the airport, hop on the Nordland line at Værnes.\n\nIf you are travelling during spring or early summer, the vibrant colours of blooming plants and flowers in the agricultural landscape will pop outside your train window, as the train takes you northwards along the Fættenfjord.\n\n\"Pay attention! If you are seated on the left side of the train, you can spot two concrete blocks on the other side of the fjord. They were the anchorage of the battleship Tirpitz, the world's most famous warship, which was hidden in the fjord during World War II,\" says Benny, adding that there is also a war memorial in the area.\n\nVerdal station: Historic Stiklestad\n\nOne and a half hours after leaving Trondheim, the train makes a stop at Verdal.\n\n\"From the train station in Verdal, you can walk to Stiklestad National Culture Centre, which is located around four kilometres from the train station. When a historic place awaits, it's worth the walk in my opinion, but you can also take a taxi,\" Benny explains.\n\nStiklestad was the location of the famous battle of 1030, where the Viking King Olav Haraldsson (later canonized as a saint), fell. The battle is considered the most important event that led to the consolidation of Norway as a kingdom, and Christianity's breakthrough in Norway.\n\nYou can also visit the Stiklestad Pilgrim Center. From here, you can walk on the St. Olav Ways, which stretch all the way from Selånger in Sweden to the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim.\n\nSteinkjer station: The Golden Road\n\nWhile in the area, why not cycle the idyllic Golden Road, where you can explore both beautiful nature, sample delicious food, and discover arts and crafts in beautiful Inderøy? To get there, switch trains at Steinkjer train station, and take the local Trønderbanen branch line to the train station at Røra. From Røra, it's possible to pre-order transport to Inderøy.\n\nIf you want to start cycling from the Røra train station, Visit Innherred hires out both electric and regular bikes, and can arrange to meet you right at the train station. Bringing luggage? No problem, it can be transported to your accommodation. Speaking of accommodation, you can spend the night at the unique, award-winning Øyna Kulturlandskapshotell, which also offers 3-course and 5-course meals made with local produce. It's one of the best restaurants in the area!\n\nLassemoen station: Namsskogan Wildlife Park\n\nAfter your golden detour, let's continue on the Nordland line!\n\nIf you're travelling with children, you have to make a stop at Lassemoen and visit the Namsskogan Wildlife Park! Here, you'll find lots of Nordic animals, including wolverines, lynxes, wolves, and bears. You can even sleep right by the wolves (of course, safely), in the park's exclusive lavvos (cabins based on traditional Sami tents), located in the bear and wolverine enclosures!\n\nIt's possible to pre-order transport from the train station to the wildlife park.\n\nMosjøen station: A quaint town and the Helgeland coast\n\nAfter leaving Majavatn, the train ride continues for an hour before arriving at Mosjøen. You're now in the geographic centre of Norway, and you should definitely spend the night here. The small town offers plenty to experience. Benny recommends stopping by a café in the historic Sjøgata area. Here, you'll also find well-preserved 19th century buildings, cosy shops, galleries and more – a perfect area for a stroll.\n\nOr get your pulse racing with a walk up a total of 4,000 steps on the longest stone stairway trail in the world made by Sherpas from Nepal: the famous Helgeland steps (opening in 2023)! Fly down Northern Norway's most spectacular zipline and enjoy a cold drink in the cosy Fru Haugan Hotel garden at the bottom. You can also climb the Mosjøen via ferrata.\n\nMosjøen is also a good starting point for a round trip in Northern Norway. Take the bus to Sandnessjøen, with excellent express boat connections to the islands and small communities along the spectacular Helgeland coast.\n\nMo i Rana station: Science and history\n\n\"Now, get ready for lots of tunnels, before the train takes us to Mo i Rana, my town,\" says Benny.\n\nWhen the train stops at the station, a 1-hour and 10-minute long trip from Mosjøen, Benny recommends a visit to what he calls ’a paradise of experiences’, the Helgeland Museum and the science centre Vitensenteret Nordland.\n\n\"The museum and the science centre are both located in the same building, which is visible from the train station. This is a good place for the whole family,\" Benny explains.\n\nMo i Rana is the third-largest city in Northern Norway, with lots of cafés, shopping opportunities, and cultural events. There are also many caves to explore in the nearby area.\n\nCrossing Saltfjellet: Svartisen National Park\n\nSit back and relax, as the train follows the Ranaelv river up Dunderlandsdalen valley into Saltfjellet-Svartisen National Park, where you'll find the second-largest glacier on mainland Norway, Svartisen.\n\nThe Arctic Circle\n\n\"Now we're heading up the Saltfjellet mountain range. There are fewer trees the higher we go, and large areas of barren landscape will start to appear. This is definitely a great place for hiking and biking,\" says Benny.\n\nYou will now hear a message over the loudspeakers as the train crosses the magical Arctic Circle. You're officially entering the kingdom of the midnight sun. Get your camera ready if you want to take pictures of the stone pyramids beside the railway that mark the Arctic Circle. You can also see the visitor centre, the Arctic Circle Center, from the right side of the train.\n\n\"Did you know that the Polar Circle actually moves 14 metres each year?\" says Benny as the train crosses it.\n\nYou might as well keep your camera to hand, as you'll have a great chance of glimpsing reindeer in the area as well.\n\nLønsdal station: Hiking in Saltfjellet\n\nThe first station north of the Polar Circle is Lønsdal, which is located at 511 metres above sea level.\n\n\"The train schedules are perfect if you want to go hiking here. You can take the night train to Lønsdal, which will arrive in the morning, and then take the day train in the afternoon when you're done hiking,\" Benny explains.\n\nIf you would like to spend some more time exploring the mountain, The Norwegian Trekking Association (DNT) has cabins you can rent.\n\nValnesfjord station: The children's national park\n\nNow, as the train is getting closer to the end station, mountains are slowly being replaced by views of the fjord. After one hour and twenty minutes, the train makes a stop at Valnesfjord, a great access point for hiking in Sjunkhatten National Park.\n\n\"The national park is called the children's national park, and you'll find hikes here suitable for all ages. In Øvre Valnesfjord, there are also trails accessible for wheelchair users,\" explains Benny.\n\nThe Valnesfjord area is also a popular place to go cross-country skiing during winter."
