        "text": "Travel from crystal clears fjords to small villages in the high mountains. Continue through deep valleys and lush agricultural landscapes. Travelling by train in Norway is really something else. It might not be the fastest way to travel, but it's definitely worth the time.\n\nNot only is the railway an excellent way to get up close to incredible nature, it's also a great way of travelling from A to B more sustainably. You can hop off the train to explore fascinating destinations close to the station, and hop back on again to continue your journey.\n\nExperiencing Norway by train\n\nA well-developed railway network, stretching from Kristiansand in the south to Bodø above the Arctic Circle, connects major cities in Norway. Most lines run through the capital city, Oslo.\n\nThere are also train connection to other Scandinavian countries. If you are travelling from Denmark, you can take the train from Copenhagen to Gothenburg in Sweden, before continuing on to Oslo.\n\nHere is an overview of the main long distance lines in Norway:\n\n2.How to get the best prices\n\n\"Remember that the cheapest tickets often sell out quickly, so book your trip as early as you can, especially in the summer, and look out for special offers,\" says Erik.\n\nIf you are travelling with VY, search for its 'Lowfare' tickets. You can book your tickets here.\n\nSJ NORD's 'Standard tickets' are its lowest priced tickets. You can book your tickets here.\n\nIf you are travelling with GoAhead Nordic​, search for its 'Lowfare' tickets.\n\n\"Don't forget that a lot of the train companies have discounts on tickets for children, young people, and seniors,\" Erik says.\n\nTravelling with your family to Oslo Airport? With Oslo Airport Express Train (Flytoget, in Norwegian) all children under the age of 16 travel for free when accompanied by a person over the age of 16.\n\nGood to know: Most of the cheapest tickets can’t be refunded, so if you need more flexibility, consider buying a 'flex ticket'.\n\n3.Travelling with kids\n\n\"It’s not a problem to travel with kids on the train.Some trains have a dedicated carriage for families with kids,\" says Erik.\n\nIf you are travelling with VY on the Bergen Line, the train has a free playroom for children, and an adjoining area with seating for the whole family. Just remember to tick the Family box when booking.\n\nSJ Nord also has family carriages with playrooms for children on its trains.\n\nAlthough most trains have a dedicated area where you can park your pram, remember to check in advance as you might need to book a place before your trip.\n\nIf the train has a restaurant car, the staff can help heat your baby food.\n\n4. The night train\n\n\"Many of the lines have night trains as an option. Just make sure to book the trip early if you want your own sleeping compartment, as they sell out quickly,\" says Erik.\n\nYou’ll find night trains on:\n\nthe Bergen Line (Oslo - Bergen)\n\nthe Dovre Line (Oslo - Trondheim)\n\nthe Nordland Line (Trondheim - Bodø)\n\nthe Sørland Line (Oslo - Stavanger)\n\nIf you’re taking the night train on the Dovre line (with VY), each compartment features two single beds (75 cm x 200 cm), duvets and pillows, and of course everything else you need such as a sink, mirror, towels, soap and bottled water. The compartment sleeps two. If you have children, two adults and two small children can share a compartment. It’s recommended that children older than 6 years old have their own bed. There is a wake-up call 10 minutes before the train arrives at its final destination.\n\nSJ Nord's night trains on the Dovre Line and the Nordland Line feature sleeping compartments with two made-up bunk beds, towels, sinks and drinking water. Families with two small children can share a compartment. If you’re travelling with older children, it’s recommended that they get their own bed.\n\nSleeping compartments on the Southern Line (with GoAhead Nordic) contain two beds (70 cm x 200 cm). On these trains, children under the age of 6 travel for free and can share a bed with an adult. A maximum of 2 adults and 2 children can share a single sleeping compartment. You can pick up water and earplugs for free from the food and drink trolley.\n\nYou can bring skis, bicycles or anything else you need on your holiday on most trains. Make sure to check with your train company in advance, as you might need to book space for your gear. The same goes for pets.\n\nIf you use a wheelchair, have mobility issues or have other needs, it can be a good idea to visit your train company's website to check accessibility options. You can also get help to book your tickets and anything else you require at staffed stations.\n\nReady for a holiday by rail?
