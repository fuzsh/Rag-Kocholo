        "text": "Metra will provide extra trains on the Union Pacific North and Union Pacific West lines on both days of the nationâ€™s largest free air and water show. On Sunday, Aug. 11, extra service will also be provided on the Union Pacific Northwest Line. On other lines with weekend service, Chicago area residents can use the regular weekend schedules to get downtown for the show. Full schedules for the extra service and regular service on each line are available at metra.com.\n\nMetra customers should be advised that alcoholic beverages and glass containers will not be allowed on trains all day on Saturday and Sunday (Aug. 10 and 11). Bicycle warning dates also will be in effect throughout the event, meaning that due to anticipated higher-than-normal ridership, it is likely that that trains will not be able to accommodate bicycles on board."
