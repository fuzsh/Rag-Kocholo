        "text": "The Cadillac / Wexford Transit Authorrity, branded \"WexExpress,\" and its executive director, Carrie Thompson, will be very involved with managing the grant for the next phase study and will play a key role in working with the Michigan Department of Transportation and the Federal Transportation Administration's Chicago office. WexExpress and Carrie will also serve as important cultural connectors with other mid-Michigan towns and will bring the crucial perspective of a transit authority when deciding how best to tie the rail into other transit options, like buses, for example.\n\nGroundwork, WexExpress, and other partners will be working with and connecting with communities along the line to visualize what service will look like in the individual towns. Part of the work will more fully assess which towns will become stops on the line. For towns that are likely to be stops, we will assess specific needs. Does the town want to update a historic rail station? If a community wants a new station, where do locals want it placed? What will a rail stop mean from an economic standpoint? What about other transportation connections—the bus system, multi-modal connections? How do we best connect the rail station to key business districts? During the study's engagement process, we will be excited to engage youth, especially the tens of thousands of college students along the line.\n\nYes, the nation is investing more in passenger rail than at any time in several decades. In Michigan, in addition to the north-south rail, a high-profile project is upgrading the Detroit to Chicago line to 110 mph. More broadly, Chicago's in-city and regional rail network are receiving billions of dollars to modernize and maintain the city's role as a nationally important rail hub. The East and West Coasts are likewise receiving billions to build and expand high-speed rail. And the first privately funded passenger rail in a century just opened in Florida, in fall of 2023.\n\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 allocated $66 billion over five years to fund passenger rail projects nationwide. With this historic investment, now is the time for Michigan to advance our state's rail system.\n\nRail is a vital part of Michigan's clean mobility future. Together, with state leadership, we can ensure that trains play a major role in strengthening Michigan’s economy."
