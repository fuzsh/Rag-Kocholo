This is a celestial event that can play hard to get – images of green beams and purple glows are not the norm, and sometimes they’re barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nBut if you’ve come to photograph the Aurora Australis, there’s an alchemy that takes place behind the shutter, transforming the ghostly lights into a burst of colour. There’s a thrill in this hunt that’s turned thousands of Tasmanians into aurora chasers, seeking the finest vantage points on the best nights to witness this magical space shimmy.\n\nWe’ve talked to the experts and prepared a guide so you’ll have the best chance to witness an aurora. When you do, it's a dance you’ll never forget.\n\nHow to predict an aurora\n\nNo one knows precisely when an aurora might occur. Space weather maps and predictions are helpful, but ultimately the sun calls the show. There are long-range forecasts of auroras, but dedicated chasers often hang in suspense until just a few days before its stage call.\n\n\"We only know about three days in advance if an aurora might happen,\" says Margaret Sonnemann, creator of the Aurora Australis Tasmania Facebook group and author of the Aurora Chaser's Handbook. \"But that's just an educated guess. We never truly know.”\n\nAurora chasers rely on a series of resources in the quest to capture Southern Lights moments. The Aurora Australis Tasmania Facebook group has an active community of more than 100,000 people, while the Aurora Australis Tasmania Alert NOW page delivers on-the-spot reports of aurora sightings.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology’s Space Weather Services division posts current aurora conditions – you can subscribe for alerts – and there are apps such as My Aurora Forecast and SpaceWeatherLive offering information on the likelihood of auroras.\n\nWhere to go\n\nIn the dark of night, when word has spread of a possible aurora, dark and remote places around Tasmania begin to fill with people and cameras. The Aurora Australis is sometimes seen right across the island in open areas with unobstructed views to the south. But most of the prime perches are in Tasmania’s south, closer to the South Pole.\n\nPerennial favourite spots include Goat Bluff on South Arm Peninsula, about 35km south-east of Hobart; Carlton Beach, 40km east of Hobart; and Tinderbox, 20km south of Hobart. The summit of kunanyi / Mount Wellington is also a favourite spot, though the glow of Hobart’s lights can obscure the natural lights and you’ll need to brave the chill at 1270m above sea level.\n\nGood aurora spots in the north include the Highland Lakes, the hill beside Highfield Historic Site above Stanley, and Braddons Lookout near Forth.\n\nA good photographers’ tip: find a location that features an interesting Tasmanian subject to add to the dazzling sky. Spots such as Dove Lake (looking south towards Cradle Mountain), Coles Bay (looking towards the Hazards), the Tessellated Pavement at Eaglehawk Neck, and Cape Bruny Lighthouse can create spectacular photographic additions to the curtained night sky."
