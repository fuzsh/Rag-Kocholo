        "text": "Overview\n\nBringing rapid and reliable commuter rail to the region\n\nThrough development of rapid commuter rail service, this project aims to connect the northern towns of Mecklenburg County and southern Iredell County to Uptown Charlotte\n\nImagine hopping on a train in Mooresville, Davidson, Cornelius, Huntersville or North Charlotte for a direct connection to Uptown, no traffic, no parking hassles. Thatâ€™s the vision for the Red Line Commuter Rail. This investment in the North Corridor is building upon more than 15 years of planning. The 25-mile commuter rail would bring a supplementary rapid-transit corridor to the region, helping move passengers and driving economic development.\n\nThe North Corridor has changed a lot since the original design in 2008. This project will update the design of the Red Line based on these changes, planned development and land use, input from the public and technical considerations. CATS is engaged in a collaborative planning effort between the railroads, towns, city and regional planning organizations to establish a shared vision for the corridor.\n\nProject Description\n\nThe Red Line is a 25-mile commuter rail project using the existing Norfolk Southern rail line. The Red Line would provide a regional connection between Uptown Charlotte and the downtowns of Huntersville, Cornelius and Davidson, extending into Mt. Mourne in Mooresville.\n\nStations will function not only as park and rides but as integrated mobility hubs with bus services and first/last mile connections. Stations will also be incorporated into surrounding Transit-Oriented Developments.\n\nThe Red Line would provide a direct connection to the Charlotte Gateway Station and the surrounding entertainment district including the Carolina Panthers, Charlotte Knights, and Charlotte Football Club. The Gateway Station would also provide connection to the Silver Line Light Rail, the Gold Line Streetcar, Amtrak, and intercity and local bus services.\n\nScope\n\nThere will be multiple opportunities for public involvement over the course of the year, including several public meetings and direct community engagement."
