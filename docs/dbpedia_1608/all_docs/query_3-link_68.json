        "text": "Not all South Shore stations are accessible to passengers using wheelchairs. On our train schedule we clearly denote those stations accessible to passengers with disabilities with the international symbol. The following stations have platforms that are level with the car floor: Millennium Station, Van Buren St., Museum Campus/11th St, McCormick Place, 57th St., Hegewisch, Hammond, East Chicago, Miller, Portage/Ogden Dunes, Dune Park, and South Bend International Airport. Gary Metro Center, Beverly Shores and Carroll Ave. use a portable lift to access the center door of the car. Portable lifts have a space limitation of 34” X 42” and a maximum lifting weight of an occupied wheelchair of 600 lbs (manufacturer’s specification).\n\nTo hear the most up-to-date elevator status for SSL Metra station elevators, please dial (312) 322-6925 and select #1-Metra Electric from the automated options. Passengers may also click here for Metra service alerts regarding station elevators, including Millennium Station and Van Buren Street.\n\nTo receive the most up-to-date elevator status for the Gary Metro Center Station, please check the ADA page for service alerts.\n\nFor further ADA information, click here.\n\nPolice dogs, ADA service animals, or small animals (transported in carry-on travel cages stowed under the seat) are the only animals allowed on trains. Service animals are animals that are trained to perform specific tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability. Animals whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA. All animals must be under the control of their handler at all times. Any animals who cause significant disturbance or pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others may be requested to leave the train. Animals are not permitted to occupy seats.\n\nPolice dogs, ADA service animals, or small animals (transported in carry-on travel cages stowed under the seat) are the only animals allowed on trains.

Any animals who cause significant disturbance or pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others may be requested to leave the train. Animals are not permitted to occupy seats.\n\nStrollers are permitted on trains, but since space is limited, umbrella or collapsable strollers are preferred for easier stowing.\n\nDue to safety concerns and potential liability to our company, we will no longer assist passengers in lifting strollers on and off the train while a child remains in the stroller.\n\nThis is not intended to deny or prevent services to our passengers with children using strollers. However, we will require that the child be removed from the stroller before a train crew member will assist in loading or removing the stroller from the train. Whenever possible the stroller should be folded before being placed on the train and not unfolded until the stroller is removed from the train.\n\nIn instances where ADA assistance is required, please follow the ADA guidelines and use the wheelchair lift and ramps at designated station stops.\n\nWhen it comes to luggage, if you do it on the plane, do it on the train. In other words, luggage has to fit either under your seat (11″h x 15″d x 25″w) or in our overhead luggage racks (14″h x 17″d). Coolers must be placed underneath seats (11″h x 15″d x 25”w).\n\nLarge luggage (or other large items including coolers) can be considered a safety hazard or impede the flow of passengers. NICTD personnel reserve the right to deny train entry to passengers carrying luggage or other items that do not meet the size requirements.\n\nLooking for a quiet commute or a little unwind time after work? Try a South Shore Line Quiet Car! The last (rear) car of all rush hour trains between Michigan City and Chicago will be designated a Quiet Car. Seating is first-come, first-served. While Quiet Cars are not completely silent, they are a place for peace and quiet. Need to have a conversation or take a phone call? No problem! Just move to another car.\n\nOur onboard Conductors and Collectors must focus on safety and collection of fares as their top priorities. Crew members are assigned to multiple cars while on duty, and cannot monitor the sound level in the Quiet Car at every moment. Crew members and passengers alike must work together to create a quiet atmosphere by providing gentle reminders when certain passengers are not being mindful of Quiet Car etiquette. We expect any such exchanges to be civil – there is simply no excuse for extreme exchanges of words on the Quiet Car. Those who cannot maintain a civil attitude while in the Quiet Car may be asked to move to another car. Quite frankly, Quiet Cars can be challenging on any public transportation service, and we appreciate your understanding if your Quiet Car experience is not as quiet as one would like.\n\nQuiet Car passengers are asked to:\n\nBe respectful\n\nTurn off cell phone ringer\n\nMute all electronic devices\n\nKeep any conversation brief and in whispers\n\nTurn headphones down\n\nThere is no additional fee for the Quiet Car, but passengers are asked to occupy only one seat per person. Enjoy your quiet ride!"
