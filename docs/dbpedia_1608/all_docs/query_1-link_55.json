        "text": "As in Europe, train travel is enjoying a revival in Sweden, and Swedish train operators are meeting the growing interest in sustainable travel by offering a variety of rail holidays and routes. From business commuters riding the high-speed trains between Swedenâ€™s major cities to families boarding the seven-hour SnÃ¤lltÃ¥get sleeper to Ã…re, more and more Swedes are choosing to travel by train in Sweden. On a route like the Stockholm-Gothenburg express, rail travel may even be more time-efficient than driving or flying and is kinder to the environment, as well as stress-free. No need to keep your eye on the road or queue at airport check-ins â€“ just sit back and take in the views while your train weaves its way through Swedenâ€™s beautiful scenery.\n\nHow to do Sweden by rail\n\nFirst of all, you need to get here. The best part? Itâ€™s never been easier to take the train to Sweden: Hop on the morning Eurostar in London, change in Brussels and take one of the sleepers that SJ and SnÃ¤lltÃ¥get run from Hamburg â€“ and Berlin during the summer months. Youâ€™ll wake up in Stockholm 18 hours later, refreshed and ready to explore the city or embark on a new rail adventure in Sweden.\n\nSwedenâ€™s rail network\n\nSwedenâ€™s rail network covers swathes of the country, all served by different rail companies: Swedenâ€™s national rail company SJ, SnÃ¤lltÃ¥get, Vy and Inlandsbanan operate nationally and internationally. MTRX operate between Stockholm and Gothenburg. Buy your tickets on each train operator's website or in the station before travelling â€“ keep in mind that tickets cannot be purchased on board. Even if your route is operated by another train company, itâ€™s worth checking the SJ site for an overview of rail routes and destinations.\n\nTrains in Sweden range from SJâ€™s tilting Express trains (X2000 and X3000) and overnight sleeper trains â€“ courtesy of SJ, SnÃ¤lltÃ¥get and Vy â€“ to rural railway lines like Inlandsbanan. Although wheelchair places can be booked on almost all SJ trains, accessible travel can vary according to train company, itâ€™s best to check ahead.\n\nTicket discounts and rail passes in Sweden\n\nTickets are discounted for those under 26 and over 65, with children under 15 often travelling free, depending on the rail company and trip. To get the best prices, be sure to book in advance.\n\nIf you want the freedom to hop on and off trains and explore more of the country, opt for a Eurail or Interrail pass â€“ exclusively for international travellers."
