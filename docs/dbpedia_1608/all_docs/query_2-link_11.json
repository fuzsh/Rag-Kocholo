        "text": "First published in The Sydney Morning Herald on April 14, 1962\n\nSouthern Aurora Is New Concept In Australian Rail Travel\n\nLuxury, inter-capital trip\n\nFrom a Special Reporter who travelled on the Southern Aurora\n\nMELBOURNE, Friday. — The two new, £1-million luxury trains, which made their first through-run from Sydney to Melbourne on the standard gauge last night and today, opened up an entirely new concept of Australian rail travel.\n\nPassenger comfort of a high-order, and the improvement of service, should regain for the railways some of the patronage lost to airlines in recent years.\n\nThe N.S.W. Commissioner for Railways, Mr N. McCusker, described the train as “wonderful,” the Leader of the Federal Opposition, Mr Calwell, said it was “magnificent,” and Mr W. C. Wentworth’s comment was “it’s beaut.”\n\nMr Wentworth, who is chairman of the Federal Parliament’s rail standardisation committee, on whose recommendations the Albury-Melbourne project was undertaken, said Australia now had the “top train in the world.”\n\nThousands See Melbourne Arrival\n\nHe said: “Train designers all over the world will have to come to Australia now to catch up.\n\n“I have never ridden in anything like it.”\n\nThe Southern Aurora pulled into Spencer Street Station on time at 12.30 p.m. today, to be greeted by several thousand people, spilling into Spencer Street itself.\n\nI spent about 14 hours of relaxed comfort in one of the contemporary-styled and well-appointed twinette compartments. They compare favourably with luxury-class hotel rooms.\n\nThe familiar “clickety clack” of train travel is deadened by improved bogies, the two-inch-thick skin of insulation material, and the deep pile carpet with foam rubber underfelt.\n\nThe Breezes Get In\n\nMy only complaint—and it is not serious—is that the blankets (super quality, pastel checks) are doubled and allow for no tuck-in.\n\nA restless sleeper finds that the breezes get in.\n\nRailway authorities might forestall complaints in cold weather by leaving blankets single and providing a few extras.\n\nI was able to read by conveniently placed fluorescent lights, plug my shaver into a handy socket, and leave my shoes in a service cupboard to be cleaned.\n\nThe water was steaming hot when I took a shower in the shower-toilet-room opening off my twinette.\n\nThe conductor would have brought me breakfast in bed had I sought to press a call button.\n\nHowever, I decided to sample the food and service in the dining and club lounge cars.\n\nHaving had many R.R.R. meals in the past, I was agreeably surprised at the improvement.\n\nFull Menu For Breakfast\n\nThe menu included fruit juices, compote of fruit, cereals, fish, ham, bacon, steak, chops, pork sausages, lamb’s fry (with or without eggs), egg omelettes, eggs boiled, poached, scrambled, etc.. as well as toast, marmalade, tea and coffee.\n\nWhen the regular Southern Aurora service begins on Monday, passengers will have to pay £1/14/6 above first-class fare for these Facilities and service.\n\nIt will bring the single fare to £7/15/6 and the return fare to £13/6/.\n\nTo make the trip by air would cost £12/3/ first-class single, including transport to and from the airport, and £10/2/ for tourist class.\n\nAirlines do not give concessions for return travel.\n\nNow Dubbed “The Roarer”\n\nThe one incident on the run down gave the crew of the V.I.P. train quite a shake.\n\nA group of boys at Albury managed to penetrate the light barrier of safety precautions which surrounds any rail services under Vice-Regal patronage.\n\nThe boys strung lengths of paper across the line between the crossing gates after the pilot engine and Press train, ahead of the V.I.P. train, had passed.\n\nThe train crew, believing the gates were open, slowed down for a stop.\n\nWhen the train ploughed through the flimsy paper “garland” the train in “de Groot” fashion stole the show from the chairman of the Victorian Railways Comissioners, Mr E. H. Brownhill.\n\nMr Brownhill was due shortly afterwards to drive the train, hauled by Victorian locomotives, through a symbolic garland of waratah and pink heath where the new standard track to Melbourne starts.\n\nThe N.S.W. locomotives trailed streamers of paper until they were removed just as the train was pulling slowly into Albury station.\n\nThe name Southern Aurora is certain to be controversial for a long time to come."
