        "text": "It is easy to be comfortable.\n\nThe train has one or two things in common with the trains we used to know.\n\nFor instance, the wheels make the same clackety-clackety-click noise on the rails.\n\nThe noise is muted on this train, however.\n\nIt is comforting to hear, as you tuck up for the night in your ’roomette,” brush your teeth at your “personal wash basin,” drink a last glass of iced water from your “individual chilled water faucet” and press your “conductor’s call-button” to order breakfast in bed.\n\nAll this did not come about simply, of course. We surely cannot boast because it took us until 1962 to run a passenger train from Sydney to Melbourne.\n\nIt was not even simple today and tonight.\n\nJust before lunch today, I opened the door of the Governor-General’s “deluxe twinette” on the new train and almost fell over a 25-year old Latvian girl named Emmi Prado.\n\nEmmi was on her hands and knees polishing the stainless steel splash guard on the vice-regal shower recess.\n\nShe looked up and says: “It shines nicely, isn’t it?” and it did.\n\nAt this point, the new train was an anonymous 1201 feet of gleaming new train in a long shed at the Flemington goods yard, about seven miles from Sydney.\n\nDozens of girls like Emmi were at work.\n\nLarger numbers of men were checking fittings, testing the plumbing, adjusting the carpets and taking care of the engineering.\n\nEveryone, from railway commissioners to carriage cleaners, has a great pride in the new train. The three years of work on design and construction have been years of intensely personal effort.\n\nInterior decoration of the train, for instance, was planned, according to railway officials, by “a group of girls at the office.”\n\nLeader of the group was Miss Lila Grant, private secretary to the N.S.W. railways commissioner (Mr. McCusker).\n\nThe interior appearance of the carriages is pretty much like the interior of an aircraft.\n\nIt has the same machine-age look, with lots of aluminium and flush-fitting windows and plastic-covered walls.\n\nIt is a far cry from the old brown varnish and the pictures of Banff Springs hotel or the advertisements for special excursion tours.\n\nThe railways have gone to tremendous lengths to launch this train with just a little less fanfare than Stevenson managed when he first raised steam in the “Rocket.”\n\nThe train was slowly rolled from the Flemington shed at nine o’clock tonight to Sydney’s Central station to take on the Vice-Regal party and the rest of the inaugural guests.\n\nThe boarding ceremony was a finale to a large official dinner at the Trocadero, at which the new train was absentee guest of honour.\n\nThe celebrations begin again when we reach Melbourne tomorrow.\n\nTo be accurate, the new train’s name should be read as plural. There are two complete new trains.\n\nThe Governor-General and distinguished guests are aboard one. Less distinguished guests are aboard the other.\n\nFrom Monday, a new train will leave Sydney and Melbourne each night at the same time.\n\nThe two trains are identical. The railways on both sides of the Murray are playing no favourites.\n\nIf you have not travelled recently by train you will not appreciate just how superior the new train is. If you had travelled to Sydney on last night’s Spirit of Progress, your appreciation would be active.\n\nLoading\n\nThe new train is stainless steel from front to back. In the sunlight, it is a dazzling thing.\n\nThe facilities and equipment are quite extraordinary.\n\nIn daylight or darkness, in bed or sitting on a seat, you can be very comfortable and absolutely private.\n\nThe train has a dining car and a club-lounge car.\n\nThe club-lounge is something new to interstate travel on this route.\n\nIt is a little like the average suburban hotel lounge—bar and all—and unfortunately almost as vulgarly furnished and decorated.\n\nThe club lounges on each train have laminated and illuminated glass panels acting as something akin to room dividers.\n\nIn one lounge, the panels are decorated with koalas and kangaroos. In the other, there are lyrebirds and brolgas. The chairs in the lounge are heavy, ungainly and uncomfortable.\n\nThe idea is clearly to encourage passengers to go to bed early. So far, they are notably successful.\n\nIt would be uncharitable to be too critical of some features of the train when so much else is in the highest class.\n\nComing aboard tonight was like receiving a reward for superior virtue.\n\nTo get such a feeling, you must have spent last night in a rattling and rather dusty N.S.W. railways sleeping car from Albury to Sydney.\n\nLast night was upsetting.\n\nIt destroyed some of the affection I have always felt for trains since the days when we used to travel from the Mallee to Melbourne on school holidays in the slowest and most adventurous train the Victorian Railways ever operated.\n\nIn the morning, the conductor will serve breakfast in bed.\n\nThere is a shower. Near the mirror in the “roomette” is a plug for an electric razor.\n\nClothes have been hanging in the wardrobe for several hours now. The conductor has polished shoes left out for him.\n\nWe are speeding towards Melbourne at 70 m.p.h. and we can expect to arrive rested and ready for a working day.\n\nIt is nice to lead a normal life while you travel interstate."
