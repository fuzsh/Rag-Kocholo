        "text": "Journey Beyond has announced the addition of Vintage Rail Journeys – and some classic Southern Aurora stainless steel carriages – to its portfolio of iconic Australian train experiences.\n\nWith the purchase of the 17 ex-Southern Aurora carriages, Vintage Rail Journeys has now embarked on a mission to restore these iconic carriages and create unforgettable regional NSW itineraries.\n\nThe NSW stainless steel carriage stock was a type of passenger carriage operated by the NSW Government Railways from 1961 until 1993.\n\nThe carriages were mainly used on interstate trains such as the Southern Aurora, between Sydney and Melbourne, and the Spirit of Progress and the Brisbane Limited. They were also used on the Gold Coast Motorail to Murwillumbah.\n\nVintage Rail Journeys, founded in 2020 by Simon Mitchell and Danielle Smith, has gained recognition for its unique approach to rail tourism.\n\n“We didn’t want to see these iconic carriages sitting unused in a rail yard. Our vision was to design exceptional tours of regional NSW, offering guests a truly immersive experience and connecting them with the communities and producers along the way,” Mitchell said.\n\nVintage 1960s ex-Southern Aurora sleeper experience\n\nVintage Rail Journeys currently offers itineraries to the state’s Golden West, the Riverina Rail Tour into Australia’s ‘food bowl’, Northern NSW coast, plus special event trips to the Elvis Festival in Parkes and the Bathurst 100.\n\nThe vintage 1960s ex-Southern Aurora sleeper train provides guests with a unique journey through Australian rail history.\n\nVintage Rail Journeys represents a blend of nostalgia, history, exploration, and connection with regional Australia, adding a further rich layer to Journey Beyond‘s portfolio of iconic Australian experiences.\n\nJourney Beyond CEO Chris Tallent said he was excited about the new addition.\n\n“Vintage Rail Journeys perfectly complements our existing world-class rail operations, including The Ghan, Indian Pacific, Great Southern and The Overland.\n\n“We will be thrilled to welcome guests aboard these restored carriages in 2025, on one of our immersive rail experiences across regional NSW.”\n\nPlease wait while we sign you in with LinkedIn.\n\nThis may take some time.\n\nPlease be patient and do not refresh the page.\n\n(A new window from LinkedIn should open for you to authorize the Travel Weekly login.
