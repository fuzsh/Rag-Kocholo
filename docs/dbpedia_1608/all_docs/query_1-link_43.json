        "text": "The World's Best Train Ride?\n\nA few years ago, the Wanderlust Travel Awards included a new category, Best Rail Journey. So who won? The train to Machu Picchu in Peru? A train through the Swiss Alps? A ride through the Canadian Rockies? No. Readers of Wanderlust Magazine voted for the wonderful West Highland line from Glasgow to Fort William & Mallaig as the world's best train journey. Rightly so in my opinion, as the West Highland Line is not only the most scenic train route in Britain, it's one of my favourite journeys anywhere. This page explains what there is to see on the West Highland line, and how to plan & book a journey on it. You can also travel on the West Highland line on a daily summer steam train, or even on a luxury cruise train.\n\nWhere does the West Highland line go?\n\nThe West Highland Line runs from Glasgow to Fort William (the largest town in the West Highlands) and on to Mallaig, a tiny fishing port and terminal for the ferry to Armadale on the Isle of Skye. Most of the line is a twisting single track railway through fabulous Highland scenery, often miles from the nearest road. There's also a branch to Oban, the ferry terminal for several other Scottish islands. Just 3 ScotRail sprinter trains a day link Glasgow Queen Street with Fort William & Mallaig, fewer on Sundays, in addition to the London-Fort William sleeper, see www.nationalrail.co.uk for times & fares. It's not fast, taking 3h45 for the 123 miles from Glasgow to Fort William or 5h15 for the 164 miles from Glasgow to Mallaig, stopping at all wayside stations.\n\nA winter ride on the West Highland line\n\nThese photos were taken some years ago on a magical winter morning on the London to Fort William Caledonian Sleeper. Compare them to a recent summer morning's journey on the current London to Fort William sleeper here.\n\nTip: From Glasgow to Fort William, sit on the left-hand side for the best views northbound, right hand side southbound.\n\nClimbing Ben Nevis: Fort William station is only 10 minutes walk from the bottom of the tourist track up Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in Britain, 4,409 feet or 1,344m. It takes 3½-5 hours to climb, 1½-2½ to descend. Climbing Ben Nevis by the tourist track.\n\nFort William to Mallaig\n\nFort William is the largest town on the West Highland Line and the Caledonian Sleeper from London terminates there. But the West Highland Line extends further north to the fishing port & ferry terminal of Mallaig, and many people regard this as the nicest section of the route. Mallaig is the ferry terminal for the Isle of Skye and several Scottish islands. Four ScotRail sprinter trains a day link Fort William & Mallaig in each direction (one on Sundays), taking about 90 minutes - most run direct to and from Glasgow. On this section, the left-hand side of the train gets most of the best views going north, right-hand side going south, including views round the curve onto Glenfinnan viaduct - but if travelling to or from Glasgow, remember the train changes direction at Fort William which is a terminus, so you'll have to switch sides there!\n\nA brief history\n\nTiring of the 50-mile trek to the railhead of Kingussie on the Highland Line to Inverness, the citizens of Fort William decided they must have their own railway, and construction started in 1889. It was not an easy railway to build, across remote and difficult regions of the Scottish highlands. Lack of money meant the line featured many steep gradients and sharp curves as more direct alignments would have meant expensive viaducts & cuttings. The first trains linked Glasgow with Fort William in August 1894.\n\nThe next step was an extension to the sea, to serve the fishing industry on the west coast. A plan to serve Roshven was blocked by a local landowner, so Mallaig was chosen instead. However, the extension became something of a political football and the Mallaig Extension wasn't opened until 1901.\n\nThe separate branch line to Oban wasn't originally part of the Glasgow-Fort William-Mallaig line at all, it had its own route from Glasgow via Callander, opened in 1880 and operated by the rival Caledonian Railway. This passed under the Glasgow-Fort William line just north of Crianlarich, and you can just make out the old track-bed today from the train to Fort William. The line from Glasgow via Callander was closed during the Beeching cuts in the 1960s, and trains between Glasgow and Oban diverted to share the line to Crianlarich with the Fort William trains.\n\nFor more information, buy a copy of the excellent Iron Road to the Isles by Michael Pearson, £4.99. This has a route map and blow-by-blow account of what you can see from the train along the route, plus information about the history of the line. Highly recommended!\n\nThe West Highland Line Wikipedia entry provides some useful background to a journey on the line.\n\nPractical information\n\nTimes, fares & tickets\n\nLondon to Fort William by sleeper\n\nThe northbound Caledonian Sleeper leaves London Euston at 21:15 every night except Saturday night, arriving Fort William at 09:57 next morning. Fares from around £140 each way with a private sleeper for one or from £170 with a private sleeper for two people. The southbound sleeper leaves Fort William at 19:50 on Mondays-Fridays, 19:00 on Sundays, arriving at London Euston around 07:47 next morning. Friday nights are busiest, mid-week nights quieter so you're more likely to find the cheapest tickets. See the Caledonian Sleeper page for more information & online booking.\n\nElsewhere in Britain to Fort William & Mallaig\n\nYou can travel by daytime trains from almost anywhere in Britain to Fort William & Mallaig via Glasgow, use any British train operator website such as tfw.wales or www.avantiwestcoast.co.uk, international credit cards accepted with no booking fee or card fees.\n\nTravel on the West Highland Line: Glasgow-Fort William-Mallaig\n\n3 trains a day (1 on Sundays) link Glasgow's Queen Street station with Fort William & Mallaig over the West Highland Line all year round, with an additional fourth train between Fort William & Mallaig. The whole West Highland Line can be done as a day trip from Glasgow on Mondays-Saturdays, leaving at around 08:21, with 2½ hours in Mallaig, returning to Glasgow by 21:30. But it's better to spend a couple of days exploring.\n\nA day return from Glasgow to Mallaig costs £45.10, good for any train.\n\nA 1-month return costs £67.80, good for any train.\n\nAdvance-purchase fares (no refunds, no changes to travel plans) start at £5 each way. To check trains times & fares, see www.scotrail.co.uk.\n\nIn addition to the regular ScotRail trains, you'll find a Jacobite steam-hauled train from Ft William to Mallaig once or twice a day throughout the summer, see www.westcoastrailways.co.uk.\n\nThe Jacobite steam train, www.westcoastrailways.co.uk\n\nUpdate May 2024: The Jacobite is suspended until further notice.\n\nOperator West Coast Railways was given considerable time to fit central door locking to its slam-door coaches. But it failed to do so and was stopped from operating. It has now found a new set of carriages and is operating again, but with a shorter train and reduced capacity meaning seats may not be bookable online. Check with www.westcoastrailways.co.uk.\n\nDates & timetable: During the summer months there's a twice-daily steam train between Fort William & Mallaig in each direction. It runs Monday-Friday from mid May to early October, also on Saturdays & Sundays from late June to late August, leaving Fort William at 10:15, arriving Mallaig around 12:25. It departs again from Mallaig at 14:10, arriving Fort William about 16:00. There is a second round trip in the afternoon May-September.\n\nPrices: Special fares apply, £57 day return in 2nd class or £89 in 1st class. There are no one-way fares.\n\nThe train: You travel in British Railways 1950s Mark 1 or Mark 2 carriages, with opening door droplights and window ventilators that make photography easier than through modern trains' sealed windows. You may be hauled by one of several possible vintage steam locomotives, typically an ex-LMS 4-6-0 'Black Five'. There are 1st & 2nd class seats, a buffet car and a refreshment trolley. Harry Potter fans will find it a real Hogwarts Express experience, too, over the Glenfinnan Viaduct featuring in the Harry Potter films.\n\nHow to buy tickets: For more information & to buy tickets online see www.westcoastrailways.co.uk.\n\nTip: Book early, the Jacobite is very popular and gets fully-booked weeks or sometimes months ahead.\n\nTip: A limited number of tickets are usually available to buy on the day, even if the train is shown as sold out online. Ask the guard in car E, and have sufficient cash with you as cards are not accepted. But it's best to pre-book if you can.\n\nAdd a cruise in Mallaig: You can add a one-hour wildlife cruise from Mallaig in summer between the Jacobite arrival and departure times, see www.westernislescruises.co.uk. They run a departure designed to get you back in time for the return Jacobite, it's usually easy to buy on the day if you haven't pre-booked.\n\nConnection with the sleeper from London: I've been asked about this at various times over the years! The Caledonian Sleeper from London arrives in Fort William at 09:57, the morning Jacobite leaves at 10:15 from the other side of the same platform (there are only 2 platforms at Fort William!). It's such an easy connection to make if the sleeper is on time, but a risky one to pre-book as the sleeper can be delayed and the Jacobite won't wait. Given the high cost of a ticket for the Jacobite, either book the afternoon departure from Fort William instead, or do what I did, don't book the Jacobite in advance, if the sleeper gets in on time simply walk across the platform and ask the guard in coach E of the Jacobite if there are any tickets to Mallaig available. There usually are, even if the Jacobite is shown as sold out online.\n\nThe Jacobite about to leave Fort William for Mallaig. The Caledonian Sleeper from London has arrived on the other platform.\n\nThe Jacobite crosses the famous Glenfinnan Viaduct of Harry Potter fame.\n\nBus & ferry connections\n\nFerries from Mallaig to Skye (Armadale), Canna, Eigg, Muck & Rum: www.calmac.co.uk. The Mallaig-Armadale ferry sails up to 8 times a day, crossing time 30 minutes, fare £3.20 each way.\n\nBuses from Armadale to Broadford, Portree & other towns on Skye: www.stagecoachbus.com. Several buses daily Mondays-Saturdays, but no service on Sundays. Change at Broadford for another bus over the new(ish) & controversial Skye Bridge to Kyle of Lochalsh. You can then take another great Scottish scenic train ride, the Kyle of Lochalsh to Inverness line, then take mainline trains from Inverness back south. This makes a great circuit of the Highlands, if you can work out the buses.\n\nLocal ferry from Mallaig to Inverie on the Knoydart peninsula: www.knoydartferry.com. A local ferry sails from Mallaig along the coast to Inverie, a remote settlement unreachable by road, see website for sailing times. This makes a great day trip, visiting Britain's most remote pub, The Old Forge, www.theoldforge.co.uk.\n\nWildlife cruises from Mallaig, see www.westernislescruises.co.uk for days, times & prices.\n\nLocal area, food, hotels & accommodation\n\nwww.road-to-the-isles.org.uk is one of the best resources for information about the towns & villages on the Fort William-Mallaig-Skye 'Road to the Isles', for finding accommodation, local attractions & things to do.\n\nIn Fort William, there are many B&Bs and hotels. If you feel like pushing the boat out, there's the famous & luxurious Inverlochy Castle Hotel, originally the family home of the Baron Abingers from its construction in 1863 until 1969. It won 'Scottish Hotel of the Year' 2008, double rooms from £380 a night. It's 4 miles from Fort William town centre, but they'll send a courtesy car to pick you up from the station. For something less expensive but still comfortable, the venerable Alexandra Hotel is just across the ring road from the railway station.\n\nIn Mallaig, there are a number of B&Bs (try The Moorings B&B, I can highly recommend) or the West Highland Hotel (closed November-March). The Marine Hotel is right next to the station in the middle of Mallaig. Great location, and (unintentionally, no doubt!) something of a 1970s theme experience. For food, The Fish Market (www.thefishmarketrestaurant.co.uk) is well known for its excellent fish & chips, or try the equally excellent Steam Inn for fresh mussels & langoustines as well as good beer.\n\nShort breaks from London to the Scottish Highlands\n\nCall to arrange, they have offices in the UK, North America & Australia:\n\nUK call 0207 864 4600, www.railbookers.co.uk, download brochure.\n\nUS call free 1-888-829-4775, www.railbookers.com.\n\nCanada call free 1-855-882-2910, www.railbookers.com.\n\nAustralia call toll-free 1300 971 526, www.railbookers.com.au.\n\nNew Zealand call toll-free 0800 000 554 or see website.\n\nWest Highlands by luxury train: The Royal Scotsman\n\nScotland has its very own cruise train, the luxurious & exclusive Royal Scotsman.
