        "text": "The Railway Barracks was established in 1935. It was used to house train drivers overnight whilst the trains were being prepared at the Roundhouse opposite. Now, it is a fully renovated, historic event venue with onsite accommodation.\n\nHistory\n\nIn NSW, economic wealth from European settlement in the 1800s was largely generated from farming and pastoralism from inland settlements. Following the completion of the first railway from Sydney to Parramatta Junction in 1855, early railway expansion during the 1860s was largely undertaken for the purpose of connecting Sydney with these major rural railways. During this time, proposals for the first railways to the rest of NSW included a line to the inland centre of Goulburn. A single line from Marulan to Goulburn opened on 27 May 1869.\n\nAssociated railway structures at Goulburn included the goods shed (1868), the carriage shed (1869), engine shed (1869), a coal stage, water pump, turntable, and the Station Master’s residence (1870), the Roundhouse (1918) and the Railway Barracks (1935).\n\nGoulburn was the terminal stop for the Sydney Granville line and the Goulburn Roundhouse is where they would turn the trains around for their return trip. The train drivers would walk across the road and stay overnight at the Railway Barracks.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the property was extended to accommodate further sleeping quarters and again in the early 1990s, it was extended to include a large common room.\n\nThe Railway Barracks today\n\nIn 2017 the property was refurbished to serve as a combined accommodation and function centre for large groups who are looking for a boutique venue for their event. It now also has a large entertainment deck featuring a train carriage to compliment its history and to continue the preservation of the historic Railway Heritage of Goulburn.\n\nThe owner, Mark McEwen, wanted to renovate this property, not just to restore a piece of history but also to provide the community and visitors to Goulburn with a wider choice of accommodation and venue options, enabling guests to arrange their own bespoke event. He welcomes all enquiries about the property, its history and also how the Railway Barracks may help you with your event.\n\nThe Southern Aurora carriage (NAM 2328)\n\nThis Southern Aurora (NAM 2328) carriage was acquired from the Canberra Railway Museum in 2018 saving it from being sold for scrap metal. It was transported from Canberra to Goulburn by truck and a series of cranes, and then positioned on securely on steel tracks in its new home.\n\nA tireless effort was made over 2 years to restore this carriage to its former days, including the replacement of most of its double glazed windows, converted its 3 phase power to single phase, replaced over 1 kilometres of wiring to ensure it complied with regulation, and fitted with new air-conditioning for comfort. All lights, interior and exterior, were replaced with LED to reduce our emission footprint, and all original parts were used where required to ensure its authenticity remained.\n\nHistory of the Southern Aurora\n\nThese carriages were originally built of stainless steel by Commonwealth Engineering (Comeng), to designs first developed in the 1950s.\n\nThese 75 feet long sleeping cars were built for the Southern Aurora, they included “Roomette” (coded LAN) and “Twinette” (coded NAM). Both sleeping carriages were able to sleep up to 20 passengers.\n\nThe fluted stainless steel sides gave an appearance remarkably similar to the Budd-built cars of the USA railways of the late 1940s and 1950s. The reason was more than coincidence, as the steel was rolled on the same equipment which Budd used for the California Zephyr and other trains. Comeng bought the equipment and patents from Budd, and so all the NSW stainless steel stock has this familiar resemblance.\n\nThe Southern Aurora was a true “Limited Express”. It conveyed passengers only between the starting and terminating points. Uniquely in Australia, it conveyed only First Class passengers, all of whom were accommodated in air-conditioned sleeping cars, with all cabins equipped with showers and toilets.\n\nThe Southern Aurora was first introduced in 1962, when part of Australia’s railway gauge problem was being resolved with the construction of a new standard gauge line between Sydney and Melbourne. 197 miles of new standard gauge was laid from Albury (NSW) to Melbourne, parallel to the existing broad gauge line. Since then, all main land State capitals were connected by standard gauge.\n\nThe total capacity of the Southern Aurora was 198 passengers, weighing 630 tons, with 14 carriage set stretching 1,075 feet long. The train was hauled by two main line diesels in NSW, and one in Victoria. Departure time from both capitals was 8pm, and arrival time was 9am.\n\nOn a more personal note, this carriage was also acquired for sentimental value attached to my family who emigrated to Australia from Europe in the 1950s. Our families settled in both Melbourne and Sydney, and throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the Southern Aurora became the link between our families split over two cities. It is quite likely we would have stayed in this very carriage, if not walked through it many times on our travels. This carriage was also restored in memory of both Leslie and Elsie McEwen, my beloved parents and pioneers to the new world we call Australia.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the Railway Barracks and the history we have preserved.\n\nMark McEwen"
