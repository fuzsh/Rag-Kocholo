        "text": "A much-anticipated railway line could be extended to more towns than previously announced, a councillor has claimed.\n\nThe deputy leader of Northumberland County Council, Richard Wearmouth, suggested the Northumberland Line, which is set to open this summer, could also reach Newbiggin and other stations.\n\nThe multi-million pound project will see the return of passenger rail to the area for the first time since the 1960s.\n\nIt will run from Ashington to Newcastle, stopping at Bedlington, Blyth Bebside, Newsham, Seaton Delaval and Northumberland Park before continuing into the city centre.\n\nSeaton Delaval, Newsham and Ashington stations are expected to open this summer, while the remaining stations are not expected to open until 2025 due to delays.\n\nHowever, speaking at a meeting of the councilâs cabinet on Tuesday, Conservative councillor Mr Wearmouth claimed the line could go even further."
