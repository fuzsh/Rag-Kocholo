        "text": "The Alaska Railroad’s main line stretches 470 miles from Seward to Fairbanks, connecting communities all along Southcentral and Interior Alaska. The main line was completed in 1923 after 9 years of construction; President Warren G. Harding traveled to Alaska for the occasion and personally drove in the Golden Spike to finish the job. In 1943, the Railroad completed a 12-mile spur to the tiny port town of Whittier. In total, the Alaska Railroad provides regularly scheduled passenger service along 482 miles of track – an expanse greater than the distance between Boston and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Alaska Railroad operates year round, with scheduled serviced varying seasonally: the busy summer season stretches from mid-May to mid-September, while the quieter winter schedule spans mid-September to mid-May.\n\nTo see each train route highlighted on the map, simply click the train names to the left."
