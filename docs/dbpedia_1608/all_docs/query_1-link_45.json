        "text": "AT&SF 560 (Fairbanks Morse H12-044)\n\nSouthern California Railway Museum acquired this extremely rare AT&SF Locomotive over 30 years ago, the only one of the original six of this model Santa Fe purchased still in existence. After being in storage for 30 years, the Diesel Shop team invested a lot of time and effort to prove that the SF560 Diesel engine was operable, allowing the restoration project to move forward. Proposed restoration tasks include intensive cleaning, replacing missing or broken windows, handrails and steps, and returning the exterior to its former glory. For more information on this locomotive and its restoration, including the proposed paint scheme, please visit https://socalrailway.org/collections/santa-fe-railway/560-details/.\n\nLos Angeles Transit Lines 2601\n\nRestoration of LATL 2601 is almost complete. The major remaining project is replacing the damaged cast iron wheels with wrought steel wheels. The new wheels are in stock. The trucks need to be removed from the car and placed in the shop. The motors have to be removed before the existing wheel sets are rolled out and sent to a wheel shop to have the old wheels pressed off. The new wheels will be pressed onto the axles, the axles will be returned to the Museum, and the trucks will be reassembled.\n\nPacific Electric 1624\n\nPE 1624 needs to be painted inside and out. When 1624 was retired, the cab interior was painted a light gray. This project to return the cab to its original colors is underway. However, it needs additional volunteers to complete the preparation, priming, and painting of the cab interior and to prepare the exterior for painting.\n\nVentura County Railway\n\nThe Ventura County Railway No. 2 is the Museumâ€™s operating steam engine. During special events and select weekends throughout the year, you can ride a train behind the VC2 and experience the excitement of an operating steam locomotive."
