Along the way, the train stops in Wasilla, Talkeetna, and provides flagstop service along the 50-mile stretch of roadless backcountry south of Hurricane Gulch. Further north, the train stops as needed at Healy and Nenana before arriving to Fairbanks. Due to the nature of this service, the train’s schedule may vary depending on the number of stops.\n\nWhile the Aurora Winter Train travels the same stretch of tracks as the summer Denali Star Train, the views are strikingly distinct; the vibrant colors of Alaska’s summer landscape give way to the quiet serenity of pristine snow. Passengers may enjoy the winter wonderland of Alaska’s backcountry from the comfort of a warm railcar, complete with comfortable seats, large picture windows and onboard dining. On a clear day, a spectacular view of Denali rises into view above the Susitna River. And anywhere along the tracks, a watchful eye may be rewarded with the sight of a moose in the wild.\n\nFrom Anchorage, the Aurora Winter Train’s Saturday-Sunday schedule is perfect for a weekend getaway to Talkeetna; bring your skis and explore the area’s network of winter trails, or add-on guided dogsledding or winter Denali flightseeing.\n\nBetween Anchorage and Fairbanks, the Railroad offers a number of rail-fly packages; take the train one direction and a flight the other. Spring is a particularly popular time for visitors, as March sees the Fur Rendezvous and Iditarod Sled Dog Race festivities in Anchorage.\n\nOnboard services: Adventure Class service only. Dining car, baggage service (Anchorage and Fairbanks only), non-smoking cars, wheelchair access (Anchorage, Wasilla, Talkeetna and Fairbanks only).\n\nBuy tickets\n\nFor schedules, click here.\n\nFor fares, click here.\n\nFor the Aurora Winter Train route map, click here.\n\nFor winter travel information, click here.\n\nFor the Alaska Railroad Terms and Conditions, click here.\n\nPhoto credit Dave Blazejewski."
