        "text": "[narrator] This is Canada's famous VIA Rail train, carrying passengers on an epic journey from Winnipeg way up to Hudson Bay.\n\nThe route is also vital for freight.\n\nIt's a lifeline, bringing goods to remote First Nations communities.\n\nKeeping it open requires vigilance, brute force, and sometimes even fire.\n\nThe destination, Churchill, is known for amazing wildlife.\n\nIn summer, beluga whales, in winter, polar bears, and in spring, natural wonders.\n\nFilmed from above, this series showcases some of the most incredible railways on Earth.\n\nWe'll gain a unique aerial insight into these remarkable trains and the extraordinary landscapes they pass through, revealing the technology that built them, and the dedicated people who keep them running.\n\nWe'll uncover the culture, the history, and the engineering that makes these truly Epic Train Journeys From Above.\n\nThe VIA Rail passenger train is preparing to leave on a 1,700-kilometer journey from the heart of Canada, up north towards the Arctic Circle.\n\nCanada is huge.\n\nAt almost ten million square kilometers, it's the world's second-largest country, but also one of the least densely populated.\n\nVery few people live in its remote north.\n\nIn the west of Canada rise the famed Rocky Mountains.\n\nIn the east, fishermen used to supply the world with cod.\n\nAnd in the middle, the prairies, the country's breadbasket.\n\nCanada is by far the biggest exporter of durum wheat in the world.\n\nAnd it's from one of the prairie provinces, Manitoba, that VIA Rail train 693 begins its journey here in the capital, Winnipeg.\n\nOnce part of Canada's 19th-century fur trade, Winnipeg is now a modern metropolis, and a major rail hub for trains going east, west, and north.\n\nAt the historic Beaux-Arts Union Station, passengers are arriving for the two-day trip to Churchill.\n\n[man] All right, so it's on your left.\n\nDo you need a hand with your bags?\n\n-[woman] I think I'm good.\n\n-Just on your left.\n\nAndrew Paterson has three years' experience driving on the route.\n\nThere's a lot of planning involved and a lot of quick decision-making skills that are required as well, so it's, yes, technically pushing buttons, pulling levers, but there's a lot of forethought to it as well.\n\nAll aboard!\n\nThe weather is the biggest thing, when you get into the really cold months through minus 40s and wind chills into the minus 50 temperatures.\n\n[bell clanging in distance] At exactly 12.05, the train eases out of Winnipeg Station.\n\nAt this time of year, Andrew's biggest challenge is the state of the rails themselves.\n\n[Andrew] The roadbed's never really solid.\n\nIt does float quite a bit up north, so you have challenges with a lot of frost heaves in the winter months.\n\nSevere winter frosts can shift the track, making it uneven, and further north, the ground can be swampy whenever the weather turns warmer.\n\nToday, the weather en route is forecast to be minus 29, blistering cold.\n\n[train whistle blares] On behalf of your service manager in VIA Rail Canada, it's our pleasure to welcome you on board train number 693, en route to Churchill.\n\nIt's more than 1,600 kilometers to Churchill on the Hudson Bay.\n\nAlong the route are 71 stations.\n\nPassengers can also arrange to be picked up between stations in remote areas, flashing their headlights, or simply waving at the slow-moving train as a signal for the driver to stop.\n\nThe first leg of the journey travels across ice-covered flatlands, once grasslands home to vast herds of bison.\n\nIn the early 19th century, European immigrant farmers discovered that wheat could be grown here.\n\nThe bison were slaughtered and the grasslands became Manitoba's prairies.\n\nWithin two months, this area will transform into fields of grain, a crucial lynchpin in the Canadian economy.\n\nThe railroad to Churchill started construction in the early 1900s, after a long campaign by crop farmers who wanted a quicker route to export their grain to Europe.\n\nIt took nearly 30 years to complete.\n\nFrom the prairies, the train weaves north to one of the most beautiful parts of the province, Lake Manitoba.\n\nIt's one of the world's largest freshwater lakes.\n\n[uplifting music] Among the coaches is a panoramic car, with opportunities for great views.\n\nBut the twice-weekly train is not primarily for tourists, certainly not at the height of winter.\n\nSo I'm, like, a Masters student.\n\nI'm doing my research at the Churchill Marine Observatory.\n\nI'm focusing on detecting oil and diesel fuel under sea ice, so my research is gonna help with reducing the impacts of a diesel spill or an oil spill.\n\nLeah's professor, Dustin Isleifson, is leading the research in Churchill.\n\nIt's a bit of a slower trip than you'd take from a flight, but you get to see the terrain.\n\nYou actually get to see Manitoba and the land all around you.\n\nThe train is travelling slowly.\n\nEven though the locomotives are powerful, their speed rarely exceeds 50km an hour in the north, because of potential problems on the track.\n\nIt's so cold that the metal rails contract, and ice beneath the tracks can make them uneven.\n\nThe further north the railroad, the greater the need for constant inspection and repairs.\n\nMaintenance crews drive specially adapted trucks able to travel on road or rail.\n\nSmall, flanged wheels can be lowered onto the rails.\n\nIt makes it possible to inspect the tracks even in the remotest areas up north, where there are no roads.\n\n[loud clattering] It's a tough... ...tough territory we work in.\n\nToday, roadmaster Dustin Head is inspecting the track for damage caused by severe winter weather.\n\nThe extreme cold is especially challenging, but in the spring too, the thaw can make the track unstable.\n\nHe uses a sensor array attached to the front of the truck, linked to a computer inside the cab, to spot problems in real time.\n\nIt looks like we are just going through a cross level splotch here right now.\n\nIt just showed up.\n\nCross level means uneven rails.\n\nOne side of the rail is lower than the other, and that's not good for the train.\n\n[grunts softly] Right now, our east rail is... [sighs] [whistles softly] ...two and a quarter inch lower than the west rail.\n\nIf we were to leave this, this is gonna grow to an even bigger defect.\n\nThe east rail will get lower, it will continue to sink, and we'll have a chance for a derailment of a train, so we cannot let this sit any longer.\n\nWe will have to fix this immediately.\n\n[sighs] Good evening.\n\nWe've got a defect we need lifted urgently.\n\nWe've got a southbound passenger train and a way freight coming this evening, So can we get you guys here as soon as possible?\n\nOver.\n\n[man] As the supervisor just said, we'll be on our way there to respond.\n\nDusk comes early at this time of the year, and as the sky turns from gold to dark blue, VIA Rail 693 will make a stop before the night falls for a crew change.\n\nRyan Allman is the driver taking the train into the night.\n\nThere's always inherent challenges, uh, but you've gotta understand, the headlights on these things are about as bright as the sun, so our vision is actually surprisingly pretty good.\n\nWe can see down the track for a good extended distance.\n\n[pensive music] As the train leaves the station heading north, the temperature during the night is predicted to drop to minus 30 with heavy snow.\n\nSnowdrifts could cover the line and even make it impassable.\n\nIn the winter time there's safety concerns out here, especially when it's 50 below.\n\nDefinitely could be challenging.\n\nAnd as you see here, you can't even see the track.\n\nYou don't even know where it is, so we've gotta make our own trail, and hopefully not get stuck doing it.\n\n[train clattering on tracks] Manitoba reaches right up to the Arctic, and the railway serves the many small First Nations communities along the line.\n\nThe Pas, one third of the way between Winnipeg and Churchill, is where freight trains begin their journey, taking goods up north.\n\nFrom here, right up to Churchill, both freight train and passenger train use the same track.\n\nThe wagons today are carrying fuel, food, and construction materials for the communities en route, and jet fuel for the airport at Churchill.\n\n[man] That'll do.\n\nBecause the goods are vital and the journey remote, nothing is left to chance.\n\nBefore hauling a train, locomotives are thoroughly checked over here in the maintenance shop of the Hudson Bay Railway.\n\nThe company is majority owned by the First Nations communities of Northern Manitoba.\n\nKeeping the trains moving is the responsibility of mechanical supervisor Jason Lord and his team.\n\nEspecially in the winter months when everything's cold, that's when the metal and steel start to break apart more.\n\nExtreme cold temperatures increase the wear on wheels.\n\nIf they're worn or chipped, they can cause major damage to the track.\n\nThe team has discovered a serious fault on one of the locomotives' wheels.\n\n[Jason] We're doing a wheel change up.\n\nIt had a couple of shells in it so we have to take that out, or we could potentially crack the wheel, even worse, or have a derailment.\n\nIt could happen.\n\nIt's possible.\n\nA shell is a dent in the metal.\n\nThe wheel that's damaged is attached to the drive motor, so to change the wheel, they're going to have to change the whole motor assembly.\n\nThe guys are, right now, just dropping out the motor.\n\nWe've got one built in the traction motor room that we're gonna be installing too this morning.\n\n-[mechanic] Sparky going in.\n\n-Sparky going in.\n\n[clanking] [drilling] They need to check that the replacement wheel and motor assembly is perfectly aligned and secure.\n\n[tools clattering and clanging] We're just tying up a couple of loose ends on this wheel, and it'll be ready for back in service.\n\n[mechanic] Up a hair.\n\n[cranking] With new drive wheels, the locomotive is cleared for the journey north.\n\nMike Olymer will be its driver on the first leg, about a third of the way to Churchill.\n\nHe's 75 years old, and has been working on railroads for 57 years.\n\n[Mike] I have to retire sometime, and hate the thought of retiring.\n\nIt's just because it's such an interesting job.\n\nI mean, 75 is a long time to be running engines.\n\nMike's years of experience mean he has the advantage of knowing how to deal with the very worst of winter conditions.\n\n[bell dings] I've been in situations where the weather's been as cold as minus 45, and instead of being just snow, it becomes like sand or gravel.\n\nIt resists you rolling over it with great, you know...\n\nIt resists tremendously.\n\nThat's a big part of why it's so difficult operating trains here.\n\nWith the remoteness of much of the journey, the company takes special precautions to keep the train running, no matter what.\n\nWe always have two engines, because if one breaks down, you've got the other to get to where you're going.\n\nVery seldom both will break down at the same time.\n\nVery seldom.\n\nAre we ready to go, guys?\n\nIt's getting cold out here.\n\nLoaded and ready to leave, there's suddenly a problem.\n\nWe've got an issue with the engine, with that breaker kicking all the time.\n\nWe also have an issue with the SVU or the tail-end brake not braking properly, or not working properly.\n\n[indistinct radio transmission] The emergency brake on a wagon near the back of a train has failed.\n\nThe wagon won't move.\n\n[indistinct radio transmission] [Mike] He's working on the tail end.\n\nHe says something's not setting up properly back there.\n\nFixing the wagon is taking too long.\n\nMark Graham, the train's conductor, and driver Mike eventually decide to leave it behind.\n\n[clanking] After a stalled start, the train is at last moving.\n\nOn our way to Thompson now.\n\nJust sorted out all the problems and we're on our way now.\n\nWith the delay, they're trying to make up time.\n\nCrew working hours are capped at a maximum of 12 hours on duty.\n\nThey want to get to Thompson, where a relief crew will be waiting, before their hours run out.\n\nTo stay on schedule, they must ensure they have two hours still on the clock when they pass through the interim station of Wabowden.\n\n[train whistle blares] We gotta make it to our terminal in Wabowden under ten hours, or we cannot go anymore, so we've got an hour to play with, really.\n\nSo, uh, it puts a lot of pressure on us.\n\n[indistinct radio transmission] [train clattering on tracks] As the freight train moves north, the train's conductor, Mark, knows the challenges of running a train in freezing conditions.\n\nThe more northerly the line, the colder it gets.\n\n[Mark] In the winter time, there are safety concerns.\n\nespecially when it's 50 below.\n\nDefinitely can be challenging.\n\nAnd as you see here, you can't even see the track.\n\nYou don't even know where it is, right?\n\nWe're ploughing the track as we go.\n\nThey have maintenance and the equipment to do it, but because it had snowed last night, they're not here yet, so we've gotta make our own trail.\n\nMark's fear is getting stuck in snowdrifts that build up on the rails.\n\nIt's man and machine against nature in the north, and to keep things safe in this extreme environment, every 95 kilometers they stop the train to inspect it, making sure there's no damage to wheels or bearings, and that no brakes are locked up.\n\nWe're gonna set the brakes on the train, come to a stop.\n\nWe're just gonna get off and then pull the train by, and inspect one side of it, visually inspect it by sight, because he's experienced and knows what he's looking for.\n\nHe's looking for smoking brakes, sticking brakes, or bearings that are burnt off.\n\n[man] I'm off.\n\nSee, we're nine miles an hour right now.\n\nYou're off.\n\nDone.\n\n[train whistle blares] I like to blow the whistle, ring the bell.\n\nWhenever this engine moves, I always do that.\n\nI am backing up the train so he can inspect the bearings and all the equipment that may have fallen down on t his train.\n\nIf there was a handbrake on here, you would more or less hear it squealing, really loud squeal.\n\nBrakes would be steaming, they would be blue.\n\nSame thing if a piston was stuck out that didn't release when you released the brakes.\n\nThere'd be a loud squealing as well.\n\nMike, everything looks great.\n\n-[Mike] Let's go!\n\n-[chuckles] -Come ahead and get us now.\n\n-[Mike] OK. Looks good.\n\nHe never said anything about any problems.\n\nHe'll tell us that as soon as he enters the train, or the engine.\n\n-We're good to go.\n\n-There you go.\n\nAway we go, guys.\n\n[pensive music] Back underway, time is tight, but there's optimism in the cab.\n\nThey're determined to reach the station at Wabowden in time to be allowed to continue through to Thompson.\n\n[Mark] It's gonna be very close.\n\nFive minutes, if lucky.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's...\n\nIt's...\n\nIt's a little close for my likings, but we're gonna do it, we'll make it.\n\n[dramatic music] In a race against the clock, the crew push the locomotive, keeping the train right at the speed limit.\n\n[Mike] OK. Tail end is inside the...\n\nRight now, we're all clear of the [indistinct].\n\n[air pressure releasing] We have six minutes left, guys.\n\nSix minutes.\n\nHaving made it to Wabowden just in time, they're allowed to push on to Thompson.\n\nMike's long experience has helped bring the train in safely and on time.\n\n[Mike] You've gotta know your track.\n\nHalf of being a good locomotive engineer is knowing your track.\n\nThe other half is skills from the team you work over the years with.\n\nBut half of it is, you've gotta know your track.\n\n-Good trip.\n\n-See you guys.\n\n-Good trip, Mark.\n\nSee you soon.\n\n-Yeah!\n\n-See you next time round, bud.\n\n-You bet.\n\nAfter a break during the night, tomorrow the freight train will continue north.\n\nBut there's a problem on the track ahead, and with other trains due to pass, the maintenance crew, working in extreme conditions, is under pressure.\n\n[Dustin] We have a south-bound train leaving, so it's imperative we get this fixed this evening.\n\nIn Northern Canada, the VIA Rail passenger train is heading through Manitoba, towards the Arctic Circle.\n\n-Good morning.\n\n-Morning.\n\n-How are you?\n\n-I'm great.\n\n-How did you sleep last night?\n\n-Very well.\n\nAs morning breaks, from above it's clear the terrain has changed dramatically.\n\nThe train has entered Manitoba's Boreal Forest.\n\nThe trees here are pine, spruce and birch.\n\nThe area's home to caribou reindeer.\n\nAmong the train's passengers is Heather Botelho.\n\nShe's on a big adventure.\n\nHer plan is to get off at Thompson, collect the snowmobile she's shipped on the train, and then drive it the 300km north to Churchill.\n\n[Heather] I'm expecting it to be not easy, and that's OK. And it's, uh, gonna be quite warm.\n\nWith warm weather in Churchill around this time of year, usually means blizzards.\n\nSo, it's kind of on the back of my mind.\n\nHeather's idea of warm weather is minus 18.\n\nA lifelong resident of Churchill, and a member of the Cree Nation, she knows what the VIA passenger train means to her people.\n\nThe most important thing is its affordability for people to come and go, and, uh... We have a lot of local people who, who need that line.\n\nAnd not for the big adventure that many of us go on, but to go see family down the line, to go grocery shop in Thompson, to go seek medical services.\n\nSo, yeah, it's a big deal.\n\nIt's huge.\n\n[pensive music] Further up the line, roadmaster Dustin Head and his crew urgently need to fix the track.\n\nThe rail on one side has sunk.\n\nIt's dangerously lower than the other rail.\n\nOK, it's imperative we get this section of track fixed.\n\nWe've got southbound trains leaving Churchill this evening, and a way freight coming this evening.\n\n[engineer] Let's get at it.\n\nThe land around here is swampy and unstable.\n\nAs temperatures rise and fall, so does the ground below the rails.\n\n[Shane] This part of track is always consistently shifting, and with the conditions we have up here, it's so tough to build a railway.\n\n[grunting] We just need the ties to lift, and if they do, we can just add the tap.\n\nIf not, we're gonna have to pull spikes, shim it, so we're hoping for the best.\n\nThe crew is using a jack to lift the rail, trying to level up the two sides.\n\nThe plan is to support it with stone ballast.\n\nThere, she's coming up now.\n\nThey call 72-year-old John Spence the \"track whisperer.\"\n\nMove that up, move that jack ten ties that way.\n\nWith more than 35 years of experience, he can pinpoint precisely where the track needs to be lifted.\n\nRight here, there's a bubble right in the center.\n\nIt's level right here.\n\nJohn uses a wooden board with a bubble in a glass tube on top as a spirit level.\n\nIt's not easy to lift such a massive section of continuous rail.\n\nBrute force is an essential tool.\n\n-Half a bubble.\n\n-Half a bubble?\n\nReady?\n\n[grunting] That's good?\n\n[indistinct] OK, now we've got this defect lifted, the track is now open for the train to proceed.\n\nWe're good to go.\n\nA day after leaving Winnipeg, VIA Rail 693 is approaching the halfway point of its journey.\n\nThe next major stop is Thompson.\n\nOn board, Ron Estler, from the US, is looking forward to getting to Churchill.\n\nHe's returning after a memorable trip as a young man.\n\nForty-seven years ago, right now, I was a 25-year-old third-year graduate student at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\nAnd my research director had a rocket experiment measuring electrons in the aurora, and he asked me to come to Churchill to oversee the experiment.\n\nUm, it was a life-changing experience for me and I always told myself I'd come back someday, and 47 years, I'm fulfilling that dream!\n\nI just love trains, and...\n\nThis is a unique experience on this train.\n\nI mean, to be here for 48 hours or so, travelling from Winnipeg to Churchill on something that's very unique.\n\nWho doesn't wanna do that?\n\nThe train's travelling through territory settled for around 15,000 years by the Assiniboine, Dakota, Cree and Dene peoples.\n\nThe next stop is at the heart of their lands.\n\n[conductor] Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nMay I have your attention, please?\n\nWe'll be arriving into Thompson station.\n\nFor your safety, please remain in your seat and/or your cabin until the train comes to a complete stop in the terminal.\n\nOK for doors.\n\n[rattling] Thompson is home to the second-largest nickel deposit in the world.\n\nAfter this discovery, a mine was built, bringing prosperity to the area, and increasing opportunities for employment.\n\nToday, it's a growing town, and with a hospital and shopping mall, it's a key destination for many of the First Nations people living in small villages around here.\n\n[Andrew] Yeah, loud and clear.\n\nBefore it leaves the station, locomotive driver Andrew Paterson carries out a safety check on the train.\n\nUp north, there's often a thin layer of ice on the rails.\n\nTo avoid slipping, drivers apply their brakes to heat the wheels and melt the ice.\n\nBut this can sometimes cause wheel bearings to overheat and seize up, so he pays careful attention to wheels and bearings.\n\nI'm making sure the air hoses are done up, that we don't have any air leaks for our braking system.\n\nI'm also checking the bearing temperatures.\n\nThe gauge that I have is actually a heat gun, and we use this to monitor bearing temperatures.\n\nThis'll give us an indication if our bearing temperatures are warmer than usual, and they're within tolerance.\n\nAndrew's family has a long tradition of working on the railroad.\n\nMy father worked for VIA Rail, and then my grandfather, he worked for one of the freight railways, and his, my great, great grandfather also worked for one of the freight railways out of Winnipeg.\n\nFor me, personally, growing up with my father, I was around trains my whole life, having the ability to ride on the trains and see them and experience them and, kind of, got hooked on them.\n\nAnd for me to pursue that as a career afterwards was an absolute dream come true.\n\nWith passengers boarding, refueling complete, and all pre-departure checks completed, the train can get underway.\n\nAll aboard!\n\nFor the next 12 hours, the train will battle through the night, heading towards a section of rail where major flooding destroyed the tracks, severing the route to Churchill.\n\nPicture about 100 feet of rail hanging in the air eight feet... ...in 13 different locations.\n\n[exhilarating music] In Thompson, Northern Manitoba, a relief crew is taking over.\n\nEngineer Bruce McMaster will be in the driving seat.\n\nGotta check to make sure all those pins are in place and check these wheels.\n\nWith no road access in much of the region north of Thompson, the freight train is a vital lifeline, delivering goods to isolated communities and businesses along the route.\n\nToday's essentials include a weekly delivery of food for Churchill.\n\nAnd crews have loaded a large snowblower and an excavator, each to be dropped off at different places up the line.\n\nJoining Bruce on his trip are Roy Spence and apprentice driver Josh, Bruce's son.\n\nHe's been on the job for only three months.\n\n[Josh] It's good.\n\nIt's awesome.\n\nI love working under my dad.\n\nYou know, and him showing me the ropes around here.\n\nYeah, it's a good step forward for him.\n\nFuture in it.\n\nI wanna be like my dad, you know.\n\nLike, I guess, like, that's all I could say.\n\nAnd it's a career, too.\n\nIt's not just a job.\n\nTo become a fully-qualified driver like his father, Josh will have to work as a conductor for two years, then complete driver training for up to two further years.\n\nOK, thanks.\n\nWe'll talk to you later.\n\n2605 out.\n\n[dramatic music] [train clattering on tracks] Three hours out of Thompson, close to where the snow blower is to be dropped, the freight train makes its first crossing of the magnificent Nelson River at Manitou Rapids.\n\nIn summer, the rapids flowing under the bridge are immensely dangerous.\n\n[Roy] It's approximately about 90 feet down to the river.\n\nThe river probably travels at about 27 knots an hour, so it moves pretty quick, and generates a lot of hydroelectricity.\n\nThe Nelson River powers the nearby Manitoba Hydro Plant, an important source of hydroelectricity for the large nickel mines north of Thompson.\n\n[dramatic music] A few kilometers past the bridge, the train stops to deliver the snow blower.\n\n[Roy] You can pretty much order anything and have it dropped off somewhere.\n\nJust gotta have the proper paperwork and proper billing.\n\n[operator] 2605, you can take him ahead a couple of feet.\n\n[pensive music] From above, the delivery looks well-practiced.\n\nThe loco and the flatbed carrying the snow blower are separated from the rest of the train.\n\nThen, conductor Roy Spence switches the points so that Bruce can shunt the snow blower onto a siderail.\n\nOK, we're going northward now.\n\n[pensive music] Yeah, they've got an airstrip in there.\n\nManitoba Hydro has an airstrip where they fly employees in and out.\n\nThere's probably a snow blower to clean the airstrip off.\n\nOnce the flatbed carrying the snow blower is unhooked, Bruce returns to the main track.\n\nThe locomotives are re-joined to the rest of the load, and the journey continues.\n\n[dramatic music] The crew drive on into the dusk.\n\nAt nightfall, they pull into Gillam.\n\nAfter a 12-hour, 200-kilometer journey from Thompson, it's time for the crew to take an overnight break.\n\n[tranquil music] [wind gusting] The next morning, Bruce, Roy and Josh are back underway.\n\nFrom Gillam, there are no roads at all going north.\n\nThe railway is the only land connection to Churchill, 250 kilometers away.\n\nHere, it's essential the train doesn't run into trouble.\n\nIf a breakdown occurs, getting help to the crew is difficult.\n\nNorth of Gillam, the landscape changes.\n\nThe train enters the barren lands, stark and desolate.\n\nThis is what's called tundra, where only stunted trees grow, and the subsoil is frozen all year round.\n\nWith global warming, extreme weather events are happening more frequently.\n\nIn 2017, it was in this area that a natural catastrophe severed the tracks.\n\n[Roy] We had a big snowfall that winter and, uh, there was one snowbank was 11 feet high.\n\nAnd when the snow melted, all the water, it just formed on the track, and washed it out in different places.\n\n[foreboding music] Picture about 100 feet of rail hanging in the air eight feet... ...in 13 different locations.\n\nThe water couldn't get to the culverts, and the one thing about water, it'll find the weak areas, and if they're not going through the culverts, they're going through the track, and that washed them out.\n\nWith no road access, repairing the track was tough.\n\nA freight train had to make repeated 80-kilometer trips to bring in materials and earthmoving equipment.\n\nChurchill was cut off for months.\n\nTheir lifeline is their railway.\n\nAll their groceries come up at a reasonable cost.\n\nThey flew 'em in, but, like, the prices were outrageous.\n\nAnd, uh, just not having a train or being able to get out, it was really stressful for the people of Churchill, for sure.\n\nTo repair the line, engineers came up with a pioneering solution, a webbed material with the individual cells that they filled with sand.\n\nIt made a base for the track that wouldn't be easily washed away in future floods.\n\nThe line was reopened after a year and a half.\n\n[dramatic music] The freight train passes safely over the repaired track, but there's no chance for complacency.\n\nThe maintenance team has spotted another problem up ahead.\n\nTo fix it will require urgent and extreme measures.\n\nLooks like a potential pull-apart here.\n\nWe've got our bolts are starting to bend.\n\nI think we'll probably have to deal with it today before it gets any wider.\n\nThis is gonna end up stopping trains if we don't get it done.\n\n[dramatic music] [pensive music] For the VIA Rail passenger train, it's the final stage of its journey.\n\nOvernight, there's been a heavy snowfall.\n\nSnowplow driver Charles Godwin has the responsibility for keeping the track clear.\n\n[Charles] Right now, I'm uh, widening up the next track, getting the snow off here.\n\nJust keeping it clear, really.\n\nThe snow piles up too much and makes it hard for trains to get through.\n\nWe wanna prevent snowdrifts from happening.\n\nThe machine Charles is driving is called \"The Snowfighter.\"\n\nI travel from Gillam, which is mile 326, to Churchill, mile 510.\n\nI do that in a day.\n\nThe 12-meter-long machine is specially designed to deal with heavy snow.\n\nWith its extended wings, it can push snow more than four-and-a-half meters from the track's center.\n\nIt's a brute of a plow, powered by a 260-horsepower engine.\n\nKeeping the track clear for trains, high rails, um, to these remote communities that really rely on, uh... the train for freight, passenger services to these remote communities, I think it's very important.\n\nSnowdrifts happen, snow piles up.\n\nYou've gotta keep the tracks clear.\n\nIf it doesn't, you're delaying people that are really relying on, uh, things to get delivered to them.\n\nThe track ahead of the VIA Rail passenger train is now clear and it can pick up speed.\n\nBut today, the VIA Rail train is making an unscheduled stop.\n\nA group of wildlife photographers have arranged to be picked up beside the line, nowhere near a station.\n\nSo, that lodge is way out there somewhere.\n\nWith trains travelling at no more than 15 kilometers per hour in these remote areas, it's easy for the drivers to spot people waiting by the track, and stop in time.\n\nI can pass that up to you.\n\nYou go all the way to the top and I'll get... You got it?\n\nThe group have spent a week based in a remote lodge, photographing polar bears close to their dens.\n\nThen I'll come and look at your tickets once you get on board.\n\nAfter they board, the train resumes its journey to Churchill.\n\nAhead, roadmaster Dustin Head has been called to a problem on the track his crew's discovered.\n\nGood day, gentlemen.\n\nWhat do we have here?\n\nOh, looks like a potential pull-apart here.\n\nWe've got our bolts are starting to bend.\n\nWe'll probably have to deal with it today and then, before it gets any wider.\n\nThis is gonna end up stopping trains if we don't get it done.\n\nOK, well, we'll do that and we'll back these trucks up, go about nine feet back and we'll light both sides on fire.\n\nRight, OK, sounds like a good plan.\n\nOK, John...\n\nWhen two adjacent rails contract in extreme cold, they can separate from one another.\n\nIt's called a pull-apart.\n\nIf it causes the bolts on the plate holding the rails together to bend and fracture, it could result in a derailment.\n\n[Dustin] Luckily, we've caught this in time where we could bring the joint back together with some fire and bring it together.\n\nNow what we're gonna do is we're gonna lay our sawdust and our igniter down, all along the rails.\n\nHeat 'em up so that they expand, pulls that, this gap here.\n\nPulls that together enough so that we can get a new bolt in and we should be good to go from there.\n\n[Dustin] It's brutally cold, Mother Nature's not on our side, so let's get it together.\n\nDustin Head's crew is fixing a potentially dangerous gap in the tracks.\n\nThey plan to use intense heat to expand the rails.\n\nOK. Fire in the hole, guys!\n\nStand all clear!\n\n[pensive music] [flames crackling] [music intensifies] Oh, yeah.\n\nYeah, perfect.\n\nShe lined up nice.\n\nBolts are going in the way they should.\n\nThey slide right in, like that.\n\nWith the gap closed, and new bolts holding the rails in place, the crew reopen the line.\n\nTrains can proceed safely.\n\n[train carriages rattling] The freight train's on its final run into the depot at Churchill.\n\nIt's been a long shift for driver Bruce, his son, Josh, and conductor Roy Spence.\n\nWe'll get to Churchill around 2.30 in the afternoon, and that gives them half of daylight time to unload the material that they have to unload, the trailers of food.\n\nAnd then, uh, we'll stay there overnight, then the next day they've got enough daylight and time to load everything up so we can bring our train back.\n\n[pensive music] The crew still have a couple of hours of work to do.\n\nWagons need to be unhooked and shunted to where they can be unloaded.\n\nAfter they drop a final container, they can call it a day.\n\nVIA Rail 693 is just an hour out of Churchill.\n\nSo, we get to Churchill at nine, and then what's the game plan?\n\nWe'll drive to the Churchill Marine Observatory.\n\n-Take a look around.\n\n-Nice.\n\nI'm excited.\n\n-See it for the first time.\n\n-I'm excited for that.\n\nFrom above, it's clear just how different the small town of Churchill is from the train's starting point in Winnipeg.\n\nChurchill sits on the edge of Hudson Bay.\n\nIts port is a northern gateway to Europe.\n\nEarly settlers came for the fur trade.\n\nLater, the railway was built to ship grain.\n\nToday, the economy is built around tourism and it's been called the polar bear capital of the world.\n\n[woman] Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please?\n\nWe will be arriving into Churchill.\n\nFor your safety, please stay clear of the vestibule doors until the train comes to a complete... As he nears his final destination, Ron Estler reflects on his visit to Churchill almost a half a century ago.\n\nOnce my wife learned that I had spent time up here, we always wanted to go back and see the Northern Lights.\n\nI tell people it's the closest thing that I've had to a religious experience.\n\nAs the train reverses into the station, it's the end of a two-day journey covering almost 1,700 kilometers.\n\nChurchill is home to a First Nations community.\n\n-[woman] Woo-hoo!\n\n-[man] Thanks for a great trip.\n\nYes, thank you so much!\n\n[conductor] Enjoy your stay.\n\nOnce they disembark, university of Manitoba researchers Leah and Dustin waste no time in starting their research.\n\n[man] Welcome to the Churchill Marine Observatory.\n\nAt this time of year, many of the tourists have come to see the Northern Lights.\n\nIt's one of the best places in the world to witness the aurora borealis, and tonight, Churchill doesn't let its residents, or its tourists, down.\n\n[tranquil music] Tomorrow, the train will be returning to Winnipeg, back through the barren lands, the Boreal Forest, the frozen lakes and prairies.\n\nTogether with the frontier spirit of the crews who keep this wilderness railroad open, the changing landscape is what makes the VIA Rail one of the greatest Epic Train Journeys From Above."
