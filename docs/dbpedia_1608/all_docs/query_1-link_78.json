        "text": "The Class 810 Aurora trains are being built by global rail solutions provider, Hitachi Rail, in County Durham, UK, for East Midlands Railway (EMR), a train operating company based in England. The new Aurora trains will be delivered to EMR’s Etches Park depot in Derby.\n\nThe trains will primarily serve the Midland Main Line, connecting major cities and towns such as Sheffield, Chesterfield, Nottingham, Derby, Leicester, and Lincoln, in addition to Kettering and London St Pancras.\n\nEMR introduced the concept of the Aurora intercity fleet in October 2020, aiming to replace the existing EMR intercity fleet, which is currently limited to diesel engine operation.\n\nThe introduction of the Aurora trains, named after the Roman goddess of the dawn, symbolises a fresh start for the East Midlands and South Yorkshire regions.\n\nThe name also draws inspiration from the Northern Lights, which are a result of solar energy transferred from the sun.\n\nThe Aurora trains are scheduled to enter operations in early 2025. The entire fleet is expected to be in service during the same year.\n\nThe fleet will not only modernise the rail services along the Midland Main Line but also contribute to the broader goals of enhancing public transport and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nAurora intercity trains design and features\n\nThe Class 810 series is based on bullet train technology and consists of five-carriage units that offer 45 first-class seats and 270 standard-class seats.\n\nThe trains will be equipped with LEAN seats from Fabbrica Italiana Sedili Autoferroviari (FISA), which have been reworked by DGDESIGN to enhance comfort and support.\n\nThe improvements include enlarged cushions, headrests, and armrests, and the use of high-quality, durable materials such as wool-rich moquette and leather to match the expectations associated with intercity service.\n\nThe Aurora fleet’s flooring is specifically engineered to be easy to clean, durable enough to withstand high passenger traffic, and simple to maintain.\n\nThe tables onboard are constructed to comply with the latest rail safety standards, making them among the safest in the world. The tables feature a new generation of soft close hinge systems that enable them to be folded down in a controlled manner.\n\nAdditionally, first-class passengers will have the luxury of Italian-made real wood laminate tables.\n\nLED lighting is used throughout the train, providing a bright and energy-efficient environment.\n\nTechnical specifications of Aurora trains\n\nThe Class 801 car body is constructed from double-skinned aluminium and are built for both strength and lightweight performance. The full-width cab and bolster-less bogies are engineered to support the train’s high-speed capabilities.\n\nThe cars have a maximum operating speed of 201km/h and with the potential to reach a design speed of 225km/h and have a maximum acceleration of 0.75m/s². The trains’ nominal vehicle length will range between 24m to 26m.\n\nAurora trains will operate on a bi-modal power supply, with the flexibility to utilise either 25kVAC or a diesel engine generator.\n\nThe door configuration consists of sliding pocket vehicle/end doors, optimised for passenger flow and safety. The braking system is an electrically actuated pneumatic type, and the standard gauge of 1,435mm is utilised.\n\nSafety features\n\nThe trains are equipped with a train protection and warning system (TPWS), which supports the driver by providing crucial signal status information and activating the train’s emergency brakes if a restricted signal is passed.\n\nThe automatic power control (APC) safety system is another critical component that prevents the train from drawing power in neutral sections of the overhead line, thereby averting potential electrical arcing.\n\nFacilities available at Aurora trains\n\nThe Aurora trains include air conditioning and complimentary Wi-Fi access throughout the train, enhanced mobile phone signal reception, ample luggage space, and electrical plug sockets. The passenger information screens will also be upgraded for better communication.\n\nThe trains will feature power and USB points, spacious legroom, coat hooks, and seat-back tables suitable for all airline seats. Each seat will also provide space for a cabin-sized bag underneath, ensuring convenience for travellers.\n\nCatering services will see an improvement, with a more consistent seven-day offering available in both first and standard-class compartments.\n\nSustainability features\n\nThe new intercity bi-mode trains are designed to be quieter and more environmentally friendly, contributing to lower carbon emissions and a more pleasant experience for passengers, as well as residents in the vicinity of the stations and along the route.\n\nThe trains are equipped to operate on electric overhead lines wherever available, leveraging the £1.5bn ($2bn) investment in the Midland Main Line upgrade.\n\nWhen operating in diesel mode, the trains are expected to reduce harmful emissions, specifically particulate matter, by up to 90% compared to the legacy high-speed trains.\n\nFunding\n\nThe project achieved financial closure in August 2019, with secured funding from Rock Rail and Japan Infrastructure Initiative amounting to £400m. The fleet will be financed through Rock Rail, a rolling stock company based in the UK, and leased to Abellio for the franchise’s lifespan.\n\nHitachi Rail’s UK factory will see a £110m investment to introduce new painting and welding facilities.\n\nAviva Investors, the global asset management business of Aviva, played a pivotal role in the financing by providing senior debt in a $486m deal towards the new train fleet for Abellio UK’s EMR franchise. Aviva Investors emerged as the principal funder within the consortium of investors.\n\nContractors involved\n\nA Derby-based agency, DGDESIGN, is responsible for creating the interiors of the Aurora fleet.\n\nThe folding tables onboard were manufactured by Puricelli, an Italian designer and sustainable surface manufacturer.\n\nFISA, an Italian company providing seats and interiors for railways, supplied lean seats for the Aurora intercity fleet.\n\nBaker Bellfield, a company based in Telford, secured the contract to supply a variety of tables for the Aurora fleet, integrating into Hitachi Rail’s UK supply chain.\n\nStauff, renowned for its hydraulic system components, is supplying essential products for the Aurora Fleet, including specialist clamping solutions and flexible hose assemblies.\n\nMors Smitt, a manufacturer based in Burton upon Trent, will provide AWS, TPWS, and APC systems for the trains.\n\nForbo Flooring Systems, a global entity known for its commercial floor coverings, has been selected to supply flooring parts for the Aurora fleet, contributing to the overall design and functionality of the trains.\n\nEMR signed a contract in July 2019 with Abellio, a Dutch public transport company, for the supply of 33 five-carriage trains. The company subsequently contracted Hitachi Rail to build the new fleet."
