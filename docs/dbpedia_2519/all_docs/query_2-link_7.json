        "text": "Call Me MaybeCarly Rae Jepsen\n\n\"Call Me Maybe\" by Carly Rae Jepsen was the song of the summer in 2012 and a major meme. It got some help from her fellow Canadian Justin Bieber, who tweeted that it was \"possibly the catchiest song I've ever heard.\"\n\nWork From HomeFifth Harmony\n\nFifth Harmony was going to call their song \"Work,\" but they changed it to \"Work from Home\" when Rihanna released a song with that title.\n\nHotel CaliforniaEagles\n\nMany people believe \"Hotel California\" is about a mental institution called the Camarillo, but the Eagles say it's about materialism and excess.\n\nCherry BombJohn Mellencamp\n\nThe line in John Mellencamp's \"Cherry Bomb\" that sounds like \"that's when a smoke was a smoke\" is actually \"that's when a sport was a sport,\" according to the published lyric. In that sense, \"sport\" is an endearment for someone of good nature.\n\nFallin'Alicia Keys\n\nAlicia Keys got a huge break when Oprah had her perform her debut single \"Fallin'\" on her show.\n\nLajon Witherspoon of SevendustSongwriter Interviews\n\nThe Sevendust frontman talks about the group's songwriting process, and how trips to the Murder Bar helped forge their latest album.\n\nJustin Hayward of The Moody BluesSongwriter Interviews\n\nJustin wrote the classic \"Nights In White Satin,\" but his fondest musical memories are from a different decade.\n\nSong CitiesMusic Quiz\n\nNirvana, Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen are among those who wrote songs with cities that show up in this quiz."
