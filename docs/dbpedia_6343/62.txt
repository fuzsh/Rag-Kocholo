This is an original one-sheet movie poster from 1947 for The Two Mrs. Carrolls starring Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck, Alexis Smith, Nigel Bruce, Isobel Elsom, Patrick O'Moore and Ann Carter. Peter Godfrey directed the classic film.

This rare and collectible movie poster, printed in 1947 for the theatrical release of The Two Mrs. Carrolls, is not a reprint or reproduction.

The Style A poster measures 27” x 41” and is in good to very good condition. It was folded at the time of printing. Most folds flatten out nicely for framing and are often desirable for vintage, collectible movie posters. There are a few pinholes around the edges and there is a small tear in the lower left edge. The poster was once folded an extra time resulting in a light vertical foldline at left and right. There is a small patch of slight discoloration near the studio logo at lower left. The poster is a perfect candidate for linen-backing but already displays well.

Please look closely at the photo (this is the exact poster you are buying). The small, black squares in the corners of the poster are magnets and not pins.
