        "text": "It may have been reasons of commerce which prompted the Warners to withhold \"The Two Mrs. Carrolls\" from circulation for almost two years after it was made. But we have a sneaky suspicion that the Brothers had to work up their nerve to risk this incredible monstrosity upon even the most tolerant movie fans. For there's no wriggling out of the obvious; this murder mulligan, which came to the Hollywood on Saturday, is as wretched a stew of picture-making as has been dished up in many a moon.Most conspicuous of its embarrassments is the performance which Humphrey Bogart gives as a homicidal artist with particular designs upon his wives. As a psychopathic dauber who paints his successive fraus as the \"Angel of Death\" and then slips them poison when he feels their inspiration has run dry, Mr. Bogart behaves in the ponderous fashion of a deadpanned American thug whose mother was horribly frightened by a robot built by Dr. Frankenstein. And in his final assault upon Barbara Stanwyck, his horrified second wife, he goes through the whole repertory of a low-budget bogey-man. Such crude and mechanical melodramatics by Mr. Bogart, who does occasionally act, are the chief and most striking evidence of wretchedness in this film.And Miss Stanwyck, too, as an English heiress who has the misfortune to fall in love with Mr. Bogart just when he is looking for a new model for the \"Angel of Death,\" is much more the victim of the script-writer than she is of her own innocence. At best, she is just a trusting actress who has to behave awfully scared; at worst, she is a Hollywood worldling over her head in phoney English atmosphere.Add to the film's embarrassments a painfully precocious child, played by little Ann Carter, who has the unhealthy air of a highly malevolent midget snooping around the place. And add, too, a gaudy performance of a lacquered vamp by Alexis Smith and a musical score by Franz Waxman which drowns the soundtrack with banging, jangling bells.Whatever \"The Two Mrs. Carrolls\" had upon the stage, it has lost in an artless rewriting by Thomas Job and the mugging of all concerned.\n\nTHE TWO MRS. CARROLLS, screen play by Thomas Job, from the stage play by Martin Vale; directed by Peter Godfrey; produced by Mark Hellinger; a Warner Bros.-First National Picture.
