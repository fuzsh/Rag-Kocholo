        "text": "The Charm School was published in 1919, one hundred years ago, in 2019! It is a comedy, bordering on farce at some points, sprinkled with coincidence, misunderstandings, mysterious behaviour, and a missing Last Will and Testament that has unpredictable consequences. The short novel (about 70 pages in my full annotated edition) is probably set around 1910, near New York. The main characters include an incredibly handsome self-confident and resourceful young man of business (a car-salesman), his long-time school friend (completing his Law studies), middle-aged parents, elderly grandparents, adolescent school girls, and a young woman who might be romantically connected to the handsome young man if it were not for her bossy mother, her familial obedience, and the lofty social aspirations of the day. The main themes include the usefulness, or otherwise, of formal education for young ladies, and, parallel with that, the role of women, generally, in society of the era, and the social importance, or status, of wealth that is not directly connected with actual commerce or trade. Alice Duer Miller was a noted advocate for women’s rights. She defied the social expectations of her family’s social connection by completing her Secondary education and then going to college and excelling in the unladylike subjects of Mathematics and Astronomy! She married a businessman, and pursued a long, active, prolific, and successful career in journalism and literature. She was a friend and colleague of some of the most famous writers, journalists, actors, dramatists, artists and film-makers of her day. Aspects of this novel may be the most autobiographical in all of Miller’s large body of work. And it is funny!\n\nThis paper investigates the representation of female family relations-particularly sisters and mothers/daughters-in US-American films of the 1910s against the backdrop of a larger aesthetics of doubling. It addresses the close interaction of the cinema of the decade with the variety stage and its predilection for synchronized and ornamental arrangements, and then moves on to reflect on the cinematic conventions of double acts and dual roles in the context of the star system. It argues that by enacting sisters and mother/daughters as disturbing or delightful doubles, the entertainment culture of the 1910s addresses prominent gender scripts of the period."
