        "text": "Cosplaying Barbara Stanwyck as Sally Morton Carroll in The Two Mrs. Carrolls\n\nIt’s 1945. Hollywood, California. On the Warner Brothers lot, two heavyweights of the studio era are cast opposite one another for the first time: Barbara Stanwyck and Humphrey Bogart. The film: a psychological thriller set in the UK called The Two Mrs. Carrolls (1947). Bogart plays Geoffrey Carroll, a troubled painter who seems to find inspiration solely in his destructive impulses. Stanwyck plays Sally Morton Carroll, a wealthy heiress who becomes the second Mrs. Carroll. The director is Peter Godfrey, who had recently finished another film with Stanwyck, Christmas in Connecticut (1945).\n\nEven if you haven’t seen the film yet, I’d wager that you’ve gathered from the description above that this collaboration of Stanwyck and Bogart turned out to be a very strange movie. It’s safe to say TTMC falls under the Film Noir umbrella, but it veers unexpectedly close to a horror movie. Most of the film is set in the old, vaguely gothic Morton mansion. Peverell Marley’s cinematography is moody and emphasizes the darkness of the old house, John Decker created some very haunted looking paintings. Bogart gave a grotesque, but still thoughtful performance. These elements coalesce into something very creepy. Some might consider the film a lesser cousin of Suspicion (1941), but I think that its edge of horror makes The Two Mrs. Carrolls pulpier in an interesting way. TTMC might not be as impressive as you’d hope for the monumental pairing of Stany/Bogie, but it’s suspenseful and has an eerie charm.\n\nSome of the criticism of the film comes from the supposed miscasting of Bogart and Stanwyck. On one hand, I get it—neither are playing to type in the least—but, on the other hand, it’s refreshing to see both actors stretch themselves a bit. Bogart went big and created a divisive performance. Though I think his interpretation of the character is on point, he may have worked too hard to communicate that reading to us viewers. That said, overall, the grotesquery of Bogart’s performance was a fitting injection of pulpiness. In regard to Stanwyck however, even if Sally Morton Carroll isn’t the usual type for Stanwyck to play, she clearly had the range.\n\n“I always paint what I see. Some people find that embarrassing.”\n\nNow, a big reason I wanted to try this cosplay was because I wanted to experiment more with digital painting and photo editing again to emulate Geoffrey’s final portrait of Sally in the film. John Decker was a talented portraitist and caricaturist who was in demand in Hollywood circles from the late 1920s until his premature death in 1947. Decker was also the artist behind Edward G. Robinson’s character’s paintings in Scarlet Street (1945). Between these two films and the portraits Decker was commissioned for off-screen, I’m struck by how incredibly varied his style could be. As much as I love the paintings Decker did for Scarlet Street, I’m partial to his work in TTMC because of how they contribute to the characterization of Geoffrey and the overall tone of the film.\n\nThe “Angel of Death” painting\n\nThe first portrait of Sally Morton Carroll\n\nThe second portrait of Sally Morton Carroll\n\nIt’s actually pretty shocking to see the huge leap in style between the Angel of Death portrait of the first Mrs. Carroll and the more classical glamorous portrait of the second Mrs. Carroll. Geoffrey seems to only gather inspiration to paint if he has the feelings to reify or vilify a woman in his life. When a prospective third Mrs. Carroll, Cecily, enters the picture, it’s concerning that she doesn’t see the nature of those two paintings as a big red flag. And, of course, after Geoffrey starts his affair with Cecily, he starts painting Sally’s second portrait, but this time she’s monstrously rotting away. I’m not sure what sort of brief Decker was given to create each of these paintings but they work absolutely perfectly in the film.\n\n—"
