Most of the plot is revealed in dialogue, and the suspense isn't as strong as it could be.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Oct 14, 2013\n\nBogart's final seconds onscreen are played for comedy; it's as if the movie itself is winking at us, to apologize for its Gothic-suspense absurdity, but also to get us to admit we enjoyed our time together.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | May 27, 2011"
