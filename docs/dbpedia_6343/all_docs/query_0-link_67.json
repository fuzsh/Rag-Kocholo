It's also a very funny script, in a darkly macabre manner.\n\n\"I suppose if you insist, I don't really want it though\" *downs whiskey*\n\nSame.\n\nWall Sconce Shadows. Just wonderfully and fabulously macabre. Could have used a little supernatural elements but that's fine. It's sort of spooky in a very realistic way, although that painting is terrifying! And on that note great score. Good movie, maybe one of those lost gems."
