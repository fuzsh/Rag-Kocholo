        "text": "\"The Two Mrs. 'Carrolls\" is a drama-,\n\ntic mixture of love and terror. It tells\n\nthe. story of a man whose love is so\n\nintense that it brings horror to two\n\nwomen and eventually involves him in\n\na series of bizarre and frightening\n\nsituations.\n\nAs Geoffrey Carroll, Bogart, playing\n\na completely different type of role, is\n\nstated to give an excellent perform\n\nance. Miss Stanwyck, as the second\n\nMrs. Carroll, is equally good, and Miss\n\nSmith (the \"other woman\") is calm .\n\nand cool in her characterisation.\n\nOther members of the cast, including\n\nNigel Bruce, Isobel Elsom, . Pat\n\nO'Moore, and Ann' Carter, lend stature\n\nto the film's all-round quality."
