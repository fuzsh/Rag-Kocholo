        "text": "Till the next masterpiece is finished do us part\n\nBarbara Stanwyck had a unique motion picture career, especially during the 1940s and 1950s. Most box office names of that era were locked into long-term studio contracts and would occasionally, just occasionally, be loaned out. That was the case with her costars in this film, Humphrey Bogart & Alexis Smith. Bogart and Smith were under the thumb of Jack Warner and often not able to expand their range in genres at other studios.\n\nHowever, in Stanwyck’s case, she was one of the rare freelancers during these years…I say rare, because if there were freelancers in the studio system they tended to be men, not women. Yet Stanwyck bucked the trend and she was able to move from studio to studio, selecting the scripts she was most interested in doing. Also, because she was not limited by one particular studio’s style, she’s able to effortlessly segue from a role as a femme fatale killer at Paramount (in DOUBLE INDEMNITY) to a wacky homemaking guru at Warner Brothers (in CHRISTMAS AT CONNECTICUT) to a tragic tuberculosis patient at United Artists (in THE OTHER LOVE) to…well, you get the idea.\n\nWith THE TWO MRS. CARROLLS she was back at Warner Brothers, this time playing an imperiled socialite whose artist husband (Bogart) has sinister plans to do away with her once he’s completed painting her latest portrait, an Angel of Death type masterpiece. We know after the first ten minutes of the film the same fate befell his first wife, the original Mrs. Carroll, off-screen.\n\nOne too many glasses of poisoned warm milk led to the initial instance of uxoricide. Soon it will be time for Stanwyck’s character to get her dose of calcium and follow suit if outside forces don’t intervene.\n\nOne person who may be able to save Stanwyck is a dapper ex-beau (Patrick O’Moore) who is still holding a torch for her. He’s been a most gracious loser and stepped aside when she impulsively wed widower Bogart, but O’Moore likes visiting and hanging around the manse as a friend.\n\nThere is also a middle-aged doctor named Tuttle (Nigel Bruce in delightful scene stealing mode) who shows up on house calls. But his predilection for booze prevents him from properly diagnosing Stanwyck’s mysterious ailments.\n\nIndeed, Bruce has a habit of treating her and other such women for their nerves, instead of what really might be wrong with them. Then, there’s the police who get involved at the end when Bogart is dangerously close to offing Stanwyck.\n\nBy that point, Bogart has killed a pesky chemist (Barry Bernard) who won’t stop blackmailing him. It seems the chemist knows Bogart murdered the first Mrs. Carroll and has proof that the coppers may find interesting.\n\nA wonderfully acted scene by Bogart two-thirds of the way into the picture has his character visit the chemist one last time and snap, killing him on the spot. The desperation and determination to end such a threat is palpable.\n\nRounding out the supporting cast is Anita Sharp-Bolster as a no-nonsense majordomo employed by Stanwyck; as well as Isobel Elsom as a guest who’s arrived with her predatory daughter (Alexis Smith).\n\nSmith is pretty much a second lead, and as a Warner Brothers contractee, she is given third billing. But her character only forms one of two different triangles in the movie. And she disappears before the last act in which Bogart and Stanwyck finally square off.\n\nThe showdown at the end is very suspenseful. We’ve had Stanwyck reach a terrible realization that the man she married is mentally ill; and her perfect marriage has all been an illusion. He’s going to get rid of her, just as he did her predecessor.\n\nIt has all been confirmed by harrowing truths told to her by a wise young stepdaughter (Ann Carter), not to mention Stanwyck’s gone into her husband’s studio and glimpsed the Angel of Death portrait of herself. If that doesn’t say ‘your next,’ nothing does!\n\nAfter Bogart sends his daughter and housekeeper off, he intends to do away with Stanwyck. Conveniently for her, she has a gun given to her by O’Moore. You see, a burglar’s on the loose, and there is danger in the area. Of course, the greatest threat to Stanwyck’s ability to go on living is right under her own roof.\n\nThe moment when Bogart breaks into her bedroom as some sort of pseudo-vampire, takes the film from bubbling psychological thriller to full-bodied horror potboiler. It is the story’s dramatic highpoint and certainly the most memorable scene. Stanwyck was a good screamer in some of her movies (see her last feature William Castle’s THE NIGHT WALKER for verification of this fact); and she definitely knows how to convey terror (see SORRY WRONG NUMBER and WITNESS TO MURDER for additional proof).\n\nBut this is not just a Barbara Stanwyck movie. It’s also a Humphrey Bogart movie. We have a perfect collaboration of two stars of equal standing, at the peak of their respective careers. We don’t necessarily believe in them as a couple who need a happily ever after; but we do believe in them as a couple who can scale the emotional heights of an ill-fated union and make us appreciate the calmness of our comparatively uneventful affairs."
