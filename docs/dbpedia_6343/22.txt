Based on a novel by Marjorie Carleton, Cry Wolf (Warner Bros. 1947) directed by Peter Godfrey stars Errol Flynn, Barbara Stanwyck, Geraldine Brooks and Richard Basehart.

Franz Waxman’s film noir score is the ideal companion film to Peter Godfrey’s The Two Mrs. Carrolls (Warner Bros. 1947), released a few months earlier in the same year, which also stars Barbara Stanwyck, and Humphrey Bogart and Alexis Smith.
