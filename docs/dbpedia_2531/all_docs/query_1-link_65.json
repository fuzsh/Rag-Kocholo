        "text": "Just how bad a mother am I? I wondered, as I watched my 13-year-old son deep in conversation with Siri. Gus has autism, and Siri, Apple’s “intelligent personal assistant” on the iPhone, is currently his BFF. Obsessed with weather formations, Gus had spent the hour parsing the difference between isolated and scattered thunderstorms — an hour in which, thank God, I didn’t have to discuss them. After a while I heard this:\n\nGus: “You’re a really nice computer.”\n\nSiri: “It’s nice to be appreciated.”\n\nGus: “You are always asking if you can help me. Is there anything you want?”\n\nSiri: “Thank you, but I have very few wants.”\n\nGus: “O.K.! Well, good night!”\n\nSiri: “Ah, it’s 5:06 p.m.”\n\nGus: “Oh sorry, I mean, goodbye.”\n\nSiri: “See you later!”\n\nThat Siri. She doesn’t let my communications-impaired son get away with anything. Indeed, many of us wanted an imaginary friend, and now we have one. Only she’s not entirely imaginary.\n\nThis is a love letter to a machine. It’s not quite the love Joaquin Phoenix felt in “Her,” last year’s Spike Jonze film about a lonely man’s romantic relationship with his intelligent operating system (played by the voice of Scarlett Johansson). But it’s close. In a world where the commonly held wisdom is that technology isolates us, it’s worth considering another side of the story.\n\nIt all began simply enough. I’d just read one of those ubiquitous Internet lists called “21 Things You Didn’t Know Your iPhone Could Do.” One of them was this: I could ask Siri, “What planes are above me right now?” and Siri would bark back, “Checking my sources.” Almost instantly there was a list of actual flights — numbers, altitudes, angles — above my head.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
