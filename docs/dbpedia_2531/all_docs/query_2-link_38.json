        "text": "Choosing unique baby names is a growing trend among parents seeking individuality for their child, and it makes sense, especially since millennial parents have grown up with multiple Jessicas or Marks in their class; you don't get this with rare baby names.\n\nSome parents may choose from a host of names beginning with A or maybe from a cool baby names list. Still, more parents embrace distinctive names, like mum-of-two Jasmine, who chose Maddox and Arlo for her sons. \"I loved having an uncommon name growing up - it made me feel special, so I knew I wanted to go with more distinctive and unusual names for my boys,\" she says. And she's not alone, the quest for a truly unique name can be exciting yet daunting as parents try to balance creativity with their child's future happiness.\n\nEditor's note\n\nWhile this article suggests 'boy' names and 'girl' names, in reality names can be used for anyone - regardless of the sex at birth. You'll know what suits your baby.\n\nChild psychologist Lee Chambers explains, \"Unique names can be a gift in shaping a distinct identity, but may also present challenges if they fall too far outside social norms.\"\n\nMany parents today opt for more unusual names like Fox, Lovella, or Nyla. But finding inspiration can be tricky. Don't worry - we've got you covered.,Whether you prefer royal baby names or something more adventurous, see below for over 200 unique girls' and boys' names - best of luck in your search. (Or try this new Tinder for baby names app - it's a fun way to see if a name works for you)\n\nOur favourite unique baby names\n\nParents can be influenced by many things when it comes to baby names - from choosing old family names to the best baby names chosen by celebrities, did you know that Jordan Banjo's third baby has a unique name; Atreus? A recent study by Accent Clothing found that Armani and Kenzo are both popular unique baby names, with 65,000 babies being given the name in 2022 alone.\n\nDr. Jane Pilcher, SFHEA, Associate Professor of Sociology, specialises in names and says unusual baby names often say more about the parents than the child. \"Baby names can reflect parents and their aspirations,\" she says. \"There may be an element of parents choosing names based on what they want their child to achieve and be in life, but overall, baby names always say more about the parent than the child.”\n\nChild psychologist Lee Chambers adds: \"[unique names] can also be damaging to confidence if [the name] becomes a platform for bullying. Having a unique name can help to cultivate resilience and curiosity, but it does also require a level of support to ensure a feeling of belonging is still achieved.”\n\nGoodtoKnow Newsletter\n\nParenting advice, hot topics, best buys and family finance tips delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nSome unique baby names include:\n\nWindy\n\nVin'nyla\n\nVelvette\n\nStarlette\n\nSnowdrop\n\nPrecise\n\nPluto\n\nKairo\n\nKanaan\n\nBrayan\n\nUnique baby names for girls\n\nAbra Origin: Hebrew Gender: Girl Style: Boho Pronunciation: Ab-rah Meaning: One of the unique baby names that has connotations of magic – Abracadabra!

According to the Office of National Statistics, \"The UK has no law that restricts names that parents can legally give to their children. However, names that contain obscenities, numerals, misleading titles, or are impossible to pronounce are likely to be rejected by the Registering Officer.\"\n\nSo while you have carte blanche to name your baby almost anything, be prepared to have anything that could be considered to be offensive, or refused. For example, the Court of Appeal recently stopped a Welsh mother from naming her twin girl 'Cyanide' due to the emotional harm the child could suffer as a result. The Court of Appeal ruled that naming the girl after a \"notorious poison\" that Adolf Hitler used to end his life was unacceptable.\n\nHow to choose a baby name?\n\nThere really are so many variables to consider when choosing your little one's name - after all, they're with it for life. \"A baby’s name is one of the first gifts they get. So it’s no surprise that many parents put so much time and effort into finding the right one,\" says Kirsty Douglas, Parenting Expert at Kiddies Kingdom. \"When trying to come up with a baby name, it’s a good idea to start by deciding if you prefer commonly used or more unique names - this will help you reduce a potential list.\"\n\nIf you're struggling to narrow down your longer list of favourite names, or you're not even sure where to start, these tips will help:\n\nConsider your own values and beliefs: Think about what values and beliefs you want to instil in your child. Names with religious or spiritual significance may be meaningful if this is important to your family.\n\nThink about your family history and heritage: Reflecting on your cultural and ethnic background and naming your child in a way that connects them to your heritage can be a source of pride and identity. \"Take inspiration from popular culture, your surroundings, and existing family traditions to find a name you like\", advises Kirsty.\n\nConsider how it sounds: Pay attention to how the name sounds with your last name and the rhythm and flow of the full name when spoken aloud (or shouted across a playground!).\n\nAvoid negative associations: Be cautious about names that might have negative connotations. This includes considering potential teasing or mispronunciations.\n\nConsider future nicknames: Think about nicknames that could arise from your chosen name. Are you comfortable with them?\n\nPopular vs original: Decide whether you prefer a name that is popular and familiar or one that is unique and distinctive. Both have their merits.\n\nThink about the long term: Remember that your child will carry this name throughout their life. Will it still suit them as an adult?\n\nInitials: Check the initials of the first, middle, and last names together to ensure they don't spell anything undesirable.\n\nAsk for advice and ideas: Friends and family may have some brilliant ideas for your baby's name, but don't feel pressured to choose a name based solely on others' opinions.\n\nExplore variations in spelling: Don't be afraid to explore variations of names you like. Sometimes a small change can make a big difference.\n\nResearch the meaning of names: Look up the origins and meanings of names you're considering. You might find a name with a beautiful meaning that resonates with you.\n\nTake your time! Naming your child is an important decision, so don't rush it. In the end, trust your instincts. The name that resonates with you and feels right is likely the best choice for your child.\n\nRemember that choosing a name is a personal decision, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach. What matters most is that the name holds meaning and significance for you and your family.\n\nOur baby expert panel\n\nLee Chambers\n\nLee Chambers is a British psychologist, entrepreneur, and speaker.
