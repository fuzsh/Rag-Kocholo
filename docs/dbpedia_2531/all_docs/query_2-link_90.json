These nicknames carry different levels of familiarity and affection, so a person could be called by his first full name at work, a diminutive with friends and family, another diminutive by family members, and so on.\n\nIn some cases, these diminutive versions have become popular as names in their own right outside of Russia. Names such as Alec, Sasha and Misha are just three examples of diminutives of Russian names that work as standalone names.\n\nHere are some popular Russian baby boy names with their diminutives:\n\nAlexander - Sasha, Shura, Sashenka, Sashulya, Sashka, Sanya\n\nDmitry - Dima, Dimochka\n\nIvan - Vanya, Vanechka\n\nMikhail - Misha, Mishenka\n\nViktor - Vitya, Vityenka, Vityok\n\nYakov - Yasha, Yashen'ka\n\n151. Vl’koslav\n\nOrigin: Slavic\n\nMeaning: great glory\n\n152. Voyslav\n\nOrigin: Slavic\n\nMeaning: more glory\n\n153. Vyacheslav\n\nOrigin: Slavic\n\nMeaning: having greater glory\n\n154.
