        "text": "There in the crowd, among the media was Sanjana. My Sanjana, staring at me accusingly. Her eyes full of anger. I just wanted to jump off the stage and go behind her, but I couldn't. I had to stick to the performance. Once done, I moved in quickly to change. Sam followed and spanked my butt hard. That was it, I grabbed him by neck. ''I am not some struggling model that you can treat like shit. I am Rishi Mehra, next time will be your last time. Your secret wife will know more than she should.''\n\nSam was taken aback. He didn't expect me to threaten him, but who was he kidding. I was son on Roma Mehra, she knew the deepest darkest and most ugly truths of this industry and she made sure I knew it too.\n\nI quickly made my way out and walked in to check on Pooja but got to know she had already left. Without wasting a minute, I ran towards the media gallery searching for that one face which kept me awake for years. But she was nowhere to be found, I ran out and searched all around the parking but she was gone. I rubbed my face , I should have probed Pooja more, and then the realization dawned. If Pooja and Sanjana were here, that meant Jay and my parents knew about it. Time to confront the traitors\n\nSanjana\n\n''Sanjana, we are covering a fashion event.'' Meera briefed. I was still confused, ''Ma'am we are more of a PR firm, why are we covering it?''\n\nShe smiled. ''We have to plan a grand PR event for one of the designers, precisely for his upscale store many, celebrities should be attending that and it should be in a way that the designer is majorly benefitted.''\n\nI nodded, understanding nothing. Meera just patted my head. ''You will be late today for home.'' I just nodded. But frankly, like any other simple person was excited to meet celebrities in person . I ran out to my mentor. ''Ma'am any dress code.''\n\n''Just look human and call me Meera.'' I nodded\n\nMeera briefed the team about their respective roles and commended me to stay with her.\n\nWhen we reached the designation, I realized I was going to watch my friend walk the ramp for the first time. I was so excited and made a small prayer for Pooja. I messaged her, letting her know I was there and she called back sounding little worried. I assured her that she would nail it but there was something else that bothered her which I couldn't figure out.\n\n***\n\nMeera made me sit next to her and asked me to make notes. ''About?'' I asked clueless. She shook her head.\n\n''Keep your eyes on each dress , specially on the designer named Sam. I want to know your thoughts. Also, each and every person we meet, you need to study them like a book. This will help you understand people and be a better PR person.'' I nodded, again clueless about it\n\nThe show started, models started walking in. I was in an awe, its one thing watching them on television and then in person. Their job is difficult, the kind of uncomfortable clothes they wear along with those inhumane shoes got them my respect. I pulled my phone out and started recording. After a minute, I noticed my mentor watching me . ''Making notes.''\n\nShe just smiled and went on.\n\nWe had 2 drinks breaks and I enjoyed the mouth watering snacks. The final designer was Sameer AKA Sam. ''No one will wear those.'' I whispered as his show started\n\n''Shut up.'' Meera whispered back. I just pressed my lips together to hide my smiled. When Pooja walked in, My smiled was like a 1000 watt blub. She looked chic but her trimmed waist bothered my. I was suddenly so proud like a mama bear.\n\n''That's my roomie and best friend.'' I said proudly, feeling necessary for all to know\n\nMeera watched me for a minute. ''She is good, her future looks bright.'' I nodded enthusiastically feeling amazing about my Pooja.\n\nIt was time for the show stopper to walk in and crowd suddenly started cheering. My eyes went to he stage and froze, Rishi walked in in leather pants with unbuttoned blazer, his torso on full display. He had his hair gelled back and looked like a movie gangster. he Rishi I lost was a boy and Rishi on stage was a man. He had changed , his face had some kind of hardness I couldn't make out. Nevertheless, I went about recording.\n\n''He is Rishi Meher, Son of two business magnets.'' Meera informed. I just nodded. I realized why Pooja sounded worried. She was worried about my reaction. I would be If I was in her place. A part of me felt happy to see him. I have waited so long, worked on myself to be someone he would like. I did all which would make me a confident person but now, my whole body was filled with a different kind of anger. I was made at him for not believing me, for not calling or reaching out. For vanishing from my life as if it meant nothing.\n\nI was so done.\n\nOnce the photographers were done with final clicks, Meera informed us of he buffet but I wasn't hungry. I stood there so that he could see me, see that I was mad and was going to make him go through the hell.\n\nMy eyes met his hers and he forgot to blink. He didn't move away, just kept them locked with mine in surprise. Just then someone pulled him aside and my phone rang. ''I am ready to leave.'' Pooja informed. ''Give me five minutes''\n\nI asked Meera if I could leave and she agreed with an instruction about a summary on today's event. Thanking her, I quickly moved to the exit. The first thing Pooja did I after meeting was hugged me. ''make him pay.''\n\n''Oh I will.''\n\n''We should buy car.'' She said when none of the app drivers accepted our request. We walked a distanced and flagged an autorickshaw. he must have felt pity on two skinny looking girls and agreed. We got lectured on roaming around late in the night and my mind was working on different ways of killing Rishi in hundred different ways .\n\n''Pooja, don't give him my number.''\n\n''I won't but what about Jay?''\n\n''I have already messaged and threatened him. ALso, don't let Rishi know of our address. I am not ready to see or talk to him as of yet.''\n\n''Sure! I would rather enjoy watching him beg.'' Pooja replied.\n\nWe reached home half past the midnight and were exhausted. After changing, we just crashed and slipped into a deep slumber. It was somewhere in midnight when I felt both our phones vibrating. it was Jai on mine and an unknown number on Pooja's. I knew that was Rishi. But no, he deserves to burn in uncertainty just like Id id for past couple of years. Mr bad Boy, I am going to make you cry.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
