It was released on April 12, 2019, by Big Hit Entertainment.[8] The song's music video was the most viewed online music video in 24 hours at the time, garnering over 74.6 million views within its first day of release. The song was certified Platinum by the RIAA in June. \"Boy with Luv\" held the record for the song with the most music show wins after the 2000s in South Korea with 21 wins, until the record was broken by \"Dynamite\".[9]\n\nOn July 3, 2019, the Japanese version of the song was released as a double A-side single alongside an original Japanese track titled \"Lights\" via Universal Music Japan.[10]\n\nComposition\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Boy With Luv\" featuring American singer Halsey has been described as a \"funk pop\" song about happiness and love.[2] It is performed in the key of D major with the vocals ranging from F♯4 to B5.[11] It serves as a parallel track to their earlier song \"Boy in Luv\", released in 2014. According to Tamar Herman of Billboard, the song describes how true strength and love come from finding joy in the smallest things in life.[12] Elias Leight from Rolling Stone classified the song as \"nu-disco single\".[4] NME characterized it as \"bubblegum pop\".[5] Yim Hyun-su from The Korea Herald described the lead single as \"an upbeat electro-pop song with catchy hooks\".[6] According to Refinery29, the light, funk-laced song features live instruments.[13]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nA trailer for the music video was released on April 7, 2019, with a 13-second clip of the song towards the end.[14] The teaser features Halsey working in a ticket booth before walking outside to find BTS sitting on a couch.[14] A second teaser, featuring close-ups of the band, was released on April 10.[15]\n\nDirected by Yong-Seok Choi from Lumpens, the full music video was released on April 12.[16][17] It simultaneously obtained the records of fastest-liked video and fastest-viewed video on YouTube, reaching 3 million likes in 2 hours and 74.6 million views within 24 hours of release, making it the most viewed YouTube video in the first 24 hours after its release at the time, averaging about 860 views per second during that interval. It was also the fastest video to reach 100 million views on YouTube, doing so in approximately one day and 10 hours.[18] On April 26, BigHit released a second version of the music video, titled \"ARMY With Luv\", dedicated to the band's fandom, ARMY.[19] The video featured footage of the band not seen in the original version and more moments with Halsey; the large \"LOVE\" sign that appears atop a building while the band dances in the original was replaced with one that spelt \"ARMY\" instead.[20] In December 2019, YouTube named it the most viewed music video in South Korea of the year.[21] The music video crossed 1 billion views in October 2020, eighteen months after release, and is the band's second to reach the mark.[22][23]\n\nPromotion\n\n[edit]\n\nThe band performed the song for the first time on April 13, 2019, as the musical guests on Saturday Night Live (making them the first K-Pop Group to perform on the show) and performed it with Halsey at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards held on May 1, 2019. BTS started their Korean promotion on April 18, 2019, on M Countdown. They performed the song again to kick off Good Morning America's Summer Concert Series at New York's Central Park on May 15, 2019, along with their 2016 single, Fire.[24] On May 16, 2019, BTS performed the song at The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.[25] On May 21, 2019, they performed the song at The Voice's finale.[26] On May 30, 2019, they also performed the song at Britain Got Talent's semi-final.[27]\n\nOn November 30, BTS performed \"Boy with Luv\" at the 2019 Melon Music Awards with throwbacks to \"Boy in Luv\".[28] On December 4, the song was performed at the 2019 Mnet Asian Music Awards.[29] Two days later, BTS performed the song at the KIIS-FM Jingle Ball in Los Angeles, where they appeared as a headliner. In addition, BTS performed the song in South Korea at the SBS Gayo Daejun and KBS Song Festival on December 25 and 27, respectively,[30][31] following which the song was performed in New York's Times Square at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve.[32]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nTaylor Glasby writing for Dazed labelled \"Boy With Luv\" as \"a beacon of pop sweetness\". Dazed placed it in their list of \"The 20 best K-pop songs of 2019\" and commended the \"catchy, made-for-radio immediacy\" of the song, additionally characterizing \"the playful lightness of the instrumental, vocals, and overall mood\" that \"bring to it a joyful ingenuousness and an old-world classiness that keeps the song sounding box fresh.\"[34] Writing for the Consequence of Sound, Laura Dzubay called the song \"familiarly romantic\".[35] The song was included in South China Morning Post's list of \"The 10 best K-pop songs of 2019\".
