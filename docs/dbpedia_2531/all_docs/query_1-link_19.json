        "text": "You have probably heard a lot of people say that “love hurts” — and we all tend to follow the crowd and believe that “love hurts” but this isn’t true.\n\nLove doesn’t hurt you. A person that doesn’t know how to love hurts you. Don’t get it twisted.\n\nI think Love is the most incredible thing in the world — but when people lie, cheat, and betray our trust, we become bitter, we blame love — we start losing hope in love.\n\nThe worst part about the heartbreak is that we lose ourselves trying to hold on to that person who doesn’t care at all.\n\nWe start saying “I am afraid to fall in love because I don’t want to get hurt again”\n\nLove isn’t supposed to hurt. If it does, then it is absolutely not a true love.\n\nEveryone says love hurts, but that is not true. Loneliness hurts. Rejection hurts. Losing someone hurts. Envy hurts. Everyone gets these things confused with love, but in reality, love is the only thing in this world that covers up all pain and makes someone feel wonderful again. Love is the only thing in this world that does not hurt.\n\nI know how it feels to be broken. Been there and experienced that kind of pain. I’ve been in a relationship for 4 years but found out I’ve been cheated on this whole time. When you find yourself in a similar situation, how do you begin to trust someone new?\n\nIt does take a lot of courage for a person to open their heart to someone new because we all have that fear inside of us due to bad past experience. But don’t let your past be an issue in your present and future.\n\nLove truly, be fearless — accept the person the way they are — because true love sees beyond all imperfections.\n\nSomeone who truly loves you sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, and how hard you can be to handle but still wants you.\n\nTrue love makes you happy in a way that you have never been happy before. It heals your broken parts and lifts you up.\n\nDon’t let things and circumstances change you into someone you’re not.\n\nIf you can love the wrong person that much, imagine how much you can love the right one\n\nIf you are in a relationship and your significant other constantly judges you, brings out your imperfections. Makes you feel like you are a burden. Doesn’t appreciate you and the efforts you make for them, get out of the relationship.\n\nSome people try to fantasize abusive relationship — which is wrong on so many levels. As soon as you see that you’re not getting the love, attention or respect, walk away.\n\nDon’t stress over someone who doesn’t value your worth.\n\nYour relationship should erase your tears, not your smile. True love doesn’t hurt, it heals. It brings happiness to your life. It empowers you to become the best version of yourself.\n\nA real love is supposed to feel euphoric and spontaneous.\n\nThe most amazing and romantic things aren’t in materialistic stuff. The things that matter the most are those little things you do every day to show significant other that you care and that you’re thinking of them. When you love someone unconditionally, you’d go out of your way to make them happy and feel special.\n\nTrue love knows someone’s weakness and doesn’t take advantage of them. It knows their flaws and still accepts them\n\nAlways remember that when love is real, it doesn’t lie, cheat, pretend, hurt you or make you feel unwanted. It’s supposed to be a cure to all your worries. Real love means to stay together and never give up.\n\nYou don’t give up on the people you love\n\nA person that really loves you wouldn’t give up on you no matter how hard the situation is — when it’s real you can’t walk away.\n\nLove, respect, and acceptance are very important in any healthy relationship.\n\nDon’t change yourself just to make someone love you. Be yourself and let the right one fall for you. People nowadays try to change you into their own definition of perfection. They get caught up in so-called “types” that makes me sick.\n\nIt’s ridiculous how much society says things like “I want a girl or boy covered in tattoos, I want a boy who has a beard and lots of piercings and long hair” blah blah blah\n\nWhat most of those people fail to realize is that looks change, and fade. How about a guy or woman who treats you right, who looks in your eyes and you can see how much they truly love you and admire your company?\n\nMaybe someone who even in their worst moods will still do what they can to make you smile? That’s something you should be looking for.\n\nI believe, one day you do find someone who can turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another person. That’s the person worth keeping in your life.\n\nThanks for reading, If you enjoyed reading this post, recommend this post (by clicking the ❤ button) so other people can see it."
