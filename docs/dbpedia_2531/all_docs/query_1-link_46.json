        "text": "''Really? If She is my girl friend, then who are you.'' her face ashen. She was about to retaliate when Rishi shot next, ''You just admitted that we aren't together and whatever stories you make are just rumors and you bully girls blaming them for trying to woo me.''\n\nHis voice suddenly echoed everywhere. I didn't realize that music had stopped and all the attention was focused on Rishi and Ruby. My eyes moved to Rishi, he stood with his back to me. This was the first time I had a look at him and now I know why Ruby is so mad for him. Rishi is impressive in personality, what makes him more attractive is his confidence in himself. It took me a minute to realize that he again shifted the attention away from me. No one was now interested in what Ruby called me a minute back but the drama that unfolded right now.\n\n''Stop it Rishi.'' Ruby whispered\n\n''You need to stop with all the rumor Ruby. I AM NOT INTERESTED IN YOU.'' That came harsh and insulting. Rishi them turned towards the crowd, ''Guys here, beware of Ruby. She dreams and then thinks it to be reality. I have proofs. Now, for the last time , I am Single and ready to mingle but not with likes of Ruby.''\n\nRuby was beet red, she walked off with her group. ''Back to party.'' Rishi screamed giving a thumbs up to someone on the first floor and the music started booming the surroundings My eyes moved finding Jai dancing weirdly, together they set Ruby up, I was just a catalyst . My eyes moved again to Rishi and he winked walking away with a girl too keen to dance with him. I just stood there with my head lowered and a smile spread on my lips. I think he isn't that bad. Rest of the time, he kept dancing with every girl in the room without giving me a glance. Pooja pulled me along and we enjoyed rest o the evening dancing our heart out\n\nRishi.\n\nMeeting Sanjana at the Party was a coincidence, but exposing Ruby was the plan. I was tired of her self declared love story with me. The luck seemed to be on my side and I was at the right place when she pushed Sanajna. I thought of being the hero but this girl instead of thanking me threw a blame at me. ''Are you following me?'' I laughed\n\n''Yes, I have a crush on you.'' It was true, and my reply turned her pink. Jai had made sure that music paused when I confronted Ruby. We had already requested the host for help and she obliged in exchange of a date and dance with me. Big deal!\n\nRest of evening, I obliged all who wanted a chance to dance or have fun with me. Getting rid of Ruby seemed to be the best day of my life. Though I kept my distance , but would steal glances at Sanjana, when she wasn't looking.\n\nSanjana, every time that name comes to mind , my lips stretch into a smile. She is like a breath of fresh air and I want to keep her safe at any cost. The feeling is new and beautiful . I want o know her, hear her but above all I want to befriend her. I noticed her Pooja and Sanjana leaving and I gestured Jai. We kept our distance by following them home in shadows. Once in campus, we quietly moved to our route.\n\nI intentionally decided to take the route through her apartment. I have noticed her on the balcony a number of times and was wishing for the same.\n\nAs we walked passed her block , she came from no where and stood blocking my path. Jai squeaked as if he had seen a ghost. ''Girl, you scared us.'' She frowned at him but ignored turning her eyes to me.\n\n''Thank You! You saved me twice.''\n\n''I was there for my own plan. You were a coincidence.'' I replied. She smiled, '' Still, thanks.''\n\n''Welcome...You will always be welcome.'' I whispered and then something unexpected happened. ''Hi Rishi...I am Sanjana. Will you be my friend.''\n\nI stared at her , she smiled extending her hand. ''Bad boy, its your lucky day. he offer might not be valid tomorrow.'' And I grabbed it pulling her an inch closer. \"Bad Boy accepts your friendship.'' We heard a thud and found Jai lying on the floor as if he fainted.\n\n''Ignore him.''\n\n''Ignored.''\n\n''Since we are friends now, let me know if you need any help.'' She smiled . \"I will.'' I pulled Jai up, he still kept his head hanging and tongue out. he is now embarrassing me. Sanjana just frowned at him before walking away. After making me carry him for few meters Jai suddenly leaped into my arms. ''I am so happy that I am going to cry.'' He started acting like those over emotional mother from movies.\n\n''Jai, you are way too heavy. Be done with your drama.'' He started sobbing. ''I am so happy, I will get to see your and her kids. Man, I' gonna cry. Mommy is so proud of her baby.'' I stood there for a minute allowing my friend to gain some senses and he did laughing his heart out. He is such a drama but the light of my life. Jai and I have seen all together and grown together. We would do anything for one and another and there is no doubt about it\n\n''You know Jai isn't going to let her go that easily . He has a way of manipulating girls, he has done that before and you know of it.''\n\n''Sanjana is smart. Second, she has me.'' He nodded and then batted his lashes. ''And me!'' I was so done with this guy\n\n***\n\nWhen I stepped on the porch in the morning, the surroundings displayed all remnants of last night's drizzle. Moving in , I got ready for my run. Though, I prefer being indoors in such weather but thought of having a glimpse of Sajana made me go ahead. I started with walk before sprinting into slow jog. My lips stretched into a smile as I approached her block. Pulling my mask up I tried looking unbothered. Our friendship is raw and I don't want it affected. My speed reduced as my heart picked up, I moved my eyes and there she was on the balcony with a seaming cup. She waved, ''Good morning Bad boy.'' I replied with a wave but nothing came out. The mere thought of her being able to recognize me even my face being covered filled me with a certain joy. She has noticed me, and that was enough. I picked my speed going about my run.\n\n***\n\nIt had been days but other than morning greetings we haven't met and I decided to take initiative to invite her over a coffee. She accepted but what she said next made me smile. ''Look Rishi, its only friendship. I don't want you think more.''\n\n''What if I think more?'' I asked\n\n''You are not my type.''\n\n''what is your type.''\n\n''Whom my family likes. Someone safe.'' Leaning closer I whispered, ''I am not safe, I will never be. But you will like me. For now, rest assured we are just friends. Now, tell me what clubs have you opted for.\n\nShe made a comically sad expression, ''I didn't, but I have been made to chose drama. And now I have rehearsals. Acting is so tough and draining.''\n\nI popped a snack in my mouth and asked, ''So what role do you play?''\n\n''I am a tree.'' And I coughed, literally as if someone was chocking me. By the time I composed myself she was staring at me angrily. ''That peanut went down the wind pipe. I know how hard it must be stand and one place and not utter a word.'' She was still staring at me and then we both laughed.\n\n''When do you rehearse and which Audi?'' I asked\n\n''Auditorium 3 and we do every Wednesday and Fridays but don't come.''\n\n''OH I will. I want to see the acting of the tree.'' She threw some peanuts at me cursing me but I just couldn't control. What an end to my evening\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
