        "text": "If you’re looking for a fun group activity or just a way to pass the time, a classic game of Truth or Dare is the perfect way to get to know your best friends even better. Whether it’s deep, soul-searching Qs or daredevil antics that you prefer, your style of playing can reveal a lot about you. (Anyone else on Team Truth out there? Same.)\n\nWe rounded up the very best Truth or Dare questions and ideas that will keep things interesting (you can also check out other game ideas — or even try a Truth or Dare generator if you're feeling really bold). Whether you're at a slumber party with your besties or taking to the highway for a road trip, this iconic game is a go-to for endless entertainment — and the best part? No consoles or playing cards are required.\n\nAnd just in case you need a refresher on the rules, we’ve got you covered there too: Simply go around in a circle asking players if they’d prefer truth questions or dare questions — you’ll find plenty of both below — and don’t forget to set the appropriate “punishment” for players who opt to pass on their turn.
