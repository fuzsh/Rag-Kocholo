        "text": "A BLIND MAN CAN SEE HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU\n\nBy Amy Bloom.\n\n163 pages. Random House. $22.95.\n\nExotic intimacies color the sharply wrought stories in Amy Bloom's fine new collection. And they reveal themselves hauntingly as these tales unfold. For instance, in the title selection the closeness of a mother named Jane and a child named Jessie is the starting point for an unusual journey, since it turns out that Jessie's visit to a gender-reassignment surgeon is the story's galvanizing event. Jessie is about to become Jess. Her mother is about to strike up a heterosexual liaison that, in the context of this story's sense of mutable sexual identity, seems far more peculiar than what Jessie/Jess is going through.\n\nIn a set of stories whose characters find themselves bridging various chasms -- medical, sexual, racial -- and casually breaking assorted taboos, Ms. Bloom writes warmly and astutely, with arresting precision, about the various adjustments that they make. So we learn in ''A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You,'' with the unconditional acceptance inherent in its title, that Jessie and Jane were always close, even when the mother had not yet fully acknowledged her child's anomalous sexual nature.\n\nThus, when young Jessie rejected a dress for a wedding and insisted on a boy's navy blazer with gray pants, ''Jane knew that she had managed not to see it, as you manage not to see that your neighbor's new baby has your husband's eyes and nose.'' But it is clear from the story's first sentence (''Jane Spencer collects pictures of slim young men'') that the mother will follow her child anywhere, even to a parents' support group where one father is a general trying hard to understand his former son:\n\n''Loved that boy, fed him a hot breakfast at 4 a.m., drove him to tae kwon do tournaments all over Minnesota and then all over the Midwest. They flew to competitions in Los Angeles for 10 and 11, to Boston for under 13, then to the National Juniors Competitions, and there are 300 trophies in their house. That boy is now swinging one small-ankled foot, dangling a pink high-heeled sandal off it and modeling himself not on Mia Hamm or Sally Ride or even Lindsay Davenport . . . but on Malibu Barbie. And the general has to love this girl as he loved that boy, or be without.''\n\nBy this point in the story Jane herself is so immersed in Jess's experience that she thinks potential transsexuals might be everywhere if the surgery were easy enough, ''and they might be considered no worse than Roseanne or Burt Reynolds.'' So when she meets a man named Cole, whose hands are the same size as hers and who refers to his ''soon-to-be ex-wife,'' she finds herself ''trying to figure out whether he means 'wife' in the sense of 'woman I am married to,' or 'wife' in the sense of 'man in my life who played a kind of wifely role.' ''"
