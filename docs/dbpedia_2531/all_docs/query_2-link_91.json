        "text": "“It’s very strange when people mention, ‘Oh, you were married to Steve McQueen?’” confesses Barbara Minty McQueen in her most comprehensive interview to date debuting exclusively today. “He was such a normal guy and unlike most Hollywood stars that I often say, ‘I could have just as easily been married to a plumber or electrician.’”\n\nErase any preconceived notions — Minty isn’t your typical self-absorbed former supermodel. Before she married the quintessential action movie icon, Minty was the proud daughter of a tough as nails dairy farmer.\n\nAs a five-year-old little girl growing up in Corvallis, Oregon, Minty would stay glued to the television every Saturday night to catch her favorite show, CBS’s Wanted: Dead or Alive, the series that established McQueen into a household name.\n\nWithin months of her high school graduation, the fresh-faced if driven young lady was on her way to encounter the bright lights of New York City, ultimately appearing on the covers of prestigious publications like Cosmopolitan, Glamour, and Sports Illustrated.\n\nIn July 1977 the straight from the hip shooter’s life was forever altered when she received a phone call from her gruff talking, chain-smoking modeling agent Nina Blanchard in Los Angeles."
