        "text": "Harlan Coben's Netflix shows always have us glued to the sofa, and thanks to his five-year deal with the streaming service, it doesn't look like that's going to change any time soon.\n\nWhether you've got a weekend spent on the sofa or want a thrilling series to watch each night, we've got just the ticket. Because what could be more appealing than settling down with an array of snacks and a Harlan Coben mystery? Even better, why don't you settle down for a binge-watch of them?\n\nThe American author has penned 33 novels which have sold 80 million copies and been translated into 43 languages. In 2018, he signed a multi-million-dollar five-year deal with Netflix to adapt 14 of his books into TV series, some of which have already come out. Here's your guide to Harlan Coben's Netflix shows, starting with the latest release, before looking at what's to come.\n\nUpcoming Harlan Coben Netflix projects\n\nOn 22nd January 2024, Netflix revealed the next two Harlan Coben adaptations that would be coming to the streaming platform. Those include:\n\nMissing You, 2025\n\nLanguage: English\n\nBook release: March 2016\n\nCast: Rosalind Eleazar, Jessica Plummer, Richard Armitage, Lenny Henry, Steve Pemberton, Paul Kaye, Samantha Spiro, Lisa Faulkner and Mary Malone\n\nNumber of episodes: Five\n\nEpisode length: 60 minutes\n\nFilming for Missing You started in spring 2024 in Manchester. The novel follows detective Kat Donovan (played by Rosalind Eleazar from Slow Horses), whose fiancé Josh disappeared 11 years ago without a trace. Her whole world is turned upside down when she's scrolling through a dating app, and he appears, forcing her to unpack the mysteries (including her father's murder) from over a decade ago.\n\nRun Away\n\nLanguage: English\n\nBook release: 2019\n\nCast: Currently unknown\n\nNumber of episodes: Currently unknown\n\nEpisode length: Currently unknown\n\nThe novel is set in New York, and follows Simon, who seemingly has a perfect family life. That is until his eldest daughter Paige runs away, gets addicted to drugs and has a dangerous boyfriend. Simon's quest to bring his daughter home takes him into a criminal underworld, while also revealing there are threatening issues much closer to home than he thinks.\n\nDetails about the production of Run Away are currently under wraps, and it's not known whether it will be set in the UK instead of New York.\n\nHarlan Coben shows on Netflix in order\n\nFool Me Once, 1st January 2024\n\nLanguage: English\n\nBook release: 2015\n\nCast: Michelle Keegan, Richard Arm itage, Joanna Lumley, Adeel Akhtar\n\nNumber of episodes: Eight\n\nEpisode length: 60 minutes\n\nIn February 2023, Netflix announced the next Harlan Coben project heading to the streaming service: Fool Me Once. The series was filmed in Manchester and follows Maya (Michelle Keegan), who is shocked to spot her husband Joe (Richard Armitage) - who she believed to be dead - in her house after installing a nanny-cam to watch over her daughter.\n\nDetective Sergeant Sami Kierce (Adeel Akhar) is in charge of the homicide investigation into Joe's death, whilst also battling secrets of his own. Maya's niece and nephew are dealing with their own mother's murder, which occurred a few months earlier, and they're on the hunt for answers. Is there any chance the two cases are connected?\n\nThe new series will be released on 1st January 2024, perfect for cosy New Year's Day binge watching.\n\nHold Tight, released April 2022\n\nLanguage: Polish\n\nBook release: April 2008\n\nCast: Magdalena Boczarska, Leszek Lichota, Grzegorz Damiecki, Agata Labno\n\nNumber of episodes: Six\n\nEpisode length: 42 to 51 minutes\n\nFilmed in Polish, the drama follows the story of a young man who goes missing soon after his friend dies, focusing on his family in the aftermath. With life in his tight-knit, affluent Warsaw suburb now uprooted, the lives of those around him slowly unravel, exposing a chain of secrets and lies.

Netflix does.\n\n\"[Gone For Good] is five episodes, The Innocent is eight, some episodes are 40 minutes, some are 50 minutes. For my kind of storytelling, streaming fits.\"\n\nHe continued, \"they are also doing really interesting things with their marketing. They change up the poster you’re looking at on the platform, to get new people to watch it. I am a guy who wants people to watch my shows. That sounds obvious but a lot of writers pretend they don’t care, I do care. Netflix has a tremendous worldwide platform and that’s cool.\"\n\nStream on Netflix now."
