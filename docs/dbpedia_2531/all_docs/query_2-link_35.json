While they’re uncommon, we don’t find them strange. We find them unique, refreshing, and fun! We’ve gathered unusual picks that we think are cool as can be.\n\nReligious titles are plentiful with Deacon, Bishop, and Saint standing apart from the pack. While many consider them weird, we find them awesome! Celebrities do too, as they’re a hit in famous circles. Other parents enjoy names straight from the scripture like Jesus, Messiah, and Angel which turn heads, but definitely in a good way!\n\nRoyal titles are another group that get labeled as weird boy names, though Prince, King, and Duke are growing in popularity. We find them similar to many of the top names that follow the occupational name trend like Mason, with Sailor and Baker two fun picks that often get labeled as weird boy names. We’re loving on color pick, a style typically viewed as unusual. Some cool picks in this category include Silver, Golden, and Red.\n\nWord names are generally seen as unusual by traditional folk, but we love many that are labeled as weird like Arrow and Cannon. They’re fun alternatives to Hunter, and we hope to see more of them. If you turn to the globe, many countries used as names are seen as unusual like Israel, Zaire, and Cuba, but we find them fresh and exciting, especially if you’re honoring somewhere special.\n\nWeird boy names aren’t that weird if you think about it. They’re different, but nothing to be afraid of. Names come from all around the world, and just because something is new to you, that doesn’t mean it’s weird! Expand your horizons with these so-called weird boy names. You might find a new name to love that you’d never expect!"
