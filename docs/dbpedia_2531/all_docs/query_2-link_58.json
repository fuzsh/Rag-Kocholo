        "text": "When it comes to choosing a baby name, many parents prefer unique and original options that won’t be on every book bag in preschool. If you’re among those who prioritize distinctive and creative monikers—and are on the hunt for a unique boy name—look no further.\n\nIn the past, the top 10 baby boy names in the U.S. were given to as many as one-third of all males. But today, the trend of choosing popular baby names is much less significant. According to a report by Namerology, the top 10 baby names now only account for one-fourteenth of all boys born in the U.S. That’s quite a bit of movement toward choosing a moniker that's unlike any other!\n\nHere, we’ve compiled a list of 100 unique boy names for your little one. And even if you don’t find a name that suits your child, you can customize one of our picks to make it your own.\n\nAlthough this article separates names by gender, your baby’s assigned sex at birth does not need to dictate the name you choose for them. Names are not inherently gendered or associated with a specific sex, and it's important to select a name that feels right for your little one and your family.\n\nBest Unique Names for Boys\n\nChoosing a unique name for a boy is not for the faint of heart. If you're like most parents, you want a name that's interesting and uncommon, but not so much that it causes your little guy embarrassment when they enter school.

That's because a name should fit your little one's personality (or who you imagine them to be), while not being too over-the-top. Finding a balance between the two is key. Here are a few tips to consider as you make your decision.\n\nChoose a name that you like, has meaning, or represents something important to you.\n\nConsider other factors of the name besides its uniqueness, like what it means or how it could be interpreted by others.\n\nThink about whether the name could be mispronounced or mistaken for another name.\n\nMake sure the spelling of the name is something your child will be able to master once they start school.\n\nThink about how other kids could use the name, and whether it has the potential to become something they're teased about.\n\nConsider whether your baby's unique name will fit every stage of their life—you want the name to be just as appropriate in preschool as it is in the workforce.\n\nResearch the name you're considering to ensure it's not associated with something negative or a person who has questionable character.\n\nThink about how other people might shorten the name and how those abbreviations might impact your child.\n\nLook at your child's initials to avoid any unfortunate acronyms.\n\nStrive to choose a name that can stand the test of time, even though it's unique.\n\nMore Baby Name Ideas\n\nFor more baby name inspiration, take a look at the following lists:\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nTell us why!\n\nSources\n\nParents uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
