        "text": "So we are in the crucial week where Vice President Harris is going to be deciding who her vice presidential nominee is going to be. People who nobody was thinking that much about beforehand have actually broken through. And one has broken through in particular, which is Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. And Tim Walz broke through not for his biography — which is very impressive and in some ways lab grown for a Democrat right now. But that wasn’t what did it. What did it was one interview. I think this is going back to the bread and butter, getting away from this division. We do not like what has happened where we can’t even go to Thanksgiving dinner with our uncle because you end up in some weird fight that is unnecessary. And I think bringing back people together. Well, it’s true. And these guys are just weird. It is. They’re running for He-Man Women Hater’s Club or something. That’s what they go at. That was really the interview heard around the Democratic Party. I have never seen in all of my years in politics a single media hit, or for that matter, speech from a politician, change an entire party’s messaging and orientation all at once. And he goes over to the flag, and he hugs the flag. And I love the flag, but it’s a weird thing he does. JD Vance is awfully weird. It’s not just a weird style that he brings, it’s that this leads to weird policies. A weird idea. It’s just plain weird. But I’ve been wanting to dig a bit deeper into the way Walz came up with that, the way he understands it, and also his record, his particular strategy for appealing to Republicans in districts that vote for Donald Trump. And so he’s kind enough to join me on the show. Governor Walz, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me, Ezra. So you’ve had a hell of a couple of weeks. And I don’t think I’ve ever seen any single person, including, for that matter, a president, change an entire party’s messaging the way your riff on Morning Joe on the weirdness of Trump and JD Vance and Republicans of their ilk did. Now it’s all that any Democrat says. I heard Joe Manchin calling JD Vance weird today. When that messaging’s hit Joe Manchin, something’s happened. So that connected in a way I almost can’t remember anything connecting. But you’ve been using that word for a while when a lot of other Democrats are using existential, terrifying, undemocratic. I’m not saying you don’t believe those things, but why, for you, ‘weird?’ Yeah. All those things are true about an existential threat to global peace, in my opinion, a threat to women’s reproductive. I think that very clearly a desire to strip constitutional power and division, all of those things are true. And for me as a teacher, you couldn’t make your case why people were in that mindset. When they’re in a fear mindset, it’s very difficult for them to listen. And they kept hearing that. And again, our Democrats kept making that ‘democracy is on the ballot.’ Yes, we know that’s true, and we’re scared to death. It’s the emperor’s wearing no clothes is what all this story is. The minute you said that, the spell broke. It dropped down. This guy’s weird stories and inability to connect like a human being on any way — and I made the case, see if you see him laugh. He doesn’t laugh unless he’s laughing at someone. And what happened was the minute that spell came down, the minute everybody in the crowd realized the emperor wasn’t wearing any clothes, we can sweep in and say, who’s asking to ban birth control? Who’s asking to ban these books? Who’s asking to take veterans’ benefits away? And then we come in and say, look, Kamala Harris is talking about making sure that you have expanded health care, making sure there’s daycare available, making sure that it’s easier to get free school lunches they’re talking about on a national level. That’s where that came from. And weird is — it’s specifically to him. I’m certainly not talking about Republicans. I’m not talking about the people who are at those rallies. I’m hearing this from my Republican friends because the people at those rallies, they’re the ones that can most benefit from the message we’re delivering. I looked at him the other night in St. Cloud, Minnesota, young women behind him. We’re going to provide reproductive care for them. I saw a group holding Somalis for Trump. We have a large Somali population. We’re very proud of that. Donald Trump has said we’re going to have a Muslim ban, and he talked about Congresswoman Omar and the Somali community as being so detrimental rather than an asset to this. So we’re going to take care of those people too. And I think this is where Trump and his people get so excited. What do they have if they don’t have that fear? What do they have if there’s not a dystopian society? What do they have if only dear leader can come in and fix it? If people are saying, actually, I’d like to have cheaper daycare. I’d actually like them to quit talking about this, and I really don’t care who somebody’s married to. Because I believe the vast majority of people really don’t want to be in other people’s bedrooms. And I use the thing of small town — this is where JD Vance doesn’t get it. You survive best by just mind your own damn business. Just stay out of people’s business. I want to get at this distinction you’re making between Trump or Vance or the leaders or the policy makers and the crowds. Because I think one of the most dangerous emotions that Democrats sometimes let slip, the sort of negative side of, I think, the liberal personality, can be a kind of contempt, a kind of smugness. This is why Hillary Clinton’s comment on deplorables was so damaging. There is a sense among many people that these educated liberals look down on them. They think they’re retrograde. They think they’re stupid. Republicans have a lot of negative personality traits, too — rage, anger, conspiratorial thinking. But condescension and smugness can be pretty lethal for Democrats. Agreed. One of the things I have heard some Democrats worry about as the whole party has taken up ‘weird’ all at once was — you have a very calibrated way of talking about this. Not everybody does. And it becoming a thing that it sounds like Democrats are saying about all these people who support Donald Trump and who do like him, all these people who feel left behind and left out of the Democratic coalition. How do you police that boundary? This is where I take offense to JD Vance and ‘Hillbilly Elegy.’ Those are my people. I come from a town of 400, 24 kids in a class, 12 cousins, farming, those types of things. That is there, and I know they’re not that. I know they’re not weird. I know they’re not Donald Trump. The thing is, we have to get them away from what he’s trying to sell because that’s not who they are. I mentioned — just picture in your mind Donald Trump coming home after a day of work and picking up a Frisbee and throwing it and his dog catches it and the dog runs over and he gives him a good belly rub because he’s a good boy. That’s what I do, and that’s what those rally goers do. That is exactly who they are. And they’re going through the same things all of our families are. He’s captured some of this because I think you’re right — you people have forgotten me or the entertainment value of whatever he’s done. And fear is scary. The world is changing. We’re seeing conflict in the Middle East. We saw a global pandemic, which he did nothing to fix but seized upon. And then I think it’s breaking that spell again of saying, look, he’s not offering you anything. And then we dang sure better be ready to offer something. If we can’t offer something that impacts their lives like these policies — that’s why I say Republicans, they may not admit it, they love the free school meals and lunch. I guarantee you a lot of them like paid family and medical leave. Small employers who couldn’t afford to compete against a Best Buy and Target, who offered paid family medical leave, now could offer and recruit employees. So now they’re saying, look, I’m paying a little bit into this. This program works. My employees are loyal to me. And boy, they can go home and be with their kids and keep them healthy. It’s just we have to show them that this isn’t — there’s nothing strange about this. They’ll try and say this is ultra liberal. That’s where we need to be more specific. Do you mean the free school lunches? Is that what — or the roads and bridges we built in this town? Is that what you’re speaking about? Governor, you spent a surplus money on this. Yeah, you mean when we eliminated Social Security tax for most of seniors? That’s the one that most bothers you? There’s never a specific. They don’t give you a specific on what the liberal agenda is. And we have to do a better job of saying this is what it is, this is the things that you’re getting."
