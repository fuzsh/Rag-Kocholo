        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - A Rutherford County community is asking for a miracle. Asher Sullivan, the 10-year-old son of the county superintendent, was sucked into a drain Wednesday and is now fighting for his life.\n\nIt took place in a Christiana neighborhood off Rhonda Drive. Neighbors said Asher Sullivan was in the drainage system for about 15 minutes until he got stuck by a branch. They said CPR was administered by first responders for about 10 minutes.\n\nHis family said Asher Sullivan is currently at Vanderbilt University Medical Center with severely damaged lungs and brain.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon hundreds of people went to the Rutherford County Schools Board of Education building to pray for Asher Sullivan during a vigil.\n\n“We all want to do something right now and the Sullivan family has requested that we pray and lift up Asher,” said Dr. Kay Martin with Rutherford County Schools to start the event.\n\nAs the son of Dr. James Sullivan, the Rutherford County Schools Director of Schools, the community knows the family well.\n\n“Is it because I’m a husband and father and I could relate to what he must be feeling at this time,” said Adam Keeton. “And I think that was part of it. But even more than that is Dr. Sullivan exuberates love for this community and the love for our students.”\n\nAt the same time on Thursday the Christiana neighborhood where the Sullivan’s live had their own vigil. WSMV4 spoke with neighbor Sandra Watts who saw the aftermath on Wednesday night.\n\n“The water was like Niagara Falls,” she said. “It just took him.”\n\nNeighbors said Asher lost his shoe in the water and went back for it. They said that’s when he was swept into the drainage system.\n\n“You never thought you can go down the drain,” said Watts. “But he went down the drain and all the drains that’s under the streets.”\n\nPeople nearby said he was gone for about 15 minutes and went about 500 yards. They said he was found outside a storm drain near a neighboring home.\n\n“One of his friends, he was all scraped up trying to save him,” said Watts. “It’s just very devastating.”\n\nNeighbors also said the Sullivan family has been through a lot in recent years. They said their other son fought cancer and is currently in remission."
