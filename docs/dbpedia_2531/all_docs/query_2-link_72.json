        "text": "If you have an 11-year-old boy, here is everything you need to know about how they are developing\n\nThe tween years are a period of considerable change. Once a boy reaches 11 years old, he is no longer a young child, but a preteen who is discovering the world.\n\nAt this age, boys undergo a lot of changes physically, emotionally, socially, and cognitively. Not only do they experience growth spurts in height, but they also have an increasing need to be independent and a desire to be accepted by their peers.\n\nDevelopmental milestones for an 11-year-old boy\n\nEach child is unique and develops at a different pace, but these developmental milestones are guidelines as to what to expect from an 11-year-old boy.\n\nPhysical milestones\n\nBig physical changes usually begin at about this age, although they can happen as early as 9 or as late as 14. Milestones in physical development include the following:\n\nGrowth of the testes (sometimes, one testis may grow faster than the other)\n\nGrowth of the penis\n\nDarkening of the scrotum\n\nGrowth of pubic, underarm, and facial hair\n\nSigns of puberty\n\nProduction of testosterone that stimulates the testes to produce sperm\n\nErections and ejaculation\n\nChange in voice (voice breaks and eventually deepens)\n\nChange in body shape and larger muscles\n\nSweat glands start to become active and may cause body odor\n\nOily hair and skin (sometimes acne)\n\nGrowth spurts and complaints of growing pain and muscle cramps\n\nSlight physical awkwardness because of sudden increase in height\n\nBigger appetite\n\nNeed for more sleep\n\nBetter hand-eye coordination\n\nImproved handwriting and ability to use various tools\n\nAbility to master complex integration of upper- and lower-extremity reciprocal actions\n\nEmotional milestones\n\nAge 11 is when boys find a sense of self-identity, independence, and moral values. Milestones in emotional development include the following:\n\nAnxious and uncertain about changes in their bodies\n\nExperience changes in mood and energy levels\n\nGo back and forth between feeling independent and needing parental support\n\nUnable to control and express intense emotions in a mature way\n\nBetter at understanding other people’s emotions\n\nFocus on personal appearance and become more self-conscious about their bodies\n\nMay suffer a drop in self-esteem\n\nAct without thinking that their actions have consequences\n\nDevelop better decision-making skills\n\nArgue and question authority figures\n\nArgue about rules and try to find loopholes in the rules\n\nJustify misbehavior by giving excuses\n\nMay experience their first crush or puppy love\n\nStart to resist physical affection from parents\n\nBegin to think more abstractly\n\nPromises become important to them\n\nSocial milestones\n\nMilestones in social development include the following:\n\nTry to establish their own identity through new attitudes, haircuts, clothing styles, hobbies, experiences, and friends\n\nBecome more independent and want to do things for themselves more\n\nStart forming stronger, complex friendships and peer relationships\n\nShow more interest in friends and less interest in family\n\nFriends are more likely to influence their appearance, interests, and behaviors\n\nMay experience strong peer pressure (boys struggling with low self-esteem may find it hard to resist negative peer pressure)\n\nLook for new experiences, including risky ones such as drinking, smoking, or self-harm.\n\nThink more about right and wrong\n\nStart developing their own values and moral\n\nStart to explore their sexual identity and have a new interest in romantic relationships and attractions to peers or celebrities\n\nMay have a first crush or pretend to have crushes to fit in with peers\n\nTest their limits and push boundaries\n\nMay exhibit antisocial behaviors\n\nBegin to show a competitive spark at this age, particularly in sports, as they start to spend more time and energy on their hobbies\n\nCognitive milestones\n\nAt the age of 11, boys start thinking more about abstract ideas and not just what they can observe. They get better at organizing thoughts and planning as well. Milestones in cognitive development include the following:\n\nBegin to rely on news, social media, and peers to get information and form opinions.\n\nCan argue more than just one side of an issue\n\nBecome more independent from their family\n\nDevelop a greater sense of responsibility and help around the house\n\nUnderstand that thoughts are private\n\nBegin to see others’ point of view\n\nStart to realize that the choices they make could have long-term effects\n\nStart predicting the consequences of an action and can plan accordingly\n\nStart understanding how things are connected\n\nHave more focus and increased attention span\n\nMemorize facts more easily.\n\nAsk more questions and check their work\n\nMay have a rapid change in interests\n\nMay begin to lose interest in school and face academic challenges\n\nSpeech and language milestones\n\nMost boys have a fairly large vocabulary by this age. They’re likely to have mastered different styles of language such as slang or inside jokes with friends but more formal language with a teacher.\n\nAny past speech issues usually will be resolved by this time. If speech difficulties are still a problem, they may require speech therapy to correct the issue.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://kidshealth.org/en/parents/checkup-11yrs.html\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle2.html"
