Forgotten Love aspires to epic importance and, at two hours and 20 minutes, it certainly qualifies based on running time. But a hokey premise underlies the dramatic sweep. Much of this story of a search for both a lost identity and a loved one will draw in an audience longing for romantic tragedy. But, that guilty pleasure aside, this is an absurd exercise in Polish magical realism. To fully buy in, we must believe that for the better part of 15 years, a man wanders about the countryside having no idea what his name is, where he came from, whether he has a family, or what he did with himself for the first 40 years of his life. He remembers absolutely nothing but the entire contents of his medical school education, how to wield a scalpel, how to treat a dislocated shoulder, how to perform, yes, brain surgery. This seems wildly, hilariously implausible.

And the fact that no one enjoying the benefits of Wilczur's treatments ever takes a moment to speculate that he might be an actual licensed physician also seems odd. A woman who abhors a dogged suitor suddenly changes her mind about him for no apparent reason. A woman steals surgical instruments, but a man confesses to taking them. Despite the movie's length, nothing develops naturally; it all just happens, just to move the plot along. The story is absurdly ridiculous, but good performances and the commitment of an all-in director make it kind of fun to watch.
