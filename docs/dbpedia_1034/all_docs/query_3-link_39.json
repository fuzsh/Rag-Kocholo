        "text": "\"Trouble Every Day\" is a song by The Mothers of Invention, released on their 1966 debut album Freak Out!.\n\nFrank Zappa wrote the song in 1965 at 1819 Bellevue Avenue, Echo Park, Los Angeles (the suburban residence of a methamphetamine chemist referred to by Zappa as \"Wild Bill the Mannequin-Fucker\")[1] after watching news coverage of the Watts Riots.[2] Originally dubbed \"The Watts Riot Song,\"[2] its primary lyrical themes are racial violence, social injustice, and sensationalist journalism. The musical style—featuring multiple guitar tracks and a harmonica—much more closely resembles electric blues than mainstream rock and roll.[3]\n\nProducer Tom Wilson of MGM Records signed the Mothers to a record deal on March 1, 1966, having heard only this song and believing them to be a \"white blues band\".[4] Together, they released \"Trouble Every Day\" as a single with B-side \"Who Are the Brain Police?\"[5]\n\nA re-arranged version appeared on the Mothers' 1974 LIVE album Roxy & Elsewhere (and on the 1991 live album The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life) as \"More Trouble Every Day.\"[6] These subsequent versions were more up-tempo and usually featured a strong horn intro and punctuation.\n\nThe UK underground artist Mick Farren covered the song on his album \"Vampires Stole My Lunch Money\" (1978).\n\nThe Frank Zappa tribute band Trouble Every Day named itself after this song.[7]\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nLowe, Kelly Fisher (2006).
