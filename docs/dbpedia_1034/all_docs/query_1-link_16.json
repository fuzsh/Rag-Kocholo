        "text": ".\n\nFrom the facebook “About” page of “The Broadcast Adventures of HowieZowie”:\n\n“Conceptual Continuity with HowieZowie” is a weekly two hour Zappa radio show broadcasting Thursday night at 10pm PST on Blue Mountain Radio KQBM-LP 103.7FM in West Point, California & KQBM 90.7FM in San Andreas, California – streaming live at http://www.kqbm.org. Saturday night at Midnight EST on WERU 89.9FM in Blue Hill, Maine/99.9FM in Bangor, Maine – streaming live/archiving at http://www.weru.org. Encore Saturday night at 11pm PST on Blue Mountain Radio KQBM-LP 103.7FM in West Point, California & KQBM 90.7FM in San Andreas, California – streaming live at http://www.kqbm.org.\n\nHere is the WERU Community Radio direct link to the Conceptual Continuity with HowieZowie archive page (only the last two episodes are available): click here.\n\nHowie Zowie, aka Howie Kittelson, is a London (Ontario) based radio personality with a taste for audio editing. He accurately selects music for the talk over sections of his shows, and with Zappa the result is remarkable! A two hours radio show like Conceptual Continuity with HowieZowie conveniently flows and you may get some CC clue.\n\nOn July 28, 2016 such an all Zappa show got 5 years old, Howie Zowie had Joe Travers as a guest and Spastic Droopers as secret word.\n\nJoe talked about The Crux of Biscuit / Frank Zappa for President new FZ releases and gives some cool hints for the releases to come, such as a Waka/Wazoo box set!\n\nWhat follows is a transcript of some parts of the conversation Howie and Joe had (thank you Howie for the accurate editing of my raw transcript!).\n\n29:47 (part 1) – Overture to Uncle Sam\n\nJoe Travers: It was for and in an Opera, and definitely was one of the later synclavier pieces of Frank’s – very very late in fact. We found some footage of Todd Yvega and Spencer Chrislu being interviewed for the American Composer radio documentary that happened in 1995.\n\nAnd they used that piece as a demonstration for the Synclavier at the time, so it was definitely one of the later pieces. And we founded it on a reel of Ensemble Modern rehearsals and performances that ended up becoming Everything is Healing Nicely.\n\nBut Frank put together a 40 minutes collage of that that audio, lot of stuff on the rehearsals and I think Spence based most of what he, what Frank put together for Everything is Healing Nicely, but also on it it was the Overture to Uncle Sam.\n\nI always kept that thing in my back pocket for some kind of release. Gail and I have talked about various different releases including that piece and then when Frank Zappa for President was offered to me as a project I really thought like that it would be a good thing to put it on there. And so that’s how ended up happening!\n\n46:43 (part 1) – If I was a President\n\nHowie Kittelson: I see that the musical track and the spoken words were done in different times, were they meant to go together from the beginning or is that something that you combined?\n\nJT: No, that’s something I combined.\n\nHK: In that aspect it is very reminiscent of Drooling Midrange Accountans in Easter Hay.\n\nJT: That was something Dweezil put together, obviously the same concept was used for the If I was a President thing.\n\n1:56 (part 2) – Brown Shoes Don’t Make It\n\nHK: I see that was a remix done in ’69 by Dick Kunk, correct?\n\nJT: Yes\n\nHK: Now, what was the purpose of that remix, what is that associated with?\n\nJT: We’ll never know. It is not listed as such, although my opinion is that it was probably remixed for some kind of film project.\n\nHZ: Gotcha.\n\nJT: But we don’t know what it is. I don’t know if it was Uncle Meat – I don’t know what that film project would be. But there’s a couple of other classic songs on that reel that were remix as well, so Brown Shoes is not the only one. But considering the theme of that song, I thought that it would be a good thing to put it on that album, because it’s an older Mothers song in a remixed form that nobody has ever heard before. So I figured that it would tie in with that record.\n\n3:27 (part 2) – Amnerika\n\nJT: It was recorded during the Thing-Fish sessions – and all I can say is that piece, the vocal version of that song was intended for one of the volumes of The Lost Episodes project, because The Lost Episodes one time was kind of worked into a three volume project. Ans since Frank brought The Lost Episodes down to one disc, then there was a bunch of leftovers and that happened to be one of the leftovers. We do have the ability to do another Lost Episodes volume from those leftovers, but Gail was basically using a lot of stuff from that for other projects, or at least wanted me to. So, I figured – well this is the perfect time for this song for this project. I have to come up with content somehow, even if we kind of repeat things maybe once in a while in future releases, at least I was able to do what I was told and putting together that Frank Zappa for President record, so that’s where that song ended up!\n\n19:23 (part 2) – The Crux of the Biscuit\n\nHK: I have always wondered to myself: was the use of apostrophe in so many blues song titles, could that have been an inspiration on Frank when he came to the apostrophe?\n\nJT: Hmmmm, I don’t know – I’m not sure. I wish I could answer that (laughs).\n\nHZ: Do you have your own theory about the apostrophe?\n\nJT: I really don’t know (laughs), Dweezil kind of explains The Crux of the Biscuit on dweezilzappaworld.com – I think, as far as like the term, what that means, what the apostrophe stands for – so you can check that out.\n\n29:20 (part 2) – Apostrophe (‘) early side one – Cosmik Debris\n\nHK: The version of Cosmik Debris that opens that – the new 2016 intro, is that your doing?\n\nJT: No, that was found that way and the mix of the song is the exact same mix that’s on the Apostrophe(‘) album, Frank took up that intro, and so when I found that early sequence of side one, that intro was on the version of Cosmik Debris on that tape, so I left it. Anything different applies to those kind of releases, that was Frank – that was recorded that way!\n\n34:38 (part 2) – work mixes\n\nHZ: So, when we’re looking at the tracks that are labeled as mix outtakes. Those are just working mixes from the process of doing the record?\n\nJT: Yeah, exactly. Like you have a mix session and during the mix session you run off various work mixes or mixes in progress, or mixes that might be used as a master – or might not be. Anything that was mixed and was going to be on master at one point would be an alternate mix, because that was alternate to what was used. But anything that was mixed that wasn’t going to be used for any kind of a master, but it was a work mix or an outtake for the mix session, I just labelled as such.\n\n35:26 (part 2) – Uncle Remus\n\nJT: Yeah, that’s pretty great! Because you get to hear a piano solo and an extra bit of vocals and stuff like that, it was pretty cool!\n\nHZ: And some cool organ – I don’t know if that was a B-3, but there was some really tasty, traditional organ going on there that I am not used to hearing in that song.\n\nJT: Yeah – well, that song was recorded during demo sessions of George Duke during the Paramount Studio time period in April of ’72. The Grand Wazoo and Waka- Jawaka have just been recorded and Frank produced about four tunes for George Duke around that time and Uncle Remus was one of those songs – and then Frank obviously used Uncle Remus in Apostrophe(‘). Then George Duke went on to re-record the other songs that were recorded for that demo session on two other albums. Psychosomatic Dung is one of them, and For Love (I Come Your Friend) – that’s another one that’s one of those songs that was recorded during that demo session.\n\n36:41 (part 2) – Waka-Jawaka / Grand Wazoo box set\n\nJT: I’m going to be working on a Hot Rats/Grand Wazoo box set, I guess you might want to call it – or a CD release of all the alternates and all the stuff that was recorded during that time period. And I am hoping to get those George Duke tunes on there as well, so that would be something cool. Yeah, it’s Waka Jawaka and Grand Wazoo, sorry – Hot Rats was not recorded during that same time. You know, obviously that was ’69. But Waka and Grand Wazoo that was all recorded at the same time, and along with those George Duke songs it kind of captures the same musicians, the same time period and the same sound. So, all that stuff would be a good companion release.\n\n41:50 (part 2) – Energy Frontier flute\n\nJT: I tried to track down who would have been, but nobody knows! Maybe the fans somehow can get that information – because they’re so hard core. I was unable to determine it because there were no session sheets, and so it’s hard for me to know. And I had a conversation with Dave Parlato. Dave Parlato played bass in the Petite Wazoo time period, and The Grand Wazoo – and recorded some stuff with Frank. And he is the guy who is playing stand-up bass on those songs – or at least on one version of that song. And so Dave and I had a conversation, and he is the one that identified himself on there. And he talked about the Jack Bruce session, talked about how Jack Bruce had a rented…I think it was a cello, and it sounded horrible and he couldn’t make the thing work at all, so they kind of ditched that idea of having Jack Bruce play cello. But, Dave didn’t know who played flute either. And first thing I thought of was it had to have been maybe somebody who was touring with Frank at the time. But in the Petite Wazoo the only person that maybe could have done that was Earl Dumler, and we’re not really sure he was him or not. And I didn’t get a chance to get in touch with Earl before the release of the record. So – maybe he is him, maybe he is not. Who knows!\n\n43:31 (part 2) – bass lines\n\nHZ: I found it pretty interesting listening to Dave Parlato’s bass line on take four of Energy Frontier because I’ve gotten quite used to a lot of brass bands using the tuba to do bass lines and they kind of emulate the phrasing of a stand-up bass – but he sounded like he was playing tuba lines on the stand-up bass! So it was a very interesting part of the spectrum and part of the mix that he was in and that stood out to me. I read somewhere that Dave Parlato is the originator of the “Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow” phrase – that he looked out the window of the tour bus and he saw a dog peeing in the snow and he yelled out, “Don’t eat the yellow snow!”\n\nJT: Well I don’t know if that’s true – that could be very true. I don’t know. But, I do know that the bass line if you listen very close to the song called Trudging Across Tundra which is on One Shot Deal, that is an improvisation that happened during a concert in the Petite Wazoo time period… and if you listen to the bass line of that, and if you listen to the early version of Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow that was released on Crux, you’ll notice that it’s almost the same! So the root of the bass line to the opening of Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow come from an improvisational jam from the Petite Wazoo time period, which we released.\n\n49:02 (part 2) – Vaultmaster since 1995\n\nJT: I love my job, I’m very grateful for it. I spent so much time in my life just studying the music and being part of the music – so I’m happy that I can share the things that I find with people that appreciate it, you know? It’s really a special thing that I do and I realize that. I was a fan first before any of this stuff, so I come from a fan point of view and I think about the things that people would love to hear and would really want to hear.\n\n51:28 (part 2) – Uncle Meat Project/Object and vinyl reissues\n\nJT: The Uncle Meat Project/Object is gonna be coming right around the corner pretty soon, so that’s very exciting. And also there’s going to be a lot of vinyl reissues this year, starting next month in August Hot Rats is going to be re-released on vinyl. But we’re going to be doing a lot more this year. We usually do about one to two releases – reissues on vinyl for the past few years, along with little exclusive stuff that we’ve done for the Record Store Days. But this year we’re gonna be doing a lot more – and that does include the Record Store Day stuff. So, we’ll be doing something really cool for Black Friday Record Store Day and we’re gonna be doing a number of other vinyl reissues this year before the year’s over with. So that’s something that’s gonna be exciting…for the audiophile world, you know, that loves the vinyl.\n\n54:40 (part 2) – just one Zappa piece of choice for The Vaultmaster\n\nJT: Rat Tomago\n\n.\n\nThe 1995 Radio documentary mentioned by Joe was available at the zappa.com and was described as: “a two hour Radio Documentary produced by Steve Rowland and Gail Zappa for “The Music Makers” Series on Public Radio International, originally aired on U.S. radio in the summer of 1996.”\n\nWhat follows is a direct link for the first hour of the show, the first minute of Overture to Uncle Sam starts at 08:08.\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/483513/1995TheMusicMakers_FZ/zappa_americancomposer01.mp3\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOut of the blue, on June 9, while many had been pondering about trustees and beneficiaries of the Zappa integrity and of his overwhelming and strangely managed output, ZFT trustees announced the world, including beneficiaries of any sort, two new releases due to July 15.\n\nFrank Zappa for President? You betcha! We know at various times he wanted to run for office. In the spirit of the dramatic 2016 presidential election adventures comes a release that gives us a glimpse into what could have been. This album is comprised of unreleased compositions realized on the Synclavier, along with other relevant tracks mined from the Vault, with a political thread tying it all together. Don’t forget to register and vote!\n\nThe Crux of the Biscuit was created in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of Frank Zappa’s 1974 album Apostrophe(‘). As part of Zappa Records’ ongoing Frank Zappa Project/Object Audio Documentary Series, it contains rare alternate mixes, live performances, and studio session outtakes. This release celebrates Zappa’s iconic, Gold-certified album, which landed in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200 albums chart.\n\nsource: zappa.com\n\n.\n\nUnreleased synclavier compositions, never heard before mixes of ’60s and ’70s classics, nuggets that shed new light on the studio compositional process, live episodes relevant to two basic themes: the President of the USA and 42 years of trudging across the tundra.\n\nIn summary: succulent!\n\nHowever from the outer FZ space perspective, I can’t help feeling still scary of the future, and I do hope the Zappas will be able to continue digging the vault, and I also hope the “cease and desist” nightmare will not happen as it does in the darkest canyons of my mind.\n\nBut forget about this mess for a couple of hours, take a deep breath and immerse in these two albums.\n\n– ;- {= –\n\nThe Crux Of The Biscuit\n\n1 Cosmik Debris 4:21\n\n2 Uncle Remus (Mix Outtake) 3:59\n\n3 Down In De Dew (Alternate Mix) 3:16\n\n4 Apostrophe’ (Mix Outtake) 9:07\n\n5 The Story Of “Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow/St. Alphonzo’s Pancake Breakfast” 2:25\n\n6 Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow/St. Alphonzo’s Pancake Breakfast (Live) 19:26\n\n7 Excentrifugal Forz (Mix Outtake) 1:34\n\n8 Energy Frontier (Take 4) 3:04\n\n9 Energy Frontier (Take 6 With Overdubs) 4:15\n\n10 Energy Frontier (Bridge) 8:23\n\n11 Cosmik Debris (Basic Tracks-Take 3) 5:11\n\n12 Don’t Eat The Yellow (Basic Tracks-Alternate Take) 2:12\n\n13 Nanook Rubs It (Basic Tracks-Outtake) 0:42\n\n14 Nanook Rubs It (Session Outtake) 0:48\n\n15 Frank’s Last Words . . . 0:16\n\nProduced by Gail Zappa and Joe Travers\n\nVaultmeisterment and audio transfers by Joe Travers\n\nMastering: Bob Ludwig\n\nNew mixes: Craig Parker Adams, 2014\n\nCover photograph: Yoram Kahana (probably) [uncredited]\n\nOther photography: Emerson/Loew, Mark Aalyson, Jeffrey Mayer, Michael Mesker\n\nIllustration: David Calcano/Christian Garcia\n\nArt direction: Ahmet Zappa\n\nPackage design: Michael Mesker\n\nLiner notes: Simon Prentis\n\nProduction Manager: Melanie Starks\n\n.\n\nFor most listeners, Apostrophe(‘) is mainly the place where snow is yellow and feet stink. Also, the Bromhidrosis epic is where THE question arises: “What is your Conceptual Continuity?” Since the easy to be seen answer is “The crux of the biscuit is the Apostrophe(‘)”, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of one of the best known FZ albums without Stink-foot – hence without Fido who will eternally bring those stink-fated slippers and gives THE answer – is like giving praise to Don Quixote not mentioning Sancho.\n\nLet’s commemorate such conspicuous absence with the commercial that inspired a distinguished dog-man relationship (relevant scene at 0:17):\n\n.\n\nThat said, The Crux Of The Biscuit is a must for hard-core fanatics due to plenty exquisite episodes, and may have a lot of interest for the rest of the world, for instance for the main Yellow Snow celebration, almost 20 minutes live from Hordern Pavillon, Sydney, June 1973, a tape that should become road, if you know what I mean.\n\nThe album, possibly the last produced by Gail and Joe, starts with a proto Apostrophe(‘) side A (tracks 1-4) whose main interest is the dynamic duo Down in the Dew/Apostrophe’, new to mankind as a dual system. Simon Prentis, who delivered a truly relevant piece of zappology as liner notes, gives information and his own view about Energy Frontier, the original title of such a double jam sessions. Simon quotes a well-known Zappa statement:\n\nQ: What about playing with (bass guitarist) Jack Bruce on Apostrophe?\n\nFZ: Well, that was just a jam thing that happened because he was a friend of (drummer) Jim Gordon. I found it very difficult to play with him; he’s too busy. He doesn’t really want to play the bass in terms of root functions; I think he has other things on his mind. But that’s the way jam sessions go.\n\n“Frank Zappa”\n\nBy Steve Rosen\n\nGuitar Player, January, 1977\n\n.\n\nThen he reports (via joe Travers) that those Dew/Apostrophe’ jams were all recorded on November 8, 1972, also with an unknown flute player on tracks 8 and 9. As effectively remarked by Prentis, the subsequent work has been an editing matter, that night after night shortened Jack Bruce contribution and brought Down in the Dew out (later to emerge for Läther without Jack Bruce in a version near to track 3). What is presented here (proto tracks 3 and 4, and jam tracks 8-10) is the evidence of a process that started with a jam session, continued with a proto dual system (with Bruce in Apostrophe’ only) and ended as we know it simply as Apostrophe’. Thanks to this album, now we know better why Zappa said that Bruce was “busy”, it seems that such a one-day encounter didn’t give what could be theoretical expected in terms of interplay, but the way the bass guitar of Jack Bruce sounds in these unreleased jams is gorgeous (a FZ post-production?) and some of his lines are truly remarkable (like those delivered into the first minute of the original Apostrophe’ – and of track 4 – that give a clear mark to that jam).\n\nSo editing as a major Zappa craft and practice, and “omission” as a keyword to guide the transition from the on-field recorded matter to the edited recorded object to be released. That is one the main subjects of the liner notes, fully available through simonprentis.net, a must read!\n\nAnd omission is at work within lyrics too, significance is often hidden or lies on a metaphoric level, or may be even almost faint in cases when information is delivered for conceptual continuity purpose only.\n\nThe Crux Of The Biscuit, and its liner notes, brought this blog to closely consider the mysterious and elliptic lyrics for Excentrifugal Forz (a Mix Outtake belongs to this album too) and hopefully get nearer to some of the omitted points. See what you think:\n\n– ;- {= –\n\nThe clouds are really cheap\n\n[Reality is not so interesting]\n\nThe way I seen ’em thru the ports\n\n[That’s how it looks to me]\n\nOf which there is a half-a-dozen\n\n[A little part of it]\n\nOn the base of my resorz\n\n[Is what I have been doing]\n\nYou wouldn’t think I’d have too many\n\n[From everyone point of view, a very little part]\n\nSince I never cared for sports\n\n[Because I’m an outsider]\n\nBut I’m never really lonely\n\n[But I don’t care to be seen/understood]\n\nIn my Excentrifugal Forz\n\n[My nature is to escape from what is accepted by most people]\n\nThere’s always Korla Plankton\n\n[And if I feel too much out of reality (as Korla Pandit do!)]\n\nHim ‘n me can play the blues\n\n[I can always play the blues]\n\nAn’ then I’ll watch him buff that\n\n[And I will enjoy shining every single blues canon]\n\nTiny ruby that he use\n\n[… canon …]\n\nHe’ll straighten up his turban\n\n[… canon …]\n\nAn’ eject a little ooze\n\n[… canon …]\n\nAlong a one-celled Hammond Organism\n\n[The blues is an archetypal culture, as one-celled organisms are archaic forms of life]\n\nUnderneath my shoes\n\n[And it is part of me, deeply]\n\nAn’ then I’ll call PUP TENTACLE\n\n[I can also get inspiration from cheap monsters]\n\n[The monster in Cheepnis, a “pup tent affair”, seems to be recalled here, as noted elsewhere by Simon Prentis, it may represent one of those “clouds”, or reality as constructed/perceived by most people]\n\nI’ll ask him how’s his chin\n\n[I can image further mutations]\n\nI’ll find out\n\n[And doing so]\n\nHow the future is\n\n[Time as everyone knows it]\n\nBecause that’s where he’s been\n\n[Loses in significance]\n\nHis little feet got long ‘n flexible\n\n[And I found myself on a spherical time constant]\n\nAn’ suckers fell right in\n\n[Far from what is accepted by most people]\n\nThe time he crossed the line\n\n[That’s where my mutations live]\n\nFrom LATER ON to WAY BACK WHEN\n\n[Because when I deal with my favorite mutations, before and after do not make sense anymore]\n\n– ;- {= –\n\nA few more remarks are needed to close the not yellow side of this album, discussion is open at zappateers and other FZ loci. Cosmik Debris (track 1) opens with an unheard before brass intro. This version of Uncle Remus includes new and not to be missed Ikettes embroideries, but also further gorgeous George keyboard treatments. Apostrophe’ (mix outtake) shares the drum intro with Stink-foot (the only link discovered so far with the Fido song). The two Energy Frontier takes are two different Down in Dew versions with Jack Bruce, Energy Frontier (Bridge) is actually an early version of Apostrophe’. Cosmik Debris (Basic Tracks-Take 3) includes a new bluesy FZ solo and is a no vocals version to be sang to!\n\nThe Crux Of The Biscuit starts dealing with Yellow Snow with the words of FZ introducing this new piece in 1973. He tells how he was also inspired by an Imperial Margarine commercial, “Good morning, your highness!” comes from it. Unfortunately only a bad quality recording of such a promotional feature survives into the Internet, but it is worth watching anyway (the “black gentleman” commercial starts at 01:02).\n\n.\n\nMargarine inspired also the 1973 Mar-Juh-Rene routine, well-known but officially released only in 2008 in One Shot Deal as part of Australian Yellow Snow. This routine is also included here in track 6 which is an extended version of the Yellow Snow suite, also including Rollo and part of the Steno Pool section of Greggery Peccary. Both versions derive from the June 24-26, 1973 Sydney concerts, once again, road one please!\n\nIn his Zappa dissertation, Tomasz Michalak digs into significance and symbols related to the apostrophe and hyphen (“something that might be used for erotic gratification by a very desperate stenographer”) signs. He also quotes FZ who recalls a linguistic inspiration for Yellow Snow in two different interviews:\n\nI had a conversation in approximately 1972 with a schoolteacher in Kansas. She taught English. And she was talking about the way language works. And her point was that any language develops for a culture based on the things that the culture needs to talk about. And as an example she said in Eskimo language they have, you know, a whole number of different words for snow because snow is their life. And she was the one who said maybe they even have something for yellow snow, which you wouldnít want to eat it. And thatís what gave me the idea. (FZ, interviewed by Jim Ladd, August 1, 1989)\n\nAnd:\n\nas an example she talked about the Eskimo language, which she said had twenty words for snow because it was so important to them. And she actually made the comment that probably in the Eskimo language there was some sort of warning for children not to eat yellow snow. And thatís where the idea came from. (FZ, interviewed by Allan Handelman, East Coast Live, June 6, 1993)\n\nQuoted (P.293) into\n\n“THE MEGAPHONE OF DESTINY-” COMPOSITION, VOICE, AND MULTITUDE IN THE AUDITORY AVANT-GARDE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: GERTRUDE STEIN, SAMUEL BECKETT, JOHN CAGE, AND FRANK ZAPPA\n\nTomasz Zbigniew Michalak\n\nA THESIS SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY in The Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies (English Literature) THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA (Vancouver)\n\nDecember 2013\n\n.\n\nThe album closes with three early snippets from the Yellow Snow suite and a last brief track with Frank stopping the tape. Very hard-core maniac type stuff with no commercial potential at all, enjoyable for a limited audience such as Rne who noticed in his “rudimentary notes” that “the marimba figure and the laughs that were inserted at the very end of “Father O’Blivion” in the Apostrophe (‘) album” are included in Frank’s Last Words… .\n\nFor the full story of the Yellow Snow suite I would recommend a brief article by Charles Ulrich hosted on the ARF web site: “Some notes on the Yellow Snow suites permutations”\n\nFinally the original artwork for the back of the CD inlay deserve to be mentioned. It’s a Zappa cereal box probably illustrated by David Calcano of Fantoons Animation Studio in Los Angeles. Here it is with some details (click the images to enlarge them).\n\n.\n\nFor further notes on the cover of the album refer to the Information Is Not Knowledge (IINK) web site, at the beginning of the Apostrophe (‘) notes page.\n\n– ;- {= –\n\nFrank Zappa For President\n\n1 Overture To “Uncle Sam” 15:16\n\n2 Brown Shoes Don’t Make It (Remix) 7:27\n\n3 Amnerika (Vocal Version) 3:10\n\n4 “If I Was President” 3:43\n\n5 When The Lie’s So Big 3:38\n\n6 Medieval Ensemble 6:31\n\n7 America The Beautiful (Bates/Ward; Traditional) 3:36\n\nProduced for release by Ahmet Zappa & Joe Travers\n\nVaultmeisterment, transfers and compilation by Joe Travers\n\nMastering: Gavin Lurssen & Reuben Cohen\n\nArt direction: Ahmet Zappa\n\nArt, layout: Keith Lawler\n\nProduction management: Melanie Starks\n\nCover art details available at the proper IINK web page.\n\n.\n\nIf The Crux of the Biscuit objective as an Audio Documentary is very well stated and accomplished (including omissions), with the support of informative and in-depth liner notes, Frank Zappa for President appears like an unglued sequence of nuggets and lush unreleased pieces joined together by a political thread that ends up to be too weak in absentia.\n\nAlso, from a hard-core fanatic perspective the album is full of interest beside the basic theme, but such material would have deserved more informative liner notes.\n\nTake Overture To “Uncle Sam” for instance, since this piece is in the repertoire of Ensemble Ascolta for the never released project Ascolta Plays Zappa, it would have been very interesting to hear their point of view about this composition dated 1993. And why not take them for a note to the other synclavier material included?\n\nPart of Overture To “Uncle Sam” has been premiered by the Ascolta ensemble at Radialsystem, Berlin, July 14, 2007 (the 0:00 – 4:49 section). An excerpt (2:35 – 4:49) is available through their web site.\n\nhttp://www.ascolta.de/_obj/698E13B0-FE70-4A57-A5DA-A9DF78121C89/inline/Uncle-Sam.mp3\n\n.\n\nThe version included here is ten minutes longer than the Ascolta one and features the sonic palette typical of the late FZ synclavier works that can be heard in Civilazion Phase III and Dance Me This. Also, Overture To “Uncle Sam” should have a close relationship with the Wolf Harbor suite. No link instead with Dio Fa (the abandoned FZ opera project) as elsewhere stated in this blog (the notes to the Berlin, July 14, 2007 Ascolta ensemble concert program led to this probably false conjecture: “planned as an overture to an opera for La Scala in Milan, world premiere”).\n\nTo focus on the right Uncle Sam / Wolf Harbor setting you should go back to the liner notes to Dance Me This:\n\nOver the years I had seen Frank jump from project to project often shelving one indefinitely to focus on another. There was an elaborate stage piece titled Dio Fa; An opera titled Uncle Sam (about a dystopian future America with a ludicrously polluted New York Harbour); A music notation book with accompanying audio disc titled The Rhythmic Sadist’s Guide to Drum Patterns for the 21st Century.\n\nTodd Yvega–\n\nIn his vision for a staged presentation for modern dance [FZ] described how he wanted to represent Wolf Harbor (do the research on this place which really does exist): Groups of dancers side by side would hold long rolled out lengths of black trash bags (think Hefty) and “wave” them at waist (waste) height to signify the dark and murky polluted waters of sludgy Wolf Harbor.\n\nGail Zappa–\n\n.\n\nA sort of unresolved melancholy in a suspended time environment is a feeling common to both compositions. The difference resides in how the tension ends up to be unresolved. In Wolf Harbor tension is low and everywhere, time is suspended, no resolution allowed.\n\nOverture To “Uncle Sam” features a main melodic (and melancholic) material used as opening and with some variations at 02:02, 05:58 and 11:08. Right after every variation tension grows and its resolution seems to happen when the listener recognizes the melodic material, but relief is denied when he realizes that melancholy is still there. The finale is true Zappa: tension grows again and closes with a sort of brief broadway hoopla!\n\nThe illusion of a resolution results to be more effective than no resolution at all!\n\nHoopla! back to 1966/1969, Frank Zappa for President brings the listener to a never heard before remixed version of Brown Shoes Don’t Make It, a pleasure for everyone, especially for those who spent countless time with this 1966 sonic movie and will recognize all details changed in this remix. Acoustic ensemble is often clearer and the overall sound image results spatially enriched. In this case also it would have been much interesting to know what was the purpose of such a 1969 remix. Rejected for the 1969 Mothermania (which included the 1966 mix)?\n\nNo particular questions to ask for Amnerika (Vocal Version), a well-known (for FZ tape traders) and beautiful unreleased Thing-Fish outtake that needed to be released. Maybe one: why it has been rejected?\n\n“If I Was President” is Zappa explaining in 1990 why he “wouldn’t campaign” but “file as a candidate of no party” with a 1985 synclavier background (for the full text transcript please refer to the relevant IINK web page). Was it a Zappa produced audio object?\n\nAn unreleased 1988 When The Lie’s So Big take follows, politics is of course the rationale for the inclusion, however the hard-core fanatic (the main audience for this album) attention declines, this version does not add zappology elements (except for some slight changes in the lyrics) and it does not give particular help to the flow of the program.\n\nFor the next Medieval Ensemble, an unreleased 1985 synclavier composition, attention is back. It sounds like a Jazz From Hell outtake, a long march with no resolution with a medieval flavor, could be used for the eternally postponed Terry Gilliam Don Quixote!\n\nThe album closes with another 1988 episode. The America The Beautiful version digitally (mp3 only) released in The Frank Zappa AAA·FNR·AAA Birthday Bundle 21.Dec.2008 Nice to have it in a good audio quality (but strangely different from the official 1988 releases), relevant to the main theme, but in an album of unreleased material and with a surprising 1969 mix of a classic, the role of this song is simply to close the curtain.\n\nNow I’m wondering, in an album like this, where politics in America is a theme sometimes loose (Medieval Ensemble?!?), why do not take advantage of the lines:\n\nCould result in the end\n\nTo a worrisome trend\n\nIn which every American\n\nNot “born again”\n\nCould be punished in cruel and unusual ways\n\nBy this treacherous cretin\n\nWho tells everyone\n\nThat he’s Jesus’ best friend\n\nto include another bundle nugget that unethically still remains unreleased in a lossless audio standard? I’m thinking to Treacherous Cretins from The Frank Zappa AAA·FNRAA·AA Birthday Bundle 21.Dec.2010, a killer version that needs to expand its audience.\n\nMoreover, can you spot any treacherous cretins somewhere in this 2016 USA campaign?\n\n.\n\n.\n\na Zappadan Conceptual Continuity Cruise\n\n.\n\n.\n\ndedicated to the surrealistic memory of Dominique Jeunot (1959-2004)\n\n.\n\nA classic start, first song, first album.\n\n∴ – Hungry Freaks Daddy (Freak Out!) – ∴\n\nLyrics deals with some typical US amnesias, fact that brings straight to:\n\n∴ – Amnerika (Civilization Phaze III) – ∴\n\nThis melody appeared for the first time in the background of:\n\n∴ – That Evil Prince (Thing Fish) – ∴\n\nHarry and Rhonda talk about the Evil Prince with Thing-Fish who remarks:\n\nNext item de boy be inventin’ come under de headin’ o’ industrial pollutium!\n\nIt’s easy now to go trudging across:\n\n∴ – Nine Types of Industrial Pollution (Uncle Meat) – ∴\n\nZappa talked about this piece with Bob Marshall, on October 22, 1988:\n\nBob Marshall: What are the ‘Nine Types of Industrial Pollution’? Because it seems these old institutions are running amuck with these old techniques, and they’re out of control. They clash with different media, different institutions, and different professions.\n\nFrank Zappa: The funny thing about that song title is that, at the time that it was put on Uncle Meat, there was no such thing as a concern over industrial pollution. It hadn’t even been brought up as a topic. I put that on that song just as a joke after driving through New Jersey.\n\nBob Marshall: So, there were not nine, you had not categorized…\n\nFrank Zappa: Here I could see nine on that one trip. There may be more.\n\nBob Marshall: The term was not in the regular media…\n\nFrank Zappa: No.\n\nAnd also, on the musical side, what follows is an interesting view from feetlightup for the zappa.com forum.\n\nI was listening to this on headphones the other day and heard some stuff for the first time. It seems that the basic rhythm track is a fairly simple slow blues track (bass, drums, organ), but with all of those percussion instruments dubbed on top, it sounds like it’s more freeform than it actually is! It’s also pretty clear to me now that Frank’s guitar is actually a fairly bluesy lead, but when sped up and superimposed over this background, it too sounds fairly “out there”. And GET THIS: Way in the background of one of the channels, the whole time you can hear (I think) Frank’s ORIGINAL guitar lead, played at normal speed! Just shows what you can do in the studio with some pretty basic ingredients and a hell of a lot of creativity.\n\nAn early move towards Xenochrony?\n\n∴ – Friendly Little Finger (Zoot Allures) – ∴\n\nFrom The Guitar World According To Frank Zappa cassette liner notes to this song:\n\n[…] recorded in a dressing room at Hofstra University and over- dubbed at the Record Plant, Los Angeles, California; […] This is one of the earliest examples of a technique I developed called Xenochrony (strange synchronizations).\n\nMore about this subject in “WE ARE The Mothers… AND THIS IS WHAT WE SOUND LIKE!” (Mix, January 2003, Chris Michie):\n\nZappa dubbed the technique “xenochrony,” from the Greek words xeno (strange or alien) and chrono (time). As he explained, “In this technique, various tracks from unrelated sources are randomly synchronized with each other to make a final composition with rhythmic relationships unachievable by other means.” For example, in the case of the Zoot Allures track “Friendly Little Finger,” the solo guitar and bass were recorded in a dressing room on a 2-track Nagra and then later combined with an unrelated drum track for a piece called “The Ocean Is The Ultimate Solution,” with additional instrumentation scored to complement the newly produced time signatures. Xenochrony proved to be a powerful new compositional tool for Zappa, and he returned to it many times over later albums.\n\nLet’s move then to such drum track in his first environment:\n\n∴ – The Ocean Is The Ultimate Solution (Sleep Dirt) – ∴\n\nAnd talking about the ocean:\n\n∴ – Outrage At Valdez (Yellow Shark) – ∴\n\nFrank Zappa’s interest in the tank vessel accident on March 24, 1989, causing environmental disaster and worldwide protest came as a mild but not irrational surprise. His commitment lead to the friendship with Jacques Cousteau and to composing the soundtrack for a documentary, Alaska: Outrage At Valdez about the accident and its consequences in the Prince William Sound, Alaska (from the wiki jawaka article).\n\nAnd from here, FNRAA, I would like to jump to the LSO, one of the most important, though controversial FZ orchestral projects, for a less known composition:\n\n∴ – Sad Jane (London Symphony Orchestra Vols. I & II) – ∴\n\nIs that a pun on Lou Reed’s Sweet Jane? Anyways, in the words of Frank Zappa (“Non-Foods: Not The Moody Blues“, Guitar Player, November 1983):\n\nThe last movement of “Sad Jane,” kind of a marching thing, is actually a transcription of a guitar solo from the Shrine Auditorium, 1968, that Ian Underwood wrote out back then, and I came across one day in a pile of papers. I played it on the piano and liked the tune, and proceeded to orchestrate it.\n\nAnd for another example of this technique:\n\n∴ – Big Swifty (Waka-Jawaka) – ∴\n\nAgain Zappa reports (from The Complete History Of The Few Last Weeks Of The Mothers Of Invention):\n\nThis piece (which comprises all of Side One of the HOT RATS Waka/Jawaka album) presents a theme in rapidly alternating time signatures, a few solos, and an out-chorus done up in a sort of Prom Night orchestration which suspends the opening rhythmic structure over a straight 4/4 accompaniment.\n\nThe restatement of the theme is actually derived from a guitar solo on the album which Sal Marquez took down on paper. After about an hour of wheeling the tape back and forth, Sal managed to transcribe this rhythmically deranged chorus (I don’t have the ability to do this kind of musical dictation, but, since Marquez had a full-bore education at North Texas University, he had it covered). After he’d written it out, we proceeded to over-dub three trumpets on it, and, presto! An organized conclusion for “Big Swifty.”\n\nThe title itself brings the cruiser straight into:\n\n∴ – The Adventures of Greggery Peccary (Studio Tan) – ∴\n\nWhere “Big Swifty and Associates” is Greggery’s office. This adventurous piece includes the “Who is making those new brown clouds?” theme that occurs again in:\n\n∴ – For Calvin and His Next Two Hitch-Hikers (The Grand Wazoo) – ∴\n\nZappa (from The Complete History Of The Few Last Weeks Of The Mothers Of Invention):\n\nThis is dedicated to Calvin Schenkel, a long-time friend who has been responsible to a large extent for anything graphic/visual associated with the M.O.I. (from album covers to billboards to the animated sequence in 200 Motels).\n\nThere are lyrics to this piece (which has already been recorded and is set for a fall release in the impending Grand Wazoo album), but we are performing an instrumental version for these concerts. The story depicted in the lyrics refers to a mysterious “Schenkel Mirage” which occurred while he was driving to work. The details are a bit deep, but perhaps you can use your imagination and extrapolate a situation from the text.\n\nAlso, Calvin steps in on Lumpy Gravy saying “That’s very distraughtening.”\n\n∴ – Very Distraughtening (Lumpy Gravy) – ∴\n\nShortly thereafter, Spider says:\n\nEverything in the universe is . . . is . . . is made of one element, which is a note, a single note. Atoms are really vibrations, you know, which are extensions of THE BIG NOTE, everything’s one note.\n\nThis is it, this is THE BIG NOTE, a central idea for the whole Zappa body of work. The composer was fascinated by unifying theories. Here is what he tells to the interviewer in The Frank Zappa Interview Picture Disk (pt.2, circa 1984):\n\nWell … in physics they have this thing that they’ve been looking for – it’s the Unified Field Theory that explains the interrelationship between how gravity works and atomic energy and all this stuff – they’re looking for one equation that explains it all and makes it work because right now there’s contradictions. And … let’s just say that the book is like a Unified Field Theory that will hold together “Billy The Mountain”, “Greggery Peccary”, “Joe’s Garage” “Them Or Us”, “Thing-Fish” … all these different stories, it shows you how they work together to make one long, really complicated story. And the “Them Or Us” album is only one part of this major release that is coming out this year.\n\n∴ – Them or Us (Them or Us) – ∴\n\nThat is a Black Page #2 guitar solo performed in Bolzano on July 3, 1982. Though edited as usual, a full version from a few days earlier show (June 26, Munich) is included in You Can’t Do That On Stage Anymore Vol. 5. YCDTOSA is a series of 6 double cds consisting of live recordings spanning Frank Zappa’s entire career. He started working on this project in 1988 and concluded Volumes 5 and 6 in 1992 (I’m particularly fond of this series and in the 90’s I used to maintain a special purpose document: “Cruising with YCDTOSA“, almost all infos are now conveniently available through the Information Is Not Knowledge web site).\n\nIn the liner notes he reports the “theoretical questions” he asked himself to compile the series. One of them is:\n\n[6] will it give “conceptual continuity clues” to the hard core maniacs with a complete recording collection?\n\nAnd there’s plenty of them of course. One of my favorite is in the FZ monstre piece “par excellence”:\n\n∴ – King Kong (You Can’t Do That On Stage Anymore Vol. 3) – ∴\n\nAt 14:34, during the ’82 section, Denny Walley says “oh you want a kinder garden!”. Yes Denny Walley, in 1982! What really happen is that at 11:09 in Don’t Eat the Yellow Snow (YCDTOSA 1) Denny says: “oh you want a kinder garden” and this little fragment was inserted in King Kong (YCDTOSA 3).\n\nOh, talking about yellow snow, is the convenient moment to introduce the dogs topic, and the main carrier is:\n\n∴ – Stink Foot (Apostrophe (‘)) – ∴\n\nWhere:\n\nTHE POODLE BY-EE-ITES\n\nTHE POODLE CHEWS IT\n\nBut he (the Poodle!) also asks:\n\nWhat is your Conceptual Continuity?\n\nFor more on the “Canine Continuity” subject I would suggest “The Secret Meaning of ‘Arf’: Canine Continuity in the Output Macrostructure” by Dominique Jeunot. A paper addressed to ICE-Z (International Conference of Esemplastic Zappology) on January 16, 2004. A reading which may also be considered an homage to Dominique, who abruptly left the building on December 2004. He was the President of France’s surrealistic Zappa fan club Les Fils de l’Invention.\n\nDogs of Zappaland unite, for the arf salute!\n\n∴ – Evelyn, a Modified Dog (One Size Fits all) – ∴\n\nArf, she said\n\nAs Patricia would too. Patricia is a dog painted by Donald Roller Wilson that embellishes the Boulez conducts Zappa album cover.\n\n∴ – Naval Aviation in Art? (The Perfect Stranger) – ∴\n\nThis short but dramatic piece would have been part of Läther, an album that could not happen in 1977 when it was conceived. Here is a 1977-1978 concert season press information:\n\nFRANK ZAPPA HAS THE UNMEDICATED AUDIODACITY TO RELEASE RUDE, RHYTHMICALLY PULSATING ROCK LP ENTITLED “LÄTHER” (pronounced “Leather”), SIMULTANEOUSLY RELEASING MONUMENTAL 4 DISC BOX ENTITLED (this may corne as a shock . . .) “LATHER”, WHICH IS NOT ONLY RUDE & RHYTHMICALLY PULSATING, BUT CONTAINS MORE INCREDIBLE MUSIC AND PERFORMANCES THAN ANYONE (including yourself) HAS EVER IMAGINED POSSIBLE WITHIN THE REALMS OF JAZZ, ROCK, CLASSICAL, ELECTRONIC, AND/OR ANY OTHER COMBINATION OF THE PREVIOUSLY LISTED MUSICAL DISCIPLINES . . .

It was established by an amazing gentleman named Paul Buff.\n\nCucamonga was a blotch on a map, represented by the intersection of Route 66 and Archibald Avenue. On those four corners we had an Italian restaurant, an Irish pub, a malt shop and a gas station.\n\nFZ purchased the studio from Buff in 1964 and renamed as Studio Z, it was the place where he started recording, editing and also over-dubbing!\n\n∴ – Metal Man Has Won His Wings (Mystery Disc) – ∴\n\nwas recorded at Studio Z and features Don Van Vliet, later to be known as Captain Beefheart, lead vocalist for:\n\n∴ – Willie the Pimp (Hot Rats) – ∴\n\nHot Rats is duly considered one of the most important FZ album and we are lucky enough to have access to two significantly different version of it, the first one released on cd in 2012 (the vinyl mix), while the second have been heavily remixed, edited and issued by Zappa in 1987. It also includes a revised version of an Uncle Meat piece, here in its 1988 rendition:\n\n∴ – Mr. Green Genes (The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life) – ∴\n\nEat your greens\n\nDon’t forget your beans & celery\n\nDon’t forget to bring\n\nYour fake I.D.\n\nAnd talking about Uncle Meat, fake I.D.s and the Best Band:\n\n∴ – Cruisin’ For Burgers (Make a Jazz Noise Here) – ∴\n\nI must be free\n\nMy fake I.D.\n\nFreeeeeees me\n\nYou can make such kind of noise, but consider its devilish side!\n\n∴ – While You Were Art II (Jazz from Hell) – ∴\n\nThe synclavier orchestration for While You Were Out from an album that I believe includes a lot of jazz from hell, such as:\n\n∴ – Canard du Jour (Shut up ‘n Play Yer Guitar) – ∴\n\nthat have been also another title for:\n\n∴ – Let’s Move to Cleveland (Does Humor Belong In Music?) – ∴\n\nYet another monstre dated 1976 (as Canard), performed in 1982 (sometimes as Young & Monde) and later in 1984 and 1988 as Cleveland.

Askin in the album liner notes recalls:\n\nOn the night before the first day of rehearsals, he asked me to reorchestrate his Synclavier composition entitled Igor and arrange it for the Ensemble Modern.\n\nAlso, Christopher Ekman (via alt.fan.frank-zappa) pointed out:\n\nThis is a theme from L’Histoire du Soldat which Zappa repeats, overlaps, transposes, twists, changes the backing for, and generally fiddles with any way he can think of. It’s nice and jaunty, and at a minute and a half, it can’t wear out its welcome.\n\nEIHN is a hell of an album, full of less known gems, Román García Albertos has a very useful page to go deep into it (includes the original liner notes and the in-depth post by Christopher Ekman).\n\nBack to the cruise, to complete the circle I still need to pass through The Man from Utopia and Francesco Zappa.\n\nAs far as the first one I would pick:\n\n∴ – The Radio is Broken (The Man from Utopia) – ∴\n\nI will not hook it to the previous EIHN piece, the criterion now is FNRAA, that is a free turn in drawing the Conceptual Continuity circle, to approach a bogus finale. The references to science fiction b-movies and his working title (Willing Suspension of Disbelief) have to be briefly mentioned. The first one as a typical recurring theme (like poodles or religion) that helps to keep the “output macrostructure” logically connected. The second as the classic state of mind necessary to enjoy fictitious stories or (in a broader sense) essential not to notice most of the disturbing effects of western society. If you understand such a mechanism you will have more chances to reach the truth that, as we already know, is not beauty! In dealing with the real world Zappa always want to SHOW us – the audience – what we have in front of our eyes but sometime have difficulties to recognize.\n\nClosing titles with:\n\n∴ – OPUS I, No. 1 1st Movement ANDANTE (Francesco Zappa) – ∴\n\nThis Circular Motion Cruise involves all Zappa albums, from Freak Out! to Everything Is Healing Nicely, and excludes most compilations, namely Mothermania and the three Old Masters Boxes, because they do not include significant unique material (the two Old Masters Mystery Discs have been later issued as a single cd). With the exception of Frank Zappa Plays The Music Of Frank Zappa, a memorial tribute (also excluded), all these albums (those issued between 1966 and 1999) have been edited, sequenced and produced by FZ. Finally there is one more inclusion: Trance-Fusion, a guitar album issued in 2006, but still a full Zappa album to me. Almost full actually, being liner notes and cover out of his direct control (likewise some other late releases herein considered).\n\nFor every single album, I have chosen one song or composition, or “phonogram” (maybe better), using a (sometime straight, sometime loose) conceptual continuity criterion: the next song is always connected with the preceding for a musical theme, a topic or a tiny detail in the title or in the lyrics. Every album is represented by one single “phonogram” (with one exception), even if is a double or multiple disc set.\n\nOf course lot more cruises such as this are to be conceived, try yours!\n\nFNRAA: For No Reason At All\n\nThe first choice for a Conceptual Continuity reading:\n\nHey Hey Hey, Mister Snazzy Exec!\n\nBy Frank Zappa\n\nCircular, September 20, 1971\n\n."
