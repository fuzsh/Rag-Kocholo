        "text": "No area of banking is changing more dramatically than payments. As banks in developed countries which rely on legacy batch systems move toward real-time, they may require significant technology investments. Real-time will create some new business cases, but few can predict what they will be and how, or if, banks can charge for them.\n\n“Banks, today, are juggling with multiple challenges ranging from the end of the batch processing paradigm and the need to provide secure and frictionless customer journeys to retaining customers who now have an ever-expanding choice of innovative solutions from fintechs, big techs, and even telcos,” wrote Darryl Proctor and Shrey Rastogi, payment specialists at Temenos, the Geneva-based banking technology company in their foreward to a report by Ovum.\n\nThe future of payments will continue to evolve, making it a challenge to create a business case that is plausible and useful. Ovum’s advice: “Banks must build holistic, flexible investment cases that address a range of business priorities” and “banks must build their investment plans to take into account the impact on all affected products and services.” It also urges flexible designs that can accommodate future changes.\n\n“New architectures need to leverage APIs and microservices to deliver a foundation for future product and service innovation,” the report says.\n\n\" Delivering payments capability as a series of services will provide new channel opportunities and help power Open Banking and wholesale initiatives,” said Leigh Mahoney, head of wholesale digital, ANZ, pointing out the difficulty of applying ROI to the unknown.\n\n“Microservices will allow the creation of new ‘curated' services and have the potential to create new products currently not in existence.\"\n\nThe report suggests that change in payment systems will be stronger in Asia than other regions of the world. Hong Kong’s Faster Payments System was built by Vocalink, which developed Faster Payments in the UK 10 years ago and whose technology is the foundation of the real-time payments program coming online in the U.S., starting this year.\n\nThe report notes that payment are often a part of a bank’s drive toward end-to-end digitalization, but doesn’t clarify whether that is always a good thing. Chris Skinner, the well-known banking tech writer, often complains that most bankers don’t understand really digital banking.\n\n“If Digital is a project or number of projects which are being led by Chief Digital Officers, then the bank is not going through a transformation. It is just cost cutting services and getting customers to self-serve more, he wrote on one of several recent posts on the topic.” Just Google The Finanser for a broader selection of articles on the topic.\n\nDavid Watson, global head of digital cash products and America’s head of cash management at Deutsche Bank, said costs are only part of the story.\n\n\"The rate of change in the payments world is greater than at any time in the past few decades – we are in the middle of a collision between two worlds where the old batch processes are being replaced by real-time systems.”\n\nIT change in a major bank is complicated. “ Fail fast and break things” might be a fine motto for Facebook, but it is unlikely to attract a lot of followers in banking, especially when it comes to payments.\n\nBanks face what former secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously called the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns.\n\nAlan Lin, global head of cash, transaction banking, at Standard Chartered Bank, explained in banker terminology: \"With our digitalization strategy, we are seeing more and more opportunities open up, none of which would have been part of a business case for making the platform investment, but if we hadn't made that investment we would certainly be missing out.”\n\nBankers interviewed for the study said that where payments had often been seen as a back-office function, forward-looking banks now recognize it as a central enabler of their digital strategy. But as Ovum noted, while that often elevated it to strategic status, it also links payments to other initiatives such as pricing, risk, and relationship management — increasing the number of stakeholder involved and probably the internal friction.\n\nThe report concludes with a one-page overview of the Temenos ROI model for payment transformation which includes ways to develop calculations across three mutually exclusive benefits: Payment system modernization, operating model benefits & revenue\n\nuplifts and customer experience & service improvements."
