As such, an integral component of our job includes building a satisfying working relationship with you. We regard our clients as partners rather than customers – and as partners, we work hard to become your trusted advisor.\n\nAt Access Softek, every project has an appointed Client Lead – this is your day-to-day contact. Your Client Lead oversees the complete development process - including specifications, test suites, de-bugging, and milestones. Your Access Softek Client Lead works with you to ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget.\n\nFor the last 28 years, we have partnered with Fortune 500 companies Microsoft, Apple, Motorola, NEC, HP, and SONY – in addition to Intuit, H&R Block, Fiserv, and Online Resources.\n\nDuring that time we have developed some very innovative financial services products that offer top-of-the-line security and cutting-edge functionality.
