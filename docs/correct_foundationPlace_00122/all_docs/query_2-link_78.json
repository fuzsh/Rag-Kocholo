        "text": "Temenos, a Geneva-based vendor of core banking systems, has acquired Akcelerant, a leading US-based financial software provider. It is the company’s second acquisition of a US banking software company, following its 2013 purchase of Trinovus which provides compliance through a Software as a Service (SaaS) model.\n\nThe two acquisitions position it for expansion into the American market.\n\nAmerican banking is full of core banking platforms that are aging anything but gracefully. They mostly run on mainframes, are often approaching 40 years in age, operate in overnight batch processing cycles, and were often developed by product lines — mortgages, checking, savings, CDs, lending, credit cards, etc. — which makes it very difficult to develop a comprehensive (aka 360-degree) view of customers, much less keep up with the real-time account updating that mobile users expect.\n\nBBVA Compass, the U.S. arm of the international, and technologically ambitious, Spanish bank has replaced its old core with Accenture’s Alnoa and Discover Financial has moved from Fiserv to the Infosys Finacle systems. Zions Bank is working with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) an Indian firm, on a new system. Financial technology advisory firms say they are seeing several banks looking for new systems, but few sales announcements have appeared.\n\nMost of the new core systems are from firms located outside the U.S. — such as Temenos, SAP in Germany, TCS and Infosys’s Finacle in India, Oracle is building a new core based on Flexcube, an Indian firm, as is Polaris. They are gunning for the service bureaus which have provided banking services for years — FIS, Fiserv and Jack Henry. Analysts say those companies, which were built up through acquisitions, will be rationalizing their offerings, ending some older systems and migrating customers to more modern platforms.\n\nBut if a bank has to move from one Fiserv or FIS system to another, that opens the way to consider moving to something entirely new, a move which may be easier now than even three years ago because vendors are often offering new core systems in the cloud, and building their components to the BIAN international banking standard. BIAN, at least theoretically, offers the potential to plug and play banking system modules and Temenos has seen BIAN in many of the RFPs it has received from banks.\n\nTemenos has one banking client in the U.S. now — Independence Bancshares, whose CEO Gordon Baird wants to use the banking license to provide banking services to wireless carriers and retailers, among others. He is using Temenos as a cloud service, as is the UK’s Metro Bank, founded by Vernon Hill, who started the enormously successful Commerce Bank in New Jersey and expanded it up and down the East Coast. Temenos uses Microsoft’s Azure cloud service as a preferred provider but also runs on Amazon Web Services and has done a proof of concept with IBM.\n\nCracking the American market for a European or India software company is a challenge because of banking traditions, regulations, state and federal overlap of rules and the evolving challenges of mobile banking. Temenos uses a country wrapper around its T24 core system to provide the languages and reporting required in each country where it sells.\n\nAmerican acquisitions\n\nAkcelerant, founded in 2000 and based in Philadelphia, provides lending and collection software mostly to credit unions and to some banks including origination, account servicing, risk management and collections, where it is the market leader for US credit unions. The company has 130 employees in Malvern, PA.\n\n“The acquisition [Akcelerant] is is key to Temenos’ North America growth strategy, especially within the US.,” the company said. “It follows the 2013 acquisition of Trinovus, [focused on community banking] a software-as-a-service technology provider, and creation of the Temenos USA division. The purchase of Akcelerant will also give Temenos additional scale and presence in the region and enable it to offer a broader portfolio of products to new and existing customers.”\n\nTemenos is using these two U.S. acquisitions to open its way into the U.S. market.\n\nDavid Arnott, the CEO of Temenos, thinks the company has the potential to disrupt the U.S. market.\n\n“FIS, Jack Henry and Fiserv have their own cores,” he said. “These guys are kind of getting squeezed out. We wanted to come into the U.S. market with our real-time, modern rich channel solutions with embedded analytics and modular architecture, but if you go up against those incumbents with just a core, you face difficulties. The opportunity here is to use the customers of Trinovus and Akcelerant to sell our core.”\n\nTemenos offers both on-premise and SaaS, he added. Last year it beat 25 other banking software vendors to win two Latin American deals, one in Venezuela and one in a country that can’t be named, he added.\n\nBank analysts have been predicting that this will be the year of widespread core replacements in North America for 10 or 11 years now, but this year they are serious, again.\n\nArnott is similarly optimistic. The costs that banks are facing with their own systems has been too high for several years at least, but that hasn’t been enough to make core replacement a strategic priority because banks have had to deal with the fallout from the financial crisis, which is finally easing.\n\n“Banks have the visibility now to make four- to five-year decisions which they haven’t had in a long time,” he explained. “They were in survival mode.”\n\nNow banks can plan a little further out, and when they do they can’t miss the threats of players like Google coming into their business. Faced with low assets under management and low interest rates, the only way they have to drive savings is through core replacement, he added.\n\nAn even bigger issue is digitalization, Arnott said.\n\n“Banks realize unless they digitalize quickly and develop analytics like retailers have, they are dead.”"
