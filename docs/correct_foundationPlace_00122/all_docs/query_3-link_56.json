        "text": "Temenos Group (SIX: TEMN), the software specialist for banking and finance, has become the latest Leadership Circle Partner of the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology Foundation (The LHoFT). Temenos and the LHoFT will work together to deliver two exciting events in the coming weeks as part of their longer-term collaboration.\n\nThe first event is the LTS Fintech Hackathon in Luxembourg. Over the course of the last weekend of June, 30 teenage students from the Luxembourg Tech School (LTS) will develop and present their answers to the question: ‘What does the bank of the future look like?’ The students will be guided by various senior technology and business mentors from the local financial services industry, all of whom are eager to engage with the students and to receive insight into the way this generation’s expectations of financial services are shaped by their tech orientated social environment and lifestyles. The event will also be supported by Luxembourg’s Ministry of State and Digital Lëtzebuerg initiative.\n\nOn the 5th of July, Temenos Group and the LHoFT will address a burning issue with a focused conference: how to master banking transformation - moving from the traditional banking to open-banking with the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2). Keynote speakers include the Luxembourg regulator (CSSF), the Banker’s Association (ABBL), Temenos Marketplace providers Apigee and Blue Code, runner-up at Temenos annual Innovation Jam competition, as well as many others. The speakers will discuss the challenges facing the banking industry related to transformation and practical strategies, with case studies, on how to ensure continued future competitiveness.\n\nTemenos Group joins the eleven other distinguished members of the LHoFT’s Leadership Circle: BCEE, BGL BNP Paribas, Clearstream (Deutsche Börse Group), Deloitte Digital, Foyer Group, KPMG, POST, PwC, Six Payment Services, Société Générale and Telindus (Proximus Group).\n\nNasir Zubairi, CEOoftheLHoFT comments: ‘We are incredibly excited to have Temenos join our Leadership Circle. Temenos have been at the forefront of innovation for a long time and their experience, in collaboration with the LHoFT, can really help drive Fintech forward. I am very excited about the two forthcoming events and the positive impact they will have on industry. I look forward to future collaboration with Temenos on a variety of projects.’\n\nBen Robinson, Chief Strategy Officer at Temenos and Head of Community for the Temenos MarketPlace adds: ‘Temenos is committed to offering its customers the highest levels of innovation. Increasingly, we do this through the Temenos MarketPlace, our open banking platform that brings together banks and Fintech companies. This partnership with the LHoFT will help us to grow the community around MarketPlace and to uncover the most exciting Fintech companies.’"
