The new open digital banking platform will enable us to gain a deeper understanding of our customers’ needs and allow us to provide the best-in-class customer experience.”\n\nJean-Paul Mergeai, Temenos’ Managing Director for Middle East and Africa said, “As the bank’s technology partner during this exciting time of digital transformation, we look forward to working hand in hand with Bank of Kigali Plc as they strive to provide the most innovative financial solutions in the region. We believe that financial institutions can only become truly digital when they transform their end-to-end operations and we are the best provider to help them realize their digital vision.\n\nThe Bank has a distribution network comprising of 68 branches, 13 outlets, 9 mobivans, 1,477 agents and serves over 290,000 individuals and over 24,000 business entities.\n\nThe Bank has a wide distribution network that includes self-service channels such as deposit taking ATMs and Point of Sale terminals as well as channels that are geared towards promoting financial inclusion such as mobile vans."
