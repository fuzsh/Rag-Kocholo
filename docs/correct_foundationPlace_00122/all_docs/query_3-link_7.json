        "text": "Individual Therapy\n\nA crisis in one’s life can be an opportunity for change and growth. When life challenges present themselves, it’s natural to desire an objective person to confide in and sort things out. A trusting one-on-one relationship with a therapist can be a comfortable place to explore uncomfortable issues. Within the context of individual therapy, clients explore their thoughts and feelings, and they begin to discover how their past informs their day-to-day life. With a combination of empathy, support, education and challenge, the therapist provides the client with the means to create desired change as well as a more meaningful and balanced life.\n\nCouples Therapy\n\nA relationship with a committed partner is among the most important of our lives. It can be a source of great joy and intimacy, and sometimes a source of pain and disconnection. An affair, parenting conflicts, substance abuse, a partner’s history of trauma or abuse, or the life transition of a child going to college are among the many issues that can contribute to difficulties between partners.\n\nCouples can greatly benefit from the opportunity to sit together with a professional to help manage problems and improve communication. Learning new skills to understand one’s partner and oneself can breathe fresh air into a relationship and create more compassion and optimism. Many partners engage in couple’s therapy as a way to revitalize and enhance an already solid connection.\n\nAt TEMENOS, we welcome heterosexual and same sex couples.\n\nFamily Therapy\n\nSome family therapists have likened a family to a mobile. When one part of the mobile moves, the other parts move in response. Similarly, when one member of a family changes, other family members change in response. The goal of family therapy is to improve the balance and stability of the family system, while the role of the therapist is to attend to each part of the structure. A family’s resilience and support has a powerful ability to heal each member from pain and adversity.\n\nWhen a family member, especially a child or adolescent, is symptomatic in some way, such as struggling with an eating disorder, substance abuse, school or behavioral problems, the child is often expressing through destructive actions something he or she cannot put into words. The family therapist will help the family “de-code” the message and find a way to use this information for the growth and development of the whole family.\n\nChild and Adolescent Services\n\nYoung people today often struggle with a variety of worries and concerns, and yet can sometimes present these struggles in ways that are quite different from adults. Some youngsters may verbalize these stresses and their effects as clear complaints, and may be able to talk about these issues directly in therapy. For others, however, struggles related to school adjustment, social adjustment, or family stresses may present as “behavior problems.” Very often such behaviors are an indication of underlying anxiety or depression. Typical problems that may emerge include school/academic performance concerns, social worries, substance experimentation, or family tension and communication problems.\n\nAt TEMENOS, we can provide the resources necessary to help your family cope with concerns such as these. We have the specialized training and experience in child and adolescent evaluation and psychotherapy required to understand the many pressures young people face. Our goal is to work with youngsters within a supportive relationship that fosters open and honest communication. This relationship is the foundation of “mutual understanding” and, ultimately, problem solving.\n\nPsychotherapy Groups and Support Groups\n\nPsychotherapy groups and/or support groups offer a unique opportunity for participants to come together and share their challenges as well as their growth. Through community, group members can often recognize the struggles of others and gain insight into themselves. By sharing stories and hearing those of others, group members can recognize new opportunities for growth and recovery and decrease feelings of isolation and shame.\n\nAt TEMENOS, we offer a number of groups, including Body Image, Mindfulness and Stress Reduction, Yoga Techniques for Managing Anxiety and Depression, and DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy). See Upcoming Events or contact us at (856) 722-9043, ex. 9 for more information about current groups.\n\nProfessional training, consultation, & supervision for mental health professionals\n\nThe TEMENOS Center offers clinical training, consultation, and supervision to mental health professionals. We offer workshops and seminars on the treatment of addictions and eating disorders, psychodynamic psychotherapy, treating trauma and dual disorders, yoga and yoga therapy, mindfulness meditation, and other topics. Individual supervision to meet professional licensure requirements is also available.\n\nSee Upcoming Events or contact us at (856) 722-9043, ex. 9 for more information about upcoming workshops or trainings. We are happy to discuss offering trainings on a variety of topics to your agency or organization.\n\nPsychological testing and evaluation\n\nForensic psychological evaluation\n\nChild custody evaluation\n\nOur psychologists provide psychological evaluations and testing for a variety of purposes including clinical consultations, disability evaluations, and forensic psychological evaluations and expert testimony for child custody and parental rights cases. Please contact Dr. Frank Schwoeri at (856) 722-9352 for further information.\n\nNutrition Therapy\n\nAt the TEMENOS Center, we invite our eating disordered clients to think of recovery as a two-pronged approach. Working with a therapist to understand the emotional underpinnings of an eating issue is critical to finding new ways of coping with the challenges of living a full and mindful life. Nutrition therapy offers an action piece of recovery by supporting clients in facing their fears of incorporating varied and sustaining nourishment. Our on-staff nutritionist, Flavia Herzog Liebel, MA, RD,LPN, specializes in eating disorder and sports nutrition, and brings a nuanced understanding of the emotional issues that drive disordered eating. She works closely with the therapist to coordinate treatment, and she has a way of making a potentially difficult and even frightening topic very accessible.\n\nYoga Therapy\n\nThe Temenos center offers individual yoga therapy in person and online.\n\nYoga Therapy is a unique application of yoga in which the student/patient, working individually with the therapist, is given a custom-designed practice to address their particular needs. It is a complementary and alternative approach, working with other healing methods including traditional psychotherapy and/or medical treatments. Yoga therapy can help you:\n\nImprove mental, physical, and emotional well-being.\n\nManage, reduce, or eliminate symptoms that cause suffering.\n\nChange your relationship to your condition, disorder, or illness.\n\nDifferences between yoga therapy and a regular yoga class:\n\nYoga therapy offers you a personalized daily yoga practice to do at home.\n\nYoga therapy is all about you and your personal needs.\n\nThe relationship with your yoga therapist is confidential.\n\nA yoga therapist has specialized training, well beyond the basic yoga teacher credential.\n\nYoga therapy offers the full range of yoga practices, which may include postures and movement, but also may include sound, breath practice, visualization, and meditation.\n\nFor more information please contact Linda Cope at 856-722-9043 ext. 703 or lindacope@temenoscenter.com.\n\nSmall-Group Therapeutic Yoga Services We also offer other programs and services incorporating yoga methods to enhance your life and promote well-being:\n\nMeditation classes\n\nYoga for Addictions Recovery\n\nVedic chanting and self-care online groups\n\nSelf-Care for Healthcare Professionals\n\nYoga Nidra for stress reduction, anxiety, and PTSD.
