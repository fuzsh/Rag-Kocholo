        "text": "NEWSLETTER\n\nOCTOBER 2023\n\nLECTURES\n\n'Everything That Lives is Holy': William Blake, Imagination and the Love of the World\n\nDR VALENTIN GERLIER\n\nMonday 2 October\n\nIn the Chair Kamil Sawicki\n\nThe current ecological crisis has brought new urgency in our trying to understand the world as woven together, deeply interconnected or 'entangled'. Thinking with William Blake, this lecture will argue that the nature of such connections is brought to light not by abstract conceptions of systematic thinking, but by the ongoing work of the creative imagination.\n\nImagination is often conceived as a mode of vision, intuition or even revelatory understanding. Yet the ground of the imagination for William Blake, is Divine love, a love which longs to infuse and unite the created order rather than abstract away from it. As Blake puts it, 'Eternity is in love with the productions of time'. Thus while imagination may guide to a creative union with the divine, the divine also paradoxically leads away from itself and into the created order, 'so that God may be all in all'. Moved by this love, the imagination speaks the world into existence and creatively articulates intricate relationships between human and more-than-human worlds. It is thus through the imagination that divine love courses through the world and knits the various realms of being together, exulting in the enduring truth that 'everything that lives is holy'.\n\nVALENTIN GERLIER is Senior Lecturer in Poetics of Imagination at Dartington Arts School. He is the author of Shakespeare and the Grace of Words (Routledge, 2022) and regularly teaches and lectures at the Temenos Academy.\n\nVenue and Timing\n\nBrunswick Group LLP,\n\n18 Lincoln Inn's Fields,\n\nLondon, WC2A 3ED\n\nNearest Underground - Holborn\n\nDoor Open 6.10pm\n\nLecture begins 6.30pm\n\nAdmission\n\n£8 or £5 Members of the Temenos Academy/Concessions\n\nFREE for full-time students with ID card\n\nE temenos...@myfastmail.com T 07513 883 335\n\nThe Journey After Death\n\nSANDRA HILL\n\nMonday 16 October\n\nIn the Chair Hilary Davies\n\nUsing the Han Dynasty Mawangdui Funeral Banner as a guide, this lecture will explore the mythologies and cosmologies of 2nd century BCE China, tracing the journey of the soul after death through both the watery underworlds and the paradise of the immortals.\n\nThe Mawangdui funeral banner is the earliest known example of Chinese painting on silk, and was discovered, remarkably intact, in the tomb of a female aristocrat, Xin Zhui, the countess of Dai. The tomb, excavated for the first time in 1972, was found to include over 1000 artefacts, and included texts of the Laozi (Daode Jing) and early medical treatises. The nature of several artefacts found in the tomb suggest that the woman was a Daoist adept. The preservation of her body was of great interest at the time of its discovery.\n\nOur exploration through the imagery of the banner will be enhanced through references to textual sources, including the Daode Jing (The Way and its Virtue) , the Huainanzi, and the Songs of Chu.\n\nSANDRA HILL holds an MA in Fine Art and is currently engaged in doctoral research at the Prince's Foundation School of Traditional Arts. She has studied classical Chinese with French sinologists Claude Larre s.j. and Elisabeth Rochat de la Vallée, and co-founded Monkey Press to publish their work in English.
