Lessons from Temenos Global from Day 1\n\n12. Lessons from Temenos It is not possible to run a successful software business within a services company unless that company can decouple services from product sales. Michael Cusumano - MIT Sloan School of Management, author of “The Business of Software”\n\n13. Lessons from Temenos EV/Sales 14.9x 1.6x Source: Analyst estimates at Oct 2018\n\n14. Lessons from Temenos Culture & purpose\n\n15. Strategic planning\n\n16. Strategy We like to think of strategy as formulated deliberately at the top to be implemented below. Henry Mintzberg – Business Author and Professor, creator of the “Emergent Strategy” theory I have found that organizations learn their way into interesting strategies through small ventures that arise from the initiatives of all sorts of people.\n\n18. Strategy Why is it that established companies invest aggressively – and successfully – in the technologies necessary to retain their current customers but then fail to make the technological investments that customers of the future will demand? Clayton M. Christensen - Harvard Business School The fundamental reason is that leading companies succumb to one of the most popular, and valuable, management dogmas; they stay close to their customers.\n\n20. Strategy\n\n22. No customer feedback; No solution delivered Strategy Earliest testable Earliest usable Earliest loveable Defects likely to occur Not loveable first time Takes too long to solve problem\n\n23. Strategy Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Andy Grove – former CEO at Intel Corp. Only the paranoid survive.\n\n24. Cultural challenge Peter Drucker Culture eats strategy for breakfast.\n\n25. Strategy Choosing right time horizons Move at speed of market, not customers Incubate disruptive ideas outside of main company Iterative design/build key to fast time to value and low risk to value Cannibalisation is healthy and necessary Devolve decision-making and budgets widely\n\n27.
