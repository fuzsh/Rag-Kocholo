Psychiatrist and author Carl Jung characterized \"Temenos\" as a safe space where mental work can take place. The mission of Temenos Place Apartments mirrors that objective by providing a safe haven where all people are loved and accepted.\n\nWhat Drives Us?\n\nThe Lives That We Change Daily\n\nHome.\n\nTemenos was created to provide affordable permanent supportive housing for those living in critical poverty. We strive to house as many people as possible in order to give them a fighting chance at a decent living environment\n\nHeart.\n\nAt Temenos, we start with love for people first. At any moment, any of us could be impacted by the loss of a job, loss of finances, or experience something traumatic that could change the life that we know forever. By treating people as equals, we set the example for our community of how to end homelessness.\n\nPeople.\n\nThe people in our community are what drives our mission. From our employees to the residents that live at our campuses, Temenos wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for the love of our community and the desire to see change.\n\nOUR MISSION\n\nTemenos Community Development Corporation’s mission is to provide affordable housing opportunities, supportive services, and employment resources to low- to extremely low-income persons on their journey to wholeness.\n\nDEBUNK THE STEREOTYPES\n\nWe’ve all been told that “you should never judge a book by its cover” but for a lot the homeless community in Houston and around the world that type of courtesy isn’t alway shown. There are so many stereotypes that are assumed about this vulnerable community that we want to debunk.\n\nDebunked\n\nDebunk The Stereotypes\n\n50% of Houston’s homelessness is caused by an economic crisis and not substance abuse.\n\nPeople experiencing homelessness are far more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators\n\nA significant portion of people experiencing the crisis of homelessness have jobs but cannot afford to pay rent.\n\nMeet A Few\n\nOf Our Residents\n\nWhose Stories\n\nKeep Us Motivated\n\nTemenos CDC for years has been providing a safe place where residents are accepted no matter their religion, race, sexual orientation, and gender identity/expression. We consider everyone that walks through our doors a part of our growing family and work tirelessly to ensure we provide whatever help is needed to get our residents back on their feet.\n\nTemenos Resident Bio\n\nResident Chico\n\nTemenos CDC Resident, 4 yrs\n\nResident Ms. Clover\n\nTemenos CDC Resident, 7 yrs\n\nResident Thaddeus\n\nTemenos CDC Resident, 2 yrs\n\nResident Alexandria\n\nTemenos CDC Resident, 3 yrs\n\nResident Mr.Strong\n\nTemenos CDC Resident, 7 yrs\n\nResident Derrick (DJ)\n\nTemenos CDC Resident, 4 yrs\n\nResident Prince\n\nTemenos CDC Resident, 3 yrs\n\nSave A Life Today.\n\nThere are countless ways that you can assist in helping us in our mission to combat against homelessness and financial insecurity. We accept funding, donated goods, and volunteers all of which will ensure the success of our community.\n\nOur residents are not only in need of everyday resources but your time as well! Feel free to visit and play a board game with our residents or participate in any resident events that we provide, like yoga or bike riding!\n\nPlease contact housing organizations like SEARCH or Houston Housing Authority.\n\nAbsolutely!
