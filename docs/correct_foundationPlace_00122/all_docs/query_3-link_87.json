One of the unique and very striking features of this approach is the attainment of the rainbow body (Tib. ’ja’ lus), a sign of accomplishment in specific Dzogchen meditative practices, whereby the physical body shrinks and dissolves at the time of death, accompanied by rainbow lights. This lecture will explore the meaning of the rainbow body phenomenon within the context of Dzogchen traditions of contemplative practice and will also look at the phenomenon from the perspective of comparative mysticism.\n\nDYLAN ESLER is a scholar and translator of Tibetan Buddhist texts. He holds a PhD in Languages and Literature from the University of Louvain and an MA in Buddhist Studies from SOAS, London. He currently works at the Center for Religious Studies (CERES) of the Ruhr-University Bochum and is also affiliated with the Oriental Institute of Louvain (CIOL). His research interest focuses on early Nyingma expositions of Dzogchen and Tantra. Articles of his have appeared in the Revue d’Etudes Tibétaines, the Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Temenos Academy Review, the BuddhistRoad Paper series and Sophia: The Journal of Traditional Studies. His annotated translation of Nubchen Sangye Yeshe’s Samten Migdrön, a seminal 10th-century text on Buddhist contemplation, is forthcoming from Oxford University Press.\n\nVenue and timing\n\nThe Royal Asiatic Society\n\n14 Stephenson Way\n\nLondon NW1 2HD\n\nNearest Underground Euston Square\n\nDoors open 6.15pm\n\nLecture begins promptly at 6.45pm\n\nConcludes 8.30pm\n\nAdmission\n\n£8 or £5 Members of the Temenos Academy/Concessions\n\nCASH ONLY on the door\n\nFull-time students with student ID card FREE\n\nT 01233 813663 E temenos...@myfastmail.com\n\nGold in the Crucible: Futuwwa, Dante, and the Alchemy of Soul-Making\n\nDR ALISON M. ROBERTS\n\nMonday 17 October\n\nIn the chair Julia Cleave\n\n‘Learn Futuwwa from your wife’, is the unexpected advice given by Bāyazīd al-Bisṭāmī to Aḥmad ibn Khiḍruya, a respected Futuwwa leader in Balkh in the ninth century, especially considering that this ancient chivalric tradition, which honours the prophet Abraham as founder, is usually associated with male courage and valour. Yet around the same time, Fatima of Nishapur was initiating the Egyptian Sufi, Dhū’l-Nūn al-Misrī, into this spiritual art after they met at Mecca. Less well-known, however, is the fusion of Futuwwa with alchemy’s feminine rebirth mysteries, which this talk will explore, including in Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī’s Mathnawī and Muḥyīddīn Ibn ʿArabī’s encounter with the chivalric Youth (fatā) at the Black Stone of the Kaaba in Mecca. Highlighted, too, will be the parallels with Dante Alighieri’s transformative journey to a ‘noble’ life in the Vita Nova, inspired by his love for Beatrice. The talk will be illustrated with alchemical imagery.\n\nALISON M. ROBERTS studied Ancient Egyptian and Akkadian languages at Oxford University where she received her doctorate in 1984 for her thesis on the goddess Hathor. Since then, she has written and published a quartet of books on the Divine Feminine and the roots of Hermetic alchemy in ancient Egypt (1995–2019).\n\nVenue and timing\n\nBrunswick Ltd.

Close attention will be paid to the great watercolours he made in the 1920s, where imaginative exchanges take place between the subjects he was painting from the motif and the engravings he was making to illustrate poems such as Coleridge’s Rime of the Ancient Mariner. In these watercolours the ‘visionary’ is realised in the vital rhythm and touch of the artist’s hand – Jones’s unique ‘inscape’.\n\nPAUL HILLS, Professor Emeritus of the Courtauld Institute, visited David Jones when an undergraduate and later curated the retrospective exhibitions of Jones at the Tate in 1981 and Pallant House, Chichester, in 2015. His books include Veiled Presence: Body and Drapery from Giotto to Titian (Yale, 2018), and – co-authored with Ariane Bankes – The Art of David Jones: Vision and Memory (Lund Humphries, 2015).\n\nVenue and timing\n\nThe Royal Asiatic Society\n\n14 Stephenson Way\n\nLondon NW1 2HD\n\nNearest Underground Euston Square\n\nDoors open 6.15pm\n\nLecture begins promptly at 6.45pm\n\nConcludes 8.30pm\n\nAdmission\n\n£8 or £5 Members of the Temenos Academy/Concessions\n\nCASH ONLY on the door\n\nFull-time students with student ID card FREE\n\nT 01233 813663 E temenos...@myfastmail.com\n\nREADING ESSENTIAL TEXTS EVENING SEMINARS\n\nPorphyry On the Cave of the Nymphs\n\nPROFESSOR JOHN CAREY\n\nPorphyry’s commentary on the enigmatic description of the ‘Cave of the Nymphs’ in Odyssey Book XIII, written late in the third century AD, has been called ‘the oldest piece of literary criticism in the European tradition to survive essentially intact to our own time’. Characterised by polymathic erudition and by an esoteric spiritual sensibility, this brief treatise is a subtle and complex specimen of Neoplatonic symbolic thinking, which has inspired such figures as Blake, Shelley, Yeats, and Kathleen Raine. We will engage in a close reading of the text, with reference to the web of traditions and teachings on which it draws.\n\nJOHN CAREY is Professor of Early and Medieval Irish at University College Cork. His books include King of Mysteries: Early Irish Religious Writings (1998, 2000), A Single Ray of the Sun: Religious Speculation in Early Ireland (1999, 2011; originally a series of lectures presented to the Temenos Academy), Ireland and the Grail (2007), Ten Basic Principles that Inspire the Work of Temenos (2015), The Ever-New Tongue: The Text in the Book of Lismore (2018), and The Mythological Cycle of Medieval Irish Literature (2018). He is a Fellow of the Temenos Academy, on whose Council and Academic Board he serves, and the general editor of Temenos Academy Review.\n\n31 October – 28 November Mondays, 5 weekly meetings\n\n6.30pm for 6.45 – 8.15pm\n\nVenue private home in north London, full address on booking.
