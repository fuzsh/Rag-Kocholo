        "text": "The Foundation Certificate in Reflective Practice Group Facilitation Skills is a three-day training module designed to introduce participants to the role of Practitioner-facilitators. These individuals serve as reflective practice support for their peers, empowering them to be proactive in their own support and self-care.\n\nRecognising that not every frontline practitioner comes equipped with the skills to facilitate reflective support groups, this module aims to tap into their transferable skills. It offers a structured pathway to develop and refine these skills, drawing inspiration from established models such as the critical apprenticeship/learning-by-doing approach (Collins et.al., 1991; Kolb, 1984; Vygotsky,1978) and concepts like “knowing-in-action” (Schön, 1983).\n\nOver the course of three days, participants will:\n\nParticipate in a Reflective Practice Group.\n\nDelve into the competencies and skills essential for facilitating Reflective Practice Groups.\n\nPractise peer support.\n\nPractise the art of facilitating a Reflective Practice Group.\n\nKey competencies and skills that will be honed include:\n\nCrafting a psychologically safe space for participants.\n\nEncouraging ethical discussions and finding solutions.\n\nContaining participants’ anxieties and fears related to mistakes and judgement.\n\nEffective communication and appropriate intervention.\n\nEngaging, modelling and encouraging intelligent empathy.\n\nNavigating the “support – challenge” continuum adeptly.\n\nFacilitating conversations about difficult issues.\n\nProviding and receiving feedback in a constructive manner.\n\nPre-empting, identifying and managing possible triggers for participants.\n\nFacilitating the cycle of experiencing/learning/applying.\n\nThe reflective/supervision approach is based on a 3R’s model of facilitation of reflective support groups (Costa, 2020), which aim to be:\n\nReparative – providing support and fostering connections.\n\nReflective - facilitating learning from challenges.\n\nResponsive – applying insights from the reflective practice support group to individual practice and systemic development.\n\nAfter the foundational training in Module 1, Module 2 emphasises the hands-on application of the skills learned. Participants are tasked with independently organising and leading a series of 4 practice groups as trainee facilitators, without the presence of the trainer. This setup is intentional, allowing participants to immerse themselves fully in the facilitation role and navigate the dynamics of group facilitation on their own.\n\nTo ensure continuous growth and address any challenges encountered during these sessions, each practice group will be followed by a 1.5-hour group supervision session. These sessions, led by the trainer, aim to provide constructive feedback, answer any queries, and reinforce the principles of effective group facilitation, ensuring participants are well-equipped to handle future facilitation scenarios.\n\nCancellation Policy:\n\nWe get it, life happens and plans can change. Here's what you need to know about our cancellation policy for the Foundation Certificate in Reflective Practice Group Facilitation Skills course:\n\nRefund and Rescheduling:\n\nShould you wish to withdraw within 30 days of making the full payment or the first instalment, and there's still over a month before the course commences, we'll provide a full refund.\n\nIf you've been enrolled for more than a month, but there's still over 60 days until the course begins, you're eligible for a 50% refund.\n\nFor those who decide to cancel with 30-60 days remaining before the course starts, we can offer a 25% refund.\n\nRegrettably, if there are fewer than 30 days left before the course starts, we cannot offer a refund.\n\nIf you're on a payment plan, refunds will be calculated based on the amount you've already paid. Please note, any outstanding amounts are still payable to Temenos Education Ltd.\n\nIf circumstances change, you have the option to reschedule and join a future training programme within the year, subject to availability.\n\nSubstitution:\n\nUnable to attend the course? Not to worry. You can nominate a suitable replacement to attend in your stead at no additional cost. They will need to meet all the course prerequisites.\n\nWe aim to be as accommodating as possible. Should you have any queries or require assistance with the cancellation or rescheduling process, our team is here to assist.\n\nWe all aspire to experience groups as safe, enriching, and with just the right amount of challenge to help us grow. If the thought of facilitating such an experience feels overwhelming, or if you've faced challenges in past facilitation roles this course will offer the support you need to build your confidence.\n\nI believe that comprehensive training in group facilitation is essential for the success of the group and the well-being of the facilitator. The strain of navigating these challenges without the right preparation can lead to personal burnout and missed growth opportunities for your participants. The need for skilled facilitation in both educational and professional settings, with the goal of enhancing participant development and overall well-being, has never been more pronounced. By starting your training journey as a group facilitator, you have the opportunity to profoundly improve the outcomes and well-being of each participant.\n\nI look forward to working with you.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBeverley Costa\n\nAfter qualifying as a psychotherapist, Beverley Costa established Mothertongue multi-ethnic counselling service, which served multilingual clients from 2000 to 2018. In 2009, she created a mental health interpreter service. A year later, in 2010, she initiated the National Bilingual Therapist and Mental Health Interpreter Forum. In 2017, she founded The Pásalo Project [www.pasaloproject.org] to disseminate the learnings from Mothertongue.\n\nSince 2013, Beverley has trained over 5,000 therapists for NHS services and NGOs, focusing on therapeutic work across languages and with interpreters. She holds the title of Senior Practitioner Fellow at Birkbeck, University of London. In 2023, she was granted the title of Senior Visiting Research Fellow in the School of Arts and Communication Design at the University of Reading.\n\nBeverley has facilitated Reflective Practice Support groups for a diverse range of professionals, including interpreters, psychological therapists, counsellors, nurses, teachers, lawyers, academic researchers and psychosocial workers. She has crafted an introductory course in facilitator skills for running Reflective Practice Groups, which has been delivered online to organisations across England, Scotland, and Wales.\n\nBeverley is also the author of *Other Tongues - Psychological Therapies in a Multilingual World*. The book can be found here: [https://tinyurl.com/Other-Tongues].\n\n\"The session was deeply insightful and uplifting. It showcased the potential depth and fulfillment in this role, offering a beacon of support during challenging moments.\"\n\n\"Throughout, I felt genuinely acknowledged, advocated for, and bolstered.\"\n\n\"The guidance during the session was akin to receiving invaluable expert advice!\"\n\n\"Being a part of these support groups has been a pivotal enhancement to my research journey. I'm passionate about encouraging more researchers to experience this.\"\n\n\"As highlighted during the introduction, the group offers a unique blend that's neither strictly therapeutic nor entirely devoid of it. It's been a space for me to navigate and articulate certain feelings. This experience has had a profound influence on a segment of my research methodology.\"\n\nThis course is a collaboration between The Pásalo Project and Temenos Education.\n\nThe Pásalo Project is a UK based organisation, drawing in talented professionals as required to create project-specific responses and solutions for psychological health and social care issues across languages.\n\nProjects have resulted in e-learning resources, training and supervision films, models for counselling and psychotherapy across languages, a performance group of interpreters and more – delivered in the UK, across Europe and globally.\n\nAll the project’s work is focused on applied linguistics, psychological therapy and social care, developed and delivered with the core member of the Pásalo Project Dr Beverley Costa DPSych, Senior Practitioner Fellow, Birkbeck, University of London and Senior Visiting Research Fellow, University of Reading.\n\nYou can visit The Pásalo Project by clicking here."
