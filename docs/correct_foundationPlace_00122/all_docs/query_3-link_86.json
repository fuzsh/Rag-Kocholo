Until the end of 2008 the database was based on the corporate filings published by the companies in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce (SOGC) since 1 January 1998 and subsequently entered into the database by the Disclosure Office.\n\nSince the implementation of the electronic publication platform of the Disclosure Office the data is entered directly by the issuer within two trading days of receipt of the filing. Publication on the SIX Swiss Exchange website takes place before 7.30 a.m. on the next day."
