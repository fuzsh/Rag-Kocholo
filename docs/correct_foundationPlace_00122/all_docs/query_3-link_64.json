        "text": "Download logo\n\nTemenos (SIX: TEMN) (www.Temenos.com), the banking software company, today announced the launch of Temenos Learning Community (TLC) Engine, the latest addition to the TLC training suite. TLC Engine helps banks to reduce operational risk and costs, monitor their regulatory compliance better, and increase staff engagement; it can be deployed on the cloud or on premise and integrates seamlessly with Temenos banking software products. It can also be integrated to third party systems, which a bank may be using.\n\nTLC Engine is specifically designed for banks, to serve as a foundation for change management and training activities. With TLC Engine, financial institutions can record, update and cascade their unique business processes, using the Temenos Standard Operating Procedures (TSOP) as a basis. TLC Engine can then utilize these processes to support the ongoing training of staff across all of a bank’s organization. TLC Engine also enables banks to train, test and certify their teams in Temenos software solutions, offering access to the official Temenos content and certification processes found across the Temenos Learning Community suite of products.\n\nFollowing the launch, Byblos Bank, the third largest bank by assets in Lebanon, became one of the first clients to sign for the new offering. Lebanon-based Byblos Bank is a leading financial institution with operations in Armenia, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Iraq, Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. Byblos Bank will use TLC Engine to help drive and support change in its current digital transformation project that is delivering a new, upgraded Temenos T24 core banking platform.\n\nRaffoul Raffoul, AGM and Head of Group Organization Development, Information System & Operational Support at Byblos Bank, commented: “The need for digital change is greater than ever to cope with a rapidly changing marketplace. The speed at which we need to deliver change and new functionality demands the need for an online training solution. Signing for the TLC Engine to ensure success and drive change as part of our transformation project was an obvious choice. With the platform, we are able to prepare for each phase of implementation, and down the road ensure that our employees continue to be educated on best practices and new solutions. We will use TLC Engine to intelligently link technologies and incorporate business processes to implement technology in the most optimal way for our needs.”\n\nDale Thomas, Director of The Temenos Learning Community said: “The key to a project’s success is staff engagement, knowledge, and ability to use the new system to its full potential. With the launch of this new platform, we are bringing to new and existing clients easy-to-access knowledge of our products and technology, as well as personalized support from our experienced change management team. We are delighted that the launch of TLC Engine is accompanied by extending of our relationship with Byblos Bank, a long-term client of Temenos. We are already very proud to be helping Byblos Bank to deliver its upgrade project, and now to support the Bank in creating and implementing a change management program with TLC Engine.”\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of Temenos.\n\nMedia Contacts:\n\nJessica Wolfe\n\nTemenos Global Public Relations Manager\n\nTel: +1 610 232 2793\n\nEmail : [email protected]\n\nAlistair Kellie & Andrew Adie\n\nNewgate Communications on behalf of Temenos\n\nTel: +44 20 7680 6550\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nAbout Temenos\n\nTemenos AG (SIX: TEMN) (www.Temenos.com), headquartered in Geneva, is the world’s leader in banking software, partnering with banks and other financial institutions to transform their businesses and stay ahead of a changing marketplace.
