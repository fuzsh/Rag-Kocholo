        "text": "One of the Most Important Legal Rule Every Startup Founder Should Know: Over-Indebtedness ⚖ In my experience advising founders, I've noticed that not everyone is comfortable with the concept of over-indebtedness. Understandably, entrepreneurs have a lot on their plates. Yet, it's crucial to understand this to avoid personal liability. Let's shed some light! What is the General Rule? 🛡️ As a founder of an AG or GmbH, you are generally protected against liability. This means creditors of your company do not get access to your own money. What is the Exception? The major liability risk arises when the company becomes over-indebted (Art. 725b CO). Simply put, this means having more debts than assets. ⚖️ Why This Can Happen Quicker Than One might Think If the runway is getting shorter, there's a substantial risk. New bills (salaries, social security, etc.) come in like clockwork, while unexpectedly some customers don't pay. What to Do in case of a over-indebtedness? First, act quick, and do not ignore/postpone the problem. Then contact a specialized lawyer, it is worth the money. Why is this really important?🏛️ If these rules are violated, founders are personally liable with their own money towards any creditor. Some Practical Tips It is important to stay current on assets/liabilities. Also try to avoid debt and favor external equity unless you have a solid business model. Define a minimum cash reserve beforehand and take immediate action if it is not maintained (to avoid the runway situation described above). 💵📊 I hope this helps!\n\nWhat are the very early-stage Fintechs from CH & EU currently working on?🤔 According to the Demo Days of Tenity, it's everything but one sector. Last week, Tenity's Demo Day saw over 200 participants. Two days ago, I shared part 1 of the startup pitches, and here is part 2: 🚀 Arca from Spain Fighting the inefficiencies of our pension system by enabling companies to set up employer pension solutions. USP: hacked distribution by partnering with existing asset managers. 🌐 Darksquare from the UK Daniel Harman and his team built an investment marketplace for alternative assets aimed at professional investors. USP: comprehensive investment research on all offered assets. 🛡️ CyberTide from Germany Presented by Oleksandr Shyvakov helps regulated companies maintain compliance and data sensitivity. USP: an AI-based data-leakage prevention system. 📈 Kapnative from Germany Philipp Hemmersbach has developed a platform for wealth managers to access alternative assets. USP: a holistic, easy-to-use platform tailored to wealth managers' needs. 🌱 Resonanz from Switzerland Eleanor Willi and her team assist asset managers in saving hours on sustainability reporting. USP: a benchmark that compares the impact of voting, with CS coming in first last time. In summary, Fintech startups are focused on making asset management more efficient, secure, and democratized. However, it appears that blockchain is not as prevalent as it was at the more recent demo days (especially compared to AI). Has the mood shifted? Congrats, to the founders, and sorry again if I did not everything right :-D\n\nOne of the best parts of my job is that I get to listen to a lot of startups pitching, such as last week at the Demo Day of Tenity. As not everyone has the time to attend all these pitches, here is a quick recap of what is going on in the very-early stage Swiss Fintech market: 🚀 Zurichberg Ennio L. leads Zurichberg, democratizing access to high-end luxury watches. If you've always dreamed of owning a piece of a Patek Philippe but didn’t have access to it, this might be something for you. 💡 Newbridge SA My friend Denis Alexander Kuenzi helps traditional asset managers to make AI-driven investment decisions, particularly regarding crypto. If clients ask you how to invest in crypto but you don’t know all the nitty-gritty details, this might be something for you. 🤝 Lendit Lendit from Italy, led by Fabio Gancitano, connects lenders and borrowers with a twist: they partner with third-party platforms to facilitate the lending process. 🔍 MITI Karola Sisask helps asset managers save money and mitigate risks. This compliance co-pilot is evolving into a full auto-pilot, streamlining compliance processes and enhancing operational efficiency. Congratulations to Tenity for organizing such an amazing event. Great to see that you are pushing the Swiss Fintech ecosystem forward! P.S. Sorry to all the founders if I didn't get everything exactly right about what you are doing, I tried my best. Feel free to write in the comments about what you actually do :-) This was the first half of the startups pitching at the Demo Days. Later this week I will release part 2! 🚀✨\n\n🚀 You want to create your own startup but don't want to quit your job before finding investors? 🤔 Then you are facing a chicken-egg dilemma. Here are two ways to overcome it and one creative solution from an Italian unicorn founder. 💡 Aspiring founders often tell me: “I want to quit my job, but I need funding first. I have a family and need some written assurances before I quit.” 🛑 However, investors say: “We won’t invest until you quit your job. I won't sign anything, you quit, then we talk.” While I have tremendous sympathy for founders, I can relate to investors. If you put yourself as founder in the shoes of the investor, you most likely would also not invest, as you want to see the commitment of founders first. So, what can you do as a founder? 👨👩👦 Raise funds from family and friends who trust you. 📈 Start building traction on the side until you have enough conviction. In the video, there may be a third (admittedly creative) way, as Luca Ferrari, founder of Italian unicorn Bending Spoons, practiced. 🦄 I am curious to learn if you know someone who managed to raise before quitting their job. Let me know.\n\n🌟 On Monday, I had the pleasure of giving a talk on the Swiss experience with tokenization to US colleagues. Here are my three key messages: The Universität Zürich organized the inaugural Vanderbilt-Zurich Transatlantic Dialogue to foster collaboration across the pond. I was thrilled to share insights on the Swiss experience based on my PhD and Arcton 🤝. 1️⃣ The Swiss approach works 💪 Switzerland unlocked tokenization with just six articles by integrating into existing private law. Three years after the DLT Bill, this legislative approach has proven effective, setting a strong example for other countries. 2️⃣ Switzerland remains the leader in digital assets This is proven by the fact that a substantial part of RWA protocols chose CH-Law, fostering its leadership as the home of Crypto Valley. 🏆 3️⃣ So why isn't everything tokenized (yet)? 🤔 Tokenization alone provides only marginal improvements. What’s needed is a fundamental redesign of the financial market, which, from my observations, is on the horizon. 🔄 Thank you very much, Prof. Kern Alexander, for the invite, and thanks to the other speakers (especially from Vanderbilt University Law School) for their inspiring speeches!\n\n📬 Tired of receiving too many spam emails? Here's how I accidentally reduced my spam by 90% and how you can do the same! 🚀 Recently, the amount of spam emails I received was incredible. Even though I didn't respond, sorting through them took some mental effort. 🔍 Recently, I changed my LinkedIn name to include my new title as my first name. Since then, identifying spam has been quite easy! 📧 As spammers get my first name for their emails from LinkedIn, many spam emails now start with \"Hello Dr. Merens,\" making it clear this is spam. ✨ You can try this too by slightly changing your profile name. For example, switch your first and last names, e.g., change Paul Mustermann to Mustermann, Paul. 💡 If someone writes a personalized message, they will use the correct name order. If it's a spammer, you'll receive an email saying, \"Hello Mustermann.\" Give it a try and watch how easy it is to identify spam! Honestly, it has made my life much easier, and I hope it does the same for you. 📉✨\n\n🔍 As an entrepreneur, it might seem counterintuitive, but using an NDA during your financing round may not serve your best interests. In a previous post, I discussed why NDAs aren't the best tool for early-stage entrepreneurs. Instead of a legal approach, let me share a better approach we've successfully used at Arcton 👇 1. Shareable Pitch Deck Create a pitch deck that you're comfortable sharing widely. This lets you engage an unlimited number of investors confidently. 📈 2. Due Diligence on Investors Once an investor shows interest, perform a quick background check. Are they reputable? Have they invested in your competitors? 🔍 3. High-Level Data Room If you still have concerns, prepare a data room with high-level information. This secures your sensitive data while still highlighting the potential. 📊 If an investor remains interested and requests more sensitive details, then you might consider an NDA. But remember, if you haven’t built trust by this stage, it may not be wise to proceed. A strong relationship is crucial for a successful long-term partnership. 🚩 This is my personal opinion on this controversial topic. I'm eager to hear from other entrepreneurs: How have you navigated this issue in your ventures?\n\n🎉 Exciting News! I'm thrilled to announce that my dissertation on the digital share (aka the share token) has been published 🙏🎓! 🇨🇭 Three years ago, Switzerland demonstrated its leadership in innovation by introducing a groundbreaking concept: the share token. Let's illustrate the power of this legal innovation with some recent Swiss success stories, like On 👟, or Proton 🔐 In the past, companies like these issued physical shares, and investors had to wait 10 years before they could sell their shares on Nasdaq. Today, these companies can tokenize their shares and make them tradable on Uniswap Labs from day one, potentially disrupting startup investments. 📖 I am honored to present the first comprehensive monograph on this subject, which was awarded summa cum laude. In my work, I explore: • What is a digital share? 🤔 • How to issue digital shares legally? ⚖️ • Will all shares in the future be tokenized? 🚀 A huge thank you to everyone who supported me on this journey! 🫶🏼 Of course, my thesis has been published in open access and can be downloaded for free here (in German): https://lnkd.in/eASJzbs5 🚀 I hope you enjoy the read! 📚 P.S. In case you don't want to read the whole thing, just follow me; from time to time, I share some insights.\n\n🚫 You are an entrepreneur and consider asking an investor to sign an NDA? Probably not a great idea. And yet, we see it all the time. At Arcton, whenever we're checking out startups, we often get asked, \"Can you sign an NDA?\" (most recently yesterday)📝 If you're a first-time founder worried about keeping your ideas safe, it might seem like the way to go. But speaking from experience drafting these NDAs, I recommend you think twice (at lest for early-stage startups). Here’s why: Paperwork Nightmare 🚷 Investors aren't keen on reading through five pages of dense, legal jargon just to peek at your data room. They just might pass. The Investors Perspective 🧐 Investors are sometimes looking and talking with hundreds of startups. To be bound by hundreds of contracts, and keep track of them, is a nightmare. Protection is weaker than you think 🛡️ Enforcing an NDA involves you proving a breach and then sue the investor. This is a difficult, time-consuming and also costly endeavor: highly unlikely for a company looking for money... The Bottom Line: By insisting on an NDA, you are pushing away seasoned investors for a safety net that is not existing. The good news is I have a better alternative. Stay tuned for my next post 🚀"
