        "text": "Banking Software Company\n\nTemenos AG (SIX: TEMN) is a company specialising in enterprise software for banks and financial services, with its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Temenos was initially created in 1993, and has been listed on the Swiss stock exchange since 2001.\n\nCompany profile\n\n[edit]\n\nFounded in 1993 and listed on the Swiss stock exchange (SIX: TEMN), Temenos AG is a provider of banking software systems to retail, corporate, universal, private, treasury, fund administration, Islamic, microfinance and community banks. Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and with 67 offices in 40 countries, Temenos serves over 3,000 financial institutions in 145 countries across the world.[3][2] It claims to be used by 41 of the top 50 banks worldwide.[2][3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company was established in November 1993 by George Koukis and Kim Goodall, having acquired the rights to GLOBUS, the successful banking software platform developed by a team of technical and banking experts in 1988. The company was renamed to Temenos, in reference to a lecture on money given by Hans-Wolfgang Frick at the Temenos Academy[4] (1992), and continued to develop and market GLOBUS.\n\nIn 2001, Temenos went public,[5] and is listed on the main segment of the SWX Swiss Exchange (TEMN). Also in 2001, Temenos acquired a mainframe core banking application aimed at high-end retail banks, originally developed by IBM, and now marketed as Temenos Corebanking.[citation needed]\n\nOn 30 September 2003, Temenos launched its T24 banking package. T24 was based on GLOBUS,[6] but with a state-of-the-art banking technology platform. This was the result of 3 years of development effort and an investment of more than US$24 million.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2011, George Koukis stepped down as chairman and became a non-executive director,[7] and Andreas Andreades became chairman.\n\nIn 2021, Temenos launched a new collaborative fintech marketplace, Temenos Exchange.[8]\n\nIn February 2024, American short-selling firm Hindenburg Research released a report alleging \"major accounting irregularities\" at Temenos.[9] Temenos denied the allegations, and announced an independent review.[10][11] The independent review was published in April 2024, finding that the allegations made by Hindenburg Research were \"inaccurate and misleading.\"[12]\n\nAcquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nCompanies acquired by Temenos, listed by year Year Company Country 2007 Actis.bsp[13] Germany 2008 Financial Objects Ltd[14] United Kingdom 2008 Lydian Associates Ltd[15] United Kingdom 2009 Viveo[16] France 2010 FE Mobile[17] United Kingdom 2010 Odyssey Financial Technologies[18][19] Luxembourg 2011 Primisyn[20] Canada 2012 Edge IPK[21] United Kingdom 2013 Trinovus[22] United States 2015 Akcelerant[23] United States 2015 Multifonds[24] Luxembourg 2017 Rubik Financial Limited ('Rubik')[25] Australia 2018 Avoka[26] United States 2019 Htrunk Software Solutions[27][28] India 2019 Logical Glue United Kingdom 2019 Kony, Inc United States / India"
