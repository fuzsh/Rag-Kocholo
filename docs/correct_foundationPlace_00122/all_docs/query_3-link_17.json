        "text": "If you are considering the Imago training course, the best way to know if it is for you is to hear feedback from therapists who attended the course.\n\nWhat was their experience of the training course?\n\nWhat was their experience of the clinical instructor, Kalanit Ben-Ari?\n\nAnd if you are still not sure, what do they think you need to know?\n\nYou've been working diligently with individual clients, helping them navigate their personal challenges. Yet, you sense there's a deeper layer to their struggles, often rooted in their relationships. You're eager to provide holistic support, but your current training hasn't delved deeply into the intricacies of relationship dynamics.\n\nPerhaps you're in private practice, encountering clients who are grappling with relationship issues, even if they come to you alone. They might be struggling with past relationships, current partners, or the fear of future connections. You want to equip yourself with the tools to guide them effectively.\n\nOr maybe you're in an institutional setting, like a university or college, where young adults are navigating the complexities of new relationships. They're forming bonds, breaking them, and seeking meaning in these connections. You aspire to be their beacon, guiding them through these turbulent times.\n\nYou've also considered expanding your practice to work with couples. You're aware of the unique challenges and rewards of couple therapy and are keen to embark on this journey. The \"Imago Foundations Course\" promises to be your starting point, introducing you to the world of couples therapy and equipping you with foundational skills.\n\nAnd here's the cherry on top: Dive into the course with confidence, knowing you have a 30-day exploration period. Engage with the rich content, understand the Imago dialogue, and start applying these insights into your practice. If, within these 30 days, you feel this isn't the right fit for your professional journey, you're backed by a full refund guarantee. Your commitment to your clients' well-being and your professional growth is commendable, and this course is here to support you every step of the way.\n\nIn our journey as therapists, we continuously seek ways to deepen our understanding and enhance the support we offer to our clients. Relationships, with all their complexities, are at the heart of many challenges our clients face. Whether you're working with individuals or couples, understanding the dynamics of relationships is crucial.\n\nI am genuinely passionate about the Imago Relationship Therapy approach and its transformative potential. In a world where relationships are often strained and misunderstood, the need for effective relationship therapy is paramount. By embracing the principles and techniques of Imago, you can bring about profound changes in your clients' lives, helping them navigate their relationships with clarity, empathy, and joy.\n\nI don't want you to reflect a year from now, thinking about the couples or individuals you could have better supported, pondering the deeper connections you could have facilitated. I want you to be equipped with the tools and insights that can truly make a difference in your clients' lives.\n\nJoin me in this journey with the \"Imago Foundations Course\". Let's work together to empower our clients, helping them understand, heal, and strengthen their relationships. Let's embark on this transformative path, ensuring that every session you conduct resonates with understanding, compassion, and positive change.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nDr. Kalanit Ben-Ari\n\nWith a passion for my work, I am dedicated to helping couples strengthen their romances and re-fire the love in their relationships. I have extensive experience working with couples and families helping them establish and maintain the relationship they desire as well as facilitating relationship workshops. I have worked as a couples therapist and parental advisor for the past 20 years and have a private clinic in Hampstead, London. Following my passion for writing I published two books, one for parents Small Steps to Great Parenting which is an Amazon Best seller, and one for children The Lost Book.\n\nIn my own personal life, I am married to Adi and we have two wonderful daughters.\n\nProfessionally, I gained a BA and an MA in Social Work, specialising in Clinical Child Development, at the University of Haifa, Israel. I gained a Doctorate in Psychology at the Institute for the Study of Children, Families and Social Issues, Birkbeck, University of London. My main research area was the influence of psychological processes and childhood experiences on adult romantic relationships. I am an Advanced Certified Imago Therapist and was the Chair of Imago UK from 2013-2023. I also served on the IRI (Imago Relationship International) Board of Directors during 2016-2017. I was trained by Harville Hendrix, founder of Imago Relationship Therapy an internationally recognised relationship therapy approach. I am an Associate of the Imago International Training Institute which entails training and supervising therapists to become certified Imago relationship therapists.\n\nIn addition, I am a public speaker and feel privileged and fortunate to be invited to speak and train on various topics all over the world.\n\nI frequently teach and lecture on a variety of parental and couples topics, and I am a certified workshop presenter for some of the best known parenting programmes (e.g., “How to Talk So Kids Will Listen”, and “Connected Parents-Thriving Kids”) and couples (\"Getting The Love You Want\"). I have also developed my own unique programme for parents, based on two decades of clinical work with families. I teach in parenting groups at my clinic, community and educational centres.\n\nAs it is my belief that we are ever evolving and growing, I continually update my professional education by undertaking numerous courses and training sessions. This enables me to provide the most cutting edge and evidence based therapeutic interventions to my clinical and trainee clients. Recent examples include achieving Brainspotting (Level 2) and attending Neurofeedback training as well as holding an Advanced Diploma in Transpersonal Psychotherapy.\n\nI look forward to working with you,\n\nKalanit.\n\nhttps://www.kalanitbenari.com/"
