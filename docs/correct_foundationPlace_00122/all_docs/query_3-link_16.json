According to the press release, TS Banking Group will migrate the entirety of its banking operations to Temenos’ platform.\n\nWith $1.5 billion in banking and fiduciary assets and locations across the Midwest, TS Banking Group is a multi-chartered bank holding company. TS Banking Group will be represented by three brands: TS Bank, The Bank of Tioga and First National Bank and Trust Company. Community banking leader, TS Banking Group will implement Temenos’ pre-composed banking services across the three banks to increase profitability and deliver world-class banking experiences with a local touch.\n\nWith a mission to IGNITE PROSPERITY, TS Banking Group will reinvest 10% of its net income locally as well as host educational events and partner with local and nonprofit organizations.\n\n“We chose to partner with Temenos because we believe it is the best possible way for us to serve our employees, clients and communities into the foreseeable future. In the debate between relationship banking and digital banking, we are committed to delivering the best of both for our communities. The Temenos Banking Cloud will provide us with the agility of a challenger bank, and the investment in innovation of the larger banks, in a way we would otherwise be unable to achieve. With this open platform, we will reach new communities that are typically underserved, and provide seamless experiences and support to our local farmers, businesses, families and communities,” Kevin Forristall, the President of TS Banking Group, commented.\n\nRoman Bartik, the President of Americas at Temenos, added: “We are delighted that TS Banking Group has selected the Temenos Banking Cloud as a foundation to support their ongoing mission to spearhead banking in rural communities. Temenos Banking Cloud is the platform of choice for banks whether they are digital-first or traditional brick and mortar banks. This signing with TS Banking Group follows strong growth and customer success in the U.S. market. Temenos’ cloud platform paves the way for banks to deliver mission-driven products and services that delight their customers, and we look forward to partnering with TS Banking Group.”\n\nESG Investing-as-a-Service Offering\n\nRecently, Temenos announced that it launched ESG Investing-as-a-service, targeting banks and wealth managers.\n\nThe service runs on Temenos Banking Cloud, on any cloud or on-premise, allowing time-to-market for ESG compliant products and reporting while reducing development costs. Temenos front office, market data management and digital capabilities are combined with external data feeds from multiple providers, including filtering, scoring and modelling techniques.\n\nTemenos, a SIX-listed banking software company, announced on Wednesday that TS Banking Group, an Iowa-based banking institution, has tapped their banking services on the cloud.
