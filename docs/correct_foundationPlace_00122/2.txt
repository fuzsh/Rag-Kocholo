Temenos Group, the Swiss software specialist for financial services, has joined the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology Foundation (LHoFT) as a "Leadership Circle Partner."

Temenos Group joins 11 other members of LHoFT's "Leadership Circle", joining the BCEE, BGL BNP Paribas, Clearstream, Deloitte Digital, Foyer Group, KPMG, POST, PwC, Six Payment Services, Société Générale and Telindus.

"We are incredibly excited to have Temenos join our Leadership Circle," Nasir Zubairi, chief executive at LHoFT, said.

"Temenos has been at the forefront of innovation for a long time, and its experience, in collaboration with the LHoFT, can really help drive fintech forward."

Ben Robinson, chief strategy officer at Temenos and head of community for the Temenos MarketPlace, said the partnership would help his company to "grow the community around MarketPlace and to uncover the most exciting fintech companies."

Temenos and the LHoFT are working together on two events that will take place over the coming weeks.

One of the events revolves around a group of teenagers from the Luxembourg Tech School who will answer the question "What does the bank of the future look like?" while being guided by senior technology and business mentors.

The other event, which will take place in July, is a conference on how to master moving from traditional banking to open-banking with the Second Payment Services Directive.
