Possessing a literary bent of mind, he aspired to become a journalist and a writer. In 1921, at a very young age, he became the Chief Editor of the daily Zamindar, Lahore’s leading nationalist Urdu paper. He soon plunged into nationalist politics, was imprisoned by the British, and never looked back. He had an eventful legislative career in the UP Assembly during 1936-56. He wrote on a variety of subjects in an inimitable style and almost always without the help of recorded notes. He has written in Urdu a study of poet Iqbal, whom he knew intimately during his days in Lahore. This work was hailed by literary critics as a landmark treatment of the topic. He also wrote a history of the Khilafat Movement in the Urdu book Tahreek-e-Khilafat, of which this book is an English translation.\n\nAli Amjad was once a recognized name in India’s labor movement.

Because of his deep involvement with India’s freedom movement and workers’ rights movement, he was often incarcerated for long periods of time. After migrating to Pakistan, he formally chose the field of labor law for the defense of workers’ rights as a senior lawyer of Pakistan’s supreme court. His Urdu novel Kali Mati (‘Black Soil’) is based on the historic labor strike of 1958 at the Tata Steel plant in Jamshedpur, and is partly autobiographical, as detailed in his Urdu memoir Shakh-e-Nehal-e-Gham (‘A Branch of the Sapling of Sorrow’). The novel also quite brilliantly unpacks the conspiratorial plot leading to the communal violence of Jamshedpur in 1964.\n\nAli Amjad was once a recognized name in India’s labor movement.

It is cause for much reassurance that serious-minded Urdu readers, some venerable magazines, and a few dedicated friends and associates have praised the memoir in appropriate words and raised my confidence. Otherwise, in the last half a century, all my books and articles on topics in anthropology that were published are in English, the language that became the tool of my teaching and academic employment. Reading and writing in Urdu had been left behind in Lucknow half a century ago."
