He highlighted the objectives of the Indian Constitution and the interpretation power of the Supreme Court, particularly with regard to Article 21. He recalled landmark cases such as AK Gopalan v. State of Madras, Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, Golaknath v. State of Punjab, and the Keshavanand Bharati judgment, which introduced the basic structure doctrine. He also praised the contribution of members of the bar, such as MC Setalvad, the first Attorney General of India.\n\nReferring to the statement of Justice Hamidullah Beg in the Kesavananda Bharati case, he said it is clear from the Preamble and provisions of Parts III and IV of the Constitution of India that it seeks to express the principle salus populi suprema lex, i.e., the good of the masses of the country is the supreme law embodied in our Constitution, prefaced as it is, by the Preamble which puts 'justice, social, economic and political' as the first of the four objectives of the Constitution.\n\nHe urged the students to draw inspiration from the true sons of Mother India and reiterated that the bar needs young and talented minds as its torchbearers.

State of Kerela, Har Govind Pant v. Raghukul Tilak and S. R. Bommai v. Union of India which set the tone and tenor of Indian polity for the times to come.\n\nIn his address, Justice Aditya Nath Mittal, Judge, Allahabad High Court stated that the most attractive section of the Indian Constitution is Article 21 which was interpreted at length in AK Gopalan v. Meneka Gandhi case. He also pointed out that the right to liberty has to be curtailed by the procedure established by law.\n\nProf. Mohd. Ashraf, Chairman, Department of Law extended the vote of thanks.\n\nTanya Pandey and Mahelaqa Abrar conducted the programme.\n\nLater, Justice Murari visited the historical buildings of the university and paid tributes to the founder, Sir Syed Ahmad Khan by visiting his mausoleum in the premises of the University Jama Masjid.\n\nPublic Relations Office\n\nAligarh Muslim University\n\nALIGARH May 15: The Aligarh Muslim University Girls’ School organized several competitive events under the series of programmes by AMU schools on the theme of G20 summit under India’s presidency.\n\nIn the Debate Competition under junior group (VI to VIII), Innaya Firdaus (AMUGS), Aiman Hasan (AMUGS) and Afreen (ABKGS) won the first, second and third prizes respectively, while Bharti Yadav (ASVC) was given the consolation prize.\n\nIn the Essay Writing Competition under junior group, Fauzia Shakeel (CGHS), Zynah Arif (AMUGS) and Amina Hasan (AMUGS), respectively got the first, second and third prizes, while under the senior group (IX-XII), Mehvish (CGHS), Sumaiya Kayenat (AMUGS) and Sana Parveen (CGHS) received the first, second and third prizes, respectively.\n\nAmber Mirza (CGHS), Madiha Masroor (AMUGS) and Sidra Ashraf (MUGS) won the first, second and third prizes, respectively, in the Poster Making Competition under the junior group, while under the senior group, firs, second and third prizes went to Azka (SSSG), Zoha Khan (AMUGS) and Sarah Waqar (AMUGS).\n\nIn the Slogan Writing Competition, Kulsum Shahid (CGHS), Somi Ali (AMUGS) and Zainab (CGHS)got the first, second and third prizes under junior group while Himanshi (AMUGS), Iqra Khan (SSSG) and Shaizatul Fatma (SSSG) won the first, second and third prizes under the senior group.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ahmadi School for the Visually Challenged, Aligarh Muslim University organized intra-school activities under the G20 celebration programme, including the slogan writing, essay writing, logo making, Quiz and drawing competitions for students belonging to various classes under senior and junior groups.\n\nThe essay writing competition for senior group was held on “Significance of History in Governance”, while the junior group participants wrote essay on “Importance of Discipline in the life of Students”.\n\nIn the logo making competition (in Braille) under senior group, Kaif Chand (X) won the first prize and Md.

This soft power can exert great influence and shape the world order in different ways. He mentioned several thinkers and philosophers who have influenced the world. “Social sciences and literature offer important perspectives to question things and generate a new thinking which leads us to go beyond our narrow concerns”, he added.\n\nProf Mohibul Haq, Department of Political Science, AMU pointed out that India’s G20 Presidency is a moment of pride for us and there is a lot of hope since India can speak for the global south on issues like poverty and hunger. He critically analysed various dimensions of G20 and how capitalism, and neoliberalism are shaping the world order.\n\n“In the backdrop of the struggle for power and dominance, India through G20 is trying to highlight that cooperation is the key and peace has to travel beyond the Middle East and Latin America” he said.\n\nProf Haq also praised India’s foreign policy by mentioning that India did not abandon Russia when NATO imposed sanctions on it in the wake of Ukraine invasion.\n\nHighlighting the usefulness of the monograph on G20 in Urdu, Prof Shafey Kidwai, Department of Mass Communication, AMU said that Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, the founder of AMU launched Aligarh Institute Gazette in 1866 and wrote on international relations, the ideas of John Stuart Mill, an influential English philosopher of the nineteenth century and other such topics. “The publication of an Urdu monograph on G20 is the continuation of the tradition started by Sir Syed for enlightening oriental languages readers”, he said.\n\nProf Razaullah Khan, former Principal, ZHCET, AMU added a note of caution saying that G20 should not remain a club of rich and powerful countries. “Instead, the focus should be on raising the concerns of the poor countries which remain under-represented in the international forums and have no say on issues related to their livelihood and exploitation of natural resources'', he said, urging to maintain equilibrium and balance on earth and utilization of resources.\n\nEarlier, welcoming the guests and speakers, Prof Ali Mohammad Naqvi, Director, Sir Syed Academy said that 80 percent of the world economy is rotated through G20 countries. “Today the economic power has more value and weight as the world is becoming multipolar and the monopoly of traditional powers is withering away. In this context G20 is a big forum for international cooperation and collaborations”, Prof Naqvi highlighted.\n\nHe informed that in the series of 5 monographs on G20, the first monograph by Asad Faisal Farooqui is being released today.\n\nProposing a vote of thanks, Dr. Mohammad Shahid, Deputy Director, Sir Syed Academy said that ‘G20 - Sir Syed Memorial Lecture’ and an international seminar on G20 will be organized in the month of July and August 2023 respectively.\n\nDr Syed Hussain Haider conducted the proceedings.\n\nPublic Relations Office\n\nAligarh Muslim University\n\nPadma Bhushan: Mr Shyam Saran delivers G-20 Sir Syed Memorial Lecture\n\nAligarh, July 15:\n\nIn a gathering of distinguished minds, the highly anticipated G-20 Sir Syed Memorial Lecture on the topic: “India and West Asia : How India’s Western Neighborhood is Changing and Impacting on India's Foreign Policy”, took place today at Aligarh Muslim University . The venue JNMC Auditorium was abuzz with excitement as Mr. Shyam Saran, a seasoned diplomat and Padma Bhushan awardee, graced the stage as the distinguished speaker.\n\nIn his opening remark Mr. Saran said that this a special occasion as the Nation is hosting the G-20 Summit which reaffirms India’s role at the International Arena. He emphasized that Sir Syed Ahmad Khan was not only the founder of AMU the historic Institution, but he was also a crusader for emancipating minds through pursuit of knowledge.\n\nTalking about the latest developments that are taking place in West Asia, he said this is the region where Islam was born and flourished across the world including India; “I see the changes taking place in both the Sunni World Centred in Saudi Arabia and the Shia World Centred in Iran. These Changes encompass society and culture, politics and economics and these in turn are re-orienting the foreign policies of West Asian states. They are changing the manner in which other states are engaging West Asia. India has to be vigilant about the huge shift in the neighborhood”, he added.\n\nPointing on the energy revolution, he said this region sits on the largest pool of oil and every producer is deeply committed to economic diversification and Saudi Arabia is leading the way. Climate Change is accentuating the shift away from fossil fuels and it is the gulf kingdoms which are aspiring to become leaders in renewable energy. India must now adjust to the fact that these economies are in the midst of significant economic restructuring and that entirely new opportunities are opening up for expanded partnership between India and West Asian countries.\n\nSaudi Arabia is promoting tourism and for that pre-Islamic sites are being renovated and restored. Dubai is a model for Saudi Arabia, which has been an outlier in the region in respect of its cosmopolitanism. The other region witnessing change is Iran, he remarked.\n\nTalking about the diplomatic dimension he said; there are nine million Indians who live and work in the Middle East and the remittances they send to India are substantial. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have become major resources of foreign investment in India. India also has important security stakes in the eastern as well as western regions of the Indian Ocean. The normalization of relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia is the most significant development.\n\nHe said, India has pursued a bilateral and to some extent a transactional approach in managing its relations with the countries of West Asia and this has been quite successful. It has been able to expand its relations with the Arab states even while consolidating and expanding its relations with Israel. India's foreign policy in West Asia has been justifiably applauded as having been successful in reinforcing its historic and cultural ties with the countries of the region, he added.\n\nI see a more exciting phase unfolding in West Asia, one which could multiply opportunities for India, but only if we remain ahead of the learning curve of a more complex and transformational change taking place in India's western neighborhood, Mr Saran concluded.\n\nPresiding over the event, the Vice-Chancellor of AMU, Prof. Mohammad Gulrez, expressed his delight at the presence of Mr. Shyam Saran and the opportunity to gain invaluable insights into India's foreign policy. Prof. Gulrez emphasized the significance of this lecture series in fostering intellectual discourse and deepening understanding among the academic community and beyond.\n\nInviting Mr. Saran to visit the university again Prof. Gulrez said “whoever drinks from the Nile, will always return to it. This is also true for Aligarh Muslim University”.\n\nThe Registrar of AMU Mr. Mohammad Imran (IPS) briefly introduced Mr. Shyam Saran and highlighted his significant contribution to the multilateral economic , climate change, energy security and other strategic areas central to India’s foreign policy.\n\nIn his welcome address Director, Sir Syed Academy Prof Ali Mohammad Naqvi said AMU has played a significant role in fostering India’s relationship with West Asian countries. Dr. Mohammad Shahid, the Deputy Director, the Academy, while offering vote of thanks said Sir Syed Academy will continue to play a pivotal role in promoting intellectual and cultural activities.\n\nThe event, organized by Sir Syed Academy of AMU, witnessed an illustrious audience consisting of faculty members, students, and dignitaries from various fields.
