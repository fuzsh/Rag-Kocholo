        "text": "We’ve all seen him strutting down the runway, bagging major fashion campaigns and receiving praise for noteworthy performances in film and TV, but few know Omer Shahzad beyond his brooding good looks and professional success. Â Sana Zehra meets the promising star to dig deep\n\nYouâ€™re on the cover of our Valentineâ€™s Day issue, so of course, we have to start off by asking about your love life. Are you in love and is marriage on the cards?Â\n\nItâ€™s too early for me to disclose, but if anything materialises, Iâ€™ll let you know. Iâ€™m a firm believer in the institution of marriage and envision myself taking the plunge when the time is right, which will be soon hopefully.\n\nâ€œIâ€™m a firm believer in the institution of marriage and envision myself taking the plunge when the time is rightâ€\n\nâ€œIâ€™m a firm believer in the institution of marriage and envision myself taking the plunge when the time is rightâ€\n\nWhatâ€™s your take on modern romance? Why do you think the percentage of long-lasting relationships has decreased in your generation?Â\n\nIâ€™m a pretty old-school guy, so canâ€™t relate to the dynamics of modern romance. Iâ€™m a reserved person, an introvert, so it takes me time to open up to people. This means itâ€™s not easy for me to trust anyone enough to get into a relationship with them. However, once I am in one, I make sure I honour it with all I have. Itâ€™s crucial to fully understand someone before committing to them, but I find a lot of young people these days rush into relationships they arenâ€™t truly ready for. When the inevitable problems occur, they find it hard to cope and look for an escape.\n\nDo you believe love is blind?\n\nNo. Real love is not blind, infatuation is. If you decide to spend your life with someone, your fundamental value system needs to be the same. Of course, no two people can be completely identical, and you have to accept your partner with his or her quirks. However, that applies to certain habits, not principles and core personality traits. Love is a sacred emotion, it needs to be shared with caution.\n\nIf you were to give one piece of advice to young couples, what would it be?\n\nLosing a relationship hurts, but losing yourself in a relationship hurts more. Be wise.\n\nMoving on to your professional life, tell us how you started your modelling career.\n\nI auditioned as a model for Bridal Couture Week in 2012 and got selected amongst 200 male models. Havenâ€™t looked back since then.\n\nâ€œNo two people can be completely identical, and you have to accept your partner with his or her quirks. However, that applies to certain habits, not principles and core personality traitsâ€\n\nWe noticed you were missing during the promotions of your film Jawani Phir Nahi Aani 2 (JPNA2). Why was that?Â\n\nI donâ€™t want to get into details but I was missing because the team never informed me of the promotions. It obviously felt bad; I had high expectations from this project. Things clearly didnâ€™t pan out as I had assumed.\n\nHow has JPNA2 prepared you for your leap into feature films?\n\nSince I come from a modelling background, acting has proven to be a completely new experience for me. However, itâ€™s an avenue Iâ€™ve always wanted to explore and JPNA2 was just the beginning. The movie provided me some much needed insight and understanding of how things work in the industry.\n\nTell us about your upcoming projects.\n\nIâ€™m very excited about my upcoming drama Gul-o-Gulzaar. Itâ€™s a labour of love; a project very close to my heart.\n\nIn one of your interviews, you claimed being better than Hrithik Roshan. Why are Bollywood actors a benchmark?\n\nBollywood is a benchmark for obvious reasons. Weâ€™ve been watching Indian movies since years, and while Lollywood is finally on the right track, itâ€™s still growing as an industry. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with acknowledging that Bollywoodâ€™s filming standards are high, nor is there anything wrong with us trying to achieve the same. In fact, doing so is what will eventually make the local audience choose Pakistani films over Indian ones, something weâ€™ve been able to do successfully with television.\n\nâ€œI was missing because the team never informed me of the promotions. It obviously felt bad; I had high expectations from this projectâ€\n\nTell us about your obsession with fitness.Â\n\nIâ€™m a fitness model, itâ€™s what I do for a living. The body I have today is something Iâ€™ve worked extremely hard to achieve and continue pushing myself daily to maintain. Trust me, itâ€™s not an easy job. Iâ€™m proud of my body because itâ€™s a product of a lot of heavy labour.\n\nHow do you overcome setbacks?\n\nIâ€™m a very optimistic person and always focus on the positives more than the negatives. Life is full of disappointments and challenges, particularly professional ones. This attitude of mine helps me bounce back from failure each time.\n\nâ€œThereâ€™s nothing wrong with acknowledging that Bollywoodâ€™s standards of filming are great, nor is there anything wrong with us trying to achieve the sameâ€\n\nWhatâ€™s one lesson you had to learn the hard way?Â\n\nThe biggest lessons in life are always learnt the hard way. Experiencing loss you werenâ€™t prepared for makes you grow and turn into a version of yourself you never expected to become. For me, the turning point in my life was when my mother passed away. It was as if my biggest support, the pillar I always leaned on, had been taken away from me. I knew the only way to survive was to rely on no one but myself; to be self-sufficient and independent.\n\nWhat does a typical day in your life look like?Â\n\nI work throughout the day, every day. Once Iâ€™m home I change and go out for a walk, come back, have dinner and jump straight into bed. So, a typical day in my life is pretty mundane and predictable. On the occasional day off though, I try spending time with family and friends.\n\nSHORT & SWEET\n\nDo you believe in love at first sight?\n\nYes, definitely.\n\nHow do you celebrate Valentineâ€™s Day?Â\n\nHonestly, I donâ€™t celebrate Valentineâ€™s Day.\n\nDream date?\n\nVisiting the locations in London that are close to my heart with my significant other.\n\nPerfect Valentineâ€™s Day song?Â\n\nAaj janay ki zid na kero\n\nMost embarrassing memory?\n\nI had a major crush on one of my teachers in school. The day I finally decided to muster up some guts and profess my love to her, she revealed what I had done to the whole class. I was awfully embarrassed.\n\nDescribe yourself in three words.\n\nSensitive, Reserved, Hilarious\n\nA superstition you believe in?\n\nWishing upon a fallen lash.\n\nWhen and where was the last time you danced?\n\nAt my sisterâ€™s wedding a few years back and for a song in JPNA2.\n\nHidden talent?\n\nI can sing, but that isnâ€™t a hidden talent anymore.\n\nDream project?\n\nA good action film.\n\nGreatest fear?\n\nLosing the people I love. Also, Iâ€™m petrified of roller coasters.\n\nImagine you are the PM of our country. What three things would keep you up at night?\n\nPoverty, Lack of resourcesÂ , Ever-growing crime rate\n\nGreatest weakness?\n\nMy gym\n\nGreatest strength?\n\nMy family\n\nModels: Â Omer Shahzad and Janira Ider\n\nDesigner: Â HSY\n\nPhotography & Concept: Â Shakeel Bin Afzal\n\nLocation: Â Parklane London\n\nWhat Dreams Are Made Of\n\nHow did you meet?Â\n\nNuscie: We met in the year 1964 in Nathia Gali, where I had come to prepare for my Senior Cambridge exams and Jeelo was visiting with family. Within three to four days of getting to know each other, he asked me to marry him.\n\nJJ: I saw her for the first time in Nathia Gali, when I was eighteen and she was sixteen. I remember staring at her as she walked up a path. Iâ€™ve been in love with her since that moment.\n\nThe day you got married, do you think you fully comprehended what a lifetime together would look like? What were your expectations from marriage?Â\n\nNuscie: Â I certainly had no idea, I was way too young. Marriage has a lot to do with luck because you never truly get to know someone until you live with them. Iâ€™ve been fortunate because not only did JJ turn out to be a very fine person, but my in-laws too were loving and refined people.\n\nJJ:Â The only expectation I had while getting married was to be able to hold on to her for the rest of my life.\n\nWhatâ€™s the most challenging part about marriage?Â\n\nNuscie: JJ and I are very different in certain ways. Iâ€™m always working and travelling, while heâ€™s more of a homebody who prefers being home with his children, dogs, music and books. When you have equality and trust in a relationship though, no difference is big enough to come between two people.\n\nJJ: Jealousy\n\nAnd the most rewarding?Â\n\nNuscie: The most rewarding outcome of our beautiful marriage has been our two children, Nadia & Omar. I also cherish the relationship we have with each otherâ€™s families. Jeelo is very close to my younger (and only) sister and her twoÂ daughters.\n\nJJ: For me, just looking at her every day is the most rewarding part of our marriage.\n\nWhatâ€™s the most romantic thing your partner has done for you?\n\nNuscie: JJ is the more romantic one out of the two of us. He still writes poetry and sings for me. He has a beautiful voice, which our son, Omar, has inherited from him.\n\nJJ: Just smiling at me. It makes my day.\n\nWhat are some of the milestones with your partner that you remember most fondly?Â\n\nNuscie: Iâ€™ve lived a fairytale life. Itâ€™s the stuff dreams are made of. Way too many milestones to put on paper.\n\nJJ: There are way too many.\n\nWhat gets you through the tough times?Â\n\nNuscie: The most difficult time in our marriage was when our first child, Zain, died. He was a little under two years old. I donâ€™t think we ever fully recovered from that pain.\n\nJJ: Faith. When we lost our first born, Zain, we were devastated. It was faith that kept us strong and allowed us to mature as individuals and partners.\n\nThe one thing you love and one thing you hate most about your partner?Â\n\nNuscie: There are so many things to love about JJ. He is a wonderful human being; humble, loving and kind. The one habit of his that I would like to change though, is making him less antisocial. I really have to drag him out of the house.\n\nJJ: I love everything about her but the only thing I disapprove of is her scolding the house help.\n\nWhat do you think has been the secret to your successful marriage?Â\n\nNuscie:Â Love, love & love.\n\nJJ: Understanding, tolerating and loving each other every step of the way.\n\nHow do you think couples these days are different from your generation?Â\n\nNuscie: Young peopleÂ nowadays donâ€™t have the patience to make a marriage work. Getting used to a new way of life, and getting adjusted to each otherâ€™s families takes hard work and commitment. One has to learn to make their partner a priority.\n\nJJ: Human relations are the same, they donâ€™t change. The only thing that changes are cultural norms.\n\nWhich one piece of marriage advice would you give to new couples?\n\nNuscie: Be patient, loving and respectful. No amount of material wealth will give you happiness if your life is devoid of love and good relationships.\n\nJJ : Try to forgive each otherâ€™s mistakes and tolerate each otherâ€™s idiosyncrasies.\n\nCredits:Â Text: Areesha Chaudhry – Photos Courtesy:Â Nuscie & Jalil\n\nA Filmi Twist\n\nHow did you meet?Â\n\nFarheen: We had an arranged marriage but with a slight filmi twist. Our mothers planned for us to meet at a restaurant without telling us it was a setup. After hours of intense conversation, I knew I would say yes to Adnan if he proposed.\n\nAdnan: We met through our mothers, when they tricked us into believing their well-planned setup was a coincidental meeting. My mother ended up asking Farheen and her mother to join us at our table, and the rest is history.\n\nThe day you got married, do you think you fully comprehended what a lifetime together would look like? What were your expectations from marriage?Â\n\nFarheen: Yes and no. I donâ€™t think anyone can fully comprehend what marriage entails until you seal the deal. I didnâ€™t expect the infinite amount of encouragement I got from Adnan to pursue my goals. Iâ€™m very grateful.\n\nAdnan: Being an avid sportsman, I thought of marriage as walking into another sports arena, where a great match awaited me. Turned out, in this game sheâ€™s the tougher player who exceeds expectations every day. However, with a set of twins to raise now, I feel itâ€™s time to juggle responsibilities.\n\nWhatâ€™s the most challenging part about marriage?Â\n\nFarheen: Â Accepting your spouse for who they are, compromising on a daily basis and not letting ego come between your marriage.\n\nAdnan: Being selfless and sharing your time.\n\nAnd the most rewarding?Â\n\nFarheen: The little moments: sharing a cup of tea, listening to Bowie, going out for paan, discussing books and movies.\n\nAdnan: Having a confidant and critic. Iâ€™m ridiculously lucky and still wonder what I did right to deserve her.\n\nWhatâ€™s the most romantic thing your partner has done for you?\n\nFarheen: He arranged the most romantic dinner for our first Valentineâ€™s Day together. Between the two of us, heâ€™s definitely the more romantic one.\n\nAdnan: Iâ€™m usually the one making an effort in this department. She goes out of her way to make me feel special every year on my birthday though. As soon as the clock chimes midnight, she makes sure everything is about me.\n\nWhat are some of the milestones with your partner that you remember most fondly?Â\n\nFarheen: There are so many of them. Itâ€™s hard to choose.\n\nAdnan: Quite a few. I should have kept a diary.\n\nWhat gets you through the tough times?Â\n\nFarheen: Communication. Weâ€™ve discovered talking things through always helps.\n\nAdnan: Proper meetings. Iâ€™m serious! Nothing better than discussing the matter at hand, face to face.\n\nThe one thing you love and one thing you hate most about your partner?Â\n\nFarheen: I love how supportive he is of my personal and professional endeavors, and his undying concern for my wellbeing. Hate that he gets lazy at times.\n\nAdnan: I love so many things about her. From the way she keeps me grounded, to her minimal aesthetic, her forthrightness and love for life. I hate when she gets into unnecessary details while explaining things to people though.\n\nWhat do you think has been the secret to your successful marriage?Â\n\nFarheen: Â Not taking the whole marriage thing very seriously!\n\nAdnan: Finding balance in each other, pushing each other to achieve our goals and sharing a love for the arts, travel and fashion. Most importantly, our beautiful twins.\n\nHow do you think couples these days are different from your generation?Â\n\nFarheen: The one major difference between us and couples today is social media. We didnâ€™t have to worry about hashtags and likes.\n\nAdnan: I find couples these days too impressionable and influenced by social media. Theyâ€™re caught up in how others are viewing them.\n\nWhich one piece of marriage advice would you give to new couples?\n\nFarheen: Respect each other. Love cannot thrive without it.\n\nAdnan: Itâ€™s a roller coaster ride. Scream, laugh, cry, but hold your hands throughout.\n\nCredits: Text: Sana Zehra – Photos Courtesy: Farheen & Adnan\n\nMeant To Be\n\nHow did you meet?\n\nSammia: Rifaat is my cousin. It was my motherâ€™s wish to get both of us married. I was too young back then to make a decision for myself but firmly believed my parents knew best. He would often write letters to me, which made me realise he would take care of me.\n\nDr. Rifaat: Weâ€™re cousins so we always knew each other but I developed a fondness for her when I visited her family in London in 1981.\n\nThe day you got married, do you think you fully comprehended what a lifetime together would look like? What were your expectations from marriage?\n\nSammia: I didnâ€™t have many expectations from marriage. My only wish was for him to make a loving husband, which he did. I got a life partner far better than I could have imagined.\n\nDr. Rifaat: I had a very clear idea of marriage and was ready to take on my responsibilities as a husband. I was confident that Sammia would make a great life partner and in retrospect, that turned out to be true. I had no set expectations but knew I had made a good choice for myself.\n\nWhat is the most challenging part about marriage?\n\nSammia: To raise good children by imparting wisdom and inculcating values in them. Itâ€™s a lot of hard work.\n\nDr. Rifaat: To reconcile differences and develop a common understanding.\n\nAnd the most rewarding?\n\nSammia: Receiving love and appreciation from my husband and children.\n\nDr. Rifaat: Our children.\n\nWhat is the most romantic thing your partner has done for you?\n\nSammia: Rifaat has done so many things for me over the course of our marriage. Not every woman is blessed with such a great husband.\n\nDr. Rifaat: Standing by me and having faith in our relationship during tough times.\n\nWhat are some of the milestones with your partner that you remember most fondly?\n\nSammia: Having children and raising them together.\n\nDr. Rifaat: Travelling together to the United States, having two of our children in Fairfax, Virginia and celebrating our 25th anniversary.\n\nWhat gets you through the tough times?\n\nSammia: Whenever my extended family mocked or criticized me unnecessarily, my religion and connection with God helped me stay strong. My children too, have played a key role in getting me through tough moments.\n\nDr. Rifaat: Belief in each otherâ€™s love and unshakable faith that good times are around the corner.\n\nThe one thing you love and one thing you hate most about your partner?\n\nSammia: I love that he trusts me blindly. I hate how sometimes he makes hasty decisions that he regrets later.\n\nDr. Rifaat: I love her sincerity and openness. What I find disagreeable is her tendency to see the world in black and white.\n\nWhat do you think has been the secret to your successful marriage?\n\nSammia: For me, it has been listening to and learning from my husband.\n\nDr. Rifaat: Loving and understanding each other.\n\nHow do you think couples these days are different from your generation?\n\nSammia: In todayâ€™s generation, the biggest problem is that if one partner is more accomplished or enlightened than the other, it becomes a matter of ego. No one wants to learn from one another. In the world of social media, there is a severe lack of tolerance.\n\nDr. Rifaat: Most young couples today have a flawed view of marriage and fail to recognise this institution as sacred.\n\nWhich one piece of marriage advice would you give to new couples?\n\nSammia: Practice patience and love selflessly. Also never let go of the following things:\n\nYour parentsâ€™ values\n\nFaith\n\nCompassion\n\nDr. Rifaat: Donâ€™t stay in an unhappy marriage.\n\nText: Â Haider Rifaat – Photos Courtesy: Â Sammia & Dr. Rifaat\n\nAn AdventureÂ Of A Lifetime\n\nHow did you meet?\n\nBoth: We met at the gym.\n\nThe day you got married, do you think you fully comprehended what a lifetime together would look like? What were your expectations from marriage?\n\nSana: Fakhar swept me off my feet at a point in my life when I wasnâ€™t expecting to meet anyone as loving and understanding as him. I have to admit though, I had my fears. Marriage is a huge decision regardless of how much you admire your partner.\n\nMy only expectation from this new commitment was for my husband and his family to accept me for who I am and consider me a part of their family with sincerity. God has been very kind. Iâ€™ve received more love and respect than I had hoped for.\n\nFakhar: I wanted Sana and my family to get along and love each other. Thankfully, their relationship is exemplary.\n\nThe one thing you love and one thing you hate most about your partner?\n\nSana: Fakhar is my soulmate. I hold in high esteem his honesty and passion for the things he loves. I canâ€™t think of anything I hate about him.\n\nFakhar: Her ability to love unconditionally is admirable. What I think she could work on, is her stubbornness and occasional bouts of frenzy.\n\nWhatâ€™s the most challenging part about marriage?\n\nSana: Marriage is constant work. Adjusting into a new family, in particular, can be quite a challenge but I think Iâ€™m one of the few lucky ones who were spared the ordeal.\n\nFakhar: The initial years of familiarising yourself with your partnerâ€™s likes, dislikes and quirks can be challenging. If you love each other though, itâ€™s all worth it.\n\nAnd the most rewarding?\n\nSana: For me, itâ€™s the warmth with which I was welcomed into Fakharâ€™s family, our two boys and the sheer joy of having him as my husband.\n\nFakhar: Waking up next to her every morning.\n\nWhatâ€™s the most romantic thing your partner has done for you?\n\nSana: The day Fakhar proposed to me was absolutely beautiful! He decorated my sisterâ€™s house with over five hundred heart-shaped flower bouquets and got down on his knee. While I found it childish and got upset initially, I called him soon after and said yes.\n\nFakhar: There are countless things I could list here but if I had to pick one, it would be the fabulous surprise birthday she hosted for me recently.\n\nWhat are some of the milestones with your partner that you remember most fondly?\n\nSana: We are both sporty and like to put our physical strength to test. Weâ€™ve been on adventures most people wouldnâ€™t believe. I feel pushing our limits together helps us grow as partners, while creating memories weâ€™ll cherish forever.\n\nFakhar: There are way too many.\n\nWhat gets you through the tough times?\n\nSana: Fakharâ€™s love and support. When I delivered my first born, for example, I gained a lot of weight. As expected, people were very cruel and unforgiving, but my husband didnâ€™t let me get demotivated.Â He devised a fitness plan for me and made sure I followed it religiously. I was back in shape in no time.\n\nFakhar: Communication and understanding each otherâ€™s emotions.\n\nWhat do you think has been the secret to your successful marriage?\n\nSana: Being friends, honouring commitment and compromise.\n\nFakhar: We are really good friends and try to be understanding of each otherâ€™s emotional needs, in good times and bad.\n\nHow do you think couples these days are different from your generation?\n\nSana: I think couples these days are smarter. They invest time in getting to know each other and nurturing a friendship before taking the plunge, which is great.\n\nFakhar: Due to more exposure through the media and travelling, young couples today have a better understanding of human emotion and mental wellbeing. This definitely helps them make better decisions.\n\nWhich one piece of marriage advice would you give to new couples?\n\nSana: Donâ€™t give in to the typical dynamic of marriage portrayed by our culture. Itâ€™s important to understand that marriage looks different for everyone.\n\nFakhar: Be more understanding of each other.\n\nText: Sana Zehra – Photos Courtesy: Sana and Fakhar\n\nCollege Sweethearts\n\nHow did you meet?Â\n\nShazia: Our families are friends, so the first time we were introduced was by our mothers at an event. We became friends during our undergraduate degree though, when we coincidentally ended up at the same university.\n\nWajahat: The first time I met Shazia was at a family affair. The second time was in college.\n\nThe day you got married, do you think you fully comprehended what a lifetime together would look like? What were your expectations from marriage?Â\n\nShazia: The day we got married, all that mattered to me was knowing Wajahat was the only person Iâ€™d like to share my life with. I entered the relationship with an open mind and heart, ready for any ups and downs we may experience.\n\nWajahat: Yes. I was fully prepared to spend my life with Shazia, way before our wedding was finalised. At the risk of sounding cheesy, I think it comes naturally once youâ€™re sure youâ€™ve met â€œthe one.â€\n\nWhatâ€™s the most challenging part about marriage?\n\nShazia: Every day presents new challenges but overcoming them is extremely gratifying.\n\nWajahat: Transitioning from being single and carefree to sharing everything with another person takes effort. You need to give yourself and your partner time to get used to each otherâ€™s personalities.\n\nAnd the most rewarding?Â\n\nShazia: Sharing the rest of your life with the one you love.\n\nWajahat: Having a best friend for life.\n\nWhatâ€™s the most romantic thing your partner has done for you?\n\nShazia: Wajahat is a very romantic person. He loves surprising me with thoughtful gestures, but the one I cherish the most is planning a second honeymoon to Switzerland for our 20th Wedding Anniversary.\n\nWajahat: Shazia is an expert at arranging surprise parties. I think over the course of our marriage sheâ€™s thrown me at least twenty-fiveâ€”on three different continents.\n\nWhat are some of the milestones with your partner that you remember most fondly?Â\n\nShazia: The birth of our boys tops the list for me, followed by performing Hajj together last year.\n\nWajahat: There are so many. From graduating together, to the birth of our children, travelling the world and making filmsâ€”every day has been special. Weâ€™ve survived twenty years without a single serious fight.\n\nWhat gets you through the tough times?\n\nShazia: Remembering the good times.\n\nWajahat: Advice from our parents, along with our own contrasting skill sets to deal with conflicts. Iâ€™m an idealist and very sensitive, while sheâ€™s practical and realistic; we find the perfect balance.\n\nThe one thing you love and one thing you hate most about your partner?Â\n\nShazia: Heâ€™s an exceptionally loving husband and father, but I would appreciate if he stopped triggering my OCD.\n\nWajahat: I love that sheâ€™s a very intelligent and caring woman. I dislike her obsession with keeping things in perfect order all the time.\n\nWhat do you think has been the secret to your successful marriage?Â\n\nShazia: Being patient, giving each other space and appreciating each other.\n\nWajahat: Despite the fact that youâ€™ll never find either of us socializing without one another, we understood the importance of giving each other space very early in our marriage. I think that played a huge role in the success of our relationship.\n\nHow do you think couples these days are different from your generation?\n\nShazia: I find couples these days to be very impatient and insecure, which can be disastrous for marriage.\n\nWajahat: It takes a lot of patience to make marriage work, but I see the willingness to put in effort decrease with each generation. Couples these days arenâ€™t as selfless as us, just like weâ€™re no match for couples from our parentsâ€™ generation.\n\nWhich one piece of marriage advice would you give to new couples?\n\nShazia: Have patience and trust your partner.\n\nWajahat: Always count your blessings when going through a rough patch.\n\nCredits: Text: Sana Zehra – Photos Courtesy: Shazia & Wajahat\n\nFinding The Right Balance\n\nHow did you meet?Â\n\nSaima: We were introduced by my cousin and friend, Bobby.\n\nQurram: Turns out, Bobby has introduced other people who ended up getting married as well. He clearly has a knack for matchmaking.\n\nThe day you got married, do you think you fully comprehended what a lifetime together would look like? What were your expectations from marriage?Â\n\nSaima: All we cared about was wanting to be together. In the words of Rumi â€œlovers donâ€™t finally meet somewhere, they are in each other all along.â€\n\nQurram: At that point I was just happy to have found someone who understood me. I most certainly wasnâ€™t aware of the inevitable ups and downs couples go through.\n\nWhatâ€™s the most challenging part about marriage?Â\n\nSaima: With Qâ€™s hectic schedule, we have to stay apart very often. I find that hard at times, but we make it work regardless. The kids and I are his biggest fans and love seeing him perform on stage.\n\nQurram: Balancing Saimaâ€™s professional commitments and my travels is tough. However, we try finding the right balance.\n\nAnd the most rewarding?Â\n\nSaima: The feeling of overwhelming peace when we are together.\n\nQurram: Knowing I have a rock by my side. We also really enjoy our kidsâ€”they can be a handful, but add a lot of color to our lives.\n\nWhatâ€™s the most romantic thing your partner has done for you?\n\nSaima: On one of my birthdays, Qurram got customised t-shirts made for himself and our son Keyaan. The one he wore said â€œI loveÂ Saima,â€ while the one Keyaan wore said â€œIÂ loveÂ Saimama.â€ I found it very endearing.\n\nQurram: Saima is indomitable when it comes to thoughtful gestures and I struggle to keep up with her. We happened to be travelling once on my birthday and when we landed in Dubai on transit, she made sure the staff in the lounge had a cake arranged, and joined her to sing Happy Birthday.\n\nWhat are some of the milestones with your partner that you remember most fondly?Â\n\nSaima: We both love travelling and have experienced much of the world together. We have had the opportunity to see some amazing places.\n\nQurram: We always experience new milestones while traveling. We prefer taking the kids along, which means there are many variables but we embrace them all. It gives us so much to remember and cherish.\n\nWhat gets you through the tough times?Â\n\nSaima: Knowing that no matter what, he is my soulmate.\n\nQurram: The fact that despite being different individuals, our core values are the same.\n\nThe one thing you love and one thing you hate most about your partner?Â\n\nSaima: Q is the kindest, most gentle man I have ever met but I hate that he loses his phone all the time!\n\nQurram: I love her spontaneity; sheâ€™s always ready for the next big adventure. On the flipside, sheâ€™s a clean freak, which means the spring-cleaning never ends.\n\nWhat do you think has been the secret to your successful marriage?Â\n\nSaima:Â Accepting, loving, nurturing and supporting one another to manifest our visions and dreams.\n\nQurram: Mutual respect and being supportive of each otherâ€™s goals. Saima is a pillar for our family when I have to travel for work. Similarly, I have been happy to move cities for her so she could meet her professional commitments.\n\nHow do you think couples these days are different from your generation?Â\n\nSaima: The new generation of couples lives in an Instagram world where they expect instant gratification.Â Thatâ€™s not how relationships work though. You need to work on yours every day.\n\nQurram: Every generation is unique, so itâ€™s inevitable for new age couples to be different from us. What I donâ€™t understand though, is the unnecessary grandeur of weddings these days. Agreed, itâ€™s a celebration but does it really require ten opulent functions?\n\nWhich one piece of marriage advice would you give to new couples?\n\nSaima: Never try to change one another. Love your partner for who they are. Be a source of peace and positivity in each otherâ€™s lives and you are bound to rise together.\n\nQurram: Rushing into marriage is unwise. Itâ€™s crucial to grow as an individual first and be sure of who you are and what you want from life. Only a strong foundation of self will make for a lasting union.\n\nCredits: Text: Sana Zehra – Photos Courtesy: Saima & Qurram\n\nDynamic performers and quirky style stars, Iqra Aziz and Yasir Hussain are two of the most coveted actors of their generation\n\nEver since she made her debut with Kissey Apna Kahein in 2014, Iqra has continued to prove herself as a bankable actress with character-substantive roles. While this 21-year old starlet may appear petite and diminutive in person, her exceptional acting skills and uncontainable energy are her true strengths.\n\nYasir, the people’s artist, is an absolute livewire who wears multiple hats as an actor, talk show host and VJ. His ever-growing fan following can be credited to the ease with which he steps into each of his characters. From the depraved villain, to the unabashed romantic and the riotous comedian, he does it all with equal flair. With a lot being speculated about their work and personal lives, Sana Zehra sat these A-listers down for a casual chat.\n\nIQRA AZIZ\n\nWe love your spunky sense of style. How do you plan your looks?\n\nMy looks are never planned, in fact itâ€™s almost always a last minute decision for me. Iâ€™m always struggling to put together a good outfit, with an appropriate hairstyle, makeup and accessories. Things are pretty disorganised for me in the fashion department, but thankfully, I always manage to wing it.\n\nWhat are some of the biggest fashion faux pas youâ€™ve made in the past?\n\nThere have been quite a few to be honest. The one that Iâ€™ve repeated the most though is wearing ill-fitted clothes. They were always too oversized! I also faced a lot of criticism for a black, voluminous dress I wore to the second Hum Awards. I had never worn something like that before, so was pretty excited but faced a lot of backlash for my decision. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion though, so I didnâ€™t take it to heart.\n\nWhatâ€™s the secret to your success?\n\nHard work and dedication. The passion I have for my work drives me to deliver the best I can, while my upbringing keeps me grounded enough to understand the responsibilities that come with fame. This is why I try to choose projects that have a strong message. To me, my professional standing is all due to the respect God blessed me with and I never want to take that for granted.\n\nWhatâ€™s the most absurd rumour youâ€™ve heard about yourself?\n\nThat Iâ€™m engaged to be married to Affan Waheed! We were photographed while on set for a drama serial and when our co-star jokingly posted that image on her Instagram, everyone assumed we were a couple. Things really got blown out of proportion.\n\nAs a child, did you ever see yourself becoming an actor?\n\nNot really. When I was younger the only two things I could picture myself doing in the future were either fashion design or banking. However, as soon as opportunities for acting arose, I was certain this was my true calling in life. Iâ€™m still pretty young though, so have time to explore different avenues. You never know what the future holds!\n\nWhich contemporaries of yours do you look up to?\n\nIâ€™m very fortunate to be surrounded by visionaries who are ambitious, encouraging and straightforward. Two people who top the list for me are my close friends, Hina Altaf and Yasir Hussain. Their drive and honesty inspires me every day. Both of them have stood by me as my pillars of support through all my struggles. Itâ€™s easy to connect with them because we all share the same belief system and path in life.\n\nWould you ever accept a role in Bollywood? If yes, who would you like to work with?\n\nIf the script is good, then yes, definitely. I would love to work with Ranveer Singh.\n\nYou have a really fun Instagram with an ever growing following. How conscious are you about posting content responsibly?\n\nIâ€™m pretty conscious of the responsibility and have often wanted to address important issues. I do, however, think people need to be kinder and open to difference of opinion. Itâ€™s easy to sit behind a screen and ridicule others, but thatâ€™s not how constructive dialogue can ever develop.\n\nTell us about life at home.\n\nMy life at home is all about treasuring every moment spent with my mother and sister. Iâ€™ve grown up seeing these amazing, resilient women fight all odds to live a fulfilling life. They are the reason I am a strong individual who believes in dreaming big.\n\nâ€œNEPOTISM IS EVERYWHERE. NOT ONLY IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY, BUT EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY AS WELL. AM I BOTHERED BY IT? NOT AT ALLâ€ â€”YASIR\n\nHow has stardom impacted your life?\n\nI started acting at an extremely young age, so itâ€™s hard to tell if the changes in my personality are due to stardom or just a natural result of growing up. Everyone evolves with age and so have I, but the fact that I struggled so much during these years may have made me more reserved than I would have been otherwise.\n\nSHORT & SWEET\n\nWhatâ€™s one thing youâ€™ve done that most people wouldnâ€™t believe?\n\nI recently tried camping for the first time and hardly anyone would believe I actually enjoyed it.\n\nWhich one trait do you admire most in people?\n\nA good sense of humour\n\nLeast favourite thing to eat?\n\nPrawns and lobsterâ€”Iâ€™ve started to hate seafood.\n\nThe one role thatâ€™s closest to your heart?\n\nTabeer. I found it very challenging to portray her, butÂ believe doing so changed me as a person.\n\nLast time you were in love?\n\nWell, Iâ€™m in love right now\n\nDo you follow a beauty regimen?\n\nI wish I could say yes, but unfortunately, I donâ€™t. The last thing I remember doing to take care of my skin was apply a black charcoal mask and itÂ felt like I achieved the biggest feat possible.\n\nIf you had to choose, would you rather giveÂ up using social media or watching films/television?\n\nSocial media\n\nWhere do you see yourself 20 years from now?\n\nItâ€™s hard for me to predict what Iâ€™d be doing five yearsÂ from now, planning 20 years ahead is justÂ unthinkable!\n\nThereâ€™s lots being said about your relationshipÂ with Yasir. How come you havenâ€™t made any statement to clear the air? Iâ€™m still going to refrain from saying anything.\n\nYasir Hussain\n\nThe characters you choose are always beautifully complex. How do you manage to portray them so effortlessly?\n\nI find it very boring to play onedimensional characters, so always add in something to make them more relatable and distinct. For example, in Lahore Se Aagey, my character, Moti, had a speech problem.\n\nDo you think nepotism exists within our entertainment industry? If yes, does it bother you?\n\nNepotism is everywhere. Not only in the entertainment industry, butÂ every other industry as well. Am I bothered by it? Not at all. Personally, I donâ€™tÂ find any harm in it. An actorâ€™s son will be an actor if he wants to and thereÂ is nothing wrong with that. At the end of the day, only hard work and talentÂ lead you to success.\n\nâ€œTHE PASSION I HAVE FOR MY WORK DRIVES ME TO DELIVER THE BEST I CAN, WHILE MY UPBRINGING KEEPS ME GROUNDED ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT COME WITH FAMEâ€ â€”IQRA\n\nHow does acting come so naturally to you? What is the process of delving into character like?\n\nTo be honest, Iâ€™m not sure. It just happens. I read the script, go over my lines and immediately understand the character. Method acting has never been my forte and I confess, I donâ€™t spend time researching much either. The most Iâ€™ve ever done is to go meet someone I was portraying.\n\nWhat are you most excited about in 2019?\n\nIâ€™m really looking forward to Anwar Maqsoodâ€™s play Naach Na Janey and my movie Anghan Terha.\n\nSHORT & SWEET\n\nWhatâ€™s an â€œold person thingâ€ you do?\n\nValue time\n\nWhatâ€™s the most important thing to rememberÂ when going out on a date?\n\nThere are three things actually: You must always carry cash, just in case your card doesnâ€™t work. You must have sufficient petrol in your car. You must make sure you go to a place your ex doesnâ€™t know about.\n\nLast person you yelled at?\n\nWell, technically heâ€™s not a person, but the only one IÂ can think of is my puppy, Mogambo. Why? He bit my housekeeper, Nadeem.\n\nWorst thing you ate out of politeness?\n\nI was invited to the Sri Lankan Ambassadorâ€™s residence,Â along with a couple of friends and theyÂ served us undercooked eggs with papadum. It wasÂ awful!\n\nâ€œEVERYONE EVOLVES WITH AGE AND SO HAVE I, BUT THE FACT THAT I STRUGGLED SO MUCH DURING THESE YEARS MAY HAVE MADE ME MORE RESERVED THAN I WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISEâ€ â€” IQRA\n\nWhatâ€™s one thing about you that all yourÂ friends would vouch for?\n\nThat I always speak the truth\n\nWhich Pakistani actor do you think shouldÂ portray you in your biopic?\n\nAsad Siddiqui\n\nIf you werenâ€™t an artist, what would you beÂ doing?\n\nI would have been a doctor\n\nIf you could switch wardrobes with aÂ fictional character, who would you pick?\n\nMogambo, played by the late Amrish Puri in Mr. India\n\nA project youâ€™d like to star in oppositeÂ Iqra?\n\nLaila Majnu\n\nHow sweet! Time to address the elephant inÂ the room: are you and Iqra dating?\n\nIâ€™ll let you and your readers keep guessing!\n\nRani, Bubbly, Nigaar… the recent roles youâ€™ve portrayed have been of multi-layered strong women. Is this a conscious decision?\n\nYes. The status quo for a lead heroine is to play the docile girl in need of a man to save her and I have to admit Iâ€™ve accepted such roles many times. However, I now feel like Iâ€™ve paid my dues and can choose the characters I want to portray. With AAAI (Alif, Allah aur Insaan) I also think I set a precedent for myself. My audience wants to see me portray real women. Women are complex creatures with many layers. To box them in as one- dimensional characters is unfair to our gender. Iâ€™m glad the screen is changing and Iâ€™m humbled to be chosen to play such characters.\n\nWith the conversation on gender equality and feminism on the rise, how important is it for female actors to choose their roles carefully and avoid playing the damsel in distress?\n\nWe canâ€™t completely avoid playing the damsel in distress because she is the quintessential fantasy heroine. Itâ€™s a treat for audiences to see their favourite faces play the fairytale princess theyâ€™ve grown up admiring. I think it is okay to indulge in that fantasy every now and then but the over-all ideology must change. We must never glorify abuse, which is what we did in my drama serial Bashar Momin. As much as I love that project of mine, I do feel guilty sometimes because thatâ€™s not the message I want to give young women. In Lashkara, my character is that of a beautiful daydreamer who is very much in love with her prince but when tragedy hits, itâ€™s her own strength that perseveres, not that of a man. Drama serials, such as Lashkara, have been my way of rectifying the messages my submissive roles have sent.\n\nAs actors we have a lot of power over the message we send out and in todayâ€™s age, women have a responsibility to further the feminist movement. Female actors are certainly not exempt from that. Itâ€™s not my job to tell other actors which roles to select but, as I grow older, this responsibility becomes clearer to me.\n\nâ€œEVERY NOW AND THEN, ANOTHER ACTRESS IS\n\nFAVOURED FOR A ROLE MEANT FOR YOU BECAUSE\n\nSHE IS WILLING TO GIVE IN TO A MISOGYNIST\n\nPRODUCER/DIRECTOR’S WHIMS”\n\nHow hard is it to detach yourself from the intense and complex characters you play? Does some part of them stay with you?\n\nWhen on set, the traits of my on-screen characters definitely seep into my own personality. I became versions of myself I didnâ€™t recognize during Rukhsaar and Piya Mann Bhaye. I found myself behaving very timidly during Bheegi Palkein, Shehre-Yaraan and Bashar Momin. Alif Allah took me through many emotional stages off and on camera, which certainly helped the evolution of Rani to Reena Begum but made me behave almost bi-polar. Lashkara was dark and I often found myself depressed and with Nigaar in Balaa, I would be very difficult sometimes (quickly realized my fault and apologized though).\n\nHence, you could say Iâ€™m definitely somewhat an unintentional method actor during shoot. Once camera packs, a quick getaway vacation is mandatory to get the character out of my system and become Ushna again.\n\nOut of all the characters youâ€™ve portrayed, which one do you relate to most and why?\n\nMy characters are an extension of myself and my experiences, so in a way theyâ€™re always a part of me. However, there isnâ€™t any one character thatâ€™s completely like me. Iâ€™d feel too exposed to play something like that. Thereâ€™s security and protection in playing something thatâ€™s not you. You can then bring yourself in that character without feeling vulnerable. Thatâ€™s the beauty of expression through acting.\n\nâ€œIT IS NOTÂ MY JOB TOÂ TELL OTHER ACTORSÂ WHICH ROLES TO\n\nSELECT BUTÂ AS I GROWÂ OLDER, THISÂ RESPONSIBILITY\n\nBECOMES CLEARERÂ TO MEâ€\n\nThe fame and influence celebrities enjoy, puts immense responsibility on them to use it wisely. Do you ever feel burdened by the constant spotlight?\n\nI always feel a responsibility to speak up for what I believe in and that almost always gets me in trouble. The platform celebrities have for their voice is a huge responsibility and it would be ungrateful not to use it. The spotlight is rather overwhelming, which is why Iâ€™ve backed away from a lot of the PR related social media posts and focused on acting and performance centric roles.\n\nApart from your strong screen presence, youâ€™re also known for being very outspoken on social media. When a public figure sparks debate, backlash is inevitable. How do you deal with the difference of opinion and hostile voices in particular?\n\nIâ€™ve developed a fairly thick skin so I do what my contemporaries do, which is to ignore. Hostile voices are usually anonymous ones belonging to keyboard warriors who are extremely unsatisfied with their lives and feel the need to attack famous people for their own gratification; those voices arenâ€™t worth responding to. Every now and then, however, Iâ€™ll respond, but thatâ€™s usually due to boredom or maybe a bad mood.\n\nâ€œWOMEN ARE COMPLEX CREATURESÂ WITH MANY LAYERS. TO BOX THEM IN AS ONE-DIMENSIONAL CHARACTERS IS UNFAIR TO OUR GENDERâ€\n\nAs a woman, have you experienced any inherent prejudices in your line of work?\n\nAbsolutely! Ageism for one. The blatant sexism and objectification we are subjected to are a close second. Every now and then, another actress is favoured for a role meant for you because she is willing to give in to a misogynist producer/directorâ€™s whims.\n\nWhen a male actor/ producer/director is firm, it is because he is professional and he is the boss, but when a woman behaves in a similarÂ way, she is called an entitled diva.Â Women are expected to always have a smile on their faces and not show any signs of authority.\n\nIâ€™m glad to see this trend finally change but Iâ€™ve gone through a lot because of it in the past. It bothers me greatly.\n\nAs the ambassador of Toddâ€™s Welfare Society (TWS), animal well-being and safety is a cause close to your heart. How do you wish to contribute to this objective?\n\nâ€œHOSTILE VOICES ARE USUALLYÂ ANONYMOUS ONES BELONGING TO KEYBOARD WARRIORS WHO AREÂ EXTREMELY UNSATISFIED WITH THEIRÂ LIVES AND FEEL THE NEED TO ATTACK FAMOUS PEOPLE FOR THEIR OWNÂ GRATIFICATIONâ€\n\nI do my best to raise my voice wherever I can. I believe there needs to be a movement in Pakistan in favour of animals, both domestic and wild.\n\nFirstly, strict laws need to be passed and implemented against animal abuse. The hunting of wild animals, especially endangered bucks and snow leopards in the north, should be strictly banned. For domestic animals, there ought to be licenses and health checks to ensure theyâ€™re not overworked and are well fed. ACF (Ayesha Chundrigar Foundation) has come out with â€œhumane harnessesâ€ for donkeys, which I think should be mandatory for anyone using these animals for transport.\n\nCulling of any kind should be strictly banned and instead a spaying and neutering campaign should be made to control the stray population in Pakistan. Animals meant for slaughter (such as chickens) should be kept in healthy environments.\n\nMost importantly, the public should be educated on the importance of treating animals with compassion. To this end, public service ads should be issued and school curriculums should include courses on the importance of empathy towards animals.\n\nWe have a long way to go.\n\nWhat is Ushna Shah like at home? Tell us about your childhood and family?\n\nI grew up as the youngest of six children. My elder siblings and I have a huge age gap so it was more like having five extra parents instead of brothers and sisters. I guess in that way I was a bit spoiled but also very disciplined. My family is full of artists and performers and I am essentially an extension of them.\n\nTheater, film or TV?\n\nTheater\n\nWhat irks you most about social media?\n\nPeople getting insecure by the fake lives created by others.\n\nBiggest pet peeve?\n\nSlow drivers/walkers/ATM users, etc.\n\nÂ Your biggest strength?\n\nMy uncompromisable integrity\n\nÂ And biggest weakness?\n\nFries\n\nÂ Favourite â€˜90s jam?\n\nEverybody by Backstreet Boys What was the last photo you took?\n\nA selfie with my niece\n\nÂ Your personal style in three\n\nwords?\n\nComfort Costume Swag\n\nÂ Last impulsive buy?\n\nA plane ticket\n\nÂ Most prized possession?\n\nPossessions shouldnâ€™t be prized, people should be.\n\nÂ What was the last lie you told?\n\nâ€œIâ€™ll definitely try to make it!â€\n\nÂ One habit you have that annoys your family?\n\nTaking ages in the shower (I just asked my sister).\n\nÂ Do you have a nickname?\n\nSeveral: Ush, Ushi, Ushners, Uch, Uchi, Tush, Ushi-Baby and many other variations of Ushna.

In a world full of people with so many faces, sheâ€™s really herself. Sometimes she gets in-your-face and people may not like that about her, but I love it.\n\nIn what way has life changed ever since marriage?\n\nTo be honest my life has changed entirely. Iâ€™m more focused, organized and disciplined. Great things have happened to me since we got married.\n\nHow do you define your relationship?\n\nFriendship. To be together as a couple and to have to work it out, you are first and foremost friends. You are honest with each other, look out for each other and protect each other. Thatâ€™s what friends do.\n\nHow has your relationship evolved over time?\n\nWe became the best of friends over time â€“ luckily for us. And that is the key to a successful relationship. We canâ€™t get enough of each other. We spend so much time together, watching movies, laughing at the same jokes, etc.\n\nWhat are the keys to a successful relationship?\n\nLike I said, firstly, be friends. Guide each other, understand each other, and love each other. If thereâ€™s something not right with your partner, call it out. Communicate. Talk.\n\nWho is the typical life partner from both of you?\n\nNeither. We are both far from being â€œtypicalâ€ and I think weâ€™re both unpredictable at times. Itâ€™s what makes us interesting to each other.\n\nWho is more romantic or more expressive with feelings?\n\nI like to think Iâ€™m the more romantic one. I donâ€™t know what Urwa would have to say about that.\n\nIn what ways do you think you complement each other?\n\nShe complements me in each and every way. She gives me strength when I need it. Similarly, I complement her. Different people have different strengths and weaknesses. When two people come together, theyâ€™re supposed to complete each other.\n\nHow do you deal with rumours about each other?\n\nThankfully, we donâ€™t have that problem. If we hear things, we laugh it off together. Urwa and I are way too connected to each other for there to be room for any rumours. Touch wood!\n\nYou have worked in Udari. How does working together bring out the best in each of you?\n\nUdari was a great project to do together. Naturally, the chemistry between us in such projects is phenomenal. It wasnâ€™t even acting. It was just the vibe between us. People were really rooting for us from that point on.\n\nAre there any projects you are both working on currently or are such projects in the works?\n\nYes, there are a number of projects for which weâ€™re both reading scripts, and if we find something interesting our fans will be the first to know.\n\nHow do you both spend your weekends?\n\nWeekends are mostly spent watching Netflix. We love to watch movies together. I think itâ€™s a healthy exercise. It helps build a common intellect or sense of humour. If not, find some other common ground.\n\nHow do you describe each otherâ€™s style?\n\nWe both try to keep it natural and whatever we are comfortable with. We donâ€™t believe in having to go out of our skins to experiment. People should stick to what they feel comes naturally to them.\n\nHow has your style evolved since being together?\n\nWe take advice from each other and listen to the input each of us has to give. Honest advice really goes a long way.\n\nDo you travel together? Where did you go for your honeymoon and how did it help you understand each other?\n\nWe went to Mauritius for our honeymoon. We love to travel together, for gigs, shoots, etc. Weâ€™ve been all over Europe together. Traveling together is a beautiful experience. They say there is no better way to get to know someone than to travel with them. So couples should definitely travel together as much as they can.\n\nWhat is on your goal board for 2019, work wise and family wise?\n\nWe obviously want to do great things together. We share our goals and we want to achieve big things for ourselves and for our country. And family wise, we intend on staying just as we are right now, touch wood.\n\nUrwa\n\nWhat piece of entertainment do you wish you could erase from your mind so that you could experience it for the first time again with Farhan?\n\nI would never want to remove anything that I have experienced. I still enjoy some of my favourite films like I am watching them for the first time.\n\nIf all jobs had the same pay and hours, what job would you like to have?\n\nIâ€™d still be an actor. I truly enjoy my work.\n\nHow different was your life one year ago?\n\nLife is different every day. It will be very difficult to put that in words but I can definitely say itâ€™s different in a good way today.\n\nWhat quirks do you have?\n\nDefining my cup of tea\n\nâ€œThe first thing i noticedâ€¦is the humility in his body language Eventhough all the girls were drooling over him at the gt where we metâ€\n\nBest way to start the day?\n\nStretching and yoga is the best way to start the day.\n\nWhat fad or trend do you hope comes back?\n\nBell bottoms\n\nWhich city would you most like to live in?\n\nKarachi\n\nWhich movie title best describes your life?\n\nItâ€™s a wonderful life\n\nâ€œOur fans love our chemistryâ€\n\nWhy did you decide to do the work you are doing now?\n\nI never really decided to be an actor. I think the field chose me, and opportunities kept unfolding.\n\nWhatâ€™s the best way a person can spend their time?\n\nBy reading\n\nWhich website do you visit most often?\n\nIntegra\n\nWhat one thing do you really want but canâ€™t afford it?\n\nA trip to the moon. Ha-ha!\n\nWhere do you usually go when you when you have time off?\n\nI like spending time at home when I have time off. Thatâ€™s the best way for me to unwind.\n\nWhere would you spend all your time if you could?\n\nWith my mother because she lives in Sydney. I miss her so much.\n\nWhat is special about the place you grew up in?\n\nIslamabad was the most beautiful place to spend my childhood. I think I will always remember it as a peaceful and clean city. I loved the abundance of nature there.\n\nWhat age do you want to live to?\n\nFor as long as I am healthy, whatever age that might be.\n\nWhen was the last time you changed your opinion/belief about something major?\n\nI think I do that very often whenever I become convinced about something.\n\nWhat was the best compliment youâ€™ve received?\n\nThat I am a â€œpeople builderâ€Â and I am always there for everyone. Mawra calls me that.\n\nIf you were the only human left on Earth, what would you do?\n\nThatâ€™s a very scary thought.\n\nWhat is something you will NEVER do again?\n\nI wish to never hurt or upset anyone again intentionally or unintentionally.\n\nWhat do you spend the most time thinking about?\n\nMy loved ones; my family\n\nWhat are some of the events in your life that made you who you are?\n\nI think every experience has played a role so far.\n\nWhat are three of the most significant numbers in your life?\n\nI donâ€™t believe in numerology.\n\nWhat are three interesting facts about you?\n\nIâ€™m super organized.\n\nIâ€™m a morning person.\n\nI donâ€™t like shopping.\n\nIf you could make a 20 second phone call to yourself at any point in your life present or future, when would you call and what would you say?\n\nI would tell myself to just believe in myself and keep going further and further with what I love doing.\n\nUrwa, you got married at the peak of your career. Did it ever cross your mind that it could affect your professional growth as an actress?\n\nI think this only added to my professional growth. I believe if you have the right partner who celebrates your career then you only perform better and better.\n\nHow did you guys meet?\n\nThe first time we met was at a get-together at a mutual friendâ€™s place.\n\nWhat was the first thing that attracted you towards each other?\n\nThe first thing I noticed and the one thing I love most about him is the humility in his body language even though all the girls were drooling over him at the gt where we met.\n\nIn what ways has your life changed since marriage?\n\nLife has changed in a really good way.\n\nHow do you define your relationship?\n\nFriendship. I second Farhan on this one.\n\nHow has your relationship evolved with time?\n\nWe became the best of friends over time. Also, we embrace the changes in each other and try to learn about each other as we are growing. We support each otherâ€™s individual growth.\n\nWhat are the keys to a successful relationship?\n\nCommunication\n\nWho is more romantic or more expressive with feelings?\n\nI would say we both are our own kind of romantic. Canâ€™t really tell who is more romantic.\n\nIn what ways do you think you complement each other?\n\nHe makes me feel intelligent, witty and beautiful every day, more than I think I am.\n\nHow do you deal with rumours about each other?\n\nThey are hilarious sometimes. We laugh it off together.\n\nYou have worked in Udari. How does working together bring out the best in each of you?\n\nUdari was a great project to do together. I also really enjoyed working with him on two of his music videos Tu Thori Dayr and Saathiya. Our fans love our chemistry.\n\nAny projects you are both working on currently or are such projects in the works?\n\nYes, we are. We shall announce them soon.\n\nHow do you spend your weekends?\n\nWe love spending a slow relaxed day on our days off. We love watching movies. Dining out is Farhanâ€™s favourite, so we do that too sometimes.\n\nHow do you describe each otherâ€™s style?\n\nWe both have a minimal and comfortable style.\n\nHow has your style evolved since being together?\n\nLike Farhan said, honest advice really goes a long way. We turn to each other for guidance when needed.\n\nDo you travel together? Where did you go for your honeymoon and how has it helped you understand each other?\n\nWe went to Mauritius for our honeymoon. We love to travel together.\n\nPhotography by Adnan Qazi\n\nHair & make-up by Mehwish Almas\n\nAssisted by Nas Din\n\nÂ Interview by Ally Adnan\n\nKnown both for his immense talent and for his looks, Faisal Qureshi is one of Pakistan’s most well-known, versatile and popular actors. Faisal has maintained his status as an A-Lister amongst actors for almost a quarter of a century and appears all set for greater success, fame and renown in coming years. In an exclusive interview for GT, Faisal Qureshi talks to Ally Adnan about himself, his career as an actor and show business in Pakistan.\n\nYou have been in the field of acting for more than thirty years. How has the world of show business in Pakistan changed during this period?\n\nThe industry has undergone a tremendous change during this period. In the early years, there was very little competition. Pakistan Television Corporation was funded by the state and was the only network around. People in the industry, therefore, did not have to worry about the commerce of show business and were able to devote all of their energies to art. They could undertake daring projects without having to worry about their commercial viability. They also knew that viewers had no choices other than the ones that were broadcast on their network.\n\nThings have changed. The industry has grown tremendously since those times. We have had greater exposure. Much better equipment than was ever available to us is now at our disposal. And we have a lot of competition now. More than a hundred channels and production houses compete with each other in Pakistan today. Viewers have dozens of choices at any given moment. They are no longer bound to watching a single television channel. On the international level, Pakistani programs compete with those from the United Kingdom, India, Turkey, the United States and several other countries. As a result, producers, directors, writers and even actors have to pay attention to both the quality and the commercial viability of programs. Daring projects come with risks.\n\nHas the focus on the commercial aspects of show business taken away from the quality and content of programming?\n\nNo, fortunately, it has not. If I were to sum it up in one sentence, I would say that we used to focus almost exclusively on art in the past and now we focus on both art and commerce. There are those who will disagree with me but I firmly believe that our television plays are as good as, and occasionally better than, those that were produced in the first thirty years of Pakistani television. They can also hold their own against those produced in India, Turkey and several other countries. Our plays are enormously popular in India where we have channels dedicated exclusively to Pakistani serials. Bollywood films have never been as popular in Pakistan as our plays have been in India. We may be making money but are not doing so at the expense of art.\n\nI have always paid a lot of attention to people around me and studied their actions, emotions, speech and mannerisms\n\nTraditionally, a career in show business has not been considered respectable in Pakistan. Indeed, it used to be more of a hobby and not aserious vocation for a number of people in the field. Has that changed?\n\nThat was the case a long time ago. Things have changed greatly. We have a number of highly educated, extremely talented and highly experienced people in the industry, many of whom have studied film and television in some of the most prestigious international schools and universities. Scions of respectable and well-known families are actively involved in show business. It can no longer be a hobby. Acting is now a demanding, competitive and serious profession; 1) because, there is money in the field and, 2) because there is a lot of competition. Any actor who appears on television today competes with hundreds of others. Only the best can survive. In Pakistan, a career in show business is respectable, financially viable and rewarding in Pakistan today. The days when one could get into acting just because of good looks and social standing are mostly over. Today, it is necessary for people to have real talent and a serious desire to make acting their career in order to succeed in show business.\n\nThat probably makes it very difficult for newcomers to enter the industry.\n\nYes, very difficult. It is not easy to enter the field these days. It seems that everyone wants to get in. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people audition for acting roles on a daily basis in Pakistan. Patience, persistence and perseverance are needed to succeed in addition, of course, to talent and good looks. This is actually a good thing because the competitive atmosphere eliminates those who are not serious about show business and are trying acting just for fun.\n\nDoes the competitive environment, along with the allure of show business make newcomers susceptible to emotional, sexual and financial abuse?\n\nYes, it does. The problem has exacerbated in Pakistan during the last decade because there is more money and glamour in the field than there ever was in the past. A lot of people want to get in and at any cost.The problem, however, is not unique to Pakistan. It may be a little worse in our country but it exists all over the world.\n\nOther countries, however, have laws, acts and regulations to address issues of abuse. We do not. We also do not have unions to protect the interests of actors and prevent their exploitation. Do we not need an actors’ union in Pakistan?\n\nWe most certainly do and we are working on it. Atiqa Odho is leading the charge. Faysal Rehman, Sania Saeed, Nauman Ejaz and I, along with a few others, are involved. It may take a little while but we will eventually have an actors’ union in our country.\n\nGood looks have become a pre-requisite for becoming an actor. In the long run, though, much else is required\n\nAre Pakistani actors paid residuals and royalties for re-runs?Â\n\nNo. It is something that will happen eventually but I do not think that now is the time to address the issue. The business case for making residual payments is not solid at this point. It is easy to blame the channels for being greedy and not paying actors when programs are re-televised: that is unfair. The cost of producing good programs is very high in Pakistan and the returns are often rather slim. So, there is not enough money in the pot to pay residuals. Once we start exporting our programs on a large scale, the revenue of channels will increase and it will become both fair and necessary to set up a mechanism to pay actors residuals for re-runs. We are not at that stage today.\n\nYou said that talent and several other factors are necessary for success in show business. Good looks, however, seem to be necessary, and often sufficient for people to become actors in Pakistan. Why?\n\nThat is certainly the case. The primary demographic that television caters to in Pakistan likes good looking young men and women. The industry is bound to pay attention to the demographic. As a result, good looks have become a pre-requisite for becoming an actor. In the long run though, much else is needed. I do not think entering show business on the basis of good looks is a very serious problem. At the end of the day, we sell dreams to people. There is no real harm in making those dreams pretty and glamorous.\n\nDo you think that it is socially responsible to always show good looking people, wearing designer clothes, living in palatial homes and driving luxury cars, in our plays?\n\nIt is not if it is done excessively and exclusively.\n\nIn your case, was it looks or talent that helped you become a successful actor?\n\nI don’t think it was looks. I have worked very hard to bank on my histrionic talents during my career as an actor and on nothing else. I have played some decidedly unglamorous roles on television. There have been many roles – many, many roles – where my characters have been far from good-looking. I have often worked without make up to look the part. Actors are judged on the basis of talent and not on looks. I had made a conscious choice, a long time ago, to become a highly skilled and well respected actor. It has never been my desire to become a superstar. My desire is to have my name in the list of capable and competent Pakistani actors.\n\nWho do you think are Pakistan’s capable and competent actors?\n\nTalat Hussain, Muhammad Qavi, Firdaus Jamal and Abid Ali are certainly very capable and hugely talented. Ali Ejaz and Khayam Sarhadi are excellent. I don’t think any of them have ever worried about anything other than the demands of the characters they play. Appearance, clothes, homes and cars have only been used when there has been a need.\n\nDo you like any of the younger actors?\n\nYes, there are some who are good and quite a few who show promise. I think that Fahad Mustafa is a very good actor. He has immense talent and is likely to emerge as a major actor in television as well as film.\n\nHow did you learn to act?\n\nIt was by watching the performances of good actors. My mother is a well-known actor. I, therefore, had the opportunity of meeting and spending time with a lot of great actors and directors as a young man. I also spent a lot of time on sets as a child. I used to watch directors like Nusrat Thakur and Yawar Hayat direct actors. I paid attention to actors while they prepared for their roles, had discussion with directors and co-stars, and memorised their lines. Early on in my life, I realized that the power of observation was an essential trait in actors. I have always paid a lot of attention to people around me and studied their actions, emotions, speech and mannerisms. This has helped me a great deal as an actor.\n\nMy mother is a well- known actor. I had the opportunity of meeting and spending time with a lot of directors and actors as a young man\n\nThere was no formal education in acting?\n\nNot really but some of the senior actors coached me for long hours. Ali Ejaz helped me prepare for the role of Boota in Toba Tek Singh. We discussed my role with him at great length. There were scenes that he enacted for me to make sure that I knew how to deliver some key lines correctly. He was a great teacher as were many others. I think that my education in acting, albeit informal, was great.\n\nDid you also learn from any international actors?\n\nI respect a lot of international actors but have not learnt acting by observing any of them. It is not possible to learn from them. If we are depicting Pakistani society in our plays and films, then our references need to be Pakistani as well. Actors fail when they use foreign references while playing indigenous characters.\n\nThe world of show business is not known for its sense of morality as much as it is for beauty, glamour and splendor? Does this make life difficult for married actors?\n\nIt would seem that way but it does not. Today, acting is demanding, arduous and grueling. The atmosphere on the set is far from being conducive to romance. Actors are too busy memorising lines, getting make-up done, managing schedules, and understanding their roles to be le to think about romance. They also see each other without make-up and, trust me, a lot of us are not as attractive as we seem on-screen.\n\nAlly Adnan lives in Dallas andwrites about culture, history and the arts.\n\nHe tweets @allyadnan and can be reached at [email protected].\n\nPhotographs: Yaseen Lakhani\n\nSaba Ahmed talks to director Amin Iqbal\n\nQ) What memories do you have of your first directing experience?\n\nA) Terrible ones. It seemed as if I had taken on a whole lot of enemies in the industry. I started out my career as a screenwriter and that is what I had wanted to do at the time. I have even written 14 odd serials that went on air and were huge productions. I did all kinds of screenwriting, for telefilms, documentaries, feature writing for newspapers and I did some for BBC as well. Then one day I woke up with the feeling that what I wrote did not come across the way I wanted it to. That is when I started to direct. The trouble was that when I did start directing, I was afraid that no other director would want me to write scripts for them and this threatened me and made me feel insecure from a financial point of view since writing was my bread and butter then.\n\nQ) What have been your favorite serials so far of the ones that you have worked on?\n\nA) Thakan featuring Saba Qamar was one serial I particularly enjoyed, it has aired on Zindagi in India and I have received tremendous feedback. Many people were impressed by the sets used, little did they know that the serial was not shot on set. Teri Rah main Rull Gai was also a big hit, the title song was fabulous and is one that is close to me. It was an innovator in terms of the shooting and production values used. Dil Fareb on GEO these days, I thoroughly enjoyed because the art direction it employs is quite different than usual. It has a fresh look using emerging, versatile actors, Omair Rana and Mira Sethi and then Alia Butt for whom this was a debut performance. We worked closely on the nuances of the acting â€” stress pauses and the like â€” and all this has resonated with audiences who have reported back that this serial definitely has a certain freshness to it. Another one, it didnâ€™t do well, Dil Muhalay Ki Haveli, but I loved the concept. The story was centered on food and how people in our society are fanatical about food. The kind of atmosphere and psychosis this fanaticism about food creates within a household is what this serial was about.\n\nApart from this, Agar Ho Sakay To is currently on air. Thereâ€™s one particular scene which I told my wife makes me want to cry and when watching it with her the other day, I actually did start crying, to which she said to me, â€œNot only do you give your heart to every serial you direct but to this one, you have also given your tears.â€ Itâ€™s very emotional and it resonated so much with me that I felt compelled to write the lyrics to the title song myself.\n\nâ€œI learnt to love very early on and I love very intenselyâ€\n\nQ) How do you feel differently about filming on set versus on location?\n\nA) Almost all directors in the private sector in Pakistan have not experienced working on set. The set can almost be regarded as the sole domain of PTV. When they started making dramas, there were sets in use for films which were created specifically for films. You need timing, lighting and peace to create a certain mood. You would create a time of day. When this line of work opened up to the private sector, they had no opportunities to make sets. They were compelled to go to original locations and do one-camera shoots which led them to have to move things around. For example, if we are featuring a certain character who smokes a hookah, we would have much trouble finding a house that is reflective of this characterâ€™s social status and is also designed around the lifestyle and needs of a hookah smoker.\n\nWe in the private sector, who have developed like mushrooms, have not had the experience of working with sets and neither has any relevant talent developed over the years. PTV has not maintained its standard and propagated knowledge and skill as it should or was on the path to being. Neither did they utilize their stage, their academy and their huge library of archives to develop new talent. I was particularly ashamed to hear that my son didnâ€™t know who Munoo Bhai (of Sona Chandi fame) was.\n\nOnly now are there classes of schooled graduates coming out in the various fields of sets, wardrobes, lights, art direction, sounds, etc. Even in the private sector, on location, we are beginning to personalize locations and bring in props to fit our requirements, employing the skilled expertise of today.\n\nQ) Any people in the industry you think are particularly talented?\n\nA) Almost everyone in any industry in Pakistan possesses a fair bit of talent and the drive to want to show the world by doing something. As opposed to other nationalities where motivation and ambition is mainly derived from getting raises or promotions, our nation still considers itself young and in need of that extra mile. I still remember holding out a cloth in front of the TV screen while watching CNN to be able to get in all the censored bits! Our country is in a constant state of flux, and we have as a nation learnt to adapt and have become stronger and more resourceful as a result. Even in our industry, technicians have learnt to become cameramen and vice versa because everyone has conditioned themselves to make do with what they have. Teams come in from India and elsewhere and are impressed to see what kind of an environment we work in when compared to the work we put out. All these attributes are worth mentioning.\n\nI have always made it a point to work with new people, Sohail Sameer is someone whose career began with me along with Yumna Zaidi, Mira Sethi and Irfan Waheed: Iâ€™ve thoroughly enjoyed working with them. And the list does go on. Most newcomers from Lahore are people that I have worked with and are chosen by me mainly because our chemistries match. There will always be two to three actors making debut performances in any of my dramas.\n\nDespite the lack of support, our TV actors are excellent and achieve high level performances without the use of any gimmicks.\n\nA cherished moment with all his cast and crew\n\nReady to start filming for APlus\n\nOn the set of Dil Fareb with Omair Rana and Mira Sethi\n\nMy wife said to me:\n\nâ€œNot only do you give your heart to every serial you direct but to this one, you have also given your tearsâ€\n\nQ) Are scripts becoming less important?\n\nA) Thirty years ago, we did have great scripts and legendary scriptwriters, but since then screenwriting and star screenwriters have kind of fallen off the grid. Additionally, screenwriting is a product of the society in which it is born. And there has been constant upheaval and censorship here in Pakistan. Screenwriters have not received much support, recognition or compensation through the years. Even in other fields of work, who in the past 20 odd years has been nominated for any major international award such as the Nobel Prize? Everyone seems to have the attitude: “why should I be the martyr?” or “why bother?”\n\nEven so, weâ€™ve been able to take the drama market from 1.5 crores to 9 billion rupees where today 108 channels are on air with licenses whereas the cable operator is only capable of showing 80 channels. Still, the fact that over the past 2 years, scripts have been being repeated is not solely the fault of the writers but also the channels that have a tight hold on creative output.\n\nQ) How do you source talent in Pakistan?\n\nA) Some friends of ours and myself have gotten together to set up a platform for recruiting talent specifically for television. The website should be up and running by the end of the week. It has the format and capacity for interested candidates to set up their profiles where casting can be done from. It will also help us to pick out more specifically cast members who are appropriate for certain roles more so than the actors that are already in the circle and are well known to us already.\n\nIt will also help us to navigate problems associated with auditioning. Every second on set is paid for and when we have newcomers come to the set to audition, it takes up some of our very valuable and expensive time. In Fast and the Furious 7 which was recently in cinemas, they have an Arab character for which they have cast an Indian. Pakistanis are much closer in looks and speech to Arabs than Indians but since the casting directors of this film did not know where to look for Pakistani talent, they found it from where they could.\n\nOn Chundrigar Rd.\n\nwhile filming Bewafaii Tumhare Naam\n\nOn the set of Agar Ho Sakay To with Syed Jibran & Sunita Marshall\n\nWith Iffat Omar and Yasir Nawaz on the set of Bewafai Tumhare Naam\n\nQ) Why arenâ€™t comedies, childrenâ€™s shows and other neglected genres given as much importance anymore?\n\nA) At first, it was PTV only and as a national institution, PTV was obliged to run all types of genres. There are no channels showing the various cultures of Pakistan or featuring any classic music programs. We are being restricted to a singular language, culture and religion, even though our alternate media on the internet is mounting increasing pressure on mainstream channels to diversify the content they broadcast. If no one raises their voice and demands something different, then the channel showing the same thing over and over again that is getting them the highest ratings will continue doing so. Itâ€™s important for the public to share their point of view and demand better and diversified content.\n\nQ) What is your greatest weakness?\n\nA) I learnt to love very early on and I love very intensely. You can call it a weakness or strength, either way, I have gained and learnt much from it.\n\nThe other is my little daughter, she is the apple of my eye.\n\nA 13 year younger Amin Iqbal at a workshop\n\nOn the set of Anokhi with Mona Liza\n\nQ) What is your greatest extravagance?\n\nA) It canâ€™t really be something I spend money on since I never get time to spend money anywhere. My schedule is nonstop, almost 7 days a week, 17 hours a day and that too with transit between Lahore and Karachi. Iâ€™ve written once: kamaata koi hain, khaata koi and that is the case with my wife and I. This was the case with my father and his father, I guess it is just the circle of life.\n\nQ) How is your ideal day off spent?\n\nA) As you can see, I donâ€™t get many days off but anytime I get to speak with my mother or my wife is great for me and almost 5-7 times a day. Otherwise, anytime I get to spend with my kids is ideal. I was an only child and I have six kids. I love to play and get up to silly nothings, jumping around, throwing water, taking ice and slipping it down someoneâ€™s back, yelling, whatever.\n\nWhat is your idea of style for the modern woman?\n\nThe modern woman is strong, independent and doesnâ€™t want to get boxed into a single style. She needs clothes that look trendy, fresh and yet donâ€™t make too much of a dent in the wallet. Itâ€™s great to see so many of the young generation have individual styles these days. Whether it is uber glam, high street or bohemian itâ€™s refreshing to witness women hold their own and not necessarily be â€œon trend.â€ That is why when Saira and I started Saaya, we sought inspiration from a range of things so we could create a brand that would appeal to different women from various walks of life\n\nWhich living person do you most admire for his or her signature style?\n\nFrom the West I love Emma Watson. Her style has really evolved and it is now effortlessly chic. At our end I think Fawad Khan has emerged as an icon in more ways than one\n\nWhat trait do you most admire in people?\n\nHumility. I truly believe that if any artistic creation is executed with love and sincerity then it should carry its own weight without any need for arrogance or boastfulness\n\nâ€œItâ€™s refreshing to witness women hold their own and not necessarily be â€œon trendâ€\n\nWhat is your greatest extravagance?\n\nCurrently all I want to spend money on is travel. It is so fascinating to see the differences and similarities among people of different cultures. I find traveling gives me the most amount of inspiration when designing for Saaya. For example I was so fascinated with dervishes from Turkey; they inspired us to create our tunics with images of twirling dervishes, which to date is one of our favorite designs\n\nWhat is your favorite journey?\n\nI recently took a trip up north with my husband and son and I was just blown away. Too many of us focus our attention on traveling abroad when we have heaven in our own back yard. I met the friendliest people and encountered the most beautiful scenery. It truly made me proud to be a Pakistani\n\nWhat do you consider the most overrated virtue?\n\nConformity. I think people appear most beautiful when they take fashion trends and blend them with their own unique style. I love it when people wear Saaya kameezes and make it their own. Iâ€™ve seen two women wearing the exact same kameez, but because of their distinctive flare the outfit looked completely different: thatâ€™s the beauty of being your own person\n\nHow are you using your medium to promote and maintain Pakistan’s culture?\n\nI have been lucky enough to be part of a field where one can really promote what is most positive about us. Clothes from the subcontinent are by far the most beautiful in the world. I am always stunned by the sheer raw talent and dexterity of our kaarigars. In this way I am so grateful that I can use my work to showcase Pakistani culture. Whether itâ€™s a block print of a twirling dervish, Urdu scripture or an embroidered elephant or rickshaw, giving your clothes an eastern touch always proves to be a winner!\n\nWhat is your greatest achievement?\n\nI would have to say Saaya. It had always been our dream to create a brand which made affordable and trendy outfits for women with eclectic tastes. Despite some challenges Saira and I were able to launch the brand in March 2013 and we overwhelmed with the response. It has been an amazing journey so far! No matter how much hard work we put in or how frustrating the process gets on occasion, Saaya always provides us with a sense of achievement and satisfaction. We canâ€™t wait to see it grow further\n\nWhich words or phrases do you most overuse?\n\nLive and let live. Life is too short to judge someone elseâ€™s journey. (I wish more people in Pakistan would embrace this motto!)\n\nName an item in your wardrobe you canâ€™t do without.\n\nThese days its definitely a pair of gold cork wedges. You can wear them in the day with a casual outfit or spruce up an evening ensemble by slipping them on. They look great with both eastern and western outfits\n\nName three things in your handbag that are always there.\n\nChapstick, mobile phone and a measuring tape.\n\nWhat in future do you consider your greatest achievement?\n\nI would be delighted if Saaya became a brand that people associated with fashion and affordability â€” a brand which provides something for everyone and for all occasions. We are currently working on a more semi-formal, formal line which we hope to launch some time this year\n\nWhat or who is the greatest love of your life?\n\nWithout a doubt my son and my sister. I’m obsessed with both of them. It might sound clichÃ©d but no matter how hard my day is or whatever may have transpired, when I see Ali, it puts a smile on my face.\n\nWith my sister Saira, it’s like we are two sides of the same coin. She completely gets where I’m coming from without me having to articulate it. I’m very fortunate to have these people in my life\n\nIf you were to die and come back as a person or thing, what do you think it would be?\n\nI would have to say the Dalai Lama. I love his peaceful and positive attitude towards life. Itâ€™s something truly worth emulating\n\n“I am lucky to be part of a field where one can promote what is most positive about Pakistan”\n\nWhat are the challenges in keeping ready-to-wear fashion affordable?\n\nUnfortunately conducting any type of business in a place like Karachi is a challenge. One is always losing working days because of civil unrest, strikes, national holidays etc. Adding to that the hardships faced by employees have to be accounted for as well. This leads to a lot of unforeseen variable costs. But one has to power through these issues and churn out a product that one is proud of and that is worth the price\n\nWhat inspired you to subtly westernise the eastern ensemble?\n\nIt all depends on the market you are catering for. I want to wear ensembles that are traditional but have a modern twist and that is why at Saaya you wonâ€™t find out-and-out ethnic pieces. They have a very strong western element. I think that is one of our strengths. We integrate local handiwork and materials with a western twist. Iâ€™m not a big fan of the word â€˜fusionâ€™ but in essence thatâ€™s what it is\n\nWhat advice would you like to give the teenage girl who looks towards making a mark in the fashion industry?\n\nThink Big. With the right talent, handwork, and dedication I think any dream is possible and no goal is unachievable. We have so many examples of designers who started out in small workshops and today are the biggest names in the industry. Itâ€™s truly inspiring.\n\nConsidering that women in Pakistan are now rapidly entering the work environment what in your mind makes for a good work attire?\n\nAt Saaya we always have the working woman in mind. That is why many of our ready-to-wear cottons are simple, chic and affordable. Working women need outfits which allow them to exude confidence, through comfortable yet trendy cuts, colours and fabrics. We try to find that blend in our cotton line which proved to be very popular\n\nAs a woman, what difficulties have you faced in starting your venture? Please mention anyone who stands out in their support in helping your work.\n\nFortunately we didnâ€™t face many difficulties in starting Saaya. The credit for that definitely goes to our husbands and our parents. Our friends and employees have all been bastions of strength in their own way. They have each contributed to making Saaya what it is. The fact is that without the backing of all the people in your life it is impossible to build a business.\n\nThe GT challenge: if you were asked to redesign the uniform for the ladies of our national airline, what would you do?\n\nI think itâ€™s definitely time to spruce up the uniform. Add an interesting print and make it a nicer shade of green. Also I would suggest a shorter kameez with a straight pant. In the 70s the uniform was kind of like that\n\nText & coordination | Marium Ali Khan\n\nPhotography | Gibran Jamshed\n\nMarium Hamid talks toÂ Mahjabeen ObaidÂ a pioneer of luxury invitations in PakistanÂ\n\nWhat is your idea of style for the modern woman?\n\nMinimal make up, pulled back hair, straight pants and a simple shirt with fun accessories. Also lots of arm candy, a statement handbag and comfortable shoes.\n\nWhich living person do you most admire for his or her signature style?\n\nTom Ford hands down.\n\nWhat is the trait you most admire in people?\n\nBeing real! There is nothing more admirable than a person who knows who they are and are comfortable in their skin.\n\nNo one is completely honest as everyone watches out for\n\ntheir best interest\n\nWhat is your greatest extravagance?\n\nJewellery!Â Isn’t it always!\n\nWhat is your favorite journey?\n\nFamily vacations with my father were always the most fun and extravagant. We would pick a destination and then drive around from city to city, exploring! All those holidays were just fantastic: lots of laughter, singing to tunes, stopping and exploring the food. I cherish each of those memorable journeys and that time spent together.\n\nWhat do you consider the most overrated virtue?\n\nHonesty. No one is completely honest as everyone watches out for their best interest.\n\nHow are you using your medium to promote and maintain Pakistan’s culture?\n\nAt Mahj Design Studios all our fabric invitations, boxes and announcements are handmade using raw materials that are sourced from Pakistan. We use fabrics and colors that are symbolic to our culture in bright Jamawars, silks and hand woven cottons. We design a lot of wedding monograms in Urdu and our customers abroad love the ethnic feel it adds to the overall look of the invitation.\n\nWe have also used truck art. It is one of the most widely recognized art and culture forms associated with Pakistani culture. The most appreciated were Christmas tree ornaments for customers abroad as corporate gifts.\n\nMahj Design Studios was started in 2008 to cater to the emerging demands of customers who wanted quality wedding invitations in Karachi but didn’t know where to find them. Â It rapidly gained recognition online and surprisingly Pakistanis settled abroad became the core clientele who wanted a ‘touch of home’ for their wedding invitations. In 2010 Mahj Design Studios expanded into wedding favors, baby announcements, personalized stationery and notecards. Mahj Design Studios works with customers and wedding planners designing invitations according to the colors and theme of the wedding where each invitation is carefully designed and tailored, not only to meet, but to exceed the expectations of its customers with exclusivity and differentiation. We are now expanding into home accessories and lifestyle products so stay tuned for our new inspiring venture!Â\n\nWhich words or phrases do you most overuse?\n\nColour colour colour! make the design pop! Make it look fresh and happy.\n\nWhile I enjoy designing the elegant black and white invitations for non-Pakistani weddings abroad, I feel that our weddings are the one time in our lives where family and friends join together in music and dance, mehndis and chooris! The invitation is a prelude to the wedding so it should reflect that vibe! It should set the tone for what’s to come.\n\nTo successfully transmit that energy into an invitation requires a lot of knowledge of fonts and design symbols. Anyone can print fuchsia pink or orange on a card but to be able to make the font, colour and designs all work well together requires knowledge and exposure.\n\nWhat is your greatest achievement?\n\nProfessionally I think it has yet to come as I set the bar really high for myself and keep pushing the possibilities. However, recently Mahj Design Studios has had the honour of being included among the most reputable couture wedding invitation companies around the world.\n\nThe feature and link to this website is below\n\nhttp://www.luxuriouswedding.com/invitation-designer-pakistan.html\n\nWhat or who is the greatest love of your life?\n\nMy family and designing. A designer’s mind is always in motion,Â observing and absorbing. I am constantly storing knowledge somewhere at the back of my mind to revisit that memory at a later stage.\n\nWhat in the future would you consider your greatest achievement?\n\nI would like to open a couture stationery outlet for our walk-in clients in Karachi as we currently only meet by pre-scheduled appointments. I would also stock at retail stores across the globe, PAPYRUS stores being a good benchmark for achievement.\n\nIf you were to die and come back as a person or thing, what do you think it would be?\n\nI would have to say me! I am very intrigued by myself and my mind. Sometimes I sit in solitude and listen to the whispers of my mind’s eye and then an idea just pops and I go with it.\n\nRecently Mahj Design Studios has had the honour of being included among the most reputable couture wedding invitation companies around the world\n\nWhat is your most marked characteristic in the world of art?\n\nBeing the pioneer of making luxury invitations and stationery in Pakistan where each one of our pieces is a work of art. Our handmade invitations are bespoke pieces that stand apart in their creativity and artistic expression. One of our most extravagant pieces would have to be the ones we made for a royal wedding where we hand-carved a design inspired by Islamic architecture. It took a long time but the results were breathtaking.\n\nWhat is the quality you most like in a woman?\n\nA woman who can balance work, family, friends and run a home.\n\nWhat advice would you like to give teenage girls?\n\nTo complete their education and to work; to make their own money, and to travel and see the world. Never rely on another person for your happiness: it comes from within. Be strong enough to voice your opinions and never internalize. Scream if you feel like it, get stark raving mad, speak your mind and make your stance very clear. We live in a society where girls are meant to brush things under the carpet and are told not to confront. The most important advice would be to be assertive so that no one takes advantage of you.\n\nHow do you strike a balance between work, home and children?\n\nWith lots of coffee and help from my husband and my mother. Everything is on a schedule. I honestly think that working mothers spend the most amount of quality time with their children as they are so focused in being present both physically and mentally to make up for the lost time when they are away.\n\nConsidering that women in Pakistan are receiving increased recognition for their contribution to the economy, how does your venture support women?\n\nMost of our invitations and favor boxes are all hand-made by women which is the main source of income for their families. We carry out training classes for them as this type of artwork requires a lot of practice and precision and while teaching them the art of making our exquisite boxes with fabrics and crystal, their eyes light up with the vibrancy of color and feel of the soft silks. Teaching them an art that they too can become masters of their own destiny.\n\nAs a woman, what difficulties have you faced in starting your venture? Please mention anyone who stands out in their support in helping your work.\n\nNo difficulties at all, I started Mahj Design Studios in 2008 and it has grown internationally since then. We actually prefer working with clients abroad as it is much easier to communicate via email and skype. Also less interference by the clients let’s us have more control over the design process which is what we are hired to do.\n\nName an essential quality an artist-turned-entrepreneur needs in an emerging market.\n\nOne needs to be able to market their work properly. They must first know who their customer is and try and find avenues to approach them.\n\nWhere do you see yourself as an entrepreneur 5 years from now?\n\nWith retail outlets of our own, and being sold at PAPYRUS\n\nName a local home-grown brand whose success you admire.\n\nMaheen Karim\n\nText & coordination | Marium Ali Khan\n\nPhotography | Gibran Jamshed\n\nHair & makeup | Saman Zubair\n\nat Saman Salon & Spa\n\nNecklace | Outhouse\n\n(Sana Hafeez Shaikh the Official Representative of Outhouse Indian Jewelry in Pakistan)\n\nDesignersÂ Saira and ShakiraÂ are increasingly chipping away the walls ofÂ convention in fashion\n\nGT talks to the duo about their remarkable creativity\n\nHow did you get started with Saira Shakira?\n\nShakira: We started working after we graduated from fashion school. We were married and we weren’t doing anything, so from a very small setup at home we began making clothes for our family and friends. Then our husbands supported us and pushed us because we were pursuing this slowly. It’s been three years. We did our first prÃªt show in 2014, PFDC, and then we did bridal week too.\n\nSaira: We started off with prÃªt and that became our forte. Now we have started venturing into formals and bridals too.\n\nAre you more interested in bridals or prÃªt?\n\nShakira: We like doing prÃªt more because you can experiment. With bridals, everyone wants very typical stuff. When a bride comes to us, she usually wants something very “pretty pretty” and flowy and long.\n\nSaira: PrÃªt requires just as much money, cloth, trimmings, etc., except for the work (kaam). But the margins are definitely bigger in bridals and formals when compared to prÃªt.\n\nâ€˜Men tend to do better in this industry because the workers take them more seriouslyâ€™\n\nTell us about your production and design processes?\n\nSaira: We prefer doin"
