Spider-Man Unlimited

Stagione 1

When Spider-Man spots his two main enemies, Venom and Carnage, hijacking on John Jameson's spaceship on a trip to the mysterious planet, Counter-Earth, he fails to stop them, where the ship crashes and Jameson presumably dies. The public then blames Spider-Man who fakes his own death and lies low for half a year until he gets a new nano-tech costume and gets another ride to Counter-Earth.
