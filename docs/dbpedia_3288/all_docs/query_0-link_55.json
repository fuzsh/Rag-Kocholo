        "text": "Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds, is one of the greatest antagonists in Marvel Comics history. We say antagonist and not villain, because Galactus is a character whose motivations hold no real malice. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created Galactus in the pages of Fantastic Four, way back in 1966. And he has remained a fixture of the Marvel Universe ever since. He’s finally making his MCU debut in 2025’s The Fantastic Four: First Steps. This follows a previous appearance in live-action in 2007’s Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer left fans wanting (to put it mildly). In the case of Galactus, there is much comic book lore for Hollywood to pull from.\n\n“The Galactus Trilogy,” the Character’s First Appearance in Marvel’s Fantastic Four\n\nIn the ’60s, Fantastic Four, along with Amazing Spider-Man, were far and away Marvel Comics’ biggest-selling titles. Yes, once upon a time, the X-Men and Avengers did not rule the roost. Lee and Kirby were five years into their ten-year run on Fantastic Four in 1966, hitting their creative stride. This came to a head in issues #48-50 of Fantastic Four, now known as “The Galactus Trilogy.” These issues also introduced the Herald of Galactus, the Silver Surfer, a character who would become one of the publisher’s key characters.\n\n“The Coming of Galactus”\n\nIn Fantastic Four #48, the team were catching their breath after meeting the Inhumans. But soon they were faced with an even bigger problem. Much bigger. The Watcher, an entity sworn not to interfere with cosmic events, appeared to Reed Richards. He broke his oath and warned him that the Silver Surfer was on his way. The Surfer was looking for a living world for his master Galactus to consume. He explained Galactus as a cosmic entity above the concepts of good and evil, who needed to drain the living energy of worlds for sustenance. The Watcher tried to hide the Earth from the Silver Surfer but he found the planet regardless. It was then that Galactus arrived, in his 28-foot-tall glory.\n\n“If This Be Doomsday”\n\nIn Fantastic Four #49, “If This Be Doomsday,” the Watcher tries to plead to Galactus to spare the Earth and its billions of inhabitants. But Galactus did not listen. He begins to build the machine he would need to suck the life out of the Earth, leaving it an empty husk. The Watcher then took a gamble. He informed Johnny Storm that there was one weapon in the cosmos that could stop Galactus—the Ultimate Nullifier. He powered the Human Torch up to cosmic levels, allowing him to fly through space and find the Nullifier on Taa II, Galactus’ ship. Meanwhile, the Thing’s girlfriend Alicia Masters did everything she could to convince the Silver Surfer to turn against his master.\n\n“The Startling Saga of the Silver Surfer”\n\nIn the final chapter of the Galactus Trilogy, “The Startling Saga of the Silver Surfer,” the Herald turns against his master. This gives Mr. Fantastic enough time to prepare the Ultimate Nullifier to use against Galactus. It is only then that Galactus agrees to spare the Earth, in exchange for the weapon. However, for his betrayal, Galactus banishes the Silver Surfer to Earth. Galactus departs to find another world to feast on. This would not be the last time that Galactus would pose a threat, however. Far from it. Although, he was used sparingly over the next several years in the pages of Fantastic Four.\n\nGalactus’ Origin Revealed in the Pages of The Mighty Thor\n\nIn 1969’s The Mighty Thor #168-169, Lee and Kirby revealed the origin of Galactus. Marvel would later tweak it and elaborate upon it, but the core story was there in those two Thor issues. We learn that Galactus was originally Galan of the planet Taa, a world which existed in the pre-Big Bang universe. As all life started to gradually die in that universe, Taa was one of the few remaining worlds. Galan and other survivors left Taa on a spacecraft, soon swallowed up in the Big Crunch. Galan did not die. He bonded with the Sentience of the Universe, and when our new universe was born in the Big Bang, he emerged as a new cosmic being called Galactus. As Galactus, he must eternally feed on the energy of living worlds to sustain his own immortal life. The first world that fell prey to his hunger was the planet Archeopia.\n\nThe Fantastic Four, Reed Richards, and “The Trial of Galactus”\n\nThe origins of Galactus are further expanded on by Fantastic Four writer/artist John Byrne. After a story where Galactus returns to Earth and Reed Richards saves his life, 1982’s “The Trial of Galactus” story begins. This story is really about the trial of Reed Richards, despite the title. Several alien races gather to hold Mister Fantastic accountable for saving the life of Galactus. A decision that let the Devourer of Worlds destroy planet after planet. Among these worlds was the Skrull Empire’s Throneworld. Reed Richards is ultimately acquitted, and the cosmic entity Eternity explains how the universe needs Galactus. This is because he serves a cosmic function as part of the universal life cycle.\n\nSince then, Galactus has tried to consume the Beyonder’s Battleworld during the original Secret Wars, and tried to rid himself of the cosmic hunger by consuming the Infinity Stones. In more recent years, Galactus transformed into a Lifebringer instead of a Devourer of Worlds. He used his power cosmic to recreate Archeopia, the first planet that he ever destroyed, billions of years ago. Sadly, this phase didn’t last long, and he was forcibly transformed back into a Devourer of Worlds by another cosmic being, Logos. Most recently, Thor Odinson killed Galactus, but as a cosmic entity older than time, he can’t really die. Galactus is truly eternal.\n\nThe Powers and Abilities of Galactus\n\nGalactus’ power levels are near infinite. As a being older than the universe itself, he truly is like a god. As the wielder of the Power Cosmic, Galactus has something called universal cosmic awareness, as well as unlimited telepathy and telekinesis. He can change the substance of matter and teleport by making interdimensional portals across space. He can even resurrect the dead and create life if he so chooses, even whole planets. However, it’s a power he rarely employs. Galactus is the smartest being in the universe, with an intellect that is beyond comprehension. He can extend a portion of his Power Cosmic to his Heralds, as he did for Norrin Radd of Zenn-La, who became the Silver Surfer.\n\nThe Many Heralds of Galactus\n\nThe Silver Surfer is the most famous Herald of Galactus, a being whom he directed to scout the universe for worlds on which he can feed, but he was hardly the first. The first known Herald of Galactus was a being known as the Tyrant. The Fallen One came next. After the Surfer, there was the Air-Walker, Firelord, and Terrax the Tamer. With the Silver Surfer representing water (in a way), the following three Heralds represented the other elements. The Heralds that followed were Nova II (Frankie Raye, a human from Earth), Morg the Executioner, and Stardust. Then, there were the “temporary” Heralds, famous characters that worked for Galactus for one storyline. Among these were the mutant pop star Dazzler, Doctor Strange, Thor, and even Peter Parker’s Aunt May as “Golden Oldie.” Ok, Marvel relegated that story as just Peter Parker’s dream, but it kind of counts.\n\nThe Devourer of Worlds in Other Media\n\nGalactus has appeared in other media, but rarely faithfully. The original 1967 Fantastic Four cartoon displayed him with green skin and armor. The 1994-1996 Fantastic Four animated series portrayed him more faithfully, in an adaptation of the original Galactus Trilogy. He also appeared in the 1998 Silver Surfer cartoon. Galactus made his big screen debut (in a manner of speaking) in 2007’s Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. The film portrayed Galactus as a giant cosmic cloud, without a humanoid form. Although the digital effects crew did sneak in a fiery silhouette of comic book Galactus’ helmet, knowing it would please the comic book fans in the audience.\n\nGalactus in Fantastic Four: First Steps and the Larger MCU"
