That moment arrived in MARVEL PREMIERE, where hot new art talents illustrated tales tinged with Lovecraftian horror. Writer Steve Englehart and artist Frank Brunner then brought Doctor Strange to new heights of cosmic consciousness and other-dimensional adventure. Brunner’s art mixed a deliriously lush line with psychedelic stylings, while Englehart’s scripting plumbed the depths of Strange’s soul. The series goes from strength to strength when artist Gene Colan returns, and the entity Eternity declares that the end-times are here. Next comes a Doc Strange-vs.-Dracula crossover and a time-traveling Occult History of America.
