        "text": "The Marvel Animated Universe (MAU) is a fan term for cartoons based on Marvel Comics characters that share some continuity. The Marvel Animated Universe started on October 31, 1992, with X-Men and ended on March 31, 2001, with Spider-Man Unlimited. However, the MAU was revived in 2023 with X-Men '97. The Marvel Animated Universe consists of nine different television series.\n\nTelevision series\n\nX-Men: The Animated Series (1992-1997)\n\nFantastic Four: The Animated Series (1994-1996)\n\nIron Man: The Animated Series (1994-1996)\n\nSpider-Man: The Animated Series (1994-1998)\n\nThe Incredible Hulk (1996-1997)\n\nSilver Surfer: The Animated Series (1998)\n\nSpider-Man Unlimited (1999-2001)\n\nAvengers: United They Stand (1999-2000)\n\nX-Men '97 (2023)\n\nCancelled series\n\nThe following series were planned but ended up never being produced.\n\nDaredevil: The Animated Series\n\nCaptain America: The Animated Series\n\nGhost Rider: The Animated Series\n\nBlack Panther: The Animated Series\n\nThe Black Widow\n\nContinuity errors\n\n1. Continuity error: Scarlet Spider was created in an alternate reality but appears in the episode Nightmare in Green of Fantastic Four: The Animated Series and One Man's Worth, Part I of X-Men: The Animated Series which is part of the mainstream universe.\n\n1. Solution: There is more than one Scarlet Spider. The one shown in Fantastic Four and X-Men is from the mainstream universe while the one that appears in the Spider-Man: The Animated Series is from an alternate reality.\n\n2. Continuity error: In The Fantastic Four episode, To Battle a Living Planet (1995), She-Hulk is shown as a member of the Avengers. However, The Incredible Hulk episode, Doomed (1996) showed Jennifer Walters becoming She-Hulk.\n\n2. Solution: The episode Doomed takes place before To Battle a Living Planet.\n\n3. Continuity error: In the X-Men episode, Repo Man (1993), Sasquatch is a member of Alpha Flight. However, in The Incredible Hulk episode, Man to Man, Beast to Beast (1996), Walter Langkowski turns himself into Sasquatch for the first time.\n\n3. Solution: Man to Man, Beast to Beat takes place before Repo Man.\n\n4. Continuity error: Vision is shown as a member of the Avengers in the Fantastic Four episode To Battle a Living Planet (1995), but is first created by Ultron in the Avengers: United They Stand episode Avengers Assemble, Part I (1999).\n\n4. Solution: Avengers Assemble Part 1 & 2 takes place before To Battle a Living Planet.\n\n5. Continuity error: At the end of Secret Wars, Chapter III: Doom, Madame Web returns Captain America to the vortex, but in Fantastic Four and Avengers: United They Stand, Captain America is free from the vortex and a member of the Avengers.\n\n5. Solution: Sometime after the events of Secret Wars, Part III: Doom, the Avengers free Captain America from the vortex and he joins the team.\n\n6. Continuity error: At the end of the episode, Carnage, Venom and Carnage are trapped in another dimension. However, in Spider-Man Unlimited, it is stated that they were being held captive by S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\n6. Solution: Venom and Carnage somehow escape the Dark Dimension and were captured by S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\n7. Continuity error: In the episode Hulk Buster (1996) from Iron Man: The Animated Series, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner do not know each other personally. However, in Helping Hand, Iron Fist (1996) of The Incredible Hulk series Tony Stark and Bruce Banner are good friends.\n\n7. Solution: Helping Hand, Iron Fist takes place after Hulk Buster.\n\nThe Silver Surfer series takes place in a totally different reality from the other seven shows. This is because Silver Surfer: The Animated Series contradicts several events from Fantastic Four: The Animated Series.\n\nTimeline\n\nIf you don't go by air dates it is possible to create a streamline continuity between all the shows despite all of the series being created by different people. Some episodes could take place around the same time.\n\nDespite Spider-Man: The Animated Series lasting for five years, several episodes take place within the span of a few months. This is the same for other series in the Marvel Animated Universe.\n\nAnd the Sea Shall Give Up It's Dead (Iron Man: TAS)\n\nRejoice!
