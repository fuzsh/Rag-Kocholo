        "text": "Tier List\n\nHero, Global, Mystic, Protector, Darkhold, Vigilant\n\nIso-8\n\nWong is a Protector, but his mechanics don’t need additional sustenance from the ISO-8 class to reach his full potential. Instead, he needs to be equipped with the Skirmisher class (like the rest of the Darkhold members) for his utility to be fully effective.\n\nIt’s important to say that he will retaliate against any attack received by any of the Darkhold members. So, he could also benefit from the Striker class if you want to increase the team’s overall damage output.\n\nIn the end, if you still want to increase the sustenance of the Darkhold Protector, be sure to give him a Fortifier, which will only be effective if you do the same to all other members. That way, the Darkhold’s Barrier will be at least 30% stronger – making them almost impenetrable. But if you do that it will reduce the team’s ability to place debuffs and use utilities.\n\nT4 Priority\n\nP – Passive ability\n\nU – Ultimate ability\n\nB – Basic ability\n\nS – Special ability\n\nPassive – Wong Passive should be upgraded 1st. It will prolong Defense Up on spawn for an additional turn (on self and all Darkhold allies). It will give 15% more armor to Wong. He would have +30% (in total), and Darkhold allies will gain +30% armor.\n\nUltimate – It will double the amount of his Barrier, transfer all negatives from self to target, and clear all debuffs from self (going up from 2 at level 6). Players should upgrade this ability ASAP.\n\nBasic – You should upgrade his Basic because he will clear one negative effect from all Darkhold allies whenever he uses it.\n\nSpecial – On level 7, this ability will ignore Defense Up, so it is a good upgrade but not crucial. Special is last on the list for his ability upgrades.\n\nInfographics\n\nSearch new character\n\nType the name of the character in the search box.
