        "text": "8.0\n\nWeekly Comic Book Review - Conrad Flanigan\n\nThis is a pretty decent comic at the end of the day. I'm interested in finding out if the theft of the X-Men's DNA has any impact on current continuity. I kind of doubt it, but it would make this series all the more worthwhile. Not essential but well worth adding to your collection, if you can afford the cost of yet another comic book. Read Full Review\n\n8.0\n\nComic Book Resources - James Hunt\n\nIt seems obvious that this series is aimed at fans of both Spider-Man and the X-Men, but beyond that there's plenty for comic fans to enjoy. If, however, you do fall into the former category, it looks like it's going to be a must-read. It might not feel like it's ultimately going to matter in the wider context of the parent titles, but when reading a comic is this fun, it doesn't have to. Read Full Review\n\n7.0\n\nComics Bulletin - David Wallace\n\nThis is the comics equivalent of candy floss: it's fluffy, pretty, and will probably remind you of being a kid, but it ultimately isn't going to provide you with any real sustenance - and after half an hour, you'll probably have forgotten about it altogether. Still, that's not necessarily a bad thing, and if you're used to a diet of grim 'n' gritty modern superhero books, this could prove to be the perfect palate-cleanser that reminds you how fun superhero comics can be. Read Full Review\n\n6.7\n\nIGN - Daniel Crown\n\nIn the end, Gage never really alienates modern sensibilities while managing to tell a fairly entertaining homage to the bronze age of the Marvel Universe. Alberti's pencils invoke the same sort of sentiment, and ultimately, this issue does an adequate (while slightly shallow) job at exploring the core debate at the heart of the X-Men. Read Full Review"
