        "text": "1\n\n1Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face!\n\n2Clouds of the west—sun there half an hour high—I see you also face to face.\n\n3Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are to me!\n\n4On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home, are more curious to me than you suppose,\n\n5And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.\n\n2\n\n6The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day,\n\n7The simple, compact, well-join’d scheme, myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme,\n\n8The similitudes of the past and those of the future,\n\n9The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on the walk in the street and the passage over the river,\n\n10The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,\n\n11The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,\n\n12The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.\n\n13Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,\n\n14Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,\n\n15Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east,\n\n16Others will see the islands large and small;\n\n17Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high,\n\n18A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them,\n\n19Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.\n\n3\n\n20It avails not, time nor place—distance avails not,\n\n21I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations hence,\n\n22Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,\n\n23Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd,\n\n24Just as you are refresh’d by the gladness of the river and the bright flow, I was refresh’d,\n\n25Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift current, I stood yet was hurried,\n\n26Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thick-stemm’d pipes of steamboats, I look’d.\n\n27I too many and many a time cross’d the river of old,\n\n28Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,\n\n29Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow,\n\n30Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south,\n\n31Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,\n\n32Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,\n\n33Look’d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water,\n\n34Look’d on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward,\n\n35Look’d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,\n\n36Look’d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,\n\n37Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,\n\n38Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,\n\n39The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars,\n\n40The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine pennants,\n\n41The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot-houses,\n\n42The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels,\n\n43The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,\n\n44The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and glistening,\n\n45The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks,\n\n46On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank’d on each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter,\n\n47On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night,\n\n48Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.\n\n4\n\n49These and all else were to me the same as they are to you,\n\n50I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,\n\n51The men and women I saw were all near to me,\n\n52Others the same—others who look back on me because I look’d forward to them,\n\n53(The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)\n\n5\n\n54What is it then between us?\n\n55What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?\n\n56Whatever it is, it avails not—distance avails not, and place avails not,\n\n57I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,\n\n58I too walk’d the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the waters around it,\n\n59I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,\n\n60In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,\n\n61In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me,\n\n62I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,\n\n63I too had receiv’d identity by my body,\n\n64That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I should be of my body.\n\n6\n\n65It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,\n\n66The dark threw its patches down upon me also,\n\n67The best I had done seem’d to me blank and suspicious,\n\n68My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?\n\n69Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,\n\n70I am he who knew what it was to be evil,\n\n71I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,\n\n72Blabb’d, blush’d, resented, lied, stole, grudg’d,\n\n73Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,\n\n74Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,\n\n75The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,\n\n76The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting,\n\n77Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting,\n\n78Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,\n\n79Was call’d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing,\n\n80Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as I sat,\n\n81Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a word,\n\n82Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,\n\n83Play’d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,\n\n84The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,\n\n85Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\n\n7\n\n86Closer yet I approach you,\n\n87What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you—I laid in my stores in advance,\n\n88I consider’d long and seriously of you before you were born.\n\n89Who was to know what should come home to me?\n\n90Who knows but I am enjoying this?\n\n91Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot see me?\n\n8\n\n92Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast-hemm’d Manhattan?\n\n93River and sunset and scallop-edg’d waves of flood-tide?\n\n94The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight, and the belated lighter?\n\n95What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as I approach?\n\n96What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face?\n\n97Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?\n\n98We understand then do we not?\n\n99What I promis’d without mentioning it, have you not accepted?\n\n100What the study could not teach—what the preaching could not accomplish is accomplish’d, is it not?\n\n9\n\n101Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!\n\n102Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg’d waves!\n\n103Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or the men and women generations after me!\n\n104Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!\n\n105Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn!\n\n106Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!\n\n107Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!\n\n108Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly!\n\n109Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my nighest name!\n\n110Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!\n\n111Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one makes it!\n\n112Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be looking upon you;\n\n113Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste with the hasting current;\n\n114Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air;\n\n115Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all downcast eyes have time to take it from you!\n\n116Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any one’s head, in the sunlit water!\n\n117Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail’d schooners, sloops, lighters!\n\n118Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower’d at sunset!\n\n119Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses!\n\n120Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,\n\n121You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,\n\n122About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung out divinest aromas,\n\n123Thrive, cities—bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient rivers,\n\n124Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,\n\n125Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.\n\n126You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,\n\n127We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward,\n\n128Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us,\n\n129We use you, and do not cast you aside—we plant you permanently within us,\n\n130We fathom you not—we love you—there is perfection in you also,\n\n131You furnish your parts toward eternity,\n\n132Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.\n\n1\n\n1Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face!\n\n2Clouds of the west—sun there half an hour high—I see you also face to face.\n\n3Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are to me!\n\n4On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home, are more curious to me than you suppose,\n\n5And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.\n\n2\n\n6The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day,\n\n7The simple, compact, well-join’d scheme, myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme,\n\n8The similitudes of the past and those of the future,\n\n9The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on the walk in the street and the passage over the river,\n\n10The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,\n\n11The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,\n\n12The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.\n\n13Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,\n\n14Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,\n\n15Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east,\n\n16Others will see the islands large and small;\n\n17Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high,\n\n18A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them,\n\n19Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.\n\n3\n\n20It avails not, time nor place—distance avails not,\n\n21I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations hence,\n\n22Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,\n\n23Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd,\n\n24Just as you are refresh’d by the gladness of the river and the bright flow, I was refresh’d,\n\n25Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift current, I stood yet was hurried,\n\n26Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thick-stemm’d pipes of steamboats, I look’d.\n\n27I too many and many a time cross’d the river of old,\n\n28Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,\n\n29Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow,\n\n30Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south,\n\n31Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,\n\n32Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,\n\n33Look’d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water,\n\n34Look’d on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward,\n\n35Look’d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,\n\n36Look’d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,\n\n37Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,\n\n38Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,\n\n39The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars,\n\n40The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine pennants,\n\n41The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot-houses,\n\n42The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels,\n\n43The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,\n\n44The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and glistening,\n\n45The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks,\n\n46On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank’d on each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter,\n\n47On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night,\n\n48Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.\n\n4\n\n49These and all else were to me the same as they are to you,\n\n50I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,\n\n51The men and women I saw were all near to me,\n\n52Others the same—others who look back on me because I look’d forward to them,\n\n53(The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)\n\n5\n\n54What is it then between us?\n\n55What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?\n\n56Whatever it is, it avails not—distance avails not, and place avails not,\n\n57I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,\n\n58I too walk’d the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the waters around it,\n\n59I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,\n\n60In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,\n\n61In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me,\n\n62I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,\n\n63I too had receiv’d identity by my body,\n\n64That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I should be of my body.\n\n6\n\n65It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,\n\n66The dark threw its patches down upon me also,\n\n67The best I had done seem’d to me blank and suspicious,\n\n68My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?\n\n69Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,\n\n70I am he who knew what it was to be evil,\n\n71I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,\n\n72Blabb’d, blush’d, resented, lied, stole, grudg’d,\n\n73Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,\n\n74Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,\n\n75The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,\n\n76The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting,\n\n77Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting,\n\n78Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,\n\n79Was call’d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing,\n\n80Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as I sat,\n\n81Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a word,\n\n82Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,\n\n83Play’d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,\n\n84The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,\n\n85Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\n\n7\n\n86Closer yet I approach you,\n\n87What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you—I laid in my stores in advance,\n\n88I consider’d long and seriously of you before you were born.\n\n89Who was to know what should come home to me?\n\n90Who knows but I am enjoying this?\n\n91Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot see me?\n\n8\n\n92Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast-hemm’d Manhattan?\n\n93River and sunset and scallop-edg’d waves of flood-tide?\n\n94The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight, and the belated lighter?\n\n95What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as I approach?\n\n96What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face?\n\n97Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?\n\n98We understand then do we not?\n\n99What I promis’d without mentioning it, have you not accepted?\n\n100What the study could not teach—what the preaching could not accomplish is accomplish’d, is it not?\n\n9\n\n101Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!\n\n102Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg’d waves!\n\n103Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or the men and women generations after me!\n\n104Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!\n\n105Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn!\n\n106Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!\n\n107Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!\n\n108Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly!\n\n109Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my nighest name!\n\n110Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!\n\n111Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one makes it!\n\n112Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be looking upon you;\n\n113Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste with the hasting current;\n\n114Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air;\n\n115Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all downcast eyes have time to take it from you!\n\n116Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any one’s head, in the sunlit water!\n\n117Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail’d schooners, sloops, lighters!\n\n118Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower’d at sunset!\n\n119Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses!\n\n120Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,\n\n121You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,\n\n122About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung out divinest aromas,\n\n123Thrive, cities—bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient rivers,\n\n124Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,\n\n125Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.\n\n126You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,\n\n127We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward,\n\n128Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us,\n\n129We use you, and do not cast you aside—we plant you permanently within us,\n\n130We fathom you not—we love you—there is perfection in you also,\n\n131You furnish your parts toward eternity,\n\n132Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul."
