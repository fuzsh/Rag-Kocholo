        "text": "In the nineties, progress in the field of animation led to a slew of superhero cartoons, with Marvel definitely taking the lion’s share of properties broadcast to viewers. Alongside memorable series like X-Men and Spider-Man, there were also new cartoons based on the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, and Iron Man. Though not anywhere near as successful as the aforementioned two, these three series did at least make it to a second season. Amongst all of these series stands something of an oddity in the realm of Marvel’s animated stable – the Silver Surfer cartoon, run for one season on Fox Kids in 1997. As well as being one of the few Marvel properties that didn’t make it to the second season (including Spider-Man Unlimited and the sorely missed Wolverine And The X-Men) , the Silver Surfer was notable amongst the Marvel cartoons at the time for the fact that it remained wholly self contained. While all the aforementioned cartoons met each other in some way shape or form (with the exception of Spider-Man and Hulk), Silver Surfer remained wholly separate from the rest of those series, set entirely within its own continuity as opposed to the somewhat shared continuity of the others. But given the rich number of cosmic characters the series was allowed to play with, had it been given a chance to develop and mature, it could have done perfectly well without them. From Galactus to Thanos, from Drax The Destroyer to Adam Warlock, from Beta Ray Bill to Ego, The Living Planet, Silver Surfer could have really been an opportunity to let the cosmic side of Marvel shine on the big screen. Alas, it never came to pass.\n\nBefore being aware of the existence of the series, I happened upon this VHS release of the first three episodes edited into a film in a local supermarket. Being a massive Marvel fan at the time and seeing it emulate the wonderful art of Jack Kirby, I grabbed it and settled down to watch when I got back in. After going through the usual array of trailers common to VHS (oh how we all thought we were hard done by not being able to get to the movie quicker…then we dealt with dvds), in kicked the introductory sequence. It still ranks highly for me as one of the most impactful cartoon introductions ever, though of course I’m likely in the minority here.\n\nWhile previous appearances from the Surfer in Fantastic Four cartoons only briefly touched upon the Surfer’s backstory, giving the viewer just enough for the episodes he appeared in, taking centre stage allowed the character a chance to be fully explored. Indeed, the first episode is devoted to showing just how the Surfer came to be. It’s all here, his home planet of Zenn-La, his beloved Shalla-Bal, and the series of events that caused the Surfer to come into being. While the backstory of the Surfer is known well enough thanks to previous and subsequent incarnations of the character, showing the path that Norrin Radd took to become the Silver Surfer by sacrificing everything gives the whole thing far more weight and meaning than said incarnations. It plays out like a desperate tragedy effectively conveyed by the sum of its various parts.\n\nAs the story continues, we see the Surfer, with no knowledge of his past leading Galactus to consume worlds inhabited by life, despite the questions he has of his own past. With no memory of the man he once was, the Surfer finds himself wondering just where he came from, opening the way for an observing Thanos to capture and interrogate him with the assistance of Ego,The Living Planet, determined to seek a way to control Galactus. Thanks to the showdown with Thanos, the Silver Surfer regains his memories of his former life, and how Galactus has lied to him. Thus, the Silver Surfer sets out for a showdown with Galactus at his current target of sustenance…Earth.\n\nWhile the series as a whole has a mixed response, and the stories can vary in quality, the first three episodes are certainly worth checking out, especially if you can find the feature length edit. While DC still tends to set the bar high with their animated features, The Origin Of The Silver Surfer still in my eyes stands as the best representation outside of comics of a character so horrifically misused. This doesn’t just apply to the Silver Surfer – Galactus is shown as he should be, a being of incredible power able to wreak havoc on entire planets, as opposed to say, the giant cloud seen in Fantastic Four – Rise Of The Silver Surfer (though it wouldn’t be hard to beat that film’s Galactus at all…) The film won’t likely top your list for best animated feature, but it’s definitely worth a look to see the best screen version of the Surfer to date in my opinion, especially as with the distaster of the recent Fantastic Four (or Fant4astic) movie, and Marvel’s seeming distaste for promoting any characters Fox owns the film rights to, it may be some time before the Silver Surfer is given the chance to shine on-screen as he does here.\n\n“To me, my board!”"
