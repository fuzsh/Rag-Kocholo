        "text": "Tier List\n\nHero, Global, Mutant, Blaster, Unlimited X-Men\n\nIso-8\n\nFantomex can benefit from three classes evenly – Skirmisher, Striker, and Fortifier.\n\nTo place debuffs and Taunt and remove buffs from enemies pick the Skirmisher. To maximize damage output, pick the Striker. To improve Fantomex sustenance and boost up the barrier gained from Dazzler pick the Fortifier.\n\nIt may be appealing to give the Raider class to Fantomex since he will place Def Down with every critical hit using basic attack but in my opinion that would be a major mistake. Fantomex’s critical chance is increased by Gambit’s passive. Losing benefits from other classes is not justified just for increasing the Def Down chance, especially since all of his attacks are single target based.\n\nT4 Priority\n\nP – Passive ability\n\nS – Special ability\n\nU – Ultimate ability\n\nB – Basic ability\n\nPassive – On spawn, apply Evade to all Uxmen; While under the effect of Defense Up a 100% chance to Counterattack. Same as for Gambit, Fantomex needs only passive ability on maximum level to be fully effective (except for Special ability). Free Evade in the start on all Uxmen allies, totally changes the fighting potential of the whole team. Ignoring Fantomex Level 5 Passive is out of the question!\n\nInfographics\n\nSearch new character\n\nType the name of the character in the search box.
