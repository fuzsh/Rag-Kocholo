He'll tell you about how without his family's crest, he can't prove his heritage and take back his estate. His sons took the crest when they left, and he doesn't know where they all are, though last he heard, Caleb was working as a chef in Catherby.\n\nCaleb[edit | edit source]\n\nItems needed: Shrimps, bass, salmon, tuna and a swordfish (all cooked).\n\nHead to Catherby. Near the middle of town (south of the Farming shop), usually inside the building with the sink, though he wanders outside sometimes, is Caleb. Talk to him, and he'll say his brothers and he accidentally broke the crest into three parts and each of them ended up with a piece. Luckily, he still has his piece, though he's not going to just hand it over to any passing stranger. He has an important event coming up, and he needs some fish for a special salad. Get them for him, and he'll give you the piece of the crest. What you need is shrimp, salmon, tuna, bass, and swordfish all cooked. All but the salmon can be fished right there in Catherby. The salmon can be caught in a lake just a little north of the bank in the nearby town of Seers' Village. Once you have all of that, give it to him and he'll give you the piece as promised, along with a little bit of info. He'll say that the gem trader in Al Kharid might know more about the location of Avan.\n\nImportant: Make sure he tells you about the other missing pieces. If he doesn't, the gem trader will not have the right dialogue options, and you will have to talk to Caleb once again. It is necessary to talk to Caleb again immediately after receiving the piece of the crest to ask him where the other pieces are. Check the quest guide to make sure he's told you about Avan's location before proceeding.\n\nNote: Low level Ironman accounts without access to the Warriors' Guild could get 46 Fishing in order to catch a raw bass and 43 Cooking to cook it, or obtain it as a monster drop. They could also acquire cooked bass and cooked tuna by catching Gourmet implings with 28 Hunter. Alternatively, all of the fish except for the salmon can be purchased from Frankie's Fishing Emporium in Port Piscarilius.\n\nAvan[edit | edit source]\n\nItems needed: necklace mould, ring mould, any pickaxe, 2 cut rubies, food (optional), armour (optional), a method to get to Falador and Ardougne (optional but will save running) and a Mining boost (if boosting).\n\nWhen you talk to the gem trader in Al Kharid, he will remember the person you're looking for, direct you north towards the gold rocks in a pit in the desert. Head there and talk to the man wandering around just at the entrance to the pit with a yellow cape on. This is, indeed, Avan, as he'll tell you when you ask him. He's not giving up his piece of the crest though unless you can help him win the affection of a certain lady by getting him a ring and necklace made out of perfect gold. Unfortunately, the stuff there in the desert isn't nearly good enough. He'll tell you a dwarf named Boot might know something about where to find the gold.\n\nNote: It is possible to mine and smith perfect jewellery without speaking to Boot; however, the player must speak to Boot to be able to give the jewellery to Avan.\n\nMake your way to Falador (alternatively, use a combat bracelet to teleport to the Edgeville Monastery, or a skills necklace to the Mining Guild) and go into Dwarven Mines. Once inside, go south-west (from the northern entrance) — see the map to the right. Boot should be wandering around down there, in the second alcove. Talk to him and ask him about perfect gold. He'll come up with a likely location. It's a small dungeon just between Ardougne and Witchaven. You've already been there if you've done the Slug Menace quest.\n\nTeleport or run to Ardougne. Run east of Ardougne, just outside of the wall next to Witchaven. Make sure to get your pickaxe, food and some gear, as there are a bunch of level 28 hobgoblins, level 53 ogres, and level 122 hellhounds that you'll have to either fight or avoid. It is possible to mine the 'perfect' gold ores without combat; however, you will probably be attacked. Protect from Melee will negate all damage, as the monsters only use melee.\n\nInside the cave, to the east will be a small caged area with several hellhounds inside, along with the gold rocks you need to mine. To the north and south are two rooms with levers in and outside of them. You'll have to do a little bit of a lever puzzle here to open the gate to the hellhounds. (If you have to return later on, you will not need to go through these steps to unlock the door again.)\n\nGo to the northern wall and pull the lever up.\n\nHead into the southern room and pull the lever up.\n\nGo back to the northern wall and pull the lever down.\n\nGo inside the northern room and pull the lever up.\n\nLeave the room and pull the lever on the northern wall up.\n\nGo back to the southern room and pull the lever down.\n\nThe hellhound room should now be unlocked.\n\nMine at least two 'perfect' gold ore and get out. Level 122 Hellhound near first rock on the right can be safespotted by hugging wall on your way in then attacking from behind stalagmite, then just mine that rock twice (If boosting and using this method, bring multiple boosts as the ore can take a while to respawn).\n\nNow, get your rubies, your ring mould, and your necklace mould and go to any furnace that's handy (perhaps using an amulet of glory to get to the one in Al Kharid). Smelt the ore into 'perfect' gold bars and then, ensuring you have selected \"Make 1\" (as you may end up making all of your gold bars into a ring or necklace, which would require you to return to mine more ore), use the resulting 'perfect' bars on the furnace again, selecting the usual ruby ring and ruby necklace options to make the 'perfect' ring and 'perfect' necklace (if you just make gold jewellery, they will not be 'perfect'). Once you have the items, head back to Al Kharid and give them to Avan. As a reward, he'll give you the second piece of the crest and will tell you how to find his brother.\n\nJohnathon[edit | edit source]\n\nItems needed: An antipoison potion, runes and Wizard's mind bomb/magic potion (if boosting). Combat equipment for the battle with Chronozon.\n\nItems recommended: An amulet of glory for quick access to the Edgeville Dungeon from Jolly Boar Inn.\n\nThe last brother is holed up on the 1st floor[UK]2nd floor[US] of the Jolly Boar Inn north-east of Varrock near the edge of the Wilderness. Bring your antipoison potion, and head up to the 1st floor[UK]2nd floor[US] where he is huddled in a room. Talk to him; he'll tell you he got bitten by a poisonous spider. Give him the antipoison (he'll take the entire potion, not one dose) and he'll be very grateful and be able to relay to you what happened. Apparently, he got cocky and decided he wanted to try to kill a powerful demon named Chronozon. The demon sent him away and in the process stole the last piece of the crest. If you want it back, you'll have to finish what Johnathon started.\n\nWarning: You will be heading into the Wilderness. The chaos druids are a popular player killing spot.\n\nChronozon can be found near the poison spiders, near the Earth obelisk in the Edgeville Dungeon.\n\nYou'll need to bring food, armour, an antipoison potion for the poison spiders, and enough runes to cast each elemental blast spell at least once. It will probably take more than one casting, especially if you're lower level, because if the spell just \"splashes\" on Chronozon, it doesn't count. You have to actually hit Chronozon with a Wind Blast, Water Blast, Earth Blast, and Fire Blast. When you hit him with all of those spells, it will weaken him and make him a little easier. Afterwards, he may be killed with any combat class.\n\nNote: When a cast of Wind Blast, Water Blast, Earth Blast, and Fire Blast is successful in weakening Chronozon, text will appear in the chatbox stating \"Chronozon weakens....\".\n\nIf you don't get all of the spells to successfully hit, though, he won't die. Also if you take too long to kill him his weakness will wear off and you'll have to weaken him again. When you finally do kill him, grab the crest piece and head out of there. It is also wise to take a one-click teleport, such as the Varrock teletab, to teleport out of the dungeon immediately following Chronozon's defeat.\n\nThe crest reassembled[edit | edit source]\n\nNow that you have all three crest pieces, put them together to make the Family Crest and then make your way back to Varrock. Give the crest to Dimintheis who will be very, very pleased to have it back.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nAfter completing the quest, it is recommended to talk to Dimintheis to start the Family Pest miniquest. When you go to one of the brothers to imbue the gauntlets, you'll have the chat option that completes 1/4th of the miniquest.\n\nRewards[edit | edit source]\n\n1 Quest point\n\nSteel gauntlets\n\nThe steel gauntlets offer useful perks. Each brother will imbue them with a special ability. They will initially do this for free. Be careful choosing, though, since you can only have one effect, and it will cost you 25,000 coins to change them. Dimintheis will provide you with a \"magically\" found pair should you lose them. Note: Although they are called \"steel\", players with 1 Defence can wear them.\n\nCooking gauntlets (Caleb): Reduces the chance of burning certain fish significantly: (lobsters, swordfish, monkfish, sharks and anglerfish.)\n\nGoldsmith gauntlets (Avan): Increases the Smithing experience from smelting gold by 150%, for a total of 250% - from 22.5 to 56.2.\n\nChaos gauntlets (Johnathon): Increases the damage done by bolt (chaos rune) spells by 3. Stacks multiplicatively with the Tome of Fire and Slayer helmet (i), the former having a moderate upkeep cost, for a maximum hit of 25, which is by far the highest damage per second for a beginner.\n\nAfter the Family Pest miniquest, you can own unlimited copies of all three gauntlets for a one-off payment of 500,000 coins.\n\nUnlocks:\n\nChronozon accessible in the Nightmare Zone.\n\nRequired for completing[edit | edit source]\n\nCompletion of Family Crest is required for the following:\n\nFamily Pest\n\nDefender of Varrock\n\nLegends' Quest\n\nElite Kandarin Diary\n\nTranscript[edit | edit source]"
