        "text": "Listen gang, the simple fact of the matter is I do relatively little promoting of this blog. The way I see it, much of what I cover is so niche that my best course of action is to just write about whatever strikes my fancy, and then it’ll be there when someone likeminded comes along, whenever that may be. Don’t get me wrong, I share some new updates on social media from time to time, or a post when a topic is germane to whatever online conversation I’ve currently found myself in, but by and large, I just type this stuff up and “let it ride.”\n\nWhich is why I’m always kinda surprised when my WordPress dashboard alerts me to a post being shared somewhere and the accompanying surge in views (which in turn makes me feel like a big man). I know I’ve got some followers; the dashboard tells me that too, but, I mean, it’s sorta gratifying to see that other, presumably random, people are stumbling upon this stuff.\n\nCase in point: just recently, views for my Double Dragon LCD handheld post went straight up bonkerz. Was it someone out there in innernet-land waxin’ nostalgic about them ubiquitous Tiger handhelds of the 1980s & 1990s? Not quite; it was a Reddit user looking for a graphic designer to create renders of that type of handheld game, and apparently the pictures in my article were good enough to use as an example. Okay, sure wasn’t expecting that! Pretty cool though!\n\nAnyway, today’s subject isn’t related to portable Tiger gamin’, but rather, another Reddit topic that popped up recently. Turns out I wasn’t the only one entranced by local television station The Cat WAOH-29/WAX-35 growing up; this early effort of mine, which has proven pretty popular over the years, got the share there and prompted a number of nostalgic recollections. It’s always a little bittersweet to me when that article makes the rounds; I don’t think it’s particularly well-written, and as such I’ve tried to steer people towards my later, better tribute to the station, but it’s that original that keeps continuously garnering the views, so my efforts have appeared to be in vain. At least none of the comments in that post dissed on me, which is something.\n\nGiven that, I wanted to do an old television broadcast review from the station again; the last one was from nearly four (!) years ago. I had a couple in mind, but what I really wanted to write about predated that Reddit topic – I just hadn’t gotten around to it because the box in which was housed was fairly hard to get to. Indeed, it wasn’t until the other day, when I had worked up the nerve to go searching for something else entirely, that I came across it and was like OH THAT’S RIGHT, and so here we are. (Ironically, I didn’t find the other thing I was looking for.)\n\nI have no exact date for this, but the tape it was on, this was recorded right after NBC’s June 29, 2008 rebroadcast of the first SNL (in tribute to George Carlin, who had recently passed away), and as such, I feel reasonably safe in assuming it hails from the summer of 2008, though I guess a lengthier period of time could have passed between the two. It’s from 2008 at any rate, and this is important to note because The Cat 35/29 as we/I knew it was, relatively speaking, in its waning days. Not quite literally; it lasted until some point in ’09, after which it became our local RetroTV affiliate, and while some of the local programming made the move and the channel remained the television arm of WNIR FM, it just wasn’t the same. As such, in the grand scheme of things, I had inadvertently captured something from the tail end of the local station that had been very, very important to me growing up.\n\n(By the way, probably about two years ago now, WNIR sold off what 35/29 had become and it no longer exists at all. I wanted to write about the occurrence but, uh, didn’t. There is an online channel that goes by WAOH and shares some of the same local sensibilities, however.)\n\nSo with all that said, I now present to you WAX-35/WAOH-29’s broadcast of the 1949 film noir classic D.O.A., from [maybe the summer of] 2008.\n\nNow, this was broadcast locally via 35/29, but just like the old days, some of the content was actually syndicated from America One, this movie included. (America One is gone now, too. It did eventually morph into Youtoo America, with some of the same movies still appearing until they didn’t, though it’s tough for me to say for sure since my cable doesn’t carry the channel anymore.)\n\nThis wasn’t quite the America One I had known some eight years prior, however. At heart it was still essentially the same, this was still a classic movie showcase, but gone were the Hollywood Classics graphics and Alan Stone host segments I had enjoyed so much before. (From 2000 to about 2006, we didn’t have cable and 35/29 didn’t come in via the antenna we used. As such, from 2000 until after it became our RetroTV affiliate, I only taped three things off 35/29: a 2001 airing of 1934’s The Tonto Kid at my grandma’s house, a 2006 airing of an episode of Meet Corliss Archer after we got cable back, and our subject today. Regarding that 2001 broadcast, even in the relatively short period of time since I had last watched, America One had changed quite a bit, graphics-wise, from what I had been used to. And Alan Stone seemed to be gone by then, as well.)\n\nAnyway, I had come for a classic movie, and (perhaps subconsciously) indulge in the sort of broadcast that garnered a high amount of interest on my part from 1997 to 2000, but what I ended up capturing was a small but, as far as I’m concerned, indispensable piece of local television broadcasting. And as it turned out, for the last time.\n\nFirst the movie, though.\n\nD.O.A. is a classic of the film noir genre. Certainly we’ve seen a few of these here at the blog (here and here and here are three examples), but from a pure genuinely good movie standpoint, I don’t know, it’s tough but D.O.A. just may be my favorite. (By the way, Wikipedia deems it a 1950 film, which is apparently when it wide-released, but according to IMDb, it first premiered in 1949, and since I’ve always known it as a ’49 film, that’s what I’ll continue to notate it as, mentally or otherwise, and you can’t stop me.)\n\nI’m going to say upfront that it’s a terrific movie, though the issue I’m running into is that I can only give a brief synopsis of the plot, lest I give away pertinent information that could ruin the film for first timers. But look, the movie is in the public domain, it’s all over on budget home video releases, and certainly online, so if you like film noir, I’ll tell you right away it’s get a big, big recommendation from yours truly. And as we all know, my recommendation is of the utmost importance.\n\nThe movie grabs you right off the bat, with one Frank Bigelow dramatically marching through police headquarters as the opening credits play, and never lets up. As the credits end, Bigelow speaks to the homicide detective in charge, telling him a murder has been committed. Who’s been killed? Bigelow. We’re then presented the events in flashback.\n\nFrank Bigelow is an accountant in Banning, CA who decides to take a quick vacation to San Francisco, much to the dismay of his secretary/girlfriend Paula – who Bigelow doesn’t want coming along. Paula isn’t particularly pleased but has little say in the matter.\n\nBigelow arrives in San Fran just in time for the end of “market week,” with traveling salesmen partying it up at his hotel. He ends up going to a club with a group of them for a night of music and drinking. It’s there that, while chatting up a music-loving, “jive crazy” chick (hmm, no wonder Frank didn’t want Paula coming along!), we see Bigelow’s drink covertly switched by a stranger.\n\nThe next morning, Frank isn’t feeling too hot, and while initially dismissing it as just too much partyin’, he decides to get a quick check-up. The first doctor he visits tells him the bad news, and the second opinion he gets confirms it: Frank Bigelow has been poisoned by “luminous toxin,” which has already been absorbed into his system and attacks the vital organs in a relatively fast manner. Without much time to live, Frank decides he’s going to figure out who killed him before he, uh, dies.\n\nAnd that’s what sets our story in motion; Frank Bigelow is a living dead man, basically the walking dead, and he’s going to solve is own murder – while learning, ironically too late, about the truly important things in life.\n\nSince we know the outcome from the onset, the movie can focus on the plot and pacing, and it does a wonderful job. Like I said, it grabs you from the very start; this is gripping stuff!\n\nThe movie also makes for an excellent snapshot of late-40s/early-50s Cali – and with that film noir sheen, to boot! Dark and shadowy in the best kind of way (though admittedly some of the darkness may be due to the 35/29 signal; this was a somewhat dark broadcast as a whole – and the print of the movie was pretty battered to start with, as well), there’s some memorable images in his one. At the nightclub where Bigelow is poisoned, quick, close-up shots of the band furiously playing mixed with Frank being jostled in the crowded bar, it gives much of the sequence a truly claustrophobic, feverish quality.\n\nFurthermore, I like when these oldies give us a peak into a different era, such as in the screencaps directly above, in which Frank is chased through a drugstore by a gun-wielding psychopath. Now, I have no idea if this was a set built for the movie or an actual drugstore they chose to shoot in (I’ve read that D.O.A. was a low budget film, so it may very well have been the latter), but either way, it’s an example of Americana that doesn’t really exist anymore. I find stuff like that just as fascinating in a film as I do the plot – sometimes even more so, if the movie is a baddy.\n\nBut luckily, D.O.A. isn’t a baddy, it’s a goody. But it’s just one aspect of the broadcast; the complete picture is only really seen when you factor in the commercial breaks. Those are what put this broadcast over the top. They offer an indispensable snapshot of local Northeast Ohio TV at the time. Okay, sure, maybe this all won’t be remembered by but a fairly small number of people, but as far as I’m concerned, that just makes this recording all the more important.\n\nWhen 35/29 ran movies, there were three types of commercial breaks. Most often they’d be a mix of locally-produced ads (both for other programming on the station as well as for local businesses) as well as national spots that bought ad time on the channel, as you’d expect. But at other times, the commercials would be all or nearly all national spots. Most rare of all were those broadcasts that consisted entirely of local advertising (I only have one of those specimens in my not-inconsiderable collection).\n\nIn the case of D.O.A. on that day in 2008, it was the first example above, BUT, because I have little to say about Hoveround’s wheelchairs or Billy Mays pitching Mighty Putty (or that ShamWow Vince guy; he was there, too), I’m going to focus solely on the local spots. And boy were there some good ones. Here now are my favorites of the bunch…\n\nAhhh, Handy Randy!\n\nHis was one of the few shows to survive the CAT-to-RetroTV transition, and lasted until at least 2012, maybe even a year or two later.\n\nAs I recall it, it was initially a live call-in show (there were no shortage of those on The CAT) related to, obviously, automotive maintenance, and then later turned into a pre-filmed, general car-related show.\n\nI’ve talked with Handy Randy before, and he was/is a terrific guy; even sent me his autograph! And remember the revived online WAOH I mentioned earlier in the article? I do believe there’s a new Handy Randy show on it!\n\nI’m a little bummed there were no promos for Son of Ghoul during this broadcast, but I can’t complain too much, because this minute-long spot for WNIR’s morning show is simply sublime. Set to a “good morning” song (that almost sounds like it’s being sung by voice of The CAT/WNIR Tom Cullison, though I’m not sure if it’s actually him) and featuring in-studio shots of the morning crew while also pitching the contests and prizes and general fun of the mornin’ show, it’s a wonderful bit that I couldn’t be happier to have saved.\n\nAbove: that’s the late, great Stan Piatt along with Steve French (more on him in a bit), plus an official WNIR mug, which, barring one exception (which I’ll get to) is really the closest thing I’ve seen to a piece of CAT memorabilia. How did people originally get it? Morning show prize, is my best guess.\n\nHere’s a fun little flashback: back in the CAT days, there was a heavy emphasis on locally-produced content, as I hope I’ve made clear by now. Commercials for local businesses, sure, but also actual TV shows.\n\nThis spot right here was a reminder that you, yes YOU, could have your own show on 35/29. ‘Course, I imagine you had to pony up some cash to make that happen, but still, 30 minutes or even an hour of local airtime could be yours! In retrospect, this is something I wish I had taken advantage of, but then, did I have the money and/or resources I do now to really make that happen? Maaaan I don’t know.\n\nSomething else I don’t know: how rigid The CAT’s screening process was. Maybe you could get on the air with whatever you wanted as long as you had the money and, you know, didn’t violate FCC rules. I do remember some fairly strange stuff occasionally making it on air. As I recall it, roughly around the time of this broadcast (maybe a year or two earlier) was some show in which a preacher (I guess), seated at the classic CAT set of desk with plain black backdrop, read print-outs of things he was convinced pointed to an imminent end of the world, all while his voice would occasionally raise into a shout at odd intervals. It was weird.\n\nAhhh, a real sign o’ the times!\n\nRemember the then-impending switch to all digital broadcasting? You know, if you were using an old school CRT TV and/or had no cable, you were gonna need a converter box, lest it all be rendered useless?\n\nWelp, The CAT was there to ensure that you got the right converter box, with this little reminder here. You best get one with analog pass-through, mama! In this age of streaming TV and whatnot (plus, our modern HDTVs have the right stuff built into ’em now; I’m not sure if that was the case with new TVs then), it all seems so quaint nowadays, but it was a big deal back then.\n\nUnless you had cable, that is, which we did. The CAT (and subsequent RetroTV affiliation) was available on cable line-ups…until 2017, when the 29 half of the station bit the dust and the channel was solely known as W16DO (the 35 portion was already gone, though it would eventually become 35 again, though not WAX). To get it, you absolutely needed to use an antenna and, if necessary, a converter box. In fact, it was in 2021 that I took my first steps back into that world since 2006 or thereabouts, simply so I could watch Son of Ghoul again, as well as…\n\n…Steve French Sports Talk!\n\nThere wasn’t much to the promo, it’s only a silent five seconds or so with quick clips of various sports, but the time slot remained the same until Steve, of WNIR morning show fame as previously noted, retired in 2022.\n\nSports Talk was pretty much the definitive “CAT show”: live, call-in, desk, black backdrop, and along with another weekly sports call-in show and Son of Ghoul, it was one of the final pieces of local programming before the station ended entirely. (Phil Ferguson took over for the final month or two after Steve retired, but the channel as a whole wasn’t long for the world by that point.)\n\nAnyway, 2021. The former-CAT would NOT come in with an indoor antenna; a real, heavy duty rooftop one was needed (fun fact: those old school antennas on your roofs are still usable, gang!). Once one was procured and installed, Monday evenings with Steve French were pretty much a prerequisite. Informative and dryly funny, Steve’s show was derned entertaining, and I loved calling in every week (I was quickly deemed “the non-cable guy,” and Steve seemed to get a kick out of the fact that I could actually see the show). Even though it’s only been a little over two years since French retired, I do indeed miss it. Call it early onset nostalgia or something along those lines.\n\nLook, just read more about Steve French Sports Talk here, when I talked about the end of the show and his retirement.\n\nThe CAT had a long history of hunting/fishing shows. The Hunting and Fishing Show with Vic was pitched endlessly during my earlier years with the station, and sometime between then and when I “came back,” The Buckeye Angler with Jack Kiser filled the void, though I’m not sure if there was any real connection between the shows, beyond the same genre, that is.\n\nAt any rate, I never watched either, though having grown up going fishin’ (heck, the last thing that could be constituted a date for me – it’s been awhile – was a fishing excursion), it had nothing to do with the content. Just not the sort of thing I watched/watch. As such, I can’t say much about the show, though if the promo is any indication, it looks like it was an on-location type deal.\n\nI do have one further recollection regarding The Buckeye Angler though, and it has to do with the CAT memorabilia, or lack thereof, that I mentioned earlier. At around the same general time as this broadcast, a local establishment (I can’t remember for sure which one) had flyers for the program laid out for customers to take. Usin’ mah noodle, I grabbed two, and still have them to this day. Boy am I glad I did!\n\nAnd finally, one of The CAT station I.D.s that appeared periodically throughout broadcasts over the years. In this case, it’s just a quick, silent shot of the Rock Hall (in earlier years, “Cleveland Rocks” and a Tom Cullison-provided voiceover would accompany shots of the area, and while there were none during this particular broadcast, such things may have still been present at the time). One thing is for sure, it definitely played into the strong local vibes the station presented every day at the time.\n\nActually, although the signal reached Cleveland and, obviously, the Cleveland connection was played up, I have to say, to watch The CAT you really got more of an insight into the Akron-Cuyahoga Falls-Stow-Kent communities than you did Cleveland. Being an Akronite, this was especially appealing to me; when I saw ads for businesses more in my immediate vicinity, sometimes so close I could (and did) walk to them, man, that was something other stations just didn’t always provide.\n\nIndeed, The CAT really felt like it was “ours,” in a way that the subsequent RetroTV affiliation just didn’t. You still get those vibes from WNIR itself, but from the TV side of things, it was a locally-produced collection of programming, coupled with select syndicated content, that just felt special. Maybe I didn’t always recognize that back then, but I sure do now. That homegrown, homemade feeling was an addition, not a detriment, and it scratched an itch that the bigger, network-affiliated local stations just didn’t, at least not as consistently, or as charmingly.\n\n2008, man, it doesn’t seem that far back, but as of this writing, that was 16 years ago. So much has changed, both in our entertainment/viewing habits, local or otherwise, as well as myself personally. Of course, I don’t always feel that way, and in some ways I’m not that different from what I was or where I’m at in life as I was at 22 years old in ’08. But in other ways, I long for that comparatively simpler time. Such is life though, and I suspect that’s the same for most people.\n\nIf nothing else, I’m glad I captured this small moment in local time. It’s a snapshot of our recent past that both feels like a million years away as well as relatively ‘modern’, if that makes any sense. It’s tough for me to explain. But hey, a good movie, coupled with undeniably powerful local content, I wasn’t aware of what this would eventually mean to me back then, but now? It’s an indispensable recording.\n\nToday, right now, there’s just no other way I’d rather watch D.O.A.\n\nOver the last year or so, I’ve found my childhood love for comic books reignited somethin’ fierce. Not that I ever stopped liking them, mind you, but for something that was one of my primary hobbies as a youngster, a long, long stretch went by where I would only pick issues up here and there, if they really struck my fancy. That has since flipped considerably, to heights previously unseen since my formative years. Actually, since I’ve got real money to goof around with now (even when I probably shouldn’t), I can and do exceed whatever constituted said previous heights. ‘Course, now collecting comes with the caveat of my general rule of thumb of “’94 and before,” which applies to pretty much anything I collect (though there are always exceptions), which wasn’t the case back in the day, since it was, uh, already before 1994.\n\nNowadays, stops at my longtime local comic shop are a regular thing again – and I always purchase something. And what’s double-cool is that this probably isn’t a bad investment, either; much of the 1960s and 1970s stuff I’ve been snapping up is still fairly affordable, but when you think about it, those comics are now over the 60 & 50 years (!) old marks – it’s not hard to imagine them going up even more in price as the years roll on. (Indeed, some of them are already pretty pricey online, though luckily the in-person buys at my local spot are, for the most part, still entirely reasonable, while still being fair to the proprietor – which makes sense, since the dude’s the one pricing them and he’s been doing this sort of thing for decades.)\n\nSome things never change though: my interests, as in superheroes of choice, are largely the same as they were back in the day. Namely, Superman, Batman and Spider-Man, in that order. Not that I wasn’t fond of others, I was and am, but those were the main guys for me. Said order was probably a little different during my earlier years; as I recall it, it was mostly Supes and Batguy battling for supremacy in my lil’ mind, but with the Tim Burton films, the Kenner toy lines and the animated series all coming at me full force, I’d say Bats probably got the ultimate nod back then. Today, I’m still a Batman Batfan, but when it comes to this sort of thing, I’m more of a Superman, uh, man.\n\nAdmittedly I’m more DC than Marvel, but I like Marvel, and Spidey, plenty. In fact, what we’re going to look at today, it’s something that had been on my mental want list for years, well before this full-fledged comic love resurgence, and it’s firmly Marvel/Spider-Man. (Also, I’m well aware that my tastes are considerably mainstream. I also don’t care. If preferring some ‘extreme’ underground comic inked by a homeless guy in an alley that only sold three copies would give me more street cred, well, I think I’m good with where I’m at.)\n\nDig this: it’s The Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game handheld! Put out by Bandai America way back in 1980 (a whopping 44 years ago as of this writing!), this may very well be the first electronic Spider-Man handheld ever released. Don’t quote me on that, I’m not positive, but I’ve certainly never seen an earlier one. I mean, there were handheld pinball and slide puzzle games beforehand, but as far as I know, there was nothing electric and/or electronic about those. Not unless you count the kinetic energy created by the sheer force of my slamming a slide puzzle against the wall, that is. (I’ll buy old slide puzzles as advertisement/promotional pieces, but the idea of actually playing with one is… not entrancing.)\n\nYes, I totally used a disposable plate as my background for these pics; hey, it was clean and clear and readily available. You call it silly; I call it ingenuity.\n\nLike I said, I’ve wanted one of these for quite some time; I’m not gonna bother linking to any of the posts, but longtime readers should know I love me some old handhelds. And this one has legitimate pop culture clout to boot! Cool winnins! So why did it take me so long to obtain one? Because, given its age, it tends to be relatively obscure, and when you factor in the licensed superhero aspect, sometimes pricey as well. And of course, since these things were primarily owned by kids and are now a thousand years old, condition, both cosmetic and functioning, also comes into play.\n\nFinally, one popped up with a price that didn’t make me turn to an imaginary camera and shed a single tear, and while I wasn’t quite sure if it was fully tested and working, the price was right enough that I decided to take a chance. Did I ultimately prevail? Read on! (Hint: I wasn’t unhappy. Not about this, anyway.)\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game is certainly electronic, but in practice, the best way I can describe it is as a battery-powered, handheld board game. The idea is to push the play button, which will set a red LED light in motion, eventually stopping on one of the spots on the board. It’s a real “two steps forward, one step back” kinda deal; you want to land on spots that’ll move you upward (“Leaps +4” and so on), but since there needs to be some kind of challenge, there are also spots that’ll move you backwards, or keep you in place. After each turn, you move your little Spidey-Guy token backwards or forwards (or no-wards) accordingly. It’s sort of like Press Your Luck, except after hitting the play button the game itself randomly picks what you land on.\n\nThe goal is for you, as Spider-Man DUH, to reach the top of the burning building and rescue J. Jonah Jameson. Of course, he’ll probably just find a way to blame Spidey for the whole mess, but no one ever said being a superhero was easy. Talk about a Whammy!\n\nHere’s a closer look at the controls at your disposal. There, uh, ain’t much – but then, you don’t really need much.\n\nAs you can see, there’s the expected on/off switch, the play button that sets everything in motion (naturally once the game is powered and on of course HAW HAW HAW), up top you’ve got your little Spider-Man levers that keep track of how far you’ve progressed up the building, and at the bottom, the scoring dials.\n\nThe scoring dials bring up an important point: you can play this by yourself, but it’s a sad, lonely, yet fast-moving, existence. I know this from experience; it’s not like I could get anyone over here to play this thing with me. (Aw shucks, I just gave away the answer as to whether the game works or not, didn’t I?) The Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game is really meant for two players, as the set-up on the game here, not to mention the old TV commercial for it (more on that in a bit), made abundantly clear. As a single player, there simply aren’t enough negative/neutral spots to land on to keep you from advancing up the building in short order. With two players though, I can see this all being competitive, albeit mildly\n\nHere’s the back of the game, providing handy instructions and a battery compartment for your required battery. See how that works?\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game demands one 9-volt battery of the user, which was a bit of an issue for yours truly, since I rarely have the need and/or use for a 9-volt battery. I did find one, but it was pretty old, and pretty much the opposite of a name brand. I’m not even sure why it was here, but I figured if it kept me from having to obtain a new 9-volt battery I’ll never ever use again, hey, I’ll give it a try.\n\nIn short, it didn’t work. Not really, anyway. It did power the game up, as far as giving me an LED to gawk at, but it wouldn’t actually play. This was undesirable, to say the least. FINE, guess I’ll be a responsible blogger and get a brand-new name brand battery to try my little Spider game out.\n\nLuckily, that did the trick. The game fired right up and allowed me to play. Victory is mine! There I was, playing The Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game, all by myself, on a disposable plate. You know, when I word it like that, my unwarranted ego sounds even more unwarranted.\n\nAs for the instructions, I’ve already given you the gist of the game, though I’m a little unclear on the “shots you’ve taken” part. Do they just mean turns? Or, like, punches, when a two-player game naturally devolved into fisticuffs? Spider-Man wouldn’t approve of that.\n\nOkay, let’s play!\n\nIt works! It works! I know I’ve already established that, but now you can see the bright red flashin’ LED, thus proving my honesty. Did you think I was laying? I wasn’t.\n\nThe revelation that this thing worked just fine was cause for celebration, so much so that I had to fight the urge to march around my neighborhood shouting “Spider-Guy! Spider-Guy! The amazincredible Spider-Guy! Yo man, that there’s the Spider-Guy!” whilst obnoxiously pumping my fists.\n\n(That’s how the song went, right?)\n\nAnyway, I was off to a good start! +1! Sure, I can do that!\n\nD’oh! Two steps back! Never before had I so truly known the sadness and heartache of Bruce Springsteen’s “One Step Up.” I’m not positive, but I think he just may have written that song after a fast, furious round of The Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game. I’ll be sure to ask him when/if I’m ever granted an interview.\n\nBy the way, did I mention this game is LOUD? It’s pretty loud. The game emits a high-pitched tone upon powering up and darting around the board, and when it lands on a spot, it doesn’t stop. Until you press play again, it just ‘sits’ there, driving your dog nuts. And guess what, plucky? Ain’t no way to turn the volume down, neither! Kids hoping to quietly sneak out of bed late at night to give this game a quick play without alerting their parents were in for a rude awakening! So were their parents, come to think of it.\n\nContinuous play saw my lil’ Spido-Mang steadily make his way towards to the top. Hold tight Jonah, I’m-a comin’! I wonder if his ever-present cigar is what caused the building to catch fire in the first place? He’d probably find a way to blame that on Spider-Man, too.\n\nYou know, for as simplistic as the game is, for the time, it really did give kids the option to ‘be’ Spider-Man. After all, you can only run around outside in a sad, homemade Spider-Man costume for so long before you start getting concerned looks from the neighbors. Do I know that from recent experience? I’m not tellin’!\n\nThat reminds me: one time I was in a thrift store, and some little kid was in the toy section. Evidently he had just found a Spider-Man mask (unless he wore his in, who knows), and at one point, I looked over, and he was standing completely silent and still, doing that web-slinging gesture at me. It was strange, and I can’t help but feel such shenanigans could have been avoided if he had had his own Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game to keep him occupied. Luckily, the tale now serves me well as filler this very moment.\n\nI did it! I did it! You’re safe, Jonah! I await your accolades! Hey, why are you calling the cops?\n\nI wasn’t jivin’ before; it didn’t take me very long to reach the top at all. You can play this by yourself, but since there’s really no way to lose, this pretty much has to be a two-player game. Otherwise, it’s all just kinda pointless. And loud.\n\nIt’s a pretty simple game, and obviously not much graphically, but given the time period, you couldn’t reasonably expect a whole lot more. LCD handhelds were just beginning to make the scene, namely with Nintendo’s Game & Watch titles, but LED was still the order of the day where this sort of thing was concerned.\n\nI will say this though, the game certainly looks cool. The bright shiny red LED, sure, but also just the molding and sticker and red-and-blue color scheme. It’s cosmetically attractive, is what I’m saying.\n\nBy the way, you may have noticed that I’ve referred to this as The Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game throughout, yet the sticker on the game merely calls it Spider-Man Rescue. So what’s the deal? Well, the sticker may say otherwise, but the packaging indeed identified this by the full title I’ve been going with.\n\nIn fact, so did the advertising. Not so much the comic book ad, which I can’t find a decent scan of to link to right now (it refers to J. Jonah Jameson as Spidey’s friend, which I hope was just them being sarcastic), but the television commercial certainly did. Here, see for yourself if you don’t believe me!\n\nIt was kind of a goofy spot, again noting Jameson simply as “friend” while a jingle + voiceover briefly gave the run down on how the thing operated. Like any good commercial, they made the game look a whole lot more exciting than it actually was, but then, it was a simpler time; maybe it was genuinely exciting back then?\n\nThe ad also made a point of showing two kids (see, told you it’s ideally two-player!) battling for Spider-Man supremacy, before one raises his arms enthusiastically and then starts annoyingly doing victory clasps while his (now former?) friend exaggeratedly displays his crushing defeat. It’s the kind of behavior that could potentially result in punches being thrown in real life, but like I said, it was a simpler time; maybe this was how kids genuinely reacted back then?\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game is a neat artifact on several fronts. As a piece of comic book/superhero paraphernalia, as a handheld video game (well, maybe not technically the video part…), even just as an example of late-70s/early-80s kid-based pop culture in general. I’m not sure how well it has held up gameplay-wise, but then, I was playing by my lonesome; maybe some good-natured trash talk whilst playing against a buddy would change my perception. Or maybe you had to be 10 years old in 1980 to get the most out of this, I dunno. At any rate, I’m certainly happy to have finally obtained this one after too many years of wanting it. I like it!\n\nBy the way, if you’re a Marvel fan but Spider-Man isn’t your cup o’ tea, there was also an Incredible Hulk-branded version! I don’t have it, but apparently it plays exactly the same; only the stickers and color scheme are different. Maybe I’ll go after that one at some point. Provided I can find it cheap enough, that is.\n\nFor the time being, I’m just wondering how long it’d take me to get kicked out of the comic shop by loudly playing this in there, whilst standing in everybody’s way and not buying anything. Worth a try? Maybe if I was dressed up as Spider-Man while doing so?\n\nNahhhhhh….\n\nOh buddy does it feel good to check this one off my bizarre mental want list of VHS tapes that I’ve decided I inexplicably need. Lemme explain…\n\nCertainly you’re aware of the long-running affinity I, and by extension my stupid blog, have for the cheap, cheesy, endlessly endearing Al “Grampa” Lewis-hosted horror & sci-fi movie videotapes of 1988. Put out by Amvest/Vintage Video, I’ve written about them numerous times; here’s but one. Well, when my interest in those began in earnest back in, man, 2015 I think, my research led me to the earlier tapes put out by the company. More than just horror and science fiction, Vintage Video’s offerings covered most of the cinematic bases, albeit not all that differently from other budget video outfits of the time. We’re talking (primarily) public domain stuff here, gang. Anyone with a familiarity of classic movies and what has subsequently lapsed into the oftentimes-murky arena of the public domain can probably envision what I’m talking about here.\n\nIndeed, the Vintage Video output of the mid-1980s didn’t differ significantly from, say, what Goodtimes was releasing around the same time (though that changed as the 1980s progressed and Goodtimes started getting more licenses for ‘real stuff’). And yet, because of my interest in the Al Lewis tapes, I gained a fondness for the company’s output as a whole. It doesn’t hurt that, again in comparison to Goodtimes, the Vintage Video stuff tends to be much more obscure, and as such naturally turns up much less frequently online. Even the ones that are (relatively) plentiful are still found in smaller numbers than other budget releases of the same title from that era. (I’ve written about some of these Vintage Video releases before, too; here’s but one.)\n\nI promise you I’m going somewhere with this. When I began researching these tapes so many years ago, I stumbled upon this entry at VHSCollector.com. 1947’s The Red House, as released by Vintage Video in 1985. I wasn’t at all familiar with the movie, but I was entranced by that cover – particularly that ghostly green illustration of Edward G. Robinson’s head looming over the proceedings. Despite the movie being in the noir vein, this leant the artwork a spooky, horror-ish element. As it turned out, this was entirely appropriate – though I wouldn’t know that firsthand for years. I never watched the movie until just this very morning!\n\nLike I said, these releases tend to be obscure. How many copies have I come across since first stumbling upon that online entry? Exactly one, and it’s what you’re seeing right here. If any others showed up in between, they totally eluded me. Ultimately though, victory was mine, and that victory is our subject today. I haven’t exactly been keeping this in my back pocket either; it popped up online at the end of April, I duly bought it, found time to finally watch the flick, and so here we are. Fortunately, the tape was fairly inexpensive, especially considering it’s also apparently pretty rare. (Look, these VV tapes may be obscure, but in my experience, they’re still not particularly valuable.)\n\nBut why wait so many years to watch and review the movie via this specific release? The film has long been delightfully public domain; I could have watched it free ‘n legal online without qualms or picked up one of the many other budget VHS (or DVD) releases to spotlight here. I may even already have one of those other budget releases tucked away somewhere. So why was this VV one so, so important? I could tell you it was about the thrill of the hunt, or that my reviews for these tapes tend to do well views-wise, and there’s some truth to both of those statement, but when it comes right down to it, it really just boils down to what I alluded to in my intro: I’m needlessly arbitrary.\n\nI have little else to say about the cover. See it? it’s cool. Big green Eddie G. Original poster artwork, flanked by the VV banner. Most (but not all) of these VV releases followed the same template. That VHSCollector link has a scan of the back cover if you’re so inclined. Let’s talk about the movie proper now, okay?\n\nFrom reading reviews online, it seemed that The Red House, while technically a film noir, had definite elements of a legitimate horror movie. I’m happy to say that that’s entirely true. There are a few implications of the supernatural, but much of this flick plays out more along the lines of a psychological horror film, not unlike Invisible Ghost, which we’ve talked about before (and via Amvest/Vintage Video, no less!). Of course, The Red House is better budgeted and far more professional (that’s to say, not as delightfully stupid), but my point is, the elements of horror here are, like that film, more “earth based,” if that makes any sense.\n\nThe plot: things start sunnily enough, when high schooler Meg Morgan brings chum Nath Storm to her adoptive parents’ house for a job. Brother and sister Pete and Ellen have a farm that, due to Pete’s disability (dude’s got a wooden leg!) has fallen a little behind in its upkeep. Nath gets the job and sets to work. Afterwards, he sits down to dinner with the Morgans before heading for home, and that’s where a sense of foreboding sets in. Nath lets it slip that there’s gossip about the Morgans around town, both due to their reclusive nature and their mysterious adoption of Meg when she was just two years old. The tension is momentarily alleviated when it’s explained that Meg was left in their care when her parents went out of town to look for work, only to be tragically killed, hence the (entirely legal) adoption. And as for the reclusiveness? Why, they’re just self-sufficient on the farm, and as such have little need to venture into town.\n\nThat out of the way, Nath starts to head home, but with a massive windstorm afoot, he mentions he’ll cut through the woods on the Morgan’s property to save time. That’s when the tension comes back; Pete is insistent that the woods are dangerous and that Nath would be well-advised to take the long way home. Even threats of mysterious, unending screams emanating from the woods do little to dissuade Nath, who decides to go through them anyway. What a tough guy. Whether it’s just the storm or something…else, Nath hears the screams and eventually runs back to the Morgan place to spend the night. What a wimp.\n\nBut, the allure of the woods, and a mysterious red house hidden somewhere in them, won’t go away. As Meg and Nath become increasingly obsessed with finding out what exactly is out there, Pete also becomes increasingly obsessed with keeping it a secret. What is the secret of the red house, and why does Pete become steadily more unhinged, even violent, in protecting it?\n\nThe cast of The Red House is excellent all-around. Edward G. Robinson is of course the headliner as Pete Morgan, and his portrayal of a character who is, at first, kindly enough but clearly hiding something and then growing progressively kookier as the film goes on is simply terrific. Judith Anderson is his put-upon sister who shares his secret, while Allene Roberts (in her first movie) as Meg and Lon McCallister as Nath are the young protagonists. Rounding out the main cast are a pre-jazz and even pre’er-Emergency! Julie London as Nath’s trashy girlfriend Tibby and Rory Calhoun as Teller, a skeezy handyman that Pete has enlisted to keep trespassers out of the woods. There’s not a dud in the bunch.\n\nAs I said before, while technically a film noir, there are enough horror elements in The Red House to where it could safely run on a horror hosted program or even, more fittingly in this instance, as part of the Grampa series. (No, it wasn’t listed as part of that line-up.) Certainly the usage of shadows and impending sense of doom fit into the realm of noir, but the stormy, screaming forest in the film, the mention of a curse being on it, the mystery of the red house, Pete’s decreasing grasp on reality as the film progresses, it totally all works as horror. Psychological horror, certainly, but horror nonetheless. There are even hints of the supernatural when on a few occasions Pete seems to know something has happened without being told beforehand, though the idea goes no further than implication (and could certainly be explained away).\n\nI don’t know, there’s just a spooky aura hanging over the whole thing, okay?\n\nPart of the fun of these Vintage Video releases is seeing just what kind of print they managed to acquire. Very often, they could be quite wasted, not an uncommon thing for budget videotapes of the era, but even more so in VV’s case; some of these could be fairly unique in their own right. In The Red House‘s case, the print itself isn’t horrible, I guess; sure there’s dust and debris and whatnot, but it’s more “mediocre” than “dragged around the parking lot 14 times.”\n\nHowever, for a good portion of the movie, it’s not so much black & white as it is, for lack of a better descriptive term, monochromatic. Hopefully you can tell what I mean from the screencaps; it’s almost like tinting, tinting that fluctuates somewhat as the film goes on, though of course that’s not what it actually was. You used to see this on old television broadcasts back in the day, where a B&W movie would start and/or come back from commercials, it would be in this monochrome (or whatever it is), and then someone would, again for lack of a better descriptive term, “flip the switch” to straight B&W. Here, a good chunk of the movie has passed before that happens. There’s probably technical terms for all of this, but I don’t know what they’d be, or even what to search for them under. Still, if nothing else, it’s an added level of interest to this particular release of the film.\n\nA more distressing aspect of the release is the duplication of the tape itself. At least on my copy, it…wasn’t great. It looks like it’s a generation or two removed from a source that probably wasn’t exactly pristine to begin with. It looks awfully dupey, to the point that it almost felt like I was watching a bootleg, even though I knew I wasn’t. (Can you even bootleg a public domain movie?) This of course was not unheard of with VV, and indeed, I chalk it up to whatever constituted their master tape, but it really does look and seem like this was an old school VCR-to-VCR copy.\n\nOh, and the running time. Both the sleeve and pretty much every source I’ve seen online says this is a 100 minute movie, but this copy here only runs 95 minutes. Are people just rounding up, or am I missing something? Boy, I hope I didn’t miss out on an inexplicable Edward G. Robinson music number!\n\nSo, all that said, was The Red House, as presented by Vintage Video nearly 40 (!) years ago as of this writing, worth the several-years-long wait on my part? I’d say it was. Okay, sure, the quality of the tape isn’t very good; even back then there were almost certainly better budget copies to be had. Nevertheless, the movie itself is very, very good. I did indeed find myself engrossed in this one. It’s not a perfect film; you begin to figure out what the secret of the red house is before the movie actually gets there, but until it got to that point, it certainly kept me wondering what the big reveal would be. This is a case where I made a point of not reading a full synopsis of the movie beforehand, and I’m glad I did, or, erm, didn’t. As such, I’ve tried to not divulge too much in this article, lest I ruin it for someone.\n\nI really liked this flick, enough so that I would (and probably should) get a nice, or at least nicer, release. The muddy, dupey picture quality of this particular release, The Red House deserves better. (Boy, I guess there is a downside to reviewing movies via thousand-year-old obsolete formats! Go figure!)\n\nOne final compliment: when I watched the film this morning, it was already a bright, beautiful, sunny day out. Now generally, I tend to avoid watching movies in the daytime, much preferring them as nighttime endeavors. I just don’t like matinees! And I especially don’t like watching movies on pleasant days such as this one. (Overcast, or better yet, thunderstormy days are notable exceptions to this ridiculous rule of mine.) It didn’t matter though; I got sucked into The Red House enough that I didn’t even care.\n\nFor the past several years, there have been three of these 1985 Vintage Video releases that I’ve been after; this one, another that’s seemed rare but not as rare, and one that was, to my point of view, just as hard to find as The Red House here. Over the past year or so, I’ve managed to check all three off my mental want list. And of those three, the release we’ve looked at today was the only one I was most genuinely interested in watching. Terrible picture quality or not, I’m glad it was worth the wait!\n\nYes I’m still here, gang. Now, I could say that I wanted to leave my last post up at the top of the main page for as long as possible because it was a Leap Day special, and maybe there is, or was, a little truth to that. But, the more honest reason for the delay is that I’ve just been so busy with work, I’ve had relatively little time to tax the brain cells dedicated to writing, and when I do have time, all I really want to do is lie down and listen to the radio or watch whatever local professional sporting event happens to be, erm, happening. (I’m so glad baseball season is upon us once again.)\n\nFurthermore, despite having almost unlimited things to write about (I got a lot of junk stuff), I simply couldn’t think of anything that got the creative juices flowing enough to render me typin’. No jive, this latest update was very nearly a look at the Atari 8-bit computer version of Superman: The Strategy Game; I even had pictures and a large chunk of the article already down before I decided I had lost interest. (Not in the game or computer, just in the babbling about it.)\n\nStill, I wanted to get something up before too much time had passed, lest whatever readers I happened to retain started getting antsy. I needed to dig something out that would make for a quick ‘n easy stop-gap post; something I could snap a single picture of, ramble about for a bit, and then go on my merry way.\n\nIn the end, it came down to either a Simpsons air freshener from 1990, or our subject today. Did I make the right decision? Who cares, it’s a new update!\n\nRemember the super neat Ken Maynard Lucky Larkin glass movie slide post? Of course you don’t; here, take the link. Well, we’re entering that arena once again, but this time, it’s not related to an antiquated (and possibly lost) sagebrush saga, but rather, some golden age horror/science fiction. Dig this:\n\nOh this is the stuff right here. I’m a sucker for vintage memorabilia from the horror and/or sci-fi genres, though since I’m far from the only one, it tends to be highly sought after (read: more expensive), and as such, I don’t add things like this to the collection as often as I’d like. Still, when this one crossed my path online, already affordable and then I received a discounted offer on top of it, well, I could only resist for so long.\n\nQuick refresher: glass movie slides were quite literally advertisements projected on theater screens back in the day. They could be for local businesses or products, or, as we have here, pitches for other movies showing or to be shown at the respective theater. In this case, we have one for 1940’s Dr. Cyclops, and what’s more, it’s from England! Who knows how many of these could still exist or what my odds of coming across another are, but I’m guessing the number has to be pretty low in either case.\n\nI bought this last year (from a seller in Jersey; go figure!), and as I recall it, I hesitated some before finally deciding to spend money that I shouldn’t. The reasons are, or were, twofold: 1) It’s not exactly a graphical feast. There is, as you can see, a nice old timey look to the slide, but it lacks the fantastic artwork that can really make these things ‘pop’ even in this day and age (go back and look at Lucky Larkin if you don’t believe me). Sidenote: they spelled “Janice” wrong. 2) Despite a love for vintage horror and sci-fi in general, where Dr. Cyclops in particular is concerned, to be totally frank, it has never been one of my favorites. Still, the various other factors related to the slide won me over in the end, and even if I don’t really care about the movie, I’ve also never really regretted buying it. Plus, who cares, it’s a new update!\n\nDr. Cyclops regards a crazy scientist stationed deep in the jungle who has developed the ability to shrink stuff. He shrinks a bunch of visiting biologists who, understandably, balk at being miniaturized and thus decide to defeat the mad doc and return themselves to their normative dimensions. Or something along those lines; like I said, it’s never been a favorite of mine. Look, just read about it, okay?\n\nAnyway, the slide itself. First off, there was just no good way to get a picture of it; the glass that houses it is apparently the most reflective in the known universe. As such, please enjoy my hand’s cute reflection in it. (Seriously, this was the best I could do. But who cares, it’s a new update!) Also, note the label at the very top; I know it’s a bit hard to see (I briefly considered taking a picture specifically of it, until like Atari 8-bit Superman, the notion got nixed). It reads “HERBERT BAKER” and underneath “THAXTED (Dunmow) ESSEX” though what precisely that refers to, I’m not sure. It could have been the distributor of the slide, or perhaps the proprietor of the theater that ultimately projected it. The latter would be cooler than the former. ‘Course, it could just be the labeling of a very proud former owner of the slide, I dunno.\n\nThaxted is a town in Essex, and Dunmow was, near as I can tell, a railway station there that now no longer exists. I still don’t know how all that relates to the slide, though.\n\nOne more thing: 1940 was the year Dr. Cyclops, an American picture, premiered in, say it with me, America. (The United States, I mean; savvy?) But, that doesn’t necessarily mean that’s when this slide hails from. It could have debuted in England later, or possibly even be from a later re-release either way. I’m not sure there’s any way to definitively know. Also, keep in mind 1940 was World War II time, even though the U.S. hadn’t officially entered it yet. How that impacted the release of an imported sci-fi movie to Britain, I do not know. I imagine they probably had bigger things on their collective mind. Even IMDb doesn’t reveal the pertinent information.\n\nSo, you now know about as much as I do about this slide, which is admittedly relatively little. There’s a real possibility someone out there knows way more than I do about it. Nevertheless, it’s vintage horror/sci-fi, it’s a piece of cinematic history, it’s (probably) fairly rare, and, last but not least, it’s cause for a new update. What more could you possibly want in a post?\n\nSee y’all the next time I feel like typing stuff!\n\nHalloween? Why yes, it is indeed Halloween today! Happy Halloween!\n\nFor this update, I’ve got something that, on the surface, doesn’t appear overtly Halloweeny. And I guess as a whole it really isn’t. BUT, it’s related to an event that took place 31 (!!!) years ago this very day, so as far as I’m concerned, it counts. Plus, it’s just what I feel like writing about right now, and that’s a pretty big factor, too.\n\nDig this:\n\nYour eyes ain’t deceivin’ you; that’s a ticket stub from Bruce Springsteen’s Halloween night concert in Minneapolis, all the way back in 1992! Cool winnins? I sure think it is!\n\nYou know, I haven’t talked a whole lot about Bruce on this blog; the most notable occurrence was, wow, just over 10 years ago as of this writing, when I babbled about the neato Springsteen carnival mirror I found. Don’t let the lack of coverage on my dumb website mislead you though; Springsteen is my all-time favorite musical artist. His music has meant more to me than anyone else’s, with four (on some days, five) of his albums finding themselves on my personal top ten favorite albums list. Does that hurt the variety of the list? Maybe. Do I care? Not in the least. Hey, it’s my list!\n\nSo much of his output has been the soundtrack of my life. And even beyond the albums (I’ve got ’em all), collecting Springsteen memorabilia (I’ve got a lot), not to mention seeing him in concert when possible (right now, I’m up to seven shows, which is nothing compared to some Boss fans, I know, but that’s still six more times than anyone else I’ve seen live), it’s all been a big part of what makes me, well, me.\n\nOn the memorabilia front, I’ve been on a bit of a ticket stub kick lately. Mostly I stick to stubs from shows that were local to me; you know, Northeast Ohio. Not always though – sometimes it depends on the tour and/or venue and/or price. In the case of this ticket stub here, it doesn’t represent one of his generally more-celebrated eras (more on that in just a bit), but the date, the date, I bought this stub specifically because of that. And, to be totally frank, because I could get a Halloween day post out of it.\n\nGraphically, okay, sure, there’s nothing too eye-popping about it; it looks like so many other Ticketmaster-issued tickets from that era. It contains all the pertinent required information: price, seating, the, uh, artist you’re entitled to see with said ticket, and so on and so forth. It’s been awhile since Bruce tickets were only $26! (The inflation calculator I just found says that would be $57.04 in today’s dollars, which is still a heckuva deal.) I’m not familiar with the seating of that venue, then or now, but section 116 sounds like it wasn’t bad, I guess? Maaaaan, I don’t know. You were in the door and guaranteed to see, as far as I’m concerned, the greatest live performer of all-time; closer is always better, but just being there is the really important thing here, in my eyes.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, ticket stubs from that 1992-1993 tour aren’t particularly pricey or sought-after. I’d imagine there are exceptions, but when an auction for a stub from one of his Nassau shows on that tour keeps ending and being relisted without bids for only $2 + free shipping (I eventually wound up winning it – unopposed – cause dude, it’s Bruce and it’s over 30 years old and it was two bucks plus free shipping), you gotta figure there are higher priorities in the Springsteen collecting world. (Which, of course, there are; lookin’ at you, script cover Born to Run!)\n\nWhy the (relative) disinterest? First and foremost, I’d guess it’s because for an artist of Bruce’s age, not to mention his general fandom’s age, a ticket from 1992/1993 probably isn’t considered golden era. Which, hey, it isn’t; for that you’d want something extending from somewhere in the 1970s to somewhere in the 1980s – though where that exactly that starts and ends is up to the individual. (Personally I’d go 1975-1981, with the absolute peak being 1978-1981, but that’s just me.)\n\nBut disregarding that aspect, that 1992-1993 tour followed the late-80s dissolution of the beloved E Street Band; for 1992-1993, Springsteen toured with an (almost) entirely new group (universally known as “The Other Band,” though they weren’t officially called that – or anything, actually). And that followed two simultaneously-released albums that weren’t always highly-regarded, something made even more glaring when you consider Springsteen was pretty much batting .1000 previously. Rightly or wrongly, the era isn’t always recalled fondly.\n\nI don’t agree with that viewpoint. Okay, I was alive then, but far too young to be familiar with Bruce Springsteen’s music in any meaningful sense, let alone going to see him in concert. Had I grown up listening to/seeing him prior, who knows. But looking back now, I’m actually fond of early-90s Bruce. The albums, Human Touch and Lucky Town, I really think are better than they aren’t. (Lucky Town, barring some cringey lyrics in “Leap of Faith,” I think is overwhelmingly strong, and Human Touch, had it been pruned of two, three, or maybe even four of its weaker tracks, I think it’d be more widely-accepted as well.)\n\nAnd the tour that supported them (and which this ticket stub is from)? I think it’s pretty derned good. Not his best, mind you, but those shows could be pretty terrific in their own right. They were rock concerts, but there was often a more soulful, Gospel-esque sound to the songs, though at other times, the band bordered on metal, so heavy was the rockin’. Sounds like a strange mix, I know, but in my opinion, Bruce made it work. (I consider the renditions of “Light of Day” from this tour to be definitive, by the way.)\n\nOh, Halloween. That’s right, this is a Halloween post. For that October 31, 1992 concert, according to phenomenal fan resource Brucebase, the set was pretty typical for the era, but the show opened with oldie-but-goodie “Spirit in the Night” (a video online shows Bruce lyrically modified it slightly to better reflect Halloween), but even more appropriately, Professor Roy Bittan played Bach’s “Toccata and Fugue in D Minor” as an introduction. Pretty cool, and definitely Halloween-appropriate!\n\nThere were Springsteen concerts performed on October 31 prior that had stronger Halloween feelings to them (1984 is a good example; 1980 is an even better one), but really, 1992-1993 tour or not, super strong Halloween vibes or not, could there be a better Halloween party to attend than a Springsteen concert? I submit that there is/was not. Your mileage may vary, of course.\n\nAnd with that, this brief, but hopefully fitting, Halloween post comes to a close. Was it what you were expecting from me today? Almost certainly not. But hey, I gotta go with my gut sometimes, and even if I threw you a curve ball with this one, hopefully you liked it.\n\nHave a happy, safe Halloween, gang!\n\nOoooh, I haven’t posted since August; whoops! My bad! Time to rectify that, cause it’s October, and that means Halloween is a’comin’, and that means cheesy horror movies. And boy do I have a cheesy flick for us today! Two of ’em, actually.\n\nDig this: from the primordial days of home video, we have a Hollywood Home Theatre release! From 1980! 1980! As of this writing, a whopping 43 years ago! Because they came so early in the home video era (VHS had only been around for three years at that point, and was still a few away from well and truly taking off in a mainstream sense), these Hollywood Home Theatre tapes tend to be pretty rare; for example, it took me years to nab a copy of their Metropolis release. What happened was I ordered one for sale online, and then waited…and waited…and waited. Evidently it had already sold in the seller’s brick-and-mortar store, so a refund was issued, and then I waited even longer (WAY longer. SEVERAL YEARS longer) for another to show up. When one did, I naturally bought it, and while my hopes of a Channing Pollock edit were dashed upon arrival (it turned out to be more or less the same print as what we looked at a thousand years ago here), at least I finally had it.\n\nIndeed, they may be tough finds nowadays (and even back then?), but there were plenty of titles to their credit. In fact, several months back, I kept watching (and unwatching) an auction with a bunch of old western movie VHS tapes. Most of them I didn’t care about, but there were three of these HHT tapes, each featuring multiple b-westerns per, and that’s what kept my ears figuratively perked. I didn’t technically need most of the films presented (and the ones I didn’t, to the best of my recollection, already have, I also didn’t really want), but the rarity of the tapes themselves still kept my interest level higher than it might otherwise have been. Eventually the lot sold to someone not named me, but I wasn’t too disappointed – after all, I still had this tape in my arsenal.\n\nI’m just surmisin’ here, but as with other VHS tapes that still hold some value in this day and age, I imagine the horror and sci-fi HHT releases tend to garner the most attention. At least they do in my case. As such, when this “Aztec Mummy Double Feature” release popped up for really cheap, and I had never seen it before (or since), I jumped on it. Funny thing was, I never even had much interest in these films prior, but cornball old horror movies on rare VHS releases for really good prices, hey, that’s always gonna get my attention. In this case, I didn’t even hesitate when it came to hitting the “spend money on this” button. I probably should learn to hesitate more when it comes to that button, but this time around, I’m glad I didn’t!\n\nPresented via an annoyingly uncentered sticker on the front sleeve, the movies that make up our double feature are The Curse of the Aztec Mummy and The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy, which are actually movies #2 and #3 of a late 1950s horror trilogy from Mexico. Beginning with 1957’s The Aztec Mummy, these were all filmed back-to-back-to-back. While that first film seemed to ultimately get some kind of butchered release in the U.S., the second and third parts were imported here in the early-60s by K. Gordon Murray, who specialized in this sort of thing, and it’s those Murray products we have here. (It appears Murray never tackled the first installment.)\n\nThere was also a 1960s effort titled The Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Mummy, but near as I can tell, it’s not actually part of this series.\n\nFor my part, I tend to run hot and cold on these K. Gordon Murray imports. My interest in this sort of thing was higher in my early, early horror & sci-fi fandom (when I was around 11, 12 years old) but has since eroded precipitously. For example, I’ve never much cared for the bizarre 1959 Santa Claus he brought here (instead, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians has traditionally been my silly Christmas movie of choice), but his World of the Vampires was something that peaked my interest back then but doesn’t really now. (A revisit probably is in order, however.)\n\nOn the other hand, I saw The Brainiac for the first time a little over 10 years ago, and quite unexpectedly on my part, absolutely loved it. As such, I was hoping the two movies on this tape would fall more towards that end of this particular spectrum. Did they? Read on!\n\nActually, before we get to that, let’s take a quick look at the back of this sleeve. I didn’t really intend on including this, because these HHT sleeves are mostly generic from release to release. (I say mostly, because while you’d think they’re all uniform aside from the sticker on the front, the appropriate titles are printed on the sides. So why the sticker at all? A savings in cost is my best guess.)\n\nAnyway, generic sleeves weren’t really uncommon in the early days of home video, especially where the backs were concerned. A good part of the time, these included a standard pitch (like what you’re seeing here) or a listing of other releases, some copyright info, and little else. It took a bit for manufacturers to realize, hey, we could be utilizing the back sleeves to, you know, really sell the movie proper.\n\nAlso, I just noticed it’s spelled “theater” on the back here, but “theatre” everywhere else. This discrepancy mildly disconcerts me, especially since I’m going against my every natural instinct and going with the “theatre” spelling in this article. It feels wrong. It feels dirty.\n\nOh alright, I’m gonna come clean: the real reason I’m bothering with the back of the sleeve is the old Blockbuster sticker still affixed to it. Forget the era the sticker alone evokes; I’m just amazed a tape of this nature could survive at a Blockbuster as late as May 24, 1994! Want an added bit of age-related depression? As of this writing, we’re coming up on the 30th anniversary of that date. No, that doesn’t make me feel good either. I think we need to wrap ourselves in some nonsensical silliness now.\n\nI was passingly familiar with The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy beforehand (more on that aspect momentarily), but The Curse of the Aztec Mummy was the more new-to-me flick here. Online reviews made it sound like it would be sufficiently goofy for me – and it was.\n\n(WARNING: some spoilers are ahead, as if anyone cares.)\n\nThe plot evidently picks up immediately after the first entry, which is odd since it seems that flick, in a butchered English translation at least, hadn’t even been released in the U.S. yet. A flashback at one point fills that part in: previously one Dr. Almada hypnotized his fiancée Flor in order to recall her past life as an Aztec maiden (a plot element obviously inspired by the Bridey Murphy craze of the 1950s; U.S. filmgoers had already gotten homegrown cinematic efforts in the horror vein with fare such as The She-Creature and The Undead, flicks that dealt with past life regression or some gobbledygook like that). It seems that the former-Flor had defied Aztec law and fallen in love with a warrior, which resulted in her being put to death and the warrior being given an eternal sentence as undead guard of an Aztec breastplate and bracelet. (That’s our titular mummy!)\n\nApparently the first Aztec Mummy was a big fat rip-off of Universal’s 1932 The Mummy, with the Egyptians being replaced by the Aztecs. Wanna know a secret? Despite being a classic horror and sci-fi lover, I’ve never much cared for the Universal Mummy films. Even the highly-regarded original has never been of much interest to me. I recall kinda enjoying one of the later b-movie entries in the series, but without doing a bit of (admittedly minimal) legwork, I couldn’t even tell you offhand which one that was. I guess I could go look, but that seems like an awful lot of trouble for an article only 7 people will ever actually read.\n\nAnyway, as Curse opens, villain of the first film Dr. Krupp (alias “The Bat” for some reason) is in police custody (his interrogation seems almost entirely too informal and nonchalant, but then, I’ve been watching a lot of Miami Vice lately so maybe my perception is just skewed. I do wish Tubbs was here to yell at him, though). Krupp is, in almost comically short-order, rescued by his underlings, and seemingly undeterred by the events of the first film, continues on his quest to retrieve the breastplate and bracelet. It seems deciphering the hieroglyphics on them will lead to an ancient Aztec treasure. I guess the probability of making an undead mummy with superhuman strength really, really mad by doing this isn’t something he considers a big issue.\n\nThis may all sound like pretty standard cheapie horror flick material, but what drives Curse is just how unrelentingly nutty it is. This is some cheap, goofy stuff, and I consider that most definitely a good thing. For instance, as Krupp’s gang is breaking him out of police custody (the cops shake clearly non-firing machine guns at them while sound effects tell us, yes, they are indeed firing bullets and how dare you think otherwise), who should arrive to attempt saving the day? A masked superhero called “The Angel.” Think of a lucha libre, though I’m not sure he’s technically a wrestler. Nevertheless, the scene with Angel matter-of-factly driving down the road to intercept the baddies is wonderful, and his ineffectiveness at doing so gives me some real Prince of Space vibes. Angel is pretty useless for the most part, but his random presence gives this movie just the over-the-top factor it needs.\n\nSome of the prevailing nuttiness of Curse is there naturally, while some of it is a result of the insipid dubbing. For example: Angel is promptly overpowered by henchmen, and while he’s on the ground unconscious, Krupp stops one of his underlings from shooting Angel dead. Krupp then clarifies that he wants Angel dead, but he wants to kill him in his own special way. They then leave him on the ground, get in the car and drive away! Ignoring the fact the baddies just gunned down a bunch of cops without hesitation or remorse, what really confuses me about this scene is that Angel’s head looks like it’s positioned under the tire of the getaway car, but Krupp’s gang hesitates just long enough to allow him to move it to the side before they drive away. This whole moment is handled so, I don’t know, lackadaisically I guess, that I honestly can’t figure out if squishing Angel’s head was Krupp’s special way of offing him, or if that’s just where the actor was and someone off camera told him to move so the car can split.\n\nA lot of the goofiness is strictly dialogue-based, however. Certainly this is purely a fault on the part of the dubbing, but that doesn’t mean I don’t love it. When Angel randomly shows up at the home of Dr. Almada, his sudden appearance is treated with less shock than you might expect a masked stranger to elicit. Angel then refuses to explain why he’s wearing a mask because it’ll take too long, then just moments later explains he wears it to make his crime fighting job easier. (It neither takes too long to explain nor even really needs explanation.) During that same scene, after Angel explains how Krupp escaped by gunning down cops, Flor states “what a ruthless thing to do” in a tone that doesn’t at all capture what a ruthless thing it was to do.\n\nDialogue dumbness doesn’t end there, either. Speech is redundant or nonsensical time and time again, and while we’re at it, I noticed the voice given to Krupp doesn’t fit the villainousness of the character; he actually sounds sorta kind and compassionate!\n\nAlso, Angel is eventually revealed to be Almada’s wimpy, bespectacled assistant. It’s something you can see coming a mile away, but it gives the film an additional, mild Superman vibe. Just, you know, minus the whole genuinely heroic thing.\n\nThe Aztec Mummy himself (itself?) doesn’t actually figure into the plot all that much until the film is nearly over, though at only a little over an hour long it’s not like it takes all that long to get there. Basically the breastplate and bracelet are stolen, mums wakes up, heads to Krupp’s hideout, does some pummelin’, retrieves the items, and leaves. Alright then, thanks for stoppin’ by!\n\nI genuinely enjoyed this movie! It’s so fast-paced, goofy and at times outright stupid that you can’t help but love it. Plus, its brevity is an attribute, not a detriment. So does it indeed fall towards the Brainiac end of the silly Mexican horror spectrum for me? Yes, and in fact, I may like it more! As far as this tape goes, The Curse of the Aztec Mummy is worth the price of admission alone. Well, as long as said price is pretty cheap, like it was for me.\n\nOkay, time for the second feature…OH HEY, WAIT!\n\nLookit that! In between the movies, HHT actually included the old Let’s All go to the Lobby snipe, plus intermission and feature presentation cards! I sure wasn’t expecting that! It’s a small thing, but it sure adds to the whole “double feature” aspect of the tape! I would have expected something quirky like this on a release from the 1990s, but for one as old as 1980, it’s definitely a pleasant surprise!\n\nAnd that brings us to movie #2: The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy. As I said before, I’ve had a passing familiarity with this movie, but until this tape, it wasn’t something I had actually watched. Besides this VHS, I own it twice-over, as part of the Grampa series (because of course), and as a longtime MSTie, I have that particular Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode on its respective DVD set. The Grampa tape is a later release so his intro/outro isn’t even on it, and the MST3K episode, that’s a first season installment, one I’ve heard isn’t particularly great even by the standards of that year, so I never even bothered firing it up. Add to that the movie’s reputation as dull and littered with flashbacks to the previous two entries, and yeah, I wasn’t exactly chomping at the bit to dig into this one beforehand, not until I had fun with Curse anyway.\n\n(WARNING: some more spoilers coming, like it matters.)\n\nDespite being filmed immediately after the movie we just saw, and in stark contrast to that flick’s plot, Robot doesn’t take place right where Curse left off. Instead, it picks up five years after the events of the preceding film. I’m not sure I like that, but it’s not like I had much say in the matter.\n\nOne thing’s for sure: it’s definitely loaded with flashbacks, including lengthy ones from the first film in the series. In the context of this tape, that works, and really, even in the context of the time in which this was first released here, it’s appropriate, since as previously stated that first movie hadn’t properly hit the U.S. yet. It’s kind of a drag seeing things we had already seen flashbacked to an hour or so before, and even more of a drag seeing flashbacks to the movie we had just watched, but it is what it is. And, there are large portions from the first movie seen here that we didn’t see in Curse, which helps flesh out the overall story somewhat. It’s here that we first see the mummy repelled by the sight of a Crucifix, Dracula-style, and while it’s not something touched on again (not in these English translations at least), it’s something that pleased this good Cat’lic boy.\n\nAfter getting the preliminary flashbacks out of the way, the film then starts flashing back to (presumably) new footage to set up the main story, and actually, now that I think about it, much of the movie is one big flashback, being related to friends of Almada and his now-wife Flor. (Nice continuity!)\n\nIt seems Krupp escaped his apparent death at the end of the last film, and for the past five years has been working on his ultimate plan to defeat the mummy, retrieve the artifacts and get his precious, precious treasure. By hypnotizing Flor, Krupp is able to find out where the stupid mummy is now located, and with that knowledge in hand, his scheme is revealed: he’s built a remote controlled, atomic powered robot! When the breastplate and bracelet are retrieved and the mummy predictably wakes up to deliver a beat down, said robot should be able to withstand the assault and instead defeat the mummy once and for all.\n\nAnd what a robot! This thing is a boxy, stereotypical 1950s bot, beyond cheap looking and impossible to take seriously. Inside its helmet is a real person’s face, assumed to be a corpse Krupp stole, and decked out with lightbulbs, the thing is just plain goofy.\n\nBut you know, when the climatic-yet-brief fight finally occurs, it does seem that the robot has the upper hand; it withstands every attack from the mummy. Like the last film, the mummy doesn’t really factor into things (barring flashbacks) until the end here. It does seem like he/it/whatever might lose the battle, though since it’s an eternal, supernatural mummy, maybe the fight would just go on and on and on in a repetitively endless draw or something. But when our protagonists arrive and shoot the remote control out of Krupp’s hands, the mummy makes quick work of the thing, shaking it apart like a bunch of tin cans. It’s both funny looking and highly anticlimactic.\n\nI have less to say about Robot than I did Curse, because Robot just isn’t as much stupid fun. The titular bout is wacky enough, but the first half or so (it’s not like I timed it) of the film is mainly recounting the previous entries, and even when the new story proper gets rolling, it’s not as entertainingly stupid as the last movie. Even the dubbed dialogue takes awhile to get funny. The movie starts promisingly enough, with an introductory narration that promises the events to be notarized as true (yeah, okay) but then immediately contradicts itself by claiming the film is a work of both fact and fiction (which may hold some truth; the Aztecs apparently did have their own mummies, though I’m not sure how close they looked to the cinematic representation here, and at any rate I’m fairly certain none of them ever came back to life to fight crime), but until the end of the movie, things just never live up to that silly goose hype.\n\nFurthermore, Almada’s assistant is back, but The Angel doesn’t make a reappearance, not even in the flashbacks (at least not masked and in action). Krupp does obliquely reference The Angel once, but if you hadn’t seen Curse first, you’d be none the wiser. That’s a let down, and takes away a lot of inherent goofiness, something Robot has but needs more of. A LOT more of. It’s just not as entertaining as Aztec Mummy #2.\n\nI did really like the cheap-but-endearing cemetery and laboratory sets, however.\n\nSo that’s Hollywood Home Theatre’s Aztec Mummy two-fer. The second half of the double feature may not live up to the first, but you know, as a whole this release is still a lot of fun. Certainly it’s an early example of home video; the sleeve is mostly bare bones and the prints utilized aren’t exactly pristine (Robot looks a bit better than Curse, but not by much. That said, both are entirely watchable). Nevertheless, the movies are just wacky enough to recall the drive-in double features of yesteryear, something that is only reinforced by the intermission segment. If that’s what HHT was seeking to achieve, I dare say they succeeded!\n\nIs this the most sought-after release on the label? I’m almost positive that it isn’t. There’s at least one Godzilla entry in their oeuvre, and I’d imagine that is worth some mega bucks to ‘Zilla/VHS collectors. Nevertheless, I’d think there’s some inherent value to anything vintage horror and/or sci-fi on the label, but even if there isn’t, I’d still say this is a cool way to visit, or revisit, these flicks. Provided you can find the tape in the first place, that is!\n\nNow gang, believe me when I say I’ve been wanting to showcase this retro video game oddity for quite awhile, and today is the day. Folks into vintage electronics and/or thrifting will almost certainly be at least vaguely familiar with the portable black & white TVs put out by Bentley in the 1980s. They were (and are) cheap and ubiquitous, and while I can’t find a scan online right now, I recall seeing ads giving them away free when you bought RVs back in the day. I would guess you could get them free any number of ways; buying cars, opening a bank account, and so on and so forth. That’s just a guess on my part, but considering how common they are and have been for many, many years, it makes sense.\n\nOr maybe they were just incredibly cheap to purchase from the beginning. They weren’t exactly high end, but they did their job and looked (look) cool enough. I’ve related this anecdote before, but I still recall taking mine on a camping trip back in like 1999, and staying up late watching Terminator 2 on Big Chuck & lil’ John with it (by the end of the broadcast, the power of the gigantic size D batteries had been sapped sufficiently enough to basically render the film a silent). Granted, there’s not much you can do with these TVs nowadays, not without jumping through some hoops at least, but the point is anyone who has been into vintage electronics for some period of time should have a passing familiarity with ’em, even if only by sight.\n\nWELL, it turns out lil’ itty bitty televisions weren’t the only things Bentley (not to be confused with the car company, near as I can tell) put out back in the 1980s. The most well-known and common, sure, but in addition to that, they also put out a similar-looking portable all-in-one Super 8 projector, which was, if nothing else, cool in concept; some of the reviews I’ve seen online don’t exactly give it high marks. (I have one of these, but it’s still new-in-the-box and I never had the heart to crack it open – especially since I don’t do much, or anything really, with Super 8.)\n\nAlso put out by Bentley back in the 1980s? A video game console!\n\n“Oooh, what does it play?!”\n\nThe Bentley Compu-Vision (though it’s often spelled “Compuvision,” no dash, online – which is my preferred personal spelling, though I’ll be technically correct here in hopes of staving off snotty comments) was released at some point in 1983, and is a compact, elegant little beast. The black casing with woodgrain trim (which extends along the sides) obviously recalls the Atari 2600, while the built-in controller bays and usage of “vision” in the name puts it on the same turf as the Intellivision and ColecoVision (plus, hey, ColecoVision, Compu-Vision, CV – coincidence???).\n\nWoodgrain was probably a little passé by 1983, even the then-current iteration of the 2600 had dropped it by then, but nevertheless, this thing just looks cool. From the onset it comes off like a 2600/ColecoVision hybrid. It’s a relatively small, lightweight console, attractively designed and with the shiny gold lettering of “Bentley Compu-Vision” lending it an additional touch of, I don’t know, techy class or something.\n\n“That’s all well and good, but what does it play?!“\n\nWhat’s more, the usage of “compu” in the name unmistakably plays into the then-emerging popularity of home computers. Computers were still a relatively-new thing to consumers – in a general, widespread sense – at the time, but their popularity was increasingly growing. Spearheaded by the Atari 8-bits and Commodore 64, and with the video game crash of 1983/1984 hitting consoles – and retailers – hard, the emergence of home computers as an ever present part of daily life (which continues to this day, right down to the smart phones we have in our pockets) can probably best be traced to the era we’re talking about right here. They certainly existed before, but it was at that point that their popularity with the general public really started taking off. Or at least that’s how I see it.\n\nOf course, where the Compu-Vision is concerned, that’s just fancy-namin’; this thing is a computer in only the barest of senses. Oh sure, it’s electronic and does electronic things, technically you could call it a computer, but functionality-wise, it was hardly a substitute for an Atari 800XL.\n\nNevertheless, from name to design, there’s little doubt as to what era this hails from. From outside appearances alone, it’s tough to imagine this thing coming from anywhere but the 1982-1984 timeframe.\n\n“SO WHAT DOES IT PLAY ALREADY?!?!”\n\nSo what does the Compu-Vision play, you ask? Pong. It plays Pong. And variations of, say it with me, Pong.\n\nQuick background: in the 1970s, General Instruments produced the AY-3-8500 chip. Easily acquired, this chip led to a glut of Pong-based consoles from a variety of manufacturers in the late-70s. Of course, since the chip played the same set of Pong variations across the board, this meant there was little difference between the consoles beyond outside cosmetics. Indeed, we’ve already seen one such example with the Wonder Wizard a few years back.\n\nWith so many consoles being basically identical beyond their case design, not to mention the emergence of cartridge-based systems (and yes, even home computers were beginning to make the scene), it stands to reason Pong-based units had sorta petered out by 1978/1979, though in retrospect they still remain interesting examples of video gaming, based solely on how they look (unless you just really, really like Pong).\n\nThe Compu-Vision here plays four Pong-based games. In order of my screenshots, there’s handball (called “practice” on the console itself), squash (often called jai alai on these consoles, which I wish was the case here cause then I could reference the “Killshot” episode of Miami Vice, which I guess I just did anyway), soccer (also often called hockey), and tennis, which is just your standard, classic Pong.\n\nBesides the expected power, reset and game variations, switches on the console also let you adjust the angle of the ball, the speed of the ball, and the size of the paddles, so these could all be made quite a bit tougher than you may first expect. The ball really zips on the fast speed, for example. This could make for some really fun, competitive matches, though I’m just surmisin’ here cause it’s not like I can ever get anyone over to play this stuff with me. Except for practice, these are all two-player only; my superfluousness has come back to haunt me!\n\nBecause this Bentley came out so much later than other Pong-based consoles, it shares some traits with other contemporary machines: sound is piped through the TV rather than the console itself, and unlike the Wonder Wizard nonsense I had to deal with, the Bentley uses a standard RF cord and switchbox. It also takes a 6V DC adapter, which I didn’t have available (or maybe I did and just wasn’t aware of it; I’ve got enough junk laying around to where that’s a distinct possibility). In a nod to Pong past, the console also uses batteries, though in this case it’s not several hundred (loose approximation) behemoth batteries, but only four AAs. Cheap and readily available, the convenience factor was/is off the charts!\n\nAll of this meant that getting the console to display on my PC and taking real, actual video/ screenshots was pretty easy. Yes indeed, those screencaps above were taken by yours truly, from this very console. Of course, given the AY-3-8500 used, the graphics (such as they are) are identical to any number of other Pong units, but I promise you, these here are from the Bentley. I mean, why would I lie about that?\n\nSome (but not all) Pong consoles had the paddle controls built right into unit, meaning players had to sit right up on the machine and hunch over it for the duration. But since the Compu-Vision wanted you to think it was more than it really was, the controllers, while ultimately hardwired in (always a danger: remember the Arcadia 2001?), are at least removable from the unit. The cords aren’t super duper long, you still need to sit pretty close to the console, but at least you can lean back on the couch some.\n\nHere’s the deal with the controls on these old Pong systems: decades of dust and dirt accumulate in them, resulting in them being pretty jittery on-screen. This is generally an easy fix, the potentiometers simply need cleaned. This is common enough that I automatically assume the paddles will be jittery whenever I bring a new old one of these things into the collection.\n\nBut you know what? This is actually the second Compu-Vision I’ve added to the collection (the first, my “collectible one” as it were, is boxed away safely), and in both cases, I’ve found the controllers to be excellent. Not only are they pretty comfortable, but they performed wonderfully without my attempting to clean them in any way whatsoever. Now you could argue that because this thing was so obsolete upon arrival (something we’re going to talk more about in just a moment), no one played it enough to get the controllers dirty, but I really think they’re just well-made in general. My first Compu-Vision, the controls were silky smooth, and with this one here, while they could probably use a bit of a cleaning, things are still entirely playable as it is. (Looking at the picture, you may be tempted to think there’s a bunch of grime in the base there; while there’s a tiny bit of debris, that’s actually the color of the nut used that makes things look uglier than they are.)\n\nI never would have guessed it beforehand, but the controllers on this are some of the best I’ve found on a Pong console. Whoda thunk?!\n\nWanna know the most interesting thing about the Bentley Compu-Vision to me? It’s not the name, or the design, or the controllers. Rather, it’s the fact that it was even released when it was. I mean, 1983! 1983!! It may not mean much now, but it’s unbelievable just how antiquated this thing was upon arrival in ’83. I’ve seen more than one reference to it retailing at $25, a ridiculously cheap amount even in 1983 dollars (if accurate), but even if you could get it free with the purchase of a car or whatever, as I’m surmising, no kid was going to really want this in any serious gamin’ capacity. Video games, both at home and in the arcades, had hugely evolved by that point.\n\nWhat’s more, the first flowerings on what we now consider the 8-bit era proper were in play. The Japanese versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System (as the Famicom) and Sega Master System (the Mark III) came out that year, and the Atari 7800 was in development here and slated for a 1984 release (which ultimately didn’t really happen, aside from a test market that year; we’d get that, along with wide releases of the NES and SMS, in ’86), but even the stuff already on shelves here in the U.S. was just miles ahead of this thing. Heck, it would have been outdated in 1979, never mind 1983! The fact that it was cosmetically made to ‘fit in’ just makes it all the more intriguing.\n\nIn a way, it makes a weird bit of sense though. I imagine the AY-3-8500 was still readily available, and video games were big business, so why not try to get in on the gravy train with an uber-cheap offering? Plus, it’s one thing to look at the console itself, but it’s not like the box (which I don’t have) made false promises. Aside from ignoring the fact it played wildly obsolete games, there was little doubt you were getting Pong with this thing. And aesthetically it fit in with home entertainment set-ups of the time, so I guess for a kid just trying to get the most consoles he could, it worked as filler if nothing else.\n\nPlus, Pong may have been old hat by 1983, but don’t underestimate how fun and competitive a simple oldie like it could, and can, be. Indeed, when this came in, I had to unhook the Atari Video Pinball unit I’ve been noodling with, the versions of Breakout and attempts at basketball on it having kept me fairly occupied lately. There’s something to be said for twitch, hand/eye coordination type games. So while it may have been ancient even in 1983, believe it or not there was still some fun to be had.\n\nNowadays, the Bentley Compu-Vision isn’t exactly unknown; there’s plenty of info on it out there in internet land. But conversely, it’s also not that well-known, either. The Atari/Sears Pongs and the Coleco Telstars and the Magnavox Odysseys will continue to get more press in retro gaming circles, and rightfully so. That said, I think I’d say the Bentley is my favorite *proper* Pong console; the games are tried and true, and cosmetically it’s attractive, but the fact that it’s so ‘wrong’ is what puts it over the top for me. (Though when it comes to Pong consoles in general, I think the Telstar Arcade still tops it for me, even though that one was quite a bit more advanced and played shooting and racing games in addition. Although, while it doesn’t play any Pong variants at all, I think I like the Atari Video Pinball more than any of them, at least where U.S. consoles in this particular ‘dedicated unit’ genre are concerned.)\n\nThe Bentley Compu-Vision isn’t particularly valuable; you can find them relatively cheap and plentiful online. The first one I bought was entirely affordable, and you know how much this one was? $5! Five bucks!! There was shipping on top of that, but even that was incredibly reasonable. I’ve spent more total on old VHS tapes than I did this Bentley! Now granted, it wasn’t perfect; the battery cover was missing, and it was sold as untested, but at that price, I could afford to take chances. At worst, it’d become a neat display piece. The untested part didn’t even concern me all that much; while that’s sometimes seen as dishonest code for “broken,” in my experience these old consoles were built like tanks; I tend to give the benefit of the doubt and figure the seller just doesn’t have the switchbox or adapter or TV or whatever to fully test these. And while there’s a few machines I’ve bought simply for collecting purposes (that is, I never seriously intended to bother hooking them up – and still haven’t to this day), for ones I picked up wanting to at least give a try, I don’t think I’ve ever gotten one that hasn’t worked to some degree.\n\nOf course, that’s just my experience; you shouldn’t use it as your personal guideline. But for me, I’ve had good luck with these oldies. Things back then were built to last.\n\nSo, if you’re looking for a Pong console to add to your collection, the Bentley isn’t a bad choice. It plays the same games as so many others, but it has enough then-modern attributes, both in looks and in connections, to make it a better option than some. Plus, it’s got that whole super-late release thing going for it. If this wasn’t the last Pong console released in the U.S., it’s certainly one of the very last. So if you’re only adding one Pong and don’t want to break the bank, hey, you could do worse!\n\nFriends, believe it or not, this blog is now 10 years old. 10 years old?! It’s true; I started it in March 2013. Back then, I was able to post a whole lot more frequently than I am now, but hey, I’ve stuck with it, and you know what? I WANT ACCOLADES! Gimme my accolades! Now! I mean, if you want. Please?\n\nThe earliest post here is this terrible old article from March 30, 2013 (don’t bother reading it), but there were a few posts before it that I no longer have up (I do that sometimes). As with anything else, the more you work at something, the better you become at it, and frankly, I don’t think I found whatever constitutes my groove here until, I don’t know, 2015 or 2016. Even then, there were things I did then that I’d do different now, but none of this really matters, so who cares?\n\nANYWAY, I don’t really have a big 10th anniversary extravaganza update planned, I guess I could have done one, but as previously stated, none of this really matters, so who cares? Nevertheless, our subject today harkens back, somewhat, to an article from those early, unformed days. Perhaps you’ll recall (though I doubt it) this old, old post from August 1, 2013, in which I detailed an uber-obscure old video game console by the name of the APF M1000. Despite the rough nature of that early effort (that one would look quite different if written nowadays), it’s done pretty well views-wise. Probably because no one had one of those things back in the day.\n\nSo what say we go back to the same wheelhouse, with another obscure video game console no one had back in the day, either. Although comparatively, fewer people didn’t have it than they didn’t have the APF. (In other words, it’s not as obscure.) Ladies and gennelmen, dig the Emerson Arcadia 2001!\n\nActually, design-wise the Arcadia isn’t dissimilar to the APF – right down to the uncomfortable, hard-wired controllers! But whereas the APF featured mostly rudimentary, first-generation type games, the Arcadia’s library was much more in line with the arcade scene of the early 1980s. There were a few actual ports of coin-op games, albeit mostly obscure ones, but don’t worry; much of the rest of the library was made up of shameless rip-offs of popular arcade games! Don’t think for a minute this doesn’t appeal to me.\n\nReleased in 1982, Emerson’s Arcadia 2001 was pretty much a flop. Ostensibly it was competing with the era-defining Atari 2600 and the 2600’s arch enemy, Mattel’s Intellivision. If those were its only two adversaries, it still wouldn’t have won the war, but it may well have made more of a splash than it did (especially with an introductory price of, supposedly, only $99, which even in 1982 dollars was still a pretty decent price for a video game console – if true, that is).\n\nUnfortunately, the Arcadia launched not long before the ColecoVision, which promised to bring the arcade experience home and did a pretty good job of doing so. Furthermore, Atari also dropped the 5200 in 1982, which was supposed to fight the Intellivison but ended up going head-to-head with ColecoVision, and beyond even that, home computers – no slouches at playing games themselves – were gaining in popularity as well. Released into this climate, the Arcadia just never stood a chance.\n\nNevertheless, while it never made much of a dent in the U.S., an impressive number of officially-licensed clone consoles exist throughout the world. And, even though the library wasn’t exactly gigantic or, you know, great, there’s still a sizable number of titles aping real, big time arcade hits. While it’s more of a curio than something you’d give more playing time to than a 2600, that doesn’t mean there isn’t still some fun to be had. Right out the gate, this thing has more vested interest in it for me than the APF ever did/does.\n\nYou’ll have to contend with some relics of video game past, though. No, I’m not talking about the cartridge format (I consider that a good thing), but rather, the antiquated, uncomfortable controllers. I’m not just talking about them being hard-wired into the console, although that’s annoying too (this is a factor that will come back to haunt me; you’ll see later in the post), but rather, the elongated shape sporting a numeric membrane keypad, a joystick and fire buttons on the sides. It’s not particularly comfortable, and certainly not suited to long play sessions, and it’s a design seen over and over again in early video game consoles. From the Intellivision to ColecoVision to, well, even the APF, manufacturers sure did love to make kids’ hands cramp up! You think you’re such hot biscuits, takin’ on galactic invaders and whatnot? That may be true, but that doesn’t mean there’s not a price to be paid for such a wild, unchecked ego. Playing this for long periods of time could have dire ramifications for yours truly. “Hey man, how’d you get carpal tunnel syndrome? 10 years of blogging?” “Naw bro, it’s from playing my Arcadia 2001 too much!” “Your what?”\n\nI will say this though: with its joystick rather than pad and still-mushy-but-not-AS-mushy fire "
