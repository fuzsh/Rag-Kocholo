        "text": "Featuring: Daredevil\n\nRelease: May 5, 1966\n\nCover: July 1966\n\n12 cents\n\nStory by: Smilin’ Stan Lee\n\nArt by: Jazzy Johnny Romita\n\nInks by: Fearless Frank Giacoia\n\nLettering by: Swingin’ Sammy Rosen\n\n20 pages\n\nKaren is about 99% convinced that I’m really Daredevil! But, she still hasn’t said she’ll marry me!\n\nNext to the credits, we learn Stan had scripted 7 pages before taking a vacation, and that Denny O’Neil finished the script.\n\nWe met Dennis O’Neil on the final two issues Ditko’s Dr. Strange, his first comics work. He won’t be at Marvel long. He’ll go on to pretty good things at the Distinguished Competition.\n\nFoggy enters a costume shop featuring various superheroes and villains. Recall how we saw a lot of superhero sculptures from Wally Wood to show off his takes on the characters; this is Romita’s chance to show he’s qualified for a variety of titles. Unfortunately Wood left before trying his hand at other Marvel characters.\n\nRomita will be with Marvel for the rest of his days, and have generally more positive things to say about Stan and their relationship than the artists we’ve been seeing up until now. And Romita will get plenty of chances in the future to draw the characters he’s depicting here.\n\nContinue reading “Daredevil #18”\n\nFeaturing: Marvels\n\nRelease: January 25, 1994\n\nCover: March 1994\n\n$5.95\n\nWriter: Kurt Busiek\n\nArtist: Alex Ross\n\nLetterers: Starkings w/ John Gaushell\n\nEditor: Marcus McLaurin\n\nAssistant editor: Spencer Lamm\n\nEditor in chief: Tom DeFalco\n\nCover design & logo: Joe Kaufman\n\nInterior Design: Comicraft\n\n45 pages\n\nAnd then it was quiet. No one around. They were all inside– or gone. Was this what it was going to be like? Silence and emptiness– forever?\n\nWe again jump back to 1994. As noted in this post, which serves as something of a vision statement, my goal here is to be able to reread my first comic, Avengers #309, but this time with full context, without feeling like I was missing anything or that I had read things out of order. More than that, it’s an attempt to try to see decades of disparate titles by a variety of creative voices as telling a larger single story.\n\nI see Marvels, the masterpiece by Busiek and Ross, as an attempt to come to terms with that same story, and then to tell it in miniature. In general I try to take a contemporaneous viewpoint, looking at our 1966 stories from the perspective of 1966, and not spending too much thought on what later stories have to say. Marvels is the exception, as I’m using Marvels to frame our reading and my thinking about this reading.\n\nFor example, we jumped a little bit ahead in our X-Men reading lately. The rush through X-Men was to line up with this issue of Marvels. I was eager to read this comic right after the Galactus saga, but knew I had to hold back until after the X-Men battled Count Nefaria. And the choices in reading order we made with respect to the Avengers and Fantastic Four stories were inspired by how Marvels presented them.\n\nThere is no other later series I let impact my thinking on these stories. That’s born both out of a love of Marvels and its creators, and a trust in Kurt Busiek to have done his homework.\n\nAs this post is a bit long and picture-heavy, I’ve broken it into two parts.\n\nThe series Marvels covers the Marvel Universe from 1939-1973. I don’t know how far this blog will go before I get bored or die, but I’m hoping to at least hit 1973 and finish Marvels. But that is several years away.\n\nThere’s also a bit of timing in the writing of this blog that has recontextualized Marvels and the stories it represents again. I started this blog in 2019 and reached Marvels #1 in 2020, and found new meaning in Phil’s desire for the world to return to normalcy. I write this blog post in 2024, with 2020 four years in the past, but the pandemic continuing to affect lives in big and small ways.\n\nMarvels #1 starts with the dawn of Marvel in 1939 and takes us into the war in Europe, likely around 1943. We then jump forward 20 years and Marvels #2 covers the ground of part of our reading. It skips the introductions of most of the heroes and takes us to 1964 and Avengers #6 (May 1964), then ends in 1965 with Tales of Suspense #69 (around July 1965). Its focus was on the juxtaposition of two major events, the wedding of Reed and Sue in Fantastic Four Annual 3, and the introduction of the Sentinels in X-Men #14-16.\n\nThinking in terms of Fantastic Four, a title which has been a monthly constant in our reading, Marvels #2 covers the ground of approximately Fantastic Four #29-43.\n\nMarvels #3 will cover a little less ground, Fantastic Four #44-50, bringing us to around February 1966. And most of the page count is dedicated to recapturing a single story, the battle between the Fantastic Four and Galactus in Fantastic Four #48-50. Due to its wonky arrangement with other stories, the original battle only covered about 48 pages of comics originally, so the retelling in miniature is not actually that much shorter, taking up almost 32 pages.\n\nOf course, this retelling will not be from the perspective of the Fantastic Four, but our man Phil Sheldon.\n\nThe story has been about Phil, but also about his changing opinion of the Marvels. In the 1930s, he thought they were something to fear when he first saw Human Torch and Sub-Mariner, but came to conclude they were something to cheer on when he saw Captain America, and then all the heroes teaming up against Nazis. He continued to cheer them on into the 1960s, loving the Fantastic Four and the Avengers… but not the X-Men. Mutants, he hated. Though he grew a bit by the end.\n\nNow he begins to wonder if he’d put a bit too much faith in all the Marvels, put them too much on a pedestal. As they become embroiled in controversy after controversy… had he overestimated them? He begins to have doubts.\n\nAnd then the sky fills with fire.\n\nContinue reading “POSTLUDE: Marvels #3”"
