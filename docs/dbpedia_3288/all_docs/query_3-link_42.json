        "text": "Origin\n\nAt a young age, Stephen Strange had dreams of becoming a doctor. The eldest child of three, Strange was born in 1930 while his parents Eugene and Beverly Strange were on vacation in Philadelphia. At the age of eleven he aided his younger sister Donna when she was injured, which proved to be a formative experience for him, and he was inspired to attend med school after high school. Ironically, it was his inability to later save her from drowning when he was nineteen and on leave from college that undermined his belief in life’s meaning and the value of idealism. Nevertheless, he rapidly finished med school at a young age and became a successful neurosurgeon.\n\nStrange displayed phenomenal talent in his chosen field, and quickly attained wealth and notoriety. The more successful he became, the more arrogant he grew. Eventually this led to estrangement from his family and the undoing of his relationship with a United Nations translator named Madeline Revell to whom he had proposed marriage. So distant and self-absorbed did he become that he refused to visit his father on his deathbed. His enraged younger brother Victor Strange berated him for this, and then was killed as he ran into traffic. Stephen then placed the body of his brother into cryogenic storage. At a much later stage Stephen attempted to restore his brother through magical means, but instead imbued him with the curse of vampirism.\n\nA car accident that damaged the nerves in his hands changed everything for Stephen Strange. He was no longer able to be a surgeon, yet he refused to become an assistant or consultant, instead squandering his money traveling the world and searching for a cure. One day he heard a rumor of a mystical personage known as the Ancient One in Tibet. Marshaling the last of his inner and outer resources, Strange diligently searched until the fortress of the Ancient One was revealed to him. Though initially outraged that the aged mystic refused to cure his hands, Strange’s anger was quickly replaced by amazement when the reality of magical forces was demonstrated before his eyes as he witnessed an attack on the Ancient One.\n\nCircumstances revealed to Strange that it was none other than Baron Mordo, the Ancient One’s chief disciple, who was the perpetrator of the attack, and who continued to plot the destruction of the antediluvian mystic in an attempt to gain power. To his horror, Strange learned he was unable to reveal this after Mordo easily encircled him. Realizing the Ancient One was a force for good; Stephen selflessly abandoned his quest to restore his hands and committed himself to magical tutelage with the intention of foiling Mordo’s insidious scheme. By this act Strange proved himself to the Ancient One, to whom the entire melodrama had been transparent. Thus Doctor Strange put himself on the path to become the new Sorcerer Supreme of the Earth dimension, yet gained a deadly enemy in Baron Mordo.\n\nCreation\n\nDoctor Strange was created by the writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko and made his first ever appearance in Strange Tales #110 in 1963. He was originally going to be called Mr. Strange, but that was rejected for sounding too much like Mr. Fantastic. They changed the honorific to \"Dr.\" despite debuting a different Doctor Strange a few months earlier.\n\nCharacter Evolution\n\nAfter many years of training, Strange returned to New York. He became a mystical consultant and started having interactions with the superhero community. After the Fantastic Four formed and many superheroes began to surface, Doctor Strange found a friend in Spider-Man. Spider-Man helped him rescue a group of people from another dimension and suggested that Strange remove from their memory this traumatic experience, though this meant that they would forget his own heroism. Initially tricked into conflict with each other by Loki, Thor and Doctor Strange also formed an early alliance to combat the god of mischief.\n\nNoteworthy among the good Doctor’s numerous foes over the years as Earth’s magical guardian were the Dread Dormammu, Shuma-Gorath, the Undying Ones, and Nightmare. Strange’s first battle with Dormammu ensued when the powerful demigod of the Dark Dimension attempted to invade earth’s plane as he perceived the wane of the Ancient One’s might. Strange was forced to duel Dormammu in the Dark Dimension, and though vastly out-powered by the god-like entity, Strange was able to tax Dormammu to the extent that the barrier separating beings know as the Mindless Ones from the rest of the Dark Dimension became compromised. A force of pure destruction, the Mindless Ones would have meant annihilation to the other denizens of Dormmamu’s realm, and Strange nobly contributed his power to his enemy to prevent their being unleashed.\n\nBound by whatever strange honor as applies to his daemonic ilk, Dormammu then called off his invasion and released Strange. They were to clash many times subsequently, however, and Dormammu has been one of Strange’s most implacable and powerful foes. It was during this adventure that Doctor Strange also met Clea, a beautiful but inexperienced mystic (the daughter of Umar, Dormmamu’s sister), who became Strange’s first apprentice, as well as his lover.\n\nIn one of his more bizarre adventures, Strange fought the demonic forces of Shuma-Gorath, an ancient Lovecraftian entity that coveted earth’s domination from the world’s distant past and this time threatened our reality using the very mind of Doctor Strange’s beloved mentor, the Ancient One. Though it agonized him, Strange was left with no choice but to obey his teacher and slay him to prevent the holocaust Shuma-Gorath would have unleashed upon the world. The Ancient One then ascended to become one with the being known as Eternity, while Strange inherited the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme.\n\nMajor Story Arcs\n\nSorcerer Supreme and Defenders\n\nThe Defenders were born when Doctor Strange formed a bizarre team-up with the Hulk, Namor, and later the Silver Surfer. These four strong personalities somehow managed to work together and started the unlikely super-team known as the Defenders to combat yet another world-conquering demonic threat, this time in the form of beings called the Undying Ones who were led by the evil and ancient Nameless One.\n\nThe Defenders went on to battle numerous threats both supernatural and mundane (so to speak), and were joined in an oft-changing roster that included such unlikely characters as the Silver Surfer, Hellstorm, the Overmind, Valkyrie, Nighthawk, and Hellcat.\n\nDracula and the Montessi Formula\n\nIn yet another impressive display of the capabilities of a Sorcerer Supreme, Strange opposed Dracula himself to rid the world, at least for a time, of the plague of vampirism. Assisted by a dedicated band of vampire hunters (Hannibal King, Blade, and Frank Drake) and Wong. Doctor Strange kept Dracula busy, while the others recited the Montessi Formula from The Darkhold and destroyed virtually all the world’s vampires, including Dracula.\n\nYet this very undoing for most of the world’s vampires interacted with the previous spells Stephen Strange had attempted in his resurrection of his brother Victor, causing Victor to rise from the grave as the undead. Later developments also allowed the resurrection of many of the destroyed Nosferatu, though Strange banished the Vampire Verses to another plane of existence\n\nInfinity Gauntlet\n\nStrange went on to battle a host of threats to the Earth dimension, at times battling cosmic entities such as the In-Betweener; participating in the power struggles over the dominion of the Dark Dimension between Clea, Umar, and Dormammu; and joining other heroes to oppose Thanos in his attempt to gain the Infinity Gauntlet; to name but a few. He has triumphed over others bearing the title Sorcerer Supreme, such as Salome, the first Sorcerer Supreme of Earth, and Shanzar, the Sorcerer Supreme of another dimension. Though he at first resisted such calls because of his duties as Earth’s mystical protector, Strange was eventually drawn into a 5,000 year battle against the Trinity of Ashes on the side of the Vishanti. Because of the magical nature of the realm in which he fought, or because of his innate power, Strange was absent from his home dimension for this conflict for only a few months in everyone else’s perceptions and appeared to age but little.\n\nSecret Defenders and Midnight Sons\n\nThough unquestionably a mighty force for good that has saved the Earth and even the universe from destruction multiple times, Doctor Strange found it necessary to have heroes regroup themselves. He did so in the reformation of the Defenders, nicknamed the Secret Defenders. This group consisted of an ever changing roster of superheroes that where right for the job. Doctor Strange also played an important role in the formation of the Midnight Sons, whom battled an alien invasion and other occult creatures.\n\nDefenders Reformed and the Order\n\nDoctor Strange does continue to show a certain predilection for arrogance, as evidenced by his susceptibility to Yandroth’s manipulation when Namor, the Hulk, the Silver Surfer and himself banded together to essentially take over the world. Yandroth had banded the four together by an apparently unbreakable curse (because it was the will of Gaea) that forced them to be teleported to the scene whenever a threat to the Earth manifested. The curse also heightened their natural egotism and irritability, which for these four was considerable. Unwilling to be snatched away from their other responsibilities any time the curse decreed there was a threat, the four decided instead to form the Order, which would keep the world safe by taking control and preventing threats from arising. Opposed by the other heroes of earth, the four appeared to have the power to triumph, but they realized in time that Yandroth was mystically siphoning the power generated by their violence to resurrect himself with the power of a god.\n\nWhile they called off their plans and dispersed, they would not surrender themselves to mortal authorities for judgment. Doctor Strange was able to convince Gaea to let the four serve her willingly, and the curse was broken.\n\nCivil War and World War Hulk\n\nIt was revealed that Doctor Strange had been a participant in the Illuminati, a group of superheroes whom tried to discuss the biggest threads in the universe and solve them themselves. Dr. Strange became a member of the New Avengers after the end of the Civil War, which he did not become involved in. He assisted the team on their first mission to Japan, and was severely wounded. During their second mission, to defeat The Hood's Gang, Dr. Strange had to use extreme magic to take them all down.\n\nPrior to the event of World War Hulk, Strange was one of the Illuminati who voted to exile the Hulk because of his destructive tendencies. When the Hulk came back and demanded the presence of the those who exiled him, Strange infiltrated his mind as a way to calm him down, but Hulk knew this move all along and gave him the opportunity to break Strange's hands, so that he could not use his magic. Strange became desperate and drank a vial containing the essence of Zom, a powerful demon that he had once faced. When Strange and Hulk fought, Strange was winning but not before realizing that Zom is slowly influencing his actions. With this realization, he was defeated by Hulk and held captive in his make-shift gladiator arena of Madison Square Garden.\n\nStrange No More\n\nStrange later left the New Avengers feeling that he'd used too much dark magic, and must train in the use of light magic again. In the end, he failed in his duties as Sorcerer Supreme, thus his title is removed from him. In light of this he no longer wore his cloak of levitation nor the eye of Agamotto. Instead he went out to search for the new Sorcerer Supreme, hoping it was someone who had good intents instead of evil. The first person he visited was Wiccan, but there he was attacked by The Hood who was taken over by his demonic cape. With the help of Wiccan he managed to escape and went to the New Avengers for help.\n\nTogether they went to Hellstorm During the ride there, the eye of Agamotto glowed brightly and disapeared, according to Dr. Strange to the new Sorcerer Supreme. In the meantime the Hood was fighting Hellstorm but the fight was interrupted when a new player came in, Brother Voodoo, wearing the Cloak of Levitation and the Eye of Agamotto. The New Sorcerer Supreme!\n\nDark Reign\n\nAfter fighting off Hood and Dormmamu along side his allies Strange offers to train Voodoo in his new title which he accepts. Later during the Dark Reign Iron Man attempts to hide the information of the super heroes from Norman Osborn and wipes his mind clean which causes him to loose his intellect and after a beating by Osborn himself falls into a coma. Several attempts are made to revive him and soon Strange is called in to help. After traveling into Stark's mind he is able to bring him out of his dream and accept that he is Iron Man. While vulnerable Ghost arrives hoping to kill Stark but Strange comes out of his spell first and fights Ghost, but is wounded in battle. Iron Man awakens next and transports Ghost away with his own technology.\n\nAfter Osborn finally snapped and attacked Asgard Steve Rogers was given Osborn's old position and invited Strange to once again join the Avengers and he accepts. Soon after joining a demonic force possessing Strange and Damian Hellstorm attacks Doctor Voodoo trying to take the Eye of Agamotto by force. The mystical item teleports itself to the Mansion but is chased by the same force going from Luke Cage to eventually Iron Fist. After releasing a demonic army and kidnapping Iron Fist the source of the assault takes on the form of The Ancient One but after realizing his actions are uncharacteristic it is revealed to be Agamotto himself. He claims the Vishanti are dead and he want's his eye back. The Avengers accept a challenge from him and imbue Wolverine with all their combined powers to fight against Agamotto. In end Voodoo uses the power of the eye to apparently kill both Agamotto and himself.\n\nCircle of Four\n\nWhen Blackheart tried to use a Hell created Centrifuge to plunge Earth into Hell, Strange and Daimon Hellstorm were present to try and prevent this. However, Johnny Blaze had already placed an amulet, given to Hawkeye by Strange, on the border of Las Vegas, preventing Hell from stretching any further.\n\nHowever, while Venom, Red Hulk, X-23 and the new Ghost Rider fight within the barrier to prevent Hell and Blackheart from succeeding, Strange and Daimon work from the outside to prevent Hell spreading further, when the amulet shatters. They battle fiercely until Daimon gives in, under the persuasion of Blackheart. Fortunately, the four heroes within find a way to reverse the march of Hell and to defeat Blackheart, freeing Strange and Daimon, who notices that the four heroes have been marked with pentagrams similar to his own.\n\nAvengers vs. X-Men\n\nDr. Strange took part in the battle between the Avengers and the X-Men over the return of the Phoenix Force to earth. He battled Magik in her domain of Limbo, but without the powers of the Sorcerer Supreme he was ultimately defeated by her. Magik took advantage of this by posing as Strange and teleporting the X-Men away from their impending arrest at the hands of the Avengers. After the Phoenix empowers five prominent X-Men the Avengers are forced to go on the run.\n\nAs skirmishes break out between the X-Men and the Avengers, Dr. Strange is seen providing magical assistance such as using illusions of the Scarlet Witch to intimidate the Phoenix Five and teleporting teams away from one-sided fights. When the final assault is launched against Cyclops, Strange uses the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to bind the Phoenix avatar while Charles Xavier pleads with and then attacks his former student mentally. When Cyclops breaks free, Strange participates in the fight against him.\n\nFinal battle with the Avengers\n\nDaniel Drumm later returns to seek revenge on Strange and the other Avengers for failing to prevent Brother Voodoo's death. Strange is framed for the murder of Victoria Hand, which results in S.H.I.E.L.D. making a move on Avengers Mansion. Daniel subsequently possesses the various Avengers and forces them to battle Strange before Strange manages to defeat him once and for all. For his victory, he is reinstated as the Sorcerer Supreme and given back his old artifacts.\n\nDoctor Strange leaves the Avengers a short while later, and is not part of the group when it is restructured by Captain America and Iron Man.\n\nTime Runs Out\n\nDoctor Strange continues to work with the Illuminati in secret, with the group coming together once more to prevent multiversal incursions that threaten their world. Around this time, Strange is called in by monks to save a young Asian girl named Princess Phan, who has become posssessed by a powerful demonic entity. Stephen is unable to defeat the demon without killing Phan, so he instead offers to become its new host in exchange for releasing the child. The entity later manifests itself during the Illuminati's battle with the Great Society, which results in Strange violently killing most of the heroes.\n\nDoctor Strange and the rest of the Illuminati are later branded fugitives by Captain America, and are forced to go on the run. Strange disappears from this plane of existence but resurfaces as the new leader of the Black Priests.\n\nSecret Wars\n\nWhen the multiverse collapsed after the incursions and Doom used the power of the Beyonders to create Battleworld, Strange became Doom's Sheriff and right hand man for more than 8 years. He served Doom faithfully until he discovered that some of his fellow heroes, among which were Mr. Fantastic and Black Panther, had survived the incursions in stasis. Rediscovering his heroic nature after conversing with his comrades, Strange teleports his allies to safety when they are confronted by Doom and is subsequently killed by Doom for his opposition.\n\nAll New Doctor Strange and Last Days of Magic\n\nAfter the events of Secret Wars, Strange was resurrected with his memories of Battleworld removed during the restoration of the multiverse, becoming his dimension's mystical defender once again.\n\nStrange's spells began to fail him, however, and soon finds that magic throughout the dimensional planes was dying. He discovers the source of the disturbance to be the Empirikul, a group of science worshipers hell-bent on exterminating all magic throughout the multiverse. By the time they made their way to Strange's dimension, magic was all but extinguished, forcing Strange to gather and search for as many sources of magic remaining he could possibly find in order to combat the Empirikul.\n\nStrange ultimately manages to defeat the Emprikul and end their crusade with the help of his new librarian, Zelma, and a magical being created from his pain, Mister Misery. Zelma would stay with Strange helping him rekindle magic, but Mister Misery would continue to hold a grudge against Strange for his unfortunate existence.\n\nDamnation\n\nDuring Hydra’s takeover of America, Las Vegas was burned to the ground and sent to Hell. Doctor Strange took it upon himself to resurrect the city with magic, however, he also accidentally manifested Hotel Inferno, the hotel and casino created by Mephisto while Vegas was in Hell. Mephisto was allowing gamblers to bet their very soul and was able to convince Strange to make his own wager. If Strange wins, Mephisto empties his vault of souls and returns to Hell. However, Mephisto wins when he effectively tempts the Avengers with their own wrath. Thus, Strange’s soul now belongs to Mephisto.\n\nTo save Strange and Vegas, Wong and Bats collect a new roster of the Midnight Sons made of heroes that are either dead, damned, or carry darkness. The team consists of: Johnny Blaze, Blade, Moon Knight, Elsa Bloodstone, Iron Fist, Doctor Voodoo, Man-Thing, and, eventually, Ben Reilly. The team journeys to Vegas to do battle with Mephisto’s demon army, which now includes Strange and his Avengers allies as Ghost Rider-like demons.\n\nWhile possessed by Mephisto, Strange found himself in the Realm Between with the other possessed people. He was able to conjure his Avengers allies back to their bodies so they could join the battle with the Midnight Sons. It was all a distraction thought, so Johnny Blaze could go to hell and claim Mephisto's throne, robbing him of some of his power. With Blaze on the throne, Mephisto was imprisoned at Hotel Inferno.\n\nMagically Bankrupt\n\nStrange’s earthbound magic was burnt out well beyond the point that he could survive traveling to another dimension to recharge. On Tony’s suggestion, Strange took Tony’s new spaceship to look for a source of magic to recharge on a different planet. He met and partnered with Kanna, an arcanologist and technomancer. Together, they searched for more magical items throughout the cosmos.\n\nStrange was feeling strong when they heard about Eoffren, a Nidavellir dwarf being held by the Majesdanians. They carried out a rescue mission, but Eoffren confronted him about using other people's magic. He invited Strange to his forge so that Strange could make his own weapons.\n\nBack on Earth and settling back into the Santorum, Strange is visited by The Ancient One. He told Strange that he had been pulled from the astral plane and made mortal by a mysterious being that stole all his knowledge of magic. Using the Eye of Agamotto, Strange manifests a portal to the being that stole the Ancient One’s memories, a cosmic accountant\n\nThis accountant was responsible for Strange’s last disconnection from magic because Strange is one of the worst offenders of not paying the price of magic. When he went to space, he found a new way to conjure, leading to even more debt. This caused the accountant to bait Strange with the Ancient One and take Wong, Zelma, and Kanna as collateral against those who hold Strange’s debt: The Faltine. When Strange breaks them out, The Faltine invade Earth.\n\nWhile confronting Dormmamu, Strange teleports his allies back to the accountant’s office so they can find the piece of Ancient One’s memories that he had kept. By absorbing that information, the three of them were able to bring the fight to the Faltine, however, they had limited time since stolen magic knowledge is toxic. Unfortunately, they weren’t able to finish the job before Strange saved them by banning the knowledge from their minds. What Strange didn’t know, by doing so the knowledge was free to return to the Ancient One, who cleaned up the Faltine Strange’s other allies had missed.\n\nWith the accountant mysteriously gone, Strange remains in debt but is no longer cut off from magic, and Strange’s allies left for their own adventures\n\nHerald Supreme\n\nStrange is forced to travel to the Mystic Realm when an alien culture of sorcerers exiles Galactus there rather than have their planet be devoured. Strange feared that would cause an imbalance in laws of magic. Galactus hungered and devoured magic out of desperation, however, it was changing him. Strange convinced Galactus that he had become addicted and insane due to magic nutrients, so he volunteered to be Galactus’ herald while in the mystic realm so he can find appropriate sustenance for him, a job that was at odds with his oath as a medical professional.\n\nStrange went searching for a healthy planet without sentient life. Once he succeeded, he led Galactus to it with the help of Clea, however, the energies Strange had sensed earlier was now different. As a trick of Dormammu, it transformed him into a being of extreme science and extreme magic, one that Strange couldn’t fight alone. One that was causing ripples through reality. So, he brought together the strongest beings to stop him.\n\nStrange’s secret plan was to send them all into a battle they couldn’t win. He needed them to release all their energy on to Galactus so he would gorge and overflow to the point where Strange could split him with one powerful blow, destroying reality. In the aftermath, Strange was pulled to Hell by an angry Mephisto who no longer had souls to devour. So, he made a deal with Strange: he would give Strange the chance to go back and stop the alien sorcerer from banishing Galactus for the love that exists between Strange and Clea. Strange agreed.\n\nMarvel’s Medics Assemble\n\nStrange was attending a lecture by archaeologist, Dr. Annabelle Riggs. She was presenting, among other things, a magic mirror formed from the Gems of Aggamon. Strange was interested in keeping it safe at his Santorum. Just then, the Grim Reaper showed up to trap Strange’s astral form in the mirror and steal it. He was working for Mephisto, who was trying to replace Jane Foster as valkyrie. If Reaper successfully brings Strange to an afterlife, he becomes Earth’s new official death escort.\n\nBecause Reaper was already dead, Foster was able to use her abilities to bring him to Valhalla, where his powers were rendered inert. She returned with the mirror, freeing Strange’s astral form to return to his body. With the Eye of Agamotto, he saw Foster’s identity and swore to keep her secret.\n\nWhen a dead body comes to life and starts yelling about Death being sick, Foster seeks out Strange’s help. Strange would open a door to death’s realm for them to check on her, however, in order to diagnose Death appropriately, Strange suggests they first collect a medical team: Cardiac, Night Nurse, Manikin, and Excalibur. As they make their way through the realm, they witness the Death of Death, a giant manifestation of The Living Tribunal destined to reap Death. It was lording over Death’s home, waiting for its chance.\n\nWhen the medical team enters the home, they face multiple symptoms in metaphorical personifications. Unfortunately, Cardiac couldn’t take it and knocked Strange unconscious and killed Manikin in his Proto form. While Valkyrie continues on to heal death, Strange is revived to save Manikin’s 3 other forms.\n\nSurgeon Supreme\n\nWhen investigating a car crash caused by a roadside spirit, Strange came across a young boy in desperate need of brain surgery. His mother pleaded with Strange to do something after he admitted to being a doctor, but he was unable to do anything with the nerves in his hand still damaged. So, Strange took a risk with a rejuvenation spell that could also cut off his connection to magic, leaving his realm unguarded. The risk paid off as he neither lost his connection to magic nor did he lose the boy’s life.\n\nWith his hands fixed, Strange went back to work as a surgeon, in addition to being the Sorcerer Supreme. He only takes the cases that no other medical professional was willing to do thanks to an agreement with his hospital’s new Chief of Staff, a newly resurrected Dr. Druid. His two worlds collide when the emergency room fills up with victims of a magical attack from Wrecker. Wrecker had a power upgrade that Strange was unprepared for, and so did the rest of the magic using villains he had to contend with lately.\n\nStrange found out that their power upgrades came from his own forge by someone who killed Eoffren and stole his keys. Following a lead at Strange Academy, Strange uncovered an auction run by Madame Masque, who had been selling mystical weapons from Strange’s forge. Using image inducer’s from Mr. Fantastic, Strange and Druid disguised themselves as demons to get close to the auction. They were able to dissolve all the weapons, turning a number of demonic customers against Madame Masque.\n\nSavage Avengers\n\nStrange was approached by Elektra about the Eyes of Agamotto. She had joined a group of heroes spontaneously in the Savage Land (Savage Avengers) when Kulan Gath kidnapped a number of warriors to perform a blood ritual that would teleport him and his followers to a planet beyond our own solar system. Gath had the Third Eye of Agamotto, and Elektra thought it best he did not keep it. So, Strange and Elektra brought together another war party not unlike the first team. Since Strange has the first Eye, they split the teams: one going after Gath and the other going after Sadurang and the Second Eye. The team only retrieved the Second Eye. Kulan Gath stayed aloof, and Strange disbanded the team until Gath gave them a new lead.\n\nStrange's search for Gath was unsuccessful, however, he did find a poison that each of the Savage Avengers were dosed with. It would slowly work its way through their system until they bent the knee for Gath becoming his enslaved guard. Strange was able to purge them of the poison from afar with a spell that took years off the end of his life. With nowhere else to turn, Strange contacts Shuma-Gorath, who has also been poisoned by Gath. Gath had been feeding off Shuma-Gorath's energies, giving Strange no other option but to mercy kill the god. This coincided with the arrival of Conan the Barbarian, one of the Savage Avengers, who believed Gath had been under their noses the whole time.\n\nDeath of Doctor Strange\n\nDoctor Strange had a late visitor come to his door one night who stabbed Strange in the chest, killing him. Friends and enemies came to his side after sensing his death but were greeted by a temporary younger version of himself that Strange had coordinated with in case he was ever untimely killed. This younger Strange observed that the older Strange's soul was taken, and with it, his power. Without his power dissipating, there can be no new Sorcerer Supreme.\n\nWithout its Sorcerer Supreme, dimensional gateways opened up around the world releasing warlords fleeing a greater danger: The Peregrine Child and its Three Mothers. Clea came to Strange looking for help. Believing the two incidents are linked, Strange is aided by Clea in the investigation. They track Strange’s Eye of Agamotto and Cloak of Levitation to Baron Mordo, who swears they were stashed there in an effort to frame him. This leads Strange to accuse Kaecilius of working with the dimensional warlords to grant them safe passage. Kaecilius revealed he has affixed Strange’s hands to his arms as his own, making him more powerful. However, Strange uses a healing spell that transforms Kaecilius into the present day version of Doctor Strange.\n\nWith Clea’s help, he gets them all in one place to confront them and lure the Peregrine Child. Thanks to a binding spell that Wong and other magic users cast, the warlords are stuck on this plane. So Strange is able to talk them into joining the fight against the Three Mothers and the Peregrine Child who the Avengers and X-Men were already fighting. With five Sorcerer Supremes among them, they combine their energies into a pentagram and exile the Three Mothers and their child.\n\nSuccessful, Strange asks Clea for forgiveness while having one more kiss before Death takes him back.\n\nThe Harvestman\n\nIn death, Strange was put to work by Death herself as The Harvestman. It was his job to make sure that the dead stayed dead, which put him at odds with The Blasphemy Cartel, which was resurrecting old heroes as revenants. For his work, Death promised to return him to life. He would eventually be found out by Clea, who had been tracking resurrections hoping for his return. Unfortunately, due to Clea's commitment to life and Strange's to death, they were incapable of touching without causing a catastrophic energy release.\n\nWith a lead from Pandora Peters, Clea and Stephen learn the The Blasphemy Cartel is a former strike team of W.A.N.D. using resources they stole during the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Together, they raided the old WAND facility and were met with impressive force. This included their Revenant Prime, The Sentry, powered by one hundred million screaming ghosts. He was too much for Clea and Strange individually.\n\nWanting their last act to be that of love, Clea moves on Strange for a kiss knowing full well the energy pulse it would create. However, as they were kissing, Clea embraces the energy and manifests it, transforming the two of them into a single being called Strange. Together, they release the ghosts from Sentry causing the WAND location to explode. This took out Director None, but Strange teleported the other Blasphemy Cartel members to safety so they could have a second chance to do right.\n\nClea and Strange separate, and then Death makes good on her word. She gives Strange back his life, and the two sorcerers head home to the Sanctum to revive their romance.\n\nGeneral Strange\n\nDuring Strange's death, Earth had become home to a number of interdiminesional refugees. A number of these evil magicians and magical monsters were killed starting with the assassination of Aggamon. A new version of WAND was investigating, but the real killer eventually revealed themself at the wedding of Tiboro and Umar. It had been General Strange, the personification of Stange's trauma endured during the five thousand year long War of the Seven Spheres. The Vishanti had removed it from Strange and imprisoned it in a crystal. It managed to escape during Strange's death and do what Strange refused to: kill his enemies.\n\nTo shore up his defenses, Strange reached out to the Vishanti for help, but they refused. Strange was suspicious that they had let General Strange live believing they might need use of him in the future. Without their help, Strange turned to the Trinity of Ashes, his opposition in the War of the Seven Spheres.\n\nWith his new upgrade, Strange tracked The General to their childhood home in Nebraska. Clea had already arrived and botched her attempt to kill him. Unfortunately Strange's upgrade was no use against The General's experience fighting. Strange was just keeping him busy until WAND and their Psycho-Zeppelin could show up, at which point they would does The General with Doktor Zee's psychedelics to treat his PTSD. This gave Strange the opportunity to surgically graft a piece of his own soul on The General, returning his sense of empathy, compassion, and guilt.\n\nSuddenly, the General was overwhelmed by the price of his former actions. Clea wanted to kill him in this weakened state, but Strange decided to show him compassion. He invited him to stay in the basement of the Sanctum while Strange attempts to treat The General for his mental health.\n\nBlood Hunt\n\nWhen The Structure, a vampire cult bent on world domination, plunges the Earth into permanent darkness, Doctor Strange and Clea seclude themselves to the Sanctum's library hoping to recreate the Montessi Formula from the spellbooks on hand. While doing so, they are visited by Blade, who has important intel on The Structure, but ultimately betrays the sorcerers when it is revealed he was possessed by Varnae, the first vampire.\n\nBlade stabs Strange and then turns him, ensuring that Clea will not use the Montessi Formula if she were able to devise it, so as not to kill her true love. After Blade leaves, Clea uses her magic to remove Strange's astral form from the snarling vampire he has become so that they may continue to work together. They meet with other New York heroes to plan their next move. Clea and Strange volunteer to visit Latveria to ask Doom how he has warded his country against the vampires.\n\nMeanwhile, the ghost of Victor Strange escaped his prison in the Sanctum and possessed Stephen's vampiric body. While terrorizing Wong, Bats communed with the Dog God, a balance to the Tiger God, who gave him enough power to exorcise Victor from Stephen's body, which also cured Stephen of its vampire curse.\n\nIn Latveria, Strange made a deal with Doom. He would rescind the title of Sorcerer Supreme to Doom so that he could properly cast a spell to breach the darkforce worldwide. Doom promised he would return the title to Strange as soon as he had saved the world, however, Doom believed there was more to do than just end Varnae's plans. Thus, Doom retained the Sorcerer Supreme title.\n\nPersonal Information\n\nPhysical Attributes\n\nHeight: 6'2\"\n\nWeight: 180 lbs.\n\nEyes: Grey\n\nHair: Black, white at temples\n\nIdentity: The general public regards Strange as an ordinary occult scholar, if not a charlatan\n\nOccupation: Sorcerer Supreme of Earth dimension, adventurer, occult consultant; former physician, neurosurgeon\n\nCitizenship: U.S.A.\n\nPlace of Birth: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nEducation: Medical doctorate, extensive sorcery training through a mixture of self-education and vast arcane lore\n\nMarital Status: Married\n\nKnown Relatives: Eugene and Beverly Strange (parents, deceased), Victor Strange (Khiron, brother, presumed deceased), Donna Strange (sister, deceased), Clea (wife), Umar and Orini (parents-in-law), Dormammu (uncle-in-law)\n\nDistinguishing Features: Strange's hands are scarred due to an accident that caused nerve damage.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nMaster Sorcerer\n\nMaster of the Mystic Arts, Doctor Strange is one of the most powerful sorcerers in the world. Dr. Strange uses mystical energy invoked upon by spells/incantations or by the power of divine beings to manipulate forces of the universe including projection of mystic energy as bolts, slashes, binds, shields, or a scattered array of energy appearing like electricity, manipulating matter and various energies (physical or spiritual) even transmutation of matter, controlling the elements, opening or sealing mystical portals to other realms, teleportation or dimensional travel, reality warping and control over dimension, seeing through or casting illusions, invisibility and intangibility through astral projection, vast mental powers such as telepathy and telekinesis, communication with the dead and spiritual entities, seeing the future or past, manipulating dreams, removing spirits or placing them back into bodies, summoning supernatural beings, or using the powers of supernatural items.\n\nMany of Doctor Strange’s powers are a function of his ability to manipulate the ambient mystical energy of the Marvel Universe. With this ability Dr. Strange can perform many functions. Commonly this is seen as energy attacks that range from low power to planet destroying, transmutation, telekinesis, teleportation, protective shields, etc. He uses this mystical energy to cast spells of a near infinite variety.\n\nDr. Strange can also channel the virtually unlimited energy of nigh-omnipotent mystical and non-mystical beings--known as Principalities--to empower his spells. This can take the form of stating what he wants to occur. This ability to be a conduit to multi-versal power sources has given rise to the phrase \"Dr. Strange is as powerful as the god he invokes\". He is quite capable of utilizing power that is considered \"black magic\", though he tends to do so only under extreme exigency. Though he rarely has, he can absorb the power of even a cosmic or semi-deity entity. Doctor Strange has a pact with Eternity possibly allowing him to live as long as the Ancient One and others before him have.\n\nDoctor Strange has been noted calling upon many sorcerous phrases invoking certain entities, usually the above-mentioned Principalities. One example:\n\n“Seven rings hath Raggador, from indigo to deepest black, Yet Oshtur grant me something more: The Crimson Bands of Cyttorak!”\n\nThis phrase for instance, would cause unbreakable magical bonds to appear, capable of constraining even the Hulk. In addition to Cyttorak and Oshtur, among the beings of power called upon by Strange are all-seeing Agamotto and hoary Hoggoth, who along with Oshtur form the triad known as the eternal Vishanti; the Seraphim; Cthon (who created the Darkhold tome); Gaia; Ikonn; Dormammu (rarely) and the hell-lord Satannish. Sometimes it appears the substance of mystical realms is invoked rather than the beings who rule over them, as when Strange summons the Flames of the Faltine (the birthplace dimension of Dormammu, but also particular energy beings who rule there). This may explain why Strange is able to call upon such evil entities as Cthon and Satannish to power certain spells, yet not be in their service.\n\nCertain beings are typically invoked for particular effects, such as Ikonn for illusions, the Seraphim for protective effects like shields and the like, Cyttorak for bindings, Agamotto for dispelling negativity and revealing the truth, etc. Other magical constructs commonly employed through such agencies are the Vapors of Valtoor, the Chains of Krakkan, and the Seven Suns of Cinnibus. Doctor Strange seems to be more so than anyone else under the favored patronage of the powerful Vishanti.\n\nMagical Artifacts\n\nThe Sorcerer Supreme possesses a formidable arsenal of magical artifacts, two of which are particularly recognizable-- the Eye of Agamotto and the Cloak of Levitation. The Eye of Agamotto is an artifact with many uses, such as vastly extending Dr. Strange's psychic abilities, inter dimensional travel, emitting a light that pierces all deception and is anathema to evil beings, serving as a protective talisman, and other feats. It can be used as an almost irresistible offensive weapon, though Strange rarely does so. Similar to Mjolnir, the Eye can only be used by those it deems as morally worthy. The Cloak of Levitation has been a third set of hands for Dr. Strange, responding to his thoughts to entangle opponents, and allowing him to fly and levitate. It is virtually indestructible and has shielded him from attacks as well.\n\nStrange also possesses the Orb of Agamotto, a sort of hyper-powerful crystal ball that allows clairvoyant perception of anywhere in any dimension or realm. Other powerful artifacts in his possession include the Book of the Vishanti, the Darkhold tome, and the Wand of Watoomb. His abode in Greenwich Village known as the Sanctum Sanctorum, both defies normal spatial law and is of such magical potency in its protections that it may be considered an artifact itself. Doctor Strange has also come into the possession of the Soul Gem in the past.\n\nSince his adventure in space, Strange has had access to a cosmic forge on Nidavellr for him to create his own magical artifacts.\n\nVariants\n\nEarth-295 What If...? X-Men: Age of Apocalypse\n\nAfter Apocalypse expanded his reign all over the world without any incarnation of the X-Men to challenge him, the Defenders rose twenty-years later to overthrow Apocalypse.\n\nDoctor Strange assisted the Defenders, but died during their ventures. The Eye of Agamotto was inherited by Brother Voodoo, who became the new Sorcerer Supreme.\n\nThrough his death, the Defenders learned the truth of their reality, which branched from mainstream reality when Legion traveled back in time and killed both Xavier and Magneto.\n\nEarth-311\n\nStephen Strange of the Marvel 1602 reality served as Queen Elizabeth I's magician and mystical adviser, taking the place of the historical figure John Dee. After long searching for the source of the unusual weather patterns threatening the world, Strange met a Watcher who revealed that the problems were due to a time rift, with the caveat that Strange could not reveal what he knew to anyone so long as he lived. Strange circumvented this restriction by communicating to his wife Clea after he was beheaded for treason by King James.\n\nEarth-1610\n\nDr. Strange of the Ultimate universe, is Dr. Stephen Strange Jr. He was raised by his mother, Clea, away from magic because it was the reason that his mother and father separated. Strange's father disappeared when he was very young, fighting the forces of evil. Stephen Jr. was approached by Wong, who knew and worked with his father. He taught Stephen the art of magic, just as he had taught his father. Stephen Jr. then appeared in TV shows as celebrity psychologist. He has the reputation of being arrogant, untrained and a womaniser.\n\nAlthough he doesn't have a doctorate degree, he is usually called Dr. Strange. His magical abilities are untested and always save the day almost accidentally. He eventually joined Daredevil's Ultimate Knights to bring down the Kingpin. Strange was killed by Dormammu in the Ultimatum Wave, when he attempted to fight the elder demon with little in the way of preparation or ability.\n\nEarth-928\n\nDr Strange on the 2099 reality is a woman who just calls herself Strange. Secretly, she shares her body with a demon and is no adept with the use of magic, and in one incident, she accidentally killed her brother.\n\nEarth-982\n\nAfter serving as Sorcerer Supreme for several decades, Dr. Strange is retired and the title of Sorcerer Supreme has been passed to the younger Doc Magus. However, that has not kept Dr. Strange from helping Doc Magus on several occasions or teaming up with his former allies in the Defenders such as Namor and the Hulk. He continues to be a type of mentor to Doc Magus, even though Magus doesn't want his help.\n\nEarth-691\n\nDr. Strange has taken the title of the Ancient One. Due to Dr. Strange of the 616 universe traveling through the Dark Dimension to help Major Victory of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Dormammu escaped to the 691 universe, amplifying his power in the process.\n\nAs the Ancient One, Strange faced Dormammu and underestimated his opponent. Strange met his fate and died at the hands of his great enemy in Guardians of the Galaxy vol.1 #36. Dormammu was defeated by the Sorcerer Supreme of that reality - Krugarr - who was assisted by his pupil Talon. Strange's amulet was given to Talon and Krugarr took Strange's physical body and laid it to rest.\n\nEarth-1298\n\nDr. Strange of the Mutant X reality was the Man-Thing. In lifting the curse from Ted Sallis, the powers and appearance of Man-Thing transferred to Strange. Strange is brought into the battle with the Goblin Queen alongside Yellowjacket, Doc Samson and Stingray. By all accounts, once the battle is over, the group stay together as the Defenders, and Strange is not seen again until the Goblin Queen, disguised as the Beyonder, attacks the Six and the X-Men.\n\nWith most of the heroes of the world decimated. Strange protected the members of the Six, and Havok, until he was able to amount a suitable counter attack, and ultimately, defeat her.\n\nEarth-9997\n\nDoctor Strange of Earth X was killed by his wife, Clea, while he was in the astral form. She became the Sorceress Supreme and was having an affair with the Asgardian god of mischief, Loki. He helped Captain Marvel in his astral form in the realm of the dead as one of the heroes aware of Mar-Vell's death.\n\nEarth-721\n\nThe Earth-A version is not magically powered and once impersonated the Dr. Strange of the mainstream universe when he came in earth-616. He was finally caught as the impostor when he couldn't come up with a word that rhyme with \"Cyttorak\".\n\nEarth-2149\n\nIn the Marvel Zombiverse Doctor Strange is one of the last heroes that is not infected with the zombie plague. They were assembled by Nick Fury in the Helicarrier to carry out an offensive against the zombified heroes. He is seen as one of the zombies that attack Doctor Doom's castle. He was later killed by Magneto when he rained down Strange with cars.\n\nLarval Universe\n\nDoctor Strange is a crocodile named Croctor Strange.\n\nAmalgam Universe\n\nIn this reality, Doctor Strange is combined with Professor X and Doctor Fate to bring out Dr. Strangefate. As one of the strongest beings in the Amalgam reality, and the creator of the altered world, he attempts to prevent Access from returning the two universes to their natural existence, however, even he was unable to prevent it from happening. It was later revealed that he had remained hidden in Strange's subconscious. He attempted to combine the two realities again, but Strange prevented this by allowing the Amalgam universe to exist within it's own pocket dimension.\n\nBullet Points\n\nInstead of seeking the Ancient One in Tibet, Strange goes to SHIELD to help restore his hands. He later worked with them and had claws similar to Wolverine.\n\nExiles\n\nIn some reality, Strange is an accomplished physician whose specialty is on super humans and does not practice magic. He was killed by Deadpool of Weapon X.\n\nMarvel Mangaverse\n\nIn this reality, Doctor Strange is still the master of the mystic arts and is the rival of Baron Mordo. However, his studies take him into a much more scientific pursuit of magic. When the Hulk faces off against the agents of HYDRA and Namor, in the Mangaverse, Strange uses his abilities to not only banish Mordo from the realms, but to help his fellow heroes in summoning Thor, to defeat the Hulk. After the world settles from the Hulk Event, Strange assists the remaining living Avengers in defeating the Black Panther's sister, Shuri, who was posing as Doctor Doom. Strange is assisted by Tigra.\n\nHouse of M\n\nIn this reality, Strange is a psychologist who attempts to help the Sentry with his mental issues. He doesn't appear to be particularly engaged, or competent as a psychologist.\n\nAge of X\n\nIn this reformed version of reality, Doctor Strange purports to be a Mutant Hunter. He works with the US Government as an independent agent, apparently hunting and killing Mutants. However, he is secretly working for Magneto, and instead of killing the Mutants, he transports them to Fortress X, where they live in \"relative\" safety.\n\nOther Media\n\nTelevision\n\nSpider-Man and His Amazing Friends\n\nDoctor Strange appeared in the episode \"7 Little Superheroes.\" In this episode, the Chameleon tricks Captain America, Shanna the She-Devil, Dr. Strange, Sub-Mariner, Spider-Man, Iceman, and Firestar in order to defeat them all one by one.
