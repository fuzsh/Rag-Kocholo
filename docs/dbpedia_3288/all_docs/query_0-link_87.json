        "text": "Featuring: Fantastic Four\n\nRelease: April 12, 1966\n\nCover: July 1966\n\n12 cents\n\nScript by: Smilin’ Stan Lee\n\nArt by: Jolly Jackie Kirby\n\nInking by: Gentleman Joe Sinnott\n\nLettering by: Hammy Sammy Rosen\n\n20 pages\n\nThe time has come for the Black Panther to stalk once more!\n\nI’m going to repeat something I’ve been saying for the last year’s worth of Fantastic Four stories: just how impressive this moment in time is. What they accomplish in four consecutive stories arcs is unparalleled in comics history. Unprecedented and unequalled. To introduce the Inhumans, then have that story bleed into introducing Galactus and the Silver Surfer, then have that story bleed into the seminal “This Man This Monster”, to then immediately follow that up with the introduction of the Black Panther. Next issue will introduce the villainous Klaw and tell the origin of the Black Panther.\n\nThat’s a run of 10 incredibles issues. This run was preceded by the famous wedding, which was preceded by an epic three-part battle with the Frightful Four, which was preceded by one of their most iconic battles against Dr. Doom over the previous two issues…\n\nThe comic has been on fire with a sustained level of quality no other comic series has ever reached.\n\nIt can’t last forever. Fantastic Four #54 is a solid but ultimately forgettable comic. Though the stretch of stories that follow is also excellent, on par with anything except this incredible 10-issue stretch.\n\nLet’s dive into the story without further hyperbolic build-up, and then we’ll take some time at the end to reflect on this new character we’ve just met, the Black Panther.\n\nContinue reading “Fantastic Four #52”\n\nFeaturing: Fantastic Four\n\nRelease: February 10, 1966\n\nCover: May 1966\n\n12 cents\n\nScript: Stan Lee\n\nArt: Jack Kirby\n\nInks: Joe Sinnott\n\nLettering: S. Rosen\n\n20 pages\n\nMaster! For the first time I realize the dread enormity of what you plan to do! You must not tamper with other worlds! You cannot destroy the entire human race!\n\nWould you hesitate to tread upon an ant hill? These creatures are of no consequence to Galactus!\n\nThese are not ants, Master! They think… they feel… they have even created the primitive civilization which we see all about us!\n\nMaster! Say we may leave this world! My heart grieves at battling one with whom I shared… a universe!\n\nYou speak of me as though I am a monster! Do not the humans themselves slay the lesser beasts for food… for sustenance? Galactus does no less!\n\nGalactus is not evil! He is above good.. or evil! He does what he must… for he is Galactus!\n\nEmulate the Watcher! Stand and observe! Try to fathom the cataclysmic forces which have been unleashed! For you shall never see their like again!\n\nLong have I cherished the stumbling, bumbling, but always aspiring human race!\n\nConsider the courage they display! Though they are still in their infancy, you must not disdain them! Did not your race… and mine… evolve from such humble beginnings? Do they not possess the seed of grandeur within their frail, human frames?\n\nAnd at last I perceive the glint of glory within the race of man! Be ever worthy of that glory, humans… be ever mindful of your promise of greatness! …For it shall one day lift you beyond the stars.. or bury you within the ruins of war!! The choice is yours!!\n\nGenerally, my plan is to pick a single quote from each issue to open these posts. I cheated last issue and am doing so again this issue. Too many great quotes. Also too many great images.\n\nThis isn’t the worst cover we’ve seen, but it is the most disappointing. Compare it to the awesome first page.\n\nThat’s a cool image. But the cover? No Galactus? The FF just as floating heads? Just a shot of the Silver Surfer. With the corner of the cover devoted to Johnny at college? What?\n\nNotice they seem to have gotten the coloring of Galactus basically right now. Purple over red, wearing pants. Still bare arms, but that’s fine. Third time’s the charm. Here’s how it looks in the digital version with modern coloring.\n\nI think the conclusion of the Galactus saga is excellent, but the structuring of this issue is again weird. To appreciate that, I’d like to peek ahead a few pages.\n\nRecall where we were. Galactus is about to destroy the entire world in order to convert its resources into energy to feed himself. His herald has been convinced by Alicia that human life matters, so Silver Surfer has decided for the first time in countless eons to defy his master. Meanwhile, the Human Torch has journeyed across the universe to the giant space station that is Galactus’ home, to find the one weapon that may yet save them.\n\nWith all that to wrap up ahead of us, this is page 15.\n\nWe meet Coach Thorpe, who is very concerned his college football team is performing poorly. And his star quarterback is giving him attitude.\n\nI cannot even begin to explain the surreality of the contrast between the first and fifteenth page of this comic.\n\nMaybe it will make sense as we go on.\n\nIt won’t.\n\nContinue reading “Fantastic Four #50”\n\nFeaturing: Fantastic Four\n\nRelease: December 12, 1965\n\nCover: March 1966\n\n12 cents\n\nStan Lee, writer without peer!\n\nJack Kirby, penciller of the year!\n\nJoe Sinnott, inker most sincere!\n\nArtie Simek, how’d he get in here!\n\n20 pages\n\nMy journey is ended! This planet shall sustain me until it has been drained of all elemental life! So speaks Galactus!\n\nThere’s a lot going on in this issue, and a lot to say. So we’ll break it into sections.\n\nThe end of the Inhumans saga\n\nWe were reading the Inhumans saga in Fantastic Four #44–47. And it wasn’t done. Maximus, the mad would-be king of the Inhumans, was just about to wipe out all humanity with his weapon.\n\nDespite this cliffhanger, we left the saga behind to check in on the rest of the Marvel Universe. We’ve read 70 other stories over the 9 months since we left ourselves hanging. The story concludes this issue. Prior to issue 44, the longest FF saga was 3 parts in the previous 3 issues, #41–43, clocking in at 60 pages. Before that, the longest FF saga was the 2-part #39–40, clocking in at 40 pages.\n\nWe’ve already ready 4 issues and 80 pages of the Inhumans arc, and we’re not done! Here we are on the 5th issue. Since this issue is another 20 pages, does that mean it’s a 100-page long saga?\n\nI would say no. I would put it at about 86.7 pages.\n\nThat’s right. There are less than 7 pages left.\n\nThe Fantastic Four have found the Great Refuge within the Andes. Black Bolt wants them to leave immediately. Reed wants Black Bolt to stop hiding from humanity. Crystal and Johnny want each other.\n\nAnd Maximus… he fires his “atmo-gun”, which will send vibrations that only affect humans into the air, leaving the Inhumans the rulers of the world.\n\nAnd the resolution of this apocalyptic moment?\n\nContinue reading “Fantastic Four #48”\n\nFeaturing: Fantastic Four\n\nRelease: August 10, 1965\n\nCover: November 1965\n\n12 cents\n\nDreamed up by: Stan Lee\n\nSketched down by: Jack Kirby\n\nInked in by: Joe Sinnott\n\nLettered around by: S. Rosen\n\n20 pages\n\nI’ve had enough of this domestic bliss bit! Hanging around here is like being on the set of Ozzie and Harriet!\n\n“The world’s greatest comic magazine!” That’s what is says on the cover. Despite being a comic not as good as the company’s own Dr. Strange or Spider-Man stories. But it’s always been one of Marvel’s best comics and has gotten continually better. We’ve noted assorted leaps forward in quality, such as in issues 13, 29, 35, 36, 38, 39… At some point, we enter into the great era of Fantastic Four. And if we weren’t there already, we’re definitely there now.\n\nOne missing ingredient was Joe Sinnott on inks. Often cited as Kirby’s best inker. He’s not entirely new, as he inked the introduction of Dr. Doom back in issue 5. He’d also been the regular artist on Thor for a bit, but did a pretty terrible job. He later recalled in interviews that he hadn’t realized at the time anybody expected these comics to be good. He took the Thor assignment as a job to churn out some disposable work. He seems to take this Fantastic Four assignment more seriously.\n\nWhy are Joe’s inks special?\n\nContinue reading “Fantastic Four #44”\n\nFeaturing: Fantastic Four\n\nRelease: May 11, 1965\n\nCover: August 1965\n\n12 cents\n\nStory by: Stan Lee, who has never lost his touch!\n\nArt by: Jack Kirby, who has never lost his magic!\n\nInking by: Vince Colletta, who has never lost his flair!\n\nLettering by: Sam Rosen, who has never lost Artie Simek!\n\n20 pages\n\nYou did this to me, Richards!! You turned me into somethin’ so ugly that they can only call me… a Thing!\n\nI appreciate that they use Ben’s real name in the title, rather than his superhero name. It adds a certain something, though I suspect Stan did it for alliterative purposes: brutal, betrayal, Ben.\n\nNotice this picks up right where the last issue left off, so no time has passed. Yet we’ve read 7 other comics in the meantime. The idea is all this stuff is happening close to concurrently.\n\nBen had been turned human again, but Reed felt they needed him to be super strong again to defeat Dr. Doom, so without permission, Reed fired a ray to turn him back into the Thing.\n\nBen is justifiably angry and quitting the Fantastic Four.\n\nContinue reading “Fantastic Four #41”\n\nFeaturing: Fantastic Four\n\nRelease: March 11, 1965\n\nCover: June 1965\n\n12 cents\n\nSplendiforious story by: Stan Lee\n\nDelectable drawings by: Jack Kirby\n\nDeliciious Delineation by: Frank Ray\n\nLaconic lettering by: Artie Simek\n\n20 pages\n\nI don’t normally post things on Sundays, so I had planned this for Monday. But today is April 10, 2022. And it just seemed too fitting not to post this today, in honor of the introduction of Dr. Doom, April 10, 1962. Here’s the post we did on his introduction almost 3 years ago.\n\nSo, happy birthday to the greatest comic book villain of all time. Let’s celebrate by reading his first truly great battle against the Fantastic Four, still one of the greatest Dr. Doom stories ever.\n\nJust don’t mention his age to him. He’ll probably kill you. He can be a bit vain.\n\nAfter a battle with the Frightful Four, the Fantastic Four were caught in a Q-bomb explosion and left for dead in the middle of the ocean. When we last saw them, it appeared as though Ben was turning human again.\n\nTo me, that’s a good excuse to jump straight to the next issue where they are getting dragged out of the water.\n\nBut we didn’t do that. We read another 35 comics in between the two. Why? Well, a lot was happening all at once. While they were still at sea, the Frightful Four showed up in Thor’s comic during the Trial of the Gods. That’s a whole thing. That tied into this Daredevil/Sub-Mariner battle as well as to this milestone Avengers issue where a new team of Avengers formed. That spun out of an X-Men story which happened before Human Torch showed up in the pages of X-Men. It’s tightly connected.\n\nObviously, the FF couldn’t be at sea that many days without the submarine finding them. They need water at some point. But it could have taken a bit of time to get back to their headquarters. And all the other superhero adventures must have elapsed in that time.\n\nFrank Giacoia is the credited inker (under the pen name Frank Ray), but Wally Wood was brought in to ink Daredevil specifically, to ensure consistency with Daredevil’s look across the books.\n\nContinue reading “Fantastic Four #39”\n\nFeaturing: Fantastic Four\n\nRelease: December 10, 1964\n\nCover: March 1965\n\n12 cents\n\nProudly produced by: Smilin’ Stan Lee and Jolly Jack Kirby\n\nInked by: Chic Stone\n\nLettered by: Artie Simek\n\n21 pages\n\nThe main credits are shared between Stan and Jack without specifying who did what.\n\nFantastic Four has been one of the best of these Marvel superhero titles since the start, but it’s regarded as one of the best comic series ever, which hasn’t yet been obvious. The series gets better at some point. It can be hard to pinpoint the exact point of transition. We noted issue 29 when Kirby started using photo collages as a step toward greatness. The introduction of the Frightful Four in this issue also suggests we are well down the path. Particularly the mysterious Madam Medusa.\n\nSue and Reed announced their engagement last issue. They’ve now made a public announcement, and the press is excited, underscoring their celebrity status. There will be a big engagement party this issue.\n\nAlso, I think Sue’s gotten a haircut. Her hair definitely seems shorter.\n\nContinue reading “Fantastic Four #36”"
