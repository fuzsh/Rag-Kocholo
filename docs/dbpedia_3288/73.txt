When the first Saturday of May rolls around, comic book nerds rejoice as their favorite authors and illustrators give sustenance to the committed yet dwindling market that is comic books. While most people tend to think of comic books as nothing more than a medium to tell more superhero stories, such as Spider-Man or Invincible, just about any story can be told through colorful, action-packed panels. With examples such as Sonic The Hedgehog, Chew, and The Ice-Cream Man (trust me, it's a lot freakier than the name implies), comics can be full of surprises.

Unsurprisingly, Star Wars has had its share of comic books, each with different stories, characters, and new views on the universe as a whole adding to the ever-growing lore of the far reaches of the galaxy. Recently, some new mock-ups have been released to the public, showing the splash pages for two new Star Wars comic books.

The second comic book, which will be published by Marvel Comics, features a painted cover, with a split of Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker. For those who haven't seen Star Wars, this can be seen as a spoiler, but for fans of the franchise, this cover makes them aware of what to possibly expect from a story. Perhaps a deeper dive into the transition from Skywalker to Vader? We can only wait to find out.

For all of the Star Wars fans who are antsy about what is inside these comics, they'll have to wait until Free Comic Book Day. Fittingly, it will arrive in 2024 on May 4th, and they won't even have to pay a single credit for it!
