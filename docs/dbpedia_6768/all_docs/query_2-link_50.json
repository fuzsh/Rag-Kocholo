        "text": "One of the most popular Disney Channel shows of the early 2000s was Phil of the Future. Young fans were captivated by the Diffy family as they navigated 21st-century life after their time machine suddenly broke down. With the Diffy’s time machine struggles, let’s hope we have better luck as we travel back to the early 2000s to discuss Phil of the Future and uncover more about the stars of the show, Aly Michalka and Ricky Ullman — along with the time they spent secretly dating.\n\nThe Diffy family was on vacation from the 22nd century\n\nAs the Phil of the Future theme song says, the Diffy family were “on vacation from the 22nd century” when their time machine suddenly broke down in the year 2004. According to IMDb, Phil Diffy, the main character of the show, was written to have been born in the year 2107. Phil’s little sister Pim, played by Amy Bruckner, was said to have been born in 2109. Their parents, Lloyd and Barb, born in the 2070s, were of little help when it came to navigating life in 2004. Therefore, Phil and Pim often had to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThe Diffy kids seemed to grasp life in the early 2000s a bit better than their parents as they were thrown into public school and learned quickly from their peers. One of Phil’s best friends and later love interest is Keely Teslow, played by Aly Michalka. Keely was born in 1990, and she’s your typical kid from the early 2000s. Phil of the Future ran for two seasons on Disney Channel. Toward the end of the second season, Phil and Keely finally confessed their feelings for each other. However, shortly after the pair begin dating, Lloyd gets the time machine back up and running. Fans were left with a bit of a cliffhanger when the series ended in 2006. However, it is presumed that the Diffy family decided to stay in the 21st century.\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed, as Phil and Keely were falling for each other onscreen, the actors who played them were falling for each other offscreen. The Phil of the Future costars Aly Michalka and Ricky Ullman actually dated for six years, well after the ending of the show. The young couple began dating in 2005, right in the middle of filming for Phil of the Future.\n\nMichalka and Ullman were both teens when they started dating in 2005. Their relationship carried on for the next six years, into their early 2010s. They officially called it quits in 2011. Throughout their six-year relationship, neither had publicly discussed the nature of their relationship. Therefore, fans had no idea the pair even dated until well after their 2011 breakup.\n\nWhat happened to Michalka and Ullman’s careers after ‘Phil of the Future‘?\n\nNow, 10 years after their breakup and 15 years since the ending of Phil of the Future, Ricky Ullman and Aly Michalka’s lives have taken them in different directions. Ullman is now 35, and according to IMDb, he has landed quite a few small acting gigs since the end of Phil of the Future. While Ullman has mostly stuck with acting since his days on Disney Channel, Michalka has gone in a different direction."
