        "text": "Schooled | Wednesday, 8:30 p.m., ABC\n\nIf anyone can appreciate the struggles faced by Lainey, the failed singer who reluctantly returns to teach music at her old high school on “Schooled,” it’s AJ Michalka. In real life, AJ, 27, and her big sister Aly, 29, have nabbed accolades, gold and platinum records and an American Music Award nomination as a pop-music duo. But doubts still creep in. “There was a time when I did not feel confident in our music, and I think Lainey has felt that way most of her life,” said AJ, who stars in “The Goldbergs” spinoff. “You go through a lull and find yourself in a writer’s block. Those things translate between character and real life.”\n\nThe sisters still record and tour — they hosted a sold-out show at the Gramercy Theater this past June — in between acting gigs, which now include AJ’s role and Aly’s part as Peyton Charles on the CW’s “iZombie.” In this week’s episode of “Schooled,” stylish Lainey offers to give a makeover to an awkward pupil.\n\nAJ recently spoke to The Post about Lainey’s challenges, her “Goldbergs” co-star Wendi McLendon-Covey, and what she thinks of the ’90s alcoholic beverage Zima.\n\nWhat’s the hardest part of going from student to teacher for Lainey?\n\nShe feels like one of the students. She’s still figuring out who she is as an adult. This job feels temporary and then she realizes it is not. She’s there to help these kids figure out what they want to do with their lives as musicians, and I didn’t necessarily have that. Her place at William Penn is a lot more deeply rooted than she thought.\n\nHave you ever considered teaching?\n\nI’ve thought about it because I love kids. I love the teacher-student relationship. It’s underplayed in society. What teachers are doing is heroic.\n\nYou have more lines than on “The Goldbergs.” How do you like that?\n\nI’m channeling Wendi as much as I can. She is my comedy mentor. She’s been on “The Goldbergs” for six years and she knows exactly what she’s doing. I hope I can lead with as much comedy and grace.\n\nYou sang on “The Goldbergs.” Will you also perform on “Schooled”?\n\nWhen it works for a storyline, I would love that — and [creator] Adam [Goldberg] knows. Right now, it makes sense that as a teacher she’s guiding these kids to find their own voice and kind of taking a back seat. But eventually I think she’ll have her big star performance because that’s just how Lainey is.\n\nYou were born in 1991. What do you think of the show’s ’90s references to Nirvana, “Saved By the Bell” and Michael Jordan?\n\nThere’s a lot of references to film, music and TV and especially how we dress — it’s full-on ’90s fashion and I loved the ’90s. You’re gonna get a piece of that every episode. Episode 10 is gonna be — I can’t say more — it’s an ode to a comedy that came out then. We’re gonna capitalize off a film that people love.\n\nIn last week’s episode there was a reference to the ’90s alcoholic drink Zima. Have you tried it?\n\nI have. I think it’s disgusting. [Laughs.] It’s not my drink of choice — that’s Mike’s Hard Lemonade. But I think it’s a really funny moment in the episode because Lainey catches one of her students basically pulling a move that she used to pull. It’s a sweet wink to Lainey’s past as a kid.\n\n— Eric Hegedüs\n\nAnd here’s what else to watch this week:\n\nThe Grand Tour | Friday, Amazon\n\nSeries premiere. Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May of “Top Gear” fame return to tour the world in this show about adventure and friendship — as long as you accept that your friends are often annoying. Sometimes “The Grand Tour” is even about cars.\n\nA Million Little Things | Thursday, 9 p.m., ABC\n\nDelilah (Stephanie Szostak) finds herself leaning on her friends in order to help her family, unexpectedly relying on Katherine (Grace Park), whom she betrayed.\n\nTrue Detective | Sunday, 9 p.m., HBO\n\nSeason premiere. It’s been four years since the last season of “True Detective” bombed. Mahershala Ali plays an Arkansas detective who revisits painful memories when a cold case is reopened. As is typical of this bro-fest, there is only one actress — Carmen Ejogo — with a prominent role in the cast.\n\nDirty John | Sunday, 10 p.m., Bravo\n\nSeason finale. John (Eric Bana) meets his maker in a parking lot. With Connie Britton and Julia Garner.\n\nThe Passage | Monday, 9 p.m., Fox\n\nSeries premiere. With a flu epidemic threatening the US, Federal Agent Brad Wolgast (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) brings in secret medical facility Project Noah’s latest test subject, 1o-year-old Amy Bellafonte (Saniyya Sidney) for a special consulation.\n\nThis Is Us | Tuesday, 9 p.m., NBC\n\nRandall’s (Sterling K. Brown) campaign comes to a close. Meanwhile, Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Toby (Chris Sullivan) get ready for the baby. With Justin Hartley.\n\nRoswell, New Mexico | Tuesday, 9 p.m., The CW"
