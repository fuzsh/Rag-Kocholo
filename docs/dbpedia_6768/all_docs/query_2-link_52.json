        "text": "Netflix added 7.4 million new customers to its streaming service in the first quarter, besting the company's projection that it would add 6.35 million on a worldwide basis, the company said Monday.\n\nNetflix's growth in the quarter was due mostly to its expansion into foreign markets, as it added 5.46 million international subscribers while analysts expected roughly 5.02 million.\n\nNetflix posted $3.7 billion in revenue, just slightly ahead of the projections of analysts. Adjusted earnings per-share of 64 cents was about what Wall Street had projected.\n\nNetflix shares slipped 1 percent during the regular session on Monday, but have risen about 35 percent in the past three months. After the closing bell, the shares were soaring higher by as much as 8 percent.\n\nNetflix intends on spending $8 billion on content this year as it faces competition from Amazon.com, Hulu and a plethora of other streamers, not to mention it also competes with traditional cable and broadcast television nowadays.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, CEO Reed Hastings boasted that 43 percent revenue growth year-over-year was \"the fastest pace in the history of our streaming business.\"\n\nOnly about $100 million of Netflix's total revenue came from its legacy DVD-by-mail business.\n\n\"Our 125 million members provided us with $3.6 billion in streaming revenue in Q1. Our job is to spend this money wisely to increase our members' delight,\" Hastings wrote.\n\n\"Last year, we expanded our efforts in original programming to unscripted shows across several genres,\" the exec continued. \"Our output in this area is now comparable to similarly-focused U.S. domestic cable networks. Shows like Queer Eye and Nailed It are great examples of our ambitions in this area: engaging, buzz-worthy shows that drive lots of enjoyment around the world.\"\n\nHastings also wrote that while content deals with Ryan Murphy, Shonda Rhimes, Shawn Levy and Jenji Kohan \"are a substantial investment for us, they allow us to work directly with prolific and talented creators with a proven track record of success.\"\n\nHe also boasted of the addition of Susan Rice, the former national security advisor and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to the Netflix board of directors, which was a controversial move in some circles.\n\n\"As a global company operating in over 190 countries, Susan's expertise in international affairs will be valuable,\" Hastings wrote.\n\nDuring a question-and-answer forum after Netflix released its quarterly earnings Monday, Hastings said the service's \"breadth of content is really remarkable.\"\n\nIn the same session, chief content officer Ted Sarandos said that Netflix will not get into streaming news, though it will expand its offerings of topical interview shows like My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman. Sarandos, though, had no comment on whether former President Barack Obama might be hosting such a show in the future, beyond saying negotiations are still proceeding.\n\nSarandos said the latest season of 13 Seasons Why, a mystery about a high school student who takes her own life, was perhaps the most popular show in the world last year.\n\nOn the movie side, Netflix has released more than 30 films theatrically, and more are to come, Sarandos said.\n\nProlific producers Eric and Kim Tannenbaum are leaving broadcast's studio system.\n\nThe married producing duo have exited their deal with CBS Television Studios, their home of nearly a decade, for a first-look, overall pact with studio Lionsgate Television. Sources say the duo's deal with the studio was up and the split was amicable.\n\nUnder the pact, the Tannenbaums will create scripted programming through their Tannenbaum Co. banner.\n\nThe Tannenbaums first arrived at CBS Television Studios in 2010, signing a three-year overall deal with CBS' studio counterpart. Under the agreement, they executive produced network hits including Chuck Lorre's Two and a Half Men (which ran for 12 seasons), The Odd Couple reboot (two seasons) and short-lived entries Rob and We Are Men, among others. More recently, the duo have been focused on cable, with Freeform's Young and Hungry set to end this year after five seasons (with a movie in development) and TV Land's half-hour Impastor, which ran for two season. They currently exec produce Tracy Morgan's FX-turned-TBS comedy The Last OG and are attached to serve in the same capacity on the studio's Arnold Schwarzenegger bodybuilding drama Pump (which has yet to land at a network).\n\n\"We're delighted to partner with Eric and Kim, two of the most gifted and prolific television producers in the industry,\" Lionsgate Television Group chairman Kevin Beggs said Monday in a statement. \"They have shepherded a roster of iconic series and we look forward to working together.\"\n\nBefore signing with CBS TV Studios, the duo were partners with Mitch Hurwitz (Arrested Development) and worked for his Tantamount production company when it was based at Sony Pictures Television Studios. When that deal expired, the Tannenbaums and Hurwitz split and the former struck out on their own. Eric Tannenbaum previously served as founder and president of Artists Television Group, president of Columbia TriaStar Television and exec vp TV at New World Entertainment. During his time at TriStar, he worked on series including Mad About You, The Nanny, The King of Queens and more.\n\n\"We're thrilled to join Kevin, [Lionsgate TV Group president] Sandra [Stern], [executive vp worldwide scripted TV] Chris [Selak] and the rest of the Lionsgate team,\" the Tannenbaums said in a joint statement. \"Their television business is perfectly aligned with our own approach to creating great programming in an entrepreneurial and talent-friendly environment, and we can hardly wait to contribute to one of the most exciting slates in the industry today.\"\n\nRepped by CAA and Del Shaw, the Tannenbaums become the latest producers to exit broadcast's traditional studio system. In recent months, prolific producers Ryan Murphy (Glee, American Crime Story) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey's Anatomy, Scandal) have exited their longtime homes at 20th Century Fox Television and ABC Studios, respectively, in favor of nine-figure overall deals with Netflix.\n\nWhile not on that same scale, the Tannenbaums bring decades of experience in comedy with them to Lionsgate Television as the company grows its scripted programming roster. The studio recently signed a first-look TV deal with Paul Feig (Freaks and Geeks, Bridesmaids); Power showrunner Courtney Kemp; Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz (Nashville); Joel Silver; and John Goldwyn, among others. Lionsgate TV also had an overall deal with Jenji Kohan, who departed last year for Netflix after delivering hits including Weeds and Orange Is the New Black.\n\nThe Tannenbaums exit CBS TV Studios as the David Stapf-led studio is making a sizable expansion into cable and streaming. To that end, earlier this month it hired Storied Media Group's Whitney Berry to oversee development for cable and streaming. The studio recently landed a Netflix series order for the Liz Feldman comedy Dead to Me, which joins American Vandal, the Susannah Grant/Katie Couric-produced limited series Unbelievable and the Debby Ryan starrer Insatiable at the streaming giant (the latter of which moved to Netflix after The CW passed on the pilot last season). All told, CBS TV Studios has 13 scripted series set up at various premium cable and streaming networks (be they in development or on the air).\n\nABC is expanding the world of The Goldbergs.\n\nThe Disney-owned network has handed out a 13-episode series order for the 1990s-set spinoff formerly known as Schooled. Additionally, former Goldbergs series regular AJ Michalka, who plays Barry's (Troy Gentile) ex-girlfriend, Lainey, has joined the cast of the untitled project, which has been retooled after original star Nia Long was no longer available. (Long is a series regular on CBS' NCIS: L.A.) The series will air during the 2018-19 broadcast season and follow the teachers of William Penn Academy — led by Tim Meadows' Principal Glascott, Bryan Callen's Coach Mellor and Michalka's Lainey Lewis — who, despite their eccentricities and crazy personal lives, are heroes to their students.\n\nThe Goldbergs spinoff had a unique path to the screen. Created by Goldbergs showrunner Adam F. Goldberg and Marc Firek, the spinoff starring Callen and Meadows landed at ABC with a script commitment in November 2016 and was picked up to pilot in February 2017. Long was set to star in the single-camera comedy about two teachers (Callen and Meadows) who become unlikely father figures to the kids at their Philadelphia school. The original pilot revolved around Glascott, now the principal, and his sister (Long), who sends her two teenage daughters (Rachel Crow, Summer Parker) to the high school where she winds up teaching.\n\nGoldberg, Firek and Doug Robinson are executive producing the spinoff, whose original pilot was directed by Jay Chandrasekhar (The Goldbergs) and written by Firek. Firek, who has been with The Goldbergs since its start, came up with the new take for the spinoff that helped get the green light from ABC. The pickup for the spinoff comes as Sony Pictures Television Studios continues to fight for shows they believe in. Robinson also played a big role in helping to fight for the project.\n\nThe spinoff narrowly missed a series pickup at ABC last May, with producers Sony Pictures Television Studios — where Goldberg is under an overall deal — determined to find it a new home. (Hulu was said to be interested at the time, but a deal was never reached.) Goldberg — who has hours of home-movie footage from his childhood in both the 1980s and '90s — believed in the premise and persuaded ABC to air the pilot as a special episode of The Goldbergs. (Star Wendi McLendon-Covey guest-starred, even though her kids already graduated from the school in the '80s.) The original pilot cast included Missi Pyle and Ana Gasteyer.\n\n\"Last spring, the '90s spinoff tested higher than the Goldbergs pilot, so I certainly had high hopes for the project,\" Goldberg told The Hollywood Reporter in January. \"[CBS' already-renewed] Young Sheldon has proven that fans are very loyal and will watch a spinoff, so we are hopeful that we make a real splash when it airs so we can begin the conversation again about getting this on the air.\"\n\nABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey told THR in January that she was hopeful the spinoff would get a second chance at the network. \"I'm excited because there were so many things about the pilot that I really loved and I'm excited to share that with audiences. After that, we'll see what happens,\" she said. \"We have one more season of The Goldbergs. The show is doing really well for us. At the moment, I'm hopeful we have more down the road. I'm excited to see how [the spinoff] plays and what the audience's response to it is.\"\n\nThe backdoor pilot aired Jan. 24 as \"The Goldbergs: 1990-Something,\" scoring 6 million viewers (off 7 percent from the week prior) and a 1.7 among adults 18-49 and rating as the night's most-watched show in the advertiser-coveted demographic. That helped fuel the discussion about a series order.\n\nThe Goldbergs is already renewed for the 2018-19 broadcast season (its sixth season overall), though it's unclear if that will be the show's final run. Sources say it could conceivably run beyond that, though Goldberg already knows how the series will likely end.\n\n\"The last episode is Adam's [Sean Giambrone] high school graduation, which marks the end of his childhood,\" Goldberg told THR in an October feature pegged to the show's 100th episode. \"I'd love to go beyond season six, but it will always be set in the '80s. We have yet to run out of any videos of mine, and there's just so much from that decade I love. And I don't want to set it in the '90s because I hope that one day that will be the spinoff of some sort.\"\n\nFor her part, Michalka has played Lainey, best friend to Erica Goldberg (Hayley Orrantia) and former girlfriend to Barry on the flagship. She recurred in seasons one and two before being promoted to regular for three and four. She has popped in from time to time during the show's current fifth season. Her film credits include Super 8 and The Lovely Bones. Michalka is repped by Gersh, Primary Wave Entertainment and McKuin Frankel.\n\nThe Goldbergs spinoff arrives as ABC is heading into next season knowing it could say farewell to Modern Family and potentially the 1980s-set original. This season, the Disney-owned network will wrap veteran comedy The Middle (as well as dramas Scandal and Once Upon a Time). The Goldbergs spinoff is ABC's first new comedy series for 2018-19, joining straight-to-series dramas The Rookie (starring Nathan Fillion) and Take Two (which may air this summer). It joins a roster of returning fare including previously announced renewals for Roseanne and The Good Doctor.\n\nGoldberg is repped by WME, Circle of Confusion and attorney Bruce Gellman. Firek, whose credits also include the original Will & Grace, Mr. Sunshine and 'Til Death, is repped by UTA and Hansen Jacobson.\n\nKeep track of all the latest renewals and cancellations with THR's scorecard and of all the pilot pickups with our handy guide. For complete coverage, bookmark THR.com/upfronts.\n\nShowtime and Bad Robot are teaming again, with the pay cable network and the production company behind the short-lived Cameron Crowe dramedy Roadies partnering on a new comedy, The Wrong Mans.\n\nThe half-hour, single-camera effort — which is based on the BBC series created by and starring James Corden and Matthew Baynton — has been given a pilot production commitment by Showtime. Ben Schwartz (House of Lies) is slated to star in the new iteration, which will be written by Corden, Baynton and Ian Maxtone-Graham. Jim Field Smith is set to direct.\n\nThe Wrong Mans is an action-comedy about two ordinary office workers (one played by Schwartz) who have their menial existence turned upside-down by a chance phone call and a case of mistaken identity: “If you are not here by 5 o’clock, we will kill your wife.” As the only people who can help, these two unlikely characters must find their inner hero in their quest to save not just themselves, but their loved ones and ultimately their whole town.\n\nThe project hails from J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot and Corden's Fulwell 73 Productions, in association with BBC Studios and Warner Bros. Television. Executive producers include Abrams, Ben Stephenson, Corden, Baynton, Maxtone-Graham, Smith and BBC Studios’ Angie Stephenson. Schwartz will be a producer.\n\nThe project marks a key move for Bad Robot, which via its overall deal with Warner Bros. TV has been expanding beyond dramatic fare into more comedy of late. The company has a RuPaul dramedy in the works at Hulu, along with a Jesse Eisenberg comedy project that has yet to find a home. Bad Robot also has HBO's Westworld, which is set to return for its second season on April 22, and the upcoming Stephen King anthology series Castle Rock, due out this summer on Hulu.\n\nFor Showtime, The Wrong Mans joins the network's original comedy slate, which includes Frankie Shaw's SMILF, Shameless, I'm Dying Up Here and the upcoming Jim Carrey comedy Kidding. It's also the CBS Corp.-owned cabler's third pilot order, following the Don Cheadle comedy Ball Street and the Kevin Bacon drama City on a Hill from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen was reluctant to name one of his other clients during a Monday hearing — but, after pressure from a New York federal judge, it was revealed that mystery client is Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\nAfter his office was raided by the FBI on April 9, Cohen was ordered to appear in court before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood to rule on his request that his own attorneys be allowed to review seized documents and records — before government investigators do — to assess whether his attorney-client privilege would be implicated.\n\nHannity said Monday on his radio show that he's occasionally had \"brief discussions\" with Cohen about legal issues that he wanted \"his input and perspective on.\" But, he added, \"Michael never represented me in any matter. I never retained him in the traditional sense of retaining a lawyer. I never received an invoice from Michael.\"\n\nHannity clarified that Cohen never represented him in a matter involving a third party, and wondered why the media is blowing up the story. \"I don't think that is that complicated,\" he said. \"How did this blow up to be such a big deal?\"\n\nHannity also tweeted later on Monday, \"I assumed those conversations were confidential.\"\n\nIn a filing opposing Cohen's request to review the evidence, the government argued that there's no precedent and that Cohen has \"exceedingly few clients and a low volume of potentially privileged communications\" — and went as far as to question whether the attorney actually has any clients other than Trump.\n\nCohen, of course, is at the center of the media and legal blitz surrounding Trump's alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels. She's suing, under her legal name Stephanie Clifford, in an effort to have a \"hush agreement\" she signed declared invalid because it doesn't contain Trump's signature. The president has denied any knowledge of the contract, and Cohen has publicly stated that he personally paid Clifford $130,000 as part of the deal — shortly before the 2016 election.\n\nCohen's other known client was GOP financier Elliott Broidy — for whom he reportedly negotiated a $1.6 million payment to an ex-Playboy model — but the lawyer was hesitant to name Hannity, acknowledging that that the revelation would be embarrassing.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter has also reached out to Fox News for comment.\n\nNight Court actor Harry Anderson died Monday morning in Asheville, North Carolina, the Asheville Police Department confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. He was 65.\n\n\"This morning at 6:41 a.m. the Asheville Police Department responded to the home of actor Harry Anderson where he was found deceased,\" Asheville PD's Public Affairs officer Christina Hallingse told THR. \"No foul play is suspected.\"\n\nThe 1980s sitcom ran for nine seasons on NBC and earned seven Emmy Awards and 31 nominations, including three noms for Anderson, who starred as Judge Harry T. Stone alongside John Larroquette, who played assistant district attorney Dan Fielding.\n\nNight Court anchored NBC's early \"Must See TV” Thursday lineup, which also included The Cosby Show, Family Ties and Cheers.\n\nIn addition to his role on the NBC sitcom, Anderson also appeared on Cheers, starred as humorist Dave Barry on the 1990s show Dave's World and played Richie Tozier in the 1990 miniseries adaptation of Stephen King's It.\n\nJudd Apatow paid tribute on Monday afternoon, tweeting: \"I interviewed Harry Anderson when I was 15 years old and he was so kind, and frank and hilarious. The interview is in my book Sick In the Head. He was a one of a kind talent who made millions so happy.\"\n\nBorn on Oct. 14, 1952, in Newport, Rhode Island, Anderson was drawn to the art of magic. After moving to Los Angeles, where he graduated from Hollywood High School, Anderson practiced his skills often. He had joined the Dante Magic Club in his teens and reportedly made money as a street magician in San Francisco when he was 17.\n\nAnderson has said he never sought to be an actor.\n\n\"I did a Saturday Night Live, just a guest spot,\" Anderson told the Bradenton Herald in 2015. \"Les Charles called me and said I had beaten him out of $20 in a shell game in San Francisco.\"\n\nCharles, at the time, was producing Cheers and asked Anderson to guest-star on the show as con man Harry \"The Hat\" Gittes.\n\nHe then went on to land his most well-known role, playing Judge Stone on Night Court, which aired on NBC from 1984-92. He played the boyish judge as a wise-cracking prankster who also was an amateur magician, like Anderson himself.\n\nAnderson told the Herald that he landed the Night Court gig after producers saw him on Cheers.\n\n\"I guess they figured I was an actor,\" he said. \"I never auditioned for anything. I had the scripts next to me behind the bench. They named the character Harry so I'd remember to react when someone said my name. By the time they figured out that I couldn't act scared on the subway at 4 a.m., I already had a five-year contract.\"\n\nAnderson went on to reunite with Larroquette in a guest-starring role on The John Larroquette Show in 1996. In 2008, Anderson played himself on 30 Rock as part of a Night Court reunion of sorts alongside former co-stars Markie Post and Charles Robinson."
