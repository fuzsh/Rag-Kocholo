        "text": "VOICE OVER: Lisa Yang\n\nScript written by Savannah Sher\n\nThe girls are back! These sisters have been hard at work with other projects in the last few years. Here are Top 5 Facts bout Aly and Aj you may not know! Did you know that they both have acting careers? Aly got her start with a starring role on the Disney Channel's “Phil of the Future”, while AJ appeared in the Disney Channel Movie “Cow Belles” in 2006. They both went on to have roles in major feature films like “easy A” and “The Lovely Bones” respectively. They were briefly known as 78violet. Aly Michalka and AJ Michalka were known by the moniker “Aly & AJ” from the beginning of their careers, but in 2009 they decided to make a change. Because they were both focusing on their acting and their musical pursuits at the time, they wanted to separate their band from their on-screen credits.\n\n#5: They Were Briefly Known as 78violet\n\nAly Michalka and AJ Michalka were known by the moniker “Aly & AJ” from the beginning of their careers, but in 2009 they decided to make a change. Because they were both focusing on their acting and their musical pursuits at the time, they wanted to separate their band from their on-screen credits. This happened around the same time they split from longtime collaborators, Hollywood Records. In 2015, they went back to their roots by returning to their original name.\n\n#4: They Were the Spokeswomen for Samsung's Hope for Education\n\nBoth ladies care deeply about the causes they’re involved in, and throughout their careers have made a point of giving back to the community by becoming representatives for various charities and organizations. One of the most interesting is Hope for Education by Samsung, which Aly and AJ were the spokespeople for. The charity works to offer technologies to schools in low income areas. They have also worked with the AmberWatch Foundation along with other celebs like Selena Gomez.\n\n#3: They Don’t Want to be Seen as Christian Music Artists\n\nAly and AJ have never kept their faith a secret and they have been open about Christianity in interviews. They have released both mainstream albums, and others which have been released with a Christian rock audience in mind. They have said that while their religion does inspire their songwriting, they don’t want to be considered expressly Christian artists. While they may feel strongly about their beliefs, they’ve been very clear that converting their audience has never been their intention and that they accept fans of all faiths.\n\n#2: They Both Have Acting Careers\n\nWhile their rise to fame began with music, acting has become a big part of what both sisters do. Aly got her start with a starring role on the Disney Channel’s “Phil of the Future”, while AJ appeared in the Disney Channel Movie “Cow Belles” in 2006. They both went on to have roles in major feature films like “easy A” and “The Lovely Bones” respectively. Today, you can see each of them on separate recurring TV series. AJ plays Lainey Lewis on “The Goldbergs” while Alyson plays Peyton Charles on “iZombie”.\n\n#1: Their Influences this Time Around are Really Different\n\nConsidering how busy the two sisters have been with acting lately, it’s no surprise that they’ve hardly released any new music. However, in June of 2017 fans were thrilled to learn that the duo were going to be releasing a new album. The first single, “Take Me” has a distinctly different sound than what their listeners are used to (xref). The new sound is more modern and electronic, and Aly and AJ have cited artists like Kate Bush, Tame Impala and Beach House as influences for their latest record.\n\nComments ∧"
