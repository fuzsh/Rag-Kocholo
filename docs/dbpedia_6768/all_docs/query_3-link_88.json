She grew up with her younger sister AJ Michalka in both Southern California and Seattle, Washington. Michalka showed an early talent for music, starting to play the piano at the age of five and later the guitar when she was 13. She also acted in church play productions during her youth.\n\nTelevision Career\n\nMichalka had her career breakthrough in 2004 when she began starring on the Disney Channel sitcom \"Phil of the Future.\" She played Keely Teslow, the best friend of Raviv Ullman's titular character. \"Phil of the Future\" ran for two seasons through 2006. During the final season of the show, Michalka starred alongside her sister in the Disney Channel original film \"Cow Belles.\" The sisters starred together again in the 2007 MTV television film \"Super Sweet 16: The Movie.\" Michalka had her next major role in 2010, starring as the main character Marti Perkins in the CW cheerleading series \"Hellcats.\" She was joined in the cast by Ashley Tisdale, Robbie Jones, Matt Barr, and Heather Hemmens, among others. \"Hellcats\" ultimately lasted one season before being canceled in 2011.\n\nIn 2011, Michalka had a guest role on the police procedural series \"CSI: NY,\" and in 2012 had a guest role on the sitcom \"Breaking In.\" From 2013 to 2014, she played the recurring role of Brooke in five episodes of the sitcom \"Two and a Half Men.\" During the latter year, Michalka appeared in an episode of the sitcom \"Anger Management.\" In 2015, she began playing Peyton Charles, the best friend and roommate of Rose McIver's main character Liv, on the CW series \"iZombie.\" The series ran for five seasons through 2019.

The album featured the successful lead single \"Potential Breakup Song,\" which reached number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 to give Aly & AJ their highest-charting song.\n\nIn 2009, Aly & AJ were renamed 78violet.

In 2017, a decade after the release of \"Insomniatic,\" Aly & AJ released their first EP, \"Ten Years.\" They released their second EP, \"Sanctuary,\" in 2019.
