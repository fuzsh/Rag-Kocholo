        "text": "Chances are that if you were born in the early to mid 90s, like me, then you know who the Michalka sisters are. Maybe not by their surname, but by their nicknames: Aly & AJ. These sisters earned their fame in the glow of one of those Disney glow sticks. Alyson was on a show called Phil of the Future (you’re already humming the theme song, I know you are!) and AJ…well honestly I never saw anything she was in except for a Disney Channel movie called Cow Belles but I think that’s because I was aging out of Disney Channel at that point. Anyway, everyone knows that if you’re going to be on a Disney show you can’t just be an actor or actress. You have to be able to sing. Aly& AJ put out two albums under Hollywood Records, both albums were well received and you can be damn sure almost any 90s millennial knows the words to “Potential Breakup Song.”\n\nThese two girls grew into young women, weaving in and out of the public eye between short-lived television shows, movies, and even some critically acclaimed ones. Throughout these acting-laden years, they struggled with their love of music. They changed their band name, tried on different genre hats, talked of EPs and new albums but nothing ever materialized. They later went on to describe how the industry made them fall out of love with making music, but they made this statement as they re-introduced themselves to the world as musicians Aly & AJ.\n\nI had high expectations for the show at Upstate Concert Hall (Thursday, 05.16.19). I have loved each song they have put out since their renaissance. It is bouncy and 80s-inspired, swirling with synthesizers and vocals that have clearly seen some production. None of these are bad things. Retrowave synthpop is a genre I love, and I love that these two have evolved into it. Their voices suit it well, and their lyrics, be it happy or sad, have a good place in the genre.\n\nTheir show, while it didn’t completely live up to my expectations, didn’t disappoint me either. Honestly, I think that’s because of the production of the vocals on their albums. Of course the unadulterated raw vocals aren’t going to sound like the studio version. Most musicians don’t, especially not when they are singing through synthesizers! But they were brilliant. The audience, although not huge, was vibrant and full of energy (perhaps too much). Their light show fit the 80s theme, with neon wireless standing lights strobing at appropriate times. The sisters were looking hot af in their saturated blue and fuschia pant suits and sparkling undershirts and boots, also quite appropriate for the 80s vibe.\n\nIt was pointed out to me that I took far more photos of AJ than I did of Aly, and that is my one critique. As a photographer, it is hard to take pictures of musicians that don’t move much around the stage or are pretty stoic. AJ moved, and Aly was largely behind her synthesizer, especially during the first three songs where I was in the pit and had the most unobstructed access for photos. Additionally AJ’s face and body language is expressive, and Aly is more stoic. Neither of these are bad things or good things in a person. But as a photographer, we look for the dynamic and the lively and gravitate towards that—which evidently I did with AJ.\n\nThey played a good set list with a mix of old tunes and the newer ones. “No One,” “Like Whoa,” and “Into the Rush” were particular throwbacks that had the audience either singing, or screaming along. They intermittently provided anecdotes and encouragement to support their LGBTQ+ causes in the Trevor Project. As expected, they brought out the big gun last: “Potential Breakup Song” ended the night, and this is the one song where I was truly disappointed. Maybe they were just tired, but the vocals just weren’t there for this one. Maybe they were drowned out by the sea of concertgoers singing along with them, or maybe it was my earplugs, but I was under-impressed with their final encore.\n\nAn evening with Aly & AJ was a night well spent. It was fun and nostalgic, and I got some great photos. If you lost track of them, maybe consider giving a song from their new EP Sanctuary a go. It might just be the “potential make-up song” you need to fall in love with their sound all over again.\n\nCanon 6D MK II + Canon EF 50mm 1.8 STM\n\nCanon T6s + Canon EF 70-200 L IS II\n\nFor more photos, visit my photo page for Aly & AJ"
