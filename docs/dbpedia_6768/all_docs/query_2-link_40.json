        "text": "Childhood in Boxes\n\nThere’s an actual \"toy room\" on the set, filled with showrunner Adam F. Goldberg’s prized collection of Transformers, action figures and video games. Here, they are packed up for storage until season three begins taping this summer.\n\nMiscellaneous Electronic Games\n\nA box containing some of the hundreds of '80s toys on the set that prop masters find at garage sales, on eBay or in creator Adam F. Goldberg’s own collection.\n\nThe “Sean-tourage”\n\nSean Giambrone considers his co-stars his second brood, but he also brings his first — his so-called \"Sean-tourage\" — to the set; his mother and grandmother are frequent visitors to The Goldbergs’ soundstage.\n\nEmbarassing Baby Photos\n\nOne of many framed collages featuring pictures of the show’s stars from their own childhoods. Of the several on the set, many include childhood photos of creator Adam F. Goldberg.\n\n’80s at 81\n\nThe show’s '80s milieu is toughest on showbiz vet George Segal, 81, one of the few on the set today who were full-grown adults during the decade. \"The last thing I remember are the '70s,\" he says. \"It starts to get blurry around the '80s and '90s.\"\n\n“Smother Mother”\n\nWendi McLendon-Covey (with Jeff Garlin) goes though about an hour of makeup every day to transform into Beverly, with her wigs placed in advance. \"The minute I put on my armor, I walk differently,\" she says of her uber-'80s wardrobe. \"This is her work outfit, and her job is defending her children from the world. She has to have her helmet, armor and her talons.\"\n\nPhoto Albums and Dreams\n\nBeverly gives Erica a (prop) photo album in the season two finale. Like her character, Erica, Hayley Orrantia has musical aspirations (she’s a former X Factor contestant). \"I’m trying to get ABC to put out a Goldbergs CD with Troy [Gentile] singing 'Twist and Shout' and me and AJ [Michalka] doing 'Eternal Flame.' \"\n\nTighty-Whities\n\nJeff Garlin, meanwhile, spends at least one day a week running around in \"tighty–whities,\" as Murray drops his pants nearly every episode, usually the minute he walks in the door. Of his briefs, he says: \"It has three levels and a piece of padding so my wiener doesn’t show. It’s not an enjoyable thing.\"\n\nDinner Time\n\nShooting one of the second season’s many family-dinner scenes. Says Gentile (in yellow) of the show’s on-set camaraderie, \"It’s been two years now, and we've all built a bond.\"\n\nFamily Bonding\n\n\"We love each other,\" Garlin says of his castmates. \"We’re lucky that way, because I’ve been on plenty of shows where there isn’t much love.\"\n\nFictional Family, Real Emotions\n\n\"The cast has been growing as a family, so now these touching scenes are easier because you can really feel for these people,\" Sean Giambrone says. \"We’re just hoping the emotions pass through the TV screen.\""
