        "text": "Amanda\n\nLatin\n\n\"she must be loved\"\n\nAmanda Origin and Meaning\n\nThe name Amanda is a girl's name of Latin origin meaning \"she must be loved\".\n\nAmanda may no longer be the most popular girls' name in her class, but she is still among the prettiest and has a lovely meaning. Amanda was one of the romantic-sounding girls’ names that rocketed to stardom in the eighties, along with Samantha, Vanessa, et al.\n\nDespite its somewhat trendy feel, Amanda is a certifiable classic—it appears in a play as early as 1694 and was prominent among saints, eighteenth century literary heroines, and in plays by Noel Coward and Tennessee Williams. But if you're looking for a fresher alternative, you might consider the French Amandine or Shakespearean Miranda.\n\n# 484 in the US\n\nAmanda Rank in US Top 1000\n\n# 413 on Nameberry\n\nAmanda Rank in Nameberry Top 1000\n\nAmanda Popularity\n\n484US2023\n\n413Nameberry2024\n\n699England2021\n\n361Germany2016\n\n100Sweden2020\n\n38Norway2023\n\n40Finland2023\n\n184Switzerland2022\n\n150Poland2020\n\n17Chile2021\n\n184Mexico2021\n\nFamous People Named Amanda\n\nAmanda Laura BynesAmerican actress\n\nAmanda Michelle SeyfriedAmerican actress\n\nAmanda Leigh \"Mandy\" MooreAmerican singer and actress\n\nAmanda Blake (born Beverly Louise Neill)American actress\n\nAmanda Lepore (born Armand Lepore)American model\n\nAmanda Reifermusician of Barbadian band Cover Drive\n\nAmanda CrewCanadian actress\n\nAmanda PeetAmerican actress\n\nAmanda Michael PlummerAmerican actress, daughter of actor Christopher Plummer\n\nAmanda LearFrench singer and TV presenter\n\nAmanda JonesMiss USA 1973\n\nAmanda KesselAmerican Olympic hockey player\n\nAmanda FullerAmerican actress\n\nAmanda Nicole PerezAmerican R&B singer\n\nAmanda Jo AdkinsAmerican Olympic swimmer\n\nAmanda Ray BeardAmerican Olympic swimmer\n\nAmanda RighettiAmerican actress\n\nAmanda RipleyAmerican journalist and author\n\nAmanda TappingEnglish,Canadian actress\n\nAmanda LaineCanadian model\n\nAmanda Michelle ToddCanadian teen whose suicide raised cyberbullying awareness\n\nAmanda MacKinnon Gaiman PalmerAmerican singer of band The Dresden Dolls\n\nAmanda Quickpseudonym of novelist Jayne Ann Krentz\n\nAmanda Harlech (born Amanda Jane Grieve)English fashion muse\n\nAmanda WakeleyEnglish fashion designer\n\nAmanda EvoraAmerican Olympic pair skater\n\nAmanda (Louisa Kretz Lameche)French pop singer\n\nAmanda \"Mandy\" DruryAmerican TV journalist\n\nAmanda de CadenetEnglish photographer and TV presenter\n\nAmanda Louise HoldenEnglish actress and TV presenter\n\nAmanda Randolph HearstAmerican heiress and model\n\nAmanda FreitagAmerican celebrity chef\n\nAmanda Marie KnoxAmerican woman imprisoned in Italy\n\nAmanda CoetzerSouth African tennis player\n\nAmanda Katherine AnkaBateman, American actress\n\nAmanda Jeanette DetmerAmerican actress\n\nAzealia Amanda BanksAmerican singer\n\nAmanda Kate Lambertdaughter of singer Nancy Sinatra\n\nAmanda Cavendish12th Duchess of Devonshire\n\nAmanda Felicitas SteptoCanadian actress\n\nAmanda Brooke FeinAmerican actress; twin sister Caitlin Fein\n\nAmanda Abbington (born Amanda Jane Smith)English actress\n\nAmanda Joy \"A.J.\" MichalkaAmerican singer/actress of duo 78Violet\n\nAmanda PaysEnglish actress\n\nAmanda \"Mandy\" Lee DuffyAmerican singer of band MisterWives\n\nAmanda Jo WeirAmerican swimmer\n\nAmanda Lynn SteeleAmerican YouTube beauty vlogger and model\n\n(Karin) Amanda BergmanSwedish musician and songwriter\n\nAmanda VirkkunenFinnish rhythmic gymnast\n\nAmanda WellshBrazilian model\n\nAmanda Trivizas (b. 1999) American model & Instagram Star\n\nAmanda Cerny (b. 1991) Playboy Playmate\n\nAmanda Booth (b. 1986) model & actress who is the Playboy Playmate of the Month for February 2014\n\nAmanda Taylor (b. 1996) American model\n\nAmanda Williford AKA Willa FordAmerican Singer and Actress"
