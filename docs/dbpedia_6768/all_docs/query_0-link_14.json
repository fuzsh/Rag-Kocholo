Here we estimated networks using a Multi-Session Hierarchical Bayesian Model (MS-HBM) applied to intensively sampled within-individual functional MRI (fMRI) data. The network estimation procedure was initially developed and tested in two participants (each scanned 31 times) and then prospectively applied to 15 new participants (each scanned 8 to 11 times). Detailed analysis of the networks revealed a global organization. Locally organized first-order sensory and motor networks were surrounded by spatially adjacent second-order networks that also linked to distant regions. Third-order networks each possessed regions distributed widely throughout association cortex. Moreover, regions of distinct third-order networks displayed side-by-side juxtapositions with a pattern that repeated similarly across multiple cortical zones. We refer to these as Supra-Areal Association Megaclusters (SAAMs). Within each SAAM, two candidate control regions were typically adjacent to three separate domain-specialized regions. Independent task data were analyzed to explore functional response properties. The somatomotor and visual first-order networks responded to body movements and visual stimulation, respectively. A subset of the second-order networks responded to transients in an oddball detection task, consistent with a role in orienting to salient or novel events. The third-order networks, including distinct regions within each SAAM, showed two levels of functional specialization. Regions linked to candidate control networks responded to working memory load across multiple stimulus domains. The remaining regions within each SAAM did not track working memory load but rather dissociated across language, social, and spatial / episodic processing domains. These results support a model of the cerebral cortex in which progressively higher-order networks nest outwards from primary sensory and motor cortices. Within the apex zones of association cortex there is specialization of large-scale networks that divides domain-flexible from domain-specialized regions repeatedly across parietal, temporal, and prefrontal cortices. We discuss implications of these findings including how repeating organizational motifs may emerge during development.\n\nThe primate cerebral cortex is populated by specialized networks that support sensory, motor and higher-order cognitive and affective functions. Characterizing how the networks and their interconnected regions are organized on the cortical surface began more than a century ago with landmark studies of myelogenetic and architectonic patterns (e.g., Flechsig 1901; Campbell 1905; Brodmann 1909; von Economo and Koskinas 1925; von Bonin and Bailey 1947) and continued with modern systems neuroscience integration of anatomical projection data and insights from study of brain lesions (e.g., Geschwind 1965; Ungerleider and Desimone 1986; Goldman-Rakic 1988; Mesulam 1990; 1998; Van Essen et al. 1992; Pandya et al. 2015; Giarrocco and Averbeck 2023). Over the past decades our laboratory, and the field more broadly, has undertaken data collection efforts and analyses of neuroimaging data with the goal to improve understanding of human network organization and provide non-invasive approaches to measure brain organization for clinical use.\n\nIt is beyond the present scope to cover the extensive literature that has evolved, but it is important to interpret the current effort with awareness that new details and revisions emerge incrementally as the methods and data quality progress. Our efforts presented here reflect another step in that progression. The specific challenge in examining the details of network organization in humans is that the methods are indirect and limited, and often noisy within individuals. Despite limitations, advances in structural, diffusion, and functional MRI (fMRI) provide valuable information about human cortical organization, albeit with ambiguities consistent with the complexity of cortical architecture and the low resolution of the techniques.\n\nResting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), based on measuring spontaneous correlated fluctuations between brain regions, has been especially useful for estimating networks (Biswal et al. 1995; see also Fox and Raichle 2007; Van Dijk et al. 2010; Buckner et al. 2013; Murphy et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2013; Power et al. 2014). Explorations in group-averaged fcMRI data, with sample sizes that range from ten to thousands of participants, reveal network estimates that are consistent across analytical approaches and datasets (e.g., Beckmann et al. 2005; Damoiseaux et al. 2006; Yeo et al. 2011; Power et al. 2011; Doucet et al. 2011; Miller et al. 2016; Glasser et al. 2016). Moreover, estimated networks show similarities to directly observed anatomical projection patterns from tracer injections in the monkey, providing support that they reflect, to a first approximation, anatomically connected networks (Vincent et al. 2007; Buckner et al. 2008; Binder et al. 2009; Margulies et al. 2009; Hutchinson et al. 2012; Ghahremani et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019; Buckner and Margulies 2019; Du and Buckner 2021). Correspondence is far from perfect and there are unresolved aspects to how indirect human network estimates link to anatomy, a theme that we will return to in the discussion.\n\nA recent advance in the field is to use within-individual estimates of networks without recourse to averaging across participants. Architectonic fields tile the cortical mantle with variability in their exact locations, sizes, and borders between individuals (Rademacher et al 1993; Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic 1995; Amunts et al. 1999; 2000; 2020; Caspers et al. 2006; Fischl et al. 2008; Henssen et al. 2016; Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2019). Spatial blurring – inherent in group-averaging – impedes the ability to estimate details of network organization. Precision neuroimaging, involving intensive sampling and analysis of data within the individual, preserves idiosyncratic anatomical features.\n\nWithin-individual approaches have been the mainstay in human neuroimaging studies of sensory and motor systems (e.g., Sereno et al. 1995; Rao et al. 1995; DeYoe et al. 1996; Engel, Glover and Wandell 1997; Kanwisher, McDermott, and Chun 1997; Epstein and Kanwisher 1998) and emerged later as viable to estimate task-based responses in higher-order association cortex (e.g., Fedorenko et al. 2010; 2012; Blank et al. 2013; Peer et al. 2015; Michalka et al. 2015; Huth et al. 2016). Within-individual precision mapping using fcMRI only became emphasized recently, even though the first report was within individuals (Biswal et al. 1995). Following a landmark demonstration that intensive repeat scanning is possible (Poldrack et al. 2015; Laumann et al. 2015), multiple groups have pursued within-individual characterization of network organization (e.g., Braga and Buckner 2017; Gordon et al. 2017; Braga et al. 2019; 2020; Smith et al. 2021; Somers et al. 2021; Noyce et al. 2022; Gordon et al. 2023; for further discussion see Gratton and Braga 2021; Laumann, Zorumski, and Dosenbach 2023).\n\nHere we continue the investigation of the detailed organization of the cerebral cortex using within-individual approaches. There are multiple goals and methodological innovations that steer this work. First, we employ deep, intensive imaging to boost the signal-to-noise (SNR) within individual participants. Each new participant was scanned on at least 8 separate occasions and often more. Second, we applied a novel Multi-Session Hierarchical Bayesian Model (MS-HBM; Kong et al. 2019) to automatically estimate networks in the intensively sampled participants. Specifically, the number of networks estimated was set at 15 to capture established networks sometimes missed in simpler network parcellations, as will be detailed within the methods. Third, to enable clinical translational research, we developed an empirical method and projected all network estimates from the surface back into the native-space volume of individual participants, as is needed for presurgical planning and neuromodulation. Fourth, inspired by the possibility to chart global spatial relations between networks (e.g., Margulies et al. 2016), we also plotted the resulting network estimates on the fully flattened cortical surface (Van Essen and Maunsell 1980; Fischl et al. 1999). As the results will reveal, there are repeating patterns of spatial juxtapositions among networks that provide insight into their evolutionary and developmental origins. Finally, we collected and examined task data within the same intensively sampled participants to test whether within-individual network estimates predict functional response patterns and also to explore between network functional dissociations.\n\nThe raw data and our provisional network parcellations generated through this research effort are provided to the community as an open resource.\n\nMethods\n\nOverview\n\nWe sought to estimate networks within individuals with high precision. The analyses proceeded in three stages: (1) a refinement stage established the methods for estimating networks, (2) an implementation stage applied the methods prospectively to 15 new participants, and (3) a functional testing stage explored functional response properties and dissociations between networks.\n\nIn the refinement stage, previously reported datasets (N = 2; Braga et al. 2019; Xue et al. 2021) were analyzed to establish a novel MS-HBM network estimate that incorporated priors for 15 distinct networks (as contrast to 10 networks used in earlier work). Each of the participants performed 31 independent MRI sessions allowing considerable data to test for within-individual reliability.\n\nIn the implementation stage, the 15-network MS-HBM model was prospectively applied to 15 new participants that were each scanned 8–11 times. The model was estimated for each participant in a fully automated fashion, and the networks were confirmed using model-free seed-region based functional connectivity. Following network estimation, the overlap and variability of each network across individuals were examined.\n\nIn the final functional testing stage, an extensive battery of tasks was administered and analyzed within each individual to explore whether the estimated networks predicted functional responses.\n\nParticipants\n\nSeventeen native English-speaking volunteers participated for payment. History of a neurologic or psychiatric illness was an exclusion. Participants provided informed consent using protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of Harvard University. For the refinement stage data, 2 right-handed adult women ages 22 – 23 yr participated (data previously reported in Braga et al. 2019 and Xue et al. 2021). The refinement stage data participants are labeled S1 and S2 to match Xue et al. (2021). For the implementation stage data, 15 right-handed adults ages 18 – 34 yr participated (mean = 22.1 yr, SD = 3.9 yr, 9 women). Participants came from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds (9 of the 17 individuals self-reported as non-white and / or Hispanic). A subset of the participants contributing implementation stage data also enrolled in a study of motor movement mapping (Saadon-Grosman et al. 2022). The implementation stage participants are labeled P1 to P15.\n\nMRI Data Acquisition\n\nData were acquired at the Harvard Center for Brain Science using a 3T Siemens Prisma-fit MRI scanner. A 64-channel phased-array head-neck coil (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) was used in the refinement stage and for a subset of motor task sessions in the implementation stage. A 32-channel phased-array head coil (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) was used to acquire all other data in the implementation stage. For functional neuroimaging, the differences between these two coils are minimal and the data were treated as comparable. Foam and inflated padding mitigated head motion. Participants were instructed to remain still and alert and to look at a rear-projected display through a mirror attached to the head coil. The display had a resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels and screen width of 43 cm, resulting in an effective viewing distance of 104 cm (54 pixels per visual degree). Eyes were video recorded using an Eyelink 1000 Plus with Long-Range Mount (SR Research, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), and alertness was scored during each functional run. MRI data quality was monitored during the scan using Framewise Integrated Real-time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM; Dosenbach et al. 2017).\n\nRefinement Stage Data.\n\nEach participant (S1 and S2) was scanned across 31 MRI sessions over 28–40 wks with no sessions on consecutive days. Each session involved multiple resting-state fixation runs to be used for functional connectivity analysis, for a total of 63 functional MRI (fMRI) runs obtained for each individual. fMRI data were acquired using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast (Kwong et al. 1992; Ogawa et al. 1992). A custom multiband gradient-echo echo-planar pulse sequence provided by the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at the University of Minnesota was used (Xu et al. 2012; Van Essen et al. 2013; see also Setsompop et al. 2012): voxel size = 2.4 mm, repetition time (TR) = 1,000 ms, echo time (TE) = 32.6 ms, flip-angle = 64°, matrix 88 × 88 × 65, anterior-to-posterior (AP) phase encoding, multislice 5x acceleration, fully covering the cerebrum and cerebellum. Signal dropout was minimized by automatically (van der Kouwe et al. 2005) selecting a slice 25° from the anterior-posterior commissural plane toward the coronal plane (Weiskopf et al. 2006; Mennes et al. 2014). Each run lasted 7 min 2 sec (422 frames with the first 12 frames removed for T1 equilibration). A dual-gradient-echo B0 fieldmap was acquired to correct for spatial distortions: TE = 4.45 and 6.91 ms with slice prescription / spatial resolution matched to the BOLD sequence. During BOLD scanning, participants fixated a centrally presented plus sign (black on a gray background). The scanner room was illuminated.\n\nA rapid T1w structural scan was obtained using a multi-echo magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (ME-MPRAGE) three-dimensional sequence (van der Kouwe et al. 2008): voxel size = 1.2 mm, TR = 2,200 ms, TE = 1.57, 3.39, 5.21, 7.03 ms, TI = 1,100 ms, flip-angle = 7°, matrix 192 × 192 × 176, in-plane generalized auto-calibrating partial parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) acceleration = 4.\n\nImplementation Stage Data.\n\nEach participant (P1 to P15) was scanned across 8–11 sessions most often over 6 to 10 wks. A few participants had longer gaps between the first and last MRI sessions up to one year. Each session involved multiple fMRI runs to be used for functional connectivity analysis, for a total of 17 to 24 resting-state fixation runs obtained for each individual. BOLD acquisition parameters were similar to the refinement stage data: voxel size = 2.4 mm, TR = 1,000 ms, TE = 33.0 ms, flip-angle = 64°, matrix 92 × 92 × 65 (FOV = 221 × 221), 65 slices covering the full cerebrum and cerebellum. Each resting-state fixation run again lasted 7 min 2 sec (422 frames with the first 12 frames removed for T1 equilibration). Dual-gradient-echo B0 fieldmaps were also acquired with parameters matched to the refinement stage. The first two sessions of P12 were acquired in a different FOV (211 × 211); therefore, the matrix for both BOLD runs and field maps was: 88 × 88 × 65 and BOLD TE = 32.6 ms, matching S1 and S2. The change in FOV did not affect the quality of registration or impact the analyses in any way we could detect.\n\nHigh-resolution T1w and T2w scans were acquired for the implementation stage data based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP; Harms et al. 2018). T1w MPRAGE parameters: voxel size = 0.8 mm, TR = 2,500 ms, TE = 1.81, 3.60, 5.39, and 7.18 ms, TI = 1,000 ms, flip-angle = 8°, matrix 320 × 320 × 208, 144, in-plane GRAPPA acceleration = 2. T2w sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolution sequence (SPACE) parameters: voxel size = 0.8 mm, TR=3,200 ms, TE=564 ms, 208 slices, matrix=320 × 300 × 208, in-plane GRAPPA acceleration = 2. Rapid T1w structural scans were also obtained as backup using the refinement stage sequence but with matrix 192 × 192 × 144.\n\nFunctional Testing Stage Data.\n\nTo explore functional response properties, extensive task-based BOLD fMRI data were collected on participants P1 to P15. Task runs used the same sequence as the resting-state fixation runs, ensuring the estimated networks would be spatially aligned to the task-based data. Details of the task designs, stimuli and run structure are described below under Task Paradigms.\n\nExclusion Criteria and Quality Control\n\nEach BOLD fMRI run was examined for quality. Exclusion criteria generally consisted of the parameters reported in Xue et al. (2021) including: 1) maximum absolute motion > 1.8 mm and 2) slice-based SNR < 130. Runs with SNR > 100 but also SNR < 130 were retained if motion and visual inspection indicated adequate quality. For the functional testing stage data, the maximum absolute motion for the Episodic Projection task was > 2.5 mm given their long duration. One borderline motor run (P2) was included with motion of 1.9 mm as the motion was largely due to a linear drift. For the refinement stage, usable resting-state runs were 62 (S1) and 61 (S2) runs. For the implementation stage, usable resting-state runs ranged from 15 (P11) to 24 (P12) runs. For the functional testing stage, usable task runs ranged from 18 (P5) to 70 (P12) runs (see ). All data exclusions were finalized prior to functional connectivity and task response analyses.\n\nTable 1.\n\nParticipantFixationMotorVisualOddballN-BackTheory-of-MindSentence ProcessingEpisodic ProjectionS1 62(63) -------S2 61(63) -------P1 17(17) 0(0) 5(5) 5(5) 8(8) 8(8) 6(6) 10(10) P2 16(17) 11(12) 5(5) 5(5) 8(8) 8(8) 6(6) 10(10) P3 19(22) 10(12) 5(5) 4(5) 8(8) 7(8) 6(6) 8(10) P4 20(22) 10(12) 5(5) 5(5) 8(8) 8(8) 5(6) 9(10) P5 22(22) 8(12) 0(5) 4(5) 6(7) 8(8) 3(6) 7(10) P6 21(22) 12(12) 5(5) 5(5) 8(8) 8(8) 6(6) 10(10) P7 22(22) 12(12) 5(5) 5(5) 8(8) 8(8) 6(6) 10(10) P8 21(22) 12(12) 5(5) 5(5) 8(8) 8(8) 6(6) 10(10) P9 20(22) 12(12) 5(5) 5(5) 8(8) 8(8) 6(6) 8(10) P10 23(23) 24(24) 0(5) 2(5) 7(8) 8(8) 12(12) 10(10) P11 15(20) 3(12) 3(5) 3(5) 8(8) 8(8) 6(6) 7(10) P12 24(24) 24(24) 5(5) 4(5) 8(8) 8(8) 11(12) 10(10) P13 22(22) 12(12) 5(5) 5(5) 8(8) 8(8) 6(6) 10(10) P14 19(19) 9(11) 5(5) 5(5) 8(8) 8(8) 6(6) 10(10) P15 20(22) 12(12) 5(5) 3(5) 8(8) 8(8) 6(6) 10(10)\n\nData Processing and Registration that Minimizes Spatial Blurring\n\nData were processed using an in-house preprocessing pipeline (“iProc”) that preserved spatial details by minimizing blurring and multiple interpolations (described in detail in Braga et al. 2019). For the refinement stage data (S1 and S2), the processed data were taken directly from Xue et al. (2021). For the implementation stage data (P1 to P15), the changes in processing included the use of the high resolution T1w and T2w structural images. For one participant (P12), the registration failed with the 0.8 mm T1w image and their 1.2 mm image was used as a back-up. For another participant (P1), only the 0.8 mm T1w image was used without a paired T2w image.\n\nData were interpolated to a 1-mm isotropic T1w native-space atlas (with all processing steps composed into a single interpolation) that was then projected using FreeSurfer v6.0.0 to the fsaverage6 cortical surface (40,962 vertices per hemisphere; Fischl et al. 1999). Four transformation matrices were calculated: 1) a motion correction matrix for each volume to the run’s middle volume [linear registration, 6 degrees of freedom (DOF); MCFLIRT, FSL], 2) a matrix for field-map-unwarping the run’s middle volume, correcting for field inhomogeneities caused by susceptibility gradients (FUGUE, FSL), 3) a matrix for registering the field-map-unwarped middle BOLD volume to the within-individual mean BOLD template (12 DOF; FLIRT, FSL), and 4) a matrix for registering the mean BOLD template to the participant’s T1w native-space image which was resampled to 1.0 mm isotropic resolution (6 DOF; using boundary-based registration, Freesurfer). The individual-specific mean BOLD template was created by averaging all field-map-unwarped middle volumes after being registered to an upsampled 1.2 mm and unwarped mid-volume template (an interim target, selected from a low motion run, typically acquired close to a field map).\n\nFor resting-state fixation runs, confounding variables including 6 head motion parameters, whole-brain, ventricular signal, deep cerebral white matter signal, and their temporal derivatives were calculated from the BOLD data in T1w native space. The signals were regressed out from the BOLD data using 3dTproject (AFNI; Cox et al. 1996; 2012). The residual BOLD data were then bandpass filtered at 0.01–0.1-Hz using 3dBandpass (AFNI; Cox et al. 1996; 2012). For task data runs, only whole-brain signal was regressed out (see DiNicola et al. 2020). Data registered to the T1w native-space atlas were resampled to the fsaverage6 standardized cortical surface mesh using trilinear interpolation (featuring 40,962 vertices per hemisphere; Fischl et al. 1999) and then surface-smoothed using a 2-mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. The iProc pipeline thus allowed for high-resolution and robustly aligned BOLD data, with minimal interpolation and signal loss, output to two relevant spaces: the native space and the fsaverage6 cortical surface. Analyses were performed on the fsaverage6 cortical surface, but the network estimates (parcellations) were projected back into the individual participant’s native space allowing both surface-based and volume visualization.\n\nIndividualized Network Estimates of the Cerebral Cortex\n\nThe MS-HBM was implemented to estimate cortical networks (Kong et al. 2019). The MS-HBM was independently implemented for the refinement stage data (S1 and S2) and then subsequently for the implementation stage data (in three separate groups P1-P5, P6-P10, and P11-P15). Estimating the model separately for multiple small groups allowed for prospective replication. As the results will reveal, the procedure was robust.\n\nFirst, the connectivity profile of each vertex on the fsaverage6 cortical surface was estimated as its functional connectivity to 1,175 regions of interest (ROIs) that uniformly distributed across the fsaverage5 surface meshes (Yeo et al. 2011). For each run of data, the Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the fMRI time series at each vertex (40,962 vertices / hemisphere) and the 1,175 ROIs were computed. The resulting 40,962 × 1,175 correlation matrix was then binarized by keeping the top 10% of the correlations to obtain the functional connectivity profiles (Yeo et al. 2011).\n\nNext, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating parameters in the MS-HBM was initialized with a group-level parcellation from the HCP S900 data release (that itself used the clustering algorithm from our previous study; Yeo et al. 2011). It is important to note that the goal of applying the model in this study was to obtain the best estimate of networks within each individual participant’s dataset, not to train parameters and apply them to unseen data from new participants (see Kong et al. 2019). In this analysis, as with our previous study using this approach (Xue et al. 2021), we did not include the validation step described in Kong et al. (2019), so no spatial smoothness prior was applied. Only the training step described in Kong et al. (2019) was conducted here. A network label assignment for each vertex was obtained for each participant within the training step.\n\nRefinement Stage Data.\n\nData from the two participants (S1 and S2) were analyzed together using the same MS-HBM model. The data were used to estimate and compare 15-network and 10-network MS-HBM models, as well as to explore reliability of model estimates when subsets of data were analyzed. The results from these initial two participants guided the subsequent processing of the implementation stage data.\n\nThe specific impetus for exploring a 15-network model was that networks at or near to the insula did not distinguish multiple networks that had been reported in the literature, variably labeled the Cingular-Opercular Network and Salience Network (Seeley et al. 2007; See also Seeley 2019), as well as established distinctions at or around primary visual and somatomotor1 cortex. The 15 candidate networks explored here are labeled2: Somatomotor-A (SMOT-A), Somatomotor-B (SMOT-B), Premotor-Posterior Parietal Rostral (PM-PPr), Cingular-Opercular (CG-OP), Salience / Parietal Memory Network (SAL / PMN), Dorsal Attention-A (dATN-A), Dorsal Attention-B (dATN-B), Frontoparietal Network-A (FPN-A)3, Frontoparietal Network-B (FPN-B), Default Network-A (DN-A), Default Network-B (DN-B), Language (LANG), Visual-Central (VIS-C), Visual-Peripheral (VIS-P), and Auditory (AUD).\n\nImplementation Stage Data: Discovery, Replication and Triplication Datasets.\n\nA key aspect of our methods is generalization and replication. The 15 participants in the implementation stage data were divided into discovery, replication and triplication datasets of 5 participants each4. The MS-HBM model, initialized with a 15-network group-level parcellation obtained from the HCP S900 data, was applied independently to the three separate datasets.\n\nModel-Free Seed-Region Based Confirmation of the Networks\n\nWhen employing the MS-HBM, there are assumptions about the organization of the brain from the group prior, how many networks should be estimated, and assignment of vertices to only a single network. The idiosyncratic patterns of estimated networks thus could be distorted or fail to capture features of the underlying correlation matrix. To confirm that the individual network estimates were not obligated by the assumptions, a model-free seed-region based analysis was conducted using the same data as the MS-HBM model, mirroring the procedures outlined by Braga and Buckner (2017). The results were expected to converge if the model did not overly bias network assignments and diverge if the assignments mismatched the underlying data patterns. Model-free seed-region based confirmation thus served as a check to ensure network estimates properly captured individual correlation patterns.\n\nFor this control check, the pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficients between the fMRI time courses at each surface vertex were calculated for each resting-state fixation run, yielding an 81,924 × 81,924 matrix (40,962 vertices / hemisphere). The matrix was then Fisher r-to-z transformed and averaged across all runs to yield a single best estimate of the within-individual correlation matrix. This averaged matrix was used to explore network organization. The mean correlation maps were assigned to a cortical template combining left and right hemispheres of the fsaverage6 surface into the CIFTI format to interactively explore correlation maps using the Connectome Workbench’s wb_view software (Glasser et al. 2013; Marcus et al. 2011). Seed regions with robust functional connectivity correlation maps were manually selected within MS-HBM network boundaries. Anterior and posterior seed regions were recorded and visualized for each network in all the participants. Thresholds were set at z(r) > 0.2 for all seed regions. The color scales of correlation maps were thresholded between 0.2 and 0.6, using the Jet look-up table (colorbar) for visualization.\n\nVisualization Within the Individual Native-Space Volume\n\nNetworks were first estimated and analyzed for each individual on the normalized fsaverage6 surface of FreeSurfer. Surface-based analyses allowed comparisons across individuals and utilization of the group-based priors for initialization of the MS-HBM. However, many applications require network assignments to be utilized within the native-space anatomy of the individual’s own volume (e.g., for presurgical planning and neuromodulation targeting). Given these needs, we devised a robust empirical procedure to project the network estimates back into each individual’s native-space T1w anatomical volume.\n\nWe constructed three separate images within the native-space volume that each varied from 0–255 in one of the three Cartesian x, y, and z coordinate axes (e.g., the X-coordinate image possessed a volume that linearly varied in the X-dimension going from 0 to 255 with no other variation across the image volume). Each separate axis-volume was then projected to the fsaverage6 surface using mri_vol2surf and mri_surf2surf (FreeSurfer v6.0.0) with the same spatial transformation used for the projection of the participant’s BOLD fMRI data onto the fsaverage6 surface. Nearest neighbor interpolation was used. The matrices for this projection were taken from each participant’s processing pipeline (iProc).\n\nIn this manner, x, y, and z volume coordinates were obtained on the surface using the exact same spatial transformation matrix as originally applied to the BOLD data. We assigned each surface network label to its corresponding x, y, and z coordinates in the native-space volume. This resulted in a sparse 256 × 256 × 256 matrix in the volume, which was filled in using nearest neighbor interpolation (Matlab knnsearch). We then masked this with the individual’s FSL-reoriented and binarized cortical ribbon generated by FreeSurfer during preprocessing. As a control check, the final native-space network estimates were projected back to the surface and compared to the original MS-HBM surface estimates for each participant to ensure no spatial distortions.\n\nThe resulting estimates of networks in volume space are provided as a reference in the Supplemental Materials. Specifically, the parcellation results from MS-HBM were overlaid onto each individual’s T1w structural image. Sagittal, axial, and coronal slices were chosen to show common landmarks in each individual (midline, left and right insula, anterior commissure, primary sensory and motor cortices).\n\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Maps\n\nData using BOLD-contrast (T2* images) and echo-planar imaging result in variable distortion and signal dropout due to magnetic susceptibility artifacts, especially near the sinus and ear canals (e.g., Ojemann et al. 1997). Vertex-based SNR maps were computed by taking the preprocessed time series from each resting-state fixation run (prior to regressing out confounding variables) and dividing the mean signal at each vertex by its standard deviation over time. The SNR maps were then averaged across the runs, resulting in an aggregate within-individual SNR map on the fsaverage6 surface. To visualize these effects in the native anatomy, surface maps were projected to the native-space volume using the procedure described above. The only difference is that linear interpolation (Matlab scatteredInterpolant) was used to fill in the sparsely filled 256 × 256 × 256 matrix.\n\nVariability in Network Estimates Between Individuals\n\nTo measure spatial variability across individuals, overlap maps of network assignments were computed. For each individual, the spatial extent of their estimated network was plotted simultaneously with all other participants and the percentage of overlap computed. In addition, the individual networks were plotted next to one another to appreciate the commonalities across individuals as well as the idiosyncratic features of each individual’s estimate (available in the Supplemental Materials).\n\nOverlap maps were also computed for the model-free seed-region correlation maps. These maps make no assumption of a winner-take-all network assignment so provide a different view of network consistency or inconsistency across participants. For this final analysis, each individual’s seed-region correlation map for each network was thresholded at z(r) > 0.2 and the overlap across participants plotted. The analysis was performed separately for both the anterior and posterior seed regions for each network.\n\nVisualization on the Flattened Cortical Surface\n\nThe human cerebral cortex is a complex structure with numerous sulci and gyri that can make it difficult to appreciate topographic patterns, including patterns that evolve over medial to lateral views and through complex structures like the insula. To appreciate global topographic relations, a flattened surface was created by editing the inflated surface file using the “TKSurfer” tool of FreeSurfer v6.0.0. Five linear cuts were made on the midline of the inflated cortical surface (see ), including one along the calcarine sulcus and four roughly equally spaced cuts radiating out from the medial wall. Next, a circular cut was made on the midline to allow the surface to unravel. Finally, the “mris_flatten” tool of FreeSurfer v6.0.0 was employed to create the flattened surface. This procedure was performed separately for the left and right hemispheres.\n\nTask Paradigms\n\nFollowing estimation of within-individual networks, functional response properties were explored in independent task-based data collected on the same individuals. The task paradigms were chosen based on literature review and our prior studies because of their ability to differentially activate distinct networks, and to do so robustly. A second feature of the selected task paradigms is that they were amenable to repeat testing either because extensive novel stimuli could be constructed (e.g., sentences, question probes) or, by their nature, were resilient to habituation even after many repetitions (e.g., flickering visual stimuli). Task details are described below.\n\nSomatomotor Topography.\n\nThe motor task extended from Buckner et al. (2011) to examine the organization of the foot, glute, hand and tongue representations. Novel targeting of the glute representation allowed an intermediate body position to be mapped between the hand and foot (as reported earlier in Saadon-Grosman et al. 2022). The goal of this task paradigm was to activate somatotopic portions of SMOT-A and SMOT-B.\n\nFollowing extensive pre-scan training, participants performed six types of active movements in the scanner: 1,2) left and right finger taps (thumb to index and thumb to middle), 3,4) left and right toes plantar flexion and dorsiflexion, 5) tongue movements from right to left (touching the premolar upper teeth), and 6) contraction and relaxation of their gluteal muscles. Each movement type was performed repeatedly across 10-sec movement blocks. Prior to each movement block, a 2-sec visual cue of a drawn body part with a text label informed the participant to initiate one of the six movement types. The fixation crosshair then changed to a slow flickering black circle to pace the movements. The onset of the black circle cued movement of thumb to index finger, toes plantarflexion, tongue to the right and glutes contraction. The offset of the black circle cued movement of thumb to middle finger, toes dorsiflexion, tongue to the left and glutes relaxation. After five cycles, the word ‘END’ instructed movement cessation. Twenty-four movement blocks (4 per movement type) occurred within each run, with 16-sec blocks of passive fixation following each set of six movement blocks. Runs began and ended with fixation yielding 5 fixation blocks per run.\n\nEach run lasted 7 min 8 sec (428 frames with the first 12 frames removed for T1 equilibration). Six motor runs were collected with full counterbalanced orders of movement conditions on each day. Runs were excluded from analysis if participants missed or failed to respond to cues, as confirmed by operators observing their alertness and movements from the control room.\n\nVisual Topography.\n\nA visual retinotopic stimulation task was used to map visual cortex (similar to Fox et al. 1987; Engel et al. 1997). Our design had three levels of eccentricity stimuli (to map eccentricity gradients that span the V1, V2, V3 cluster) and separate vertical versus horizontal meridian stimuli (to map polar angle reversals that separate the borders of V1, V2, and V3; Tootell et al. 1995; see also Wandell and Winawer 2011). The goal of this task was to activate retinotopic portions of VIS-C and VIS-P.\n\nThe basic stimulus consisted of a circular checkerboard that expanded outwards from the central fixation point to approximate cortical expansion in visual cortex. Moving from center, the radius ring of the checkerboard became larger by a log step of 0.29. The resulting checkerboard was rendered out to 36 even rings cropped to a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels. To localize the meridians, two wedges masked the checkerboard each covering 0.5° to 16.2° of eccentricity and 11.2° of polar angle. Horizontal wedges were centered at polar angles 360° and 180°; vertical wedges at 0° and 90°. To localize polar angle, the checkerboard was masked with a circular ring, which increased in size with increasing eccentricity. The center ring covered 0.5° to 1.6°, the middle ring 1.6° to 5.1°, and the peripheral ring 5.1° to 16.2°.\n\nEach run consisted of 10 10-sec blocks of visual stimulation (2 blocks of each of the 5 conditions). The beginning, middle, and end of each run included a 20-sec block of extended fixation. During stimulation the checkerboard changed 6 times per sec in the order: white/black, color, black/white, color, white/black, black/white. The black center fixation dot unpredictably changed to gray (every 1 to 5 sec). To ensure continuous fixation, participants pressed a button every time the fixation dot changed to gray. The primary contrasts of interest were horizontal versus vertical meridian blocks, and separately the three eccentricity blocks versus each other.\n\nEach run lasted 4 min 30 sec (270 frames with the first 6 frames removed for T1 equilibration). Five runs were collected for each participant. Runs were excluded from analysis if participants missed trials and the eye video recordings indicated drowsiness. Lights within the scanner room were off during visual topography mapping, and a black occluding board was inserted into the scanner to prevent any light reflections.\n\nOddball Task.\n\nThe oddball task explored detection of transient responses to salient, visual oddball targets that were uncommon relative to irrelevant non-targets and distracting non-targets (similar to Wynn et al. 2015). The goal of the task was to activate the SAL / PMN and CG-OP networks. Both networks have regions at or near the anterior insula and have been variably associated with response to task-relevant transients (see Dosenbach et al. 2006; Seeley et al. 2007; Seeley 2019 for discussion).\n\nParticipants viewed a sequence of uppercase letters O and K in either black or red. Participants pressed a button using their right index finger when a red K appeared and withheld their responses to all the other letter-color combinations. The random trial ordering was set using Optseq (Dale 1999). In each run, 10% of the trials were target red Ks, 10% were lure red Os, 40% were distractor black Ks, and 40% were distractor black Os. The contrast of interest was the target red Ks versus all other trials coded as the implicit baseline.\n\nEach run lasted 5 min 50 sec (350 frames with the first 6 frames removed for T1 equilibration). Following 6 sec of fixation overlapping the initial stabilization frames, a block of 20 sec of fixation was followed by a continuous extended block of 300 1-sec trials (0.15 sec presentation of the letter followed by 1.85 sec of fixation), and then a final 20-sec block of extended fixation. Before the first trial, a 2-sec start cue (1 sec “Begin”, 1 sec fixation) was presented, as well as a similar “End” cue after the final trial. Thus, the design was a rapid, event-related paradigm sandwiched between blocks of extended fixation. Five runs were collected for each participant. Runs were excluded from the analysis if participants missed more than six targets within a task run, which accounted for 20% of the total targets.\n\nWorking Memory (N-Back) Task.\n\nThe working memory (N-Back) task was extended from Cohen et al. (1994) and Braver et al. (1997) to explore demands on cognitive control under varied levels of memory load. Specifically, the N-Back task utilized a 2-back versus 0-back comparison to target FPN-A and FPN-B. In addition, following the design of the HCP N-Back task, multiple stimulus types / matching rules were included to explore whether the load effect was domain-flexible or domain-specialized (Barch et al. 2013).\n\nStimuli were presented sequentially in the center of the computer screen. Participants decided whether the current stimulus matched a consistent template target (the 0-Back or low load condition) or whether the current stimulus matched the stimulus presented two stimuli back in the sequence (the 2-Back or high load condition). Participants maintained fixation on a central crosshair throughout the run.\n\nThe stimuli varied across four conditions (Face, Word, Scene, and Letter) that were each presented in separate blocks. Faces and scenes were color images, with scenes showing both indoor and outdoor spaces and chosen not to feature people (faces from HCP; Barch et al. 2013; scenes generously provided by the Konkle laboratory; Konkle et al. 2012; Josephs and Konkle 2020). Letters included subsets of consonants, and words featured 1-syllable words from 10-word sets matched for length and frequency (as reported by the Corpus of Contemporary English; Davies 2008, vDecember 2015). In all but the Word condition, participants matched the stimuli to an exact stimulus referent, or the exact stimulus presented two trials before. For the Word condition, the participants decided if the current word rhymed with the target (e.g., “dream” would be a positive match with “steam”).\n\nEach N-Back run featured 8 blocks (a 0-Back and a 2-Back for each of the four stimulus categories). Each block included a cue and 9 trials. During the first cue stimulus, participants also saw the block type, either 2-Back or 0-Back. During 2-Back blocks, participants looked for matches (identical images or rhyming words) with the stimulus 2 trials back, and during 0-Back blocks, participants looked for matches to the cue. The background was black (matching the HCP format). All blocks included 2 target and 2 lure (repeated non-target) trials. Targets and lures were equally likely to appear in each viable trial position within and across runs. Participants pressed a button for every trial, indicating match (right index finger) or no-match (left index finger).\n\nEach run lasted 4 min 44 sec (284 frames with the first 12 frames removed for T1 equilibration). Following 12 sec of fixation overlapping the initial stabilization frames, an additional block of 12 sec of fixation was followed by blocks of the N-Back task interspersed with 15-sec fixation blocks (the fixation blocks came after two 25-sec N-Back task blocks). Across runs, 0-Back and 2-Back blocks, categories, and their interactions were counterbalanced. Each trial was 2.5 sec in duration (2 sec of stimulus presentation followed by 0.5 sec of fixation). The fixation crosshair was white for the extended fixation blocks and green during the N-Back task blocks. Within a run, all categories were seen before a category repeated. Eight runs were collected for each participant. Runs where participants missed responses in more than two trials were excluded from analysis.\n\nSentence Processing Task.\n\nThe Sentence Processing task was adapted from Fedorenko et al. (2010; 2012) to examine domain-specialized processing related to accessing word meaning and phrase-level meaning. The target task involved sentences presented one word at a time. The reference control task was presentation of nonword strings that were matched in length and visually similar. The goal of this task was to activate the LANG network (see Braga et al. 2020).\n\nParticipants passively read real sentences (“IN THE MORNING THE TAILOR WAS SHOWING DIFFERENT FABRICS TO THE CUSTOMER\") or pronounceable nonword strings (“SMOLE MUFRISONA VEDER SMOP FO BON FE PAME OMOSTREME GURY U FO”). The centered stimuli were presented one word (or nonword) at a time (0.45 sec per word). After each word or nonword string, a cue appeared for 0.50 sec, prompting the participants to make a right index finger button press. Stimuli, generously provided by the Fedorenko laboratory, never repeated. Word or nonword strings (6 sec each) were presented in 18-sec blocks of 3 strings. Extended fixation blocks (18 sec each) appeared at the start of each run and after every fourth string block. The primary comparison of interest was the contrast between sentence and nonword blocks.\n\nEach run lasted 5 min 0 sec (300 frames with the first 12 frames removed for T1 equilibration). Six runs were collected for each participant. Runs were excluded if the participant did not read the stimuli (observed through eye monitoring) or missed responses.\n\nTheory-of-Mind Task.\n\nThe Theory-of-Mind tasks were adopted from Saxe and colleagues to explore domain-specialized processing associated with representation of other’s mental states (Saxe and Kanwisher 2003; Dodell-Feder et al. 2011; Bruneau et al. 2012; Jacoby et al. 2016). In the False Belief paradigm, participants viewed a brief story and then, on a separate screen, a question about that story. In the False Belief condition, the target stories described events surrounding a person’s perspective, followed by a question about the thoughts and beliefs of that person. In the control False Photo condition, stories described similar situations involving objects (e.g., in photos, on maps, and in descriptions). In the Emotional / Physical Pain Stories paradigm (subsequently abbreviated ‘Pain’), the target stories described a situation that evoked personal emotional pain (Emo Pain condition) and were contrasted with control stories of similar length and complexity involving physical pain (Phys Pain condition). Participants rated the level of pain from “None” to “A Lot” during the question period. These two paradigms yield similar task activation maps (Jacoby et al. 2016). Here the task contrasts of False Belief versus False Photo and Emo Pain versus Phys Pain were combined with the goal to activate DN-B (extending from DiNicola et al. 2020).\n\nEach run consisted of a series of stories and questions (15 sec per individual story / question pairing). For both paradigms, each run included 5 target trials (False Belief or Emo Pain) and 5 control trials (False Photo or Phys Pain). 15-sec fixation periods occurred between trials. Stimuli, generously provided by the Saxe laboratory, never repeated.\n\nEach run lasted 5 min 18 sec (318 frames with the first 12 frames removed for T1 equilibration). Eight runs were collected for each participant – 4 of the False Belief paradigm and 4 of the Pain paradigm. We implemented an exclusion criterion to exclude any run with more than one missed trial. No runs met this criterion.\n\nEpisodic Projection Task.\n\nThe Episodic Projection task was adapted from Andrews-Hanna et al. (2010) and DiNicola et al (2020) to encourage processes related to remembering the past and imagining the future (prospection). In the target task conditions, participants viewed a brief scenario that oriented to a situation in the past (Past Self) or future (Future Self) simultaneously with a question about the event that encouraged participants to imagine the specific scenario described. The similarly structured control condition asked the participants about a present situation (Present Self). The task contrasts of Past Self versus Present Self and Future Self versus Present Self were combined with the goal to activate DN-A (extending from DiNicola et al. 2020). Of relevance, detailed behavioral analysis of these contrasts has suggested the main component process tracking increased response in DN-A is the process of mentally constructing scenes (DiNicola et al. 2023; see also Hassabis and Maguire 2007). Thus, the task contrast used here taps into domain-specialized processing related to spatial / scene processing (see Hassabis and Maguire 2009 for discussion).\n\nEach run contained a series of scenarios with questions (10 sec of scenario / question presentation, followed by 10 sec of fixation). 30 questions appeared per run, with 3 per each condition of relevance (Past Self, Future Self, Present Self). Additional conditions were included towards goals distinct from those targeted here. For our analyses, we focus on the condition contrasts that have previously dissociated DN-A from DN-B in DiNicola et al. (2020). All scenarios were unique.\n\nEach run lasted 10 min 17 sec (617 frames with the first 12 frames removed for T1 equilibration). Ten runs were collected for each participant that included 90 relevant trials across runs (30 of each of the 3 conditions). Runs with more than two missed trials were excluded.\n\nWithin-individual Task Activation Analysis\n\nFunctional task data were analyzed using the general linear model (GLM) as implemented by FSL’s first-level FEAT (FSL version 5.0.4; Woolrich et al. 2001). All conditions were included in each model design, even those not relevant to the contrasts of interest, except for the Oddball Effect task contrast which coded the targets against the implicit baseline. The data were high-pass filtered using a cutoff of 100 sec (0.01-Hz) to remove low- frequency noise within each run. GLM outputs included, for each contrast, β-values for each vertex that were converted, within FEAT, to z-values. Within each participant, z-value maps from all runs were averaged together using fslmaths (Smith et al. 2004) to create a single cross-session map for each contrast of interest. For the N-Back task, GLM outputs included z-value maps for each trial block, which were averaged by condition across runs. A single cross-session contrast map was then created by taking the difference between condition mean maps.\n\nTask contrasts were designed to functionally target specific networks and dissociate response properties between networks. Two convergent methods were used for visualization and quantification. First, z-value maps were compared visually by overlaying the borders of networks onto the task contrast maps on the same cortical surface (fsaverage6 cortical surface). This form of visualization allowed comprehensive assessment of task response patterns. Contrast z-value maps were manually thresholded to best demonstrate the task activation patterns for each participant. The PSYCH-FIXED look-up table within Connectome Workbench was used for the color scale.\n\nSecond, a priori networks within-individuals were used to formally quantify differences in response levels between networks, including direct tests for significant differences between networks and between task contrasts. For each task contrast, the average z-value was calculated for all vertices within each selected network, combining across hemispheres. Mean z-values were computed for each task run, and the cross-run mean z-values for each network was then plotted in a bar graph, along with the standard error of the mean across participants. This analysis has the advantage of quantifying the magnitude and variance of the response in each a priori defined network for each participant, without any subjective decisions.\n\nFor both approaches to task response analysis, the networks were defined within the individuals prior to examination of the task maps, to avoid the possibility of bias.\n\nSoftware and Statistical Analysis\n\nFunctional connectivity between brain regions was calculated in MATLAB (version 2019a; http://www.mathworks.com; MathWorks, Natick, MA) using Pearson’s product moment correlations. FreeSurfer v6.0.0, FSL, and AFNI were used during data processing. The estimates of networks in volume space were visualized in FreeView v6.0.0. The estimates of networks on the cortical space were visualized in Connectome Workbench v1.3.2. Statistical analyses were performed using R v3.6.2. Model-free seed-region confirmations were performed in Connectome Workbench v1.3.2. Network parcellation was performed using code from Kong et al. (2019) on Github: (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Kong2019_MSHBM).\n\nResults\n\nNetworks Can Be Estimated Robustly Within Individuals\n\nNetworks were estimated for the refinement stage data using a 15-network MS-HBM model. through display the main results for S1 and S2 on the surface, and the Supplementary Materials display the comprehensive results and quality control visualizations on the surface and in the native volume.\n\nThe first results pertain to data quality. The SNR maps are displayed on the cortical surface ( and ). Most of the cortical mantle possessed high SNR. As expected, given signal dropout near the sinuses and the inner ear (Ojemann et al. 1997), there is variability in SNR across the cortical surface with orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and adjacent ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), rostral inferior temporal cortex, and the temporal pole showing low SNR (see Supplementary Materials for additional visualizations). Network assignments in low SNR regions should be interpreted cautiously.\n\nThe primary result of our procedures was an estimated parcellation into distinct candidate networks. and display the 15-network estimates for S1 and S2. All networks, including local sensory and motor networks, as well as distributed association networks, were identified in both participants. While the general organization was shared between the two participants, the spatial boundaries were idiosyncratic. These patterns will be elaborated upon in detail in the upcoming results of the novel 15 participants. For these first two individuals we focused on validating the methods.\n\nModel-Free Seed-Region Based Correlation Confirms the 15-Network Parcellation\n\nThe network estimates were based on a 15-network MS-HBM model. In addition to assuming a specific number of networks, the method also employed group priors to constrain the estimates (see Supplementary Materials). As such, it is possible that the resultant networks do not accurately reflect the underlying within-individual correlation patterns as one might expect. To explore this possibility and intuitively visualize the degree to which the model captures underlying correlation patterns, a model-free seed-region based correlation analysis was performed. A seed region was placed in an anterior position and separately a posterior position within each network within each individual. The resulting correlation maps are displayed in and in relation to the MS-HBM network boundaries.\n\nThe estimated networks captured features of the correlation patterns remarkably well including across small, distributed regions that might otherwise be overlooked. The alignments were not perfect. Specifically, the correlation patterns included most of the distributed regions in the MS-HBM solutions, and the patterns were largely selective to the estimated networks. Small deviations, in the form of extensions of the patterns beyond the network boundaries were common, likely in part because the network estimates forced a winner-take-all assignment, but also possibly because additional network details may be missed5. The consistency between the general correlational structure and the network estimates in one sense is unsurprising because the underlying correlation matrix was employed by the network model. However, it is not obligated, and deviation could be seen if the model forced assignments, or the model failed to capture the structure of the data.\n\nThe 15-Network Parcellation Captures Features that Are Not Captured by a 10-Network Parcellation\n\nWe next sought to explore what is gained by adopting the 15-network parcellation rather than the simpler 10-network parcellation. and display the MS-HBM parcellation estimate for the 10-network and 15-network solutions for each participant. The first notable result is that, for most networks, there was little difference between the two models’ estimates. For example, the separation of DN-A and DN-B was well captured by both model solutions with the distributed spatial patterns and idiosyncratic features quite similar between models. That is, if the goal were to study DN-A and DN-B, there is little gained by utilizing the more complex 15-network model. In both S1 and S2, many of the other major networks were also similar between the two parcellations, including FPN-A, FPN-B, SMOT-A and SMOT-B. Thus, for networks well captured by the 10-network model, they appear to be roughly unchanged in the 15-network model. For other networks though, there were substantive differences.\n\nOne motivation for investigating a 15-network model was that certain networks did not differentiate established distinctions at or around somatomotor cortex and visual cortex, as well as between multiple networks within or adjacent to the insula including separation of a Cingular-Opercular Network from a Salience Network (Seeley et al. 2007; see Seeley, 2019 for discussion). These features were captured in the 15-network MS-HBM. Specifically, the single visual network in the 10-network estimate was differentiated among dATN-B, VIS-C and VIS-P in the 15-network solution ( ). The SAL network in the 10-network estimate was differentiated into two separate networks here labeled SAL / PMN and CG-OP ( ). The dATN in the 10-network estimate was differentiated into dATN-A and PM-PPr in the 15-network solution ( ), and a distinct AUD network emerged near to LANG and SMOT-B ( ). Critically, seed-region based correlation patterns suggested that this expansion of networks from 10 to 15 captured clear features of the underlying correlation patterns ( , , , and ).\n\nOne unexpected result was that our 15-network parcellation included a single network that has been variably described in the literature. What has been called the “Parietal Memory Network” (Gilmore et al. 2015), with focus on the posterior midline, has often been discussed separately from the network referred to by Seeley and colleagues as the “Salience Network” (Seeley 2019). Here a single distributed network was identified that possessed the canonical features of both networks. The seed-region based correlation maps supported that the two networks discussed historically as distinct are likely a single network ( , , ), a result that will be further examined in the prospectively acquired and analyzed data.\n\nNetwork Estimates Are Reliable Within Individuals\n\nWe next sought to address two related questions. First, are the network estimates described above reliable within individuals? Second, can they be obtained with a lesser amount of data? The resting-state fixation runs of S1 and S2 were divided into three datasets with roughly equal amounts of runs contributing to each data subset (20/20/22 runs of data for S1 and 20/20/21 runs of data for S2). The 15-network MS-HBM was estimated independently for each data subset. Results are displayed in .\n\nIn S1, 84.2% of cortical vertices were assigned to the same networks across the three independent datasets from within the individual. In S2, 88.0% of cortical vertices were assigned to the same networks. By contrast, overlap between the separate parcellations of S1 and S2 were 58.3%, 58.9% and 59.2%, indicating that between-individual variability was substantially larger than within-individual variability.\n\nThese findings suggest that cortical parcellations of the resolution and within-individual detail targeted here are replicable for models based on ~20 runs of data. Notably, this is the amount of data collected for the 15 new participants in the implementation stage dataset analyzed throughout the rest of this paper.\n\nNetwork Estimates in 15 New Participants Reveal Organizational Features\n\nDiscovery, Replication and Triplication in the Implementation Stage Data.\n\n15 cerebral networks were estimated for all new participants. The 15 individuals were analyzed within subsamples (each n = 5) intended to replicate the MS-HBM’s network estimates in prospective participants including novel discovery (P1-P5), replication (P6-P10) and triplication (P11-P15) datasets. Results were similar across all three subsamples, and the full parcellation for each individual is available in the Supplementary Materials on the surface and within the individual’s own native-space volume. Despite idiosyncratic spatial details of network organization, the broad properties were largely consistent. Three representative participants, one from each subsample, are displayed in to .\n\nNetwork Estimates Reveal Predominantly Local Sensory and Motor Networks.\n\nVIS-C and VIS-P were identified in each participant extending from the calcarine sulcus on the midline to the lateral surface. The extent of the two networks across the occipital lobe did not align them with individual visual areas, but rather the expanded regions of the V1/V2/V3 retinotopic cluster, and likely adjacent retinotopic clusters (Wandell et al. 2005; Wandell, Domoulin, Brewer 2007). The multiple networks appeared to divide along the eccentricity gradient (Buckner and Yeo 2014). The VIS-C network overlapped regions likely aligned to the central portions of the V1/V2/V3 retinotopic representations, while VIS-P overlapped the peripheral retinotopic representations (see Yeo et al. 2011). The relation of VIS-C and VIS-P to task-elicited responses is directly explored in a later section.\n\nWhile the VIS-C and VIS-P networks contained vertices that were mostly contiguous, there were exceptions. Discontinuous islands were sometimes found in occipital-temporal cortex, possibly a reflection of separate extrastriate retinotopic clusters (e.g., at or near the MT/V5 hemifield representation). VIS-P also occasionally contained small, punctate representations near to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). These were the exceptions: the majority of the VIS-C and VIS-P networks’ included vertices were continuous and adjacent to one another, overlapping the expected location of early retinotopic visual cortex.\n\nSimilarly, SMOT-A and SMOT-B were identified reliably as spatially continuous networks along the central sulcus, extending onto the midline and into the posterior insula. These two somatomotor networks also do not likely align to individual architectonic areas, but rather extend across the pre- and post-central sulcus including primary motor as well as somatosensory areas. The extent along the midline and into the posterior insula further suggests the networks span multiple body maps, not simply the dominant inverted body map along the central sulcus. The separation into two networks is consistent with separation of distinct portions of the somatotopic map along the body axis, a functional hypothesis that will also be directly tested in a later section.\n\nA final predominantly local sensory network, AUD, was consistently identified near to the superior temporal sulcus. This network extended across the full supratemporal plane including Heschl’s gyrus, and into adjacent regions.\n\nMultiple Distributed Networks Lie Adjacent to the Local Sensory and Motor Networks.\n\nMultiple distributed networks were identified in each participant that were immediately adjacent to the local sensory and motor networks, with each network containing distributed regions that spanned multiple zones of cortex. dATN-A and dATN-B were adjacent to VIS-C and VIS-P but also with distant regions in the frontal cortex, likely at or near the frontal eye field (FEF) (Corbetta & Shulman 2002; Hutchinson et al. 2012). Similarly, CG-OP and PM-PPr radiated outwards from the early somatomotor networks SMOT-A and SMOT-B. CG-OP and PM-PPr sometimes contained small islands indenting or even within the SMOT network boundaries that may relate to interspersed inter-effector regions along the central sulcus (Gordon et al. 2023). CG-OP and PM-PPr also included regions abutting and within the Sylvian fissure. The relations among the networks will become even clearer in the upcoming flat map visualizations.\n\nA final network, SAL / PMN, displayed a spatial pattern that was adjacent to CG-OP in many locations but also with differences. While SAL / PMN contained a prominent region in the anterior insula, the network’s positioning did not juxtapose the somatosensory networks. Rather, SAL / PMN was adjacent to a posterior midline cluster of association networks near to regions of the canonical “Default Network” (e.g., Shulman et al. 1997; Buckner et al. 2008; Power et al. 2011; Yeo et al. 2011). SAL / PMN consistently included a region within ACC anterior to CG-OP and a prominent set of regions along the mid-cingulate and the posterior midline. As noted for S1 and S2, the SAL / PMN network’s spatial pattern combined features described in prior work on the Salience Network (Seeley et al. 2007; see Seeley 2019 for discussion and Dosenbach et al. 2006 for related work) and the Parietal Memory Network (Gilmore et al. 2015).\n\nMuch of Association Cortex is Populated by Multiple Parallel Juxtaposed Networks.\n\nThe remaining regions of association cortex -- that contain the majority of PFC, a large region of PPC extending into the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and lateral temporal cortex (LTC) -- were populated by five distinct networks. With some exceptions, each of these five networks tended to possess regions in each of the distributed zones. The five networks were interwoven with local patterns of adjacencies that repeated across cortex.\n\nSpecifically, FPN-A and FPN-B were adjacent to one another throughout the cortical mantle. FPN-A and FPN-B displayed a distributed pattern consistent with the well-studied group-estimated Frontoparietal Control Network, also referred to as the Multiple-Demand System (Duncan et al. 2010; Power et al. 2011; Yeo et al. 2011). These two juxtaposed networks (FPN-A and FPN-B) consistently neighbored an additional clustered set of three networks – LANG, DN-B, and DN-A. These three additional networks were tightly juxtaposed among themselves on the lateral cortical surface including zones within PPC, LTC, and both DLPFC and VLPFC. DN-A and DN-B were interdigitated as well along the anterior and posterior midline, consistent with previous studies (Braga and Buckner 2017; Gordon et al. 2017; Braga et al. 2019).\n\nDespite being adjacent in many locations, clear features distinguished the three networks. The LANG network surrounded the Sylvian fissure and included regions near to the AUD network and in VLPFC at or near historically defined “Broca’s area”. The LANG network was generally larger in the left hemisphere compared to the right (but see Braga et al. 2020 for an exception). DN-A showed a strong correlation with the posterior parahippocampal cortex (PHC) (see also Reznick et al. 2023 for further details). Additionally, DN-A occupied regions at or adjacent to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and ventral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). DN-B prominently included anterior regions of the inferior parietal lobule extending into the TPJ (a region of particular focus, e.g., Saxe and Kanwisher 2003; Jacoby et al. 2016). The posterior midline region of DN-B fell between regions of DN-A and specifically did not extend into RSC. DN-B also included a larger region of the LTC than DN-A; DN-A tended to include a small region or a few discontinuous regions in anterior LTC.\n\nOf importance, the spatial arrangements of the five networks (FPN-A, FPN-B, LANG, DN-B, and DN-A) repeated multiple times across the cortical mantle, a discovery that will be expanded upon in the analyses of spatial juxtapositions on the flattened cortical surface.\n\nA Cautionary Note About Potential Artifacts\n\nCertain aspects of the network estimates were impacted by signal loss. Low SNR regions were observed in the OFC, ventral regions of VLPFC, and anterior regions of the temporal lobe (see and , and Supplementary Materials). When interpreting the network assignments, it is important to keep these spatially variable effects in mind. For example, a localized AUD network was observed across the supratemporal plane including Heschl’s gyrus. Inconsistent, discontinuous vertices were also labelled as part of the AUD network in the inferior temporal cortex and OFC, in the regions of the greatest signal dropout due to magnetic susceptibility differences. The network assignments in low SNR regions should not be trusted.\n\nModel-Free Seed-Region Based Correlations Again Confirm Network Estimates\n\nTo demonstrate that the correlation properties of the within-individual data were captured in the network assignments, seed-region based correlation maps were visualized. While there were minor differences between the MS-HBM network estimates and the seed-region based correlation maps, networks could be identified in all participants using both methods. Furthermore, the maps defined by anterior and posterior seed regions were similar, indicating that the seed-region based method was not dependent on a single vertex or one general region of cortex. Seed-region based confirmation for DN-A, DN-B, LANG, FPN-A, FPN-B, CG-OP, and SAL / PMN are displayed for three representative participants in to , and for all participants in the Supplementary Materials.\n\nVariability in Network Estimates Across Individuals\n\nAn overlap map of assignments for each network from the MS-HBM model for the 15 participants is displayed in . Results revealed that the general organization of the networks was highly conserved across individuals, but with differences in the idiosyncratic spatial positioning and extents of the networks.\n\nA challenge in examining spatial overlap is that there is circularity in network definition since the process initiates with the same 15-network group prior, which could bias the networks to show more overlap than is truly in the data. To mitigate this concern, we also examined overlap using the network estimates derived from the seed-region correlation maps. These maps are not constrained by the group prior and do not enforce a winner-take-all assumption, allowing deviations to emerge. Overlap maps of correlation patterns were obtained using anterior and posterior seed regions within each network for all 15 participants ( ).\n\nAs a final exploration of variability, the individual networks were plotted next to one another for all 15 participants, allowing another means to identify shared and idiosyncratic features of each participant’s estimate. The results of this final analysis are available in the Supplementary Materials.\n\nHigher-Order Networks Nest Outwards from Primary Cortices\n\nTo better reveal spatial relations among networks, a flattened cortical surface was constructed ( ). The 15 networks are displayed in representative participants in to , and for all participants in the Supplementary Materials. A broad observation was that higher-order networks nest outwards from sensory and motor cortices.\n\nSpecifically, the networks could be heuristically grouped into three levels beginning with first-order sensory and motor networks6. The first-order networks were primarily locally organized, spatially arranged along the central sulcus (for SMOT-A and SMOT-B) and near to the calcarine sulcus (for VIS-C and VIS-P). Surrounding these first-order networks were adjacent networks that radiated outwards. We refer these as second-order networks. CG-OP and PM-PPr surrounded SMOT-A and SMOT-B, and dATN-A and dATN-B were adjacent to VIS-C and VIS-P. In between these second-order networks were third-order networks (FPN-A and FPN-B, LANG, DN-B, DN-A) that populated the large, expanded zones of higher-order association cortex. The flattened representation allowed further features to be appreciated.\n\nCG-OP and PM-PPr nearly fully surrounded both the anterior and posterior extents of the somatomotor networks, including the insular regions that are buried within the Sylvian fissure. While CG-OP and PM-PPr were generally interdigitated around the first-order somatomotor networks, in several locations CG-OP fell distal to PM-PPr (meaning PM-PPr directly juxtaposed SMOT-A and SMOT-B and CG-OP juxtaposed PM-PPr). Furthermore, while the PM-PPr network was adjacent to the somatomotor networks across its extent, CG-OP also involved distant regions in PFC and posterior association zones that were not adjacent to somatomotor networks. Thus, CG-OP possessed a partially distributed motif. Additional details of dATN-A and dATN-B were also evident. Of the two networks, dATN-B fell more proximal to the early visual networks and dATN-A more distal. dATN-A included distributed regions in frontal cortex at or near FEF, while dATN-B was more locally organized but not exclusively so.\n\nComparing dATN-A and dATN-B with CG-OP and PM-PPr, as highlighted in panels A and B of to , revealed parallel features. The second-order networks were all spatially anchored near to the early (first-order) sensory and motor networks, appearing as if they grew out or formed from the earlier networks. And, despite being far apart in their major extents, both sets of networks had distributed components with adjacencies in frontal cortex. Thus, from the standpoint of a potential hierarchy among networks, these second-order networks possess a motif that anchors them to the early sensory and motor networks and simultaneously connects them to distributed zones of cortex.\n\nWe provisionally label SAL / PMN as a second-order network, but it has juxtapositions that differentiate it from the other second-order networks. Across much of its extent, SAL / PMN paralleled CG-OP with multiple juxtapositions. SAL / PMN differed in that it was not adjacent to early sensory and motor networks. Rather, SAL / PMN contained regions that were near to the network labeled DN-A, especially along the posterior midline, where its regions could easily be confused with the large DN-A and DN-B regions that occupied much of the posterior midline.\n\nThe zones farthest away from the sensory and motor regions were populated by five third-order association networks (FPN-A, FPN-B, LANG, DN-B, and DN-A). Each third-order network possessed regions distributed widely throughout association cortex. Moreover, regions of distinct third-order networks displayed side-by-side juxtapositions with a pattern that repeated similarly across multiple zones of cortex. We will focus on these repeating clusters of five networks extensively in later sections.\n\nSomatomotor and Visual Networks Respond to Body Movements and Visual Stimulation in a Topographic Manner\n\nThe spatial extent of task-elicited responses to body movements and visual stimulation were mapped in direct relation to the network boundaries. The goal of these analyses was to explore whether within-individual network estimates predict task responses. In all cases, the network boundaries were established before examination of the task responses. illustrates the mapping strategy, and displays the detailed body movement and visual stimulation maps for one representative participant on the inflated and flattened surfaces. Several results are notable.\n\nFirst, while not without exceptions, body movements and visual stimulation elicited responses that were aligned to, and generally filled in, the first-order network estimates (SMOT-A, SMOT-B, VIS-C, and VIS-P). That is, the idiosyncratic network estimates in each individual predicted the localization of the movement and visual stimulation responses. The visual responses often extended beyond the anterior boundaries of VIS-C and VIS-P, including visually responsive portions of dATN-B.\n\nSecond, the main body map along the central sulcus extended across networks (SMOT-A and SMOT-B) as did the retinotopic eccentricity gradient (VIS-C and VIS-P). Within the visual system, there was a clear correspondence between the two visual networks and eccentricity. VIS-C, as anticipated given its anatomical position, tracked the central representation. VIS-P covered the peripheral representation. A gap emerged for the most peripheral regions of the dorsal and ventral eccentricity portions of VIS-P, likely because the visual stimulation did not extend fully to the periphery (see Park et al. 2023). Within the somatosensory and motor systems, there was a distinct gap between the representations of the hand and glutes which may be an inter-effector region (Gordon et al. 2023).\n\nThird, the response patterns, like the networks, did not align to expected boundaries of individual brain areas (i.e., V1, S1). The body movements activated regions pre- and post-central sulcus, spanning multiple motor and somatosensory areas. Examined in detail, the body movement responses suggest at least three distinct maps of the main body axis, labeled I, II, and III in . The largest distinct body map was found aligned to primary somatomotor cortex, exhibiting a medial-to-lateral progression from foot to hand to tongue ( , labeled I). In the posterior insula, the body map was buried with a posterior to anterior orientation ( , labeled II). On the medial wall, the body map progressed from anterior to posterior ( , labeled III). Similarly, the visual responses spanned the extent of at least the V1/V2/V3 retinotopic cluster, with networks cutting across areas (verified through polar mapping as illustrated in ). Thus, the response patterns confirm that early somatomotor and visual networks group multiple areas together and are separated one from another along topographic gradients (e.g., VIS-C versus VIS-P).\n\nThe features described above can be observed in additional participants ( ), and in all participants with available task data as shown in the Supplemental Materials.\n\nCG-OP and SAL / PMN Respond to Salient Transients\n\nThe oddball task was designed to measure the transient response to uncommon visually salient targets that require participant response. The mapping strategy is illustrated in . On the flattened cortical surface, the within-individual a priori-defined networks CG-OP and SAL / PMN are displayed in relation to the Oddball Effect task contrast. The details of the Oddball Effect task contrast are shown for one representative participant in . illustrates that the features can be observed in additional participants, and in all participants as shown in the Supplemental Materials.\n\nThe Oddball Effect task contrast response was widely distributed across the cortex. The response prominently involved the distributed regions of the CG-OP and SAL / PMN networks, including regions in the anterior insula as well as along the posterior midline. These collective regions revealing an Oddball Effect task contrast response have been the emphasis of prior studies separately focused on the Salience Network and Parietal Memory Network. Thus, as predicted by the hypothesis that SAL / PMN is a single network, the response pattern observed here extended across the full distributed extent of the network.\n\nIn addition to the consistent responses across the distributed regions of CG-OP and SAL / PMN, additional responses were reliably observed – a response along the central sulcus in the left hemisphere near the estimated location of the hand representation and along the calcarine sulcus near the central representation of the visual field (contrast with ). The response in the hand region of the central sulcus was exclusively in the left hemisphere consistent with the right-handed response.\n\nTo quantify the selectivity of the task response, the mean z-values for the Oddball Effect task contrast were calculated separately for each association network. The estimates were obtained within the bounds of each individual’s a priori defined networks and then averaged across participants (N = 14). Quantification at the group level showed a strong, significant positive response to oddball targets in both the CG-OP (t(13) = 7.97, p < 0.001) and SAL / PMN networks (t(13) = 6.21, p < 0.001). By contrast, for many of the third-order association networks, the response was significantly negative (DN-A: t(13) = −11.76, p < 0.001, DN-B: t(13) = −8.81, p < 0.001, LANG: t(13) = −3.82, p < 0.01, FPN-B: t(13) = −3.02, p < 0.01), with FPN-A being the exception. FPN-A showed a weak, non-significant positive response (t(13) = 1.82, p = 0.09). These observations suggest that the CG-OP and SAL / PMN networks are recruited during the Oddball Effect task contrast.\n\nGiven the historical focus on the Salience Network and Parietal Memory Network as separate networks, and their proximity along the posterior midline to the Default Network, we replotted the Oddball Effect task contrast on the inflated surface ( ). For this visualization, the task map threshold was reduced to zero. Much of the full extent of the CG-OP and SAL / PMN networks was strongly activated. The positive response included the posterior midline regions that have been the focus of the Parietal Memory Network (Gilmore et al. 2015) as well as the anterior insula region that has been a focus of the Salience Network (Seeley et al. 2007; 2019). An interesting feature is that islands of the CG-OP network that fell within the frontal midline showed positive responses in the within-individual maps ( ). These small responses, which were adjacent to large regions with an opposite response pattern, were absent in the group-averaged response ( , bottom). The positive response was not selective to these two specific networks, with motor and visual responses as noted earlier. The positive response also extended into the region of the visual second-order networks (e.g., dATN-B).\n\nCritically, the networks at or near the historical Default Network, here estimated within-individuals as encompassing at least DN-A and DN-B, were all strongly ‘deactivated’ meaning more active during the implicitly coded baseline reference than during the salient targets. That is, the contrast replicated the task deactivation pattern that originally generated interest in the Default Network (Shulman et al. 1997; Mazoyer et al. 2001; Raichle et al. 2001) in the presence of a robust positive response across the distributed extent of the SAL / PMN network. Thus, the separation of the effects along the posterior midline revealed a spatial dissociation between the second-order network SAL / PMN and the third-order networks DN-A and DN-B.\n\nHigher-Order Zones of Association Cortex Possess a Repeating Motif\n\nDistributed throughout association cortex, in the zones roughly7 between the second-order networks, were the five association networks FPN-A, FPN-B, LANG, DN-B, and DN-A ( ). Among these networks, side-by-side juxtapositions repeated across multiple cortical zones (refer to I, II, III and IV in ). FPN-A and FPN-B were reliably positioned adjacent to one another and, as a pair, were adjacent to a repeating group of the three other networks: LANG, DN-B and DN-A. We call these repeating clusters of five networks Supra-Areal Association Megaclusters or SAAMs. The reproducibility of the SAAMs across participants was striking and is illustrated for the posterior association zones in all 15 participants in . While the idiosyncratic spatial details varied, multiple SAAMs were consistently observed. The remaining task analyses explored functional response properties of the association networks embedded within the SAAMs.\n\nFPN-A and FPN-B Respond to Domain-Flexible Working Memory Demands\n\nThe functional properties of the association networks comprising the SAAMs (FPN-A, FPN-B, LANG, DN-B, DN-A) were explored first in relation to domain-flexible demands on working memory and, in the next section, in relation to domain-specialized processing functions. The hypothesis was that FPN-A and FPN-B would modulate their response in relation to increasing working memory load across multiple verbal and non-verbal stimulus conditions. The mapping strategy is illustrated in . On the flattened cortical surface, the within-individual a priori-defined networks FPN-A and FPN-B are displayed in relation to the N-Back Load Effect task contrast (collapsed across stimulus conditions). The N-Back Load Effect task contrast is shown in detail in for one representative participant. illustrates that the features can be observed in additional participants, and in all participants with available task data in the Supplemental Materials.\n\nAs hypothesized, the N-Back Load Effect task contrast increased activation within and near the boundaries of the FPN-A and FPN-B networks ( and ). The widely distributed response included extensive regions of PFC, as well as regions of PPC and the dorsal ACC – all canonical regions associated with domain-flexible cognitive control (e.g., Duncan 2001; Cromer et al. 2010; Duncan 2013; Fedorenko et al. 2012). As predicted by the network estimates, there was also a response in LTC and a small subregion of the anterior insula that is spatially distinct from that of other networks.\n\nOf equal importance was the consistent absence of response in the distributed association regions linked to the LANG, DN-B, and DN-A networks, including within the PPC and LTC. In essence, the N-Back Load Effect task contrast split the SAAMs and activated the portions linked to the FPN-A and FPN-B networks selectively with minimal or no response in the juxtaposed portions associated with the LANG, DN-B, and DN-A networks.\n\nTo quantify the selectivity of the task response, the mean z-values for the N-Back Load Effect task contrast were calculated separately for each association network. The estimates were obtained within the bounds of each individual’s independent a priori defined networks and then averaged (N = 15). Results plotted in reveal a positive N-Back Load Effect response that was strongest in FPN-A (t(14) = 21.67, p < 0.001) and also quite strong in FPN-B (t(14) = 6.45, p < 0.001). SAL / PMN unexpectedly showed a significant positive response (t(14) = 7.91, p < 0.001) that was significantly weaker than either FPN-A (t(14) = −15.09, p < 0.001) or FPN-B (t(14) = −2.91, p < 0.01). Thus, while SAL / PMN showed a response, the functional response was less relative to FPN-A and FPN-B, opposite to the pattern found earlier (contrast with ). The remaining networks, including the three additional networks that were adjacent within the SAAMs, showed a negative N-Back Load Effect. The effect was significantly negative for DN-A (t(14) = −4.85, p < 0.001) and DN-B (t(14) = −7.14, p < 0.001) but not LANG (t(14) = −0.81, p = 0.43). These results provide evidence that two parallel networks – FPN-A, FPN-B – are involved in processes enhanced by increasing working memory demands, while other juxtaposed networks – LANG, DN-B and DN-A – are functionally dissociated, consistent with the qualitative patterns visualized in the activation maps.\n\nTo further investigate the domain flexibility of FPN-A and FPN-B, the mean z-values for each of the four stimulus conditions of the N-Back Load Effect (Face, Letter, Word, and Scene) were separately plotted ( ). Both FPN-A (Face: t(14) = 11.74; Letter: t(14) = 16.03; Word: t(14) = 11.30; Scene: t(14) = 12.05, all p < 0.001) and FPN-B (Face: t(14) = 5.13; Letter: t(14) = 5.60; Word: t(14) = 5.15; Scene: t(14) = 5.54, all p < 0.001) exhibited a significant response across all conditions of the N-Back Load Effect task contrast, supporting that their processing role generalizes across both verbal and nonverbal domains. That is, FPN-A and FPN-B responded robustly to working memory demands, more so than adjacent networks and did so in a do’ain-flexible manner.\n\nLANG, DN-B, and DN-A Respond Differentially to Distinct Cognitive Domains\n\nAmong the networks that populate the distributed zones of higher-order association cortex, FPN-A and FPN-B responded in a domain-flexible manner to increasing working memory load. The adjacent trio of networks – LANG, DN-B, and DN-A – did not. In our final analyses, we explored the functional specialization of these additional three networks by examining Episodic Projection, Theory-of-Mind and Sentence Processing task contrasts designed to emphasize distinct specialized domains of higher-order cognitive processing.\n\nThe mapping strategy is illustrated in . On the flattened cortical surface, the within-individual a priori-defined networks LANG, DN-B, and DN-A are displayed in relation to the three separate task contrasts simultaneously, to illustrate the adjacency of the responses in relation to each other and to the network boundaries. The details of one composite task contrast map are displayed for a representative participant in . illustrates additional participants, and all participants with available data are shown in the Supplemental Materials. Several results are notable.\n\nFirst, the composite activation patterns across the three task contrasts filled in the remaining zones of association cortex. Strikingly, the domain-specialized task responses are situated adjacent to, but separate from, the regions activated by domain-flexible working memory demands (contrast with ). This separation can be seen in many locations, with a particularly clear example visualized within the PPC where the N-Back Load Effect task contrast showed a posterodorsal response relative to the three current task contrasts. The side-by-side juxtaposition of domain-specialized and domain-flexible regions was also observed within LTC and multiple locations throughout PFC.\n\nSecond, within each juxtaposed cluster of domain-specialized regions, the region preferentially responding to the Sentence Processing task contrast abutted the region preferentially responding to the Theory-of-Mind task contrast, and these abutted the region preferentially responding to the Episodic Project task contrast. While overlap and exceptions were found, the differential response patterns generally tracked the network separations between LANG, DN-B, and DN-A. The idiosyncratic positions and boundaries of the three networks in any given individual – LANG, DN-B, and DN-A – predicted the positions of the domain-specialized activation responses ( ).\n\nThus, within each local zone the regions associated with the separate networks responded to their distinct specialized cognitive domains. Moreover, the spatially differentiated response patterns repeated across the multiple SAAMs (refer to I, II, III and IV in ). There were exceptions. For example, regions of task activation in VLPFC did not overlap well with the estimated networks in P12. The discrepancies tended to fall within anterior temporal regions and PFC regions where SNR is low, raising the possibility that technical variance played a role. To reveal the details of the task maps more fully, the Supplementary Materials include task maps for each task contrast separately in addition to the composite maps for all available participants.\n\nThe response was quantified for each of the three task contrasts for each network to formally test for the hypothesized interaction. For each domain-specialized task contrast, the z-values within the bounds of each individual’s three independent a priori defined networks (LANG, DN-B and DN-A) were obtained and then averaged (N = 13). The resulting mean z-values are plotted in . A repeated measures ANOVA on network-level task response revealed a significant 3 × 3 interaction between the effect of task contrast and network (F(4, 48) = 77.82, p < 0.001). Paired t-tests then tested the individual contrasts, with the hypothesis that each network’s within-domain response would be significantly greater than either of the other two networks. All six of these planned comparisons were significant. The Episodic Projection task contrast recruited DN-A regions over those of DN-B (t(12) = 16.38, p < 0.001) and LANG (t(12) = 14.49, p < 0.001). The Theory-of-Mind task recruited DN-B regions over those of DN-A (t(12) = 5.27, p < 0.001) and LANG (t(12) = 10.09, p < 0.001), and the Sentence Processing task contrast recruited the LANG regions over those of DN-A (t(12) = 6.55, p < 0.001) and DN-B (t(12) = 5.42, p < 0.001).\n\nThus, in addition to the qualitative impressions ( – ), statistical tests revealed the full interaction was significant with all pairwise tests also significant in support of a triple functional dissociation across the three networks. These observations suggest that the parallel networks LANG, DN-B, and DN-A, with adjacent regions across multiple cortical zones, are specialized to support distinct higher-order cognitive domains.\n\nDiscussion\n\nDetailed network estimates reveal a global organization that can be conceptualized as three levels of cortical hierarchy: locally-organized first-order sensory and motor networks, spatially adjacent second-order networks that link to distant regions, and third-order networks that populate and connect widely distributed zones of higher-order association cortex. Repeating side-by-side spatial juxtapositions among the third-order association networks form organized motifs that we call Supra-Areal Association Megaclusters or SAAMs. Within each SAAM, the regions linked to distinct association networks demonstrate differential task response properties. Certain networks contribute to domain-flexible cognitive control and others to domain-specialized processes involved in language, social, and spatial / episodic functions. We discuss the practical and conceptual implications of these findings including how repeating organizational motifs might arise during development.\n\nWithin-Individual Network Estimates\n\nIn the present work, we explored the utility of a 15-network MS-HBM estimate of cerebral cortical organization that allowed the idiosyncratic details of each individual’s own anatomy to guide the solutions (e.g., and ). The method yielded robust, stable network estimates that were confirmed using analyses of seed-region based correlation (e.g., and ). All quantitative analyses and visual inspections of the data reinforced that the present 15-network estimate captured a great deal of the structured correlations present in the underlying data. From a methodological standpoint, the present results indicate that a MS-HBM can be used to estimate networks automatically and robustly within individuals (Kong et al. 2019; Xue et al. 2021). Several features of our network estimates revise or expand earlier ideas.\n\nFirst, the current network parcellation falls into a class of within-individual network estimates that refine group-based estimates. In group-based estimates, including multiple estimates from our laboratory, large monolithic networks have been identified that encompass extensive regions of association cortex (e.g., Damoiseaux et al. 2006; Yeo et al. 2011; Power et al. 2011; Doucet et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2013). Our network estimates are broadly similar but separate the large group-based networks into multiple distinct parallel networks. For example, the network historically known as the Default Network overlaps four separate networks in the present parcellation including networks LANG, DN-B, DN-A, and SAL / PMN. Each of these four distinct networks can be identified in every individual in the present study. The multiple networks are not estimated to be “sub-networks” with shared regions or anatomical convergence, but rather are distinct networks that are near to one another and often blurred in group-averaged data (see also Fedorenko et al. 2010; 2012; Laumann et al. 2015; Michalka et al. 2015; Braga et al. 2017; 2019; Gordon et al. 2017; Buckner and DiNicola 2019; Smith et al. 2021). Thus, an advance of within-individual network estimates, including the present contribution, is to fully resolve adjacent networks that are difficult to separate through approaches that average over people.\n\nSecond, among within-individual parcellation estimates, we settled on a 15-network solution because of our goal to separate nearby networks within the anterior insula (Seeley 2019), as well as to better separate early sensory and adjacent networks. Our analyses confirmed that the newly proposed 15-network parcellation could capture correlational features absent in simpler network solutions, including our own 10-network solution previously estimated in Xue et al. (2021; see current , , , and ). In addition to detecting distinctions among networks that have close juxtapositions in the anterio"
