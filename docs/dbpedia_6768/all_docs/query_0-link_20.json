        "text": "Create a Hero/Villain RPG Season 2\n\nScreen Name: NiteMare Shape\n\nCharacter you have created: Scott Hunter\n\nAlias: Icon\n\nSpeech Color (actually say what you're using, don't go \"Like this\", or what not):\n\nas Scott\n\nAs Icon\n\nCharacter Alignment: Hero\n\nIdentity: Secret to the public\n\nCharacter Personality(Give information on how your character acts, what he/she believes in, how they handle situations): He is a man who doesn't fully understand himself. He grew up not too far from Lost Haven in Conway New Hampshire. It's a small ski resort town several just several hours south of the city. Although he grew up a normal kid with normal a normal family, he is anything but normal. He has amazing powers that he doesn't fully understand. While he was growing up he hated himself, he was angry at the world for making him a \"freak.\" He wanted nothing to do with his powers, he just wanted a normal life. However, as time went on and he grew older he learned to deal with his powers, and eventually he embraced them. He believes in fighting for what is right. He believes in protecting the weak, and making sure that they are taken care of. Overall, he is a good man with great power, trying to do the right thing.\n\nUniform/costume: See below\n\nWhen he is not in costume fighting villains or trying to stop general catastrophe he runs a nightclub called The Hub with his best friend Eric Dean.\n\nOrigin Info/Details: Scott Hunter may seem like a normal guy, but he is anything but. Everything about him is a lie, his parents, his older brother as well as his younger sister. None of it is real. Although they raised him as their son, he isn't. In fact, he isn't even really human. Scott was the result of a secret experiment by atop secret government agency that mixed alien DNA with that of a human. While he was a baby; he was cared for by a woman named Barbara Hill, who was a member of the top secret government agency. What the objective of this experiment was is unknown. While going about her daily tasks at the project, Dr. Hill learned that the program had been terminated, all evidence was to be destroyed, and the baby known only then as SKT-17 (she affectionately called him \"Scott\") was to be eliminated. Having recently lost her own child due to the actions of a drunk driver who also claimed the life of Dr. Hill's husband, she could not stand the thought that this child who she began to see as her own, could be killed. She stole the child from the laboratory which created him, and fled to the north. She gave the child to a trusted friend, Jacob Hunter and his young bride Elizabeth. Soon after, Dr. Hill was tracked down by agents of the government unit and killed. Jacob and Elizabeth took the young baby, and continued calling him Scott as they felt that there would be no need to change his name, seeing as that is what Dr. Hill had called him his whole life.\n\nScott was raised by the Hunters as one of their own children. He always knew that he was different, that he had these abilities, but he never understood why. As his powers developed throughout his childhood, he became increasingly confused and angry. This was a cause for concern for his parents, because they never understood exactly why their son was this way. When Jacob died when Scott was still just a child, Scott blamed himself for his father's death, feeling that it was the pressure of raising a \"freak\" that caused his young father to die of an aneurysm. Eventually he learned to deal with his gifts. At first he used his gifts for selfish reasons, often profiting from using them dishonestly (mostly in athletic bets). However, after an incident which cost his older brother Brandon his life, Scott left his family and found himself in a self imposed exile. He traveled around the country, spending much of his time on the West Coast. While he was away, he would often step in and anonymously lend a hand to those in need.

Juanita Juarez crouched in a corner, trying not to look at the carnage on the floor. However, she didn't have to look at it, he knew exactly what had happened in the moments after the masked men entered the bank. Two security guards and a customer were all dead, killed in the hail of gunfire that erupted when the masked men made their intentions clear. Trying to avoid detection, she just sat there; huddled in the corner, hoping that this would all end soon.\n\n\"This is Captain Price of the Lost Haven Police Department. We don't want anyone to get hurt, just come out and place your weapons on the ground.\" A voice came from outside. The four masked man became agitated, prodding the tellers to hurry with the money.\n\nThe man who seemed to be leading the robbers went over to the large glass door and opened it a crack as if he were to begin negotiating a way out. Instead, he fired several shots at the police cruisers parked in front of the bank. The police returned fire, sending shattered glass all over the inside of the bank.\n\n\"Hold your fire d*mn it!\" Captain Price ordered, recognizing the danger that the civilians inside the bank were in. He puts the megaphone he is holding to his mouth again.\n\n\"Hold your fire, there is no need for anymore bloodshed. We can resolve this peacefully, and without any more casualties.\" Then another shot rings out, forcing Price to get back behind the squad cars.\n\nRealizing that the situation is getting worse, the lead masked man began looking around the bank looking for a way out of the bank that didn't involve him being in prison or a body bag.\n\n\"Jimmy, go around and check the back, maybe we can get out that way.\"\n\nThe thug that the lead masked man was talking to nodded and went out the back, and came back moments later looking alittle panicked.\n\n\"That's covered too, three maybe four units out there. We're trapped.\"\n\nThe lead masked man looks around at the hostages and sets his sights on Juanita Juarez, who is still huddled in the corner. He quickly moves over to her and grabs her by the hair, forcing her to her feet. \"GET UP!\" he screams at her. She lets out a cry as he forces her against the wall.\n\n\"Everyone up, NOW!\" He screams at the hostages, as the other masked men corral the remaining hostages up against the same wall as Juanita.\n\n\"Alright folks, this is real simple. We're getting out of here, and you're all going to make sure that we get out safely. We're all going to walk out together, and your gonna be standing right in front of us as a human shield. If the pigs open fire, you'll be there to make sure that we don't get hit. And if you try to run, make no mistake about it, I will shoot you. Now, are we all clear on that?\"\n\nSuddenly confusion takes over as there is an explosion of glass, and what can almost be described as some sort of whirlwind inside the bank. The gunmen and hostages gather their wits and they see a man standing before them. He is dressed in a dark blue body suit with silver bands on the arms and legs, a blue and silver cape, and he has a thin mask that is the same shade of blue as his costume. The man just stands there as the gunmen open fire on him. The gunmen and hostages stand there in amazement as they watch the bullets just bounce off him.\n\n\"Oh no, this ain't hapening, this AIN'T happening!\" The lead thug shrieks as he continues to fire his weapon until it runs out of bullets. Then the man fires optic blasts at the four masked men's weapons, knocking them from their grips. The man in blue grabs the first masked man and tosses him into a wall, obviously holding back as to not serious injure the man.\n\n\"That's enough guys, it's over. Give it up and nobody has to get hurt.\" He says to the other three men. They think it over for a moment, and then stand down.\n\nMoments later the man leads the hostages and the masked men out of the bank to the police who are waiting down on the street. When he met Captain Price and the other officers they just stood there for a moment looking at him, not knowing what to make of this new player in the city.\n\n\"Thanks for the help son.\" Captain Price felt somewhat embarrassed at the hokiness of what he said, but it was all he was able to muster.\n\n\"I'm just glad I was able to help sir.\" Then in front of the police, and the media that had gathered at the bank, he just flew away.\n\nCreate a Hero RPG Application (NPC)\n\nCharacter you have created: Alexa Winstone\n\nAlias: Radiance\n\nSpeech Color (Actually say what you're using, don't go \"Like this\", or what not): Purple\n\nCharacter Alignment: Hero\n\nIdentity: Secret\n\nCharacter Personality (Give information on how your character acts, what he/she believes in, how they handle situations): Alexa is the youngest daughter of John Winstone, and an heiress to Winstone International, the large multinational conglomerate Winstone International, a company that is known the world over for its advancements in everything from weapons technologies to green energy, medical research and food production. The company has allowed her family certain advantages, and she has embraced them to the fullest. Alexa is a princess. She has been known as a party animal and a brat. However, she also does a lot of charity work and fundraising for certain causes that she feels strongly about. She also has a desire to be more than she is, and feels strongly that because of her status, she needs to do more to help those who do not have the same advantages that she enjoys.\n\nWhen in costume:\n\nNot in Costume:\n\nOrigin Info/Details: Alexa was your average party girl/heiress/paparazzi darling until one fateful weekend trip to Big Bear Mountain, California. She had expected a weekend of parties, fun, and skiing. However, while she and her boyfriend Jason were taking a winter hike through the forest near Big Bear Lake, something unexpected changed her life forever. As Alexa and John made it through a clearing to get a great view of the lake, she noticed strange lights in the sky overhead. Convinced that it was nothing more than a spectacular display of a phenomenon like the Northern Lights, John urged her on to watch the spectacle. Suddenly, the sky seemed to explode, and a bolt of lightning shot out of the sky. However, this was not like any lightning either had ever seen, for there was not a cloud in the sky and it was red in color. The strange bolt of lightning hit her directly, and only glancing John, yet throwing them both a number of feet from the site of the impact. While John was relatively unhurt, while Alexa was left in grave condition. When John came to and found Alexa unresponsive, he thought that she was dead. Because his cellular phone was fried in the blast, he was forced to leave her near the shore of the lake to find help. Fortunately, he did not have to go very far as there were a number of cabins nearby. He found one that was occupied by a kindly older couple and was able to call for help. It took the rescue team nearly an hour to get to them, but finally Alexa was airlifted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. The doctors had little hope that she would survive, let alone make a full recovery. However, they were astonished at how fast she actually did recover. After just a few weeks, she was moved from the ICU to her own room where she could continue her remarkable recovery. No one, not even the best doctors in the world were able to figure out why she survived the accident, let alone made a near full recover in record time. Nobody could have known that the mysterious storm which had nearly killed her had also saved her life.\n\nHero Type (Select one):\n\nEnergy (Electricity)\n\nPower Level (Select one below):\n\nC.

As this is an Advanced Level game, Sample must also meet the RPG forum's minimum requirement of 12 lines):\n\nEver since she was a girl, Alexa Winstone has loved Big Bear Mountain. Her childhood is riddled with memories of week long vacations to the Southern California ski resort with her family. To this day, she remembers the thrill she felt the first time she strapped a pair of skis on and took the ski lift to the top of the mountain. She remembers, just as if it were yesterday the her first wipeout. And just as if it were yesterday, she remembers her first heartbreak. She had been 13, his name was Kenny. A 25 year old ski instructor with flowing golden locks who looked like he had stepped directly off of the cover of a trashy romance novel. Deep down she had known all along that their love, or at least she had imagined that it had been their love, was doomed to fail. However, the knowledge that their \"relationship\" was doomed, or the fact that Kenny had hardly even noticed that she was alive did little to ease the pain of that heartbreak.\n\nHowever, that was years ago, and she had mostly forgotten all about Kenny. She had continued to frequent the resort over the years, both with her family, and without them. Her most recent expedition to Big Bear is a week long getaway with her boyfriend Jason, her best friend Kara and some other friends, many of whom she doesn't really know all that well, but has run into from time to time on the LA party scene. Over the last few days, Alexa has been getting tired of the drama that is a constant at the cabin, and is excited for a nice nighttime hike with Jason. Because the mountain is almost like a second home to her, Alexa knows the trails like the back of her hand, and is excited to show Jason the spectacular moonlit view of Big Bear Lake.\n\nAs Jason and Alexa traverse the trail to the lake, taking great care not to slip in the snow, they finally find themselves in a clearing, which opens up to give a picturesque view the lake, with the mountain in the background. She inches closer to Jason and embraces him in a long hug, the warmth from his broad chest gives her momentary relief from the cold, which is something that, no matter how often she visits the mountain, she is never quite able to get used to.\n\n\"This is so nice.\" Alexa says dreamily into Jason's coat.\n\n\"It really is.\" Jason responds.\n\nAs they take in the view, they notice something strange taking form in the sky. From the east, strange lights begin to dance and shimmer in the sky above them. There are beautiful green, orange, blue and red lights that almost appear to be a massive laser show of some sort. However, at the same time, it is nothing like anything that she has ever seen before.\n\n\"What is that? Maybe we should get back to the cabin.\" She says as she begins to pull away from Jason.\n\n\"Don't be silly, Kiddo. It's just the Northern Lights, I think.\" Jason says trying to comfort her.\n\nThen suddenly, before she can respond, the sky explodes in a cascade of light, and a massive red lightening bolt crashes down just before them. Before either can move, a second red bolt crashes down, this time, directly striking Alexa. The force of the blast sends both Alexa and Jason sailing through the air, landing several yards away from each other. Alexa lays where she landed, her body engulfed in pain like nothing she had never experienced in her life, and before she knows it, she slips into darkness.\n\n\"....xa. Wake up. Alexa!\" She hears the voices, but doesn't recognize them. Then, she is suddenly aware of a presence near her. She tries to open her eyes, but even that causes her pain. Finally, she does manage to open her eyes, only to find that it is now daylight, and Jason is standing over her with what seems like an army of rescue personnel. She tries to move, all she wants is to get up from the cold ground and be with Jason, however, instead she slips back into unconsciousness.\n\nCharacter you have created: Eva ‘Pendragon’ Walsh\n\nAlias: Pendragon\n\nSpeech Color whatever color (00aeef) is?\n\nCharacter Alignment: Hero in training\n\nIdentity: Secret/Known Will be known later, to start it’s a secret.\n\nCharacter Personality: Eva is a troublemaker, who likes to party. She has dropped out of Highschool and is active on the rave scene. She shirks her chores and has an estranged relationship with her parents. Now after a tremendous weight has been placed squarely on her shoulders she begins to question her life choices which marks a turning point in her life. She will soon learn that there is more to life than partying as she searches for clues regarding the identities of the Murderers who killed her friends, while she grieves over her loss.\n\nUniform/costume:\n\nOrigin Info/Details: After Breaking into the American Museum of Natural History, via a borrowed key card. Eva and her friends surprisingly had a easy time setting up for a Flash Rave something that would only last thirty or so minutes before the Police were able to mobilize. However the real reason the Museum was quiet was because Eva and her friends were not alone, masked thieves had already killed the guards and began stealing ancient artifacts. Eva who tried to protect herself reached for what appeared to be a fossilized relic. Upon blocking the attackers who had gotten what they came for fled, and the stone which entrapped the sword crumbled to the floor. Where a Ghostly figure revealed the sword to be the Legendary Excalibur.\n\nHero Type (Select one): Normal Possible Power up.\n\nPower Level (Select one below): It’s really a combination of the two. The sword is only as good as the wielder and although mystical the wielder is only human.\n\nA. Street Level (Ex. Punisher, Daredevil)\n\nB. City Level (Ex. Spider-Man, Cyclops)\n\nPowers (Be Specific): The Sword Excalibur is endowed with a variety of powers, It can cut any man-made object barring any alien or otherworldly materials. It will blind foes upon it being drawn from it’s sheathe. It is nigh unbreakable by any weapon forged by man, with the exception of other mystical weapons and those not from earth. Save for those as strong as Icon or Cosmic forces such as Umbraxis or Magic of the same tier. Enough World class magic should also break Excalibur if it sustains constant blows. Anything less than say someone of Thanos' might or Umbraxis should not break Excalibur in a single strike. Excalibur being a Legendary weapon, sometimes said to be created by the Lady in the Lake, or given to her after being forged by a Dragon. Which if Dragons did exist would be on par with Cosmic beings. They created a Legendary sword after all; presumably so. I could probably say the metal by which Excalibur is forged from could have come from the scales of a Dragon. Which being a cosmic creature would have properties all their own; say near Adamantium/Vibranium levels of durability but not quite there. Maybe a weaker version. You get the gist. The sword also grants enhanced speed (Olympic runner or Olympic Fencer level.)\n\nThe sheathe itself has powers as well, giving the wielder the ability of temporarily invulnerability, the wielder can be injured but will not bleed from wounds, nor can they be dismembered. And in case the wielder needs to recall the sword it, the sword will chose its owner, much like that of Mjolnir (should they be worthy) Even if Eva were to allow someone to borrow Excalibur they must meet that requirement. That's not to say the sword cannot be stolen from her, the thief just won't have any of the buffs or magical (cut anything) enhancements. That and it still can be recalled by it's owner (Eva) at anytime. Meaning one must knock her out, or use Magic! To prevent her from recalling it, or something along those lines.\n\nAttributes (Select one at each category):\n\nStrength Level: Normal Human\n\nSpeed/Reaction Timing Level: Normal Human\n\nEndurance at MAXIMUM Effort: Normal Human\n\nAgility: Normal Human\n\nIntelligence: Below Average\n\nFighting Skill: Untrained - In training\n\nResources: Minimal\n\nWeaknesses: She’s Human, although she is immune to dismemberment and bleeding.

Who hates Meta Humans, and thinks Humanity should be top dog. He's also a grade A jerkbag, who is Evil and insane even. Not madhouse insane but the world is out to get me insane and I need all the power I can get. My idea for him is that he has a anti Meta Human Riot Squad that has various talented individuals and a Mech unit.

As this is an Advanced Level game, Sample must also meet the RPG forum's minimum requirement of 12 lines):\n\n11:48 PM Museum of Natural History. “Come on, it’s just ahead.” Eva, Leon and Shari followed just behind Julius as they carried a number of amplifiers and boxes along with them. Julius’s plan was simple sneak in during the Guard shift set up quickly ahead of the partygoers who were on their way for a flash Rave, an idea Julius had. Get in a back door using a lifted keycard from one of his buddies party for thirty minutes or so then bug out. All the police would find was a trashed storeroom filled with uncatalogued artifacts and more plastic cups then they’ve ever seen before. He had it all planned out for a strung out druggie, and to Shari’s surprise it was far too easy.\n\n“Were in, were in. We don’t have much time. Leon find an outlet, Shari keep an eye out on the door. Eva help me bring the rest of the boxes in. We need more cups, chips and booze.”\n\nLeon rushed around checking the walls, while Shari nervously waited by the door. “Julius you sure this will work out? I mean this is a museum, a big one! You’d think there’d be more guards or cameras.”\n\n“Relax Shari.” Eva spoke calmly. “We’re here in between shifts, there’s no one watching the cameras.”\n\n“I.. I just don’t know Eva, there’s just something wrong about this. I can’t explain it.”\n\n“Found the outlets!! Julius give me a hand with the equipment.”\n\n“Eva bring in the rest of the stuff the party starts in five!”\n\nAs I nodded and ran back to the car, I stopped just for a moment as a sound caught my attention. Like footprints though not nearly as pronounced. No, nothing I thought as I opened the car trunk and reached inside grabbing a banana box filled with food. I tossed a few smaller ones on top before closing the trunk and heading back inside.\n\nWhen I walked up to the door I spoke out.”Hey Shari give me a hand here will ya?” A second passed while I entered the room and looked about.”Shari, Leon, Julius!!? Come on guys it’s no time to be playing around.. We.. Oh. My. God!” The boxes I held dropped to the floor as bloodstains splattered the walls. The panic and fear gripped my voice as I called out again.”SHARI! LEON! JULIUS! Wher..”\n\nFrom behind me the door closed and a arm thick as a tree grabbed me by my hoodie and tossed me into a rack.\n\n“Another unaccounted guest, this one will not hinder our work.” The hulking figure spoke as others came in from the shadows.\n\n“Finish it quick, we need you to help the rest of us look.”\n\nHe turned his gaze back to me.”She won’t take long at all.”\n\nI scrambled back into the metallic rack, covered in blood. My own, my friends? I.. I looked to see him stretched out to me hand poised to snap my neck. My hands reached back fumbling over vases and stone tools, until I grabbed what I thought was a stick or was it a club, it felt hard as if made of stone. I swung it at him hitting his shin.\n\nHe acted as if it hadn’t fazed him in the slightest. But I could feel it, his anger penetrated my soul, like his eyes burned right through me. He slammed down with his fist pounding the club into me and cracking the floor. I felt the wind leave my chest completely and my own eyes were so heavy, they were being pulled down against my will. I saw him in that moment smiling as he walked away, and a light flashed before me.\n\nNext thing I knew I awoke and just in front of me a specter wearing old clothes and a crown was shaking my body.\n\n“Awaken! Awaken already!! Quickly now you must flee!!”\n\nI groggily looked about to see the room engulfed in flames. My bones felt as if they were glass, I was overcomed with fear, desperation. I wanted to scream at the sight of the Ghost, of the fire.\n\n“Young Miss! Young Miss! Eva!! Get a hold of yourself, you’ll burn. Take the sword, it will protect you. Do not let it leave your grasp!!”\n\n“How do you know..”\n\n“Eva! Now is not the time. Take the sword. And hurry!!”\n\nThe Ghost confused me more than the fire, my assailants. This night just couldn’t be real none of it could. The Ghost spoke of a sword and as I looked about I saw no such thing. But clinched in my hand was no other than the sword he spoke of. I didn’t remember holding a sword. But it was there sure as day. I stood to my feet limping away, I could feel the heat liking my back. The pain felt unbearable, I shouldn’t be walking I must be dead, I have to be dead. The cracking of the flames tore the walls down to my left, my right and all around me.\n\n“You must hurry Eva! Before the flames consume you!”\n\nThe door seemed so close now, the handle was just in reach. But I couldn’t lift my arm. It was then the door flew open as the Ghost blasted it aside. I fell to the ground as I lost all the feeling in my legs.\n\n“Just a little farther Eva. Crawl if you must.”\n\nStrange, I should be afraid of this Ghost. But his words were so familiar so comforting. The concrete tore my skin up I could see the flesh under my skin. But no blood, not a drop. As I managed to crawl to saftey. I looked up at the Specter. “Who, are you?”\n\n“I shall answer my King. I am Arthur Pendragon. Former King of Camelot. And you who have broken the curse sealing my sword, your sword. Excalibur. Is the rightful King of England.”\n\n“Kin...g” I said with my last breaths before everything went blank. The sounds and sights gone as I passed out.\n\nCharacter you have created: Racheli Lorna Desdemona\n\nAlias:\n\nIn costume- Nemesis, name suggested by Gabriel\n\nOut of costume- Rach, nick by her friends\n\nSpeech Color: indianred\n\nCharacter Alignment: Walking the Line\n\nIdentity: Nemesis\n\nRach has been forced to give up her identity due to Gene Co issuing a statewide arrest warrant, allegedly because of property damage and corporation sabotage. Since Gene Co has a pretty clean reputation as far as corporations goes, there’s little evidence to suggest foul dealings or their true intentions without investigating it. So any players (who weren’t involved in Natural Selection Arc) wanting to be made aware of Gene Co’s alternative motivations need to first contact me and we’ll work out the details.\n\nCharacter Personality (Give information on how your character acts, what he/she believes in, how they handle situations):\n\nRacheli is an independent and strong individual, mainly in personality. To those who have managed to get by her defenses and befriend her, she's a deeply loyal and a protective friend who will risk life and limb for their safety. Though helping them achieve their goals is another matter altogether because if she doesn't like something, she won't hesitate to let you know in a blunt and often thickly sarcastic way. Rarely does she ever pull punches to spare someone's feelings when it comes to something completely stupid. Most believe she is a short tempered woman, who hates receiving charity. Often she'll reply to those individuals with sour looks and scoffing off the attempts as they are given. Granted when it comes to solid logic she can't argue with, Racheli is known to yield some times but it doesn't mean she's happy about. So expect her sore loser to show.\n\nTo strangers and acquaintances, she sometimes comes off as a cold and closed off individual, making becoming friends with others difficult at first. While she will act like a human being and interacts when talked to, you shouldn’t expect to gain any personal information about her situation or thoughts for a while. Trust is difficult to earn though just words.\n\nJust like with many of her habits, she acts first and thinks about the consequences later. This traits worsens when her temper is flared. She never thinks about what comes out of her mouth save that it might end up hurting the one they are targeted at. Once it is all said and done, she sometimes realizes too late she had crossed a line. However, it takes a lot for her to verbally apology because it means her own feelings didn’t really matter in her mind and her views weren’t worth fighting for. Despite her flaws, she does have some positive aspects to her personality besides her protective nature to her friends. Though she tries to hide it, Racheli does have strong sense of what society expects is right and wrong. She can’t stand around and fully ignore someone else’s issues unless her own needs overwhelm that instinct. The more she knows about an individual, the easier it is to get personally involved and that can cause problems for her.\n\nMotivation/Fear\n\nShe is driven to never to become like her father, fearing that once she finally takes a life then the desire would become addictive and impossible to stop. Like a drug addict hooked on the strongest drugs. She lacks trust she will never fall that far and is continually on alert, holding back her aggression until it can be released in a better way. Sometimes, if it's bottled up too long, she becomes irritable. It doesn't help she's plagued by nightmares and every time she manages to draw blood, her heart races and cries for more. The high it causes is rather difficult to ignore though she stubbornly refuses to yield to it...\n\nUniform/costume:\n\nIntroducing it this Season and will likely be in it most of the season. Most of it was designed in the Forge with help from Gabriel based on her insistence on simplicity, and none of that ‘high’ tech bullshit.\n\nThe unseen part is black, semi loose fitting pants and combat boots with a steel toe end and bottom to give her kicks some punch. Rach's costume is based and chosen more for function rather than being flashy, attention seeking or intimidating to those who notice her. In fact she rather they forget she encountered them at all as too much news could result in trouble with the wrong people. Primary colors are black and silver gray, the latter from her ability to influence metals and change their properties.

Shortly afterwards they moved to Mannis, New York, a suburban area ideal to raise children and provided more opportunities for both of them. Things seemed to have been going well up until Racheli turned two. On her birthday, a mysterious man had came knocking at their door. He was engaging into a heated argument which escalated and resulted in Ms. Desdemona's murder then Rach's abduction. Despite months spent in searching for her, no one could find hair or trace of the daughter.\n\nIn a few months all attempts were ceased, turning the murder and kidnapping case into a cold file.\n\nThe abductor was her own father, Michael Garth, who raised her over the years, her mind completely and blissfully unaware of his blood stained hands. It was an uneventful period with her father continually traveling from state to state across the USA to avoid the heat created from her mother’s death. In many ways, to the outside, he was seen as the perfect single father doing his best to raise his little girl. However, all those memories would become bitter ashes when she learned the truth deep within the Oregon wilderness.\n\nIt was a yearly cabin trip, one they took every season. The building completely isolated save for a single road running straight through the woods about half a day’s trek on foot from their location. One night when she was eight, Rach discovered a woman locked within the basement causing Michael to reveal he had been murdering them here for years. The place designed for the grim task and creating a deep, dark fear of him. Unable to escape, she was quickly forced to joined into the task with a casual warning that she was as guilty as him. It didn’t help it at that point she learned something twisted about herself: She got enjoyment out of inflicting pain and suffering. IT rattled her heavily to realize this while he ushered her into bed, after cleaning her up, then tucked her in with a soft peck on her head.\n\nDriven by her own selfish desires, she and the woman escaped that same night. They were at the back door when Michael had come down the stairs, looking for Rach after finding she was missing from her bed. He grimly stared at them causing them both to bolt into the nearest room, Rach quickly bolting the door and pushing the woman out of the window. His fingers nearly grasped Rach’s heel when she hopped down into the dirt then took off after the hobbling woman into pure darkness.\n\nThe woman died due to infection and blood loss hours later, her body buried somewhere in the wilderness alongside several other corpses. During the night, Rach managed to find a ditch to hide in and avoid her father. It was dawn the next morning when she got a trucker’s attention, nearly getting herself ran over in the process, and finally got him to call police thanks to her shirt being covered in dirt, blood and she didn’t want to know what else.\n\nThings turned into a mess afterwards. The body was discovered, the torture room found, and evidence collected through his personal trophies causing a case to be iron clad against him. He was arrested, after fleeing the scene, days later bring some relief to Rach. He was then put for the death penalty weeks later. Meanwhile Racheli was placed into a temporary foster home until a relative, her grandmother, could retrieve her. Once again she was moved over state lines into Maine where she would stay for yet more years. The adjustment wasn’t easy.\n\nIn her teenage years, Racheli grew up in the suburban area in a small town just on the outer limits. Due to the media over her father, she had gotten a rough reputation and most parents had their child avoid contact with her out of fear. It didn’t help she came off distance, aggressive and worst thanks to her personal problems. At thirteen she and a couple of kids broke into the local gym, but she was the only one caught.\n\nThe police asked if the gym owner wanted to press charges, her mouth shut while she refused to rat out those with her, which he didn’t. Instead he shook his head and she received an ultimatum. Either work in the gym to pay off the damages or go to jail. It was a losing battle so she chose the option to work off the damages and still not be forced to rat anyone out. Being around the gym while the boxers trained sparked her interest in the sport, her answer yes when the guy offered to train her. Like before, there was strict conditions but in her eyes it was too good to pass up. Racheli trained to become a contender for the city tournament in the following years, turning eighteen and reaching for the top thanks to her competitive drive. Like most things in her life, bad luck got in the way.\n\nHer grandmother became ill. This forced Racheli to give up on her dream and move on, focusing on keeping them alive and housed. She got two full jobs, her better people skills helping her to keep them, while barely visiting the gym well into her adulthood. Life was hard and over time, she stopped going back to the gym completely. Even boxing on her own was too much strain to continue.\n\nOver a three days ago, her grandmother mysteriously passed away in her sleep. Arranging the cremation and funeral, the last task left, Rach ended the apartment leash and was flying to Lost Haven in order to dump her grandmother Ruth's ashes into the sea. It felt like it was best to make a new start and that was something Racheli intended to do. She's arrived in Lost Haven, Maine, just over an hour ago with her grandmother ashes. During the flight, it seemed she had caught something because she's been feeling weak and coughing sparingly.\n\nLittle did she realize was it was actually a virus which had murdered numerous individuals and was rewriting her own DNA, gradually destroying her from the inside out. She met Justine within Lost Haven and thanks to Garth, had an agreement to bunk with her until other arrangements were made. Those living conditions didn’t last too long when the riots happened in Sherman Square. Gangs came out of the woodwork, stressing police resources and creating a literal hell on earth resulted in a chemically enhanced thug breaking into their apartment. Helpless and unable to defend herself, Rach doesn’t recall much during this period but according to Gabe and Justine she was in full grip of the virus. The apartment exploded leaving Rach and Justine homeless.\n\nRach spent most of the rest of the week within the CDC, her skin being poked, examined, and more for the scientists to learn of what was happening to her. However one man already knew the full details but didn’t share. That man was named Dr. Gabriel Cole. Otherwise known as Icarus, the very superhero (alongside Justine) who engaged the thug before his death.\n\nWhen Lost Haven was threatened as a possible terrorist target, the CDC decided to move Racheli to a safer location. This open it up for her to be acquired by Gene Co whose CEO requested aid from the very crime lord himself, the Cowl. Sending in a spy to collect intelligence, the man managed to both collect information and aid in Rach’s capture. During the attempt, several new faces rushed to Rach’s aid including the heroes Joseph, White Witch, and Hydro as well as an old face, Icarus. However they were unable to stop Rach from being delivered into the Cowl’s hands. Silence, as he was called, departed early and has yet to remerge into the scene. Odette stuck around and prevented Rach’s first attempt at escape as Rach was locked into an anti-meta box then set aside to wait until Gene Co arrived.\n\nFeeling abandoned and forgotten, Rach learned about the virus’ history and loathed the creature even more. Unknown to herself, the heroes were making headway into getting her back while White Witch dealt with her role in the Pax threat. They located Rach then stormed the Ironworks, resulting in once casuality on the heroes side: Joseph. The win was a bitter one as while the heroes managed, with heavy struggle, free Rach they were forced back by Gene Co reinforcements.\n\nWith a rattling prediction over her head, Rach spend months in the Forge both training to become stronger and controlling her abilities. Until recently she didn’t realize Gene Co had placed a warrant over her for damages to property forcing her to always be in hiding behind her new alias, Nemesis.\n\nDr. Marcus Twaine, a bacterial and rock specialist, discovered the organism on asteroid rock samples taken by NASA's space probe Hermes after returning home. Microscopic and viral like, the government delivered the creature to a disclosed location. Though the place wasn't officially named, many folks knew it as Building 51. It was here where it was studied, experimented with and attempted to be better understood but known to the scientists, they had altered the Alien's original DNA in their ignorance. It became more of a living, intelligent virus which could now exist in humans. It was discovered when a scientist was exposed and infected, displaying unusual symptoms within minutes. Quarantining the host, they were able to extract the Alien for further study.\n\nHoping to weaponize it, several humans, from criminals to volunteers, were exposed to the Alien. Most the civilians were dead within minutes as they died in stage three. Surprisingly it was the criminals who lasted the longest during the trials, ranging in hours before their bodies finally wore down and died. It was one of these death sentenced killers who allowed the Alien to escape when it synced with the man's brain pattern causing a chain reaction and slaughtered the staff, leaving corpses ripped apart in its wake. Using a car, it drove out of the smoldering building's ruins. For months, it passed through several hosts and infected often by direct touch, staying in dormant state until it was activated. All it took was a stressful event to trigger it which was easy as it was impossible to avoid it. Its last victim was an elderly woman named Ruth Desdemona, Racheli's own grandmother who died within stage one. Currently it’s within the woman's granddaughter and bonded with her.\n\nHero Type (Select one): Other-Host to an Alien Symbiote (Phylactery)\n\nPower Level (Select one below):\n\nMentality: Street level (Her selfishness and fears force her to remain on the smaller scale of things)\n\nPhysical: Between Street and City Level (She has the potential to grow to the Cosmic level, but events, connections, and even character development in the IC can influence when/how/in what manner her mind will be in when that happens)\n\nEmotionally: Street Level (Anymore, she’ll have a mental break down and kick someone’s ass...or the wall)\n\nPowers (Be Specific):\n\n~Note~\n\nAs the Alien grows and developments, Rach will evolve and become stronger. Her virus changing her genetics resulting in new abilities showing up or some growing into others as she grows in the IC, all pre-approved by the GMs before introduced into the IC.\n\nRacheli\n\nPhysical\n\n~Metal manipulation: Racheli has the ability to control and sense all types of metal she has come into contact with, currently limited to the most common ones on the Earth’s Periodic Table. When she fully acquires a the essence of a metal, earth based or otherwise, she can manipulate its structure between solid to liquid, alter its base atom components into another type (example: copper into steel), increase or decrease the metal’s original strength and gain usable data through touch alone that could take computer’s decades. The only thing Rach can’t alter with a metal is the total volume. Without additional metal from another source to alter and add to, the existing metal volume is unable change despite what she does to manipulate it.\n\nFor alien, magical, or more complicated metals beyond Earth, Racheli must touch for several seconds uninterrupted and absorb the data before she can manipulate it easily. Any attempts to do so before she’s done this step will result in a feeble, sometimes barely noted effect. It also leaves her vulnerable to attack during this time since she is unable to use her magnetism during this time and have to rely on her physical power and durability.\n\nIf Rach should affect a magical item made of metal, the magical properties will remain the same and only the shape might alter. Some items, depending on the magical properties might not even be affected all. (Narrative based)\n\nRange- Any metal within eyesight, as long as she can see than it can be altered.\n\nOther Notes- N/A\n\n~Minor Transmutation Abilities: Rach has learned, on a very minor scale, how to break down and alter elements beyond metal. However, she has to smear her blood upon the surface then focus on breaking it down. This takes time and her full focus making it a poor combat ability, especially when it doesn’t always work. Her most common use of this ability is to change her fingers into metal carbon then morphing them into thin, razor sharp blades.\n\nRange- Close and within Touch range\n\nOther- The time it takes varies on how complicated the material is. If it’s a base element, like say a wooden tree, then the material will only take an hour or so to break down then be reformed. However if the same wooden tree was carved then turned into a wooden chair with metal and other decorative fixings, the breakdown could take several hours to complete. Some materials might not even break down fully at all since she is still developing this ability.\n\n~Magnetism: This ability focuses on magnetism and magnetic fields, allowing Rach to create, manipulate, and focus magnetism of various forms. Examples include magnetosphere, magnetic materials, planetary, etc. This allows her to attract or repulse metal objects to either become directed at herself or a fixed location within her range. She is also able to create and sense magnetic field. She can gain information such as their flow and disrupting their natural path into something different by changing their ion charge. Centering this on items or her palms, she can create an electrical current which gives her attacks a little shock to them. However these shocks never build up to the point of becoming fatal as the battles often lasts minutes at most, rather than days. Rach is unable to influence the bioelectrical within a pure organic creature without risking internal damage to herself, strictly since the energy used could also affect her own system as well.\n\nRange- 6 meters from her being the epicenter\n\nOther-\n\n~Nanites: Racheli’s body has gained the ability to regenerate when injured, either during combat or other situations that inflict harm. This is thanks to the nanites saturating her vein system and replacing her blood with a black, thick fluid like swarm. This gives her blood a gritty, tar like texture when exposed to the air. Outside the body they seem to ‘die’ or shut down, unable to continue to function outside their own self contained environment within her body. Within, they are fully able to carry out basic functions of the body indefinitely by feeding it energy, nutrients, mending it when injured and various other needs for a health individual.\n\nWhen destroyed by outside sources like specific positions targeting organic machines or spilling her blood, the nanites dig deep. They manufacture more of themselves using Racheli’s own natural biology, which has the ability to alter into organic metals for the construction and spawn an unlimited amount since her body never stops producing these materials. However production speed and repairing of the damages can be slowed drastically. They aren’t instant and when nanites focuses are divided over several severe wounds, than they will gradually drop their healing level just to sustain her life.\n\nHere’s a chart estimate of her healing levels and how long it would take to mend over each type of severity, through this isn’t all of them and those wounds will be mainly based on narrative and what fits the situation best.\n\nMinor\n\nThese wounds usually take anywhere between a few moments to hours at most.\n\n~broken, clean or otherwise, bones\n\n~bruised organs\n\n~skin wounds\n\n~strained tendons, muscles, etc\n\nMajor\n\nThese wounds can take anywhere between a day to a month, or longer, to mend.\n\n~ fractured bones as well as bent\n\n~ruptured, and/or bursted organs\n\n~torn, ripped, and shredded skin/muscles\n\n~snapped tendons, etc\n\n~damaged nerves\n\n~regrowing a limb\n\nRange- Within\n\nOther-\n\nMental\n\n~Accelerated Perception and Procession: Being hardwired and upgraded into a biological computer, Racheli’s brain now processes and collects information at a hyper accelerated rate. Activated at all time, her mind slows down the scene mentally and can even pause it when needed (the outside events still are moving at their normal speed, her mind is just moving faster to absorb, register and anaylze). Her memory is increased and is photographic, enabling her to recall things much clearer and quickly compared to before she bonded with the virus. This also means she will never forget anything since her mind can store vast amounts of exact data. Through understanding what is told to her is another matter completely. Her reflexes also aren’t necessarily speed up as this ability only affects her chances of reacting before the danger can reach her which if her speed is naturally slower, the too great to get clear or other additional factors than she will get hit. At best she can likely limit the damage done, especially when caught off guard.\n\nRange- Undefined\n\nOther- N/A\n\n~Enhanced Hearing: Racheli’s hearing has become extremely sensitive that she can easily determine the acoustic pressure changes within a single decibel in the ideal conditions. Thanks to this change she can easily pick infrasound, ultrasound, sonar and even radio signals traveling within her area with little effort when she focuses on filtering the background noise. Not even sound proof walls can prevent her keen ears from picking up noises through them which can allow her to tell an individual’s position and eavesdrop on their conversation with ease. On an individual, she can gain a surprising depth when it comes to listening to their heartbeat, blood circulation, breathing, and physical movements such as lying, injury, etc. Each individual’s heartbeat has a distinct volume, rate, and pattern to it that she can use to id a target even when in disguise.\n\nRange- Within a mile when in ideal conditions, and a fourth in worst.\n\nOther- Multiple sounds or background noise that’s within a meter of her can interfere with her ability, making it hard for Rach to focus on her target and separate the sounds collecting in her hearing. In addition, extreme sounds ranging in either higher or lower frequencies than a human’s ability to hear will hurt and possibly stun Rach when she’s not been forewarned to filter it out. Through she can tell when an individual without complete control over their body is lying, people with pacemakers and complete control are another matter. They are able to fool her hearing since they can maintain an unbroken rhythm with their heart beat as well as breath.\n\n~Enhanced Sight: Racheli’s vision has increased to about 20/5, about four times of a normal human and able to pick out a mouse from about two miles away. On zooming into the image, she can pick out incredible detail and clarity as if she was standing right on top of it. When she alters her vision spectrum she can identify infrared, ultraviolet, x-ray, microwaves, radio waves, and more when she’s seen them at least once.\n\nRange- 2 miles in ideal conditions, one fourth in worst.\n\nOther- Magical/abilities that allow invisibility can easily overcome this perception, preventing her from being able to see the target or details relating to it. With enhancement comes sensitivity as well, Racheli’s eyes are more susceptible to bright flashes, extreme colors, and other visual ‘explosions’ that her eyes can briefly shut down to reboot. This blindness can last up to minutes or days depending on the optical damage and how fast it is mended.\n\n~Enhanced Taste: This ability allows Rach to have gained accurate sense of taste and gain greater detail about a food, drink or material she’s sampling. She can tell the ingredients from a 20 mg sample, separating each independent element from the whole mixture. This can easily alert her to poisons and unnatural content that are rather harmful to her system, possibly sparing her consuming or enabling to determine what is edible and even nutrient.\n\nRange- Close Range\n\nOther- Magic and tasteless substances will elude this ability, preventing her from placing it and cause her to struggle.\n\n~Enhanced Smell: Racheli’s sense of scent is heightened beyond human and rivaling those animals with the keening olfactory abilities known on earth. This allows her to distinguish individual musks and other odors aiding in locating specific persons, objects, substances and even places with nothing but her nose. She can tell where an individual has been based on what scents have been collected on their person and even retract their steps, enabling her to tell how long ago they were there and even how long they lingered there. With most individuals, based on their pheromone changes and chemical clues, she can tell if a target is lying, sick, diseased or poisoned thanks to hormones/smells that are excreted within a set area. If she’s smelled a scent before than she can easily recollect that same smell when it crosses her path and where at exactly.\n\nRange- In ideal conditions, her range is about 1.75 miles before the scent fades. About a fourth of that in the worse one.\n\nOther- Range determines the amount of information Rach can gleam from an individual. At her limit range and in ideal conditions, she can only locate and track the target's’ movements enough to keep up. However in closer range and without any preventing magics/abilities, she can gain a more insightful data. This includes the individual’s condition, specific odor markers, what they’ve touched, what they’ve eaten, their race, where they’ve been recently, etc. Strong odors and several at once can cause extreme pain, ruining her focus and even kill her ability to gain information.\n\n~Enhanced Touch: Her sense of touch is sensitive enough to note indentations of ink on paper, radiation off items, seismic activities and even micro voltage. She can even feel the faintest crack that’s invisible to the naked eye. Her body can sense minute changes in temperature and pressure, enabling her to predict changes in weather or atmosphere surprisingly accurately. She can even tell the intensity the closer the storm comes into her general area. She can sense a human’s body’s change in heat and their air disturbance from at least five feet away, including if an individual is alive, for how long if they’ve died, emotions (such as blushing or other emotions that increases heat), and residual heat off objects or machines.\n\nRange- In best of the conditions, up to a mile diameter. In worse, about a fourth of that.\n\nOther-Rach can senses these vibrations through solid substances, liquid, and even air pressure changes. However, the closer to her limited range the less details she can obtain like many of her other enhanced perception abilities.\n\nCombative Skills\n\n~Boxing: At a young age, Racheli learned the basics about the art of boxing. To say she mastered it is impossible as that would imply she can't improve, a fact which isn't true, so her levels haven't peaked fully. Before she was forced to give it all up, her experience level lie within what her gym classed as a Prospect and a Journeymen in the sport. She had the talent, footwork and drive, but her experience lacked heavily and that was a factor which hurt her more then the rest. Even a poor athlete could be a decent boxer if they had the experience of a champ. Her skill level now resides in Tomato Cans level though it wouldn't take her long to raise to the level of Prospect or beyond with a reason and hard training, her body fully able to recall the rhythms, strikes, and more instinctively.\n\nRange- CQC\n\nOther- She's extremely rusty so it will take time for her to get back into shape.\n\nAlien\n\nTelepathy: The virus that inhabits Rachelis’ body is able to share and communicate with her and others using Telepathy. It can project an image of its current chosen form, her father, into the outside world as long as she is conscious and aware. Beyond that, the organism hasn't shown any ability to affect the outside other than choose who will share its image and conversation with. So if it wanted to make her seem crazy, it is well within the being's ability to do so. Should any Telepathic being, magic, meta or others, attempt to read or influence Racheli’s mind (not senses) then they will be met by resistance due to the Alien’s paranoid nature. It would be like hitting a solid wall.\n\nRange- Namely the farther away from Racheli, the weaker the power is.\n\nOther- This ability might adapt in the future or the virus’ image will likely evolve into something outside her father's image. Only time will tell.\n\nAttributes (Select one at each category):\n\nStrength Level: Normal Human-10 tons\n\nSpeed/Reaction Timing Level: Normal Human- 20 MPH.\n\nEndurance at MAXIMUM Effort: 3 hours.\n\nAgility: Normal Human- 5x human rate.\n\nIntelligence: Average\n\nFighting Skill: Untrained (Rusty if you count boxing)\n\nResources: Minimal\n\nNothing since the Riots.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nStill Flawed\n\nDespite her abilities and physical changes, she's just as killable as normal human when you get past her meta human abilities. Gene Co has created a serum that can temporarily disable her meta abilities, possibly others (varies), by targeting the source at a genetic level and shutting the genes off. Other ways to temporarily disable is through high power neuro-toxins when you manage to enter it into the bloodstream, attacking her mind (hacking it in a sense), electrical energies of high voltage, dividing her attention then catching her unaware (depends on narrative) or other abilities that null her meta powers.\n\nAshes to Ashes\n\nThe Alien’s DNA and structure has a weakness to light and heat when outside its host. It breaks down and evaporates when exposed to any non specialized light or heat of any type. When it bonded with Rach, the weakness to multiple sources of light was eliminated. The only ones that remain are sources like UV which can get past the skin barrier and into the body. These are found within items like black lights so she likely won’t be visiting any nightclubs without protection. Heat is the primary and most effective weakness, namely above 120 degrees or higher can make her almost completely human save for the black blood and colder body temperature. Direct heat is even worse since it can hurt her and prevent her regeneration from taking full effect, bring her down to her knees with little effect.\n\nOther Characters:\n\nWill add as the RP goes on, though here's a few.\n\nSupport\n\n~Garret Shepherd: A friend from the other side of Maine and he was the one that set up Racheli's living arrangements, suggested this crazy idea as he contacted his cousin. Though Racheli was bitter about the help , she saw no other option and she was forced into the arrangement. Even agreed to keep an eye on her future roommate for him.\n\nAllies/Associates\n\n~Gabriel Cole (Icarus): A superhero that wears a machine suit with some serious heat, which sadly wrecked their apartment leaving Justine and herself homeless for a time. Despite the aftermath, he was critical in getting Racheli to the CDC and finally saving her life by aiding in her mind to sync up with the virus. Even after the chore, she has grown to trust him slowly and while she will fight alongside him, Rach is still wary of fully trusting him.\n\n~Justine Shepherd (Myth): Garret’s cousin and her current roomie before the apartment incident, thankfully she got out safely. Rach feels a deep attachment and loyalty to the woman, despite the fact they only met a few months ago. Out of everyone, it’s her and Gabe that Rach will trust the most through this bond is still fragile enough to be broken by misunderstandings.\n\n~Jaden Maxwell (Evergreen): One of the heroes that aided with her rescue, through she only met him briefly. Personally he seems to be a cross dressing, plant manipulator with a distinct like for dresses and exotic designs. He looked like an overgrown pokemon to her.\n\n~Jacob Parkman (Hydro): Another hero that aided with her rescue, through last time she saw he was pretty weak and nearly a puddle of water from her rescue mission. It seems he knew and worked with Gabe over his own condition but had little results in finding a cure. This is as much as she knows about since she was still recovering.\n\nRogue Gallery\n\n~Odette (The Ambassador): An annoy individual, possibly a fey, who Rach personally has a grudge against since the woman both helped capture and nearly tore out her damn tongue. If they were ever to cross paths it is unlikely Rach would both with control when it came to going full out and beating the woman in combat.\n\n~Lekh Antol (Silence): Another responsible for her catch from the van, her mind hazy over his abilities and face when she tries to recall him. It’s like his face is static over from inference of an outside force. She does recall her abilities weren’t working correctly when she tried to fight back but she’s not fully sure if it was because she was weakened or if he had some meta power that influence it in some way, something she doesn’t know if she wants to fully know should they ever meet again.\n\n~? (The Cowl): It seemed the very one who arranged her capture and the biggest asshole she would love to wrangle the neck of. Despite him being human, his cleverness and preparation was enough to stop her from fighting back while they waited for someone to collect her. She discovered his alias was the Cowl and she intends to discover whatever she can over him the next time she’s in Lost Haven, slowly tearing apart his self made profits and organization in the process.\n\n~Gene Co: Rach knows that this nation wide corporation was behind her abduction, namely since they likely wanted to reclaim their virus but she can’t draw any connections or proof to their dirty dealings. OR the very individual fixed on her recapture. So far they have made her life hellish with that warrant for her arrest forcing her to parade around in a mask and costume like the other supers.\n\nOther\n\n~Puck: A demon that made a ‘prediction’ she questions to this day.\n\n~War Pulse: At the moment, he's a cocky SoB that was hired to recapture her. She's still sore about the conflict just outside of Chinatown and hopes never to see his face again.\n\nDo you know how to post pictures on RPG boards?:\n\nYes, do I get a treat now?!? :P\n\nNPCS\n\nJacqueline Freeman"
