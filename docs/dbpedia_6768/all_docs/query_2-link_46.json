        "text": "The best news of this century!\n\nIf you obsessively watched the Disney Channel in the early to mid-2000s, you know that Phil Of the Future is a true televisual gem from a bygone era.\n\nNow, before I even knew what shipping WAS, I definitely shipped Phil and Keely and their *tragic* romance. (Tragic because Phil was from the future and Keely WASN'T! How would that even work?!)\n\nTo this day, I wonder where Phil and Keely would be now â€” and even though we've never had an official reboot, we just got the next best thing. Raviv Ullman (Phil) reunited with Aly Michalka (Keely) and AJ Michalka (obviously her sister and other half of Aly & AJ) at an NYC event:\n\nNaturally, Disney fans were super grateful for the nostalgia:\n\nNow, let's get to work on an official spin-off show before the 22nd century, shall we?\n\nShare This Article"
