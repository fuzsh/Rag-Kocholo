        "text": "Ephedrine- and guaifenesin-induced nephrolithiasis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBennett, Stephen; Hoffman, Nathan; Monga, Manoj\n\n2004-12-01\n\nEphedrine and guaifenesin are herbal supplements that have experienced increased use over the past decade. Ephedrine has been used as a stimulant and weight-loss product, guaifenesin as an expectorant and cough suppressant; both are found in combination in many antitussives and expectorants. This paper reviews the reported cases of ephedrine- and guaifenesin-induced nephrolithiasis, as well as the diagnostic techniques and treatments that have been successfully used for these stones. A systematic review of the literature pertaining to nephrolithiasis and the compounds ephedrine and guaifenesin was conducted. Ephedrine and guaifenesin use results in over 35% of urinary stones that are related to pharmaceutical metabolites, and collectively are present in 0.1% of all urinary stones. These calculi are radiolucent, requiring the use of computerized tomography (CT scan) for diagnosis. Alkalinization therapy offers an alternative to surgical intervention and may have a role in prevention of recurrence. Ephedrine and guaifenesin have been shown to cause nephrolithiasis in cases of abuse when taken individually or in combination. It is important for the clinician to be aware of the potential for these compounds to cause nephrolithiasis.\n\nDirect and indirect effects of ephedrine on heart rate and blood pressure in vehicle-treated and sympathectomised male rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlsufyani, Hadeel A; Docherty, James R\n\n2018-04-15\n\nWe have investigated the cardiac and pressor responses to (Â±)-ephedrine and (-)-ephedrine in pentobarbitone anaesthetized male wistar rats. The tachycardiac responses to (Â±)- and (-)-ephedrine were similar, but pressor responses to (-)-ephedrine (10â¯mg/kg) were significantly greater than those to (Â±)-ephedrine, and for both, the pressor response was followed by a small depressor response. Sympathectomy did not affect pressor responses, but significantly increased the later depressor response to both compounds. Sympathectomy did not affect tachycardiac or depressor responses to the Î²-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline, but significantly reduced the tachycardia to (Â±)-ephedrine. (Â±)-Ephedrine contracted vas deferens from vehicle treatment animals, but in vas deferens from sympathectomised rats, (Â±)-ephedrine produced almost no tonic contraction (Î± 1A -adrenoceptor mediated), but the phasic contraction was unaffected (Î± 1D -adrenoceptor mediated). It is concluded, firstly, that (-)-ephedrine is more potent than the racemate mixture at producing pressor responses. Secondly, since the depressor response to isoprenaline was unaffected, sympathectomy presumably reduced a pressor component to the response to (Â±)- and (-)-ephedrine. Hence, a component of the pressor response to both (Â±)- and (-)-ephedrine is indirect and may involve actions at Î± 1A -adrenoceptors, at which ephedrine does not have marked direct actions.

R.; Gottesdiener, K.; Jordan, J.; Chen, K.; Flattery, S.; Larson, P. J.; Candelore, M. R.; Gertz, B.; Robertson, D.; Sun, M.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nEphedrine is used to help achieve weight control. Data on its true efficacy and mechanisms in altering energy balance in human subjects are limited. We aimed to determine the acute effect of ephedrine on 24-h energy expenditure, mechanical work and urinary catecholamines in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study. Ten healthy volunteers were given ephedrine (50 mg) or placebo thrice daily during each of two 24-h periods (ephedrine and placebo) in a whole-room indirect calorimeter, which accurately measures minute-by-minute energy expenditure and mechanical work. Measurements were taken of 24-h energy expenditure, mechanical work, urinary catecholamines and binding of (+/-)ephedrine in vitro to human beta1-, beta2- and beta3-adrenoreceptors. Twenty-four-hour energy expenditure was 3.6% greater (8965+/-1301 versus 8648+/-1347 kJ, P<0.05) with ephedrine than with placebo, but mechanical work was not different between the ephedrine and placebo periods. Noradrenaline excretion was lower with ephedrine (0.032+/-0.011 microg/mg creatinine) compared with placebo (0.044+/-0.012 microg/mg creatinine) (P<0.05). (+/-)Ephedrine is a relatively weak partial agonist of human beta1- and beta2-adrenoreceptors, and had no detectable activity at human beta3-adrenoreceptors. Ephedrine (50 mg thrice daily) modestly increases energy expenditure in normal human subjects. A lack of binding of ephedrine to beta3-adrenoreceptors and the observed decrease in urinary noradrenaline during ephedrine treatment suggest that the thermogenic effect of ephedrine results from direct beta1-/beta2-adrenoreceptor agonism. An indirect beta3-adrenergic effect through the release of noradrenaline seems unlikely as urinary noradrenaline decreased significantly with ephedrine.\n\nThe effect of ephedrine on intraoperative hypothermia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJo, Youn Yi; Kim, Ji Young; Kim, Joon-Sik; Kwon, Youngjun\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Prevention of intraoperative hypothermia has become a standard of operative care. Since ephedrine has a thermogenic effect and it is frequently used to treat hypotension during anesthesia, this study was designed to determine the effect of ephedrine on intraoperative hypothermia of patients who are undergoing spine surgery. Methods Twenty-four patients were randomly divided to receive an ephedrine (the ephedrine group, n = 12) or normal saline (the control group, n = 12) infusion for 2 h. The esophageal temperature (the core temperature), the index finger temperature (the peripheral temperature) and the hemodynamic variables such as the mean blood pressure and heart rate were measured every 15 minutes after the intubation. Results At the end of the study period, the esophageal temperature and hemodynamic variables were significantly decreased in the control group, whereas those in the ephedrine group were stably maintained. The index finger temperature was significantly lower in the ephedrine group compared to that in the control group, suggesting the prevention of core-to-peripheral redistribution of the heat as the cause of temperature maintenance. Conclusions An intraoperative infusion of ephedrine minimized the decrease of the core temperature and it stably maintained the hemodynamic variables during spine surgery with the patient under general anesthesia.

Clinical and stone analysis data from the Molecular Structure Laboratory at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, were reviewed. Stone analysis was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution X-ray crystallographic powder diffraction, or both. The urine and stone material from one of the subjects were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography. Stone analysis from seven patients demonstrated metabolites of guaifenesin. High-performance liquid chromatography revealed that the stone and urine from one subject had a high content of guaifenesin metabolites and a small amount of ephedrine. Demographic data were available on five patients. Three had a history of alcohol or drug dependency. All were consuming over-the-counter preparations containing ephedrine and guaifenesin. Four admitted to taking excessive quantities of these agents, mainly as a stimulant. Hypocitraturia was identified in two individuals subjected to urinary metabolic testing. These stones are radiolucent on standard X-ray imaging but can be demonstrated on unenhanced CT. Shockwave lithotripsy was performed in two patients, and the calculi fragmented easily. Individuals consuming large quantities of preparations containing ephedrine and guaifenesin may be at risk to develop stones derived mainly from metabolites of guaifenesin and small quantities of ephedrine. These patients may be prone to drug or alcohol dependency.\n\nEffect of combined therapy with ephedrine and hyperbaric oxygen on neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Siyuan; Xiao, Nong; Zhang, Xiaoping\n\n2009-11-13\n\nPerinatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) is a major cause of brain injury in the newborn, and there is a lack of effective therapies to reduce injury-related disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a combination of ephedrine and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) on neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups were randomly divided into sham operation, HI, ephedrine, HBO, and combined group. The ephedrine group was intraperitoneally injected with ephedrine, HBO group was treated for 2h at 2.5 absolute atmosphere (ATA) per day, the combined group received both ephedrine and HBO treatments, the sham operation and HI groups were intraperitoneally injected with normal saline. Rat brains at 7 days after HI, were collected to determine histopathological damage and the expression levels of Caspase-3 and Nogo-A. Four weeks after insult, animals were challenged with Morris water maze test. The expressions of Caspase-3 and Nogo-A were reduced in treating groups compared to those in HI group (P<0.01). Compared with the single treatment groups, the expression levels of Caspase-3 and Nogo-A were significantly reduced in the combined group (P<0.01). Compared with the single treatment groups, the average time of escape latency was significantly shorter (P<0.01) and the number of platform location crossing was more (P<0.05) in combined group. These findings indicate that the combination of ephedrine and HBO can enhance the neuroprotective effect in the neonatal rat HI model partially mediated by inhibiting Caspase-3 and Nogo-A pathways.\n\n[Economic impact of strategies using ephedrine prefilled syringes].\n\nPubMed\n\nCrÃ©gut-Corbaton, J; Malbranche, C; Guignard, M-H; Fagnoni, P\n\n2013-11-01\n\nEphedrine is an emergency drug available in ampules and syringes need to be prepared in advance according to one of two strategies in our establishment: strategy 1 (S1: 1 ampule per patient) and strategy 2 (S2: 1 ampule per operating room). There are also prefilled syringes. Because of their high cost and conflicting results in the literature, we assessed the economic interest of using prefilled syringes compared with strategies S1 and S2. This was a prospective observational study. The consumption of ephedrine was recorded over two periods of 14 days: P1 with syringes prepared in advance according to S1 or S2 and P2 with the on-demand use of prefilled syringes. The cost of a syringe of ephedrine prepared in advance (nurse time preparation included) was evaluated at â¬1.65 vs. â¬3.57 for a prefilled syringe. In operating rooms using S1, the use of prefilled syringes reduced overall the cost per patient about â¬1.22 and global annual costs by 72% (â¬2830), while the decrease was about â¬0.32 for the cost per patient and about 47% (â¬2760) for global annual costs for operating rooms using S2. The interest of our study is that we investigated different supply strategies for ephedrine within a large number of operating rooms. In our establishment, it was decided to use prefilled syringes in operating rooms that used S1. As well as the economic interest, prefilled syringes contributed to improved safety and saved nursing time. Copyright Â© 2013 SociÃ©tÃ© franÃ§aise dâanesthÃ©sie et de rÃ©animation (Sfar).

Peak-to-trough amplitudes were measured for the P1-N1 and the N1-P2 wave forms as well as baseline (500 msec prestimulus)-to-peak amplitudes for each component, i.e., P1, N1 and P2. Amplitudes were examined as a function of intensity and electrode location. Cz-Fz amplitude differences increased with increasing stimulus intensity, the differentiating peak being the N1 component. An overall reducing phenomenon was found at Fz in the 70-80 dB range whereas an augmenting effect was observed at Cz for these intensities. The augmenting/reducing groups defined by analysis of individual amplitude-intensity patterns were different whether we considered Fz or Cz results: Fz reducers were more numerous than Cz reducers. These results on prominent reducing at the frontal level were examined in relation to the data concerning the modulatory function of the frontal cortex on auditory EPs. Implications were drawn for the role of the frontal cortex in cortical augmenting-reducing.\n\nThe dose effect of ephedrine on the onset time of vecuronium.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Kyo S; Cheong, Mi A; Jeon, Jeong W; Lee, Jeong H; Shim, Jae C\n\n2003-04-01\n\nA small dose of ephedrine decreases the onset time of rocuronium and cisatracurium; however, ephedrine might be associated with adverse hemodynamic effects. The appropriate dose of ephedrine has not been determined. We, therefore, studied 120 patients anesthetized with fentanyl 2 microg/kg and propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg who were randomly divided to receive either ephedrine (30, 70, or 110 microg/kg) or saline. During propofol anesthesia, the neuromuscular block was monitored by mechanomyography by using submaximal current of train-of-four stimulation every 10 s. To determine cardiac output, a transcutaneous Doppler probe was placed externally at the suprasternal notch. Tracheal intubation was performed by a blinded investigator at 2 min after vecuronium. Neuromuscular block, intubating conditions, and hemodynamic effects were measured during the induction of anesthesia. Both ephedrine 70 and 110 microg/kg improved intubating conditions at 2 min after vecuronium; however, 110 microg/kg was associated with adverse hemodynamic effects. We conclude that ephedrine 70 microg/kg given before the induction of anesthesia improved intubating conditions at 2 min after vecuronium, probably by increased cardiac output without significant adverse hemodynamic effects. Ephedrine 70 microg/kg given before the induction of anesthesia improved tracheal intubating conditions at 2 min after vecuronium by increased cardiac output without significant adverse hemodynamic effects.\n\n(-)Ephedrine and caffeine mutually potentiate one another's amphetamine-like stimulus effects.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoung, R; Gabryszuk, M; Glennon, R A\n\n1998-10-01\n\nUsing rats trained to discriminate 1 mg/kg of (+)amphetamine (ED50 = 0.4 mg/kg) from saline vehicle in a two-lever drug discrimination procedure, it was shown that (-)ephedrine (ED50 = 4.5 mg/kg), but not (+)ephedrine, substitutes for the (+)AMPH stimulus. It was also shown that caffeine (ED50 = 12.9 mg/kg) can substitute for (+)amphetamine in a dose-related fashion. Doses of (-)ephedrine and caffeine, which produced < or = 1% drug-appropriate responding when administered alone, were able to enhance each other's stimulus effects when administered in combination such that there was a twofold leftward shift in their respective dose-response curves. Furthermore, stimulus generalization occurred when a dose of caffeine that produced saline-appropriate responding when administered alone was administered in combination with (+)ephedrine. It would appear that low doses of (-)ephedrine and caffeine may mutually potentiate one another's stimulus effects in (+)AMPH-trained rats, and that a combination of caffeine and (+)ephedrine result in altered stimulus character when compared to comparable doses of either agent administered alone.\n\n21 CFR 119.1 - Dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 2 2011-04-01 2011-04-01 false Dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids...

We thus tested the hypothesis that a bolus of ephedrine accelerates the onset of vecuronium neuromuscular block by increasing cardiac output. A prospective, randomized study was conducted in 53 patients scheduled for elective surgery. After the induction of anesthesia, the ulnar nerve was stimulated supramaximally every 10 s, and the evoked twitch response of the adductor pollicis was recorded with accelerometry. Patients were maintained under anesthesia with continuous infusion of propofol for 10 min and then randomly assigned to ephedrine 210 microg/kg (n = 27) or an equivalent volume of saline (n = 26). The test solution was given 1 min before the administration of 0.1 mg/kg of vecuronium. Cardiac output was monitored with impedance cardiography. Ephedrine, but not saline, increased cardiac index (17%; P = 0.003). Nonetheless, the onset of 90% neuromuscular block was virtually identical in the patients given ephedrine (183 +/- 41 s) and saline (181 +/- 47 s). There was no correlation between cardiac index and onset of the blockade. We conclude that the onset of the vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block is primarily determined by factors other than cardiac output. The combination of ephedrine and vecuronium thus cannot be substituted for rapid-acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Ephedrine increased cardiac index but failed to speed onset of neuromuscular block with vecuronium. We conclude that ephedrine administration does not shorten the onset time of vecuronium.\n\nThe relevance of the urinary concentration of ephedrines in anti-doping analysis: determination of pseudoephedrine, cathine, and ephedrine after administration of over-the-counter medicaments.\n\nPubMed\n\nStrano-Rossi, Sabina; Leone, Daniele; de la Torre, Xavier; BotrÃ¨, Francesco\n\n2009-08-01\n\nThis article describes a method for the detection and quantitation of cathine, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and methylephedrine in urine, using their deuterated analogues as internal standards and derivatization to form the corresponding trimethylsilyl derivatives after a simple liquid-liquid extraction. The study was designed to evaluate whether the urinary cutoff values set by the World Anti-Doping Agency for the banned ephedrines (cathine >5 microg/mL, ephedrine and methylephedrine >10 microg/mL) can be exceeded after the normal self-administration of common over-the-counter medicaments containing nonbanned ephedrines. The present method, after validation, has been applied on real urine samples obtained from 9 healthy volunteers taking different doses of over-the-counter preparations containing ephedrines. Results obtained from excretion studies show high interindividual differences in the urinary concentrations of both pseudoephedrine and cathine, not dependent on body weight or sex nor, in some instances, on the administered dose. The same typical therapeutic dose of pseudoephedrine (60 mg) produced a urinary concentration of more than 5 microg/mL for cathine and of more than 100 microg/mL for pseudoephedrine in 2 of 9 subjects only. When a dose of 120 mg was administered, cathine concentration exceeded 5 microg/mL in 4 of 7 subject, and also concentrations of pseudoephedrine above 100 microg/mL. After administration of 5 x 120 mg of pseudoephedrine (120 mg administered every 7 days for 5 weeks) to one of the subjects exceeding the urinary threshold values, the urinary concentration of cathine and pseudoephedrine exceeded 5 microg/mL (peak concentration 14.8 microg/mL) and 100 microg/mL (peak concentration 275 microg/mL), respectively. When the same subject took 180 mg of pseudoephedrine, the urinary concentration values were below 5 microg/mL for ephedrine and 100 microg/mL for pseudoephedrine. In the case of ephedrine administration in a sustained\n\nA new optical method for a fast and simple detection of ephedrine\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVarriale, Antonio; Staiano, Maria; Strianese, Maria; Marzullo, Vincenzo; Ruggiero, Giuseppe; Secchi, Alberto; Dispenza, Massimiliano; Fiorello, Anna Maria; D'Auria, Sabato\n\n2011-11-01\n\nIn this work we describe the synthesis of a new ephedrine derivative with a carbon linker featuring an amino reactive group, and its conjugation to the glutamine binding protein (GlnBP) from E. coli as a carrier protein for the production of polyclonal antibodies in rabbits against ephedrine.

An Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 Î¼m, 2.1âmmâÃâ50âmm) was used for chromatographic separation. Electrospray ionization in the positive mode was used, and the precursor-fragment ion pairs of m/z 166/148 and m/z 289/97 were adopted to characterize ephedrine and testosterone (internal standard), respectively. The method was validated using 10, 100 and 500âng/mL of ephedrine. It demonstrated adequate levels of precision and accuracy, matrix effect, extraction recovery and stability. Linearity over the concentration range of 0.5-2000âng/mL was acceptable with a correlation coefficient (rÂ²) better than 0.990. To determine the pharmacokinetic behaviour of this sympathomimetic compound in the Sprague-Dawley rats, ephedrine hydrochloride, Herba Ephedrae single-herb and Wu Tou Tang decoctions were administered orally, and ephedrine hydrochloride was also administered by intravenous injection, and blood samples were collected over 24âh. Ephedrine was measured in plasma and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by using the standard non-compartmental method and calculated by using Practical Pharmacokinetic Program-Version 87/97. The AUC(0-t) and T(max) values were significantly different (pâ<â0.05). Ephedrine AUC(0-t) values were significantly lower following the Wu Tou Tang decoction compared to the other oral treatments, suggesting that some components in the decoction may reduce the bioavailability of ephedrine.\n\nSimple HPLC method for detection of trace ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in high-purity methamphetamine.\n\nPubMed\n\nMakino, Yukiko\n\n2012-03-01\n\nA simple and sensitive HPLC technique was developed for the qualitative determination of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine (ephedrines), used as precursors of clandestine d-methamphetamine hydrochloride of high purity. Good separation of ephedrines from bulk d-methamphetamine was achieved, without any extraction or derivatization procedure on a CAPCELLPACK C18 MGII (250âÃâ4.6âmm) column. The mobile phase consisted of 50âmM KH2 PO4-acetonitrile (94:6âv/v %) using an isocratic pump system within 20âmin for detecting two analytes. One run took about 50âmin as it was necessary to wash out overloaded methamphetamine for column conditioning. The analytes were detected by UV absorbance measurement at 210ânm. A sample (20âmg) was simply dissolved in 1âmL of water, and a 50âÎ¼L aliquot of the solution was injected into the HPLC. The detection limits for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in bulk d-methamphetamine were as low as 3âppm each. This analytical separation technique made it possible to detect ephedrine and/or pseudoephedrine in seven samples of high-purity d-methamphetamine hydrochloride seized in Japan. The presence of trace ephedrines in illicit methamphetamine may strongly indicate a synthetic route via ephedrine in methamphetamine profiling. This method is simple and sensitive, requiring only commonly available equipment, and should be useful for high-purity methamphetamine profiling.

In the current study, we evaluated the effects of ephedrine versus phenylephrine on bispectral index (BIS) during combined general and epidural anesthesia. After injection of ropivacaine through the epidural catheter, general anesthesia was induced with propofol and vecuronium, and was maintained with 0.75% sevoflurane. Approximately 10 min after the intubation, BIS was recorded as a baseline value. Patients with decreases in arterial blood pressure <30% of the preanesthetic values were defined as control group (n = 9). Patients who had to be treated for larger decreases in arterial blood pressure were randomly assigned to receive ephedrine 0.1 mg/kg (n = 17) or phenylephrine 2 micro g/kg (n = 17). BIS values were recorded at 1-min intervals for 10 min. BIS in the ephedrine group was significantly larger from 7 to 10 min than that in the control and phenylephrine groups (P < 0.05). Seven patients in the ephedrine group had BIS >60, whereas no patient in the control and phenylephrine groups had BIS >60 (P < 0.005). Ephedrine, but not phenylephrine, increased BIS during general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia.\n\nThe Impact of a Shortage of Pharmacy-Prepared Ephedrine Syringes on Intraoperative Medication Use.\n\nPubMed\n\nLadha, Karim S; Nanji, Karen C; Pierce, Eric; Poon, K Trudy; Hyder, Joseph A\n\n2015-08-01\n\nAnesthesia-related medication shortages have become increasingly common in the United States. We tested whether a local shortage of pharmacy-prepared ephedrine syringes, replaced by provider-prepared ephedrine, was associated with provider-level changes in ephedrine and phenylephrine use and patient-level changes in intraoperative hemodynamics. Consecutive patients undergoing general and orthopedic surgery at a tertiary care center were included 1 month before and 1 month after the start of the pharmacy-prepared ephedrine syringe shortage. Lowest mean arterial blood pressure and slowest heart rate were obtained as measures of hemodynamics. Adjusted associations were tested using mixed-effects regression with repeated measures. Three hundred four patients before the shortage and 298 patients after the shortage began were included. The administration of at least 1 bolus of ephedrine was significantly more common before versus during the shortage (148/304 [48.7]% vs 117/298 [39.3]%; P = 0.0199). After adjusting for age, sex, ASA physical status, surgery type, anesthesia provider, and operative duration, patients were significantly less likely to receive ephedrine during the shortage (relative risk [RR] = 0.78 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.61-0.96]; P = 0.0198) and more likely to receive a phenylephrine bolus (RR = 1.27 [95% CI, 1.02-1.51]; P = 0.0357). Patient hemodynamics assessed by slowest heart rate or lowest mean arterial blood pressure did not differ significantly during the shortage. There was an alteration in medication administration patterns during a shortage of pharmacy-prepared syringes. Changes in ephedrine and phenylephrine use were noted; however, patient hemodynamics remained comparable. Provider use patterns were sensitive even to a relative and not absolute medication shortage as observed in this study.\n\nTransient Cardiomyopathy and Quadriplegia Induced by Ephedrine Decongestant\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKurklinsky, Andrew K.; Chirila, Razvan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nEphedrine decongestant products are widely used. Common side effects include palpitations, nervousness, and headache. More severe adverse reactions include cardiomyopathy and vasospasm. We report the case of an otherwise healthy 37-year-old woman who presented with acute-onset quadriplegia and heart failure. She had a normal chest radiograph on admission, but developed marked pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions the next day. Echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.18 and no obvious intrinsic pathologic condition such as foramen narrowing on spinal imaging. Laboratory screening was positive for methamphetamines in the urine, and the patient admitted to having used, over the past several weeks, multiple ephedrine-containing products for allergy-symptom relief. She was ultimately diagnosed with an acute catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy and spinal artery vasospasm consequential to excessive use of decongestants. Her symptoms resolved completely with supportive care and appropriate heart-failure management. An echocardiogram 2 weeks after admission showed improvement of the left ventricular ejection fraction to 0.33. Ten months after the event, the patient was entirely asymptomatic and showed further improvement of her ejection fraction to 0.45. To our knowledge, ours is the first report of spinal artery vasospasm resulting in quadriplegia in a human being after ephedrine ingestion.

B.; Wood, C. D.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the efficacy of transdermal therapeutic system-scopolamine administered alone and combined with ephedrine sulfate given orally in doses of 12.5, 25, and 50 mg. Eight normal male students were exposed to stressful accelerations in a slow-rotation room after receiving 10 apparently identical treatments comprising the four drugs and six placebos. Efficacy of the drug was defined in terms of the placebo range and categorized as beneficial, inconsequential, or detrimental. None of the effects was detrimental. Overall beneficial effects were 60% for transdermal therapeutic system-scopolamine (plus placebo) and 57% for the three transdermal therapeutic system-scopolamine plus ephedrine combinations.\n\n[Simultaneous determination of ephedrine hydrochloride, D-pseudoephedrine and amygdalin in xiao'er pingchuan qutan granule by HPLC].\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, De-Bin; Tong, Yan; Ma, Zhen-Shan; Wang, Lin; Dong, Mei-Hong; Li, Yan-Ling; Wang, Jin-Yu\n\n2013-03-01\n\nTo establish an HPLC method for the determination of ephedrine hydrochloride, D-pseudo-ephedrine and amygdalin in Xiao'er Pingchuan Qutan granule. Pheny ether chromatographic column (4.6 mm x 250 mm, 5 microm) was adopted, with acetonitrile-0.1% phosphoric acid (containing 0.1% three ethylamine) (3:97) as the mobile phase. The UV detection wavelength was at 210 nm, with the flow rate of 1 mL x min(-1), and column temperature was at 35 degrees C. The linearity of ephedrine hydrochloride, D-pseudo-ephedrine and amygdalin ranged between 0.078 60-3.144 microg (r = 1.000 0), 0.103 4-2.068 microg (r = 0.999 7) and 0.430 5-3.157 microg (r = 0.999 8), respectively. Their average recoveries were 98.46% (RSD 1.1%), 103.0% (RSD 1.5%) and 97.15% (RSD 2.1%), respectively.

To compare the effects of priming and ephedrine pretreatment on the onset time of intubating dose of vecuronium. A prospective, randomized comparative study was done at a state-owned tertiary care teaching hospital. After obtaining the Institutional Ethical Committee approval and written informed consent, sixty patients of either gender aged 18-60 years, the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status Class I/II, weighing 40-70 kg, were randomly divided into two groups of thirty each. Group E received 70 Î¼g/kg ephedrine, and Group P received 0.01 mg/kg of vecuronium 3 min before intubating dose of vecuronium. Intubation was done after getting a train of four zero. Intubation time, clinical intubation grade using Cooper's scale, and hemodynamic parameters were noted. Chi-square test and independent t -test were done with PASW statistics 18 to analyze data. The mean time for intubation in ephedrine group (E) was 104 Â± 23.282 s and in the priming group (P), it was 142 Â± 55.671 s ( P = 0.001). All patients had clinically acceptable intubating conditions, and the grades were comparable among groups ( P = 0.791). Hemodynamic parameters were comparable between groups at all time frames ( P > 0.05). Pretreatment with ephedrine 70 Î¼g/kg shortens the onset time of vecuronium for intubation and is superior to the priming technique. Low-dose ephedrine, when used along with propofol induction, provides hemodynamic stability during induction and intubation.\n\nComparison of Effect of Ephedrine and Priming on the Onset Time of Vecuronium\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAnandan, Krishnadas; Suseela, Indu; Purayil, Harish Valiya\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground: Succinylcholine has been the neuromuscular blocking drug of choice for laryngoscopy and intubation, but it has several adverse effects.

Methods A total of 140 adult patients were randomized into 4 groups to receive either 30 Âµg/kg ephedrine (Group 30, n = 35), 70 Âµg/kg ephedrine (Group 70, n = 35), 110 Âµg/kg ephedrine (Group 110, n = 35), 3 ml normal saline (Group C, n = 35) as pretreatment given 30 s before anesthetic induction. Neuromuscular block was achieved with 0.15 mg/kg cisatracurium, evaluated accelomyographically with train-of-four stimulation. An anesthesiologist blinded to patient grouping assessed the intubating conditions 1.5 min after cisatracurium administration. Results An onset time of 70 s was obtained in the ephedrine groups (Group 30: 155.4 Â± 44.7 s, Group 70: 152.6 Â± 40.3 s, Group 110: 151.2 Â± 51.6 s) compared to Group C (224.6 Â± 56.9 s) after 0.15 mg/kg of cisatracurium (P < 0.001). Ephedrine doses of either 70 or 110 Âµg/kg for pretreatment significantly improved intubating conditions (P < 0.05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate at 1 min after tracheal intubation were significantly increased than other times in all groups (P < 0.001), with no differences among the groups. However, 5 patients in Group 110 experienced marked hypertension (systolic/diastolic blood pressure: > 200/100 mmHg) 1 min after tracheal intubation with no patients in other groups. Conclusions We conclude that pre-treatment with ephedrine 70 Âµg/kg improved intubating conditions 1.5 min after cisatracurium administration and facilitated the onset of neuromuscular block (70 s) without adverse hemodynamic effects.

General anaesthesia was induced with propofol and was maintained with propofol (4 mg kg-1 h-1) and fentanyl. Vecuronium was used to facilitate the artificial ventilation of the lungs. Patients with systolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg were defined as the control group (n = 16). Patients who had to be treated for larger decreases in arterial blood pressure (systolic blood pressure 60, whereas no patient in the control or phenylephrine groups had bispectral index >60. There were no significant differences in propofol concentrations or cardiac output relative to baseline at 3 or 10 min after the administration of ephedrine or phenylephrine. Ephedrine increases bispectral index values without decreasing propofol concentrations during general anesthesia.\n\n[Determination of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in Herba Ephedrae and Maxing Shigan Tang by capillary zone electrophoresis].\n\nPubMed\n\nJing, Haoran; Guo, Huaizhong; Wang, Zijun; Wang, Min; Zhang, Bin\n\n2009-04-01\n\nTo establish a method for the determination of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in Herba Ephedrae and Maxing Shigan Tang by capillary zone electrophoresis. The conditions of the experiment were optimized with a fused-silica capillary of 60 cm x 50 microm (50 cm effective length) in a running buffer of 50 mmol x L(-1) borax-20 mmol x L(-1) threonine (pH 9.27) and an applied voltage of 15 kV (room temperature). Samples were introduced by hydrodynamic injections (10 cm x 20 s)and determined with on-column UV monitoring at 210 nm. Phenobarbital was chosen as the internal standard. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are separated successfully within 8 min. The linear responses covered the ranges from 21.3 to 213 mg x L(-1) (r = 0.9996) for ephedrine and from 8.4 to 84 mg x L(-1) (r = 0.9995) for pseudoephedrine. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine were shown to be 1.45 and 1.48 microg x mL(-1), respectively, The quantitation limits (S/N = 10) of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine were shown to be 4.81 and 4.93 mg x L(-1), respectively. The average recoveries for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine were 97.5% and 98.6% with RSD less than 5.0%. The method is simple, rapid, cost-effective and precise with satisfactory results.\n\nA beating heart cell model to predict cardiotoxicity: effects of the dietary supplement ingredients higenamine, phenylethylamine, ephedrine and caffeine.\n\nPubMed\n\nCalvert, Richard; Vohra, Sanah; Ferguson, Martine; Wiesenfeld, Paddy\n\n2015-04-01\n\nSome dietary supplements may contain cardiac stimulants and potential cardiotoxins. In vitro studies may identify ingredients of concern. A beating human cardiomyocyte cell line was used to evaluate cellular effects following phenylethylamine (PEA), higenamine, ephedrine or caffeine treatment. PEA and higenamine exposure levels simulated published blood levels in humans or animals after intravenous administration. Ephedrine and caffeine levels approximated published blood levels following human oral intake. At low or midrange levels, each chemical was examined plus or minus 50âÂµM caffeine, simulating human blood levels reported after consumption of caffeine-enriched dietary supplements. To measure beats per minute (BPM), peak width, etc., rhythmic rise and fall in intracellular calcium levels following 30âmin of treatment was examined. Higenamine 31.3âng/ml or 313âng/ml significantly increased BPM in an escalating manner. PEA increased BPM at 0.8 and 8âÂµg/ml, while 80âÂµg/ml PEA reduced BPM and widened peaks. Ephedrine produced a significant BPM dose response from 0.5 to 5.0âÂµM. Caffeine increased BPM only at a toxic level of 250âÂµM. Adding caffeine to PEA or higenamine but not ephedrine further increased BPM. These in vitro results suggest that additional testing may be warranted in vivo to further evaluate these effects.

Rats were intraperitoneally injected with D-GalN (400 mg/kg) and LPS (40 Î¼g/kg) to induce acute liver failure. The treatment groups were then intraperitoneally administered pseudoephedrine/ephedrine at 0 h and 4 h after induction and the activation induced by treatment with pseudoephedrine and/or LPS on the primary Kupffer cells (KCs) was monitored. Compared with controls induced by GalN/LPS alone, pseudoephedrine dramatically reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells and bile ductular hyperplasia and hepatic necrosis observed in liver sections. It inhibited both hepatocellular apoptosis and the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1. It lowered the production of tumour necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) in the beginning of acute liver failure induced by D-GalN/LPS. Correspondingly, levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBIL) and malondialdehyde were attenuated. Ephedrine demonstrated all these identical protective effects as well. In addition, pseudoephedrine significantly suppressed the production of p-IÎºB-Î±, reducing the degradation of sequestered nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) in the cytoplasm, and inhibited the translocation of NF-ÎºB/p65 to the nucleus, the transcription of TNF-Î± mRNA and the production of TNF-Î± in primary KCs. These results suggest that pseudoephedrine and ephedrine have a potent anti-inflammatory activity against D-GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure in rats, and this comprehensive anti-inflammatory effect may result from the inhibition of TNF-Î± production.

Synthesised materials were characterised by X-ray crystallography, infrared spectroscopy, swelling and surface area. Recognition properties were assessed by the ability to discriminate between (+) and (-)-ephedrine and by Scatchard analyses on chromatographic mode. It was shown that polymer morphology and recognition properties are affected by the magnetic field. This resulted in considerable improvements in the chromatographic resolution of ephedrine enantiomers by materials synthesised under the influence of magnetic field. Apparently the magnetic field improved the ordering of the polymer structure and facilitated the formation of more uniform imprinting sites.\n\nVasopressor choice for hypotension in elective Cesarean section: ephedrine or phenylephrine?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGunda, Chandrakala P.; Malinowski, Jennifer; Tegginmath, Aruna; Suryanarayana, Venkatesh G.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIntroduction Hypotensive episodes are a common complication of spinal anesthesia during Cesarean section. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and the side effects of vasopressors, ephedrine and phenylephrine, administered for hypotension during elective Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Material and methods The study consisted of 100 selected ASA I/II females scheduled for elective Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Each patient was randomly assigned to one of the two double-blind study groups. Group E received 1 ml ephedrine (5 mg/ml) with normal saline if hypotension was present (n=50). Group P received 1 ml phenylephrine (100 Âµg/ml) with normal saline if hypotension developed (n=50). Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) were compared within and between groups to basal levels at time increments of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 min from start of surgery. Incidence of side effects and neonatal outcomes were studied between groups. Results All patients required vasopressor therapy for hypotension. Administration of phenylephrine was associated with significant drop in HR. Changes in SBP, DBP, and MAP were similar in both groups for most observed times. The incidences of nausea/vomiting and tachycardia were significantly higher in the ephedrine group. Conclusions Phenylephrine and ephedrine are acceptable choices to combat maternal hypotension related to spinal anesthesia in elective Cesarean section. Complications of intra-operative nausea and vomiting, tachycardia and bradycardia should be considered when choosing a vasopressor, suggesting phenylephrine may be more appropriate when considering maternal well-being.

However, they were always adulterated illegally in BDS to promote losing weight. In order to avoid detection, various kinds of ephedrine analogues were added rather than ephedrine itself. This has brought about great difficulties in authentication of BDS. In this study, we put forward for the first time a method which combined thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to directly identify trace adulterant. Ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, methylephedrine, and norephedrine were mixed and used in this method to develop anÂ analytical model. As a result, the four analogues were separated efficiently in TLC analysis, and trace-components and low-background SERS detection was realized. The limit of detection (LOD) of the four analogues was 0.01Â mg/mL. Eight common Raman peaks (â³Ï â=â620, 1003, 1030, 1159, 1181, 1205, 1454, 1603Â cm(-1)) were extracted experimentally and statistically to characterize the common feature of ephedrine analogues. AÂ TLC-SERS method coupled with common-peak model was adopted to examine nine practical samples, two of which were found to be adulterated with ephedrine analogues. Identification results were then confirmed by UPLC-QTOF/MS analysis. The proposed method was simple, rapid, and accurate andÂ can also be employed to trace adulterant identification even when there are no available reference derivatives on-site or unknown types of ephedrine analogues are adulterated.\n\n76 FR 56807 - Proposed Adjustment of the Assessment of Annual Needs for the List I Chemicals Ephedrine...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-09-14\n\n... the Assessment of Annual Needs for the List I Chemicals Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, and... request for comments.

In Asian countries, the abuse of methamphetamine is one of the most pressing problems. To assist in the control of methamphetamine, the authors investigated in detail the character of ephedrine, which is a key precursor for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine. Commercial ephedrine is produced by one of three methods: (a) extraction from Ephedra plants, (b) full chemical synthesis or (c) via a semi-synthetic process involving the fermentation of sugar, followed by amination. Although chemically there is no difference between ephedrine samples from different origins (natural, synthetic or semi-synthetic), scientific and analytical tools such as drug-characterization and impurity-profiling programmes may provide valuable information for law enforcement and regulatory activities as part of precursor control strategies. During the research under discussion in the present article, in addition to classical impurity profiling of manufacturing by-products, the use of stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry was investigated for determining the origin of the ephedrine that had been used as a precursor in seized methamphetamine samples. The results of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratio (delta13C and delta15N) analysis of samples of crystalline methamphetamine seized in Japan suggested that the drug had been synthesized from either natural or semi-synthetic ephedrine and not from synthetic ephedrine. Stable isotope ratio analysis is expected to be a useful tool for tracing the origins of seized methamphetamine. It has attracted much interest from precursor control authorities in Japan and the East Asian region and may prove useful in the international control of precursors.\n\nComparison of the effects of D-(-)-ephedrine and L-(+)-pseudoephedrine on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems in man.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDrew, C D; Knight, G T; Hughes, D T; Bush, M\n\n1978-01-01\n\n1 In a preliminary double-blind trial the effects of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine on the blood pressure and heart rate of resting healthy volunteers were compared. Ephedrine 60 or 90 mg were required to raise the diastolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg, whereas 210 or 240 mg pseudoephedrine were required to produce the same effect. 2 In a second double-blind trial, patients with reversible airways obstruction were given 60 mg ephedrine or 210 mg pseudoephedrine and the effects on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) compared. Both isomers produced some bronchodilation, but the effect of pseudoephedrine was less than half that of ephedrine. 3 The reasons for these differences between the isomers are discussed and the efficacy of pseudoephedrine as a nasal decongestant pointed out and explained in relation to its effect on alpha-adrenoceptors in the nasal blood vessels.

Identification of proper storage conditions has been a matter of concern for most toxicology laboratories (both clinical and forensic), and the stability of drugs of abuse has been extensively studied. This concern should be extended to other areas of analytical chemistry like antidoping control. In this work, the stability of ephedrine derivatives (ephedrine, norephedrine, methylephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and norpseudoephedrine), and amphetamine derivatives (amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)) in urine has been studied. Spiked urine samples were prepared for stability testing. Urine samples were quantified by GC/NPD or GC/MS. The homogeneity of each batch of sample was verified before starting the stability study. The stability of analytes was evaluated in sterilized and non-sterilized urine samples at different storage conditions. For long-term stability testing, analyte concentration in urine stored at 4 degrees C and -20 degrees C was determined at different time intervals for 24 months for sterile urine samples, and for 6 months for non-sterile samples. For short-term stability testing, analyte concentration was evaluated in liquid urine stored at 37 degrees C for 7 days. The effect of repeated freezing (at -20 degrees C) and thawing (at room temperature) was also studied in sterile urine for up to three cycles. No significant loss of the analytes under study was observed at any of the investigated conditions. These results show the feasibility of preparing reference materials containing ephedrine and amphetamine derivatives to be used for quality control purposes.\n\nA validated HPLC-PDA method for identification and quantification of two bioactive alkaloids, ephedrine and cryptolepine, in different Sida species.\n\nPubMed\n\nChatterjee, Arnab; Kumar, Satyanshu; Chattopadhyay, Sunil K\n\n2013-12-01\n\nA simple, rapid, accurate and reproducible reverse-phase HPLC method has been developed for the identification and quantification of two alkaloids ephedrine and cryptolepine in different extracts of Sida species using photodiode array detection. Baseline separation of the two alkaloids was achieved on a Waters RP-18 X-terra column (250 Ã 4.6 mm, 5 Âµm) using a solvent system consisting of a mixture of water containing 0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and acetonitrile in a gradient elution mode with detection at 210 and 280 nm for ephedrine and cryptolepine, respectively. The calibration curves were linear in a concentration range of 10-250 Âµg/mL for both the alkaloids with correlation coefficient values >0.99. The limits of detection and quantification for ephedrine and cryptolepine were 5 and 10 Âµg/mL and 2.5 and 5 Âµg/mL, respectively. Relative standard deviation values for intra-day and inter-day precision were 1.22 and 1.04% for ephedrine and 1.71 and 2.06% for cryptolepine, respectively. Analytical recovery ranged from 92.46 to 103.95%. The developed HPLC method was applied to identify and quantify ephedrine and cryptolepine in different extracts of Sida species.

Results showed that ephedrine molecules arrange exclusively as dimers by Ï-Ï stacking of the aromatic rings within the AFI channels. Interestingly, the asymmetric nature of ephedrine and the presence of H-bond-forming groups (NH2 and OH) involve a preferential orientation where consecutive dimers within the channels are rotated by an angle of +30Â°; this is driven by the establishment of inter-dimer H-bonds. This preferential orientation leads to the development of a supramolecular enantiomerically-pure helicoidal (chiral) arrangement of ephedrine dimers. In addition, the computational results demonstrate that the particular molecular structure of ephedrine imparts a strong trend to attract negative charges to the vicinity of the NH2(+) positively-charged groups. Hence divalent dopants such as Mg, whose replacement by trivalent Al in the aluminophosphate network involves the generation of a negative charge, will tend to locate close to the NH2(+) molecular groups, suggesting that an imprinting of the organic arrangement to the spatial distribution of dopants would be feasible. Combined with the trend of ephedrine to arrange in a helicoidal fashion, an enantiomerically-pure helicoidal distribution of dopants would be expected, thus inducing a new type of chirality in microporous materials.\n\nDetermination the active compounds of herbal preparation by UHPLC-MS/MS and its application on the preclinical pharmacokinetics of pure ephedrine, single herbal extract of Ephedra, and a multiple herbal preparation in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Ju-Wen; Chiang, Meng-Hsuan; Lu, Chia-Ming; Tsai, Tung-Hu\n\n2016-07-15\n\nThe herbal preparation Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang (MXGST) is a popular traditional Chinese formulation that has been used for the treatment of coughs and fevers. The potential active components of MXGST are ephedrine, amygdalin, and glycyrrhizic acid. The aim of this study was to develop a validated analytical method to measure these analytes in the herbal preparation MXGST using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used to monitor m/z 166.1â148.1 for ephedrine ([M+H](+)), 475.2â163.0 for amygdalin ([M+NH4](+)), and 840.6â453.3 ([M+NH4](+)) for glycyrrhizic acid. The analytes were separated by a reverse phase C18 column (100Ã2.1mm, 2.6Î¼m). The mobile phase consisted of 5mM ammonium acetate (0.1% formic acid) and 100% methanol (0.1% formic acid) with a linear gradient elution. Five brands of commercial pharmaceutical herbal products and a laboratory extract of MXGST were analyzed. Moreover, the modified UHPLC-MS/MS method was applied to the comparative pharmacokinetics of ephedrine in rats from the following three sources: (1) pure ephedrine, (2) an herbal extract of Ephedra, and (3) an herbal preparation of MXGST. Plasma samples from rats were prepared by protein precipitation, evaporation and reconstitution. The pharmacokinetic data showed that pure ephedrine was absorbed significantly faster than ephedrine of the Ephedra extract or the MXGST herbal preparation. However, the elimination half-life of ephedrine administered as the pure compound was 93.9Â±8.07min, but for ephedrine from the Ephedra extract and the MXGST, the half-lives were 133Â±17 and 247Â±57.6min, respectively. The area under the concentration curves (AUC) did not show significant differences among the three groups. These data suggest that the rest of the herbal ingredients in the Ephedra extract and the MXGST may provide a compensation effect that reduces the peak concentration of ephedrine and prolongs the\n\n[Comparison of metaraminol, phenylephrine and ephedrine in prophylaxis and treatment of hypotension in cesarean section under spinal anesthesia].\n\nPubMed\n\nAragÃ£o, FÃ¡bio Farias de; AragÃ£o, Pedro Wanderley de; Martins, Carlos Alberto de Souza; Salgado Filho, Natalino; Barroqueiro, Elizabeth de Souza Barcelos\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMaternal hypotension is a common complication after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section, with deleterious effects on the fetus and mother. Among the strategies aimed at minimizing the effects of hypotension, vasopressor administration is the most efficient. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of phenylephrine, metaraminol, and ephedrine in the prevention and treatment of hypotension after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section. Ninety pregnant women, not in labor, undergoing cesarean section were randomized into three groups to receive a bolus followed by continuous infusion of vasopressor as follows: phenylephrine group (50Î¼g+50Î¼g/min); metaraminol group (0.25mg+0.25mg/min); ephedrine group (4mg+4mg/min). Infusion dose was doubled when systolic blood pressure decreased to 80% of baseline and a bolus was given when systolic blood pressure decreased below 80%. The infusion dose was divided in half when systolic blood pressure increased to 120% and was stopped when it became higher. The incidence of hypotension, nausea and vomiting, reactive hypertension, bradycardia, tachycardia, Apgar scores, and arterial cord blood gases were assessed at the 1st and 5th minutes. There was no difference in the incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, reactive hypertension, infusion discontinuation, atropine administration or Apgar scores. Rescue boluses were higher only in the ephedrine group compared to metaraminol group. The incidence of nausea and vomiting and fetal acidosis were greater in the ephedrine group. The three drugs were effective in preventing hypotension; however, fetal effects were more frequent in the ephedrine group, although transient.

In this study stable isotope ratio analysis was investigated as a means of determining the origin of the methylamphetamine precursors, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine may be prepared industrially by several routes. Results are presented for the stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta(13)C), nitrogen (delta(15)N) and hydrogen (delta(2)H) measured in methylamphetamine samples synthesized from ephedrine and pseudoephedrine of known provenance. It is clear from the results that measurement of the delta(13)C, delta(15)N and delta(2)H stable isotope ratios by elemental analyzer/thermal conversion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA/TC-IRMS) in high-purity methylamphetamine samples will allow determination of the synthetic source of the ephedrine or pseudoephedrine precursor as being either of a natural, semi-synthetic, or fully synthetic origin.

Using longitudinal data, we investigated whether reduced cortical thickness (CT) in these regions arises early and persists over adolescence in BN, independent of symptom remission, and whether CT reductions are markers of BN symptoms. A total of 33 adolescent females with BN symptoms (BN or other specified feeding or eating disorder) and 28 healthy adolescents participated in this study. Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging and clinical data were acquired at 3 time points within 2-year intervals over adolescence, with 31% average attrition between assessments. Using a region-of-interest approach, we assessed group differences in CT at baseline and over time, and tested whether between- and within-subject variations in CT were associated with the frequency of BN symptoms. Reduced CT in the right inferior frontal gyrus persisted over adolescence in BN compared to healthy adolescents, even in those who achieved full or partial remission. Within the BN group, between-subject variations in CT in the inferior and orbital frontal regions were inversely associated with specific BN symptoms, suggesting, on average over time, greater CT reductions in individuals with more frequent BN symptoms. Reduced CT in inferior frontal regions may contribute to illness persistence into adulthood. Reductions in the thickness of the inferior and orbital frontal regions may be markers of specific BN symptoms. Because our sample size precluded correcting for multiple comparisons, these findings should be replicated in a larger sample. Future study of functional changes in associated fronto-striatal circuits could identify potential circuit-based intervention targets.

Decades of research has linked approach motivation with greater relative left frontal-cortical asymmetry. Other research has linked avoidance motivation with greater relative right frontal-cortical asymmetry. However, past work linking withdrawal motivation with greater relative right frontal asymmetry has been mixed. The current article reviews evidence suggesting that activation of the regulatory system (revised Behavioral Inhibition System [r-BIS]) may be more strongly related to greater relative right frontal asymmetry than withdrawal motivation. Specifically, research suggests that greater activation of the r-BIS is associated with greater relative right frontal activity, and reduced r-BIS activation is associated with reduced right frontal activity (greater relative left frontal activity). We review evidence examining trait and state frontal activity using EEG, source localization, lesion studies, neuronal stimulation, and fMRI supporting the idea that r-BIS may be the core personality system related to greater relative right frontal activity. In addition, the current review seeks to disentangle avoidance motivation and r-BIS as substrates of relative right frontal asymmetry.

A thorough discussion and review of mucoceles is included. A 68-year-old white man presented with intermittent diplopia and a pressure sensation in the right eye. He had a history of chronic sinusitis and had had endoscopic sinus surgery 5 years prior. A maxillofacial computed tomography scan revealed a large right frontal sinus mucocele, which had caused erosion along the medial wall of the right orbit and the outer and inner tables of the right frontal sinus. The mucocele had protruded both into the right orbit and intracranially, causing mass effect on the frontal lobe, which led to frontal lobe syndrome. The patient was successfully treated with endoscopic right ethmoidectomy, radial frontal sinusotomy, marsupialization of the mucocele, and transcutaneous irrigation. Paranasal sinus mucoceles may expand and lead to bony erosion and can become very invasive in surrounding structures such as the orbit and cranium. This case not only exhibits a very rare presentation of frontal sinus mucocele with intracranial extension and frontal lobe mass effect causing a frontal lobe syndrome but also demonstrates many of the ocular and visual complications commonly associated with paranasal sinus mucoceles. Early identification and surgical intervention is vital for preventing and reducing morbidity associated with invasive mucoceles, and the patient must be followed regularly to monitor for recurrence.\n\nReduced Frontal Activations at High Working Memory Load in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Near-Infrared Spectroscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nYeung, Michael K; Sze, Sophia L; Woo, Jean; Kwok, Timothy; Shum, David H K; Yu, Ruby; Chan, Agnes S\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSome functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported altered activations in the frontal cortex during working memory (WM) performance in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but the findings have been mixed. The objective of the present study was to utilize near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an alternative imaging technique, to examine neural processing during WM performance in individuals with MCI. Twenty-six older adults with MCI (7 males; mean age 69.15 years) were compared with 26 age-, gender-, handedness-, and education-matched older adults with normal cognition (NC; 7 males; mean age 68.87 years). All of the participants undertook an n-back task with a low (i.e., 0-back) and a high (i.e., 2-back) WM load condition while their prefrontal dynamics were recorded by a 16-channel NIRS system. Although behavioral results showed that the two groups had comparable task performance, neuroimaging results showed that the MCI group, unlike the NC group, did not exhibit significantly increased frontal activations bilaterally when WM load increased. Compared to the NC group, the MCI group had similar frontal activations at low load (p > 0.05 on all channels) but reduced activations at high load (p < 0.05 on 4 channels), thus failing to demonstrate WM-related frontal activations (p < 0.05 on 9 channels). In addition, we found a positive correlation between the left WM-related frontal activations and WM ability primarily in the NC group (rs = 0.42, p = 0.035), suggesting a relationship between frontal hypoactivation and WM difficulties. The present findings suggest the presence of frontal dysfunction that is dependent on WM load in individuals with MCI. Â© 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.\n\nNeural priming in human frontal cortex: multiple forms of learning reduce demands on the prefrontal executive system.\n\nPubMed\n\nRace, Elizabeth A; Shanker, Shanti; Wagner, Anthony D\n\n2009-09-01\n\nPast experience is hypothesized to reduce computational demands in PFC by providing bottom-up predictive information that informs subsequent stimulus-action mapping. The present fMRI study measured cortical activity reductions (\"neural priming\"/\"repetition suppression\") during repeated stimulus classification to investigate the mechanisms through which learning from the past decreases demands on the prefrontal executive system. Manipulation of learning at three levels of representation-stimulus, decision, and response-revealed dissociable neural priming effects in distinct frontotemporal regions, supporting a multiprocess model of neural priming. Critically, three distinct patterns of neural priming were identified in lateral frontal cortex, indicating that frontal computational demands are reduced by three forms of learning: (a) cortical tuning of stimulus-specific representations, (b) retrieval of learned stimulus-decision mappings, and (c) retrieval of learned stimulus-response mappings. The topographic distribution of these neural priming effects suggests a rostrocaudal organization of executive function in lateral frontal cortex.\n\nObesity and thermogenesis related to the consumption of caffeine, ephedrine, capsaicin, and green tea.\n\nPubMed\n\nDiepvens, Kristel; Westerterp, Klaas R; Westerterp-Plantenga, Margriet S\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe global prevalence of obesity has increased considerably in the last decade. Tools for obesity management, including caffeine, ephedrine, capsaicin, and green tea have been proposed as strategies for weight loss and weight maintenance, since they may increase energy expenditure and have been proposed to counteract the decrease in metabolic rate that is present during weight loss. A combination of caffeine and ephedrine has shown to be effective in long-term weight management, likely due to different mechanisms that may operate synergistically, e.g., respectively inhibiting the phosphodiesterase-induced degradation of cAMP and enhancing the sympathetic release of catecholamines. However, adverse effects of ephedrine prevent the feasibility of this approach. Capsaicin has been shown to be effective, yet when it is used clinically it requires a strong compliance to a certain dosage, that has not been shown to be feasible yet. Also positive effects on body-weight management have been shown using green tea mixtures. Green tea, by containing both tea catechins and caffeine, may act through inhibition of catechol O-methyl-transferase, and inhibition of phosphodiesterase. Here, the mechanisms may also operate synergistically. In addition, tea catechins have antiangiogenic properties that may prevent development of overweight and obesity. Furthermore, the sympathetic nervous system is involved in the regulation of lipolysis, and the sympathetic innervation of white adipose tissue may play an important role in the regulation of total body fat in general.\n\nDevelopment of a sensor prepared by entrapment of MIP particles in electrosynthesised polymer films for electrochemical detection of ephedrine.\n\nPubMed\n\nMazzotta, E; Picca, R A; Malitesta, C; Piletsky, S A; Piletska, E V\n\n2008-02-28\n\nA voltammetric sensor for (-)-ephedrine has been prepared by a novel approach based on immobilisation of an imprinted polymer for ephedrine (MIPE) in an electrosynthesised polypyrrole (PPY) film. Composite films were grown potentiostatically at 1.0 V vs. Pt (QRE) on a glassy carbon electrode using an unconventional \"upside-down\" (UD) geometry for the three-electrode cell. As a consequence, a high MIP loading was obtained, as revealed by SEM. The sensor response was evaluated, after overoxidation of PPY matrix, by cyclic voltammetry after pre-concentration in a buffered solution of analyte in 0.5-3 mM concentration range. An ephedrine peak at approximately 0.9 V increasing with concentration and saturating at high concentrations was evident. PPY-modified electrode showed a response, which was distinctly lower than the MIP response for the same concentration of the template. The effect of potential interferences including compounds usually found in human fluids (ascorbic acid, uric acid, urea, glucose, sorbitol, glycine, dopamine) was examined.\n\nDetermination of L-ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and caffeine in rat plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.\n\nPubMed\n\nCooper, Stephen D; Fletcher, Brenda L; Silinski, Melanie A Rehder; Brown, Sherri S; Lodge, Jon W; Fernando, Reshan A; Collins, Bradley J\n\n2011-07-01\n\nA rapid and simple liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of L-ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and caffeine in male Fisher-344 rat plasma at nanogram-per-milliliter concentrations for use in support of toxicology studies. Only 25 Î¼L of plasma is required, and extraction is performed using a simple, single-step protein precipitation. The method was validated over a range of 2.09 to 5460 ng/mL for L-ephedrine, 2.09 to 5050 ng/mL for pseudoephedrine and 2.03 to 5340 ng/mL for caffeine. A binary gradient elution at 0.3 mL/min was used with a Waters XBridge Phenyl (2.1 Ã 150 mm, 3.5 Î¼m) column and a Waters XBridge Phenyl 2.1- Ã 10-mm guard column at ambient temperature. The mobile phase consisted of 10 mM ammonium acetate in water (pH 5.0) and methanol. Caffeine trimethyl-(13)C(3) was used as the internal standard. The method was evaluated for linearity, recovery, precision, accuracy, and stability, and it was successfully applied in toxicokinetic studies of ephedrine, administered alone, in combination with caffeine, and in the herbal source Ma Huang.\n\n[Analysis of the preferred conformations and determination of the concentrations of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine based on hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction].\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Xuan; Bai, Xiaohong; Wang, Xiao; Wang, Jing; Bu, Wei\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe preferred conformations of the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in Ephedra sinica Stapf and rat urine were analyzed by the hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME) and their extraction mechanisms were illuminated. The method of the separation of the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine and the determination of their concentrations with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were established. The optimal experimental conditions were as follows: the organic phase carrier was the hollow fiber of polyvinylidene fluoride (MOF-503), organic solvent was n-hexanol, the extraction time was 35 min, the stirring rate was 1200 r/min, the sample phase was the NaOH solution (5 mol/L) of the analyte, the acceptor was 0.01 mol/L H2SO4 solution. The extracts were analyzed by HPLC. Under the optimal conditions, the method is convenient and highly sensitive. In Ephedra sinica Stapf, the linear ranges of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine were 5-100 microg/L, the detection limits were 1.9 microg/L and 1.2 microg/L and the enrichment factors were 38 and 61, respectively. The average recoveries of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine were 100.6% +/- 1.2% and 103.2% +/- 3.5%, respectively. In rat urine, their linear ranges were 100 - 5 x 10(4) microg/L, the detection limits were 30 microg/L and 42 microg/L and the enrichment factors were 20 and 17, respectively. In rat urine, their average recoveries were 108.4% +/- 4.4% and 106. 1% +/- 5.4%, respectively. The obtained results indicated that the method can be successfully applied for the extraction and determination of the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in Ephedra sinica Stapf and rat urine.\n\nComplicated hypertension related to the abuse of ephedrine and caffeine alkaloids.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerman, Jeffrey A; Setty, Arathi; Steiner, Matthew J; Kaufman, Kenneth R; Skotzko, Christine\n\n2006-01-01\n\nEphedra containing products (ECPs), which most often contain additional sources of caffeine alkaloids, may be an under-recognized cause of hypertension.

Little is known about the influence of seat belts and airbags on the incidence of thoracic aortic injury (TAI). The National Automotive Sampling System database was queried for the years 1993 to 1998 to determine the impact of seat belts and airbags on the incidence of TAI in survivors of frontal motor vehicle crashes. Proportions were compared using the two-sample Z test. Seat belts prevent TAI regardless of airbag deployment. The effect of airbags is limited to those wearing seat belts. In frontal collisions without seat belt use, airbag deployment does not alter TAI incidence. Seat belts are considerably more effective in preventing TAI than airbags after frontal motor vehicle crashes. Prevention efforts should continue to emphasize the use of active restraints. Restraint use should be considered a risk factor in evaluating patients for potential TAI.\n\nEphedrine hydrochloride protects mice from staphylococcus aureus-induced peritonitis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHe, Weigang; Ma, Jinzhu; Chen, Yijian; Jiang, Xinru; Wang, Yuli; Shi, Ting; Zhang, Qingwen; Yang, Yang; Jiang, Xin; Yin, Shulei; Zheng, Aoxiang; Lu, Jie; Zheng, Yuejuan\n\n2018-01-01\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive (G+) bacterium that causes a wide range of diseases in humans and livestock. Therefore, the development of innovative and effective therapies is essential for the treatment of S. aureus-induced severe infections. Ephedrine hydrochloride (EH) is a compound derived from ephedrine and is widely used for the management of cardiovascular diseases and hypotension. The results of our previous studies demonstrated that EH has anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages and protects against endotoxic shock. However, whether EH regulates the function of dendritic cells (DCs) and the immune response in S. aureus-induced infection is unknown. In this study, the anti-inflammatory and regulatory activity of EH on DCs was evaluated. EH increased the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and decreased the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-Î± and IL-12 in DCs stimulated with peptidoglycan (PGN), the main cell wall component in G+ bacteria. The PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK signaling pathways controlled EH-induced IL-10 expression and EH-inhibited TNF-Î± expression, respectively. The PGN-induced expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC class II molecule Iab was down-regulated in DCs by EH. Furthermore, EH protected the liver and kidney and increased the survival rate of mice with S. aureus-induced peritonitis. In conclusion, EH helps to keep immune homeostasis and alleviate organ damage during S. aureus-induced peritonitis. Therefore, EH may be a promising drug candidate in the treatment of S. aureus-induced severe infections and other invasive G+ bacterial infections.

Phenylephrine results in higher umbilical artery pH than ephedrine when used to prevent or treat hypotension in healthy women. We hypothesized that phenylephrine compared to ephedrine would result in higher umbilical artery pH in women with preeclampsia undergoing cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia. This study was a randomized double-blind clinical trial. Nonlaboring women with preeclampsia scheduled for cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia at Prentice Women's Hospital of Northwestern Medicine were randomized to receive prophylactic infusions of phenylephrine or ephedrine titrated to maintain systolic blood pressure >80% of baseline. Spinal anesthesia consisted of hyperbaric 0.75% bupivacaine 12 mg, fentanyl 15 Âµg, and morphine 150 Âµg. The primary outcome was umbilical arterial blood pH and the secondary outcome was umbilical artery base excess. One hundred ten women were enrolled in the study and 54 per group were included in the analysis. There were 74 and 72 infants delivered in the ephedrine and phenylephrine groups, respectively. The phenylephrine:ephedrine ratio for umbilical artery pH was 1.002 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.997-1.007). Mean [standard deviation] umbilical artery pH was not different between the ephedrine 7.20 [0.10] and phenylephrine 7.22 [0.07] groups (mean difference -0.02, 95% CI of the difference -0.06 to 0.07; P = .38). Median (first, third quartiles) umbilical artery base excess was -3.4 mEq/L (-5.7 to -2.0 mEq/L) in the ephedrine group and -2.8 mEq/L (-4.6 to -2.2mEq/L) in the phenylephrine group (difference -0.6 mEq/L, 95% CI of the difference -1.6 to 0.3 mEq/L; P = .10).

The separation was performed on a fused silica capillary of 60 cm x 55 microcrpm ID (52 cm of effective length). 60 mmol/L NaB4O7 + 10% (V/V) CH3OH (pH 9.0) was selected as the running buffer. The separation voltage was 12 kV. The samples was injected by gravity (10 s, 15 cm). The detection wavelength was 210 nm and berberine hydrochloride was the internal standard. The linear range of determination for ephedrine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and methylephedrine hydrochloride were 20.0-160.0 microg/mL (r = 0.9999), 7.5-60.0 microg/mL (r = 0.9991) and 2.0-10.0 microg/mL (r = 0.9993). The average recoveries were 98.0%, 97.0% and 97.8%, the precisions of the method were 2.31%, 2.21% and 2.00% (n=6), respectively. The method is convenient, rapid and accurate for the quality control of maxingshigan decoction.\n\n76 FR 56809 - Proposed Assessment of Annual Needs for the List I Chemicals Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, and...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-09-14\n\n....

Currently it is assumed that these difficulties might have neurobiological correlates in alterations in activation as well as in connectivity in and between regions of the social perception network suggested to govern the processing of social cues. In this study, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based activation and connectivity analyses focusing on face-, voice-, and audiovisual-processing brain regions as the most important subareas of the social perception network. Results revealed alterations in connectivity among regions involved in the processing of social stimuli in ASD subjects compared to typically developed (TD) controls-specifically, a reduced connectivity between the left temporal voice area (TVA) and the superior and medial frontal gyrus. Alterations in connectivity, moreover, were correlated with the severity of autistic traits: correlation analysis indicated that the connectivity between the left TVA and the limbic lobe, anterior cingulate and the medial frontal gyrus as well as between the right TVA and the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate, limbic lobe and the caudate decreased with increasing symptom severity. As these frontal regions are understood to play an important role in interpreting and mentalizing social signals, the observed underconnectivity might be construed as playing a role in social impairments in ASD.\n\nElimination of exemptions for chemical mixtures containing the list I chemicals ephedrine and/or pseudoephedrine. Final rule.\n\nPubMed\n\n2008-07-10\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is finalizing, without change, the Interim Rule with Request for Comment published in the Federal Register on July 25, 2007 (72 FR 40738). The Interim Rule removed the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) exemptions for chemical mixtures containing ephedrine and/or pseudoephedrine with concentration limits at or below five percent. Upon the effective date of the Interim Rule, all ephedrine and pseudoephedrine chemical mixtures, regardless of concentration and form, became subject to the regulatory provisions of the CSA. DEA regulated the importation, exportation, manufacture, and distribution of these chemical mixtures by requiring persons who handle these chemical mixtures to register with DEA, maintain certain records common to business practice, and file certain reports, regarding these chemical mixtures. No comments to the Interim Rule were received. This Final Rule finalizes the Interim Rule without change.\n\nThe effects of ginseng, ephedrine, and caffeine on cognitive performance, mood and energy.\n\nPubMed\n\nLieberman, H R\n\n2001-04-01\n\nA variety of claims regarding the purported energy-enhancing properties of nutritional supplements and food constituents have recently been made. It appears that the supplements most frequently associated with such assertions are ginseng, ephedrine, and caffeine. Claims of increased energy are difficult to evaluate objectively because their meaning is not usually defined or specified. Often it is not clear whether the claims refer to physical or mental energy or both. Furthermore, an agreed upon scientific definition of either physical or mental energy enhancement does not exist. In spite of obvious differences in what the term physical energy, as opposed to mental energy implies, there is no clear scientific consensus on whether there is a difference between the two types of energy. Because the substances in question have been anecdotally associated with improvements in both physical and mental performance, their effects on both functions will be discussed, but with an emphasis placed on cognitive function and mood. Of the three substances discussed, caffeine's effects on cognitive and physical function, mood, and energy are best understood. It is clear that this food/drug enhances these functions when administered in moderate doses. Ephedrine may also enhance certain physical and mental functions related to \"energy,\" but the evidence that ginseng has such properties is exceedingly weak.\n\nReduced N-acetylaspartate levels in the frontal cortex of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (Ecstasy) users: preliminary results.\n\nPubMed\n\nReneman, Liesbeth; Majoie, Charles B L M; Flick, Herman; den Heeten, Gerard J\n\n2002-02-01\n\nThe perceived safety of the recreational drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or Ecstasy, conflicts with animal evidence indicating that MDMA damages cortical serotonin (5-HT) neurons at doses similar to those used by humans. Few data are available about the effects of MDMA on the human brain. This study was designed to evaluate MDMA-related alterations in metabolite ratios with single-voxel proton ((1)H) MR spectroscopy. Fifteen male MDMA users (mean lifetime exposure, 723 tablets; mean time since last tablet, 12.0 weeks) and 12 age-matched control subjects underwent single-voxel (1)H MR spectroscopy. N-Acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), NAA/Choline (Cho), and myoinositol (MI)/Cr ratios were measured in midfrontal gray matter, midoccipital gray matter, and right parietal white matter. Data were analyzed with linear model-based multivariate analysis of variance. NAA/Cr (P =.04) and NAA/Cho (P =.03) ratios, markers associated with neuronal loss or dysfunction, were reduced in the frontal cortex of MDMA users. Neither NAA/Cr (P =.72) nor NAA/Cho (P =.12) ratios were different between both groups in occipital gray matter and parietal white matter (P =.18). Extent of previous MDMA use and frontal cortical NAA/Cr (rho = -.50, P =.012) or NAA/Cho (rho = -.550, P <.01) ratios were significantly associated. Reduced NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios at (1)H MR spectroscopy provide evidence for neuronal abnormality in the frontal cortex of M"
