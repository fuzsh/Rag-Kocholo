        "text": "Amanda Joy Michalka ( mee-SHAH-kah; born April 10, 1991), often credited as simply AJ, is an American actress, singer-songwriter, and musician. She was a model before becoming an actress, and is best known as one-half of the duo Aly and AJ (formerly 78Violet) with her sister Aly Michalka. AJ recorded the theme song and accompanying music video for the film Secretariat, entitled \"It's Who You Are.\" She also issued a single and video called \"All I've Ever Needed\" from her 2013 film Grace Unplugged. She has also had a successful acting career, and after two seasons in a recurring role as Lainey Lewis on the ABC sitcom The Goldbergs, she had been promoted to a regular role on the series for the third season but was demoted to recurring status for the fifth season as her character went to college and thus was in less storylines. She is set to star with her Goldbergs colleagues Tim Meadows and Bryan Callen in an untitled spin-off of that program for air in the 2018-19 U.S. television season."
