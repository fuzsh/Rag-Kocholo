Have an account? .\n\nSome child star siblings continue to act or perform together, like Elle and Dakota Fanning.\n\nOthers gave up acting altogether, like fashion moguls Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.\n\nDylan and Cole Sprouse, who turn 30 on August 4, both returned to acting after taking a break.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFred and Ben Savage played brothers in \"Little Monsters\" in 1989.\n\nFred played Brian, the older brother who became friends with a \"monster\" who was under his bed playing tricks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth brothers still act, and Fred also works as a director.\n\nBen rose to fame on \"Boy Meets World\" and will return for its spinoff, \"Girl Meets World.\" He also recently appeared in the Hallmark movie \"Love, Lights, Hanukkah!\"\n\nFred, who starred of \"The Wonder Years\" in the late '80s and early '90s, has lent his voice to shows like \"Family Guy\" and \"American Dad!' and has also directed episodes of \"Blackish,\" \"The Conners,\" and \"Modern Family.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwins Dylan and Cole Sprouse appeared in \"Grace Under Fire\" and \"Big Daddy\" before landing their breakout roles as stars of \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.\"\n\nThe Sprouse twins played Tipton Hotel residents Zack and Cody Martin on the Disney Channel sitcom from 2005 to 2008, and the subsequent spin-off \"The Suite Life on Deck\" from 2008 to 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a brief break from acting to attend New York University, the Sprouse twins are back to acting in TV shows and films.\n\nCole appeared in 2019's \"Five Feet Apart,\" and he currently plays Jughead Jones on The CW's hit drama \"Riverdale,\" a recurring role he's had since 2017. He also starred in the horror podcast \"Borrasca\" in 2020.\n\nDylan returned to the screen for 2017's indie \"Dismissed\" and, in his biggest role since his hiatus, he appeared in last year's \"After We Collided\" as Trevor. He has also appeared in two music videos: Camila Cabello's \"Consequences\" and Ygo's \"Think About You.\" But he's branched out to other industries too: He opened the All-Wise Meadery in Brooklyn, New York, with two business partners in 2018, and he started releasing a comic book in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMackenzie and Maddie Ziegler rose to fame on Lifetime's \"Dance Moms.\"\n\nThe Zieglers appeared on \"Dance Moms\" from 2011 to 2016. The reality show followed their training and careers in competitive dance and showbusiness, and the dynamics between the dancers, their mothers, and Abby Lee Dance Company owner Abby Lee Miller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaddie toured with Sia after appearing in several of her music videos and now works as an actress, and Mackenzie became a pop singer and influencer.\n\nIn a casting decision that was criticized by autism rights activists, Maddie just starred in \"Music\" as a non-verbal girl on the autism disorder spectrum. She will also portray Velma in the upcoming film remake of \"West Side Story.\"\n\nMackenzie released her second album, \"Phases,\" in 2018, and was just unmasked as the Tulip on series one of \"The Masked Dancer.\"\n\nBoth have garnered millions of YouTube subscribers and Instagram and TikTok followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs young actors, Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal appeared in several projects together.\n\nIn 1993, the siblings first appeared in \"A Dangerous Woman,\" which their father, Stephen, directed.
