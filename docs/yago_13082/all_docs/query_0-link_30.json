Aside from Colin giving Barry a chaste peck on the forehead in 1987, EastEnders screened the first mouth-to-mouth gay soap kiss in the UK in 1989 (Colin and Guido), leading some MPs to call for the programme to be banned.[26] EastEnders' first regular lesbian characters provided the soap with its first lesbian kiss in 1994, provoking more complaints than any other UK television programme that year.[27] This was followed by a \"censored\" kiss between Tony and Simon in 1996, which infuriated gay activists after the BBC cut the kiss from its original two seconds to a half-second, so they would not \"startle\" viewers.[28][29] In 2007, a lesbian kiss between bisexual Sonia and lesbian Naomi prompted 211 complaints to the BBC,[30] and in 2008, a kiss between gay characters Christian and Lee prompted 145 complaints from viewers who were \"appalled by the display of homosexual kissing before the watershed [...] whilst young children are watching\". The BBC released a statement saying: \"We approach our portrayal of homosexual relationships in the same way as we do heterosexual relationships. In this instance, Christian is enjoying the first flush of romance and we've shown him being affectionate with his new boyfriend in the same way any couple would.\"[31] As of November 2011 there are now multiple gay characters on the show leading normal affectionate relationships and also now going into adoption.\n\n1984–1993 Santa Barbara NBC Channing Capwell, Jr. (1984, 1985, 1991)\n\nLindsay Smith (1985) Robert Brian Wilson\n\nJoel Bailey During his love-affair with Santana, Channing Junior maintained a relationship with Lindsay Smith, a friend he seems to have met at the time of his law studies.

Beth featured in the most famous Brookside storyline of all when she helped bury her father's body after her mother had killed him, however this character will be equally remembered for British television's first pre-watershed lesbian kiss.
