        "text": "This is something that always interests me, especially reactions, why the show did this, and if they followed through. For instance, from what I've read, Egoli treated their gay couple like old maids, so they seemed to try several times to break their characters away into some type of instant love with the opposite sex (one of them fell in love with a woman instantly, only for fan backlash to end the relationship...a few years later, the other half of the couple became an instant bisexual and the two split up, neither having any real stories with other men after this). Other shows, like Alles was Zahlt, had a popular gay couple and apparently had no qualms telling passionate gay stories, but still put one half of the couple into a heterosexual relationship with his best friend, Vanessa. Then there's Isidingo, which seemed to have these stories as cautionary tales (one gay character was grieving and tried to convince himself he could be happy with his best female friend; a few years later, another was high and depressed and a psychological mess and got into bed with a friend's niece, causing big headaches and apologies all around). Shortland Street apparently brought a gay character back last year, as bi, with no explanation, leading to fan anger.\n\nI have usually been able to find out details on stories for some of the better known soaps, but was wondering if you knew of any more obscure soaps that had this type of story about a gay character suddenly becoming bi or straight, how this was handled, if any change was acknowledged or if their past was just forgotten, how fans reacted, etc.\n\nI realize that the way gay men and lesbians are treated in these stories is often night and day.\n\nI think the main problem is that you can only do limited story telling with merely two gay (or lesbian) characters on the canvas, especially for half hour shows which tend to have casts consisting of 20 or even less people.\n\nSoaps tend to rotate couples a lot so usually one straight character is suddenly rewritten as being bisexual for the sake of storytelling. When the couple breaks up, one character goes back to being straight – if the couple doesn't leave the show together. At least that's what German soaps have been doing in the last 20 years.\n\nIf I remember correctly, there were only a few contract characters who were written as being completely gay or lesbian, i.e. they never had romances with members of the other sex:\n\nKati Fuchs (MH, 2003-2005)\n\nPhilip Krüger (GZSZ, 1997-2000)\n\nCarla von Lahnstein (VL, 2003-2009)\n\nStella Mann (VL, 2008-2009)\n\nCarsten Reimann (GZSZ, 2008-2010)\n\nNina Ryan (VL, 1999-2002)\n\nTom Seifert (VL, 1999-2003)\n\nVirgin (AudL, 2010-2012)\n\nBilli Vogt (MH, 1997-2002)\n\nRoman Wild (AWZ, 2006-2011)\n\nBisexual characters include:\n\nAnnalena Bergmann (MH, 1995-2010 -> paired with Billi)\n\nSusanne Brandner (VL, 1995-1997; 2005-2008 -> paired with Carla)\n\nLenny Cöster (GZSZ, 2007-2010 -> paired with Carsten)\n\nMarkus Fröhlich (VL, 1996-1997 -> paired with Gero)\n\nBine Kern (UU, 2011-present -> paired with Rebecca)\n\nChristian Mann (VL, 2006-present -> paired with Oliver)\n\nRebecca Mattern (UU, 1997-present -> paired with Bine)\n\nFabian Moreno (GZSZ, 1996-2000; 2003-2004 -> paired with Philip)\n\nHanna Novak (VL, 2002-2004 -> paired with Carla)\n\nSülo Özgentürk (MH, 1995-2010 -> paired with recurring character Mischa)\n\nDeniz Öztürk (AWZ, 2007-present -> paired with Roman)\n\nUlli Prozeski (VL, 1997-2001 -> paired with Tom)\n\nPaula Rapf (GZSZ, 2002-2009 -> paired with Franzi)\n\nFranzi Reuter (GZSZ, 2005-2008 -> paired with Paula)\n\nJule Roth (VL, 2000-2002 -> paired with Nina)\n\nSaskia Rother (GZSZ, 1993-1996 -> paired with recurring character Harumi)\n\nOliver Sabel (VL, 2000-2002; 2008-present -> paired with Tom and Christian)\n\nErika Sander (VL, 1997-2000 -> paired with Nina)\n\nCharlie Schneider (VL, 1995-present -> had an affair with Stella)\n\nGero von Sterneck (VL, 1995-1997; 1999 -> paired with Markus and other minor characters)\n\nAndrea Süßkind (MH, 1995-2005 -> paired with Billi and Kati)\n\nMost of these pairings were very popular with the audience, but usually they did not last that long. On the other hand, several pairings were very unpopular, for example Rebecca/Bine on UU, so that the storyline was dropped rather quickly. In some cases, even the actors disapproved of the developments of their characters.\n\nI don't think it was established that Roman and Annette had actually slept with each other since \"the act\" was never shown on screen and both characters couldn't remember what had happened during that night. One episode they got drunk together, and the next one they woke up in the nude next to each other. After that, the incident was never touched upon again. That was sometime in the fall of 2007, when Ingo was still with Annette's sister Lena and Roman was crazy about Deniz for the very first time.\n\nRoman also had a short fling with Axel in 2009 when Nina suspected Axel of being gay and asked Roman to seduce him. I think they kissed once and there was a scene where a naked Roman wanted Axel to massage him.\n\nI can't remember a gay or lesbian character suddenly being attracted to the opposite sex. Carla on VL was forced to marry Bernd von Beyenbach in 2004 because she was still in the closet, and of course, she came from an aristocratic family. But that was just a platonic marriage. Also on VL, Tom slept with Jule because she wanted to have a baby badly. On MH, Billi married a guy named Bogdan so that he could stay in the country. He eventually raped her and she got pregnant. Billi decided to get the baby and raised it together with her girlfriend Andrea.\n\nYes, Nikolaj was bisexual. His relationship with Micki didn't end well. Micki later found a great guy who he married and had a family with.\n\nI don't remember what happened with his father.\n\nI don't recall if a gay or lesbian character ever got together with the opposite sex. I do know there were a couple of bisexual characters. Like Sara on Vita Lögner. She started off dating women but ended up dating men.\n\nIn the clip with Pamela & Jackie above, Jackie was a married woman (to a man) and they had 2 children. She discovered she was gay, or at least lesbian when she fell for Pamela.\n\nMost if not all gay characters stayed gay on the Swedish soaps.\n\nWhy they died out? Well, seems to me it was the same reason why the American soaps started dying out and lost viewers year after year. A number of reasons. More shows and tv channels to watch, more competition, better competition (?!), soaps always were the ugly duckling to the \"more classy\" shows.\n\nLooks like Corrie is hinting at this with Marcus (gay character who until recently was just the boyfriend of the horrendous token Sean, who is nasty, selfish, bitter, insecure, awful). They broke up because Marcus wanted a child and Sean didn't. Marcus is dating a guy named Aidan, but his best friend Maria has feelings for him, and he may start returning them soon.\n\nI assume this will end in misery and as some lesson to gay men, but I wouldn't mind if they actually had a happy relationship. It does happen in real life, sometimes, and no gay man will get a story on Corrie anyway. The guy that plays Marcus is a good actor and deserves more to do. And I can forever say that Sean is so horrible he turns his boyfriends bi or straight. I would love getting to do that."
