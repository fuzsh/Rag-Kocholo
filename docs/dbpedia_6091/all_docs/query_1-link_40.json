        "text": "TLA Promotions Press Release 2006-5-9 / One of the west coasts most over looked hip-hop artists is rap artist Crooked I. He is well known for his lyrical flow and gangsta like persona among his large world wide fan base. He has been a staple on the west coast hip-hop and rap music scene for over 10 years.\n\nHis years of being in the hip-hop music game has left him with a trail of let downs and learning experiences that have just made him more committed and focused; not only as a rap artist but also as a businessman.\n\nRecently Crooked I left legendary L.A. based Death Row Records; a place he called home and repped for over 4 ½ years. His time spent on Death Row was a learning experience and his leaving Death Row Records seems to have opened many doors for this rap artist from Long Beach.\n\nThe business side of Crooked I is his L.A. based record label Dynasty Records and the hip-hop side of Crooked I is his talent as a rap artist.\n\nFans are watching every move Crooked I makes now as they eagerly await some of his long anticipated projects. A new mix tape, an album and the DVD ‘Life After Death Row’ are just some of the projects on Crooked I’s agenda.\n\nSince fans and the industry are watching and waiting, ThugLifeArmy.com had the chance to sit and ask ‘The Young Rap Boss’ from Long Beach about the time frame of these projects and many others that he has lined up in this ‘Exclusive’ interview."
