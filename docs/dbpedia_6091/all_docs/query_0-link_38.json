        "text": "About This Site\n\nWelcome to The Crooked Wanderer. This is a blog about music. I mostly deal with metal and rock, sometimes country or hip-hop and every so often mainly some other genre.\n\nI typically discuss albums and/or songs. I do occasionally veer off into pieces on issues or other things affecting the music community. Other oddball stuff pops up from time to time.\n\nPost Schedule\n\nI typically post on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Other posts come up from time to time on other days.\n\nMondays I have an Album of the Week feature, where I discuss an album. Wednesdays is a Song of the Week feature where, you guessed it, I talk about a song. I typically have a running deep dive series involving Iron Maiden going on Fridays, posts that come up on other days of the week can be about whatever.\n\nAbout Me\n\nMy name is Burch. I have been listening to music since the early 1980’s and teachers in high school told me I was decent at writing so that qualifies me as an expert in writing about music.\n\nMore seriously, I did blog in some form or another from 1998 through 2011. I decided to start up again in mid-2021 due to boredom, mid-life crisis, or whatever.\n\nOther than music, my interests include cycling, drinking IPAs and watching World War II documentaries.\n\nContact\n\nEmail– bigbadburch@crooked-wanderer.com"
