        "text": "R-Mean is a Los Angeles-born, Armenian-American rapper that's been turning heads lately. The former pharmacist, who obtained a Doctor of Pharmacy degree from Loma Linda University, is back with a new record titled \"Deeper Than Rap\" featuring Kxng Crooked (formerly known as Crooked I), which is produced by Pharomazan. The track is apart of R-Mean's Mean Mondays challenge in which he drops one song a week for the entire year. \"Deeper Than Rap\" is for week nine of 52.\n\n\"Rappers ain't got bars no more but got the coldest memes/I stab you with the shattered pieces of my broken dreams/I don't think when I'm spitting I squeeze the pen and my soul just bleeds - it bleeds within/You slipped up/I heard you made them big bucks,\" R-Mean raps.\n\nCrooked adds his own flair, \"Me and my team ball nigga, no salary cap/I'm so charged up the hood calls me battery back/You know Crooked cause a tragedy with the ratchet he pack/All that yackety-yack get your halfyour anatomy cracked/COB - that's where the families at/The right side of your brain couldn't imagine me wack/I'm on Coca-Cola Classic and yac.\"\n\nMean has made music with The Game, Joe Budden, and Too Short. In 2015 he dropped his 7 Deadly Sins album on Pentagon Records/Empire. In October 2016 he released Nas & Em tribute mixtape with Dj Base. Bump \"Deeper Than Rap\""
