        "text": "Crooked I's song \"Big Dreams\" is a powerful declaration of ambition, skill, and street credibility. The track opens with a series of announcements, setting the stage for the artist's grand vision and the projects he's involved in. This introduction serves to highlight Crooked I's connections and the collective effort of his crew, the Circle of Bosses (C.O.B.), emphasizing the collaborative nature of his journey in the hip-hop industry.\n\nIn the verse, Crooked I showcases his lyrical prowess and confidence. He compares himself to historical and mythical figures like Nostradamus and Romulus, suggesting his prophetic and dominant presence in the rap game. The lyrics are filled with metaphors and wordplay, illustrating his self-perception as a beast on the beats and a prophet in the sheets. He also references his Long Beach roots, aligning himself with the legacy of West Coast rap and asserting his place among the greats.\n\nThe song also touches on themes of authenticity and resilience. Crooked I criticizes contemporary rappers, suggesting they wouldn't have survived in the golden era of hip-hop alongside legends like Nas, Jay-Z, and Kool G Rap. He positions himself as a true heir to the throne of 2Pac, emphasizing his unique blend of lyrical skill and street smarts. The outro reinforces his commitment to his craft and his community, with a nod to his upcoming projects and a playful jab at political figures, further cementing his identity as a voice of the streets and a leader in the hip-hop world."
