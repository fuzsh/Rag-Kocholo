        "text": "Speaking of “Last Resort,” do you remember where you were physically when the Paul Ryan Twitter thing happened?\n\nOh, where was I? I think I was in the studio. Yes. I was in the studio. I remember that, because [my managers] Ian and Jerry were on Twitter or whatever, and saw that pop off, and we were like, “Oh, shit.”\n\nWhat do you think when that happens? What’s your initial reaction?\n\nI just had to laugh. You know? I just look at American politics right now, and it’s just a fuckin’ shitshow. It’s just, wow. It’s like Idiocracy. I don’t know if you’ve seen that movie.\n\nI see that a lot, people making that comparison.\n\nAnd I’m like, I’m conservative on some shit. I’m like Chris Rock when he said it: “I’m conservative on some shit, and liberal on some other shit.” You know what I mean? But it’s just, I don’t man, it just seems like monkeys throwin’ shit at each other.\n\nYeah, I really dig “American Dreams.” Is that inspired by any particular event or feeling? Pretty much everybody feels like they’re being lied to at this point.\n\nYeah. I was writing that during the presidential debates. When that was going down, I’m like, “I can’t even sit my kids down in front of the television and have ’em watch these two.” They seem like high schoolers. Like, bad high schoolers. I mean, hey, man, they’re both intelligent people. We know that. But unfortunately, it just devolved into this, bleaaaggh.\n\nAnd so the track, it deals with a lot of just American issues. Street crime. Hate crimes. War. The effects of war on people, on family. And through all of it, it just seems like a bunch of smoke and mirrors and lies that we’re trying to sift through to find the truth."
