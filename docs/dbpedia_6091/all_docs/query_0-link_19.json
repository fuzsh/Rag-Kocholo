        "text": "KXNG Crooked (AKA Crooked I) is one of Hip-Hop’s all-time most respected lyricists. Suge Knight once hailed him as the next Tupac Shakur, and years later Eminem signed his group Slaughterhouse (with Joe Budden, Royce da 5’9″, Joell Ortiz) to Shady Records. But that doesn’t even begin to explain Crooked’s foresight and brilliance. Crooked built one of Hip-Hop’s first online followings with the release of his Hip-Hop Weekly Series in 2007, releasing a new track every week for a year, and creating a trend that was later implemented by a number of successful artists. He has also continued to stay relevant by remaining innovative and taking frequent chances.\n\nThis is definitely one of the best episodes yet, as Crooked shares invaluable knowledge, and he even provides a blueprint for up and coming artists to follow when releasing an album. In addition to being an incredible MC, Crooked is a born leader, social activist, TV producer, and an overall great person.
