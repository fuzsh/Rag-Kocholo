This vibrant, high-energy Massachusetts band creates powerful, infectious songs that combine the best of punk, rock, reggae, hip hop, and pop. Their unique sound - which manages to be both nostalgic and fresh - transports you to an epic summer party, winning them a rabid fanbase and spots in some of the best festivals and venues around, including Boston Calling and Beach Road.\n\nRather than getting hung up on musical genres, Crooked Coast instead focuses on writing powerful lyrics, and melodies with undeniable hooks. The band’s ability to tell a story and connect with their audience speaks to their comfort with and promotion of both individualism and community. This connection, combined with their impressive energy and incredibly popular live shows, have secured them an ever-expanding tight-knit fan base.\n\nThe band blurs the line between music and visual art, self-producing music videos and designing their own line of merchandise. With Crooked Coast swag, you can take the party with you wherever you go.\n\nCrooked Coast’s 2020 single “Rise & Shine” debuted at #5 on the iTunes reggae charts, marking the beginning of their work with acclaimed producer/engineer Courtney Ballard (5 Seconds of Summer, Good Charlotte, The Used.) Their latest recording, Picture This, was released in 2022. In 2019, they produced and headlined their own music festival, Coast-Fest, selling out the Falmouth bandshell in their home of Cape Cod, MA.\n\nThe band blurs the line between music and visual art, self-producing music videos and graphic design, which they show off through their extensive line of merchandise.\n\n“The Bay State’s Crooked Coast has swept the region with extremely innovative shows and music for years. The Cape Cod band takes inspiration from classic rock, hip-hop, and reggae to create a vibrant, powerful sound that hits nostalgic notes while staying new.” —Dig Boston"
