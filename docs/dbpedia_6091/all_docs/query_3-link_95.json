        "text": "Two Slaughterhouse wordsmiths finish their six-album-long series with the latest and, arguably, hardest instalment.\n\nCrook and Joell started their creative journey as a rap duo uniting two coasts in 2020 with “H.A.R.D.”, continued in 2022 with the controversial “Rise & Fall of Slaughterhouse” that split a rap supergroup into two hostile camps, and proceeded the same year to cinematically rich “Harbor City Season One”. In 2023, they again released two projects: “JFKLAX” and “Prosper”. And now, the final chord in this complex music piece stretching through time and space is “Tapestry”.\n\nCrook announced the album’s arrival on his socials:\n\nIt’s the final project for me and Joell as a duo but it’s never over for our friendship and business partnerships! “Tapestry” the new album @ midnight! I hope you enjoy and thank you for joining us on this 6 project journey over the past 4 years!!Let us know your favorites when you hear it! H.A.R.D.\n\nJust as the title implies, the various threads come together on “Tapestry” to create an intricate picture that is both truthful, sometimes painfully, and beautiful. These two rap giants know that art is not a pretty picture. Art makes us look life in the eye without breaking contact and reflect on the meaning of what we see.\n\nLast year, KXNG Crooked asked his online audience what it would take for conscious hip hop to dominate mainstream rap. Maybe there is still no universal answer, but Crook and Joel do everything for it to capture the audience’s attention."
