After a flux of consistently artistic releases since 2018 we finally get the first official Jody Lo album and the overall project is FIRE. Flowing almost perfectly to each beat, the lyricism is phenomenally satisfying and the beat selection was actually pretty dope as well, both complimentary to one another. Album features verses from Dogg Poundâ€™s Kurupt, Kxng Crooked, Ras Kass & more.\n\nYou can check out the full project on any music streaming service"
