        "text": "The guardian on the West Coast hip hop fulfils the impossible task of being honest, sincere, and just when discussing a conflict between two rap giants.\n\nCrook stopped by On The Line Podcast and, among other topics, was prompted to share his opinion on the ongoing tension between Melle Mel and Eminem, which Em addressed on the ‚ÄúRealest‚Äù feature.\n\nMelle likes to get on all these different podcasts and talk shit. It was funny to me cause he‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄúThis motherfucker would be easy to destroy. That motherfucker ain‚Äôt shit‚Äù. I was like, okay, that‚Äôs just Melle Mel. Melle Mel wrote ‚ÄúThe Message‚Äù. His name, his contributions are in concrete when it comes to hip hop. He‚Äôs forever in the books. You can‚Äôt move that. I was talking to some of Eminem‚Äôs fans, they hit me up on Twitter sometimes, and they talk to me, and one of them was talking about Melle Mel, like, ‚ÄúHe just made a big mistake. He‚Äôs about to be erased from hip hop‚Äù. I‚Äôm like, are you crazy? That will never happen. I don‚Äôt care what kind of song my homeboy Marshall Mathers made. Melle is in concrete, his legacy is straight.\n\nWith that being said, I knew that there was not really a way that he could outclass Eminem lyrically. Not at this point of time. Em is one of the greatest wordsmiths to ever put words together into every rap. I already knew that was not gonna happen.\n\nThen, KXNG Crooked proceeded to explain the technical meaning behind some terms people often use unreflexively:\n\nSome people are going to tell their story in this way, and then some people are going to tell a story in that way. It might be the same story, but this person is telling it in a way that‚Äôs very easy to understand, and this person is making it a little more complex to understand. But they‚Äôre telling the same story. Rapping is not hip hop. Hip hop is the culture, and rapping is something that the culture produced. We just talk about rapping, we‚Äôre talking about rhyming words. If a person knows how to rhyme ten words in one sentence, but this dude only knows how to rhyme two words in one sentence ‚Äî this first dude over here is superior at rhyming words. The listener might not like to hear a nigga rhyme ten words in a sentence. But he‚Äôs still superior to this nigga when it comes to technical writing. I think what happens is a lot of the people who are listeners, they listen with a subjective ear. They say, ‚ÄúOkay, but I don‚Äôt like how that sounds‚Äù. And it‚Äôs okay. I could look at a painting and say, I don‚Äôt like that painting. But the technical skill that it took to create that? I understand that he‚Äôs more advanced than the person over here that might make a song that we all love. We‚Äôre not talking about what we like, we‚Äôre just talking about technical skills, writing tools, metaphors, punchlines, cadences, syllable rhyming, all these different tools that‚Äôs in the writer‚Äôs box.\n\nEminem has commanded great craftsmanship over the tools in the MC‚Äôs box. He has downloaded the art of rhyming. And he represents that. Melle is a pioneer who did the same thing in his day, and I would even say it was harder for Melle to get where he was at because he‚Äôs was an original thought. Like on the streets. When you are original, that‚Äôs different. He didn‚Äôt have nobody to build off. It came straight from him. Now, we all got him to look at and say, alright, that‚Äôs how you did your sixth floor, now I know I could do mine better ‚Äôcause I see how you did yours. We could build off of that.\n\nSo, there are two legends on the field, and Crook respects both. He and everyone in the game. The diss track Melle Mel shot at Eminem later? Crook was not impressed by it from the start. He let it out publicly with a short tweet:\n\nNot feeling it üòë\n\nOn the podcast, Crook expanded his assessment a little bit:\n\n[Melle Mel] made a diss song, and that diss song didn‚Äôt have the impact that he wanted to.\n\nThen KXNG Crooked said that he was disappointed to learn about the apology Melle Mel allegedly published. A competitive MC in him was not happy. The competitive MC in him shouldn‚Äôt be worried. The post with the text of this ‚Äúapology‚Äù was so much out of Melle Mel‚Äôs character and so short-lived that we must consider it either an ill-advised move from somebody from Melle Mel‚Äôs team or a vivid hallucination of those three people who had time to make screenshots and spread the news over the Internet. His Eminem diss is still up there on YouTube, so Melle Mel is clearly not apologetic about what he has done. At least, he is consistent in his beliefs.\n\nWatch the video below:"
