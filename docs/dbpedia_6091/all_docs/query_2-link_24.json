        "text": "“Her songs, singing and solos, much like her demeanor, tend to have an inward-looking elegance to them; they’re the outward expressions of a searching mind and a longtime dedication to cultivating her craft” – Jewly Hight, NPR\n\nOn her new album, City of Gold, Molly Tuttle — joined by her band Golden Highway — shares a batch of spellbinding stories that span time and place: wildly colorful fables populated by gold miners and fortune tellers, true-to-life tales of love and loss and a fast-changing world, and a reimagining of Alice in Wonderland set in the backwoods of Kentucky, to name just a few. The follow-up to 2022’s Crooked Tree—a widely lauded LP that won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album, with Tuttle earning a Best New Artist nomination—the Northern California-raised musician’s fourth full-length album brings those narratives to a resplendent form of bluegrass rooted in her virtuosic guitar playing. This time around, the Nashville-based singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist chose to record with her live band — Bronwyn Keith-Hynes (fiddle, vocals), Dominick Leslie (mandolin), Kyle Tuttle (banjo, vocals), and Shelby Means (bass, vocals) — for the first time, lending a potent new energy to her exquisitely crafted sound.\n\nMolly Tuttle Q&A and Acoustic Performance VIP Upgrade\n\nAccess to an exclusive pre-show experience including:\n\nPre-show acoustic set (2-3 songs)\n\nQ&A Session with Molly Tuttle\n\nPoster signed by Molly Tuttle\n\nMerchandise shopping opportunity prior to doors opening to the public\n\nEarly entry to the venue\n\nwith Special Guest, Harper O’Neill"
