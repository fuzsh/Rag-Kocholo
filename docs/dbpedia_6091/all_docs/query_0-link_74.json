        "text": "What Is Assonance In Rap\n\nYou want to know what assonance in rap is and after this article you will fully understand how simple it really is.\n\nFirst let’s start with the definition of assonance.\n\nI know I know, It may seem a bit confusing but I break down assonance in some raps for you below so don’t worry.\n\nBelow I will highlight the assonance in rap in a Eminem and Crooked I verse.\n\nI will only bold the parts that are the assonance in the rap.\n\nThere is more assonance than what I am going to bold on the Eminem verse but I’ll do the basic parts so it doesn’t get too confusing.\n\nOne Pattern will be in bold and the other pattern will be underlined.\n\nEminem – Patiently Waiting Verse Assonance In Rap Example\n\nThey think they’re crazy but they ain‘t crazy lets face it, shit basically\n\nThey just playing sick, they ain’t shit They ain‘t saying shit, spray ’em Fifty\n\nA to the K, get in the way I’ll bring Dre and them wit me\n\nAnd turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?\n\nNow what I want you to do to understand assonance in rap WAY easier is to simply re read that verse above real quick but\n\n1 ) ONLY READ THE BOLD PARTS OUT LOUD.\n\n2) Then ONLY READ THE UNDERLINED PARTS OUT LOUD\n\nThis is how the bold assonance sounds in each rap line above.\n\nCRA – AIN – CRA – FA – BA\n\nPLA – AIN – SA – SPRA\n\nA – K – WA – DRE\n\nDA – MAY – STA\n\nNotice how they all rhyme just using the sound of the vowel. That’s assonance in rap for you.\n\nRead it again really quick.\n\nThis is how the underlined assonance sounds in the rap above\n\nTHI – SHI\n\nSI – SHI – SHI – FIF\n\nWI\n\nWI\n\nNotice he uses the bold assonance as the primary sounds and then also built in the smaller amount as the additional impressive assonance in the song. This is a big reason why Eminem is such an impressive rapper.\n\nNow, don’t let me lose you I’m not trying to confuse you lol here is another example so you can grasp it easier.\n\nLet’s look at the assonance in this verse from Crooked I\n\nOn the real, it’s a wrap, how could you possibly stop the Apocalypse\n\nWhen I’m atomic bombing the populous\n\nShock the metropolis hostile as a kid popping the Glock at his moms\n\nAnd his pops then he hops in his drop with his iPod rocking his slaughterish\n\nYou can see that the VOWEL sounds on all of the O’s are what make the verse sound interesting.\n\nThe O’s sound like A’s in certain words when they are bent to make them sound like they rhyme\n\nLet’s break them down again so you can read them\n\nPOS – STO – APO\n\nATO – BOM – POP\n\nSHO – TRO – HOS – POP – GLO – MOM\n\nPOP – HOP – DRO – PO – ROC – SLAU\n\nI hope this is sticking with you. If you don’t get it now, you will get it later. The assonance in songs you write will just click and you’ll get what you’re doing instantly.\n\nIt’s really not that complicated.\n\nOnce you learn enough words and use them enough in your raps the assonance will go on auto pilot and writing the assonance in songs will become fun to go above and beyond and make.\n\nAnd when you write complete super sick verses that have a ton of assonance you’ll look like this if it’s hot enough.\n\nI can tell you from experience that this type of rhyming and bending and finding words that match vowel sounds will become incredibly easy to do after you are rapping for a long enough time.\n\nI do it on a consistent basis and didn’t even realize it because it became that automatic.\n\nYou’ll be bending words together just to create great lines with wordplay and suddenly go back and realize all of the assonance in your raps.\n\nSomeone who is really great at assonance in rap is my friend Passionate MC. He told me in his head he color codes how he puts together the words. I was really interested in that and I told him I would get an interview from him about it to put up here on Smart Rapper.\n\nBe on the look out for that in the future.\n\n– Rob Level\n\n[et_bloom_inline optin_id=optin_34]"
