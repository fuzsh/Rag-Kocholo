Regardless, Aoife O’Donovan’s sweeping vocals and the stunning fiddle accompaniment will almost assuredly send a couple chills up your spine, and it’s beyond worth a listen.\n\n(Side note: This is my favorite bluegrass tune of all time, and I started crying when I saw it live. Also, I bought and gave mint chocolate chip ice cream to the lead singer when she asked the audience for some, and that was kinda cool.)"
