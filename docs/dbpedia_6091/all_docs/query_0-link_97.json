        "text": "KXNG Crooked has shared a powerful new song called \"I Can't Breathe 2,\" in which the Slaughterhouse rapper addresses the subject of police brutality. With disturbing new video footage surfacing almost every day, it's no surprise that Crooked took to venting on wax. The track features the 2Pac instrumental \"Pain,\" a fitting choice considering some of the issues Pac had with police.\n\nCrooked seems depressed on this one, sounding morose in place of his usual high-octane delivery. It goes to show how deep this issue has gone, with people are afraid of those who are supposed to protect them. Dark times, indeed.\n\nCause they could take Crook's life\n\nRight on Facebook Live\n\nAnd just acquit the cop who did it\n\nNot even his pension got suspended"
