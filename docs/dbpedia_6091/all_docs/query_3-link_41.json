        "text": "On November 16th, 2018, Signature Sounds re-issued Crooked Still's acclaimed album, Shaken By A Low Sound on deluxe vinyl. Originally released digitally and on CD in 2006, the album cemented Crooked Still's reputation as one of the premiere alternative bluegrass groups of the mid-aughts, shattering preconceptions of how traditional music was played. Shaken By a Low Sound received rave reviews from publications like Interview Magazine, No Depression, and USA Today proclaiming, “Aoife O’Donovan. Remember that name, because with a sultry voice that makes her sound like a bluesier Alison Krauss, she’s about to become the newest darling of the Americana set... Shaken is stirring.” The LP package includes a bonus CD of a previously unreleased Crooked Still set from The Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival in 2006.\n\nCrooked Still’s history goes back to 2001 when Aoife O’Donovan (currently 1/3 of the supergroup, I'm With Her whose harmonies the New York Timesdescribes as, “could be sweetly ethereal, or as tightly in tandem as country sibling teams like the Everly Brothers, or as hearty as mountain gospel...” and Corey DiMario were classmates at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. Rushad Eggleston, who attended nearby Berklee College of Music and Greg Liszt, who has earned a doctorate in biology from MIT, soon joined up.\n\nThe quartet quickly built a loyal following in Boston-area clubs, grabbing rave reviews from local newspapers and magazines. It wasn’t long before they found their way to the festival circuit, drawing invitations to play huge events like the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival and the historic Newport Folk Festival. The band’s reputation grew as equal parts ambassador and innovators- a defiantly non-traditional bluegrass quintet known for their high energy, technical skill, unusual instrumentation, and innovative acoustic style.\n\nIn Crooked Still's world, rock energy coexists with old-time mountain soul. Spooky backwoods melodies combine with hard-hitting beats. And raw, searing blues riffs intermingle with high heavenly vocals. It’s easy to see why The Boston Globe raved that Crooked Still is “the most important folk group to emerge from Boston since the early 60’s.”"
