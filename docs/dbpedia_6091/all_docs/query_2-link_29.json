        "text": "Jeanette Williams has become one of the most successful and celebrated women in bluegrass music. Her list of awards, accolades, and career highlights continues to grow — as does her adoring fan base from coast to coast and internationally — with her powerful songs, angelic voice, and warm, sincere personality. Touring, recording, and industry awards have become a mainstay for Williams. She also plays bass with the band. Williams has accumulated more than 17 SPBGMA nominations through 2021, including three wins for Female Vocalist of the Year (2009, 2012 and 2013); two IBMA awards (2006 and 2009 Recorded Event of the Year with the Daughters Of Bluegrass); two songwriting awards (2007 Chris Austin Songwriting Contest at MerleFest, 2008 IAMA Songwriting Contest); and over 32 years of performance experience in bluegrass and bluegrass gospel. She is expanding her repertoire to include her early influences of classic country, blues, roots, and rock.\n\nDanny Paisley and the Southern Grass continues to be deeply rooted in tradition but looks to the future with enthusiasm and anticipation. The group’s latest release, Bluegrass Troubadour, was nominated for IBMA’s Album of the Year and earned significant chart action, with the song Blink of an Eye spending several months at the number one spot on the Bluegrass music charts — it was also nominated for IBMA's Song of the Year.\n\nDanny Paisley and the Southern Grass plays powerful, unadorned, and intense traditional bluegrass. There is no hybrid or genre-bending music here. The combination of instrumentation and vocals conveys the energy and emotion of classic bluegrass and country music. Paisley’s lead vocals will captivate your senses, so much so that many prominent musicians, including Alison Krauss, have considered him one of their favorite singers. His voice combines powerful range and soulful blues with a sound like no one else in bluegrass today.\n\nSince Danny’s father, Bob Paisley (founder of Southern Grass), passed away in 2004, Danny Paisley and the Southern Grass has made its niche in the bluegrass world, producing consecutive chart-topping albums. The group has received over 20 Bluegrass Music Award nominations and won the 2009 IBMA Song of the Year for Don’t Throw Mama’s Flowers Away. In 2021, Danny Paisley joined an elite group of vocalists to be awarded the IBMA Male Vocalist of the Year for the third time — an achievement bestowed only to five others in Bluegrass music history.\n\nWith Paisley on guitar, Southern Grass continues the family tradition by adding Paisley’s son, Ryan, on mandolin — part of the next generation of up-and-coming pickers. Southern Grass continues the rich musical heritage started by Bob Paisley and Ted Lundy with Lundy’s sons, T.J. (fiddle) and Bobby (bass and vocals). T.J. Lundy is a highly respected fiddler, bridging the gap between old-time fiddling and bluegrass music. Bobby Lundy is also a renowned multi-instrumentalist who has gained attention for his unique bass style. Southern Grass also includes Dean Phillips on banjo.\n\nDanny Paisley, born in Landenberg, Pennsylvania, in 1959, grew up listening to the music his father Bob played and enjoyed hearing the sounds of classic bluegrass like Red Allen, Mac Martin, Bill Monroe, the Stanleys, Reno and Smiley, and the Osbornes, as well as old-time mountain music and traditional country music. Once you hear Paisley sing, it is no surprise that he lists George Jones and Vern Gosdin as major influences.\n\nDanny Paisley and the Southern Grass continues to carry on a legacy set forth over six decades ago, gathering fans at each event; the group looks forward with renewed energy as it bring its unique sound to audiences near and far."
