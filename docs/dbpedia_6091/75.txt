This week’s independent spot light is focused on a highly acclaimed hip hop artist is from one of the best cities in Southern California. Dominick Wickliffe who’s stage name is Crooked I was born in Long Beach, California and is a member of hip hop super group Slaughter House.

The hip hop artist began his career at the young age of 17 when he and two other Long Beach native professional football players Chucky Miller and Leonard Russell started their own record label called Muscle Records. It was then that Crooked I caught the attention of Virgin records and was signed in 1995. This was just the beginning of all the success the rapper would obtain through his music.

Crooked I is originally known for his collaborations with Snoop Doggy Dog, The Eastsidaz and the Luniz, he was also featured on soundtracks such as Ride and Caught Up. When he and Virgin split the rapper later went on with DPG records which is a sub-label of Death Row Records. In 2004 Crooked I left Death Row to start his own record label Dynasty Entertainment.

In 2009 rapper Joe Budden reached out to the hip hop artist and formed the group Slaughter House through the reception of a track released by him Joe Budden, Royce da 5’9” and Joell Ortiz. Since then the super group has had much success. Crooked I is known for his lyricism and dynamic beats. He has managed to stay true to his Long Beach roots and in 2009 released a single titled “Long Beach Wanna Rock”. Long Beach natives such as myself are proud of the hip hop artist and appreciate the love he gives to the best city in the world the LBC.
