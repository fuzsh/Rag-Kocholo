One of the treatments is a common prescription pharmaceutical; the other is bee venom. While we all know that wikipedia doesn't give medical advice, I'm worried that someone with access to another person's pharmaceuticals will try it. The pharmaceutical can be dangerous. I'm also worried that someone may decide to use bee venom on themselves or another person without knowing if they are allergic, thus precipitating anaphylactic shock. Obviously, these risks should be mentioned in a well written summary, but there is no valid evidence that these treatments even work so no valid risk assessment. I'm trying not to be a jerk, but I'm very worried that someone will get killed over this. Rknight (talk)\n\nI see valid arguments on all sides. Great caution should be exercised when including treatments on pages about anatomy or medicine. All possible sources should be quoted for balance and caveats. That said, I'm not a medic, and I suggest you both agree to make a request for opinion at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine where other mediacally qualified editors may offer some suggestions. --Kudpung กุดผึ้ง (talk)\n\nHi its VeryVery20 here from the scar page. I'm the one Rknight is talking about I think. He (RKnight) is trying to associate bee venom with ace inhibitors in order to discredit ace inhibitors, if you look carefully IMO it is clear he is trying to suppress the Ace Inhibitor bit by associating it with the bee venom bit.\n\nNow if you look again you can see there is nothing at all dangerous with regards to the Ace Inhibitor bit IMO. Here is what I've wrote on the talk page people:\n\nRk Knight is IMO trying hide information about Ace inhibitors in the scar article... Here is the recent piece he(Rknight) has pulled out people:\n\nACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.[1] The increase of angiotensin II increases expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and myofibroblast proliferation.[2] (<<-- BTW if you read the article myofibroblast proliferation is implicated in scarring)\n\nAn Ace inhibitor Enalapril at a low dose,[3] over a set period, has been shown inhibit to resolve hypertrophic scarring completely[4] and reduce keloid scarring.[4][3] Another ace inhibitor, a 5% Captopril solution has also been shown to reduce the fibrotic tissue in keloids.[5] An ace inhibitor called Losartan has reversed fibrosis in end stage liver disease in a small study.[6] Another major independent study across Europe is underway.'''''\n\nAce inhibitors inhibit, suppress or kill myofibroblast activity.\n\nHe has also accused me of putting undue weight and not of using independant sources.\n\nSERIOUSLY 1. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THERE THAT HAS UNDUE WEIGHT?\n\n2. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THERE THAT DOESN'T HAVE INDEPENDANT SOURCES.\n\n3. ALSO AS THERE IS NO UNDUE WEIGHT, IS THERE ANYTHING IN THEIR THAT IS DANGEROUS?\n\n4. WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO ATTACH THIS TO THE BEE VENOM PIECE (WHICH IMO IS EQUALLY VALID, BUT I CAN SEE SOME IGNORANT PEOPLE MIGHT KNEE JERK AT IT) As you can see the cites are correct and valid and it is probably one of the safest written pieces in the article.\n\nSo why are you trying to suppress rthis using inaccurate finger pointing with association RKnight?\n\nI'm not at all happy about this.\n\nBTW regarding the above I know it looks like I'm shouting but I'm not (just regard thos as highlighting, I need the attention here because he is continuing to point and he is ignoring this), I just want this addressed. It seems he is pointing the finger and not correctly addressing the concerns about this finger pointing.--Veryvery20 (talk) 11:04, 11 April 2011 (UTC)--Veryvery20 (talk)\n\nJust a note, the part that you didn't put in bold/caps lock was the first part I read. I understand if you believe you need the attention, but a clear, concise, well thought out statement will get more attention than what would be assumed a bold/caps lock ridden comment. Contrary to what you might think, an entire section in caps lock is more likely to be ignored than read. With that said, I highly doubt he was trying to supress the information; if that were the case Editor assistance would not have been the place to go. ;) I think he just wants to make sure that the information adheres to Wikipedia's guidelines, and you want to make sure the information is accurate and available, and there's nothing wrong with either one. Don't look at it as him attacking you or trying to supress information (as I doubt that is the case), neither of you are wrong, you just believe differently on how this article should be presented. If you could, I would kindly ask that you un-caps lock and un-bold your comments, as it is a bit unwieldy to the eye. :) - SudoGhost (talk)\n\nSudoGhost, I wasn't the one who brought the complaint up, my idea was to discuss this on the talk page and then reedit with a compromise taking in his input. If I had've complained I would've went to the place you suggested. IMO he seems to have an aggressive urgency to get this sorted. Anyway the response you have seen was a cut and paste of what I posted on the scar talk page. I was in a hurry.--Veryvery20 (talk)\n\nAgreed, I didn't bother to read that badly formatted and not very coherent comment. Jezhotwells (talk)\n\nVeryvery20 - the source for that statement (as you've given it) is an AIDS advocacy group, which on first blush is probably not a reliable source for this kind of thing. It would be better if you could find a secondary scholarly source that shows that bee venom or ACE inhibitors are accepted, mainstream treatments for scarring. If it's cutting edge medicine without extensive acceptance, or something derived from alternative or folk medicine, then it might not be right to use it on the article, and it should certainly be carefully attributed so that people know it not a generally accepted treatment. Don't let your enthusiasm for the idea throw the article out of balance; try to think of the bigger picture of the topic and put this in its proper perspective. --Ludwigs2\n\nLudwig, In this case I'm not here complaining about the Bee Venom deletion (I refuse to associate them both together, they are both equally valid dont get me wrong here, it is just one is alternative and one is not. My worry with complaining about both of them together it might get them lumped into together and I imagine the knee jerk prejudice the Bee Venom citation could get may rub off on the Ace Inhibitor info giving a false impression. IMO I think RKnight has been very unwittingly/wittingly slippery/cunning lumping them together to paint them with the same brush). I'm here complaining about the deletion of sound cited encyclopedic information with regards to the ace inhibitors. The citations are all from notable university studies and they all fit in with what is known about myofibroblast proliferation in scar. These studies with captopril, enalapril and losartan are better than most that is currently in the article itself.--\n\nAIDS advocacy??? Ludwig these are the citations I'm concerned with:\n\nACE Inhibitors (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors) http://www.medicinenet.com/ace_inhibitors/article.htm Inhibition of cardiac myofibroblast formation and collagen synthesis by activation and overexpression of adenylyl cyclase www.pnas.org/content/102/2/437.short Low-Dose Enalapril in the Treatment of Surgical Cutaneous Hypertrophic Scar and Keloid http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1868346 Treatment of a Postburn Keloid Scar with Topical Captopril: http://www.drnemati.com/files/PRS%20article.pdf Liver Disease 'Shrunk' By Blood-pressure Drug http://www.natap.org/2009/HCV/060509_01.htm As you can see the information on ace inhibitor is concentrated with sources. Veryvery20 (talk)\n\nThere is little point in trying to discuss the merits of various edits here. Kudpung has suggested getting advice from the Medicine project, which is an excellent idea. If you cannot resolve your differences on the talk page, please consider raising a WP:RFC. Jezhotwells (talk)\n\nThank you editors, I think we've resolved my biggest issue, edit warring and not using the talk page to reach consensus on the topic. I find it amusing that VeryVery is now claiming credit for this idea, but I guess the important thing is that everybody is (mostly) following policy now. Rknight (talk)\n\nA good portion of the recent edit history, and the edits themselves, are not displaying on Tax Foundation. I copied the content into my sandbox, where all the content does display. I looked for citation/comment errors, but did not locate any. Help in remedying this issue is appreciated.--E8 (talk)\n\nThis seems to be a problem with my account in general. Other main page edits are now not displaying. Is there significant lag on the mainspace servers?--E8 (talk)\n\nThe latest edit I see to that page is 08:55 with the comment (per 990). Sometimes there are server lags. Have you tried refreshing your browser cache? Jezhotwells (talk)\n\nThanks. I restarted my browser and things are now displaying properly. Check this one off as resolved!--E8 (talk)\n\nAnother editor, User:K.slauter, has added coverage of a recent legal dispute involving B&Q. I do not feel that the case is noteworthy and so deleted the mention of it from the article, the user re-added the content and has so far refused to discuss the matter on the article or his own talk page. Not really sure how to approach an unresponsive editor? raseaCtalk to me\n\nIf the edit warring continues, consider reporting at WP:3RR. Jezhotwells (talk)\n\nAlthough the user did not add the content correctly and should not have edit-warred, the information is reliably sourced and could be added carefully to the article without offending neutrality or weight rules. I commented on the Talk page. Jonathanwallace (talk)\n\nIt is regarding an external link. It was approved and was there for a month, suddenly some one delete it!.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym_and_initialism http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acronyms_and_initialisms\n\nthere was no messages why it was deleted!\n\nCan anyone help me to find who is removing it every time and what is the reason??\n\nthanks, — Preceding unsigned comment added by Acroman007 (talk • contribs)\n\nIf you look in the article history you will see who deleted it, User:Themfromspace. You should ask them why, before just re-inserting it, either on the article talk page or on their own talk page. Most of the external links on those articles look like spam links, in my opinion. Jezhotwells (talk)\n\nAre you in some way affiliated with this website? Rehevkor ✉\n\nAs a note, I'm removed the link again, and posted an explanation on the talk page. - SudoGhost (talk)\n\nI;ve made changes to this page and someone has tried to ban me and keeps reverting it. Everything I wrote is true and cited but the vandal has a login name and I do not. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.90.34.77 (talk • contribs) 20:28, 12 April 2011\n\nThe above is a vandal and sockpuppet related to 98.209.212.144, 173.122.85.176, and 67.243.131.124. He or she has a history of inserting highly non-neutral language without sources, as seen on the edits here. Bans are strongly recommended as he or she completely refuses to stop using multiple accounts in abuse of Wikipedia policy. Sugar-Baby-Love (talk)\n\nFor example, the above user turned (The Daily Caller is a political journalism website based in Washington, D.C., United States with a focus on original reporting and breaking news, ) into (The Daily Caller is a yellow journalism website based in Washington, D.C., United States with a focus on politics, original reporting, breaking news, neoconservative ideology, and YouTube videos,) with no sourcing. See here. Sugar-Baby-Love (talk)\n\nI would strongly urge you to stop reverting and let some uninvolved editors or admins get involved. I have issued the IP a 3RR warning, but I'm not really sure its clear socking or vandalism, the current IP you are reverting has not made the same edits, and you have reverted more then 3 times as well. Monty845\n\nThis is nonsense. You see a person abusing multiple accounts. I've posted that clear as crystal. How is that acceptable Wikipedia policy? Sugar-Baby-Love (talk)\n\nAnd there's no way calling something \"yellow journalism\", with no sources, is not vandalism. Sugar-Baby-Love (talk)\n\nActually, it is an WP:NPOV violation, not vandalism. --Orange Mike | Talk\n\nIt is not allowed to remove other people's talk page posts as you did , , , . These posts are not vandalism; they are talk page comments. --Diannaa (Talk)\n\nThere is a report filed by someone else open at the edit war notice board Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Edit_warring. Monty845\n\n70.90.34.77 geolocates to Detroit; 98.209.212.144 geolocates to Kansas City; 173.122.85.176 geolocates to Overland Park, Kansas; and 67.243.131.124 geolocates to Richmond Hill, NY. These are likely not sock puppets but likely at least three distinct users. --Diannaa (Talk)\n\nRe-indent And those three made the exact same edits through what? A Vulcan mind-meld? I recommend using another test. But, in any case, thank God you all are here. I can now finally disengage from the article totally as you wash out this vandal. It's already been a waste of time and unnecessary heightened blood pressure. Sugar-Baby-Love (talk)\n\nWhile SSU has become UIS, I think it is relevant to put the original history of the campus before it became UIS. Wondering if you would open the page up? — Preceding unsigned comment added by Apric2 (talk • contribs)\n\nAh you have found a redirect page. You could edit the page to become a history of the original institution, but I think it would be better to include a brief history in the University of Illinois at Springfield article. In any case, the best place to start would be to initiate a discussion on the talk page at Talk:University of Illinois at Springfield. Jezhotwells (talk)\n\nI have written a biography for a new young artist, very famous in his country and somewhat famous in others. I have the artists' consent to the content and he had posted it on his facebook and Myspace pages. I would like to create a page for this artist on Wikipedia and include that biography, however, I am inexperienced in Wikipedia and do not wish for my page/article to be deleted. I would like to do it the correct way considering Wikipedia policies. So, my question is, Can I send my article to Wikipedia editors/approvers to review it and advise me whether it is in violation or not and what I should do to change that if it turns out to be inviolation of the policies. Thank you for your help, — Preceding unsigned comment added by Mona MG (talk • contribs)\n\nHi, welcome to Wikipedia. You can create a draft page in your user space, e.g. User:Mona MG/Artist page, where \"Artist page\" would be replaced by the name of the artist. You could then request WP:FEEDBACK. (Click on blue links to reach the relevant paqes.) To survive as an article in the encyclopaedia you need to demonstrate the notability of the subject against the criteria. Notability is not the same as fame, and any assertion of it needs to be verified by reliable third party sources. Also note that if you have ant connection with the subject of the article, you need to read and understand our conflict of interest policies. I have left some useful links on your talk page. Jezhotwells (talk)\n\nTo whom it may concern: It has become necessary for me to request intervention in an edit content dispute on vasectomy with User:Dijcks. Full details are available at Vasectomy Talk. The user is repeatedly inserting unsupported point-of-view claims with combative edit summaries. He has reverted at least three of my edits today, has reverted multiple edits of mine during the past month, and has made highly misleading characterizations of my motives. Full details are available at Vasectomy Talk and the relevant histories. Sincerely, Giancoli (talk)\n\nIt looks to me like 'six-to-one and half-a-dozen to the other'. Please see admin Philippe's comment, action, and suggestions today at the article talk page. --Kudpung กุดผึ้ง (talk)\n\nJMH649 made significant changes to the Mefloquine page.\n\nAs an ER doctor, he has as much expereience as a dentist to make the edits to the previous sections.

In the second place your comments about another editor are out of place. Wikipedia does not require that editors be experienced in the fields that they write about. I have no idea whether the other editor is qualified, or whether you know what you talk about. i see nothing particularly untoward about the other edits made. Jezhotwells (talk)\n\nMoewackit edits where an addition of primary research to said article. This is against WP:MEDRS. I have replaced them with review articles. Moe is free to us review articles to make additions aswell. Cheers. Doc James (talk · contribs · email)\n\nWikipedia editors,\n\nI have been providing updates to the Mefloquine page for several years now.\n\na contibutor anemd Doc James came in and completely butchered the page.\n\nHis only reasoning is that he took the drug and was one of the lucky ones who did not havbe a reaction to it.

These people are THE experts on Mefloquine....He removed the Ellen Embry letter. SHe is the US assistant secretary of defense and is the Army Surgeon General's boss.

I think the edits User:Jmh649 has made to the article have in general been significant improvements that fall within these guidelines. If you disagree about the removal of content related certain publications in the primary literature, I recommend that you detail your concerns on the article's talk page and explain why you think they should take precedence over reliable secondary sources. If you can find secondary sources that support the conclusions of the primary sources that you cite, that would be particularly helpful. I would also recommend that you conduct yourself in a more civil fashion, avoiding the kinds of personal attacks you have expressed here and elsewhere. Accusing everyone who disagrees with you as being part of some drug company conspiracy is not going to advance your cause. To the contrary, if you continue the personal attacks and fail to assume good faith of other editors, you may risk being blocked from editing. -- Ed (Edgar181)\n\nPlease would a skilled administrator review this article for relevance and structure. 4/12/11 Leah/Fuzzybunny4Leah-Yvonne 07:06, 14 April 2011 (UTC)\n\nYou can get a review at Wikipedia:Requests for feedback.

The user somehow believes the fact that he is Lebanese is not relevant. There is no dispute over the fact he is Lebanese, as shown by many articles (see Bob Katter Discussion page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bob_Katter). The Bob Katter, Sr. article regarding Bob Katter's father also includes information that he is not only Lebanese, but also that he is actually a relative of the poet Khalil Gibran.\n\nOn of the justifications Donama uses is that it may hurt Katter politically to have the fact that he is Lebanese on his Wikipedia page. There is no reason for this. Katter has not tried to hide is Lebanese heritage. Also, see the article about the Australian federal politician Joe Hockey. It states numerous time that he is of Palestinian descent. If Donama's logic is followed, all information concerning the cultural background of Australian politicians should be deleted.

They used Mexican silver Dollars as the way to keep track. But after several corrections were posted, the same old re-written history shows up that blames the entire Opium problem on the British.

I am not going to engage in an undo war of some kind, so I am immediately asking for more opinions regarding LPU0302's deletion of my version of \"Controversy\".\n\nAs a Finn, I come from the perspective that the controversy concerning WIDER is what brought the organization to the public view. This can be seen from the first quotes in my now deleted section. Because of this I expect people want to learn about the details of said controversy.\n\nIt is great that user LPU0302 took the time to write a more extensive presentation defining WIDER, but the way he deals with the controversy is inadequate. His version is written in a downplaying tone and is very brief.\n\nSuahili (talk)\n\n'Comment' It seems to me the removal of some of the controversy section without discussion was part of an attempt to sanitise the article. The article now reads like one WIDER itself might have written. Eg the second sentence in the lead\n\nSince its establishment it has earned a reputation as one of the world´s leading research institutes on development economics [1] and it counts amongst its researchers and associates many Nobel Laureates, Prize Winners and other world renowned experts[2]. seems to be a spin on the info in the sources.\n\nI am also worried about single purpose accounts involved here. I do not know best to proceed. Perhaps I should have a go at tidying soon. (Msrasnw (talk) )\n\nMsrasnw: Maybe it would benefit you to contact both myself and LPU0302 privately to get a better picture of what we are trying to achieve (and discover who we are)? I was not able to email you, but maybe you have some way of emailing me as I have enabled the feature. Suahili (talk)\n\nI am willing to help try to improve the article but would rather not get involved in any private communications. I would like to think everything could or perhaps should be done in an open fashion. Best wishes (Msrasnw (talk) )\n\nI agree that the article reads a bit too much like a PR piece at the moment. I'm not in a position to assess whether the \"controversy\" section was overwritten before, or is underwritten now (it's just a sentence or two, and airily dismissed with the unsourced conclusion along the lines of \"many feel it was all politically motivated in the first place\". I'll whittle away at some of the worst puffery but other editors should take a look at it as well. JohnInDC (talk)\n\nWell, I *can* opine that the current 'controversy' section is now under-written as I can't make heads or tails about what the problem was in the first place. That section could stand some expansion, with properly sourced material *and* neutral, non-inflammatory language. It doesn't need to be near as detailed as the versions that have just been deleted. JohnInDC (talk)\n\nI started to construct a more complete page on the Wider because it seemed a bit weird that the only thing written about it was how it was perceived in Finland in the mid 80s. The relevance of the institute is definitely somewhere else. I think that the controversy is an important historical point about that also explains a lot of the institutional structure today, but what Suahili had written in it was not about Wider at all but about mr. Ahtisaari and mr. Bassin. After looking at the sources and reading on the controversies of that time I think the evidence seems to suggest that there was a lot of political play with Wider that related to the presidential ambitions of Ahtisaari and Paavo Väyrynen.\n\nAll these issues should be found on the pages of Ahtisaari, Väyrynen, Bassin etc., rather than Wider's page. Furthermore, I doubt that newspaper stories that are written as the story progresses should be used as the primary source for the writing of the controversy part. There are some very good, Finnish language, articles written in the 90s that give quite a balanced narration of this whole thing.\n\nOn the topic of Wider's finances I think it has some merit in the history section, but truthfully without rumors and inflammatory language. The point is that this page should offer an overview of a development economics institute and that should be the focus.\n\nIn relation to the Since its establishment it has earned a reputation as one of the world´s leading research institutes on development economics [1] and it counts amongst its researchers and associates many Nobel Laureates, Prize Winners and other world renowned experts[2]. - sentence, it was backed up by two references which now stand alone apart from the main text as that was deleted. The claim that it has become one of the leading research institutes in development economics was a reference to Wider being ranked the 7th best economics think tank in the world by UPenn (fuzzy on the details now as I can not open their page). The second link was just from Widers own page listing those \"renowned\" people.\n\nAnyways, I look forward to us coming up with a page that all of us find useful and purposeful. Sorry for the overly long outpour. --LPU0302 (talk)\n\nNo worries about the length of your note.

I will admit that I allowed my temper to get the best of me, and I engaged in an edit war with an IP user. However, I finally suggested a page protection, which was granted. The issue involves the subject's vote the Paul Ryan budget plan that passed the House. The IP user with whom I disagree has repeatedly inserted content into the section in question pointing out the issues with the legislation. I have no problem with this. However, I feel that the user's content has now gone beyond merely providing a summative recounting of the debate over the bill, and has crossed into ideological warfare. As I have told the user, I believe that, because the article is about a Congressman and not a specific bill, only a summary of both sides' points about the controversial vote should be included. Additionally, I have added the wiki link to the bill's page, where interested users could go to find more in-depth information about the debate. Bottom line, I feel that this section should not get an inordinate amount of coverage, given that it is not the focus of the article. I am all for pointing out both sides, though I feel the IP user is turning this into some sort of perceived partisan back-and-forth. The way the section is worded now frankly seems wealsely to me, and it does bother me.\n\nPlease see the page's history and edit summaries for evidence of my points. I posted my proposed text on the talk page, to which the IP user responded with a lengthy partisan-fueled diatribe. I simply do not have the time or desire to respond to every point; I believe my edit summaries and past editing work on this site speak for themselves. For the record, I am not even a registered Republican, nor do I think much of the legislation in question. I do however believe in neutrality, and would assert that IP user's words do not inidicate a similar concern.\n\nThus, I am requesting some third-party help. I relaize that it was counter-productive to engage in an edit war; whatever the outcome of this process is, I will accept. Thanks very much for the assistance.

He is very POV pushing and very anti-German. Which is not without precedent, since in other History-related boards like \"Alternate History Discussion Board\" he is well-known for rather highly biased anti-German rhetoric and hatemongering (and banned). Here on Wiki I knew of 2 topics he his very active in pushing his agenda, Mitteleuropa and Frederick the Great. I don´t want to do too much, since I know my balancing edits were rather clumsy in style, since I´m new at this, but based on reliable materials. On the discussion pages, he always goes on and on about genocide and how pro-German/Pro-Prussian everyone is, basicly \"the eternal evil German\". His edits are based mainly on propaganda works, like in \"Mitteleuropa\", where most of his sources until recently were from communist Poland and even better, a Entente work from 1917(!). Their reliability concerning anything German is unsurprisingly near zero! From experience I know that he will not relent on his very one-sided view and I request (not lightly I must add) a ban of all his personas concerning these two topics. I know from other boards I´m a member of, that he will return and turn it into an editing war and I´m sick of it, but this hate-mongering should have no place on Wiki! --Neunhist (talk) signed by Neunhist\n\nWe don't do bans here, but it might be considered at WP:Administrators' noticeboard.

While only the Blink-182 song \"Lemmings\" is mentioned, a far more popular and well known song is that of Synchronicity II by The Police. The lyric is as follows:\n\nAnother working day has ended, Only the rush hour hell to face. Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes, Contestants in a suicidal race.\n\nIt is not a super-vital fact, but I thought it might be a more identifiable usage making it more relevant to the masses.\n\nTrunks cscs (talk)\n\nWell, yes, but is that encyclopaedic information? Jezhotwells (talk)\n\nBrittany York, Miss North Carolina, USA 2011\n\nYou have her birth date as 4/16/1989, which is incorrect. Brittany was born 4/16/1990\n\nMarcie York, Mom— Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.8.86.57 (talk • contribs)\n\nDo you have a reliable source for that? – ukexpat (talk)\n\nThere isn't a reliable source in the article for the 1989 birthdate either. GB fan (talk)\n\nAt the top of my article, there is note stipulating that my \"article needs additional citations for references\". I already gave, at the bottom of my article, an external link with the Wodehouse book \"The Man Upstairs\" on Project Gutenberg. \"When Doctors Disagree\" is one of the short stories included in this book. I Just read the story and wrote a plot summary of it. What other references can I give you ? Anyone can read the full short story in Project Gutenberg and verify that my summary is correct. Being a new editor in Wikipedia, I am waiting for any information you can give me about my editing. It will help me with my further contributions. Cordially yours\n\nGabbiGB (talk) GabbiGB <email redacted>\n\nHi, a link to Gutenberg is not a third party reference. It is possible that this short story is not natable in its own right, just because it was written by a notable author. Please read WP:NBOOK for guidelines on the notability of books. From this I quote:\n\nIt is a general consensus on Wikipedia that articles on books should not be split and split again into ever more minutiae of detail treatment, with each split normally lowering the level of notability. What this means is that while a book may be notable, it is not normally advisable to have a separate article on a character or thing from the book, and it is often the case that despite the book being manifestly notable, a derivative article from it is not.\n\nThe book [or work] has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works appearing in sources that are independent of the book itself, with at least some of these works serving a general audience. This includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, other books, television documentaries and reviews. Some of these works should contain sufficient critical commentary to allow the article to grow past a simple plot summary. This excludes media re-prints of press releases, flap copy, or other publications where the author, its publisher, agent, or other self-interested parties advertise or speak about the book.\n\nSo what you need to find are some reliable third party sources that discuss the story. At the moment you merely;y have a plot summary and the artcile is a prime candidate for redirecting back to The Man Upstairs. Jezhotwells (talk)\n\nMy Wiki entry keeps receiving error messages such as:\n\n\"The topic of this article may not meet the general notability guidelines...\"\n\n\"This article is an orphan...\"\n\n\"This article's tone or style may not be appropriate.\"\n\nI'm no term-paper writer, but all the information is accurate and up to date.\n\nCould anyone help me resolve this? My Wiki entry can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Love_(humorist)\n\nThanks for any tips or insights.\n\nJjlove88 (talk) Jason Love <E-mail redacted>\n\nWell (1) it doesn't have any cited sources so we have no way of determining whether you are notable as per the guidelines at WP:BIO; (2) it only has one qualifying incoming link, so it is an orphan and (3) it does read a bit like a resumé. I have restored the tags. Also, please take a look at WP:COI and WP:AUTOBIOGRAPHY. – ukexpat (talk)\n\nI noticed on this page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral#External_links about Quadrilaterals under References that the link to the article (1) \"Stars: A Second Look\" is labeled as a [dead link], but found no problem clicking on the link and the article appeared shortly. Perhaps this should be corrected?\n\nThanks in advance! Geometryfan — Preceding unsigned comment added by Geometryfan (talk • contribs)\n\nRight you are. I've removed the tag. Favonian (talk)\n\nHello wiki editors, please excuse my typing, I am disabled and and using speech recognition. Currently it does not interact with wiki very well. Additionally I use a mini keyboard that does not contain a full set of braces and other symbols useful in the wiki markup language. A great deal of what my 57-year-old eyes read concerning the wiki markup language is confusing and does not make any sense relative to my I/O resources. However I'm having a great deal of fun trying to turn centrifugal compressors into a respectable encyclopedic article.\n\nAll my questions concern my efforts to update: centrifugal compressor\n\nfirst as a newbie and a very poor editor I have made numerous updates just for the sake of small changes. I have currently discovered that keeping Microsoft word open on the left side of my screen and Wikipedia open to the article on the right side of screen has helped me increase my productivity, decrease my mistakes, and reduce the number of edits that I am burdening the wiki servers with. Is there an external editor which has all of the markup symbols selectable by mouse?\n\nSecond I have made mistakes incorrectly specifying a fair use details of graphics I have uploaded to wiki. Again my bad, my learning curve. What is the easiest way to correct this?\n\nThird as an semi-expert in the field of turbomachinery aerodynamics, 35 years of experience working with very well known experts in the field, 11 years of consulting for the leading consulting firm in the world I am having a little difficulty in properly referencing the article as it is written. For example the similarities between different kinds of turbomachinery is self evident through first principles of physics. However, finding others that state the same thing in professional papers, journals or books is difficult. In fact most of the most advanced textbooks do not cover the science in as much detail as would be learned working for NASA or other aircraft companies. I will continue to make every effort to properly reference the article. Do you have any comments that you can share advising me in this area?\n\nFourth do you have any advice on dealing with pseudo-experts who insists on having non-academic content to articles? Going further, there are articles similar to centrifugal compressors; other dynamic turbomachinery that are improperly or incorrectly written. Is there a general overall category within physics or engineering that would allow an overall umbrella to be placed on this topic? In this way centrifugal blowers, centrifugal fans, axial compressors, axial turbines, radial turbines, mixed flow compressors etc. can be merged together so that they share specific subtopics. Specifically the fundamental physics of all that I listed are identical, this I can footnote with many textbooks. Am I allowed to delete poorly written articles and redirect to centrifugal compressors? Can centrifugal compressors be renamed?\n\nFifth and final I am not a mathematician and seriously need advice on the best way to write fundamental physics for dynamic axisymmetric turbomachinery. There are interval forms of continuity, energy, momentum and equations of state. There are differential forms of continuity, energy, momentum and equations of state. The equations can be written in Cartesian coordinates as outlined by NASA or polar coordinates is used by everyone else… GE, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce… You get the picture! The equations can be expanded to show the complexity of the full three dimensions or they can be written in a simple one-dimensional form. Is there board of mathematical experts I can help in this applied mathematics?\n\nThank you very much your help and your time, Martin koronowski,Mkoronowski (talk)\n\nYou raise important points about the accessibility of Wikipedia to those editing using speech recognition or similar software. I do not have an answer to this but the Wikipedia:Help desk may be able to help. As you have noted many articles are not well written or contain inaccurate uncited statements. This is remedied only by editors working to correct this, and your help will be valuable. The question related to physics may be best answered by members of the WP:WikiProject Physics. Jezhotwells (talk)\n\nWikipedia:Accessibility may also be of interest. – ukexpat (talk)\n\nAddressing some of the questions not answered by others;\n\nExternal editors. You may be interested in WikEd and Wikipedia:Text editor support. Microsoft word used as an external editor (and I guess most word processing packages) might solve your problem with selecting special characters by mouse although you can already do this with the standard editor screen so I am not sure what more you are looking for.\n\nFair use details of image file. Click on the image and then just edit the page as normal to correct the details. Unless you uploaded the file to Commons rather than Wikipedia, in which case you will have to go there it edit it. However, I am not sure that Commons allows fair use at all so in this case you will have to upload it again to Wikipedia.\n\nThe question of citing basic physics facts can be difficult especially when working on a more advanced article with advanced references. If you look hard enough, however, you can usually find what you are looking for. In one article recently I wished to state the purpose of an interrupter circuit used with an induction coil. I think I looked through about thirty texts which all jsut assumed the reader knew the purpose before I found one that actually stated it and I could cite. Failing that, if a knowledgable editor on reading the source could reasonably be expected to come to the same conclusion then it is ok to say it in the Wikipedia article - I'm sure that is stated in policy somewhere but I can't find it right now.\n\nNon-academic content - see WP:TRIVIA and WP:Popular culture\n\nRedirecting - this is allowed but it may be best to discuss with other editors first on the relevant page - ditto with renaming. Writing a \"summary style\" article with links to the individual articles may be more appropriate. Poorly written is not a valid reason for deletion or redirection, but it is a valid reason for improvement.\n\nMathematics - as well as the wikiprojects already pointed to, there is a reference desk WP:RD/MA for mathematics and WP:RD/S for science.\n\nSpinningSpark\n\nthankyou, this is of great help! Mkoronowski (talk)\n\nHello, For quite a while now, I have been having a dispute with User:Charlesdrakew. I feel as if he has been 'spying' on me. Several of the articles I created, he nominated for deletion or support its deletion if it had been nominated. When my IP had been falsely (this has been resolved with no consequences) accused of being a sockpuppet, he was the one to nominate, with no reason whatsoever. It started because my friend in real life, had been again falsely accused of being a sockpuppet and because I had supported him in his case, Charlesdrakew nominated my IP for blockage. He interrferes with everything I do and comments on it. When i had changed my signature very recently, he straight away made a complaint that it is too bright and distracting and he was the only one. He also was talking about me, quite unpolitely to another user. He thinks the articles I created are 'stinking piles of orginal research' and that they do not deserve to be here. He makes these accusations, often with no sensible reason. He also has been reverting some of my edits, always quoting WP:NOT and I have made sure it is all OK with that guide. I am worried that User:Charlesdrakew, will just find and try to delete any article or even some edits I make and it will waste my work and time. Another example, is when I had placed a 'See also: List of bus routes in ...' on two towns pages. He reverted them claiming Wikipedia is not a travel guide, but I have seen several like them on other pages, so I decided to add it. I would really appreciate some help with this as it has become extremely annoying. Adam mugliston Talk\n\nCan you provide specific diffs of the edits in question? Jezhotwells (talk)\n\nYes, here they are\n\n1. [10] 2. [11] 3. [12] 4. [13] at 09:16 and 09:19, 21 April 2011\n\nI can't find any of the ones of the sockpuppet investigation as these have been archived/deleted. There were more, I'm just not sure where they were. Thanks. Adam mugliston Talk\n\nIt is quite normal that an editor on finding a problem contribution might check through a few of the other contributions from the same editor. If you do not want your work to be changed, added to, or deleted then you should not be editing on Wikipedia. The nature of this place is that nobody owns the work they contribute and that anybody can edit it. The only discussion should be on whether the work conforms to our policies and guidelines. On your specific examples;\n\nA list of bus routes most definitely comes under WP:NOTGUIDE in my opinion except possibly in an article about a bus company.\n\nPretty much the same comment as 1. but not so clearcut. Do you have any reliable sources that indicate these details are actually notable for an encyclopedia entry?\n\nSame comment, bus timetables are not notable and fail WP:DIRECTORY, although a summary of bus frequency might be acceptable. The rest of that edit is WP:MOS style issues.\n\nThis is precisely the same edit as #3.\n\nOn the matter of politeness, first of all, the etiquette here when making a complaint about another editor is to inform them and provide a link to the discussion. You have failed to do this but I have now done it for you. I agree that saying 'stinking piles of orginal research' is not very complimentary and need not have been so harsh. However, the comment does manage to be about the edits rather than the editor. Personal attacks on editors are not tolerated here but you must expect, and not be sensitive about, criticism of your work. The most productive response to such a comment is to provide references that show that your work is not OR. SpinningSpark and 13:58, 23 April 2011 (UTC)\n\nYes, I know I don't own anything and all that, but what I am tryinng to get through is that he has been commenting and going against verything I do and I think he is picking on me, which is not right. I realise things will be critised, but he does it to everything. Is it really that OK that he looks through what I do, I consider that spying and that is not right. Adam mugliston Talk\n\nYour edit history, and mine and everyone elses, is public and available for anyone to review. If Wikipedia did not want that to happen there would be no access to allowed to user contribution lists. Looking at a contribution history is not spying and addressing policy and guideline issues found there is not picking on you. Stalking an editor for the purposes of hounding them off Wikipedia is not allowed, WP:STALK states \"The important component of wikihounding is disruption to another user's own enjoyment of editing\". If you think this applies to you then please offer some diffs showing edits which are clearly designed to spoil your enjoyment as opposed to merely putting right something that is against guidelines. SpinningSpark\n\nWould telling me to 'stop pissing off grown-ups' or 'take your lists of bus routes somewhere else' be an example of the above? Adam mugliston Talk\n\nI have already seen and spoken to the editor about those comments. They were not included in any of the diffs you originally provided so I was not aware of them when I first responded. My answer remains the same however, the most productive way forward for you is to find references backing up notability, or else accept that bus timetables are not suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia. Bus company publications do not count because they are not independant, but newspaper articles discussing bus timetables would help establish notability. SpinningSpark\n\nI am not here to be told that the articles I create are notable or not. I am here, because I feel that Charlesdrakew is specifically picking on me. I have found evidence of his previous bullying not me, but to other users and by this I assume he is likely to do it again. Charlesdrakew for some reason does not like me and chooses to try and either upset or annoy me. I have friends, who create similar pages, like me and he never comments on their work. Their work is not backed up by what you call 'secondary sources', either. I have also asked you whether 'stop pissing off grown-up editors' and 'take your lists of bus routes somewhere else off Wikipedia' could be reported under WP:STALK. If you are unable to help me, please say so, so I can go onto mediation, failing that RfC, faling that arbitration. As for the notablity of the articles, that is just your opinion and interpretation of the guides. There are several people who say that the pages are notable. Adam mugliston Talk\n\nIf you complain at a noticeboard about the behaviour of others, you can only expect that your own behaviour will be put in the spotlight too. See don't shoot yourself in the foot. The fact that other articles exist with similar problems is not an accepted reason for creating more of them, see WP:other stuff exists. As I said above, I have warned Charlesdrakew about incivility and I am prepared to take further action should he do it again. What were you hoping would happen? SpinningSpark\n\nWell, I was hoping for someone to tell Charlesdrakew to stop picking on me or something of that, so he doesn't appear wherever I edit and not revert my edits, before I have the chance to get suitable sources. Adam mugliston Talk\n\nThe way to get him to stop reverting your edits before you have a chance to get suitable sources is to get the suitable sources and put them in the article at the same time you are putting in the content. As far as the picking on you, it sounds like SpinningSpark has discussed being civil and is willing to take further action if he isn't. GB fan (talk)\n\nLet us get one thing straight here first. I have never accused Adam of being a sock puppet or supported any such accusation. I did point to an IP to be looked at during the investigation but that is not the same thing at all. I initially got some similar articles by User:Wilbysuffolk deleted before finding others written by Adam. I have advised Adam that he may be better off working at Wikia where original research will be accepted. This would be in his own interest as the stuff he is doing here is likely to be deleted when the Wikipedia community sees what is going on. I have had to crack down on attempts to spread this stuff into settlement articles and I will continue to revert text which is not supported by inline references to reliable secondary sources as required by WP:Cite. There are a number of editors, some of whom should know better, arguing in AfDs to keep this type of article and this is leading \"no consensus\" outcomes when closing admins treat these as a ballot instead of going on the quality of arguments put forward and upholding WP quality standards. And one more thing. The supposed quotes from my talk page paraphrase what I actually said and therefor should not be in quote marks. Have a nice day.--Charles (talk)\n\nAdam, you're getting a bit aggressive here. Although it's good that you're aware of the existence of an escalation route for disputes, I really don't think an arbitration case about bus routes would be a good idea for anyone involved. (Although some former bus related articles are also covered by Arbcom sanctions, including possibly the now-userfied Judaism and bus stops which was deleted in an AfD at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Judaism and bus stops - note the extensive use of secondary sources as references.) It would be a good idea for you to discuss these problems with your mentor rather than continuing this approach. --Demiurge1000 (talk)\n\nCharles, some time ago, about 2 months I think, you have nominated my IP address as a suspected sockpuppet, after Wilbysuffolk was a suspected sockpuppet of Crouch, Swale. You can't deny that. And how do you explain reverting a see also on a town's page, how is that against WP:NOT? You don't seem to understand, that it's not easy finding 'secondary sources', as bus routes are not the most popular subjects in press. I have reserved a book from my local library, but due to Easter, I won't be able to collect it until Tuesday. This is a book recommended by Stuart.Jamieson, and I hope to find sources there. Yes, you have 'advised' me to go to Wikia, but it was not in a polite manner, which is expected here in Wikipedia.\n\nAdam, does it not occur to you that I could not have known that it was yuor IP? I reported an IP which I assumed at the time to be Wilbysuffolk's. You may have just forgotten to log in, but one way or another it was a sock puppet edit.--Charles (talk)\n\nThat doesn't really follow by any definition of \"sock puppet edit\" that I'm aware of. If it's not the same person then it's not a sockpuppet. (It might be a meatpuppet, but that is a different thing...) --Demiurge1000 (talk)\n\nGiven how closely these editors have been working together that is not a big difference.--Charles (talk)\n\nDemiurge1000, I do hope I will not have to go on to arbitration, but if all other methods fail I may be forced to do so. Adam mugliston Talk\n\nHrm, well, anyway, you should talk to your mentor before doing so. (Maybe I said that already...) I do note that feelings have been running sufficiently high that Charles has engaged in what I consider some inappropriate WP:CANVASSing on this issue; I have left a note about that on his talk page. --Demiurge1000 (talk)\n\nHi, I am inquiring as to how to edit the Bob Parlocha entry (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Parlocha). Under the syndication section, we also carry his show from midnight until 6am seven days a week, and are not mentioned in the article. We also carry his show when other programs are not available. We are a public radio station located in Princess Anne, MD, on the campus of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, call letters WESM. Our website is www.wesm913.org if you would like to veryify our program schedule.\n\nThe section reads: Syndication: A decline in jazz radio audiences led KJAZ owner Ron Cowan to sell the ailing station in 1994. A leading fine arts station in Chicago, WFMT (through \"JSN\", its satellite radio affiliate), agreed to syndicate the show Jazz with Bob Parlocha, which he records in Alameda, California. The evening show was picked up by KUVO (Denver), WRCJ-FM (Detroit) and several other public radio stations, including Kansas and Alabama.[3] The leading jazz station in the western United States, KKJZ (Long Beach), began airing his program in early 2007.[4][5] The show is also carried by CJRT-FM in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nWe should be inserted somewhere in the above text. Thank you. 131.118.113.47 (talk)\n\nIf this fact has been noted in reliable sources then it can be added to the article together with citations to the source. However, it is advisable not to edit articles on a subject with which you yourself are associated. While this is not strictly forbidden it is often difficult for an involved party to write in a neutral way (required by policy on Wikipedia) and it is often best to wait for an independant editor to come along and take an interest. While it may be some time before this happens, it will eventually if the topic is truly notable. SpinningSpark\n\nIn the articles Human skin color and Sun tanning (see also the talk page), I have added the following modifying statements (in italics) intended to neutralise what I consider as biased or unnuanced information:\n\nSentence 1: Tanned skin has been shown in the United States to be viewed both as more attractive and more healthy than pale skin, but not by the whole population.\n\nComment to this: This formulation gives an impression of that all Americans view tanned skin as 'more attractive and more healthy'. Critical objections: Which survey is this? Who has made and ordered the survey? Who answered the survey? Is the survey generally representative or maybe based on e.g. the readers of a fashion and lifestyle magazine? What are the concrete results of the survey? Do these results make the formulation above correct?\n\nHere are the two sources to which the references show:\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1992.tb01527.x/abstract\n\nQuotation: «The sample consisted of 191 students with a mean age of 14 years from five Victorian secondary schools.»\n\nhttp://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/109/6/1009\n\nQuotation: «Methods. A cross-sectional study, from all 50 states, of 10 079 boys and girls 12 to 18 years of age in 1999. Data were collected from self-report questionnaires [...]»\n\nIt is ridiculous that a person has used these marginal surveys to conclude with that all Americans consider tanned skin as a status symbol etc.\n\nSentence 2: [...] making tanned skin seem fashionable, healthy, and luxurious, but not by the whole population.\n\nThe article strongly gives an impression of that tanned skin colour completely has taken over 'the exclusivity' or that that nearly all persons in the Western world consider tanned skin colour as e.g. «fashionable, healthy, and luxurious». An academically untrained person reading these articles, might believe that 'exclusivity of tanned skin' is consensual. The formulation should be nuanced as quickly as possible.\n\nI do not know in depth the American society, but I believe that e.g. in the political élite of this country, it is hard to find a white man who has tanned skin.\n\nOtherwise, many formulations in the article seem to be cut out from an advertisement, yes, if not added by the producers themselves.\n\nAt the same time, I would like to make one aware of the user Ckatz, who has removed these neutralising statements. One may remove biased statements, but should not remove statements intended to nuance biased information. Furthermore, I marked a formulation with {{Who|date=September 2011}}, but also this was removed by this user. It could indicate that this user is more interested in politics than in objective information.\n\nI have started a discussion about this, but it is feared that this will be more based on personal opinions and agendas rather than science. That is why I find it best to ask for editor assistance already now.\n\n--- Aaemn784 (talk)\n\nReliable Source Examples says: \"Statistical data should be considered a primary source and should be avoided. Misinterpretation of the material is easy and statistics are frequently reported ambiguously in the media, so any secondary reference to statistical data should be treated with considerable care.\" I would argue for deletion of the polls and susbtitution of a reliably sourced opinion: \"According to GQ Magazine\" or some such. We should not say in Wikipedia's voice \"Americans like a tan\", at least not based on that kind of evidence. However, your good faith edits didn't really fix the problem, but created what I call a \"POV quilt\" (\"Joe Botz is regarded as one of the most intelligent people in the world, except by those who think he is stupid\"), and may have been reverted for that reason. Jonathanwallace (talk)\n\nHi, and thanks for your assistance. It is a humourous term and example. (When that is said, it shall be added that my addition was modifying, and not directly opposing.)\n\n--- Aaemn784 (talk)\n\nHello, The article on John Westly Powell says he lost part of an arm in the Battle of Shiloh (1862). The photo of Mr. Powell taken in 1871-1872 shows him using his left arm. However, the photo dated 1897 shows him without the left arm. Is this just the way one of the photos was reversed when reprinted? Thank you —Preceding unsigned comment added by 69.181.136.205 (talk)"
