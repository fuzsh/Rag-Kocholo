        "text": "The UMES PA Program will follow the inclement weather policy of the University with a few exceptions. Depending on the severity of prevailing or impending road conditions, the University will observe a state of (1) full operation, (2) minimum manning, or (3) closed. The UMES PA Program will observe a 2-hour delay if the University declares a state of minimum manning. The Program reserves the right to schedule virtual lectures if applicable in the event of inclement weather. University status will be announced on the UMES radio station, WESM-FM (91.3), as well as other local radio and television stations. If the UMES PA Program is closed or operating virtually, the affected faculty will reschedule activities as soon as possible and notify the students of the changes. Activities may be rescheduled during evening or weekend hours. Students who are scheduled for Clinical Clerkships should consult the Clinical Education Handbook for the inclement weather policy.\n\nFaculty and Staff Contingent Policy\n\nAll UMES PA Program Courses with the exception of clinical skill courses operate on Hybrid Model. All courses are linked to YuJa Enterprise and Google Meet. They are set-up to operate in a virtual setting. All full-time faculty and adjunct faculty are trained to operate all UMES PA Program and University software and virtual platforms. Therefore, in an event of inclement weather, a department email is sent from the Program Director, Assistant Program Director, or Didactic Education Director issued to all didactic phase instructors and students to switch to remote instruction.\n\nAll clinical phase students follow the schedule of their clinical site. However, all clinical students are encouraged to use their judgment in regards to driving in inclement weather if transportation is not provided by the clinical site. They are required to notify preceptors and the clinical year team.\n\nClinical skills course will automatically be rescheduled. Students are notified as stated above."
