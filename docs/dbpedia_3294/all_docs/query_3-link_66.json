When Linda Carr pulled a handful of us together on a cold wintry day in Springfield, Missouri way back in 2001, we never realized what a valuable and important entity the University Station Alliance would be! \"\n\nRegina Dean, GM, WUOT, Knoxville, TN\n\n“U:SA is a high-value affiliation for KUOW, evidenced most recently by the great seminars on PPP Loans. I really appreciate all that you do!”\n\nCaryn Mathes, CEO, KUOW, Seattle, WA\n\nFEATURED MEMBER RESOURCES\n\nQuantitative Worth Analysis Available\n\nDo you know how much you’re worth to your licensee in terms of promotion and public relations?

One mid-western station who last completed the process in 2014 found they had increased their value from 4.2 million to 9.7 million! There has not been a better time to tackle the one page Quantitative Worth Analysis worksheet. Read more."
