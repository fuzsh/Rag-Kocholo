The class will be inducted on Nov. 11, 2022 as part of the University's Homecoming week festivities.\n\nThe main class of five individuals and one team, tapped into women's basketball, volleyball and bowling in our storied history as well as the administration, while also honoring a trio of longtime supporters for their contributions.\n\nMaria Rodriguez helped the Hawks to two NCAA Championships (2008, 2011) and one USBC Collegiate Championship (2011). Along with former teammate Kristina Frahm, she is one of two Hawks to be four-time National Tenpin Coaches Association All-Americans. She was also named NTCA Division I Player of the Year as a senior. She helped lead her teams to two Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Championships (2008, 2011). She was a three-time All-MEAC Selection and two-time MEAC Bowler of the Year (2010, 2011). She was named to the MEAC Top 50 (50th Anniversary) Bowling team in 2020 and she is a current member of the WPBA Tour.\n\nKristina Frahm also helped the Hawks to two NCAA Championships (2008, 2011) and one USBC Collegiate Championship (2011). Along with former teammate Rodriguez, she is one of two Hawks to be four-time NTCA All-Americans. She was the 2007-08 NTCA Rookie of the Year and a three-time All-MEAC selection. As a Bowler, she won two MEAC Championships (2008, 2011). She was also the 2008-09 ECAC Singles Champion. She was awarded the 2011 NCAA Championship Outstanding Performer honor. Later, as a coach, she led the team to the 2012 NCAA Championship & the 2013 USBC National Championship. She was named to the MEAC Top 50 (50th Anniversary) Bowling team in 2020.\n\nThe 2007-08 Bowling Team became NCAA National Champions, the first NCAA DI National Championship at Maryland Eastern Shore and the first NCAA DI HBCU women's program to ever win a National Championship. The squad also won the MEAC title and featured a pair of NTCA All-Americans. This team paved the way for four more National Championships from that program and was coached by Maryland Eastern Shore and MEAC Hall of Famer Sharon Brummell, who was a two-time National Coach of the Year and assistant coach Doug Dukes, who is also in the Hawks Hall of Fame. Members of the team were: Katherine Brown, Jamie Culbreth, Jennifer Davis, Sara DiScioscia, Kristina Frahm, Christine King, Martha Perez, Maria Rodriguez, Jessica Smithson, Jessica Worsley, Laura Zanrucha, and coaches Brummell, Dukes and Vince Brummell.\n\nWhitney Johnson helped her team to the MEAC Championship game all three seasons as a Hawk after transferring in as a sophomore. She was a two-time First-Team All MEAC (2008, 2009)and was on the MEAC All-Tournament Team in both 2007 and 2009. She is No. 3 on the school's all-time kills list (1,225), No. 4 in kills per set (3.82), No. 8 in hitting percentage (.307) and No. 5 in solo blocks (43) despite playing just three seasons in maroon and gray. She ranked second in the MEAC in kills in the 2007 season (525) and was 21st in the country in kills per game (4.91). She finished third in the MEAC in kills in 2008 (387). Her 525 kills in 2007 is No. 4 on the program's all-time single-season list and 387 in 2008 is No. 9. A 4.91 kills per set average in 2007 ranks her No. 5 on the single-season list and 21 solo blocks in 2007 is No. 7 on the single-season list. She was named to the MEAC Top 50 (50th Anniversary) Volleyball team in 2020.\n\nCasey Morton (Monroe-Gaskins) came to the Hawks from just up the Shore at tiny Mardela Springs High School, but has made a huge impact on the program. Monroe Gaskins was MEAC Rookie of the Year and All-Rookie Team in 2007-08 when she set Top 10 program marks for freshman. As a senior, she grabbed Second-Team All-MEAC honors, but during the time in between she placed her name all over the Hawks record book. Monroe-Gaskins is No. 4 on the program's all-time career scoring list (1,230) and just one of nine 1,000-point scorers in program history. She is No. 5 on the all-time assists list (296), tied for No. 6 in assists per game (2.6), No. 4 in steals (188), tied for No. 9 in steals per game (1.6), tied for No. 6 in field goals made (394), No. 5 in field goal attempts (1,131), No. 3 in 3-point field goals made (131), No. 2 in 3-point field goal attempts (469), No. 6 in free throws made (311), No. 6 in free throw attempts (444), No. 9 free throw percentage (70%), tied for No. 1 in games played (116), No. 1 in games started (110), No. 1 in total minutes since 2002-03 (3,481) and No. 4 in minutes per game since 2002-03 (30.0) She averaged 3.7 rebounds per game in her career while also running the point. Monroe-Gaskins is currently an assistant coach for the Hawks in her 7th season on the bench.\n\nCraig Cotton was Hawk Athletics' first full-time Sports Information Director from 1981-1988 and held the position during the transition to Division I athletics chronicling the exploits of UMES student athletes. He served as 1st play-by-play broadcaster for UMES Basketball games in conjunction with WESM-FM radio. After the dissolution of the football program, he recommended and designed a Homecoming based around basketball, which became the largest yearly athletic and institutional fundraiser. He organized the first UMES Track Invitational sponsored by Coors Beer in 1986. He created a radio talk show with WYSB FM radio in Salisbury \"Let's Talk Sports\" and staged fundraisers for athletics featuring Chuck Brown, Biz Markie and Heavy D. He wrote numerous articles that appeared in local and regional publications and mentored student workers in the SID office — some of which went on to careers in sports.\n\nAlso being inducted in the 2022 Hall of Fame Class will be three contributors. Jesse T. Williams (HOF class 2004), his wife Vernetta Williams (Maryland State class 64) and Jesse's basketball teammate, roommate and fellow Hall of Famer Dave Riddick (HOF class of 1982) will be inducted as contributors for their generosity throughout the years.\n\nLong-time season ticket holders, all three have established giving at the University. The court inside the William P. Hytche Athletic Center is named the Jesse T. Williams Court. The men's and women's basketball locker rooms bear name recognition after gifts were made for renovations in the 2000s. Riddick also established endowments at the University that still give to athletics. While their contributions are numerous and generous, their love and support of Hawk Athletics was unwavering.\n\nJesse and Dave passed away in recent years, but Vernetta Williams will be in attendance to represent the trio of long-time friends."
