        "text": "How I am paying tribute to the memory and legacy of Stephen Lawrence today 1. Never Forget - Stephen was a kind, handsome, intelligent ambitious young man; loved and cherished by his family and friends. Stephen was 18 & murdered 31 years ago today in an evil, malicious, unprovoked, racist attack. Decades of failures, corruption, incompetence and institutionalised racism has seen two out of the six accused convicted. If this is still the outcome today in 2024, it certainly goes without saying huge transformations for the betterment of society are still to be made. -We need to combat and eradicate racism. -We require assurance in the priorities of holding police accountable for their actions or lack there of. -The police & CPS need to do everything they can possibly do as a collective, to bring as much justice and closure as possible for Stephen, his family and friends and all of us as a society. ⚖️ Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere⚖️ 2. Take Direct Action - What happened to Stephen, his family and friends has directly influenced me as a person, my outlook and interests and the work I have done and aim to do in the future. I decided to go university to study Sociology and Criminology due to what happened to Stephen. With a somewhat simplistic and naive yet pure and innocent intention, of ''getting the bad police out of the police force''. More recently, I have changed my career path into Law to work towards my goals, to eventually achieve such changes. 3. Contemplation - Today I think about the times that I've worried and cried over the years, thinking about what happened to Stephen and others, and wondering whether someone or a group of people, would do the same to my brother or my dad. Randomly thinking about times that I've only ever been pulled over by the police when driving with my friends, who happen to have brown or black skin. Remembering as a child, my dad telling a police officer \"this is the tenth time your lots pulled me on this road this month!... I live here.\" - Only when the officer saw me (a very light skinned child sitting in the passenger seat looking confused) did his tone and attitude change towards my dad. To hearing my dad's experiences of recent times of\" No blacks, No Irish, No dogs\" (my dad being a brown/black Nigerian & white Irish man with a thick Dublin accent), and growing up in Ireland as a Catholic brown child during the 1960s. To recalling the utter heartbreak of my dad breaking down in tears one night due to the trauma of years and years and decades and decades of \"it\". Of Racism. -Its tiring, it's exhausting and every single one of us owes it to human kind to change this. 4. Celebrate our uniqueness and who we are with love and appreciation - -Shout it from the rooftops! -Celebrate our cultures, who we are, where we originate. Today I celebrate my Nigerian heritage, being a princess Anyanwu by blood, of Owerri Imo State and my Great Grandfather the Ebo Chief."
