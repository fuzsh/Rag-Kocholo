I’m going to be in church.\"\n\nClifton Henry Dennis Jr. can recall spending countless evenings as a young boy huddled together with his family around their vintage radio, gospel music spilling forth from its speakers.\n\nForget about television. Music was the only form of entertainment the boy ever needed.\n\nDennis grew up in, what he refers to as, a gospel household. For him and his close-knit family, it was church every weekend — Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\n“My friends would ask me, ‘Cliff, are you coming to the dance on Friday?’ I would be like, ‘Yeah, I think I’ll come,’ knowing goodness well I’m not going to any dance. I’m going to be in church,” Dennis said.\n\nAlthough Dennis’ exposure to gospel music began in church, it would resume at home where, outside of the church’s four walls, he and his family would sit together for hours on end and listen to some of gospel music’s greatest singers belt out songs about their passion for Jesus Christ.\n\nBoth sides of Dennis’ family are musically talented, he said. Thus, music has always been a big part of his life.\n\nIn addition to music, he has always been infatuated by the radio.\n\nAnd now, at the age of 50, the Newark native hosts his very own radio show on Delmarva Public Media radio station WESM 91.3 FM – \"The Gospel Train.\"\n\nKeeping 'the legacy of Sunday morning gospel on 91.3' alive\n\nDennis took over for the show’s previous host, Gregory Handy, who became sick and later died in 2019. Prior to his passing, Dennis would visit Handy’s home to assist his friend in any way that he could. Over the course of this troubling time, the future of \"The Gospel Train\" was up in the air.\n\n“(Handy) always said that he wanted to bring me over to the station to meet everyone, but he passed away before we could make that transition,” said Dennis, who sat down to create a demo before he was later hired.\n\nDennis produces the entire show at his very own home studio, and the show is then streamed from WESM headquarters located at University of Maryland Eastern Shore in Princess Anne.\n\nThe host is happy to share that he coming up on his one-year anniversary with Delmarva Public Media in March.\n\n“I wanted to keep the legacy of Sunday morning gospel on 91.3 going by someone who knows the area, knows the people,” Dennis said. “That’s how my path ended up here.”\n\nMusic plays a big part in most individuals' daily lives.\n\n“It has a lot of control,” Dennis said. “Music can make you mad, music can make you sad, music can make you happy. Music can take you through a sea of different emotions.”\n\nIt warms his heart to know that someone, somewhere, is out there listening to his show and the music he has meticulously chosen to play.\n\n“I try to make a plate that everyone can eat from,” he said. “You’ll hear traditional gospel music, you’ll hear contemporary gospel music, quartet gospel, southern gospel and contemporary Christian music.”\n\nReaching out to listeners with love and laughter\n\nEvery hour from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Sunday mornings, listeners are guaranteed to hear music that anyone and everyone can relate to, the host said.\n\n“Any color, old folk, young folk – I try to make it so that everybody can get something from the music that I play,” Dennis said.\n\nAccording to Dennis, you can reach more people with love and laughter above anything else.\n\n“I try to make people say, ‘Well, instead of listening to Yolanda Adams on Spotify, I’m going to listen to Cliff on the radio station because the songs he’s playing, the way that he talks, I just love it,’” he said.\n\nBLACK HISTORY:Ocean City festival brings big soul, R&B acts to resort as tribute to Martin Luther King\n\nGOSPEL MUSIC:'Grandfather of Gospel': Eastern Shore birthplace to commemorate the Rev. Charles Tindley\n\nDuring his show, Dennis gives shoutouts to listeners, including birthday salutes, and also speaks about featured musical artists, song choices, and the overall history of gospel music.\n\nExploring the deep, rich roots of gospel music\n\nGospel music has a rich history and can be credited as the backbone to all music. Over the years, it has influenced popular forms of music including hip hop, rock and roll, and blues.\n\n“Gospel music is a true foundation to all music. As far as vocal arrangements, musical arrangements and lyrics, it plays such a big part in music, period,” said Dennis, who believes it's important to pay tribute to the trailblazers. “You always want to remember the people who built the bridge in order for you to cross it.”\n\nThe roots of gospel music began in the 17th century and emerged through religious experiences within African American culture, according to BeliefNet. It reemerged in the 1920s out of a confluence of sacred hymns, spirituals, shouts, jubilee quartet songs and black devotional songs, as reported by Oxford Bibliographies. Song lyrical content can be devotional, testimonial, inspirational, social justice oriented or evangelistic.\n\nBLACK HISTORY:Buffalo soldier's family land in Wicomico being rediscovered, reimagined into trail\n\nONE FROM THE WESM VAULT:Meet the morning jazzman\n\nDennis makes an effort to play legendary songs from the Golden Age of Gospel, which took place roughly between 1945 to 1975, on his show. Yet, he also reminds his audience that they should not be surprised if they hear a song that isn't necessarily gospel music.\n\n“I believe in God, that’s my core belief. That’s what helps me through my life,” he said. \"But good music is good music, and if it has a message then it can coincide with the message of the Gospel.\""
