        "text": "CORRECTION: An earlier version of this report incorrectly spelled the name of Dana Whitehair, general manager at Delmarva Public Radio.\n\nCorrine Dennis pays just more than a dollar a year for television programming she doesn't watch.\n\nSo she sees no need to ponder a proposed Trump administration budget cut that pulls $445 million in federal funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The lion's share, or half of the corporation's federal appropriation goes to local public television stations like Maryland Public Broadcasting, which on weekdays delivers educational children's shows from wee hours of the morning to past noontime.\n\nDennis operates a state-licensed family child care home near Princess Anne, where electronic devices are turned off, she said, as part of a licensing agreement that prohibits TV-watching when children are in her care.\n\n\"I'm not allowed to have the TV on for children or adults when children are there,\" said Dennis, who hosts an average six to eight children weekdays. \"Whatever I want them to learn, education-wise, I've got to put it on paper.\"\n\nThe way she figures, CPB cuts make sense if a huge chunk of public television viewers can't watch.\n\n\"I remember when MPT had 'Reading Rainbow,' and there was a show that taught a different language â€” kids learned numbers in a foreign language,\" Dennis recalled. \"That's the problem, why they are cutting the budget.\n\n\"If kids can't watch, that's probably why the federal government is cutting it,\" she also said.\n\nOperators of public radio outlets on the Lower Shore see proposed cuts differently. Some $15.6 million of the federal appropriation to CPB supports public radio stations. They include National Public Radio-affiliated WESM-FM at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore in Princess Anne; and at Delmarva Public Radio's WSCL-FM and WSDL-FM at Salisbury University.\n\nRELATED: Coast Guard budget cuts bad for Delmarva, officials say\n\nThe effect on local stations\n\nNews of proposed cuts hit as spring membership drives kicked off at local radio stations. Station managers are calling fundraising campaigns the toughest in their history.\n\n\"This is perhaps the first time in my life that there is a Republican president and both houses of Congress are controlled by Republicans,\" said Dana Whitehair, general manager at Delmarva Public Radio. He was referring to the Republican party's longstanding criticism of federal funding to CPB.\n\n\"We are not trying to be Chicken Little, and crying that the sky is falling,\" Whitehair said. \"But we are taking this very seriously; we must be prepared. Some in Congress believe that money would be replaced by private funds.\"\n\nDelmarva Public Radio opened its spring membership drive with an appeal to listeners to dig deeper for support dollars, warning of federal cuts that could slash popular National Public Radio programs like \"All Things Considered\" and \"Fresh Air,\" Whitehair said.\n\nGrants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting make up about a third of the operating budget at WESM, or 91.3 FM, at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, said interim station manager Brian Daniels.\n\n\"Without funding from the CPB, it would be virtually impossible for WESM to purchase programming or maintain equipment,\" he said.\n\nThe station at UMES launches its spring membership drive April 1. This time the drive extends from weeklong to monthlong, Daniels said, pointing at the urgency to raise more.\n\n\"We will be spending the month asking listeners for financial donations to keep not only programs they love on the air, but also to facilitate\" other goals, Daniels said. \"With the real possibility of severe budget cuts recommended by the Trump administration, the success of this year's membership drive will be more critical than ever.\"\n\nNational Public Radio stations on the Lower Shore also include WAMU, or 88.5 FM, at American University in Washington and Ocean City. In all, there are close to 1,300 locally owned and operated public broadcasters supported financially by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nREAD MORE: What the Shore would lose if NOAA's Sea Grant program is axed\n\nThe outreach of campus-based public radio is far beyond NPR programming and music, Daniels said of the Princess Anne station whose music format is jazz-rooted.\n\n\"Listeners depend on WESM-FM for fact-based and unbiased public service journalism,\" he said, naming a laundry list of station offerings. \"WESM has trained UMES students interested in production and other aspects of radio broadcast. There are currently plans to work closer with students.\"\n\nLocal stations are waiting to measure potential cuts on membership drives. The more money raised locally, the more financial help comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Whitehair said.\n\n\"If we are able to prove that a lot of listeners are dedicated and willing to support us financially, not only does that increase dollars through CPB, the more that give, the more leverage we have with other funding,\" he said.\n\n\"We can go to businesses and say, 'We have 4,000 people who donated to the station. Wouldn't you want to join them,'\" Whitehair said.\n\nThe average cost per American for CPS is a reported $1.37, and Dennis says the value of educational public TV pales against the meager cost to taxpayers.\n\n\"There's a show on MPT with a lot of songs on there,\" she said. \"I thought it was a benefit to the kids.\"\n\nMORE BUDGET IMPACT: Black colleges take 'devastating hit' in Trump budget\n\n410-845-4641\n\nOn Twitter@DTDeborahGates"
