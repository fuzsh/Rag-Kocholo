        "text": "Sharing his secrets for a fulfilling marriage, both from Scriptures and from his 25 years with fellow actor Chelsea Noble, Kirk Cameron is teaching married couples across the United States the value of God-centered and lasting marriages in his ongoing national marriage tour \"Love Worth Fighting For.\"\n\nThe famous Christian actor and evangelist encourages husbands and wives to know and carry out their respective biblical duties first, instead of taking their partners' roles. He lays out biblical guidelines to make marriages work and inspires hope for struggling ones.\n\n\"A lot of people don't know that marriage comes with instructions,\" Cameron explained when asked about God's guidelines in an interview with The Christian Post. \"And, we find them right there in God's word,\" he added.\n\nCameron firmly holds in his teachings that reading the Bible as divine instruction book is truly indispensable. Husbands and wives strengthened by God's word are ready to make their marriages last.\n\nHe even reminds husbands and wives to obey the primary command that God's word shows, especially in dealing with their spouses.\n\n\"[Husbands are called by God] to love their wives and not to tell their wives that they need to submit to them,\" Cameron emphasized in his interview with The Christian Post. \"Wives are to honor and respect and follow their husbands' lead â€“ not to tell their husband how he ought to be a better husband,\" he continued.\n\n\"When each person gets their part right, regardless of how their spouse is treating them, there is hope for real change in their marriage,\" Cameron also shared.\n\nIn a Facebook video posted last month, he also encouraged parents to love and to be godly examples to their children. He stressed that the quantity and quality of time parents spend with their children is very important. Cameron spoke from his personal experience of having six children, two of whom he recently took to the prom."
