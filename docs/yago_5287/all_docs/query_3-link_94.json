        "text": "Kirk Cameron, an actor and Christian evangelist who gained fame as a teenage heartthrob on the ABC sitcom “Growing Pains” from 1985 to 1992, will be at a Topeka church next weekend for the latest stop on his “Love Worth Fighting For” tour, where he will encourage husbands and wives to double down on their commitment to each other and their families.\n\nThe event will run from 6 to 9:30 p.m. Saturday, June 4, at Light of the World Christian Center, 3301 S.W. Gage.\n\nIn a recent phone interview, Cameron said the “Love Worth Fighting For” tour began a year after the hit 2008 independent movie “Fireproof.” The movie, in which Cameron had a starring role, tells the story of reconciliation between a couple whose marriage was on the brink of divorce.\n\nThe message of “Fireproof” obviously struck a nerve, as the movie was wildly popular with Christian audiences — evidenced by the fact that it grossed about $32 million despite having production costs of only $500,000. As such, it was the top-grossing independent film of 2008.\n\nChristian singer-songwriter Warren Barfield, who sang the theme song for “Fireproof,” joins Cameron on the “Love Worth Fighting For” tour.\n\n“We’ve been doing this for the last seven years,” Cameron said, noting the “Love Worth Fighting For” program has been presented in more than 200 cities across the United States. “It’s been going strong ever since the movie ‘Fireproof.’?”\n\nAt the first event, Cameron said, some 9,000 people attended. Since then, crowds of about 2,000 show up to hear Cameron and Barfield speak on the importance of maintaining and strengthening their marriage.\n\n“Nobody wants to fail at family,” Cameron said. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim, a Hindu, an atheist or if you’re black or white. Nobody wants to fail at family.”\n\nDuring the program, Cameron said, “we get together and laugh together and talk together and pray together. People receive inspiration about their marriage, and they find out there’s hope for everyone.”\n\nBarfield gets the evening rolling, playing tunes by the likes of James Taylor, Bill Withers and even some he penned himself.\n\n“Then we talk about marriage, and we have lots of fun with throwback videos of ‘Growing Pains’ and ‘Fireproof,’?” Cameron said. “We talk about ancient wisdom, about how to love your husband and your wife over time, so that marriage gets better over time, not bitter over time. So it’s a few hours of singing, of laughing, of learning together, and being inspired to fight for what matters in your life — and marriage should be at the top of that list.”\n\nCameron said people didn’t need to feel self-conscious about attending “Love Worth Fighting For,” as if doing so was somehow an admission of being a failure at the marriage game.\n\n“I think some people might think, ‘If I go to a marriage conference like this, maybe I’m admitting I need help,’?” Cameron said. “But that’s not how I see it. I know what the event is — it’s an awesome date night with your wife. You’re gonna laugh, sing and have a great time. What you’re saying is ‘My wife is worth it, my husband is worth it. I want my marriage to be strong.’\n\n“It’s not an admission of being weak. It’s an admission of ‘My marriage is worth it and I’m going to fight for it.’ ”\n\nCameron, 45, has been married since 1991 to Chelsea Noble, his girlfriend on “Growing Pains.” The couple has six children, four of whom were adopted.\n\nBesides keeping his foot in acting, primarily in Christian-themed movies such as the “Left Behind” series, Cameron in recent years also has worked with fellow evangelist Ray Comfort on “The Way of the Master,” a program that featured man-on-the-street interviews about the existence of God. That program formerly aired on the Trinity Broadcasting Network.\n\nCameron said his latest project is “Revive Us,” a one-night event that will be shown live in 1,000 movie theaters across the nation on the night before the final presidential debate.\n\nFormer presidential candidate Ben Carson will be among those appearing with Cameron on the “Revive Us” program.\n\n“People think we are in the last days of America,” Cameron said. “Is it too late? No, it’s not too late. It’s not impossible to turn it around, but there’s no time to wait any longer. We are nearing the point of no return, but we’re not there yet. But we must lean in, double down and engage ASAP because we’ve been coasting for too long.”\n\nTickets for “Love Worth Fighting For” are $22.50 and $35, with tickets for groups of 10 or more $20 each. VIP tickets are $50 and include early admittance, a private backstage question-and-answer session and front-of-the-line access at product tables.\n\nFor more information, visit www.loveworthfightingfor.com.\n\nContact Phil Anderson at (785)\n\n295-1195 or @Philreports on Twitter."
