She is known for her role as Kate MacDonald on the television sitcom Growing Pains (1989–1992). She is the wife of her Growing Pains co-star, Kirk Cameron, and the sister-in-law of Full House star Candace Cameron Bure.\n\nContents\n\nKirk Cameron and Chelsea Noble talk about how we can use technology to make a difference\n\n1990 commercials chelsea noble clarion\n\nEarly life\n\nCareer\n\nPersonal life\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\n1990 commercials chelsea noble clarion\n\nEarly life\n\nNoble was born Nancy Mueller in Cheektowaga, New York, to Irene and Fred Mueller. Noble graduated from Maryvale High School and then attended SUNY Geneseo from 1983 to 1987, where she was a member of Phi Kappa Pi (Alpha Clionian) sorority, and played women's rugby.\n\nCareer\n\nNoble appeared in a 1997 episode of Seinfeld entitled \"The English Patient\". She co-starred as Hattie Durham in the Left Behind trilogy with her husband Kirk Cameron. She also had several uncredited cameos in films starring Cameron as a \"kissing double.\" Kirk Cameron refused to kiss any woman who was not his wife, so for romantic scenes the actress playing his love interest would be replaced by Noble in an appropriate costume and filmed from a distance or behind.\n\nIn 2014, she co-starred with her husband in the independent movie Mercy Rule, playing a married couple with two children. Although not the first movie in which they have played husband and wife (having done so in two Growing Pains TV movies), this is the first time she has been credited as Chelsea Cameron.\n\nPersonal life\n\nChelsea and Kirk met when he was visiting Candace on the set of Full House They dated in real life and got married on July 21, 1991 in Cheektowaga, New York. They have six children. Their four adopted children are Jack (born 1996), Isabella (born 1998), Anna (born 1999), and Luke (born 2000). Two biological children, Olivia (born 2001) and James (born 2003), followed.\n\nNoble and her husband are born-again Christians. They founded The Firefly Foundation, which runs Camp Firefly, a summer camp that gives terminally ill children and their families a week's free vacation.\n\nFilmography\n\nActress\n\n2014\n\nMercy Rule (Video) as\n\nMaddie Miller (as Chelsea Cameron)\n\n2005\n\nLeft Behind III: World at War as\n\nHattie Durham\n\n2004\n\nGrowing Pains: Return of the Seavers (TV Movie) as\n\nKate Seaver\n\n2002\n\nLeft Behind II: Tribulation Force as\n\nHattie Durham\n\n2000\n\nThe Wonderful World of Disney (TV Series) as\n\nKate MacDonald-Seaver\n\n- The Growing Pains Movie (2000) - Kate MacDonald-Seaver\n\n2000\n\nLeft Behind: The Movie as\n\nHattie Durham\n\n1998\n\nYou Lucky Dog (TV Movie) as\n\nAlison Taylor\n\n1997\n\nSeinfeld (TV Series) as\n\nDanielle\n\n- The English Patient (1997) - Danielle\n\n1995\n\nKirk (TV Series) as\n\nElizabeth Waters\n\n- Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave: Part 2 (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave: Part 1 (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Balducci Blues (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Something's Got to Give (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Hire Learning (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Strangers in the Night (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- She Stoops to Conquer (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Yours, Mine & Ours (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- For Whom the Wedding Bells Toll: Part 2 (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- For Whom the Wedding Bells Toll: Part 1 (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- The Beach House (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Operation Kirk (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Baby, You Can Drive My Car (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Hey, Hey We're the Hartmans (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- The Odd Couple (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Stuck on You (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Double Date (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- The Love Letter (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- The Spare (1996) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- The Christmas Show (1995) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- A Kiss Is Just a Kiss (1995) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Kirk Unplugged (1995) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Educating Kirk (1995) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Helloween (1995) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- The Crush (1995) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Smart and Smarter (1995) - Elizabeth Waters\n\n- Mango Man vs. Capt.
