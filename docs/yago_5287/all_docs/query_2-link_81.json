        "text": "Kirk CAMERON of “Growing Pains”. GP. E GYP T. PY RAM ID. Mathemathics of are you “PI”ous Religious and Horney to make Money.\n\nKirk Cameron and Chelsea Noble are a VERY PIOUS couple. When Chelsea was younger with Dark Hair, she looks very much like CONNIE PECORARO.\n\nCHEL”SEA” NOBLE is about “OCEAN” and Mother MARY statue on Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica across the street from the FAIRMONT Miramar Hotel. There is another Fairmont Hotel on NOB Hill in San Francisco across the street from GRACE CATHEDRAL. The reason why Sandra Oh who is “CRIST”ina Yang on “Grey’s Anatomy” is set in Seattle GRACE Hospital in Washington.\n\nIt’s why Connie Pecoraro does Oil paintings of CHANDELEEEEEERS, because she is a Virgo the Mai”DEN” EARth Sign and she want Daniel Ladinsky’s book “the GIFT” to have meaning for her and her CATHOLIC Church theme OIL paintings.\n\nThey’ve been building this for 3 decades based on MY FAC from 1982, and MY First name SIGNature with an “AS”terisk, to them the 3AR sound of “ASS”terisk “OO”.\n\nKirk Cameron is best known for his role on “Growing Pains” as MIKE SEAVER. MIKE is about the writings I wrote in 1982 “KEY to my Soul” about Lee Harcourt Montgomery. They’ve been building for 3 decades based on MY Writings and MY FAC from 1982, to have meaning for them through Connie Pecoraro’s CATHOLIC Church theme. There is a SEAVER Drive in PEPPERDINE UNIVERSITY, which is a CHRISTIan School and closely connected to GEORGE C PAGE who came to California for the ORANGES. It’s about MY Childhood picture of me and my Father with the Hawaiian Barrel and the B ASKE T of Oranges. George C PAGE is about the TAR PITTS Museum on Museum Rowe on Wilshire Blvd. TAR is “RAT” backwards which is about the movie BEN, the reason why I did the drawing of BENSON DUBOIS in 1982. TAR goes on the ROOF and the ROOF is about the picture of me sitting on the ROOF in 1985. PITTS is about the meaning of “PI” symbol of Mathemathics based on MY childhood pictures in Santa Monica in there are you “PI”ous and Horney to make Money. The reason why there are TWO Streets in Santa Monica with the name CHELSEA and the reason why there is a street called EUCLID because the PI symbol definition is defined in terms of the Euclidean theory in Mathmathics.\n\nChel “SEA” is connected to SIGNtology TOM CRUISE MAPOTHER and SEA ORGS. It’s connected to Josh Wolf aka Jesus CHRIST, who is a regular on ChelSEA Handler TV Show. EVERYTHING THEY’VE BUILT IS BASED ON THE EAR SOUND OF WORDS. Which is connected to DENIAL LADIN”SKY” and his poem “The EAR that was sold to a fish” in his book “The GIFT”. The reason why next to MOTHER MARY statue in Santa Monica at the Fairmont Hotel is a restaurant called “FIG”. What’s Missing? “T” is for TAO, Tom Bridges the TAO TE Ching on BRIDGEWAY.\n\nTom Cruise is in many movies with CAMERON Diaz. “CD” which is about Callon Drive Topanga, everything goes back to this address because Lee Harcourt Montgomery lived there many decades ago. CAMERON is about the word CAMERA, as in CANON Powershot Camera. It’s about MY Childhood picture of me sitting on a CANON in SANTA MONICA, the reason why in “The LAST SAMURAI” there were Firing CANONS. CANON is connected to CANON Drive in Beverly Hills, where Josh Wolf’s agency Parallel Entertainment is. CAMERA is about the MAC computer, and about EAR sound of words. It’s about ERAGON, as in CHRISTopher Paolini and his Mythical dragon like creatures books. Dragons are about the LONG TAIL of my First Name SIGNature on the drawing of BENSON DUBOIS.\n\nThey’ve been creating for 3 decades through Other People’s names, Business names, MAPPING of Street names, anything and everything through WORDS, so that MY IDENTITY and MY ARTWORK can seem AS IF it was Done by Connie Maria Pecoraro, REAL LIFE PSYCHO and a PARASITE."
