It also seemed so strange. ::)\n\nSubject: Re: Whatever happend to Kirk Cameron?\n\nWritten By: Webstor\n\nHe married his onscreen girlfriend Chelsea Noble.......then he got pretty conservative as far as his religious beliefs go.\n\nWe have a religion-type channel on our cable system and every once in a while I see that Kirk Cameron show is on there....and he is speaking openly about his religious beliefs and its almost like he's preaching to people.\n\nKinda weird....\n\nSubject: Re: Whatever happend to Kirk Cameron?\n\nWritten By: lizjagger\n\nYes, he's very christian. I had such a crush on him during the 80s and early 90s.\n\nSubject: Re: Whatever happend to Kirk Cameron?\n\nWritten By: Mushroom\n\nHe has been a driving force behind the movies based on the book series \"Left Behind\". Both his wife and himself are involved, and they have released 3 movies so far. The most recent is Left Behind: World At War, and features Louis Gossett Jr. playing the President of the United States.\n\nSubject: Re: Whatever happend to Kirk Cameron?\n\nWritten By: Donnie Darko\n\nDon't care. I like his sister Candace. :-*\n\nSubject: Re: Whatever happend to Kirk Cameron?\n\nWritten By: Tom Cruise is a Dork\n\nVery religious and reminds me of other very religious celebs like Tom Cruise, though he's a scientologist ...\n\nSubject: Re: Whatever happend to Kirk Cameron?\n\nWritten By: Chris MegatronTHX\n\nI remember Kirk Cameron's status as a teen idol was already on the skids by 1989, and something of a has been by 1990. I say that because I distinctly remember him hosting a Back to the Future special in 1990 and thinking, \"hey why'd they pull this guy out of the mothballs?\".\n\nKirk Cameron's peak year of popularity was 1987. Back during 1986-'88 this guy was considered the sh*t by all the girls at my school. They wouldn't shut up about him. From what I heard, he started acting like a real nutball on the waning years of Growing Pains, saying that everything on the show was a sin against God, which likely contributed to his decline in popularity...even before the 80s were over.\n\nSubject: Re: Whatever happend to Kirk Cameron?\n\nWritten By: stingr22\n\nYes, as stated here, Kirk Cameron is a devout Christian. So many people treat that as if it's a bad word. I was never a fan of his growing up. Now I respect him for being vocal about what he believes. He doesn't try to beat you on the head with a Bible, but does share his faith if you're interested in hearing about it. This is how all people of faith should be. You can have a belief without trying to beat others up with it. OK, enough of the soapbox! 8)\n\nAnyway, if you want to see what Kirk's up to these days, check out his website: http://www.wayofthemaster.com/"
