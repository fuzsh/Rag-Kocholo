        "meta_description": "Listen to this episode from Pardon the Mess with Courtney DeFeo on Spotify. This month, Pardon the Mess is focused on things we love, and we’re thrilled to have Kirk Cameron on the show to talk about family, marriage, faith, and raising kids. That pretty much covers all the things we love! Kirk is best known for his 1980s portrayal of Mike Seaver in the sitcom Growing Pains. Since that time, he’s continued to act, direct, and produce films primarily in the context of his Christian faith. He’s married to Chelsea Noble (who portrayed his girlfriend on Growing Pains) and together they have six children. Kirk visits with us today about his social media documentary, Connect, and his takeaway that we need to be relentless in connecting with our kids. We’re the first generation to raise kids with social media, and it’s important to stay current with technology and focus on our communication with our kids. My favorite part of the interview is hearing Kirk’s heart behind why he continues to share his faith so publicly. He wants to hear the Lord say “Well done” at the end of his life, and that motivates him to continue to use his platform to tell others about his faith. He’s currently touring the country with a message that focuses on resetting our living rooms by pursuing God in our families. Kirk is relatable, funny, humble, and godly. This is a podcast you’re going to love! P.S.
