And I said, 'How could I forget -- she was beautiful and sweet and amazing.' And she said, 'Well she's even more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside. She's been here for a few days and I just want you to know that if you ever meet a girl and you get married, I hope she's someone just like her.' And four years later, I married her.\""
