        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Former \"Growing Pains\" TV sitcom star Kirk Cameron, now a high-profile Christian evangelist, prides himself on his role as husband and father.\n\nAs he did a telephone interview from the hills outside Los Angeles, he was driving his Jeep to a bait shop to buy worms for a fishing trip with his three sons, Jack, Luke and James. \"Hopefully we'll catch some catfish and bass,\" he said. \"It's kind of a man day.\"\n\nAfter catching fish, Cameron was about to catch a flight to Alabama. He's been on the road touring with a Christian marriage seminar, \"Love Worth Fighting For,\" which stopped at First Baptist Church of Opelika on Friday and will be in Birmingham today at Metropolitan Church of God, and at Decatur Baptist Church on Sunday.\n\nThe seminar is an outgrowth of Cameron's acting role in \"Fireproof,\" which turned into the most successful independent movie released in 2008 with gross ticket sales of more than $33 million.\n\nAlthough he's still one of the most recognizable faces in TV sitcom history and was nominated for Golden Globes for his work on \"Growing Pains\" from 1985 to $?'92, Cameron had to audition for the church production, which didn't offer a salary. It was done by Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Ga., where media pastor Alex Kendrick and his brother, Stephen, had gotten the church into movie producing with \"Flywheel,\" which they made for $20,000 and turned into DVD sales of more than 36,000. \"Facing the Giants\" grossed more than $10 million at the box office in 2006 and sold more than 1 million DVDs. \"Fireproof\" was made with a budget of about $500,000. Cameron portrayed a Georgia firefighter struggling in his marriage.\n\n\"So many people saw that movie and resonated with the message,\" Cameron said. \"We've turned that into a live experience. It's really a date night for married couples.\"\n\nSinger-songwriter Warren Barfield, who did the music for \"Fireproof,\" will sing at the marriage seminar.\n\nCameron is married to his former \"Growing Pains\" co-star Chelsea Noble. They have six children, two biological and four adopted. \"I share stories from my own experience,\" Cameron said. \"Warren does the same.\"\n\nCameron said he tries to help couples get \"a deep heart overhaul and leave with a gospel-centered understanding of marriage.\"\n\nThe \"Love Worth Fighting For\" tour covers 20 cities this year. Next year there will be a 30-city tour, Cameron said.\n\n\"It's a worthwhile thing,\" Cameron said. \"I just love it. Marriage means a lot to me. Whether people have a great marriage, or it's hanging by a thread, on the verge of falling apart, they will hear things that bring hope. Marriages don't fail. People fail, if they fail to follow the instructions that marriage comes with. It's about selfless love. It's what Jesus was about, the cross, coming to serve, not to be served, dying to self.\"\n\nCameron said the event helps build relationships through faith.\n\n\"We have a time to pray together,\" he said. \"People leave with tears in their eyes and smiles on their faces, holding hands, with a renewed sense that their marriage is worth fighting for.\"\n\nTickets are $25 per person at the door for today's seminar at Metropolitan Church of God, 2800 Metropolitan Way at the Acton Road exit of Interstate 459. The program starts at 6 p.m. and ends at 9:30 p.m. The schedule is the same on Sunday at Decatur Baptist Church."
