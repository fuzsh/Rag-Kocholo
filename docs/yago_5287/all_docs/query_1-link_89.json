        "text": "Emma and Cooper Perry didn't know quite what to expect Sunday afternoon as they made their way into Eastmont Baptist Church to hear the \"Love Worth Fighting For\" event.\n\nThe Prattville couple married in June and are still in the \"newlywed\" phase, Cooper Perry said. What they got was a heavy dose of the biblical view of marriage, mixed with plenty of humor and music.\n\n\"Marriage is work, we've seen that with our parents and friends who have been married longer than us,\" the 24-year-old engineer said. \"I think we are looking for ways to prevent any rough times cropping up.\"\n\nKirk Cameron, star of the 1980's sitcom \"Growing Pains\" and the 2008 film \"Fireproof,\" brought the marriage program to Montgomery. He was joined by musician Warren Barfield, who wrote the theme song for \"Fireproof.\"\n\n\"We got the movie on Netflix a couple of nights ago to get an idea what it was about,\" said 23-year-old Emma Cooper, who is planing on going to law school in the fall. \"Even though we knew what it was about, it was very sad in some parts when they were talking seriously about getting a divorce.\"\n\nIn the film, Cameron's character and his wife are having marriage problems and their union is only saved after he turns his life over to Christ.\n\n\"Everybody needs help with marriage,\" Cameron told the packed sanctuary. \"Some of you were drug here against your will by your wives. Some of you bought tickets for your wife. Your marriage is already better.\"\n\nCameron and his wife, Chelsea Noble, have six children. Selfishness is the root of most marital strife, Cameron said.\n\n\"The heart of your marriage problem is your heart, not your spouse's heart,\" he said. \"God and His power are the only cure for a selfish heart. I only have the power to change one person's heart.\"\n\nHis message hit home for Pam and Mark Little, a Montgomery couple that have been married 31 years.\n\n\"There is a tendency after you are married for a long time to let the little things bother you too much,\" Mark Little said. \"You have to maintain that respect for each other if you want to stay married and stay happy.\""
