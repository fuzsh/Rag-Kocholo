        "text": "Kirk Cameron was educated on the set of ABC’s “Growing Pains,” a sitcom in which he played teen Mike Seaver between 1985 and 1992. His girlfriend, Kate, on that popular TV show was played by Chelsea Noble, who became his wife in 1991. Cameron is not yet 40, but he and Chelsea have seven children and he’s become an evangelist, as well as an actor. Next weekend Cameron, will be at New Promise Church in Kirtland, where he’ll speak at the 10 a.m. worship service on Jan. 10. The prior evening, he’ll be on hand for the 7 p.m. screening of “Fireproof,” a 2008 film in which he starred. He also had the leading role in the “Left Behind” movies and is co-host of “The Way of the Master” TV series. Cameron’s appearance and the film will kick off a six-week “Fireproofing Your Marriage” series, which will be framed around video clips from the film and discussion. The series takes place at 10 a.m. on Sundays until Feb. 21. In “Fireproof,” Cameron stars as Capt. Caleb Holt, a fireman locked in a failing marriage who accepts his father’s challenge to take part in a 40-day experiment designed to teach husband and wife the true meaning of commitment. New Promise Church, 8671 Kirtland-Chardon Road, has 1,000 seats for people who want to come and has printed more than 800 tickets, to be sold at $6 each on Saturday. “That should help us pay for our advertising,” said the Rev. Dale Diggs, pastor. “We’ve been promoting this everywhere, and we hope to attract many couples who are thinking their marriage is in trouble.” Diggs, who has a degree in psychology, has done Christian-based counseling for couples for more than 40 years. “What I do is mostly crisis intervention, and I meet with them for one hour, four or five times, and give them some homework to do in between. If they won’t do it, then I won’t see them anymore. If they need more counseling after that, I refer them to a professional marriage counselor.” A healthy marriage is a lot about commitment, he said, and faith is an asset. “When you learn to accept the love of the Lord, who loves you unconditionally, you realize that marriage is about an unconditional commitment to an imperfect person,” he said. “Once you start coming with conditions for that commitment, that negates love.” Many years of helping with troubled marriages has led Diggs to conclude that the most dangerous years are the first year, the seventh year and the 25th year, he said. “The first year is always very difficult, by the seventh year you’ve begun to take each other for granted and by the 25th, the children are gone and you’re now faced with looking at each other every day,” he explained. In this economy, he’s met many couples who believe they can’t afford a divorce so they choose to live in hatred. “Many people stay in marriages for the wrong reasons,” he said. He asks couples to commit to working on one thing at a time, starting with communicating about ways your wife or husband can tell you she/he loves you. “I tell them it’s important to have a date night once in a while — just the two of them doing something they both enjoy,” he said. “I also ask them to formulate a budget together and then stick to it.” Many people seem to think money is the biggest problem and that they need more of it. “But I’ve seen people with $300,000 incomes not be able to live on it, and I’ve seen those with $15,000 incomes learn to live with what they have.” With almost every couple, one person is a better spender, and the other is a better budgeter, he said. Working on a budget together teaches about compromise and commitment. “It’s the process that’s important,” Diggs said. Even among Christian couples, he sees many who put their children ahead of their spouse — another mistake. “Children are better off when their parents put each other first,” he said. One big change he’s seen among couples deciding to split is that these days, it’s more often the woman who decides the marriage is over. “In the past, it was almost always the man,” he said. Cameron, who was booked through an agency, hasn’t shared the topic of his talk on Sunday morning, but Diggs believes it will follow the theme of the film — saving a marriage. “Our goal is to reach hurting couples in this community and help save their marriages,” he said. He’s hoping that Cameron can help with that goal.
