        "text": "Twenty-five years ago, Kirk Cameron broke the hearts of teenage girls everywhere when his character, the charmingly mischievous Mike Seaver, proposed to his on-screen girlfriend on the final episode of \"Growing Pains.\"\n\nPlaying the part of the future Mrs. Seaver was actress Chelsea Noble, who went on to become the real-life Mrs. Cameron.\n\nSix children and a quarter century of married life later, Cameron is touring the country with his national marriage event tour, Love Worth Fighting For. It stops at Northwood Temple on Ramsey Street on Saturday.\n\nCameron spoke to The Fayetteville Observer ahead of the tour's stop in Fayetteville. Here are excerpts:\n\nObserver: What exactly is a marriage tour?\n\nKirk Cameron: I did a movie several years ago called \"Fireproof\" that really resonated in the hearts of married couples everywhere, and we turned the movie into a live experience. It's a combination of music, humor, personal stories, movie clips and then some deep biblical teaching and counseling on the subject of fireproofing your marriage. It's a home-run date night for couples to strengthen their marriage, and in six years we've brought this event to about 150 different cities all across the country.\n\nObserver: That must have been quite a film to inspire a six-year tour.\n\nCameron: So many couples saw that and said, wow, I feel like someone put a camera in our living room. That's us, and I would love to have happen in our marriage what happened for this couple.\n\nSo we're taking the principles of the movie out of the film and bringing it to life for couples in an environment that's free from distractions, that's fun, funny, filled with music and a time to concentrate on their most important relationship.\n\nObserver: What are the principles you hope to convey?\n\nCameron: Great question and of course this takes me three or four hours. But one of the overarching things is that we understand that no one goes to the altar to say 'I do' thinking this whole thing is going to end in a bitter explosion. Nobody wants to fail at family. We want people to leave here believing that love and marriage is worth fighting for. We fight for lots of things. We fight for jobs, for promotions and we fight for money, but what if we put all that energy into fighting for what really matters. We want to give couples a new perspective on marriage - put wind in their sails, and tools that will help them fight for the victories that are waiting on the other side of their battles.\n\nObserver: What was it about the film that resonated with couples, do you think?\n\nCameron: I think couples - they so want their marriage to work, especially if you have kids. When you have these little people looking up at you, looking for guidance for life and people don't want to fail at that. I think it's also the chance to hang out with Mike Seaver for an evening and also with the team that put \"Fireproof\" together. I've met people who have tattooed the \"Fireproof\" logo on themselves and have like movie posters up in their house because that movie, and that love there, was so significant to them. It was a real turning point in their relationship so I think it's a chance to connect with those things.\n\nObserver: So Mike Seaver makes an appearance?\n\nCameron: Yes, he does. There might be a Mike Seaver sighting. It's kind of a 1980s blast through the past nostalgic session.\n\nObserver: Is your wife on tour with you?\n\nCameron: No, she's not, she's fighting for love back here at the house with our six kids. ... But I've got a great movie I'm making with my wife and kids that should be coming out later this year or early next year.\n\nObserver: What is your take on the growing industry of faith-based films?\n\nCameron: It's an interesting thing to see. If you do a little research you'll find out that the quote-unquote faith community was always the front-runner when it came to the arts. Think of Mozart, think of Beethoven, Michelangelo, and think of the church leading Handel's Messiah. That's the way it always was because people felt that their motivation was for something so much higher than anything else. They were doing this to honor the almighty so it inspired them to great levels of excellence. That sort of went away in more recent times and now it seems to be a novel thing to see a movie like \"Fireproof\" or \"God's Not Dead\" or \"War Room.\" And I think we're going to see more and more of these kinds of films. Not because Hollywood is warming up to the idea of faith in God as much as it is this stuff makes money.\n\nObserver: I just heard \"Fuller House\" was picked up for a second season. Might we be seeing a Cousin Steve cameo soon?\n\nCameron: You know, that might happen. Someone asked me if I thought \"Growing Pains\" would get a reboot, and they suggested the title \"Aches and Pains.\" I was trying to figure out if I should be offended by that or not.\n\nStaff writer Brooke Carbo can be reached at carbob@fayobserver.com or 486-3523."
