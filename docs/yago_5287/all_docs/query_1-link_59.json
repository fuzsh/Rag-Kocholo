        "text": "How do you write a series about nothing? Steven Koren, an alum of the \"Seinfeld\" writers' room, shared some insight on the process.\n\nMel Magazine recently published an oral history on the creation of \"Seinfeld\" character Izzy Mandelbaum (Lloyd Bridges), an elderly fitness buff who lives in the same Delca Boca Vista community as Jerry's patients. Mandelbaum's debut is one of three storylines in the episode \"The English Patient.\" The others involve Elaine being singled out as the one person who doesn't enjoy the eponymous film and George being mistaken for an attractive woman's (Chelsea Noble) boyfriend.\n\nKoren, writer of \"The English Patient,\" was interviewed for the feature. He didn't recall much of how he pitched the episode itself, but he was able to share how writing for \"Seinfeld\" differed from other series he worked on. For context: Koren got his start on \"Saturday Night Live\" and has since followed...\n\nKirk Cameron has produced a new documentary about parenting children in the technology age, with a focus on social media.

Nowadays, Cameron is an evangelical Christian focusing on faith-based projects, and he didn’t make many friends in progressive Hollywood when he spoke against same-sex marriage during an interview with Piers Morgan on CNN four years ago. The father of six just signed on as host for 30 episodes of The National Bible Bee Game Show from Enthuse Entertainment\n\nread more...\n\nKirk Cameron has nothing but love for the Duggars.\n\nIt's a match made in religious heaven.\n\nGrowing Pains star Kirk Cameron, an outspoken born-again Christian, attended Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald's wedding in Bentonville, Arkansas Saturday, and expressed that he would like his own daughters to follow the conservative example of the famous Duggar family.\n\nCameron, 44, and his wife, fellow Growing Pains star Chelsea Noble, 49, have six children together, four of whom are adopted.\n\nVideo: Kirk Cameron Reminisces on Meeting Wife\n\n\"We flew to the Duggar hometown, not only to be part of the fun and excitement of honoring this precious couple, but as a father, I want my daughters to see what it looks like when a couple reserves their 'first kiss' for at the altar,\" he posted on Facebook. \"This kind of moral excellence and purity is rare today, but our sons and daughters are priceless.

Holy … well, you know. The “Ghost Rider” star is currently in talks to front a remake of the “Left Behind” movie series, based on the bestselling series of novels by Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins. A post-apocalyptic franchise of sorts, it chronicles the world post-Rapture, with all the “good” people having gone to Heaven to be with God, leaving all of us bad sinners behind. Shoulda repented when you had the chance, sinners! There were three moderately budgeted films in the series starting with 2001′s “Left Behind”, starring Kirk Cameron (of “Growing Pains” fame), his wife Chelsea Noble, and Brad Johnson. I found all three films to be entertaining enough, even though I’m not “of the faith”, as it were. Then again,...\n\nKirk Cameron, Left Behind Kirk Cameron: Gays 'Unnatural' – Plus Cameron's Banana Video As for Kirk Cameron, he hasn't had a very fruitful film career, as the vast majority of his work has been restricted to television. During his Growing Pains heyday in the '80s, Cameron was seen in only a handful of mainstream releases, all but one box-office bombs — e.g., Douglas Day Stewart's romantic drama Listen to Me (1989), opposite Jami Gertz, and the Robin Williams-Kurt Russell comedy The Best of Times (1986). The second phase of Cameron's film career is comprised of a few movies geared to Evangelical Christian audiences in the United States. In Vic Sarin's Armaggedon-themed Left Behind (2001), Cameron plays television journalist Buck Williams, described by the New York Times' Stephen Holden as \"the most golly gee-whiz young journalist to appear since Jimmy Olsen stalked Superman.\" For all his naiveté, Williams uncovers...\n\nIt’s going to be hard to top the onslaught of lunacy that Celebrity Wife Swap contestants Ted Haggard and Gary Busey and their respective significant others brought to the table during last night’s absolutely bonkers episode. No one brings the crazy quite like Busey. While Flavor Flav and Dee Snider will do their best to protect the sanctity of marriage and reality television during next week’s episode (though Snider should try and save up some of that energy for his upcoming stint on The Celebrity Apprentice… just ask Busey), there’s plenty of other stars who would...\n\nHe's used to getting love letters and high-fives as a former teen heartthrob, but onetime Growing Pains actor Kirk Cameron isn't letting the mockery and criticism dissuade him from promoting his controversial project to dispute evolutionary theory. \"Atheism has been on the rise for years now, and the Bible of the atheists is The Origin of Species,\" Cameron tells People. \"We have a situation in our country where young people are entering college with a belief in God and exiting with that faith being stripped and shredded. What we want to do is have student make an informed, educated decision before they chuck their faith.\n\nSo far, we know that Kirk Cameron doesn't understand bananas, logic, or metaphors. Following his appearance on The Today Show this morning, we can now add \"acting\" to the ever-expanding list of things that Kirk Cameron doesn't understand. From MSNBC: In Kirk Cameron’s new movie, “Fireproof,” he has to kiss the actress playing his wife. That was a problem. Cameron will not kiss any woman who is not his wife. “I have a commitment not to kiss any other woman,” the former child star of “Growing Pains” told Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford Monday on TODAY in New York. \"Even in acting, you're still doing it.\" To get around the conflict, the filmmakers employed a bit of movie magic, Cameron explained. They dressed his wife, actress Chelsea Noble, like the movie’s female lead and shot the scene in silhouette. ..."
