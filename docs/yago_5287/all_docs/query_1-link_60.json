        "text": "Former child star Kirk Cameron is receiving major backlash for giving unsolicited marriage advice to The Christian Post. The Christian evangelist told the publication that married women should do whatever their husbands ask because \"God's word\" tells them so.\n\n\"Wives are to honor and respect and follow their husband's lead, not to tell their husband how he ought to be a better husband,\" he said. \"When each person gets their part right, regardless of how their spouse is treating them, there is hope for real change in their marriage.\"\n\nHe added, \"A lot of people don't know that marriage comes with instructions. And, we find them right there in God's word.\""
