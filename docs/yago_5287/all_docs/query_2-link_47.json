        "text": "With two people so in love as \"Growing Pains\" co-stars Chelsea Noble and Kirk Cameron, what better place to have a wedding than Cheektowaga?\n\nThey had company. Up to 800 spectators jammed both sides of Union Road on Saturday afternoon to catch a glimpse of the famous pair as Noble, 26, a Cheektowaga native, and Cameron, 20, ducked fans, paparazzi and passers-by to exchange vows in Our Lady Help of Christians Catholic Church.\n\nThe ensemble included the tabloid photographer who piously appeared dressed as a priest at the church in hopes of eluding the 45 plainclothes security men. Another photographer tried -- also without success -- to hide in the church's confessional.\n\nHundreds of screaming fans stormed Union Road when Noble emerged from the white stretch limousine. These same law-abiding citizens shouted at the driver of an 18-wheel truck that lumbered by at the same moment Noble entered the church, blocking their view.\n\nHollywood had come to Cheektowaga.\n\n\"They were hoping to keep it private,\" publicist Tom Estey said of the famous couple. \"This is sacred to them. They're ecstatic.\"\n\nSomebody goofed. The couple announced their engagement on \"AM/Buffalo\" in January but kept the day quiet hoping to avoid the crush of fans. Then the New York Post publicized the wedding date.\n\nThen at the 4 p.m. Mass Saturday the priest told the congregation of a \"big wedding\" following that service.\n\n\"Leave the day to them,\" he said. \"Please go home.\"\n\nThe congregation did. Hundreds others came.\n\nThe wedding itself was closed to the public. Fans winding around the church got a look at the arrival of the bride -- the former Nancy Mueller of Huth Street.\n\nThey stayed 90 minutes more, waiting for a promised news conference in the church grotto.\n\n\"I couldn't have been happier,\" Irene Mueller, Noble's mother, said standing outside the church after the wedding. \"We tried to keep it as traditional and normal and as down to earth as possible.\"\n\nBut the hundreds of fans cheering outside the church was about as normal as the tornado that struck Cheektowaga four years ago.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"How was the wedding?\" a reporter asked Cameron during the press conference.\n\n\"Great,\" he said, giving reporters the thumbs up sign.\n\nEstey, the couple's publicist who looked as nervous as any bride, kept calling out \"No questions\" to the reporters.\n\nThe new bride, dressed in a floor-length white dress with a pearl-embroidered bodice and a floor-length veil, smiled and flashed her diamond ring for the cameras and fans.\n\nAmong those straining to hear were reporters and photographers representing German and Australian publications.\n\n\"There are many people over there very interested in this,\" said Glen Mitchell, a Los Angeles-based correspondent working for Women's Day of Melbourne, Australia. \"The show is a major hit.\"\n\nBut the people toting video cameras and ignoring security guards' instructions felt they had greater stock in the couple than any stranger.\n\n\"Chelsea was at my sister's graduation,\" Barbara Donnelly said. \"I've been here since 1:30 -- we saw them put the canopy up at the wrong church.\"\n\n\"Her mother comes to the bakery where I work, and she wouldn't even tell us where they were getting married,\" said Esther Netzel, a self-confessed \"Growing Pains\" fan.\n\nSome kept perspective.\n\n\"Last week, I saw a wedding here with a horse and buggy, and the horse had a hat with flowers on the top,\" said Angie Kokoszka, also of Cheektowaga. \"The bride and groom went to the car and sat in the window pouring champagne and drinking from a glass. This was plain.\"\n\nKelly Crean stood on a Bronco truck used for crowd control to get a picture of the bride, her former Maryvale High School classmate. Unlike others who buzzed about following the white stretch limousine to secret reception location -- the Park Country Club -- Mrs. Crean had other plans.\n\n\"Right now, I'm going to the mall,\" she said.\n\nWhatever else happened, Cameron did look ecstatic as he held his bride's hand and escorted her through the grotto. The honeymoon site is unknown.\n\n\"That's it,\" Estey said, finally managing a smile.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
