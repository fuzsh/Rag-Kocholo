        "text": "By Jeffrey Dransfeldt of the Ventura County Star\n\nThere is no woman Kirk Cameron wants to kiss other than his wife, Chelsea Noble.\n\nHis long-held belief that he has lips only for her has cost the former \"Growing Pains\" star numerous roles over the years, but it also has provided peace of mind and it has strengthened his marriage of 17 years.\n\n\"We believe that marriage is to be honored above all things,\" Cameron said, \"that there is not a thing in the world that is going to be more important to me than my wife's heart and that I try very, very hard to love her, honor her, protect her and all those things.\n\n\"Some people may be into that; some people may think it's too much work,\" he said, \"but my highest calling in the world is to be a husband and a father to my kids, so I just put a lot of priority on it and my wife does, too.\"\n\nThe easygoing actor sat down last week at the Beverly Hills Four Seasons Hotel to proudly discuss his new film, \"Fireproof.\" Out today in limited release — including at the Century Stadium 16 theater in Ventura — the moral tale centers on a couple struggling to find hope in their failing marriage.\n\nAt 37, Cameron, who lives in Agoura Hills with his wife and their six children, looks remarkably like he did in his teenage years, playing Mike Seaver on the iconic family sitcom \"Growing Pains,\" which ran from 1985-92 on ABC.\n\nThe actor has had a busy year, also publicizing his new autobiography, \"Still Growing.\"\n\nIn his latest film role, Cameron plays firefighter Caleb Holt, who is a hero at work, where he saves the lives of others, but back at home sees his marriage with his wife, Catherine (Erin Bethea), falling apart. They fight over jobs, finances and housework and struggle to see why they married in the first place.\n\nCaleb deals with an addiction to Internet porn, while Catherine flirts with another relationship at work.\n\nChallenging himself\n\nAs Caleb considers entering divorce proceedings, his father asks him to hold off and asks him to commit to the 40-day experiment called \"The Love Dare.\"\n\nCaleb reluctantly agrees, but seeing how it's tied to his parents' newfound faith, he grows less enthusiastic. He tries to regain his wife's affection but is continually rejected.\n\nHe begins to break through only when he makes a commitment to love God and starts understanding through his faith what it means to love his wife.\n\n\"Most love stories in movies are kind of about this unlikely person meets that unlikely person and there's chemistry and there's fireworks and it's a story of the obstacles until they finally get together; that's your crescendo,\" Cameron said. \"This story starts 10 years after the honeymoon is over.\"\n\nThe spark may have dimmed; love may have been replaced by anger, bitterness and frustration. So, Cameron asked, do you simply give up?\n\n\"Or,\" he said, \"you can turn around and say: Wait a minute. Maybe I got the whole wrong idea of what this marriage thing is. Do I really understand what love is?' And can a couple who has seemed to have lost it get it back again? Can they fire it back up to the point where they would still say, I'd do all over again'?\n\n\"I find the movie very, very inspirational,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Cameron's co-star Bethea is not married herself, she gained insight from Cameron and his successful marriage to Chelsea.\n\n\"Marriage is obviously a pretty big issue in our culture right now and people not taking marriage seriously,\" Bethea said. \"It's sort of become this, Well, if it works out, it works out; if it doesn't, we gave it a shot,' instead of being what it is meant to be, which is a lifelong commitment that you make work regardless of your situation and you try to work through it.\"\n\nBethea, who works at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., was cast first and learned later that she would be starring alongside the former teen heartthrob. Now 26, she was a little young, she said, to get drawn into the huge fan following for \"Growing Pains\" and admits she was more of a fan of Kirk's actor sister Candace Cameron (whose last name now includes Bure) from her time on \"Full House.\"\n\nBethea quickly moved past any intimidation she initially felt from working with Cameron and he became a friend and colleague.\n\nFor a final romantic scene, Bethea stepped aside and Chelsea, who is a similar height and size, kissed her husband while in silhouette. It allowed Cameron to stay true to his conviction of only kissing his wife.\n\nOpening up\n\nCameron had a busy spring publicizing his autobiography, \"Still Growing.\" The book shared insights into his life and his family. It also gave Cameron the opportunity to shatter misconceptions people may have had, whether it was about his relationship with Chelsea, the cast of \"Growing Pains\" or any other gossip that has circulated over the years.\n\n\"I didn't really feel that I needed to get anything off my chest as much as I knew people were interested,\" Cameron said. \"E! True Hollywood Stories' and everybody else were putting their spin on Kirk Cameron Born Again!' and Fighting with Cast Members.'\n\n\"I'm learning all this stuff about myself I never knew,\" he said. \"So this is the chance for me to kind of give people the real story, the real behind-the-scenes inside story that was really the true version of it.\"\n\nCameron became a national name and a regular fixture on teen magazines because of his role as Mike Seaver on \"Growing Pains.\"\n\n\"I have great memories of Growing Pains' — some of the most fun memories of my whole life: the practical jokes that we'd play on the set to each other and all the great times that we had,\" Cameron said. \"All of our problems got worked out in 27 minutes and 45 seconds.\n\n\"They were like my real-life family in a lot of senses,\" he said. \"I spent more time with them than I did with my own mom and dad and brothers and sisters during those years.\"\n\nCameron, who as a young star bought his first home in Simi Valley, now years later has found comfort living in Agoura Hills with his family, including his six kids, ages 5 to 11. It is outside the glare of Hollywood, plus he can have his chickens and enjoy fresh eggs.\n\n\"There's kind of a country feel to it,\" he said. \"You're not in the heart of the city, in the rat race. It's close to the beach. It's in the mountains. It's just kind of away from the Hollywood scene, which is where I'm acting, and Ventura (County's) so great like that. It's a lot less stressful than in the (San Fernando) Valley or in town.\""
