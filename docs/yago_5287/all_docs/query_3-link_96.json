        "text": "In 1985, ABC aired Growing Pains, introducing the Seaver family of Long Island, New York, to primetime television. For seven seasons, fans were thrown into the family's hysterical drama. But after 166 episodes, the beloved sitcom came to an end.\n\nNow, it's time to learn where the Seaver family and their friends wound up after the final episode aired. From marriages, children, and other projects, here's where the actors are now.\n\nThen: Kirk Cameron\n\nKirk Cameron might have been acting in little projects before Growing Pains, but the sitcom shot the child actor to stardom. In the series, Cameron played Mike Seaver, the troublemaker of the family.\n\nDuring this time, Cameron became a typical teenage heartthrob, appearing in various commercials, on the covers of magazines, and even on cereal boxes. But, as it turned out, Cameron only had eyes for Chelsea Noble, his Growing Pains girlfriend, and future wife."
