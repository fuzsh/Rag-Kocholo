        "text": "FIGHTING FOR THE CHILDREN\n\nKirk Cameron isn’t afraid to step into battle when it comes to fighting for our children. With events like \"See You at the Library\" and BRAVE Story Hours, he is teaching children biblical values. In his latest children's book, \"The Fox, the Fair, and the Invention Scare,\" which is the ninth book in the third Saga of BRAVE’s Freedom Island series, Kirk is giving families hope with a timely message of unity and compassion, especially in a world filled with division.\n\nWithin the pages, you’ll read about a young fox named Asher whose family has been disputing with a family of giraffes for years. When Asher, the Fox, and his peer and enemy, Stewart the Giraffe, come face-to-face at the town invention fair to compete, an accident causes both of their inventions to break. Scrambling to fix them before judging, Asher knows what Stewart’s invention needs, but he’s faced with the decision to help his enemy or watch him fail. He makes a courageous decision that changes the course of each family's hatred for one another for generations to come.\n\nThe idea for this book came from a personal experience Kirk witnessed while attending a “Restore America” rally. The audience heard from an older man and his wife about their gut-wrenching story of losing their teenage son who was shot and murdered by another young man in a gang. Their faith in God was the only thing that helped them survive the heartbreak. When the couple introduced a 20-year-old man to the crowd, he explained how, years ago, he got caught up in the wrong crowd, joined a gang, committed a violent crime, and was sent to jail. He said that one day, he was visited by this couple, only to find out they were the parents of the young man he murdered. They spoke to him about God‘s love, mercy, and forgiveness and told him that they forgave him. When he was released from prison, they adopted him.\n\nADVENTURES WITH IGGY AND MR. KIRK\n\nKirk and former Disney mom, actress Leigh Allyn Baker, are teaming up to create a children’s television show called Adventures with Iggy and Mr. Kirk. Imagine a live-action TV show that teaches solid morals, like a modernized Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood with high-energy hilarious dialog, animated stories, new surprise guest stars, and a puppet iguana co-star. Rather than focusing on confusing children with progressive ideas and themes of sexuality, this show is committed to teaching children the traditional and biblical values that will withstand time and build strong character for generations to come. This was a welcoming concept for the show's co-star Leigh Allyn Baker as she exited Disney and began speaking out about her intentions to align her work in entertainment with her values as a Christian just like Kirk when he starred in Growing Pains. The show is currently in production and set to air in August.\n\nCHANGED HEART\n\nKirk was not raised in a church-going home and described himself as an atheist from a very young age. When he was 14, Kirk had been working in the entertainment business for a few years and landed the role of Mike Seaver on Growing Pains in 1985. Within a few years, it was a hit show on ABC. (On the show, Mike eventually had a girlfriend named Kate MacDonald, played by Chelsea Noble, Kirk’s future wife!) Soon Kirk had everything he could want and as much money as he wanted to spend. He became a teen heartthrob, appearing on the covers of teen magazines, and was so convinced there was no God that he laughed at those who said there was.\n\nAll that changed one afternoon when he went to church and heard the Gospel for the first time. Kirk sat in the back of the church feeling very guilty. His heart was swelling with the hope that a God in heaven saw his sinful heart and would take the punishment for him, forgive him, and welcome him back into a right relationship with Him. A month later, Kirk, then 17, was sitting in his sports car and asked the Lord into his heart. He told a friend who was a Christian. That friend gave him a Bible which Kirk began to read. Kirk went on to star in many films but has since left mainstream film and television. He continues to work in faith-based productions."
