        "text": "By Movieguide® Contributor\n\nKirk Cameron recently played an adoptive dad in the faith-based movie LIFEMARK — a role that he could relate to with his real-world experience.\n\nCameron shared the story of his own adopted daughter’s first meeting with her birth mother.\n\n“My wife and I were thrilled when our daughter Isabella had the opportunity, this last Mother’s Day, to connect with her birth mother for the first time,” the actor explained.\n\nCameron shared that Isabella’s birth mother almost aborted her three times before realizing “that everything standing in the way of her abortion appointment was the hand of God, leading her to choose life for her baby girl.”\n\nThis past Mother’s Day, Isabella spent the day with her birth mother, and Cameron and his wife Chelsea couldn’t be happier.\n\n“It reads like a storybook,” he said of Isabella’s relationship with her birth mother. “She loves Bella. She loved her from the moment she chose life and placed her for adoption and now she loves Jesus, and they have a chance to share their whole story together.”\n\nCameron often talks about the power of adoption — four of his six children are adopted. Movieguide® previously reported:\n\nActor Kirk Cameron recently starred in LIFEMARK, a faith-based movie that celebrates faith, family the beauty of adoption.\n\nThe Kendrick Brothers movie made splashes at the box office, but Cameron revealed that the movie’s story had a special place in his heart.\n\nThe GROWING PAINS star shares six children with his wife Chelsea Noble, four of which are adopted.\n\n“This movie has so many themes in it that resonate with me as somebody who loves my family,” Cameron told Fox News Digital. “This is a movie that couldn’t be more beautifully and perfectly timed because here we are all just amazed that something so monumental occurred in our lifetime, the overturning of Roe versus Wade.”\n\n“And while the nation is just in a heated debate over this whole issue, there comes a movie rushing into theaters that celebrates the value of life in the womb, and the beauty of adoption,” he added. “The adoption option, I think, is such a loving, beautiful place, and I’ve experienced the result of that choice myself. Like I said, with our four kids, my wife is adopted, and if my wife had not been adopted, we likely would not have our two natural-born children either.”\n\nWhile LIFEMARK conveniently released just weeks after the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Cameron maintained that LIFEMARK celebrates life rather than focusing on the horror of abortion.\n\nOne of Cameron’s daughter’s, Isabella, had an opportunity to reconnect with her biological family.\n\n“Her biological mom was pregnant, scared, afraid and didn’t know what to do, was told that really she just needs to go have an abortion,” he shared. “She went down to the clinic, but got a flat tire on the way, missed the appointment, rescheduled. The second time, had a friend take her down, and they had car trouble, and she wasn’t able to make it. The third time, she didn’t have the money to pay when she went, so she was seeking for some government assistance.\n\n“The fourth time, she saw a cockroach crawling across the floor and over her foot and thought, ‘You know what, maybe this is some sort of a sign that I should rethink this.’ She did, and she placed Bella up for adoption. We adopted Bella. She is our beautiful, precious daughter who’s now an American Airlines flight attendant,” he added. “She got a chance to hear this whole story when she spent Mother’s Day weekend with her biological mother. Just this last Mother’s Day, Chelsea gave her blessing on the whole thing.\n\n“It’s just kind of come full circle, and pieces of the puzzle coming together to create this beautiful picture of God’s love and his providence. And he works all things together for good, for those who love him.”\n\nWhile today’s culture discourages parents from having children, Cameron said that he views them as a gift from God.\n\nHe believes “kids are gifts and treasures from heaven.”\n\n“I can’t think of anything that is more incredible than thinking that God somehow orchestrated for that mom who was scared and afraid, to have her trust that a good home could be found for her child,” Cameron said. “And while we were wanting to adopt a baby, all of that would come together to form our family and then reunite with her. That’s just mind-blowing to me. I think it’s incredible that God brings families together in all kinds of ways. And I’m just so thankful for those ladies out there who make the loving choice of adoption.”\n\nCameron and Chelsea proudly homeschooled their children, which brought with it even more challenges to their family.\n\nHowever, whether it is adoption, homeschooling, or working on their own marriage, Cameron said that they are grateful to God for his many blessings in their lives."
