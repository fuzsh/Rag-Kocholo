        "text": "Kirk Cameron went from being a loved Hollywood star to a \"Hollywood freak.\"\n\nCameron and his wife, Chelsea Noble, have raised their six kids in a Christ-centered home.\n\nCameron and Noble have been married for 31 years. The actor loves his wife dearly and won't kiss anyone other than her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKirk Cameron was a loved Hollywood star when he starred in the 1980s hit \"Growing Pains.\" He was a spunky and handsome teenager who many schoolgirls crushed on.\n\nThe actor's pop culture icon status diminished when he became an outspoken Christian. Cameron didn't take a similar path as many teenage stars in his days did.\n\nKirk Cameron in Los Angeles, California, in 1993 | Source: Getty Images\n\nMany Hollywood celebrities believe Cameron is too religious, as Hollywood scolds and mocks him for being a vocal evangelical Christian.\n\nThe actor's recent acting and directing projects hold profound Christian messages, which has made him unpopular in the eyes of his former fans. Cameron noted:\n\n\"I'm kind of a Hollywood freak. I didn't really turn out the way most people turn out growing up in this industry.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Cameron's statements and stands on sexuality have made him a darling among conservative Christians who love what he does in his personal and professional life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurprisingly, before Cameron welcomed Jesus into his life, he was an atheist raised in a family that never attended church. One day, he went to church with a friend's father, and as he has said many times, he realized he would end up in hell.\n\nThe 52-year-old said he couldn't kiss the actress because he had vowed \"not to kiss any other woman\" who wasn't his wife.\n\nThis awakening led to Cameron taking the Christian faith seriously, becoming born again, marrying one of his \"Growing Pains\" costars, and creating a family with her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho Are Cameron's Kids and Wife?\n\nCameron married his \"Growing Pains\" costar, Chelsea Noble after he got saved. The couple adopted four children and lived in Los Angeles, not far from the Hollywood sign.\n\nAfter adopting four kids, the pair had two kids together. Cameron and Noble's adopted kids are Jack Cameron, Isabella Cameron, Ahna Cameron, and Luke Cameron. The couple's biological children are Olivia Cameron and James Cameron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNoble said she was always passionate about adopting because she and her brother were adopted. She added that they chose to adopt before having their biological kids so that the adopted kids would know they were their first choice.\n\nThe pair formed a family quickly as they welcomed their kids, each having only a year apart from the next. Noble said she doesn't feel any different about her adopted and biological kids because she has a special bond with all of them that comes from God:\n\n\"It's been an incredible journey, we always said when they were, you sort of forget who is adopted and who is not adopted, it's like, it's your family.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCameron is a father to six kids in his multi-racial family and wants to protect his children. The actor said this when speaking about technology's effects on children.\n\nThe actor said his family is pro-technology. However, he advised families to set boundaries to protect their loved ones because of the many hours children and parents spend on technology devices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCameron has become an advocate for family and marriage and wanted to assist parents with ways to connect with their kids in a technology-driven world.\n\nThe actor's daughter, Isabella, once shared an emotional post on her Instagram, thanking her parents for raising her and her siblings in a Christ-centered home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsabella added that she adored her \"beautiful siblings\" and loved Cameron and Noble for opening their hearts and home and deciding to adopt:\n\n\"Jack, Ahna, Luke, Olivia, and James, I love you all so much…May our hearts forever be sweetly and completely entwined ❤️.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple's other daughter Ahna also celebrated Cameron on Father's Day. She said she was \"constantly proud\" of the actor because of his love for God first, followed by family, and then people.\n\nCameron and Noble raised their kids to love and understand each other by teaching them that God makes families in all different colors, sizes, and shapes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Is Cameron's and His Wife Love Story?\n\nCameron and Noble got married in 1991. They met on the \"Growing Pains\" set, where the two played boyfriend and girlfriend. The couple fell in love offscreen and tied the knot when Cameron was 20 and Noble 26.\n\nThe two have since been championing marriages built on God. The \"Fireproof\" star urged married couples to focus on their responsibilities rather than concentrating on what their spouses could be doing to improve their marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe explained that marriages come with instructions about what a husband and wife should do, \"and we find them right there in God's words.\" As per Cameron, husbands are to love their wives, while wives are to respect and follow their husband's lead.\n\nThe actor revealed that most contentious marriages arise because spouses blame each other for their marital problems instead of taking the blame for their own faults.\n\nChelsea Noble and Kirk Cameron at Westbury Hotel in New York City on June 28, 1886 | Source: Getty Images\n\nCameron has shown commitment to his marriage not just by words but through actions too. In 2008, while promoting his movie \"Fireproof,\" the actor said there was a scene where he was required to kiss the actress playing his wife.\n\nThe 52-year-old said he couldn't kiss the actress because he had vowed \"not to kiss any other woman\" who wasn't his wife. The filmmakers had to find a way to shoot this scene, so they dressed Cameron's wife as the movie's female lead and shot the scene in silhouette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs per the actor, when he kisses his wife behind the scenes, they become the same husband and wife who are just honoring their marriage. Cameron also revealed that he chose \"Fireproof\" because it's a movie that showcases his beliefs and because he loved his wife dearly.\n\nKirk Cameron and Chelsea Noble in Nashville, Tennessee, on May 31, 2015 | Source: Getty Images\n\nCameron and Noble have been married for 31 years now. The actor shared a cute throwback picture of the two in 2020 when they were celebrating their 29th wedding anniversary. He wrote:\n\n\"So thankful that after 29 years and turning 50, Chelsea still hasn't turned me in for a newer model! #grateful.\"\n\nKirk Cameron and Noble view marriage as a sacred and precious institution that should be cherished and celebrated. Despite the unfortunate trend of marriages breaking apart in our modern society, they believe it should be regarded as beautiful and remarkable.\n\nSubscribe to AmoMama on Google News!"
