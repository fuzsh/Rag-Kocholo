Others know him as the star of Growing Pains, as a character named Mike Seaver. Kirk Cameron made his mark as a child actor and since then, branched off to start a family of his own, eventually having six children in total with his partner.\n\nAfter starring in a number of 90s sitcoms, Kirk Cameron married actor Chelsea Noble, who also cameoed in a number of episodes of Growing Pains. It would be another five years before this couple adopted their first child together.\n\nKirk Cameron adopted four children and had two biological children\n\nAfter being married for five years to Chelsea Noble, the two decided to adopt their first child, their son Jack. According to Fabiosa, soon after that, the couple decided to take in three other children, Isabella, Anna, and Luke.

In fact, he oftentimes forgets “who’s adopted and who’s not.”\n\n“Adoption is so special. My adopted kids know that they’re in our family because we wanted them to be in our family. We chose them. That’s something special that every adopted child can know. They didn’t have to be adopted by their parents. They really wanted them,” Kirk Cameron said during an interview with People Magazine.\n\n“They’re just my kids. Literally, I forget who’s adopted and who’s not. It really doesn’t seem like that. They’re my kids, I’m their dad and Chelsea’s their mom,” he continued. “It’s just a great, wonderful way to not only have a family yourself but meet a real need in the lives of so many of these orphans.”\n\nEpisodes of Growing Pains are available for streaming on Amazon. Some episodes of Full House, including those featuring Kirk Cameron and Candace Cameron Bure are available for streaming on Hulu."
