        "text": "What inspired African Americans to leave their homes during the Great Migration?\n\nHistorians often explain migration as some combination of \"push-pull\" factors. Oppressive conditions at home like poverty, government persecution, military conscription, high taxes, systemic racism or lack of opportunity might be sufficient to persuade people to seek better conditions elsewhere. Likewise, economic opportunity, religious and political freedom, family ties or a desire for adventure could induce some to pack their bags for a new location.\n\nEnd of Reconstruction\n\nAfrican Americans in the 50 years after the Civil War responded to both push and pull factors. At the end of Reconstruction and federal oversight of southern states, white majorities resumed control of the government and enacted laws severely discriminating against African Americans. They were denied the right to vote or to serve on juries. Extra-legal, racially-motivated organizations like the Ku Klux Klan terrorized African Americans with threats and incidents of lynchings and other forms of violence. Schools and public accommodations were strictly segregated, and any African American who protested or failed to obey the restrictions ran the risk of retribution, legal or otherwise. The U.S. Supreme Court in Plessy v. Ferguson upheld the principle of \"separate but equal\" facilities, but the African-American institutions were never \"equal.\" African-American schools were in poor facilities with inadequate textbooks with poorly paid and prepared teachers.\n\nThe Great Migration\n\nAt the turn of the 20th Century, southern African Americans began moving North in larger numbers seeking a better living (pull) and leaving southern segregation (push). The rapid growth of northern cities like Chicago, Philadelphia, New York and Boston opened up new job possibilities and better schools. While they were often segregated, legally or informally, into African-American neighborhoods and denied the opportunity to live elsewhere, those neighborhoods often developed vibrant Black culture. The Harlem Renaissance produced outstanding music, art and literature in the 1920s.\n\nOn the other hand, African Americans faced push back from recently arrived immigrant groups who were also seeking jobs. The rapid growth of the cities put a premium on housing, and in this also, African Americans found themselves competing with other ethnic minorities. While African-American professionals might develop successful practices within the Black community, they rarely found their services welcomed in the larger society. As they had done in the South, African-American women found work as domestics, cooks and laundry workers. If white middle-class women rarely worked outside the home, economic necessity forced African-American women, married or not, to seek outside employment.\n\nLabor shortages in World War I created new opportunities for African-American workers, and the Great Migration picked up speed. African-American struggles did not end when they arrived in the North, but they did escape the entrenched segregation of the post-Civil War South.\n\nSupporting Questions\n\nWhy did African Americans migrate?\n\n\"Lynching Black People Because They Are Black\" by Frederick Douglass, April 1894 (Document)\n\n\"What a Colored Man Should Do To Vote\" Pamphlet from Virginia, 1900 (Document)\n\nIllustration from \"The Exodus,\" 1919 (Image)\n\n\"Great Migration Railroad Strike 100 Years Ago Brought an Influx of African-Americans to Waterloo\" Newspaper Article, February 1, 2011 (Document)\n\nWhat issues did African Americans face in the South in the beginning of the 20th century?\n\n\"Why Disfranchisement is Bad,\" 1904 (Document)\n\nGuinn v.
