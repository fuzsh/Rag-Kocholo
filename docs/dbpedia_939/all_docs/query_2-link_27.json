        "text": "Aspen has officially been awarded the Mountain IDEAL certification, a prestigious acknowledgment of the town’s dedication to sustainable tourism and environmental stewardship.\n\nThis distinction marks a milestone in Aspen’s history, placing it among the elite sustainable mountain destinations worldwide, alongside notable communities like Breckenridge and Vail.\n\nThis certification process, managed by Green Destinations, is the culmination of a collaborative effort involving the Aspen Chamber Resort Association (ACRA), the city of Aspen, Pitkin County, Aspen Skiing Company, along with various local nonprofits and individuals.\n\nSpanning several years, these partnerships have been pivotal in addressing the unique challenges of mountain sustainability — ranging from snow-related energy and water usage to preserving cultural heritage and managing seasonal resident needs, according to the city.\n\n“In 2022, we launched the Aspen Destination Management plan,” said Eliza Voss, vice president of Destination Marketing for the Chamber. “That had the goal of protecting the quality of life and the very reasons that people visit.”\n\nShe said part of this plan, and the requirements involved, led Aspen to pursue IDEAL. Under this plan, Aspen has focused on enhancing community resilience, preserving its quaint, small-town character, and improving the overall visitor experience.\n\n“It took two years to obtain IDEAL,” she said. “The first, Aspen completes 40 of the indicators towards this certification. In year two, there are an additional 60 indicators. For the full IDEAL standards, it is 125.”\n\nShe added that the Global Sustainable Council is the group that created IDEAL, and that is practiced all over the world.\n\nBobby Chappell, Mountain IDEAL program architect and board member for Green Destinations, emphasized the rigorous nature of the certification.\n\n“Aspen has demonstrated exceptional commitment, actively deploying over 50 best practices for sustainable destination management, a testament to their rigorous effort and dedication,” he said in a news release.\n\nThis strategic shift from destination marketing to management reflects a broader vision to balance growth with sustainability.\n\n“The Mountain IDEAL certification is a critical pillar of our destination management strategy,” Voss said in the release. “We are thrilled to be recognized for our efforts and continue to push the boundaries of what sustainability in a mountain town should embody.”\n\nThe certification process itself involved a detailed evaluation by Green Destinations in December 2023, where auditors reviewed Aspen’s sustainability practices, conducted interviews with key stakeholders, and assessed the impact of initiatives such as the Maroon Bells Comprehensive Management Group.\n\nThis group’s reservation system, hosted on ACRA’s website, was highlighted as a prime example of an effective public-private partnership addressing tourism pressures.\n\nMoreover, Aspen’s pro-active approach includes offering sustainability training and certification programs for local businesses through a partnership with Aspen, establishing the Colorado Green Business Network of Aspen as a regional partner to the state’s network. The program is set to launch in mid-August.\n\n“I think this certificate is a good baseline to assess where we all are,” Voss said, adding, “I do think, as a community, and the many organizations like SkiCo, city of Aspen, who are pushing beyond where the standard was.”\n\nShe said Aspen is pushing the level of excellence in sustainability, and it has always been a leader in this aspect. As Aspen moves forward, the town’s comprehensive efforts and strategic management are set to shape its trajectory as a model of mountain destinations.\n\nTessa Schreiner, sustainability manager for the city of Aspen, reflected on the community’s long-standing commitment to progressive climate action.\n\n“The Mountain IDEAL certification not only recognizes Aspen’s leadership, but also reinforces our continued commitment to setting a global standard in sustainability,” she said in the release.\n\nShe said that IDEAL reflects the city’s decades-long work that Aspen has put in to being a leader in climate action and sustainability.\n\n“Sustainability is a balance of economic well-being, social well-being, and environmental well-being,” she said. “For Aspen, that is especially important. Our small mountain town community is heavily reliant on the long-term solutions as it pertains to those three pillars.”\n\nShe said Aspen passed greenhouse-gas reduction emission standards that have been in place for a few years now and is a focus that Aspen will continue to work toward.\n\n“IDEAL, again, helps us to work in that direction with these new standards,” Schreiner said.\n\nThe city will be announcing a new business recognition and support program on Monday, Aug. 12, she added.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, Aspen was also recognized in the Green Destinations’ Top 100 stories.\n\nWestley Crouch covers the City of Aspen and general reporting for The Aspen Times.
