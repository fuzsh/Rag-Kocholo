Matthew recognizes that a broken food system points to underlying structural inequities for communities of color and low income people, where those neighborhoods with the least affordable, healthy, or local food options face the highest rates of economic insecurity and health disparities. Since moving to Sacramento in 2018, Matthew has worked closely with grassroots coalitions. For over 18 months, he’s gathered signatures, canvassed, and strategized with the Sac Kids First Coalition, aiming to establish a dedicated fund for youth programs in the city of Sacramento. In addition, Matthew organizes with Decarcerate Sacramento, a grassroots coalition that is re-defining public safety to emphasize well resourced, equitable communities and community-based systems of care, not incarceration. In Matthew’s eyes, freedom has many sides – until all young people have opportunities and programs to thrive, low income families have healthy food to eat, and communities of color are free from criminalization, then none of us are free. Matthew invites moments of joy throughout the day, but especially when he is nourishing relationships, playing the movement art of Capoeira, spending time in nature, and convening with social movements throughout Latin America.\n\nMelissa Campbell | Co-Partner, Garden Unidos and Organizer, North County Immigration Task Force\n\nMelissa is one daughter of five children born to and raised by parents from Barbados and Trinidad & Tobago.
