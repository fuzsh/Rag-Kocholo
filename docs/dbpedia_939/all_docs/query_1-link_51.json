Through authentic conversations, trusted messengers raise awareness, mobilize public support, and provide valuable insights that inform strategy and messaging.\n\nWe’re pooling resources and working together to serve the community in better ways. We’re sharing and bouncing ideas of what is working or not working. Our diverse outreach staff understand the language, understand the food, understand the connection, and the inclusive way to greet one another so everyone feels comfortable.”"
