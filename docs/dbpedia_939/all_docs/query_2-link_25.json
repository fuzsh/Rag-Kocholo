        "text": "The Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County, Virginia, on July 30, 2024, updated its Zoning Ordinance Work Program (ZOWP) for fiscal years (FY) 2025-2026. The Fairfax County ZOWP is a forward-looking work program that outlines the county's priorities for analyzing potential amendments to the Zoning Ordinance over the next two fiscal years. The ZOWP covers a broad spectrum of zoning-related topics, including affordable housing, climate resiliency, parking and short-term pop-up events. Its structure mirrors the board's priorities, with a two-year cycle and annual updates to help ensure the zoning ordinance amendments are responsive to the community's changing needs and goals. The program also underscores the necessity of monitoring and reporting on these amendments to gauge their effectiveness and maintain alignment with the community's objectives. Additionally, the ZOWP includes carryover from the FY 2023-2024 program, as well as new initiatives such as signage regulations, Accessory Living Units (ALUs) and Planned Districts, all of which reflect the county's commitment to addressing contemporary issues through zoning amendments.\n\nIt categorizes zoning initiatives by priority into the Priority 1 and Priority 2 categories. Within Priority 1, initiatives are further prioritized into various stages: First Tier, Second Tier, Pending and TBD. Amendments anticipated to be brought forward for discussion at a board committee meeting or for authorization within the first six months of FY 2025 are assigned to the First Tier, and those expected to be brought forward in the second half of FY 2025 are assigned to the Second Tier.\n\nOnce adopted, these zoning changes will impact future development applications in a multitude of ways. The ZOWP emphasizes the need for a methodical approach, including research and community outreach, as many zoning ordinance amendments require more than a year to complete. It is a testament to the commitment of thoughtful and responsive urban planning, helping to ensure that the work program continues to reflect the evolving needs of the community.\n\nZoning Ordinance Work Program for FY 2025-2026\n\nTIER 1:\n\nLight Utility Facilities (New)\n\nReview permissions and use standards for electrical substations in association with data centers and stand-alone.\n\nConsider establishing a Memorandum of Agreement with natural gas providers to provide notice of proposed new high-pressure gas distribution pipelines in certain rights-of-way.\n\nConsider establishing new use for energy storage.\n\nShort-Term Pop-Up Events and Longer-Term Interim Uses\n\nEvaluate current zoning regulations for 21-day special event administrative permit uses and longer-term interim uses, and consider ways to increase flexibility and remove unnecessary impediments and time limits.\n\nParking Rates\n\nEvaluation and consideration of new parking rates for accessible parking.\n\nContractor's Offices and Shops\n\nConsider possible zoning changes to permit expanded opportunities for suitable locations for landscape professionals and other Contractor's Offices and Shops, subject to use standards that address the storage of construction vehicles, construction materials and other impacts.\n\nTIER 2:\n\nPlanned Districts (New)\n\nReview the additional standards for commercial uses in the Planned Development Housing (PDH) District and the secondary-use standards, including percentage of residential uses, in the Planned Development Commercial (PRC) District.\n\nReview the exceptions for when a PRC Plan or amendment to a PRC Plan may be required, and consider expanding the types of minor improvements that would not require a PRC Plan submission, particularly as they relate to open space or community facilities.\n\nSign Amendments (New)\n\nEvaluate sign amendments to help ensure they meet current standards of aesthetics and safety.\n\nCongregate Living Facility (New)\n\nConsider expanding the districts where congregate living facilities are allowed, and broaden the definition to include additional support services such as an emergency shelter and supportive housing.\n\nAccessory Living Units (ALUs) (New)\n\nConsider changes to ALUs to provide more housing options, reflecting the growing demand for diverse living spaces.\n\nMONITORING:\n\nApplication Fees and Planned District Minimum Recreational Facilities Expenditure\n\nReview that application fees and the Planned District recreational facilities expenditure is on the agenda to make the process more efficient and equitable.\n\nClimate Action and Resiliency Initiatives\n\nConsider zoning changes that would incentivize and encourage more environmentally sustainable development.\n\nSupport implementation of the Community-wide Energy and Climate Action Plan (CECAP) and Resilient Fairfax.\n\nFloodplain Regulations (New)\n\nMake necessary updates to floodplain regulations for consistency with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maps to protect properties and mitigate flood-related risks.\n\nAffordable Housing Initiatives\n\nConsider zoning changes to promote affordable housing and support land use policies.\n\nConsider zoning changes and strategies to incentivize preservation of existing manufactured home communities.\n\nPRIORITY 2:\n\nNew Items Added to ZOWP:"
