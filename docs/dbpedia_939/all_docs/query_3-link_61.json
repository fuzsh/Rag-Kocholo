        "text": "Dear friends and future visitors of San Diego Community:\n\nOn Tuesday, June 4, 2013 the City Council of San Diego designated a stretch of public roadway and business corridor as a new district called, “Little Saigon.” What happened on that day is a culmination of more than five years of collaboration among local businesses, community organizations, neighborhood residents, and city government. On that Tuesday, we came together to write a new chapter in the history of San Diego.\n\nThis all started with a simple theory: By focusing on name-recognition, we brand the community and demonstrate that persistent efforts to improve a developing area can be accelerated once spontaneous excitement and individual pride are developed by local businesses and neighborhoods. With a detailed revitalization plan to serve the neighborhood’s structural and cultural needs, Little Saigon Foundation began addressing the concerns of fellow residents with a variety of programs developed by our new organization. The many gatherings we hosted, specifically our street clean-ups and festivals, became more than elements of a business model to create an official business district—they became the voice of a community. With the public designation now in place, this voice can speak two words proudly – Little Saigon - words that identify a vibrant force of culture, tradition, civic engagement, and opportunity.\n\nAfter the signs have been hung and the flag banners waved, Little Saigon will remain as a translated pronunciation of mixed cultures rich in history from our homeland, Vietnam, and America. We have worked to build the bridge of assimilation and unite two distinct nations into one vibrant region of America’s Finest City. Doing so has only been possible with the immense support of our friends—both the residents who lived in this area before the Vietnamese immigration, and the allies who have recently joined in support of a healthy, growing area. I would like to honor these esteemed organizations and individuals for working tirelessly to make our stretch of El Cajon Boulevard a clean, safe, and diverse locale for San Diego to enjoy.\n\nIn Vietnamese, the common phrase, “Gần mực thì đen, gần đèn thì rạng,” asserts that if you are near ink you will be in darkness, near light you will shine. Over the years, our community could find little reason to feel a sense of pride in dirty sidewalks or dark, unsafe neighborhoods. Now, as San Diego’s newest cultural neighborhood, we can finally enjoy the glow of public acknowledgment and mutual cooperation.\n\nHowever, there is still a long road ahead, with additional support needed for business promotion, facade improvement, and infrastructure revitalization, not to mention establishing a community center, and developing long-term programs for under-privileged youth. With the two bold words “Little Saigon” now rooted in San Diego’s history, the branches of our tree must expand to include all community groups, encouraging the flowers of our efforts to blossom.\n\nI humbly welcome you to a new beginning with the Little Saigon Foundation, to join us in our future plans and activities. Whether it is in the form of a lunch meeting spotlighting Vietnamese noodles, or a presentation of hanging delights at the Lantern Festival, we will continue to share, educate, and promote our newfound identity for generations both old and young. With the help of our friends, we can begin to shed light on this stretch of El Cajon Boulevard and shine together in the district we are proud to call Little Saigon.\n\nTo a brighter future!\n\nFrank Vuong\n\nPresident\n\nLittle Saigon San Diego Foundation\n\nWe celebrate the following leaders with gratitude:\n\nCouncilnember Marti Emerald\n\nCouncilmember/President Todd Gloria\n\nCouncilmember Mark Kersey and all other City Councilmembers\n\nCounty Supervisor Ron Roberts\n\nMayor Bob Filner\n\nFormer Mayor Jerry Sanders\n\nCongresswoman Susan Davis\n\nAssemblymember Marty Block\n\nCity of San Diego Human Relations Commission (Dannell Scarborough)\n\nCommunity Organizations\n\nCity Heights Area Planning Committee (Jim Varnadore)\n\nCity Heights Community Development Corporation (Cynthia Fargo, Sakara Tears)\n\nEl Cajon Business Improvement Association (Cường Nguyễn, Jackie O’Connor)\n\nHerbert Hoover High School (Principal Dr. Chuch Podhorsky)\n\nKensington/Talmadge Planning Group (David Moty)\n\nKing Hung Association (Hoạch Trần)\n\nLittle Tokyo Service Center\n\nLocal Initiative Support Corporation (Vicky Rodriguez)\n\nNguoi Viet Today News\n\nSan Diego Foundation (Felicia Shaw)\n\nSan Diego Registrar of Voters (Michael Vũ, Juanito Amor, Carmen Lopez)\n\nViet Tan Reform Party (Mai Lang Luông)\n\nTiếng Nước Tôi Radio (Nghĩa Trọng Trần)\n\nVietnamese American Chamber of Commerce (Sử Nguyễn)\n\nVietnamese Community of San Diego (Lực Nguyễn, Kim-Trang Đặng)\n\nVietnamese Student Association at SDSU\n\nRecent Grant Donors\n\nENGAGE San Diego\n\nLocal Initiative Support Corporation\n\nParker Foundation\n\nPrice Charities\n\nRecent Corporate Sponsors\n\nSDG&E (Risa Baron)\n\nState Farm (Mo Mahony)\n\nValley View Casino\n\nWeingart Foundation\n\nWells Fargo (Jack Toan)\n\nSmall Businesses\n\nBa Lẹ Restaurant (Thanh Trần)\n\nBelle Photo (Bảo Lai)\n\nCali Baguette Express (Thiện Phùng, Việt Phùng & Family)\n\nCaliland Realty (Sơn Thái Phạm)\n\nDanh Truong Medical Office (Danh Trương, M.D.)\n\nEl Cajon Family Medical Clinic (Sony Võ, M.D.)\n\nHoài Huế Restaurant (Hiệp Điệp & Family)\n\nIntelligent Care Medical Clinic (Lance Lê, M.D.)\n\nMinh Hoa Supermarket (Vũ Trần)\n\nNguyễn Nam’s Tax (Nam Nguyễn)\n\nPhở Ca Dao Restaurant (Huỳnh Thi & Family)\n\nPhở King Restaurant (Charlie Nguyễn & Family)\n\nSpecial Individuals\n\nÁnh Loan Nguyễn (Nails by Johnny)\n\nBeryl Forman (El Cajon Blvd Business Improvement Association)\n\nDan Hom (Focuscom Inc)\n\nDavid Châu (Cao & Pacello Law Group)\n\nĐình Thảo Lê (Hair Pros Barber Shop)\n\nGayle Hom (Price Charities)\n\nJim Varnadore (Friend of City Heights)\n\nLộc Nguyễn (Lộc’s Tax Services)\n\nMark Trần (Mid-City Community Advocacy Network)\n\nMichael Shefcik (Hoover High School)\n\nPaul Hoa Trần, Ph.D (Tran Consulting Engineers, Inc)\n\nPhong Huỳnh (Built Green California)\n\nQuỳnh Nguyễn (Center for Policy Initiatives)\n\nThiện Đỗ\n\nTrạng Tấn Lê (San Diego Beauty College)\n\nStaff and Volunteers\n\nAaron Nunez\n\nAnthony Bảo Trần\n\nAnya Kuzman\n\nBrett Landry\n\nCarla Warda\n\nCharlotte Riggert\n\nClaudia Duran\n\nCody Huff\n\nDavid Haskins\n\nGracelynne West\n\nJenee Maree\n\nKendrick Ton\n\nLisa Phan\n\nLương Long\n\nMalou Amparo\n\nMaggie Ikezaki\n\nMelanie Fritz\n\nMelisa Bourniquel\n\nMiss Queena Quý\n\nRomer Fajota\n\nNora Wallenius\n\nPhilip Phan\n\nSerena Ngô\n\nSusan Nguyễn\n\nTeresa Nguyễn\n\nTim Hoàng\n\nTommy Lê\n\nTommy Lee\n\nTrâm B.
