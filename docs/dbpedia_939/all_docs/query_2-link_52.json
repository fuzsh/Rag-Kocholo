The ERC was able to offer taxi drivers legal and technical support, consulting and building of resource networks that has resulted in thousands of in-kind professional services for the UTWSD.\n\nERC staff have also contributed to dialog, fair treatment, policy analysis, and legal advocacy for UTWSD. Together with the UTWSD we have helped to ensure that driver’s have a strong voice in the San Diego political arena and that their legal rights are protected.\n\nVisit the United Taxi Workers Website for More Information\n\nUnited Taxi Workers of San Diego Celebrate a Victory with ERC Interns Sarah Saez & Moni Kehinde\n\n[gn_jcarousel source=”post” link=”image” size=”150×150″ limit=”17″ items=”4″ speed=”400″ margin=”10″]\n\nCommunity Budget Alliance\n\nCPI and two dozen other local organizations joined forces early in 2012 to seek an understandable, open and fair budget for the City of San Diego. The Community Budget Alliance – including civic, environmental, faith and other community organizations – submitted a list of priorities and recommendations for the Mayor’s 2013 budget proposal.\n\nThe alliance is concerned that city resources be allotted equitably to neglected neighborhoods, and that city residents have early, meaningful opportunities to participate in designing the budget. The alliance outlined its priorities in a letter to the Mayor and City Council on Feb. 27, and proposed a set of values to guide budget decisions and a list of specificrecommendations.\n\nThe Mayor released the May Revision of the budget May 24. Among other things, there were increases to hours at libraries, police and fire academies, and money added to fund the Neil Good Day Center.\n\nMay 25 during the presentation of the May Revise before City Council, community members came forth to express their gratitude for the previous community meeting. Additionally, members of the Alliance reiterated unfunded community needs including: streetlights, investment in a youth development program and continued funding of the teen night program which serves to provide youth with crime-free alternatives.\n\nTo stay connected about Upcoming Events visit the CPI Online\n\nAlliance organizations\n\n1 in 10 Coalition\n\nAffordable Housing Coalition of San Diego\n\nAlliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE)\n\nBayside Community Center\n\nCenter on Policy Initiatives\n\nCoalition of Neighborhood Councils (CNC)\n\nEmployee Rights Center (ERC)\n\nEmpower San Diego\n\nEnvironmental Health Coalition (EHC)\n\nEquality Alliance of San Diego County\n\nInterfaith Committee for Worker Justice of San Diego County (ICWJ)\n\nJustice Overcoming Boundaries (JOB)\n\nLeague of Women Voters of San Diego (LWV)\n\nLittle Saigon Foundation\n\nMaximizing Access to Advance our Communities (MAAC) Project\n\nMid-City Community Advocacy Network (CAN)\n\nNAACP San Diego Branch\n\nProject New Village\n\nSan Diego Coastkeeper\n\nSan Diego LGBT Pride\n\nSan Diego Organizing Project\n\nSan Diego Unity League\n\nUnite HERE Local 30\n\nWalk San Diego\n\nA Better San Diego\n\nWhat is a better San Diego?\n\nWe are working to strengthen our local economy, put local people back to work, and provide every San Diegan with the opportunity to create a better life for themselves and their families.\n\nEvents\n\nA Better San Diego hosts a Breakfast Forum on a variety of economic issues on the 3rd Friday of every month at 8:00 a.m. Visit abettersandiego.org to find out the topic and location of this month’s breakfast forum.\n\nHow You Can Help\n\nTake the Made in San Diego Pledge\n\nEvery time you get a chance, pledge to:\n\nBuy products made in San Diego\n\nHire people who live in San Diego\n\nSupport San Diego neighborhood businesses\n\nShop where San Diegans are treated right\n\nSign Up and Stay Informed\n\nA Better San Diego encourages and offers opportunities for individuals to take action on important issues that affect our local economy, such as unemployment and job creation, workers’ rights, outsourcing, education, fighting corporate corruption, and retirement security.\n\nSign Up And Become A Member of A Better San Diego Today!\n\nTOGETHER WE CAN BUILD A BETTER SAN DIEGO!"
