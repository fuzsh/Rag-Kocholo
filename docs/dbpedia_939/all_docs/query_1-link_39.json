        "text": "About Us\n\nThe Reproductive Health Access Network mobilizes primary care clinicians nationwide to build power and expand sexual and reproductive health care advocacy and provision.\n\nThe Network pulls together over 8,000 primary care clinicians from all 50 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and Canada to come together virtually and in person to engage in advocacy, clinical training, and peer support. We organize nationally, through online listservs and in-person meetings at national and regional conferences and locally/statewide through the Cluster structure. The Network is open to any and all primary care clinicians, including, but not limited to: family physicians and residents, internal medicine physicians, nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, adolescent medicine and pediatrics, advanced practice clinicians, nurses, and others.\n\nMuch of the Network’s core organizing work is done through our local networks, called Clusters. These state-based groups meet two to four times a year and are led by clinicians from their respective communities. The Clusters aim to:\n\nBuild connections among primary care clinicians living in the same area, and create spaces for peer-to-peer support, clinical discussion, and training.\n\nSupport clinicians to organize within their professional medical organizations, such as the American Academy of Family Physicians, in order to ensure that teaching and advocating for sexual and reproductive health care are organizational priorities.\n\nSupport the integration of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion care where possible, into new sites and practices.\n\nEncourage clinician participation in advocacy and leadership development.\n\nPartner with state and local reproductive health, rights, and justice organizations to collaboratively advocate for protecting and expanding access to care, especially abortion care.\n\nWe also have three virtual national Clusters, for Internal Medicine physicians, Advanced Practice Clinicians, and Emergency Medicine clinicians.\n\nMore questions?
