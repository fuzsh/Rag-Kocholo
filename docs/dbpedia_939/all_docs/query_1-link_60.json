        "text": "Overview\n\nWhen young people are engaged in their communities, they become more connected to the world around them and feel a stronger sense of ownership over their futures. Youth programs support improving life outcomes for our youngest citizens and improving the quality of life in our city, neighborhoods, and families. Partnering with youth and providing opportunities for young people to grow in their leadership skills helps bring new perspective.\n\nYouth engagement programs like Job & Career Readiness Training and the Mayor’s Youth Employment Program empower students to learn about the world of work, make connections, and expand their future career opportunities. The Mayor’s Mentoring Alliance provides role models and programs to help young people develop the confidence and skill sets they need to succeed academically and in life.\n\nHNS also supports Generation Nation, which oversees the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Youth Council (CMYC). Through the CMYC, high school students meet regularly to advise CMS and community leaders, build civic leadership, and help to transform schools and the community for the better.\n\nMayor's Youth Employment Program\n\nThe Mayor’s Youth Employment Program (MYEP) provides all Charlotte youth with equitable career development opportunities to explore the world of work, build social capital, and enhance economic mobility.\n\nMYEP participants explore careers, hone skills, and gain exposure to models of professionalism, creating pathways to attainable career goals. As youth achieve, our community grows stronger.\n\nWe seek to build partnerships with host employers in Charlotte's economy's private, public, and non-profit sectors who can provide one-of-a-kind career experiences for MYEP participants. Businesses provide career experiences that help youth develop career goals, stay in school, achieve academically, and enhance social skills that enable them to succeed. Students connect to the work world, allowing businesses and communities to know the needs and successes of the students and schools.\n\nMYEP History\n\nIn the Mid-1980s, Mayor Harvey Gantt developed a framework for a program to support upward mobility for Charlotte youth. In 1986 his vision came to life as the Mayor's Youth Employment Program (MYEP), dedicated to providing students with career experiences that help youth develop career goals, stay in school, achieve academically, and enhance social skills that enable them to succeed in life. Over the years, the MYEP has gained state and national recognition.\n\nFor Students: MYEP Application Process\n\nThank you for your interest in applying to the Mayor's Youth Employment Program!\n\nProspective MYEP participants must complete the following steps before being considered for placement:\n\nComplete Job & Career Readiness Training.

These trained violence interrupters and outreach workers prevent shootings by identifying and mediating potentially violent conflicts in the community and following up to ensure the conflict does not reignite. ATV outreach workers engage high-risk individuals, talk to them about the costs of violence, and assist them in accessing services and support, including employment. The team works within the community to communicate that violence should not be viewed as usual but as a behavior that can be changed.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nThe city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County are joining a rising national movement to stop violence before it happens and empowering the community with quick, effective techniques to resolve conflict.\n\nAlternatives to Violence, better known as ATV, addresses violent crime as a public health crisis. A trusted network of community advocates that detects and interrupts conflicts, identifies and treats high risk individuals and deters violent behavior through community engagement.\n\nDeveloped by the nonprofit organization, Cure Violence global, this model has lowered crime rates in several U.S. cities and in countries across the globe.\n\nIn Charlotte, work begins at Beatties Ford Road and Lasalle Street. A hotspot for violence where the Alternatives to Violence team is building relationships and trust.\n\nSAFE Charlotte\n\nThe City of Charlotte has solidified and implemented public safety policy improvements developed through conversations with residents and community leaders. We understand that a safer Charlotte goes beyond changes to policing and public safety. It means tackling systemic issues to ensure a community of equity and opportunity. Taking a holistic approach, we have rolled up our sleeves to address such intertwined factors as unemployment, housing, transportation, and workforce development. Among the improvements in progress, we are empowering more non-uniformed civilians and providing additional community resources for success. Change does not happen overnight. But over time, we have seen meaningful and sustainable improvements in action, with more to come in the year ahead.\n\nCommunity Violence Data Dashboard\n\nThe dashboard is intended to introduce several indicators of community violence including homicides and violent crimes. In the future, this dashboard will include other key indicators of crime including youth violence, intimate partner violence, emergency department visitations and other measures.\n\nCorridors of Opportunity\n\nCorridors are vital to the health of Charlotte’s communities, serving as links that connect people to the resources and businesses they need to live and thrive. With a $38.5 million investment, the City of Charlotte is renewing its commitment to six key corridors.\n\nHospital Based Violence Intervention\n\nThe city will partner with Atrium Health to launch an evidence-based hospital-based violence intervention program that will work with victims of violence who require medical assistance from Atrium.\n\nSAFE Charlotte Grants\n\nAs a part of the SAFE Charlotte report recommendations, the city has partner with United Way to deploy grants to Charlotte-based grassroots organizations to address violence."
