        "text": "SAN DIEGO — An effort to limit corporate and labor union money in San Diego city elections had a setback recently when a key committee rejected a November ballot measure proposing a public financing program.\n\nThe measure, if placed on a ballot and approved by voters, would provide candidates many thousands in taxpayer dollars so they would have the option of funding their campaigns without collecting private donations.\n\nThe City Council’s Rules Committee rejected the measure April 18 based on concerns that it wouldn’t apply to the mayor or city attorney, and because advocates propose having the city Ethics Commission oversee the program.\n\n“I don’t think the inconsistency across city offices is appropriate,” Council President Sean Elo-Rivera said.\n\nAnother concern raised was that the coalition supporting the measure does not include several groups with a long history of supporting local voter rights and voter outreach efforts.\n\nThe coalition, which calls itself Clean Elections San Diego and includes several local Democratic clubs, said it eliminated the mayor and city attorney from the measure to reduce the cost to taxpayers.\n\nWhen the City Council narrowly rejected a similar proposal by the same group in 2020, council members said the roughly $6 million cost to taxpayers was a primary concern.\n\nThe cost to taxpayers would shrink to about $3 million if the measure is limited to council races, which typically require less money because council members are elected by small geographic districts instead of citywide like the mayor and city attorney.\n\nCouncilmember Raul Campillo, the only member of the Rules Committee to express support, praised the incremental approach.\n\n“I wholeheartedly support public financing and I see some of the wisdom in how it’s being curtailed from prior versions,” he said. “It would be a good test case, but also save us money.”\n\nA separate group called Engage San Diego said it plans to soon propose a different version of publicly financing elections called Democracy Dollars, where all voters get mailed campaign vouchers they can donate to candidates.\n\nSupporters of Democracy Dollars say it has increased voter participation in Seattle, the first city to use it. In 2022, voters in Oakland approved a Democracy Dollars program that takes effect with the 2026 election cycle.\n\nEngage San Diego is a coalition of organizations including the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, the Mid-City Community Advocacy Network, the Partnership for New Americans and Alliance San Diego.\n\nMembers of Clean Elections San Diego said public financing would diminish the impact of special interests and help ordinary citizens run for office.\n\n“The object is to broaden and deepen the participation of citizens, to broaden and deepen democracy and to give an option for those who want to run for office and are known in their communities but simply do not have — or cannot have — the sort of resources they need through the traditional methods of funding,” said group leader Mark Linsky.\n\nDerek Casady, president of the La Jolla Democratic Club, said connections to private donors should not be a pre-requisite to run for office.\n\n“This would give people who have worked hard in the community a chance to run,” he said. “Some people just don’t want to raise private funding. It doesn’t appeal to them, or they’re not connected to private funding people.”\n\nUnder the proposal, the only way for candidates to receive public financing would be to agree to not collect other large donations. Candidates who declined to participate could still collect large donations\n\nTo receive the public funds, candidates for City Council would have to collect at least 300 qualifying contributions of $5 each from registered voters in the district. Qualifying candidates would get roughly $120,000 for the primary and about $240,000 for the general election."
