        "text": "Bioregional Center for Sustainability Science, Planning and Design\n\n“The Bioregional Center brings diverse people and organizations together to collaboratively study and equitably improve how neighborhoods, cities and regions function. They provides a transdisciplinary workspace and knowledge networking hub for theory-building, civically engaged research, innovation, pedagogy and communication.”\n\nFood2Soil\n\n“Food2Soil is a collective of chefs and farmers, businesses and individuals, entrepreneurs and innovators building a people-powered, community-centered foundation for the circular economy. They believe that waste is a resource that has intrinsic social, environmental and economic value. Our programs are designed to challenge us to extract this value so it turns into income for farmers and living soil for our farms.”\n\nPartnerships for the Advancement of New Arrivals (PANA)\n\n“PANA was founded in the recognition that the unique needs of San Diego’s growing refugee communities cannot be addressed by simple adjustments to existing ways of doing business. Instead, PANA uses an integrated advocacy approach to its research, public policy, and community organizing in order to build and leverage deep community networks, develop community leaders, and establish a civic engagement infrastructure for the refugee community.”\n\nSomali-Bantu Community of San Diego\n\n“The Somali Bantu Community of San Diego was founded in 2004 by Somali Bantu residents for the purpose of meeting the needs of their vulnerable community. The board and other key stakeholders developed the organization’s vision, mission, and goals through a participatory planning process that identified three main areas of focus: access to healthcare, education, and employment. Since the SBCSD’s inception, the organization has successfully organized and mobilized their community by connecting people to needed services, developing and implementing successful youth programs and shaping policies that affect the refugee community.”\n\nSomali Family Service\n\nSFS was established in 2000 as a non-profit, community-based social service organization. Since its inception, the organization has provided culturally and linguistically appropriate programs and services to members of the San Diego Somali and other refugee and immigrant communities, easing their transition and ensuring successful functioning in their new home. In San Diego, there is a serious lack of support services for Somali and other East African immigrants and refugees. As an organization staffed by Somali community members, SFS is uniquely positioned to fill this gap in the community to provide services specifically catered to East African refugees.\n\nSouthern Sudanese Community Center\n\nThe SSCCSD is a non-profit 501(c)(3) founded in 1995 with the mission to assist all Sudanese refugees in their resettlement through education, social, economic, and cultural support. We guide them towards self-sufficiency and full integration into American society while respecting their dignity as new Americans.\n\nSuperfund Research Center-UC San Diego\n\n“The UC San Diego Superfund Research Center (UCSD-SRC) is a multidisciplinary effort consisting of four Biomedical and two Environmental Science and Engineering Projects, all of which will use the highly specialized core resources of our Genetics and Metabolomics Research Support Core. Along with our Training Core which will provide career support to graduate and postdoctoral level trainees, the research and core components of our Center will work with the Research Translation Core (RTC) to promote our findings to broader based audiences, and the Community Engagement Core (CEC) to share our expertise with impacted communities.”\n\nUnited Women of East Africa\n\n“UWEAST is a San Diego nonprofit providing health services, education and advocacy for the well-being of the East African community, women and families. A community-based organization comprised of approximately 100 East African women, we operate the East African Cultural and Community Center in City Heights, and offer programs and services with the goal of responding to the overlooked health needs of East African women and their families.”\n\nUniversity of California San Diego\n\n”Recognized as one of the top 15 research universities worldwide, our culture of collaboration sparks discoveries that advance society and drive economic impact. Everything we do is dedicated to ensuring our students have the opportunity to become changemakers, equipped with the multidisciplinary tools needed to accelerate answers to our world’s most pressing issues.”"
