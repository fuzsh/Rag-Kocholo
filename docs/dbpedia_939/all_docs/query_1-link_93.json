        "text": "Learn Computer Skills with 'Tech on the Go'\n\nA new mobile digital literacy program – Tech on the Go – is offering free in-person classes for any San Diegan who wants to learn how to use a computer and better navigate the internet. Classes are held at libraries and community centers and open to people of all skill levels. Check out the schedule and register for a class!\n\nNew Mobile Hotspots Available for Check Out\n\nThrough SD Access 4 All, the City has acquired 4,000 mobile hotspots that are now available to check out from libraries for home use. Mobile hotspots are easy to use and allow users to connect their laptop, tablet and other Wi-Fi enabled devices to the internet. The device converts cellular signals into Wi-Fi to provide internet access for email, web browsing and other data transfers.\n\nLibrary patrons must have a library card in good standing to check out a hotspot for up to 90 days at a time. To learn more, visit the mobile hotspot information page or one of the following participating library locations where hotspots are available.\n\nParticipating Libraries\n\nOutdoor Community Computer Labs\n\nThe City has created 10 outdoor community computer labs to serve patrons of all ages. Each lab is equipped with open public Wi-Fi and has tables and chairs set up with appropriate physical distancing. Patrons can bring their own laptop or use one from the library to get connected. To learn more, visit the outdoor computer lab information page or one of the following participating library locations where outdoor computer labs are available.\n\nParticipating Libraries\n\nThe City is giving away its end-of-life computers so they can be refurbished and offered to individuals who do not currently have a computer. Through a partnership with San Diego Futures Foundation, a 501(c)3 nonprofit based in City Heights, the City has donated over 2,200 computers to help bridge the digital divide so far and plans to provide about 800 more each year.\n\nAs part of this partnership, the Futures Foundation provides training to help recipients of the computers get off to a quick start and provide them with the resources to find affordable internet services.\n\nIn addition, the City has a partnership with Computers 2 Kids to refurbish 2,000 computers from local businesses so they can be distributed to low-income families."
