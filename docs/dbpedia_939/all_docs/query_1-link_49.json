The Region 2 EJ Program works to integrate the consideration of environmental justice into all of our Regional programs, functions and activities in New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our strategy is outlined in our Regional EJ Action Plan. The Region 2 Environmental Justice Program is driven by community-based work. We provide support to various community initiatives such as EPA's Making a Visible Difference in Communities effort. We strive to interact directly with communities and work with them to address their environmental and health concerns to the best of our ability and within the scope of the Agency's authority.\n\nRegion 2 also co-leads a Regional Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice (EJ RIWG) with the U.S. Health and Human Services based in New York. The EJ RIWG is a communities-based effort where federal partners come together to find creative solutions for some of the most economically- and environmentally-challenged areas in our region.\n\nLearn more about Region 2.\n\nRegion EJ Highlights\n\nJust one example of our community-based approach to environmental justice is a recent workshop the Region organized. With the help and partnership of the Making a Visible Difference effort, the Region 2 EJ Program successfully coordinated with state and local leaders to hold an environmental justice and education workshop in Newburgh, NY. Through the workshop, Newburgh residents and community organizations had the chance to learn, engage, discuss and build capacity to understand and address the environmental health issues that deeply impact their community.\n\nRegional EJ Resources\n\nRegion 2 EJ Action Plan\n\nRegion 2 Implementation Plan to Promote Meaningful Engagement of Overburdened Communities in Permitting Activities\n\nEnvironmental Justice for CAA Permitting in Region 2\n\nRegional EJ Contacts\n\nTopic Contact EJ and Children’s Environmental Health Coordinator Towana Joseph (joseph.towana@epa.gov)\n\n212-637-3866\n\nEPA Region 3: Mid-Atlantic\n\nServing Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia\n\nThe EPA Mid Atlantic Region’s Environmental Justice (EJ) Program is managed by the Office of Communities, Tribes and Environmental Assessment (OCTEA).\n\nOCTEA continues to lead in the development of cumulative impact analysis through a transparent, data-driven process to identify public health and environmental issues that may impact communities. OCTEA works to build capacity both internally and externally in Region 3 through outreach and education, leading trainings, facilitating discussions, and participating in national work groups. OCTEA is the point of contact for community based organizations and other environmental justice stakeholders in Region 3. OCTEA also:\n\nProvides expert EJSCREEN assessments\n\nProvides expert CJEST analysis\n\nProvides redlining analyses which enables the Agency to consider the impact of historic inequities\n\nReviews Agency actions to ensure EJ concerns are considered\n\nConducts EJ training\n\nConducts outreach in underserved communities\n\nManages EJ and community grants\n\nServes as the conduit for information about and for underserved communities\n\nProvides information and encourages support of environmental justice activities throughout Region 3\n\nPrograms Activities:\n\nAll States EJ Working Group: Since 1999, Region 3 has chaired the All States EJ Working Group, now comprised of Region’s 1-5 and their respective states. The All States EJ Working Group began by holding a face to face meeting of the EJ staff from Region 3 and the states that comprise Region 3 in June of 1999. The meeting was an information and capacity building session designed to educate and inform the attendees about Environmental Justice; as well as to encourage a further dialogue among the attendees. The session was so well received that regularly scheduled monthly conference calls were requested and have been ongoing since that time. Over time, Regions 1, 2, 4, and 5 have joined the group continuing the monthly calls and face to face sessions when possible. The calls provide a forum for discussion of issues of concern, training and capacity building opportunities, and a host of guest speaker form the states, community groups and organizations, the regions and OEJ to name a few.\n\nEJScreen – OCTEA conducts approximately 20,000 EJScreen reviews annually.\n\nNational Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) EJ Reviews – OCTEA conducts EJ reviews for all NEPA matters and developed and delivers EJ training for NEPA reviewers.\n\nMapping – OCTEA works with the divisions to provide desktop analysis displaying environmental and public health issues to improve decision-making\n\nLearn more about Region 3.\n\nRegional EJ Highlights\n\nThe Chester, PA Environmental Risk Study conducted in the mid-1990’s was EPA’s first cumulative impact analysis to characterize and address risk from an EJ standpoint.

It plays a critical role in leading and coordinating the region’s environmental justice programs.\n\nThe vision of EJCHERD’s Environmental Justice Coordination and Community Engagement Branch (EJCCEB) is to ensure that the citizens and communities who reside in the eight States and six Tribes in EPA Region 4, have equitable access to clean water, clean air, and clean land while analyzing and addressing disproportionate impacts including distribution of environmental burdens and benefits. The program focuses on communities of color, low-income communities, Indigenous peoples, and vulnerable, overburdened and/or disadvantaged communities. The eight States and six Tribes served are: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, as well as six federally recognized Tribes (i.e., Catawba Indian Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Poarch Band of Creek Indians, Seminole Tribe of Florida.)\n\nIn addition to working with external stakeholders, EJCCEB works closely with the EPA Region 4 Divisions in their integration of environmental justice within their programs.

This assessment report is a resource for community groups, local governments, the port authority and other stakeholders as they consider how future development and operations may further impact air quality and public health. The six Westside neighborhoods considered in this assessment are Westpointe, Jordan Meadows, Poplar Grove, Glendale, Fairpark and Rose Park. The assessment was conducted through the EPA’s Technical Assistance Services for Communities (TASC) program in collaboration with representatives from the SLC sustainability office, local organizations, and the Westside community.\n\nRegional EJ Resources\n\nRegion 8 Implementation Plan to Promote Meaningful Engagement of Overburdened Communities in Permitting Activities\n\nEnvironmental Justice for CAA Permitting in EPA Region 8\n\nRegional EJ Contacts\n\nTopic Contact Children’s Health, Environmental Justice, and Equity Branch Manager David Dorian (dorian.david.i@epa.gov) EJ Grants Assistance Section Supervisor (Acting) Blake Huff (huff.blake@epa.gov) EJ Tribal and Indigenous Peoples Advisor Kimberly Varilek (varilek.kimberly@epa.gov)\n\nEPA Region 9: Pacific Southwest\n\nServing Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Pacific Islands and 148 Tribes\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n(Meetings and events can be found here when available | Las reuniones y eventos se pueden encontrar aquí cuando estén disponibles)\n\nEPA Region 9 supports programs and projects to help address adverse and disproportionate effects.
