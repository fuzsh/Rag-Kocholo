        "text": "​Mid Michigan Community Action has drafted the Fiscal Year 2025 Community Action Plan for review by officials and residents within our service area. The plan serves as a roadmap demonstrating how Mid Michigan Community Action plans to deliver Community Service Block Grant services in Bay, Clare, Gladwin, Mecosta, Midland, Muskegon, Oceana, and Osceola Counties.\n\nThe Community Action Plan is available for public comments from August 15, 2024 to September 15, 2024. During this period, a copy of the plan can be accessed online at www.mmcaa.org or in person at any Mid Michigan Community Action Center during business hours. A copy of the plan can also be requested by emailing [email protected] or texting 989-386-3805. Comments must be submitted in writing to Eva Rohlman, Outreach & Opportunities Director by mail to PO Box 768, Farwell, MI 48622 or via email to [email protected] on or before September 15, 2024 to be considered.\n\nThe Community Action Plan identifies and assesses poverty-related needs and resources in the community and establishes a detailed plan, goals, and priorities for delivering those services to individuals and families affected by poverty.\n\n​Mid Michigan Community Action guides local residents on the path to self-sufficiency through empowerment, education, and community enrichment.\n\n2024 marks the 60th year since the Community Action network was established to help American families and communities overcome obstacles to poverty. Over 1,000 agencies across the country are working every day to create opportunities and transform the lives of their neighbors, making communities stronger and helping families across the US thrive.\n\n“Each May, during Community Action Month, we reflect on the impact Mid Michigan Community Action and our network has had on families,” said Jill Sutton, Executive Director of Mid Michigan Community Action. “Last year alone, we served 14,532 people from Muskegon to Bay City, and the network served over 15 million across the country with immediately needed services such as housing and food, and long-term solutions like weatherization and early childhood education.”\n\nCommunity Action Agencies serve America with life-changing services to help families achieve financial stability. All agencies are locally controlled and represented by the private, public, and low-income sectors of the community. “We are proud of our communities’ participation in the development and oversight of our programs,” said Sutton. “Their engagement helps us to be more effective in our approach by determining what our communities need.”\n\nTo honor the commitment to community-led solutions, Mid Michigan Community Action is launching its triennial Community Needs Assessment. The assessment analyses Census data, labor statistics, and most importantly, community survey and focus group findings. To complete the Community Needs Assessment survey, visit www.mmcaa.org/cna. Details on the virtual and in-person focus groups are available through the survey, on the website, and across social media @MidMichiganCommunityAction.\n\n​\n\nMid Michigan Community Action is a member of the National Community Action Partnership and the Community Action network, which was born out of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Mid Michigan Community Action guides local residents on the path to self-sufficiency through empowerment, education and community enrichment.\n\nOn January 25th Mid Michigan Community Action Agency (Mid Michigan CAA) will be completing the Point-in-Time (PIT) Count. The PIT Count is a federally mandated annual survey to count those experiencing homelessness in the Mid Michigan area.\n\nMid Michigan CAA is seeking to count individuals and families including those sleeping outdoors or other places not meant for human habitation such as cars or campers, those staying in shelters, and those who are housed with emergency motel stay vouchers.\n\n“The PIT Count helps us better understand who is experiencing homelessness and how prevalent homelessness is in our communities so we can advocate for additional resources, provide high quality services, and end homelessness in our communities,” said Jennifer Rodgers, Homeless Program Manager at Mid Michigan CAA.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) uses the data collected to help determine distribution of resources to homeless services agencies, including Mid Michigan CAA. Mid Michigan CAA works with organizations including 211 Northeast Michigan, Good Samaritan Rescue Mission, Listening Ear, Michigan Balance of State Continuum of Care, New Dawn Shelter, Our Brothers Keeper Shelter, R.I.S.E., Shelterhouse, and WISE.\n\nResidents of Arenac, Bay, Clare, Gladwin, Mecosta, and Osceola Counties who are experiencing homelessness can call or text 877-213-5955 or email [email protected].\n\nFor more information about the PIT Count, contact the PIT Coordinator, Jennifer Rodgers, at [email protected].\n\nMid Michigan Community Action guides local residents on the path to self-sufficiency through empowerment, education and community enrichment.\n\nMid Michigan Community Action Hosts Quarterly and Senior Food Distributions\n\n​\n\nMid Michigan Community Action Agency (Mid Michigan CAA) now hosts commodities distributions for those in need of food in Muskegon and Oceana Counties.\n\n“We are proud to begin providing this critical service in Muskegon and Oceana Counties,” said Eva Rohlman, Outreach Director at Mid Michigan CAA. “We have established a public distribution site at the Ladder Community Center in Shelby and are eager to expand our services to more locations across the two counties in the coming months.”\n\nThe Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) is for low-income seniors 60 and over and consists of two boxes distributed every other month. The next distribution is on January 30th at the Ladder Community Center in Shelby from 11:30 AM-12:30 PM.\n\n“Senior food boxes contain USDA products aimed at filling nutrient gaps in seniors’ diets,” said Kristi Shakula, Commodities Manager at Mid Michigan CAA. “The boxes include items like canned fruits and vegetables, canned meats, cereals, grains, ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk, and cheese.”\n\nThe Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) is a quarterly distribution for individuals and families of all ages in need of emergency food. Quarterly distributions occur in March, May, September, and November. The next distribution is on March 27th at the Ladder Community Center in Shelby from 11:30 AM-12:30 PM.\n\n“The quarterly food box contains products that vary from quarter to quarter. They are designed to distribute excess agricultural products to deliver food to people who can use it while minimizing food waste,” said Shakula.\n\nTo apply for either program, bring your ID to the next distribution near you. Muskegon County residents are invited to attend the Shelby distribution location.\n\nFor a complete calendar of senior distributions, visit www.mmcaa.org/seniors.
