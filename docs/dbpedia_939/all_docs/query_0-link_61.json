        "text": "Invest our public dollars in a socially and environmentally equitable manner to build a vibrant, inclusive economy that delivers environmental and economic justice, lifts up communities, creates healthier communities, addresses the climate crisis, and ensures natural resource conservation.\n\nOur Mission & Goals\n\nAdopt more sustainable and socially equitable patterns of land use.\n\nPreserve, expand, and restore natural habitat and open space in the region.\n\nEnsure adequate location and variety of parklands providing equitable access and appropriate recreational uses in the region.\n\nProtect and enhance regional water quality while advancing a resilient, multi-benefit, low carbon water supply\n\nReduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants through enforceable measures consistent with state laws and executive orders.\n\nCreate good, middle-class jobs, especially in vulnerable neighborhoods, and support the collective bargaining rights of workers.\n\nExpand and preserve affordable housing and homeownership, particularly near transit and job centers.\n\nPursue transportation justice, which is the right of every person to a safe, accessible, affordable, effective, and healthy transportation network.\n\nHow do we get there?\n\nPreserve Biodiversity, Natural Habitat, and Provide Parks and Open Space\n\nComplete, strengthen, manage, and fully fund regional multi-species habitat conservation plans, critical land acquisitions, and land management.\n\nPreserve, restore, and manage natural habitat and other ecologically sensitive lands not covered by regional multi-species conservation plans including: urban canyons, waterways, waterbodies, ecological linkages, and ecologically important greenfields.\n\nDirect development away from remote or rural natural lands and into existing developed communities and urban areas.\n\nEnsure establishment and funding of adequate parks, trails, and appropriate recreational areas and provide equitable access.\n\nEnsure land dedicated to habitat preservation is protected and managed for that ecological benefit.\n\nEnsure adequate green spaces and parks in communities where green infrastructure has not been provided.\n\nProvide the benefits of open space, habitat conservation and ecosystem services among all residents of the region and engage everyone in experiencing, responsible use and appreciation of these places.\n\nProtect and Enhance Regional Water Quality While Advancing a Resilient, Multi-Benefit, Low Carbon Water Supply\n\nIdentify, secure, and allocate funding for green storm water and wastewater infrastructure improvements and maintenance to meet water quality standards, address source control, and prevent trash and pollution from entering storm drains, watersheds, and the ocean.\n\nFund, develop, and implement integrated water management and multi-benefit infrastructure projects that capture, infiltrate, reuse storm water, and recycle wastewater to support a local sustainable water supply while improving human and environmental health.\n\nPrioritize green infrastructure and multi-benefit projects that maximize co-benefits to disadvantaged communities and promote equity. Examples include green spaces in park poor areas that serve to attenuate flooding while infiltrating stormwater or capturing and delivering it for treatment and reuse.\n\nEnsure Meaningful Action on the Crisis of Climate Change\n\nEstablish a regional pathway and implementation strategy to reach zero emissions, in line with state targets and scientific consensus about what it will take to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nEnsure a just transition for workers and frontline communities.\n\nSecure adoption and implementation of Climate Action Plans, in San Diego County and each city in the county, with enforceable GHG reduction measures and targets aligned with state laws and Executive Orders.\n\nEnsure that local and regional land use and transportation policies and plans are aligned with local, regional, and state climate targets.\n\nInvest in Social, Economic and Environmental Equity\n\nDedicate majority of funding to communities identified as most disadvantaged. For this purpose, disadvantaged communities are defined as the 25% of San Diego County’s 628 census tracts that rank highest within the region on the most current version of CalEnviroScreen.\n\nProvide training and work opportunities for County residents through a Project Labor Agreement with three key provisions: 1) participation in state-approved joint labor-management apprenticeship; 2) local hire with enforceable standards targeting vulnerable communities and populations, like veterans; and 3) labor peace.\n\nReduce the percentage of family income spent on the combined cost of housing and transportation with an emphasis in those communities where the percentages are highest.\n\nPreserve, Expand, and Increase the Accessibility of Affordable Housing\n\nFocus the region’s limited resources on meeting the most-pressing housing needs.\n\nRequire any new residential developments to include onsite inclusionary housing or a minimum of one to one unit for offsite.\n\nSupport the creation of jobs paying family-supporting wages and require at minimum that all residential construction projects pay a prevailing wage or include a project labor agreement where the workforce will be local, skilled and trained.\n\nEnsure existing residents can remain in their communities and support tenant protections that help ensure safe and affordable housing and protects residents from discriminatory practices.\n\nSupport infill development and the building of affordable housing near transit.\n\nDevelop Viable, Equitable, and Sustainable Transit, Bike, and Pedestrian Networks\n\nCreate a safe, accessible, effective mass transit, biking, and walking network that offers viable alternatives to traveling by car and prioritizes projects in disadvantaged communities.\n\nWith the help of world-class experts, develop planning strategies, policies, and investments that facilitate access for everyone to use state of the art transportation networks that integrate biking, walking, and mass transit options.\n\nOffer frequent transit service that is convenient and competitive with vehicle travel, with real-time information, safe shelters, safe bike/walk routes to transit, 24-hour transportation options, and connections from transit to affordable housing, jobs, and major community destinations.\n\nEnsure that overburdened communities do not bear excessive external costs such as pollution, accident risk, and financial costs.\n\nIn order to meet or exceed state and local climate targets, fund and prioritize new construction, operations and maintenance of transit, biking, and walking projects on accelerated timelines before any new roadway expansions.\n\nSupport meaningful public participation by ensuring that the concerns of residents are identified and addressed in the development of policies, programs, and projects proposed for each neighborhood.\n\nEnsure that construction, maintenance, and operation of the transportation network creates good, middle-class jobs through collective bargaining, especially in vulnerable neighborhoods.\n\nMake biking and walking an integral part of the transportation system by providing secure bike parking at transit hubs and improving capacity for taking bikes on transit.\n\nAbout Us\n\nIn 2015 SANDAG started planning for a ballot measure, tentatively named the “Quality of Life Initiative”. A group of environmental and labor organizations started meeting to discuss the measure, specifically how we could influence the contents. We circulated a request for input to a number of organizations and gathered the responses to inform our position on the measure. This became the Quality of Life Initiative Coalition. We reached out to SANDAG in the hope that we could engage in the planning for the ballot measure but they refused to work with us. When we saw the final ballot language, it was clear that we had to oppose it. The measure failed in 2016.\n\nSince 2016, the Coalition has continued to define our vision and goals and to work towards them. After some management changes at SANDAG, we were able to engage with them and create a collaborative effort. We continue to work with SANDAG to influence the Regional Plan and elevate our priorities for the San Diego Region.\n\nRecent Blog Posts & News\n\nWhy We Must Drive Less\n\nIt would be really nice if the solution to the biggest challenge in human history was to switch to electric vehicles. Unfortunately, given the best available data, it is clear that the switch can’t happen fast enough to prevent a climate catastrophe.\n\nWe don’t have time to wait for technology to catch up and reduce the impact of driving enough to make it the main mode of transportation for San Diegans. We need to stop driving now, by whatever means possible.\n\nRoad Use Charges Are Coming for You\n\n“Road user charges are the most viable and sustainable long-term ‘user pay’ option for the federal government to both raise adequate and appropriate revenues and provide the federal share of funding for the nation’s surface transportation system.”\n\nRegional Plan Draft Environmental Impact Report Out for Review\n\nDraft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the 2021 Regional Plan As part of the development of the 2021 Regional Plan, The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), as lead agency under the California Environmental Quality Act, has prepared a Draft...\n\nAnalyzing the 2021 Regional Plan\n\nOn May 28, SANDAG released the Draft 2021 Regional Plan, including the Draft Air Quality Conformity analysis and the Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) for public comment on May 28, 2021.

Most days you can see people playing in the water in many ways – swimming, surfing, snorkeling, diving, fishing, and more. But for 72 hours after it rains, it is another story. Closed beaches and empty lineups testify to the hazards of playing in polluted stormwater.\n\nSan Diego is on the Verge of Something Big\n\nMillions of people call San Diego County home and for decades, the primary way most of us have moved around the region has been driving. That is about to change.\n\nStopping Sprawl Development – SB 743 Explained\n\nA recurring theme in environmental activism in the San Diego Region has been the effort to prevent sprawl development in the rural part of the county. This has taken on a new urgency in recent years, as catastrophic wildfires have become more frequent, and the reality of climate disruption has begun to sink in.\n\nSANDAG Released SB 743 VMT Maps\n\nSANDAG has released the SB 743 VMT maps for both Series 14 and the historical Series 13.SANDAG has released the SB 743 VMT maps for both Series 14 and the historical Series 13....\n\nSANDAG has rolled out the Climate Action Data Portal\n\nSANDAG has rolled out the Climate Action Data PortalThe Climate Action Data Portal is an online resource for climate planning data for the San Diego region.
