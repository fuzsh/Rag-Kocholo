        "text": "DHR has established 10 Regional Hate and Bias Prevention Councils representing every region across the state (Capital, Central New York, Finger Lakes, Long Island, Mid-Hudson, Mohawk Valley, New York City, North Country, Southern Tier, and Western New York). The councils are comprised of a diverse network of public and private stakeholders that include community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, law enforcement, government agencies, and other advocacy groups. These broad and diverse partners will work together in building connections and local capacity to prevent and respond to hate and bias incidents through community engagement and mobilization.\n\nThe Councils will provide a place for community members to share information about trends in different areas of the state: develop innovative policy solutions; organize educational programming; host community events to raise awareness about hate and bias prevention; offer healing circles and community dialogues; partner with schools to address intergroup conflict; participate in conflict resolution, restorative justice, and anti-racism trainings; and more."
