        "text": "The Mid-America Regional Council, which is the regional planning organization for 8 counties in the Kansas City region, has announced a major update to its regional Complete Streets Policy:\n\nComplete Streets are advanced in this policy so that transportation investments may result in a rising quality of mobility for everyone. . . . this policy intends to enable Complete Street treatments to the maximum extent possible.\n\nComplete Streets are streets that provide a complete and safe transportation network for all modes of transportation - from motor vehicles to public transit to walking and bicycling - and for people of all ages and all ability levels.\n\nThe update took about eight months, involved extensive input from area communities, leaders, citizens, and MARC committees, and is the fourth major update to the region's Complete Streets Policy.\n\nOne reason a Complete Streets Policy is so important at the Metropolitan Planning Organization level is the MPO administers most federal transportation grants for the region. Complete Streets priorities are then built into the scoring criteria for the grants - changing the types of projects that are submitted and encouraging inclusion of more bicycle & pedestrian elements within all road and street projects. MARC has seen the quality of grant applications rise dramatically as the Complete Streets policy was introduced and then refined over the years.\n\nMore about MARC's new Complete Streets policy:\n\nNew Complete Streets Policy\n\nComplete Streets Handbook (2018)\n\nComplete Streets Network Assessment (map showing regional corridors and connectivity)\n\nComplementing this, the region has a Major River Crossings policy, providing for bike/ped accommodation when major river bridges in the region are built or updated\n\nFrom MARC's Complete Streets page:\n\nWHY DESIGN COMPLETE STREETS?\n\nFind out more about Complete Streets, sample Complete Streets policies from around Missouri and the U.S., and how to incorporate Complete Streets into your city, county, or region, on MoBikeFed's Complete Streets page."
