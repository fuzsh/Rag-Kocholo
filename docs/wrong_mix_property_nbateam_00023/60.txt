However, the love for basketball is unmatched in this city, as the melodious sound of hoops swoosh can be heard in every corner of the street. And, the 76ers are in the heartbeat of every fan.

The city has witnessed some of the most dominant players representing their franchise. Namely, Wilt Chamberlain, Julius Erving, Moses Malone, and Allen Iverson.

History

The team was initially formed in 1939 in Syracuse, New York under the team name, The Syracuse Nationals. The Nats weren?t part of any league until it joined the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1946. Eventually, the team became one of the 11 original teams that played in the inaugural season of the NBA merger. At that time, the league already had a team with Philly, the Philadelphia Warriors, which is currently known as the Golden State Warriors. However, in 1962, when the Warriors abandoned Philadelphia and moved to the Bay area, the Nats got their new home city. The ?76ers? refers to the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia in 1776. However, before changing the name to 76ers, the Nats had already won their first title in 1955. Following that, the Sixers have two titles (1967, 1983). The arrival of legends like Wilt Chamberlain, Julius Erving and Allen Iverson marked the birth of different eras in the Sixers franchise.?

Who is the owner of the Philadelphia 76ers?

The team is currently owned by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE), an entertainment company formed by Josh Harris and David Blitzer. Harris bought the franchise from Comcast-Spectacor for $280 million. Apart from the Sixers, HBSE also owns an NHL team, the New Jersey Devils. Before Comcast-Spectacor, the franchise has seen five different combinations of ownership since 1947. Notably, Danny Biason, the founding owner of the Syracuse Nationals, owned the team for 16 years between 1947 and 1963.?
