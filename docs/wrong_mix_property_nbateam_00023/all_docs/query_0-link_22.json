        "text": "Associated Press\n\nElton Brand left behind all those power forward battles in the Western Conference for some new tough ones in the Atlantic Division.\n\nBrand signed with the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday, the biggest move on the first day NBA deals could be completed. Power forward was the Sixers' biggest need in free agency, and they got perhaps the best one available.\n\n\"I'm prepared to do some big things this year,\" Brand said. \"They were one of the best teams in the second half of the season last year. I've been following them for a while and I see myself fitting in on the court.\"\n\nFormer teammate Corey Maggette was set to join him in leaving the Los Angeles Clippers for an offer with the Golden State Warriors — who had previously targeted Brand. At least the Clippers had some success in free agency, getting Baron Davis to head home from the Bay Area.\n\nAfter years of matching up with the likes of Tim Duncan and Dirk Nowitzki out West, Brand landed in an Atlantic Division that now features a Jermaine O'Neal-Chris Bosh tandem in Toronto, with Kevin Garnett already in Boston.\n\nThe 76ers were able to sign Brand to a big deal because they sent forward Rodney Carney and a future No. 1 pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of a trade that cleared an additional $2 million in salary cap space.\n\nO'Neal went from the Pacers to the Raptors in a deal that was agreed upon before last month's draft. Toronto sent point guard T.J. Ford, center Rasho Nesterovic, forward Maceo Baston and the draft rights to center Roy Hibbert to the Pacers for O'Neal and the draft rights to forward Nathan Jawai.\n\nMoving Ford cleared the way for the Raptors to re-sign Jose Calderon and make him the starter after he was mainly the backup before Ford was hurt last season.\n\nWith O'Neal joining Bosh, Toronto should be one of the league's strongest interior duos — and O'Neal doesn't care what his role in it is.\n\n\"This is Chris' team,\" O'Neal said. \"I'm here to help him lead. He's been a centerpiece for quite some time and he's a hell of a talent.\"\n\nThe Knicks brought in a new point guard, signing Chris Duhon to either compete for the starting job, or inherit it if they part ways with Stephon Marbury before next season.\n\nIn other free agent moves:"
