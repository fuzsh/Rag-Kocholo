        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers have promoted former NBA player Elton Brand from vice president of basketball operations to be their general manager, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reports.\n\nElton Brand the choice after months-long search\n\nThe decision comes after a months-long search following the June resignation of former general manager Bryan Colangelo, who was wrapped up in a social media scandal involving burner accounts used to criticize players and previous general manager Sam Hinkie.\n\nHead coach Brett Brown has acted as interim general manager in the meantime.\n\nBrand familiar to 76ers\n\nBrand was the first pick of the 1999 draft out of Duke and went on to a 17-year career in the NBA. The two-time All-Star played six seasons with the 76ers and retired with the team in 2016.\n\nThe 76ers hired Brand as a player development consultant later that year before he was named general manager of the Delaware Blue Coats, the team’s G League affiliate, in 2017. The 76ers named Brand vice president of basketball operations in August and ultimately decided he was the right fit for the general manager position.\n\nJoel Embiid approves\n\n76ers All-Star center Joel Embiid didn’t waste time in congratulating Brand on his promotion.\n\nWojnarowski reports that the team plans to officially announce Brand as general manager on Thursday. He also reports that Utah Jazz assistant general manager Justin Zanik, Houston Rockets vice president Gersson Rosas and assistant Golden State Warriors GM Larry Harris were among the external candidates considered for the job.\n\nInternal candidates included GM Ned Cohen and player personnel executive Marc Eversley, according to the report.\n\nThe 76ers failed to land a prominent free agent during the offseason and will look to do so next summer to add to their young core led by Embiid and Ben Simmons. Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson and Jimmy Butler are expected to headline a loaded free agent class in 2019."
