        "text": "Hats off to the Philadelphia 76ers’ President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey and General Manager Elton Brand on an incredible NBA Draft and free agency. After drafting Jared McCain (Duke), and Adem Bona (UCLA), we followed up with signing nine-time NBA All-Star and highly-sought-after free agent Paul George, and adding accomplished NBA veterans Andre Drummond, Eric Gordon, and Caleb Martin to our roster. We re-signed our star wing Kelly Oubre Jr., as well as 2024 All-Star Tyrese Maxey, a cornerstone of our franchise who will be with us for years to come. Paul and this group of new players have made our team better, stronger and more dangerous – and having added to our core roster, we enter the upcoming season with exceptional leadership in Head Coach Nick Nurse, and a talented bench set up for success. With our draft assets and remaining available cap space, we’re continuing to look for opportunities to further strengthen our rotation as we pursue an NBA title for our fans. But first – Joel heads to Paris to compete in the Olympics on behalf of the US and City of Philadelphia. Let's go!!!\n\nThe New Jersey Devils made an important acquisition last week, adding highly accomplished goaltender Jacob Markstrom to the roster. Jacob is a former All-Star with a track record that speaks for itself. I’m confident he will stabilize our team, fortify our defense, and be a key leader on and off the ice. Shoutout to General Manager Tom Fitzgerald and his team – first in bringing on great leadership in Head Coach Sheldon Keefe in May, and now acquiring a fantastic goaltender to complement our young core. Excited to welcome Jacob and his family to New Jersey, and looking forward to an exciting free agency and draft in Vegas – where we are well-positioned to add key talent with six total picks and 10th overall selection. As Jacob said, it's a great day to be a Devil. It’s been a productive offseason and we’re just getting started – let’s go!\n\nOn Friday, we capped off a successful offseason by officially signing our entire 2024 Washington Commanders Draft class, including our first round selection – QB Jayden Daniels. We were fortunate to add a group of players that each bring explosive talent, drive and character that align with our vision for what this franchise can become. Welcome to Jayden, Jer’Zhan Newton, Mike Sainristil, Ben Sinnott, Brandon Coleman, Luke McCaffrey, Jordan Magee, Dominique Hampton and Javontae Jean-Baptiste. It was impressive to watch Adam Peters, Dan Quinn and their teams do what they do best over the course of the offseason, including during key moments like free agency and the draft. I’m confident that this promising class of young players will be a major part of the foundation of what we’re building in Washington, will make our fans and community proud, and allow us to work towards our goal of consistently competing for championships. Next up – training camp. Let’s go.\n\nCongratulations to Martin Truex Jr. on a storied, Hall of Fame career. Martin’s accomplishments on the track have been nothing short of extraordinary – including 34 Cup wins and the 2017 NASCAR Cup Series Championship. He’s competed in 664 consecutive races, going back to the 2006 Daytona 500. No other driver has a longer active streak – and his precision and grit have earned him a place among the all-time greats. Beyond his impressive accolades, its Martin’s character that has set him apart. It’s not often that someone who has achieved greatness remains so humble and kind. It has been a privilege watching Martin’s career over the last few years, and I wish him and his family all the best in their next step. We are grateful for everything he has done for us at Joe Gibbs Racing, our fans, and the racing community at large.\n\nMy partner David Blitzer and I are proud to welcome Sheldon Keefe as the new Head Coach for the New Jersey Devils, ushering in a new chapter for the franchise. Sheldon has a strong track record of success throughout his coaching career – including being the second fastest coach in NHL history to accumulate 200 wins – and his communication, collaboration, leadership, and instinct for innovation stood out during this process. He’s also proven to be particularly gifted at cultivating elite talent – something that’s incredibly important as we continue to develop our young core. Working with Tom Fitzgerald and his team, Sheldon will help bring us back to the levels of winning we expect as an organization, and fight to bring a fourth Stanley Cup home to our fans. Welcome Sheldon, his wife Jackie, and two sons to New Jersey – let’s go!

So appreciative to have him representing the city of Philadelphia in a Philadelphia 76ers jersey. Tyrese truly embodies what it means to be a Sixer. He shows up with grit and tenacity on the court, while always maintaining compassion for others. Tyrese is a role model for both professional and aspiring athletes, and inspires me to continue to bring sports to as many kids as possible through various charitable organizations including Sixers Youth Foundation, Harris Philanthropies, Palace for Life Foundation and After-School All-Stars, as well as what we’re building at Unrivaled Sports. Congratulations to Tyrese and his family on this defining achievement – no one is more deserving. Tyrese’s journey and his family’s support show how sports truly transform lives.\n\nThe second ever to win “Most Improved Player” in Philadelphia 76ers history – congratulations to Tyrese Maxey. When Tyrese joined the Sixers as a rookie in 2020, it was clear he was talented and hard-working, with a bright career ahead of him. This year, Tyrese took his game to the next level, stepping up as a leader when the team needed him most and proving himself to be an exceptional performer. He set career highs in points, rebounds, assists and steals in game, tied for the NBA lead this season with three 50-point games, and became an NBA All-Star for the first time. Talent aside, its Tyrese’s contagious positivity and resilience, on and off the court, that make him such a powerful force. He plays tough, even in the most difficult circumstances, and brings out the best in those around him. This season, it’s been nothing short of thrilling to watch Tyrese and Joel’s chemistry on the court, and the amazing partnership they have forged. Excited to watch Tyrese’s star continue to rise, and the impact he will undoubtedly continue to have in Philly.\n\nA living legend is now immortalized in Philadelphia 76ers history. Amazing day on Friday, honoring the one and only Allen Iverson with a sculpture on Legends Walk at our Training Complex in Camden, N.J. “The Answer” changed basketball forever. He was a leader on the court, who proved the value of hard work and tenacity in the face of bigger competition. His impact went beyond the game – he was a cultural icon and trendsetter, who overcame significant challenges, and inspired millions of young athletes in the process. Allen’s basketball credentials speak for themselves: Rookie of the Year, NBA MVP, 11-time All Star, Hall of Famer – the list goes on. But despite his larger-than-life status, it’s easy to forget that Allen is an international superstar. He’s kind and humble, and a role model to so many around the world. Now, every person that steps into our Training Complex will be reminded of Allen’s legacy. Thank you Allen, for everything you have given to the 76ers franchise, the city of Philadelphia, fans around the world, and the game of basketball. One day until the start of playoffs – let’s go!\n\nAfter more than a decade of owning and operating sports teams together, my partner David Blitzer and I have seen firsthand the power of sports to bring people together and change lives. This is especially true for young people, and it’s why we have focused on building a portfolio around youth sports – including Cooperstown All Star Village, Ripken Baseball, WE ARE CAMP, LLC, Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company and others. Today, we’re excited to take that commitment to the next level with the launch of Unrivaled Sports. Unrivaled Sports will bring together our family of youth sports properties, allowing us to maximize opportunities to increase the reach and accessibility of our programs. We’re convening the best and brightest minds in the space to join our mission of positively impacting thousands of kids each year – and as part of that, we’re thrilled to welcome TCG as a strategic partner, and Andrew Campion as Chairman. Sports changed the trajectory of my life, and the lessons I learned – teamwork, discipline, grit – have been instrumental in shaping me into the person I am today. With Unrivaled Sports, we hope to bring the transformative power of sports to kids around the country, particularly for those who might not otherwise have access. Check out the full story here: https://lnkd.in/e76S2zhE, and website here: https://lnkd.in/eAK4fDmR More to come soon – we’re just getting started.\n\nThis offseason, we’re working hard to lay the foundation for a team that can eventually compete for Super Bowls. Free agency is an important step in that process, and our goal was clear: attract key talents to our roster while maintaining flexibility for the upcoming draft and season. Congratulations to Adam Peters and Dan Quinn for their phenomenal leadership during this period. What stands out, beyond their skill for attracting talent, is Adam and Dan’s chemistry and ability to make informed decisions in a constantly shifting environment. Their collaboration has been fun to watch and this type of alignment is crucial for a winning organization. We know the work is just beginning – and we remain so appreciative of our fans’ ongoing support. Looking forward to building through next month’s NFL draft, where we’re fortunate to have 6 picks in the Top 100 – including #2 overall.
