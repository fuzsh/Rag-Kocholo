        "text": "Tanking to the Top: The Philadelphia 76ers and the Most Audacious Process in the History of Professional Sports\n\nby Yaron Weitzman\n\nPublished by Grand Central Publishing on March 17, 2020\n\nNBA // Non-Fiction // 76ers\n\nOne of the best lines in Yaron Weitzman’s NBA book: “Hinkie triggered a culture war.”\n\nTanking to the Top: The Philadelphia 76ers and the Most Audacious Process in the History of Professional Sports deftly explores Hinkie’s Culture War branded as Trust The Process.\n\nSam Hinkie was the GM of the Philadelphia 76ers from 2013 to 2016. In Hinkie’s first season his Sixers won just 19 games and lost 63. Trust The Process?\n\n“Wins were treated as signs of progress. Losses were part of the plan,” said Andrew Sharp, an NBA writer—and Sam Hinkie critic.\n\nThe Process focused on losing as opposed to the typical focus on winning. Which is an odd position for sports (and life. Nobody wants to be a loser; I assume most folks wanna be a winner?).\n\nDetermined losing also conflicts with the emotional makeup of athletes: the best players are optimists. They believe from high school (or earlier sometimes) they can get into the NBA despite the odds. The really great players Kobes and Jordans believe when their team is down 20 they can still come back.\n\nOdds don’t intimated optimists. They’re opportunities.\n\nHence Hinkie’s culture war.\n\nFor most of the book Sam Hinkie operates in the shadows and it reminded me of the Nolan’s The Dark Knight. James Gordon says: “Because we have to chase him. Because he’s the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now, so we’ll hunt him. Because he can take it, because he’s not a hero. He’s a silent guardian, a watchful protector, a Dark Knight.”\n\nAnd so: was Hinkie a hero or did he live long enough to see himself become the villain?\n\nFascinating book covering a unique NBA story.\n\nIt left me so conflicted with so many unresolved emotions.\n\n-28-\n\nSammy Younan is the affable host of My Summer Lair: think NPR’s Fresh Air meets Kevin Smith: interviews & impressions on Pop Culture."
