        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Chris Kaman had 26 points and 10 rebounds, and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Philadelphia 76ers 104-88 on Thursday night in the NBA’s final game of the decade.\n\nClippers coach Mike Dunleavy missed the game after aggravating a herniated disc in his back while at home getting ready to go to Staples Center. Tony Brown, an assistant coach under Dunleavy in Portland and Los Angeles, ran the team in his place.\n\nAll the Clippers’ starters scored in double figures, with Baron Davis contributing 20 points and seven assists. Marcus Camby added 14 points and 10 boards. The Clippers completed a season sweep of the 76ers after losing both meetings in each of the previous two seasons.\n\nLou Williams led Philadelphia with 19 points and Elton Brand had 17 in his first road game against the Clippers since he left town as a free agent. The 76ers, coming off victories over Portland and Sacramento, still haven’t won three in a row this season.\n\nLos Angeles fell behind by as many as 13 points after Brand intercepted a pass by Sebastian Telfair and converted the turnover into a breakaway dunk with 2:46 left in the first quarter to cap a 19-4 run. But the Clippers sliced the margin to 51-49 by halftime, as Kaman led all scorers with 16 points despite missing nine of 15 shots.\n\nLos Angeles pulled ahead for good at 55-52 on a 3-pointer by Rasual Butler with 9 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter and extended the margin to 78-63 on another 3 by Marcus Camby with 6.6 seconds left in the period. The Clippers finished 10 for 16 from behind the arc.\n\nBrand, who signed him to a five-year, $80 million contract in July 2008 after he opted out of his Clippers contract, came off the bench for the ninth straight game. When he reported in with 3:18 left in the first quarter and Philadelphia leading 25-16, he was booed lustily by the crowd of 15,257.\n\nBrand holds the Clippers franchise record with 4,710 rebounds. After he left, Dunleavy accused Brand of backing out of a verbal agreement to return to the Clippers and never giving an explanation. Davis signed with Los Angeles as a free agent prior to that, with the understanding that he would play with Brand.\n\nNOTES: The 76ers are 4-5 since Brand lost his starting power forward spot. … Brand entered this season as one of four active players averaging at least 20 points and 10 rebounds. The others are Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett and Shaquille O’Neal. … The 76ers played on New Year’s Eve for the eighth straight year. They are 3-5, including a 100-92 win over the Clippers at Staples Center last season, and an 83-75 overtime win against them in 2002. Philadelphia’s overall record on Jan. 31 is 7-8. … The Clippers also have played eight straight times on New Year’s Eve (4-4), after having never done so before 2002. All eight games have been at home. … Philadelphia finished the first decade of the 21st Century with a 418-402 regular season record, besides their one appearance in the finals against the Lakers in ’01. … The Clippers finished the decade 311-512, making the playoffs only once and coming within one victory of advancing to the Western Conference finals in 2006. Brand averaged 24.7 points and 10.0 rebounds for them that season."
