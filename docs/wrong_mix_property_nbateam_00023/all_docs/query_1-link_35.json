        "text": "Unless you are in sports broadcasting, you are not promised a job if your dad has a career in any industry. If your Dad owns the company, you may be chosen to ascend to the throne once he steps away. You could graduate college and get a job you don’t deserve in the family business.\n\nThe NBA isn’t such a business. It’s about world-class talent competing against each other on the highest stage. If the discussions are true that teams will draft Bronny James this summer in order to lure his Dad to their franchise, it might be the most pathetic thing I’ve ever heard in pro sports.\n\nBronny James is NOT an NBA talent.\n\nIt is apparent at USC that Bronny is not ready to make a move to the NBA in his freshman campaign. He’s averaging less than six points per game in 20 minutes a night. He shoots 27% from three and just 36% from the field.\n\nCould he one day develop a skill set that could interest the NBA? He absolutely could work hard and improve. Is he going to be even G-League caliber player anytime soon? Nope.\n\nDaddy has a plan.\n\nIn numerous print and electronic media opportunities, LeBron James has spoken about his desire to hang around long enough in the NBA to finish his career on a team with his son.\n\nNow, LeBron does have college eligibility left, so maybe he goes to USC and gets that degree. I’m joking of course, but it’s the only way that these two belong on a court together.\n\nLeBron dangles this desire to the league, and it can only be taken as a ploy to get his son drafted into a league that he hasn’t earned the right to play in. It’s one of the worst cases of nepotism I’ve witnessed, and I am a documented, card carrying LeBron James admirer.\n\nHe has conducted his career without scandal and to a level of greatness that I gladly celebrate. This stunt is embarrassing and beneath him.\n\nNBA GMs just might sell their soul.\n\nA franchise might say it’s worth giving up the last seat on the bench in order to retain the services of LeBron James this summer. If so, that’s pathetic.\n\nIt’s a bad look for LeBron, his son, and the franchise that attempts it. A pro sports career is earned, not awarded. It would be a disservice for a parent to embarrass their son in this way. Bronny James may not even muster the voice to say “Dad, chill out.”\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf LeBron manipulates his son onto an NBA roster, every player in the league will know that only one of the James belongs at this time. That’s not parenting worth celebrating.\n\nWatch The John Kincade Show on the 97.5 The Fanatic YouTube page for discussion about the latest breaking sports news in Philadelphia."
