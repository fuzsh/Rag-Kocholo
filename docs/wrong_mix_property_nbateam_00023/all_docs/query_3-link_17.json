        "text": "What looked like one of the best Clippers offseasons ever just went very, very wrong.\n\nLate Tuesday night, star power forward Elton Brand informed the Philadelphia 76ers that he would sign a five-year deal, worth an estimated $82 million, despite the Clippers’ best last-ditch efforts to keep him.\n\nAbout the same time, swingman Corey Maggette agreed to a deal with Golden State, though the exact amount of that deal wasn’t immediately known. The Associated Press reported Maggette’s deal is for five years and worth $50 million.\n\nTwo league sources told the Daily News that by the end of negotiations with Brand, the Clippers had offered more than $80 million dollars over fiveseasons.\n\n“I don’t understand how this could’ve happened,” one source said. “It clearly wasn’t the money, because (the Clippers) came very close to what Philly offered.”\n\nA message left by the Daily News on Brand’s phone was not returned.\n\nBy moving to Philadelphia, Brand is closer to his hometown in upstate New York, back in the less competitive Eastern Conference and able to join one of the up-and-coming young teams in the league.\n\nStill, his decision came as a shock to the Clippers, who believed Brand would re-sign with the club up until late Monday night and did everything they could to keep him on Tuesday.\n\nBrand, 29, is coming off an Achilles tendon injury, which sidelined him for all but eight games of last season. But the Clippers believed he was healthy and were committed to bringing him back. The former No. 1 overall draft pick had spent nine seasons with the Clippers and had become the face of the franchise.\n\nJust a week ago, the Clippers were dreaming of their newly constructed team, with Baron Davis running the point and Brand as the team’s cornerstone in the middle. When Brand opted out of the final year of his contract June 30, he said that he intended to return to Los Angeles, but wanted to see if the Clippers could make a splash in the free agent market.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, the Clippers pulled off what was the biggest free agent coup in their history by agreeing on a five-year, $65 million deal with Davis.\n\nBut Brand decided to listen to offers from other teams before committing to return. Golden State offered $90 million over five years last week. Philadelphia was interested, but didn’t have enough salary cap space available. Then on Tuesday, Philadelphia cleared an additional $2 million in cap space by trading away Rodney Carney, Calvin Booth and a future No.1 draft pick to Minnesota.\n\nAs soon as Brand’s decision was known Tuesday night, the Clippers immediately dispatched a representative to reach out to Davis.\n\nMessages left by the Daily News on Davis’ cell phone and his agent’s cell phone were not returned.\n\nSo what do the Clippers do next?\n\nThe good news is they have plenty of salary cap space available to pursue other free agents now that Brand and Maggette are off the books, and very little competition to drive up the bidding now that Philadelphia is committed to Brand. Memphis is the only other team with comparable space, but it is not believed to be actively pursuing free agents.\n\nReached on his cell phone Tuesday night, Clippers coach Mike Dunleavy did not want to comment on the Brand or Maggette situations, but said that he was encouraged by the financial commitment owner Donald Sterling had shown in the offers the team had made to Davis and Brand, which totaled more than $140 million over five years combined.\n\nA league source said that the Clippers would immediately make a push for Atlanta forward Josh Smith, but he is a restricted free agent and Atlanta can match any offer sheet he signs."
