        "text": "Philadelphia >> Growing up ensconced in the sports world, Shipley alumnae Katie O’Reilly (formerly Grossman before getting married) couldn’t imagine working in any profession other than sports.\n\n“I grew up playing sports and I really loved it,” said O’Reilly. “It was everything I knew and I was determined to work in sports.”\n\nNot only does O’Reilly get live out her dream every day, she lives it by working for one of the teams she grew up rooting for – the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nO’Reilly, a lifelong Philadelphia sports fan, embraces her role as Senior Vice President of Business Development and Marketing with the same passion she had rooting for them as a child.\n\nWhen the 76ers new hierarchy – that included CEO Scott O’Neill and Chief Sales and Marketing Officer Chris Heck – were hired in the summer of 2013, they knew they someone to handle business development. Their first call was to O’Reilly.\n\n“I thought they were joking,” said O’Reilly with a smile. “I was working for a marketing company in New York at the time when Scott [O’Neil] and Chris [Heck] kept calling and asking me to join them with the 76ers. They weren’t sure what my role would be, but they knew they wanted a business development person who knew the Philadelphia sports landscape.”\n\n“We wanted Katie to come back home,” said Heck. “She was the first call myself and [Scott] O’Neil made. We knew Katie was a super talent that has roots that are important to the Philadelphia sports landscape with each of the professional teams. She understands the nuances and brings the authenticity that helps the entire business model.”\n\nHeck added, “Philadelphia is a parochial town so having an understanding of the landscape is something that is critical and should not be undersold.”\n\nO’Neil added, “We love having Katie in the organization. She is a rising superstar in this business.”\n\nIn addition to her current responsibilities, O’Reilly is on the Board of Governors for the Sixers Innovation Lab.\n\nHoused at the Philadelphia 76ers Training Complex Business Operations Facility, the Sixers Innovation Lab Crafted By Kimball, in partnership with the Wharton School of Business, is wholly operated by the Philadelphia 76ers day-to-day. The Sixers Lab pursues start-ups at the crossroads of sports and consumer products, and the hiring of its Managing Director, Seth Berger, former Founder and CEO of AND1, an American footwear and clothing company.\n\nThe Sixers Innovation Lab Crafted by Kimball is focused on rapidly growing, early stage companies in the consumer space and emphasizes providing individualized attention and flexibility to residents with potential. Applications are rolling for start-up companies and driven entrepreneurs from around the world that impact the crossroads of sports and consumer products. Resident companies will receive office space in the lab furnished by Kimball Office, food, and housing; access to industry experts, executives, and financiers, third-party consulting, legal, accounting, and business solutions services; and the opportunity to pitch industry-leading investors and venture capital firms.\n\nO’Reilly, a University of Michigan graduate, had probably the toughest job she could have as a first job in the business. With the assistance of the University of Michigan alumni office, Madison Square Garden hired O’Reilly for the job of selling tickets for the New York Knicks and New York Rangers.\n\nWhile that may not be a difficult job on the surface, try being a lifelong Philadelphia sports fan tasked with the job of promoting New York sports franchises you were taught not to like.\n\n“It was not the easiest thing for me to do,” a smiling O’Reilly said. “It gave me the opportunity to learn the business and get an understanding of what the fan wants.”\n\nO’Reilly parlayed her short stay at Madison Square Garden into a job with the NBA assisting with best practices for ticket and sponsorship sales.\n\nWhile the product on the court now seems to be heading in the right direction, the business side has been on the incline since O’Reilly’s return home.\n\n“The timing worked out well,” said O’Reilly. “The foundation we have created over the past three years is now coming full circle. There is an incredible surge of interest in our team and we have just moved into a state of the art Business Operations Facility located next to our Basketball Operations Facility at the Philadelphia 76ers Training Complex. Since we are one of three NBA teams to not own their building we have had to travel from our office to our practice facility. It’s an exciting time.”"
