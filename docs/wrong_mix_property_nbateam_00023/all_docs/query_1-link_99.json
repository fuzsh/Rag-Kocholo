        "text": "Joel Embiid suffered another meniscus injury. Fans of the Philadelphia 76ers have heard that news before, but history has repeated itself in the form of yet another pending surgery for the dominant big man and franchise centerpiece.\n\nThe organization’s estimated 4-6 week timeline for the surgery and recovery leaves the possibility that Embiid will return healthy and lead the Sixers into the 2024 NBA Playoffs. However, the situation isn’t that simple.\n\nThe Joel Embiid Conundrum\n\nSixers fans can point to examples of Embiid’s health issues handcuffing the team and mysterious injury situations with other players in the organization. The unfortunate recent history leads to the tongue in cheek belief that the team is cursed with terrible injury luck.\n\nBob Cooney, however, spoke on 97.5 The Fanatic about organizational patterns and Embiid’s injury history as indicators for the way this situation will play out. The misfortunes of the past are very prevalent beyond a mythical curse.\n\n“I’ve seen this too many times…. From Nerlens Noel to Joel Embiid to Ben Simmons, we never get best-case scenarios… I’m saying that in a way that I think ownership doesn’t want to take chances.” -Bob Cooney\n\nEmbiid could reasonably return to basketball activities in 4-6 weeks. It doesn’t mean he’ll be ready to reenter the lineup right away. The Sixers don’t typically like to rush players back once they start working out. The seven-footer also hasn’t always been in great game shape immediately after returning to the lineup after past injuries.\n\nIs it a reasonable expectation that Embiid returns to the lineup and regains MVP form immediately after the timeline plays out? No, and it’s very unlikely this process plays out with no further curveballs in the headlines in Philadelphia.\n\nA Battered Knee\n\nJoel Embiid suffering a meniscus injury is far from an isolated issue. There is no guarantee that the surgery fixes the knee and buries the issue for good. Look at the history of injuries to Embiid’s left knee.\n\n2016-17- A surgery on a torn left meniscus limited the star center to 31 games.\n\n2018-19- Embiid missed 14 total games with a sore left knee.\n\n2020-21- Embiid missed 21 total games mainly because of limitations from a knee injury.\n\n2023-24- The Sixers have lost their best player once again because of a torn left meniscus.\n\nConsider additionally that the decision to undergo surgery in 2017 came because of an injury that occurred on Jan. 27. He missed the remainder of the 2016-17 season. The recent meniscus injury occurred on Jan. 30.\n\nThe organization’s preference for caution and their willingness to push back injury timelines could very well mean that the reigning NBA MVP doesn’t suit up again for the 76ers in 2023-24.\n\n“Who says that Nico Batum isn’t going to keep getting hurt? Who says that Marcus Morris (will be healthy)? Who says that Tyrese Maxey, who already missed a lot of time, might not twist another ankle? You have no room for error to think that you can carry on until he gets back. You’re a borderline playoff team without him, in my mind, for the rest of the year.” -Bob Cooney\n\nListen to Tom McGinnis on 97.5 The Fanatic, the flagship radio partner of the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n14 NBA 1st-Overall Picks Who Played for the Philadelphia 76ers\n\nColin Newby is a contributor for 97.5 The Fanatic who transitions Beasley Media's radio content onto digital platforms.
