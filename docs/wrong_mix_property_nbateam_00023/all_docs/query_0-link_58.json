        "text": "The Sixers have officially survived 10 days in the Orlando bubble and their first week of mid-season training camp. Here are my biggest takeaways from the team’s first week back on the court: Starting lineup change? The biggest news out of Sixers training camp (though not necessarily surprising) is that Shake Milton has been practicing as the starting point guard, alongside Tobias...\n\nAfter the Sixers boarded the plane on Thursday afternoon to head to Orlando, Florida, to enter “the bubble” for the NBA’s restart, Tobias Harris got on the speaker before takeoff. “Welcome back, y’all. Welcome back!” The laughs echoed through the rows of empty seats (as mandated by the NBA’s health and safety handbook) on the Sixers’ chartered plane. Upon arrival to the...\n\nUpdated: Sunday, 1:27 p.m. The Sixers’ newest addition, Ryan Broekhoff, did not travel with the team to Orlando on Thursday afternoon. Broekhoff tweeted Sunday that he stayed home so that he could focus on his family after his wife tested positive for COVID-19. “It hasn’t been an easy decision, by any means, to come back,” he said on July 1. “I have a...\n\nA clean-shaven, perfectly trimmed Brett Brown picked up our video call on Friday afternoon, quite a difference from the bearded Sixers head coach we’ve become accustomed to. “My son, truly,” Brown told NBC Sports Philadelphia with a laugh when explaining his new look. “He takes great pride in it. He’s my barber.” Along with hair cuts and long walks with his dog, whom he proclaimed is...\n\nWe all have those individuals who inspired us as kids. Maybe it was a teacher who took the extra time to make sure you knew that they cared. Maybe it was the grandmother who never said “no,” or the neighbor who always made sure you had enough to eat. Maybe it was a coach who always made you believe in…\n\nSixers general manager Elton Brand joined NBC Sports Philadelphia for a video interview Tuesday morning to discuss preparing for the NBA draft, free agency, Ben Simmons’ recovery, a vacant spot in the team’s front office, and the possibility of resuming play amid the coronavirus pandemic. Elton, human interaction is such a big part of what you do. What are some of the creative ways...\n\nSixers guard Josh Richardson has often been described as the Sixers’ “dot connector,” and the “glue guy” that does all the little things. So, it’s no surprise that Richardson brought the detail on fashion in our latest NBA style segment. We went back to the days of Wilt Chamberlain embracing the chest-baring trends to Dr. J’s swag, to Phil Jackson’s overalls and Dennis Rodman animal prints, to...\n\nIt’s easy to love Furkan Korkmaz’s story. The Istanbul, Turkey, native was largely unknown to Sixers fans when the team drafted him 26th overall in 2016 when he was just 18 years old. Although there were glimpses of what he could be (the first being when he dropped 40 points in a Summer League game), virtually no one, including Korkmaz himself, thought...\n\nHave you ever wondered how the Philadelphia 76ers got their name? Maybe you haven’t … because it’s now so synonymous with the city that it’s hard to imagine the Sixers being called anything else. But there was a time when the name wasn’t so popular. “I remember thinking, this was the worst name I’ve ever heard. I absolutely hated...\n\nSince the news of the NBA’s hiatus nearly four weeks ago, the Sixers’ staff has been committed to helping the team’s players through all facets of this crisis. “From Day 1, we were ready to take care of our players,” said Lorena Torres, the team’s Performance Director, who was creating individualized workout plans the night the NBA announced its suspension...."
