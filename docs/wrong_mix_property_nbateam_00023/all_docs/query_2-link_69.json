        "text": "Jackson Frank, the new Sixers beat writer for PhillyVoice, is out of the job after tweeting in “solidarity” with Palestine in response to the team’s statement about Israel.\n\n“Mr. Frank is no longer employed by PhillyVoice.com as of today,” PhillyVoice.com CEO Hal Donnelly told The Post in a statement.\n\n“We stand with everyone who is absolutely outraged by the senseless attacks in Israel, by the loss of innocent lives and violence against civilians.”\n\nReached by The Post, Frank declined to comment.\n\n“We stand with the people of Israel and join them in mourning the hundreds of innocent lives lost to terrorism at the hands of Hamas,” the Sixers tweeted Sunday, adding the hashtag #StandWithIsrael.\n\nFrank responded in a quote-tweet, writing, “This post sucks! Solidarity with Palestine always.”\n\nFrank just joined the Sixers beat last month after writer Kyle Neubeck left PhillyVoice for All-City’s PHLY startup.\n\nFrank has since deleted his account on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nAt least 800 Israelis and nine Americans have been reported dead from the attacks, which occurred Saturday on the Jewish holiday Simchat Torah.\n\nAmong the dead were 260 concert-goers killed at the Tribe of Nova music festival, when a number of Palestinian terrorists paraglided into Israel over the Gaza Strip border."
