        "text": "March 23, 2012\n\nThose who have known me for quite awhile actually can remember when I wasn't a Spurs fan. Before I developed hometown love for David Robinson, Tim Duncan, and the Spurs, I only worshipped at one basketball idol - Dr. J. He was the man. THE MAN. And although I never was able to see him play (sat out the one exhibition game I attended against the Sixers in SA), from the late 70's to the mid 80's, I was a 76ers fan just as much as a Dolphin and Dodger fan. And just like those other two teams, the Sixers broke my heart again and again. The Lakers and the Celtics were the main villains, but there were other teams and other setbacks that were just as crushing. Finally, in 1982, the Sixers made the bold move to get the man to push the team over the top. Moses. No, not that Moses (although the effect was the same), Moses Malone. A rebounding machine who was unlike any other player in the NBA. I once saw him shoot the ball 5 times right at the basket, rebound it 5 times, and then finally make the basket. Dominance!! MY team was set to make a run. And they did. They did dominate. And this book gives over a 100 vignettes and stories on the players, games, and final championship they won (seemingly for me). is it well written? Nope. No groundbreaking material here. But if you want to get insights on the players (Bobby Jones!) and some of the background information behind the highlights of the season, this book does the job. And thankfully so. Although at the time I envisioned a decade worth of championships, it was not to be. The team grew lazy the next year and lost to the lowly Nets. Andrew Toney got hurt. Bobby Jones and Dr. J grew old. Moses became disgruntled. Mo Cheeks felt underpaid. Even the great Round Mound of Rebound, Charles Barkley couldn't stem the tide. It was over for the Sixers, and as soon as Dr. J retired, I became a Spurs fan (whose best players at the time were Alvin Robertson and the Brick). Tough days indeed. But things would soon change...."
