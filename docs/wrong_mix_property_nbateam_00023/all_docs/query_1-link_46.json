        "text": "The group that owns the New Jersey Devils and the Philadelphia 76ers, Harris Blitzer Sports and Entertainment, will temporarily be reducing some staff salaries. A source confirmed a report by Marc Stein of the New York Times on Monday night, saying at-will employees making $50,000 a or more will be subjected to a 20 percent reduction from April 15 through June.\n\nAn earlier version of the story stated that the company intended to repay the difference. However, the a Devils' spokesperson said the company did not make that promise.\n\nThe team presidents of both teams, Jake Reynolds of the Devils and Chris Heck of the 76ers, as well as Philadelphia general manager Elton Brand and HBSE CEO Scott O’Neil agreed to participate in the program.\n\nO'Neil addressed the news in a statement.\n\n“As we navigate this evolving COVID-19 environment, we are mindful of the long-term impact the suspension of live events and games will have on our organization and industry,\" he said. \"To ensure we can continue to support and operate our businesses during these uncertain times without reducing our workforce, we are asking our full-time, salaried employees to temporarily reduce their pay by up to 20 percent and move to a four-day week.\n\n\"In addition to supporting our people, we are committed to playing an ongoing role in funding efforts to help the most impacted residents in our home cities. In the coming days, we will enter into additional partnerships in Philadelphia, Camden and Newark to assist our neighbors with food and resource distribution during this public health crisis.”\n\nThe NHL and NBA have suspended operations indefinitely amid the COVID-19 pandemic and all events at Prudential Center, which is owned and operated by HBSE, have been canceled through March.\n\nDEVILS: Here are five questions facing them with the NHL season suspended\n\nOwners and managing partners Josh Harris and David Blitzer have been paying hourly and event staff at Prudential Center during the unprecedented shutdown and pledged to do so for all postponed games and concerts.\n\nThis salary reduction program is a way to prevent layoffs. Health benefits and 401K plans were not affected.\n\nAll arenas and large-scale entertainment venues are in the same situation right now, losing money without the ability to bring in revenue from tickets, concessions, parking and corporate events. An HBSE staffer who asked to remain anonymous said employees were made aware in a meeting Monday and were told it was a unanimous decision and management cited a desire to keep each staff member in place during this time period.\n\nAn at-will employee is classified as one that can be fired at any time, for any reason, with the exception of some legality.\n\nAbbey Mastracco is the Devils beat writer for NorthJersey.com.
