It was Moses Malone who, in the days before the playoffs, gave the team its battle cry. Asked by coach Billy Cunningham how he thought things would go in the playoffs, Moses said, \"Fo', fo', fo'\" - meaning, in Moses' shorthand, that he expected the Sixers to sweep each of the three series they would need to play in order to win a championship. In Pat Williams' Tales from the 76ers, the former Sixers general manager writes about those Sixers - the transcendent talents (and personalities like Julius Erving, Bobby Jones, Maurice Cheeks, and Andrew Toney) that made them special, the years of heartache that preceded the championship run, and a season that was surprisingly devoid of drama.\n\nSkyhorse Publishing, as well as our Sports Publishing imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in sportsÂ—books about baseball, pro football, college football, pro and college basketball, hockey, or soccer, we have a book about your sport or your team.\n\nWhether you are a New York Yankees fan or hail from Red Sox nation; whether you are a die-hard Green Bay Packers or Dallas Cowboys fan; whether you root for the Kentucky Wildcats, Louisville Cardinals, UCLA Bruins, or Kansas Jayhawks; whether you route for the Boston Bruins, Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, or Los Angeles Kings; we have a book for you.
