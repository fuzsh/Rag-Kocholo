        "text": "As Managing Director of Pan, I head up an editorial and communications team that prides itself in responsiveness and attention to detail. We deliver exceptional sales results alongside excellent care for our authors and their careers. Pan is a bestseller powerhouse and home to a broad range of titles across fiction and non-fiction.\n\nWhether it’s fiction or real life, I love a story - especially one I can’t put down from the first page on. As a publisher, I value a clear proposition. As a reader, I relish an eccentric twist. More than anything, I love variety and the infinite possibilities to be found between the covers of a great paperback book . . .\n\nAs well as overseeing all the commercial publishing for Pan Macmillan hardbacks, Pan paperbacks and the Macmillan Business, Mantle and Tor imprints, I am also enormously proud to be publisher of Lucinda Riley and her wonderful legacy.\n\nAs Pan Fiction Publisher I lead the commercial fiction strategy and team in order to deliver for our stellar list of authors as well as being on the hunt for exciting new voices from crime and thriller to reading group and beyond.\n\nI started my career at Penguin Random House, initially in non-fiction before moving to fiction, where I was part of the team who published Fifty Shades and Wool. I then moved to Orion where I published a range of bestselling authors including Steve Cavanagh, Victoria Aveyard and Kitty Neale, whilst acquiring new voices including Winnie M Li and John Sutherland.\n\nIn terms of what I am looking for, I love a great commercial plot that delivers on a killer hook. Authors over the last few years I wish I’d published include Sarah Vaughan, Lisa Jewell, Stuart Turton, Janice Hallett and Taylor Jenkins Reid.\n\nMy authors at Pan Macmillan included David Baldacci, Peter James, Araminta Hall, CL Miller and Ellery Lloyd.\n\nI'm a Publishing Director for Pan Fiction, with a focus on our general commercial fiction and romance lists.\n\nBefore joining Pan Macmillan in 2024, I spent much of my career at Penguin Random House where I published bestselling authors including Holly Smale, Kirsty Greenwood, Phillipa Ashley, Laura Jane Williams, Katie Flynn and Emma Heatherington. My authors have been Sunday Times bestsellers as well as book club picks for BBC Radio 2, Reese Witherspoon and Good Morning America.\n\nI'm looking for books that introduce memorable characters, have a stand-out hook, and a strong voice. I tend to publish stories that centre women – they are not always romance, but are often about love. I also have a soft spot for books with speculative or magical elements.\n\nAt Pan, I am lucky to work with authors including Rosie Walsh, Sally Hepworth, Lulu Taylor, Elaine Everest and Annie Murray.\n\nI’m a huge crime and thriller fiction fan and this is where my focus has been while growing my list under the Macmillan and Pan imprints. There’s nothing quite like being immersed in a gripping crime novel or a sensational thriller that hooks you in and doesn’t let go until the final page and that feeling is something I’m constantly searching for when reading submissions. I’m always interested in manuscripts that have unique voices and hooks, breathtaking twists, stylish writing, driving plots and a strong sense of place in either contemporary or historical settings.\n\nAs part of the Pan team, I’ve worked with some of our biggest brand authors including Peter James and David Baldacci, and I also oversee the heritage publishing of Douglas Adams. My list aims to span the spectrum of crime and thriller fiction – from evocative historical crime to razor-sharp psychological thrillers, heart-warming cosy crime to intricately plotted police procedurals and upmarket international thrillers from around the world. My authors include Robbie Morrison, D. V. Bishop, Hayley Scrivenor, Ruth Kelly, R. L. Graham, Lin Anderson and L T Shearer. My authors have won, or been shortlisted or longlisted for CWA daggers, the McIlvanney Prize, The Wilbur Smith Adventure Writing Prize and the HWA Debut Crown.\n\nReading for me is all about escapism; but my favourite books are those that, whilst taking us someplace wholly different, make us love our own funny world just that little bit more.\n\nAs Commissioning Editor across the fiction lists, I have started to build my own diverse list of exciting commercial fiction. I'm proud to have acquired and be publishing the brilliant B. K. Borison, Simone Soltani, Cameron Capello, Salma Ibrahim and Ally Carter and also have had the wonderful pleasure of working on novels from some of our most-loved authors, including Araminta Hall, Percival Everett and Charlotte Mendelson.\n\nIn terms of what I have an eye out for - I tend to love compelling women's fiction, even more so with a speculative twist, stories that bring magic to the mundane and heart-wrenching romances that aren't afraid to play about with popular tropes. Whether it be visceral and poignant writing that asks big questions or strong and passionate characters that make life seem a little more achievable - nothing beats a transporting book that's effects linger well after being sent back to reality.\n\nI joined Pan in Spring 2023, bringing with me an in-depth knowledge of the retail landscape, having previously worked in both Sales and Editorial at Orion. I am building my own commercial fiction list, while also working on some of Pan’s biggest and best-loved brand authors, including Danielle Steel and Lucinda Riley.\n\nI am passionate about publishing bold, vibrant fiction, with a striking package to match. I am looking for: narratives with an unusual setting or strong sense of place; stories with a touch of magic; escapist romcoms and inclusive love stories; upmarket commercial fiction with sharp dialogue and pacy plotting; crossover or speculative fiction, and contemporary retellings of myths, folklore and legends.\n\nSome of my all-time favourite reads are: Book Lovers by Emily Henry, The Ex Hex by Erin Sterling, The Dead Romantics by Ashley Poston, Such a Fun Age by Kiley Reid, and Circe by Madeline Miller.\n\nI have long admired the publishing of Pan Fiction’s prestigious and innovative team, and as Editor, I have the pleasure of assisting Francesca Pathak and Alex Saunders on stalwarts of the crime/thriller genre - such as Peter James, David Baldacci and Jeffrey Archer - as well as fresh, emerging voices in this space.\n\nHaving previously worked at Avon, HarperCollins, I value a strong commercial hook and a clear proposition that will grab readers from the get go. Beyond providing propulsive plots replete with twists and turns, I believe exceptional crime/thriller fiction is that which brings passion and nuance to the page, examining wider issues in a way that is both compelling and accessible.\n\nI particularly enjoy: thrillers laced with deliciously dark humour, gothic thrillers brimming with suspense and atmosphere, and genre mashups that push the boundaries of traditional understandings of what a crime or thriller novel is or should be.\n\nSince joining in 2021, I had the pleasure of working across a number of commercial titles on the Pan Fiction list. From brand authors such as Karen Swan, Peter James, Ann Cleeves and Ken Follett, to author who push the borders such as Blake Crouch, John Marrs, Robert Dinsdale, Lola Jaye and Dr Amir Khan.\n\nI have always loved the escapism a book could offer, whisking a reader into worlds and experiences at time recognisable, while at times beyond our reality. I enjoy tales across all genres, but I particularly enjoy those touched with inspiration from ancient history, mythologies and folklores from around the world.\n\nAs I look to start my list, I wish to find stories that bring new characters, with a feminist edge, from lesser-known mythologies to life in the vein of Circe by Madeleine Miller. I am keen to find vivid stories that convey human experiences, from diverse perspectives and across time periods to present to new audiences. Ultimately, I seek escapist reads that transport you into worlds beyond your own, expose you to new and relatable experiences. I appreciate well-loved romantic tropes, a historical setting, a dash of magic (light and dark), loveable but complex characters, with plots that keep the reader at the edge of their seat and wanting to share the book at the end. Recent favourites of mine are Honey & Spice by Bolu Babalola, Make a Scene by Mimi Grace, Hemlock Island by Kelley Armstrong and Edge Of Here by Kelechi Okafor.\n\nSince joining the Pan team in August 2022, I have had the joy of supporting the team on fantastic brand authors and upcoming sensations, including Kristin Hannah, Ann Cleeves, Alexandra Potter and C. M. Ewan, and currently work with Katie Loughnane and Trisha Jackson on their dynamic lists.\n\nI love fiction that speaks to the experience of what it means to be human, the highs and, at times, crashing lows that say something revealing about ourselves and the world we live in. Books that can tackle the complexity of life in an accessible way - such as combining the absurdity of humour with grief, or exploring histories untold from fresh perspectives - all really excite me. As do thrillers with pacy writing and plot, serving twist after twist, right through to fiction with a character-driven, emotional pull that keeps me curious and eager to devour the next book. I am on the lookout for stories that have interesting talking points and a ‘book club’ feel, with strong commercial appeal that I can see flying off the shelves.\n\nI joined Pan Macmillan in 2024 and work closely with Pan Fiction Publisher, Francesca Pathak, across the fiction list. I am lucky enough to assist Fran’s incredible list of authors, including C. M. Ewan, Alice Feeney, Araminta Hall, C. L. Miller and Blake Crouch. To be able to work with market-leading authors alongside such a wonderful, hard-working and close-knit team is a privilege.\n\nI value thoughtful and clever storytelling, as well as an engaging and well-developed plot. I am particularly passionate about championing women’s voices and their fiction and am thrilled that we publish some of the female giants of crime and thriller publishing. A great book to me is character-driven with a narrative about being human. I like to be transported to other people’s stories as an escape, and books that can relate to the human condition and emotion sit perfectly in that field.\n\nSome of my recent favourite novels include Martyr (Kaveh Akbar), One of the Good Guys (Araminta Hall), and Mongrel (Hanako Footman).\n\nI’m a publishing director for Pan non fiction, focusing on books with a strong commercial bent in the areas of celebrity, music, pop culture, true crime, history/military history. On the celebrity side my authors include Louis Theroux, Elton John, Michael McIntyre, Mariah Carey, David Bailey and Amanda Owen (aka the Yorkshire Shepherdess) whose 5 books have all been top 10 bestsellers.\n\nI am also proud to have published the bestselling Lily’s Promise, by Holocaust survivor Lily Ebert and her great-grandson Dov and The Happiest Man on Earth by Eddie Jaku and am always looking for stories that inspire.\n\nI have two bestselling titles with Robert Hardman – Queen of Our Times and Charles III: New Reign, New Court, The Inside Story – and a forthcoming book on D-Day that is a tie-in to a TV series.\n\nI lead our new Macmillan Business imprint and also publish broadly across Pan Non-fiction.\n\nIn Macmillan Business, I am seeking expert thinkers at the top of their field and trusted voices who command large audiences. The books can be narrative or more prescriptive, but what matters is that they are exciting, smart, important and genuinely useful. My authors on the list include Bent Flyvbjerg, world expert on project management; Melonie Parker, Chief Diversity Officer at Google; and Matt Abrahams, host of the hit global podcast Think Fast, Talk Smart.\n\nIn the Pan non-fiction list, I am drawn to thought-leaders and engaging titles that present new ideas about the world around us, irrespective of subject matter. I am also a sucker for a good story, including by leading figures in sport. Some of my authors, past and present include: Jacinda Ardern, Angela Merkel, Robin Ince, Isabel Hardman, John Kampfner, Chris Kamara, Martin O’Neill, Nicola Sturgeon, Alice Loxton and Mensun Bound.\n\nI love working closely with authors to develop their ideas into books and publishing bestsellers with both prominent names and debut authors who have something vital to say.\n\nI have worked in commercial non-fiction for over 15 years and I unashamedly love pop culture, sport, music, true crime and a deep dive into internet culture. I also love to publish agenda-setting and compelling memoirs.\n\nI have originated and acquired multiple books that have hit both the Sunday Times and New York Times bestsellers list, including the #1 spot. My authors include Rick Astley; Lisa Marie Presley; Adrian Edmondson; Jill Halfpenny; Dan Biggar; Tom Felton; Molly-Mae Hague; Christian Lewis; Mindy Kaling; Lily Collins; and Dan Howell + Phil Lester.\n\nMany of my books have accompanied or been the origin for television: Skint Estate (HBO and BBC’s ‘Rain Dogs’); Masters of the Air (Apple TV); Catching a Serial Killer (ITV’s ‘A Confession’); Slave (BBC's ‘Doing Money’); The Gold (BBC); I’ll Die After Bingo (in development).\n\nI’m a Commissioning Editor in the Pan Macmillan non-fiction team. I’m a guilt-free lover of all things popular culture from social media and reality TV to podcasts and music. My eclectic taste is reflected in my publishing career as in recent years I’ve worked with a diverse range of authors, from global superstars BTS to social media trendsetters like Molly-Mae, comedians Mo Gilligan and Ade Edmondson and every day inspirations like Christian Lewis who walked the UK’s coastline for charity.\n\nI’m generating ideas and commissioning commercial non-fiction in my own right at Pan Macmillan. For me, spotting people with special talents and incredible stories and helping them turn their ideas into the perfect book is at the core of what we do here. I’m always excited to find out what’s resonating with people and why; capturing cultural moments, creating conversations and engaging readers from all walks of life.\n\nSince joining the Pan Macmillan team at the start of 2024, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside our Publishing Director Mike Harpley on the Non-fiction and Macmillan Business lists on books from prominent personalities like Angela Merkel, Kim Scott, Alice Loxton and David Epstein.\n\nI’m drawn to books from experts in their respective fields, uncovering unique perspectives that challenge conventional wisdom. From political strategies to business models, historical accounts to radical ideas, I love books that broaden our horizons by asking–and answering–questions about our world.\n\nI assist across the Pan Non-Fiction and Macmillan Business imprints, and working in particular with Sara Cywinski and Lydia Ramah and their incredible authors, from Christian Lewis and Dan Biggar to Rick Astley and Lisa Marie Presley.\n\nI’m drawn towards memoirs and stories that really draw you in with their lyricism, celebrate diverse backgrounds, including those that are queer and neurodiverse, and especially those that explore the darker sides of our every-day lives – even better with tongue-in-cheek humour.\n\nOverall, I’m excited about books that bring fresh perspectives, help readers reflect or start conversations, and ultimately transform how we see ourselves and the world around us.­­"
