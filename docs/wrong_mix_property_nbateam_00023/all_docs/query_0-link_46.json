        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers have hired Elton Brand as general manager, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski:\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers hired Elton Brand as general manager on Tuesday, completing a meteoric rise in the franchise’s front office, league sources told ESPN.\n\nBrand made a strong impression on ownership and coach Brett Brown in the interview process, beating out several more-experienced candidates inside and outside the Sixers organization, sources said. Ultimately, ownership believed Brand had sold them on vision, preparedness and the ability to grow into the role at a crucial time for the organization.\n\nBrand, 39, had been recently promoted to executive vice president of basketball operations after serving the past year as GM of the Sixers’ G League affiliate in Delaware.\n\nEarlier this month, Shams Charania of The Athletic reported that the Sixers were planning to interview Brand, Ned Cohen, Marc Eversley and Alex Rucker for the job.\n\nBrand played in the NBA for 17 years, making two All-Star teams and spending time with the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, 76ers, Dallas Mavericks and Atlanta Hawks.\n\nOver the course of his career, Brand averaged 15.9 points, 8.5 rebounds, 1.9 blocks and 1.7 steals per game."
