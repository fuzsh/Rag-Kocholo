By 2018, he was the general manager.\n\nThat’s how fast the NBA’s upper-management track can be.\n\nThat’s how it might work, Brand believes, for Jameer Nelson, who has joined the Sixers as a scout and a minor-league assistant GM.\n\n“Watching him closely in the last few years, he was very talented and well-respected in the Philadelphia area and our community,” Brand said Monday. “So we wanted to see what he wanted to do.”\n\nNelson is the All-Delco guard from Chester High who became an NBA All-Star. He retired at age 35 after the 2018 season, and was interested in remaining in the game.\n\n“We had a few breakfasts over the years, and a few lunches,” Brand said. “I told him to pick a lane. And he decided to pick management. So he’ll get an opportunity in the G-League to cut his teeth. Once that season starts up, he’s going to learn a lot there. He’s also going to be a scout because he has an eye for talent, working throughout the Philadelphia and Chester area for many years.\n\n“The goal for him is to be in management. And I have no doubt that he will be successful and bring a lot to our organization.”\n\nUnlike Brand, Nelson never played for the Sixers. But he became an area basketball legend both at Chester and Saint Joseph’s University, where he was the consensus national Player of the Year.\n\n“I think that former players who are basketball-smart like Jameer can really lend a lot to an organization,” said Daryl Morey, the Sixers’ new president of basketball operations. “Jameer can really add a lot to an organization and he brings a perspective that’s extremely valuable.”\n\n* * *\n\nThe news having broken a week earlier, the Sixers formally appointed Morey Monday.\n\n“This is an exciting day for Philadelphia basketball,” managing partner Josh Harris said. “Last year was difficult. We clearly didn’t deliver. I left the bubble resolute that we were going to do our best to improve the front-office.\n\n“In the midst of our coaching search, Doc Rivers became available. When a championship coach of Doc’s stature becomes available, you don’t hesitate to move quickly. Within a week, Doc and we had agreed that he would come to Philadelphia.\n\n“We are excited to have Daryl Morey, one of the best executives in the NBA. When talent like Doc and Daryl become available, you move quickly.”\n\n* * *\n\nWhile formally introducing Morey Monday, Josh Harris confirmed what he called “a long-term” contract extension for Brand.\n\nUnder Brand, who in 2018-2019 found a way to bring Jimmy Butler into the organization for half a season, the Sixers have a 94-61 record and have twice reached the playoffs.\n\n“I appreciate the confidence Josh Harris and this organization have shown in me with this extension,” Brand said. “From the moment I arrived in Philadelphia, my goal has been to find a way to bring a championship to this city and our fans.\n\n“I love this city, I love our fans and I will do whatever it takes to help this franchise succeed. This offseason, this organization has added two of the most respected and accomplished leaders in the NBA, Daryl Morey as president of basketball operations and Doc Rivers as head coach. I’m excited to work and grow with this group.”\n\n* * *\n\nMorey won’t sit around long in his new role. The NBA Draft is Nov. 18 and the Sixers have the No. 21 overall pick and four second-round opportunities.\n\n“The good thing is that Elton has been working hard on those five picks,” Morey said. “But there’s actually more work in the draft when you don’t have a pick, because you are either buying a pick or going after undrafted guys.\n\n“We haven’t even had a meeting yet, but we’ll be ready. They’re ready and obviously were preparing for six months before and during the bubble.”\n\n* * *\n\nRivers continues to express confidence that the Sixers will improve in 2020-21.\n\n“Listen, I think we have a loaded roster,” he said. “I really do. I love a lot of the guys. I think we’re deep. We have to get in the lab, though, and see what we actually have, and see if it will work and fit. And I think it will fit.”\n\nOriginally Published: November 2, 2020 at 11:30 p.m."
