        "text": "A busy offseason continues for the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nAccording to Shams Charania of The Athletic, the Sixers have signed general manager Elton Brand to a multiyear contract extension.\n\nBrand, 41, is set to begin his third season as Philadelphia's GM after being promoted to the role in Sept. 2018. Charania's report also indicates that Daryl Morey, who was reportedly named the Sixers' new President of Basketball Operations on Oct. 29 (AEDT), will be introduced by the franchise on Nov. 3 (AEDT).\n\nThus continues the busy offseason in which Philadelphia relieved head coach Brett Brown of his duties and hired Doc Rivers to take over the same position.\n\nAfter the 2019-20 season ended in disappointment for the 76ers, the team has retooled its coaching staff and made additions to the front office in order to get things back on track for the upcoming 2020-21 NBA season.\n\nThe first order of business for the new staff will be the 2020 NBA Draft on Nov. 19 (AEDT), as the Sixers own five (Nos. 21, 34, 36, 49 and 58) picks."
