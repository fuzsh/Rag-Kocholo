        "text": "NBA fans are not shy about suggesting the referees are on the take when their favorite team is not getting calls in a losing effort. But it is not just fans who feel that way.\n\nFormer Boston Celtics player and assistant coach Evan Turner shared how then-Philadelphia 76ers teammate Elton Brand believed the Sixers had to beat not only the Celtics in the 2012 East semis but the refs as well on an episode of the “Gil’s Arena” podcast.\n\n“You know we’re going to have to win by 15 just to win by 1,” Brand told Turner via The Finder’s Tom Haberstroh. “If we (win) this game, you know how much the NBA is going to lose?”\n\n“Bro, this is the NBA. It’s entertainment. LeBron (James) and the (Miami) Heat are waiting,” he continued. “Would you rather watch the Celtics or the Sixers play the Heat?”\n\n“I’m going to be honest with you … I’m on the team and I wouldn’t even want to watch the Sixers play the Heat,” said Brand, who advised Turner to take the money and enjoy the ride regardless.\n\nEven so, as Haberstroh is sure to note in the article that gave rise to this post, if the refs were really trying to help Boston, why foul out Paul Pierce with nearly four minutes to play? The world may never know. Or maybe they already do.\n\nListen to the “Celtics Lab” podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi"
