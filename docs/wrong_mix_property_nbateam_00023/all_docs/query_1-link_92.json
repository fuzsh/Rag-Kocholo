And deservedly so. Back-to-back 50-win seasons don’t grow on trees.\n\nBut Brand spiraled away from the fluffy theme when he revealed under relentless questioning that Joel Embiid might not be healthy enough to begin the playoffs.\n\nEmbiid wasn’t healthy last spring and the Sixers beat the Miami Heat in five games to advance to the second round.\n\nBut before you say what else is new, there’s no denying this injury is more serious than the orbital fracture that sidelined Embiid for two playoff games last year. Embiid missed 14 of the Sixers’ last 24 games this season, essentially due to a sore left knee. There were a couple of occasions he declined to speak to the media after games, which rarely has been his M.O.\n\nAdditionally the Sixers have five centers, or guys who can play center, on their roster. Greg Monroe is the most recent addition. In the regular season finale against the Chicago Bulls, he assisted on a basket for another center, Amir Johnson.\n\nAdd the evidence together, including Brand’s reluctance to categorically deny Embiid was a full go, and you have serious red flags.\n\nSixers coach Brett Brown didn’t deny the word of his GM but said he expected all of his starters to play until told differently. Moments later he ran out of patience when asked to clarify Embiid’s status.\n\n“Let me just say this for everybody,” Brown said. “The club will make the statement in a clearer way than I guess I have about Joel. OK? We’ll put out something that is fair. I get your questions but I’m done answering them.”\n\nGive Brand, the first-year exec, a T for transparency. He was truthful from the beginning. Said Embiid was doing everything in his power to be ready for the playoffs. Said it three times, with conviction.\n\n“I’m optimistic he plays this weekend,” Brand bravely said. “But it’s how he feels. I think he’ll present well and he’ll be ready but you don’t know.”\n\nOther than his word, Brand was unable to describe what made him so optimistic about Embiid’s participation chances other than the abundance of guts. It was tough explaining why the big guy seems to fade physically as the season wears on. Brand offered truth and hope.\n\n“When I was in Miami, we had a short meeting and he was on his way to hydro work, which is underwater treadmill,” Brand said. “He’s working his butt off to be ready. He’s focused on his diet. He’s focused on his body. So, I’m optimistic.”\n\nSpeaking of bodies, in recent years it’s been a struggle for Embiid to stay in playing shape during injury absences. The guy is a little like us in that respect, albeit at 7-0, 275 pounds. In a limited state of mobility, he can gain weight just looking at a Grandma’s chocolate chip cookie pack, a cheese steak or a triple bacon burger with cheese.\n\nThough there’s plenty of recovery time between NBA playoff games, you still need to be healthy enough to play.\n\nWhen Embiid’s right, there’s no denying his dominance. He averaged 27.5 points and 13.6 boards in the regular season. Embiid led the Sixers to back-to-back 50-victory seasons for the first time since 1984-86. He made the all-star team along with Ben Simmons.\n\nBrand is proud of being part of that as well as adding Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler, the fourth-quarter closer, through trades. He re-signed shooter JJ Redick, who he said is having a career year.\n\nBrand said his expectations have changed since the start of the season, but in a good way.\n\n“Now I’m confident we can make a deep playoff run,” he said. “My goal and my expectation is to definitely get past where we got last year with this team. We got to the second round, we lost to Boston. I expect us to pass that.”\n\nBrand said that knowing what the extent Embiid’s knee injury. He said that knowing the Sixers’ bench isn’t the conference’s deepest. Said that because the starting five is 8-2 playing together.\n\n“There won’t be a time where you won’t have Tobias, Jimmy, Joel, JJ or Ben out there on the court,” Brand said. “There will be at least two or even three of those players. I think the talent will trump cohesion on other teams because we’re very talented with our first five.”\n\nFirst four players, we shall see.\n\nGet ready, Monroe. The Sixers still need you, Johnson. Jonah Bolden, get healthy, you may be needed to play the pivot. Boban Marjanovic – is it too much to ask you to work on some speed drills?\n\nTo get to where they think they can be, the Sixers need Embiid.\n\nPreferably with two healthy knees.\n\nOriginally Published: April 10, 2019 at 7:27 p.m."
