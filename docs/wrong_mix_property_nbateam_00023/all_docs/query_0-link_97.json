        "text": "When the 76ers fell behind by double-digits to the New Orleans Hornets, it was Evan Turner who sparked the team in the second quarter, Spencer Hawes who came out hitting shots in the third quarter, Jrue Holiday who closed out the comeback in the final four minutes.\n\nHowever, as the Sixers ran up and down the court during those final three quarters, there was one voice that echoed above the noise coming from the speakers and the crowd.\n\n‘It was by design,’ veteran forward Elton Brand said of his urgings as the Sixers willed their way to a winning road trip with a 101-93 win in New Orleans. ‘I have to keep these guys going. We are better than that defensively.’\n\nTonight when the 76ers play their home opener against the Detroit Pistons, they will do so as the early leaders of the Atlantic Division. The Celtics (4-3) have appeared aged and brittle and their success depends less on their Big Three of Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen and Paul Pierce, but on their Big One, Rajon Rondo. The Knicks (2-4) are confirming that their backcourt-bereft attempt to build a Dream Team with Carmelo Anthony, Amare Stoudemire and Tyson Chandler is destined for mediocrity.\n\nSo the Sixers will take the FirstStates Fargovia Center floor for this game and 15 of the next 18 with this rallying cry: Why not us?\n\n‘We’re not trying to wait. The future is now,’ Brand said. ‘We’re trying to get these wins. We’re as good as any team in this division. A lot of teams are losing, so we have to keep winning. We have this nice home stand in front of our fans, so it should be exciting.’\n\nBrand has played 12 seasons in the NBA. Only once has he been part of a team that won so much as a playoff series. Next season is the final one of his contract, and he knows enough about the business of sports to understand that the Sixers at least have to consider the competitive opportunity using the amnesty option the new labor deal gives them to remove Brand’s $19 million weight off the salary cap in 2012-13.\n\nSo, this might be Brand’s swan song in Philly … unless he and the Sixers show that they are something more than a first-round tuneup for the Heat or Bulls in the Eastern Conference.\n\nWinning the division is the key to that goal. And just as Brand cajoled his teammates to shake the early-game malaise Wednesday, so has he spread the message that Doug Collins’ message of ‘building’ a team that can succeed doesn’t mean enough floors can be finished to rise to the top of the Atlantic Division.\n\nHowever, for that to happen this stretch of 15 home games in the next 18 must be an opportunity seized. The Sixers were 26-15 at home last season despite having miserable attendance numbers. Going 12-6 in this stretch is reasonable. Being 15-8 would make the Sixers division leaders and the team being chased for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\n‘We could break away,’ Holiday said, ‘It’s kind of set up for us to break away from the pack and really take over this division. We’ll see where this takes us.’\n\n‘It’s definitely great to get off to a good start,’ Turner said, ‘We’ll take it one step at a time. That’s what it’s all about. Within a week or two anything can change. We’re just taking it one step at a time, working hard and trying not to overlook anybody.’\n\nAs the Sixers try to come of age ahead of schedule, Brand will be there, raising a voice it took three years to hone as that of the team leader.\n\nIt was a long time coming, too long to be quiet and be patient.\n\nTo contact Dennis Deitch, email dendeitch@gmail.com"
