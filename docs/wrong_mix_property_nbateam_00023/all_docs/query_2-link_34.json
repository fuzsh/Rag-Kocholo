        "text": "Early life\n\nEmbiid is one of three children born to Christine and Thomas Embiid. The family lived in Cameroon, where Thomas Embiid was a colonel in the country’s military. While growing up, Joel Embiid played several sports, and at one point he wanted to pursue a volleyball career. However, when he was 15, he began playing basketball. In 2010 Thomas Embiid met with Joe Touomou—the first Cameroonian to play Division I basketball in the United States, who has worked to nurture Cameroonian basketball players—to discuss young Embiid’s future. “I want him to focus on school,” he told Touomou, according to a 2014 profile of Joel Embiid on the blog Grantland. Touomou responded: “If you let him play basketball, he might not need to go to school. Someday he might be able to buy his own school.” Thomas Embiid ultimately agreed to let his son play.\n\nJoel Embiid got off to a rocky start, but his play improved after he began watching videos of NBA stars, including fellow African Hakeem Olajuwon (from Nigeria) and such other dominant 1990s centers as David Robinson and Patrick Ewing. After competing in the Basketball Without Borders camp, 16-year-old Embiid went to the United States, where he played at two Florida high schools: Montverde Academy and then the Rock School.\n\nBy the time he finished high school, Embiid was considered the top incoming center for college basketball. He played a single season (2013–14) at the University of Kansas, averaging 11.2 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks per game. Embiid was named Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year in just his fourth season of organized basketball. But a stress fracture in his spine caused him to miss the last games of the season and the NCAA tournament. Embiid subsequently announced that he was entering the 2014 NBA draft.\n\nNBA\n\nA week prior to the draft, the 7-foot (2.13-meter) Embiid, who was widely predicted to be the number one pick, had surgery to fix a stress fracture in his right foot. The 76ers ultimately selected Embiid with the third overall pick—even though he was expected to miss up to a full season because of the injury. However, a year later he suffered another foot fracture and ended up missing two seasons. During this time Embiid was also dealing with the death of his 13-year-old brother, who was fatally struck by a truck in 2014.\n\nLanding the elite Embiid was part of what the 76ers called “the Process”—which many critics viewed as intentionally fielding poor teams to get top draft choices. As David Aldridge wrote for NBA.com, “Much of the rest of the league wailed at what it believed was obvious tanking to get as high a pick as possible the following June. That the Sixers responded with kind of an organizational shrug enraged people more.” Embiid subsequently adopted “the Process” as his nickname.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

During his rookie season, the team limited Embiid’s minutes given his injury history, but he still averaged 20.2 points in just over 25 minutes per game. In 2017–18 he helped Philadelphia post its first winning record (52–30) in five seasons. The 76ers qualified for the playoffs but lost in the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Boston Celtics.\n\nEmbiid had a breakout season in 2018–19, averaging 27.5 points and 13.6 rebounds a game. In the playoffs, he helped Philadelphia defeat the Brooklyn Nets in the first round. However, illness and a knee injury hampered his play in the next round, and the 76ers were eliminated by the Toronto Raptors.\n\nBefore the 2020–21 season, Philadelphia hired Doc Rivers as its new coach. He impressed upon Embiid the need to set an example for his teammates by arriving in preseason training camp in excellent shape. “I asked him, ‘Have you ever seen an out-of-shape MVP?’ ” Rivers told ESPN. That season Embiid averaged 28.5 points per game, the highest in his career to that point. Embiid continued the upward trajectory the next season (2021–22) as he became the first international player to win the NBA scoring title, when he averaged 30.6 points per game. In the offseason, he became a U.S. citizen and a French citizen.\n\nIn 2022–23 Embiid won his first MVP trophy while again leading the league in scoring, this time at 33.1 points per game. He also averaged 10.2 rebounds, 4.2 assists, and 1.7 blocks. For such a large player, Embiid has the unique ability to dribble like a guard. “I believe I can do anything on the basketball floor,” he told The New York Times in 2023. “You ask me to be a scorer, I’ll be a scorer. You ask me to be a playmaker, I’ll be a playmaker.” The 76ers advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals for the third consecutive season. However, Embiid struggled in a game-seven loss to the Boston Celtics, scoring just 15 points and making four turnovers. In the 2023–24 season Embiid made history when he scored 70 points in one game, setting a franchise record and becoming just the ninth NBA player to achieve the feat; his record-setting performance came in a game against the San Antonio Spurs on January 22, 2024."
