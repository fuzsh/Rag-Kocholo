        "text": "The Dilemma. The vast majority of employees’ days are now spent working collaboratively, but still 96 percent of executives cite poor teamwork as the main source of workplace failures in their organizations.

He helps leaders:\n\nManage to the One—Identify the drivers of each team member for maximum engagement\n\nSpeed Productivity—Help new people and teams work faster & smarter\n\nChallenge Everything—Inspire greater innovation through healthy debate\n\nFocus on Customers—Build bridges across functions, cultures, and distance\n\nThe Audience. Designed for senior leaders and managers (although often tailored to include all employees), Chester Elton has presented The Best Team Wins to corporate audiences and association conferences worldwide.\n\nTHE DILEMMA: While most leaders understand their most reliable competitive advantage comes from their people, few know how to get their teams “all in”—convincing employees to buy into the strategy they’ve put forward.\n\nTHE RESEARCH: New York Times bestselling author Chester Elton presents the findings of an unprecedented 300,000-person study on high-performance cultures. Based on this breakthrough research and his extensive consulting experience with a who’s-who of successful organizations, he presents a simple roadmap to create a high-achieving culture where employees are engaged, enabled and energized.\n\nTHE RESULT: Chester offers managers at all levels specific how-tos for each step, and tells fascinating stories of leaders in action that vividly depict just how these powerful methods can be implemented.

If a culture is clear, positive, and strong, then people will believe what they do matters and that they can make a difference. If a culture is dysfunctional—chaotic, combative or indifferent—employees will spend more time thinking about why the people sitting next to them should be fired than getting fired up themselves.\n\nThe Research: Teaming up with research giant Towers Watson, #1 bestselling author Chester Elton presents the findings of an unprecedented 300,000-person study conducted in the worst of the recession for his book All In.

The session is typically customized to an organization’s specific culture challenges.\n\nThe Dilemma: Most managers want to create cultures where their teams achieve above-and-beyond results, but for a culture to really take off teammates must encourage each other on a daily basis. The answer is in rooting for each other: having each other’s backs, appreciating strengths, and recognizing strategic behaviors.\n\nThe Research: Based his #1 bestselling book The Carrot Principle, which unveiled a 10-year, 200,000- person survey, Elton has become the preeminent authority on employee recognition.
