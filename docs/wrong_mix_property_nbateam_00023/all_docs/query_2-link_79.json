The very hours of the National Basketball Association’s free agency period has the 76ers with a new star.\n\nThe details of the contract were shared on X (Twitter) by Adrian Wojnarowski. “George committed in a meeting with Sixers officials and returns East to join Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey in pursuit of an NBA title” according to the tweet.\n\nPaul George Coming To Philly\n\nThis is a free agent signing, not a trade, which is something to keep in mind here. The Philadelphia 76ers didn’t have to give up a bunch of young draft picks or anything to get George dressed in red, white and blue. They signed him to a four-year, $212 million contract.\n\nMeet The 76ers New First Round Draft Pick!\n\nHe will join Joel Embiid, Kyle Lowry, Tyrese Maxey, Tobias Harris and many others at what is being seen as a real push to win an NBA Finals with this team they have before they blow it all up and start a rebuild. Paul George will add a veteran presence and winning mentality to this team!\n\nJeff Kurkjian is the morning show co-host on \"The Andie Summers Show\" on 92.5 XTU, Philly's Country Station.
