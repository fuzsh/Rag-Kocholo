        "text": "It was another successful night last night down at the Wells Fargo Center for the Philadelphia 76ers and all involved in bringing game two of the opening playoff series to life.\n\nThe Sixers battled to another victory over the Brooklyn Nets by a score of 96-84.\n\nIt was a low-scoring game that got ugly at times, but the only thing that matters this time of year is getting the win, and that is just what the squad did!\n\nThe team was led in scoring by the youngster, Tyrese Maxey, who checked in with 33 points while making six three-point attempts!\n\nIt was much needed on a night when James Harden was not his usual self.\n\nThe team will now head to Brooklyn with a 2-0 series lead after another win on the home court.\n\nThe 76ers themselves were not the only ones who left the arena as winners, though!\n\nAll fans in attendance received a free rally towel on their seats that has the team’s playoff slogan printed on it, “For The Love of Philly.”\n\nI’m sure all the fans were happy to leave with that!\n\nBut I’m not sure they were as happy as I was last night with all the cool stuff and people I got to see!\n\nStarting off my night with another delicious pregame meal prepared by the team and then running into event staff extraordinaire, John R is always a good thing!\n\nThen, I saw fellow Philadelphia market media member, Breland Moore, from Fox 29 and snagged a pic!\n\nAnd being that it was a nationally televised game, we weren’t the only media members in the building either — both local and national!\n\nJohn Clark from NBC10 Philadelphia was on the court pregame filming a package and doing some live coverage.\n\nThen, of course, being that it is a playoff game, the TNT broadcast team was in the building, including Spero Dedes and Grant Hill!\n\nHill was actually hanging with World B. Free for a little pregame.\n\nBut the people I was most excited to run into down there were my good friends, Matt and Marisa!\n\nMarisa, of course, is from The Preston and Steve Show over on our sister station, WMMR.\n\nThe both of them actually just got married over the weekend in Las Vegas then flew back on Monday, and came straight to the game!\n\nSo congrats to both of them!\n\nI guess they were good luck since the team won!\n\nThe big names in the building didn’t stop there!\n\nOf course, I can’t forget the biggest stars, which are the players!\n\nI got to see former Sixers guard Seth Curry make his entrance to the building, and former Villanova star, Mikal Bridges!\n\nI also saw some warmups from Furkan Korkmaz and Georges Niang, who also was nice enough to sign some autographs for fans.\n\nThen, it was time for the celebrity bell ringer to hype the crowd up, and the team did not disappoint again with their choice!\n\nIt was former Phillies great, Larry Bowa!\n\nOverall, it was a great night!\n\nThe Sixers left with a win For The Love of Philly, and there was definitely a ton of love in the air for this team and city!\n\nWell, besides a quick little Steven Singer ad that popped up on my screen in my “office” down at my courtside seats!\n\nHow fitting!\n\n#IHATESTEVENSINGER.COM\n\nI can’t wait until the team returns for their next playoff game!\n\nThe building has been electric!\n\nThough, hopefully, the next time they return it’ll be in the conference quarter finals!\n\nGo Sixers!\n\nGet your brooms ready for a sweep!"
