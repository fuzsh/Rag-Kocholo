The situation is probably more defined, more articulated. It’s not anything. It’s not a promotion. It’s not a demise. It’s how it’s played out.”\n\nIn introducing Brand as general manager Thursday, Harris stressed that both Brand and Brown will report directly to him. He characterized the G.M. and the head coach as “partners.”\n\nBrown’s job security was necessarily detached from his win-loss record, given a years-long “process” that required losing. That was an arrangement understood by both ownership and the previous general managers, Sam Hinkie and Bryan Colangelo.\n\n“Let’s face it, my situation over the years that I’ve been here is kind of unique,” Brown said. “Elton and I have got to do this together. What has been articulated to me is that Elton is the general manager. He’s going to go do his thing. I’m going to coach basketball. And I like how it’s played out.”\n\nWhen Colangelo and the Sixers parted ways at the end of last season in a swirl of reports about rogue social-media activity, Brown was appointed interim GM. Recently, he stressed he was disinterested in the position on a full-time basis.\n\nFor that, he was delighted that Brand, one of his former players, would be promoted from G-League executive to G.M.\n\n“I’m just so excited,” Brown said. “I’m convinced we have firepower. We have good pieces in place to move us forward.”\n\n* * *\n\nTypically in favor of long practices, Brown worked his players hard Saturday, with his first training-camp practice lasting longer than two hours.\n\n“It was spirited to start with,” Brown said of the closed-to-the-press workout. “I feel we have a carry-over in the structure, in the language. And that was evident. To be able to come back in and have a majority of our team together, it was comfortable coaching.”\n\n* * *\n\nEmeka Okafor, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2004 draft, is back for his second consecutive Sixers training camp.\n\nThe 6-10 center was demoted to Delaware of the G-League after the last preseason, and later hooked on with the Pelicans. New Orleans cut him Wednesday. He’ll provide the Sixers with a big, training-camp body in return for a look and a continued pro-basketball opportunity.\n\n“I can see they are trying to build on last year’s success,” Okafor said. “Everyone has the mindset to improve.”\n\n* * *\n\nNOTES >> Shaquille O’Neal was a featured guest at the Sixers’ annual training-camp-eve team dinner. Charles Barkley did the honor last season. … There were no changes to the injury report, with Zhaire Smith (foot) and Shake Milton (back) unavailable. Landry Shamet (ankle) practiced fully.\n\nOriginally Published: September 22, 2018 at 3:15 p.m."
