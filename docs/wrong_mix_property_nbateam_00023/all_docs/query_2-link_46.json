        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers appeared set on offering star Paul George a maximum contract this offseason to lure him away from the Los Angeles Clippers, but for some reason the organization's interest is fading.\n\nThe Athletic's Shams Charania broke the news on Thursday afternoon, just shortly after a bombshell that the Los Angeles Lakers are hiring NBA analyst JJ Redick as their next coach.\n\n\"The Philadelphia 76ers' interest in pursuing Paul George has significantly waned in recent days,\" Charania wrote. \"And the franchise is expected to be aggressive elsewhere with its salary cap flexibility and draft capital leading into next weekâ€™s NBA Draft, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium.\"\n\nFans immediately began clowning Sixers' general manager Daryl Morey, who had a falling out with George's teammate James Harden, in the comments. It's a real possibility that George and Harden's relationship played a factor in this news, as the former Philadelphia guard may have warned him against signing with the team."
