        "text": "Jackson Frank, the former 76ers beat writer who lost his job after sending a tweet critical of the team’s statement in support of Israel after this past weekend’s attacks on civilians by Hamas, will be taking his NBA writing direct-to-consumer.\n\nOn Tuesday, Frank returned to X, formerly known as Twitter, where he had briefly deleted his account.\n\n“Unbelievably grateful for all the support over the past day. Thank you, everyone,” Frank tweeted.\n\nHe announced that he would be writing NBA content on Patreon, a subscription content service, this season, and he also provided Venmo and CashApp usernames to anyone who might wish to directly support him.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, at least 11 people had sent Frank money on Venmo, according to transactions listed on his public profile on the payment app.\n\nThe dollar amounts were not listed, but captions from senders of the money included a salute emoji, two closed fists, a thumbs up, the words “Brave” and “integrity” and two people who wrote “F–k Philly Voice.”\n\nFrank currently has 59 subscribers on Patreon, with tiers at $3, $10 and $20 per month.\n\nOn Sunday, the Sixers tweeted, “We stand with the people of Israel and join them in mourning the hundreds of innocent lives lost to terrorism at the hands of Hamas.”\n\nFrank, who was just hired at the website PhillyVoice last month to cover the team, quote-tweeted a response, writing, “This post sucks! Solidarity with Palestine always.”\n\nOn Monday, PhillyVoice parted ways with Frank.\n\n“Mr. Frank is no longer employed by PhillyVoice.com as of today,” PhillyVoice.com CEO Hal Donnelly confirmed to The Post in a statement.\n\n“We stand with everyone who is absolutely outraged by the senseless attacks in Israel, by the loss of innocent lives and violence against civilians.”\n\nFrank declined to comment to The Post on Monday."
