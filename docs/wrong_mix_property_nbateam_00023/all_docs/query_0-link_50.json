        "text": "Elton Brand is in no rush to get on the floor.\n\nThe 76ers signed him on Jan. 4 for the sole purpose of providing leadership in the locker room. And that's what he's content with doing.\n\n\"With me, I'm not trying to take anything away from the development of these young guys, getting these young guys looks,\" said Brand, a 17th-year veteran in his second stint with the Sixers. \"I don't mind. Whenever you need me, I'm ready.\"\n\nHowever, the Sixers (7-41) have not needed him once this season. They've had 12 games since the 6-foot-8 power forward has been acquired. He's only been active in one of them. And that was because Jahlil Okafor and JaKarr Sampson were both sidelined with flu-like symptoms.\n\n\"My first reaction is no, he doesn't need to get into a game to provide our team tremendous value,\" coach Brett Brown said. \"He never needs to step onto an NBA court. He probably will and he's been working and has been fantastic with his condition.\n\n\"It's just that the leadership he provides all over the place has nothing to do with 48 minutes. He's wonderful to have around all over the place.\"\n\nThe 36-year-old has been a mentor to rookie center Jahlil Okafor. He's also quick to go over observations with his teammate during timeouts of games.\n\n\"I Just try to bring the coaching to the court,\" Brand said.\n\nThey're quick to listen due to his on-the-court resume.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls made Brand the first overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft. He played for five different teams with his last stop being with the Atlanta Hawks the past two seasons. Brand has averaged 16.1 points and 8.6 rebounds during his career.\n\n\"Practice-wise, I'm pretty good,\" said Brand, who came out of retirement to join the team. \"I did pretty well yesterday. I was proud of myself yesterday for sue. Today it was a different story. It's up and down. I had a great practice yesterday, played great D.\n\n\"I had a good effort today. I feel a little sore, a little different.\""
