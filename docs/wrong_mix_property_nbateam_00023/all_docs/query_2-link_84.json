        "text": "Sixers Ownership Deserves A Standing Ovation\n\nIt has been a controversial year for the 76ers ownership group ever since they announced their plans to build a new arena in Philadelphia. No matter what side of the debate you are on, you can always find someone who feels the opposite. When it comes to the actual basketball team, we know it is never a dull moment being a Sixers fan.\n\n76ers Were In Need Of Some Good PR\n\nLeading up to the season we had Joel Embiid talk about winning championships either in Philly or anywhere else. The James Harden saga included him publicly calling Daryl Morey a liar. Then we get to the actual season, which included Harden on the roster, with more unknowns of who will be on the team come playoff time.\n\nThe 76ers were in need for some good PR and they absolutely hit it out of the park yesterday when it was announced that Josh Harris, David Blitzer, David Adelman, and Michael Rubin teamed up to buy 2,000 tickets for tonight’s Game 6. Those tickets will be distributed to first responders, health care professionals, community groups, and other Philadelphia-based organizations.\n\nThe Knicks Fans Takeover\n\nWe all know why they are doing this. Games 3 and 4 were sad when Knicks fans had most seats in the lower bowl of the Wells Fargo Center. Although it wasn’t talked about much after the game 3 win, it was a major topic after the game 4 loss when Joel Embiid addressed the media and expressed how disappointed he was with the turnout.\n\nThat was not your fault Sixers fans. It was the fault of ticket investors. I refuse to call you a fan if you are buying tickets just to try and make a profit come playoff time. You do you, but you can’t be a “big fan” and not go to the games that matter most. I give the Knicks fans who make the trip credit, but we shouldn’t even have gotten to this point.\n\n76ers Show They Have Embiid’s Back\n\nThe ownership group and Michael Rubin are not only giving 2,000 Sixers fans an incredible opportunity tonight, they are also showing that they have the back of Joel Embiid and the rest of the team. Just because Embiid was the only one who seemed really frustrated in his press conference about the crowd, I am sure the rest of his teammates felt a similar way. This was a great PR move, but also one that could actually make an impact in the building.\n\nWe always talk about how great Philadelphia sports crowds can be, so why shouldn’t this be celebrated? I know people think this is a “bad look”, but if you are actually complaining, go outside. This is a no-lose situation for the Sixers management, and they needed that.\n\nWatch Kincade & Salciunas on the 97.5 The Fanatic YouTube page for discussion about the latest breaking sports news in Philadelphia.\n\nAndrew Salciunas, “The Choonis,” has done it all at the station - screening calls, working events as a member of the street team, producing 7 days a week, doing updates, and now hosting his own show. Now with a wife and kid, his life experiences are far different than when he first started, but this “regular guy” knows how to relate to anyone. He writes about the Flyers, Phillies, Sixers, and Eagles."
