        "text": "Jameer Nelson’s homecoming was one for his hometown fans to remember.\n\nNelson rekindled fond memories for the locals of his first-team All-American days at nearby Saint Joseph’s, with 22 points and 10 assists, and the Orlando Magic beat the Philadelphia 76ers 126-105 on Monday night.\n\n“He’s the Philly guy,” center Dwight Howard said. “Comes back home and does it all.”\n\nAll five starters scored at least 14 points for the Magic. They reached the 100-point mark late in the third quarter and kept the pressure on in the fourth to match their highest point total of the season.\n\nVince Carter and Rashard Lewis each scored 19 points, and Howard had 14. Orlando hit five 3-pointers in the third and shot 69 percent to turn a seven-point lead at halftime into a total rout.\n\nNelson, who needed 650 tickets for the game, made eight of 11 shots with only one turnover.\n\n“Dwight always tells me that if I’m aggressive, it helps him,” Nelson said. “And it helps to open things up for the other guys.”\n\nHoward seemed to have more fun on the bench than in the game. Instead of resting in the fourth, he had the reserves up and jumping around and celebrating baskets. With his uniform top off, he was the first Magic reserve off the bench going into timeouts to greet the second and third-teamers who extended the lead.\n\nThe 76ers are just waiting for this season to end. They were competitive for most of the first half until completely falling apart after the break.\n\nLewis and Carter hit 3s to stretch Orlando’s lead to 12 points and the Magic kept rolling from there. Nelson dished his 10th assist to Lewis for another 3-pointer and the Magic were cruising, 94-79.\n\nNelson swished a pull-up 3-pointer with 1:02 left to give the Magic 102 points through three quarters. Fans started fleeing for the exits and the few that remained chanted “Fire Eddie!” They had their pick of Eds: 76ers coach Eddie Jordan or team president Ed Stefanski. Both are responsible for this debacle of a season.\n\nIn turn, Jordan picked his target, taking a not-so-vieled swipe at Andre Iguodala for not stepping up as a team leader as the season disintegrates.\n\n“We lost the passion to compete,” Jordan said. “We saw some poor body language and there were a couple of timeouts where we addressed it. I wasn’t going to have it. I addressed it a couple of times, I addressed just now (postgame).\n\n“It’s leadership, or lack thereof. It’s contagious where one guy’s miserable and it’s contagious throughout the team. Someone has to stand up and try and rally the troops, your teammates.”\n\nJordan added there is no “internal leadership.”\n\nThere’s also no regular rotation, set offense or 3-point shooting.\n\nIguodala refused to fire back at his beleaguered coach.\n\n“You start to play the blame game and it really leads to a dead end, it really doesn’t go anywhere,” he said. “I’ll just go out there and keep doing what I’ve been doing my whole career, which is playing basketball the right way.”\n\nJrue Holiday scored a career-high 23 points for the Sixers. Iguodala scored 19 and Thaddeus Young, starting for Elton Brand, had 17. The Sixers played without Brand (right Achilles’ tendinitis) and Allen Iverson (personal).\n\nNo one counted on the Sixers making a run at an NBA title this year. But after making the playoffs two straight years, more was expected than waiting around for the draft lottery.\n\n“It’s kind of a few things,” Iguodala said. “Losing Andre Miller was definitely one of those things. Bringing in a new system could be one of those things. Changing the style up could be another. I don’t think we need to have excuses every night why we’re losing.”\n\nHoward, who leads the NBA in rebounding, didn’t grab his first one until the second quarter. His opportunities were sparse for most of the first half.\n\nThe first half resembled an NBA All-Star game: run, shoot, defender makes halfhearted attempt to defend. Each team cracked 70 percent shooting in the first quarter. (The Magic were 15 of 21; 76ers 14 of 20).\n\nNelson was sensational in leading Orlando to a 68-61 lead at the break. He scored 17 points, had six assists and flawlessly ran the offense. Coach Stan Van Gundy praised Nelson before the game for his improvement in all areas, notably a more aggressive, attacking style at the basket.\n\nShooting cooled off for both teams in the second quarter — except for Nelson. He made all three baskets, including a 3-pointer.\n\n“He just looks like he is back to where he was early on last season,” coach Stan Van Gundy said. “I think everything is coming together.”\n\nCLEVELAND -- LeBron James had 22 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, and Cleveland used a 74-point first half to hammer New York in their first game since learning Shaquille O'Neal will miss the rest of the regular season.\n\nThe Cavaliers didn't miss the 15-time All-Star, who had surgery on his injured right thumb Monday morning and is expected to miss two months. The team is hopeful he will return for at least part of the playoffs.\n\nThe 31-point margin of victory is the largest this season for Cleveland, which equaled a season high with its 74-point first half -- set three weeks ago against the Knicks. The Cavaliers outrebounded New York 60-31 and led by as much as 49. They have won eight straight in the series.\n\nJ.J. Hickson started at center in place of O'Neal in a game that looked more like a pickup contest in the park.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nHAWKS 116, BULLS 92\n\nCHICAGO -- Marvin Williams scored 18 points, Josh Smith added 17 points and a season-high 18 rebounds, and Atlanta beat Chicago for its fourth win in five games.\n\nDerrick Rose led the Bulls with 24 points despite missing most of the first quarter after hurting his right knee.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nMAVS 89, BOBCATS 84\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Dirk Nowitzki scored 27 points, Jason Terry had several key buckets down the stretch, and surging Dallas beat Charlotte to spoil the Bobcats' first game since Michael Jordan agreed to buy the team.\n\nJordan's presence courtside and a difficult travel schedule couldn't stop the NBA's hottest team from their eighth straight win. Caron Butler added 22 points and Terry scored 13 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter for Dallas, which rallied from a 12-point third-quarter deficit.\n\nStephen Jackson scored 20 points, but also had six of Charlotte's 20 turnovers. Tyrus Thomas added 16 points and 12 rebounds for the Bobcats, who dropped to 0-12 all-time against the Mavericks, the only team they've never beaten.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nSPURS 106\n\nHORNETS 92\n\nNEW ORLEANS -- George Hill scored 23 points and San Antonio won its second straight, beating New Orleans.\n\nTim Duncan added 22 points and nine rebounds, and Tony Parker had 18 points for the Spurs.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nAround the NBA\n\nThe Spurs waived swingman Michael Finley after nearly five seasons Monday, giving the 15-year veteran a chance to finish the season with more playing time elsewhere. The Spurs said they honored Finley's request to be released from his contract, which was in its final year after he exercised a $2.5M option this season. Finley, who turns 37 this week, will be eligible to sign with a playoff contender. Finley lost his starting job this season and missed several weeks with a sprained ankle. He appeared in only 25 games, averaging 3.7 points and 1.5 rebounds. ... The Pacers have suspended forward Solomon Jones for one game because of conduct detrimental to the team. He has played in 40 games, starting two, and is averaging 4.1 points and 2.8 rebounds. ... Bucks guard Michael Redd is scheduled to have season-ending surgery today. He tore the anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in his left knee on Jan. 10. ... After missing three games with a sprained right thumb, Celtics captain Paul Pierce says he expects to play tonight against the Pistons. ... Raptors All-Star Chris Bosh (24.5 avg.) missed his sixth consecutive game on Monday because of a sprained left ankle."
