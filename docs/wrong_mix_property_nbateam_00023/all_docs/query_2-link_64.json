He was 69.\n\nBryant was a first-round draft pick in 1975 by the Golden State Warriors. The Sixers acquired his rights months later, and Bryant spent four seasons playing for his hometown team.\n\n\"Joe 'Jellybean' Bryant was a local basketball icon, whose legacy on the court transcended his journey across Bartram High School, La Salle University, and his first four NBA seasons with the 76ers from 1975-79,\" the Sixers wrote on social media. \"Our condolences go out to the Bryant family.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-9 forward played college basketball at La Salle University, averaging 20.3 points across two seasons from 1973-75. He later was an assistant basketball coach at La Salle from 1993 to 1996."
