Making the playoff is without a problem ( unless some one impt got injured ) ...but are they good enough to go to the EASTERN FINALS( dont dream of getting to the FINALS yet :upside: ) ?\n\nIt would'nt surprise me if they get more Free Agents to beef up their lineup.......maybe an outside shooter ?\n\nWhat ya think guys and gals? :goatee:\n\nmay impact pa ba si brand?\n\nBarring injuries, Elton Brand is a force down low.. Although undersized in the low block, Brand can score, rebound and defend.. Impact? At the very least, Philly now has a go to guy in the middle.. Iggy, Thadd Young and Miller now has someone to lean to if they can't create.. With Miller's passing abilities, Brand can really flourish in Philly..\n\nRodney Carney, I heard, will be let go to create more cap space.. Any truth on this?\n\nadding brand to the line up gives more muscle inside the paint in defending and blocking the lane and can be a force to be reckon with in post up sans injuries, definitely the steal of the day...is josh smith next? hmm...let's see there was a rumor that the philly were more interested in josh smith before making drastic measures in acquiring brand, now that they have brand, it seems more that the position of no. 4 has been filled and can let go of smith, since the style and brand of play are alike of iguodala hmm....let's see since the free agency just started\n\ni think this is it for the sixers .. only money they can offer is mid level exception .. looks like jj reddick might be free for the sixers to pick up .. no more big names for the sixers this year .. and a very big chance that some team can offer big money to igoudala which the sixers might not be able to match\n\nonly way the sixers were able to afford brand is bec this year most if not all of AI's money is off the books .. deal wouldve never happened otherwise...\n\nhawks made it clear that they would match any offer for smith.. and atlanta has way more cap space than the sixers .. with the max of 82 mill the sixers can offer they felt that smith would just end up back in ATL ... while brand was an unrestricted free agent .. the deal would only be between brand and the sixers .. no need to get the clips involved\n\nwelcome bandwaggoneeers .....\n\nEdited July 10, 2008 by denimhead\n\n^\n\nwell, there has been no indication--so far, at least--from Davis' party that he's gonna walk out on the Clips.\n\nand what's more, there just won't be that kind of deal for him elsewhere.\n\nBaron Davis is an LA dude and this will be a homecoming for him more than anything.\n\nas for Philly, that's it.\n\nno more earth-shaking moves for them or at least nothing that the cap won't allow.\n\nthey just need to sign Dre Iggy and this squad is ready to roll."
