        "text": "Research Interests:\n\nMy approach to research is to actively engage students and interested faculty and practitioners in my research program. I call this “collaborative research, development and advancement”. My research program integrates teaching, scholarship and professional services with a focus on Networking and Cyber Security Science and Engineering. My main interests crosscut pervasive networking; cyber security, resilience and trust; nature-inspired computing and communications; and distributed cooperative computing.\n\nThe fabric of my research program is the continuum of interactive cyber-physical-social spaces that are intra- and inter-connected through an active computing and communications substrate (or active network) to provide smarter cyber-enabled services. The network under study must effectively and sustainably accommodate the diversity, dynamicity and varied scale of users, applications, resources, services, operating environments, and their complex interactions and behaviors. I consider next generation active networks as complex systems comprised of composable “simple” building blocks and associated distributed services and resources. Networks or network components are dynamically deployable, cognitive, autonomic, resilient and cooperative. In addition, as a complex system, the network design needs to consider not only the technological dimension, but also other dimensions such as the economic and social dimensions. Using such construction, my team of faculty, students and professionals explore computing and communications theory, and study, imagine, design and engineer network architectures and protocols that are evolvable, secure, resilient, efficient, scalable and sustainable.\n\nMy contributions to the body of knowledge, together with my students and colleagues, include: (1) Cooperative Autonomic Resilient Defense (CARD) platform; (2) Software behavior encryption for moving target defense; (3) Theory and system for SmartSENSE: Biologically-inspired Secure Elastic Networked Sensor Environment using our novel Cell-Oriented Architecture (COA) with intrinsic resilience and adaptability by construction, and employing Multi-criteria-based semantic routing for sensor-actuator networks; (3) Theory and algorithms for distributed dynamic combinatorial key management for ad hoc and sensor networks; (4) A reference architecture and system for trust and reputation management in ad hoc networks and P2P service networks; and (5) Cooperative mobile and vehicular cloud computing.\n\nSelected Publications (Total: 185+, h-index: 29, citations: 4,000+)"
