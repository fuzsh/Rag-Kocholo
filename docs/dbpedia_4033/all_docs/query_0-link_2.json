        "text": "And now for the entrance of the Olympic flag.\n\nThe five rings represent the five continents of the world.\n\nThomas Bach, head of the IOC, is still speaking:\n\n\"Today is a moment of hope. Yes, it is very different from what all of us had imagined. But let us cherish this moment because finally we are all here together: the athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team, living under one roof together in the Olympic Village. This is the unifying power of sport. This is the message of solidarity, the message of peace and the message of resilience. This gives all of us hope for our further journey together.\"\n\nFiji and the Philippines make their way out onto the field. There are just 950 in attendance at the Tokyo stadium but it feels like much more.\n\nFinland, who themselves would argue that they are a better Winter Games team, have turned up. Good to have them!\n\nA journey through time\n\nEach Opening Ceremony has a theme selected by the host country. During the \"Parade of Nations\", the host country's goal is to represent their cultural identity and to show the world their place in society.\n\nCeremonies have been around since The greek Ancient Games, from ca. 776 BC to ca. 393 AD. But it wasn’t until approximately the 77th Olympiad that they established a standard 18-event program and an Inauguration festival to celebrate the start of the Games. This festival was followed by a ceremony where athletes took an oath to sportsmanship, to end with an artistic competition of trumpeters and heralds.\n\nBig Australian presence\n\nAustralia has assembled its largest team for an Olympic Games on foreign soil, with 487 athletes to compete across 33 sports.\n\nAn extra 16 athletes were brought in last week to bolster Australia's ranks as the nation looks to turn around a disappointing tally in Rio 2016, with the final team eclipsing the 482-total at Athens 2004. The likes of Ash Barty and the Kookaburras lead the nation's charge for gold, but there's a host of other names also hoping to deliver.\n\nLocal ESPN have compiled a list of Australians you need to know and watch this Olympic Games.\n\nOLYMPIC GAMES\n\nThe Olympic Village at Tokyo 2020: Restrictions, PCRs, cardboard beds...\n\nAfter a one-year delay the 2020 Olympics will be going ahead in Tokyo, Japan but the global festival of sport will be unlike any in the competition’s illustrious history.\n\nThe games will begin on 23 July with nations from around the world coming together in Tokyo Bay, but with the host nation’s covid-19 case numbers spiralling local authorities have instituted a number of changes to ensure that athletes, officials and spectators are kept safe throughout.\n\nRead more from Will Gittins\n\nOLYMPIC GAMES\n\nOpening ceremony at Tokyo Olympics 2021: performing artists, times, TV, stream and how to watch\n\nThe curtain comes up on Tokyo 2020 with the delayed Games taking place a year after the originally scheduled date due to the global covid-19 pandemic.\n\nControversy has never been far away from the surface with the ongoing pandemic situation leading many Japanese citizens to openly oppose the staging of the Games. Growing positive covid cases involving participating athletes has done little to curry public opinion.\n\nAnother scandal emerged overshadowing the Tokyo 2020 opening ceremony after it was revealed that the director of the ceremony of Tokyo Olympics has been dismissed, organizers said on Thursday, following news reports about his past comments on the Holocaust. Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto told a briefing that Kentaro Kobayashi had been dismissed because of past comments that made fun of a tragedy.\n\nOrganizers will be avidly hoping that once the sporting activity commences, public focus turns to the athletes participating and other issues get pushed to one side.\n\nRead the full story\n\nWho are the US flag bearers?\n\nThe US team will be the third-to-last parade to enter the stadium, two spots before Japan. This positioning reminds spectators that US will be hosting 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. France, which will be host nation for the Olympic Games in 2024 will enter behind the US, a spot ahead of Japan.\n\nAmerican flag bearers will be women representative Sue Bird (women’s basketball) and Men’s representative Eddy Alvarez (baseball, though he won a silver medal in short-track speedskating at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics).\n\nBird and Alvarez will be wearing Ralph Lauren outfits which include a self-regulating cooling system designed by the brand.\n\nOpening Ceremony: Safety Restrictions\n\nA year after having been canceled because of the global pandemic, Olympic Games return, but still with strict restrictions due to increasing cases in the host country. No fans will be allowed at the Olympic events nor at the opening and closing ceremonies this year, an aspect that will drastically change the atmosphere of all the events not only for competitors but also for those who watch it from their homes.\n\nSponsors first officials which are usually seen in the Olympic’s opening will not be attending this year’s ceremony either. The companies cited the no-attendance policy at most of the Games’ venues and the need to prevent their executives from contracting the novel coronavirus. Even Japan’s three major business groups have also decided to skip the Opening Ceremony.\n\nOfficials revealed that just 950 people were expected to attend. Among whom will be officials, journalists, performers and athletes taking part of the Olympic Games.\n\nEven if athletes are not obligated to take the vaccine, IOC has tried to persuade all countries to get their athletes vaccinated in solidarity with the host country. Around 80% of attendants have already been vaccinated.\n\nOLYMPIC GAMES\n\nTokyo Olympics 2021 opening ceremony: order and flag bearers by country\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics will officially start Friday, July 23 with the traditional Opening Ceremony a year after having been canceled due to the global pandemic. While the International Olympic Committee establishes a very strict format for these sports events, the empty stadium, as well as the implementation of two representatives per nation will differentiate this year’s proceedings in Tokyo.\n\nThe Opening Ceremony, which is meant to last four hours, will be held at 7:00 a.m. ET. Friday, July 23. The event will take place at the new National Stadium in Tokyo, which opened last year and will also be hosting several sports such as soccer and the track and field competition.\n\nRead more"
