        "text": "The first time I went to Gaza was in 1967.\n\nAs a 22-year-old living in the small agricultural kibbutz of Nir Oz, a mile east of the Israeli border with the territory, I would wake up early in the morning to tend to the fields, pick apples in the orchard and work in the day care center.\n\nUntil the Arab-Israeli War that year, Gaza was a place we worried about, but we didn’t know much about Gazans themselves. The area, then under Egypt’s control, was just across the horizon and posed the threat of infiltrations by fedayeen and of a feared invasion by Arab armies. It cast a shadow over Nir Oz and the other farming collectives around us, part of a region known as the Gaza Envelope.\n\nThat summer, Israel’s victory over the armies of Egypt, Jordan and Syria brought Gaza under Israel’s control, and the shadows of war lifted from Nir Oz. Not long after, I found myself on the back of a tractor with a group of my friends from the kibbutz, driving across the invisible border to the beautiful beach in Khan Younis. On the way back we took a detour through Rafah and picked up pitas for the slow journey home.\n\nI have happy memories from that day, and in the years that followed, my interactions with Gazans grew. I met Gazan businessmen who traded with my brother-in-law in the city of Be’er Sheva and who came as guests to my home in Nir Oz. I sat alongside them in the traffic on weekend journeys to Tel Aviv. For a time, you could imagine that we were destined to live together.\n\nNevertheless, we expected that Gaza would eventually return to the Egyptians in exchange for peace and normalization but hoped that the ties with Gazans would remain. After the Camp David Accords left Israel in control of Gaza and the failure of Oslo led to the bloodshed of the second intifada, our hopes for coexistence were extinguished. By the time Israel disengaged unilaterally from Gaza in 2005 and sealed the border, we were strangers once again. I could feel the old shadows slowly returning to Nir Oz as Hamas took power.\n\nOn Oct. 7, masked Hamas gunmen burst into the bomb shelter inside my home and kidnapped me; my daughter, Keren; and my grandson, Ohad. My husband, Abraham, was knocked out trying to stop the screaming men from entering the safe room and was taken away separately from us. He is still in captivity, his condition unknown. Hamas also killed my son, Roy, as he tried to defend Nir Oz.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
