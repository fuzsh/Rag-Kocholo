In 2010, he competed for the first time at the African Championships in Nairobi, where he immediately won the bronze medal behind Botswana's Kabelo Kgosiemang and Raoul Matongno of Cameroon with a height of 2.15m. The following year, he won the African Games in Maputo with a leap of 2.25 m, before taking the bronze medal at the Arab Championships in al-Ain with a height of 2.13 m behind Qatar's Mutaz Essa Barshim and Majd Eddin Ghazal of Syria.
