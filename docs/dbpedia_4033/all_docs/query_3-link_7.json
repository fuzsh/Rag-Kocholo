        "text": "Bangladeshi \"banker to the poor\" Muhammad Yunus has written the name of his country into Olympic history, as he was awarded the Olympic Laurel at the opening ceremony of Tokyo Olympics on Friday, reports xinhuanet.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced that Yunus will become the second recipient of the laurel, which was introduced in 2016 to honor people who have \"made significant achievements in education, culture, development and peace through sport.\"\n\nA banker by trade, Yunus, has dedicated his life to fighting poverty around the world through establishing the Grameen Bank - a community development bank that makes small loans to impoverished people without requiring collateral. His work has therefore earned him the nickname of the \"world's banker to the poor.\"\n\nThe 81-year-old man accepted the award by video link from his home in Dhaka and said it represented a significant moment for Bangladesh's Olympic history.\n\nIn addition to his work with the impoverished, Yunus has also collaborated with the IOC on a Young Leaders Programme for athletes.\n\nIOC President Thomas Bach spoke highly of Yunus for his \"extensive work\" helping athletes \"become socially responsible entrepreneurs\" and for his work building a new sustainable Olympic model."
