        "text": "Joe Biden\n\nFreedom Award – 2018\n\nAs a young man in then-segregated Wilmington, Delaware, Joe Biden was inspired to begin a life of public service by the leaders of the civil rights movement. Only a few years later, Biden became one of the youngest senators elected to U.S. Congress when he was elected to represent the state of Delaware at the age of 29. As a senator for 36 years, Biden was recognized for his work in criminal justice and international affairs. In 2008, he was elected Vice President, serving alongside President Barack Obama, where he continued to work to shape policies impacting the living standards of middle-class America, gun violence and violence against women. In 2017, President Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, calling him a “lion of American history” honored for “faith in his fellow American, for [his] love of country and a lifetime of service that will endure through the generations.” Since leaving the White House, Vice President Biden has continued to stay engaged in the issues that have always animated his career, including through the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware.\n\nRev. Jesse Jackson, Sr.\n\nFreedom Award – 2018\n\nThe Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson, Sr., founder and president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, is one of the foremost civil rights, religious and political figures of our time. For nearly 50 years, he has played a pivotal role in virtually every movement for peace, civil rights, empowerment, gender equality, and economic and social justice the world over. A testament to the breadth and depth of his works can best be expressed by two of the greatest honors he has received. In 2000, President Bill Clinton awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to Reverend Jackson; and, in 2013, the South African government bestowed upon him their highest civilian honor, their National Order, the Companions of OR Tambo.\n\nReverend Jackson has been called the \"Conscience of the Nation\" and \"the Great Unifier,\" challenging America to be inclusive and to establish just and humane priorities for the benefit of all. He is known for bringing people together on common ground across lines of race, faith, gender, culture and class.\n\nJ.R. \"Pitt\" Hyde\n\nFreedom Award – 2018\n\nJ.R. “Pitt” Hyde III is trustee of the Hyde Family Foundation. His lifetime of executive and entrepreneurial experience shaped his hands-on grantmaking, focus on data-driven impact, and his philosophy emphasizing programs designed to tackle the urban challenges facing his hometown of Memphis.\n\nActing on the family tradition of giving back to his city, his business leadership shaped a nationally recognized family foundation focused on improving the lives, empowering others to drive change in their neighborhoods, and bringing business principles to civic engagement. Working with his wife, Foundation Chair and CEO, Barbara Rosser Hyde, he established the philanthropy’s priorities -- transforming education, strengthening neighborhoods, engaging civic leadership and promoting Memphis’ unique assets in arts and culture. He recognized that education reform is the civil rights issue of our time and his persuasive advocacy has been credited with Memphis being recognized as ground zero for the most innovative reform efforts in the U.S. Hyde and his wife were awarded the 2017 William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership by the Philanthropy Roundtable.\n\nCharlayne Hunter-Gault\n\nInternational Freedom Award – 2014\n\nCharlayne Hunter-Gault is an award-winning journalist with more than 40 years in the industry, working in every medium.

Her hard work as the former Chairperson of the National Board of Directors of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) helped to establish this worthy organization back to its original place of prominence.

The Dalai Lama is the spiritual and temporal leader of six million Tibetans. In 1935, he was born the fifth of 16 children to a farming family in the village of Takster in the Amdo province of Tibet.\n\nHe was recognized as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama when he was two years old. In 1940, he was formally enthroned as the Dalai Lama. Ten years later, the People's Liberation Army of Chairman Mao invaded Tibet. In 1951, the Chinese military coerced a Tibetan delegation into ratifying the Seventeen-Point agreement, which permitted the People's Republic of China (PRC) to officially take over Tibet. Although the agreement specifically allowed for a high degree of autonomy for the Tibetans, Chinese control intensified and oppression continued, leading to the failed popular Tibetan uprising of 1959.\n\nIn 1959, the Dalai Lama fled across the Himalayas to safety; since then, he has lived in exile in Dharamsala, Northern India. He set up schools and settlements for the more than 150,000 refugees who have followed him into exile to live freely. Under the Dalai Lama's leadership, the exiled Tibetans have a democratically elected government-in-exile.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, who often speaks of his tremendous respect for the people and history of China, has additionally encouraged and initiated productive dialogue between the Tibetan government-in-exile and the Chinese government. However, the Chinese government has failed to respond to His Holiness's conciliatory gestures and maintains an iron-fisted rule over Tibet. An intensified crackdown by the Chinese government continues today as a result of unprecedented waves of protests held against the Chinese government in 2008 by Tibetans living across the entire Tibetan plateau. The Dalai Lama has called for an international inquiry into China's treatment of Tibet which he said amounted to \"cultural genocide.\"\n\nA noted public speaker and the author of numerous books, the Dalai Lama is one of the most charismatic and respected peacemakers of our times. He is the first Dalai Lama to travel to the West, and he continues his teachings and lectures to promote peace, ethics and interfaith harmony. In 1989 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and in 2007 the United States Congressional Gold Medal. Most recently he was made an honorary citizen of the city of Paris, France.

In her early years she helped with the family farm work, either in the northern highlands where her family lived, or on the Pacific coast, where both adults and children went to pick coffee on the big plantations.\n\nRigoberta MenchÃº soon became involved in social reform activities through the Catholic Church, and became prominent in the women's right movement when still only a teenager. Such reform work aroused considerable opposition in influential circles; especially after a guerilla organization established itself in the area. The MenchÃº family was accused on taking part in guerilla activities and Rigoberta's father, Vincente, was imprisoned and tortured for allegedly having participated in the execution of a local plantation owner. After his release, he joined the recently founded Committee of the Peasant Union (CUC).\n\nIn 1979, Rigoberta, too, joined the CUC. That year her brother was arrested, tortured and killed by the army. The following year, he father was killed when security forces in the capital stormed the Spanish Embassy where he and some other peasants were staying. Shortly afterwards, her mother also died after having been arrested, tortured and raped. Rigoberta became increasingly active in the CUC, and taught herself Spanish as well as other Mayan languages than her native Quichesant population.\n\nIn 1981, Rigoberta MenchÃº had to go into hiding in Guatemala, and then flee to Mexico. That marked the beginning of a new phase in her life: as the organizer aboard of resistance to oppression in Guatemala and the struggle for Indian peoples' rights. In 1982, she took part in the founding of the joint opposition body, The United Representation of the Guatemalan Opposition (RUOG). In 1983, she told her life story to Elisabeth Burgos Debray. The resulting book, called in English I, Rigoberta MenchÃº, is a gripping Human document, which attracted considerable international attention. In 1986, Rigoberta MenchÃº became a member of the National Coordinating Committee of the CUC, and the following year she performed as the narrator in the powerful film When the Mountains Tremble, about the struggles and sufferings of the Maya people. On at least three occasions, Rigoberta MenchÃº has returned to Guatemala to plead the cause of the Indian peasants, but death threats have forced her to return into exile.\n\nOver the years, Rigoberta MenchÃº has become widely known as a leading advocate of Indian rights and ethno-cultural reconciliation, not only in Guatemala but in the Western Hemisphere generally, and her work has earned her several international awards including the Nobel Peace Prize bestowed to her in 1992.\n\nJulian Bond\n\nNational Freedom Award – 2002\n\nFrom his student days as a founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to his current position as Chairman of the National Association of Colored People (NAACP), Julian Bond has been a leader in the movements for civil rights, economic justice, and peace. As an activist who has faced jail for his convictions, as a veteran of more than 20 years of service in the Georgia General Assembly, as writer and lecturer, and as a university professor, he has been on the cutting edge of social change since 1960.\n\nBond was a founder of Atlanta's student sit-in and anti-segregation organization while a student at Morehouse College, as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). As SNCC's Communications Director, Bond was active in protests and registration campaigns throughout the South.\n\nElected in 1965 to the Georgia House of Representatives, Bond was prevented from taking his seat by members who objected to his opposition to the Vietnam War. He was re-elected to his own vacant seat and unseated again, and seated only after a third election and a unanimous decision of the United States Supreme Court.\n\nHe was co-chair of a challenge delegation from Georgia to the 1968 Democratic Convention. The challengers were successful in unseating Georgia's regular Democrats, and Bond was nominated for Vice President but had to decline because he was too young.\n\nIn the Georgia Senate, Bond became the first black chair of the Fulton County Delegation, the largest and most diverse in the upper house, and chair of the Consumer Affairs Committee. During his legislative tenure, he was sponsor and/or co-sponsor of more than 60 bills which became law.\n\nBond is a commentator on America's Black Forum, the oldest black-owned show in television syndication. His poetry and articles have appeared in numerous publications. He has narrated numerous documentaries, including the Academy Award-winning A Time For Justice and the prize-winning and critically acclaimed series Eyes on the Prize.\n\nAs Chairman of the NAACP Board, Bond heads the oldest and largest civil rights organization in the country. The holder of twenty honorary degrees, he is a Distinguished Professor at American University in Washington, D.C., and a Professor in history at the University of Virginia.\n\n2001 Award Winners\n\nOscar Arias\n\nInternational Freedom Award – 2001\n\nWhen Oscar Arias was elected president of Costa Rica in 1986, Central America was a region of great discord. Civil War in Guatemala had claimed one hundred thousand lives; government and rebel forces in Nicaragua and El Salvador trapped civilian populations in their cross-fire; Honduras and Costa Rica faced an increasing threat of involvement in the conflicts. Yet in the face of these threats, Arias intensified his efforts to promote peace. On the very day of his inauguration Dr. Arias began negotiating for peace by bringing together the Presidents of nine Latin American countries. This was the first of several historic meetings, which eventually resulted in what is widely known as the Arias Peace Plan. Drafted in 1987, the plan called for internal dialogue, cease-fire, freedom of speech, and free elections in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. It also called on the superpowers to stop aiding the insurgent forces and instead to promote peace. This initiative culminated in the signing of the Esquipulas II Accords, or the Procedure to Establish a Firm and Lasting Peace in Central America, by all the Central American Presidents on August 7, 1987.\n\nIn that same year he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1988, Arias used the monetary award from the Nobel Peace Prize to establish the Arias Foundation for Peace and Human Progress. Under the auspices of the Foundation, three programs were established; the Center for Human Progress to promote equal opportunities for women and gender equality; the Center for Organized Participation to strengthen the participation and action of civil society in Central America; and the Center for Peace and Reconciliation to work for demilitarization and conflict resolution the developing world.\n\nSince the conclusion of his term of office in 1990, he has continued to be a \"man of the people\" promoting such innovative ideas as human development, global governance, and human security. For him, human security is a matter of human dignity. \"It is a child who does not die, a disease that does not spread, an ethnic tension that does not explode, a dissident who is not silenced, a human spirit that is not crushed.\"\n\nAn unequivocal example of this solidarity is shown in Dr. Arias' commitment to curtail the global arms trade. On May 29, 1997, he met with seven other Nobel Peace laureates to publicly unveil the International Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers. Dr. Arias' proposal stipulates that any country wishing to purchase arms must meet certain criteria, including the promotion of democracy, the protection of human rights, and the transparency in military spending. It would also prohibit arms sales to nations that support terrorism and to states that are engaged in aggression against other nations or peoples. In addition to the Code, Dr. Arias encourages preventive diplomacy to avert regional arms races and conflict. He strongly advocated the Year 2000 Campaign to Redirect World Military Spending to Human Development, which calls upon the United Nations to send special envoys to different sites of potential international conflict.\n\nSidney Poitier\n\nNational Freedom Award – 2001\n\nSidney Poitier was an avid supporter of the Civil Rights Movement, eagerly available to raise funds for various civil rights organizations. He joined other actors who marched with Dr. King in 1963 at the March of Washington. He campaigned for the Progressive Labor Party, which fought for the Bahamas' Independence from Britain in 1967. In 1969, he was the founder of the First Arts Production Company and worked to increase employment opportunities for African Americans in the film industry.\n\n\"In 1964 I was awarded the Oscar for best actor for my performance in Lilies of the Fields, the first African American so honored. Did I say to myself, this country is waking up and beginning to recognize that certain changes is inevitable? No I did not. I knew that we hadn't overcome, because I was still the only one.\"\n\nPoitier has received lifetime achievement awards from the American Film Institute, the Kennedy Center and the Screen Actors Guild. In 1997 he was appointed Bahamian Ambassador to Japan. In 1968, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II knighted him for excellence in the arts. He is the author of two autobiographies, This Life and The Measure of A Man.\n\nFACT SHEET\n\nBorn: 1927 in Miami; raised on Cat Island in the Bahamas until age 15 Working full time supporting his family at age 13\n\nEarly years: Arrived in New York at age 16, with $3 Served in the Army for World War II\n\nEarly theater: Accepted into the American Negro Theater 1946\n\nFirst major role: No Way Out 1950, age 22\n\nFilmography (partial listing)\n\nBlackboard Jungle, 1955\n\nEdge of the City, 1957\n\nThe Defiant Ones, 1958, nominated for Academy Award?Porgy and Bess, 1959\n\nAll the Young Men, 1960\n\nA Raisin in the Sun and Paris Blues, 1961\n\nPressure Point, 1962\n\nLilies of the Field, 1963, Academy Award Leading Actor\n\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner, To Sir with Love, In the Heat of the Night, 1967\n\nA Patch of Blue, 1966\n\nFor the Love of Ivy, 1968\n\nThey Call Me Mr. Tibbs, 1970T\n\nThe Organization, 1971\n\nBuck and the Preacher, 1972\n\nBrother John, 1973\n\nUptown Saturday Night, 1974L\n\nLet's Do It Again, and A Warm December, 1975\n\nA Piece of the Action, 1977\n\nStir Crazy (Director) 1980\n\nHanky Panky (Director) 1982\n\nFast Forward (Director) 1985\n\nShoot to Kill, and Little Nikita, 1988\n\nGhost Dad, 1990?Sneakers, 1992\n\nAwards and Recognitions\n\n1992, American Film Institute Life Achievement Award\n\n1997, Ambassador of the Bahamas to Japan\n\n1998, Member of the Board of Directors of the Walt Disney Company\n\n2000, Screen Actors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award\n\nBook Author, \" This Life\", \"Measure of A Man\"\n\n2000 Award Winners\n\nPresident Nelson Mandela\n\nInternational Freedom Award – 2000\n\nNelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born in Transkei, South Africa on July 25,1918.
