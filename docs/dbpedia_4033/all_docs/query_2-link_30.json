        "text": "Muhammad Yunus had barely left his office overlooking Dhaka when dozens of men pushed past the security guards.

Shouting at staff, the men detained managers for hours of questioning and secured doors with bicycle locks. For several days in February, they occupied the building, home to social businesses chaired by Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his pioneering work in microfinance—tiny loans for the world’s poorest people.\n\nListen and follow The Big Take Asia on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts"
