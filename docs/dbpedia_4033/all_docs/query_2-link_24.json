        "text": "We are thrilled to announce the publication of our new book, Forced Migration and Sport: Critical Dialogues across International Contexts and Disciplinary Boundaries. This book offers novel insights into the role of sport in relation to forced migration, displacement, and resettlement. We highlight how sport in contexts of forced migration needs to be understood in relation to the multiplicity of meanings it holds for the various actors involved, as well as the political, socio-cultural, and economic structures and frames that shape those meanings. We explore these processes across the entire spectrum of sport – from community-based clubs, grassroots programs, and informal sport to the elite level; and from playing to coaching and spectating. The role of sport in forced migration contexts and trajectories can be highly relevant, but how we understand the relationship between these two domains can be narrow and limiting. The book shows how issues of visibility, voice, and representation must be situated within exacerbating socio-political processes of State-sanctioned bordering practices, exclusion, and violence. Without such contextualisation, sport-based interventions can reproduce or deepen exclusion and marginality, and miss opportunities for social transformation. As researchers, engaging with forced migrants’ needs, claims, perspectives, capabilities, and aspirations as they are expressed through sport and physical activity is essential and requires methodological and ethical consideration. However, if participatory research is not undertaken critically and reflexively, it risks reproducing social injustices. We need critical, intersectional orientations and deeper engagement with the role of emotions and embodiment to truly understand the layered and multifaceted experiences of sport across different forced migration contexts and trajectories. With this book, we hope to open new avenues of research, dialogue, and practice in the field. I am deeply grateful to my amazing co-creators Nicola De Martini Ugolotti and Carla Luguetti. We extend our greatest appreciation to all contributors.

They serve as a powerful metaphor for assessing the seriousness of nations. At the core, the Olympics reflect a nation's commitment to excellence. Nations that take the Games seriously invest heavily in their athletes, providing them with the best training, facilities, and support systems. There is also a massive infrastructure development at the grassroots to catalyse easy discovery and development of talents. There is also the cultural dimension, embedding the values of discipline, perseverance, and ambition in the national psyche. Serious nations recognize that success at the Olympics is not accidental; it is the result of years of planning, rigorous training, and strategic focus. No wonder it appears that nations that excel in the Olympics are often the ones that excel in other areas such as innovation, governance, enterprise, and international diplomacy etc., because they understand the importance of resilience, adaptability, and integrity in nation building. Serious nations see the Olympic Games as a barometer of national unity and pride. An opportunity to rally their citizens around a common cause, to showcase their culture and values, and to inspire future generations. This sense of unity is a hallmark of a serious nation - one that understands the power of collective effort and the importance of national identity on the world stage. If indeed the Olympic Games can be used as a Metaphor for National Seriousness, then Nigeria's poor performance at the just concluded Paris Olympics reflects the state of our nation at this time. The burden rests on all of us to reflect and make efforts to build a nation our children can be proud of. We must hold our leaders accountable and we must be responsible enough to model the right behaviors.\n\nYou person a preview presumption of this nonfiction portion we are checking your access.

However, hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games has become an extraordinary feat in and of itself — and a financially untenable one at that. The quadrennial summer and winter events come at a cost. And, especially in recent decades, the spectacle has been blemished by budget overruns, long-term debts, wasteful infrastructure, displacement and gentrification, political strife and environmental harm. The International Olympic Committee hopes to right the ship, starting with the Paris Games: The nongovernmental sports organization is aiming to take a more frugal and greener approach than in years past. “This will be the first Olympics, since Sydney, where the total costs are coming in under $10 billion,” said Victor Matheson, a College of the Holy Cross professor of economics who has researched the financial costs of the Olympics. “That’s because the IOC was running out of cities willing to host this thing,” he added. “It’s become pretty clear to cities that — under the old regime — these were real financial debacles for the cities involved, and wildly expensive with little hope to make money back in the long run.” Still, some economists and researchers argue that a truly sustainable Olympics will need to look a lot different than the Games we know today. In jockeying for the Olympics, some cities spent upward of $100 million on the bidding process alone, he said. And once they did land those bids, the costs often soared well beyond what was initially estimated and budgeted. Including Paris, five of the past six Olympics (summer and winter) had inflation-adjusted cost overruns of well more than 100%, according to an Oxford University study released in May 2024. “All Games, without exception, have cost overrun,” researchers wrote. “For no other type of megaproject is this the case, not even the construction of nuclear power plants or the storage of nuclear waste.” And that’s being conservative, the researchers noted, adding they did not include indirect capital costs such as improvements to roads, rail, airports, hotels, and other infrastructure. Beijing spent more than $40 billion for the 2008 Summer Games, Sochi spent upward of $50 billion for the 2014 Winter Games and Rio’s costs approached $20 billion for the 2016 Summer Olympics, he wrote. “One of the big issues, whether you’re looking at the question of surplus or deficit, or some other strictly financial question, is that if you really want to know how much money is spent, and how much money comes in, you simply have to include everything,” Andrew Zimbalist, Smith College sports economist, told CNN. “You can’t just include the 17 days of costs.”\n\n“Facing ghosts: Lumumba Shadows” is my most recent published chapter, where I explore the evolution of Lumumba’s memory in Belgium, from a hushed taboo to a celebrated emblem of decolonization. It’s a story of resilience, of reclaiming narratives, and of finding strength in shared histories. The appropriation of Lumumba in artworks serve as reminder of the injustices, the silenced narratives, and the unresolved traumas that continue to haunt contemporary society. The chapter doesn’t merely dwell on the ghosts of the past; it also celebrates the resilience and agency of those who refuse to let history remain buried. By reclaiming and reimagining Lumumba’s memory, these artists and activists are not only confronting uncomfortable truths but also shaping a more inclusive and just future. This chapter serves as a powerful reminder that the past is not something to be forgotten or ignored but rather something to be reckoned with. By confronting these shadows head-on, we can begin to heal the wounds of the past and build a more equitable society for generations to come. As we navigate the complexities of our world today, where conversations about identity, history, and power dynamics are more important than ever, this Handbook couldn’t be timelier. It’s not just a book; it’s a conversation starter, a catalyst for change, and a roadmap for building a more inclusive future. https://lnkd.in/en-aCUSN #research #horizon2020 #erc #belgium #decolonization\n\nSport, and football in particular, has long been intertwined with politics, acting as both a reflection and a tool of political agendas. Euro 2024, the latest edition of the UEFA European Championship, offers a fresh lens through which to examine this complex relationship. Historically, the link between football and politics is evident across continents. As Ncube (2014b) notes, the two have been connected since time immemorial. In Europe and America, extensive literature explores how media and sport interact (Rowe 1999; Stead 2002; Nicholson 2007; Boyle 2010). This symbiotic relationship is crucial for the survival and flourishing of both sectors (Mchesney 1989). In Zimbabwe, football was introduced by missionaries and colonial settlers but was appropriated and transformed to meet local cultural and political needs (Zenenga 2012). It became a significant medium for expressing dissent and rallying against colonial rule. Football stadiums were often venues for political gatherings and discussions, providing a space for planning and executing resistance (Stuart, 1995). Prominent political activists in Zimbabwe, such as Benjamin Burombo and Simpambaniso Manyoba, gained visibility through their involvement in football (Ncube 2021). Dynamos, a team established in opposition to the Ian Smith regime, served as a symbol of urban African resistance (Stuart, 1995). Post-independence, football remains integral to national celebrations, reinforcing its political significance (Zenenga, 2012; Willems, 2013). The use of football as a means of political control is not unique to Zimbabwe. Althusser's (1971) concept of ideology suggests that the ruling class uses state apparatuses to secure popular consent. In Zimbabwe, football has been used to divert attention from economic hardships and maintain control over the populace (Stapleton 2001). This aligns with Chomsky's (1988) view of sport as a vehicle for hegemony. As Euro 2024 unfolds, it serves as a reminder of football's enduring role in shaping and reflecting political dynamics. The controversies and passions that arise, such as disputes over refereeing decisions, echo the sport's deep-rooted political and social significance. From Maradona's infamous \"Hand of God\" to local legends like Zimbabwe's Murape Murape, football continues to be a contentious and powerful force in the political landscape. In conclusion, Euro 2024 is more than just a football tournament; it is a stage where politics and sport intersect, reflecting broader societal issues and continuing a historical tradition of using football as a platform for political expression and control.\n\n\"I am the Lorax, and I speak for the trees.\" - The Lorax, Dr. Seuss While I was not in attendance at the QUT (Queensland University of Technology) business leaders forum yesterday, I do want to take up Cindy Hook's provocation to \"speak up\". For the last 3 years, various impacted communities across Brisbane have already been speaking up regarding the various negative educational, social, environmental, and economic impacts of the 2032 Brisbane Olympics & Paralympics. These games were premised on the \"New Norm\", an opportunity to rethink the old Olympics legacy which has bankrupted host cities, left legacies of underutilised white elephant stadia, and never properly accounted for the many other negative environmental and social impacts of this mega-event (e.g. displacement of homeless peoples, driving inflation and housing unaffordability, etc.). Yet, to most of us on the ground, it seems that many in government and on these various boards want to continue the legacies of old, rather than treating this as a genuine opportunity to exercise a vision in how the Olympics, and sports and megaevents in general, can transform into a greener and more socially positive experience for *all*. It's 2024, we are in the midst of a cost of living crisis, inequality is on the rise, and the world is continuing to deal with the increasing consequences of climate change. We can ill-afford to keep sinking increasingly limited resources into rebuilding massive stadiums and tearing up green space while doing so, and I personally feel that it is irresponsible for modern leaders to be encouraging such. For more background, this Federal Parliamentary Library report by Rodney Bogaards makes for sobering reading: \"Based on this history, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether the benefits of the Brisbane Olympics in 2032 will outweigh the costs to the community, even with the ‘New Norm’ changes.\" https://lnkd.in/gqbyG3Nx\n\nSo, picture this: I got the chance to speak at the summer European Forum Alpbach 2023. It was a big deal, but let me tell you, it almost didn't happen. Why? Well, that's a complicated thing, I just wasn't sure whether to do it or not, but thanks to Hannah Romano and Barbara Dzino I did. ❤️ Before the forum, I had all these doubts in my head. Like, am I really supposed to be here? Can I really say what I want to say? Oh it was tough. But, I didn't give up. I decided to face it all and put my feelings into words. Turns out, that wasn't easy either. 💥 Being a black person in Europe can feel like trying to walk through a field of warning signs. 📍 Writing the speech became like telling my life story. I had to talk about the tough stuff—how it feels to be black in Europe, dealing with people's ideas about me. It was hard to put all those feelings into words, but I knew it was important. When the big day came, and I stood on that stage, it felt crazy. There were so many people from different places, and I thought, \"Okay, this is my chance.\" I wanted to share my story, to make people understand what it's like. Talking about my struggles was like saying, \"Hey, this is who I am, and this is what I've been through.\" But it wasn't just about the problems. It was also about hope. I wanted people to know that, even with all the issues, I still believed in democracy. I believe that, no matter how long it takes, things can get better. The cool part? 🎉 ✨ The people I met at the forum were amazing. We became friends, and it didn't matter where we were from or what color our skin was. We all wanted the same thing—a fair and equal world. Sure, being a black person in Europe has its tough moments, but thanks to the forum, I realized there are good people out there who get it. They want change too. So, yeah, my experience was a mix of hard stuff and good stuff. But I left feeling grateful for the chance to speak up, for the awesome people I met, and for the belief that, in the end, democracy will win. Thanks fam Club Alpbach Niederösterreich for being the source to that strength. ❤️ #fyp #linkedin #humanitarian #humanrights #motivation #democracy #peacebuilding"
