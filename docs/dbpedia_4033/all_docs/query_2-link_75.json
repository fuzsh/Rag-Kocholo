        "text": "Bangladesh Nobel winner Muhammad Yunus said on Tuesday (August 6, 2024) he is ready to head a caretaker government, a day after the military took control as mass protests forced longtime ruler Sheikh Hasina to flee.\n\nMicrofinance pioneer Mr. Yunus, 84, is credited with lifting millions out of poverty — earning the enmity of ousted Ms. Hasina and the wide respect of millions of Bangladeshis.\n\n\"If action is needed in Bangladesh, for my country and for the courage of my people, then I will take it,\" he told AFP in a statement, also calling for \"free elections\", after student leaders called for him to lead an interim government.\n\nFollow LIVE updates from the crisis in Bangladesh on August 06, 2024\n\nMs. Hasina, 76, had been in power since 2009 but was accused of rigging elections in January and then watched millions of people take to the streets over the past month demanding she quit.\n\nHundreds of people were killed as security forces sought to quell the unrest but the protests grew and Ms. Hasina finally fled aboard a helicopter on Monday (August 5, 2024) after the military turned against her.\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced on Monday (August 5, 2024) the military would form an interim government, saying it was \"time to stop the violence\".\n\nThe president dissolved parliament on Tuesday (August 6, 2024), a key demand of the student leaders and the major opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP), which has demanded elections within three months.\n\n‘In Dr. Yunus we trust’\n\n\"In Dr. Yunus, we trust,\" Asif Mahmud, a key leader of the Students Against Discrimination (SAD) group, wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe military on Tuesday (August 6, 2024) reshuffled several top generals, demoting some seen as close to Ms. Hasina, and sacking Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared and US-sanctioned Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.\n\nEx-Prime Minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, 78, was also released from years of house arrest, a presidential statement and her party said.\n\nStreets in the capital were largely peaceful on Tuesday (August 6, 2024) — with traffic resuming, shops opening and international flights resuming at Dhaka's airport — but government offices were mainly closed a day after chaotic violence in which at least 122 people were killed.\n\nMillions of Bangladeshis flooded the streets of Dhaka to celebrate after Gen. Waker's announcement on Monday (August 5, 2024) — and jubilant crowds also stormed and looted Hasina's official residence.\n\n\"We have been freed from a dictatorship\", said Sazid Ahnaf, 21, comparing the events to the independence war that split the nation from Pakistan more than five decades ago.\n\nDeadliest day\n\nPolice said mobs had launched revenge attacks on Hasina's allies and their own officers, as well as broke into a prison, releasing more than 500 inmates.\n\nMonday (August 5, 2024) was the deadliest day since protests began in early July, with a further 10 people killed on Tuesday (August 6, 2024), taking the total toll overall to at least 432, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and doctors at hospitals.\n\nProtesters broke into Parliament and torched TV stations. Others smashed statues of Ms. Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's independence hero.\n\nSome businesses and homes owned by Hindus — a group seen by some in the Muslim-majority nation as close to Ms. Hasina — were also attacked, witnesses said.\n\nBangladeshi rights groups, as well as U.S. and European Union diplomats, said Tuesday (August 6, 2024) they were \"very concerned\" about reports of attacks on religious, ethnic and other minority groups.\n\nKey police unions said their members had declared a strike \"until the security of every member of the police is secured\", offering their \"apology\" for police actions against the protesters.\n\nKey regional allies of Bangladesh, neighbouring India and China, both called for calm on Tuesday (August 6, 2024).\n\nChina hopes that \"social stability can be restored in Bangladesh\" soon, the Foreign Ministry in Beijing said on Tuesday (August 6, 2024), while Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar said he was \"deeply concerned till law and order is visibly restored\".\n\nPolitical prisoners freed\n\nThe unrest began last month with protests against civil service job quotas and escalated into wider calls for Ms. Hasina to stand down.\n\nHer government was accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.\n\nMothers of some of the hundreds of political prisoners secretly jailed under Hasina's rule waited outside a military intelligence building in Dhaka on Tuesday (August 6, 2024).\n\n\"We need answers,\" said campaigner Sanjida Islam Tulee.\n\nThe fate of Ms. Hasina, now in India, is also uncertain.\n\nA source had said she wanted to go to London but calls by the British government for a U.N.-led investigation into the \"unprecedented\" violence put that in doubt.\n\nThomas Kean from the International Crisis Group said the new authorities faced a daunting challenge.\n\n\"The interim government that will now assume power... needs to embark on the long task of rebuilding democracy in Bangladesh, which has been so badly eroded in recent years,\" he said."
