        "text": "Muhammad Yunus returns to Dhaka with promise of forming govt that assures safety for all\n\nYunus was in Paris for the Olympics when he was named interim leader following talks among military officials, civic leaders, and the student activists who led the uprising against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nBy CNBCTV18.com\n\nNobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus arrived in Dhaka on Thursday (August 8). He took oath as the head of the interim government in Bangladesh. He arrived at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, Dhaka, on the Emirates flight (EK-582) from Dubai at 2:10 pm today.\n\n\"We have to form a government which assures safety to its citizens. Bangladesh got independence for the second time and people must strive to protect this,\" Yunus said after returning to Dhaka.\n\nThe interim government in Bangladesh was sworn in today. Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said the advisory council may have 15 members.\n\nYunus was in Paris for the Olympics when he was named interim leader following talks among military officials, civic leaders, and the student activists who led the uprising against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. She abruptly resigned and secretly fled to India after violence escalated.\n\nThe unrest began in July with protests against a quota system that reserved 30% of civil services jobs for the families of veterans who fought the 1971 liberation war. Clashes were witnessed in different parts of the country between the protesters and the government resulting in the death of 440 people.\n\nOn August 7, Yunus appealed for calm and urged all parties to help the country rebuild after weeks of violence that killed hundreds and prompted Hasina to resign.\n\nThe quick move to choose Yunus came when Hasinaâ€™s resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for the country. The military took temporary control until the interim government could be sworn in. It wields significant influence in a country that has seen more than 20 coups or coup attempts since its independence from Pakistan in 1971.\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.
