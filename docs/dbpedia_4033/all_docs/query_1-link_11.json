        "text": "The Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt has cemented his place as a legend of athletics at the Rio Olympics, earning his ninth gold medal in as many attempts.\n\nHe's so fast that he could have finished 100m in the time it's taken you to read up to here.\n\nAs he bids goodbye to the Games, let's slice and dice his stats, shall we?\n\n*Bolt's individual time in his ninth race has not yet been published. We tried to time it from the TV but we don't trust our reaction time on the stopwatch.\n\nWhen you include the preliminary rounds, Bolt has spent only 325 seconds - a little under five and a half minutes - on the Olympics track, according to Associated Press.\n\nThat means he has picked up a gold medal for every 36 seconds spent on the track, including the qualifying rounds.\n\nAt his fastest, in the 4x100m relay, Bolt nudges the 25mph mark. That's 40km/h.\n\nHis relay times are quicker because they aren't from a standing start. He's already running when his team-mate passes him the baton.\n\nOK, we're being silly, but humour us here. IF you laid out track from the Earth's equator to the moon at its closest point in its orbit... AND if Bolt kept running at his fastest speed from Earth all the way through space to the moon, he would get there in 9,713 hours.\n\nIf he had declared an independent republic of himself, Usain Bolt would have been 27th in the Beijing Olympics medals table. His three golds would put him just above Cuba and below Georgia. In the London Olympics, he would have been 26th - above Belarus and below Croatia. And in the Rio Olympics so far, he would be 25th, between Iran and Ukraine.\n\n(Of course, this is only if you're still counting Jamaica as a country, and still counting his medals in their tally...)"
