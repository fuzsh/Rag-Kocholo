        "text": "If you’re just joining us, these are the most notable developments in Israel’s war on Hamas and the tensions in the Middle East:\n\nDisputed claims on death of Hezbollah fighters: Israel’s defense minister claimed that half of Hezbollah’s commanders in southern Lebanon have been killed since fighting with Israel began on October 7 – a claim Hezbollah denies. There have been months of daily, deadly cross-border strikes by both Israel and Hezbollah that have displaced tens of thousands of Lebanese and Israeli residents from their homes.\n\nHostage video: Hamas released a video of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin on Wednesday, the first proof that he survived being badly wounded during his capture on October 7. He is shown seated in a chair and addressing the camera directly in the undated video with part of his left arm missing several inches above the hand. He identified himself, gave his date of birth and parents’ names. He said he has been “here for almost 200 days,” suggesting that the video was filmed shortly before Tuesday, the 200th day of the war. He urged his own family to stay strong for him and finished by saying he hopes he was able to give them some comfort on Passover. The Biden administration received the video on Monday, two days before Hamas made the footage public on Wednesday, according to a United States official.\n\nIsraeli leader addresses protests on US college campuses: Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the protests are “not only antisemitic, but also inciting terrorism.”Pro-Palestinian protests are taking place at major American universities, most prominently at New York’s Columbia University, which has entered its eighth day of tense demonstrations.\n\nUS on Israeli settlements in West Bank: A US State Department spokesperson addressed reports of Israeli officials pushing to legalize Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and calling support for illegal outposts “dangerous and reckless.” State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said such actions “will only move the goal of peace and stability in the region further away.” The US is also pressing Israel for more information about the mass grave discovered in Khan Younis, Patel said.\n\nThe Biden administration received video of an Israeli-American hostage on Monday, two days before Hamas made the footage public on Wednesday, according to a United States official. Officials have since been in contact with Hersh Goldberg-Polin’s family, the person said.\n\nThe FBI’s Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell is examining the video for any potential evidence and information that can be gleaned about Goldberg-Polin and his captivity, the official said. While the administration cannot currently authenticate the video, it has no reason to dispute that the person featured in the video is Goldberg-Polin, they added.\n\nThe video that Hamas released Wednesday marks the first proof that he survived after being badly wounded during his capture on October 7.\n\nThis official would not elaborate on what channels the US government received video of the wounded dual-American citizen.\n\nAfter the video was released, Goldberg-Polin’s family demanded immediate action to release their son and the other hostages, according to a statement Wednesday.\n\nThis post has been updated with comments from the family.\n\nHalf of Hezbollah’s commanders in southern Lebanon have been killed since fighting with Israel began on October 7, according to Israel’s defense minister – a claim Hezbollah denies.\n\nIn remarks made on camera after a “deep operational discussion” at the Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) northern command headquarters, Yoav Gallant said there’s a “continuous offensive operation by IDF forces in all of southern Lebanon,” of which the results are “very impressive.”\n\n“Half of Hezbollah commanders in southern Lebanon were eliminated… we made it so that either they die, or they hide and abandon South Lebanon to the IDF’s operation, which is being done intensively,” Gallant said.\n\nA Hezbollah official who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity denied those claims.\n\nThe official went on to say that Hezbollah has not yet announced its “full mobilization,” adding that “our fighters continue to follow a service and leave system.”\n\nThere have been months of daily, deadly cross-border strikes by both Israel and Hezbollah that have displaced tens of thousands of Lebanese and Israeli residents from their homes. Israel has fired artillery and launched jets and drones to strike targets while Hezbollah has used some of its vast arsenal of rockets and missiles.\n\nIsraeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin criticized the Israeli government and urged his family to stay strong in the video released by Hamas on Wednesday.\n\nGoldberg-Polin’s hair is cropped short in the video, which is edited with a number of cuts from wide shot to close up. It is the first proof that he survived his injuries sustained during the militant group’s October 7 attacks.\n\nHe criticizes the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as other Israeli hostages in Hamas propaganda videos have done. Held captive in Gaza for six months, he is almost certainly speaking under duress.\n\nHe mentions Israeli government ministers sitting down to holiday dinners with their families, an apparent reference to the Jewish holiday of Passover, which began Monday night and is traditionally celebrated with a family dinner.\n\nHe urges his own family to stay strong for him and finishes by saying he hopes he was able to give them some comfort on the holiday.\n\nGoldberg-Polin was born in the United States but his family moved to Israel in 2008.\n\nHis parents, Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin, told CNN shortly after the attacks that they last heard from their son that day, when they received two WhatsApp messages in the same minute; one reading “I love you.” and the next “I’m sorry.” Goldberg immediately tried to call him, but said: “It just rang and rang.”\n\nHamas released a video of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin on Wednesday, the first proof that he survived being badly wounded during his capture on October 7.\n\nGoldberg-Polin, then 23, was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7 during Hamas’ attacks on Israel that left more than 1,200 people dead and saw more than 200 people taken hostage in Gaza.\n\nHe is shown in the undated video with part of his left arm missing several inches above the hand.\n\nVideo filmed on October 7 showed Goldberg-Polin with his arm severely injured. A firsthand account from a young woman who was in a bunker with Goldberg-Polin when Hamas attacked said he helped to throw grenades out, before having his arm blown off from the elbow down.\n\nThe latest video shows Goldberg-Polin seated in a chair, addressing the camera directly.\n\nGesturing occasionally with his injured arm, he identifies himself and gives his date of birth and parents’ names.\n\nHe says that he has been “here for almost 200 days,” suggesting that the video was filmed shortly before Tuesday, the 200th day of the war.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional developments.\n\nIsraeli politicians thanked the United States on Wednesday after the Senate passed a $95 billion package that includes money for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.\n\nThe long-stalled bill is now finally on the desk of US President Joe Biden, who said he would sign it into law on Wednesday.\n\nIsraeli opposition leader Yair Lapid and Foreign Affairs Minister Israel Katz joined President Isaac Herzog in expressing their gratitude. “With the threats we face from across the region, Israel’s strategic relationship with the US is a pillar of our national security,” Lapid said.\n\nBut on the ground in Gaza, the humanitarian catastrophe wrought by Israel’s war against Hamas is worsening.\n\nMore than 340 bodies have now been uncovered at a hospital mass grave in Khan Younis, while the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees said more than 270,000 tons of solid waste across Gaza remain uncollected. A top State Department official said that the risk of famine in Gaza is currently “very high, especially in the north.”\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nUS aid package finally passes: The package provides $26.4 billion to aid Israel, specifying that the funds are to support “its effort to defend itself against Iran and its proxies, and to reimburse US military operations in response to recent attacks,” according to a summary of the legislation. It includes $4 billion for the Iron Dome and David’s Sling missile defense systems and $1.2 billion for the Iron Beam defense system, which counters short-range rockets and mortar threats.\n\nMass graves uncovered: The UN has called for an “independent, effective and transparent investigation” as more bodies were discovered at a mass grave at a hospital in Khan Younis. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said he was “horrified” by the scenes at the Nasser Medical Complex and at Al-Shifa hospital, where bodies were found earlier this month.\n\nMore bodies found: Some 344 bodies have now been uncovered at the Nasser facility following the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the area, the Gaza General Directorate of Civil Defense told CNN.\n\nMore than 34,000 Palestinians killed: After 200 days of war, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave’s health ministry. Its counterpart in Ramallah said that 72% of those killed in Gaza were children, women and the elderly. CNN cannot independently confirm these numbers due to the lack of international media access.\n\nHamas vows fresh attacks: Abu Obaida, the spokesperson of Hamas’ military wing Al Qassam Brigades, vowed continued attacks on Israel in his first video message in more than six weeks on Tuesday. “We will keep attacking the enemy with different techniques as long as the aggression continues on our land,” Abu Obaida said. Hamas fighters would “keep coming out to fight the enemy,” he said.\n\nIDF warning: The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has issued a warning to people in parts of the area of Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, calling on residents to evacuate. Identifying several blocks from its map of Gaza, the IDF warns: “You are in a dangerous combat zone. The IDF will work with extreme force against terrorist infrastructure and subversive elements in the region.”\n\nGermany resumes UNRWA co-operation: Germany will again work with the UN’s relief agency for Palestinians in Gaza (UNRWA) after the organization accepted the recommendations of an independent review of its neutrality. The review was launched after Israel alleged that a dozen of UNRWA’s 13,000 Gaza staffers were involved in Hamas’ October 7 attack.\n\nHumanitarian crisis: More than 270,000 tons of solid waste across Gaza remain uncollected, according to UNRWA, as Israel’s military campaign has disrupted essential services. The agency also reported that more than 75% of the population has been displaced, that relief operations there have been “severely restricted” by Israel, and that the health system in the enclave has been crushed.\n\nFears of Gaza famine: A top State Department official said that the risk of famine in Gaza is currently “very high, especially in the north.” Special Envoy for Middle East Humanitarian Issues David Satterfield said “Israel must do everything possible to facilitate efforts to avert famine in Gaza.”\n\nHebron shooting: A Palestinian woman was shot dead by Israeli troops at a checkpoint in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, after she allegedly tried to stab an Israeli soldier. Palestinian officials confirmed her identity as Maimunah Abdel Al-Hamid Harahsha, 20.\n\nThe UN has called for an “independent, effective and transparent investigation” into the discovery of mass graves at two Gaza hospital complexes after they were besieged and raided by Israeli troops earlier this year.\n\nUN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said he was “horrified” by the scenes reported at the Nasser and Al-Shifa complexes.\n\n“Given the prevailing climate of impunity, this should include international investigators,” Turk said Tuesday.\n\nA mass grave with 324 bodies was uncovered this week at the Nasser Medical Complex in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis by Gaza Civil Defense workers following the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the area.\n\nEarlier in April, health workers exhumed corpses from mass graves at Al-Shifa after they said Israeli forces killed hundreds of Palestinians and left their bodies to decompose during their two-week siege of the complex in northern Gaza.\n\nAt least 381 bodies were recovered from Al-Shifa after Israeli forces withdrew on April 1, according to the Gaza Civil Defense.\n\nThe US State Department on Tuesday expressed concern over the “troubling” discovery of mass graves.\n\nThe “reports are incredibly troubling. And we’re inquiring on this with the Government of Israel,” US State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nGermany will resume cooperation with the UN’s relief agency for Palestinians in Gaza (UNRWA) after the organization accepted the recommendations of an independent review of its neutrality.\n\nThe German foreign office said it was pleased that UNRWA said it would heed the recommendations of the review headed by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna and implement them “swiftly and in full.”\n\nSome context: The review was launched after Israel alleged that a dozen of UNRWA’s 13,000 Gaza staffers were involved in Hamas’ October 7 attack.\n\nIt was not tasked with addressing the allegations but had a broader mandate to “assess whether UNRWA is doing everything within its power to ensure neutrality.” Israel’s allegations are still under investigation by the UN.\n\nUNRWA fired several employees after the allegations and launched an investigation, promising that anyone involved in the October 7 attacks would be held accountable.\n\nThe allegations led the US and at least 13 of its allies to pull funding for the UN agency, which provides aid and services to Palestinian refugees. Several countries have since resumed funding.\n\nThe US Senate has passed a $95 billion package that includes money for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.\n\nThe new legislation includes sanctions on Iran, the seizure of frozen Russian sovereign assets and a measure that could lead to a nationwide ban of TikTok.\n\nThe bill next goes to President Joe Biden, who said he would sign it into law on Wednesday.\n\n“This critical legislation will make our nation and world more secure as we support our friends who are defending themselves against terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin,” Biden said.\n\nHere are the latest developments in the region:\n\nDeath toll keeps rising: After 200 days of war, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave’s health ministry. Its counterpart in Ramallah said that 72% of those killed in Gaza were children, women and the elderly. CNN cannot independently confirm these numbers due to the lack of international media access.\n\nHamas vows to keep fighting: Hamas’ military wing has vowed continued attacks on Israel. “We will keep attacking the enemy with different techniques as long as the aggression continues on our land,” said Abu Obaida, spokesperson of the Al Qassam Brigades. He also said Israel is “trying to renounce all his promises” in ceasefire negotiations and wants to “gain more time.”\n\nMore bodies found in mass grave: Emergency workers recovered at least 35 more bodies from a mass grave in the Nasser medical complex in southern Gaza after Israeli forces withdrew from the neighborhood earlier this month. The total number of bodies found is now 310, according to a local official.\n\nHumanitarian crisis: More than 270,000 tons of solid waste across Gaza remain uncollected, according to the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), as Israel’s military campaign has disrupted essential services. The agency also reported that more than 75% of the population has been displaced, that relief operations there have been “severely restricted” by Israel, and that the health system in the enclave has been crushed.\n\nUS urges Israel to avoid famine in Gaza: A top State Department official said that the risk of famine in Gaza is currently “very high, especially in the north.” Special Envoy for Middle East Humanitarian Issues David Satterfield said “Israel must do everything possible to facilitate efforts to avert famine in Gaza.”\n\nUS campus protests: Pro-Palestinian protests are rocking major American universities, prompting school officials across the country to take extraordinary steps to confront the growing crisis.\n\nIranian threats: Iran’s president said there would “be nothing left” of Israel if it attacked Iran again. The warning came after Israel on Friday carried out a military strike inside Iran, a US official told CNN, although Israel has not officially claimed the attack.\n\nLatest out of Lebanon: The Israeli military says it killed two members of the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. In the southern village of Hanine in Lebanon, an Israeli airstrike targeted a house that killed at least two people and wounded six others, according to state-run media NNA.\n\nQatar’s Hamas office: Qatar has ruled out shutting Hamas’ office in its capital “as long as mediation channels continue.” Qatar is yet to decide whether it will shut the office, as it questions the Palestinian militant group and Israel’s commitment to reach a hostage-ceasefire agreement in Gaza. Qatar, which is leading negotiations on the deal, is under pressure from Israeli and US politicians over its links with Hamas.\n\nIsrael has consistently denied aid convoys to northern Gaza, according to the UN’s agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA).\n\nFood shortages are worst in northern Gaza, where Israel concentrated its military offensive in the early days of the war.\n\nIsraeli authorities vetoed at least 27 out of 81 aid missions that require coordination in the north and south of the strip, between April 1 and April 19, UNRWA said in a report. The last time UNRWA was able to deliver food supplies to the area was on January 23.\n\nThe Israeli agency in charge of inspecting convoys entering Gaza told CNN earlier this month that it was “cooperating [in the north] with a wide array of humanitarian organisations” including UN agencies and regional actors.\n\nSince the beginning of April, an average of 186 aid trucks have crossed into Gaza per day via the Kerem Shalom and Rafah land crossings, UNRWA said.\n\nAs of April 8, UNRWA said it had delivered flour to nearly 400,000 families in southern Gaza. Before the war, about 500 trucks of supplies were entering the Palestinian enclave daily.\n\nBarely trickling in: Human rights agencies have repeatedly warned that Israel’s severe restrictions on aid entering Gaza means relief is barely trickling into the strip.\n\nUNRWA says there “has been very little significant change in the volume of humanitarian supplies entering Gaza or improved access to the north.”\n\nIsraeli agencies have frequently blamed the UN for failing to distribute aid within Gaza, saying last week that hundreds of trucks of aid piled up at Kerem Shalom.\n\nYoung children wearing sandals pucker their faces under the Gazan sun. Others drift barefoot across the courtyard of a sprawling school in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.\n\nCNN footage shows clothes on washing lines and dusty plastic tents fluttering in the wind.\n\nPalestinians described months of forced displacement as they waited anxiously for news from relatives separated across the enclave, with no relief from Israeli strikes.\n\nRahaf Shabbat, a young student who was forced to flee from Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza, told CNN she was heartbroken when the war disrupted her school year.\n\nAnother Palestinian child, Rama Shabat, says she has not seen her loved ones for seven months.\n\nHala Abdan, a lawyer, said her 20-year-old son’s left foot was amputated after he was injured by a drone strike in December.\n\n“I struggle to provide him anything, just like all the Palestinian people,” she said. “It has been 200 days full of suffering that one can barely bear… 200 days of catastrophe.”"
