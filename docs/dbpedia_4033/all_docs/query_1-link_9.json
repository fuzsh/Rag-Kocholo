        "text": "South Korea was originally given the privilege of hosting VI Asian Games. However, due to various political and financial factors, South Korea decided that they were not able to honor their commitment, 16 months after the fifth Games. For a brief moment, fate of the Asian looked bleak. However, with excitement of the previous Games still kindling in Thais, Bangkok came in to rescue the Asian Games Movement by hosting two Asian Games in sequence. Most of the venues from the last Games were re-used and Yachting events were introduced for the first time. In the medal tally, Japanese excelled others with 144, South Korea 54 and Thailand 29. The Games was long remembered for its friendly and informal atmosphere.\n\nParticipating Nations\n\n18\n\nParticipants\n\n2500\n\nSports/Events\n\n13\n\nAthletics, Swimming, Soccer, Tennis, Basketball, Volleyball, Table Tennis, Cycling, Boxing, Wrestling, Shooting, Hockey and Badminton\n\nSport added: Sailing\n\nThe top three winners were: Japan , Korea and Thailand\n\nMedal Tally of VI Asian Games\n\nRank.\n\nNation\n\nMedals\n\nGold\n\nSilver\n\nBronze\n\nTotal\n\n1\n\nJapan\n\n74\n\n47\n\n23\n\n144\n\n2\n\nKorea\n\n18\n\n13\n\n23\n\n54\n\n3\n\nThailand\n\n9\n\n17\n\n13\n\n39\n\n4\n\nIran\n\n9\n\n7\n\n7\n\n23\n\n5\n\nIndia\n\n6\n\n9\n\n10\n\n25\n\n6\n\nIsrael\n\n6\n\n6\n\n5\n\n17\n\n7\n\nMalaysia\n\n5\n\n1\n\n7\n\n13\n\n8\n\nMyanmar\n\n3\n\n2\n\n7\n\n12\n\n9\n\nIndonesia\n\n2\n\n5\n\n17\n\n24\n\n10\n\nCeylon\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-\n\n4\n\n11\n\nPhilippines\n\n1\n\n9\n\n12\n\n22\n\n12\n\nChina\n\n1\n\n5\n\n12\n\n18\n\n13\n\nPakistan\n\n1\n\n2\n\n7\n\n10\n\n14\n\nSingapore\n\n-\n\n6\n\n9\n\n15\n\n15\n\nCambodia\n\n-\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n16\n\nVietnam\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2\n\n2\n\nTotal\n\n137\n\n133\n\n157\n\n427\n\nPakistan Medal Tally in VI Asian Games\n\nS.No.\n\nDiscipline\n\nMedals\n\nGold\n\nSilver\n\nBronze\n\nTotal\n\n1.\n\nAthletics\n\n-\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2.\n\nBoxing\n\n-\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n3.\n\nHockey\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n4.\n\nWrestling\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2\n\n2\n\nTotal\n\n1\n\n2\n\n7\n\n10"
