        "text": "Cairo:\n\nIsraeli forces on Wednesday issued new evacuation orders to Palestinians in areas of north Gaza that were among the first to be hit at the start of the war with Hamas in October, after Hamas operatives fired a fresh volley of rockets into Israel.\n\nArmy spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted the evacuation orders for several districts in Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, two now largely destroyed towns into which Israeli tanks swept at the outset of Israel's ground invasion.\n\n\"Hamas and terrorist organisations are firing rockets from your area towards the State of Israel. The IDF will act forcefully and immediately against them,\" Adraee said in the message sent by text and social media to Palestinian residents.\n\n\"For your own safety, evacuate immediately to the known shelters in the center of Gaza City,\" the army spokesman said.\n\nIn a nearby Gaza City neighbourhood, Al-Tuffah, an Israeli airstrike on a house killed three Palestinians, medics said.\n\nLater on Wednesday, 10 Palestinians were killed in two separate Israeli strikes in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Medics said one strike killed three people on a motorcycle west of Khan Younis, while seven others were killed in tank shelling that hit a tent encampment in Abassan town, east of the city.\n\nMultiple Fronts\n\nFighting has continued in the Gaza Strip even as Israel braces for an expected assault in its north from Iran and its close Lebanese ally Hezbollah after the July 31 assassination in the Iranian capital Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has killed dozens of Hamas operatives in recent days and on Wednesday said troops had hit weapons-making facilities in the teeming district of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the fighting have taken shelter.\n\nIn other central areas, Israeli tanks shelled Nuseirat and Bureij, two of Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps. Israel says Hamas operatives use civilian infrastructure for cover and to conceal operations posts and arms caches; Hamas denies this.\n\nHamas operatives say they continue to carry out ambush attacks on Israeli troops and armoured vehicles with explosive devices, and are still able to launch limited rocket salvoes into Israel.\n\nOn Tuesday, Islamic Jihad, a close Hamas ally, said it fired rockets into Israel in response to what it called Israeli \"massacres of civilians\".\n\nThe Israeli military said that over the past week Hamas had fired rockets from launchers embedded near two international humanitarian aid and distribution warehouses, including the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israeli forces struck those sites, it added.\n\nHamas-led operatives set off the Gaza war on Oct. 7 with a cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIn response, Israel has pursued a relentless assault on Gaza that has reduced much of the heavily populated coastal strip to ruins, killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded over 91,500, according to Gaza health ministry figures.\n\nThe Hamas-led ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists."
