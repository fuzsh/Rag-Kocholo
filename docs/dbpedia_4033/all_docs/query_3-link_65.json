        "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with President Joe Biden in Washington on Thursday, a day after Netanyahu delivered a scathing speech to Congress in which he vowed to achieve “total victory” against Hamas and denounced American opponents of the war in Gaza as “idiots.”\n\nHamas has slammed the speech and accused Netanyahu of obstructing efforts to end the war and return the hostages.\n\nOfficials from Egypt, Israel, the U.S. and Qatar had been expected to meet Thursday in Doha with the aim of resuming talks for a proposed three-phase cease-fire to end the war between Israel and Hamas and free the remaining hostages. But an Israeli official said Israel's negotiating team was delayed and would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nPalestinians displaced by the Israeli military's latest order to leave parts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis say they are sleeping in the streets. The Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in the war.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nIran is behind an online campaign to threaten the Israeli Olympic delegation, Israel says\n\nIsraeli officials on Thursday accused Iran of orchestrating an online campaign to intimidate members of the Israeli Olympic delegation.\n\nIn a statement, Israel's National Cyber ​​Directorate said hackers opened online channels to send threatening messages and publish private information about the delegation members who are in Paris for the 2024 Games.\n\nThe agency said it is working with the Israeli Olympic Committee and other officials to protect the members of the delegation.\n\n“Iran is taking advantage of an apolitical international sports competition to promote digital terrorist activity against Israel and its right to participate in these competitions,” said Gabi Portnoy, head of the national cyber directorate.\n\nNetanyahu praises Biden’s ‘support for the state of Israel’\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised President Joe Biden during made his long-awaited White House visit on Thursday afternoon.\n\n“From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,” Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nThe president thanked Netanyahu and noted that his first meeting with an Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, was in 1973 soon after he was elected to the Senate. Biden joked that he was only 12 years old at the time.\n\nNetanyahu's first White House visit since before President Donald Trump left office in 2020, comes at a time of growing pressure on all three to find an endgame to the nine-month war that's left more than 39,000 dead in Gaza. Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nNetanyahu is also scheduled to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris later today.\n\nProtesters hold a ‘die-in’ near the White House\n\nProtesters against the Gaza war held a \"die-in\" across from Lafayette Park and the White House on Thursday as President Joe Biden met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe protesters poured red liquid onto the street, saying it symbolized the blood of those killed in Gaza. They chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of Netanyahu with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. The jumpsuit reads, \"Wanted for crimes against humanity.\"\n\nA small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nIsraeli military has shot 3 U.N. aid convoys recently, U.N. secretary-general says\n\nUNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said Thursday that there’s “total lawlessness” in Gaza, adding that three of the world body’s aid convoys have come under fire within three days.\n\nThe shootings happened between Sunday and Tuesday, and bullets pierced the vehicles Monday and Tuesday, Guterres said at a news conference at U.N. headquarters.\n\n“They were shot by the Israeli military,” he said.\n\nThe U.N. had released information Tuesday about gunfire hitting a convoy carrying humanitarian workers and children near the Wadi Gaza checkpoint and striking another set of U.N. aid vehicles in the same area days earlier. No one was injured. It wasn't immediately clear whether one or both of those incidents were among the three that Guterres mentioned Thursday.\n\nHe called Gaza’s humanitarian situation “a total disaster,” attributing it to the deadliness and destruction of Israel’s military campaign and to a security vacuum.\n\n“Nobody’s in charge of security anywhere in the area of Gaza,” Guterres said.\n\nHezbollah attacks Israeli military post, no injuries reported\n\nBEIRUT — Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group said it attacked an Israeli military post in northern Israel with explosive drones after one of its members was killed earlier Thursday in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nHezbollah said that its attack directly hit the base in Neve Ziv.\n\nAfter sirens sounded in northern Israel regarding hostile aircraft infiltrations and rocket and missile launches, the Israeli military said multiple “suspicious aerial targets” were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory.\n\nThe army added that unsuccessful interception attempts were carried out. As a result of falling shrapnel from the interception attempts, fires broke out in several areas but no injuries were reported.\n\nIsraeli Fire and Rescue Services are operating to extinguish the fires, the army said.\n\nHezbollah said the attack with drones was in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike on south Lebanon earlier in the day that killed a member of the group, Abdullah Mohammed Faqih.\n\nSince early October, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed more than 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members, but also around 90 civilians and noncombatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nIsraeli strikes on Khan Younis kill at least 7 Palestinians overnight\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes on the southern city of Khan Younis killed at least seven Palestinians overnight into Thursday, according to hospital officials and an Associated Press journalist who counted the bodies.\n\nAt the start of July, the Israeli military ordered parts of the city to be evacuated. On Monday, it added the Muwasi humanitarian zone and other parts of the crowded south to be evacuated. Renewed hostilities and mass displacement followed.\n\nOne strike hit the roof of a house in a neighborhood in eastern Khan Younis, killing three people who were inside. In another neighborhood, at least four others from the al-Attar family, who had previously fled from northern Gaza, were killed in a separate strike that hit their tent.\n\nThe bodies were taken to the Nasser Hospital and wrapped in blue and white bags. A group of women and girls wept after seeing the bodies at the hospital before funeral prayers. One girl said, “Goodbye, mother,” as she cried in the arms of a woman standing next to her.\n\nOutside the hospital, a Muslim sheikh led funeral prayers for the dead alongside a group of men. People then gathered around the bodies before they were placed on a truck and sent for burial.\n\nSince the Israel-Hamas war began, 39,175 people have been killed and 90,403 others wounded in Gaza, according to its Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The ministry in the Palestinian enclave also said Gaza's hospitals received 30 dead bodies and 146 wounded people over the past 24 hours.\n\nHamas slams Netanyahu's speech to Congress\n\nBEIRUT — The Palestinian Hamas group slammed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s fiery speech to the United States Congress, accusing him Thursday of obstructing efforts to end the war and return the hostages.\n\nIn his high profile visit to Washington, Netanyahu pledged to achieve \"total victory\" against the militant group in his nearly one-hour address in Congress, and derided protests against the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, now in its ninth month.\n\nHamas said Netanyahu's Washington visit was an address to improve his image after the International Criminal Court requested to issue arrest warrants against him for war crimes. The ICC also requested warrants for his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Hamas officials Mohammed Deif, Yehya Sinwar, and Ismail Haniyeh.\n\n“He (Netanyahu) is the one who thwarted all efforts aimed at ending the war and concluding a deal to release the prisoners, despite the continuous efforts of mediators from the brothers in Egypt and Qatar despite the flexibility and positivity shown by the movement,” the militant group said in a written statement, adding that the Israeli prime minister talking about intensified efforts to free the hostages is a “complete lie” to mislead public opinion.\n\nThey also rejected Netanyahu’s vision for Gaza's future — which would consist of a demilitarized civilian administration in the enclave — and accused Netanyahu of being dishonest about aid delivery into the Gaza Strip and downplaying the number of Palestinians killed in the ongoing war.\n\n6 hostage relatives are released after being detained in Washington during Netanyahu's speech to Congress\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel — A group representing the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza said Thursday that six hostage relatives have been released after they were briefly detained during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the joint session of Congress.\n\nThe family members stood in the hall silently during the address Wednesday and wore yellow shirts that read “Seal the Deal Now,” referring to a cease-fire deal to free the hostages, before they were removed from the House chamber by security officers. They were released a number of hours later, the Hostages Family Forum said.\n\n“Benjamin Netanyahu spoke for 54 minutes and he did not mention once the need to seal the deal and to sign the deal now,” said Gil Dickmann, whose cousin, Carmel Gat, is being held in Gaza.\n\nThe six said they were invited by members of Congress to attend the speech. Netanyahu brought to the speech rescued hostage Noa Argamani and a number of family members of the hostages as part of his official delegation.\n\nIsrael recovers 5 hostage bodies from Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Thursday it has recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages in a tunnel under the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, that were abducted by Hamas militants on Oct. 7.\n\nIt identified the hostages as Maya Goren, and four soldiers it says died in battle: Sgt. Oren Goldin, Staff Sgt. Tomer Ahimas, Sgt. Maj. Ravid Aryeh Katz and Sgt. Kiril Brodski. It says all five were believed to have been killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas raid that triggered the war, and their bodies were held hostage.\n\nKibbutz Nir Oz, one of the hardest-hit communities during Hamas’ assault, said Wednesday that it was informed that the body of Goren, 56, was returned to Israel after a rescue mission, without providing additional details. Israeli authorities had said in late 2023 that she was dead.\n\nThe chief military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said the bodies had been found in a tunnel under Khan Younis. He said the location was in an area that Israel declared in May to be part of an expanded humanitarian zone where Palestinians should take refuge. It was not known how long the bodies had been kept in the tunnel.\n\nIsrael has now pronounced dead more than a third of the roughly 110 hostages who remain in Hamas captivity.\n\nAustralia sanctions 7 Israelis and a West Bank-based youth group over settler violence\n\nSYDNEY — Australia is imposing financial sanctions and travel bans against seven Israeli citizens and financial sanctions against a West Bank-based youth group over their alleged involvement in settler violence in the occupied territory.\n\nThe sanctions announced Thursday are against Hilltop Youth and its leader Meir Ettinger, 32. Other targeted individuals are Yinon Levi, 31; Zvi Bar Yosef, 31; Neria Ben Pazi, 30; Elisha Yered, 23; David Chai Chasdai, 29; and Einan Tanjil, 22.\n\nAustralia accuses them of violent attacks on Palestinians. These include beatings, sexual assault and torture of Palestinians resulting in serious injuries and deaths, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a statement.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government imposed the sanctions \"because it's the right thing to do.\" He added that settlements in the West Bank impeded a two-state solution and were illegal under international law.\n\nThe sanctions follow the United States' decision to sanction entities and individuals connected to acts of violence against civilians in the West Bank.\n\nWong said Australia called on Israel to hold perpetrators of settler violence to account and cease ongoing settlement activity."
