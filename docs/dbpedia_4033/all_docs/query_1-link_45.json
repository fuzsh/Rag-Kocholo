        "text": "The Women’s World Cup may be over, but the world of sport is as busy as ever. Par for the course at Skating Panda, we also have real impact on our minds. So, we got to wondering – how can sports and impact intersect – in other words, how do sports create real social and environmental impact? ❤️ While the physical health impacts are clear, there are also excellent mental and emotional health benefits to participating in sports. Studies show that sports are associated with lower rates of anxiety and depression, and they release endorphins while reducing levels of cortisol, the primary stress hormone. 🤾🏽♀️ Sports can generate community and be an incredible way to meet people, whether through collaboration in team sports like football or meeting regularly at a community centre for individual sports like archery. It can be an opportunity for people from different backgrounds to interact and get to know each other. 🧠 Self-confidence and self-esteem can be developed through sports, through learning to trust in yourself and your abilities, and by learning that self-worth is not tied to whether you win or lose or how advanced your skills are. 🚴🏾♂️ Even sports like cycling can have a positive environmental impact – biking places reduces your carbon footprint, allowing you to live more sustainably! What do you believe is the most significantly impactful aspect of sports? Let us know in the comments below. #Sport #RealImpact #Purpose #Health #MentalHealth #BCorp #SkatingPanda\n\n🏊♂️ As we gear up for the Paris 2024 Olympics, there's a critical issue that's less about the podium and more about the pontoon - the water quality of the Seine River! As athletes from around the globe prepare for this iconic event, a disturbing revelation has surfaced. A U.S. triathlete unexpectedly found herself prepping for an entirely different kind of competition: battling E.coli exposure during her training sessions in the Seine. This should raise more than just eyebrows; it should prompt urgent actions. Having trained for a triathlon myself, I know the integral role of water environments in such sporting events. Athletes often overlook the risks associated with water quality, focusing instead on stamina and speed. It's startling yet vital that we spotlight these environmental and health concerns as global sporting events like the Olympics approach. 🌍 What should we be asking? Here are a few prompts: - How are event organizers addressing these environmental challenges? - What measures can athletes take to safeguard their health during such competitions? - How might this impact the reputation and future international sporting events in terms of environmental sustainability? I believe as a global community, we should hold event organizers accountable for providing safe, clean environments for all competitors.

They certainly seem to be making changes after they receive complaints, that is something to be commended at least. 🤔 I wonder though, if they had paid more attention to their audience in certain areas, maybe they would have been prepared and made changes BEFORE the complaints came in. I am not in the food industry, and I am not an athlete, BUT, I do know that if I was catering for athletes, I would have put meat, protein and high carb at the top of my list of food I needed in high volume, vegan wouldn't have featured too high in my list. Especially for this group of athletes, the most elite in the world! ▶️ Was it another case of a wonderful vision, without a good strategy?!? A good strategy would have surely seen this as one of the largest obstacles they would have faced? Were there too many people at the top excited by the 'food vision' that they lost sight of who they were actually catering for? ❓Did they forget their audience? ❓Did they mistake their vision for a strategy? ❓Did anyone flag this as an issue ahead of the games? Incase you were wondering, that photo was taken 12 years ago at the London Olympics. The French are known for their world class cuisine, I am sure Michael Roux and Raymond Blanc say that butter and cream make every meal better!? Or something along those lines! #parisolympics #paris2024 #parisolympcis2024 #olympics2024 #olympicgames #getlogicalstrategy #getlogical #goingforgold\n\n#Sports are a universal language that transcends boundaries, cultures, and languages, connecting people in a way few other activities can. Its beauty lies in its #ability to #inspire, #challenge, and unite. Watching athletes push their limits, achieve the #impossible, and overcome adversity offers a spectacle of human strength and spirit that is unmatched by any other form of entertainment. Seriously, if you don't love sports, you might want to check your pulse! Take the ongoing #Olympics, for instance. They are not just a showcase of athletic prowess but a stage for incredible stories of perseverance and triumph that Hollywood could only dream of scripting. Did you hear about Allyson Felix, the 35-year-old sprinter who’s participating in her fifth Olympics? She’s practically the Benjamin Button of track and field! Or how about Oksana Chusovitina, the 46-year-old gymnast who’s defying gravity and father time in her eighth Olympics? She’s so experienced, she probably taught the original Olympians how to stick a landing. And then there’s #AlexMorgan, the 39-year-old football player who’s competing in her fourth Olympics. She’s a living testament to the idea that age is just a number—though perhaps it’s also a very large number if you’re calculating the hours she’s spent on the field. Then we have #SteffenPeters, a 59-year-old equestrian, still riding strong and proving that age and wisdom can indeed compete with youth and vigor. These narratives go beyond physical accomplishments; they represent years of dedication, resilience, and unwavering passion. Seeing a seven-month #pregnant woman like Egyptian fencer #NadaHafez compete is nothing short of mind-blowing. You’ve got to respect someone who’s balancing their center of gravity with a baby on board and still managing to score points. Such stories are more compelling than any scripted drama. They remind us that with #determination and #hardwork, we can overcome any obstacle. Sports reveal the best in #humanity, showing us what we are #capable of when we push ourselves beyond our perceived limits. If you don't love sports, perhaps you haven't yet experienced these #awe-inspiring moments that demonstrate the true essence of human potential. The beauty of sports lies in these shared experiences and the emotional highs and lows that come with them. It's not just about #winning or #losing; it's about the journey, the struggle, and the triumphs that resonate with our own life stories. And let’s face it, sometimes it’s just fun to watch people do things we could never dream of doing ourselves—even if it’s just to make us feel a bit better about that #gym membership we never use.\n\nIn the unlikely event I ever run another marathon, I wouldn’t want to do it at night. But some famous global running events, including the world championships in #Doha, are having to reschedule races to avoid participants having to run in #extremeheat conditions. Midnight long-distance running is just one stark example highlighted by sports ecologist Madeleine Orr in her new book, Warming Up: How Climate Change is Changing Sport. Elite and professional sports are being affected by changing environmental issues – and she explains how global sports movements can do something about that. It’s a timely publication. May 2024 was the warmest May on record around the world, with a global average surface air temperature 0.65°C above the 1991–2020 average. It also marked the 12th consecutive month for which the global average temperature reached a record value for the corresponding month in the previous year. This is not the sort of record-breaking streak the world needs. And this summer, millions of sports fans are watching an action-packed season of sport from the #Euro 2024 football tournament in #Germany and the #Wimbledon tennis championships to the #ParisOlympics and the Tour de #France cycling challenge. Further afield, there’s the Copa America South American football championship, major league baseball’s All-Star Game and the #US tennis open in #NewYorkCity, the women’s football world cup in #Colombia and the rugby championship in #Australia. These competitions showcase top-tier athletic performances, attracting billions of viewers numbers that are predicted to rise. And all of these sporting events are being affected by climate in some way. Already this year, football in the #UK has been hit by heavy rainfall and #flooding, while tennis players in the US have had to endure blistering temperatures. The #TourdeFrance, meanwhile, was marred by melting road surfaces, and routes were cut short for rider safety as temperatures in La Route d'Occitanie in southern France soared in July 2022. If the tournaments themselves don’t provide concessions for #extremeweather this year, the athletes’ preparations almost certainly already have. For example, the kits that sports men and women wear are changing. It was once the domain of the designer to create clothing that was agile and give competitors the edge, now they are tasked with creating garments that wick sweat away and keep body heat down in competitions such as running, cycling and football, as temperatures peak. In her book, Orr shows how the world of sport is being affected by climate change in bizarre and unusual ways. For example, alcoholism has increased among staff working on ski slopes, because a warming planet is causing snow to melt and ski seasons to end sooner. The resulting reduction in ski training times is literally driving staff to drink.\n\nGetting better, every day again... I wasn't the first, Dave Brailsford (Manchester United) and Merijn Zeeman (AZ Alkmaar) won't be the last to make a switch from one sport to the other. Fortunately, clubs and teams are willing to look further for refreshing ideas, innovative ways to perform better and get some new energy into the eco-system. One of the most asked questions I always got: what are the main differences between professional cycling teams and football clubs? Let alone the business model that is hard to compare: no TV income or ticket sales for cycling teams, a very different association for the main sponsors of football clubs. Let alone football's influence of the so called 5th column, composed of former icons, sponsors and some journalists, which is hardly there in pro cycling. One of the main differences is the way to get better at things. I have seen football trainers being hailed for an extra day off, or arranging beer and pizza after a regular game. The so called people managers who's first priority is to have a good ambiance in the team. In an earlier post, i already emphasized the reality of every sports team: they know the order of the pack themselves. So if the priority of the CEO is to have a trainer that tries to have peace and be popular, he shoot himself in the foot. If you wanna be populair, try to give away ice cream in a busy place on a sunny day. The right athlete wants to become better, at least that started the dream of becoming a professional. If somewhere along the way that mentality disappears (and there are many distractions!) it needs a good coach to get the maximum out of the athlete. At times that might feel as a confrontation which can be extremely uncomfortable. It demands a lot of soft skills from the entourage, because each personality should feel the freedom to be him or herself. I would love to meet some of my former athletes in 10, 20 years and knowing they got everything out of their career, which will also shape their life after they stopped being a professional athlete. It does take a lot of effort to group the right players or cyclists and pair them with a staff that understands the assignment. An up-beat, positive and highly motivated athlete can reach heights. To assist them in their journey for the highest level in the sport is a privilege and an honor. #sportsmanagement #highperformance #sportsbusiness #sportecosystem\n\nIn the realm of sports, there comes a time when athletes must confront the formidable challenge of transition. It's a universal truth, applicable whether you're on the field, within an organization, or even navigating the corridors of education. These moments of change demand a profound courage to step into the unknown. As we stand at the precipice of transition, contemplating a departure, we grapple with the formidable task of leaving behind the accolades we've painstakingly earned and the very purpose that defined us for so long. Whether the decision to part ways is our own or life's way of nudging us towards new horizons, there's a palpable fear of unfinished business and, sometimes, the sting of perceived injustice. Yet, in the face of these uncertainties, embarking on this new journey unveils a spectrum of perspectives and initiates a cascade of self-discovery. It's a process that, though daunting, offers a unique opportunity for personal evolution. As we rediscover ourselves and navigate the uncharted waters of the future, we often find that the bitter taste of farewell transforms into the sweet realization of growth and new possibilities. #newbeginnings #mentalhealthawareness #couragetochange"
