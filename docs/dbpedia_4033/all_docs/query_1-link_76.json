My name is Christian Acuña and I am a senior in biomedical engineering, specializing in biomechanics and biomaterials, and also pursuing a minor in mechanical engineering. I transferred into SBU last year after getting an associates degree through Rockland Community College’s honors program, choosing BME through a mixed interest/enjoyment of biology and physics.\n\nI spend most of my time surrounded by music, be it studying, singing or dancing. I competitively dance as a part of the SBU Ballroom team, where I am also a public relations specialist as a part of their e-board. In my free time I enjoy dnd, cooking, singing and anyone who spends enough time with me will know I’m an absolute cat person and that I’m pretty decent at taking photos.\n\nIn the future I’d love to work with prosthetics in any way, however anything relating mechanical forces to implants or biological tissue really catches my interest. I look forward to my first year as a part of BMES as their historian and getting to know the rest of the BMES crew. If you see me taking pictures, don’t forget to smile!\n\n2021-2022 Executive Board\n\nHey guys! My name is Julia Capobianco and I am a junior studying Biomedical Engineering and Applied Mathematics & Statistics. I currently work in Dr. Chan’s lab developing a feedback-controlled software mechanism to grow cells in biotechnology experiments, specifically immunotherapy. I have an interest in the administrative side of engineering and one day hope to be a project manager. Girl bosses only!\n\nAside from academics, I am on the e-board for Stony Brook’s Women’s Club Lacrosse team and am an RA in Kelly Quad. I also work as a marketing intern for Stony Brook Athletics, which gives me a nice break from STEM activities. I enjoy sporting events, traveling, and eating good food (Italian and Greek are my favorite). As this year’s Academic Chair, I hope to host fun events that showcase the academic realm of BME in a fun, innovative way. Stony Brook can be a very competitive and overwhelming school, but together we can make the best of our time here. Don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions. We look forward to having you at our events!\n\nVice President: Alexander Maus\n\nAlexander is a Junior BME/AMS Double Major specializing in biomechanics/biomaterials. This is his second year on BMES’ E-Board, and he will be our Vice President. While on campus, he has kept involved in the BME and bioengineering communities, acting as Secretary of BMES last year and participating on the Stony Brook iGEM team Freshman and Sophomore year. As VP, he hopes to continue to increase the club’s interaction amongst its members despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nTreasurer: Joshua Goodman\n\nHi! My name is Josh Goodman and I’m the Treasurer of BMES. I’m an AMS and BIO double major with a minor in Bioengineering! My aspiration is and has always been to become a doctor, but here at Stony Brook I have discovered a love for mathematics and I am now pursuing this minor which combines both of my interests in a tangible way. On the side, I currently work with AMS Professor Reuter trying to derive Complex Band Structure for dendritic materials. In my free time, I love to just jam out to music (especially heavy metal) or play some video games.\n\nVice President: Liliana Henriquez\n\nHello! My name is Liliana Henriquez and I am the Vice President of BMES. Last year, I had the opportunity to be the Academic Chair.

After graduation, I would like to attend graduate school to pursue Ph.D. in Medical Physics. Currently, I am doing research for the Radiology Department with Dr. Terry Button on early Breast cancer detection with the use of DIRI and Biomedical Engineering Department for Dr. Chan on ‘Lab in a Cube’. Outside of school and work, my interests include hiking, mountain climbing, cooking and reading thriller novel.\n\n2018-2019 Faculty Advisor\n\nDr. Wei Yin-Rubenstein\n\n2015-2016 Executive Board\n\nPresident: Gabe Ruttner\n\nAcademic & Outreach VP: Shipra Arjun\n\nProfessional & Social VP: Ravi Patel\n\nTreasurer: Adiba Chowdhury\n\nSecretary: Amy Young\n\nAcademic Chair: Milan Gunasekera\n\nOutreach Chair: Gita Vikram\n\nOutreach Chair: Manasvi Varshney\n\nProfessional Development Chair: Sofya Pugach\n\nProfessional Development Chair: Christopher Balzano\n\nSocial Chair & Roth Regatta Coordinator: Amna Haider\n\nGraduate representative: Samantha Rossano\n\nCommunications Secretary: Samantha Weber-Fishkin\n\nPublic Relations: Sarah Heacox\n\nWebmaster: Juan Bastidas\n\nE-Ball Representative: Michael Witherspoon\n\nFaculty Advisor: Dr. Wei Yin-Rubenstein\n\n2014-2015 Executive Board\n\nPresident: Arnavi Varshney\n\nAcademic & Social VP: Christina Snyder\n\nOutreach & Professional VP: Gabe Ruttner\n\nTreasurer: John Medamana\n\nSecretary: Samantha Rossano\n\nAcademic Chair: Shruti Parikh\n\nOutreach Chair: Shipra Arjun\n\nProfessional Development Chair: Vinosh Mathuranayagam\n\nProfessional Development Chair: Ravi Patel\n\nSocial Chair: Manasvi Varshney\n\nGraduate representative: Mariana Miranda\n\nCommunications Secretary: Amy Young\n\nPublic Relations: Adiba Chowdhury\n\nWebmaster: Sofya Pugach\n\nE-Ball Representative: Amna Haider\n\nFaculty Advisor: Dr. Wei Yin-Rubenstein\n\n2013-2014 Executive Board\n\nCo-President: Muhammed Kandeel Javid\n\nCo-President: Arnavi Varshney\n\nVice-President: Christina Synder\n\nTreasurer: Raeish Hinson\n\nSecretary: Mariana Miranda\n\nInternal Commucation Secretary: Morgan Teeratananon\n\nPublic Relations: Samantha Rossano\n\nAcademic Chair: Shruti Parikh\n\nIndustry Chair: Amit Guruprasad\n\nProfessional Development Chair: Vinosh Mathuranayagam\n\nSocial Chair: John Medamana\n\nCo-Outreach Chair: Gabriel Ruttner\n\nOutreach Chair/Webmaster: Arely Clavel\n\nFaculty Advisor: Dr. Wei Yin-Rubenstein\n\n2012-2013 Executive Board\n\nPresident: Sowmya Sundaresh\n\nVice-President: Michele Cheung\n\nTreasurer: Muhammed Kandeel Javid\n\nSecretary (1): Christina Snyder\n\nSecretary (2): Arnavi Varshney\n\nWebmaster: Jashna Benday\n\nInternal Commucation Secretary: Arely Clavel\n\nSocial Chair: Arnavi Varshney\n\nGraduate Representative: Steve Leigh\n\nFaculty Advisor: Dr. Emilia Entcheva\n\n2011-2012 Executive Board\n\nPresident: Sowmya Sundaresh\n\nVice-President: Margaret Evans\n\nTreasurer: Michelle Cheung\n\nSecretary: Kathryn Small\n\nWebmaster (1): Ram Proshad Ghosh\n\nWebmaster (2): Cheng Qian\n\nInternal Commucation: Mika Lai\n\nCommunication Secretary: Christina Snyder\n\nSocial Chair: Vihita Patel\n\nGraduate Representative: Steve Leigh\n\nFaculty Advisor: Dr. Emilia Entcheva\n\n2010-2011 Executive Board\n\nPresident: Margaret Evans\n\nVice-President: Erica Palma\n\nTreasurer: Sowmya Sundaresh\n\nSecretary: Rahul Mehta\n\nCommunications Secretary (1): Cookie Yu\n\nCommunications Secretary (2): Marek Lhotak\n\nChief Technical Officer: Mika Lai\n\nWebmaster: Ada Tsoi\n\nSocial Chair: Kushagra Singhal\n\nE-Ball Representative: Antonio Wong\n\nGraduate Representative: Steve Leigh\n\nFaculty Advisor: Dr. Emilia Entcheva\n\n2009-2010 Executive Board\n\nPresident: Kathleen Burke\n\nVice-President: Elizabeth Fievisohn\n\nTreasurer: Erica Palma\n\nSecretary: Margaret Evans\n\nCommunications Secretary: Dan DeDora\n\nChief Technical Officer: Richard Hill\n\nWebmaster: Ada Tsoi\n\nFaculty Advisor: Dr. Emilia Entcheva\n\n2008-2009 Executive Board\n\nPresident: Matthew Mancuso\n\nVice-President: Hala Mostafa\n\nTreasurer: Kathleen Burke\n\nSecretary: Margaret Evans\n\nSocial Chair: Elizabeth Fievisohn\n\nWebmaster: Jeryes Frieh\n\nFaculty Advisor: Dr. Emilia Entcheva\n\n2007-2008 Executive Board\n\nPresident: Ujas Shah\n\nVice President: Hala Mostafa\n\nTreasurer: Adriana Gomez\n\nSecretary: Karin Wang\n\nSocial Chair: Matthew Mancuso\n\nWebmaster: Ravi Desai\n\n2004-2005 Executive Board\n\nPresident: Sailaja Akella\n\nVice President: Debolina Kowshik\n\nTreasurer: Muhammad Parvaz\n\nSecretary: Lamya Karim\n\nSocial Chair: Eduardo Vargas\n\nWebmaster: Jenn Looi\n\nFaculty Advisor: Dr. Michael Hadjiargyrou\n\n2003-2004 Executive Board"
