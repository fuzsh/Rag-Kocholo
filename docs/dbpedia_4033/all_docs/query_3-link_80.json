        "text": "Veteran striker Younis Mahmoud has been included in Iraq's 23-man squad for next month's AFC Asian Cup in Australia despite being without a club.\n\n31-year-old Mahmoud scored the only goal in the 2007 Asian Cup final which gave Iraq their maiden continental title against fellow West Asians Saudi Arabia to earn icon status. He is one of only four players above the age of 25 in coach Hakeem Shaker's youthful line-up.\n\nMahmoud emerged joint top scorer in the 2007 tournament and was the runner up for AFC Footballer of the year honours. He has scored 51 goals for Iraq in 130 appearances.\n\nShaker's team -- which has nine players from defending Iraqi Premier League champions Al-Shurta -- will not feature 37-year-old winger Mahdi Karim, another star performer during Iraq's continental triumph seven years ago. And, surprisingly, 21-year-old playmaker Saif Salman has also missed out on a place in the youthful squad.\n\nThe Lions of Mesopotamia are drawn in Group D along with defending champions Japan. The two meet in Brisbane on Jan. 16 in a clash of the two most recent winners of the competition. The group also includes fellow West Asian teams Jordan and Palestine.\n\nShaker's men will play a final friendly against neighbours Iran on Sunday. They will begin their tournament campaign on Jan. 12 against Jordan, also in Brisbane.\n\nSquad:\n\nGoalkeepers - Jalal Hasssan (Arbil), Mohammed Hamed (Al-Shurta), Ali Yasin (Naft Al-Janoub)\n\nDefenders - Ahmed Ibrahim (Ajman/UAE), Ali Bahjat (Al-Shurta), Ali Faiz (Arbil), Salak Shaker (Al-Shurta), Walid Salim (Al-Shurta), Samih Saeed (Nadi Amana Baghdad), Ali Adnan (Caykur Rizespor/Turkey), Dhargham Ismail (Al-Shurta)\n\nMidfielders - Ahmed Yasin (Orebro SK/Sweden), Amjad Kelaf (Al-Shurta), Ali Husni (Al-Minaa),Humam Tariq (Al-Dhafra/UAE), Yaser Kasim (Swindon Town/England), Saad Abdul-Amir (Arbil) Mahdi Kamil (Al-Shurta), Osama Rashid (Alphense Boys/Netherlands)"
