        "text": "Yunus Emre (born c. 1238, Turkey—died c. 1320, Turkey) was a poet and mystic who exercised a powerful influence on Turkish literature.\n\nThough legend obscures the facts of his life, he is known to have been a Sufi (Islamic mystic) who sat for 40 years at the feet of his master, Tapduk Emre. Yunus Emre was well versed in mystical philosophy, especially that of the 13th-century poet and mystic Jalāl ad-Dīn ar-Rūmī. Like Rūmī, Yunus Emre became a leading representative of mysticism in Anatolia but on a more popular level; he was venerated as a saint after his death.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Poets and Poetic Form"
