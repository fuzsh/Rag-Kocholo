        "text": "Muaythai is built on the 5 important pillars of honour, tradition, respect, excellence and fair play. Every stakeholder, regardless of whether they are a fan, an official administrator, an event promoter, or simply a one-off spectator at an event, has the right to see transparency upheld.\n\nAt IFMA we are committed to ensuring our standards meet a high level of ethical accountability, because that is the foundation of our legitimacy as a governing body for the sport. Fair play must be guaranteed.\n\nWhen unlawful violations of IFMA’s standards occur, individuals may feel that there are barriers to voicing their concerns. Barriers can include, but are not limited to:\n\nUncertainty over who is responsible within the organisation for receiving and processing complaints;\n\nUncertainty by those reporting violations about whether their confidentiality will be protected;\n\nFear of reprisals by those reporting violations from those responsible for committing violations;\n\nConcerns about whether those reporting abuse (including verbal, mental, physical or sexual), will be treated with respect and sensitivity.\n\nHowever, without the active participation of those who can provide credible information regarding any unlawful violations of IFMA’s ethical standards, IFMA cannot adequately exercise its governing duties. Please help us as we continue to strive to meet the highest ethical standard among the world’s martial arts and combat sports.\n\nPlease report, regardless of whether a violation involves those in high positions of leadership, including within IFMA. Please inform yourselves of what IFMA’s ethical standards, codes and commitments are and report any type of violation that you observe, such as improper financial dealings, violations of the code of ethics, and allegations of discrimination, harassment or abuse.\n\nIFMA condemns all forms of discrimination, harassment, abuse and violence, especially against women, young boys and girls. We offer you our guarantee that individuals who report complaints or violations in good faith will not, as a result, be subject to retaliation or harassment from IFMA. Our continuous development as a sport and as a federation includes building a transparent and accountable community.\n\nAll allegations will be treated seriously and investigated. If you have evidence of a violation, please let us know about the specifics of the complaint with all relevant details. Our Ethics Committee will conduct a discreet and objective enquiry based on your complaint. The identity of those reporting violations will be kept confidential and treated as anonymous during the course of an investigation. We will contact you discreetly via email to request further information if required.\n\nIt is our hope that working together with you will ensure that everyone can enjoy the beauty of sport with fairness and equality."
