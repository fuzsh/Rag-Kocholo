        "text": "Key Points\n\nIsraeli society is displaying unprecedented unity during this war and has come together wiith extensive volunteer efforts and aid from various organizations.\n\nHeroic stories are emerging, including a journalist's rescue by his father and a retired couple's ordeal during a 20-hour Hamas hostage situation.\n\nThe war is impacting Israel's economy, with business limitations and ongoing challenges due to terrorist activity.\n\nArab Israelis struggle with the aftermath of the conflict, as questions on ethical considerations and the proportionality of Israel's response arise.\n\nInternational support for Israel escalates, with the US dispatching additional military aid, and European leaders expressing steadfast support for Israel.\n\nJewish Federations launched a $500 million campaign, offering aid and resources for those affected, while maintaining close collaboration with Israeli authorities and partners on the ground.\n\nToday is day 9 of Israel’s War with Hamas and this update takes a slightly different approach. In addition to the latest developments, today we will provide links and information focusing on more behind-the-scenes developments and areas, to give readers a better sense of the feeling in Israel.\n\nIsraeli Society\n\nIsraeli society has been galvanized by the war, leading to extraordinary giving and unity. See more in these links:\n\nIsraelis are united as never before\n\nIsraeli artists give their all to console, entertain amid Hamas war\n\nLegendary show Zehu Ze reunites for war effort\n\nHow Israeli teens can help\n\nSee this ad from Israel’s largest bank, as an example of how commercial entities are supporting the public.\n\nJewish Federation partners are also involved in numerous volunteer efforts, including:Many Jewish Agency Masa Fellows are participating in volunteer activities, including assembling food packages, babysitting, conducting deliveries and more.\n\nKids studying at a vocational school supported by are helping survivors in the south. Students in the carpentry track created locks for safe spaces in apartments, to enhance their protection, while others in the culinary track prepared hot meals for families in the South.\n\nAlso, JDC converted an employment center in the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak into a volunteer hub. So far, 500 Haredi volunteers have signed up and are staffing call centers, visiting elderly, and supporting community services. JDC aims to replicate this model in similar centers throughout Israel.\n\nAcross Israel, hundreds of thousands of citizens are taking part in a multitude of activities to assist soldiers, those evacuated from the south, and others in need. A few, almost random examples:In the ultra-Orthodox city of Elad, youth are making 3,000 sandwiches a day for soldiers at a nearby IDF base.\n\nIn this writer’s street in a city in the center of the country, a call went out on Saturday night from a resident who explained that her son was returning from the Gaza Front for just twelve hours bringing uniforms, socks and underwear from many soldiers in his unit. Dozens of families immediately volunteered to do laundry and he headed back to the front with clean clothes for the whole unit.\n\nThere are endless stories of soldiers entering restaurants, falafel stands and countless other businesses being told, “their money is no good here” with products and services being provided for free.\n\nMakeshift donation centers have sprung up in shopping malls, parking lots, and multiple other venues. Tens of thousands of Israelis are bringing food, clothing, personal hygiene items, home-baked cakes and cookies to these hubs so other volunteers can get them to soldiers at the front.\n\nStories of Heroes\n\nEvery day, we are learning more details, particularly about the events on the first day of the war, and with them countless stories are emerging of heroism, sometimes from unlikely places. See a collection here.\n\nHaaretz journalist Amir Tibon was rescued from the fighting by his 62-year old father, a retired major-general. See here for more on the story, and here for Amir Tibon’s own retelling.\n\nRead here the account of journalist Nir Gontarz who traveled south to save his son at the Rave attacked by Hamas gunmen.\n\nOne of the stories that has captured many Israelis’ attention has been that of Rachel and David Edri, a retired couple, held hostage in their home by Hamas for 20 hours. Rachel “bought time” until rescue forces could arrive by, among other methods, cooking food for the terrorists. See more, including video footage, here.\n\nThe Economic Impact of War\n\nConflict of this scale has, by definition, a significant impact on both the Israeli and the global economy. With so many reservists called up, key employees are out of pocket in many firms and businesses, and the Home Front Command has imposed restrictions on hours of operation for shopping malls and many other venues. Read below for more insight on this aspect of the war.\n\nHow has the war impacted Israel’s economy so far?\n\nTerrorists stole credit cards from their Israeli victims\n\nIsraeli fintech experts mobilize to thwart financial transfers to Hamas\n\nArab Israelis\n\nArab Israelis face unique questions any time there is an escalation. The barbarism and horrific nature of the October 7th attack, has left many struggling. Read more here:\n\nIsrael’s Arab citizens torn\n\nJews and Arabs join forces to help war victims and prevent riots\n\nParamedic Awad Darawshe, 23: Killed treating wounded at rave massacre\n\nEthical Questions\n\nA number of ethical questions have arisen in connection with Israeli’s retaliation for the attacks of October 7th and as this conflict continues, we can anticipate that additional issues will come up. Here are 3 examples.\n\nShould Israeli hospitals refuse medical treatment to Hamas terrorists?\n\nCutting off electricity and water to Gaza: Ethical or excessive?\n\nMany are discussing the issue of “proportionality” in Israel’s response. See here for a discussion, from British television that includes a forceful response as to why the call for “proportionality” is baseless.\n\nIn the international community, many are asking questions about Israel’s action. Below are two questions, and suggested answers:\n\nQuestion: Are Palestinian civilians being targeted by Israel?\n\nAnswer: Israel was attacked by one of the most barbaric, immoral, inhuman organizations that the world has ever known - one that vows to wipe the entire country off the face of the earth. Hamas is a group that purposely targets civilians with documented plans to commit horrific atrocities. These plans were implemented and included beheadings, burning people alive, killing dozens of babies, raping women, taking Holocaust survivors and others as captives. This evil organization was elected by the people of Gaza.\n\nNonetheless, Israel is a humane, law-abiding country, and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reflect those values. Despite the terrible crimes committed, and the unprecedented threats against the Jewish state, Israel is NOT targeting civilians, and is even warning Palestinians before it strikes Hamas’ terror and military targets; losing the element of surprise as the price it must pay for keeping Gazan non-combatants out of harm's way.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly warned Gaza’s civilian population to evacuate certain areas to avoid being caught in the violence. Cynically, disturbingly, and once again demonstrating their complete disregard for human life and civilian populations, Hamas has ordered residents not to leave and to stay in place, despite the warnings that Israel has given, potentially condemning some of their own people to die. And now, evidence has emerged of Hamas blocking the safe corridors created by Israel, forcing their own civilian population to remain in the fighting zone and become human shields and propaganda pawns.\n\nQuestion: Why is Israel cutting off electricity and other supplies to Gaza?\n\nAnswer: Hamas, elected by the people of Gaza, is the authority in charge of the Strip, and responsible for the well-being of its citizens. If the hostages are released, Israel has said that it will immediately resume electricity and other supplies, even though, in the past, the regime has diverted large quantities of provisions and aid for military and terror purposes, while its wealthy leadership has squandered urgent resources for themselves.\n\nFor example, we have seen again and again that emergency supplies of much-needed diesel fuel (used to power generators for hospitals, among other purposes) has been redirected to Hamas’ rocket program and other military uses. It should also be noted that in regular times, Israel only supplies 10% of Gaza’s water and 50% of its electricity (a further 25% comes from solar power, and the rest from Egypt and other sources).\n\nIn short:\n\nIsrael is fighting an unprecedented war against a barbaric enemy that has committed horrific atrocities not seen since the Holocaust.\n\nHamas was elected by the people of Gaza and is responsible for their welfare.\n\nHamas purposely targets civilians and continues to do so.\n\nIsrael does not, and will not, target non-combatants, and gives warning to civilians before attacks.\n\nIsrael will resume supplies to Gaza if Hamas releases the 126+ hostages it abducted including young children, women and many elderly civilians; even though it is well-known that Hamas will almost certainly redirect those resources for military purposes.\n\nPhilanthropic Responses from North America and Israel\n\nJewish Federations are raising funds at lightning speed for urgent needs in Israel towards our $500 million goal.\n\nBusiness magnate Mike Bloomberg has committed to matching all donations to Magen David Adom. As of Wednesday, Bloomberg had matched $7.5m in new gifts.\n\nSee more on North American philanthropy for Israel during the war, here.\n\nIsraeli philanthropist Ofer Yannay has established a Help Center for IDF soldiers, and also launched a campaign to raise national spirits, including full page ads in all of the country’s weekend newspapers with the slogan, “Am Yisrael will win.”\n\nThe Home Front\n\nFunerals took place across Israel, as the country continues to bury its dead. Professor Erdan Segal of the Weizmann Institute published data showing that last week’s massacre was the deadliest terror attack anywhere in the world proportionate to the size of the country. Per millions of citizens, the attack was at least thirteen times as deadly as the attacks of 9/11. See here for an account of those involved in the grim task of identifying victims.\n\nAt least 265 families have now been notified officially of the death of family members. Tragically, there are still over a thousand victims awaiting final identification and burial. This process is extremely difficult due to the fact that bodies have been badly mutilated, beheaded and burned beyond recognition. Forensic teams are working hard to identify them using DNA or dental records. In addition, some 120 families have been notified of the positive identification of their loved ones as hostages in the hands of Hamas.\n\nSee here for a list of the names of those murdered that have been released so far, and here for a site in Hebrew with the names and photos of fallen soldiers.\n\nView dramatic footage here from an IDF helicopter involved in rescuing injured soldiers during the initial fighting last Saturday.\n\nTwo-thirds of the residents of the city of Sderot in the south have already left their homes, and the remaining third have been urged by the IDF to leave today ahead of an expected ground war.\n\nRocket fire has slowed considerably, but has been punctured by barrages, including to Tel Aviv and other locations in the center of the country. See here for video of the impact of a rocket that fell in the town of Bat Yam, just outside of Tel Aviv yesterday.\n\nWhile schools and most businesses in Israel are shuttered, there are some signs that elements of normalcy may be returning. The Ministry of Education has announced that commencing Monday, there will be a gradual return to in-person schooling, in safer areas. Meanwhile the Ministry of Health announced that non-elective surgeries would recommence in areas not directly affected by the fighting. A large area around the Gaza Strip remains a closed military zone, to which entry by civilians is prohibited. See map here. Last night, the area within 4 kilometers of the northern border was also closed to all but residents, who were ordered to remain in close proximity to shelters and safe rooms.\n\nIsraeli Reponse\n\nOn Saturday, a small group of Israeli ground forces briefly entered the Gaza Strip. Based on precise intelligence information, they recovered the bodies of an undisclosed number of Israelis who had been captured by Hamas during last week’s incursion.\n\nIsraeli forces appear to be poised for a ground invasion of Gaza. See video here of troop preparations underway, and photos here.\n\nFollowing the IDF warning issued to Gazan civilians to evacuate the north of the Strip, Israel estimates that more than 600,000 of the area’s one million residents have left their homes. Israel opened three “humanitarian corridors” to provide safe passage for civilians. Sadly, and cynically, Hamas has placed roadblocks on these two routes, to stop civilians from leaving the area. See video images of Hamas road blocks here, and still photos here. At one point, Hamas announced that Israel never issued a call for Gazans to leave, prompting IDF Spokesman Daniel Hagari to appear on Al Jazeera TV where he told Gazans to leave the area immediately, in his own voice.\n\nWhile a full-scale escalation has not erupted in the north, Hezbollah continues to provoke Israel. Yesterday and today, the terror group fired mortar shells and rockets into Israeli territory as well as multiple anti-tank rockets at IDF positions near the border. The IDF retaliated with artillery fire towards the source of fire in Lebanon. In addition, rockets were fired at Israel from Syria today. Israeli media have described the attacks in the north as “more a show of solidarity with Hamas than an actual intent to enter the war.” Nonetheless, the frequency of attacks in the north appears to be increasing.\n\nOvernight, the IDF carried out ongoing airstrikes against hundreds of Hamas targets in Gaza. Among the targets were terror tunnels, multi-story buildings housing Hamas assets, military compounds, residences of senior Hamas members used as military command centers, weapons storage warehouses, and communications rooms.\n\nAccording to Hamas sources, some 2,329 Palestinians – many of them Hamas representatives – have been killed in Israeli strikes, in addition to the 1,500 terrorists killed during the initial invasion into Israel on Saturday.\n\nFollowing the formation of the national unity government in Israel, the Likud party announced that Yisrael Beitenu Party chair Avigdor Liberman, a former minister of defense, would also join the emergency government. This has not yet been confirmed by Liberman.\n\nInternational Response\n\nOn Saturday night, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to US President Joe Biden for the fifth time since fighting began. The Prime Minister updated the President on latest developments, and the President reiterated the United States’ firm backing of Israel in the current war. The US has now dispatched a second aircraft carrier, the USS Eisenhower along with its entire carrier group to further bolster Israel in this dark hour; and the United Kingdom is also sending an aircraft carrier.\n\nThe Prime Minister also spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis today. The European leaders expressed their unswerving support for Israel.\n\nA bipartisan delegation of United States senators led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer arrived in Israel earlier today and have met with President Isaac Herzog and other leaders.\n\nKey Points\n\nMore than 1,300 Israelis killed, including at least 220 soldiers, 22 US citizens and 2 Canadians\n\nSome 3,300 Israelis wounded, including 350 in serious condition\n\nOver 6,000 rockets fired at Israel\n\nAn estimated 150 Israelis being held hostage in Gaza\n\nFor those looking for help, critical information about the situation on the ground, or other assistance, see this resource page put together by Jewish Federations.\n\nSee also this Jewish Federations update on requests for personal protective equipment which are circulating.\n\nOn Day 6 of Israel’s war with Hamas the casualty rate has again risen, reaching 1300 Israelis killed.\n\nIn a massive display of unity with Israel, Jewish Federations have held (or are planning) some 120 solidarity gatherings in communities across North America, as part of an unprecedented effort to support Israel. See here for more.\n\nThe Home Front\n\nFunerals took place across Israel yesterday, with many more scheduled for today as the country begins the heart-wrenching task of burying its dead. With such large numbers, many are attending multiple funerals and the IDF rabbinate, burial societies and others are working around the clock to enable an honorable funeral for every victim.\n\nOne of the fallen was Bruna Valeanu, a 24-year-old Brazilian-Israeli who was murdered at the Rave. Only Bruna’s mother and sister live in Israel and they were concerned that there would not be a minyan (prayer quorum) at the funeral. A message was sent out on social media asking for volunteers to ensure that wouldn’t happen. Instead of the 10 that they sought, an astonishing 10,000 people showed up for the funeral in Petach Tikva last night.\n\nSee here for a list of the names of those murdered that have been released so far, and here for a site in Hebrew with the names and photos of fallen soldiers.\n\nMost people from the towns around Gaza have been evacuated, leaving authorities continuing the grim task of collecting bodies, and surveying the severe damage. In some kibbutzim and towns, large portions of the population have been murdered and most houses, cars and other property destroyed. In some cases, it remains unclear whether the towns or kibbutzim will be rebuilt at all. Among other items, in Kibbutz Sufa, Hamas fighters left behind an ISIS flag (see photo here). At the same time, tales of heroism are emerging from the first day of fighting. Read some inspiring stories here.\n\nRocket fire continues across the country but has slowed considerably. Seven houses in Sderot were hit causing considerable damage and four people have been injured, two seriously. For ten hours last night, not a single rocket was fired. This could be because Hamas is “pacing itself,” preparing for a protracted battle with Israel, and trying to save supplies; but could also be due to IDF efforts fighting the terror group.\n\nAccording to the IDF, Hamas is showing signs of losing control, and its senior leadership may have lost communication with numerous commanders. Schools and most businesses are shuttered and a large area around the Gaza Strip remains a closed military zone, to which entry by civilians is prohibited. See map here.\n\nAt the request of the Home Front Command and the Chief Rabbinate of Israel: During the upcoming Shabbat, Channel 14 will broadcast a “Gal Shaket” to be used for the Shabbat-observant public. During Shabbat, Home Front Command personnel will be on the channel, and when necessary, they will deliver life-saving instructions. The rest of the time the channel will be in silent mode. The silent broadcast will also provide a solution to the hearing impaired, with text instructions provided simultaneously on the Idan Plus TV system. Under the guidance of the chief rabbis of Israel, the channel must be turned and left on from before Shabbat begins.\n\nSimilarly, Israeli carrier El Al, which does not fly on Shabbat, announced it would be operating special flights on Shabbat to carry the large number of IDF reservists who are trying to fly back to Israel to join their IDF units. The company, whose majority stake is owned by an ultra-Orthodox Jew, received authorization from a number of rabbis to fly on Shabbat this week.\n\nIsraeli Response\n\nWith 360,000 reserve soldiers called, in addition to the regular standing army, almost every family in Israel is directly connected to the fighting. See video footage here of reserve soldiers preparing for battle earlier today.\n\nSince Saturday, the IDF has already carried out strikes against more than 2,650 targets across the Gaza Strip. Overnight, attacks killed Muhammed Abu Shamala, a senior operative of Hamas’ naval forces whose house was used to store naval weapons; as well as Mustafa Shahin, a Hamas operative who filmed and broadcast the terror group’s murders in southern Israel on Saturday. See footage of IDF strikes overnight here.\n\nThe IDF is using videos posted on the internet of the murders, attacks and kidnappings, to identify perpetrators with the help of facial recognition technology.\n\nAccording to Hamas sources, some 1,200 Palestinians – most of them Hamas militants – have been killed in Israeli strikes, in addition to the 1,500 terrorists killed during the initial invasion into Israel on Saturday.\n\nIsrael’s Energy Minister Yisrael Katz confirmed that Israel will not reconnect Gaza’s electricity supply until the hostages held by Hamas are released. He stated, “Humanitarian aid to Gaza? No electrical switch will be turned on, no water pump will be opened and no fuel truck will enter until the Israeli abductees are returned home. Humanitarianism in exchange for humanitarianism. No one can preach morality to us.”\n\nWhile hopes remain high that a significant escalation on Israel’s northern border can be avoided, the IDF has considerably bolstered its forces across the region as a precautionary step. Early yesterday evening, there were reports of 15-20 manned paragliders crossing the border from Lebanon, sounding sirens across Israel’s north. While details around the event have not been released, the IDF confirms that there were no successful incursions.\n\nThe IDF maintains that there is no shortage of essential equipment for soldiers, although acknowledges some logistical challenges resulting from the unprecedented call-up and large number of reserve troops in active service (see photos here).\n\nToday, the IDF announced that it has already successfully:\n\nProvided hundreds of heavy weaponry units to IDF units.\n\nSupplied 24,000 tons of infrastructure materials (asphalt, gravel, and earthworks).\n\nEmployed over 60 construction companies to assist the IDF.\n\nEstablished 5 factories for the production of protective equipment.\n\nRented hundreds of generators.\n\nPrepared approximately 1,500 buses for transporting IDF soldiers, focused mainly on reserve forces.\n\nDelivered over 1,000 carriers, semi-trailers, trucks, and around 1,200 rental vehicles to combat forces.\n\nDistributed a wide variety of equipment including baby food to the residents of the city of Sderot.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and National Union Chair Benny Gantz formalized the national emergency government last night. Appearing together, the Prime Minister said:\n\n“Citizens of Israel, this evening we have formed a national emergency government. The people are united and today its leadership is also united. We have put aside every other consideration because the fate of our country is at stake. We will work together, shoulder to shoulder, for the citizens of Israel and for the State of Israel… I would like to stand by the soldiers, and the security service and rescue personnel, who are working around the clock in all sectors. The entire people of Israel are behind you. I say to you, citizens of Israel, to my colleagues here, and to all of you the words of the prophet Isaiah: 'They helped every one his neighbor; and every one said to his brother: 'Be of good courage.' The people of Israel live – and together we will win.”\n\nMinister Gantz added:\n\n“Our standing here, shoulder to shoulder, is a clear message to our enemies, and more importantly, a message to all citizens of Israel – we are all together, we are all mobilizing. Ours is not a political partnership but a shared fate. All citizens of Israel share a common fate, and together we will shape our fate and reality. At this time, we are all soldiers of the State of Israel. This is the time to come together and win. This is not the time for difficult questions, it is the time for crushing responses on the battlefield. I would like to turn to all citizens of Israel and tell them that the enemy will be destroyed, security will be restored the killing fields in which our heroes fell will be rebuilt and the entire State of Israel will flourish anew and be strengthened.”\n\nInternational Response\n\nLast night, a first shipment of equipment for the IDF from the US Government arrived in Israel and is already being deployed.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken landed in Israel on Thursday morning to express the solidarity of the United States with Israel. Among other meetings, he has met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and will meet with the families of American citizens abducted by Hamas. In their meeting, Netanyahu said to Secretary Blinken, “Just as ISIS was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed. And Hamas should be treated exactly the way ISIS was treated.”\n\nMeanwhile US President Joe Biden is said to be considering re-freezing the $6 billion dollars that was released in August for Iran.\n\nIsrael’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant met with 31 NATO defense ministers who were gathering in Brussels earlier today. Gallant spoke of the atrocities committed by Hamas against children, women, men and the elderly and told the assembled ministers, “We have been hit hard. Yet make no mistake – 2023 is not 1943. We are the same Jews, but we have different capabilities. The State of Israel is strong. We are united, and powerful.” Gallant also presented an unreleased and uncensored video of some of the horrific acts committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians and soldiers, as well as foreign nationals who were either kidnapped or killed.\n\nLast night, Israel’s President Isaac Herzog spoke with the United Kingdom’s King Charles III, who called to express his condolences and “deep shock at the criminal and barbaric actions of the terrorist organization Hamas in its attack on the citizens of Israel.”\n\nFederation Partners on the Ground\n\nThe Jewish Agency for Israel\n\nSome 40 more grants were distributed by the Jewish Agency’s Fund for the Victims of Terror yesterday, and more are expected to be distributed very soon.\n\nThe Agency has also convened a Roundtable with the National Emergency Forum to discuss bringing medical volunteers from overseas, including doctors and paramedical professionals.\n\nAt the same time, the Agency is preparing an evacuation plan for communities in the north should that become necessary.\n\nThe 1,480 olim who have been evacuated from Jewish Agency absorption centers in the South to safer locations elsewhere in Israel will remain on respite until at least Monday.\n\nThe Agency is also working on finding alternate flights for Olim that were scheduled to arrive and have had their flights cancelled. All new Olim are being given an information kit to help them on arrival.\n\nMasa participants are participating in volunteer activities, including assembling food packages, helping with babysitting, conducting deliveries, and more.\n\nAll participants in the Agency’s Haredi Mechina Program in Moshav Ora returned to their program yesterday, and some other Mechinot will resume by the end of the week.\n\nThe American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC):\n\nSome of JDC's response to the current situation in recent days included the following:\n\nA first group of 170 families at risk in the south of Israel were approved to receive vouchers for food, household items, toys and medicines. This assistance is aimed at helping recipients who were struggling financially before the crisis, make emergency purchases such as water, toys, and other supplies for shelters and safe rooms.\n\nJDC professionals visited centers throughout Israel, housing Holocaust survivors from the communities bordering the Gaza Strip, who were evacuated after the tragic attacks. JDC staff met with elderly Holocaust survivors to assess their needs and determine responses.\n\nYouth studying at a vocational school supported by JDC volunteered to use their skills to support survivors in the south of Israel. Students studying in the carpentry track created locks for safe spaces in apartments, to enhance their protection, and students studying in the culinary track prepared hot meals for families in the South.\n\nJDC, in collaboration with the Ministry of Labor, converted a JDC-initiated employment center in the Haredi city of Bnei Brak into a volunteer hub. So far 500 Haredi volunteers have signed up and are staffing call centers, visiting elderly, and supporting vital community services. JDC aims to replicate this model in other JDC-initiated employment centers throughout Israel.\n\nThe JDC cafeteria in Jerusalem has been repurposed to support the major relief efforts taking place in Israel. Professionals in our Israel office are volunteering their time to make food for forensic police officers working around the clock to identify the bodies of civilians and soldiers who fell victim to the recent terrible attack.\n\nThe Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) is providing daily in-depth and inside analysis, sponsored by Jewish Federations and the Jewish Agency. A rotating team of top analysts of Israeli military affairs, the US-Israel relationship, Israel’s political system and the country’s diverse society, will speak Sunday to Thursday, 11:00 - 11:30a.m. EDT by Zoom. Join here.\n\nFor those looking for opportunities to volunteer and assist Israel, please see this guide, prepared by Jewish Federations.\n\nJewish Federations issued a statement on the current fighting.\n\nOur Israel Office, having activated emergency protocols, is working closely with our partners on the ground, and is close contact with the Government of Israel and the IDF. We will continue to update as the situation develops."
