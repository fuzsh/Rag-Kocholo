They face Sevilla next at Anfield before visiting promoted Ipswich Town for their Premier League opener on Aug. 17.\n\nAsked if he was pleased with his side's performances so far, the Dutchman said: \"Yes, I was but not with all of them. We are very happy with the result, we scored some really nice goals ... very positive tour.\n\n\"But I don't think we had enough control over the game, I think we gave away too many chances. United deserved more than a 3-0 loss but it's also our quality that we do score our own chances.\n\n\"We will see how players (returning from holidays) fit into the team. We need to work hard in the upcoming two weeks to be ready.\""
