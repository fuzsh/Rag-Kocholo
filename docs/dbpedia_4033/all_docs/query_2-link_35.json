        "text": "More than 50 noted personalities from West Bengal wrote to Bangladesh president Mohammed Shahabuddin and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who took oath as the head of an interim government, urging them to ensure the safety of all sections of society.\n\nAmong the signatories of the letter were filmmaker Aparna Sen, educationist Pabitra Sarkar and former Supreme Court judge Ashok Ganguly.\n\nIn the letter, they voiced concern over the attack on minorities in Bangladesh, while hailing instances of one community protecting the places of worship of another community.\n\n- PTI\n\nA 17-member Bangladesh interim government under the leadership of Noble Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus took oath on Thursday (August 7, 2024), three days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted and fled the country.\n\nBangladesh President Mohammad Shahabuddin administered the oath to the 84-year-old chief adviser Prof. Yunus at 9.20 p.m., followed by the Cabinet members, at a ceremony attended by politicians including BNP leader Mirza Fakhrul Islam, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami leader Amir Shafiqur Rahman and Jatiya Party chairman Ghulam Muhammed Quader, diplomats from the U.K., Japan, China, Philippines, Iran, Argentina, Qatar, The Netherlands and the UAE, civil society figures and senior civil and military officials at Bangabhaban Presidential Palace. Prof. Yunus reached Bangabhaban at 8.45 p.m. No one from the Awami League was seen at Bangabhaban.\n\nNobel laureate Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh's interim government\n\nNoble Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus takes oath as chief adviser of the country’s interim government, three days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted and fled the country.\n\nNobel Peace Prize winning economist Muhammad Yunus takes over as the head of Bangladesh’s caretaker government at a time when the country is facing tough economic challenges.\n\nHere is a look at his economic beliefs:\n\nSocial businesses:\n\nYunus advocates “social businesses” that solve problems rather than simply create wealth, with any profit generated being ploughed back to create more value.\n\nGrameen Bank, the microfinance lender he founded, was rooted in this idea and lauded for helping to boost growth and alleviate poverty in Bangladesh.\n\nPoverty:\n\nYunus’ belief that poverty - which plagued more than 18% of Bangladesh’s population in 2022 - is a “threat” and causes problems ranging from terrorism to trafficking, informs most of his work.\n\nHe sought to inculcate “sound financial principles” in the poor through his microcredit system.\n\nGlobalisation:\n\nYunus has called for “multi-national social businesses” that either give the poor ownership or keep profits within poor countries.\n\nWhen he dabbled in politics in 2007, he suggested upgrading the Chittagong port to a continental seaport - a plan critics said could endanger national security, jobs and the environment.\n\nWomen:\n\nYunus emphasises the role of women in building the future and has been part of multiple international commissions catering to them.\n\nWomen currently outnumber men in Bangladesh and constitute 97% of Grameen Bank’s members.\n\n- Reuters\n\nBangladesh student leaders Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud to join the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, Reuters reports quoting Bangladeshi daily Prothom Alo.\n\n- Reuters\n\nSheikh Hasina, who quit as Prime Minister and fled Bangladesh, will be back in the country as soon as democracy is restored, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said today.\n\nHe blamed Pakistan’s intelligence agency, ISI, for fuelling the ongoing unrest in the country.\n\n- PTI\n\nSheikh Hasina will be back in Bangladesh once democracy is restored, Pak’s ISI fuelling unrest: Sajeeb Wazed Joy\n\nSajeeb Wazed Joy discusses Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh, blames Pakistan for unrest, and urges India's support for democracy.\n\nA BJP leader in Meghalaya has asked the State government to set up a camp to rehabilitate Garo, Khasi and other tribals living in Bangladesh who are victims of the political unrest.\n\nIn a letter to Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma today, BJP vice-president Bernard N. Marak requested setting up of a humanitarian camp to support these refugees if they are allowed to enter India.\n\nMarak stressed that these tribal groups should be provided with temporary shelter and support while ensuring that they are deported back to Bangladesh once the situation there improves.\n\nMarak, who is also a member of the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council, pointed out that the ongoing crisis in Bangladesh has led to significant loss of lives and heightened risks for those trying to crossing the border.\n\nHe proposed utilising the Mahari system in Garo Hills, which has a strong clan-based network, to aid in the identification, rehabilitation, and eventual deportation of the refugees. This system, he explained, could help in effectively managing the temporary rehabilitation of the displaced persons.\n\n- PTI\n\nTwo prominent Indian-American lawmakers called for an immediate end to the ongoing brutal violence against the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh following the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina-led government.\n\nThe Congressmen have also urged the Prime Minister-designate of the interim government, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, to uphold the rule of law as he takes over the reins of the interim government.\n\n“Bangladeshi students had just human rights concerns against PM Hasina. It’s good she is gone. But the violence now targeting Hindus is wrong. PM Yunus must uphold the rule of law & prevent the targeting of temples or people of any political party or faith from violence,” Ro Khanna, Congressman said today.\n\nCongressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said, “As Bangladesh prepares to swear in its interim government, I urge all government officials, the new administration and police chief, and the people of Bangladesh to do all they can to end the violence that has emerged across the country, including the brutal targeting of the country’s Hindu minority, their homes, businesses, and their temples.” “The violence must stop and those responsible must be brought to justice to help the people of Bangladesh move forward as a nation. I will continue to closely monitor developments in Bangladesh in coordination with the US State Department,” Krishnamoorthi said in a statement yesterday.\n\n- PTI\n\nIn response to a question on Indian participation in the swearing-in ceremony, in Dhaka, on Thursday evening (August 8, 2024), External Affairs Ministry’s spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the diplomatic community has been invited to the ceremony.\n\nAssam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma expressed confidence that the Centre will address the alleged attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh through diplomatic efforts.\n\nHe assured that while the Indian government is managing the situation with patience and caution, the focus remains on ensuring safety and maintaining strict vigilance along the Indo-Bangladesh border, which has been fully sealed.\n\n‘’The Indian government will deal with the situation politically and diplomatically with the new dispensation. We have been asked not to comment much on it but to be patient and tolerant’‘, the Chief Minister said on the sidelines of a programme in Guwahati.\n\n‘’The solution does not lie in allowing those trying to enter India following persecution in the neighbouring country but to ensure their safety and security there. There are various organisations like the UN and others to deal with the situation diplomatically,’‘ Mr. Sarma said. - PTI\n\nAIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi expressed concern over reports of minorities being attacked in Bangladesh and demanded that authorities in that country ensure their protection.\n\nIn a post on X, Mr. Owaisi said, “The reports of minorities being attacked in Bangladesh are concerning. The government and authorities of Bangladesh have a duty under international law to protect the life, limb and property of minorities.” There are also reports that many from the country’s majority community are protecting homes and places of worship of the minority communities, he noted, adding, “This should be the norm.” - PTI\n\n“India has taken note of the steps by various groups in Bangladesh for protection of minorities in Bangladesh but remains deeply concerned about the situation. Every government is responsible for the well-being of its citizens,” External Affairs Ministry’s spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.\n\nIn response to a question on Sheikh Hasina’s asylum plans, Mr. Jaiswal said, “It’s for her to take things forward. I have no update about her plans.”\n\n“We are in touch with the Bangladesh officials for safety and security of the personnel in the Indian missions (High Commission and Assistant High Commissions),” Mr. Jaiswal said.\n\n“We are closely analysing all aspects of the recent developments in Bangladesh,” Mr. Jaiswal said in response to a question on involvement of ‘foreign hand’.\n\nThe Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) appealed to the Centre to protect Hindus in violence-hit Bangladesh amid the unrest there, and ensure “jihadis” under the garb of refugees do not sneak into India from there.\n\n“We request the Centre to take all possible steps to protect Hindus in Bangladesh who are being persecuted and their houses and places of worship being vandalised. We demand from the Centre to protect Hindus who are the soft target in the neighbouring country,” VHP Madhya Bharat prant mantri (secretary) Rajesh Jain said.\n\n“The Centre should also ensure that jihadis under the garb of refugees from that nation don’t sneak through our border with nefarious design. Each and every activist of the VHP and Bajrang Dal is ready to stand by the Army and the Border Security Force to guard the borders with Bangladesh,” he said.\n\n“If the Centre asks us, we are ready to lend support to the security forces on borders with the trouble-torn Bangladesh,” Mr. Jain said. - PTI\n\n“The Meghalaya government has temporarily suspended business operations at the border haats along the International Border with Bangladesh due to the volatile situation in that country,” officials said.\n\n“The Border Security Force (BSF) and the State police have shared intelligence inputs suggesting a high likelihood of cross-border movements by Bangladesh nationals, outlawed militant groups, smugglers, and other unauthorised activities if border haats are reopened,” officials added.\n\nCurrently, there are two border haats - one at Balat in East Khasi Hills district and another at Kalaichar in South West Garo Hills district. Several other haats are operational but have not yet been fully activated.\n\nA senior government official said, “The government has decided to temporarily suspend business operations at the border haats until the situation in Bangladesh stabilises.” This decision follows inputs from the BSF and State police. - PTI\n\nMuhammad Yunus promised to deliver a government which assures safety to its citizens, as the Nobel laureate returned to the protest-torn Bangladesh from Paris to take oath as the head of the interim government following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina.\n\nMr. Yunus was in Paris for the Olympic Games. He returned to the country via Dubai. An Emirates flight (EK-582) carrying Mr. Yunus landed at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 2.10 p.m. local time. Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, senior officials, student leaders and civil society members welcomed him at the airport.\n\nAt an emotional press conference at the airport, Mr. Yunus expressed gratitude to the youth who made the protest movement against Ms. Hasina successful. “We have got independence for the second time. We have to protect this independence,” he said.\n\n“The nation is in your hands now. Now you have to rebuild it as per your aspirations. You have to use your creativity to build the country. You have earned independence for the country,” he said. - PTI\n\nTwo leaders from Hasina’s Awami League were detained by the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) at the Darshana ICP check post in Chuadanga while attempting to flee the country.\n\nRajshahi City Corporation Ward Councillor and Rajshahi Metropolitan Awami League General Secretary Rajab Ali along with his associate Zakir Hossain were detained by the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) at the Darshana ICP check post in Chuadanga while attempting to flee the country.\n\nBGB personnel became suspicious when the two attempted to cross into India on Wednesday morning. They were detained and interrogated, during which they admitted to fleeing the country. - PTI\n\nAt least 232 people were killed in Bangladesh in the incidents of violence that erupted across the country following the fall of the government led by Sheikh Hasina on August 5, 2024, according to a media report, taking the death toll to 560 since the anti-quota protests first started in mid-July.\n\nMs. Hasina resigned as Prime Minister and fled the country after weeks of tumultuous student protests against her regime. A total of 232 were reported dead as of Wednesday evening (August 7, 2024) since Hasina’s ouster, Prothom Alo newspaper reported.\n\nBefore this, some 328 persons were killed in the clashes centring a movement around the quota system in government jobs from July 16 to August 4. In all, some 560 people died over the last 23 days. Some 21 more persons were killed as of August 7, 2024. Most of the 232 people died on Tuesday. Some of them died while undergoing treatment. - PTI\n\nSeveral residents across Bangladesh spent a sleepless night as they gathered in groups to guard the streets amid fears of robbery and looting by criminals in the violence-hit country, where an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus is all set to take oath on Thursday (August 8, 2024).\n\nSecurity concerns have gripped the country since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ouster on Monday as police observed a work abstention, citing fears for their safety amid reports of deadly attacks on security personnel.\n\nThe Yunus-led interim government – appointed by President Mohammed Shahabuddin who had dissolved the parliament - is set to take oath in the evening after weeks of tumultuous student protests that forced Hasina to resign and flee the country.\n\nClick here to read more...\n\nHundreds of Hindus in Bangladesh were gathered along the Indian border hoping to cross, security officials said Thursday, days after a student-led uprising toppled prime minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nSome businesses and homes owned by Hindus were attacked following Ms. Hasina’s ousting, and the group is seen by some in Muslim-majority Bangladesh as having been close to her.\n\n“Several hundred Bangladeshi nationals, mostly Hindus, gathered at different points along India’s border with Bangladesh,” Amit Kumar Tyagi, India’s Border Security Force (BSF) deputy inspector general, told AFP.\n\nBangladesh’s next leader Muhammad Yunus was heading home from an overseas trip to take office later on Thursday after imploring people to stay calm and be ready to rebuild the country after an uprising that ended the 16-year, increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nBefore leaving Paris, where he had been attending the Olympics, Mr. Yunus appealed for calm in Bangladesh amid tensions over the country’s future. Bangladesh’s military chief will welcome Mr. Yunus when he lands at Dhaka’s main international airport on Thursday afternoon.\n\nFormer Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s daughter Saima Wazed on Thursday said she was “heartbroken” by the loss of lives in her country and that she could not “see or hug” her mother during such a difficult time.\n\nMs. Hasina resigned as prime minister and travelled to India on Monday following unprecedented anti-government protests.\n\n“Heartbroken with the loss of life in my country Bangladesh that I love. So heartbroken that I cannot see and hug my mother during this difficult time. I remain committed to my role as RD,” Ms. Wazed said in a post on X.\n\nThe situation in the country is yet to normalise. Vandalism and looting persisted in some areas, with security forces struggling to stabilise the unrest. Key Ministry and department secretaries have stopped attending office, causing a near standstill in the functioning of the Bangladesh Secretariat. Many officials and employees affiliated to the Awami League have been absent. Numerous influential officials have gone into hiding, switching off their phones and cutting off communication with their offices, leaving their subordinates without guidance. This has led to a breakdown in the chain of command.\n\nIn the absence of traffic police on duty, students and volunteers were seen managing traffic in various parts of the capital and other districts on Wednesday as well. The capital city of Dhaka continued to see rallies by different political groups.\n\n- Rabiul Alam\n\nIn her first public speech since 2018, Ms. Zia, who joined the BNP rally virtually, thanked the people for their “fight and prayers” and called for “love and peace” to rebuild the country, instead of “destruction and revenge”.\n\n“Youth are our future. We need to build a democratic Bangladesh newly to fulfil their dream, and for which they shed their blood.,” said Ms. Zia. “No destruction, no anger and no revenge, we need love and peace to rebuild our country.”\n\nThe Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main Opposition party when former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was in power, held a rally at Naya Paltan in Dhaka, where thousands of people gathered from different parts of the country.\n\nAddressing the rally virtually from London, Tarique Rahman, BNP acting chairman and son of former Prime Minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, called for immediate election in the country. “The national election must be held immediately, and power must be handed over to the elected representatives,” he said.\n\nBNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said election should be held within three months.\n\nThe United States Wednesday said it is ready to work with the interim government of Bangladesh as the country charts a democratic future for its people.\n\n“We continue to monitor developments in Bangladesh, and we obviously have seen the appointment of Muhammad Yunus as the leader of an interim government,” State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters at his daily news conference.\n\n“We think the interim government will play a vital role in establishing long-term peace and political stability in Bangladesh,” Mr. Miller said responding to questions on the fast-moving development in Bangladesh. - PTI\n\nAn interim government headed by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus will take oath in Bangladesh at 8 p.m. on Thursday (April 8, 2024), Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said at a press conference on Wednesday (August 7, 2023).\n\nThe 84-year-old microfinance pioneer will arrive at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on an Emirates flight from Dubai on Thursday (August 8, 2024) afternoon, the Yunus Center said in a press release.\n\nMr. Yunus asked the youth to be calm and get ready to build the country. “I congratulate the brave students who took the lead in making our ‘Second Victory Day’ possible and to the people for giving your total support to them. Let us make the best use of our new victory. Let us not let this slip away because of our mistakes,” he said in the statement.\n\n​Click here to read more...​\n\nThe end of the Sheikh Hasina government should not be perceived as a mortal blow to India-Bangladesh relations, according to leading figures in Dhaka’s policy-making circles, who argued that the interim government would place a high priority on bilateral ties as it is in the interest of various sectors in Bangladesh to maintain a good relationship with New Delhi.\n\n“There is an important and urgent need for the Indian government to acknowledge that a people’s revolution has taken place. People’s aspirations and people’s voice must be heard. India must signal that it stands with the people of Bangladesh,” Shafqat Munir of the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies told The Hindu, arguing that “no government, interim or elected, would want to pursue policies against India”.\n\n​Click here to read full story...​"
