        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIndia broke a 52-year streak at the Olympics by defeating Australia 3-2 in hockey, with Harmanpreet Singh scoring twice. Goalkeeper PR Sreejesh's performance was pivotal. Under coach Craig Fulton, the team demonstrated superior fitness and mental strength, aided by mental coach Paddy Upton. India's next challenge is the quarterfinals.\n\nThe jinx is broken. India finally beat Australia at the Olympic Games in hockey after 52 years – the last win coming at Munich 1972. Skipper Harmanpreet Singh led from the front with two goals as India won 3-2 on Friday, giving themselves a huge boost ahead of the quarterfinals on Sunday. Goalkeeper PR Sreejesh, who is set to retire after the Paris Games, brought the memories of Tokyo Olympics back in the way he guarded the goal. He was the wall that the Australians found tough to breach throughout the game. Harmanpreet, who has been in rich form in Paris – 6 out of India’s 10 goals – and has scored some crucial goals for his team, was leader par excellence against Australia. First he doubled India’s lead in the first quarter.\n\nThen, just when the Australians struck back in the second quarter and sought an equaliser, Harmanpreet restored India’s two-goal advantage. Under coach Craig Fulton, India are one of the fittest teams in the competition and that’s what showed in this encounter. “Fitness is not just physical. It is also mental. If you aren’t fit enough, you will lose focus in the last few minutes and that’s when India has conceded goals in the past. That’s what we wanted to change and that’s what the coach has repeatedly stressed on,” said Harmanpreet.\n\nThe Indians are also mentally stronger. With mental coach Paddy Upton helping the players to deal with pressure, the impact is showing in the team’s performances. Though India lost their previous match against Belgium despite taking the lead, they have been competitive throughout. At the time of writing, India’s opponents in the quarterfinal aren’t decided. But in this form, they wouldn’t mind anyone. Beating Australia will give them the belief that they can beat any team, having finished second in the group.\n\nThe one thing that has stood out is India’s defensive shape under pressure. Australia needed just one goal to equalise and there were still seven minutes left in the game. It was a period of intense pressure. That’s when unwanted mistakes usually happen and all the good work done in the match is lost. Not this team. For them the game isn’t over till it is over.\n\nCan India repeat Tokyo? Amit Rohidas, the first rusher who is key to India’s chances, answered it nicely, “We are ready to die if need be but we will not leave an inch to any team. We have come here to do well and one thing that we can promise everyone is there will be no dearth of effort.” Fulton understands the importance of the medal and doesn’t want his team to think too far ahead. The job is just half done and with the quarterfinals, a new tournament will start. Now, a single mistake can be fatal to the team’s chances.\n\nHarmanpreet clearly remembers the sinking feeling after early exit from the 2023 World Cup in Bhubaneswar. He doesn’t want to go through that feeling again. And with it being Sreejesh’s left dance, it’s a chance for the team to do it for him. “Let’s trust the process. Whatever happens I won’t let them score. It is for India. No one can change that,” Sreejesh said.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.
