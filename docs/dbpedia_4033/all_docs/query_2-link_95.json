        "text": "🌍✨ How the Poorest Part of France Became the “Beating Heart” of the Olympics! 🥇🏗️ Did you know that the true legacy of the Olympics often lies beyond the glamorous host city? 🤔 The heart of the upcoming Paris Games beats in its lesser-known regions, showcasing resilience and innovation. In a world where we often overlook the underprivileged, this transformation is a powerful reminder of the potential within every community. 💪🏽 The investment in infrastructure, sports facilities, and local economies is not just about the Games; it's about uplifting lives and creating lasting change. As a mechanical engineer and entrepreneur, I see parallels in my mission with Bright Start Solar: harnessing data and engineering to empower communities. 🌞💡 Just like the Olympic legacy, solar energy can transform lives, save money, and promote sustainability. What can we learn from this? Are we investing in the right places to create a brighter future for all? 👍 or 👎? Share your thoughts below! #Olympics #Paris2024 #CommunityImpact #Sustainability #BrightStartSolar #Empowerment #Innovation #SolarEnergy #MechanicalEngineering #Entrepreneurship #ChangeMakers\n\nAs a part of its recomemdations under 2020 + 5 Olympic Agenda, the IOC has set itself a challenge of “change or be changed”. One of the biggest ways, this change is evident is in the legacy an Olympic Games will leave behind in its host city. As a part of the 2020 + 5 Agenda, no host city will be required to build new permanent venues and can host events at venues outside the city. The Agenda also encourages hosts to foster a sustainable games by aligning plans to the long term local needs of the hosts. In keeping with this spirit, Paris, this year’s host of the Summer Games, is hoping to create housing that will provide sustainable and affordable housing to Parisians once the athletes and parathletes head back, thanks to the 3,000 apartments that will be created. Find out more here: https://lnkd.in/gQbsYp3Y Meanwhile, the 2016 host city, Rio de Janeiro, is converting its erstwhile sporting venues to schools and public parks being used by thousands of children and citizens in the Brazilian city. Read more here: https://lnkd.in/gjtaWPY3 Likewise, Milan Cortina, host of the 2026 Winter Games and Los Angeles, the host of the 2028 Summer Games will truly embrace this philosophy by building no new Olympic venues. As India looks at a bid for the Summer Games of 2036, it will be critical to think of a legacy program for all the world class infrastructure we’re creating. With stadia already being built in the likely candidate city of Ahmedabad, the long term and multi-use principle will be core to the design. This will also be critical to our goal of building a sporting culture in India. We must create more sustainable employment and livelihood in sport outside the field of play . Allied areas such as infrastructure development to facilities management to equipment manufacturing will all be critical in helping us shine the sporting talent that is beginning to emerge on the global stage. And an Olympic Games legacy plan will go a long way in sustaining and encouraging livelihoods in sport. And if you have any thoughts on the areas outside the sporting arenas that we need to develop to drive sporting development in India, please share your comments below.\n\nReflecting on the recent article by The Guardian, \"Sport is never just sport: Olympics exhibition in Paris reflects 20th century’s highs and lows,\" I am reminded of the vast canvas upon which the Olympic Games paint the story of our shared humanity. From the shadows of the 1936 Berlin Games to the powerful podium protest in Mexico City 1968, the Olympics have been a stage for not just athletic prowess but pivotal moments of social and geopolitical significance. As we look towards the Paris Olympics, set against the backdrop of today’s global challenges, it’s clear that the spirit of the Games continues to evolve, embodying both the triumphs and trials of our times. The upcoming exhibition in Paris, \"Olympic Games: Mirror of Our Societies,\" is a testament to the enduring power of sport to reflect, and sometimes challenge, the currents of our world. It delves into the original pacifist intentions of the Games while unflinchingly examining their use as platforms for propaganda, and venues for voicing the pressing issues of race discrimination, sexism, and more. As someone deeply ingrained in the fabric of the Olympic movement, I am heartened by the exhibition’s aim to trace the complex narratives of the Games, reminding us that through sport, we engage in a broader dialogue about our values, our struggles, and our aspirations for peace and inclusivity. The Olympic flame, relayed from Greece to each host nation, symbolizes not just a tradition of competition but a journey towards understanding and tolerance. This article and the exhibition it describes reinforce the belief that the Olympic Games are much more than a series of sports events; they are a mirror to society, reflecting our collective journey through the 20th century and beyond. I am eager for the Paris Games to carry forward this legacy, showcasing the best of humanity in pursuit of excellence, unity, and global understanding. 👉 Article link: https://lnkd.in/d3RwXdgW #OlympicLegacy #Paris2024 #MirrorOfSociety #SportForChange\n\n𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐚 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐫𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐛𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 2036 𝐎𝐥𝐲𝐦𝐩𝐢𝐜𝐬! With the Paris Olympics in full swing, the world's eyes are once again on the greatest sporting spectacle. With more than 10,000 athletes from 206 different countries scheduled to take part in this year's Olympic Games, it's expected that it will boost the economy and tourism in France, i.e. the host country. Look at the chart of the cost and the revenue generated from the Summer Olympics being hosted by different countries. In 2021, Brisbane, Australia, the 2032 Summer Games’ host, became the first city to win an Olympic bid 𝐮𝐧𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐝. Does this indicate the unattractive returns that the multi-sport extravaganza generates? Hence, no country is willing to bid and host the event? But, apart from the economic point of view, it does have many social benefits: - The Olympics increases the host country's global trade and stature - The Games generate awareness about different sports. - The Olympics often leads to the construction of new sports facilities, transportation systems, and other public infrastructure. - Many Olympic projects focus on addressing social issues, such as poverty, education, and healthcare What do you think after hosting the 𝐂𝐖𝐆 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬, 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐢𝐧 2010, is India ready to bid and host the 2036 Summer Olympic Games? #olympics #india #paris\n\nReflecting on the recent article by The Guardian, \"Sport is never just sport: Olympics exhibition in Paris reflects 20th century’s highs and lows,\" I am reminded of the vast canvas upon which the Olympic Games paint the story of our shared humanity.

This edition of the Games aims first of all to align itself with the main trends in #society and the #economy concerning issues of #sustainability, #genderequality, #inclusion, attention to the involvement of new generations, and in general a positive long-term legacy In our aspirations to host 2036 Olympics, we as a nation, must clearly understand and align to Olympic movement. (https://lnkd.in/gXApkGur) Through our efforts at #ABFT we are working with the states of #Odisha and #Assam to take Olympic Values Education Program (#OVEP) to million of #schools #students so as to create a clear understanding and connection of Olympics to future generations. More and more efforts are required by multiple stakeholders in this direction https://lnkd.in/gyp74BYR\n\n🏅 The Olympics are almost here! With just a few days to go until Paris 2024, we’re not just facing sporting challenges in the City of Light, but also a major economic test: can the host city make a profit from such a massive event? Since Athens 2004, fewer cities have wanted to host the Olympics due to the high costs of infrastructure needed for athletes and spectators. The International Olympic Committee is optimistic about Paris 2024’s financing model, boldly claiming: “The Games fund themselves.” In 2022, they revealed that 96% of the €4.4 billion budget for organizing the Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics comes from the private sector. Will this model be a success? Only time will tell! 🌟 - - - - - #sports #olympics #paris2024 #economicimpact #privatesector #capitalism #globalgames #cityoflight #privatization"
