        "text": "Tony Estanguet pointed out that “We are emerging from this crisis stronger, and are determined to deliver the Games with the Social and Solidarity Economy sector.”\n\nThe SSE bridges the gaps between economic and social goals, is all about people and is eminently flexible. So it has a lot in common with [Paris 2024](Story: integrating-the-social-and-solidarity-economy /en/paris-2024/our-commitments/taking-part/social-solidarity-economy) and is at the core of the project. Professor Yunus underlined the fact that the SSE “creates business that solves problems, not that creates new ones.”\n\nSSE organisations were on the front line pushing back against the epidemic. Some managed to adapt and provide emergency relief, for example by making masks, reaching out to people in vulnerable circumstances and helping out in the places that were hit the hardest. But most of them have suffered from the economic and social downturn: over 60% of non-profits are at a standstill today.\n\nThe budget for the Games amounts to €5 billion (Paris 2024 + SOLIDEO). So now even more than before, Paris 2024 represents an opportunity to stimulate a number of economic sectors and open up possibilities for many stakeholders.\n\nThe figures for the first year speak for themselves\n\nThe SSE 2024 scheme started up in 2019. It is led by Les Canaux, a non-profit, and the Yunus Centre, who are liaising with government agencies and local authorities. Its goal is to connect with SSE organisations, inform them and help them earn contracts relating to the Games.\n\nOne year on, it is in touch with more than 1,200 companies and working side by side with them throughout the process. It is talking to buyers about opening up more opportunities for SSE bidders in their calls for tenders, helping SSE organisations team up in consortia (with regular businesses or other SSE players) and encouraging companies that have been awarded contracts to subcontract some of the work to SSE organisations."
