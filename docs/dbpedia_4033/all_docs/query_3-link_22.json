        "text": "The 2024 Paris Olympic Games kicked off with an opening ceremony held on the Seine River in Paris that featured mechanical horses, Lady Gaga, and Marie Antoinette.\n\nTV viewers were treated to a spectacle where the Seine functioned as a huge stage, with performances held on bridges and rooftops.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X that the event celebrated \"global cooperation, solidarity, fairness, and athletic perseverance.\"\n\nGermany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the ceremony was \"unique\" before wishing the German Olympic team good luck in their upcoming games.\n\nJustin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, praised Canadian singer Celine Dion's performance, calling it one \"we'll never forget\".\n\nMixed reviews\n\nElsewhere, reviews of the ceremony were not as glowing. Multiple social media users called the ceremony \"bizarre\" and criticised the decision to hold the ceremony on the Seine instead of in a stadium, where it is traditionally held.\n\nOne of the reviews of the ceremony from UK newspaper The Guardian called its delivery \"patchy\" and pointed out that the rain, which continued through multiple performances, posed a distraction.\n\nAmerican newspaper the New York Times summarised the show in a headline stating \"Opening Ceremony Misses the Boat\".\n\nIn France itself, the French daily Le Monde said that the show director, Thomas Jolly, had presented \"an immersive show in a capital transformed into a gigantic stage\".\n\nRight-leaning Le Figaro was less complimentary, saying that some of the show was \"just too much\" and that a recreation of The Last Supper of Jesus and his apostles in front of a fashion show was \"unnecessarily provocative\".\n\nThat scene alone has generated massive reactions on social media, with some users calling it distasteful, as did Italy's Deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini, who called it \"sleazy\" and demeaning.\n\nThe Games, which are Paris' first Summer Olympics in a century, will run until August 11, 2024."
