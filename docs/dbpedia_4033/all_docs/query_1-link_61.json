        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nIsrael launched airstrikes into Khan Yunis overnight, a part of Gaza it already assaulted and left a few weeks ago. A ground operation now seems likely.\n\nIt's not the first time in this now-nine-month war that Israeli forces have claimed to clear Hamas from an area, only to return weeks or months later.\n\nIn the streets of Khan Yunis today, pain and prayers for the dead, as residents mourn, Palestinians killed overnight in Israeli bombardment. The strikes came a day after Israel ordered a mass evacuation from much of the city in response to a barrage of rockets, it said were fired from Khan Yunis into Israel.\n\nMany of those forced to flee have already been displaced multiple times. They escape any way they can, carrying only their most crucial belongings.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nFor wounded Palestinians, there's also no place for lifesaving care. The European Hospital, one of the last functioning hospitals in Khan Yunis, is now virtually empty.\n\nPatients are being transferred to the nearby Nasser Hospital, already packed full. Earlier this year, Israel had already largely withdrawn from Khan Yunis and is now ordering Palestinians to evacuate to the humanitarian safe zone of Al-Mawasi in anticipation of a new ground assault. This isn't the first time the Israeli military has assaulted parts of Gaza it said it had already cleared of Hamas, including parts of Gaza City and Jabalia in the north.\n\nFor months, the U.S., Qatar and Egypt have tried to negotiate a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas, but progress has stalled. A top Israeli military official told The New York Times the army is short of munitions and wants a pause in the fighting in Gaza.\n\nBut, today, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied the claims.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nFor more on Israel's military campaign in Gaza, we turn to Daniel Byman. He's a professor at Georgetown University and the author of \"A High Price: The Triumphs and Failures of Israeli Counterterrorism.\"\n\nProfessor Byman, let me ask you about this policy now, this — this pattern, rather, of the IDF going back into areas it had previously cleared and left in Gaza. What does it tell you about how the military campaign is going? Does it signify a setback, or is this kind of pattern to be expected in this warfare?\n\nDaniel Byman, Georgetown University:\n\nThis kind of pattern is to be expected because of, frankly, a flaw in how Israel has approached Gaza from the start.\n\nIt's gone in. It's tried to kill Hamas fighters, remove them. But it hasn't left enough forces to garrison much of the strip. And, as a result, when Israeli forces leave, Hamas reconstitutes itself. And this is a lesson that the United States learned the hard way in Afghanistan and especially Iraq, which is that you need to have something governing the territory you conquer.\n\nAnd Israel has failed to do that.\n\nDaniel Byman:\n\nCompletely eliminating Hamas is unrealistic. This is an organization that not only has over 25,000 fighters under arms before the war began, but also has extensive social and educational and religious networks in Gaza.\n\nIsrael can reduce Hamas' military strength, can make it harder for the organization to fight as a large, coherent force. But Hamas is going to be a presence in Gaza, at least for the short and medium term. And that's going to be very hard for Israel to change.\n\nDaniel Byman:\n\nSo the Israeli military has to worry about three different wars. First, of course, is the war on Gaza, and it's using many munitions for that.\n\nMy sense is that it does have enough munitions to continue that on a day-to-day basis, but that is costing a lot of Israel's ammunition stocks. But Israel also has two other wars. One is the limited war that's going on across the border with Lebanon, where it's fighting the Lebanese Hezbollah.\n\nHere, we have seen literally thousands of attacks across the border, and well over 100 people have died on the Lebanese side, over a dozen Israelis. And this conflict is not only something that's ongoing, but Israel fears it can become a full-bore conflict.\n\nAnd, if so, it would dwarf what we have seen in Gaza. Hezbollah is a much more formidable force than Hamas, and the Israeli military would need a lot of munitions for this, and it wants to keep some in reserve for that possibility.\n\nAnd the last, as we saw in April, is an open shooting war with Iran. And when this happened in April, Israel used its missile defense forces and really did only a very limited retaliation against Iran itself. But the possibility that Iran could become directly involved in a much bigger conflict is also something that the Israeli military has to worry about.\n\nDaniel Byman:\n\nSo, Hamas has prepared for this war for — really for years.\n\nAnd we know that it has amassed massive ammunition stockpiles and rocket stockpiles. We saw some of this, of course, on October 7 itself, which also involved massive rocket and missile attacks on Israel. So it's not surprising that Hamas has kept some in reserve, probably in tunnels or other facilities that are relatively secure.\n\nMy sense is that Israel has destroyed a lot of this. This has been a real success of Israel's invasion of Gaza. But it's hard to go completely to zero, and Hamas certainly retains some capability, including a capability to try to attack Israel directly.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nI have less than a minute left, but I wonder if you can briefly summarize for us.\n\nBased on U.S. war conduct you have seen in other nations, when you look at the way Israel's conducted this war inside Gaza, have you ever — do you see any comparison there between what Israel is doing and what you have seen the U.S. do in other places?"
