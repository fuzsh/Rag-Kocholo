        "text": "The evening kicked off with the female track and the male field events, Yannick Kraus, 14, from Ultimate Athletics and Jess Ranches, showed why he won the Ultimate Athlete of the Year, by breaking all his personal bests in five events and smashing four club records. Kraus has been recently selected for the German National Team after a successful summer competing in Europe. It was a busy night for Kraus who managed a huge 6.06m on his first long jump, a 43.40m Javelin throw, which was an improvement on his personal best by 8m, along with throwing the 4kg shot put 13.40m and finally sprinting the 80m hurdles in 11.78 second. He also won his fifth gold in the U15 100m.\n\nFuture star: Isobel Chalier took gold in the 1500m\n\nMeanwhile Ultimate Athlete Jordan Claasen,16, was delighted to break his personal bests in the 100m (10.94 seconds) and 200m (22.57 seconds) finishing in the silver medal position to Ali Haji,16, who executed a smooth 10.60 seconds and 22.08 seconds, which were new U17 Club records, showing once again why he is on the Bahrain National Team.\n\nOliver Demain Ultimate Athlete 16 continues to make a name for himself on the road racing scene in the UAE. He comfortably won the U17 3000m in 9.07 seconds and the 1500m with a new personal best of 4.13. Demain is a popular figure among the Ultimate Athletics family as he volunteers with the mini-athletics programme and is a great role model for the elite endurance squad.\n\nUAE Tokyo 2020 Olympian Mohamed Hassan Al Noobi inspired many with his 200m win in an easy 22.20 seconds, it was his first time hitting the track since competing in Toyko and has since been beach training in the off-season. His advice to the youngsters is to train hard and do all the competitions they can to gain experience. Al Noobi says he hopes to make the Olympics again in Paris 2024.\n\nFemales leading the way on the track included the long standing Ultimate Athlete Emily Davidson (17) from Dubai College who dominated the 100m and 200m senior categories. Isobel Chalier (13) also from Dubai College took gold in the 1500m and holds the club record of 4.42.86, she recently won the New Balance Fastest Mile challenge too. The future is very bright for Chalier in, the triathlon scene where she is already racing with International elite standard triathletes.\n\nLisa Campbell the founder of Ultimate Athletics and Ultimate Racenight director is so pleased that competitions are back on track and sees the events as an opportunity for athletes of all levels to time trial and monitor their progress throughout the season. It’s also a chance to meet and compete against other athletes from across the region and from the Ultimate Athletics academy in Abu Dhabi.\n\n“I would like to thank the UAE Athletics Federation for attending the meet and New Balance for their support and passion for grassroots athletics. We look forward to an exciting season of competition.” Next Ultimate Racenight November 18th Juniors for more details about the academy which holds training for all age groups, tots, youth, teens and adults from beginners to elite visit www.ultimateathleticsuae.com or call 050 225 7024.\n\nThe event was supported by the UAE Athletics Federation and Dubai Sports Council and event photography by Melissa Lear."
