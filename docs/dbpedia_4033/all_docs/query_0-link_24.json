        "text": "Britain is celebrating Team GB's success after its athletes achieved their best gold medal haul since the 1908 Olympics.\n\nSir Chris Hoy won his sixth Olympic gold medal with victory in the keirin to take GB's gold medal tally to 22.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron described the successes as \"a golden summer\" for the team and the country.\n\nMayor of London Boris Johnson said he hoped athletes' efforts to \"bring home the bling\" were not over yet.\n\nAmong the medal-winning athletes were cyclist Laura Trott, who won her second Olympic gold, and Britain's equestrians in the team dressage event.\n\nTriathletes Alistair and Jonny Brownlee won gold and bronze respectively in front of a huge crowd at Hyde Park.\n\nMr Johnson offered \"fulsome congratulations\" to Team GB and said: \"Our athletes' efforts to bring home the bling have delivered a tally not seen by any British team in over three generations.\n\n\"But it's not over yet. I join the nation in its hope that Team GB is set to deliver more sporting brilliance.\"\n\nSir Chris's victory in the sprint event means he has overtaken Sir Steve Redgrave as the athlete with the highest ever number of GB Olympic gold medals.\n\nThe pair hugged at the side of the track, before the ceremony where Sir Chris tearfully accepted his medal.\n\nPeter Keen, elite performance director for UK Sport, said the success in the velodrome was the result of years of hard work: \"It's the stuff of dreams. But also it encapsulates the story that's led to London 2012, which is more than a decade now of building and planning and training.\"\n\nAlso during the day, Nick Dempsey won a silver medal in windsurfing, while cyclist Victoria Pendleton took silver in the sprint, and Robbie Grabarz won a bronze medal in the men's high jump.\n\nTeam GB are third in the medal table - behind China and the United States - with 22 gold, 13 silver and 13 bronze. The tally of 48 medals, with five days of competition remaining, is above the haul from Beijing.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron said: \"This has really turned into a golden summer for Team GB and for the whole of the UK.\"\n\nLater he tweeted: \"Victoria Pendleton's final race made us all proud...as did Chris Hoy and Laura Trott's spectacular Golds.\"\n\nHis brother Alistair said: \"That race was just unbelievable. I felt kind of in control right from the start and the crowds... I don't think I've ever come across anything near like that, and probably never will again.\n\n\"My ears are still ringing from all that noise and it was absolutely amazing.\"\n\nThe brothers' mother, Cath, said: \"It's very unreal. You don't think that those boys running through that line and winning those medals are your sons.\"\n\nWith Team GB's success continuing, demand for any remaining Olympic tickets remains high.\n\nLord Coe, chairman of Games organisers Locog, said there were no problems with the ticketing website breaking down.\n\n\"The website's not crashing... it's just the demand for tickets,\" he told the BBC.\n\nHe added that about two million people at any one time are trying to buy tickets, but only a few thousand each day were able to be released.\n\nLord Coe also said it was acceptable for rock music to be played during some track events, in a bid to attract a younger audience to watch athletics.\n\nIn other developments:"
