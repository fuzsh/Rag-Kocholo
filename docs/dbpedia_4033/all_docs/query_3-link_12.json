        "text": "We committed to organising an event that is socially responsible and economically sound right from the bidding phase. Our goal is simple. We aim to develop a new model for the Games, which is open to all businesses. This is because we strongly believe that these companies have a lot to offer and that we can learn from each other to ensure social and environmental impact is placed firmly at the heart of the Paris 2024 project.\n\nOpening tenders to all\n\nHundreds of public tenders have be organised over the past five years. We are determined to ensure that companies from the SSE which account for 10% of employment opportunities in France, can submit their proposals.\n\nTo identify the companies able to provide the most innovative solutions that best suit our needs, Paris 2024 sources companies from the SSE. Through its solidarity platform ess2024.org*, Paris 2024, alongside Solideo, the Yunus Centre and Les Canaux, bridges the gap between the regions of France, the Paris 2024 project and the booming world of social entrepreneurship and the circular economy. The platform has been designed as a system for monitoring and coaching, a source of information and a forum for networking. It is intended to continue operating well beyond 2024.\n\nImpact reports to spread the word\n\nImpact reports identify the solutions and innovations put forward by organisations from the SSE in areas of the economy that affect the Games, such as temporary use in urban development, waste management on construction sites, employment and occupational integration, green mobility, local agriculture, and socially responsible catering.\n\nThe impact reports are designed to encourage future Olympic and Paralympic contracting parties and authorities to integrate service providers from the SSE.\n\n*Ess2024.org was officially awarded the “Territoire French Impact” Label, which recognises both regions and initiatives that have a positive impact on society, the environment, or the economy. It means the platform will receive support over a three-year period to reach out to the entire country."
