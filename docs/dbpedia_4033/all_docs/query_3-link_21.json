        "text": "🇫🇷 Sadly, the Paris Olympics are ending, and despite controversial opening ceremony moments, questions about swimming in the Seine and stories about Olympic Village food quality, there were plenty of \"surprise and delight moments\" that stole the spotlight captivating us all. In today's nutty media landscape, these snapshots in time remind us that sport brings us together, regardless of borders and puts a spring in our step. 👇 👓👓 Steven Nedoroscik the Pommel Horse Guy - An unknown Massachusetts gymnast with Superman glasses took the world by storm, proving that underdog stories still come in first. 🇹🇷 The Low-Key Turkish Shooter - Competing without advanced equipment and his laissez-faire approach, Yosef Dikec showed us the pure essence of sport. 😂 Snoop Dogg with Martha Stewart - Their entertaining presence was unexpected, quirky and, honestly, just plain funny. 🎾 Novak Djokovic's tears and uncontrollable shaking after his gold metal win showed pure raw emotion. 🎶 Celine Dion's powerful comeback - enough said. ❗ ❗Australia's Aris Trew won a gold medal in skateboarding at 14 astonishing us all. 💪 Simon Biles' return, bowing to rival Rebecca Andrade and competing with grace and resilience, was a testament to the importance of mental health. With 24-7 streaming and constant coverage, we could indulge in the power of media that just maybe tugged at our hearts: ❤️ Human Interest Drives Engagement: Personal triumphs and emotional narratives captivate audiences, creating lasting impact. ⭐ Celebrity Influence Expands Reach: Stars rightly or wrongly amplify media coverage connecting with broader audiences. 👀 Diverse and Unexpected Narratives Capture Attention - Moments like the Turkish shooter are welcoming, more inclusive and add variety. 🌏 Sports as a Platform for Social Commentary - The Olympics continue to be a stage for athletes to make impactful statements on societal issues, influencing global discourse. These moments gave us a much-needed break. Maybe we all need to find those Clark Kent glasses and that Superman or Superwoman cape and dream of what could be. #Paris2024 #Olympics #MediaRelations #Storytelling #SportsMarketing #HumanConnection\n\nIs the French Olympics 2024 another example of a business being reactive rather than proactive? They certainly seem to be making changes after they receive complaints, that is something to be commended at least. 🤔 I wonder though, if they had paid more attention to their audience in certain areas, maybe they would have been prepared and made changes BEFORE the complaints came in. I am not in the food industry, and I am not an athlete, BUT, I do know that if I was catering for athletes, I would have put meat, protein and high carb at the top of my list of food I needed in high volume, vegan wouldn't have featured too high in my list. Especially for this group of athletes, the most elite in the world! ▶️ Was it another case of a wonderful vision, without a good strategy?!? A good strategy would have surely seen this as one of the largest obstacles they would have faced? Were there too many people at the top excited by the 'food vision' that they lost sight of who they were actually catering for? ❓Did they forget their audience? ❓Did they mistake their vision for a strategy? ❓Did anyone flag this as an issue ahead of the games? Incase you were wondering, that photo was taken 12 years ago at the London Olympics. The French are known for their world class cuisine, I am sure Michael Roux and Raymond Blanc say that butter and cream make every meal better!? Or something along those lines! #parisolympics #paris2024 #parisolympcis2024 #olympics2024 #olympicgames #getlogicalstrategy #getlogical #goingforgold\n\n🏊♂️ As we gear up for the Paris 2024 Olympics, there's a critical issue that's less about the podium and more about the pontoon - the water quality of the Seine River! As athletes from around the globe prepare for this iconic event, a disturbing revelation has surfaced. A U.S. triathlete unexpectedly found herself prepping for an entirely different kind of competition: battling E.coli exposure during her training sessions in the Seine. This should raise more than just eyebrows; it should prompt urgent actions. Having trained for a triathlon myself, I know the integral role of water environments in such sporting events. Athletes often overlook the risks associated with water quality, focusing instead on stamina and speed. It's startling yet vital that we spotlight these environmental and health concerns as global sporting events like the Olympics approach. 🌍 What should we be asking? Here are a few prompts: - How are event organizers addressing these environmental challenges? - What measures can athletes take to safeguard their health during such competitions? - How might this impact the reputation and future international sporting events in terms of environmental sustainability? I believe as a global community, we should hold event organizers accountable for providing safe, clean environments for all competitors.

Its beauty lies in its #ability to #inspire, #challenge, and unite. Watching athletes push their limits, achieve the #impossible, and overcome adversity offers a spectacle of human strength and spirit that is unmatched by any other form of entertainment. Seriously, if you don't love sports, you might want to check your pulse! Take the ongoing #Olympics, for instance. They are not just a showcase of athletic prowess but a stage for incredible stories of perseverance and triumph that Hollywood could only dream of scripting. Did you hear about Allyson Felix, the 35-year-old sprinter who’s participating in her fifth Olympics? She’s practically the Benjamin Button of track and field! Or how about Oksana Chusovitina, the 46-year-old gymnast who’s defying gravity and father time in her eighth Olympics? She’s so experienced, she probably taught the original Olympians how to stick a landing. And then there’s #AlexMorgan, the 39-year-old football player who’s competing in her fourth Olympics. She’s a living testament to the idea that age is just a number—though perhaps it’s also a very large number if you’re calculating the hours she’s spent on the field. Then we have #SteffenPeters, a 59-year-old equestrian, still riding strong and proving that age and wisdom can indeed compete with youth and vigor. These narratives go beyond physical accomplishments; they represent years of dedication, resilience, and unwavering passion. Seeing a seven-month #pregnant woman like Egyptian fencer #NadaHafez compete is nothing short of mind-blowing. You’ve got to respect someone who’s balancing their center of gravity with a baby on board and still managing to score points. Such stories are more compelling than any scripted drama. They remind us that with #determination and #hardwork, we can overcome any obstacle. Sports reveal the best in #humanity, showing us what we are #capable of when we push ourselves beyond our perceived limits. If you don't love sports, perhaps you haven't yet experienced these #awe-inspiring moments that demonstrate the true essence of human potential. The beauty of sports lies in these shared experiences and the emotional highs and lows that come with them. It's not just about #winning or #losing; it's about the journey, the struggle, and the triumphs that resonate with our own life stories. And let’s face it, sometimes it’s just fun to watch people do things we could never dream of doing ourselves—even if it’s just to make us feel a bit better about that #gym membership we never use.\n\nI want to talk about the Olympics, and about so many people's fear of posting to LinkedIn, for fear of seeming \"salesy\" or \"braggy\" or (insert other unfavorable adjective here). Think about how much inspiration we all get from these Olympic athletes and their stories. What if Simone Biles didn't have the Olympics as a platform, and was just quietly going along being the best gymnast in the world? What if we didn't know the story of Zeng Zhiying, the table tennis player who made her Olympic debut this year at age 58, or equestrian Laura Kraut, who became the oldest Olympic medallist this year at 72? If these women were just doing their thing in their own corners of the world, not entering the Olympics, would the world be better for it? Would the value of their private modesty and humility outweigh the life-changing potential of sharing their stories with the rest of us? Because after all, humans are wired for story (hat tip Lisa Cron, author of \"Wired for Story,\" a great read). I'm not saying we can't live quiet, private lives, or that quiet, private lives are somehow less important or valid than ones lived out loud, in public. I don't believe that at all. We all have different wiring, different needs, and set our own, different boundaries. But choosing quiet out of love for privacy and quiet is very different than choosing silence out of fear of being judged. If you have something to share — an idea, a vision, a series of lessons, a body of knowledge — and choose not to share it, for fear of seeming \"braggy,\" I want to offer you some tough love. Your fear of self-promotion, of appearing immodest, of taking up space because who are you, anyway.... that's all about you. It doesn't make you more gracious or classier or (insert other favorable adjective here). It just robs us of the chance to be affected by you, to learn from you, to feel less alone because of something you share about your journey. Oh, and by the way: We all have something to share. We don't need to be the GOAT, we don't need to be famous or credentialed up the wazoo. We only need to be human. If, when it comes to speaking up publicly, you're doing the equivalent of working out in a private gym and keeping your experiences completely private... and if somewhere inside of you, you know this choice is coming from fear, and something in what I've said here resonates with you... then maybe this post can be your invitation to make a shift.\n\nIn the unlikely event I ever run another marathon, I wouldn’t want to do it at night. But some famous global running events, including the world championships in #Doha, are having to reschedule races to avoid participants having to run in #extremeheat conditions. Midnight long-distance running is just one stark example highlighted by sports ecologist Madeleine Orr in her new book, Warming Up: How Climate Change is Changing Sport. Elite and professional sports are being affected by changing environmental issues – and she explains how global sports movements can do something about that. It’s a timely publication. May 2024 was the warmest May on record around the world, with a global average surface air temperature 0.65°C above the 1991–2020 average. It also marked the 12th consecutive month for which the global average temperature reached a record value for the corresponding month in the previous year. This is not the sort of record-breaking streak the world needs. And this summer, millions of sports fans are watching an action-packed season of sport from the #Euro 2024 football tournament in #Germany and the #Wimbledon tennis championships to the #ParisOlympics and the Tour de #France cycling challenge. Further afield, there’s the Copa America South American football championship, major league baseball’s All-Star Game and the #US tennis open in #NewYorkCity, the women’s football world cup in #Colombia and the rugby championship in #Australia. These competitions showcase top-tier athletic performances, attracting billions of viewers numbers that are predicted to rise. And all of these sporting events are being affected by climate in some way. Already this year, football in the #UK has been hit by heavy rainfall and #flooding, while tennis players in the US have had to endure blistering temperatures. The #TourdeFrance, meanwhile, was marred by melting road surfaces, and routes were cut short for rider safety as temperatures in La Route d'Occitanie in southern France soared in July 2022. If the tournaments themselves don’t provide concessions for #extremeweather this year, the athletes’ preparations almost certainly already have. For example, the kits that sports men and women wear are changing. It was once the domain of the designer to create clothing that was agile and give competitors the edge, now they are tasked with creating garments that wick sweat away and keep body heat down in competitions such as running, cycling and football, as temperatures peak. In her book, Orr shows how the world of sport is being affected by climate change in bizarre and unusual ways. For example, alcoholism has increased among staff working on ski slopes, because a warming planet is causing snow to melt and ski seasons to end sooner. The resulting reduction in ski training times is literally driving staff to drink.\n\n🌟 With the Olympics in Paris Only Days Away...🌟 As we gear up for the grand spectacle of the Olympics in Paris, it's essential to remember a few key pieces of advice for those involved in supporting the incredible athletes: 1. Be Locked In and Focused: This is a critical time. Ensure every detail is meticulously planned and executed. Your attention to detail can make a huge difference. 2. Be Available but Invisible: Support your athletes by being there when they need you but also knowing when to step back. Let the athletes shine and perform without unnecessary distractions. 3. Let the Athletes Be Athletes: They’ve trained for years to reach this stage. Your role is to provide the support they need while allowing them the space to do what they do best. Balancing availability with invisibility is the key. I often joke - be like wallpaper - it’s always there in the room, but you don’t notice it unless you look for it. I’ve always marveled how well my staff over the years have mastered this. Pictured is some of my current and former staff with the Bucks who were always so locked in during practices. They were out of the way but their focus is clearly visible. All of them had different roles and observed every practice with intent and through their own lens. You have an incredible opportunity to enhance performance. Here's to an unforgettable Olympics in Paris! 🇫🇷🏅 #Olympics2024 #Paris2024 #AthleteSupport #FocusAndSupport #AvailableAndInvisible"
