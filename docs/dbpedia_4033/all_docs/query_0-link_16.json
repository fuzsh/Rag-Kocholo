        "text": "Director Leni Riefenstahl developed groundbreaking cinema techniques for her documentary on Berlin's 1936 Summer Olympics. But since she was the filmmaker behind powerful Nazi propaganda, such as \"Triumph of the Will\" (1935), \"Olympia\" is a controversial work. Yet it also prominently features the achievements of African-American athletes, such as Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals at the games.\n\n\"Race\" depicts Jesse Owens' path to Olympic gold, along with the racial discrimination he faced throughout his career. It includes a scene showing Leni Riefenstahl clashing with Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels on how the athlete should be portrayed in \"Olympia.\" It stars Stephan James (right) in the lead role, and one of the film's main locations is Berlin's Olympic Stadium.\n\nJamaica's national bobsleigh team made its Olympic debut in winter 1988 in Calgary, Canada. The Disney comedy \"Cool Runnings\" is loosely based on their story. Pursuing their dreams despite all setbacks, the team certainly embodies the saying of the founder of the International Olympic Committee, Pierre de Coubertin: \"The important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win, but to take part.\"\n\nThis is another biopic based on an athlete who made it to the 1988 Calgary Winter Games despite all odds: Michael \"Eddie\" Edwards. He's portrayed as a tenacious outsider who manages to break Britain's ski jumping record at the Olympic event — despite finishing last. Taren Egerton (left) stars in the lead role, alongside Hugh Jackman as his coach.\n\nThis historical drama, which won four Oscars, is based on the true story of two British runners in the 1924 Olympics: Scottish athlete Eric Liddell, a devout Christian, and Harold Abrahams, an English Jew. The soundtrack by Vangelis is best remembered for its iconic main theme, which went on to be used several times in slow-motion sequences referring to the film's \"beach run\" scene.\n\nThe true crime drama \"Foxcatcher\" is based on the story of John du Pont, an eccentric multi-millionaire who recruits US Olympic wrestling champions to train for the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. However, the philanthropist (portrayed by Steve Carell, r., with Channing Tatum, l.) has mental problems, eventually leading to murder. \"Foxcatcher\" won the best director award at the Cannes film festival.\n\nFilmed in mockumentary style, this black comedy is based on one of the most infamous scandals in sports history. Figure skating champion Tonya Harding's entire career came crashing down after her ex-husband orchestrated an attack on her fellow skating rival, Nancy Kerrigan, hoping it would incapacitate her from taking part in the 1994 Winter Olympics. Margot Robbie starred in the title role.\n\nSteven Spielberg's 2005 action thriller does not focus on the Summer Olympics held in Munich in 1972, but rather the tragedy that largely overshadowed the sports event, as the Palestinian terrorist group Black September killed 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team. The film goes on to depict how the Israeli government secretly retaliated against Palestinians allegedly involved in the massacre.\n\nWhile most Olympic films are based on true stories, \"Asterix at the Olympic Games\" is of course an adaptation of the comic book by Rene Goscinny and Albert Uderzo. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive non-English film ever made, with a budget of €78 million ($93 million). The movie's marketing was mainly based on this record; critics didn't find it very funny.\n\nBefore the current Tokyo Games there was Tokyo 1964: At the time, it was seen as an opportunity for Japan to showcase its modernity and its newly rebuilt infrastructure, which had been destroyed during World War II. Filmmaker Kon Ichikawa was commissioned to document the games; it is viewed as one of the best sports documentaries of all time, focusing on the humanity of the event's participants."
