        "text": "Jeremy Corbyn has faced questions about a wreath-laying ceremony he attended in Tunisia in 2014.\n\nThe Labour leader has said he visited the cemetery to honour innocent people killed in a 1985 Israeli air strike.\n\nBut he has faced criticism because the event took place near memorials for people who were accused of having links to a terrorist attack at the 1972 Olympic Games.\n\nIn recent days the issue has returned to the headlines. Here's what we know:\n\nDuring the trip, Mr Corbyn took up an invitation to join a delegation paying respects to those killed in a 1985 Israeli bombing of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) headquarters in Tunis.\n\nPhotographs suggest a wreath was laid at the base of a large statue erected in memory of the victims and that Mr Corbyn was next to the memorial, mostly in the background, not holding a wreath.\n\nThe delegation then seems to have moved on to a cemetery three miles (5km) away, which houses a monument to those killed in the attack.\n\nIt also includes graves of people accused of having links to the 1972 Munich massacre, when Palestinian group Black September killed 11 hostages from the Israeli Olympic team and a West German police officer.\n\nYes. Mr Corbyn has confirmed he did lay a wreath, saying this was for those who died in the 1985 bombing.\n\nBut critics have pointed out that a photograph from the event appears to show him standing opposite the graves of Atef Bseiso and Salah Khalaf, two senior PLO officers who were accused of links to the Munich attack and were assassinated.\n\nThe Daily Mail, which first published the image, quoted Ilana Romano, the widow of weightlifter Yossef who was killed at Munich, saying: \"To go to the grave of a person behind the killing of 11 athletes, he should be ashamed and apologise.\"\n\nThere is no photograph of Mr Corbyn laying the wreath at this spot. A memorial for the 1985 air strike is feet away.\n\nThe BBC's Rana Jawad, who has visited the cemetery, said she understood the area next to the pair's graves to be the spot where dignitaries and diplomats gather every year to remember victims of the 1985 bombing, as well as senior PLO members.\n\nThe cemetery signs, and markings on the graves and memorial, are in Arabic.\n\nMr Corbyn's spokesman has said he did not take part in laying wreaths on the men's graves. A Labour spokesman also told the Guardian the two men had denied having links with the terrorist group, and that the PLO also disputed this.\n\nSince the controversy first hit the headlines during the 2017 general election campaign, Mr Corbyn has repeatedly said he was in Tunisia to promote peace in the Middle East and was commemorating victims of the 1985 Israeli bombing.\n\nAttention has focused on a 2014 Morning Star article, in which he wrote that \"wreaths were laid at the graves of those who died on that day and on the graves of others killed by Mossad agents in Paris in 1991\".\n\nMossad is the Israeli intelligence agency. Mr Corbyn has not confirmed precisely who he was referring to in this article.\n\nAtef Bseiso was killed in Paris in 1992, and Salah Khalaf was assassinated in Tunisia in 1991.\n\nOn Monday, after photographs from the event emerged in the press, Mr Corbyn was asked to clarify his involvement. He said he had been at the event as part of a conference which was \"all about the search for peace\".\n\nAsked about his Morning Star reference to wreaths for \"others killed by Mossad\", he said he was present but added: \"I don't think I was actually involved in it\".\n\nOn Tuesday, when pressed further about the pictures of him holding a wreath, he said: \"I laid one wreath along with many other people, as I have said, in memory of all those who died in the awful attack in 1985, which, as I keep repeating, was condemned by the whole world.\"\n\nThe Conservatives have sought to capitalise on the row, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid suggesting Mr Corbyn should resign.\n\nBut Mr Corbyn's supporters defended him.\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Corbyn had \"devoted his life to promoting justice and peace\" which involved \"meeting people who haven't shared those ideals\".\n\nBackbench MP Chris Williamson said the Labour leader's \"enemies\" were using the story to \"destabilise\" him, accusing them of \"indulging in egregious smears\"."
