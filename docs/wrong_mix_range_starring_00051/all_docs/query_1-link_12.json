        "text": "Parenthood‘s Max is all grown up, playing teenage John Bennett in Peacock’s Ted prequel series.\n\nPremiering Thursday, Jan. 11, the seven-episode binge picks up 19 years ahead of the first movie, with Max Burkholder cast as John and series creator Seth MacFarlane reprising his role as the foul-mouthed teddy bear.\n\nMore from TVLine\n\nTVLine Items: Call the Midwife Holiday Special, Yellowstone Season 3 on CBS and More\n\nGood Trouble: Callie and Jamie Return... to Celebrate a Special Milestone? - 2024 FIRST LOOK (Exclusive)\n\nSNL Music Video: Naked Emma Stone Leaves It All Flappin' in the Breeze\n\nThe trailer, released on Wednesday, offers our first glimpse of Burkholder in action.\n\nIn the series, the year is 1993, and Ted’s “moment of fame has passed, leaving him living with his best friend John, who lives in a working-class Boston home with his parents and cousin,” according to the official logline. “Ted may not be the best influence on John, but when it comes right down to it, Ted’s willing to go out on a limb to help his friend and his family.”\n\nRounding out the ensemble are Scott Grimes (The Orville) and Alanna Ubach (Euphoria) as John’s parents Matty and Susan, and Giorgia Whigham (13 Reasons Why) as John’s cousin Blaire.\n\nThe original Ted starred Wahlberg as the aforementioned John Bennett, a Boston native whose childhood wish brought Ted to life. Mila Kunis played John’s girlfriend Lori in the first film, while Amanda Seyfried was introduced as John’s new love interest Samantha in 2015’s Ted 2.\n\nThe first movie became the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time that wasn’t a sequel or derived from other IP. The first and second films brought in a combined $750 million worldwide.\n\nWill you be checking out Ted when it arrives on Peacock? Let us know in Comments.\n\nWhat’s New on Streaming\n\nView List"
