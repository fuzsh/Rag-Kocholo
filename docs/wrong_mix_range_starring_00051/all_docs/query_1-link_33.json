        "text": "Last week I finally relented and watched 2008’s ‘smash-hit musical’ Mamma Mia! Quite how I’ve managed to avoid this cultural juggernaut (*citation needed) until now remains a mystery, but it just hasn’t appealed to me. Musicals are far from my favourite genre, but lately the prospect of seeing a stereotypically hoarse Pierce Brosnan blast his way through some Swedish disco has been too hard to ignore.\n\nWe start on a Greek Island. Well, it could be anywhere in the world, given how little the Greek culture and its people are involved. There isn’t one line of Greek spoken in the entire film, despite being filled with presumably Greek (yet probably East-Londoner) extras. The Greeks – there to provide an actual Greek Chorus, in a too-subtle reference that probably went over most of the audience’s heads – are really only there for us to peer at and say ‘Ooo, aren’t foreign people funny?’\n\nWe open on fish-eyed Amanda Seyfried, posting three letters in the middle of the night. She’d like to invite her father to her wedding, but her mother – a horrifically miscast Meryl Streep – was a little too loose with her loving twenty years ago, and the identity of her father is unknown. Based on their previous cinematic roles, it’s either suave secret agent (now architect) Pierce Brosnan, rom-com love-rat (now banker) Colin Firth, or submarine commander (now travel writer) Stellan Skarsgård. They arrive on the Greek island at the same time and forced hilarity ensues.\n\nWe also meet Seyfried’s husband-to-be, the effortlessly smarmy Dominic Cooper (who once played Ian Fleming, in a nice Bond connection with Brosnan). Cooper’s eyes are so far apart, they’re practically on the side of his head, which makes him the perfect fit for the fish-out-of-water Seyfried.\n\nA sign of a good musical is when the characters can slip into the songs effortlessly, from a line of dialogue that gradually turns into the first line of a song before you even realise. The transition should be invisible. Here, the songs are crowbarred in so heavily, the effect is truly jarring. And of course, the fact that they are all ABBA songs that everybody knows inside-out, makes the first lines stick out like a sore thumb. It’s shockingly bad.\n\nGiven how much of a success the film was – people are morons, go figure – it’s interesting to see how cheap the film looks. They spent $52 million on it, but it looks like it was made for no more than $5 million. You have to wonder how much of that budget went to the stars, as the film looks far more rough around the edges than that figure would suggest.\n\nOf course, it doesn’t matter how much they spent on it. Joe Public’s desire to see Streep alongside Julie Walters (disappointing) and Christine Baranski (yikes) dancing to a load of ABBA songs like drunk mums at a wedding meant that it would have been a success if they had shot it on smartphones. The film eventually took a Box Office of over $600 million."
