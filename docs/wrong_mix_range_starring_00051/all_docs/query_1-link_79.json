        "text": "As an experiment started for reasons forgotten by me, at the beginning of 2022 I decided to keep track of all the films and full seasons of TV I watched during the year. I know a lot of people will keep track of all the books they read in a year, so I wanted to do something similar. And although I am a decently fast reader and I possess the customary large tower of unread books staring me down every day, I’ve always had a particular fascination with movies and TV. (In fact, by ten years old I had decided I wanted to be a film director when I grew up… still haven’t grown up yet! )\n\nWell, it’s now 2023; I have all my entertainment consumption data from the previous set of 365 days and the experiment has come to its conclusion… What exactly is that conclusion…? Well, I guess we’ll see as we go along.\n\nThe Data\n\nIn 2022 I watched a total of 91 different films or new seasons of television. To break down that number a little more:\n\nEntertainment watched between January 1st 2022 and December 31st 2022\n\n86 movies\n\n5 new seasons of TV\n\n46 of the 86 movies were ones I had seen previously.\n\n40 were films I had not seen before (or not seen in their entirety)\n\nAll 5 of the TV seasons were new to me.\n\nIn total I recorded about 11,776 Minutes of watched entertainment in 2022. (This does not include random episodes of TV, sports, or bits of a film I’d catch here and there. In order to be recorded I had to have watched a film in its entirety, or seen a full season of a TV show.)\n\nThanks to an earworm of a song with a catchy first verse and an awful chorus, we know that there are 525,600 minutes in a year. So I spent about 2.24048706% of the year watching entertainment…. Seeing the number recorded as a percentage like that does give me pause. Over 2% of my time last year? hmm… Is that a good thing? A bad thing? Neither? Huh. Maybe. We’ll come back to this.\n\nBack to the numbers:\n\nFilm:\n\nThe longest film I watched this year was: The Batman (2022) at 176 minutes (2 hours and 56 minutes)\n\nThe shortest film was: The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022) at 44 minutes\n\nBoth were new films I hadn’t seen before.\n\nTV:\n\nThe longest season of TV I watched this year was: The Great British Baking Show — Collection 10 (2022) at 599 minutes (9 hours and 59 minutes)\n\nThe shortest was: Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022) at 265 minutes (4 hours and 25 minutes)\n\nLet’s stay on the TV side of things for a minute:\n\nThe five new seasons of TV I watched this year were, in the order I watched them:\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett — Season One (2022)\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi (2022)\n\nStar Trek Strange New Worlds — Season One (2022)\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power — Season One (2022)\n\nThe Great British Baking Show — Collection 10 (2022)\n\nFor a total of 1,684 minutes (28 hours and 4 minutes)\n\nHere are my rankings of the new TV I watched this year (ranked out of a possible 5 Clothespins):\n\n5. The Book of Boba Fett — Season One (2022)\n\nI know a lot of the fandom was not high on this show… but I have learned from previous experience to take most of what the Star Wars fandom says with a huge grain of space salt.\n\nThere were complaints about too much weird “Tatooine Politics” in this show — but I like a good political drama… and some people claimed that the writers ‘ruined’ Boba Fett because — gasp! — they gave his character a story arc where maybe he’s changed and matured through experience, instead of just keeping the status quo of being a silent murderous killing machine like he’s been since 1980. Call me crazy, but I much prefer a character who shows real growth and emotion over, I don’t know, seven straight episodes of endless fights or whatever.\n\nHaving said that, I think the shows were slow to get going and could have used a few more episodes. I also agreed with some people that episodes 5 and 6 felt really out of place for a show supposedly about Boba Fett.\n\n3 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n4. Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022)\n\nI hope this was only season one of this show, and not just a one-off, but even if it is, it was an excellent show. Take all your ridiculous young Leia hate and think to yourself where Carrie Fisher would tell you to shove it.\n\nThe cast were all amazing, starting with Ewan McGregor, of course, back as Obi-Wan. Vivien Lyra Blair had the perfect amount of sass needed for young Leia.\n\nOther standouts were Joel Edgerton, Bonnie Piesse, Jimmy Smits, and of course Hayden Christianson, all reprising their roles from the prequel trilogy. (Edgerton and Piesse’s performances were particularly memorable to me) Moses Ingram was also solid in her performance as Third Sister.\n\nMy biggest complaint was, again… not enough episodes! More Obi-Wan please!\n\n4 ½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n3. The Great British Baking Show — Collection 10\n\nThe quintessential comfort TV show, The Great British Baking Show is such a nice calm show. Unlike many American cooking competition shows, this show from our neighbors across the pond has little to no drama or fighting among the contestants. (I can’t think of any) Everyone in the show helps each other out and is rooting for the other people in the tent.\n\nI don’t need to tell you it’s great, everyone knows it’s great. This new season was great!\n\n4 ½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n2. Star Trek Strange New Worlds — Season One (2022)\n\nI’m not gonna lie… I was thhhiiiiiissss close to making this my top new TV I saw in 2022.\n\nI can’t overstate how fantastic Strange New Worlds is. Seriously, if you’re a Star Trek fan and haven’t seen SNW, you are missing out on the best show in recent memory. (Dare I say… perhaps my favorite Star Trek show of all time? But I won’t yet. Still too early.)\n\nThe show strikes the perfect balance of using legacy characters, but not feeding the audience a mush of nostalgia gruel every episode. Anson Mount is perfect as Captain Pike; Ethan Peck is the best Spock after Leonard Nimoy; Celia Rose Gooding nails the character of Uhura. And that’s not even mentioning Melissa Navia and Christina Chong playing new characters who are also amazing.\n\nEveryone should watch this show!\n\n5 out of 5 Clothespins\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power — Season One (2022)\n\nI mean, what’s there to say? It’s Lord of the Rings, it’s Tolkien, it’s filled with an amazing cast and spectacular visuals. My favorite cinematic experience of the last few years was watching the first episode on the big screen in a theater. The opening prologue to the first episode is my favorite sequence I’ve seen all year.\n\nDon’t listen to people online looking for attention by hating on the show. Philistines on the sidewalk!\n\nThe spectacular cast are too numerous to mention, but I’ll just highlight: Morfydd Clark, Charlie Vickers, Robert Aramayo, Owain Arthur and Markella Kavenagh.\n\n5 out of 5 Clothespins\n\nOne last note about TV:\n\nThis year I watched about 98% of the latest season of The Amazing Race. Previously I had seen bits and pieces of the show, here and there. This year I followed it all the way through and really enjoyed it. New Amazing Race fan here!\n\nI also watched almost all of the entire run of all seven seasons of Boy Meets World (1993–2000). But I ended up skipping one or two episodes and fast jumping through another couple I wasn’t very interested in. So I can’t officially count that in my total for the year since I didn’t watch every single episode.\n\nNow on to The Movies!\n\nHere is my ranking of the 36 new (to me) films I saw this year. (Not a definitive ranking of every movie I saw… just the new ones)\n\n(For those of you not inclined to read a long rambling jumble of words today, I put a TL;DR (“Too Long; Didn’t Read”) marked in BIG letters near the bottom of this post)\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nSimply by me listing a film in my rankings, does not necessarily mean that I endorse the film as one appropriate for all audiences. Some films are meant for more mature audiences in regards to content, theme, and/or language. Some may have plot elements you may not enjoy. Please do your own research before watching any film.\n\nSo! From my least favorite film, all the way up to my number one. Starting with:\n\n#36. God’s Not Dead: We The People (2021)\n\nI could go forever about how bad the whole God’s Not Dead franchise is. One day I will! Get ready for a lengthy youtube video outlining everything wrong about these films! Heavens to Betsy, there’s a lot. But that is not this day! This day I’ll just say that this, the fourth film in the series, is THE WORST! Here are only a few of my live tweeted receipts to prove it:\n\n½ out of 5 Clothespins (Because that’s as low as I can go. It gets half a Clothespin because it could always have been longer and it wasn’t, so they get points for that.)\n\n#35 God’s Not Dead: A Light in the Darkness (2018)\n\nI do not think you will be very much surprised by this next entry. The 3rd film in the God’s Not Dead series has the distinction of being only slightly less horrible than the fourth installment. They also successfully killed off the only redeeming character from the first two films, which is A Choice.\n\nI have the Tweets for this film too, but I’ll just leave you with the one that perfectly encapsulates my feelings watching the movie:\n\nFor humanity’s sake I hope there is not a fifth installment in the God’s Not Dead Cinematic Universe… but if there is, you know I will be here to Tweet about it.\n\n½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#34 Cats (2019)\n\nNext is the movie I’m pretty sure is responsible for starting the recent worldwide pandemic. I just know it was behind it somehow.\n\nThe thing I remember clearest from the experience watching this film (and it was an EXPERIENCE!) was the uncanny feeling of horrible unease and dread in the first 15 minutes of the film. I remember watching the actors running around an alleyway as CGI cats and feeling what I was watching was horribly unnatural. I had this strong desire to turn off the film and never speak of it again.\n\nBut gradually the initial horror wore off and… well, I wouldn’t go so far as to say I viewed the rest of the film with a light heart and a song on my lips… but I made it to the end. My. Gosh. What a trainwreck.\n\n1 out of 5 Clothespins (because, despite the multitude of problems with the film… it’s not God’s Not Dead)\n\n#33 The Social Network (2010)\n\nI recently came across an article from a fairly respected website that had this film as the #2 best film in the last 10 years. And to be fair, it did win three Academy Awards.\n\nI like biographical films. It had a good cast. Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay, and I loved The West Wing so… I watched it. But I just didn’t like this film. In fact I hated it. I hated the main character, which wasn’t necessarily the fault of the actor or the writer. I’m pretty sure they nailed the character as he actually is.\n\nBut it was a mean film, filled with people being jerks to each other and other people. The treatment of some of the female characters was not good.\n\nSkip this film. The only redeeming quality was Andrew Garfield, who was great as always.\n\n1 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#32 It’s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie (2002)\n\nI admit, I’m as surprised as you are to find a Muppet production this close to the bottom of my list — really just barely scraping past Mark Zuckerberg, and James Corden in a CGI cat suit — but I regret to inform you that this Muppet movie is bad.\n\nThe script was at times mean, and poorly written. The characters felt off. The plot was weak. The humor, uninspired or flat. Even the technical qualities of the film were poor; so many shots had the Muppets framed horribly on the screen — way too much empty space between the puppets and the top of the screen. Exactly the wrong way to film puppets.\n\nI knew the Muppets were in a rough patch in the early 2000’s, but I didn’t know just how bad.\n\nGonzo was okay though.\n\n1 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#31 The Circle (2016)\n\nI really wanted to like this movie. I’ve had it on my list of movies to watch pretty much since it came out. It sounded like it’d be an interesting thriller: “A woman lands a dream job at a powerful tech company called the Circle, only to uncover an agenda that will affect the lives of all of humanity.” The cast is STACKED: Emma Watson, Tom Hanks, John Boyega, Karen Gillan, Patton Oswald, and Bill Paxton.\n\nBut I regret to announce that it was horrible. An already rushed and weakish plot was completely blown to pieces by a bafflingly thrown together ending where important plot points are introduced and then waved away before the movie tries to stir up an emotional feel-good ending out of thin air in the last two minutes. The ending actually made me angry at how bad it was. I wanted to get Liz (my wife) to watch the movie, just so I could complain about the ending.\n\nLet me clarify though: I put this all on the writing and direction. Emma Watson, Tom Hanks, John Boyega, and all the other actors did their absolute best with what they were given. But good acting can only cover over a certain number of multitudes of sins. (The only acting note: the jury’s still out on the quality of Watson’s American accent)\n\nInterestingly enough, I think my opinion of the movie has actually improved with time. When I first watched it, I had it ranked dead last, only barely scraping above the God’s Not Dead atrocities.\n\nThe only part of the movie that stuck with me was the fascinatingly weird version of “Simple Gifts” that runs under the credits. But hey, I like me a little weird techno music now and then.\n\n1 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#30 Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018)\n\nUh, let’s see, what’s there to say about this latest Wizarding World installment.\n\nIt was… um… I found it bland. The first Fantastic Beasts movie was charming. Eddie Redmayne is a fine actor. As are all his co-stars from the previous film. I am not a big fan of retroactive additions to a Fictional World’s canon, so Dumbledore’s inclusion in this film was mostly “meh”. If they had kept Colin Farrel as playing the villain from the first film, I think this film would have been substantially better. Johnny Depp’s acting is just not doing it for me. (I find that, outside of a handful of past roles, Depp feels a little one note in his acting approach… aside from any possible personal problems).\n\nI honestly can’t tell you much about the plot of this film. The movie felt really long when I was watching it, so I know there had to be oodles of plot somewhere. I just couldn’t tell you what it was. I’m also not high on the David Yates direction style.\n\n1 ½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#29 Disenchanted (2022)\n\nOh man. It hurts my heart a little bit to think of this film. Amy Adams is one of the greatest actresses of this generation. The original film Enchanted (2007) is a favorite that I will show to my daughters sometime. I held out to the hope that Disney would make a sequel worthy of the original.\n\nBut alas, the film fell flat. None of the new songs were particularly catchy. The plot felt clumsily pasted together. Amy Adams was great as always, but man… what could have been.\n\nAs a side note, the animated portions of this film felt SO cheap!\n\nStill, it wasn’t the worst film I saw this year by far… there were a few clever moments, and the whole production design of the film was great. This was also one of the last films I watched when I was in quarantine from catching Covid, so maybe that somehow affected my mental state when viewing the film.\n\n2 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#28 A Christmas Story (1983)\n\nAs a proud Northeast Ohioan, who lives within easy driving distance of the Christmas Story House, I felt I had to finally watch this film to see what all the hubbub was about.\n\nSure, I knew some of the famous lines that have found their way into our vernacular — “You’ll shoot your eye out kid!” “I triple dog dare you!”. I recognize the Red Ryder. The bunny pajamas. The Leg Lamp (still not a fan). But I had not seen the actual film, so this Christmas (actually it was October) I finally sat down and watched it.\n\nAnd I will fully admit: it wasn’t that bad. There were parts that were much funnier than I expected them to be. I had low, low, low expectations for this film going in, and it exceeded those low expectations. I can’t say I am likely to ever watch the film again… maybe in like ten years. Maybe. But it wasn’t bad! I enjoyed it for what it was.\n\n2 ½ out of 5 Clothespins.\n\n#27 Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017)\n\nI again find myself, much like with the previously mentioned Fantastic Beasts film, unable to say exactly why I don’t like this movie more. I dunno, I guess I felt like the movie didn’t really have anything in it that I didn’t already expect to see from watching the trailers. It felt like a very current blockbuster film: lots of action, lots of characters… but lacking something.\n\nHowever it wasn’t lacking in acting talent. The actors were all incredible. Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black and Kevin Hart played their characters perfectly. No notes.\n\nI borrowed the next film in the series from the library several times this year, but couldn’t rally myself to watch it. Maybe next year.\n\n2 ½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#26 Inside Llewyn Davis (2013)\n\n*Deep breath*\n\nOk.\n\nSpeaking of films I wanted to like more than I did, this is the poster child for that film. Let’s look at the facts:\n\nIt’s a Coen Brothers film!\n\nIt stars Oscar Issac!\n\nIt’s got John Goodman!\n\n(It’s got Adam Driver? Ok, completely forgot about that…)\n\nIt’s about a musician, lots of music, that’s good!\n\nIt’s the Coen Brothers!\n\nAnd yet, I found the film… confusing and underwhelming. Which could be exactly what the Coen Brothers were intending, I don’t know. Perhaps there’s a larger story I’m missing. It’s always possible. A lot of the story itself was not my typical cup of tea, which is fine. But there weren’t enough other amazing parts that I liked enough, to power through the parts I didn’t much care for. Or maybe I’m just not remembering the whole story well. It was confusing… to me anyway.\n\nBut I do know that the acting was on par with or surpassed any other acting out there. Oscar Issac should always do more films. That cat in the film was good too.\n\n2 ½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#25 Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers (2022)\n\n(I feel real weird ranking this above a Coen Brothers film.)\n\nThis movie was a bit of a surprise with how much I enjoyed it. It sounded corny, it sounded campy… just a nostalgia money grab, right? Chip and Dale, the chipmunk stars from a 90’s cartoon show are back to make a comeback!\n\nBut it was good! It was fun! I mean, it’s not going to knock anyone’s socks off with poignant messages or anything. But it was alright!\n\n2 ½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#24 Waking Sleeping Beauty (2009)\n\nOddly enough, for someone who loves behind the scenes featurettes, and nonfiction entertainment industry books, this was the only documentary to make my list in 2022. (I tried real hard to start watching the new Beatles’ docu series on Disney+… but the length always deterred me)\n\nThis is the story of Disney Animation in the 1980’s-1990’s and how they managed to break a box office slump. It’s a short film, not much over 90 minutes. But it’s right up my wheelhouse; I love learning Disney History, so it was a winner in my book.\n\nI will admit though, to not really hearing much new information that I hadn’t already heard somewhere else… but I like a good documentary.\n\n3 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#23 Groundhog Day (1993)\n\nAnother entry on the list of classic movies I’ve never seen. You know the drill: Bill Murray is a slightly cantankerous weatherman, who’s sent to cover Punxsutawney Phil on his big day: Groundhog’s Day.\n\nAnother entry on the list of classic movies I’ve never seen. You know the drill: Bill Murray is a slightly cantankerous weatherman, who’s sent to cover Punxsutawney Phil on his big day: Groundhog’s Day.\n\nAnother entry on the list of classic movies I’ve never seen. You know the drill: Bill Murray is a slightly cantankerous weatherman, who’s sent to cover Punxsutawney Phil on his big day: Groundhog’s Day.\n\nMuch like A Christmas Story, I really enjoyed this film more than I expected to. It had a lot more heart than I figured it would, and I can see why it’s beloved by so many.\n\nAnother entry on the list of classic movies I’ve never seen. You know the drill: Bill Murray is a slightly cantankerous weatherman, who’s sent to-\n\n3 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#22 Elf (2003)\n\nI’ve been met with more than a few disbelieving looks this year when I admitted to having never seen the movie Elf. So I knew this was the year I would finally watch Will Ferrel wear the green tights and eat the spaghetti with Maple Syrup.\n\nNot to keep repeating myself, but the movie was much better than I expected it to be. Perhaps I should stop assuming that all popular comedies will be bad? Might be an unfortunate movie watching habit I’ve developed. (But does that make me a real film reviewer now? hmm…)\n\nI mean, what’s there to say about Elf? Most of you have probably seen the film, so you know all about it. It’s got heart; it’s got a certain sense of charm… It’s a Christmas Movie!\n\n3 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#21 Cast Away (2000)\n\n“WILSON! WILSON!”\n\nThe film that inspired a thousand red-hand printed volleyballs…\n\nYeah, ok, not sure what that was supposed to mean. But this year, I finally watched Cast Away. I’m pleased to report it did NOT instill in me a new fear of flying, which is good. I thought it was a good film.\n\nIt inspired me to consider what I would do in such a situation. Probably go mad…but still an amusing thought exercise. I’d definitely go the Ben Gunn route of madness though. Tom Hanks was much more composed than I would have been. But I too would start talking to volleyballs. Day one. That’s a given.\n\n3 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#20 Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)\n\nDo you want the plot? I mean, you can probably guess it…\n\nIt’s dinosaurs. Eating people. And the people who aren’t actively being eaten by dinosaurs are trying to stop the dinosaurs from eating them or any other people who might possibly be eaten in the future.\n\nI liked the first Jurassic World movie, and this one I felt lived up to the normal sequel expectations. Was Toby Jones in this movie? I feel like Toby Jones had something interesting to do in the film…\n\n*Goes and checks*\n\nYup, I was right. So he was good! As was Isabelle Sermon. I remember being impressed with her performance.\n\nThe movie is all coming back to me now. It was really quite good! All the acting was great, and the plot was interesting. You know what? I was going to give this one only 3 Clothespins, but I’m bumping it up!\n\nNot only that, but I’m pushing it up one in the rankings! Good job, film!\n\n3 ½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#19… no, #20 Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (1986)\n\nEveryone say it with me:\n\nALL: “I never saw the film before and it was better than I expected.”\n\nBut seriously. It was a fun ride through the 80’s! The music was amazing; the visuals were clean and bright. The acting was great for the most part. There were a few very 1980’s parts where I would have probably made some changes… a few corny or outdated parts. But overall: excellent.\n\n3 ½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#19 Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)\n\nSee above\n\n#18 The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent\n\nNow we have the opposite problem. I really want to like this film even more than I do. And I already like it quite a lot!\n\nNicolas Cage is an actor I love to watch. His comedy is like no other. And Pedro Pascal! Wow, what an amazing actor! He’s got the comedy chops!\n\nSo I like the film. I love the actors. I just felt like it was missing something to push it over the edge into being an even greater film. I don’t know what that would be… but I think it was missing something to give it that final… well, something … and then it would have been… *chef’s kiss*.\n\nHaving said that, I will give the same caveat that I gave for Disenchanted: I watched this movie in isolation during my Covid days. It could have affected my ranking somehow.\n\nI’ll still watch anything with Nicolas Cage and Pedro Pascal. Massive talents.\n\n3 ½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#17 A Muppet Christmas: Letters To Santa (2008)\n\nAhhh, the cleanser needed from the rubbish down at #32.\n\nThis was fun. No, it’s not earth-shattering. It’s not going to win any Academy Awards for anything. But it was fun, it was heartwarming. It had the Muppets being the Muppets.\n\nYou got Rizzo and Pepe. You got Gonzo. You got Kermit. You got Nathan Lane. (You got weird Paul Williams… yikes) You got a sweet ending… You have Santa!\n\nWhat more could you want?\n\n3 ½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#16 Citizen Kane (1941)\n\n… and movie buffs everywhere fall over in a dead faint.\n\n“The greatest film of all time!!!… at number 16???”\n\nDon’t come at me with pitchforks! I do not intend any disrespect to the Great Citizen! It was a powerful film. I can appreciate how groundbreaking it was. The storytelling is a masterclass of scriptwriting.\n\nTo save myself from any rabid cinema fans who might Tweet mean things at me, or try to snip my tie or something, I’m going to plead faulty technology. At the time I watched the film, I could only find it on some sketchy Free Movies! Roku app, so the visual and sound quality was subpar, and it didn’t come with subtitles. I’m old. I need subtitles.\n\nSurely it would be number… something higher… if I could have only watched with subtitles.\n\nAlas, alas, alack.\n\n4 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#15 The Batman (2022)\n\nFrom the general superhero movie fare that has come out from Warner Bros in recent years, I did not expect anything much from the Caped Crusader’s newest flick. Add to that the nearly three hour runtime, and The Batman was a hard sell.\n\nBut I’m glad I did. With Covid and nothing but time on my hands, I was determined to watch it one night. It’s a beautiful film. It takes Batman and puts him in situations not typically seen in previous Batman films. I love the way they lean into Batman being the world’s greatest detective. I almost wish they’d lean into it even more! I’d religiously watch a detective show starring Batman.\n\nI will admit: it was long! But it didn’t feel like it dragged at all; it was packed full of interesting plot. This movie also wins for scariest film, and it had the most terrifying jump scare I’ve had in many years (It wasn’t a rat in the cage!)… but it may have been only truly terrifying to me and any other people with chiroptophobia.\n\nMaybe there’s a future for me in Bruce Wayne’s line of work?\n\n4 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#14 White Noise (2022)\n\nHere I am completely and 100% owning up to an unfair and completely irrational personal bias with this particular film’s ranking. I have a personal connection to the film that has clearly slowed my mind.\n\nFull disclosure: I worked as a background extra on this film for seven days. I appear very briefly (and blurrily) in the film. My cousin Kristina appears once, less blurrily, in the film. I recognize many other background performers who I’ve become acquainted with in real life. I’ve been to those set locations. (I used the bathroom in one of the major building set pieces!) I’ve nearly almost rubbed elbows with the director and stars of the film. I can see how the film was put together from the random pieces shot on set.\n\nSo yeah, I’m biased. I’m putting it higher than it should be. It’s my list. Sue me.\n\nLooking at the actual merits of the film itself: I enjoyed parts of it, I disliked parts of it, and I am yet unsure how I feel about the rest of it.\n\n4 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#13 Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)\n\nThe problem with doing this list at the end of the year is that some films have faded from the ol’ memory banks more than others. Ideally one might re-watch each film before giving their rankings, but then you’d end up leaking into next year’s movie list and then it just gets all muddled and jumbled up.\n\nAnyway, thinking back now while I eat a cookie, I thought Dr. Strange was a very unique entry into the MCU collection. If that sounded like bunk I would write while I was stalling for time, it was.\n\nSo am I unfairly depriving some other more deserving film of the coveted 13th spot by keeping a film here that I really can’t remember plot specifics of? Maybe.\n\nBut on the other hand, what I do remember of the plot, I really liked. I love a good dimension melding story where there are multiple realities and multiple versions of characters. I’m a sucker for random cameos. The magic special effects in these movies is always good. There was some cool creepy stuff.\n\nSo, yeah. I’ll keep it.\n\n4 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#12 Clue (1985)\n\nThis was another one I watched in quarantine, and by the fact that it’s still so high up on the list must mean it was doubly good.\n\nClue is a great game; I’ve had the pleasure of playing Clue characters in real life… so I’m a fan. I’m also a fan of Tim Curry, Christopher Lloyd, Leslie Ann Warren, and Kellye Nakahara. The humor, the twists, the turns… PLUS… the multiple endings!\n\nIt’s a recipe for success, and it was a success. (With of course a big “1980’s Film” sticker plastered on it)\n\n4 ½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#11 Good Morning, Vietnam (1987)\n\nI’ve discovered in my advanced age, certain things that I like that, as a younger person, I never realized I liked. Things such as:\n\nSports. I really didn’t get into watching sports much until my 20’s\n\nBiographies. I love a good biography.\n\nAnd radio/voice acting. I’m slightly obsessed with discovering behind the scenes stories and information about radio broadcasting and voice acting.\n\nSo, Good Morning, Vietnam has been on my list of movies to watch for a looong time. And for good reason. It’s Robin Williams at his best.\n\nPlaying the unconventional radio disc jockey, Adrian Cronauer, Williams brings his signature style of comedy to a film set against the bleak background of the Vietnam War. And it can be pretty bleak at times. The film, which is sometimes billed as a comedy, pulls very few punches in showing some harsh realities of war.\n\nA very young looking Forest Whitaker also appears, accompanied by many other great actors who fill out the cast.\n\n4 ½ out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#10 Enola Holmes 2 (2022)\n\nNow we’re into the top 10! All movies you can’t go wrong watching… and that’s just how I feel about Enola Holmes 2.\n\nIt is just a solid movie all around. Millie Bobby Brown is as perfect as the titular hero as Henry Cavill is as her brother Sherlock. I think it’s as good as the original Enola Holmes movie (sans the 2), and can you really ask for anything more in a sequel?\n\nIt’s another film where I really liked the visual design + lighting and color choices.\n\n5 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#9 The Parent Trap (1998)\n\nPossibly the biggest upset of the entire list.\n\nI have been what you might call a “Disney Movie Remake Snob”. (With some legit reasons for being so… just look at some of the recent “live action” animated film remakes) I watched the original 1961 The Parent Trap movie starring Hayley Mills a lot growing up; it was one of our family’s favorites. So of course I assumed, ‘oh the 90’s remake starring a young Lindsay Lohan can’t be as good’…\n\n…but I think it was so much better!\n\nYes, it’s a kid’s movie remake of a kids movie… there are problems with the story here and there. A lot of lines are taken verbatim from the 1961 version. No, it is not better Cinema™ than a lot of the other films on this list. But it was just darn enjoyable.\n\nLohan shines as twins Annie and Hallie — separated at birth and distributed to each parent (played by the late Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid). The supporting cast really shines in this film, specifically Simon Kunz as Martin, and Lisa Ann Walter as Chessy. (The scene in the movie with Chessy and Annie — you’ll know the one when you see it — is so well acted by Lisa Ann Walter)\n\n5 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#8 Mank (2020)\n\nHeh, heh, heh… I don’t know if this makes my regulation of Citizen Kane to number 16 better or worse, but Mank, the dramatized behind the scenes story of the WRITING of Citizen Kane, comes in at number 8.\n\nGary Oldman - another of the maestros of acting — plays Herman J. Mankiewicz, a 1930’s Hollywood screenwriter on a deadline to finish writing Citizen Kane for director Orson Wells. The movie is told in a somewhat nonlinear way, and shows, or at least suggests, some of the inspiration for certain portions of Citizen Kane. (I don’t know how true to life it really is, so don’t ask me) I would definitely recommend watching Mank as a companion piece to Citizen Kane. It gave me a better understanding of some of the original film.\n\nOldman knocks it out of the park as always. Amanda Seyfried shines, per usual, as a supporting character. Lilly Collins and Tom Burke more than hold their own acting opposite Oldman.\n\nThe film is also shot in black and white which I’m a sucker for.\n\n5 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#7 The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022)\n\nThis new Christmas Special was short (44 minutes), sweet, and fun from start to finish. James Gunn’s ragtag team of superheroes are reunited again, here to bring Christmas Cheer… and maybe kidnapped hapless celebrities?… to one and all! Because it’s so short, I don’t want to get into too many plot details, you should just go and watch it.\n\nThe cast from the Guardians movies are all here, some getting more to do than others. That’s my only semi-complaint: they could have had more for some characters to do… but I also understand not bogging down the story with more unnecessary scenes, just to give more characters lines. And the story is told very cleanly.\n\nDave Bautista and Pom Klementieff really get an opportunity to have some fun and they do an amazing job. There’s an original song in the movie that was hilarious. It’s also heartfelt and has beautiful visuals.\n\nIt’s only 44 minutes. Go watch it!\n\n5 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#6 A League of Their Own (1992)\n\nSo, before 2022, I had already seen most of this film. I’d watched probably 90% of it when it was playing on TV over the years. But I watched it from start to finish this year, so it counts on my 2022 film list.\n\nAn absolutely fantastic movie! Directed by the great Penny Marshall, it follows the story of the World War II era professional all-female baseball league. It stars Genna Davis, Tom Hanks, Lori Petty, Rosie O’Donnell, and Madonna. Plus old Penny Marshall favs David L Lander and Garry Marshall. (and many, many more great actors!)\n\nAs one of the greatest baseball films of all time (so say I), it’s a movie everyone should watch. If you haven’t, you’re disappointing Jesus! (Just kidding!) A lot of people talk about Garry Marshall and the movies he’s directed… Penny Marshall should be talked about at least as much as her brother, and maybe more!\n\nI’ve already introduced the wisdom of “There’s no crying in baseball!” to my daughters in our backyard baseball games this last summer.\n\n5 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#5 Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)\n\nNow that I’ve seen this film I will no longer be shunned by certain sisters as a heathen. And the sisters had a point: AMAZING film. Just the visuals alone are worth the price of admission and then some. The animation in this film did things in a way I’d never seen before, and it was breathtaking.\n\nThe film follows the story of Spider-Man. It also follows Spider-Man, and Spider-Man’s friend who was bitten by a radioactive spider. And others… Well, you gotta see the film!\n\nThe cast is spectacular in every way… and did I mention the visuals and the animation? They pair perfectly with the music, which is an essential part of the film and is done brilliantly.\n\n5 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#4 tick… tick… BOOM! (2021)\n\nThe directorial debut of Lin-Manuel Miranda, of Hamilton fame, I knew next to nothing about tick… tick… Boom! before going in. I knew it was a musical, starring Andrew Garfield, but that was it.\n\nWow! Quite a film! Based on a stage musical of the same name, the film is a story about playwright Jonathan Larson, doing his best to get a musical off the ground, while struggling with his own doubts and fears, and his personal relationships. I don’t want to dilute the story by describing it in too much more detail… it was just so good! The music was great, the acting was spectacular… emotionally it felt like a very real film.\n\nIn addition to Andrew Garfield, the film also stars Vanessa Hudgens, Alexandra Shipp, Robin de Jesús, Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, Joshua Henry, and Bradley Whitford.\n\n5 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#3 12 Angry Men (1957)\n\n12 Angry Men has the distinction of being the very last film I watched in 2022 (Star Trek (2009) was the first). It was one of the last nights of the year and I was looking for a nice short film I hadn’t seen before that would round out my list nicely. 12 Angry Men, at a trim 95 minutes, fit the bill.\n\nI had run across the film before in a book on filmmaking by Sidney Lumet (the film’s director) and I knew it was something of a classic. (It’s been remade several times)\n\nWhat an amazing film! It’s one of those films that takes place basically in one room, and all it is is a dozen actors talking to each other. But even with that simple premise, it manages to create a gripping courtroom drama that’s also such a character driven personal drama on so many levels. The film becomes not so much about a jury trying to decide if a defendant is innocent or guilty but a reflection on the jurors themselves and what this one man’s story says about each and every one of them.\n\nThe acting is, of course, amazing. After watching the film I went onto IMDB to look up the actors, and was surprised how many of them I knew from other films or TV. Even the actors who had smaller roles brought the most to what they were given.\n\nAs a note, as you can probably guess by the title, it was a very male-centric movie. There were no female characters to speak of (I clocked one background actor who was a woman, aaannnd… that was it.) After watching the film, I really, really want to see this film as a play — but with an all-female cast playing the 12 angry men. I think it would be amazingly good.\n\n5 out of 5 Clothespins\n\n#2 Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022)\n\nI have a serious problem. Now whenever I see a picture of the actor Daniel Craig, who is world famous for cutting his teeth playing Bond, 007 — all I can hear is the brilliantly wonderful Foghorn Leghorn-esc Benoit Blanc accent that he affects in Glass Onion, and not his native British timbre.\n\nI think it’s a good problem to have though, because it looks to me like Mr. Craig is having the time of his life starring as the detective in Rian Johnson’s ‘whodunit’ film series (consisting of Knives Out in 2019, and now the second film, Glass Onion).\n\nBrilliantly acted, bitingly funny, and wholly original, Glass Onion (and Knives Out) do what some other films can so far only strive to recreate: something completely unique. Billed as a Knives Out sequel (a subtitle included to the dismay of director/writer Rian Johnson) the only link to the previous film is the inclusion of Craig’s Blanc. No other winks, no cameos… which is AMAZING! I am onboard for Johnson and Craig to make a zillion more Benoit Blanc mysteries.\n\nI’m not going to spoil anything for you about the plot of the film. But I want to mention that the rest of the cast of Glass Onion is nothing to sneeze at either: Edward Norton, Kate Hudson, Dave Bautista, Janelle Monáe, Kathryn Haun, Leslie Odom Jr., Jessica Henwick, Madelyn Cline… a who’s-who of great actors. Plus some surprise guests I will not divulge!\n\nIt’s also such a bright, colorful film. Loved it.\n\n5 out of 5 Clothespins\n\nAnd that brings us to…\n\n#1 Encanto (2021)\n\nOk, this one feels a little like cheating. I saw probably 99.9% of this Academy Award Winning animated film in 2021. I have young kids after all… they watched it on repeat for days and days! But somehow I kept missing, like, one scene. So in 2022 I finally saw that final 0.1% of a scene, and now here it is on top of my list!\n\nAs it rightfully should be. There is not a thing wrong with this movie. The music is endlessly brilliant. The acting is flawless. The characters are rich. The visuals are striking. I have no problems if my daughters want to watch it over and over, I won’t get tired. (No, that’s not a challenge!)\n\nI hope to goodness Disney doesn’t rush into a sequel, but it’s probably inevitable. But even still, I stand by my choice of Encanto as number one.\n\n5 out of 5 Clothespins\n\nSo what have we learned?\n\nWell, I’ve discovered that I am apparently a little prejudiced against popular comedies that I’ve never seen. Also Disney remakes. Maybe from now on I should be more open minded and not judge a film by its popularity or previous incarnations, haha, because so far they’ve pretty much all turned out to be good!\n\nI go back to the numbers I put there at the beginning. Those 11,776 moments so dear, amounting to 2.2% of the year… There’s always that thing people were told as kids: “Stop watching TV or your eyes will fall out and your brain will rot! Go read a book!” And while I agree that everything has to be done in moderation, and if the amount of visual entertainment (or literature) you’re watching (or reading) is having a detrimental effect on other aspects of your life, then there’s a problem. But everyone needs a break or an escape or a rest or whatever it is. It’s all good! There are some amazing things that can be — and are being said in films and TV through the medium and I think it’s important. I could go on and jump up on a soapbox, but I’m not going to. Maybe next time. Maybe not.\n\nI think for sure I’m going to continue this experiment in the next year. I think if I change anything, I’d like to have a larger percentage of the films I watch to be New-To-Me… but still hit some of the oldie but goodies! (Spoiler alert: I’ve watched three films so far in 2023 and one of them is a repeat — Yesterday (2019) )\n\nTL;DR\n\nAnyway, here’s the final ranking of the new films, as promised at the beginning — this time from best to worst:\n\nEncanto (2021)\n\nGlass Onion (2022)\n\n12 Angry Men (1957)\n\ntick… tick… BOOM!
