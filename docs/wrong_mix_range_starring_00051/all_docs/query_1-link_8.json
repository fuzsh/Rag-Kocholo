        "text": "#100. Yellow Submarine\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: March 1, 1969\n\nThe Beatles were initially unimpressed with the animation for \"Yellow Submarine,\" though the bandmates later changed their minds. As a result, they only put together a few new songs for the soundtrack, relying on songs from previous releases. Side two consists of classical-style instrumentals composed and arranged by the band's producer, George Martin. Both the album and film endure as psychedelic classics.\n\n#99. I'm Breathless\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: June 23, 1990\n\nPop legend Madonna was on top of the world in 1990, releasing chart-topping albums and starring in Hollywood films. In 1990's \"Dick Tracy,\" however, she did bothâ€”in addition to playing a lead role, she released \"I'm Breathless,\" a Broadway-style soundtrack to accompany to the movie, and a fully realized album in its own right.\n\n#98. Godzilla - The Album\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: June 13, 1998\n\nWhile 1998's \"Godzilla\" was widely considered a box office dud, its soundtrack was a popular slice of '90s music culture. Featured on the album are singles from Jamiroquai, The Wallflowers, and Diddy (then known as Puff Daddy). Diddy's offering, \"Come With Me,\" received substantial rotation on MTV and the radio, in particular. The song samples a famous Led Zeppelin song, which Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page contributed to on the soundtrack.\n\n#97. Bohemian Rhapsody\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: March 2, 2019\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" shattered box office records to earn the distinction of highest-grossing music biopic in the U.S. and around the world, nudging \"Straight Outta Compton\" into second place. But for all the fanfare surrounding the film and its soundtrack, the album failed in one regard: By not including a new song on the setlist, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" neglected to have a shot at Best Song at the Academy Awards.\n\n#96. Hannah Montana 3\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: July 25, 2009\n\nYears before she shocked audiences with her 2013 VMA performance, Miley Cyrus played a wholesome girl with a secret alter ego on Disney's \"Hannah Montana.\" Given that Cyrus' character was a pop star, it's no surprise that the series and movie produced a range of hit soundtracks. Among them was \"Hannah Montana 3,\" which features songs from the third season, including the singles \"He Could Be the One\" and \"Let's Get Crazy.\"\n\nYou may also like: 20 iconic rock songs written on the spot\n\n#95. La La Land\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Jan 28, 2017\n\nDamien Chazelle's 2017 hit musical \"La La Land\" is still fresh on everyone's minds, as are its catchy songs. Featuring performances by the film's stars, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, the soundtrack covers a range of styles, energies, melodies, and moods. Its most popular number, \"City of Stars,\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song.\n\n#94. Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Nov 26, 2005\n\nNot to be confused with 50 Cent's debut album of the same name, \"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\" is the soundtrack to the 2005 film in which he starred. As one might expect, the soundtrack features a bevy of gangster rap songs performed by 50 Cent with fellow artists from his G Unit Label. While the movie underperformed at the box office, the album went triple-platinum, selling more than 3 million copies.\n\n#93. Mission: Impossible 2\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: May 27, 2000\n\nThe second \"Mission Impossible\" movie has always been something a franchise oddball and the soundtrack is similarly unsubtle. It comes loaded with songs from head-banging outfits like Limp Bizkit, Foo Fighters, Buckcherry, and Rob Zombie. The soundtrack and film may have made loads of money in their respective markets, but thankfully the franchise itself got back on track for the next installment.\n\n#92. The Great Gatsby: Music From Baz Luhrmann's Film\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: May 25, 2013\n\nAustralian filmmaker Baz Luhrmann built his reputation on pairing classic stories with hyperkinetic visuals and modern music, and 2013's \"The Great Gatsby\" was no exception. Executive produced by Jay-Z, the film's soundtrack hosts a bevy of hot talent, with three hit singles: \"Young and Beautiful,\" \"A Little Party Never Killed Nobody (All We Got),\" and \"Bang Bang.\" As Rolling Stone put it: \"This ain't your great-grandfather's West Egg.\"\n\n#91. Tommy\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: May 31, 1975\n\nDirector Ken Russell and The Who adapted the band's best-selling 1969 album \"Tommy\" for the big screen. Along with the film version came an updated soundtrack, overseen by songwriter and guitarist Pete Townshend. In addition to The Who, the album featured contributions from artists like Elton John, Eric Clapton, and Tina Turner, all of whom also appeared in the film.\n\n#90. Above The Rim\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: April 23, 1994\n\nReleased at the height of Death Row Records' popularity, the soundtrack to 1994's \"Above the Rim\" features a range of artists from the hip-hop label. Standing out from the pack was hit single, \"Regulate,\" by Nate Dogg and Warren G. One of the film's stars, rapper Tupac Shakur, only made one appearance on the soundtrack.\n\n#89. High School Musical 3: Senior Year\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Nov. 8, 2008\n\nThe \"High School Musical\" franchise ranks among the most successful in Disney Channel's history. Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, and the rest of the gang came back with an arsenal of hit tracks on the soundtrack for \"High School Musical 3: Senior Year.\" Peaking at #2 on the Billboard 200, the album spent a total of 37 weeks on the chart.\n\n#88. New Jack City\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: May 25, 1991\n\n\"New Jack City\" is the story of an inner-city drug kingpin and the cop trying to take him down. Playing the cop is actor and rapper Ice-T, who was still in the midst of a formidable hip-hop career at the time of the film's release. He contributed one of the soundtrack's most infectious songs: \"New Jack Hustler.\" Also featured: Keith Sweat, Color Me Badd, and The 2 Live Crew.\n\n#87. Love Story\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: March 6, 1971\n\n\"Love Story\" is a tragic romance in which the city of Paris plays an important role. It was only natural that a seasoned French composer handle the music duties. That composer was Francis Lai, known for sweeping, melodramatic melodies. The album was a best-seller, and Lai won that year's Academy Award for Best Original Music Score.\n\n#86. Bye Bye Birdie\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Oct. 5, 1963\n\nHit Hollywood musicals and chart-topping soundtracks go hand in hand, as was the case with 1963's \"Bye Bye Birdie.\" Dick Van Dyke reprised his former Broadway role as aspiring songwriter Albert Peterson, providing numerous vocals for the soundtrack. Co-stars Janet Leigh, Bobby Rydell, and Ann-Margret are featured on the soundtrack as well.\n\n#85. Hairspray\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Aug. 11, 2007\n\nZac Efron was still part of the \"High School Musical\" universe when he starred in this popular 2007 adaptation of the Broadway play and cult film. He performed five songs on the best-selling soundtrack, including its lead single, \"Ladies' Choice.\" Fellow stars Nikki Blonsky, James Marsden, John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah, Ricki Lake, and Amanda Bynes also lend their vocals.\n\n#84. Romeo + Juliet\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Jan. 18, 1997\n\nBaz Luhrmann injected copious amounts of modern flair into this iconic adaptation of Shakespeare's famous tragedy. In addition to setting the story in a contemporary world, Luhrmann incorporated a soundtrack that hit the zeitgeist bullseye, featuring bands like Garbage and Radiohead. It was followed by a second soundtrack, which included the film's original score, snippets of dialogue, and leftover songs.\n\n#83. Chicago\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Feb. 8, 2003\n\nBased on the Broadway musical, \"Chicago\" was a veritable smash hit, making more than $300 million at the worldwide box office, and winning six Academy Awards. The soundtrack was a chart-topping, award-winning behemoth, featuring striking performances from the film's stars. One of its songs, \"All That Jazz,\" made the American Film Institute's list of the \"100 Greatest Songs in American Movies.\"\n\n#82. Star Wars\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Sept. 10, 1977\n\nCan you imagine the Star Wars franchise without the iconic themes from composer John Williams? Among his contributions: the \"Main Title\" theme, which first appeared on the original 1977 soundtrack, a double album that's been reissued numerous times. \"The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme),\" appeared on the soundtrack to 1980's \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"\n\n#81. Fifty Shades Of Grey\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Feb. 28, 2015\n\nTrue to the film, the \"Fifty Shades of Grey Original Soundtrack\" comes loaded with sultry songs from a range of contemporary artists. Two lead singles were released ahead of the album: \"Earned It\" by The Weeknd, and \"Love Me Like You Do\" by Ellie Goulding. Both singles reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the album itself peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200.\n\n#80. Cocktail\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Jan. 7, 1989\n\nBolstered by two #1 hit singlesâ€”\"Kokomo\" and \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\"â€”the \"Cocktail Original Soundtrack\" sold 4 million copies and became a fixture at parties across the country. In addition to those radio staples, the album features some classic cover tunes, including \"Rave On\" by John Cougar Mellencamp, \"Hippy Hippy Shake\" by the Georgia Satellites, and \"All Shook Up\" by Ry Cooder.\n\n#79. Romeo & Juliet (1969)\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: July 12, 1969\n\nThe soundtrack to Franco Zeffirelli's \"Romeo & Juliet\" was a major success, and Italian composer Nino Rota provided the film's most essential melodies. The soundtrack also includes snippets of dialogue from Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, who played the two lead roles.\n\n#78. Space Jam\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: April 5, 1997\n\nLook no further than the \"Space Jam Original Soundtrack\" for an iconic lineup of late '90s R&B artists like D'Angelo, R. Kelly, Monica, Seal, and Salt-N-Pepa. Ultimately, the album went platinum six times, thanks to the strength of its lead single: \"I Believe I Can Fly.\"\n\n#77. Forrest Gump\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Aug. 13, 1994\n\nGiven that \"Forrest Gump\" chronicled some of the country's most formative moments, it was only natural that the soundtrack would follow suit. Virtually every song is a perennial radio staple, and quintessential track from each era. As a result, the soundtrack is essentially a compilation of America's greatest music.\n\n#76. Moana\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Jan. 21, 2017\n\nWhere there's a hit Disney movie, there's a hit soundtrack. Naturally, 2016's \"Moana\" was no exception to the ruleâ€”the soundtrack sold in massive numbers. Songwriting superstar Lin-Manuel Miranda (of \"Hamilton\" fame) wrote a number of the songs, including \"How Far I'll Go,\" which was nominated for both a Golden Globe and Academy Award.\n\nYou may also like: #1 rock songs of the 1970s\n\n#75. Beaches\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #2\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: June 10, 1989\n\nBette Midler lent her acting talent and vocal chops to 1988's \"Beaches,\" a film about the on-and-off relationship between two close friends. While her cover of oldies tune \"Under the Boardwalk\" was used to promote the film in advance, it was \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" that took the world by storm, peaking at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It's still considered one of Bette Midler's most popular songs.\n\n#74. Howard Stern Private Parts: The Album\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Mar 15, 1997\n\nIn 1997, the self-proclaimed \"King of All Media\" Howard Stern starred in \"Private Parts,\" an autobiographical film based on his memoir. While Stern is largely known for his quick wit and candid interview style, he's also a music aficionado. The movie soundtrack doesn't just feature a swath of classic songs, it has Stern himself performing vocals on two tracks.\n\n#73. Gridlock'd\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Feb. 15, 1997\n\nAnother popular release from Death Row Records, \"Gridlock'd\" featured Tupac Shakur on two tracks. Fellow labelmate Snoop Dogg joined Shakur for the song \"Wanted Dead or Alive.\" Shakur was murdered in Las Vegas before the movie and its soundtrack were released.\n\n#72. Glee: The Music, The Power Of Madonna (EP)\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: May 8, 2010\n\nOver the course of six seasons, the hit TV show \"Glee\" paid tribute to a slew of popular artists, including Madonna. On the adjoining EP releaseâ€”which reached #1 on the Billboard 200â€”the cast covered classic tunes \"Like a Prayer,\" \"Express Yourself,\" \"Vogue,\" and \"Like a Virgin.\" It was the first EP released from the show, followed by 10 others.\n\n#71. Loso's Way (Soundtrack)\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Aug. 15, 2009\n\nFor the most part, \"Loso's Way\" from rapper Fabolous is more a proper studio album than it is an official soundtrack. The Deluxe Edition includes a DVD featurette, starring Fabolous and Styles P, Jadakiss, Swizz Beatz, and DJ Khaled. In the short film, Fabolous is shot while leaving a restaurant, and encounters a run-in with the police on his way to the hospital. Naturally, the drama is all set to best-selling hip-hop music.\n\nYou may also like: 10 first-time Grammy nominees for 2024\n\n#70. Descendants\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Aug. 22, 2015\n\nWhen the Disney Channel's \"Descendants\" franchise was initially conceived, it reportedly wasn't supposed to be a musical. Once accomplished choreographer Kenny Ortega was brought on board, however, things went in a different direction. The rest is chart-topping soundtrack history.\n\n#69. The Hunger Games: Songs From District 12 And Beyond\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: April 7, 2012\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" franchise kicked off in 2012, raking in more than $690 million at the worldwide box office, and cementing Jennifer Lawrence's A-list status. \"The Hunger Games: Songs From District 12 And Beyond\" includes a number of songs inspired byâ€”but not featured inâ€”the film, performed by Arcade Fire, Maroon Five, Neko Case, Taylor Swift, and others.\n\n#68. Bad Boys II\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Aug 2, 2003\n\nWill Smith and Martin Lawrence reprised their roles as hilarious Miami cops in Michael Bay's \"Bad Boys II,\" with a soundtrack featuring Notorious B.I.G., Justin Timberlake, Snoop Dogg, BeyoncÃ©, and Jay-Z. The song \"Shake Ya Tailfeather,\" spent four weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.\n\n#67. Glee: The Music, Journey To Regionals (EP)\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: June 26, 2010\n\nOn the heels of the Madonna EP came \"Glee: The Music, Journey To Regionals,\" which included six songs from the season one finale. Released on the same day the episode aired, the album contains covers of three Journey songs, one Queen song, a Lulu song, and \"Over the Rainbow\" from the \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Needless to say, fans were all over it.\n\n#66. Roustabout\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Jan. 2, 1965\n\nThe King of Rock appears on the soundtrack to 1964's \"Roustabout.\" The film follows Presley signing up for the circus, with the soundtrack featuring songs like \"It's Carnival Time\" and \"Carny Town.\" Like any number of Elvis Presley albums, this one proved incredibly popular. Meanwhile, the film itself is considered to be one of the music legend's better big-screen endeavors.\n\nYou may also like: Bestselling musicians of the '70s, then and now\n\n#65. Fifty Shades Darker\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: March 4, 2017\n\nAnother \"Fifty Shades\" movie means another hit soundtrack of seductive songs. This time, artists like Taylor Swift, Rita Ora, Corinne Bailey Rae, Halsey, Nick Jonas, and Nicki Minaj contribute to the famously risque franchise. \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" by Taylor Swift and Zayn Malik was the album's lead single, breaking the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Some of score composer Danny Elfman's theme music is also included on the soundtrack, though his complete score was released as a separate album.\n\n#64. A Star Is Born (Soundtrack)\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Oct. 20, 2018\n\n\"A Star Is Born\" was up for Top Soundtrack at this year's Billboard Music Awards (May 1), but lost to \"The Greatest Showman.\" The performance at the 2019 Academy Awards between Lady Gaga and the movie's producer, director, and star Bradley Cooper was a performance to remember. Cooper hinted on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Shows\" that he seeks to reunite with Lady Gaga in a one-night-only performance featuring all the songs (and reading of the script) from the movie.\n\n#63. Pitch Perfect 2\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: May 30, 2015\n\nLike \"Glee\" for the big screen, the \"Pitch Perfect\" franchise centers on the world's most dysfunctional a capella group, and retains a massive fanbase. A number of those fans scooped up the soundtrack to the second installment, which features abridged covers of \"Wrecking Ball,\" \"Thong Song,\" \"Bootylicious,\" and \"Lady Marmalade.\" Side effects of listening may include spontaneous outbursts into song and dance.\n\n#62. Dreamgirls\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Jan. 20, 2007\n\nOriginally a Broadway hit, \"Dreamgirls\" became an award-winning box-office smash in 2006. Appearing in the film and on the soundtrack are Jennifer Hudson, BeyoncÃ©, and Jamie Foxx. Eddie Murphyâ€”who had once released a hit single in the mid-1980sâ€”also lends vocals to a few songs. The soundtrack was released in both one- and two-disc versions, with the latter including every song from the film, plus a few bonus tracks.\n\n#61. Empire: Original Soundtrack From Season 1\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: March 28, 2015\n\nFox's \"Empire\" came out swinging in its first season, setting sordid drama against stirring music. Thanks to the first season's favorable reviews, Columbia Records released an official soundtrack, which likewise garnered no shortage of acclaim from fans and critics alike. Numerous seasons and soundtracks followed.\n\n#60. Les Miserables\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Jan. 19, 2013\n\nIn 2012, this Broadway musical arrived on the big screen with a bevy of stars, including Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe, Eddie Redmayne, Amanda Seyfried, and Sacha Baron Cohen. For the soundtrack, each cast member performed classics like \"Master of the House,\" \"I Dreamed a Dream,\" and \"On My Own.\"\n\n#59. Murder Was The Case\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Nov. 5, 1994\n\nAudiences might not remember much about the 18-minute short film, \"Murder Was the Case,\" in which Snoop Dogg makes a deal with the devil in order to avoid death. The soundtrack rendered a greater impression, thanks to tracks like \"Natural Born Killaz\" by Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, and \"What Would You Do\" by The Dogg Pound. Ironically, it was The Dogg Pound's songâ€”and not Dre and Cube's songâ€”that was featured on the soundtrack to Oliver Stone's \"Natural Born Killers\" the same year.\n\n#58. Miami Vice\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Nov. 2, 1985\n\nIn the mid-1980s, \"Miami Vice\" was the quintessence of cool, as was its chart-topping soundtrack. After opening with Jan Hammer's iconic theme music, the album dives into a number of cultural artifacts, such as \"You Belong to the City\" by Glenn Frey, and \"In the Air Tonight\" by Phil Collins.\n\n#57. Batman (Soundtrack)\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: July 22, 1989\n\nBefore Christopher Nolan's celebrated trilogy, there was Tim Burton's \"Batman,\" and its best-selling soundtrack by Prince. While the album is among Prince's lesser efforts, it does contact the hit single, \"Batdance,\" which gave way to a massively popular music video. Danny Elfman's iconic score was released as a separate album.\n\n#56. Michael Jackson's This Is It (Soundtrack)\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Nov. 14, 2009\n\nKing of pop Michael Jackson was in the midst of mounting a major comeback tour before his untimely passing in 2009. In the wake of his death, \"This Is It\" was released as a documentary, taking viewers behind the scenes as Jackson and his troupe prepared for the tour. The film came with a two-disc soundtrack, featuring the singer's greatest hits.\n\n#55. The Sting\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: May 4, 1974\n\n\"The Sting Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" is loaded with great ragtime melodies, with one tune in particular: Scott Joplin's \"The Entertainer.\" This instrumental is performed by Marvin Hamlisch, and helps establish an old-timey atmosphere, even if ragtime wasn't particularly popular during the 1930s.\n\n#54. 8 Mile\n\n- Highest rank on Billboard 200: #1\n\n- Date of soundtrack peak: Nov. 16, 2002\n\nThe soundtrack for rapper Eminem's semi-autobiographical \"8 Mile,\" was an irrefutable success. The standout track: \"Lose Yourself,\" which broke a record in becoming the longest-running #1 rap single of all time. The soundtrack also includes songs from Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Xzibit, and others.\n\n#53.
