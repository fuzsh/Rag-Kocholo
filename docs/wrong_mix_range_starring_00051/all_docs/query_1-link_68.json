        "text": "2020 was a strange year for movies with the majority of releases jumping ship for 2021 or beyond. A lot of movies went to streaming instead of theaters or after a shortened theatrical run. I’m praying movie theaters can make a comeback. There were also fewer major motion pictures released in 2020 and the first few months of 2021. This is a fact many people cite when discussing the Academy Awards. However, it’s not like the Oscars are scraping the bottom of the barrel (even though nominations for Hilbilly Elegy feel like it). The Academy still snubbed several amazing movies and performances. My beloved Tenet, my #1 movie of the year, only received two technical nominations. I had really hoped this would finally be Christopher Nolan’s year. One of my early picks for the Oscars this year were the performances in Never Rarely Sometimes Always which was completely ignored. One Night for Miami was snubbed for Best Picture and Best Director. Which is unbelievable given how much Hollywood loves Regina King. Da 5 Bloods was almost completely ignored with critics reeling that Delroy Lindo was denied a nomination. I really wanted to see Hugh Laurie get a Best Supporting Actor nomination for The Personal History of David Copperfield. And at least a screenplay nomination for Palm Springs. The plus side is that the Academy chose to honor smaller films this year and celebrate diversity.\n\nHere are the nominees:\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah\n\nThis movie is nominated for Best Picture, Actor in a Supporting Role (Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield), Original Song (“Fight For You”), Original Screenplay, and Cinematography. It will be hard for any picture to beat Nomadland, but this is the one that could do it. I knew it was going to make it to the Oscars from the powerful trailer alone. I was glad to see Stanfield finally pick up a nomination after being ignored the whole awards race. Kaluuya is a lock after winning the Golden Globe and Critic’s Choice awards for his portrayal of Black Panther chairman Fred Hampton.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters and available to rent digitally.\n\n2019 was an eclectic year for movies. I want to end 2019 and the awards season by sharing some of my favorite scenes. Not all of my favorite movies are represented. But these are some of the scenes that will stick with me the longest. I thought about making this a Top 10 list but decided not to restrict myself. There were just too many good scenes this year.\n\n1. Parasite, “Mission Impossible”.\n\nIn Parasite, a poor family slowly insinuates themselves into a rich family’s lives. One of the movie’s most suspenseful scenes involves the poor family framing the maid so that they can replace her. The way they pull it off is precise and ingenious.\n\n2. Ford v Ferrari, fight scene\n\nMatt Damon and Christian Bale have the most hilarious fist fight. The longer this scene goes on, the better it gets. There’s much to love about this film, but this scene is the reason I’ll own a copy of the Blu-ray.\n\n3. *SPOILER* in Yesterday\n\nRobert Carlyle has a surprise cameo as John Lennon. We get to find out what John Lennon would be like at 78, if he had lived, if he hadn’t been assassinated. This is the kind of magic that only the movies can give you.\n\n4. The opening of Marriage Story\n\nThe movie starts with both characters stating what they love about each other. The dual montage is beautiful and tells not only a love story but the story of a marriage and a family.\n\n5. Judy, the finale\n\nAt my showing, one poor lady got up and left the theater as Renée Zellweger began to sing “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” First of all, why did you come to this movie if you didn’t want to hear Judy Garland’s most popular song? But more importantly, she missed one of the greatest movie endings of the year. Judy gets choked up and can’t finish the song. So the audience sings it to her. It’s so emotional and beautiful.\n\n6. Avengers: Endgame, “Avengers, assemble!”\n\nMarvel fans waited over a decade to hear Cap utter that classic battle cry from the comics. And the wait was worth it. Seeing every Marvel hero together on the battlefield was amazing.\n\n7. Brittany Runs a Marathon, Meet Brittany\n\nIn her first scene, clowning around as an usher at a theater, it’s impossible not to fall in love with Jillian Bell. She has you in her pocket for the rest of the film. You can’t help but root for her on her journey.\n\n8. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, Mr Rogers comes to visit\n\nFred Rogers was a humble man. But he had to know what his presence meant to people. The scene where Mr. Rogers visits journalist Larry Vogel and his father Jerry at Jerry’s deathbed is simply heartwarming. The entire family is starstruck. Mr. Rogers spends the day visiting with them, taking pictures, even finding words to give Jerry’s experience meaning. It is a kind act that makes a huge difference to the Vogel family. And pethaps it is a reminder of the power of kindness.\n\n9. John Wick 3, knife fight\n\nThe knife fight in this movie is worth the price of admission alone. It’s fast paced, intense, and insane. It’s everything you want in an action film. And they don’t save it for the final battle. They bust it out early in the movie. It’s the highlight of the entire film.\n\n10. Us, the mirror scene\n\nElisabeth Moss is like a child seeing a mirror for the first time, taken with her own beauty, then horrified. Her character is so human in that scene. You could start to have pity for the Tethered.\n\n11. 1917 SPOILER\n\nCorporal Blake’s death scene stood out as one of the saddest, most shocking, realest moments on screen all year. It’s every bit as shocking as *SPOILER* Janet Leigh’s death in Psycho. We are left without our hero, the character we’ve been rooting for. The floor has been pulled out from under us. The scene drives home the horrors and randomness of war while also moving the plot forward. The mission is now more important than ever and it rests in the hands of poor, unfortunate George Mackay. Mackay will get a Best Actor nomination some day. It’s a shame it won’t be for this role.\n\n12. Frozen II, Olaf recaps Frozen\n\nOlaf gets some of the best scenes in the movie, including his solo number “When I Am Older.” However, my favorite is his one-snowman reenactment of the entire first movie. Like so much of what comes from Olaf, it’s funny and unexpected. And a movie moment I’ll remember for a long time. (After the credits, he does one for Frozen II. If you used the RunPee, app, you’d know that already.)\n\n13. Teen Spirit, the walk to the stage.\n\nThis was the first scene of the year I fell in love with. Elle Fanning is about to compete for the last time on a singing competition. We feel every suspenseful step from the dressing room to the stage because we take it with her. A wonderfully shot sequence.\n\n14.. The end of Toy Story 4\n\nIt’s a bittersweet end to the beloved series. Woody, Forky, and Gabby Gabby all find the place they each belong though it’s not where either of them thought.\n\nStay up to date with the latest movie news by subscribing to the newsletter and liking our Facebook page.\n\nI was happy to see so many movies I loved this year nominated across so many different categories. Not every year is like this. It was a strong class of Best Picture nominees this year. It was a fun, eclectic group of films.\n\nBefore I dive into the Oscar ceremony, I’d like to share a few of my favorite moments from the red carpet.\n\nBilly Porter asked Janelle Monáe about her role in the movie Harriet. He said, “What do you feel is the most important takeaway from the movie?”\n\nShe said, “I think the important takeaway is to listen to black women. When we are in positions of leadership, when we have your support, we can do the unthinkable, we can do the impossible.”\n\nLin-Manuell Miranda revealed he is writing four new songs for The Little Mermaid live action movie. He also said that Andrew Garfield will be playing RENT creator Jonathan Larson in Miranda’s directorial debut, an adaptation of Larson’s autobiographical musical Tick, Tick…Boom. He also mentioned that HBO has acquired the rights to the Sundance documentary Siempre Luis about the work of his father. (Oh, and if you haven’t heard yet, Disney is releasing Hamilton to theaters on Oct 15, 2021. Mark your calendars! I smell a Best Picture contender.). About his father, Miranda says “I’m the slacker.” Hard to believe.\n\nLilly Aldridge interviewed Renée Zellweger, asking her what drew her to the role of Judy Garland. Zellweger said, “I didn’t know so much about the circumstances of her life and her early life...and this film was an opportunity to sort of contextualize those circumstances, to sort of subvert the notion that her life was tragic. When you look at what she overcame again and agsin, her tenacity, that she was able to give on such high levels and perform on such high levels for such a sustained period of time, she’s heroic.”\n\nAldridge asked her how it felt singing “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” and if she was nervous doing it.\n\nZellweger replied, “Sure. Oh gosh, yeah. Sure. But by the time we filmed that, we had been working at the Hackney Empire with all the actors who play the audience for a week. And we shared stories about Judy and what her legacy meant to each of us and how she touched each of us personally. And so, in that momemt, that was sort of like the confluence of all of that love that we had sort of been throwing around about Judy. And it was very moving to think about her singing that song in her younger days as a child. And then later on in her life how she’s still singing about hope but that it’s a more courageous hope. It just moved me tremendously.”\n\nThe ceremony opened with Janelle Monáe dressed as Mr. Rogers and singing the theme song. She then burst out into a more lively number with back up dancers including clowns, pimps, and others. She made references to films that had been snubbed, including Midsommar, Dolemite Is My Name, Us, and Hustlers.\n\nPerformance by an actor in a leading role:\n\nAntonio Banderas in PAIN AND GLORY\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio in ONCE UPON A TIME...IN HOLLYWOOD\n\nAdam Driver in MARRIAGE STORY\n\nJoaquin Phoenix in JOKER\n\nJonathan Pryce in THE TWO POPES\n\nIt’s unbelievable that we have two heavyweights celebrating their first Oscar nominations in this category. Antonio Banderas gives a nuanced, lived-in performance as a gay filmmaker looking back at his life in Pain and Glory. Jonathan Pryce plays an unconventional cardinal in a role that’s hard not to like in The Two Popes. I’m pretty torn because I love Pryce as an actor and I was rooting for him to get a nomination last year for The Wife. I can’t deny The Two Popes is a good movie and Pryce and Hopkins are both good in it. (Granted, I like the beginning of it more than the second half.). However, there are movies and performances I liked a lot better this year that I’d rather have seen nominated. Once Upon a Time is overrated and it’s some of Tarantino’s lesser work. The Academy loves it because it’s about Hollywood. Besides, DiCaprio already has his Oscar. Even if it is for one of his worst movies. I’ve been an Adam Driver fan for a long time and I’m glad to see him get his second nomination, his first for a lead performance. Joaquin Phoenix is favored to win and I would be fine with that. He was amazing in Joker. And he was overlooked for Inherent Vice and Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot, both wonderful performances.\n\nSnubs in this category include:\n\nTaron Egerton in Rocketman\n\nEddie Murphy in Dolemite Is My Name\n\nRoman Griffin Davis in Jojo Rabbit\n\nAdam Sandler in Uncut Gems\n\nKang-ho Song in Parasite\n\nRobert Downey Jr in Avengers: Endgame\n\nChristian Bale in Ford v Ferrari\n\nMatt Damon in Ford v Ferrari\n\nGeorge MacKay in 1917\n\nRobert De Niro in The Irishman\n\nMichael B. Jordan in Just Mercy\n\nThe one that makes me angriest is Taron Egerton. He did just as well as Rami Malek in bringing a rock icon to life onscreen. And he did his own singing! Eddie Murphy is having an amazing career comeback. Maybe that’s its own reward, but it still would have been nice to have some official recognition. When it comes to child actors, the Academy tends to honor young women instead of young men so it’s not surprising Roman Griffin Davis didn’t make the cut. But his work in Jojo Rabbit is nothing short of astounding for a young actor. Adam Sandler gets the same raw deal that Jim Carrey always got. Because he’s a comedian and the Academy doesn’t approve of his sillier films, they won’t reward his more artistic ones. Man on the Moon and Punch Drunk Love both should have gotten Best Actor nominations. Parasite is riding a wave of so much love, I’m surprised it didn’t bleed into any of the acting categories. There was a group of dedicated Marvel fans hoping Robert Downey Jr might get a nomination for his final role as Iron Man in Endgame. Sadly, we did not get our wish. Christian Bale and Matt Damon were my second favorite couple on screen this year after Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever in Booksmart; their chemistry was simply magic. George MacKay carries most of 1917 and some day he’ll probably carry an Oscar home. Sadly, it won’t be this year. Somehow, everyone from The Irishman got nominated but De Niro. Like clockwork, about every two years or so Michael B. Jordan gets robbed of an Oscar nomination (Fruitvale Station, Creed, Black Panther).\n\nBest Motion Picture of the Year:\n\nFORD V FERRARI\n\nPeter Chernin, Jenno Topping and James Mangold, Producers\n\nTHE IRISHMAN\n\nMartin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Jane Rosenthal and Emma Tillinger Koskoff, Producers\n\nJOJO RABBIT\n\nCarthew Neal and Taika Waititi, Producers\n\nJOKER\n\nTodd Phillips, Bradley Cooper and Emma Tillinger Koskoff, Producers\n\nLITTLE WOMEN\n\nAmy Pascal, Producer\n\nMARRIAGE STORY\n\nNoah Baumbach and David Heyman, Producers\n\n1917\n\nSam Mendes, Pippa Harris, Jayne-Ann Tenggren and Callum McDougall, Producers\n\nONCE UPON A TIME...IN HOLLYWOOD\n\nDavid Heyman, Shannon McIntosh and Quentin Tarantino, Producers\n\nPARASITE\n\nKwak Sin Ae and Bong Joon Ho, Producers\n\nFord v Ferrari: tell me this, Academy; how does one of the year’s best pictures not have any of the year’s best performances in it? At least you recognize it’s a great film. Again, Once Upon a Time is overrated. I’ll be disappointed if it takes Best Picture. I liked Little Women. I didn’t love it. Everything else on the list, I’m pretty happy with. I still feel like 1917 is a spoiler that came late to the party, though. My personal prejudice. I feel like if I’d been allowed to see it earlier in the year and fall in love with it around the same time as the rest of these films, I might have warmer feelings for it. Having to wait until after the Globes to see it has soured me on it a little. I’m happy to see Parasite in the Best Picture race. It’s not always easy for a foreign film to get into this category.\n\nSnubs include:\n\nA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\n\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon\n\nBrittany Runs a Marathon\n\nBooksmart\n\nAvengers: Endgame\n\nUs\n\nThe Report\n\nThe Two Popes\n\nBombshell\n\nThe Farewell\n\nRichard Jewell\n\nHoney Boy\n\nI’ve made my case for most of these films already. The others are movies that are nominated in other categories but somehow not worthy of a Best Picture nomination. If you haven’t seen The Peanut Butter Falcon, it’s the sleeper hit of the year and it’s a real hart warming comedy. Please seek it out. It’s a lot of fun.\n\nAchievement in production design:\n\nTHE IRISHMAN\n\nProduction Design: Bob Shaw\n\nSet Decoration: Regina Graves\n\nJOJO RABBIT\n\nProduction Design: Ra Vincent\n\nSet Decoration: Nora Sopková\n\n1917\n\nProduction Design: Dennis Gassner\n\nSet Decoration: Lee Sandales\n\nONCE UPON A TIME...IN HOLLYWOOD\n\nProduction Design: Barbara Ling\n\nSet Decoration: Nancy Haigh\n\nPARASITE\n\nProduction Design: Lee Ha Jun\n\nSet Decoration: Cho Won Woo\n\nThese are all worthy nominees. I’m rooting for Parasite. The look of that house was perfect.\n\nBest animated short film:\n\nDCERA (DAUGHTER)\n\nDaria Kashcheeva\n\nHAIR LOVE\n\nMatthew A. Cherry and Karen Rupert Toliver\n\nKITBULL\n\nRosana Sullivan and Kathryn Hendrickson\n\nMEMORABLE\n\nBruno Collet and Jean-François Le Corre\n\nSISTER\n\nSiqi Song\n\nDcera is an avant-garde film from the Czech Republic that I was not impressed with. Hair Love is a cute, funny cartoon about a father trying to learn how to take care of his daughter’s hair in the mother’s absence. Kitbull is an adorable, heartwarming tale from Pixar about a cat and dog that become friends. (You can watch it on Disney Plus.). Memorable is a bittersweet film about an artist losing his memory to dementia and the wife that has to take care of him. Sister is a man’s recollections about his younger sister but the film has a dark twist to it. I’m rooting for Hair Love or Kitbull.\n\nBest live action short film:\n\nBROTHERHOOD\n\nMeryam Joobeur and Maria Gracia Turgeon\n\nNEFTA FOOTBALL CLUB\n\nYves Piat and Damien Megherbi\n\nTHE NEIGHBORS’ WINDOW\n\nMarshall Curry\n\nSARIA\n\nBryan Buckley and Matt Lefebvre\n\nA SISTER\n\nDelphine Girard\n\nBrotherhood is about a man who betrays his family out of prejudice. Nefta Football Club is a comedy about two young boys who stumble onto a stash of drugs. The Neighbors’ Window is sort of like an O. Henry story about two couples. Saria is based on a real life tragedy that claimed the life of 41 orphan girls. A Sister is about a a woman who has been abducted and calls an emergency line while pretending she is calling her sister. I’m rooting for A Sister to win.\n\nThe ever humble Hanks said “Most of these people I would pay to see get their car washed.” He got choked up as he said, “A man is blessed with a family like that,” indicating his wife and children. He spoke about his influences, from his contemporaries to his predecessors.\n\nHe said, “A movie is made shot by shot. And at that moment what is required is everybody has to do their job to their perfection. They have to hit a mark, and they have to go there. Sometimes the movie rests on the shoulders of the makeup artists who put on Stella Skarsgard’s eyebrows. Sometimes it’s the focus puller that if it isn’t sharp, you don’t have it, and it shows up and you have to do it all over again. But it’s those moments as an actor where everybody I’ve ever worked with has helped me get to that place. Sometimes it’s three o’clock in the morning, and sometimes it’s 11 at night in which you just have to somehow put it all together, have faith in what the process is and go there.\n\nA thousand years ago, in 1977, when I was an intern at the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival, my first professional job, we all got yelled at by Dan Sullivan, the director. We had partied a little bit too much the night before, we were showing up for rehearsals, and he screamed at us, well he did actually scream at us. He said, \"Hey, look, you guys, you guys, you actors, you know what your job is? You know what your job is? You have got to show up on time, and you have to know the text, and you have to have a head full of ideas. Otherwise I can't do my job.\" That was the greatest lesson a young actor could possibly ever get. First of all, the head full of ideas. Bring anything, try anything. They might not use it. If it stinks, they won't use it. Am I right, Marty Scorsese? If it's not good—boy, let's see the outtakes from that movie, by the way.\n\nKnowing the text, and it's not just your lines, it's the whole thing, it's the red dot, it's the theme of the movie. You've got to know it. You might not be right in what the opinion that you bring to it, but you've got to come at it with some direction. And as Charlize might know, and some of the other people who've worked with us through the Playtone galaxy of stars, showing up on time is one of the greatest liberating acts you can give yourself in a movie. That means those people with radios in the ears don't need to knock on your door and say, \"They're ready for you.\" You're actually already ready, and you have the liberty and you have the freedom of being there early enough to settle down because when the time comes, you have to hit the marks, and you have to go there.”\n\nSam Mendes won Best Director for 1917. I consider this an upset. The movie doesn’t open until later this week, so I haven’ t had a chance to see it yet. And I love Sam Mendes as much as the next guy. I was a huge fan of American Beauty and I love the Bond films Skyfall and Spectre. Speaking of Tom Hanks, I also love Road to Perdition. (You need to see it if you haven’t) However, I can’t imagine that 1917 is as moving and original as Parasite or as awesome as The Irishman.\n\nSnubs in this category include:\n\nMarie Heller, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\n\nThere were several notable women mentioned as contenders for Best Director (Greta Gerwig for Little Women, Alma Har’el for Honey Boy) but this is the one I’m going to bat for. Heller is building quite an impressive filmography as the HFPA and the Academy openly ignore her. Each of her films is significantly different from the other. The fact that Scorsese made another three hour plus gangster epic surprises exactly no one. That Heller chose a biopic of Mister Rogers as her next project after the darkly comic Can You Ever Forgive Me? is more of a creative leap. Here’s hoping she gets her comeuppance soon. Similarly, I’m not sure Tarantino made me feel anything half as tender as A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood did. And he had three hours to get across whatever emotions he wanted to convey.\n\nJordan Peele, Us See my previous comments.\n\nAnthony and Joe Russo, Avengers: Endgame They masterfully brought a twelve year saga to a close.\n\nTaika Waititi, Jojo Rabbit He found the perfect tone for this darkly funny yet sweet film.\n\nJames Mangold, Ford v Ferrari Those amazing, suspenseful car races didn’t direct themselves.\n\nJoker won Best Original Score. I don’t have strong feelings about this category. It would have been nice for Motherless Brooklyn to win something. Hildur Guðnadóttir became the first solo female to win Best Original Score.\n\nBrad Pitt won Best Supporting Actor. I’d rather have seen Tom Hanks win for his gentle turn as Fred Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood or Joe Pesci for The Irishman. In his acceptance speech, Pitt thanked Leonardo DiCaprio and said, “I would’ve shared the raft.” He also said, “If you see a chance to be kind to someone tomorrow, take it. I think we need it.” Pitt also won for Best Supporting Actor in 1996 for 12 Monkeys.\n\nSnubs in this category include:\n\nJohn Lithgow’s understated turn in Late Night\n\nRobert Carlyle’s surprising and delightful cameo in Yesterday\n\nRob Brydon who’s a father figure to the main character in Blinded by the Light\n\nShia LaBeouf who tugs at your heartstrings in The Peanut Butter Falcon\n\nJamie Bell as faithful friend and songwriting partner Bernie Taupin in Rocketman\n\nBill Hader who is the surprising heart of It Chapter Two\n\nWillem Dafoe who entertainingly chews the scenery in The Lighthouse\n\nSam Rockwell as a darkly funny Nazi who commits one kind act in Jojo Rabbit\n\nShia LaBeouf for his cathartic turn playing his own father in Honey Boy\n\nNoah Jupe for the other most impressive child acting job I’ve seen all year in Honey Boy\n\nTaron Egerton won Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical for Rocketman. It was his first nomination and win. He thanked Elton John for the music and for living a life less ordinary. I’m pretty satisfied with this win. I’d have been okay with Eddie Murphy winning for Dolemite Is My Name or Roman Griffin Davis for Jojo Rabbit.\n\nAnd now, the best movies of the year so far…according to everyone else.\n\nA.V.

The Telluride Film Festival is over and the Toronto International Film Festival ends tomorrow. The Oscar buzz is starting. To stay in the loop with all the movie news and reviews, sign up for the newsletter and follow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/EtchedinGold/\n\nLast year, rock ‘n’ roll biopic Bohemian Rhapsody broke records at the box office, won Best Actor at the Oscars, and nearly won Best Picture. Could Rocketman, the new biopic about Elton John, pull off the same feat? It may not pull in the same numbers. It made half of what Bohemian Rhapsody did on opening weekend. However, it definitely has a shot at the Oscars. With the exception of Jordan Peele’s Us and the extreme longshot of Captain Marvel or Avengers: Endgame getting a nomination, Rocketman is probably the first Best Picture nominee of the year. At least, the first one available for regular Joes like us to see. Plenty of potential nominees have already screened at Sundance, Cannes, and other festivals by now. So what makes Rocketman special?\n\nA Strong Script\n\nThe script by Lee Hall ditches the paint by numbers formula of most biopics. The film uses an outer frame story of John attending an AA meeting and telling his story to jump back and forth in time. It also contains fantastical moments such as when everyone in the room is lifted into the air during “Crocodile Rock.” As the tagline for the movie says, “The only way to tell his story is to live his fantasy.”\n\nTaron Egerton’s Performance\n\nIf you had asked me if I had seen a living actor who could play Elton John, I would have told you no. Until I saw Taron Egerton in the previews for this movie. He looks and sounds like Elton. And he gives an amazing performance. This is his graduation from genre films. From now on, he is a force to be reckoned with. And if he is snubbed by the Academy, it’s a damn shame. Whatever the next six months hold, this IS one of the best performances of the year and deserves to be celebrated.\n\nAuthenticity\n\nThe filmmakers went for an R-rating so they could be true to John’s story and include drugs, alcohol, and gay sex. Bohemian Rhapsody made Freddie Mercury a scapegoat and was almost afraid to focus on his gayness. Rocketman is a lot more fearless. It shows Elton kissing men, making love, even an uncomfortable moment with songwriting partner Bernie Taupin. I know it may seem odd to compare Bohemian Rhapsody to Rocketman since they have the same director, Dexter Fletcher. However, they have different screenwriters, Fletcher only took over Boho Rhapsody after Bryan Singer was fired from the project, and Mercury was not around to have a hand in his own movie while Elton John was. The difference this makes is significant."
