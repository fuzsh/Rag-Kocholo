        "text": "Ursula Andress\n\nBack in 1962, Sean Connery rocked the world with his legendary depiction of the suave and charismatic spy, James Bond. The MI6 agent is known for meeting and connecting with one lucky girl in every film, and Ursula Andress was one of them. The actress was the world’s first Bond girl.\n\nAndress’ voice was actually dubbed in the film due to her Swiss-German accent, but that didn’t stop her from becoming one of the most famous actresses in Hollywood at the time. She later worked for Playboy magazine, posing in some very provocative shots. Quite a bold move in the ‘60s.\n\nVivien Leigh\n\nNot many actresses can claim that their biggest flaw is being too beautiful, but that’s exactly what happened to Vivien Leigh. The young and talented star was often overlooked when it came to her acting abilities, simply because people saw her first and foremost for her looks.\n\nHer most famous film appearances to date were in 'Gone with the Wind' and 'A Streetcar Named Desire', which are some of the most iconic and legendary films from the 20th century. Unfortunately, the actress and performer died from tuberculosis in 1967, but her Hollywood legacy lives on even today.\n\nSharon Tate\n\nFans of Sharon Tate will forever remember her story as a tragic one. The talented and beautiful actress led a very troubled life, which included marrying famous director and fugitive sex-offender, Roman Polanski. In 1969, Tate was murdered in cold blood by members of the Manson Family.\n\nWhat makes her death even more tragic is that the actress was due to give birth at the time, and was nearly nine months pregnant. She is still talked about in entertainment circles today, and is remembered for her astonishing beauty, supreme acting skills and horrendous fate.\n\nLauren Bacall\n\nWhile many women have dazzling looks, not many also have a seductive voice to match. Lauren Bacall shared both of these traits, and was named the 20th greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema. In 1996, she received an Academy Award for her performance in 'The Mirror Has Two Faces'.\n\nThe actress was a staunch liberal Democrat and devoted much of her public status to promote various political causes. She was also a model and often appeared in popular magazines such as Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue. The actress passed away in mid-2014, a month before her 90th birthday.\n\nBarbara Eden\n\nBarbara Eden was born in 1931 and remains a beloved personality in Hollywood even today. The actress is known for starring as \"Jeannie\" in the sitcom 'I Dream of Jeannie'. The show revolved around a 2,000-year-old genie (played by Eden) and an astronaut who falls in love with her.\n\nRumor has it that producers originally wanted a brunette for the show so that viewers would easily be able to tell the difference between it and its main competitor at the time - popular fantasy sitcom 'Bewitched'. However, they simply fell for Eden and just had to give her the role.\n\nClaudia Cardinale\n\nYou may recall Claudia Cardinale from the original 'The Pink Panther' film, back in 1963. She is an Italian-Tunisian actress who appeared in some of the most highly-acclaimed European films of the '60s and the '70s. She originally rose to fame as “The Most Beautiful Italian Girl in Tunisia.”\n\nEarlier in her career, the actress didn’t get to have her voice heard much, since it was often dubbed by other women. Eventually, her stardom grew to such levels that fans demanded to hear it! Cardinale is an avid women’s rights activist, and has been a UNESCO goodwill ambassador since 2000.\n\nAnita Ekberg\n\nFans of the beautiful actress Margot Robbie often compare her to Anita Ekberg, a Swedish actress who's best known for playing Sylvia in the Federico Fellini 1960 film, 'La Dolce Vita'. The actress was also a fashion model in her early years, which is no surprise, to say the least.\n\nShe competed in various modeling shows, from Miss Malmo to Miss Sweden, which she ended up winning. In 1951, Ekberg even won the Miss Universe crown. From there, she had to learn English to become an actress in America. The actress passed away in 2015, at the age of 83.\n\nJaclyn Smith\n\nIt's not every day that you see a woman who's as accomplished as Jaclyn Smith in so many fields. Smith is both an actress and a serious business woman. She is most known for starring as Kelly Garrett in the 'Charlie's Angels' TV show, which ran from 1976 until 1981.\n\nThe actress runs various brands of clothing and perfume and has even launched a wig collection back in 2008. Despite her many accomplishments, one of the things Jaclyn Smith is best known for is her incredible beauty. She regularly graces the pages of magazines’ ‘World’s Most Beautiful Woman’ polls.\n\nNatalie Wood\n\nNatalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko was a three-time Oscar-nominated actress before reaching 25 and proved to be one of the most promising actresses in Hollywood. The actress was born to Russian immigrant parents and began appearing in films when she was just four years old.\n\nThe actress starred alongside James Dean in 'Rebel Without a Cause'. Tragically, both she and the actor later passed away in some unfortunate circumstances. At 43 years old, Wood was found dead after drowning off a weekend yacht trip to Santa Catalina with her husband Robert Wagner and actor Christopher Walken.\n\nSophie Marceau\n\nFrench actress Sophie Marceau is best known for starring in the 1980 comedy film, 'La Boum'. The actress eventually became a serious star in European theaters, and quickly found herself in Hollywood circles. Marceau appeared in 'Braveheart' and was a Bond girl in 1999’s 'The World Is Not Enough'.\n\nIt’s rare to find a “most beautiful women” list that doesn’t feature Sophie Marceau. Marceau, however, doesn’t really understand what the fuss is all about, and claims that the way she sees it, she’s really not that beautiful at all. With all due respect, let’s agree to disagree, Sophie.\n\nAva Gardner\n\nAva Lavinia Gardner had to work extremely hard to become an actress, as she was often misunderstood for her heavy southern accent. She began acting in 1941, and appeared in small gigs before rising to prominence for her role in 1946's 'The Killers', based on a short story by Ernest Hemingway.\n\nFrom there on, Gardner's career only grew, and in 1951 she even married the legendary Frank Sinatra. Unfortunately, after a lifetime of smoking and at the hands of two strokes, the actress became paralyzed. Gardner died at age 67 from pneumonia, but remains a legendary figure in Hollywood to this day.\n\nJulie Gibson\n\nJulie Gibson just recently passed away in late 2019, at the incredible age of 106, in her Los Angeles home. You can definitely say that the artist, singer, TV performer, actress, and vocal coach lived a full life. Gibson’s acting career began in 1935 and lasted well into the '90s.\n\nThe actress was one of the most beloved personalities in Hollywood, and America in general, back in the ‘40s. She is best recognized for her role in the popular comedy show 'The Three Stooges'. Gibson also dubbed vocals for prominent actresses at the time, including Betty Hutton and Diana Lynn.\n\nKim Novak\n\nKim Novak is a retired actress and is widely known for starring as Madeleine Elster/Judy Barton in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 thriller, 'Vertigo', alongside James Stewart. She currently has two Golden Globe Awards, an Honorary Golden Bear Award, and even her own star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.\n\nThe actress faced many challenges throughout her life, including defeating a breast cancer diagnosis in 2010. Novak currently works as a painter and visual artist. Her beauty is almost unparalleled; in fact, she was originally brought into Columbia Pictures with the goal of competing with Marilyn Monroe for box-office success.\n\nAudrey Hepburn\n\nAudrey Hepburn was a British actress and humanitarian with an impressive portfolio. She worked alongside legendary actor, Gregory Peck, in 'Roman Holiday', and received a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, and an Academy Award for her incredible performances. The actress was also viewed as a fashion icon at the time.\n\nRecently, the American Film Institute ranked Hepburn as the third-greatest female actress in Golden Age Hollywood. She passed away in 1993 due to stomach cancer, but remains a popular influence in entertainment circles for her acting and social impact to this day.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer\n\nAt age 61, actress Michelle Pfeiffer remains one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. She has appeared in an endless list of films, including 'Scarface', 'Stardust', and more. It was challenging for her to break out of the “pretty girl” typecast in the ‘70s, but it was worth the effort.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer’s beauty has often been described as the kind that you have to take a moment to marvel at, which we believe holds true even today. The actress has also produced a set of her own films, and is still acting and widely admired by a huge audience of fans even today.\n\nMarilyn Monroe\n\nNo list of the world’s most beautiful women is complete without Marilyn Monroe. Born in LA during the ‘20s, this young lady grew up to become one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950’s and early 60’s. Her short acting career lead to over $2 billion in revenues.\n\nThe talented model, actress and singer passed away at age 36. She lived a troubled life that was rife with depression and addictions, which ultimately led to her tragic ending. Monroe was known as the pioneer of women's sexual revolution, and will forever be remembered as its icon.\n\nHedy Lamarr\n\nHedy Lamarr was one of the world's most beloved Austrian-American actresses. She appeared in various classic MGM films, such as 'Lady of the Tropics', 'Boom Town', and 'White Cargo'. At age 18, the actress appeared in the romantic film ‘Ecstasy’, and became the first actress to have an on-screen orgasm.\n\nWhat made Lamarr unique was her second profession as an inventor. She was responsible for many inventions that helped the United States during World War II, and was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014. She was also married and divorced six times throughout her life.\n\nGrace Kelly\n\nThere is a long legacy of beautiful American film actresses marrying royalty from a variety of countries. Grace Kelly spent a few years as an actress, before retiring at 26 to marry Prince Rainier III. She subsequently became the Princess of Monaco, and played the role from 1956 to 1982.\n\nThe talented actress and princess had a rather unfortunate end though. While driving back to Monaco from her country home in Roc Agel, she had a stroke and lost control of her vehicle. Kelly passed away that day, and had one of the most publicized funerals in the world.\n\nJacqueline Bisset\n\nJacqueline Bisset rose to prominence during the '60s and '70s thanks to her roles in various crime and thriller films. The English-born actress speaks fluent English, French and Italian, and was recently bestowed with France's highest civilian honor, the Légion d'honneur. Bisset currently plays mostly in made-for-TV movies and shows.\n\nJacqueline Bisset is known for doing the world’s first wet T-shirt scene in the 1977 film 'The Deep'. The film remains one of the actress's most iconic achievements even today. It was a bold and unique move at the time, and made the film a huge box-office success.\n\nElizabeth Taylor\n\nElizabeth Taylor was one of Hollywood's last true icons. The actress was the first celebrity to launch her own perfume brand, and led many efforts to help combat AIDS. Taylor lived a unique, media-centered life and was married and divorced eight times. Nonetheless, nobody could get enough of the actress!\n\nShe began her career as a child star and quickly became one of the world’s most popular actresses. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Taylor the seventh-greatest female screen legend. Many fans wondered what her real eye color was, a topic which is still discussed today.\n\nIsabella Rossellini\n\nIsabella Rossellini, the beautiful daughter of Ingrid Bergman (who's also on the list) proved that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. The actress was born of Swedish - German descent, and has the looks to match. She is an actress, film maker, author, model, and philanthropist.\n\nRossellini has appeared in various fashion shows, modeling magazines and films. She was the spokesmodel of Lancôme for 14 years, and has won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead for her role in 1997’s 'Blue Velvet'. Fans love Rossellini for both her incredible talents and beauty.\n\nKim Basinger\n\nFor almost five decades, Kim Basinger has been a strong actress in Hollywood thanks to her unique acting skills and timeless beauty. The actress gained major prominence thanks to her role as a Bond girl in 1979's 'Never Say Never Again'. Basinger also recently appeared in 2017’s 'Fifty Shades Darker'.\n\nShe has since starred in everything from erotic films to Tim Burton's 'Batman', and still shows her talents in films today. Basinger is instantly recognizable thanks to her beautiful blue eyes, perfect face and long, flowing blonde hair.\n\nBarbara Parkins\n\nWhen the young Canadian Barbara Parkins asked her adopting mother to move with her to Los Angeles, she agreed. The 16 year old then embarked on a long journey towards film stardom. She began by studying at the Hollywood High School and developed her professional career from there.\n\nParkins initially offered herself as a professional singer, but was quickly discovered as a talented actress. At just 24 years of age, she had already been nominated for an Emmy, and continued acting well into her 70’s. The actress retired in 1998, but will always be remembered for her beauty and talent.\n\nJulie Ege\n\nNorwegian actress and model, Julie Ege, dominated British theaters in the ‘60s and ‘70s thanks to her powerful on-screen presence. She began her career as a model before turning 16, and came in second in the Miss Norway beauty pageant at just 18 years old.\n\nWhen Ege moved to England she was instantly liked by film directors. She started out in a few small roles, bolstered by her pageant fame. From there, Ege worked her way on to bigger roles. Her best known film role to date was in the 1971 comedy movie 'Up Pompeii'.\n\nSophia Loren\n\nWhile most people remember Sophia Loren's legacy for her bold feminist statements (such as keeping her armpits unshaven), she also had a dedicated fan base thanks to her beauty and acting skills. Loren started her acting career at age 14, and is still working today, well into her 80s.\n\nSome of the actress’s most beloved films include 'A Countess from Hong Kong', 'The Pride and the Passion', and 'Grumpier Old Men'. Throughout her film career, Loren has received an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, five special Golden Globes, and many other honors. She remains the only living classic female movie star.\n\nJane Birkin\n\nJane Birkin rose to prominence thanks to her decade-long relationship with Serge Gainsbourg, one of the world's most popular and important French singers and songwriters. She also had a highly successful acting career in both British and French cinemas, and was often coached by Gainsbourg.\n\nThe actress is known for acting in various popular films and TV shows, including 'Death on the Nile', 'Evil Under the Sun', and 'A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'.

Sellers proposed to her that very same week, and the two got married just 10 days later. Their marriage ended up lasting just four years.\n\nRaquel Welch\n\nIt was certainly an uphill battle for Raquel Welch before the media and audiences began noticing her in films. She started out in various small roles, and rose to prominence after appearing in the movie 'One Million Years B.C.', where she wore her iconic fur bikini.\n\nThings quickly picked up from there for the young actress, as she went on to appear in several more popular films, including 1967’s 'Bedazzled', 1968’s 'Bandolero!' and 1969’s '100 Rifles'. Welch's legacy is mostly centered around popularizing the strong female character type and changing gender relations in Hollywood.\n\nRita Hayworth\n\nRita Hayworth is best known as one of the most prominent sex symbols in Hollywood back in the '40s and '50s. She was described by the press as a \"Love Goddess\" and was the most featured pin-up girl for soldiers during World War II.\n\nHayworth’s most famous film role was in 1964's 'Gilda', where she played one of Hollywood's first \"femme fatales\".

The actress has always been involved in politics, and recently came out against the #MeToo movement, saying that it devolved into a witch-hunt at this point.\n\nIngrid Bergman\n\nIngrid Bergman not only lived a prominent Hollywood life, filled with various accolades, awards and honors, but also gave birth to an actress who continued her legacy.
