        "text": "Detox\n\nWhile trying to figure out why a young patient won't stop bleeding, House takes Cuddy's challenge and goes off Vicodin for a week in exchange for no clinic duty for a month. If House and his team can't determine the source of his patient's blood loss, the 16-year-old car accident victim will die in a matter of days. As House's withdrawal symptoms become more and more severe, his directives for his patient are more harsh and risky than usual, forcing Foreman and Cameron to fear he may not be thinking clearly enough to save the patient's life.\n\nPilot\n\nIn the wealthy, seaside community of Neptune, the rich and powerful make the rules. They own the town and the high school, and they desperately try to keep their dirty little secrets just that...secret. Unfortunately for them, there's Veronica Mars (series star KRISTEN BELL), a smart, fearless 17-year-old apprentice private investigator dedicated to solving the town's toughest mysteries. Veronica actually used to be one of the popular girls, walking the halls of Neptune High with the rest of the \"beautiful people.\" But it all came crumbling down around her after her best friend, Lilly, was murdered, and her then sheriff father, Keith (series star ENRICO COLANTONI), was removed from office for naming Lilly's billionaire father, Jake Kane, as the lead suspect. After Jake was exonerated, the scandal cost Keith his job, his home and his wife, and Veronica was ostracized by her friends, including her boyfriend, Duncan (series star TEDDY DUNN), Lilly's brother.\n\nOutcry\n\nConstruction workers discover a teenage girl, Tandi McCain (Amanda Seyfried), who's been missing for days, bound with duct tape and very scared. She was apparently raped, but when her stepfather, Ronald (Michael O'Keefe), arrives, they fight to prevent her from going to the hospital. Benson (Mariska Hargitay) convinces them they have no choice in the situation. Tandi had definitely been raped, and claims she was on the Hudson University campus, when four cadets kidnapped her and took her. She is a little sketchy with the descriptions, but the detectives are able to identify four cadets who all have the same story - Tandi had been at a dorm party, drinking and having a good time. They all claim innocence, and continue to stick by the fact none of them touched her.\n\nCredit Where Credit's Due\n\nVeronica and Wallace don't believe in the evidence against Weevil, who has been arrested for stealing credit card applications from Logan's family, and launch an investigation to help their new ally. Meanwhile, after joining Ms. Mallory Dent's (series star SYDNEY TAMIIA POITIER) journalism class, Veronica clashes with socialite Caitlin Ford (PARIS HILTON - \"The Simple Life 2\"), Logan's sexy new girlfriend. The young investigator is intrigued by the attention shown to her by another wealthy student, Troy Vandegraff (recurring guest star AARON ASHMORE), a friend of her ex-boyfriend Duncan. Later, Veronica learns that Lilly got a ticket while driving her car on the day she died--two hours after her supposed time of death.\n\nMeet John Smith\n\nWith only a commonplace name, an old address and dim memories as leads, Veronica and Wallace attempt to help classmate Justin Smith (BOBBY EDNER) find his father, who disappeared 10 years earlier. Meanwhile, as Veronica experiences some complicated feelings towards ex-boyfriend Duncan and new romantic interest Troy (recurring guest star AARON ASHMORE), guidance counselor Rebecca James (PAULA MARSHALL) calls Keith to the school to discuss the recent, dramatic changes in his daughter's life. Later, Duncan struggles with ways to cope with his sister's death as the anniversary of her murder approaches."
