        "text": "Variety reports that the young actress will star in Myriad Pictures' adaptation of the Oscar Wilde comedy, \"A Woman of No Importance.\" Her co-stars will include Academy Award nominee Annette Bening and Sean Bean. Bruce Beresford will direct the screenplay, which was penned by Howard Himelstein. Donald Zuckerman produces.\n\nSeyfried's upcoming work includes \"Dear John\" and \"Chloe.\"\n\nOscar Wilde's 1893 play, upon which the film is based, begins as \"Lords and ladies gather for afternoon tea and brilliant banter at an idyllic English country estate,\" according to press notes for a recent Yale Rep production of the play. \"For young Gerald Arbuthnot and his mother, the assembled not-so-polite company holds the keys to happiness in love and life. In this comedy of serial seducers, moralizing monogamists, secret pasts and simmering heartbreak, how will the Arbuthnots choose between social advancement and painful truths spoken from the heart?\""
