        "text": "Though it’s been around as a film genre since the early Fifties, the teen movie just doesn’t get old. Films about youthful rebellion and sexual awakening are fascinating whatever your age – and below are 35 of our critics' favourites.\n\nThey’re drawn from across various eras and cultures, but all of them brilliantly describe that vertiginous lurch we feel when we find ourselves teetering on the brink of adulthood. “Life moves pretty fast,” a wise man once said: “If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” That’s exactly what the best films allow us to do.\n\n1. The Wild One (1953)\n\nTeenage rebellion could be seen in cinemas long before the idea of the teenager had really taken shape: as early as 1937, William Wyler’s Dead End showed New York slum kids railing against their older, richer neighbours. But it took Marlon Brando straddling a 6T Triumph Thunderbird to give teen rebelliousness its first icon.\n\nBrando was 29 years old when he starred in Laslo Benedek’s biker drama, but he came to embody the cool disaffectedness of this new emerging social group. When a girl asked Johnny Strabler what he was rebelling against, his answer – “Whaddaya got?” – went down in film history. That question became the keystone of every great teen movie since.\n\nThe early death of its star, James Dean, secured instant-legend status for Nicholas Ray’s brooding melodrama, in which Jim Stark, the new boy at Dawson High School, clashes with bullies, turns on his parents, and tries to build a new family from friendship. When Rebel Without a Cause was released in the United States, Dean had died less than a month previously, and Elvis Presley’s first sessions with RCA in Nashville were only six months away. The film appeared at a fold in American history, with the cult of the teenager writ large on the pages ahead.\n\n4. Cruel Story of Youth (AKA Naked Youth) (1960)\n\nThe early Eighties was when Hollywood really seized on the teen movie as a marketable commodity, and Amy Heckerling’s film, adapted by Cameron Crowe from his own book, is the smartest and sharpest of the era. At the time, critics despaired at its earthy humour and unglamorous sex, but the film had a chord-striking honesty that couldn’t be found in Porky’s and its imitators, and Crowe’s dialogue snaps like mousetraps.\n\n12. Pauline at the Beach (1983)\n\nIt’s hard to think of a director whose teenage characters are blessed with more early-blossoming wisdom than Éric Rohmer. In the third film from his Comedies and Proverbs series, 15-year-old Pauline (Amanda Langlet) passes the summer at a small town on the coast, discovering love while watching the intricate farce of her elders’ romantic lives unravel.\n\n13. The Breakfast Club (1985)\n\nHow on earth do you choose just a single John Hughes film to put on a list like this? The answer is you don’t, so here’s the first of two: the writer-director’s inspired 1985 chamber-piece, in which five apparent stock-character teens – a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal, as they’re introduced to us – discover there’s more to being young than living up to the role with which you’ve been labelled.\n\nThe enduring popularity of Heathers is clear – thirty years after its release the cult classic has just opened as a West End musical and is set to be one of the most popular shows of the Autumn – but what makes the cult film (which stars Winona Ryder and Christian Slater) so brilliant? Largely it's the fact that Lehmann went against the grain and skewered the saccharine portrayal of adolescence that had dominated the Eighties, with John Hughes’s pastel-hued confections. In Heathers, parents were no longer well-meaning and earnest, but stupidly naive; heroines weren’t perky but dangerous, and gruesome violence wasn't a unthinkable thought, but a central narrative. Heathers was living proof that teen film didn't need to be sickly sweet, they could be bad in their own right.\n\nGreta Gerwig wrote and directed this coming-of-age comedy, basing it on her own memories as a Catholic schoolgirl growing up in Sacramento at the turn of the century. Saoirse Ronan, playing a teenage version of her director, is 17 years old at the start of the film and has started dubbing herself Lady Bird, abandoning Christine, the name given to her by her parents. She’s on the point of applying to college, which she wants to be as far away from Sacramento and her oversolicitous mother as geographically possible: ideally New York, which she idolises, in a Manhattan-ish way, right out of proportion. From the start, it’s the mother-daughter relationship to which Gerwig pays most attention of all, and while it is of course a beautiful testament to self-discovery, this film is about a nest, every twig that was used to build it, and what flying out of it might mean and cost, to parents and child alike.\n\nThe beauty of Love, Simon, the first mainstream teen comedy about coming out, is that it really doesn't need to dwell on the fact that its protagonist Simon (Nick Robinson) is gay. Instead it aims to conform to every contour of the high school romcom landscape, complete with secrets, gossip, unrequited crushes and an indie-pop soundtrack. Sweet and moving as it often manages to be, the film is comfortingly average – existing not to stand out, but fit in. A true reflection of how progressive and accepting society can be at its best.\n\n35. To All the Boys I've Loved Before (2018)"
