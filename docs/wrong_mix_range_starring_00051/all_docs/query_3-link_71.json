        "text": "John Lennon's written answer to the female reporter asking him if he has any hobbies, is the word \"tits\".\n\nGeorge Harrison stumbles and falls during the opening sequence of the group running down a street towards the camera. This wasn't intended and he ripped the suit he was wearing, but as he quickly recovered, laughed and continued running, it was decided to retain the shot in the film.\n\nRingo Starr was praised for his solo scene at the riverside as a forlorn soul. However, his expression in that scene was actually the result of being severely hung over after a previous night of heavy drinking.\n\nIn the scene where Paul McCartney's grandfather suggests Ringo Starr to be parading instead of reading a book, the book he's reading is \"Anatomy of a Murder\".\n\nPattie Boyd appears in several scenes in the first act, all on the train. 1) She is one of the two \"schoolgirls on the train\" they first encounter 2) Paul McCartney chats her up with her friend. 3) She sits next to Paul and smiles and sings on \"I Should Have Known Better\". She and George Harrison, who met during filming, married within 18 months.\n\nA young Phil Collins appeared in the audience during the \"You Can't Do That\" number though the sequence was cut from the film.\n\nUnited Artists executives didn't really care about the film itself, they were mainly interested in exploiting a legal loophole which would allow them to distribute the lucrative soundtrack album. In fact, they fully expected to lose money on the film. With a final cost of about $500,000 and a box office take of about $8,000,000 in the first week, \"A Hard Day's Night\" is among the most profitable (percentage-wise) films of all time.\n\nAccording to Norman Rossington, in the scene where John Lennon takes the scissors and cuts the tailor's tape and says \"I now declare this bridge open\", John improvised other versions where instead of \"bridge\" he would say \"synagogue\", \"fish-and-chips stand\", etc. The tailor in the scene is actually The Beatles' real tailor.\n\nWriter Alun Owen put together the plot of the movie while following The Beatles around on their tour of France before they went to America. From observing them, he created their \"stereotypes\": John Lennon is a smart-ass, Paul McCartney is \"cute\" and sensible, George Harrison is quiet and shy and Ringo Starr is dim-witted and sad. He also picked up their manners of speech, and their daily routines, with which he created the plot. Despite the comic elements, it really was a \"day-in-the-life\" look at The Beatles.\n\nThe Beatles record producer George Martin got an Academy Award nomination for his music score in the movie, but The Beatles themselves weren't nominated for their music.\n\nUnited Artists was pressuring the producers to finally come up with a title for the film. When John Lennon told producer Walter Shenson about Ringo Starr's malapropisms, Shenson thought that Ringo's phrase \"a hard day's night\"--referring to his resting up after an exhausting day--might make a good title. John agreed. Shenson called United Artists with the proposed title, which was coolly received. Shenson suggested that they ask the secretaries and other young employees, who might be fans of The Beatles, what they thought of the proposed title. The suggestion worked and the title was accepted.\n\nThe people chasing The Beatles into the train at the beginning of the film are real fans.\n\nRingo Starr is invited to \"Le Cercle\" gambling club, the same club where James Bond makes his first appearance in Dr. No (1962). Coincidentally, both \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Dr. No\" were originally released by United Artists.\n\nAnother James Bond connection is the song, \"This Boy\" (a.k.a. \"Ringo's Theme\"), an instrumental version of which was used in the film to accompany Ringo Starr's solo scene. The guitarist was Vic Flick, who previously played on \"The James Bond Theme\" from Dr. No (1962).\n\nJohn Lennon's line, \"She looks more like him than I do\" was dubbed in after shooting.\n\nThe tire that Ringo Starr trips over in the scene at the river bank had to be thrown again and again, as it kept rolling incorrectly. Finally, after numerous wasted takes, it was offered to young actor David Janson, on hand to play the young boy Ringo meets. Janson rolled the tire correctly on the first try.\n\nIn the scene where The Beatles are running and playing in the field, John Lennon was not there. He was away promoting his new book \"John Lennon: In His Own Write.\" A body double filled in for John, and close-up shots of him were edited into the scene later. A copy of the book can be seen on a mantelpiece in the background of a shot of Norm, Shake and Paul's (very clean) grandfather.\n\nScreenwriter Alun Owen claims that the only Beatle who ad-libbed was John Lennon. The truth is that all four members of The Beatles sparked each other's imagination and improvised.\n\nThe camera's 360-degree pan around Paul McCartney during his performance of \"And I Love Her\" was achieved by dangling the camera from strings marionette-style and moving it in a circle around McCartney.\n\nThe first of five theatrical movies that feature The Beatles.\n\nThe song \"I'll Cry Instead\" was written for the film, but later removed. It still appeared on the soundtrack album, and the US single had \"From the United Artists Picture, 'A Hard Day's Night'\" on the label. In 1982 the movie was re-released with an opening prologue that used \"I'll Cry Instead\" accompanied by an animated collage of photos of The Beatles (similar to, but more complex than, the photos that play under the end credits). Richard Lester was reportedly furious over the prologue sequence, and publicly stated that it was added without his involvement. All home video releases of the film in the 1980s and 1990s include the prologue, including the first DVD release in 1997. In 2000 the film was remastered and re-released on DVD without the prologue, and all editions since then have omitted it.\n\nThe movie's premiere in England took place on the 7th anniversary of John Lennon and Paul McCartney meeting for the first time after a performance by John's first band, The Quarrymen, at the annual Garden Fete.\n\nWhen shooting began, The Beatles had not yet joined the British actor's union. They were hastily inducted on the set with Wilfrid Brambell proposing their membership, and Norman Rossington seconding the motion.\n\nRingo Starr's answering a reporter's question \"Are you a mod, or a rocker?\" with \"I'm a mocker\" was voted as the #58 of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Lines\" by Premiere in 2007. Ringo originally coined the quip during an appearance on Ready, Steady, Go! (1963).\n\nThe constant mention of Paul McCartney's grandfather being \"very clean\" are references to actor Wilfrid Brambell playing a rag-and-bone man in Steptoe and Son (1962), featuring the catch-phrase, \"You dirty old man.\" \"Steptoe and Son\" was remade in the US as Sanford and Son (1972).\n\nThe resulting album of the same name is the only one The Beatles released with every song written and composed exclusively by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. It was also the first Beatles album not to contain any covers of other artists' songs (e.g. \"Roll Over Beethoven\", \"Twist and Shout\").\n\nEach of the Beatles, with the exception of Paul, are addressed by their whole names once in the movie. George's name is told when the group is on the train, when John says \"George Harrison, a scouse of distinction\" (a scouse being a native of Liverpool). Ringo's name is mentioned on his casino invitation, though it's his actual real full name, Richard Starkey, that is said. John's name is said at the end of the movie, when Norm says, \"I have one thing to say to you, John Lennon.\"\n\nBoth John Lennon and Paul McCartney's mothers were mentioned in the film, implied alive, when Paul's mother, Mary Mohin McCartney being dead since he was fourteen, and John's mother, Julia Lennon being dead since he was seventeen.\n\nNorm and Shake are loosely based on The Beatles real-life road managers Neil Aspinall and Mal Evans, respectively.\n\nThe word \"Beatles\" is never mentioned in dialogue. However, \"The Beatles\" is clearly visible on Ringo's bass drumhead.\n\nThe song accompanying the boys' romp in the field was originally \"I'll Cry Instead\". It was changed to the previously-released track \"Can't Buy Me Love\" when director Richard Lester felt the first song didn't fit the mood properly.\n\nTwo scenes were filmed but never used. A sequence where The Beatles are stuck in a traffic jam along with their chauffeur (Frank Thornton) and a solo scene where Paul McCartney meets a Shakespearean actress (Isla Blair) rehearsing in her dressing room.\n\nOnce Ringo Starr's line \"A Hard Day's Night\" was confirmed as the movie's title, it was put to music by John Lennon and Paul McCartney with participation of George Harrison and Starr). The Beatles collectively composed the song that same night, playing it the next morning to producer Walter Shenson in their dressing room.\n\nScreenwriter Alun Owen claimed that the word \"grotty\" was a word used in Liverpool to mean \"grotesque\", but The Beatles never heard it before and believed Owen made it up. It subsequently passed into general usage and linguists certainly cite The Beatles as the popularizers of the word in the early 1960s and trace its origins to Liverpool.\n\nWhile Paul McCartney is singing \"And I Love Her,\" the camera panning around him picks up an arc light that flashes straight into the lens. United Artists executives, reviewing the dailies and certain the shot had to be a mistake, asked producer Walter Shenson if he was aware of it; Shenson replied it had taken them all morning to get it like that.\n\nThis was The Beatles' first feature film and happens to be their only feature filmed in black & white.\n\nPaul McCartney's comment to the mirror in the dressing room \"That this too too solid flesh would melt\" is from William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", Act 1 Scene 2.\n\nA 'Bridewell' is an English slang term for a prison.\n\nPaul McCartney's grandfather tells a policeman that he is \"a soldier of the Republic\". This is a reference to the IRA and shows the links to the Irish immigration to Liverpool. He quotes from the song, \"A Nation Once Again\" written in the 1840s by Thomas Osborne Davis (1814-1845), a founder of an Irish movement whose aim was the independence of Ireland.\n\nIt was reported in contemporary press cuttings that 15 minutes was later cut from the film, including scenes involving a London double-decker bus. The Beatles autographed the ceiling of this bus, which was by that time privately owned by Tim Lewis of Twickenham. Many years later, in 1987, David Thrower purchased the bus in a derelict state, from Wicksteed Park, Kettering, and it is now fully restored to the condition it was in when used in the film - though the signatures of the Beatles on the ceiling are long gone, unfortunately.\n\nJust before he goes out \"parading\", Ringo turns towards Paul's grandfather and gives a short Nazi salute with his left arm (about 58:45).\n\nIn the first ten seconds of the film, as the group of kids chase John, George and Ringo down the street, George stumbles, which causes Ringo to stumble. John looks back and hesitates for a moment before continuing to run. The lead pursuer - a tall blond in a three-piece suit and a mac who had been running close to the wall - moves to the center of the sidewalk, throws both arms straight out to block the kids behind him, and yells \"stop!\" The other kids stopped just long enough for George and Ringo to regain their footing and start running again.\n\nThe film's title track was written entirely in one sitting by John Lennon on the night of April 13th, 1964, which was also the same day he had filmed the iconic bathtub scene. After Ringo had coined the phrase, John and Paul McCartney had basically raced to see who would come up with a song for the phrase and movie title first.\n\nAfter filming for the day on April 1st 1964, John Lennon had met his father, Alfred Lennon, for the first time in 17 years. In the morning, Alf had walked into NEMS Enterprises, (where Beatles manager Brian Epstein worked) accompanied by a journalist. After explaining to the receptionist that he was John Lennon's father, Epstein was informed, immediately sending for a car to pick up John Lennon, the rest of the Beatles with the exception of Paul McCartney tagging along, bringing them over to NEMS. The meeting was unsuccessful however, the first words John saying to his father being \"What do you want?\" The meeting lasted no longer than twenty minutes, a furious John Lennon ordering him off the premises. The encounter was kept out of newspapers by trading with the journalist for exclusive stories about the other bands Brian Epstein managed.\n\nThe first movie with The Beatles ever put out on DVD, it was issued as a single disc in 1997. It was later reissued as a two-disc DVD.\n\nJust prior to singing \"I'm Just Happy to Dance With You\", there's a dance troupe on stage. The background of the stage includes drawings of several types of beetles.\n\nPaul McCartney was actually thirty years younger than Wilfrid Brambell, who played his grandfather.\n\nThe movie's working title initially was \"The Beatles\", then \"Beatlemania\", until Ringo Starr who was exhausted after a long day coined a phrase 'A Hard Day's Night', that was accepted by the studio.\n\nThe song \"You Can't Do That\" was cut from the concert scene at the end of the film, but the scene in which it is performed is still intact.\n\nThe Beatles first shared the bill with Wilfrid Brambell at the Royal Command Variety Performance in November 1963.\n\nThe woolly sweater worn by the TV director (Victor Spinetti) was his own. The sweater was given to him as a gift and later given to a fan club who had asked him for it.\n\nWhile all four of The Beatles attended the movie's premiere, reportedly none stayed for the whole show.\n\nMal Evans, one of the Beatles assistants along with Neil Aspinall, makes a cameo in the film. He is the person carrying the upright bass/cello in between John Lennon and Anna Quayle (Millie) as they are talking in the hallway backstage at the television theater.\n\nUnited Artists wanted to produce the film because The Beatles' US contract with Capitol Records did not include a provision covering film scores. As a result, the original soundtrack for \"A Hard Day's Night\" was released on United Artists Records. The UA version was more of a soundtrack than the comparable album released in the UK, which was actually a new 13-track Beatles album; the UA album had only 8 songs performed by the Beatles, plus 4 tracks from the score (easy-listening orchestral versions of Beatles tunes, arranged by George Martin). All of the Beatles songs on the UA album were also released on Capitol as well, on either the \"Something New\" album or as 45-rpm singles. Nevertheless, the UA strategy worked, as their album went straight to #1. A few years later, UA decided to exit the record business, and sold their catalogue to Capitol -- which promptly reissued the \"missing\" album on their label.\n\nBesides Grandfather's gambling at \"Le Cercle Club,\" there is other James Bond connections: Richard Vernon (the grumpy old man on the train) plays Smithers - the man who lectures Bond on gold in Goldfinger (1964), and Margaret Nolan (girl at \"Le Cercle Club\") also appeared in that film, as \"Dink\", the girl at the hotel swimming pool.\n\nPremiered in England on the eve of Ringo Starr's 24th birthday.\n\nWhen Paul McCartney's grandfather is trying to fake The Beatles' autographs he is sitting on a tail lift and is moved into an operetta rehearsal. The play that is rehearsed in the scene is \"Die Fledermaus\" by Johann Strauß.\n\nThe Beatles were driven to rehearsals at the Scala Theatre, which used to stand at 21 Tottenham Street, London, just off Tottenham Court Road. After a fire, it was demolished in 1969.\n\nSince The Beatles are credited in the opening set of credits, but are not in the more comprehensive end credits, they are listed first, followed by those in the end credits, as required by IMDb policy on cast ordering.\n\nJust to emphasize what a global sensation those bowl-cut-ed men were: The ?lm was titled \"All For One\" (\"Tutti Per Uno\") in Italy, \"Yeah Yeah Yeah\" in Germany and \"Four Boys In The Wind\" (\"Quatre Garçons Dans Le Vent\") in France.\n\nMuch of the dialogue was improvised or directly fed to the band members. Well aware that John, Paul, Ringo and George did not have time to memorize a script or any sort of long speech, director Richard Lester would read them lines to recite back to him.\n\nThe spontaneity of the film was not manufactured by Lester or the band. He noted that almost no structure was planned, except, of course, punctuating the action with the songs. As for the bit of plot that was pre-scripted, writer Alun Owen mapped out the structure by following the band on tour in France.\n\nThe film was nominated for two Oscars. Although The Beatles first movie did not generate a great deal of Oscar buzz in 1964, it did however, manage to bag nominations for two Academy Awards, one for Best Score (George Martin) and the other for Best Screenplay (Alun Owen)\n\nThe \"Press Party\" scene was done impromptu when rain prevented the planned out door scene. Among the guests is a 17 year old Charlotte Rampling.\n\nAt the end, the \"BEA\" logo (for \"British European Airways\") on the helicoper becomes \"BEA TLES\", when the helicopter door is closed\n\nThe first chord in the song 'A Hard Day's Night?' G eleventh suspended fourth.\n\nPhil Collins the young extra\n\nThere is a scene in the movie where the Beatles enter a limousine, I believe at the beginning of the movie. In this particular scene the Beatles are all dressed in suits and ties, but when the Beatles are filmed in the limo, John Lennon is wearing a turtle neck sweater beneath a blazer.\n\nWhen Paul's grandfather goes to the queue of girl's waiting to see the Beatles, he offers free autographed pictures. As he is mobbed he yells \"Oh me bum....me hat.\". We see his hat has been taken/knocked off as some bobbies come to break it up. A quick cut to a different angle and grandpa's hat is back on his head.\n\nAs Paul runs out of the train to his awaiting limo its door is open. In the next shot we see him from a different angle and he opens the door again.\n\nSitting at their table Paul's grandfather tries to convince Ringo to stop reading his book and if you look closely there's plenty of sugar in the sugar shaker. No one touches it but when the old man says, \"So you are a man after all\" the sugar shaker is all of a sudden empty.\n\nPaul combs his hair in the mirror during the train sequence. After that a lock of hair appears over his left eyebrow for several shots. By the end of the scene his hair is back to being combed perfectly.\n\nWhen Ringo and the young boy with the tire walk along the path together and the boy asks Ringo, \"Why aren't you at work?,\" you can see Ringo mouthing the line along with him.\n\nWhen the Beatles are rehearsing for the TV gig, it is easy to see that they are not actually playing their instruments. John points out to Ringo that he isn't even hitting the cymbals, which he attempts to improve.\n\nWhen the boys sneak off to the nightclub, the clothes they are wearing when they leave the hotel are different from those that they are wearing for the remainder of the night.\n\nIn several shots of the audience, girls can be seen sitting in seats, then several shots later they've moved and can be seen leaning over the balcony.\n\nAs The Beatles go out to the field while \"Can't buy me love\" is playing Ringo has his camera. It disappears after they come down the fire escape and doesn't return for the rest of the scene.\n\nOn the train you can see a shadow of a mike on John's chin when he says, \"No that's his other one.\"\n\nWhen the Beatles are playing cards and singing \"I Should Have Known Better,\" Paul (who shouldn't really be singing anyway) flubs the first line of the last verse. He sings \"I sh... [laughs] never realized...\" John does almost the exact same thing when they sing \"I Should Have Known Better\" in the concert scene.\n\nThey're meant to be taping a TV show, but some of the cameras were motion picture cameras used for shooting the movie, rather than TV cameras.\n\nIn the opening credits two cameramen are seen in the reflection of the window.\n\nWhen the Beatles run out into the field it's an overcast day. In the very next scene the sun is shining.\n\nAs The Beatles leave the train Paul goes through the first limo and we can see the second limo he's running to with a bunch of photographers standing at the side of it taking pictures. In the next shot the photographers are standing in front of the car and not taking any pictures.\n\nWhen The Beatles first enter their stateroom on the train we see the door as Paul opens it and there's a first-class sign on it. Later Norm and Shake leave the stateroom as the older grumpy gentleman walks in. They never leave but this stateroom is not the same one that The Beatles walked into before as it has another sticker under the first-class sign that reads, \"All Seats Reserved\".\n\nJohn asks Paul's grandfather, \"Are you nursing a broken heart?\" and if you look over his head the window is closed. No one goes near it but two shots later John stands up and walks over to the old man and the window is now open.\n\nWhen Ringo looks in the mirror in the hotel room he has a peeled banana in his hand, then in the next scene it disappears.\n\nWhen they sing \"Tell Me Why\" for the TV show there's a shot taken from behind The Beatles. Here as John sings, \"Well I'm beggin' on my bended knees\" the microphone that was in front of him has now been moved and is facing Ringo. Later in the scene you can see that there are only two microphones on the stage here, one for Paul and George and one for John.\n\nThe TV producer talks to George and says, \"I mean lines ducky, can you handle lines?\" and his two assistants are sitting on the window sill in front of the blinds. In the next shot they both have moved over about four feet to their left and are not in front of the window anymore.\n\nIn their hotel room Ringo says, \"Do I snore, John?\" If you look at Paul's hands on the piano it's obvious that he's not playing and that it's an over-dub that we are listening to.\n\nIn their final performance Richard Lester's shadow is seen going across John Lennon's back as he walks from the back of the stage to the spot where we see him between The Beatles and the audience.\n\nIn all the overhead helicopter shots the shadows are very long. The shots on the ground have less of a shadow indicating they were done several hours later.\n\nIn their final performance look closely and you can see director Richard Lester moving through the shot. He's between the Beatles and the audience.\n\nThe stage lift that Paul's grandfather is sitting on while signing the pictures is larger, and a different color that the stage lift he comes up on in the middle of the play.\n\nAs he talks to Norm, Shake the TV producer says, \" If they don't show up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the tea in China\" and the clock above his head reads 7:12 PM. In the next shot we see Paul's grandfather trying to sell autographed pictures of The Beatles to the girls on line outside the theater and it's mid-afternoon.\n\nIn the commissary Paul's grandfather says, \"Would'ya look at 'em\" as he tries to get Ringo to stop reading his book, which he holds differently between shots.\n\nAt the very end of \"I Should Have Known Better\" all The Beatles' microphones have been removed from in front of them.\n\nAs The Beatles sit in the train car talking about Paul's grandfather Paul says, \"he's nursing a broken heart\" and Paul is sitting behind his grandfather. In the next shot he's leaning in front of him.\n\nWhen Ringo is \"parading\" he comes out of a thrift shop wearing his new over coat and hat and tries to talk to a girl in a black jacket. We hear her say to him, \"Get out of it, Shorty\" but her lips are saying something entirely different.\n\nAs George sings, \"I'm happy just to dance with you\" four girls stand next to Paul and Ringo as their boss comes out yelling at them to get back to work. If you look at Ringo, his drumming is in perfect sync with the song but Paul's bass playing is not.\n\nWhen Paul's grandfather pulls the elevator lever he throws the pictures down in a messy pile. In the next shot when he pops up on stage the pictures are in a neat pile.\n\nWhen the TV producer says to George \"of course they're grotty, you wretched nit\" his hands are out in front of him. In the previous shot his hands were behind his back.\n\nRingo hangs out in a bar and accidentally ruins a game that two guys are playing as he spills some change from his coat onto their board. The coins are rearranged on the board between shots.\n\nWhen Ringo goes out \"parading\" two girls recognize him as he walks down the street taking pictures with his camera. If you look closely the cars parked on the street to the right of the screen change between shots.\n\nSitting in the lunch car Norm gives Paul's grandfather the pictures and the old man says, \"Hey Paulie would you sign one of them for us\" as he puts the pictures on his plate. In the next shot the plate is not there.\n\nOn the train we never see Shake hand anything to John then all of a sudden, he has a Pepsi and his hand.\n\nIn final performance sequence watch for Ringo's mysterious moving bongo drums. They're on his right and disappear, then reappear, disappear and then reappear several times.\n\nWhen Ringo turns on the transistor radio, he plays with the volume control, but the sound on the radio doesn't change until after he lifts his finger.\n\nWilfrid Brambell asks Paul to sign a Beatle picture and he uses a ballpoint pen. Later, he copies them over using the master copy that The Beatles signed with ballpoint pens. Their signatures are now different (done with a thick felt marker) so they can stand out better in the black and white shot.\n\nWatch the clock on a wall. Six minutes of the movie go by but that clock hasn't moved one minute.\n\nWhen George is showing Shake how to shave in the hotel bathroom, he puts shaving cream on the mirror. In the next shot the bathroom door opens, Norm enters and the mirror is completely clean.\n\nIn the dining car the reflection of the crew moving around can be seen in the back against the wall.\n\nThe television concert features three songs on which John played acoustic guitar, but he keeps his electric guitar the whole time.\n\nDuring the final concert, Ringo's drumming is frequently out of sync with the sounds heard.\n\nAfter \"She Loves You\" they bow and the sign behind them is lit up and says \"Beatles\". The editor made a mistake here and inserted a shot from earlier in the movie with the stage background from the song \"Tell Me Why\".\n\nDuring the show George stops playing as he yanks Paul's grandfather off the stage but we still hear his lead guitar riff in \"She Loves You\".\n\nIn the intro credits, John, George and Ringo jump onto several stacks of newspapers and John is sitting on them to the right. In the next shot he is crouching with both hands in front him ready to jump off.\n\nWhen John sings \"I Should Have Known Better\" there's an extreme close-up of his face as he sings, \"That when I tell you that I love you, oh \" and he's obviously sweating. In the next shot they show a close-up of his face on the control room monitor and there isn't a drop of sweat on him.\n\nA grumpy old man comes into their stateroom and sits with The Beatles. If you watch closely on the left of the screen someone bumps into the stage light and we can see it flicker.\n\nAs Paul sings, \"Bright are the stars that shine\" from \"And I Love Her\" they show a close-up of his face on the TV monitor entirely lit up by the stage lights. In the next live shot there's a shadow on the right side of his face.\n\nPaul's grandfather sits in the basement of the TV studio and pulls out a white ballpoint pen to sign the phony autographs on The Beatles' pictures. In the next shot he has a different silver pen that can be seen as it reflects the studio lights.\n\nOn the stage Victor Spinetti says, \"It's a young man's medium, I just can't stand the pace\" and look closely at his blond assistant as she follows him off the set. At first she has nothing in her hands then she has a pile of paper.\n\nIn the back of the train as his grandfather sits locked up Paul says, \"Well you've got to admit you've upset a lot of people,\" and Paul's voice sounds natural. His voice in the next line sounds entirely different as he says, \"At least I can keep my eye on you while you're stuck in here,\" and is an obvious over-dub done in another place.\n\nA studio engineer tries to play with Ringo's drums and George says, \"He's very fussy about his drums. They loom large in his legend,\" as he tries to tune his guitar. If you listen closely George is paying his fifth string while adjusting the tuning peg of his fourth string on his Rickenbacker.\n\nWhen John talks to the woman by the staircase if you look at the clock above his head it reads 3:25. In the very next shot of George going into the TV producers office the same clock now reads 6:20.\n\nIn the lunch car as Paul signs the picture for his grandfather he's holding it with his right hand. In the next shot his hand has moved and he's holding in with his thumb.\n\nWhen Paul's grandfather is below the stage the pictures are on his left. As he emerges on the stage the pictures are now on his right.\n\nThe clock on the wall is constantly changing time in this scene. You can see it several times and you can see its reflection in the mirror.\n\nThe cameraman's shadow and reflection are seen on the left of the photo booth that the Beatles were hiding in during the opening scenes.\n\nAs the boys leave in the helicopter at the end of the film, it says \"BEATLES\" on the aircraft's door. The name is split into two different sections to fit on the sliding panels. A few seconds later, one half of the name is missing, leaving only \"BEA\" on the left-hand side.\n\nWhen John says to Paul's grandfather, \"Ya see you know what your trouble is, you should have gone West to America,\" they're standing about six feet apart, but in the next shot John has his arm on his shoulder.\n\nAfter the TV producer talks to Norm and Shake, three Beatles (minus Ringo) appear singing the theme song of the movie \"A Hard Day's Night\". Not only are their lips not moving, but they couldn't possibly have been playing \"A Hard Day's Night\" because it wasn't written until after the movie was completed.\n\nAfter the show, Norm tells The Beatles to get ready to leave for a midnight matinee later that night and the clock on the wall reads 9:10 PM. It's well after dark but in the next shot as they board the helicopter for the next show it's midday.\n\nAt the end of \"I Should Have Known Better\" there's a lone drumstick that appears wedged into a tuning key on the front of Ringo's bass drum that wasn't there in previous shots.\n\nRingo meets up with a young boy while he's out 'parading' who says, \"I'm a deserter\" after Ringo inquires about why he's not in school. As the boy says this line there's an out of focus close-up of Ringo.\n\nWhen the rude man comes into the Beatles compartment in the train scene, you can plainly see that the armrest between him and John is already down, but in the next shot, the man puts it down.\n\nUpon their return the TV producer says to The Beatles, \" You don't know what this means to me, if you hadn't come back it would have meant The Epilogue or News in Welsh\" as they get ready for the show. Norm is standing behind the producer but then in the next shot as he talks to him he's on his right.\n\nAfter the scene in the TV producer's office with George there's a shot of rehearsals going on at the TV studio with an older actor singing a German opera. His lips are mouthing something else.\n\nIn the second verse of \"If I Fell\" there's a shot from behind Ringo. Just as they sing, \"If I trust in you\" you can see a crewmember's head bobbing up and down at the bottom right of the screen. We see this place in previous and subsequent shots and no one is sitting there.\n\nJohn stops strumming his guitar on the intro to \"If I Fell\" but we still hear the guitar playing.\n\nAn old woman in a dress shop peeps out to see all the cameras in front of her store before the Beatles run by on their way back to the studio.\n\nShake has only one Pepsi which he gives to George, then later there are two.\n\nSomeone's shadow goes across Ringo's face while he's taking a picture in their train car.\n\nWhen they sing \"I Should Have Known Better\" look at Paul's left wrist - he's wearing a metal ID bracelet. Anyone who plays guitar knows that they jangle against the strings. He makes sure in any real live performances that it is tucked up in his sleeve away from the strings.\n\nIn this scene George passes a poster that reads \"Hughes and Macready\". Two shots later it's back in a different place place.\n\nWhen George sings, \"I don't need to hug or hold you tight\" from \"I'm happy just to dance with you\" he's lip-syncing the wrong words.\n\nWhen they sing \"I Should Have Known Better\" for the TV show there's a shot of John playing his harmonica just before he sings, \"Wo oo oo I\" and the harmonica is still in his mouth as we hear him sing the beginning of the verse.\n\nAs The Beatles go out of the fire escape door Ringo shouts, \"We're out\" just before \"Can't buy me love\" starts playing. If you look closely at his lips he doesn't actually say anything.\n\nWhen the boys go to get Ringo out of the police station, the other 3 are in front of the police officers and Ringo is way behind strolling along with his camera. When they get trapped in the courtyard they are all together. How did Ringo manage to pass all the policemen with out getting arrested, whilst going slower than everyone else?\n\nAs Paul sings, \"And I Love Her\" there's a close-up shot of Ringo playing his bongos. The only problem is there are no bongos in this part of the song.\n\nJohn takes a pair of scissors and cuts the tailor's tape measure as he says, \"I now declare this bridge open\". Everyone else has left the room but the tailor winks at someone off camera.\n\nThe opening for the elevator where Paul's grandfather pops up through the stage floor disappears between shots at the end of \"She Loves You\".\n\nGeorge goes into a TV producers office and the secretary's phone is pushed right up against the edge of her desk. In the next shot when she puts on her shoe the phone is pushed back about two inches from the edge of the desk.\n\nAs The Beatles leave their hotel room, in the corner on a left is a guitar case, a vase, and a bottle of Pepsi underneath the mirror. When they come back the bottle of Pepsi is gone.\n\nThe makeup on the boy that Ringo meets keeps changing."
