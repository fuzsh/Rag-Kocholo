        "text": "Mary Poppins (1964)\n\nFor a musical movie that came out so many decades ago, this one sure does have some legs. No one could anticipate how successful a story about a bunch of kids, a magical nanny, and a chimney sweeper would be. We don't know about you — but we've lost count of how many times we have watched and sang along to this one.\n\nSo it's no surprise that classic numbers like \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\" \"Let's Go Fly a Kite,\" and \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" have etched themselves into the Mount Rushmore of movie musical songs. Beyond its music, there are some incredible performances from Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, and the use of animation against live-action was groundbreaking at the time.\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007)\n\nSet in 1840s Victorian London, \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" owes a lot of thanks to Johnny Depp for an incredible performance of the titular character. This really was Depp's decade, who made the character of Benjamin Barker his own. This musical movie tells the tale of a wrongfully accused convict, who vows revenge for the wrongdoings done to his wife, all while plying his trade as a barber.\n\nThere is no denying though that Depp's chemistry with Helena Bonham Carter in this one was absolutely off the charts. Perfectly blending comedy with horror, \"Sweeney Todd\" achieved so much, while still being overlooked by many movies that are remembered more for their music.\n\nFrozen (2013)\n\nWe can't underestimate the impact that \"Frozen\" had on an entire generation. This really was the Disney musical epic for a very specific age group. It's amazing to think that there were only six years between the first one and the second one — because for us, that gap in time felt like an absolute eternity!\n\nThe story of Elsa, Anna, Olaf, and the others, is one for the ages. And when you consider the songs that came with it, most notably, \"Let It Go,\" it's no wonder that people are struggling to forget about this instant Disney classic. Heck, \"Frozen\" even ended up getting two Academy Awards, and rightfully so.\n\nDancer in the Dark (2000)\n\nWe're not going to lie, this might be one of the most somber musical movies on this entire list. Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier is responsible for this miserable flick, which ended up winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival during the turn of the millennium. What made \"Dancer in the Dark\" such a surprising success was the fact that Icelandic pop star Bjork was the star of the movie.\n\nShe plays an immigrant mother from the Czech Republic who is struggling to make ends meet both financially and medically. Most of you will be aware that Bjork is something of a musical prodigy, so it isn't that surprising that she was able to be the star of a musical movie.\n\nSingin' in the Rain (1952)\n\nYou can't have a list of musical movies without giving \"Singin' in the Rain\" a mention. In fact, that is quite an understatement. It might be one of the most iconic examples on this entire list. This classic is set during the 1920s silent film era with a huge nod to how \"talkies\" were starting to take effect.\n\nAt the core of the movie are two fantastic performances from Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, the mother of Carrie Fisher. This duo's chemistry was unquestionable, and those shots of them literally singing and dancing in the rain have found their way into so many Oscar montages throughout the years. Not to mention the fact that the film has been parodied so many times over the years.\n\nLa La Land (2016)\n\nOne of the more recent additions to the pantheon of musical movies is the fantastic \"La La Land.\" Unfortunately, the now-infamous incident in which this movie was wrongfully announced as Best Picture at the Academy Awards has, in many ways, overshone the actual quality of this beautiful movie. Riding the wave of the success of his hit movie \"Whiplash,\" Damien Chazelle took virtually every aspect of his filmmaking repertoire to a whole new level.\n\nFirstly, he upped the ante with casting, with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone leading this one. The cinematography of \"La La Land\" was also a real sight for sore eyes. But maybe the most underrated aspect of the film is its musical numbers, which are nothing short of majestic.\n\nWest Side Story (1961 and 2021)\n\nIt started out as an Off-Broadway play, and then somehow, it transpired into the musical movie that it is today, giving people from all around the world a chance to see it. \"West Side Story\" follows the lives of two youngsters from rival gangs in New York City who fall in love.\n\nTechnically, their love should be forbidden as they come from different ethnic backgrounds, and as such, the tensions build to tragedy as the story unfolds. Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise directed the 1961 version of this flick, and it somehow managed to claim a whopping 10 Oscars, whereas the modern-day 2021 counterpart by the legendary director Steven Spielberg earned just one.\n\nCabaret (1972)\n\nThis eight-time Oscar-winning musical, which was loosely adapted from a Broadway musical, follows the life of a cabaret Cambridge student played by Liza Minelli. Her character makes her way to Berlin in the early 1930s to further her studies there. This movie put Minelli on the map as she earned an Oscar for one of her most phenomenal performances.\n\nWhile in Germany, she meets a local playboy, who entraps her into a complicated love triangle. This musical was directed by the legendary Bob Fosse, who is regarded as one of the founding fathers who revolutionized dancing and choreography in the Broadway sector in the 20th Century.\n\nGrease (1978)\n\nWe think that it's safe to say that everyone born before the turn of the century has watched this fantastic movie. Its star reputation boils down to the \"electrifying\" performances given by the leads Olivia Newton-John, the good girl, and John Travolta, the greaser.\n\nWill their love survive after they realize they're in the same high school? It's kind of silly, kind of dumb, but it's so hard not to enjoy this musical about two teens who fall in love in the 1950s. There have been several resurrections of this film, but sadly, none of them manage to do half as well as the original from 1978 did.\n\nMoulin Rouge! (2001)\n\nIt's impossible not to be enchanted with this movie. Thanks to stellar performances from Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, this movie hits just about every emotion, even the ones you didn't know existed. Directed by Baz Luhrmann, it managed to get a hefty 8 Oscar nominations, of which it took home two wins.\n\nIt is set in Paris in the late 1800s, in which the underground scene is corrupted by all kinds of debauchery. It follows a young English poet who finds himself in a dangerous love triangle after falling in love with a gorgeous courtesan — an underground nightclub star. Things get messy because she always happens to be coveted by the Duke, the club's patron.\n\nMy Fair Lady (1964)\n\n1964's \"My Fair Lady\" is an almost perfect musical thanks to Audrey Hepburn's fearlessly fabulous performance. Set in 1910s London, the pompous professor Henry Higgins, who Sir Rex Harrison portrayed, is so sure of himself that he attempts to transform a crude Cockney girl into someone who is fit to be introduced into high society.\n\nThe working-class girl, Eliza Doolittle, is played by Hepburn, and she is pretty much sparkling like a diamond for nearly the entire duration of the movie. This movie won a mighty 8 Oscars, so if you haven't seen it, then maybe it's time to change that and give this movie a chance!\n\nOnce (2007)\n\n\"Once\" is so underrated that we'd expect that most people reading this list probably haven't even heard of it. Upon its release in 2007, it wasn't yet labeled a musical, and sure, there's no dancing and not that much music, but since airing, most have come around to accepting it as a musical. It follows the lives of an unnamed girl and a guy in Dublin as they write music together, fall in love, and perform in pubs.\n\nAll the songs are reflections of what's happening on screen. It's touching, and it's lovely, and we wouldn't recommend this if we didn't think it was worth your time. It even earned itself an Oscar for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures.\n\nThe Sound of Music (1965)\n\nThis list wouldn't be valid if we didn't mention \"The Sound of Music\" as one of the best musicals ever made. In 1964, Julie Andrews made waves with her performance in the musical \"Mary Poppins,\" and in 1965, she did it again with this classic. Thanks to this flick, almost everyone has come to know the tunes \"do-re-mi\" and \"The Hills Are Alive!\" since they were little kids.\n\nIt's set in the 1930s in Austria and follows the tales of a young novice who is sent to a naval officer's household to be a governess to his seven naughty children. At first, the children are unhappy and resentful toward their new governess, but her kindness and jovial nature soon turn that around. Over five Oscars and more than half a century later, this movie is still as great as it once was. We don't think it's going anywhere.\n\nAll That Jazz (1979)\n\nA musical classic by the legendary Bob Fosse is 1979's \"All That Jazz.\" Fosse's record-setting eight Tony Awards for his work in choreography is what sets him apart from everyone in the world of dance, and this applies to the time he was alive up until today. This semi-autobiographical movie is as exhilarating as it is stressful.\n\nIt's based on a great chunk of Fosse's career as a womanizing Broadway choreographer, director, and filmmaker. His character, whose professional and private life are deeply intertwined, is played by Roy Scheider. This movie got a staggering nine Oscar nominations, of which it took four home.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (1939)\n\nA musical classic that everyone should have at least heard of is \"The Wizard of Oz.\" According to the Library of Congress, this is the most-watched movie ever, and if that isn't true today, then it was definitely the case at some point. It's also possible that this could be the best fantasy family flick to ever air. Those who have watched this iconic film will know of the epic transformation that happens as things shift from monochrome to bedazzling technicolor.\n\nWe can only imagine how this feat stunned audiences when it came out in 1939. \"The Wizard of Oz\" pretty much has it all, from a lovable team of misfit creatures to the terrifying witch. It has an endearing ability to make us see that sometimes what we seek is, more often than not, found inside, and perhaps a trip to Oz is all it takes to tease it out.\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)\n\nThis classic is still going strong today despite having aired so many years ago. Even if it was aired back in 1975, limited theatres around the world still make use of its brilliance today. This affably spicy and sweetly strange musical came to life due to the spectacular performances by Susan Sarandon, Tim Curry, Barry Bostwick, and Richard O'Brien.\n\nIt starts off on a hectic rain-swept evening where two newly engaged boring souls find themselves at the quirky mansion of Dr. Frank-n-Furter. Little by little, the two slowly start to make the most of the potent fascinations around them while the idolized Rocky runs free in the residence. This could quite possibly be the longest-running film to date. The ultimate cult classic.\n\nMeet Me in St. Louis (1944)\n\nJudy Garland can pretty much play any role she gets cast into, but her role in \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" is undoubtedly one of her best. This is another one of producer Arthur Freed's (from \"The Wizard of Oz\") brilliant mind creations. In this flick, Garland debuts the iconic Christmas song, \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\"\n\nTo this day, it's enough to give anyone the chills. It tells the tale of an affluent family with their four stunning daughters in St. Louis who get pretty rattled when they find out they have to move to New York just before the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. It's wholesome, and it's cute, and in case you've never watched it, maybe it's time to consider it.\n\nFiddler on the Roof (1971)\n\nOne of the longest-running shows in the history of Broadway is \"Fiddler on the Roof.\" This musical is set in pre-revolutionary Russia and follows a poor Jewish milkman as he navigates through trying to marry off his three daughters to ideal romantic partners while trying to maintain all his traditional values.\n\nAll of this is going down while there is a growing anti-semitic sentiment that started to sweep through his little village. This film was directed by the seven-time Oscar nominee Norman Jewison. It also got three Oscar wins, so we wouldn't have put it on this list if we hadn't deemed it worthy enough.\n\nPinocchio (1940)\n\nA lot of time, money, and resources were spent on this 1940 production. This was Walt Disney's second full-length production and arguably one of the best coming from this time period. This musical animation tells a story about a wooden marionette named Pinocchio.\n\nThe inventor of this toy so badly wishes it to come alive, which is granted by a fairy. However, most of the film showcases Pinocchio as he keeps on doing the wrong things that get him into trouble — most notably, a tendency to lie. According to IMDb, \"Pinocchio\" managed to win every award it was nominated for, including two Oscars for Best Music.\n\nWilly Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971)\n\nBesides \"The Fiddler on the Roof,\" another epic musical to come from 1971 is the fantastical \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.\" There have been many adaptions of Roald Dahl's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" novel from 1964, but this was perhaps the first one. The story of Willy Wonka, played by Gene Wilder, astounds the world as he makes a public appearance after staying reclusive in his chocolate factory for many years.\n\nHe gives five lucky people a tour of his factory, and one lucky winner may stand a chance at a lifetime's supply of chocolate. Along the way, there are all sorts of mild disasters that befall most of the children, except for Charlie, who probably deserves to win the most out of all of them. In this musical, Wilder has the ability to turn a creepy chocolatier into a charming raconteur.\n\nOklahoma! (1955 and 2019)\n\nInitially, this flick came in the form of a 1943 Broadway production. Directed by Fred Zimmermann, this movie was filmed with a groundbreaking 70mm process. Set in the Oklahoma region at the start of the 20th century, it follows two young cowboys as they try to win over the romantic favors of the local ladies.\n\nIn 2019, this film got a breath of fresh air when Daniel Fish reimagined \"Oklahoma!,\" except this time it was through a Broadway Production. The 1955 version of this movie won 2 Oscars, whereas the 2019 play had a good run at the Tony Awards. It earned eight nominations and a win for \"Best Revival of a Musical\" at this award ceremony. Not bad!\n\nA Hard Day's Night (1964)\n\nLong before BTS, or the trail of boy bands that colonized the music scene in the 90s, there was the best band of all time — The Beatles. This musical came out at the precise pinnacle of Beatlemania, and it explores this G.O.A.T of a rock band over 36 hours. There's a lot of dancing, singing, and romance, and even quite a bit of comedy, too.\n\nBy following the band from backstage to center stage, audiences get to see the Fab Four's characters and quirks up close with a sort of 'day-in-the-life' angle. \"A Hard Day's Night\" gave the world an introduction to Paul, John, George, and Ringo and set a precedent for pretty much all band musical films to come.\n\nA Star Is Born (1954 and 2018)\n\nSometimes melodrama gets a bad rap, but not so much in \"A Star Is Born.\" The 2018 musical is centered on a fading rock star who's a complete mess and a rising pop sensation that he gets involved with, whereas the 1954 version is set on the same premise, except the two are coming from a movie background and not a music background.\n\nThere was also a 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand, which is more in line with the recent \"A Star Is Born.\" Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga both gave superb performances. This flick went on to earn itself an Oscar for Best Music Written for a Motion Picture, whereas its predecessor got six Oscar nominations.\n\nBohemian Rhapsody (2018)\n\nTechnically, we're not 100% sure if this movie could be strictly classified as a musical, but since it tells the story of quite possibly one of the best rock bands and most extraordinary lead singers ever, we felt we had to include it on this list. \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a foot-stomping, hand-clapping revelry of Queen, the music they made, and Freddie Mercury, who led the band.\n\nFreddie went against all stereotypes to become one of the most beloved entertainers in the world of music. This four-time Oscar-winning flick chronicles Queen's legacy that still inspires music lovers around the world to this day. The lead role was played by Rami Malek, who got his claim to fame thanks to this movie.\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)\n\nThere's nothing quite like a good-old Halloween-Christmas mash-up. Like its fellow holiday classic \"Gremlins,\" this red-blooded holiday flick is probably one of the scariest movies ever to be aimed at a child audience. The writer and producer Tim Burton also directed \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" from this list, and he's known for having his own gothic style when it comes to movie making.\n\nHe used stop-motion to create this musical, which became so popular over the years that it somehow became its own brand. The eerie music from Danny Elfman has the ability to haunt anyone who watches it, and the breathtaking German Expressionist vibes are quite inspiring. Some film critics have even gone as far as to compare this movie's prowess to that of \"Star Wars.\"\n\nThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)\n\n\"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" is a musical classic from the sixties. Set in France's west side, this is possibly one of the most perpetually popular and boundless non-English movies ever made. Geneviève is a 16-year-old girl living with her dowager mother, who operates an umbrella shop in the pastel-hued, rain-soaked coastal town of Cherbourg.\n\nShe and the 20-year-old Guy are secretly in love and so badly want to tie the knot, but upon hearing their plans, Geneviève's mother objects. Guy is drafted to serve in the military in colonial Algeria and the mother sees this as an opportunity to pair her daughter with a well-to-do gem dealer. This masterpiece got 5 Oscar nominations and three wins at the annual Cannes Film Festival.\n\nTick, Tick... BOOM! (2021)\n\nThis has probably got to be one of 2021's most staggering surprises in the movie sector. Andrew Garfield portrays Jon, a young theater composer who's waiting tables in 1990 New York while writing what he wishes to be the next best American musical.\n\nJust days before he needs to showcase his work that could make or break his career, he is faced with a ton of pressures coming from all angles, including his girlfriend and his friend, all while the artistic community is getting swallowed up by the AIDS epidemic. Jon is at a point where he needs to think carefully about what his next move should be. This movie is beautiful because it captures the all-consuming struggles that creatives have to go through to get a foot in the industry's door.\n\nThe Young Girls of Rochefort (1967)\n\nCatherine Deneuve was born in the '40s to actor parents in the French capital of Paris. She made her acting debut when she was barely a teenager and continued with minor roles until she made her mark with 1964's \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.\" A few years later, she appeared in the classic \"The Young Girls of Rochefort,\" which was also set in France, except this time it took place in the little village of Rochefort.\n\nThis musical love story follows the lives of two elegant sisters living on the seaside as they search for romance. Since Deneuve's acting career started, she has done a ton of things in the movie industry, and in 2000, she was also featured in the musical \"Dancer in the Dark,\" which also made it onto this list.\n\nPurple Rain (1984)\n\nRemember the good old days when Prince was a massive pop star? 1984's \"Purple Rain\" was great for showcasing why. This musical not only paraded Prince's incredible charisma and performance talents but also his stellar ability to sing. The storyline follows a young man with a striking talent for music whose career with so much promise had just begun.\n\nAfter meeting another aspiring singer and lover, he realizes that it's going to take a lot more than talent to make it to the top. It's moving and spirited, and since it grossed ten times its budget at the box office, we can't find any reason why you shouldn't watch it if you haven't already done so.\n\nChicago (2002)\n\nThere are only a handful of musical masterpieces that have managed to successfully leap from stage to screen, and \"Chicago\" is one of them. This movie featured some of the biggest names in the industry, including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renée Zellweger, Richard Gere, and Queen Latifah, to name a few.\n\nSet in 1920s Chicago, the housewife Roxie Hart, played by Zellweger, has dreams of becoming famous that are so big that somehow it leads her to death row. She and another criminal named Velma, played by Zeta-Jones, form a rivalry, and the two compete for fame in hopes that it'll keep them from their fate. \"Chicago\" won a mighty six Oscars, which made it the first musical to do so since \"Oliver!\" from 30 years before.\n\n42nd Street (1933)\n\nSome cinematic critics have claimed that this movie was the source from which all musicals flow. We can believe that since it was released way back in 1933, it probably makes it one of the oldest movies on this list. The story follows a sickly Broadway director who makes a comeback to create one last, final show, but after his leading lady breaks an ankle, she gets replaced by a young actress who ends up stealing the show.\n\nThe extravagance, precision, and pure joy that come out of this musical is unrivaled. The story also includes a number of hummable hits like \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo,\" \"You're Getting to Be a Habit With Me,\" and, of course, \"42nd Street.\"\n\nThe Greatest Showman (2017)\n\nIn \"The Greatest Showman,\" audiences get to witness Hugh Jackman, Zendaya, Zac Efron, and Michelle Williams sing. What's not to love about that? This story is based on the outrageously true tale of Phineas Taylor Barnum, the entertainer portrayed by Jackman, as he faked his way to the top of a roaming circus. It was set in the late 19th century and showcased Barnum's ability to blur the line between fiction and reality.\n\nHe is hungry for triumph and thirsty for invention after introducing the never-before-seen live circus acts. It's a gamble as he risks everything to appeal to a high-brow audience, but will he be able to become the greatest showman of all time? This musical managed to get an Oscar nomination for the original song \"This Is Me.\"\n\nTop Hat (1935)\n\nA golden oldie coming out of the 1930s is the four-time Oscar-nominated \"Top Hat.\" Starring Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, this movie exemplifies this power duo's on-screen chemistry, and it is considered the high point of their careers. While most of their flicks feature cosmic dancing, \"Top Hat\" gets extra credit for holding up as a genuinely outstanding comedy.\n\nThis story is about Jerry Travers, the song and dance icon, who is in London to open a show produced by his good pal Horace. Late one night, much to the annoyance of Dale Tremont, who was trying to sleep, Jerry whips out his dance moves in the hotel room. Dale decides to go downstairs to tell him off for the racket he is creating, but the two have an instant attraction. Things start to get messy when Dale confuses Jerry with the show's producer.\n\nHairspray (2007)\n\n\"Grease\" wasn't the only remarkable musical that John Travolta got to be a part of. In 1977, he played the leading role in \"Saturday Night Fever.\" Five years later, in 1983, he was cast in the leading role in \"Staying Alive.\" And in 2007, Travolta gave us another taste of his talents in performing the musical \"Hairspray.\" This movie was special for him as he actually played the role of a woman by the name of Edna Turnblad. Besides Travolta, other big names we could drop from this movie are Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah, and Christopher Walken, to name a few.\n\nThe star-studded cast is probably one of the reasons that made this film succeed the way it did. The stage version of this movie won eight Tony awards in 2002, and thanks to that recognition, it got this iconic film in its honor five years later. It's fun, it's silly and delightfully energetic.\n\nOliver! (1968)\n\n\"Oliver!\" from the late '60s was a musical adaptation of a tale revolving around the orphan Oliver Twist. Set in 1830s Victorian London, it follows the life of the boy as he escapes his orphanage to join a group of young boys who make their living under the direction of the criminal Fagin.\n\nFor the first time ever, Oliver feels a sense of belonging and purpose, even though he and the boys are getting up to no good. He only comes to realize the wrongdoings later on. This movie was so good that it got a staggering 12 Oscar nominations and five wins. Now, that's impressive.\n\nFunny Girl (1968)\n\nThis fabulous 1968 musical film is \"Funny Girl.\" This movie was special because Barbra Streisand tied her Oscar for her role in this film with Katharine Hepburn, which has only happened six times in the history of the Oscars. Furthermore, this movie got seven additional Oscar nominations, and that's no mean feat, even for a film from the '60s.\n\nSet in the early 20th century New York, it follows the life of Fanny Brice, played by Streisand, who is a famous entertainer and comedian. She rises to high places after managing to become one of the Ziegfeld Follies. Beyond the stage, Fanny also wants to have a happy personal life, particularly with the worldly Nicky Arnstein, but things get rocky when his time with her gets affected by how much money he wins or loses as a gambler.\n\nEvita (1996)\n\nThis hit movie is based on the highly successful musical about the profound life story of Evita Duarte. Played by the iconic Madonna, Evita is a B-Picture actress in Argentina who ultimately climbed her way from the poor countryside to become the wife of the nation's president. The story chronicles her tale as she became the object of controversial invocation.\n\nEvita has millions of devoted followers, and as she addresses the nation, she is dressed in the latest high fashion, which leads to her being accused of being a distraction rather than an aid. She continues to make public appearances, which bedazzle some of her supporters, all the while infuriating her enemies. In the end, she dies at the young age of 33 due to illness, which results in a frantic mourning wave that washes throughout the whole country. This flick won an Oscar for Best Original Song.\n\nRocketman (2019)\n\n\"Rocketman\" from 2019 is an epic musical that chronicles the life of a legendary music sensation. It's almost just as dazzling as Elton John himself, on whom it is based. This film is set in England, where Elton hails from, and it chronicles the story of his life, which starts out in his early days at the Royal Academy of Music.\n\nIt was already apparent from his early years that he had enormous musical prodigy potential. Taron Egerton, who played Elton, gave a stellar performance in this jukebox musical, and this film managed to claim an Oscar for its original track \"I'm Gonna Love Me Again.\"\n\nLes Misérables (2012)\n\nThis musical is based on the \"Les Misérables\" classic novel by Victor Hugo, as well as the Broadway stage production of the same name. \"Les Misérables\" is the tale of the prisoner Jean Valjean in the post-French Revolution. Valjean manages to get an early release and attempts to help a desperately poor factory worker, Fantine, and her daughter, Cosette.\n\nThe daughter is being kept as a captive slave by the innholders, and he plans to get her out. Everything changes, though, when the war turns into a gruesome event that no one saw coming. This musical is tragic and sad, and it's bound to cause tears for anyone who watches it. With the 8 Oscar nominations, this film bagged three wins!\n\nPhantom of the Opera (2004)\n\nThis musical takes place at the famed opera house, Opera Populaire, in Paris. The opera house throws a massive gala to celebrate a new team of opera managers, but there's one problem. The leading diva refuses to do her performance due to a mysterious 'Opera Ghost,' which apparently urges the screaming diva to leave.\n\nThe new managers, Andre and Firmin, are determined to find a replacement, so they invoke the talents of the young Christene. She seems fit for the position as she has already been taking lessons from a tutor, but things get messy when the Phantom ends up kidnapping her due to his insane jealousy and obsession. This flick ended up with 3 Oscar and 3 Golden Globe nominations.\n\nNashville (1975)\n\nDirector Albert Altman pushed boundaries with his cinematic storytelling in 1975's \"Nashville.\" This shaggy movie tells the tales of various people who are all connected to one thing — the music business in Nashville. Barbara Jean's position as the reigning queen of Nashville is slowly dwindling. Delbert and Linnea Reese's marriage is on the rocks.\n\nOpal is a journalist from the UK who is touring the region. These stories and others meet to make a dramatic climax that delivers a warts-and-all portrait of America. It's real, and it's raw, and thanks to the original tune \"I'm Easy,\" this movie got an Oscar for Best Original Song.\n\nThe Red Shoes (1948)\n\nIt's possible that no film ever portrayed dance as stunningly as \"The Red Shoes\" from 1948. In this melodramatic musical, there is a lot of desire, lust, longing, and the formidable emotions that come with that. Victoria, portrayed by Moira Shearer, is a talented dancer who ends up getting the opportunity of a lifetime when she gets signed for the fairy tale ballet \"The Red Shoes.\"\n\nAlthough, after falling in love with the ballet's composer, she's compelled to choose between romance or excelling as a great dancer. What ends in a miserable tragedy is told through one of the most tear-jerking dances shown in a movie.\n\nThe Lion King (1994)\n\nThis list wouldn't make sense if \"The Lion King\" wasn't on it. This moving animation from Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff tells a story about a young lion, Simba, who gets cast out of his pride on the commands of his mean uncle, Scar.\n\nThe cub grows up beyond the open savannah with a philosophy that his new friends Timon and Pumbaa teach him. This is: \"No worries, for the rest of your day, it's our problem-free philosophy, hakuna matata.\" Meanwhile, Scar governs with his iron paw. Eventually, Simba reaches a crossroads where he needs to decide if he is going to stop the evil uncle's reign or remain an outcast. This classic won two Oscars, for Best Original Score and Best Original Song.\n\nSwing Time (1936)\n\n\"Swing Time\" tells the ludicrous tale of professional dancer Lucky, who arrives late to his wedding, after which the bride's father gives him an ultimatum to come up with $25,000 if he wants to demonstrate that he is serious about the marriage. Lucky heads to New York, where he meets the dance instructor, Penny.\n\nThe two obviously have crazy chemistry on the dance floor and do a successful nightclub act. As one would expect, they fall in love. However, don't worry, because they both go back to the initial commitments from their previous significant others, and at the end of the day, it all ends well. This musical managed to bag an Oscar for Best Original Song thanks to the original song \"The Way You Look Tonight.\"\n\nInside Llewyn Davis (2013)\n\nWe think this one counts. This indie movie follows a week in the life of a young aspiring singer as he navigates his way through the music scene of New York City in the early 1960s. Llewyn Davis, portrayed by the talented Oscar Isaac, is trying to make a mark on the music industry, but he has so many problems. He's broke most of the time. He doesn't have a decent place to live and is usually crashing on a friend's couch.\n\nHe rarely gets booked on gigs, and his agent doesn't seem to be promoting his most recent album, either. For Davis, it feels like life just keeps repeating itself, and it makes him wonder if he should return to his old sea merchant job. This two-time Oscar-nominated movie boasts a star-studded cast with performances from Carey Mulligan, John Goodman, Justin Timberlake, Adam Driver, and many more.\n\nSeven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)\n\n\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\" took on a rather tricky premise. Adam goes to town to get a wife, and he manages to marry her on the same day. He is the eldest of seven brothers, and only when she goes back home with him to his cabin in the woods does she discover that he and his brothers are all still living together.\n\nThe newlywed Milly is set on teaching these uncivilized siblings some manners, and as far as she can see, they are all pretty eager to get wives of their own. This storyline sounds a bit whacky, but somehow, it turned into an offbeat spectacle, and thanks to the musical talents of Adolph Deutsch and Saul Chaplin, this movie got an Oscar for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture.\n\nYentl (1983)\n\nBarbara Streisand appears on this list a few times in various capacities. In this movie though, she took center stage and showed why she is one of the most talented performers of the last century. In Yentl, she plays a young Jewish woman from early-1900s Poland who pretends to be a man so that she can enroll in a Talmudic school.\n\nThe musical movie is laden with some of the most iconic numbers in Hollywood's history, including \"The Way He Makes Me Feel\" and \"Papa, Can You Hear Me?\" The film received so much praise that it would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, among many other awards.\n\nMamma Mia! (2008)\n\n\"Mamma Mia!\" is one of the most fabulous movies to have come from the late '00s. Set on a sunny Greek island, the movie's whole plot is a background to the stunning collection of music from the legendary ABBA pop sensations. It is a jukebox musical that contains quite a flashy cast, including Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep, and Colin Firth, to name a few.\n\nA young lady who's about to tie the knot discovers that her father could be one of three men who have been mentioned in her mother's diary. She throws all caution to the wind and decides to invite all of these mystery men to her wedding. The part that got us the most was when Streep performed \"The Winner Takes It All.\"\n\nDreamgirls (2006)\n\nAt best, a well-timed musical adaptation has the ability to render revived interest for a once-beloved Broadway play that may otherwise have faded into dust. The two-time Oscar-winning \"Dreamgirls\" was released in 2006, and it was a sure success in that it managed to freshen up the 1981 Broadway show. It did so while still honoring the rich routines that gave it such a good name in the first place.\n\nIt follows the trio of African-American female soul artists as they evolve and manage to get themselves onto the pop charts. It takes place in the tumultuous '60s period, and on top of all the problems in the outside world, these ladies also have their own personal dramas to deal with. You can't really go wrong with a cast that includes Beyonce, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Hudson, and Eddie Murphy, now can you?\n\nThe Jungle Book (1967 and 2016)\n\nThis animated musical was Walt Disney's final creation, and it was released in 1967, just a few months after he passed away. The story of \"The Jungle Book\" was adapted from an 1894 book by Rudyard Kipling. This musical, however, has more memorable characters and catchy tunes than the book had.\n\nThere have been so many remakes of this flick because it's just that good! In 2016, Jon Favreau attempted a redo by directing a live-action hybrid, which to this day remains in the upper limits of Disney remakes, and for the excellent visual effects, this movie managed to win an Oscar."
