        "text": "Anne Hathaway on crash diet for Les Miserables Movie\n\nAnne Hathaway is currently involved in the filming of the Les Miserables movie starring Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe.\n\nShe is playing the role of Fantine who is a single mother forced to turn to prostitution who eventually dies with consumption. To make her look suitably “waif-like” for the role Miss Hathaway has been put on 500 calories a day crash diet to lose 16lbs or more in less than three weeks.\n\nHathaway is by no means overweight and currently a healthy size 10 but she only has 15 to 20 days to lose as much weight as possible. She has already filmed the opening scenes before her world falls apart and she still looks a normal weight.\n\nA representative said: “It’s not ideal but, as with any high-budget movie, there are strict time constraints. Producers have assigned her a personal trainer and she is literally eating nothing more than a couple of apples a day, and some protein – mainly in the form of a shake. Anne knows the risk of such an extreme diet and will undergo weekly medicals to make sure everything is still functioning as it should do.”\n\nLuckily Hathaway is no stranger to having to lose weight for roles as last year she had to slim down to fit into an unforgiving cat suit to play Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises. She also lost weight to play Andrea Sachs in The Devil Wears Prada.\n\nSimon Bowman, Earl Carpenter & Rohan Tickell Three Phantoms Concert in Newcastle\n\nThe Three Phantoms concert is a celebration of musical theatre by three West End stars who have worn the white mask and cape to play the Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s The Phantom of The Opera.\n\nBut this concert is a much wider look at musical theatre, a showcase for the sheer with numbers from Beauty and The Beast, Martin Guerre and Les Miserables, linking the pieces with gentle mocking and comic anecdotes\n\nWith founder members John Owen-Jones touring in The Phantom of the Opera and Matthew Cammelle touring in South Pacific, Earl Carpenter will now be joined by Rohan Tickell and Simon Bowman. Carpenter shows a real comic touch and presentation skills with some great impressions of Michael Crawford\n\nThe trio are joined by the original Canadian Christine Rebecca Caine who has great fun demonstrating her impressive range in Spamalot’s Diva’s Lament and Think of Me from The Phantom of The Opera.\n\nThe piano accompaniment is by Anthony Gabriele with cellist Yvonne Marie Parsons. Choreography is by Adam Cooper (currently starring in Singin’ in the Rain at the Palace Theatre in London).\n\nTheir next concert is at the Theatre Royal Newcastle on 6th & 7th June evenings at 7:30 pm plus a matinee on the 7th at 2:00 pm. Bookings open this morning at 9:00 am at www.theatreroyal.co.uk . Contact Box Office for more details 08448 11 21 21.\n\nLet It Be Beatles Tribute Show at Prince of Wales Theatre in September\n\nA Beatles Tribute musical is due to open at the Prince of Wales Theatre from September 14th to 19th January 2013 between Mamma Mia leaving there on 1st September to re-open at the Novello Theatre on September 6th and The Book of the Mormon starting previews there on 24th February.\n\nThe Broadway show Let It Be: A Tribute To The Beatles presents the history of the Beatles as a concert revue with the four musicians on stage performing 30 of the band's biggest hits live.\n\nThe show begins by recreating the band's debut appearance on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964 with I Want To Hold Your Hand and All My Loving followed by other early numbers including A Hard Day's Night, I Saw Her Standing There, Yesterday, Twist And Shout and Day Tripper.\n\nNot able to use photos or album covers, Let It Be recreates the times with band photos, faux press conferences and other footage and pictures representing the main issues of the '60s.\n\nThe first half concludes with the Sgt. Pepper phase with Strawberry Fields and A Day In The Life, while the second half moves into the band's experimental period with Come Together and Revolution. Ending on a high with the combination of Let It Be and Hey Jude.\n\nBooking opens for Let It Be this Friday 30th March.\n\nDolly Parton's 9 To 5 tour booking opens today\n\nDolly Parton’s musical version of the movie 9 To 5 kicks off a UK tour on October 12th at the Manchester Opera House. So far ten theatres have been booked for the tour which opens at Manchester Opera House on 12th October. It will then visit the New Wimbledon Theatre (22nd-27th October), Sunderland Empire (29th October-3rd November), Woking New Victoria (5th-10th November), Glasgow King's Theatre (12th-17th November), Stoke Regent Theatre (19th-24th November), Edinburgh Playhouse (26th November-1st December), Oxford New Theatre (3rd-8th December), Theatre Royal Brighton (10th-15th December) and Birmingham New Alexandra Theatre (17th December-5 January, 2013).\n\nTickets go on sale today at 9 minutes to 5! (16:51).\n\nDolly wrote the music and lyrics for the stage musical ranging from rockabilly to rhythm and blues. She will be heading to the UK to attend one or two rehearsals. She was in the 1980 film version, with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. 9 to 5 is about female office workers getting their own back on a sexist male boss who goes too far. The book by Patricia Resnick (co-writer of the original screenplay) tells the story of three unlikely friends who conspire to take control of their company and learn there's nothing they can't do - even in a man's world.\n\n9 To 5 played on Broadway from April-September 2009 and was nominated for 15 Drama Desk Awards (the most received by a production in a single year) and four Tony Awards, including Best Score.\n\nDolly Parton said: \"I am so excited that 9 To 5 the Musical is coming to the UK. I'm hoping you have as much fun watching it as I had writing the music for it. 9 to 5 the Musical is perfect for anyone that's ever wanted to string up their boss, which is almost all of us.\"\n\nThe show has been touring in the USA since 2010 and has been redirected by Jeff Calhoun, who took over directing duties from Joe Mantello.\n\nIf 9 To 5 works on tour it may well come in to London’s West End next year.\n\nBarry Manilow still recovering from major hip operation\n\nBarry Manilow had to cancel some shows at the start of his concert tour in the USA because of a hip operation taking longer to heal than expected, but he is now up and running and has kicked off in Illinois.\n\nManilow is now amazingly 69 years old and still recovering from a \"major\" operation to re-attach the muscles to his hip. In his first post-surgery interview Manilow spoke to Rolling Stone about his hip: \"It's coming back slowly – too slowly for me. But I was able to get through six shows. As soon as I'd finish, the curtain would close and I'd fall back into a wheelchair and they'd wheel me back into a dressing room. I'm not ready to do this yet, but I did it. I got through it and I'm better than I was three weeks ago. Everybody thinks I had some sort of a hip replacement; that wasn't it. I had ripped the muscles off my hip on both sides and they had to pull them back and nail them back into my hips. So that kind of surgery, which was supposed to take two hours, took seven hours. It was major surgery and it's a long recovery period. I don't know how I got through those six (shows), but I just couldn't cancel it. These people were out there. They were so excited; I just had to go through this. They say when the spotlight hits you, you don't feel anything. I always thought that was full of shit, (but) it's true”.\n\nThe show he is travelling with and bringing to the UK opening at London’s 02 Arena in May and touring for 5 dates is the smallest he’s ever done with him at the piano accompanied by a small band.\n\nAdam Garcia & Kimberley Wyatt to host Revolution Dance Show at Haymarket\n\nA new West End dance show called Revolution will be playing at the Theatre Royal Haymarket every Sunday evening at 19:30 for six weeks from May 6th to June 10th.\n\nRevolution will be co-hosted by Adam Garcia and Kimberley Wyatt. The show is presented by Dancers Inc will showcase some of the UK's best dance acts with 20 performers from various talent shows including Britain's Got Talent, Got To Dance and So You Think You Can Dance as well as dancers who have been on tour with Take That, Cheryl Cole and The X Factor.\n\nTobias Mead (Britain's Got Talent), Charlie Bruce and Lizzie Gough (So You Think You Can Dance) and Aaron Renfree (We Will Rock You) are among the acts appearing in the show.\n\nTickets available from www.dinc-revolution.com\n\nAmanda Holden confirms hosting Jesus Christ Superstar\n\nAmanda Holden has confirmed that she is hosting the new Andrew Lloyd Webber ITV reality show “Superstar” to find a Jesus to star in his arena tour Jesus Christ Superstar which opens at London’s O2 Arena later this year.\n\nAmanda Holden said: \"As I have a West End background, and I nearly met Jesus the other week, I'm the best qualified. We haven't signed on the dotted line yet, but I am. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to talk about it! They've gone all over the country and Andrew said they've even had some girls auditioning to play Jesus as well.\"\n\nHolden most recently appeared in London's West End as Princess Fiona in Shrek the Musical and is also a judge on “Britain’s Got Talent” which starts again on ITV this Saturday.\n\nMel C and Jason Donovan have been assisting with the call backs for the competition and there is still a strong rumour that Nicole Scherzinger has been approached to play Mary Magdalene.\n\nSierra Boggess in Prince of Broadway\n\nIt seems that Sierra Boggess will not be available to play I in the new musical Rebecca which failed to open on Broadway due to lack of funding earlier this year and is now slated for the autumn. As she is now due to appear in the new Harold Prince tribute Prince of Broadway, with Linda Lavin (The Lyons, Collected Stories), LaChanze (The Color Purple, Once on this Island), David Pittu (Is He Dead?, Lovemusik), Emily Skinner (Billy Elliot, Side Show) and Richard Kind (The Producers, Spin City).\n\nSebastian Arcelus (Elf), Daniel Breaker (Shrek), Josh Grisetti (Enter Laughing), Shuler Hensley (Young Frankenstein), Amanda Kloots-Larsen and Caroline O'Connor also will appear in the show.\n\nPrince will direct the show along with Susan Stroman (The Producers, The Scottsboro Boys) as co-director and choreographer. Due to open on Broadway in November the show has a book by David Thompson and takes its songs from shows in which Prince has been involved including The Phantom of the Opera, Sweeney Todd, A Little Night Music, Cabaret, Evita, West Side Story and The Pajama Game.\n\nThe production also features musical supervision, incidental music, vocal and dance arrangements by Tony Award winner Jason Robert Brown, orchestrations by Don Sebesky and musical direction by Eric Stern.\n\nCelebrating one of the most influential and successful careers in the American theatre of the past 60 years, Prince of Broadway will look at the good and bath circumstances and fortune that led to Hal Prince creating some of the most enduring and popular theatre of all time\n\nKym Marsh & Jodie Prenger playing Elsie Tanner in Corrie Musical\n\nKym Marsh who plays Michelle Connor in Coronation Street is transforming herself into Weatherfield’s scarlet woman and street siren Elsie Tanner.\n\nMarsh will play Elsie in her younger years, while West End diva Jodie Prenger will play her as an older woman (during the 1980s). The musical will premiere in Manchester at the MEN Arena on May 9th and 10th and then visit the Dublin 02 Arena (18th & 19th May): Belfast Odyssey Arena (21st & 22nd May) and Newcastle Metro Radio Arena (29th & 20th May).\n\nElsie was played by the late Pat Phoenix for more than 20 years. Talking about her new role Miss Marsh said: ‘The strong, determined and indomitable women have always defined Coronation Street right from the very first episode to the present day and Elsie Tanner will go down in history as one of the most gossiped about women in Weatherfield. She’s left some rather big stiletto shoes to fill but to have the opportunity to represent such an iconic character of yesteryear on a stage of this scale is an absolute honour.\"\n\nMiss Marsh began her career as a singer and joined pop group Hear’Say after winning the ITV reality show Popstars in 2001.\n\nThe new musical will be hosted by Paul O’Grady and also appearing in Street of Dreams will be Coronation Street veterans Julie Goodyear who played Bet Lynch on TV, Kevin Kennedy who was Curly Watts and Bill Roache, who plays Ken Barlow.\n\nSongs included in the show are Tony Warren's iconic Opening Episode featuring Ena Sharples, Elsie Tanner and Annie Walker, Woman Stanley Woman - Hilda and Stan Ogden's posh second honeymoon at the Savoy Hotel, He's My Man - a catfight on the cobbles between love rivals Elsie Tanner and Bet Lynch, Norman Bates With A Briefcase - featuring serial killer Richard Hillman, Cunning Clever Crafty - Jack and Vera's \"blind date\" with Jack as the suave 'Vince Fontaine' and spectacular Moulin Rouge homage and Sweet Butterfly featuring lovelorn knicker factory worker Sean Tully.\n\nBuy Tickets for Street of Dreams\n\nSondheim's Merrily We Roll Along at Menier in November\n\nUPDATED 28th March: Just announced by the Menier Chocolate Factory as part of their new season.

The conversation will last for 45 minutes and will end with an opportunity for audience members to ask their own questions. Each platform will revolve initially around the guest’s current production and role, before expanding to touch on other aspects of their career and life.\n\nBuy tickets for Lunchtime with Imelda Staunton\n\nLatest Cast List for Les Miserables Film\n\nWith names being added on a daily basis, below is the latest very impressive cast which King's Speech director Tom Hooper has assembled for the movie of Les Miserables which is currently being shot in the UK and France and due to be released in December of this year,\n\nPrincipals: Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, Russell Crowe as Javert; Anne Hathaway as Fantine; Sacha Baron Cohen as Thenardier, Daniel Huttlestone as Gavroche, Helena Bonham Carter as Madame Thenardier; Amanda Seyfried as Cosette; Eddie Redmayne as Marius; Samantha Barks as Eponine; Aaron Tveit as Enjolras; George Blagden as Grantaire, Bertie Carvel as Bamatabois and Colm Wilkinson as the Bishop of Digne\n\nUpdated 16th April 2012: West End stars featuring in the movie include: Frances Ruffelle (original Eponine in Les Mis) Gina Beck (Cosette in London, Christine in Phantom), Killian Donnelly (Raoul in London's Phantom), Daniel Evans (Sunday in the Park With George), Fra Fee (London's Les Mis), Hadley Fraser (Javert in London), Katie Hall (Cosette in the O2 Les Mis), Linzi Hateley (former Eponine), Michael Jibson (Our House, Road Show), Chris Key (London's Les Mis), Alexia Khadime (Eponine in London), Adrian Scarborough (Betty Blue Eyes), Caroline Sheen (Mary Poppins and Les Mis), Katy Secombe (Madame T in London's Les Mis), Jos Slovick (West End Spring Awakening), Hannah Waddingham (Little Night Music, Spamalot, Into The Woods, The Wizard of Oz), Gemma Wardle (Eponine in London), Kerry Ellis (Les Mis, Oliver!, My Fair Lady, Wicked!, We Will Rock You), Alison Jiear (Jerry Springer), Gemma Wardle (Eponine), Claire Foster (Avenue Q, Crazy For You), Nancy Sullivan (Eponine, Never Forget), Lynne Wilmot (Mme Thenardier, Oliver!, Jerry Springer), Ashley Artus (Thenardier), John Barr (Assassins, Bent), Adam Pearce (Evita, Oklahoma!,Love Never Dies), Gabriel Vick (Avenue Q, A Little Night Music) and jazz singer Jacqui Dankworth.\n\nSweeney Todd Broadway Bound?\n\nIn the last two interviews I have heard with Sweeney Todd’s Michael Ball and Imelda Staunton they mention Stephen Sondheim’s involvement, excitement and delight in both in the West End version which is due to open on 20th March and in the cast highlights CD which is due to be released on 2nd April.\n\nCertainly the excerpt they have just played on Graham Norton of Sweeney and Mrs Lovett singing \"Priest\" makes me want to go out a get a copy as soon as it's available. Imelda Staunton stole the show for me and in the cast recording her acting abilities, vocal skills and comedy timing are showcased at their very best.\n\nThey have also said that Sondheim is very keen for this updated version of his show (it is no longer kitsch Victoriania and now set in industrial London East End circa 1930) to transfer to Broadway. It has a limited run at the Adelphi and is currently due to close on Saturday 22nd September 2012.\n\nMichael Ball looks very different as Sweeney as he is wearing a straightened hairpiece at the front and has grown a beard and lost weight (to avoid the obvious headline \"guess who ate all the pies?\") . He said \"it's been great to leave the West End as an overweight mother of one (Edna Turnblad in Hairspray) and come back as serial killer\". He has said he feels Sweeney Todd is Sondheim's greatest piece, and having seen it at Chichester and at previews I must say I agree with him.\n\nAlfie Boe in BBC2 Titanic Commemoration Concert\n\nAlfie Boe will be joining a star studded line-up including Bryan Ferry and Joss Stone in Titanic: A Commemoration in Music and Film, which will broadcast live on BBC 2 at 8:00 pm on April 14th, 100 years after the ill-fated liner hit an iceberg.\n\nThe 90 minute event comes from the Belfast Waterfront which is just across the river from the Harland and Wolff shipyard where the famous ship was built.\n\nIt will include the Ulster Orchestra and massed choir performances and reflect the stories of people associated with the Titanic - its design and construction and those whose lives were changed or lost as a result of its ill-fated north Atlantic journey.Archive and specially commissioned documentary material, accompanied by visual effects, will tell the story of the ship, those who built her and those who perished or survived.\n\nOther performers confirmed to appear include Charlie Siem, one of the UK’s brightest new classical stars, violinist Nicola Benedetti, Colin Morgan (star of BBC One’s Merlin) and Ian McElhinney (City of Ember, Closing the Ring and Game of Thrones).

We have identified the final missing piece of investment and the Shuberts (to whom I shall be forever indebted) have graciously allowed us to resume production to open at the Broadhurst in fall of 2012. Thank you all for you patience and most of all to the extraordinary creative team who have stuck by this fantastic production through thick and thin as Rebecca continues to play in productions throughout the world.\"\n\nIn answer to a question regarding potential casting for the show, or if the previously announced stars would still be with the production Spechrer wrote: \"Rebecca the Musical we will be making casting announcement over the next several weeks.\"\n\nTam Mutu is joining Les Miserables in London playing Inspector Javert in June so it is unlikely he will free.

He has just revealed that Jason Donovan and former Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm are to assist him in the selection process.\n\nMel C and Jason will work with West End casting supremo David Grindrod during the callbacks which are taking place over the next three days when the best contenders are whittled down to a final 40 who will then undergo intensive training sessions before a winner is eventually picked.\n\nBut while the two stars will be helping during the initial stages, Lord Lloyd Webber is yet to announce who will be on the judging panel on the live shows. Previous judges include Charlotte Church, John Barrowman, Bill Kenwright, Barry Humphries and Denise Van Outen.\n\nJason has previously worked with the Lord when he appeared in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Other stage highlights include The Rocky Horror Show, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Priscilla, Queen of the Desert to name a few.\n\nMel C has appeared in Blood Brothers in London's West End and offered advice to contestants who auditioned for the role of Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber said: “I’m pleased to appoint David, Jason and Melanie to assist me with the candidates during Callbacks as I select my final 40 to go further for intensive training. They will be using their unique arena and stage experience to help me narrow down my choices for the live shows. What we’re looking for is a rock star who will go on to sing the role of Jesus in the UK’s first ever arena tour of Jesus Christ Superstar.”\n\nSouth Pacific to take over from The Wizard of Oz at the Palladium?\n\nThe rumour that The Wizard of Oz is due to close to make way for the tour of South Pacific moving into the Palladium in the Autumn is gaining momentum as certain facts that are starting to substantiate this:\n\nFACT: Samantha Womack was due to leave the tour of South Pacific at the beginning of March but is now staying on for the remainder of the run sharing the role of Nellie Forbush with Rebecca Thornhill. The tour is currently scheduled to end at Woking on 21st July.\n\nFACT: The new Wizard and Dorothy - Russell Grant and Sophie Evan - are currently contracted until 13th May so if the ailing show does not continue over the summer months South Pacific could easily be there by the Autumn.\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory Musical delayed until next Autumn\n\nIt was hoped that the new Sam Mendes musical of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory would begin previews at the London Palladium next spring, but it has now been put back until Autumn 2013.\n\nUnder the direction of Mendes and with songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (the team behind Hairspray) using a libretto by David Greig (the man behind the National Theatre of Scotland's fantastical version of Peter Pan) the new musical is eagerly anticipated. Designer Mark Thompson has already begun preliminary work on how The Chocolate Factory will look and Peter Darling will choreograph.\n\nIt will follow in the very successful footsteps of Roald Dahl's Matilda which is going great guns at the Cambridge and due to open on Broadway next year.\n\nRussell Grant's Emergency Knee Operation takes him away from Oz\n\nRussell Grant was plagued by an injured knee when he was appearing in Strictly Come Dancing last year.\n\nHe put off an operation to carry on appearing in the show and is currently playing the Wizard of Oz at the London Palladium but his knee hasn’t held out as hoped and he has to have an emergency operation on Saturday.\n\nHe is starting physio on Tuesday and aiming to back in the Land of Oz week commencing 22nd March. He is contracted to stay with show until 13th May.

They also made a cast recording of the highlights of Sweeney Todd last weekend which is due to be released\n\nMichael Ball has regrown his beard in readiness for the role and he and Imelda Staunton have just been interviewed on the Jonathan Ross Show. One piece of breaking news is that Robert Burt who is playing Pirelli is away for a month during the run and comedian Jason Manford will be taking over his role. Manford won ITV's Born to Shine where celebrities put their new taught skills to the test in aid of Save the Children with his rendition of a Verdi aria. He has a good operatic voice and has always wanted to appear in a musical guesting on Alfie Boe's Bring Him Home tour earlier this year.\n\nAccording to Jason's Facebook page he is performing Pirelli from 2nd - 28th July and 15th 18th and 24th August\n\nVictoria Beckham Delays Spice Girls Musical\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail Victoria Beckham’s fashion career is taking precedence over the new Spice Girls musical Viva Forever which is being produced by Judy Craymer and written by Jennifer Saunders. Other projects included performances at the Olympics opening ceremony and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee concert with a big budget TV show also on the cards.\n\nThe plan was for Victoria Beckham, Geri Halliwell, Melanie Chisholm, Emma Bunton and Melanie Brown to lead a nationwide search to find the main characters for their West End show in a format similar to Andrew Lloyd Webber’s talent searches.\n\nBut plans have now been shelved as Victoria refuses to rejoin the band for new projects because she feels she is finally being taken seriously as a fashion designer and doesn’t want to jeopardise her new career.\n\nMel B is believed to be keen to push ahead with the TV show with a source telling the Mail: “Mel B is desperate for this show to happen. All the other girls would consider it, but Victoria has made her feelings very clear. Other than attending the world premiere of the musical, she wants to focus on her fashion career. She would be fine with the other four going ahead without her, but Emma doesn’t believe that’s the right thing to do.” Baby Spice Emma Bunton insists that the show doesn’t happen unless all five Spice Girls are involved.\n\nMatilda's Tim Minchin to Write New Musical\n\nTim Minchin is riding high in London’s West End after turning Roald Dahl’s Matilda into a critically acclaimed and commercially successful musical which is heading for Broadway next year\n\n.\n\nBut the talented British-born, Australian-raised writer has told The Standard that he going to write an original play against the advice of theatre impresarios Lord Lloyd-Webber, Sir Cameron Mackintosh and Stephen Sondheim.\n\nThey all urged him to choose a classic story for a new show, but Minchin says he is \"Desperate to do the opposite. I want to go back into my studio and get on my piano, and just see what I feel like writing. My suspicion is I will feel like writing a musical I've been thinking about since I was 18. It's an original story, which is apparently what musicals can't be. Andrew Lloyd Webber, Stephen Sondheim and Cameron Mackintosh have all told me to my face I should concentrate on classic stories, and that makes me want to ignore them. Matilda's running and I've got my career in comedy, so I can handle a failure. It's a love story, quite dark: the lovers don't meet until quite late in the piece. It's about fate and destiny, quite a Greek-style drama with meddling, incompetent gods.”\n\nGood luck to him I say as Matilda is one of the best thing's I've seen in the West End for a long while.\n\nKerry Ellis and Kaiser Chiefs Ricky Wilson to join Jeff Wayne’s new The War of the Worlds Arena Tour\n\nThe producers of Jeff Wayne’s The War of the Worlds: the New Generation – Alive on Stage promised they would announce two of the guest artistes who will be appearing in the new production when it opens at Dublin’s 02 Arena on 29th November.\n\nThe first name to be revealed is West End star Kerry Ellis playing Beth.
