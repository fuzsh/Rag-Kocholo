        "text": "I’m never not amazed by the eclectic lineups offered at the start of each month on Netflix. The mix of comedy and drama and romance, of high-octane action and quiet, slow-burning thrillers, of family-friendly adventure and dark, acerbic social commentary—honestly, it makes my job super hard. How do you pick the ten best movies in a month like this? Regardless, I’ve done just that, as July 2024 features some obvious winners, such as the return of the most iconic comedic character of the 1980s, perhaps the most defining romance of the past ten years, and the successor to Studio Ghibli’s latest awe-inspiring tale of fantastical friendship. It’s all here, and it’s all awesome.\n\nSo without further ado, let’s get into it. In the first section below, you’ll find what I believe to be the ten best new films added to Netflix so far this month. Then at the bottom of the article, you’ll find a full list of every single new option available to subscribers in July. If this list seems daunting, if it seems impossible to choose the right movie, just remember: that’s a good thing.\n\nThe 10 Best New Movies On Netflix In July 2024\n\nNote: this list covers all releases leading up to July 7, 2024.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop 4: Axel F (2024)\n\nThe long-awaited return is finally upon us: Eddie Murphy is back as his iconic character in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley, a revival of a hilarious series that delivers just as much action as comedy (seriously, check out the second and third parts of the trilogy). Directed by Mark Molloy and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, this installment finds Axel back in Beverly Hills, this time fighting to protect his family. When his daughter Jane (Taylour Paige) becomes entangled in a dangerous conspiracy, he teams up with Detective Bobby Abbott (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to unravel the mystery, with old friends Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) return to assist in the investigation. With Murphy’s signature blend of humor and grit, the film explores the stark once again entertainingly contrasts between Detroit and the glitz of Beverly Hills, providing a nostalgic yet modern experience of a fantastic formula.\n\nThe Imaginary (2024)\n\nIf you’re a major fan of Studio Ghibli, then you need to be aware of their potential successor: Studio Ponoc. While the studio, which was founded by Ghibli’s former lead producer Yoshiaki Nishimura, has pumped out two great films, Mary and the Witch’s Flower and Modest Heroes, Ponoc is primed for a much bigger entrance thanks to a deal it struck with Netflix. And it’s first project as part of that collaboration is The Imaginary. In this family-friendly film directed by Yoshiyuki Momose, we enter a world where the boundaries between reality and imagination blur. This animated production follows Rudger, the invisible friend of a young girl named Amanda. But when Amanda stops believing in him, Rudger is transported to the Town of Imaginaries, a haven for forgotten companions facing an existential threat. Nishimura aims to weave together a narrative that is both whimsical and moving, capturing the essence of childhood wonder and the fear of being forgotten.\n\nLife (2017)\n\nI remember back in 2017 being blown away that a sci-fi film would be starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds and Rebecca Ferguson—three powerhouse actors in the midst of their prime. But, then...the movie came, and the movie went, to little to no fanfare. And to this day, I have no idea why, because it’s such an engrossing experience. In Life, a routine mission aboard the International Space Station turns into a nightmare when a crew of astronauts discovers a rapidly evolving life form. Directed by Daniel Espinosa, who gave us movies like Morbius and Safe Safe House, this sci-fi thriller features those three stars as part of a team that must fight for survival against an alien organism threatening all life on Earth. Espinosa provides a fantastically claustrophobic atmosphere for his three leads, who inhabit such interesting characters as they navigate the inherent tension and suspense created by the carefully controlled pacing and rhythm of the film. This is a great film many people are still waiting to discover.\n\nGoing Clear: Scientology and The Prison of Belief (2015)\n\nAlex Gibney, one of the most prolific and relevant documentarians of our time, has investigated some of the most pertinent matters of society in recent years, from the United States’ use of torture in Taxi to the Dark Side to financial corruption in Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room to the danger of entrepreneurship in The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley. But perhaps his most damning examination came in the form of Going Clear: Scientology and The Prison of Belief, a gripping documentary that delves into the secretive world of Scientology. Based on Lawrence Wright’s acclaimed book, the film features interviews with former high-ranking officials and members, as well as incriminating archival footage and persuasive narration, revealing the inner workings and controversial practices of the religious organization. Through powerful personal stories and detailed investigations, Gibney exposes the psychological manipulation and alleged abuses within Scientology.\n\nEasy A (2010)\n\nIt’s been incredible to watch the meteoric rise of Emma Stone, who started her career with small parts in movies like Superbad, The House Bunny and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. But after a more substantial role in a relatively big hit, Zombieland, she got her chance to shine in Easy A—a witty, modern take on Nathaniel Hawthorne's “The Scarlet Letter” that had me immediately thinking, “Oh, Emma Stone is destined to be a star.” Directed by Will Gluck, who helmed other romantic comedies like Anyone But You and Friends With Benefits, this teen flick follows Olive Penderghast (played by Stone), a high school student whose little white lie about losing her virginity spirals into a full-blown scandal. As Olive embraces her newfound notoriety, she wanders the pitfalls of teenage life with humor and intelligence. Packed full with charismatic performances from the likes of Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson and Amanda Bynes, Easy A embraces a vibrant, bright and colorful visual style that keeps its modern update upbeat and lighthearted throughout, offering a fast-paced narrative that successfully balances humor and heart.\n\nMagic Mike XXL (2015)\n\nEvery time Magic Mike XXL is added to Netflix, I can’t help but recommend it in these articles. It’s my sworn duty as this world’s biggest fan (it’s legitimately in my top five movies ever), as someone who feels obligated to highlight just how wonderfully charming and overwhelmingly positive this celebratory experience is. Three years after leaving the stripper life behind, Mike Lane (played by the infinitely watchable Channing Tatum) decides to reunite with his old crew for one last hurrah. Directed by Gregory Jacobs, Magic Mike XXL takes the audience on a road trip filled with unpretentious male camaraderie, effortless laughter, and spectacularly choreographed dance routines bathed in atmospheric lighting and bold colors. With an unstoppable cast that includes Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello and Jada Pinkett Smith, not to mention other great performers like Elizabeth Banks, Donald Glover and Andie MacDowell (who, in my opinion, gives the best performance of the movie), the film thrives in its focus on empowerment and positivity, focusing more on companionship and togetherness than conflicts and nadirs. This is a special experience that leaves me feeling optimistic about the world every time I watch it.\n\nAmerican Psycho (2000)\n\nNo movie challenges your concept of perception quite like American Psycho. Who is who? Did that really just happen? Or was it all in Patrick’s head? It’s easily the most successful movie to ever actively gaslight its audience throughout, to the point where you’re not sure what you even just watched once the credits roll—and I love the movie for that. Christian Bale delivers the best performance of his career as Patrick Bateman, a wealthy New York City investment banker who leads a double life as a serial killer. Set in the materialistic 1980s, this adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’ famous novel satirizes the excesses of the era while creating a disturbing portrait of a man—the everyman, really—consumed by his own vanity and madness. The film’s satirical tone has gained more and more bite as the years pass by and materialism continue to grip society, resulting in a darkly hilarious examination of American culture that obsesses over the perpetual identity and duality crises that collectively grip us.\n\nPan (2015)\n\nNot every Joe Wright movie is my favorite. But when his films hit...man, do they hit. His lesser projects, in my opinion, have been the most fascinating, with movies like Hanna and The Woman in the Window offering the sorts of bold, stylized sequences that allow his characters and stories to flourish. I believe that is also the case with Pan, which reimagines the beloved tale of Peter Pan with a fresh origin story that’s emboldened by a vivid visual aesthetic. This fantasy adventure film stars Levi Miller as Peter, an orphan who discovers his destiny in the magical world of Neverland. Alongside Garrett Hedlund as James Hook and Hugh Jackman as the villainous Blackbeard, as well as outstanding showings from side characters like Rooney Mara, Amanda Seyfried and Cara Delevingne, Miller’s Peter embarks on a journey to become the hero he was meant to be. This fresh take on a classic story is greatly aided by bold musical choices, by an innovative use of special effects, by a whimsical and playful tone that never feels forced, always feels pure.\n\nJigsaw (2017)\n\nIt’s been fascinating to watch the Saw franchise grow over the years—the constant change in directors and casts, the introduction of wild elements to its ever-building mythology, the exhilarating ups and inevitable downs. Any horror franchise with ten-plus installments if bound for some high and low moments, and Saw has sure had its fair share of each. And while nobody ever seemed to match director James Wan’s original abrasive entry into the series, identical twin brothers Peter and Michael Spierig (most known for their sci-fi thriller Predestination) came close. In this eighth addition to the Saw franchise, the infamous Jigsaw killer returns with a series of gruesome games designed to test the limits of human willpower. As bodies start appearing around the city, each bearing the killer’s signature, detectives race against time to uncover the mastermind behind the new wave of terror. With a cast including Matt Passmore, Callum Keith Rennie, and Hannah Emily Anderson, Jigsaw features dynamic camera work that carries a sense of urgency and suspense, some intricate traps and franchise-best set pieces, and a legitimately interesting exploration of morality and justice.\n\nCall Me By Your Name (2017)\n\nLuca Guadagnino has been praised for delivering critical darlings like Suspiria, Bones and All and I Am Love, but there are two other movies that stand above the rest. The latest one was Challengers, which embraced heightened drama, immersive cinematography and raw sexuality that carried his aesthetic to new grounds. But the tenderness found in Challengers may not have existed if not for Guadagnino’s first hit, Call Me By Your Name. Set against the idyllic backdrop of 1980s Italy, this sensory experience serves as a tender and evocative tale of first love as it follows the blossoming romance between 17-year-old Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer), a charming American scholar staying with Elio’s family for the summer. Their relationship unfolds with a beautiful, slow-burning intensity, exploring the innate nature of desire and the slow, inevitable passage of time. The combination of lush cinematography, naturalistic performances and a haunting score by Sufjan Stevens allows Call Me By Your Name to become a deeply emotional and visually stunning film that captures the ephemeral nature of summer love like no other modern film has before or since.\n\nEvery New Movie on Netflix in July 2024"
