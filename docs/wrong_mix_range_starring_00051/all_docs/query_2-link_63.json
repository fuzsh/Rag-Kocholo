        "text": "While you're spending your summer sunbathing, cooling down with an iced coffee or busy at your desk working, filming is taking place at multiple locations throughout Westchester.\n\nAccording to OnLocationVacations, the Peacock drama \"Poker Face\" starring Natasha Lyonne, filmed at 59 Castle Place in New Rochelle July 8 and 9. The castle-like building is located on the College of New Rochelle's former campus.\n\nAnd, on July 17th, Apple TV's \"Swipe,\" will be filming in Rye, taking over a portion of the Highland Road parking lot and part of Car Park 4, according to MyRye.com. The film crew has been here before, namely in April when actor Jon Hamm was photographed at Sunshine Coffee Roasters and The Snackery.\n\nIn the show, Hamm plays a former hedge-fund-manger-turned-petty-criminal. The show also stars Olivia Munn and Amanda Peet.\n\nEagle-eyed viewers may have also spotted familiar locations on some of their other favorite shows. \"The Crowded Room\" (Apple TV+); \"Feud: Capote vs. The Swans\" (FX, Hulu); \"The Gilded Age\" (HBO); \"The Girls on the Bus\" (HBO); \"Leave the World Behind\" (Netflix); \"Succession\" (HBO); \"Severance\" (Apple TV+) and \"Life and Beth\" (Hulu) were also filmed in the county.\n\nMore: Film, TV productions in Westchester yielded $2 billion in economic activity, county says\n\nDespite the pandemic and two industry strikes (Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA unions) in 2022 and 2023, film production in Westchester yielded $2 billion in economic activity, 6,796 jobs and $656 million in wages.\n\nWestchester County Tourism & Film Director Natasha Caputo attributed the county's collaborative approach to aiding in that success while Westchester County Executive George Latimer said that what makes the film business work here in the area's diverse locations, film-friendly communities and a skilled and supportive network of people and businesses.\n\nFilming is equally as busy across the river. In March, Nyack's Wasabi restaurant was transformed into Purdy's, an eatery that was, as it read on the signage, \"established in 1983 in Burlington, Vermont\" for \"The Life List,\" a show based on a novel with the same name by Lori Nelson Spielman. It stars Sofia Carson (\"Purple Hearts\"), Kyle Allen (\"West Side Story\") and Connie Britton (\"The White Lotus\") and is about a woman on a quest to complete her childhood bucket list.\n\nGot a celebrity tip?\n\nSee a celebrity spotting or filming?
