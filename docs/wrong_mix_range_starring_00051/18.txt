Amanda Michelle Seyfried (born December 3, 1985) is an American actress, model and singer. She began her career as a model when she was 11 and her acting career at 15 with recurring parts on the soap operas "As the World Turns" (1999-2001) and "All My Children" (2003).

Seyfried made her feature film debut in the 2004 teen comedy film "Mean Girls". She auditioned to play the role of Regina George in "Mean Girls"; the role eventually went to Rachel McAdams. While she was initially considered to play the lead role of Cady Heron, played by Lindsay Lohan, the producers of the film decided that Seyfried should play Karen Smith, Regina's dim-witted "Plastic" friend and sidekick. The film was a box office success, earning over US$129 million in its theatrical run.

She then had had supporting roles in independent films such as "Nine Lives" (2005) and "Alpha Dog" (2006). She had a recurring role on the United Paramount Network (UPN) television series "Veronica Mars" (2004â€“2006), as well as the Home Box Office (HBO) series "Big Love" (2006-2011). Seyfried starred in the musical feature film "Mamma Mia!" (2008) and reprised her role in the sequel, "Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again" (2018).
