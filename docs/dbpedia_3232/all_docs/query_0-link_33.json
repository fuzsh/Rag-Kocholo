Th ­ ere are, however, some exceptions to this rule. Many of the Moroccan authors I discuss in this book write in multiple languages, including Arabic and one or many Eu­ro­pean languages. If I am referring exclusively or primarily to an author’s Arabic-­language body of work, then I transliterate his or her name according to the IJMES system. In the case of authors whose work is primarily in Eu­ro­pean languages, I default to the spelling preferred by the author in question—­which, in the case of Maghribi authors, often follows French orthographic conventions. Thus, for ­example, I write “Abdelmajid Benjelloun” rather than “ʿAbd al-­Majid bin Jallun.” For place names, such as Tangier and Tetouan, I give the standard transliterations that are in common use in English-­language maps and guides.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTetouan, the former capital of the Spanish Protectorate in ­Morocco (1912–1956), sits in the Martil River valley, a few kilo­meters from Morocco’s Mediterranean coast and just south of the Strait of Gibraltar. The city is divided into an old city (the Medina), which dates back to the fifteenth ­century, and a colonial annex (the Ensanche) built by the Spanish in the early twentieth ­century.1 If you exit the old city through the Cemetery Gate (Bab al-­Maqabir), you ­w ill come across the main Muslim cemetery, which straddles the road and creeps up neighboring Mount Dersa. The cemetery affords a panoramic view of Tetouan, whose sand-­colored walls and whitewashed buildings accentuate the many shades of green that color the river valley and the face of Mount Ghurghiz, on the other side of the valley (Figure 1). The gulls that float and screech overhead are reminders of the proximity of the Mediterranean Sea, which appears in the distance. The bird calls mingle with the sound of hammering that wafts in from the nearby carpentry workshops. Tetouan’s cemetery is a point of transit that connects the artisanal quarters of the old city with the poor neighborhoods that abut the cemetery. Old men in djellabas and young men in tracksuits plow along the cemetery’s narrow paths, without having much time to notice the tombs that they pass. Throughout the cemetery, goats graze among the clumps of overgrown grass and u ­ nder the shade of palm, cedar, and fig trees. The cemetery’s most prominent feature is a whitewashed mausoleum, with green tile trim, that ­houses the remains of two men who died five centuries apart: Abu al-­Hasan ʿAli al-­Manzari, the city’s\n\n2\n\nI ntroduction\n\nFigure 1.

Amid the quiet abandonment of Tetouan’s main cemetery, the large and faded mausoleum caught my eye. Who was al-­Manzari? Who was al-­Turris? Why w ­ ere they buried together? The first two questions ­were easy to answer, but the third one turned out to be an enigma that has kept me thinking for the past several years. The surprising u ­ nion of al-­Manzari and al-­Turris, whose lives ­were separated by five hundred years, illustrates a larger story about Moroccan history that this book seeks to tell. Through this story, I hope to change the way that we imagine the relationship between Spain and Morocco, the medieval and the modern, as well as between colonialism and anticolonial re­sis­tance in North Africa and the M ­ iddle East.\n\nI ntroduction\n\n3\n\nFigure 2. Mausoleum of al-­Manzari and al-­Turris in Tetouan, May 2016. Photograph © Eric Calderwood.\n\nAl-­Manzari, Tetouan’s founder, hailed from Granada, the last Muslim kingdom in al-­Andalus (medieval Muslim Iberia). The son of a wealthy Granadan f­amily, al-­Manzari served as the commander of the military outpost at Píñar, between Granada and its northern border with the Christian kingdom of Castile. Píñar fell to Castilian forces in 1485. Its loss was a prelude to the Christian occupation of Granada in 1492, which concluded the Christian Reconquest of al-­Andalus and brought to a close nearly eight centuries of Muslim rule in Iberia. Al-­Manzari did not remain in his native al-­Andalus to see the Catholic Monarchs enter Granada on January 2, 1492. Rather than submitting to Christian rule, al-­Manzari preferred exile in a new country. In 1484 or 1485, around the time of the conquest of Píñar, al-­Manzari emigrated to northern Morocco with a band of a few dozen followers.3 ­There, he oversaw the rebuilding of Tetouan on top of the remains of an older settlement.\n\n4\n\nI ntroduction\n\nTetouan would eventually emerge as the cultural capital of northern Morocco and as a point of contact and exchange between Eu­rope and Africa, but the city that al-­Manzari and his followers built was essentially a garrison town: a heavi­ly fortified citadel whose walls enclosed a mosque and a public bath (both still standing ­today), and a handful of h ­ ouses.4 Al-­Manzari prob­ably conceived of Tetouan as a provisional base for taking back Granada and the other conquered cities of al-­Andalus. Instead, Tetouan became a permanent settlement, which grew quickly over the next two de­cades. In 1492, with the Christian conquest of Granada, waves of Andalusis, including some Granadan Jews, left the Iberian Peninsula and settled in Tetouan and other Moroccan cities. While many Andalusi Muslims emigrated from the Iberian Peninsula in 1492, many also chose to remain in Granada. The Capitulations of Granada, the peace treaty signed with the Catholic Monarchs, guaranteed that the new rulers would re­spect the Muslims’ religious practices, private property, and right to emigrate.5 In 1500, however, the Spanish began a brutal campaign to force Spanish Muslims to convert to Chris­ tian­ity.6 In response, many Muslims fled Spain for North Africa, never to return. In the first de­cade of the sixteenth ­century, Tetouan’s population jumped from two thousand to over ten thousand, swelled by the massive arrival of refugees from Spain.7 Al-­Manzari continued to rule Tetouan ­until his death in late 1540 or early 1541. He died without fulfilling his dream of returning to al-­ Andalus, but the city that he and his followers built included a few echoes of the Granada that they had left ­behind. For example, near the remains of al-­Manzari’s Casbah stands a covered gateway that was modeled on the Gate of Justice in Granada’s Alhambra.8 In the neighborhoods clustered around al-­Manzari’s Casbah, the doors of the oldest h ­ ouses are decorated with iron pomegranates, in order to signal their ­owners’ descent from Granada (which means “pomegranate” in Spanish). Outside the city walls, Tetouan’s cemetery is punctuated with domed cubical structures, known as qubbas, which w ­ ere a common architectural feature in Andalusi cemeteries. ­These domed cubes ­were built in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth c­ entury as mausoleums for the Granadan mujahidin who accompanied al-­Manzari across the Strait of Gibraltar.9 Al-­Manzari’s mausoleum, in contrast, was not built in the sixteenth ­century. In fact, al-­Manzari’s final resting place underwent an impor­\n\nI ntroduction\n\n5\n\ntant transformation in the second half of the twentieth ­century. Up ­until Moroccan in­de­pen­dence in 1956, al-­Manzari had his own grave in Tetouan’s cemetery. It was a modest tomb surrounded by four low walls. A picture of al-­Manzari’s original tomb appears in the first volume of Muhammad Dawud’s encyclopedic History of Tetouan (Tarikh Titwan), published in 1959 (Figure 3). Dawud was part of a generation of Moroccan nationalist intellectuals who contributed to the revival of Morocco’s Andalusi heritage, from cultural practices like Andalusi ­music to foundational figures like al-­Manzari. In the 1960s, a group of Tetouani civic leaders formed a committee to design a new mausoleum for Tetouan’s Andalusi found­er.10 The committee commissioned the architect Saʿd Binnuna to design the mausoleum. The architect was the youn­gest son of ʿAbd al-­Salam Binnuna, often hailed as the ­father of the Moroccan nationalist movement.11 The committee that oversaw the mausoleum proj­ect also included several prominent Moroccan nationalists from the north, such as ʿAbd al-­K haliq al-­Turris. Al-­Turris’s interest in Tetouan’s Andalusi founder is not surprising. Throughout his c­ areer, al-­Turris closely aligned himself with the cultural memory of al-­A ndalus. Like many leaders of the Moroccan ­nationalist movement, he claimed descent from al-­Andalus.12 In fact, his last name comes from the Spanish surname Torres, which is the spelling that al-­Turris ­adopted when writing his name in Latin script. In a 1936 speech in support of Franco’s military uprising in the Spanish Civil War, al-­Turris asserted that Moroccans enjoy a “spiritual ­union” with the Spanish ­because they all descend from “a single ­family” that traces its roots back to al-­Andalus.13 ­After Moroccan in­de­pen­dence, al-­ Turris served as Morocco’s first ambassador to Spain. In the 1960s, he remained active in several po­liti­cal and cultural proj­ects, including the committee that oversaw the building of the mausoleum for al-­Manzari. Al-­Turris and his colleagues deci­ded to build the new mausoleum on top of al-­Manzari’s original tomb. The proj­ect was in its final stages when al-­Turris died suddenly of a heart attack in May of 1970. He was buried in the mausoleum that he helped to design. Al-­Manzari’s shared mausoleum with al-­Turris elides a temporal gap of five centuries. It unites, u ­ nder one roof, the history of Tetouan’s Andalusi foundation, embodied by al-­Manzari, and the history of the Moroccan nationalist movement, embodied by al-­Turris. The building thus\n\n6\n\nI ntroduction\n\nFigure 3. Al-­Manzari’s original tomb in Tetouan.

It epitomizes an idea that I ­w ill be calling, in this book, the “Andalus-­centric” narrative of Moroccan history. According to this narrative, the culture of al-­Andalus did not dis­appear in 1492, with the Christian Reconquest of Muslim Granada; rather, Andalusi culture migrated from the Iberian Peninsula to Morocco, where it has continued to thrive u ­ ntil the pres­ent day. Cele­brations of Morocco’s Andalusi identity abound in con­temporary Moroccan lit­er­a­ture, historiography, and po­liti­cal discourse. For instance, the Moroccan historian M’hammad Benaboud has argued: The footprints of al-­Andalus in Morocco remain deeply rooted, both in cities and in the countryside, and they constitute an integral part of the Moroccan sociocultural fabric. The profound integration of the Andalusi heritage into daily life, at a collective and individual level, is so impor­tant that it is even reflected in the be­hav­ior and consciousness of the Moroccan, whose identity would not be comprehensible without it.14\n\nI ntroduction\n\n7\n\nMany Moroccan, Eu­ro­pean, and American scholars echo Benaboud’s assertion that the legacy of al-­A ndalus is an essential component of ­Moroccan identity and culture.15 Such assertions are not limited to scholarly writings. Al-­Andalus also figures prominently in con­temporary Moroccan artistic production. In lit­er­a­ture, some of Morocco’s most eminent novelists and poets, such as Bin Salim Himmish and Ahmad Tribaq, have written impor­tant works with Andalusi themes.16 Andalusi ­music is Morocco’s national ­music and is commonly featured on national tele­vi­sion, at official functions, and at weddings and other cele­ brations.17 Al-­Andalus has even made the leap to the big screen, where it has served as the setting for popu­lar Moroccan films, such as Said Naciri’s Abdou in the Time of the Almohads (2006).18 Fi­nally, al-­Andalus is one of the d ­ rivers b ­ ehind tourism to Morocco, the country’s second largest source of income.19 Since 1992, the fifth centennial of the fall of Granada, Morocco and Spain have collaborated on a number of tourism initiatives and traveling exhibitions that promote the two countries’ shared Andalusi heritage.20 While several cities compete for the mantle of Morocco’s most Andalusi city, Tetouan, the former capital of the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, has emerged in the past two de­cades as a major hub for the cele­bration of al-­Andalus in con­temporary Morocco. Tetouan’s cultural scene and tourism industry revolve around the memory of al-­Andalus. Its annual Festival of Andalusi ­Music brings together the leading Andalusi orchestras from Tetouan, Tangier, Fez, and Rabat. Dozens of local businesses are named a­ fter places or p ­ eople from Andalusi history, including a cafe, a hair salon, and a jewelry store that all share the name “Granada.” Historians from both sides of the Mediterranean extol ­Tetouan’s connection to al-­Andalus—­and, in par­tic­u ­lar, to Granada. In fact, many scholars refer to Tetouan as “the ­daughter of Granada,” a nickname for Tetouan that was coined by the nationalist M’hammad Binnuna in the 1950s.21 When UNESCO declared Tetouan’s old city a World Heritage Site in 1997, its report called Tetouan “a true synthesis of Moroccan and Andalusian cultures,” and it praised the “clear Andalusian influence” of Tetouan’s art and architecture.22 For many Moroccan writers, al-­Andalus’s influence on Tetouan goes far beyond architecture and encompasses domains as diverse as cuisine, clothing, handicrafts, dialect, and even temperament.23 In 1999, Muhammad al-­Sabbagh, Tetouan’s\n\n8\n\nI ntroduction\n\nmost famous con­temporary poet, published a book called I Am al-­ Andalus (Ana al-­Andalus). The title indicates the intense sense of identification that many Tetouanis feel with al-­Andalus. This phenomenon is not limited, however, to Tetouan. Morocco’s Andalusi identity has become a m ­ atter of national doctrine. Even the most recent Moroccan constitution, ratified in 2011, propagates the idea that modern Moroccan culture descends directly from al-­Andalus. The constitution’s preamble highlights the influence of al-­Andalus on Moroccan national identity and affirms “the Moroccan p ­ eople’s attachment to the values of openness, moderation, tolerance, and dialogue.”24 The constitution thus aligns Morocco with one of the most potent modern myths associated with al-­A ndalus: the idea that al-­A ndalus was an ­exceptionally tolerant place, where Muslims, Christians, and Jews peacefully coexisted. This idea is known, in Spanish, as convivencia (“coexistence”). Many scholars have warned that it is anachronistic to use the modern concept of tolerance to describe interfaith relations in the M ­ iddle Ages.25 Despite this objection, the myth of Andalusi tolerance has become quite power­ful in the post-9 / 11 era, when it has served as a counterweight to the “clash of civilizations” mentality that underwrote the Bush-­era “war on terror.”26 Since 2001, Morocco has leveraged its historical connection to al-­Andalus in order to pres­ent itself as a model of interfaith tolerance and as an intermediary between the Muslim world and the West.27 Al-­Andalus is not only a means of articulating Morocco’s relationship with the West; it also functions as a sign of prestige and power within Moroccan domestic politics. During the colonial period, many of the leaders of the Moroccan nationalist movement emphasized their Andalusi ancestry. T ­ oday, Moroccans of Andalusi descent are still a po­liti­cal elite that enjoys close ties to the royal f­ amily.28 In short, al-­A ndalus is a power­f ul tool for understanding social relations in Morocco and also for mapping Morocco’s understanding of its place in the world. Colonial al-­Andalus argues that Morocco’s Andalusi identity is not a medieval legacy, but is, instead, a modern invention that emerged from the colonial encounter between Spain and Morocco in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Starting with the Spanish-­Moroccan War of 1859–1860, Spanish writers revived the memory of al-­Andalus in order\n\nI ntroduction\n\n9\n\nto emphasize Spain’s historical connection to North Africa and to justify Spain’s colonial presence in Morocco.29 The exploitation of Spain’s Muslim past reached its apogee in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), when Francisco Franco led a military uprising that toppled the Spanish Republic. During the Civil War, Franco and his collaborators used the memory of al-­Andalus as a tool to recruit approximately eighty thousand Moroccan soldiers to fight in their rebel army.30 To ensure Moroccan support for the rebel cause, Franco also granted unpre­ce­dented freedoms to the Moroccan nationalist movement, including the creation of an Arabic-­language nationalist press and the legalization of nationalist parties. From t­hese institutions of Moroccan nationalist politics, forged in the opening months of the Spanish Civil War, emerged a widespread call for the creation of a Moroccan national culture, whose cornerstone would be Morocco’s Andalusi heritage. Thus, in one of the eloquent ironies of colonial history, the Spanish insistence on Morocco’s Andalusi heritage, which had served as a justification for Spanish colonialism, galvanized the Moroccan national culture that would supplant colonial rule. A Spanish way of talking about Morocco became a Moroccan way of talking about Morocco. This book advances the claim that Morocco’s Andalusi identity is a product of the colonial encounter between Spain and Morocco. U ­ ntil now, it has been difficult to see this argument clearly ­because it runs ­counter to many common assumptions about Morocco, Spain, and the relationship between Eu­rope and North Africa. First of all, my argument exposes some uncomfortable alliances between p ­ eople and proj­ects that we do not normally place side by side: Spanish fascists and Moroccan nationalists, Catholics and Muslims, and colonizing and colonized subjects. Acknowledging ­these alliances may provoke cognitive dissonance, and even some pain, especially for Moroccan po­liti­cal elites and cultural luminaries, who have invested significant energy in promoting their country’s Andalusi identity. This book’s story also cuts against the grain of the existing scholarship on Morocco and North Africa, which has focused, almost exclusively, on the history of French colonialism in North Africa. This focus has not only marginalized modern Spanish-­ Moroccan relations, but it has also limited the conceptual categories that we use to understand colonialism and its long-­term impact on colonized\n\n10\n\nI ntroduction\n\nsocie­ties. Rather than conceiving of colonialism and anticolonial nationalism as two opposing forces, this book, instead, shows how they often work as two sides of the same coin, reinforcing each other and reproducing each other’s logic. Fi­nally, my study attempts to distinguish rigorously between the history of medieval al-­Andalus and the vari­ous meanings and uses that that history has accrued in modern times. This approach might encounter some re­sis­tance from scholars and writers who have wanted to find in the memory of al-­Andalus a symbol of intercultural tolerance and a roadmap for peaceful relations between Eu­rope and the Muslim world. In my account, the modern memory of al-­Andalus is inseparable from the legacy of colonialism, and it entangles in its confusing web a surprising cast of characters, including Spanish fascists and Moroccan nationalists. ­There are some impor­tant caveats to my argument. First, I am not contesting the well-­documented fact that tens of thousands of Andalusis migrated from the Iberian Peninsula to Morocco from the end of the fifteenth c­ entury to the beginning of the seventeenth ­century, and that the Andalusi migration had a profound impact on social and cultural life in Morocco.31 It is also impor­tant to acknowledge that ­there ­were previous articulations of a distinct Andalusi identity before the period of Spanish colonialism in Morocco. Both Alexander Elinson and ­Camilo Gómez-­R ivas have persuasively argued that a distinct idea of Andalusi-­ ness came into focus in the thirteenth and ­fourteenth centuries, when Andalusi writers, such as al-­Shaqundi (d. 1231 / 2) and Ibn al-­K hatib (d. 1375), w ­ ere pushed into North African exile on account of the po­liti­cal turmoil on the Iberian Peninsula and the rapid advance of the Christian Reconquest of al-­Andalus.32 While in exile, both al-­Shaqundi and Ibn al-­Khatib penned influential works in praise of al-­Andalus, emphasizing their homeland’s cultural superiority over the Maghrib. Thus, the Maghrib originally served as a foil against which elite Andalusi writers defined their superiority. The assertion of Andalusi supremacy often had ethnic overtones. The writings of al-­Shaqundi and Ibn al-­K hatib exalt Arab culture in al-­Andalus while downplaying the contributions of Berbers, the indigenous ­peoples of North Africa. The anti-­Berber sentiment in medieval Andalusi literary culture continues to have ramifications in con­temporary Morocco, where cele­brations of al-­Andalus\n\nI ntroduction\n\n11\n\nare sometimes seen as a way of marking distance from an indigenous Berber culture and identity.33 In other words, Spanish colonialism did not invent al-­Andalus, nor did it offer the first articulation of Andalusi identity in North Africa. What it did was inaugurate a certain set of ideas about how Morocco became Andalusi and how Morocco’s Andalusi culture manifests in the modern period. A power­ful synthesis of ­these ideas appears in the work of Rodolfo Gil Benumeya (1901–1975), an influential theoretician of Spanish colonialism u ­ nder Franco: In 1492 and in 1610, the majority of Muslims from Andalucía and Murcia went to Morocco. T ­ here, they founded neighborhoods and cities, where they faithfully preserved and ­reproduced all of the customs of their land of origin. Fez, Tetouan, and Rabat are the three ­g reat Andalusian capitals. . . . ​ They gave a Hispano-­Muslim organ­ization to the Moroccan state and government, and, to Moroccan Islam, they gave a local air that does not exist in the countries of the East b ­ ecause it originates on the shores of the Guadalquivir. Thanks to Fez, Tetouan, and Rabat, Morocco eventually became a living ­ iddle Ages remains museum, where the Andalucía of the M intact.34\n\nGil Benumeya’s passage, written in 1942, crystallizes the main components of a historical narrative that ­will appear, in dif­fer­ent forms and in dif­fer­ent languages, throughout this book: from 1492 on, Andalusi Muslims left the Iberian Peninsula and immigrated to Morocco, where they rebuilt their civilization, especially in Fez, Tetouan, and Rabat. Morocco’s Andalusi cities serve ­today as a “living museum,” where Moroccans have preserved Andalusi culture. Gil Benumeya goes on to cata­log a series of cultural practices that, he claims, have descended from al-­Andalus to modern Morocco, including ­music, architecture, crafts, clothing, dialect, and religion.35 Today, scholarly and popu­ ­ lar Moroccan repre­ sen­ ta­ tions of al-­ Andalus bear a striking resemblance to Gil Benumeya’s text, or to other Spanish colonial texts from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. For example, in\n\n12\n\nI ntroduction\n\na 1992 lecture, Muhammad Binsharifa, the director of the Moroccan National Library, said: To this day, we still see in Morocco the manifestations of the continuity that existed between Morocco and al-­Andalus, despite the passage of many centuries since the end of al-­Andalus. . . . ​ The heritage of al-­Andalus is still preserved and uninterrupted in Morocco, as exemplified by the families of Andalusi origin in many cities and villages. We see it in architecture, ­music, cuisine, and other refinements of civilization.36\n\nMore recently, in a 2013 book about Tetouan, the historian Muhammad al-­Sharif wrote that Tetouan “still preserves Andalusi architecture inside its walls, and Tetouan’s residents still preserve the dialect, m ­ usic, fashion, and the traditional crafts of al-­Andalus. [Tetouan] truly resembles, to a ­great extent, Granada with its narrow streets and the manner of its buildings.”37 Like the shared mausoleum of al-­Manzari and ­a l-­Turris, Binsharifa and al-­Sharif emphasize the uninterrupted transmission of Andalusi identity from fifteenth-­century Iberia to con­ temporary Morocco. Their remarks point to medieval roots, but they reproduce ideas that first emerged u ­ nder the auspices of Spanish colonialism, as I hope to show over the following chapters. The key difference in the con­temporary Moroccan iteration of this narrative of Moroccan history is that Spanish colonialism has been expunged from it. Spanish colonial writers i­magined themselves as the saviors of Morocco’s Andalusi heritage. In 1939, Tomás García Figueras, a leading Francoist in Morocco, wrote: “Millions of Muslims scattered around the ­whole world . . . ​follow with enthusiastic attention the spiritual and h ­ uman work that is the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, and through it, they witness the re­nais­sance of that splendid cultural coexistence [convivencia] of both p ­ eoples in al-­Andalus.”38 For García Figueras, Spanish colonialism marked the re­nais­sance of al-­Andalus in Morocco. Indeed, re­nais­sance was a central trope of Francoist writings about Morocco. In con­temporary Moroccan culture, the trope of re­ nais­sance has been replaced by the trope of continuity. Con­temporary Moroccan intellectuals share with Spanish colonial writers a set of ideas\n\nI ntroduction\n\n13\n\nabout how Andalusi culture was transmitted to Morocco and what Morocco’s Andalusi culture looks like. ­Today, though, t­hese ideas have shed any association with colonial ideology. A narrative that was forged in the ser­vice of colonialism has taken on a life of its own as a centerpiece of Moroccan national identity.\n\nColonial al-­Andalus in Modern Spanish and Moroccan Studies This story is a cautionary tale about colonialism’s capacity to generate the tools of its own destruction. But it is not just that. It also confounds the dominant understanding of modern Spanish and Moroccan history. The historical scholarship on modern Spain has generally treated the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) as a rupture that separates two irreconcilable views of Spain. On the one hand are the Republicans, who advocate for a pluralistic Spain that is tolerant of regional, linguistic, and cultural difference; on the other hand are the Francoists, who fight for a Catholic, monolingual (Castilian-­speaking), and imperial nation.39 The tendency to cast the Civil War as a complete rupture in Spanish history has obfuscated the unexpected ways in which Republicans and Francoists shared interests and discourses in Morocco. Spanish colonialism made strange bedfellows of liberals and fascists. Spanish colonial writers of all ideological stripes justified Spain’s role as a colonizer in the Muslim world by celebrating the idea of convivencia, the harmonious coexistence of the Abrahamic faiths in al-­Andalus. This par­tic­u­lar view of medieval Iberian history has largely been associated with the Republican cause and, more broadly, with liberal and progressive views of Spanish history.40 In contrast, I argue that Spain’s claim to a tradition of exemplary tolerance, grounded in its Muslim past, underpins diverse ideological proj­ects, including fascism. This study also contributes to an ongoing revision of modern Moroccan history. ­Until recently, the historiography of twentieth-­century Morocco, like Spanish historiography, was structured around a g­ reat rupture: Moroccan in­de­pen­dence from Spanish and French colonial rule in 1956. Early Moroccan nationalist historiography, written during the 1950s and 1960s, tended to depict the colonial period as an aberration\n\n14\n\nI ntroduction\n\nthat temporarily severed the historical unity of the Moroccan nation.41 My book challenges this alleged continuity between precolonial and postcolonial Morocco. It thus joins a growing body of scholarship that aims to show how the colonial experience continues to shape and define po­liti­cal and cultural debates in post-­independence Morocco. Recent scholarship on Morocco has elucidated how Eu­ro­pean colonialism fundamentally altered Moroccan discourses about religion, national and ethnic identity, gender, science, ­music, and the arts. Edmund Burke III, for example, argues that French colonial ethnography in­ven­ted the idea that Morocco has its own distinctive form of Islam, “Moroccan Islam,” and that the discourse on Moroccan Islam has become a source of legitimacy for the Moroccan monarchy in the post-­independence era.42 Burke’s work exemplifies a recent shift in North African studies ­toward analyzing North African national cultures as discursive constructs rather than ontological essences.43 This new trend in North African studies takes inspiration from the scholarship on nationalism— and, in par­tic­u­lar, from Hobsbawm’s insight that national traditions are often “in­ven­ted.” Theorists of nationalism have emphasized the anachronistic nature of nationalist imaginaries, which often legitimize the nation by projecting it back onto a distant and venerated past.44 What is unique about my study is that it analyzes the simultaneous use of the same mythic past, al-­A ndalus, by two ideological proj­ects that ­were deeply in conflict with each other: Spanish colonialism and Moroccan nationalism. The other major contribution that this book makes to Moroccan and North African studies is that it reinserts Spanish colonialism into Moroccan colonial history. Between 1912 and 1956, Morocco was divided into a French Protectorate and a Spanish Protectorate. The French Protectorate, whose capital was Rabat, occupied central Morocco, including the historic cities of Fez and Marrakesh.45 The Spanish Protectorate was divided into a northern and a southern zone (Figures 4 and 5). The northern zone of the Spanish Protectorate, whose capital was Tetouan, covered Morocco’s Mediterranean coast (except for Tangier, which was an international zone) and the northern part of Morocco’s Atlantic coast.46 The southern zone of the Spanish Protectorate included the city of Sidi Ifni, which was ceded to Spain in 1860, and vast swaths of the\n\nFigure 4. “Mapa del Protectorado Español en Marruecos,” España Comisión Geográfica de Marruecos, Sección de Límites.

The sultan, while based in the French zone, remained the figurehead of the Moroccan state in all of the territories that came ­under French and Spanish rule. His representative in the Spanish zone was the caliph, who also came from the ruling ʿAlawi dynasty. Although the sultan and the caliph w ­ ere formally recognized as the highest Moroccan authorities in the French and Spanish zones respectively, their powers ­were undermined by the Eu­ro­pean colonial governments that grew up around them. The French and Spanish Protectorates officially ended in 1956 with the declaration of Moroccan in­de­pen­dence. Spain, however, did not withdraw from its Saharan territories ­until 1976, and it continues to occupy the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla on Morocco’s Mediterranean coast. Indeed, Ceuta and Melilla have become flashpoints in Eu­rope’s ongoing migration crisis, since they serve as the po­liti­cal boundary between Africa and the Eu­ro­pean Union and as major points of entry for undocumented mi­grants from North and West Africa.48 Up u ­ ntil now, Moroccan colonial history has largely been narrated from the perspective of French colonialism and the vari­ous reactions it elicited among Moroccans living in the French zone. Spanish colonialism in Morocco, when it is considered at all, is often treated as a sideshow to French colonialism; by extension, Moroccan nationalist culture ­u nder Spanish colonial rule is seen as an appendix to the nationalist movement that developed in the French zone. A number of historical ­factors have conspired to relegate Spanish colonialism to the margins of Moroccan colonial history. Since in­de­pen­dence, Moroccan po­liti­cal power and state research institutions have concentrated in the capital city of Rabat, which was also the capital of the French Protectorate.49 French has remained one of the major languages of higher education, commerce, and diplomacy in Morocco, despite the emphasis that Moroccan nationalists put on the need to Arabize the entire Moroccan educational system.50 As a result of t­hese historical and institutional pro­cesses, the scholarship on colonial Morocco has been biased ­toward French and Arabic sources that emphasize the histories of the major cities from the former French zone, including Rabat and Fez.\n\n18\n\nI ntroduction\n\nThe historical formation of academic disciplines in Eu­rope and the United States has also played an impor­tant role in marginalizing the history of Spanish colonialism in Morocco. In the Anglo-­American acad­emy, Morocco and the Maghrib have largely been studied and taught u ­ nder the rubric of Francophone studies, whereas the field of modern Arabic studies in the Anglo-­American acad­emy has focused on Egypt and, to a lesser extent, the Levant.51 In Spain, ­there is a rich tradition of scholarship on Hispano-­Arab cultural relations, but this scholarship has focused, almost exclusively, on the medieval period. Over the past two de­cades, scholars in Spain and the United States have shown a renewed interest in Spanish colonialism in Morocco.52 Yet, none of the existing studies analyzes the extensive corpus of Moroccan writings about Spanish colonialism or examines the impact of Spanish colonialism on modern Moroccan culture. Therefore, the cultural history of Spanish colonial Morocco, as represented by Arabic and Spanish sources, has existed in an academic no-­man’s-­land, in the interstices ­between disciplinary and colonial legacies. This book does not attempt to provide a comprehensive history of Spanish colonialism in Morocco. Instead, it seeks to trace the genealogy of Morocco’s Andalusi identity by examining Spanish and Moroccan repre­sen­ta­tions of al-­Andalus from the beginning of the colonial period in 1859 ­until the period of Moroccan in­de­pen­dence in 1956.53 In pursuit of this story, I ­will draw upon a diverse array of sources in Spanish, Arabic, French, and Catalan, spanning several genres and media. The sources that I examine in this book have ­either been ignored or studied in isolation, without consideration for how they reverberate across national, cultural, and linguistic lines. Reinserting Spanish colonialism into the history of modern Morocco is not just a m ­ atter of getting a more complete and accurate account of Eu­ro­pean colonialism in Morocco. Rather, I contend that both Eu­ro­pean colonialism and Moroccan responses to it take on new meanings when they are seen in this comparative and multilingual perspective. Colonial al-­Andalus offers new transnational frameworks for examining Moroccan colonial history. Rather than locating Spanish colonialism on the periphery of French colonialism, this study sketches an alternative map, one that crisscrosses the Mediterranean and links\n\nI ntroduction\n\n19\n\nSpanish colonial Morocco to movements of p ­ eoples and ideas between Morocco, Madrid, Seville, Geneva, Mecca, Lebanon, and Egypt. This book therefore responds to the recent call, in postcolonial studies, to move beyond the colonizer-­colonized binary and t­ oward frameworks that emphasize lateral connections between colonized subjects and spaces.54 Along ­these lines, Olivia C. Harrison has called “for a repositioning of the field of Maghrebi studies along an East-­West, rather than North-­ South, axis.”55 Extending Harrison’s proposal one step further, my analy­sis of Spanish colonialism in Morocco deploys a circum-­Mediterranean approach, which positions Morocco within transnational flows that encompass Eu­rope, North Africa, and the ­Middle East.\n\nColonial al-­Andalus in Mediterranean Perspective Colonial al-­Andalus departs from the existing scholarship on Eu­ro­pean colonialism in the Arab-­Islamic world, which has largely taken for granted a ­whole set of binary oppositions: Islam and the West, colonizer and colonized, as well as colonialism and nationalism. This study exposes the limits of t­ hese simplistic oppositions by examining Spanish and Moroccan discourses built on the multidirectional use of a shared past. It illustrates the unexpected ways in which colonial discourses migrate across geographic and cultural lines, taking on new ideological contours along the way. My comparative and multilingual approach brings into relief the surprising intersections between Spanish colonial culture and Moroccan nationalist culture. I believe that this story has broad implications for postcolonial studies and for the study of Mediterranean cultural history ­because it challenges our understanding of the conceptual borders between Eu­rope and Islam, and between colonialism and anticolonial re­sis­tance. Edward Said’s classic Orientalism (1978) has long served as the dominant paradigm for analyzing Eu­ro­pean colonialism in the Arab and Muslim worlds. Said’s brilliant study demonstrates how Western repre­ sen­ta­tions of “the Orient” helped to consolidate Eu­rope’s colonial power in Arab and Muslim countries. Said offers three interrelated definitions of the key term “Orientalism.” First, Orientalism is an academic discipline that emerged in the nineteenth ­century as a space for studying the\n\n20\n\nI ntroduction\n\nlanguages and cultures of the Orient.56 Second, Orientalism is a “style of thought based upon an ontological and epistemological distinction made between ‘the Orient’ and (most of the time) ‘the Occident.’ ”57 That is, Orientalism is a style of Western thought based upon the total alterity of the Orient (whence the ontological distinction) and the total superiority of Western modes of knowing (whence the epistemological distinction). Building on the previous two definitions of Orientalism, Said posits his third and most historically specific definition of the term: Taking the late eigh­teenth c­ entury as a very roughly defined starting point Orientalism can be discussed and analyzed as the corporate institution for dealing with the Orient—­dealing with it by making statements about it, authorizing views of it, describing it, by teaching it, settling it, ruling over it: in short, Orientalism as a Western style for dominating, restructuring, and having authority over the Orient.58\n\nThis final definition, which is the motor b ­ ehind Said’s book, takes inspiration from Foucault’s idea that power is not only repressive but also “productive,” in the sense that it often produces the very categories that it seeks to regulate.59 Building on this idea, Said argues that the academic discipline of Orientalism produced the category of “the Orient,” which it then sought to dominate by regulating the bound­aries of what could be known or said about the Orient. For Said, Orientalism is not only a power­ful discursive tool that the West used to exercise its mastery over other parts of the world; it is also the image against which the West defines itself. Orientalism is, in Said’s words, “premised upon exteriority.” 60 It defines a strategic location that is always outside the West, and that the West has used to calibrate its identity—an identity that is defined as distant from and superior to the Orient. My book revises Said’s account by showing how Islamic history ­shaped Eu­ro­pean colonialism, and how Eu­ro­pean colonialism s­ haped national identity in a postcolonial Muslim context. In so ­doing, this book addresses two shortcomings that scholars have noted in Said’s work. First, scholars have criticized Said for basing his argument on a monolithic view of the “West” and the “East.” 61 Second, they have criti-\n\nI ntroduction\n\n21\n\ncized Said for his failure to examine Orientalism’s relationship to its inverse image: non-­Western repre­sen­ta­tions of the West (what some have called “Occidentalism”).62 As scholars have pushed the study of Eu­ro­pean colonialism in the Arab-­Islamic world beyond the geographic contexts studied by Said, they have noticed significant wrinkles and variations in Eu­ro­pean discourses about Arabs and Muslims. Although Said speaks broadly of “Orient” and “Occident,” he actually paints on a much smaller geographic canvas: for Said, the “West” means France and Britain, and the “Orient” means Egypt and the Levant.63 One of the nineteenth-­century figures who exemplifies Said’s notion of Orientalism is the French Orientalist Ernest Renan. In a lecture delivered at the Collège de France in 1862, Renan famously asserted that “Islam is the most complete negation of Eu­rope.” 64 This virulent prejudice against Islam might, as Said argues, have been one of the defining features of French Orientalist scholarship. Nevertheless, as Karla Mallette has shown, southern Eu­ro­pean Orientalists did not share Renan’s belief that ­there is an irreconcilable difference between Islam and Eu­rope.65 Mallette surveys the evolution of Orientalist philology in Italy, Spain, and Malta, which w ­ ere all ruled by Muslims in the ­Middle Ages. In t­hese southern Eu­ro­pean contexts, Orientalists often celebrated the Arab and Muslim contributions to modern Eu­ro­pean culture and emphasized the cultural unity of the Mediterranean world. This tradition of southern Orientalism is not, to borrow Said’s phrase, “premised upon exteriority.” Instead, it locates the Orient within Eu­rope, emphasizing the connectivity between the two. In both Spain and Morocco, the memory of al-­Andalus throws into question any neat distinction between East and West. Spain, which is conspicuously absent from Said’s Orientalism, has often stood as Eu­rope’s internal other. In Eu­ro­pean culture, especially from France and E ­ ngland, Spain has been i­ magined as a fuzzy border between East and West and between Eu­rope and Africa, a place where cultural and racial distinctions become murky. This idea is summed up in the nineteenth-­century French quip that “Africa begins in the Pyrenees.” 66 The adage points to Spain’s liminal position on the fringes of Eu­rope, but also to the country’s deep historical and cultural connections to North Africa. In the eyes of many Eu­ro­pe­ans, eight centuries of Muslim rule in Iberia made\n\n22\n\nI ntroduction\n\nSpain exotic, dif­fer­ent, and potentially suspect. Starting in the nineteenth c­ entury, Spaniards took advantage of this accusation of otherness and used it to justify their colonial aspirations in North Africa. By highlighting Spain’s Muslim past, Spanish writers claimed a cultural and even biological affinity with their neighbors to the south. Thus, Spanish colonial thinkers turned a supposed weakness into a strength by making the legacy of al-­Andalus the main justification for Spain’s expansion into North Africa and the Muslim world. The colonial myth of al-­ Andalus was, in turn, taken up by Moroccans and used to craft a national identity, one that emphasized Morocco’s place at the crossroads of Eu­ rope and the Muslim world. Thus, the idea of al-­Andalus has served to approximate Spaniards to Africa while distancing Moroccans from it. In one of the best studies to date on Spanish colonialism in Africa, Susan Martin-­Márquez has coined the term “disorientation” to describe how Spanish colonial writers both produce Orientalist discourse and, si­mul­ta­neously, make themselves the object of it by reveling in their nation’s Muslim past.67 Spain’s “disorienting” position on both sides of Orientalism profoundly altered the nature of Spanish colonial discourse. The dominant trope of Spanish colonialism in Morocco was “brotherhood,” a discourse that emphasized the geographic, cultural, and racial proximity between Spaniards and Moroccans.68 In contrast, the dominant trope of French colonialism in Africa was the “civilizing mission,” a discourse premised on the total superiority of the colonizer and the total alterity of the colonized.69 As the French notion of a “civilizing mission” illustrates, Eu­ro­pean colonial power was often predicated on the idea that colonized ­peoples ­were inferior and radically dif­fer­ent.70 Yet Spanish colonialism confounds this idea, since its justification was similarity, not difference. To be clear, I am not suggesting that Spanish colonialism, with its rhetorical emphasis on “brotherhood,” was a more benevolent form of colonialism than the French variety. Instead, I want to highlight the diverse rhetorical strategies that dif­fer­ent Eu­ro­pean nations used to justify their colonial proj­ects, and then to trace, through the Moroccan example, some of the long-­term consequences of ­t hose rhetorical strategies. By replacing the binary opposition between Eu­rope and Islam with a focus on cultural connections across and around the Mediterranean,\n\nI ntroduction\n\n23\n\nColonial al-­Andalus also engages recent developments in the field of Mediterranean studies.71 In this reemerging field, the Mediterranean serves as the conceptual antagonist to the nation. The buzzwords in the field of Mediterranean studies are “bridges” and “connectivities.”72 Scholars have a­ dopted the Mediterranean paradigm as a way of transcending the constraints of nationalist thinking and also as a way of undermining binaries that have long plagued the study of the region, such as the binary of “Islam and the West.” Indeed, the “Mediterranean” has become a shorthand for a defense of interfaith and cross-­cultural tolerance in the face of nationalism, xenophobia, and religious extremism. In this light, the Spanish discourse of convivencia can be seen as one instance of a larger constellation of discourses that circulate in (and about) the Mediterranean. The race to Mediterraneanism is not limited to the academic sphere, but rather has poured out into po­liti­cal and civic life. In 2008, forty-­t hree heads of state from the Mediterranean region came together to create the Union for the Mediterranean, whose goals, in the words of its website, are “the creation of an area of peace, stability, security and shared economic prosperity” and also the “promotion of understanding between cultures and civilizations in the Euro-­Mediterranean region.”73 Mediterranean proj­ects, be they academic or intergovernmental, tend to emphasize flows over borders, connections over exceptions, and affiliations over separations. This book has a vexed relationship with the field of Mediterranean studies. It shares the field’s emphasis on transnational analy­sis but complicates the ideological valence of that emphasis. Discourses of exemplary tolerance, be they Andalusi or Mediterranean, can be put to the ser­v ice of proj­ects that are anything but tolerant, such as fascism. I therefore want to open up the study of colonial Moroccan history to transnational flows of p ­ eoples and ideas that crisscross the Mediterranean, without investing ­those flows, a priori, with a positive valence. The other major shortcoming of the Mediterranean paradigm for this proj­ect is that Moroccan writers, during the colonial period, did not talk about themselves as “Mediterraneans.” That is, they did not identify themselves vis-­à-­vis the Mediterranean as a cultural or geographic category.74 Even Spanish writers of the colonial period did not emphasize the Mediterranean (as geography or identity), preferring instead to emphasize the\n\n24\n\nI ntroduction\n\nStrait of Gibraltar as the narrow “river” that connects the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa.75 To be sure, being in and of the Mediterranean has become a significant part of how con­temporary Spain and Morocco pres­ent themselves to the world.76 Nevertheless, I would venture that Spain and Morocco both “became Mediterranean” a­ fter the colonial period. Indeed, it often seems that the Mediterranean is an asymmetrical category, foisted by some “Mediterranean” (often Eu­ro­pean) cultures on ­others. In recent years, Moroccan politicians and writers have willingly ­adopted the Mediterranean label, perhaps b ­ ecause it allows them to signal Morocco’s proximity to Eu­rope. This move is paradoxical, since the Mediterranean has also served, in the not too distant past, to mark a cultural divide between “advanced” northern Eu­rope and “backward” southern Eu­rope.77 ­Today, though, the symbolism of the Mediterranean has evolved. The M ­ iddle Sea now evokes fluidity, connectivity, and a commitment to unity across difference. Thus, “being Mediterranean” allows some Eu­ro­pean countries, such as Spain, to claim a culture of tolerance and openness to Eu­rope’s neighbors to the south, while it allows other non-­European countries, such as Morocco and Turkey, to signal their proximity to a multicultural Europe—­and, potentially, their distance from other Muslims. I insist, however, that this web of meaning was not fully in place during the period that is the object of this study. The characters in this book move across the space of the Mediterranean, but they do not engage the Mediterranean as a key symbol of identity or as a unit of analy­sis. Instead, it is al-­Andalus that informs the colonial encounter between Spain and Morocco and the way that Spanish and Moroccan writers imagine their place in the world. Like the Mediterranean, al-­Andalus is a malleable site of meaning, one that shifts and adapts to dif­fer­ent cultural and po­liti­cal needs. My goal, in this book, ­will be to trace ­those shifts and to show how a certain set of ideas about al-­Andalus served to justify Spain’s colonization of Morocco and then, surprisingly, to define the Moroccan national culture that supplanted colonial rule. For the writers and politicians at the heart of this study, al-­Andalus functions as both history and poetry. That is, al-­Andalus is both a specific time and place and also an idea that\n\nI ntroduction\n\n25\n\ntranscends time and place.78 Al-­Andalus expands and contracts. It is a living pres­ent grounded in a lost past. It resides in the Iberian Peninsula, in North Africa, and in the space in between. It is a specific chapter in medieval Mediterranean history, and it is a universal heritage that bridges seemingly irreconcilable divisions between East and West. If this book is a study of how Morocco became Andalusi, then it is also a study of how al-­ Andalus came to signify many ­things to many ­people. I intend to historicize Morocco’s modern claim to an Andalusi identity, but in order to do so, I need to show how al-­Andalus broke ­free from its original referential meaning and morphed into an idea that floats in between Muslims and Christians, North Africans and Eu­ro­pe­ans, and past and pres­ent.\n\nOverview The book is or­ga­nized chronologically, tracing Spanish and Moroccan repre­sen­ta­tions of al-­Andalus through the vicissitudes of the colonial period (1859–1956). In each chapter, I isolate a figure, text, or concept that allows me to reconstruct a key moment in the Spanish and Moroccan negotiation of the cultural memory of al-­Andalus. The chapters thus operate on two parallel levels: close textual analy­sis and broad cultural framing. Chapter 1 explores the rhetorical uses of al-­Andalus in Spanish writings from the period around the Spanish-­Moroccan War of 1859–1860. It shows how Spanish writers mobilized the memory of Spain’s Muslim past in order to assert a historical and natu­ral connection between Spain and Morocco. I draw on a diverse array of literary, journalistic, and visual sources, but I focus on Pedro Antonio de Alarcón’s Diary of a Witness of the War of Africa (1860), the most famous Spanish account of the war. I track two of the main motifs in Alarcón’s Diary: first, the idea that modern Tetouan is a continuation of Muslim Granada; and second, the idea that the Spanish-­Moroccan War is a continuation of the Christian Reconquest of Granada in 1492. Alarcón’s Diary anticipates the historical and genealogical imaginaries that ­w ill animate Spanish colonial discourse for the next ­century. Chapter 2 explores the place of al-­Andalus in modern Moroccan literary history. At the center of this chapter is the Moroccan poet, scholar,\n\n26\n\nI ntroduction\n\nand visual artist Mufaddal Afaylal (1824–1887). Afaylal produced two contradictory texts about the Spanish-­Moroccan War: a famous elegy and a heretofore unstudied manuscript chronicle. For the elegy, Afaylal ­adopted an Andalusi literary genre, the city elegy, in order to emphasize the parallel between the Spanish occupation of Tetouan in 1860 and the Christian Reconquest of al-­Andalus. In the chronicle, Afaylal avoids comparison to al-­Andalus and instead mounts a vicious critique of the Moroccan army. The elegy illustrates the appeal of al-­Andalus as a discursive model for making sense of the colonial encounter; the chronicle signals the limits of what al-­Andalus can say in (and about) nineteenth-­ century Morocco. My reading of Afaylal thus highlights the tension between poetry and history, the universal and the par­tic­u­lar. Chapter 3 examines the elision of three related geohistorical concepts: al-­A ndalus (medieval Muslim Iberia), Andalucía (a region in southern Spain), and Morocco. I trace this elision back to early twentieth-­century Spanish writers, especially Blas Infante (1885–1936), who is hailed t­oday as the ­father of Andalusian nationalism. Infante’s writings celebrated the role of cultural and ethnic diversity in the making of the southern Spanish region of Andalucía. In post-­Franco Spain, Infante’s work has become linked with the myth of convivencia. Yet Infante’s reputation as a champion of intercultural tolerance masks two understudied aspects of his work and its afterlife: his repudiation of Catalan nationalism and his influence on the discourse of Spanish colonialism in Morocco. In this chapter, I analyze Andalusian nationalism’s clash with Catalan nationalism in order to show how Spain’s peripheral identities s­haped and ­were ­shaped by debates about al-­Andalus and colonial Morocco. This chapter also questions the ideological valence of convivencia, a concept often associated with Republican intellectuals like Infante. Although Infante was killed by rebel troops at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, his work nonetheless exerted significant influence over Francoist writings about Morocco. This chapter thus illuminates the surprising overlaps between Republican and Francoist discourses about Morocco and about Spain’s Muslim past. Chapter 4 examines Franco’s sponsorship of the Moroccan hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. Franco’s support for the Moroccan hajj began during the Spanish Civil War and continued intermittently\n\nI ntroduction\n\n27\n\nthrough the 1950s. This chapter centers on an impor­tant but unstudied Arabic account of the first Moroccan hajj sponsored by Franco: Ahmad al-­Rahuni’s Journey to Mecca (1941). The text narrates the pilgrimage to Mecca and also two separate visits to Spain, which bookended the author’s pilgrimage. Al-­Rahuni depicts Franco as a defender of Islam and of the cultural heritage of al-­Andalus. He also blurs the line between Mecca and Spain by casting Spain’s Islamic heritage sites as a meta­ phorical Mecca to which Muslims should make pilgrimage. Journey to Mecca thus highlights the collaboration between Spanish fascism and the Moroccan intellectual elite. It also offers insight into how an educated Moroccan viewed Spanish colonialism and, in par­tic­u ­lar, the Francoist cele­bration of al-­Andalus. Chapters 5 and 6 work together to trace the origins and po­liti­cal uses of the concept of “Hispano-­Arab culture,” which was in­ven­ted by Francoists as a discursive strategy for justifying Spanish colonialism and for distinguishing it from French colonialism. At first, Hispano-­Arab culture was a cultural ideal grounded in the myth of convivencia. Over the course of Francoist rule in Morocco (1936–1956), Hispano-­Arabism evolved from being a cultural ideal to being a specific set of cultural practices that defined Spain and Morocco’s shared Andalusi heritage. This shift can also be thought of as the shift from Cordoba to Granada. In the historical imaginary of Hispano-­Arabism, Cordoba represented the ideal of interfaith tolerance, whereas Granada stood in for the ­music and decorative arts that Andalusi exiles supposedly brought to Morocco. In Chapter 5, I focus on the Cordoba portion of this story—­t hat is, on the Francoist promotion of a Hispano-­Arab cultural ideal that supposedly tied together interfaith life in al-­Andalus and Spanish colonialism in Morocco. The motor b ­ ehind this proj­ect was the General Franco Institute, whose publications codified the concept of Hispano-­ Arab culture. The institute also facilitated cultural exchange between Spain, Morocco, and the Arab world. Arab intellectuals who visited ­Morocco as guests of the General Franco Institute produced Arabic texts that helped to propagate, to a broad Arab readership, the idea that Franco’s aim in Morocco was to resurrect al-­A ndalus. In the second half of the chapter, I analyze the most famous of t­ hese Arabic texts, Amin a­ l-­R ihani’s Morocco (1940).\n\n28\n\nI ntroduction\n\nChapter 6 continues to investigate the Francoist promotion of Morocco’s Andalusi culture, while shifting focus from the Hispano-­Arab cultural ideal to a set of Andalusi cultural practices symbolized by Granada. In par­tic­u­lar, I examine Spanish colonial efforts to define, preserve, and administer two aspects of Moroccan culture that the Spanish associated with Muslim Granada and the Alhambra: crafts and ­music. My analy­sis centers on the ­careers of two Spaniards: Mariano Bertuchi (1884–1955), a Granadan artist who trained a generation of Moroccan artisans and artists; and Patrocinio García Barriuso (1909–1997), who played an impor­tant role in the revival of Andalusi ­music in Morocco. Bertuchi and García Barriuso helped to codify a canon of Andalusi arts, which, ­today, are upheld as essential components of Morocco’s Andalusi identity. Chapter 7 explores the emergence of the “Andalus-­centric” narrative in Moroccan historiography and scholarship at the end of the colonial period and the beginning of the in­de­pen­dence period. The chapter opens with the story of Shakib Arslan’s visit to Tetouan in August of 1930. Arslan, a Lebanese Druze prince, was one of the most famous writers and politicians in the Arab and Muslim worlds, and the author of influential works that pop­u­lar­ized a view of al-­Andalus as a “lost paradise.” Arslan’s visit to Tetouan helped launch the ­careers of several young Moroccan nationalist intellectuals, such as Muhammad Dawud, M’hammad Binnuna, and ʿAbd al-­K haliq al-­Turris. In this chapter, I trace how Moroccan nationalists a­ dopted and eventually overcame Arslan’s ideas about al-­Andalus. This pro­cess unfolded in two waves. In the first wave, Moroccan nationalists, especially Muhammad Dawud, ­adopted Arslan’s idiom of “the lost paradise” and used it to insert their nationalist strug­gle within broader reform movements in the Arab-­ Islamic world. In a second wave of responses to Arslan’s work, Moroccan nationalists, especially t­ hose trained at Spanish colonial academic institutions, asserted that al-­Andalus was not lost, but rather was alive and well in Morocco. They also claimed al-­Andalus as a Moroccan national heritage, rather than a pan-­Arab one. This chapter thus maps out the genealogy of Moroccan nationalist repre­ sen­ ta­ tions of al-­ Andalus, showing how Moroccans adapted ideas taken from Spanish colonial culture, while also engaging cultural and po­liti­cal movements from other parts of the Arab world.\n\nI ntroduction\n\n29\n\nThe epilogue addresses the afterlife of colonial al-­Andalus in con­ temporary Moroccan culture. I approach this topic through brief narrative explorations of spaces in Tangier and Rabat. I dwell, in par­tic­ u­lar, on a monument complex in the capital city of Rabat. In the de­ cades since Moroccan in­de­pen­dence, Rabat’s most famous Andalusi structure, the twelfth-­century Hassan Minaret, has been incorporated into a monument complex celebrating the ruling ʿAlawi dynasty. I use the monument complex as a springboard to discuss how Spanish colonial discourses about al-­Andalus have made their way into many aspects of Moroccan life, including the official discourse of the Moroccan monarchy in the twenty-­first ­century.\n\n1\n\nTETOUAN IS GR ANADA\n\nN n In April of 1861, the Spanish writer Pedro Antonio de Alarcón (1833–1891) posed for a series of portraits in the photography studio of his friend José Martínez Sánchez, located in Madrid’s central Puerta del Sol.1 In one of ­these portraits, Alarcón gazes intently at the viewer from under­neath the tasseled hood of an embroidered djellaba, the tunic traditionally worn by Moroccans (Figure 6).2 On his feet, he wears leather slippers. From his wrist hang the prayer beads used by Moroccan Muslims to count prayers and perform dhikr (invocations of God’s name). The clothes that Alarcón donned for the photo shoot ­were a reminder of the writer’s recent return from northern Morocco, where he was sent by the Spanish newspaper El Museo Universal to cover the Spanish-­ Moroccan War of 1859–1860. Alarcón wrote the most famous Spanish account of the war, the Diary of a Witness of the War of Africa (Diario de un testigo de la guerra de África, hereafter the Diary). The Diary was published serially throughout the war, and then as a book in 1860. It was a huge commercial success in Spain, selling more than fifty thousand copies and launching Alarcón to literary fame.3 On the back of one of Alarcón’s portraits from 1861, ­there is a brief inscription that explains the occasion for his Moroccan drag: “Pedro Antonio de Alarcón (writer and poet) with the costume that he wore to\n\nFigure 6.

The guests, numbering over a thousand, vied with each other to produce the most elegant and surprising costumes. The numerous newspaper accounts of the ball gave top billing to the hostess, the Duchess of Medinaceli, who wore a shimmering mermaid costume designed in Paris. The newspapers La Época and El Contemporáneo also singled out Alarcón, who went to the ball dressed as Mulay al-­ʿAbbas, the general of the defeated Moroccan army in the Spanish-­Moroccan War.5 Two days ­after the ball, on April 3, 1861, La Época published an account of the event written in the form of a fictitious letter from Mulay al-­ʿAbbas to “the poet Chorby,” one of the Moroccans who appear in Alarcón’s Diary.6 The article was presumably penned by Alarcón himself, who frequently published chronicles of Madrid society in La Época.7 The article is written in the breathless and impassioned style of the Diary. Its pseudo-­Moroccan narrator describes the ball as the Prophet Muhammad’s “paradise, populated by the elite of his houris.” 8 He hails the Duchess of Medinaceli as a “­great sultana” and says that her mermaid dress “deserves and requires a longer commentary than all ­those that have been written about the Koran.”9 The apocryphal Mulay al-­ ʿAbbas also alludes to his encounters at the ball with guests who reminded him of Spain’s Muslim past and its recent war with Morocco. “I saw,” he writes, “some of the generals and leaders who defeated me last winter and many descendants of all ­those ­people connected to us during the war of the eight centuries.”10 In the space of one brief sentence, the pseudo-­Moroccan narrator leaps from the nineteenth-­century Spanish-­Moroccan War to the medieval strug­gle between Christians and Muslims for control of the Iberian Peninsula. The participants of one conflict mix and mingle with the descendants of the other on the duchess’s dance floor. ­After the ball, the Duchess of Medinaceli put out a call, through the Madrid newspapers, asking her guests to have their portraits taken in the costumes they wore to the party. She intended to gather all of the portraits together in an a­ lbum commemorating the ball.11 Her request\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\n33\n\nwas prob­ably the catalyst for Alarcón’s photo session in Martínez Sánchez’s studio. It is not clear ­whether Alarcón’s portraits ever made it back to the duchess for her a­ lbum. ­Today, though, they belong to the Spanish National Library, where they appear in an ­a lbum containing a motley collection of portraits, whose subjects range from the Duke of Medinaceli, dressed in a seventeenth-­century costume, to circus performers and zarzuela chorus girls (Figure 7). The placement of Alarcón’s Moroccan portraits within a gallery of circus performers and masquerading aristocrats underlines their performative nature. Alarcón’s portraits suggest that cultural identity is like a costume that can be put on or taken off at one’s ­will, and that becoming Moroccan is as ­simple as slipping on a djellaba and a pair of leather sandals. Throughout his ­career, Alarcón made much of his personal connection to Spain’s Muslim past. He was born in the city of Guadix, which was one of the last bastions of the Muslim kingdom of Granada and ­later became a focal point for the crypto-­Muslim (Morisco) re­sis­tance against Christian rule in the Alpujarras Rebellion of 1568–1570.12 From his early Orientalist writings to the end of his life, Alarcón brandished Granada’s Muslim heritage as a sign of identity and a badge of honor. In one of the most oft repeated anecdotes from his life, Alarcón ran into the writer Emilia Pardo Bazán in the manuscripts room of the Spanish National Library in May of 1887. According to Pardo Bazán’s account of the meeting, she expressed concern for Alarcón’s health a­ fter noting his obesity, yellowish complexion, and laborious breathing. Alarcón stoically replied: “You know well that I’m a Moor . . . ​and, therefore, fatalist. Allah is ­great, and He ­will do with me what­ever he wishes.”13 The term “Moor,” which Alarcón uses to describe himself, is one of the most vexed terms in the cultural repre­sen­ta­t ion of Spanish-­Moroccan relations. In modern usage, the term can refer to many distinct categories, including Muslims (a religious category), Arabs or Berbers (ethnic categories), inhabitants of al-­Andalus (a historical designation), and the ­people of North Africa or Morocco (regional or national categories). Like the term “Oriental,” the word “Moor” tells us more about the person who uses it than it does about the ­thing it supposedly describes. It is thus best understood as a category of the Spanish imagination, rather than as a descriptor of p ­ eoples or cultures. The semantic\n\npage 41.\n\nLibrary, 17/LF/51,\n\nSpanish National\n\nCastellano: Tomo 6,\n\nPintor Manuel\n\nRecogidas por el\n\nFigure 7. Reproduction of a page from an archival photography album. Fotografías\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\n35\n\nslippage built into the term “Moor” mirrors the shifts in time and place that characterize Alarcón’s self-­fashioning in his literary oeuvre—­and especially in his Diary. Alarcón was hardly the first Eu­ro­pean to try to play the part of an “Oriental.” The British Orientalist Sir Richard Burton famously ­adopted a Muslim alter ego, Abdullah, in order to make the pilgrimage to Mecca in disguise in 1853.14 Moreover, portraits of Eu­ro­pean subjects in exotic attire ­were an impor­tant subgenre of Eu­ro­pean Orientalist photo­ graphy.15 Nevertheless, Alarcón’s repeated per­for­mances and poses as a “Moor” point to the unique place of the Orient in the Spanish imagination and in Spanish colonial discourse. Susan Martin-­Márquez has coined the term “disorientation” to describe Spanish writers’ ambiguous position inside and outside of Orientalist discourse.16 Alarcón, like many of his Spanish contemporaries, both produces Orientalist tropes and also strategically makes himself the object of them. Martin-­ Márquez notes Alarcón’s fascination with al-­Andalus, but she argues that the Spanish writer maintains a clear distinction between Spain’s Muslim past and its Eu­ro­pean and Catholic pres­ent.17 In contrast, I do not see, in Alarcón’s work, such a clear distinction between past and pres­ent, and between North Africa and Eu­rope. Instead, I believe that Alarcón foreshadows a key trope in twentieth-­century Spanish colonial discourse: the idea that Spain is “neither Orient, nor Occident,” but is, instead, a point of ­union and exchange between Eu­rope and the Arab-­ Islamic world.18 Alarcón strategically ties his identity to Granada and, thus, to Spain’s ambiguous cultural location between East and West. In what follows, I ­w ill explore the rhetorical uses of al-­Andalus in Spanish writings from the period around the Spanish-­Moroccan War of 1859–1860. I w ­ ill track how Spanish writers such as Alarcón mobilized the memory of Spain’s Muslim past in order to assert a historical and genealogical connection between Spain and Morocco. This strategic use of the memory of al-­Andalus served to naturalize Spain’s colonial claims on Morocco. Its implicit logic was that Spain was not colonizing Morocco, but rather was returning to Morocco, which had always been part of Spain. To illustrate this idea, I w ­ ill draw on a diverse array of literary and journalistic sources, but I w ­ ill focus on Alarcón’s Diary, the most famous account of the war that marked the beginning of Spanish\n\n36\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\ncolonialism in Morocco. I ­w ill track, in par­tic­u ­lar, two of the main motifs in Alarcón’s Diary: first, the idea that modern Tetouan is a continuation of Muslim Granada; and second, the idea that the Spanish-­ Moroccan War is a continuation of the Christian Reconquest of Granada in 1492. Both of ­these ideas would exert significant influence over ­later Spanish colonial repre­sen­ta­tions of Morocco. They would also resonate, in surprising ways, in twentieth-­century Moroccan responses to Spanish colonialism. The main objective for this chapter ­will, thus, be to trace the origins of colonial al-­Andalus; that is, to show how the revival of interest in al-­ Andalus in nineteenth-­century Spain became a rhetorical tool for justifying Spain’s colonial presence in North Africa. Alarcón was a pioneer in this discursive proj­ect. His Diary anticipates the genealogical, geo­ graph­i­cal, and racial meta­phors that would become central to Spanish colonial discourse in the twentieth c­ entury. Alarcón also contributed to the formation of a new historical narrative about the transmission of Andalusi culture from medieval Granada to modern Tetouan. In par­ tic­u ­lar, he locates Tetouan’s Andalusi heritage in its architecture and ­music, two arenas of Moroccan culture that would be of special interest to Spanish colonial thinkers in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. This narrative of cultural transmission linking medieval Granada to modern Tetouan would also prove useful to Moroccan nationalists fighting against Spanish colonialism in the m ­ iddle of the twentieth c­ entury. Therefore, Alarcón’s Diary not only illustrates the origins of Spanish colonial discourse but also foreshadows the paradoxical ways in which al-­Andalus would be put to the ser­vice of diverse and contradictory ideological proj­ects in both Spain and Morocco.\n\nOrigin Stories The Spanish-­Moroccan War of 1859–1860 was, in part, a conflict over where Spain ends and Morocco begins. The incident that sparked the war was a dispute over the border separating Ceuta, the Spanish enclave on the Moroccan coast, and the surrounding Moroccan territories.19 Ceuta has been u ­ nder Iberian control since 1415 and has long been a point of contention between Spain and Morocco.20 On August 10, 1859,\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\n37\n\na group of men from the neighboring Anjara clan tore down a border post that the Spanish had set up beyond the limits of Ceuta. According to the Moroccan historian al-­Nasiri, the Anjara also “defiled” a Spanish flag with excrement.21 The incident led to a diplomatic crisis between Spain and Morocco. The Spanish public, stoked by a warmongering press, called for an armed response to the incident, which became known as “the affront to our pavilion in Ceuta.”22 Amid the public fury, the journalist and novelist Manuel Ibo Alfaro wrote, in a comment that reflected the bellicose spirit of the times: “Our pavilion is stained; this stain can only be washed away with blood.”23 Led by Leopoldo O’Donnell, the president of the Spanish government, Spain declared war on Morocco on October 22, 1859. The ensuing war is known, in Spanish historiography, as the War of Africa; in Moroccan historiography, it is known as the War of Tetouan. The two disparate names give a sense of the competing geographic imaginaries that w ­ ere at play. In nineteenth-­century Spain, “Africa” was a common metonymy for Morocco, Spain’s closest African neighbor. ­There was more at stake, however, in the Spanish name for the war. ­Under the grandiose label “the War of Africa” lurked the conviction that Spain was destined, by geography and history, to lead Eu­rope’s colonial expansion into the neighboring continent. This destiny was a common theme in the Spanish press’s coverage of the war. On October 12, the editors of La Discusión, an impor­tant ­Madrid daily, wrote that the war with Morocco “is, for us, a providential issue b ­ ecause God’s fin­ger has, since the beginning of modern history, signaled to us the path of Africa.”24 The remark implied that Spain had a providential duty to follow in the path of the Christian Reconquest of al-­Andalus and to carry its historical strug­gle against Muslims across the Strait of Gibraltar to Morocco. Other writers asserted that Spain should not limit its ambitions to Morocco. In February of 1860, Gabino Tejado, writing for the newspaper El Pensamiento Español, envisioned a Spanish conquest of the entire African continent: “We signal as the space of our conquests in the African continent all of the area stretching from Ceuta to the Cape of Good Hope, and from the western border of Egypt to the Atlantic. . . . ​Our duty as a race and our interest as a nation call us to conquer in Africa as much as we can, as often as we can.”25\n\n38\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\nTejado’s vision of a vast Spanish empire in Africa never came to fruition. Nevertheless, by calling the conflict “the War of Africa,” Spanish writers invested the military campaign in Morocco with the continental ambitions that electrified Spanish society during the war. On December 12, 1859, Pedro Antonio de Alarcón sailed into Ceuta as a special correspondent for the newspaper El Museo Universal and as a volunteer soldier in the Third Corps of the Army of Africa.26 Alarcón’s employer, El Museo Universal, published a steady stream of articles on Moroccan and “Moorish” themes in the months leading up to the declaration of war and throughout the campaign. The newspaper’s coverage of the war bolstered the idea that Spain had a “natu­ral” place in Morocco, based on the geographic and historical proximity between the two countries. In November of 1859, El Museo Universal published a two-­part series on Moroccan history and geography. The series concluded with a bold declaration about Spain’s geographic destiny: “Spain has fi­nally understood that its border must be the Atlas [Mountains].”27 The statement anticipated one of the key tropes of the geographic imaginary that drove Spanish colonialism. From the ­middle of the nineteenth ­century through the ­middle of the twentieth ­century, numerous Spanish colonial apologists would emphasize that Spain and Morocco form a single geographic unit, bordered by the twin mountain chains of the Pyrenees to the north and the Atlas to the south.28 El Museo Universal’s coverage also helped to frame the War of Africa as a continuation of the Christian Reconquest of al-­Andalus. Several articles published in the fall of 1859 hint at the parallels between the fifteenth-­century conquest of Granada and the nineteenth-­century campaign in Morocco. ­These parallels boil to the surface in a bombastic poem that graced the cover of the December 1 issue. The poem, titled “To Spain: Memories and Hopes,” was written by Manuel Fernández y González, a Granadan author of popu­lar historical fiction on Orientalist themes and a close friend and collaborator of Alarcón.29 The “memories” of the poem’s title are remembrances of Spain’s lost imperial splendor, and the “hopes” are the poet’s call for a revival of Spain’s imperial glory through the war against Morocco. The parallel between the Spanish-­Moroccan War and the Reconquest of al-­Andalus is especially emphatic in the poem’s final stanzas. In them, the speaker ob-\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\n39\n\nserves that the Moroccan adversary is not “an unknown ­enemy,” but rather the same “ferocious p ­ eople” who “fought with you / for centuries and centuries.”30 The speaker then enumerates the most famous b ­ attles of the Christian Reconquest, starting with Covadonga (c. 718) and ending with the Catholic Monarchs’ occupation of Granada: “And your queen Isabel, your beloved queen, / Unmatched in faith and grandeur, / In God’s name donned / on her head, the crown of her Granada. / In God’s name, go against the Moor!”31 ­These verses deftly perform a temporal elision. In the gap between the penultimate line and the last line, the speaker jumps from 1492 to the pres­ent, entreating his compatriots to follow Isabel the Catholic’s example and to “go against the Moor!” The temporal elision is bolstered by the lucky coincidence that Queen Isabel II (r. 1833–1868), whose reign coincided with the Spanish-­Moroccan War, was named a­ fter the queen who had led the Christian Reconquest of Granada. Indeed, the conflation of the two Isabels was a common trope in Spanish writings about the war.32 In another instance of this trope, Antonio Ros de Olano, a Spanish general and Romantic poet, envisions a massive triumphal arch connecting Isabel I to Isabel II, and Granada to Tetouan: “Granada and Tetouan, in which Isabel of Castilla and Isabel of Spain have established their throne through arms, are the majestic pillars of an im­mense triumphal arch. . . . ​Isabel I takes Granada from the Arabs who came from Damascus; Isabel II takes Tetouan from the Arabs who came from Granada.”33 ­These lines come from Ros de Olano’s Legends of Africa (Leyendas de África), which was written during the Moroccan campaign and published by the same editors who published Alarcón’s Diary. Alarcón and Ros de Olano shared more than just editors. Alarcón served u ­ nder Ros de Olano during the Moroccan campaign, and he copied, in the Diary, a chapter from the Legends of Africa, in which Ros de Olano narrates Tetouan’s fifteenth-­century foundation by Muslim exiles from Granada.34 For my purposes, the most significant text that appeared in El Museo Universal during the buildup to the Spanish-­Moroccan War was Alarcón’s short story, “A Conversation in the Alhambra” (“Una conversación en la Alhambra”), published on October 15, 1859.35 In the story, a Moroccan descendant of Muslim Granada returns to the city of his forefathers and\n\n40\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\nvisits the Alhambra, where he reveals his identity to a Spanish narrator. The action takes place in the pres­ent, but Granada’s medieval past sits close beneath the surface. In the story’s opening sentence, the narrator calls Granada “the city of Isabel the Catholic,” and he ­later describes it as “the city of Boabdil,” in reference to the last Muslim ruler of Granada, Abu ʿAbd Allah Muhammad b. ʿAli (“Boabdil” in Eu­ro­pean sources).36 The narrator also calls Granada “the Jerusalem of the West,” thus highlighting its symbolic place between Orient and Occident.37 The story’s plot mirrors its setting, probing the limits between Spain and Morocco, Chris­tian­ity and Islam. At the beginning of the story, the Spanish first-­person narrator travels to Granada for the Corpus Christi cele­bration. Along the way, he shares a stagecoach with an enigmatic stranger, whose features evoke the Orient of Romantic lit­er­a­ture: “His well-­g roomed beard, extremely black, was, by nature, of a Nazarene style. His large and expressive eyes, of a velvety black, reminded me of the pirates described by Lord Byron.”38 When the stagecoach arrives in Granada, the two men part ways before the narrator has a chance to uncover the identity of his mysterious travel companion. The following after­noon, though, they run into each other in the Alhambra. The narrator describes the palace by citing José Zorrilla, another Romantic Orientalist: “That palace, made by fairies, according to Zorrilla, was in the saddest solitude and deepest silence.”39 Alarcón’s frequent literary allusions reveal a prob­lem that is common to this story and to his Diary of the Spanish-­Moroccan War: his repre­sen­ta­tions of Muslims and even of his native Granada are heavi­ly mediated by Romantic literary depictions of the Orient.40 That is, Orientalist tropes structure the way Alarcón sees Granada, Morocco, and Muslims in general. The narrator approaches the stranger in the Patio of the Lions, where they observe signs of construction work. The stranger believes that the Spanish workers are tearing down the Alhambra, but the narrator assures him that the Spanish are restoring, not destroying, the country’s most famous Islamic monument: “They a­ ren’t tearing it down,” I replied. “Rather, t­ hey’re reconstructing it. . . . ​Mr. Contreras, the intelligent artist commissioned by our government to restore this casbah, discovered\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\n41\n\nunder­neath the crass Christian work the pure lineaments of the primitive Arab construction. Now, he is working to remediate the ravages of time and poor taste, reconstructing ­these buildings to the same way that they w ­ ere four centuries ago.” 41\n\nThe narrator’s language evokes the image of the palimpsest: to reconstruct the Alhambra, the Spanish must peel away one “crass” layer of cultural history in order to discover, under­neath it, the “pure lineaments” of the Arab-­Islamic culture that was lost in 1492. The narrator thus casts himself and his countrymen as the defenders and restorers of the cultural legacy of al-­Andalus, which hides under­neath the surface of modern Granada. The conversation about the restoration of the Alhambra inspires the mysterious stranger to reveal his identity: he is the last descendant of the Zegrí clan of Granada. The Zegrís r­ ose to posthumous fame through a late-sixteenth-­century Spanish retelling of the final years of the Muslim kingdom of Granada, Ginés Pérez de Hita’s Historia de los bandos de Zegríes y Abencerrajes (1595).42 Pérez de Hita’s work inaugurated a seminal theme in modern repre­sen­ta­tions of Muslim Granada: the rivalry between the Zegrí and the Abencerraje families, a rivalry that culminated in the (potentially legendary) massacre of the Abencerraje ­family in one of the Alhambra’s rooms, t­ oday known as the “Sala de los Abencerrajes.” The violent fate of the Abencerraje clan kindled the imagination of many Romantic writers and paint­ers, including Chateaubriand.43 Indeed, the plot of Alarcón’s story clearly mirrors Chateaubriand’s classic Les aventures du dernier Abencérage (c. 1826), which recounts the journey of the last surviving member of the Abencerraje clan to Granada, his ancestor’s lost home.44 Despite the clear parallels between the two texts, Alarcón’s story is also presented as an alternative and corrective to Chateaubriand’s novella. “Chateaubriand himself,” the narrator wryly comments, “would have given his Abencerraje in exchange for my Zegrí!” 45 The narrator implies that the French can merely fantasize about Muslim Granada, while he, a Spaniard and a Granadan, can have living contact with its descendants and its culture. ­After the stranger reveals his identity, he leads the narrator to the nearby Hall of Ambassadors, which overlooks the city of Granada.\n\n42\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\n­ ere, the last Zegrí asserts that he and the other exiles from al-­Andalus Th belong to Spain, not North Africa: Yes, I am African, I am Aben-­Adul, the last of the Zegrís! . . . ​I misspeak: I am as Spanish as you are! I am an exiled Granadan! I am of a banished race. It has not even been three centuries since my forefathers . . . ​­were thrown out of the ­houses that they had constructed, from the lands that they had worked. . . . ​“You are African,” you said to them, when they had been living in Spain for seven centuries!46\n\nAben-­Adul insists that North Africans of Andalusi descent are Spanish, not Moroccan. To emphasize this point, he explains that when his ancestors arrived in North Africa, they w ­ ere treated as suspicious outsiders: “We arrived ­there, and the kings of the Atlas and of the desert said: ‘You are Spaniards . . . ​return to the sea!’ ” 47 Aben-­Adul thus depicts the Andalusis as a ­people in perpetual exile, stuck in limbo between the two shores of the Mediterranean. The exchange between Aben-­Adul and the narrator illustrates a broader pro­cess of historical revision that took place in Spain in the nineteenth c­ entury. As Martin-­Márquez has noted, nineteenth-­century Spanish liberals reclaimed Spain’s Muslim past as an integral part of the national story rather than as an aberrational challenge to it.48 In this rethinking of national history, a North African of Andalusi descent, like Aben-­Adul, is not an outsider; rather, he is “as Spanish as” the Granadan narrator. ­Toward the end of the story, Aben-­Adul tells the narrator that he learned about the history of al-­Andalus from “a generous Christian,” who also taught him Spanish and convinced him to convert to Chris­ tian­ity.49 This detail reaffirms Spain’s role as the defender of the Andalusi heritage. Indeed, it suggests that al-­Andalus resides within, not against, Christian Spain. “A Conversation in the Alhambra” ends with another nod to Spain and Morocco’s shared cultural heritage. As the narrator and Aben-­Adul look out over Granada from the Alhambra, the sound of a fandango wafts up from the city streets. The fandango is a popu­lar song and dance form, which, in the nineteenth c­ entury, became closely associated with\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\n43\n\nflamenco.50 Aben-­Adul calls the fandango “the echoes of Africa” and “the caravan’s prayer.”51 Likewise, the narrator associates the fandango with North Africa and with the memory of Granada’s Muslim past, calling the ­music “that Berber song, that mysterious guitar . . . ​that lost memory of the Arabs, that exiles’ grief that we feel, that hope of new fatherlands [patrias] that inspires us.”52 In this final scene of the short story, the fandango is depicted as something both distant and near, mysterious and familiar. It is “the echoes of Africa,” but, at the same time, t­hose echoes point back to earlier songs and earlier memories, whose origin is in Muslim Granada. Woven into this moment of cultural recovery and intercultural recognition is a subtle reminder of Spain’s colonial mission in Morocco. The fandango contains, as the narrator remarks, “the hope of new fatherlands that inspires us.” The ­music reminds Spaniards of their lost Arab-­Islamic past, but it also pushes them ­toward their f­ uture in Morocco. This intermingling of past and pres­ent, of Muslim Granada and modern Morocco, is a central theme in Alarcón’s account of the Spanish-­ Moroccan War. The Diary opens with a prologue that powerfully condenses the historical and genealogical meta­phors underpinning Alarcón’s understanding of Spain’s place in Morocco. The prologue is addressed to Ros de Olano, Alarcón’s general and comrade in letters: It was several years ago, my respected and dear General, when the desire to travel through the empire of Morocco first moved my heart. Born, as I was, in the Sierra Nevada, from whose summits you can just make out the beaches where Moordom [la morisma] sleeps its historical death; the son of a city that preserves the footprints of Arab domination, and that was one of their last trenches in the fifteenth ­century, and was l­ater the epicenter of the Morisco rebellion; breast-­fed with the traditions, chronicles, and legends of that race that, like the w ­ aters of the flood, submerged Spain and then l­ater departed, but left ­behind, in mountains and plains, indelible signs of the cataclysm; having spent my youth in the ruins of mosques and casbahs, and caressed the dreams of my adolescence to the sound of the Moors’ songs, in the light of their poetry, perhaps\n\n44\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\n­ nder the very same roofs that sheltered their last pleasures, it u was natu­ral that, upon abandoning my paternal home and casting through the world a gaze avid for poetic impressions, I felt seduced by the nearness of Africa, and I yearned to cross the Mediterranean in order to touch, so to speak, in that marvelous continent, the living real­ity of the past.53\n\nI have quoted the Diary’s opening paragraph in its entirety ­because it foreshadows many of the text’s central themes. The entire paragraph consists of two sentences, both concerned with origins: the origin of the author’s interest in Morocco, the origin of his life story, and the origins of Spain’s entanglement with Morocco. The first clause of the long second sentence places an individual speaking subject in opposition to a North African collective subject: the first-­person narrator (“Born, as I was . . .”) looks down from the privileged perspective of the Sierra Nevada (the mountains outside Granada) to the beaches of nearby Morocco, where “Moordom sleeps its historical death.”54 The unusual term “Moordom” evokes the Orientalist idea that the ­peoples of the Orient are an indistinguishable and unchanging collective mass, devoid of individual subjectivity. I am reminded, ­here, of Delacroix’s famous painting The Fanatics of Tangier (1837–1838), which depicts a crowd of “fanatical” Muslims as a confusing mass of flailing limbs. In Delacroix’s painting, as in Alarcón’s text, it is difficult to know where one Moroccan ends and another one begins. The ontological collectivity of all Moroccans is not the only motif that Alarcón’s passage shares with other Orientalist texts. By evoking “Moordom’s historical death,” the narrator also draws upon the idea that Western temporality does not apply to the Orient, and that Oriental ­peoples exist outside of historical time.55 In Orientalist writings, as Martin-­Márquez has observed, “Travel through space is also conceived of as travel through time.”56 Alarcón’s text exemplifies this trope of anachronistic time travel: the narrator imagines that the impending journey to Morocco ­will allow him “to touch . . . ​the living real­ity of the past.”57 Alarcón’s language ­here is tactile, desirous, as if he saw travel to Morocco as a form of sexual ­union with the past. Up ­until this point, Alarcón’s prologue might appear to be a textbook case of Orientalism, but Alarcón deploys biological meta­phors that\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\n45\n\ncomplicate his relationship with standard Orientalist discourses. According to Said, Orientalism is a “style of thought based upon an ontological and epistemological distinction made between ‘the Orient’ and (most of the time) ‘the Occident.’ ”58 In contrast with Said’s formulation, Alarcón’s Diary blurs the ontological distinction between Orient and Occident. In the Diary’s opening paragraph, Alarcón casts himself as the son of two related cultural forces: Muslim Granada is figured as his symbolic m ­ other, and Christian Spain is figured as his symbolic f­ ather. ­Family meta­phors are, perhaps, the most common feature of nationalist discourses.59 What is curious about Alarcón’s Diary is that it envisions a national “­family” that is not ethnically or religiously homogeneous; it traces a f­amily tree with roots in Muslim Granada and branches that stretch from Spain to Morocco. In the opening paragraph of the prologue, Alarcón gives short shrift to his “paternal home,” Spain. Instead, he focuses on his return to his symbolic ­mother, al-­Andalus, which he hopes to “touch” in Morocco. Alarcón describes himself as “the son of a city that preserves the footprints of Arab domination, and that was one of their last trenches in the fifteenth ­century, and was l­ ater the epicenter of the Morisco rebellion.” 60 He thus highlights the Muslim heritage of his native Guadix and stresses that the city was not only one of the last territories to fall to the Christian Reconquest but also a major site of re­sis­tance when the Morisco (crypto-­Muslim) communities near Granada ­rose up against Spanish Christian rule in the Alpujarras Rebellion of 1568–1570. Although it is a commonplace to call oneself a “son” of a city, Alarcón accentuates the maternal meta­phor by saying that he was “breastfed [amamantado] with the traditions, chronicles, and legends” of the Arabs who once populated Guadix.61 He also claims that the “indelible signs” of Spain’s Muslim past nourished his youth, spent “in the ruins of mosques and casbahs.” 62 Ruins, often a site for nostalgic reflection in Romantic art and lit­er­a­ture, do not merely function ­here as abstract signs of loss or abandon; they are also the monuments, the material reminders, of a past that is not external to Alarcón but rather is claimed as his own. Alarcón’s prologue not only marks a departure from conventional Orientalist practice; it also signals a shift in Spanish national historiography. In the narrative of Spanish national history that was hegemonic ­until the mid-­nineteenth ­century (and that continued to shape\n\n46\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\nhistoriographic debates in the twentieth ­century), 1492 is defined as a moment of national consolidation: with the Reconquest of Granada, the expulsion of the Jews, and the so-­called “discovery” of the New World, Spain comes into being as a Christian, white, Castilian-­speaking, and expansionist nation.63 This historiographic narrative excised Muslims and Jews from the nation, as if al-­Andalus w ­ ere a parenthesis that had no impact on Spain’s national character. In Alarcón’s Diary, 1492 marks a moment of national disintegration, not consolidation. The prologue offers an alternative narrative of Spanish history, in which the expulsion of the Muslims and the Jews sets in motion a pro­cess of national decline. By traveling to Morocco, Alarcón hopes to remedy this error in Spanish national history: What carried my gaze anew to the nearby al-­Gharb was not the desire to perform a poetic pilgrimage; it was the certainty that ­t here was the trea­sure of grandeur that we, the Spanish, lost nearly three centuries ago, and that we have sought out, in vain, in other places; it was the thought that the empire of the Catholic Monarchs and of Philip II began to decline the day that Philip III expelled from Spain the Moriscos and the Jews, who, we could say, took with them the talisman of our fortune; it was seeing, as clear as the light of day, that Spain must go to Africa to recover that talisman, or (to say it another way) that Spain must understand that the most natu­ral function of its existence is a constant expansion to the South.64\n\nIn this quick summary of Spanish imperial history, Alarcón plays fast and loose with dates and facts: he appears to conflate the expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609–1614, ­under the reign of Philip III, with the expulsion of the Jews in 1492, u ­ nder the Catholic Monarchs. It is clear, though, that Alarcón is less interested in hard historical facts than in large, providential movements of Spanish destiny. De­cades before the so-­called “Disaster” of 1898, in which Spain lost its last colonies in the Amer­i­cas, Alarcón advocates for a re­orientation of Spanish history along a North-­South axis: Spain must expand to the south in order to recover the “talisman” of its fortune. It is curious to\n\nT etouan I s G ranada\n\n47\n\nnote that Alarcón’s revision of Spain’s post-1492 history revolves around the repeated use of the word “talisman,” itself a lexical marker of East-­ West encounters. The word entered the Romance languages from the Arabic ṭilasm (“seal” or “charm”), which, in turn, came from Greek.65 Alarcón advocates for a Spanish nation that, like the word “talisman,” traverses the Mediterranean.
