Soon thereafter, a similar situation would unfold in New York, Paris, and other major urban areas around the world. Images circulated on the Internet of empty plazas and vacant streets across the world. Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter feeds filled with the yearning of urban dwellers for a return to that thing called city life. These events drew attention to the fact that cities are not merely a physical assemblage of buildings. Rather, it is the people that enact the thing we might call the Urban. As French urban theorist Henri Lefebvre argued, space does not merely exist a priori, but rather is produced – as he called it – through the varying ways that people build, use, and imagine it.1 It is this interplay between imagination, human action, and spatial setting that makes cities so dynamic and perpetually in flux. With Lefebvre in mind, this book approaches the production of space by considering its resonance with the production of a theater performance. Upon the stage, the scenography and the actions of the actors imbue one another with meaning to produce the drama; this dynamic, in turn, creates meaning for the spectators, without whom the production is not complete. Likewise, cities are built in response to the shifting interests, desires, dreams, and actions of inhabitants as they traverse and interpret the urban stage – whether they be residents, day shoppers, urban planners, commuters, or tourists. As cities slowly began to reopen in spurts and starts in the months that followed that first state of alarm, both city leaders and residents attempted to chart a new path forward through a future\n\n4\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\ncompromised by pandemic, and in doing so have brought renewed attention to ways in which we use cities. Many of the questions posed by this book have been made all the more pressing by these seemingly perpetual images of empty cities: Where, why, and how is culture created in cities in the early twenty-first century? What is public space? Who defines what can and cannot be done there? While much will be written in the coming months and years on the reshaping of the production and consumption of culture in cities in the wake of the pandemic, this book looks backward toward the first decade of the twenty-first century with the hope of illustrating the “kind of problem a city is,” as urban scholar Jane Jacobs put it.2 More broadly though, I pose questions about the ways that these dynamics between culture and city space also inform our understandings of other geographies, or, as I will refer to it in this book, different geographic scales. How can we understand the interplay of culture at the neighborhood level with the way we imagine a city as a whole or its connection with national territory and identity? As the pandemic reshapes these relationships, this book asks that we take stock of these questions in the decades before shelter-in-place orders. This process may help us to understand both what we have lost, and also what we need to consider if we hope to rebuild cities for human connection and engagement. To explore these broad and (admittedly) abstract questions, I focus on two specific and interrelated locations. The first is Spain’s capital city, Madrid, whose role as the administrative center of the Spanish state has always worked in lockstep with its role as a stage for regal power and a symbol of centralized Spanish (read Castilian) power and identity (as aspirational as that symbolism may be). The second location is one of the city’s most unique and iconic central neighborhoods: Lavapiés. A diverse and multicultural place, this neighborhood is known as much for its immigrant population and its activist okupas (squatters) as it is for its associations with a myth of Madrid’s castizo identity – a term that loosely means authentically Madrilenian.3 While the study of these locations seems to imply distinct geographies – one at the scale of the neighborhood and the other the scale of the metropolis – one of the central objectives of this book is to demonstrate the contingent and overlapping nature of these categories as they have intercalated one another both historically and, more recently, in the context of global competition between cities. I contend that it is in the spectacle of urban space where these tensions are best illustrated.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nBy studying Madrid in its global context, this book builds on recent scholarship that considers Madrid as the site of contestation between two countervailing trends: one defined by policies of privatization and deregulation built around circuits of international financial capital and spatial segregation and the other aligned with efforts to resist this regime through the repossession of space and politics through grassroots organizing and cultural production.4 For many scholars, these conflicts came to a head with the emergence of the 15-M movement in Madrid on 15 May 2011, a protest movement that then spread to other Spanish cities that summer. Born out of frustration with the lack of an effective political response to Spain’s economic crisis, which began in 2008, 15-M not only reshaped the Spanish political landscape, but arguably marked a generational shift in the understanding of Spanish culture. Scholars like Amado Fernández-Savater, Germán Labrador Méndez, Luis MorenoCaballud, and others have seen 15-M as the end of the “culture of consensus” and the “Regime of 1978” that had dominated Spanish politics since the approval of Spain’s constitution in 1978.5 This book does not seek to explain 15-M nor argue for its significance (that it was significant is not debatable, even if the how and why might be). Rather, it argues that the spectacle of 15-M in all its chaotic mix of local and global politics had been rehearsed in the preceding decade in the struggles over urban space in Lavapiés and the many spectacles produced by those conflicts. Most significantly, I argue that these tensions between local, municipal, and global discourses in Madrid have a long and important history in the capital, and that they have often been expressed on the urban stage of Madrid – both in urban space itself and in the cultural imaginary. The study of this history reveals how dominant power structures, as well as movements of popular resistance, have used spectacles to engage with these layers of meaning in long-standing struggles over the meaning of Madrid – and even of Spain itself. It is these urban spectacles that form much of the primary material for exploring the central questions in this book. What follows is an examination of the important tensions between institutional and non-institutional cultural production in the formation of cities, which also considers how local expressions of urban culture fit into their global context. This research not only demonstrates to scholars in the Humanities and Social Sciences the material impacts of cultural production on the shaping of cities, but it\n\n6\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nalso brings attention to the development of cooperative approaches to urban cultural production that have emerged in Spain in recent years. It is my hope that readers leave this book with a richer understanding of Madrid’s theatrical tradition and a deeper sensitivity to the ways that culture shapes the urban experience.\n\nt h e u r ba n s tag e of lavapi és In the late afternoon of 12 June 2012, the rhythmic sounds of bhangra beats filled the Plaza Agustín Lara in Madrid’s Lavapiés neighborhood as a group of dancers delighted spectators with their Bollywood dance moves on a temporary stage erected in front of the rehabilitated ruins of the old Escuelas Pías school and chapel (see Figure 1.1). For the fifth summer in a row, the BollyMadrid festival had turned public space in Lavapiés into a mini-Mumbai (or someone’s simulacrum of Mumbai) to celebrate Bollywood and SouthAsian culture in Madrid. Similarly, an event from the year before, called “Tapapiés” had advertised the possibility of going “for tapas around the world without leaving Lavapiés.”6 Both events were intended to consolidate the reputation of this iconic neighborhood as the multicultural heart of Madrid – a well-deserved reputation, since even on a brief foray through the neighborhood today, one might find Bangladeshi and Pakistani residents playing badminton in the Plaza Nelson Mandela (formerly the Plaza Cabestreros), several halal butcher shops on the calle Tribulete, with daily specials written in Arabic, and the smell of delicious maafe being served in one of the handful of Senegalese restaurants scattered along the calles Amparo and Mesón de Paredes. While local cultural organizations played an important role in its production, the event in the Plaza Agustín Lara was also the result of years of investment by Madrid’s Ayuntamiento (municipal government) to reverse years of neglect and to transform Lavapiés into an alluring symbol of Madrid’s international diversity, a goal reflected in the BollyMadrid moniker that referenced not the neighborhood, but Madrid itself. Gone was the dusty, repressed 1960s capital of Franco’s Spain; so too was left behind the crumbling and insecure inner city of the 1980s and 1990s. In its place was a dynamic urban spectacle in which the city’s working-class immigrant neighborhoods reflected a rehabilitated capital and the emergence of Madrid as a cosmopolitan and global city.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nFigure 0.1 | BollyMadrid Festival in the Plaza Agustín Lara, Lavapiés, Madrid, 2012.\n\nLavapiés also benefited from a number of other features that made it attractive to city planners and leaders for redevelopment. First and foremost, perhaps, was the neighborhood’s strategic location adjacent to Madrid’s recently refurbished Atocha train station and the city’s Paseo del Arte, containing the city’s most important (and most visited) museums – namely the Reina Sofía National Center for Contemporary Art, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Museum, and the National Museum of El Prado. Secondly, the neighborhood has been a locus for independent theater and bohemian culture in the city since the late 1970s. Finally, Lavapiés was also ideal for these redevelopment plans because it has long been romanticized as one of Madrid’s most “authentic,” or castizo, neighborhoods. This folkloric castizo culture has its roots in Madrid’s theater tradition, particularly in the short plays called sainetes, written by Ramón de la Cruz in the eighteenth century, which focused on Madrid’s lower-class neighborhoods and their inhabitants. Later, these images of Madrid’s lower classes would be rearticulated in the nineteenth century in Madrid’s lyric theater tradition of the\n\n8\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nFigure 0.2 | Enthusiasts dressed as chulapos for a street verbena in Madrid in 2018.\n\nzarzuela and in its wildly popular short-form, called the género chico, or “small genre,” that emerged at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. These images have come to be closely associated with Madrid, and are often celebrated as expressions of the city’s unique culture, particularly on 15 May during celebrations of the city’s patron: Saint Isidore the Laborer. During this feast day of San Isidro, many children, adults, and the elderly dress up as chulapos and chulapas. The men and boys wear the traditional white-and-black-checked newsboy hat, with a carnation tucked neatly into the lapel of a matching jacket or vest, while the women dress in form-fitting floor-length dresses evocative of Andalusian flamenco style, a white scarf on their heads, carefully knotted at the neck, and a traditional mantón de manila piano shawl around their shoulders (see Figure 0.2).7 One might even come across an elderly couple dancing a turn-of-the-century chotis in Madrid’s Plaza Mayor, a living reproduction of the scenes mythologized by Madrid’s theater tradition.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nw h at ’ s in a name? Notably, the mythology of Lavapiés extends beyond its associations with castizo culture, as the neighborhood’s name and origins are draped in mystery and debate. The neighborhood occupies the steep southern slopes of the high, dry meseta where, in the late ninth century, Muhammad I, the Emir of Córdoba, attracted by the site’s strategic defensive position, constructed a fortification that would eventually develop into modern-day Madrid.8 Lavapiés itself likely developed around the natural spring formed by the confluence of various streams (arroyos) as they made their way down the hillsides toward the Manzanares River that runs south along the city’s western edge before sweeping east on its way to join the Jarama River. The neighborhood’s name loosely translated means “foot-bath” or “foot-washing,” and may have derived, according to chronicler Federico Bravo Morata, from the fact that, during rainstorms, water would fill the arroyos, rush down the hill, and fill what is now the Plaza Lavapiés.9 This etymology of the name Lavapiés emphasizes its physical geography and suggests that common references to the neighborhood as a barrio bajo (low neighborhood) allude, in part, to its physical location literally below the central areas of the city – as such, it is the place to which water and other effluvium flowed.10 Yet the neighborhood’s “low” character historically has also been a reference to the social status of its inhabitants – whether because of social class or religious identity. Bravo Morata, for example, also suggests that the name Lavapiés derived from it being the place where “the bishop would wash the feet [lávase los pies] of the poor on a determined day of the year” – a tradition that was intended to evoke the humility of Christ washing the feet of his disciples (a reference to John 13:1–17).11 These theories not only attribute a purifying quality to the waters of Lavapiés, but perhaps more importantly they allude to the social status of the inhabitants and the possibility that their impoverishment offered the bishop the appropriate stage for this symbolic act of “humility.” One of the most persistent myths about Lavapiés suggests that it was the location of the city’s Jewish ghetto, or judería, a theory put forth in the late-nineteenth century by Father Fidel Fita, who suggested that the church of San Lorenzo, located in the neighborhood, was originally the site of the city’s synagogue.12 Unfortunately, as Gonzalo Viñuales Ferreiro has demonstrated, there is little evidence\n\n10\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nto support this narrative and much evidence to indicate that the synagogue, and indeed the judería, was located elsewhere in the city during the late-medieval period. In fact, maps from the period suggest there was little to no settlement in this area near the city.13 What does seem logical is that there began to emerge a small outlying settlement near the gate of the new enclosure, or cerca, that had been built to control the influx of goods and people after Philip II relocated the royal court to Madrid in 1561 and the city’s population surged.14 Whatever the character of this small settlement, it was likely made up of people who, for whatever reason, were not allowed inside the city walls.15 Perhaps because of Spain’s long tradition of religious persecution, it has often been assumed that this marginal community was either Muslim or Jewish. These assumptions regarding the judería have led to the popular belief that the foot washing referenced in the name Lavapiés refers to the ablutions performed by residents before entering the synagogue that supposedly used to stand on the site now occupied by the church of San Lorenzo. Despite this theory’s erroneous conflation of Jewish ritual practices and the Muslim foot-washing tradition, it is one that became codified as historical fact in the work of Pedro de Répide, who would go on to become an official chronicler for the city of Madrid in the early-twentieth century. In his Guía de Madrid from 1921 – a series of celebratory sketches of the capital published in the daily newspaper La libertad – Répide suggests that the etymology of the name Lavapiés derived from “some fountain or basin for ablutions in which, perhaps, it was customary to wash the feet of those that went to the Jewish neighborhood but did not belong to the community and, upon leaving, would wash or purify their feet.”16 Here again, the neighborhood’s foot washing remains a fixation, despite the somewhat odd interpretation of the ablutions tradition that assumed that people leaving the neighborhood would purify themselves in said footbaths. According to Répide, this history also suggests why the neighborhood always historically contained a high concentration of conversos – Jews or Muslims that had converted to Christianity.17 It is because of this (supposed) converso population, he argued, that Lavapiés acquired the nickname of La manolería, a name that came from “a Jewish preoccupation that caused the families of the conversos to always call the first son Manuel, by which, because of the abundance of this name, the neighborhood remained the place\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nof Manueles and, therefore, of the Manolos.”18 Any quick Google search about Lavapiés will demonstrate that many of these various dubious theories have been reproduced and informally codified in blogs and travelogues of amateur urban historians and travel writers from Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The very prevalence and persistence of these abundant myths, false histories, and etymologies regarding this historically working-class neighborhood point to the unique place of Lavapiés in the urban imaginary of Madrid.\n\nl ava p ié s , c r a d l e o f i mmi grati on While ambiguity surrounds the origins of the neighborhood, what is clear is that Lavapiés has historically been one of the traditional collection points for immigrants arriving in Madrid. From the waves of rural immigrants arriving from other parts of Spain in the late-seventeenth century through to the international immigrants that began to arrive in the late-twentieth century and the present day, Lavapiés would become the immigration arrival point par excellence.19 In the cultural imaginary, too, Lavapiés is characterized this way. Perhaps one of the most famous examples can be found in Antonio Nieves Conde’s famous 1951 film Surcos, which relates the tragic plight of a family arriving in Madrid from Andalusia in the mid-twentieth century. More recently, one might look to the 2002 documentary directed by Basel Ramsis and entitled The Other Side: A Closer Look at Lavapiés, which gives voice to the immigrant communities living in the neighborhood. These associations with immigration are significant, because Madrid as a whole, according to David Ringrose, is “a city of immigrants,” and within this context Lavapiés has often been perceived as the crucible where the amalgam of Madrid’s identity has formed.20 For example, for nineteenth-century chronicler Ramón Mesonero Romanos, Lavapiés was where lo madrileño (the thingness of Madrid) was formed: a fusion “of the boastful Andalusian, of the vivacious Valencian, and of Castilian severity and haughtiness.”21 As people from many different parts of Spain arrived, they were not only integrated into the capital city, but fused their regional differences into some invented idea of Spanish national identity. Today, this immigration and diversity has taken on a more international flavor, as much of the Spanish working-class population has been replaced by foreign immigrants. Indeed, between 1998\n\n12\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nTable 0.1 | Demographics of immigration in Lavapiés. Statistics from 2008 municipal census of residents.

By 2010, this dramatic demographic change made Lavapiés, according to the municipal census organization, the neighborhood in the Centro District with the greatest number of resident foreigners in the city, with 16,183 of the 49,754 total foreign residents.22 As a result of these numbers, Lavapiés has the highest concentration of immigrants per square meter in Madrid.23 This diversity includes the high numbers of North Africans that arrived in the early 1990s, as well as the groups that followed, including those from sub-Saharan Africa (particularly Senegal), South America, the Caribbean, other parts of the Middle East (Iraq, Iran), Southern Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), and, later, from China. It is in this context that Lavapiés acquired its international reputation and by 2010 became an asset for attracting both madrileños (Madrilenians) from other parts of the city and international tourists. Significantly, these high numbers of immigrants – many of them undocumented – contributed to the marginalization of the area during the late 1990s and early 2000s.24 The presence of other underserved groups – like the elderly – contributed to a general level of neglect in the neighborhood and, by the early 2000s, like much of the historic center of the city, it suffered from a proliferation of degraded housing stock. For example, at the turn of this\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\ncentury, the area in Lavapiés designated for targeted rehabilitation by the city included some 766 buildings with 11, 878 identified housing units. Around 4,969 (nearly 42 per cent) were considered infraviviendas (tenements) – that is, barely habitable.25 It is this setting that should be kept in mind as the story of Lavapiés unfolds in the forthcoming chapters. During this period of neglect, the low rents attracted other residents. As a result, it was not only the large immigrant population that gave Lavapiés its reputation as an “intercultural laboratory,” as sociologist Mayte Gómez has called it. She divides this intercultural character into four components. The first is the very engaged community of activists, including okupas (squatters), feminists, liberation lesbians and gays, anti-war activists, and housing advocates, which for years were loosely associated with one another in the Lavapiés Network.26 Other community organizations complement this cohort of activists. These include more traditional neighborhood associations, such as La Corrala Neighborhood Association, and those formed around ethnic identity, like the Association of Senegalese Immigrants of Spain, the Association of Moroccan Immigrants in Spain, and the very active Bangladeshi Neighborhood Association. In contrast to these more politically active residents, who arrived in Lavapiés starting in the mid to late 1990s, Gómez also describes the increasing presence and influence of novísimos vecinos, or newbies, a group of young, middle-class progressives, around thirty to forty years old, with some bohemian or artistic tendencies, that started arriving in the mid-2000s.27 The wave of international immigrants, activists, and novísimos vecinos that began to inhabit Lavapiés markedly changed a neighborhood that had been predominantly occupied by lifelong residents, typically elderly residents known as los vecinos de toda la vida. It is because of this mix of immigrants, neo-bohemians, activists, and the elderly that the Film Festival of Lavapiés has used the slogan “one neighborhood, many worlds” since its inception in 2003. To clearly delineate the limits of this neighborhood for this study, I rely on the work of sociologist Manuel Zárate Martín, whose interviews and surveys with secondary-school students from the neighborhood loosely designate the parameters of Lavapiés. According to these youths, the neighborhood forms a triangular-shaped area within the city center of Madrid that extends southward from the Plaza Tirso de Molina. It is contained to the east and west by the\n\n14\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nFigure 0.3 | Overview map of Madrid.\n\nstreets Santa Isabel and Embajadores respectively, while the southern boundary is formed by the Ronda de Toledo and the Ronda de Valencia as they connect the roundabouts of Embajadores and Emperadador Carlos V (where the Atocha train station is located) (see Figures 0.3 and 0.4). These limits distinguish Lavapiés from the adjacent neighborhood of La Latina and El Rastro to the west and the Barrio de las Letras to the east of the calle Atocha. Of course, these boundaries are fluid – all the more so since Lavapiés is not an officially designated district of the city, an ambiguity that reflects the shadiness of the neighborhood’s origins and name. In technical terms, Lavapiés is nothing more than the name of a metro stop and a plaza. Within these boundaries is a neighborhood characterized by a rich historical legacy, cultural diversity, inspired political activity, and, in the last twenty years, the spectacle of intense urban change.\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nFigure 0.4 | Detail map, highlighting theater venues and self-managed spaces in Lavapiés.\n\nf ro m\n\nbarrio bajo\n\nto\n\nbarrio cool\n\nIn September 2018, the London-based media and entertainment company Time Out chose the Embajadores neighborhood of Madrid as the “coolest neighborhood in the world.”28 The article highlighted cultural institutions like the Casa Encendida and the self-managed social center La Tabacalera. It seemed to eschew much of the actual Embajadores district to focus exclusively on attractions north of the Embajadores traffic circle, in what most residents would refer to as Lavapiés. This attention from an international tastemaker only continued to popularize the neighborhood. Perhaps as a result of this publicity, a proliferation of short-term rentals, via platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo, has plagued the neighborhood, as it has other “cool” cities in Europe (like Amsterdam and Barcelona).29 As Javier Gil and\n\n16\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nJorge Sequera demonstrate, many of these rentals are not owned by local residents, but rather by subsidiaries of international hoteliers like Wyndham Worldwide’s Friendly Rentals, which Sequera and Gil suggest own nearly two hundred units throughout the neighborhood.30 This process has profoundly transformed the real-estate market in Lavapiés and merely accelerated a gentrification process that began in the period that forms much of the focus of this book. In this period from roughly 1997 to 2011, the unique mix of inhabitants in Lavapiés created a potent combination for speculative real estate. Lavapiés had become a counter-cultural mecca. Its diversity, grittiness, political activism, and connections with a historic past gave, and continue to give, this unique neighborhood a particular “urban terroir” – a branded sense of place based on seemingly authentic local culture.31 By eating in one of the neighborhood’s many Indo-Pakistani restaurants along the calle Lavapiés or more castizo establishments like the Café Barbieri or the Bar Automático, one might consume the neighborhood’s distinct cultural offerings visually, financially, and/ or gastronomically. Alongside this social milieu, there were specific urban-planning decisions that encouraged the “urbanization of capital,” to use David Harvey’s term, an accelerating circulation of international capital focused on investing in the built environment.32 These decisions were the result of a process that began in the mid-1980s, as Madrid’s Ayuntamiento began to target Lavapiés for investment and urban change on the heels of the rehabilitation of the Atocha train station from 1985 to 1992 and the inauguration of the Reina Sofia Museum in 1992.33 In 1994, the Ayuntamiento, the Autonomous Community of Madrid, the Ministry of Development, and private sources entered into an agreement to designate Lavapiés – amongst other areas in the city – a Preferred Area of Rehabilitation (Área de Rehabilitación Preferente – arp ).34 The objectives of the arps were to improve the quality of life, restore the residential character of the neighborhoods, regenerate the social connections, improve the housing and building stock, and encourage citizen participation.35 When the project was finally put into motion in 1997, it leveraged nearly 120 million dollars from municipal, autonomous, and national governments, as well subsidies provided from the emerging European Economic Community (now the European Union). The improvements to the infrastructure in the neighborhood included the replacement of sewers and the construction of underground parking in many of the plazas.36 These projects also included\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nthe transformation of the ruins of the Escuela Pías building in the Plaza Augustín Lara into a new library for the National University of Distance Learning, the renovation of the Casino de la Reina park, and a flurry of construction activity associated with cultural institutions and facilities in and around Lavapiés. Amongst these new or renovated institutions there was the architect Jean Nouvel’s ninetytwo-million-euro expansion of the Reina Sofia museum in 2002; the construction of the Centro Dramático Nacional Teatro Valle-Inclán in the Plaza Lavapiés in 2003; a remodeling of the Teatro Circo Price in 2007; and a shifting series of plans for a new national museum on the site of the iconic Tobacco Factory, or La Tabacalera, a building from the eighteenth century that had been one of the main employers in the neighborhood for many years. This public investment was complemented by the opening of the social and cultural center, La Casa Encendida, by the foundation of the large, regionally owned savings bank Caja Madrid (the fourth-largest financial institution in Spain).37 While originally declared in 1994, the arp s really began to spur action when they were folded into the broader urban plan for Madrid laid out in the Plan General de Ordenación Urbana of 1997 (hereafter known as the Urban Plan of 1997). It was a plan that quite explicitly sought to position Madrid – in the words of former Vice-Mayor Ignacio del Río García de Sola – “amongst the great capitals of the world.”38 Relying on investment in infrastructure, subsidies for housing rehabilitation and construction, and new cultural installations, the Urban Plan of 1997 would position Madrid to compete within a post-industrial economy driven by tourism, advanced services (i.e., finance, accounting, consulting, insurance, etc.), construction, and real estate. Madrid would become a “Global City” – a term coined by Saskia Sassen to refer to large cities like London, Tokyo, and New York that serve as command-and-control centers for the circuits of global capital.39 While Madrid would never be an alpha city like those global metropolises, it was believed that Madrid could become one of the top beta cities by leveraging its corporate footprint across Latin America and the Mediterranean arc. These efforts were to be bolstered by a major rebranding effort that would culminate – so the plan hoped – in a winning bid for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games (a bid that ultimately was awarded to London). It was to be Madrid’s coming-out party in the European arena as a second-tier\n\n18\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nParis or London with the ability to successfully attract international tourists and foreign investment and enough cultural caché to unseat Barcelona as Spain’s urban crown jewel. Within these plans for transforming Madrid, Lavapiés would play a central role. The neighborhood was to become a cultural playground, an urban stage through which domestic and international tourists would pass on their way between the city’s other important (and adjacent) cultural sites. In this sense, the seemingly local efforts to rehabilitate the neighborhood deeply intertwined with a broader global competition between cities. What took place in Lavapiés in the first decade of the twenty-first century highlights the complicated nature of urban change in a globalized world. Through its symbolic value, the cultural geography of a neighborhood folds into the scale of the metropolitan; the metropolitan folds into national economic and political agendas; and all of these intertwine within the unfolding of administrative, cultural, and social bodies at the supranational level, like the European Union.40 Notably, during this same period Lavapiés also emerged as a locus of local, national, and global resistance movements. As a result, Lavapiés demonstrates what urban theorist Andy Merrifield has called the metropolitan dialectic: the urban is both the site where tremendous inequality is produced (often in the form of gentrification) along with remarkable cultural flourishing.41 Indeed, it is often the latter that contributes to the former. Thus, to discuss the production of urban space in Lavapiés during the early part of the twenty-first century juxtaposes a wide variety of spectacles – some capitalist, some resistant, but all caught up in the fundamental question of who has a “right to the city,” a question that has inspired many of the most important writers and thinkers in urban studies, from Lefebvre and Harvey to Don Mitchell and Manuel Delgado. These spectacles of protest included some of the most iconic and influential squatted social centers in Madrid. In their emphasis on self-management (autogestión), horizontal modes of organization, assembly-driven decision making, and pervasive notions of the “commons,” they would be incubation spaces for the tactics, knowhow, and ideological orientations of the 15-M protest movement.42 Without the squatted social centers of the early 2000s, the monthlong occupation of space in the Puerta del Sol in Madrid and other plazas in 2011 would not have taken the shape that they did.43 Notably, the energy of political incubation that began in Lavapiés\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nand flowered in the Puerta del Sol continued to bear fruit beyond that summer of encampments in the form of neighborhood assemblies, various anti-austerity mareas (waves), and the emergence in 2014 of the upstart political party Podemos.44 In short, the physical and discursive reconfiguration of urban space at the local level not only played a key role in a global strategy for rebranding and selling Madrid, but simultaneously activated local protest networks that would later move onto the national and global stage.\n\ns p e c tac l e s o f urban s pace What remains consistent between these two seemingly countervailing processes and the central focus of this book is a certain spectacular use of urban space. In other words, these local, municipal, and (inter)national spaces were not only bound together by conflicting approaches to producing the city, but also by a certain theatrical use of the city. These spectacles ranged from theater performances in shiny new theater and museum buildings to new residential construction projects.45 It also included theater performances in spaces appropriated by okupas (activist squatters) as well as theatrical protest tactics in public plazas amongst the manicured facades of rehabilitated historic buildings. Understood together, these spectacles demonstrate how urban space in the contemporary city has become the stage where different actors physically and discursively remake the city – some intended to commodify the city and the practice of everyday life and others that contest that neo-liberal vision. The interweaving of seemingly local processes of urban rehabilitation with global flows of capital and investment does not make Lavapiés unique – indeed, for urban planners and geographers these issues have been central to their studies of gentrification and urban development in a global frame for some time.46 Nonetheless, the intersection of the cultural and the material is an area lacking development within the field of Geography. Likewise, the spatial component of cultural production is often ignored by scholars of the Humanities. French urban theorist Henri Lefebvre’s theories of social space offer a very useful framework for working across these disciplines because of his emphasis on the dialectic between the built environment and social modes of being, and readers will note the influence of Lefebvre’s book The Production of Space on the analysis I present throughout this study. Most central to my approach is\n\n20\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nLefebvre’s argument that “every society ... produces its own space” and as a result, space should be understood not as an inert stage for human endeavor, but rather as a process.47 In basic terms, his triad of spatial production suggests a continual dialectical interaction amongst the rhythms of everyday life, the imagination of artists, and the movement of financial capital, as expressed in the constant building and rebuilding of the built environment in response to these various cultural and material vectors. My approach looks specifically to theater as the means of studying cities and social space because it is the literary tradition that most fully engages with the space of the city: theater arguably requires space and the public to truly exist in a way that other literary genres do not. I also believe that Madrid is unique, because of both its important role in the development of the Spanish theater tradition, as well as its use as a stage for the expression of monarchical power. Thus, it is through the theater that the city’s geographical complexity surrounding issues of scale, urban space, and the related conflicts over urban space and territory can best be explored. Therefore, I will demonstrate not only that Lavapiés is deeply connected to broader economic and cultural practices taking place in Spain during the last fifteen to twenty years, but that the urban landscape of Madrid has long been used as a theater for articulating power across various geographic scales. As a means of distilling this Lefebvrian triad into an urban context that allows for both the study of actual theatrical texts as well as theatrical uses of the city, I use the term urban spectacle – a term that resonates with both my interest in theater and the process of urban development. From Roman processionals to postmodern Olympic games, cities have been the stage for innumerable spectacles throughout history. As a result, I am certainly not the first writer to use the analogy with the theater as a way to discuss the city. From Lewis Mumford’s assertion that the city is a “theater for social action” that both “creates the theater and is the theater” to Richard Sennett’s explorations of “spectator architecture” in his essay “The Public Realm,” the staging of cities and our performance within them has been a continuing theme for writers and philosophers from a wide range of fields.48 Indeed, in the Iberian context, Catalonian anthropologist Manuel Delgado takes this analogy head-on in his book El animal público [The Public Animal], questioning its validity for understanding public space and positing instead that the theater of public space,\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nlacking a coherent plot, is merely a series of sketches.49 Likewise, he also considers the neo-liberal spectacle of the contemporary city in his influential critique of the Barcelona Model.50 Despite sharing a concern with issues of public space and contemporary cities, I engage with this metaphor in a much different way, because I look to actual theaters, theater texts, and performances to tease out the ways that cultural production has become one of the fault lines between neo-liberal urban development and the urban activism of citizens defending their right to the city. In articulating the city in terms of its spectacles, readers will also recognize the important influence of Situationist philosopher Guy Debord. Urban space for Debord was fundamentally about spectacle and the tensions between the spontaneity of everyday life and the conversion of daily life in the city into an endless consumer experience. The Situationists did much to map, challenge, and sketch the “psychogeography” of the city through their playful dérives, or drifts, through the city, tactics intended to highlight and subvert the everyday rhythms of the modern city, break through the bourgeois spectacle, and rediscover the humanity found in everyday life: children in parks, the elderly on park benches, etc. These playful strolls were complemented by a more radical détournement, or monkey-wrenching, of city space, carried out through counterspectacles manifest in the occupations of buildings and streets. Debord’s idea of spectacles and counter-spectacles provides a key theoretical framework for discussing Madrid and Lavapiés, but this term has a number of layers that require further explanation. In the most general way, I use the term urban spectacle to refer to the physical transformation of the city into a cultural product intended to attract international capital in the form of investment and tourists. Like Debord, I also include the counter-spectacles that accompany this process of urban change in the form of protests, squatting, and encampments that challenge the reification of the city as mere commodity. I argue that, while the urban spectacle of contemporary Lavapiés is instructive about urban development in the twenty-first century, the particularity of the theater tradition in Madrid and Lavapiés forms an important palimpsest – both material and textual – that cannot be ignored.51 Therefore, as I have stated, I also use it in a more literal way to refer to the theater buildings, theatrical performances, and theater texts where these conflicts over urban space occur.\n\n22\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nI look to these very particular types of spectacles because of the deep historical linkages in both Lavapiés and Madrid between theater, urban space, and the cultural imaginary. From royal processions to military parades, Madrid has a rich tradition of serving as a stage for the consolidation of national identities, a fact that will be shown in the early chapters of this volume. Likewise, in Lavapiés, too, the spatial and the imaginary converge in the neighborhood’s unique role as both a site and subject of Madrid’s theater tradition, a history that is a fundamental and compelling backdrop to understanding contemporary Lavapiés. Importantly, whether as a strategic site in a new redevelopment plan or the subject of popular musical theater, spectacles in Lavapiés have always been embedded within a network of geographical discourses that spanned the local, the municipal, the national, and even the global (depending on the historical moment). Examining a broad historical period in Madrid’s history, I argue that theatrical spaces (understood broadly) illustrate the Lefebvrian idea that “social spaces interpenetrate one another and/or superimpose themselves upon one another.”52 Thus it is also in this discussion of geographic scale that my “urban spectacle” differs from Debord.\n\nt h e p l a n o f t h e p r esent work: a l e f e b v r ia n tri ad In the coming chapters I will explore the multifaceted ways that the rehabilitation of Lavapiés should be understood as an urban spectacle, while also demonstrating how the symbolic value underpinning this rehabilitation relies in part on a very particular historical legacy. To study Lavapiés in this way draws on a large and expansive body of scholarship, which includes not only the previously mentioned authors, but also the work of scholars like Sharon Zukin, Gerry Kearns and Chris Philo, Jamie Peck, Loretta Lees, and David Harvey, others that have delineated the important connections between the production of culture, capital, and real-estate speculation.53 Through the study of Madrid’s historical connections between city space, spectacle, and power, I demonstrate how the affective meaning of spaces in the city informs the way the city is used and imagined today. The first chapter focuses on Madrid and the way that theater and theatrical uses of urban space helped to perpetuate a spatial synecdoche, whereby Madrid would take on associations with the entire\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nterritory of Spain. I emphasize how the emergence of commercial theater in the late-sixteenth century and the use of public plazas like the Plaza Mayor and the Puerta del Sol were used to reinforce a spatial imaginary, in which Madrid formed the center of the Spanish Empire and (later) the modern State – cultural palimpsests that would later inform the symbolic power of that first 15-M encampment, called the Acampada Sol, which took place in Madrid’s iconic Puerta del Sol in 2011. The second chapter narrows this focus by demonstrating how the urban spectacles found in the sainetes, or short plays, by Ramón de la Cruz in the eighteenth century and the popular operetta tradition of the zarzuela from the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries reinforced these spatial synecdoches by metonymically linking Madrid and Spain in a castizo myth whose referent was the capital’s lower-class neighborhoods, most notably Lavapiés. In Chapters 3 through 5, I use Henri Lefebvre’s tripartite understanding of social space as an organizing tool. Chapter 3 focuses on the neighborhood’s important role as the focus of the Urban Plan of 1997, paying particular attention to the construction of the Centro Dramático Nacional Teatro Valle-Inclán in 2003. I frame this analysis within Lefebvre’s notion of “conceived space” – according to Lefebvre, the space of “scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic sub-dividers and social engineers.”54 Also called abstract space, it is the terrain in which capitalism articulates its codes, its requirements, its separation of labor, and its separation of reproductive and productive space. In this chapter, I demonstrate how the investment in cultural institutions at the scale of the urban – like this new national theater building – were intimately tied to a broader rehabilitation of Madrid, and the global profile of both Spain and its capital city. Moving from the “conceived space” of institutionalized cultural production in Lavapiés, Chapter 4 analyzes the iconic Self-Managed Squatted Social Center El Laboratorio 03 (El Labo 03). Through the study of manifestos, activity schedules, video documentation of protests, and theater activities, I demonstrate how the Labo articulated a new “perceived” space for the neighborhood – a series of spatial practices that sought to reimagine the social relations within the neighborhood. These resistant cultural practices not only defended the “right to the city” at the scale of Madrid, but also became incorporated into a broad defense of the dignity of everyday life outside the logic of global capital. The final chapter analyzes the representation of Lavapiés in two contemporary dramas: David Planell’s play Bazar, which uses\n\n24\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nLavapiés as the setting to explore the challenges confronting the burgeoning immigrant populations of “new” Spain, and César López Llera’s Un chivo en la Corte del botellón o Valle-Inclán en Lavapiés, a reworking of Ramón María del Valle-Inclán’s canonical Luces de bohemia (Bohemian Lights) to contemplate the dynamic between art and the city in the Madrid of the early 2000s. Reading Lavapiés through these dramatic works reveals one aspect of what Lefebvre describes as the neighborhood’s “lived” or “representational” space. Key to this part of the triad is the idea that this representational space is “alive: it speaks. It has an affective kernel or centre: Ego, bed, bedroom, dwelling, house; or square, church, graveyard.”55 If spatial practice refers to the ways that our bodies move through space, and representations of space generate our logical codification of space, then representational spaces account for the emotional and symbolic encounters that individuals have with space. Through this discussion of representational spaces, spaces of representation, and spatial practice in Lavapiés, I demonstrate how the physical and discursive reconfiguration of urban space by the various “actors” (i.e., urban planners, dramatists, activists, residents, etc.) at the local level of Lavapiés was deeply engaged with broader economic and political processes taking place in Madrid and Spain at this time. Understanding the urban history of both Madrid and Lavapiés through this lens offers insight into the emergence of the 15-M movement, the rise of Podemos, and the economic trends that led to the economic crisis. It is my contention that, through the history of urban spectacles in Madrid, we might better understand how stages in the city and the city as stage have long been implicated in the negotiation of identities and geographies at the local, municipal, and global scales.\n\n1 The Stage of a Nation: The Urban Theater of Madrid\n\nEach spring, on May 15, the streets of Madrid are turned into an urban spectacle dedicated not only to Madrid’s patron saint, San Isidro Labrador (1082–1130), but also more generally to the city’s folkloric castizo culture.1 While in Latin America the term was deployed in the service of hierarchies of race and caste, in Spain it typically has alluded to a folkloric vision of Madrid’s working-class neighborhoods in the early-twentieth century and the street celebrations called verbenas and romerías that accompanied the annual feast day of San Isidro and other fiestas castizas, such as those dedicated to neighborhood saints like La Paloma, San Lorenzo, and San Cayetano. In addition to the liturgical significance, the festival of San Isidro has also become a de facto celebration of Madrid’s popular culture in the city’s barrio bajos, neighborhoods like Lavapiés and La Latina that occupy the steep slopes just south of the city’s historic quarter. This castizo tradition owes much of its popularity and perseverance to Madrid’s unique tradition of lyric theater known as the zarzuela, which rose to popularity in the mid-nineteenth century, but whose roots extend back to the seventeenth century. Scholars like Carmen del Moral Ruiz suggest that these images of Madrid’s barrios bajos were disseminated so consistently and with such frequency that the myth of Madrid was “forged” by the zarzuela and its shorter form, the género chico.2 Given Madrid’s heritage as a destination for immigrants from the rural provinces, it was a myth that presented a certain notion of populist authenticity, but in fact synthesized many of the provincial traditions brought from Galicia, Andalusia, rural Castilla, and other parts of Spain during the various waves of immigrants that arrived in Madrid after it was named the\n\n26\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nsite of the royal court in 1561. In this sense, ironically, the contemporary expressions of “authentic” Madrid one might see on May 15 are more or less fabrications. As Henri Lefebvre has suggested, the production of space is more than merely bricks and mortar and the movement of people. These festival days reproduce this culturally imagined city today, but it is in the actual theaters of Madrid where it has its roots, a subject that forms the focus of this chapter. While it was the popular theater of Madrid that was central to fossilizing these notions of madrileño identity in the cultural imaginary of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, this process emerged out of a long history of theater production in Madrid in which local, municipal, and (inter)national identities were perpetually interwoven. The following chapter explores this historiography and lays the groundwork for understanding the relationship between theater and urban development in contemporary Lavapiés discussed in later chapters. It focuses on three key points while demonstrating that, from the early-modern period forward, the theater of Madrid helped to produce both the physical and imaginary city. First, I discuss the significance of Madrid as an urban center of theater production and illustrate the ways in which this theater culture arose alongside concerted efforts by the monarchy to use urban space as a stage for political spectacle. Secondly, I show that these efforts to use city space to project Madrid as the ideological center of Spain would continue as the modern state coalesced in the nineteenth century, albeit through the use of new iconic spaces like the Puerta del Sol. Finally, I discuss how the production of these local identities at the urban scale became imbued with national and international geographies: a symbolic vocabulary that would be utilized for both expressions of autocratic power by the Franco regime and later in the protests of the 15-M movement.\n\nt h e u r ba n t h e at e r of madri d Ever since it was named the site of the Spanish court by Philip II in 1561, Madrid has been the point of intersection between urban change and theater. One high-water mark in this history occurred during what is often called Spain’s Siglo de oro, or Golden Age,3 a period in which the first permanent commercial theater spaces developed and Madrid became a center of theatrical production. These\n\nThe Stage of a Nation\n\n27\n\nearly theaters relied on the interior central patios of buildings to create corrales de comedia (drama corrals). Although technically the first permanent corral was built in Seville in 1574, the most influential and paradigmatic corrales (namely the Corral de la Cruz and the Corral del Principe) were built in Madrid, and this model would be replicated across the burgeoning nation-state.4 From early on, the theater in Spain was intimately connected with the space of the city. It is a relationship that began around the ninth century, with theater’s liturgical roots in the performance of “sung tropes” (interpolated phrases), both inside churches and then on the streets.5 Corpus Christi became a particularly important festival in this regard when the use of floats and tableaux vivants were used to perform allegorical morality plays.6 In the late-fifteenth and early-sixteenth centuries, guilds and cofradías (charitable brotherhoods) took over these productions from the churches, and the theatrics and spectacle of the medieval church would shift from interior spaces to the city streets of emerging urban centers – the ensuing spectacles atop horse-drawn wagons becoming a fixture of the processional culture that would develop around important feast days like Christmas, Easter, and Corpus Christi. During the late-medieval and early-modern periods, according to Maureen Flynn, performances for the elaborate rituals of Christianity, like the blood-spattered spectacle of penitentes on Holy Thursday, “served the same function as tragic theater in ancient times.”7 Often these processions would become an important means for creating the representational space that constructs our emotional relationship with a site. For Margaret Greer, the performance of these liturgical spectacles in these incipient urban environments demarcated “the consecrated heart of the community.”8 The selection of the route and the hierarchical ordering of the various groups within these processionals helped to define the social order. Later, when the administration of these processions fell under the purview of the municipal government instead of the Church, Corpus Christi processions would become expressions of local pride and an arena for early forms of interurban competition – a foreshadowing of the important role of the cultural arts some five hundred years later in the globalized iteration of this type of municipal competition.9 Significantly, these public spectacles emerged just as Europe, and Madrid in particular, became increasingly urbanized, a demographic shift that followed the population reductions caused by the Black\n\n28\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nDeath.10 In the case of Madrid, the growth might be described as explosive. The city’s population almost quadrupled over the course of the sixteenth century, due in part to Philip II’s designation of Madrid as the site of the Royal Court.11 From 1550 to 1600, Madrid saw its population explode from about 20,000 inhabitants to nearly 100,000 (400 per cent growth), and reach almost 130,000 by 1630 (525 per cent growth). The proto-dramas of the late-medieval period were public events that relied upon an interaction with a public in a developing urban landscape to communicate an ideological message to a generally illiterate public. For example, the shift from the sacred space of the church to the street for the public performance of liturgy caused the dramatic space of the temple to overlay the physical space utilized outside of it. Eva Castro Caridad offers a useful description of this process, citing how “the disposition of places in urban space ... would always respect the orthogonal axis: East (Paradise), West (Hell), North (Christianity), South (Paganism), known already from inside the temple.” This organization of the space would convert “all of the plaza ... into a stage space, creating specific places (the Throne, the Heavens, the Mount of Olives, the Castle of Herod, the Doors of Hell).”12 Eventually this use of the public plaza for sacred performances would be replaced by the more civic spectacles of royal processions and other secular events. The mixing of the sacred and the secular, according to Castro Caridad, would be the “genesis of the city as a stage space in the history of the Spanish theater.”13 Through the processional tradition, urban space developed into a key site for the performance and communication of ideology – both political and religious.14 Madrid has a particularly notable history in this regard, because the city was literally an urban stage for the performance of political power: a set piece in the construction of a national identity and the power of the sovereigns.15 Authors Virgilio Pinto Crespo and Santos Madrazo describe how the traditional processional route began in the convent of Nuestra Señora de Atocha in the southeast corner of the city, on the edge of the grounds of the Palace of the Buen Retiro (now the Retiro park). The royal procession would follow the calle Atocha, skirt the outlying neighborhoods of Lavapiés, and pass through the city gate at Antón Martín. Continuing through what is now the Plaza Mayor (then the Plaza de Arrabal), the procession would end at the Alcázar (now the Royal Palace).16 At a\n\nThe Stage of a Nation\n\n29\n\npredetermined place (often the triumphal arch along the calle San Jerónimo), the leaders of the municipality would submit themselves to the authority of the king, while an actor portraying an allegorical image of the town would simultaneously offer the keys to the sovereign.17 The locality of Madrid subjugated itself to the consolidated centralized power of what might tentatively be called the nation – a body politic represented exclusively by the personage of the monarch. During the sixteenth century, other forms of performance began to complement these official processions, and the theater began to develop its more modern form (both artistically and economically). Initially, these secular theater productions (performances approaching our modern notions of drama) were limited to private performances, while public space was reserved for religious passion plays (autos) and wandering minstrels (jongleurs). Influenced by Italian dramas – both in content and business model – Lope de Rueda and Alonso de la Vega organized the first commercial theater companies by combining comedic public performance with elements of the commedia dell’arte, a theatrical tradition imported from Italy that already had a popular following.18 The short one-act pasos of Lope de Rueda gave way to the longer and more elaborate dramas of the seventeenth century as a formal industry of commercial public theater began to consolidate. The financing of the theater shifted from the exclusive patronage of religious organizations, municipalities, and the nobility to an institution based on individual ticket sales. This democratization not only subjected the theater to the influence of market forces, but it also broadened its audience and transformed the works of the Baroque period into products for mass consumption.\n\ncorrales\n\nd e c o m e d i a a n d the archi tecture o f e a r ly- m o d e r n theater\n\nThe rise of commercial theater in Spain led to increasingly more permanent performance spaces. Even as early as the seventeenth century – as will be shown – the representational space of the theater became an important point of articulation between a nascent national sensibility and a municipal identity. The theater – understood broadly – would be implicated in what Lefebvre describes as the abstract space of the city and help to leverage the urban landscape as a tool for the projection of power across a range of geographic scales.19 The\n\n30\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\ncorrales de comedia, as they were known, became ground zero for the veritable theatrical boom that took place during the seventeenth century. It is in part because of the remarkable number and quality of the works produced during this period that the early-seventeenth century earned its “Golden Age” moniker – a term that makes reference not only to the presumed high aesthetic quality of the works, but also the literal gold from the Americas that was (barely) funding the crown. In the theaters of the period, playwrights began to negotiate the new geographical boundaries of an embryonic nation-state by contemplating the changing power dynamics of the period. The term corrales refers to the central patio that was a mandated part of new residential construction in the Madrid of Philip II. The royal decree intended to take advantage of the long, narrow parcels of land into which the city had been subdivided in order to meet the housing needs of a swelling population.20 Because of their enclosed nature and the built-in hierarchy of seating created by the two levels with inward-facing balconies, these domestic spaces converted easily into commercial spaces for performances of theater (see Figure 1.1). Originally, these theater spaces were owned by religious charitable brotherhoods called cofradías, and were used to raise money for hospitals for the poor. The theater companies would lease the space from the cofradías, who in turn received a cut of the box-office profits, money that they would subsequently use to fund their charitable projects. The architecture of the corrales allowed the operators to more easily control access to the interior patio through the use of tickets.21 As the system of corrales developed into permanent spaces specifically designed for theatrical productions, they also became more commercial. With concerns over both the content of the works and the behavior of the patrons (particularly the attendance of women), the Council of Castile (basically the municipal government) became ever more involved in the management of the spaces and maintained tight controls on the frequency and duration of performances. As the cofradía’s distribution of profits began to include the city’s General Hospital, this close oversight only grew more pronounced, since the managers of the corrales reported directly to the Protector of the Hospitals, an important figure because of his status as a member of the City Council.22 In this way, the municipal government’s involvement in the management of the spaces grew, particularly as the theaters became a major source of revenue for the city treasury – a fact that helped insulate the theater industry against moralist objections.\n\nThe Stage of a Nation\n\n31\n\nFigure 1.1 | Drawing of Corral del Príncipe.\n\nThe most famous of these corrales – the Corral de la Cruz built in 1579–80 and the Corral del Príncipe constructed in 1582–83 – were built by a joint venture between the Cofradía de la Pasión y Sangre de Jesucristo and the Cofradía de la Soledad de Nuestra Señora.23 In contrast to the makeshift corrales, living spaces converted into commercial theater spaces, these two corrales would be constructed with a permanent stage and seating, as well as an awning to protect the audience. The cities would take a percentage of the profits from the door, with the monies eventually making their way to the various hospitals around the city. But the city was not the only beneficiary of this new commercial enterprise, as the adjacent buildings to these permanent corrales were not owned by either the city or the cofradías. As a result, the owners of those buildings began a side business selling tickets to access the windows that looked down upon the performance space. Often,\n\n32\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nthese owners even went so far as to construct box seats that would extend into the space of the corral. In many cases, the purchase of an adjacent “room with a view” was seen as an investment opportunity, and some owners, such as the Almirante de Castilla, invested in five or six boxes as a way to generate income.24 In each case, the owners of these buildings would give a cut of their profits to the theater companies producing the performance. Thus, a snapshot from the seventeenth century of one of these two principal permanent corrales reveals a spatial collage of private and publicly owned spaces devoted simultaneously to the production of theatrical performance and financial capital. It was in these two theaters where one of the greatest flourishing of theater production in the history of Spain (and, arguably, Western Europe) would occur. They were, in short, an architectural testimony to the significant role that the comedia came to play in the Madrid of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.25 The volume of works produced was astounding. Morely and Bruerton attribute eight hundred plays to Lope de Vega, four hundred to Tirso de Molina, and 180 to Calderón de la Barca.26 By comparison, William Shakespeare, writing at about the same time, is given credit for thirty-seven plays. Some estimates suggest that, in the seventeenth century alone, the Spanish theater industry produced some ten thousand plays and one thousand autos.27 There was, to say the least, a remarkably strong market for the production and consumption of theater from the late-sixteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century. Significantly, it was during this time of rich and varied cultural production that Spain’s fortunes as the most powerful empire in Europe began to decline, as its imperial project unraveled.28 In the midst of a series of national crises, the comedias not only played an important role in altering the uses of urban space in Madrid, but they also contributed to an emerging sense of national identity by producing a shared cultural vocabulary of dramatic figures and plots. Within this line of argumentation, Melveena McKendrick suggests that, faced with a culture of crisis, “the corrales responded with a national drama of epic achievement and individual self-assertion that allowed the Spaniard, when he gazed for a while into its mirror, to burnish his self-image and go away reassured.”29 The sheer volume of works produced and consumed in Madrid, combined with their affordability, broadened the influence of the comedia.30 If, for Benedict Anderson, the “imagined communities” of modern states\n\nThe Stage of a Nation\n\n33\n\nwere formed partially from the public sphere found in an emerging print culture, then, based on the sheer numbers of people consuming the comedias and the socio-economic diversity of that public, one can conjecture that the dramatic representations of the corrales may have contributed to an emerging sense of collective and – we might even venture – national cultural identity.31 It is perhaps here that the populace of Madrid would begin to “imagine” itself a community capable of constituting the modern Spanish nation.32 At the minimum, the theater played a key role in developing the cultural influence of Madrid. As James Casey argues, the support of the monarchy contributed greatly to the growth of the theater industry, allowing its influence to broaden substantially. Madrid became capable of reproducing its own hegemonic influence as not only a center of culture and power, but also through the use and influence of the Castilian language.33 The commercial theaters arose alongside other emerging spaces for artistic and cultural production, such as printing shops and painting academies. Within this context, particular notions of power and culture, like the monarchy, the role of the nobility, and honor and revenge, would find constant reinforcement in the comedias of the period, an idea advanced by a number of scholars.34 If the corrales played no role in forming the idea of the nation, they certainly helped to reinforce the values that would come to be associated with that nation. The dramatic innovations of the comedias helped to plant these seeds of the modern state. Underpinning these innovations was a fairly rigid structure that had emerged from the pervasive influence of the Italian theater tradition. According to Nancy D’Antuono, the Italianate quality of the Spanish theater made it palatable to seventeenth-century Spanish audiences because dramatists like Lope de Vega had codified many of the structural components of the commedia dell’arte: a three-act structure, balance, and duplication in plot and characters.35 Central to this “standardization” was the use of tipos-personajes, or character-types, that recurred throughout comedias of the period and made these works both easy to write (hence the remarkable volume) as well as easy to consume. In his influential History of the Spanish Theater, Francisco Ruiz Ramón identifies these principal “types” as the galán (young man), the dama (the maiden), the rey (the king), the gracioso (the fool), the caballero (the knight or gentleman), the villano (the villain), and the poderoso (the powerful lord).36 These tipos were at times not mutually exclusive and\n\n34\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\ncould be overlapping, but they did create certain expectations for the public that could then be exploited by the dramatists. The fact that audience members generally knew what to expect from each character’s tipo and how they would behave offered clear clues about how and when the social order would or wouldn’t be restored. It was this reliance on tipos that made many Baroque comedias so effective at playing with the ambiguities between reality and appearance. Other innovations in the Spanish comedia included a resistance to the Aristotelian division between comedy and tragedy, a change that led to the inclusion of kings and commoners as protagonists on the same stage. As these categories began to blur in the Spanish theater, the innovation would bring “the figure of the king down from his Greek association with divinity and heroism, set above other men, to the position of an ordinary mortal, having to deal with the conflicts, passions, and obstacles of life on earth.”37 The king became a man amongst other men, with the power previously invested in his persona now derived from elsewhere, an external fountain of power that would eventually become the state. Nonetheless, absolutism was ascendant politically from the seventeenth century until the late-eighteenth century, but, ironically, also implied the need to consolidate power against old rivals for power like the Church and the increasing influence of the aristocracy, the guilds, and a developing middle class. Campbell emphasizes that the rise in absolutism that occurred during this period “operated not through the unrelenting imposition of their authority, but through a process of negotiation and cooperation with existing powers.”38 The world of the comedia problematized the relationship between the king and the people by placing them as dramatic equals in many of the stories they created, while also reinforcing social values and mores like honor and duty.39 Despite the unsettling of the social hierarchy occurring outside the corrales, more often than not the king’s authority and role as deus ex machina remained unquestionable. One dramatic work which helps illustrate this tension between an emerging populist politics and steadfast conservatism is Félix Lope de Vega y Carpio´s canonical Fuente Ovejuna (1619). While the themes are relevant to my argument, the example is also compelling, because it is one of the most important plays written by perhaps the most important dramatist of this period (with all due respect to Pedro Calderón de la Barca). The play’s central argument describes an actual historical event that took place in a small village near Córdoba:\n\nThe Stage of a Nation\n\n35\n\nthe popular uprising in the town of Fuente Ovejuna in 1476. As in the events that inspired the play, the military, political, and religious overlord of Fuente Ovejuna, el Comendador Fernán Gómez, is killed by the local villagers in retribution for tyrannical acts of rape and theft against the townspeople. In the drama’s third and final act, these tensions between tyranny, sovereignty, and the collective will of the people come to a head when a judge sent by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella arrives to investigate the brutal murder of Gómez. In what is perhaps the drama’s most compelling scene, the judge confronts the villagers, demanding to know who killed the Comendador. Resident after resident approaches to declare: “It was Fuente Ovejuna, Lord” – one after another refusing to name any one individual, each asserting that the town collectively perpetrated the crime. In the play’s finale, the intransigence of the townspeople forces the judge to appear before the King and Queen and explain that they must accept the transgression as a collective act and either pardon the collective or kill them all. The monarchs, although held up as the final arbiters of justice, and therefore the ultimate legal authority, are really left with no option but to recognize the collective will of the people, forgive the crime, and restore order. The work is notable in its almost modern vision of the “People” as a force capable of exerting its will against the ruling class. To temper this threatening vision of popular uprising, Lope de Vega goes to great lengths throughout the work to demonstrate the town’s fealty to the Spanish king and queen. Indeed, even as the mob descends on the Comendador, the shouts of “¡Fuente Ovejuna! ¡Long live King Ferdinand!” ring out, and even as the bloodthirsty mob decapitates him, they continue reiterating “¡Our lords are the Catholic Kings!”40 Likewise, in the final scene, as the townspeople appear remorsefully before the Spanish monarchs, they continue to proclaim their allegiance by celebrating the glory and beauty of the King and Queen of Spain. The fact that the dramatic action of the play takes place in the historical period after the death of Henry IV of Castile and the onset of the War of Castilian Succession is also potentially important to the play’s overall ideological vision. With several scenes of Ferdinand and Isabella planning to take Ciudad Real from forces sympathetic to the King of Portugal, the play represents a Spain just on the cusp of territorial and political coalescence. In a separate plot line of the play, the armies of the Catholic Monarchs defeat a rebellion by military leaders in Ciudad Real. As a result, the monarchs are able to bring stability to\n\n36\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nCastile and the Iberian peninsula. In very basic terms, it is the origin myth of the Spanish nation and presents the monarchs as forces of justice and stability that stand in stark contrast to the tyranny of Fernán Gómez; they are the benevolent rulers that restore justice not only to the town of Fuente Ovejuna but to the broader “national” terrain over which they rule. In this sense, the work is often viewed as highly monarchical in its ideological orientation – a reading that aligns with the view that most seventeenth-century theater merely promulgated the interests of the state and the elite, while nibbling around the edges of critique through thematic interest in false appearances and a culture of desengaño, or disillusionment. In contrast to the image of monarchical stability offered by Lope’s play, at the time the work was written – sometime between 1610 and 1619 – affairs in Spain, as mentioned earlier, were moving in the opposite direction. With this historical context of crisis in mind, McKendrick suggests a more ambivalent reading of Lope de Vega’s drama. She argues that instead of seeing Lope’s vision within these king-plays, as she calls them, as monolithic, there is a “systematic campaign of demystification and a concerned and penetrating dialogue about the relationship between men and the institution of monarchy.”41 Antonio Carreño Rodriguez echoes this line of reasoning by arguing that Lope’s comedias should be understood as “allegories of power” that reject dominant modes of conduct by offering both positive models (like the Catholic Kings) and contrarian examples (like Fernán Gómez) of how to rule.42 These are views that situate seventeenth-century drama, and the work of Lope in particular, more firmly within the crisis in which Spain found itself at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Indeed, as McKendrick and Carreño have suggested, despite Fuente Ovejuna’s quasi-nationalist vision of the monarchy, the play is perhaps more astutely read as engaged in a contemplation of political power and sovereignty. It warns of the dangers of tyranny and the power of the people on the one hand, while on the other it presents a world held together by the strength of the Spanish monarchs. Significantly, the play makes clear that violence, or the threat of violence, underpins all the acts of power and justice in the play. This body politic built on violence evokes the work of sociologists Thomas Hansen and Finn Stepputat, who have argued that the “hard kernel of modern states” – as they call it – is found in “the internal constitution of sovereign power within states through the exercise of violence over bodies and populations.”43 In other words, sovereignty\n\nThe Stage of a Nation\n\n37\n\nrelies on the legal and legitimate use of violence by the state against its own people, an understanding that runs contrary to more popular notions of sovereignty that focus on the defense of one’s territory against foreign incursions. That kings and feudal lords might use violence against their own people is, of course, nothing new, but Hansen and Stepputat’s approach emphasizes that the state constitutes itself via this violence by disciplining – in the Foucaldian sense – the populace to accept this violence as a legitimate expression of authority. In its most basic terms, they suggest that the sovereign state to which an individual belongs is determined mostly by who has the legal right to enact violence on that individual. What is compelling in Fuente Ovejuna, though, is the way that the use of violence is inverted and appears to flow both ways. Though the violent retribution by the townspeople requires an intervention by Ferdinand and Isabella – an intervention that situates them as the arbiters of justice – the violence that is committed on the body of the Comendador by the people of Fuente Ovejuna demonstrates that authority is not a power derived from birthright, but rather from the potential to enact violence on the body. Although the incipient state in the form of the monarchy has the authority to absolve and implicitly approve of the people’s revolt, this power is in part granted by the people in their willingness not to revolt and carry out tyrannicide against the monarchs. It is this mutually constitutive equilibrium of violence that constructs the linkages amongst “state-territory-sovereignty.”44 Considering when it was published and the decadent state of Spain’s imperial project, Fuente Ovejuna clearly seems to be firmly ensconced within more generalized discourses of the era that attempted to theorize the monarchy and its relationship to the state.45 In a more historical frame, it is this same negotiation of power between an absolutist monarchy and a people’s movement that forms the focus of the opening case study in urban sociologist Manuel Castells’s book The City and the Grassroots, a groundbreaking work that spans multiple geographies (Spain, the United States, Ireland, France, Chile) and time periods (from the sixteenth to the twentieth century).46 His research on the revolt of the comuneros in Castile in 1520–22 reveals that nearly a hundred years preceding the publication and production of Fuente Ovejuna there had been “a citizen movement for local autonomy ... challenging the feudal order ... in search of a modern constitutional state.”47 Importantly, this research\n\n38\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\nalso reveals that, even as early as the first decades of the sixteenth century, the city functioned as both a technology of resistance as well as power. It is not only the place where power was consolidated, but also the stage for reforming the developing state. The impact of the comuneros, according to Castells, was profound, in that it transformed medieval cities from a “spatial form into an urban culture and a political institution.”48 This was a revolutionary development, in that the comuneros envisioned a new socio-political organization for society – “both in the cities themselves (the commune) and in the overall state (the parliament) as a representation of free cities.”49 It is perhaps exactly this anxiety and tension that is explored in Fuente Ovejuna. In the burgeoning metropolis of Madrid, the king’s hold on power was perhaps seen as somewhat tenuous.50 Given the fact that the corrales were attended by individuals of all social classes – including at times the king and the nobility – it was perhaps a pragmatic move by Lope de Vega to leave the political content of his work open to interpretation. Nonetheless, Lope could not stray too far from a vision that maintained the social order of the monarchy. But even if the content of Lope’s work and that of other dramatists of the period were ambivalent in their political content, the urban circumstances of theater production allowed the corrales to be one of the few forms of “mass” media available in the early-modern period, particularly for a general populace that was largely illiterate. Juan Aguilera Sastre suggests that the pragmatic utility afforded by the management of the corrales was not lost on officials in the city. For this reason, he writes, “in Spain the majority of the corrales de comedias in the seventeenth century were managed by official decrees – typically municipal – that guaranteed and controlled this important cultural instrument as a true weapon of political action in all of its social, economic, and ideological derivations.”51 The censorship in the corrales de comedia was one of the tools by which the city leaders, in conjunction with the church, sought to manage social behavior and “educate” the masses.\n\nu r ba n s p e c tac l e a nd the s paces o f t h e m o n a rchy The pervasive influence of theater culture and spectacle in Madrid during the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century was not limited to these burgeoning theater spaces. The very urban fabric of the\n\nThe Stage of a Nation\n\n39\n\ncity contributed to the establishment of a “theater state,” as José Antonio Maravall has called it.52 While the ideologically conservative dramas performed in the Corral del Príncipe and the Corral de la Cruz produced the representational space of the cultural imaginary, the spaces of representation – that is, the spaces produced by urban planners and the practice of everyday life – were to be found in the material spectacle of the city’s architectural landscape. In this sense, the proliferation of urban theater occurring in the corrales was merely one component of a broader drama in which the city itself became a stage on which to enact spectacles of power – demonstrations of pomp and circumstance that were intended to convey the authority of the crown and an emerging state apparatus. Notably, this multivalent urban spectacle was produced within the municipal space of everyday life, but was deeply enmeshed with signs and signifiers of the expansive Hapsburg empire. In other words, the presence of the Court made early-modern Madrid a variegated space that used the municipal scale to convey the global reach of the Spanish monarchy. For scholars like Enrique García Santo-Tomás, this perspective has its limits, because it implies a fixed and immobile set piece, projecting power upon passive inhabitants. As he details so carefully in Urban Space and Literary Creation in Philip IV’s Madrid, his important work on the interplay of the theater and the city in the seventeenth century, this view of early-modern Madrid ignores the ways in which new smells, different clothes, new foods, and even tobacco from the New World were reshaping the relationship between public and private life. Indeed, he suggests that Madrid was more a place of contradictions, where an emerging modernity was beginning to butt up against older power structures: “a place of the new and old, like a recurrent palimpsest.”53 The dynamic between an emergent urban experience and the city imagined on the stage, as well as the broader artistic milieu of bookstores, printing shops, and schools of painting, generated a certain amount of cultural discord and melancholy. It was the type of urban alienation that would later become the central concern of urban scholars and philosophers.54 Thus one should not understand this “stage of power” to be all encompassing and the city’s inhabitants merely passive recipients. For example, readers familiar with Madrid of this period will recall the famous casas de malicia [houses of spite] scattered throughout the city, which were constructed with the illusion of one story in\n\n40\n\nFrom the Theater to the Plaza\n\norder to skirt the royal decree that had made mandatory the housing of functionaries in houses of two stories or more.55 Rather, it should be seen as an attempt to quell the very fissures that García Santo Tomás describes. The Baroque city would communicate power, stability, and solidity – the sense of social decadence countered by the force of imperial architecture. The work of Jesús Escobar on the shaping of Baroque Madrid is particularly informative in this regard, particularly on the role of the Plaza Mayor as an urban stage for enacting the power of the state. The distinct architecture that would come to characterize the Hapsburgs conveyed this authority, a style best illustrated by the iconic Casa de la Panadería, which hems in the plaza’s northern edge. Although this building was completed in 1607, the vision for the Plaza Mayor had begun much earlier, during the reign of Philip II, as he began to build the architecture of a global empire. Commencing in 1582–83, the demolition began of the irregular and uneven blocks of housing surrounding the Plaza de Arrabal – as it was formerly known – because of its location on the periphery of the medieval city. In its place would be a more open public space fit for royal festivals and processions, a space whose uniform architecture and unbroken lines would not only replace the old unsightly housing that had tarnished the appearance of the plaza for decades, but would also provide a reassuring image of rational organization that could provide a backdrop for the spectacles of monarchy.56 Escobar emphasizes that in this context of monarchical spectacle the Casa de la Panadería would be imbued with immense symbolic value because of its central role in the city’s network of bread distribution.57 During Corpus Christi, when cofradías continued the medieval tradition of producing mobile autos sacramentales, people would linger in the Plaza Mayor, still under construction, while the Casa de la Panadería framed the scene – a bread market that communicated the benevolence of the monarchy while perhaps also alluding subtly to the spiritual power of communion.58 Given that a bread crisis in 1589 had informed the rationale for constructing a centralized bread distribution center, the Casa de la Panadería stood as a symbol of the king’s ability, as Escobar puts it, “to nourish his people.” 59 Like the messages of good governance being communicated in the theaters of the time, the space of the city, too, served as a medium for producing the social space – to put it in Lefebvrian terms – of the urban environment in early-modern Madrid.\n\nThe Stage of a Nation\n\n41\n\nFor this reason, this visually arresting building also evoked the monarch’s power and reach. The mix of Flemish towers, the interplay of red brick with granite, and the rectilinear array of balconies astride uniform undulating porticos, evoked the architectural motifs of Philip II"
