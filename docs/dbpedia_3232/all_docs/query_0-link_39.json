Foreword In the foreword to Volume I of tliis edition of The Europa Year Book it was pointed out that there is still as great a need for international knowledge and communication now as there was in 1926, when the first edition of The Europa Year Book was published. This is especially true of the countries in this volume, with the increasing power of the so- caUed 'Third World’ in international affairs and, more recently, the beginning of a thaw in East-West relations and the emergence of China as a world power. Wiietlier for commercial, academic or general purposes, the present volume aims at providing information for the promotion of this international understanding. This 5^ear, one new chapter has been added, for the newly independent territory of Fiji, while the former Republic of Southern Yemen has now become the Democratic People’s Republic of the Yemen. The task of updating and gathering new information was hampered this year by a prolonged postal strike in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, every effort has been made to maintain our standard of accuracy with the most up-to-date information, further improved by the inclusion of an addenda of the very latest changes and events. Once again, we are ex- tremely grateful to all those organizations and individuals whose generous contributions have helped us in the revision of The Europa Year Book.

Its neighbours arc to the nortli the Soviet Union, to the west Iran, to the east China and to the cast and south Pakistan. The climate varies sharplj- between the highlands and lowlands; the temperature in the south-west in summer reaches I20®r (.iS.S°c) and in the winter in the Hindu Kush mountains of the north-cast falls far below zero. The two main languages arc Pakhto (Pashtu) and Dari Persian. With the exception of small minorities of Hindus, Sikhs and Jews, all Afghans arc Mu.slims, almost 90 per cent of them of the Sunni sect. Tlic flag consists of black, red and green bands bearing sjanbolic emblcm-s. The capital is Kabul. Recent History During both wars Afghanistan was neutral and is now a staunch advocate of the policy of non-alignment, accepting economic assistance from both East and West. Afghan-Paldstan trade and diplomatic relations were su-spended between 19O1 and 1963 over the long, and still unsettled, Pashtunistan dispute concerning Afghanistan’s support for an autonomous area for the Pathan tribes liWng in the north-west of Pakistan. The ten-year administration of Sardar Daud was followed by the administrations of Dr. M. Yusuf (ipdS-Gs), M. H. Mai- wandwal (1965-67) and the present Prime Minister, N. A. Etemadi. A liberal constitution was promulgated in 1964 and parliamcntarj' elections have been held in October 1965 and August-September 1969, although no political parties exist. Much political activity takes the form of radical student unrest; in the spring of 197*^ \"’<is countered by conservative Muslim demonstrations in Kabul. Government Under a new Constitution approved in 1964 the prime legislative body is a bicameral Parliament, elected for four years. The Lower House (House of the People) is elected by universal secret ballot; some members of the Upper House (House of Elders) are appointed by the King and by the provincial councils. Each of the 29 provinces has a Consultative Council presided over by a Govcimor. Provincial Governors are directly responsible to the Minister of the Interior. The Prime Minister is nominated by the King, who also approves the Cabinet Ministers appointed by the Prime Minister. Defence . , Every able-bodied Afghan has to serve two years in the Army, which numbers 150,000 men. Its equipment and training are very largely provided by the Soviet Union. The Afghan Air Force is equipped with supersonic jet air- craft. Police security forces come under the Ministry of the Interior. Economic Affairs Agriculture remains the mainstay of the economy, in terms of both production and employment. About two- thirds of agricultural production is at subsistence level. Eoughly a sixth, comprising wool, karakul skins, cotton and fruit, is exported, but it has recently been necessary to import quantities of foodstufis, notably wheat. There are known deposits of petroleum, iron ore (with estimated reserves of over 2,000 million tons) and other minerals, but commercial exploitation is limited at present to coal, salt and Lapis Lazuli. The discovery of over 60,000 million cubic metres of natural gas in northern Afghanistan holds promise for tlie development of the une.xploitcd minerals, and the increasing c.xport of natural gas to the U.S.S.R., started in 1967, will have an important impact on the eco- nomy. Existing sources of energy are imported petroleum (mainly from the U.S.S.K.), hydroelcctricity, coal and wood. Industry* accounts for only about 5 per cent of domestic production. Major industries ace cotton textiles, cement and the jirocessing of agricultural products, but among the limited consumer industries hand-woven car- pets arc very valuable as export items. Over one-third of c.xporls go to the U.S.S.R. under barter contracts, about a quarter to India and Pakistan under bilateral trade agreements, and the remainder is sold in Western markets for convertible currencies. Imports arc greatly in excess of exports, and Afghanistan is depen- dent on the foreign aid she receives mainly from the U.S.S.R. .\\mcrican aid has diminished in recent years, but has largely been replaced by assistance from China, France and Federal Germany. Foreign aid plays a maj'or part in financing the Third Five-Year Plan (1967-71). Transport and Communications Afghanistan is a land-locked country and the most convenient access to the sea lies through Pakistan. There arc no railways. The United States and tlie Soviet Union have helped to build all-weather highways connecting the main towns, and a network of asphalted highways covers the country. A road link between Kabul and the northern provinces through the Hindu Kush was opened in 1964. There are internal and international air services and water traffic on the River 0 .xus. Social Welfare Government officials in the main towns enjoy national health insurance and all officials are entitled to an Old Ago Pension. Most private companies have their own doctors and hospitals. There are 63 public hospitals. Disabled people are looked after in Social Welfare Centres in the provincial capitals. Education Primary education is free, and compulsory wherever possible; by 1968 there were 497,879 children in over 2,500 schools. The Government aims to provide basic educational facilities to 50 per cent of the population by igSo. There are two Universities. Tourism These are Afghanistan’s principal attractions: Bamian with its high statue of Buddha and thousands of painted 1 AFGHANISTAN— {Statistical Survey) caves. Bandi Amir with its suspended lakes. The Blue Mosque of Mazar. The walls of Kabul. Herat ■with its Grand Mosque and minarets. The towns of Kandahar and Girishk. Balkh (ancient Bactria) \"Mother of Cities’ in the north. Bagram, Hadda and Surkh Kotal (of interest to archaeologists). And, finally, the high mountains of the Hindu Kush. Visas are required to enter Afghanistan for nationals of all countries. Sport The -traditional sports are wrestling and buzkashi, a game played by teams of hundreds of horsemen. Athletics and ball games are sponsored by the Ministrj' of Education. Public Holidays 1971 : klay 7 (Birth of the Prophet Muhammad), August 23-25 (Independence), October 14 (H.M. the lung’s Birth- day), October 15 (Nejat Anniversary), November ig (Id el Fitr). 1972 : January 26 (Id el Adha), February 16 (New Year). Weights and Measures The Metric System has been ofiicially adopted but traditional weights are still used. One \"seer” equals 16 pounds. Currency and Exchange Rates The principal currency unit is the Afghani which is divided into 100 puls. Coins: i, 2, 5, 25, 50 Afghanis. Notes; 5, 10, 20, 50, joo, 500, 1,000 Afghanis.

The climate on the coast is temperate, becoming more extreme in the Atlas mountains immediately to the south. The Sahara, further south, is hot and arid. The languages spoken are French and Arabic. The Muslim faith pre- dominates; the Catholic minority greatly declined when most French settlers departed. The flag consists of a red crescent and star against a white and green field divided vertically. The capital is Algiers. Recent History Formerly a part of the French Republic, Algeria fought a civil war from 1954 to 1962. The nationalist forces came to be led by the Front de Liberation Rationale (FLN), based on Tunisia. In 1962, by the Agreement of Evian, self-government was ceded by France. There was provision to maintain French bases in Algeria and for continued French aid to the territory. In the autumn of 1963 there was a brief border ■war with Morocco but a cease-fire agreement was soon reached through the intervention of the Organization of African Unity. In June 1965 the former President Ben Bella was deposed in a bloodless coup d'ilat and Col. Houari Boumedienne assumed control of the state as President of a Revolutionary Council. Relations with France have since deteriorated, particularly during the winter of 1970-71 when prolonged negotiations about the French oil interests in .Mgeria took place. Mean- while strong links with the Soviet Union have been formed. Algeria has taken a militant Arab nationalist position since independence, notably over Palestine, and Col. Boumedienne is now generally thought to be amongst the principal leaders of the Arab world. Government Under the 1963 Constitution Algeria is a one-party state with strong executive powers vested in the President. The National Assembly is the main legislative body, elected for five years by universal adult suffrage. The present Assembly was elected in September 19O4. Since June 1965 the func- tions of Presidency have been exercised by the Revolution- ary Council. Communal and departmental assemblies have been functioning since 19O7 and 1969 respectively; the government announced a general election for a national assembly in 1970, but none was in fact held. Defence The National Popular Army, formerly FLN’s military wing, is now Algeria’s official army. The estimated strength of the armed forces is 65,000. Both France and the Sornet Union provide military equipment and training. Early in igOS France handed back its major nar'al base at Mers-el- Kilbir. Compulsory national service for both sexes was officially introduced in 1969, but many recruits will bo mainly employed on public ser\\'ice projects. Economic Affairs Algeria is predominantly an agricultural country, but it is also rich in minerals, notably iron ore, phosphates, oil and natural gas. An industrialization programme based on these resources is now under way. Oil production reached 46 million tons in 1969. Since 1964 liquefied natural gas has been exported in quantity to the U.K. and France, and a large American contract is being negotiated. With the exception of oil and gas, production in Algeria declined after the change of regime, but many sectors recovered after 1965. However, the economy continues to be heavily bol- stered by external aid. Most foreign firms have been nationalized; autogestion, a form of management by the workers, has been tried out in industry but is now being replaced by orthodox state capitalism. Wine, a major ex- port to France, is now also exported in quantity to the U.S.S.R., which is building a steel plant at Annaba. In 1969 Algeria joined the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In February 1971 Algeria took over 51 per cent interest in the French oil companies’ local operations, having previously nationalized all other oil companies. Transport and Communications There are 2,500 miles of railway, excellent coastal roads and good major roads over the mountains and into the Sahara. Algiers is one of the principal ports on the Mediter- ranean. There are internal and international air services. Social Welfare The unemployment situation has been improved by the creation of nearly half a million jobs in public works and by the opening of employment agencies. Some 30 per cent of the labour force are without work and many more are underemployed. Public works projects attempt to absorb some of the unemployed; workers are provided with food but otherwise unpaid. In 19OS an agreement was signed with France allowing 35,000 .Mgcrian workers into France each year. Education In the 1970-71 school year primary schools enrolled two million children, and secondary schools 225,000. Instruc- tion in Arabic is being gradually extended with the aim of eventually replacing French. Adult education is being expanded — 75 per cent of the population over 10 is illi- terate. A Four-Year Literacy Programme has been launched with the aim of teaching a million adults to read by 1973. Many teachers (over 5,000) arc French nationals whose .salaries arc largely paid for bj’ France. There arc universities at Algiers and Oran, and a university centre at Constantine. Tourism The cliief attractions for tourists are the Mediterranean coast, the Atlas mountains and the Desert, and the climate. An ambitious programme for the expansion of tourist facilities began in 196S with the object of attracting over 400,000 tourists a year by 1973. 11 ALGERIA— (Introductory Visas are not required to visit Algeria by nationals q{ tire following countries; Andorra, Bahrain, Denmark, I'inland, France and the French overseas territories, Guinea, Guyana, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Liechten- stein, Mauritius, Morocco, Norway, Oman, San Marino, Spain, Spanish Sahara, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Republic, Yemen and Yugoslavia.
