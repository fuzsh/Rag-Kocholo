        "text": "This book, Potosí in the Global Silver Age (16th–19th Centuries) seeks to foreground the entangled infrastructure and political economy that config- ured a new human and environmental landscape. We refer to the following dynamic processes: 1) the use of local knowledge, but also the adoption and innovation necessary to achieve the important transformations that took place; 2) the intervention (agency) and interests of different actors (workers, entrepreneurs, and authorities); and 3) the articulation and interrelation of different spaces. This volume also seeks to reunite production and circulation, while at the same time underlining the changes over the past 300 years that allowed for important economic changes and the emergence of capitalism. To analyze this center of the global world between the late sixteenth cen- tury and the first decades of the nineteenth century, in 2019, eleven scholars from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, the United States, France, Japan, and Great Britain came together in Sucre, Bolivia, to discuss their most recent research published now in this volume. In the first section, the reader travels through geology, sacred spaces, and technical knowledge; through environmental history and labor in the second section; flows, heterogeneous producers, and their agency in the third; and local, regional, and global impacts in the fourth section.\n\nOriginally published as a review in the journal Environmental Ethics, 2012: Review: Nicholas A. Robins. Mercury, Mining, and Empire: The Human and Ecological Cost of Colonial Silver in the Andes. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2011. 320 pages. ISBN 978-0-253-35651-2 (cloth). US$45.00. It is an easy thing to say that Nicholas A. Robin’s Mercury, Mining, and Empire is a good book—a very good book—but it is, I think, a more significant thing to spell out why it is more than just good, but truly important; it is the “must read” recommended by David Cahill of the University of New South Wales. First, the premise: Robins offers a detailed, vivid, comprehensive history of silver mining and mercury amalgamation in the Andes—at Potosi and Huancavelica—during the sixteenth and into the seventeenth centuries: “[b]etween 1550 and 1800 at least 136,000 metric tons of silver were produced in Latin America accounting for 80 percent of global production during that period” (4). He argues that the discovery not only of silver deposits, but of improvements in the amalgamation and volatilizing process through which high-grade silver is produced, “would not only help Spain consolidate its position as a global power but would also play a key role in the emergence of the industrial revolution and ultimately modern global capitalism” (4). This is a big claim, but one that becomes irresistible as Robins develops this compelling and tragic tale. Silver mining at Potosi and Huancavelica is a metaphor for the egregious human labor and environmental abuses that characterize global capitalism and its penchant for what I have called genocidal profiteering.\n\nBy the 1570’s, Potosí, and its silver, had become the hub of a commodity revolution that reorganized Peru’s peoples and landscapes to serve capital and empire. This was a decisive moment in the world-ecological revolution of the long seventeenth century. Primitive accumulation in Peru was particularly successful: the mita’s spatial program enabled the colonial state to marshal a huge supply of low-cost and tractable labor in the midst of sustained demographic contraction. The relatively centralized character of Peru’s mining frontier facilitated imperial control in a way the more dispersed silver frontiers of New Spain did not. Historical capitalism has sustained itself on the basis of exploiting, and thereby undermining, a vast web of socio-ecological relations. As may be observed in colonial Peru, the commodity frontier strategy effected both the destruction and creation of premodern socio-ecological arrangements.\n\nSilver plays important roles in pre-Columbian, colonial and modern South American societies. Case studies covering the production stages, and spanning nearly two millennia, provide examples of the complexities of silver metallurgy. Ethnographic evidence from Bolivia demonstrates the function of the pre-Columbian huayrachina furnace, adapted to the environment of the High Andes, while an archaeological site in southern Peru exemplifies the small-scale, probably domestic, processing of silver slag across major socio-political changes. The transition from indigenous to European technology is another complex aspect of South American silver metallurgy and highlights the importance of studying technology in its social and economic contexts. We can see the co-existence over several centuries of a large-scale state-run silver industry, based on the patio process (and requiring a long-distance network to provide silver ore, mercury, energy and supervision), alongside a small-scale European high-temperature silver extraction (using fuel-intensive ‘dragon’ furnaces), and a surviving indigenous technology based on huayrachina furnaces.\n\nThis article tries to transcend the ‘national’ histories criticised by Van der Linden and to connect the spheres of production in Potosí, in the heart of South America, with the spheres of circulation there and beyond the seas, in Europe and in Asia. A first part tries to explain briefly how silver lost its pre-eminence and visibility, showing the switch from the framework analysis of dependency theories to the great divergence debates. A second part summarises the estimates of silver flows, its cycles and the role of Potosí. The third part reconstructs the different routes and trade of silver from America to Spain and Europe but also the routes to the Middle East or Asia through Africa. The case of the VOC (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, literally United East India Company or Dutch East India Company) is a very clear example of the role of silver in global trade, but also of the way silver was transformed into silk, spices or other commodities. The fourth and final part recapitulates the labour relationships in Potosí, showing the coexistence and articulations between unfree, free and self-employed people as a result of colonial coercion but also of the agency of workers. The article concludes by pointing out a paradox: the fact that the amount of silver that stayed in the region allowed intra-regional connections but, at the same time, and without any re-inversion in the region, the vivid economic centre of Potosí declined together with its ores."
