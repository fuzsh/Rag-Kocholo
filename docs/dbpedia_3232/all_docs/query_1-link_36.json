        "text": "In examining Spanish-German relations during the war, it becomes evident that Germany did know how to find the way to the soul of neutral Spain. The overall aim of German activity in Spain was to ensure Spanish neutrality at all costs in order to prohibit Spain from joining the Entente. However, this often meant completely violating the country’s rights as a neutral in the European conflict. This becomes particularly evident when examining Germany’s attempts to disrupt the Allied economic war effort from Spain as much as possible. While widespread German press propaganda ensured heated debates amongst Francófilos and Germanófilos, German diplomats tried to influence important power brokers in Spain such as King Alfonso XIII. On one hand, German diplomats and agents bolstered Spain’s conservative and monarchist ruling elite, and on the other hand, Germany also supported and infiltrated Spanish workers organisations with the aim of agitating strike action which would negatively impact on Allied trade. The article will outline the main aspects of German interference in Spanish domestic affairs during the First World War and the destabilising effect this interference had on Spain's already highly fragile domestic situation.\n\nThis paper argues that immediately after the defeat of France in June 1940 the Germans missed an opportunity to engage Spain on their side, and possibly close Gibraltar to the British. For a variety of reasons, Hitler missed a potential opportunity that might have dramatically altered the course of the war."
