Messenger and Katrin Paehler He made it through denazification without many problems. He was categorized as a “follower.” He stood trial but was acquitted. He received a mild sentence. His sentence was commuted. He went on to make a career in the Federal Republic of Germany or made good elsewhere. At the very basic level, this book grew out of a deceptively simple question: how did members of Nazi Germany’s functional elites manage to recast their past experiences in such a way as to move on to successful careers and lives in postwar Europe? What type of active roles did these men—and a few women—play in the process through which they recast themselves, their former activities, and their convictions? What type of networks existed that made this process easier? This volume addresses these and other questions by focusing on the career paths, ideas, and agency of select individuals known to have had “Brown Pasts.” Some of these names are familiar; others are less known. The eleven case studies assembled here investigate the private recasting processes of Nazi functional elites, such as presumed lesser German war criminals, SS members, party functionaries, administrators of spoliation and genocide, and intelligence agents, as well as the networks they created and used to make these processes possible. Rather than running from their pasts, these individuals embraced selective parts of their biographies during the Third Reich and made them congruent with the conservative character of the Federal Republic and the ideological contest of the emergent Cold War. It is well known that a good number of former Nazi functionaries ascended to positions of influence in the Federal Republic of Germany. Like clockwork, West Germany encountered scandals. Some of them were of domestic origin, as for example the case of Untersuchungsausschuss Nr. 47 (Investigative Committee No. 47), which, in response to newspaper reports in 1951, dealt with former Nazis in the Foreign Office.1 Others originated outside of the Federal Republic, such as the infamous Waldheim affair, when former United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim’s past as a Wehrmacht officer came to light during his run for Austria’s presidency in 1985.2 More frequently than not, such scandals emerged from the “other” Germany—the German Democratic Republic—which hoped to score points in the Cold War’s German-German propaganda battle. Most notable in this context is the Brown Book, published in East Berlin in 1965 and designed to draw the world’s attention to former Nazis in positions of influence in the Federal Republic. The materials, swiftly rejected by the West German government as Communist propaganda, were an embarrassment for the Federal Republic. The Brown Book was also, at least for the time being, the culmination of a constant flow of information and accusations originating in the GDR. As Ulrich Brochhagen has shown, these East German information releases did not remain domestic or even German-German issues; rather, they often led to diplomatic issues for the Federal Republic.3 West German journalists also did much to draw the West German public’s attention to former highranking Nazis in position of power and influence. So did the Student Movement, which from the late 1960s onward mobilized a counterpublic that challenged the West German\n\nestablishment and its “fascist” tendencies. Recent years have seen scholarly treatments of the same issues. By and large, the studies confirm the reality that many former Nazis moved more or less seamlessly into their postwar careers.4 Scholars have focused on the various reasons for this development. For example, they have studied the policies that either made it possible for former Nazis to embark on postwar careers or at least did not prevent them from doing so. One focus has been on the limits of denazification. As established at the Potsdam Conference, denazification was meant to destroy the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (NSDAP) and its affiliated organizations. The goal was to negate Nazi institutions and laws, arrest and intern war criminals, remove Nazi officials from public and “semipublic” life, and eliminate National Socialist influence from the German education system. The Allied Control Council (ACC) took charge of these efforts and was aided by laws developed within each occupied zone. Combining ideas of reeducation and punishment, the architects of denazification saw internees as potential threats to security, order, and stability, and they sought to remove Nazism from German political and cultural life. Similarly, they hoped to render Germany’s economy and politics less militaristic.5 The best way to do this, in the minds of Allied planners, was to remove people from positions of influence and power. In its implementation, denazification fell well short of its ambitions.6 For one, putting every suspect on trial on the basis of his or her membership in Nazi organizations was too impractical, given the nearly 2 million individuals who qualified in the U.S. zone alone. As a result, both the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg and subsequent trials emphasized major war criminals and representative institutions, like the SS, big business, and the medical establishment. And even at Nuremberg, many people who qualified under earlier definitions of war crimes were not included.7 In addition, daily occupation operations on the ground demanded experienced individuals who might have had Nazi pasts. In the summer of 1945, food shortages, high unemployment, and the need simply to have functioning municipal governments compelled Allied soldiers and commanders to enlist local businessmen, government employees, and others in reconstruction efforts rather than arrest them. In the U.S. zone, the military—first the fighting and later the occupational force—was responsible for carrying out investigations. Sometimes they were assisted by members of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the Army’s Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC), but many times they were not. The public safety teams of the military government, charged with primary responsibility for carrying out what came to be the first round of denazification investigations, were sorely understaffed.8 The need for German assistance in administration and the need for manpower to help with investigations resulted in the creation of local denazification panels, or Spruchkammern, run by Germans.9 Ultimately, the U.S. military governor of Germany, General Lucius D. Clay, granted amnesties based on age, income level, and the existence of disabilities.10 What was true for the U.S. zone of occupation held true for the others, too, and even in the Soviet zone, one found similar approaches to the same issues, albeit with a mind to Stalin’s goal of future political and ideological dominance.11 In short, denazification never achieved what it had set out to do. Among the most positive things to be said about the denazification effort is Michael R. Hayse’s observation that, while as a “program for\n\ndispensing justice” it was a failure, denazification managed to achieve “the professional exclusion of the most prominent National Socialists … relatively well.” It was a way of weeding out the worst, but it lost its impact on the lower levels. Moreover, the “lower levels” began fairly high up, and many people slipped through the system.12 Denazification also proved unpopular among the German public, a fact that contributed to the program’s early demise. Many Germans considered denazification to be “victor’s justice,” administered by people with a scant understanding of Nazi Germany’s realities or, later on, by local Spruchkammem that frequently let the “big fish” go and punished the “small fry.” Popular perceptions of injustice aside, most people were labeled as “fellow travelers” and received negligible punishments. The denazification effort was, in the words of Lutz Niethammer, nothing less than a giant “fellow traveler factory” (Mitläuferfabrik).13 And as the Federal Republic of Germany emerged from occupation in 1949, local officials who had stringently enforced denazification lost in elections. Consequently, in September 1949, the new West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer spoke against the perceived injustices of denazification and sought to move beyond it.14 Earlier, Adenauer had already stated the need to “punish the guilty, [extend] forgiveness and [make possible] reintegration for the misled or the fellow travelers.”15 The ChristianDemocratic politician’s plea made sense to a lot of West Germans. As Norbert Frei, Robert Moeller, and others have shown, there was widespread solidarity among members of the former Nazi racial community as the Bonn Republic emerged. The amnesty and the release of prisoners in the late 1940s and early 1950s was in part a reaction to popular protests, which the Protestant and Catholic churches and the press had mobilized.16 Clearly, the population’s overall reluctance to see “victor’s justice” as beneficial to Germany, as well as the piecemeal watering down of denazification, allowed many to escape the consequences of their earlier activities. The failures of Allied and German denazification efforts serve as an important backdrop to the investigations in this volume. But the chapters assembled here have a different vantage point. They focus less on top-down policies than on the agency of individuals impacted by these policies. How did former Nazis, with histories of involvement in espionage, wartime atrocities, and mass murder, make their way in the new postwar world? What stories did they tell about themselves? What narratives did they construct, individually or as groups? How did these self-styled accounts influence policies and affect career paths? This book focuses largely on mid-level Nazi functionaries and explores how they sought to recast their own pasts and to mold their stories to fit the new context in which they found themselves. They created—to employ Robert Moeller’s apt phrase—a usable past, and in doing so they were prepared and eager to counter Allied policies from the start.17 The shortcomings of denazification gave them room to exercise their agency. They used the gap between the denazification policy’s rhetoric and its reality to put in place their own accounts of the past. And the emergence of the Cold War allowed them new avenues to pursue in the process of recasting. The chapters that follow thus provide the connection between the immediate experience of political and military defeat and denazification and the later integration of former Nazi functionaries into (West) German society. They show the processes of reshaping identities and envisioning futures\n\n—collectively and individually. The methods used to recast one’s identity in the postwar era were varied. But what unites these case studies is a singular realization: many ex-Nazis did not run from their pasts but instead developed ideas and networks of associates that drew upon their identity as Nazis. Some offered themselves as assets to the Allies in the process of reconstruction, selling themselves as insiders, not as criminals. Others, as Donald Bloxham has suggested, portrayed themselves as nationalists of a distinct manner.18 They thereby moved away from Nazism but asserted a revived and revised form of conservative nationalism. This volume makes regular use of the term recasting, and it is therefore worth noting the resonances of this term. The phrase “recast identity” is often applied to the case of West Germany, while in regard to East Germany “forging a Socialist identity” is common. In one respect, the difference between the two is negligible. Both refer to melting something down and giving it a different form. However, “forging” implies force—the beating or hammering of a heated object into an entirely new form. To be sure, Frank Biess makes it clear that in the GDR there was no need “to undergo a radical change but [returning POWs] needed rather to integrate their already existing mental dispositions into new symbolic, social, and political contexts.”19 Yet “to forge” still implies a more brutal and involuntary process and, at least outwardly, a renunciation of the past. The term also carries with it associations of the USSR’s forced industrialization in the 1930s, of high Stalinism, and of Nikolai Ostrovsky’s famous 1930s novel How the Steel Was Tempered (Kak zakayalas’ stal’). “Recasting,” in contrast, connotes a less violent process of reshaping or of presenting existing elements in a different light or configuration. For the purposes of this volume, it refers to a process that allowed people to adopt new personas compatible with the prevalent norms of West German society. One could even think of it as a private Vergangenheitsbewältigung—coming to terms with the past, making sense of it, and renarrating it. In the introduction to their edited volume on urban memory, Gavriel Rosenfeld and Paul Jaskot note that at first glance it appears that in the early years there was a desire in the Federal Republic of Germany “ to marginalize” Nazism’s architectural artifacts. Yet the devil is in the details, as they also observe that this was not “a period of complete amnesia.” Rather, it was defined by “highly selective memory,” an insight that accords with recent scholarship that sees postwar West Germany as anything but silent about the Nazi years.20 Just as cityscapes were recast, so were individual and group identities in postwar Europe. Scholars have already drawn attention to the role of common and even coordinated narratives crafted during denazification proceedings, in the so-called subsequent trials, in the business community, or among Germany’s professional elites.21 Indeed, at the time the public often embraced these portrayals of innocence and victimhood, which colored views of Nazi Germany and its crimes for decades to come. The eleven chapters of this book indicate that the building of such narratives began early, stretched across the globe, and often brought together unexpected actors. The chapters in this volume give a face to processes too frequently described in depersonalized terms and thus broaden our understanding of how the “politics of the past” played out in post–World War II Germany.\n\nTwo key questions attend the story of postwar recasting: How was it possible for so many people to integrate almost seamlessly into postwar society? And why were they accepted so readily? This volume’s authors offer answers that go beyond issues of postwar exigency and the need for people to administer the reconstruction of a devastated country. The stories these Nazi functional elites told about the past made sense not only to themselves but also to many ordinary Germans who were also trying to come to grips with their experiences during the Nazi years. In the early 1930s, many Germans negotiated their way into Nazism, as Peter Fritzsche has shown.22 In the late 1940s, they were negotiating themselves out of it. And what had helped people in the 1930s to embrace the Nazi project—the grab-bag nature of much of the Nazi Weltanschauung—now helped them disassociate from it. George Browder suggests that the existence of “ideological conjunctions” (antiliberalism, anti-Marxism, nationalism, racism, anti-Semitism) between “radically racist Nazis” and a broader swath of conservative Germans of different stripes allowed the former “to suck in vast numbers of allies.”23 Twelve years later, it allowed these very allies to recast themselves in a national conservative fashion. Shed of its most unsavory elements, such as genocidal anti-Semitism, many elements of the Nazi Weltanschauung remained salonfähig, now domesticated for consumption in the Federal Republic. There is, of course, anti-Communism and the barely deracialized reference to Asiatic hordes poised to overrun Western Europe; there is a more generalized xenophobia; there is the strong law-and-order approach; and there is a focus on community—no longer phrased in clearly racial terms as a Volksgemeinschaft but as a value-conservative, postdefeat, broadly Christian Schicksalsgemeinschaft (community of fate). And it was there to stay for many years to come. The volume is organized in three sections, each one looking at a particular type of recasting. Part 1 deals with war criminals and their postwar trials and interrogations. Daniel E. Rogers begins with an examination of Hans Globke, the most prominent among West German political figures and civil servants to have survived and prospered in the Federal Republic despite involvement in Nazi Germany’s anti-Semitic policies. In the Third Reich he had held the moderately high civil service rank of Ministerialrat in the Reich Ministry of the Interior; he coauthored a commentary on the Nuremberg race laws of 1935. Nonetheless, Globke served as Konrad Adenauer’s chief adviser and chief of staff from 1949 to 1963, although he did not achieve the title of Staatssekretär until 1953. During his long service by Adenauer’s side, Globke drew the fire of those who believed him an unacceptable holdover from the Nazi era. Rogers argues that a decisive factor in Globke’s resurgence was his willingness to testify at trials in Nuremberg in 1946 and 1948. The quality and quantity of his testimony created the image of a man who had nothing to hide about himself, even though he had been so close to the apparatus of mass murder that he knew of it early. In later years, Globke and his defenders therefore could assert truthfully that he had been checked thoroughly by the Allies, had revealed the full extent of his involvement with Nazi Germany’s anti-Semitic policies, and represented no danger to the fledgling liberal democracy being established in West Germany. Similarly, Katrin Paehler investigates Walter Schellenberg’s late-wartime and postwar attempts to fashion a usable past, a profitable future, and a worthwhile place in German\n\nand Allied history books out of the ashes of his career as the head of Heinrich Himmler’s intelligence service and as Himmler’s self-appointed foreign minister. Basing her analysis mainly on Schellenberg’s postwar interrogations by the Western Allies and on testimonies and writings about his career, role, and associations in Nazi Germany, she argues that Schellenberg took an unusual—and largely successful—tack in his defense. Rather than downplaying his role in Nazi Germany or disavowing his relationship with many members of Nazi Germany’s state and party hierarchy, Schellenberg attempted to use them to his advantage, as he cast himself as the ultimate insider, Western-leaning diplomat, and humanitarian thwarted in his attempt to bring peace. Thus, Schellenberg created a usable past for himself and, even if he was not able to make a future out of it, a narrative that still holds influence. To conclude the first section, Hilary Earl examines the postwar trial and subsequent life of Martin Sandberger, one of the fourteen Einsatzgruppen leaders originally sentenced to death in one of the twelve “subsequent” trials held in Nuremberg. Sandberger had been leader of Sonderkommando 1a, one of the four SS-Einsatzgruppen, or mobile killing units, that operated in the Baltic States between June 1941 and August 1943. The units under his command killed tens of thousands of people, if not more. Because of good timing and luck, Sandberger was released from prison in May 1958. From then on until his death in March 2010, he lived his life in anonymity, never speaking to anyone about what he had done during the war, that is until Walter Mayr, a Spiegel reporter, found him in an exclusive Stuttgart nursing home a month before he died. Mayr was surprised by the remarkable mental acuity of the elderly man who, at age ninety-nine, had the presence of mind to keep silent. How could one recast oneself after being found guilty? Sandberger, as one of the few individuals who served time among all the cases examined in this volume, offers an interesting perspective on how some of the most notorious SS leaders reintegrated back into German society after they were tried and sentenced. Having served his term “like a man” contributed much to Sandberger’s ability to reintegrate into society. The second section examines a variety of efforts through which networks of individuals came together to assist one another, either directly or indirectly, in the process of recasting. David A. Messenger begins by examining an unusual network: former Nazi intelligence agents and diplomats who remained in Spain after serving there in World War II. After the cessation of hostilities in Europe, the United States demanded that Spain, which remained a dictatorship after 1945, repatriate more than sixteen hundred of these individuals to occupied Germany, where they would face the usual denazification procedures. Spain was reluctant and agreed to do so only in certain cases and after a drawn-out process. As a result, these men, part of the well-connected German colony in Spain, took up their own defense. The language and arguments used by these exfunctionaries and agents of the Nazi regime in Spain offer a unique insight into the recasting of identities far from the center of denazification processes in occupied Germany. It shows how Nazi elites in Spain explained their wartime activity, drew on explanatory models germane to their environment, and made a claim for apolitical, economic, and activist futures in Franco’s Spain. Susanna Schraftstetter examines another network that gathered in North Rhine–\n\nWestphalia around Siegfried Zoglmann, who had been an official in the Hitler Youth and in the Office of the “Reichprotector” of Bohemia and Moravia as well as a member of the Waffen-SS. Zoglmann’s postwar career benefited from a network of Nazis from the Sudetenland in post-1945 West Germany. Active in the Witikobund, an ultra-right-wing organization of expellees, and in the Sudetendeutsche Landsmannschaft, Zogelmann and other former members of the Reichsjugendführung in the Sudetenland found their way into the North Rhine–Westphalian FDP (Freie Demokratische Partei). Schraftstetter examines to what extent this network helped in the denazification process and also provided Zoglmann and his colleagues a “spiritual home.” Thomas W. Maulucci looks at an even more united group of “recasters”: career diplomats in the German Foreign Ministry who had begun their service before 1933. Very quickly they developed a strategy that emphasized the differences between themselves as the core group of officials in the Auswärtiges Amt on the one hand and Nazi “outsiders” brought into the ministry on the other. The latter became convenient scapegoats for the Foreign Office’s activities during the Third Reich. Maulucci stresses that interned German diplomats interviewed by Allied authorities were developing this story—the idea of “two foreign offices” in existence during the Nazi era, which remained important for the Foreign Office’s self-image well into the 1970s—as early as mid-1945. The book’s second section, with its focus on the role of networks in the recasting process, is rounded out by Kerstin von Lingen’s examination of former Wehrmacht and SS officers who had served at the Italian front. A sharp distinction between the “clean Wehrmacht” on the one hand and the “dirty Nazi War” of the SS on the other framed the discourse among army veterans between 1945 and 1955. Affiliation with one group or the other, as defined by War Crimes Trials and denazification courts, divided the former comradesin-arms and became a determining factor in who was to receive a second chance in postwar West German society. In Italy, however, there was no visible divide between the two groups, in contrast to other theaters of war. Lingen explicates how personnel who had served in Italy insisted that the Italian war had been fair and decent and how, once evidence presented in court challenged this narrative, these men engaged in feverish behind-the-scenedebates and discussions about concepts such as military honor and service. The debates became particularly prevalent as war crimes trials got under way in Italy in the late 1940s and as movements for release began to appear in the 1950s. What emerges is a coordinated, scripted recasting meant to serve these men and whatever futures they sought for themselves. The final section of the volume considers a series of case studies in which the uniqueness of the individual defined the process of recasting. It draws attention to the underappreciated facts that there existed many, very different options for recasting one’s past in postwar Germany; that many met with considerable success; and that many audiences were receptive to them. In chapter 8, Florian Altenhöner investigates the unique case of Alfred Naujocks. Naujocks was a hit man, counterfeiter, agent, and terrorist who, on the last day of August 1939, led the raid on the Gleiwitz radio station, which Nazi propaganda used as a pretext for the German invasion of Poland. From 1934 to 1941 he was a high-ranking member of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) of the SS. By 1944 he headed\n\nthe German counterterrorism (Gegenterror) campaign in Denmark. In the following years, Naujocks was interrogated, served as a witness at the International Military Trial at Nuremberg, and was charged and sentenced for murder in Denmark. Released by the Danes, he returned to Germany in the 1950s. Upon his return, Naujocks did not remain silent about his past; rather, he became almost a mainstay in the German media. In West Germany, Naujocks was portrayed not as a Nazi perpetrator but rather as an adventurer. In East Germany, however, Naujocks was presented as a willing perpetrator. These different versions of Naujocks’s story, and his own role in managing the narrative in West Germany, provide much insight into the mind-set of the German public of the time and how they approached recasting and its proponents. Gerald Steinacher then considers the case of former SS officer Karl Nicolussi-Leck, who, like other former Nazis and SS members, transformed from a political actor to a seemingly apolitical businessman. Having voluntarily joined the Waffen-SS in 1940, Nicolussi-Leck served in the ranks of the Wiking Tank Division and was mainly deployed on the eastern front; for his service he received the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross in 1944. In 1947 the former SS-Hauptsturmführer was released from an American POW camp and returned to his home region of South Tyrol in northern Italy. There he initially worked as an escape agent for former Nazis and SS officers on their way to South America and the Middle East, developing close relationships with Argentine authorities in Italy. In 1948 he immigrated to Argentina, where he started a new career in private business. Together with former SS officer Horst Carlos Fuldner, he became involved in large projects of the Perón government and eventually began working for the German company Mannesmann. In the 1950s he returned to Europe and started a series of companies, most of which were affiliates of Mannesmann Germany, a company in which some of the key players were Leck’s erstwhile SS comrades, such as Paul Hafner. In Leck’s case, his SS connections thus served him twice. Elisabeth Kohlhaas’s study of Gertrud Slottke adds gender to the consideration of recasting. During the war, Slottke held a seemingly subaltern position with the Nazi occupation authority in the Netherlands but was, de facto, in charge of its Judenreferat, the Jewish Desk. After the war, Slottke—who originally hailed from Danzig—recast herself as a dual victim: her enthusiasm for Germany had been abused by “the Nazis” and her home had been destroyed and taken over by “the Russians.” She subsequently became active in refugee and expellee organizations. Having escaped responsibility for her wartime activities in the immediate postwar period—very few women were held responsible for their participation in Nazi crimes and, even if they were, punished for it rather than acquitted—her past caught up with her in the 1960s. Jointly with her former supervisors, she was brought to a much-noted trial at the Landgericht München in 1967 and sentenced to several years in prison. Slottke was thus one of the very few female former Gestapo employees who stood trial in the Federal Republic of Germany and whose recasting efforts—different from those of her male counterparts and largely related to her gender—eventually fell apart. Finally, Norman J. W. Goda considers Heinz Felfe, an SS officer from Dresden who became the head of West German Counterintelligence in 1955. Felfe was a key figure in\n\nthe Western intelligence establishment, having also worked on joint German-U.S. operations. But he was also a double agent; the KGB had already recruited him in 1951. In this position Felfe managed to wreck West German counterintelligence operations until his arrest in 1961. He also burned hundreds of agents working for West German and U.S. intelligence and caused incalculable damage to NATO intelligence operations. How a selfadmitted “ardent Nazi” secured important intelligence positions in the Soviet and West German intelligence establishments is symptomatic of the use of former Nazi officers by both East European and Western intelligence establishments and demonstrates the many constituencies that were willing to involve former Nazis in their own postwar enterprises —if they recast themselves according to the exigencies of the Cold War. Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the immediate postwar era: denazification, the postwar fates of Nazi Germany’s elites, and their impact on postwar German society and its discourses have attracted historians’ and the public’s attention. This book is located at the nexus of these three historiographical trends; through its individual chapters, it addresses some of their blind spots. It helps us to understand better the West German condition of a long postwar period.\n\nNotes 1.

Rogers Throughout Konrad Adenauer’s tenure as the first chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, between 1949 and 1963, Hans Globke remained at Adenauer’s side as his closest adviser, while the new chancellor built agencies, formulated policies, and reacted to challenges and crises. But during the first four years of that period, because of controversies surrounding Globke’s career during the Nazi era, Adenauer satisfied himself with giving Globke merely the reality, rather than also the title, of his closest adviser. Only after Adenauer won his first reelection in 1953 by a comfortable margin did he promote Globke to the office of Staatssekretär, analogous to the position of chief of staff in an American administration. Globke was the gatekeeper, paperwork manager, and chief adviser on process to the chancellor. With this promotion, Globke became the most prominent among West German political figures and civil servants to have survived and prospered in the Federal Republic despite involvement with Nazi Germany’s anti-Semitic policies. Even after withering and repeated attacks on Globke by opposition Social Democrats, journalists, and the East German Communist government, Globke held Adenauer’s confidence and made himself, deliberately or not, indispensable.1 The attacks on Globke were possible in the first instance because of Globke’s career path and actions during the Nazi era. Although a member of the Catholic Center Party when Hitler became chancellor, Globke continued as a bureaucrat in the Reich Ministry of the Interior, reaching the high midlevel rank of Ministerialrat. He worked in the department handling issues surrounding marital status. From 1935 until the end of the Nazi regime, his immediate supervisor was Wilhelm Stuckart, a Nazi Alter Kämpfer (old fighter) who had been a party member since before the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923. In 1936 Stuckart and Globke coauthored a commentary on the Nuremberg race laws of the previous year. While the legal community might have been more widely aware of Stuckart because of the commentary, Stuckart’s later, historical infamy stemmed largely from his attendance at the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, where he represented the Interior Ministry at a meeting called to settle procedural, jurisdictional, and legal questions hindering the speedy mass murder of Europe’s Jews.2 Captured by the Allies in 1945, Stuckart was ultimately placed on trial in the Wilhelmstrasse, or Ministries, case from 1947 to 1949. He was charged, among other offenses, with crimes against humanity. In August 1948, Globke was called to testify at Nuremberg—unusually, he was a witness for both the prosecution and the defense (not merely called by one side and crossexamined by the other).3 It was not the first evidence Globke offered in a war crimes trial. He provided written testimony at the most famous trial of all, the International Military\n\nTribunal in 1946, by submitting an affidavit concerning the annexation of French territories after the German victory there in 1940.4 His testimony concerning the two men who had been minister of the interior in the Nazi era was not needed. There was enough evidence from other sources that Wilhelm Frick, who had been the minister until 1943, had participated in mass murder; at Nuremberg he was convicted and hanged. The second minister of the interior after 1943, Heinrich Himmler, had killed himself in May 1945. Thus Globke’s main opportunity to testify fully did not come until August 1948, in the trial of his former boss, Stuckart. The quality and quantity of the testimony Globke provided revealed a witness who had nothing to hide about himself, even though he was so close to the apparatus of mass murder that he had known of it early. In the Wilhelmstrasse trial, Globke was given a rare chance, because he was not accused of any crime himself, to fully air his side of the story under oath and in a forum presumably very hostile to Nazis. Globke’s testimony was open, expansive, and usually free of defensiveness. Anyone poring over the trial transcripts looking for evidence to use against Globke during the later attacks on him would not find a man who hid or evaded, but rather one who quickly admitted that he knew of mass murder without having participated in it or having been able to affect its course. Moreover, and most decisively of all for himself and his former superior, Stuckart, Globke portrayed Stuckart as a very rare bird indeed: a Nazi with a humane side and tolerance for dissent among his subordinates. That Stuckart was found guilty in 1949 but sentenced only to time already served may have owed much to how Globke portrayed Stuckart’s leadership of his department and his role within the Interior Ministry and the Nazi Party. Globke’s testimony at Nuremberg was thus consistent with previous and later assertions about his level of involvement or noninvolvement with Nazi anti-Semitic policies and practices. If his meteoric rise from Allied internee in 1945 to the chancellor’s most valuable aide by 1949 is to be fully understood, along with his survival for fourteen years thereafter despite frequent attacks, his testimony should be credited with fortifying his image as a careful and truthful civil servant who did the best he could under the stress of the time. An analysis of Globke’s testimony reveals four distinct areas in which he could demonstrate his candor while also mitigating his personal culpability for crimes against Jews: Stuckart’s relatively benign character, Globke’s bureaucratic resistance to Nazi racial oppression, Globke’s knowledge of the Holocaust as it was under way, and the reasons Globke stayed at his job even though it was so close to mass murder and persecution. In each of these four aspects of his testimony, Globke laid the groundwork for a future career at the highest levels of West German politics. He was able to build upon this benign portrayal of his Nazi years to recast his identity and provide his boss, Adenauer, with ammunition to use in his defense.5 First, in his testimony, Globke cast Stuckart in a generally highly positive light. On one level, Globke’s self-interest required such testimony, regardless of how Stuckart had behaved in the Nazi era. For Globke, much depended on the outcome of Stuckart’s trial. If Globke, via a guilty verdict for Stuckart, had been found to have been working for a mass murderer, Globke’s future would have been bleak. Thus, while at the time of Stuckart’s trial, Globke had no idea he would ever be more than a local government official in\n\nAachen, one must take into account a certain self-interest in portraying Stuckart mildly.6 Despite recognizing that Stuckart was a “convinced National Socialist” and even enjoyed wearing his SS uniform, Globke pictured the defendant as a moderate or even kindly Nazi.7 The likelihood that Globke himself did anything reprehensible while working for the kind of boss he portrayed on the witness stand remained low indeed.8 If Globke had served such a man, his activities during the Third Reich could have easily remained noncriminal. As portrayed by his former subordinate on the witness stand, Stuckart believed it essential that the law exist independently of its political context, that Germany, even the Nazi Germany he had helped create, be a Rechtsstaat, a government of laws. Stuckart resisted some measures he regarded as arbitrary and cruel.9 Globke provided specific, albeit limited, examples of cases in which Stuckart intervened to assist certain so-called half Jews10 and even so-called full Jews: “Through the measures prepared and issued by Department 1 numerous people, among which there were full Jews, ahd [sic] been spared the treatment as Jews and … they owed their lives to Department 1 under the leadership of Stuckart.”11 According to Globke, Stuckart did not totally support the Nazi Party’s measures toward either full Jews or less-than-full Jews and frequently subverted the wishes of the party chancellery on Jewish questions.12 Stuckart believed that “mixed race” individuals should be absorbed into the entirety of the German people and not excluded, much less eliminated.13 If necessary, he favored sterilizing the “mixed race” rather than more extreme measures such as deportation or murder.14 Not only did Stuckart object to the most extreme policies toward those considered less than fully Jewish; he and his department also interceded to save the lives of “numerous” people, Globke alleged from the witness stand.15 His attitudes as a boss made him tolerant of a regime critic in his midst, namely Globke, who was not silenced when he uttered criticisms of the party or the regime in Stuckart’s presence.16 And Globke could make himself look like a daring anti-Nazi while testifying that it was only Stuckart’s intervention with security services (RSHA) leader Ernst Kaltenbrunner that allowed Globke to escape arrest after the July 20, 1944, assassination plot against Hitler: After the 20th of July and as a result of my participation in the attempted revolution, Kaltenbrunner wanted to have me arrested. Subsequently, Kettner, who was Stuckart’s adjutant, told me that Stuckart went to Kaltenbrunner and he told him if he was able to introduce evidence against me, in that case, of course he had to arrest me, but if it was only a question of suspicion against me, he was to abstain from undertaking any arrest, and Kaltenbrunner, for the time being, adhered to this, at first at least, and the arrest warrant was issued subsequently only but could no longer be put into actual effect when it was issued because the Gestapo officials who were charged to carry out the arrest, in view of the approach of the Americans, were compelled to recede.17 Furthermore, Stuckart was openly critical of the party’s radical claims in front of Globke\n\nand other subordinates and had clearly expressed, for instance, his opposition to the violence of November 1938, Kristallnacht.18 Stuckart’s frequent opposition to party initiatives led to bureaucratic infighting of the highest order, at least for Nazi Germany: Globke recalled that Stuckart asked him to participate in investigations of a rumored Jewish ancestry of RSHA chief Reinhard Heydrich, not because Stuckart especially hated Jews, but to try to undermine Heydrich’s radical leadership of anti-Jewish policies.19 Stuckart’s opposition to including those considered less than full Jews in the most extreme measures of discrimination and violence earned him the suspicion and enmity of certain party and SS officials.20 He might have tried to placate them by acting tough in meetings, but when back among his colleagues, he acted moderately and sometimes subversively.21 Globke believed that Heinrich Himmler, who assumed the role of Stuckart’s superior as minister of the interior in 1943, shunned Stuckart and would not often take his phone calls. Globke also estimated that Stuckart probably was in Hitler’s presence only about ten times in total and thus had no influence at the highest level of all.22 In short, he was no SS insider, despite his honorary SS rank and the uniform he liked to wear.23 Second, Globke elaborated a theory of successful bureaucratic obstruction in the Third Reich, of which he and Stuckart had been a part. Globke could truthfully state that he had never been a member of the Nazi Party, while keeping quiet about the fact that in 1940 he had applied for membership and had been rejected.24 Instead of being a party member, he asserted, he had participated for years in the resistance movement.25 On the stand at Stuckart’s trial, there were ample opportunities for Globke to portray his service in the Interior Ministry as helping Jews rather than hurting them. For instance, in 1935, when some courts had been following the Nazi spirit rather than the letter of the law by refusing to marry “Aryans” and Jews, Globke had, he testified, attempted unsuccessfully to intervene with the Justice Ministry. He sought to have the Justice Ministry remind the courts of the law. Before that effort could have borne fruit, though, the Nuremberg Laws were issued, flatly forbidding “interracial” marriages.26 As Globke saw it, those such as himself who wished to hinder Nazi racism in general, or like Stuckart, who desired to block merely some isolated policies, could only succeed if they could articulate some danger to Germans at large or to the regime. Appeal to the letter of the law or humanitarian objections always led to a strengthening of party resolve to push through the most radically oppressive measures.27 As a specific example, Globke offered Stuckart’s opposition to Heydrich’s efforts to treat so-called full and half Jews the same—in other words, to subject to deportation and death all those with two or more grandparents who were deemed fully Jewish. The only chance to block party zealots was to discuss the disadvantages to Germany as a whole, not to argue for the humane treatment of anyone.28 Globke offered another important example of his bureaucratic resistance, this time concerning regulations requiring Jews to add the forenames “Israel” or “Sara.” In 1938, Stuckart’s department had been confronted with party demands, specifically from Martin Bormann, chief of staff to the deputy Führer, that all Jews be forced to identify themselves\n\nwith the mandatory last name of “Yid” (“Jüdd” or “Itzig” in German).29 At first, with Stuckart’s approval, Globke attempted to circumvent the party demand through the timetested technique of bureaucratic inaction.30 When the party and Minister of the Interior Frick insisted anyway, Globke and his colleague Hermann Hering suggested a compromise that would lessen the impact: requiring Jews to identify themselves with an additional forename. Globke asserted that this was a milder solution, although Jews who never knew of the debates behind the scenes regarded the change to forenames as a harsh and humiliating new policy, for which Globke would often be criticized later in his life.31 Knowing that if the Interior Ministry did nothing, the proposal might reach Hitler, who always agreed to the most radical proposal, Globke believed his had been a milder and therefore better policy for Jews: “It was generally known within the Ministry of the Interior that Hitler, in all basic questions as far as Jews were concerned, always agreed to the more intensified measure. As a consequence of this, one had to try to deal with the matter without a final decision on the part of Hitler and achieve the best possible result and [Bern-hard] Loesner [sic] always again and again tried to do this and in that he had the full support of Stuckart.”32 The trial allowed Globke to enter this perspective into the record, which later gave him and his defenders evidence to support a more benign take on his involvement in the namechange policy. Perhaps the most difficult thing for Globke to try to explain away, both during the trial and later during his revived career, was his 1936 coauthorship with Stuckart of a commentary on the Nuremberg Laws.33 Nazified courts would use Stuckart and Globke’s commentary (and three others) to help them apply the Nuremberg Laws to individual cases. Globke and his defenders would often argue that his and Stuckart’s commentary was the mildest of the four.34 Regardless, Globke’s name was on the title page of an instrument of persecution, and he had earned at least modest royalties from it. Yet here as well, Globke would cast his work as benefiting Jews if one understood the full context of the times, as an act of hidden bureaucratic obstruction. When the prosecution asked him about Stuckart’s racist introduction to the commentary, Globke’s immediate response, which earned him an admonishment from the prosecutor, was a rare display of defensiveness. He tried to explain his motives for helping to write the commentary rather than addressing the query about Stuckart’s words that had been posed to him: Q: Didn’t Stuckart in this preface vigorously endorse the racial ideology of Hitler, quoting “Mein Kampf” again and again? A: That is true. I was sorry to read that preface, but since I considered the purpose of the commentary to help wherever possible those discriminated against, we had to put up with this preface if the National Socialist authorities were to get by this commentary [sic] at all. Q: I’m not asking about you, Dr. Globke, but only about Stuckart.35 Third, Globke admitted knowledge about the mass murder of Jews without being compelled by his questioners. Stuckart’s trial gave him the opportunity to place on the record, under oath and before a hostile cross-examiner, statements about his knowledge of\n\nthe mass murders of the Holocaust. But he set what he felt were important limits to his knowledge that would free him from any self-incrimination regarding the genocide. Globke denied ever hearing of the Wannsee Conference directly from Stuckart, who had been in attendance (and who has, in subsequent cinematic renditions of the conference, been made to look like the only mildly good guy in attendance).36 He further denied ever discussing the murder of the Jews directly with Stuckart.37 Yet Globke did immediately admit that he came to learn about the systematic mass murders of Jews. He asserted that he only heard the term Final Solution after the war38 but learned during the war of the mass murders themselves. This knowledge came from informal discussions in official circles and from returning soldiers, not because policies or official directives were passing through his department.39 When Stuckart’s defense counsel, Curt von Stackelberg, offered him a chance to downplay his level of knowledge about the killings, Globke did not take it: I have just told you I did not know the “final solution of the Jewish question” as a terminus technicus until after the capitulation. Consequently, although the expression “final solution of the Jewish question” might have been used, I never took it to mean the physical extermination of all Jews. I knew that Jews were being killed in large numbers, and I was always of the opinion that there were Jews who were not killed, who were still living in Germany or in Theresienstadt or elsewhere, in a sort of Ghetto. You thought that there were excesses but no systematic extermination? No, I don’t want to say that. I am of the opinion—and I knew that at the time— that the extermination of the Jews was carried on systematically, but I did not know that it was supposed to apply to all Jews.40 Globke also denied ever having seen the infamous Einsatzgruppen (mobile killing squads) reports that had recounted in exact detail the murders of Jews inside the Soviet Union in 1941.41 Yet, he acknowledged without any hesitation his knowledge of plans and procedures to kill the disabled among the German “Aryan” populace. He knew, he testified, of plans to kill those “no longer worthy of life.”42 Likewise, he asserted that he was aware that the interior minister who supervised Stuckart and himself, Wilhelm Frick, was responsible for killing the “mentally insane.”43 Fourth and finally, Globke provided for himself the beginnings of a consistent story as to why he had remained behind at his job in the midst of such horror, why he had not resigned: In Department 1 it was possible to help many people who had been discriminated against by National Socialist methods and this actually happened in numerous cases. I had, all the same, the intention every now and then to leave the Ministry of the Interior voluntarily, especially when Himmler took over the leadership of this ministry. The reason, I remained in office, was that my friends in the resistance movement, the Bishop of Berlin and others, requested me and urged me to disregard my own personal interests and to remain in office, because if I left, their\n\nlast source of information about the Ministry of the Interior would vanish and thus the last possibility to gain an insight into their plans. It was comparatively easy for me to make up my mind in their direction because I was convinced that Dr. Stuckart would not request me to do anything which was against my conscience or would never request me to do any punishable act. And finally, after all, what more could I have done in the Third Reich than participate in a conspiracy for years, an activity which had as its ultimate aim the killing of Hitler.44 While Adenauer’s and Globke’s political opponents argued that Globke could have done less, rather than more (namely, by not writing the commentary or participating in the renaming regulations for Jews), Globke was providing himself and his later defenders with a line of argumentation that proved daunting, not the least because it may well also have been correct. As Adenauer’s Christian Democratic Union deliberately and successfully courted the support of millions of Germans who had gone along with the Nazis (the socalled Mitläufer), having a man at his side who had advanced his career during those years while keeping himself free of personal guilt proved to be no political hindrance.45 It gave the domestic opposition and many abroad something to complain about or lament, yet Adenauer ultimately served as chancellor longer than Hitler. Globke, of course, was by Adenauer’s side the entire time. With an exculpatory version of his past documented under oath before an American military tribunal, Globke had helped himself rise high long before he knew he would ever have the chance. In that Nuremberg courtroom in August 1948, Globke could hardly have dreamed that only a year later he would be one of the closest aides of the newly elected federal chancellor. Rather than deliberately furnishing the court with a version of his and Stuckart’s pasts that would enable total rehabilitation, it is more likely that Globke was framing his experiences in the most helpful way possible so that his future would be less hindered. Having already successfully emerged from his own denazification process the year before as unbelastet (cleared), Globke need not have worried that he would be worse off than any other German who had lived through the Nazi regime as an adult.46 It was, instead, a question of his suitability for a career like the one he had been building during the Weimar Republic, in the highest reaches of the Prussian civil service. An extended network of mutual connections brought him to Adenauer’s attention in the late 1940s.47 Yet it was Globke’s careful, self-exculpatory, and unrefuted testimony at the trial of Wilhelm Stuckart that allowed him to put down in that most weighty of all public records, the transcript of a war crimes trial, a version of his life that made his astounding rise and extended tenure possible.\n\nNotes 1.

The pithy phrase provides a telling coda to Schellenberg’s almost decade-long effort to remake himself from Himmler’s spymaster, closely connected to the highest rungs of party and state and many of Nazi Germany’s key projects of racial and political surveillance and policing, into a well-meaning and daring German diplomat with strong Western leanings, a cosmopolitan outlook, and a proven humanitarian track record. When Schellenberg wrote about his “services” no longer being required—clearly implying that he would have been all too happy to render them again—he was already a very sick man. He did not live to see the eventual publication of his memoir.2 He had begun crafting the narrative and its main tenets much earlier, and while it did not gain for him a role in postwar diplomacy or intelligence, Schellenberg managed to fashion a usable past that helped him evade many of the potential consequences of his earlier activities. And with the posthumous publication of his memoir, hailed in Alan Bullock’s introduction to the English version as “a piece of historical evidence, for none of those who have so far published their memoirs of this period were in a good position to know and to have seen at first hand what took place at the center of power,” Schellenberg’s recast identity and the narrative connected with it took on tremendous staying power. To be sure, Bullock cautions his readers, noting that it “would [not] be wise to accept Schellenberg as a trustworthy witness where his evidence cannot be corroborated. Naturally enough he presents his own part in these events in as favorable a light as possible and often with some exaggeration of his own importance.”3 In reality, though, Schellenberg’s memoir has taken on an oft-uncontested life of its own in historical writing, especially when it comes to Nazi Germany’s foreign intelligence efforts and to the very last months and weeks of the war. His recast identity looms large.\n\nWalter Schellenberg. Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Alber-178-04A. Schellenberg’s recasting of his professional history is a fascinating case study. Recent years have seen a growing interest in those functionaries of the Third Reich who rose to prominence and influential positions in postwar West Germany.4 This interest is by no means abating but rather has shifted from the specific facts of individual cases to the processes and sometimes networks through which these men (and few women) created more usable pasts for themselves. How did they make sense of their pasts and disassociate themselves from the roles they had played in Nazi Germany? While there surely existed many different strategies, some common approaches are clearly discernible: one focused on alleged fundamental differences with Nazi ideology; another one disavowed or minimized the role(s) a person had played in Nazi Germany; and a third one (over)emphasized real and imagined dangers into which an individual’s “dissidence” had put him. But most who were successful in recasting their identities had not been notorious in the most obvious senses: they had not been directly and visibly connected to the highest rungs of the party elite; they had not been directly involved in the planning of World War II; and they had no direct, “hands-on” involvement with the Holocaust or with the persecution of Nazi Germany’s political enemies. They were mostly members of the “expertocracy,” and as such, they had remained largely invisible to the public eye.5 In a postwar society neither inclined nor truly able to confront the Nazi era, their comparative\n\nlack of apparent guilt oftentimes paved their way into postwar futures of considerable influence.6 Schellenberg—a party man, SS and SD member, spymaster, and closely associated with a good number of the postwar bêtes noires of Nazi Germany, for example, Himmler, Reinhard Heydrich, and Ernst Kaltenbrunner—took a different, seemingly counterintuitive, and most certainly audacious tack in recasting his past. Rather than disavowing his role in Nazi Germany, Schellenberg created a coherent narrative around three images of himself: the ultimate insider, the cosmopolitan diplomat, and the humanitarian and thwarted bringer of peace. He proffered these images in a constant and stable narrative. It was laid out in writing before his transfer into Allied custody, reinforced during his interrogations, and expanded upon in his memoir. In other words, Schellenberg entered Allied custody with a coherent narrative as his proverbial calling card and stayed on message thereafter. Tripping him off became difficult and increasingly undesirable, because Schellenberg’s persona as the ultimate insider established him as a fountain of seemingly valuable information to the Allies; in the process, he helped to shape and to reinforce Allied perceptions about Nazi Germany and its main players. Schellenberg’s gamble almost paid off. His efforts likely helped him to secure a lighter sentence in Nuremberg and, most certainly, a better postwar image than he deserved. It is anyone’s guess what would have happened had he lived longer: after interrogating him at length, the Allies were decidedly unimpressed. However, as a relentless self-promoter and good storyteller, Schellenberg might have been able to secure his professional or economic well-being after all; he did not perceive himself as made for obscurity. Lastly, professional historians have quite frequently all too readily accepted Schellenberg’s self-serving renditions of events. This holds true in particular when it comes to information about the last months and weeks of the war, when there are comparatively fewer contemporaneous documents. In short: Schellenberg’s narratives, meant to recast his own role in Nazi Germany, hold sway over important swaths of history.7 For that reason alone, tracing the process through which Schellenberg remade himself is an important undertaking. Born in Saarbrücken in 1910, Walter Schellenberg studied law at the universities of Marburg and Bonn.8 He passed his first exam in 1933, roughly around the same time that Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor. He joined the NSDAP and the SS in 1933 and became involved with the SD shortly thereafter. Over the course of the next six years, Schellenberg carved out a position for himself in the new state’s administrative and policing universe. Traditionally trained in law, Schellenberg was clearly an asset for Reinhard Heydrich and a fledging SD that was trying to secure and to define its role. Between 1938 and the summer of 1941, Nazi Germany began to move even more aggressively against perceived domestic racial and political enemies and also began its assault on the neighboring states; in a sense, the state moved from ideological theory to the theory’s—sometimes pragmatic—praxis. Schellenberg’s professional trajectory mirrored these developments. He remade himself from a talented bureaucrat—he was intimately involved in the negotiations about the deployment of the Einsatzgruppen as designated killing units in the upcoming attack against the Soviet Union—into a\n\ntheoretician of intelligence and policing. After a stint with the Gestapo’s Counterintelligence Department, he was appointed acting head of Nazi Germany’s political foreign intelligence service, Office VI of the RSHA, in 1941. Conducting foreign intelligence under the conditions of a global war was an uphill battle at best, especially as political foreign intelligence remained a poorly defined concept. Schellenberg’s office found itself in intramural fights with the military intelligence service, the Abwehr under Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, and the Auswärtige Amt under Joachim von Ribbentrop. Schellenberg proved yet again to be an excellent technocrat of power: he managed to take over the better part of the Abwehr in 1943–1944 but was less successful in his attempts to dispose of Ribbentrop as the foreign minister. But he did established himself as Himmler’s main adviser in all matters related to foreign policy, readying Office VI to become Himmler’s foreign office with himself at the helm. In this context Schellenberg established contacts with a number of Swedish and Swiss nationals. Ultimately, these contacts assisted Schellenberg in his attempts to sound out for Himmler the possibilities for a separate peace with the Western Allies—an option that also included the distinct possibility of breaking up the anti-Hitler alliance and gaining for Germany a new lease on life. To open up these lines to the West, Schellenberg in 1944 and 1945 used Scandinavian and Jewish concentration camp inmates as bargaining chips. Over the course of these negotiations, especially with Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden but also with the former president of Switzerland, Jean-Marie Musy, and while Nazi Germany was collapsing, a substantial number of people were freed and transported to safety.9 And in late April 1945, Schellenberg did, indeed, persuade Himmler to offer surrender to the Western Allies via the Swedish intermediaries. The offer was rejected, because it did not extend to all members of the anti-Hitler alliance. Schellenberg subsequently parlayed his involvement with Bernadotte into an assignment given to him by the new German leader Admiral Karl Dönitz that made travel to Sweden possible. Thus, the end of the war found Schellenberg on one of Bernadotte’s properties outside of Stockholm and out of the immediate reach of the victorious Allies. In neutral Sweden Schellenberg crafted his basic narrative: a thirty-seven-page piece that was soon aptly entitled “Brigadeführer Schellenberg, Amtschef VI, Autobiography Compiled during His Stay in Stockholm, June 1945.”10 Schellenberg wrote it under the protection and sometimes on the properties of Bernadotte or of people close to the Swedish count.11 According to Schellenberg, it was Bernadotte who persuaded him to write down “the events leading up to the capitulation” while his memory was still fresh, noting “that a work of this kind would be difficult to produce later if it were nec essary to depend upon memory for the chronological sequence of events.” Bored by “his forced inactivity” and able to make use of the recollections of his assistant Franz Göring, who had played an important role in the liberation of numerous concentration camp inmates, and his longtime secretary Marie-Luise Schienke, who were with him in Sweden, Schellenberg began to dictate what he remembered to Schienke. Though the endeavor was initially planned as the outline for a book, Schellenberg claimed to have soon settled on “a short autobiographical summary of events,” especially when he “saw the necessity of voluntarily surrendering to the Americans or the British.”12 Indubitably, such a summary\n\nof events would come handy under those circumstances. Schellenberg subtly suggested that neither the idea for the piece nor its ultimate format originated with him. The former was Bernadotte’s suggestion and the latter due to his realization that voluntary surrender would be the best step to take. The implication was that Schellenberg had little reason either to be concerned about his past or to be exceedingly proactive about his future. In reality, he was clearly both and had found a perfect format to address these concerns in his autobiographical sketch. Nine-tenths of the text deals with Schellenberg’s good deeds in the last months of the war, which he depicted as the logical outcome of his beliefs and earlier activities. Schellenberg did not write this autobiographical sketch, the proverbial Urfaust of his defense, in a vacuum. Either shortly before Schellenberg began writing it or concurrently, Bernadotte embarked on a similar project. His book The Fall of the Curtain: Last Days of the Third Reich was published in London in 1945.13 Bernadotte’s thin book included passages authored by Schellenberg and clearly identified as such, yet it seems that the inclusion of these passages, as well as Bernadotte’s overall fairly positive evaluation of Schellenberg and his activities, led to the persistent claim that The Fall of the Curtain was, indeed, ghostwritten by Schellenberg. These claims, lacking in solid evidentiary support, have largely been debunked. However, it seems extremely likely and only natural that the two men, who spent much time together, discussed their respective writing projects or, as Doerries put it, their reading of “events and appraisals of people.”14 This was clearly a writers’ collective of contaminating closeness, for it is reasonable to conclude that Schellenberg and Bernadotte smoothed out seemingly minor discrepancies that might have existed. Conversely, though, it is likely that Bernadotte’s plan to publish his recollections reined in most inclinations to overreach that Schellenberg might have entertained. He needed Bernadotte, his contacts, and his influence; there was nothing to be gained from contradicting or alienating the Swede. Relationships worked differently in the case of his assistant Franz Göring, whom Schellenberg asked “to write an eye witness account, in order to supplement and confirm certain parts of his story.” It is reasonable to assume that Göring took very seriously the implications of Schellenberg’s request when he wrote his account, which he claimed to be an extract from his diary.15 Göring had several reasons to hitch his horse to Schellenberg’s wagon: for one, Göring was safe and sound in neutral Sweden in the company of his fiancée, Schienke. Second, his role in Schellenberg’s humanitarian activities would help Göring with any questions that might arise in the future about his own record. The better his boss did, the better the outcome would be for Göring as well. This is not to suggest that the three accounts were sanitized beyond recognition, but they did not emerge in a vacuum. The “Autobiography” was Schellenberg’s first attempt to control the narrative. He crafted a coherent story that could be confirmed in a seemingly independent fashion: by checking it against the accounts by Bernadotte and Göring, two of the other main players in the events in question. Few people, then and now, were or are aware of the context in which these three pieces came to be. The “Autobiography” proved a success—in Sweden and beyond. Schellenberg gave copies of it to a number of prominent and influential Swedes.16 In late May, Schellenberg,\n\nably assisted by Bernadotte, began to negotiate his transfer into American custody. The negotiations were fairly protracted and did not work out exactly as Schellenberg had hoped, for he was to be taken to London after a short time in Frankfurt.17 When Schellenberg boarded his plane for Frankfurt on June 17, 1945—after almost six weeks in Sweden—the American Assistant Military Attaché Charles E. Rayens, who had negotiated the transfer and seemed reasonably taken by the German, was with him. Also on board was Bernadotte, who was willing to vouch for him and who wanted to ensure that all went well. Schellenberg carried his calling card: additional copies of his “Autobiography.” He had pulled off the almost impossible, for he had morphed into his own character witness. In the following months, Schellenberg was interrogated intensely, at least most of the time. Upon his arrival in Frankfurt and registration at SHAEF, he was initially stashed away in one or several local safe houses. Doerries notes with surprise that Schellenberg was not transferred to one of the two main Allied detention centers for Nazi bigwigs, which were the sites of interrogations about the structure and nature of Nazi Germany.18 Since Schellenberg had been the head of Nazi Germany’s foreign intelligence service, it only made sense, though, to have him interrogated separately and exclusively by members of the Allied intelligence services. And the war in the Far East was not over yet. In his initial talk with Rayens in Sweden, Schellenberg had tried to capitalize on American concerns and made intimations that Rayens could not ignore in good faith, for he reported that “Schellenberg believed that his Japanese section, personnel, specialists and records, could be assembled for the benefit of our army.”19 Schellenberg was selling the mirage of an omnipotent spymaster with global assets. The interrogations began ten days after Schellenberg’s arrival in Frankfurt and involved a number of British and American intelligence officials.20 Their findings were summarized in a lengthy report. Doerries describes the report as “not overly impressive in analysis and conclusion but densely packed with information and data gathered in the obviously rewarding sessions with Schellenberg.”21 Schellenberg was a fountain of information and “entirely cooperative and … particularly willing to denounce Kaltenbrunner.”22 On July 7, 1945, Schellenberg was flown to London for further interrogations.23 He was immediately transferred to Camp 020, an internment center theoretically under the oversight of the British Home Office but practically run by MI5, the domestic branch of the British Intelligence Service. Over the course of the war, the interrogation of suspected spies and others had been made into an art form in this facility. Interrogators made ample use of psychological intimidation and sensory deprivation; recent research also provides strong circumstantial evidence that some prisoners were tortured. In addition, interrogators used the mystique of the omnipotent British Secret Service to their advantage.24 For Schellenberg, Camp 020 was a rude awakening. Prominent Swedes had handled him with utmost care, Rayens had afforded him quite a bit of consideration, and it appears that the interrogations in Frankfurt conformed to Schellenberg’s expectations. Camp 020 did not. Schellenberg, described by the camp commandant as a “priggish little dandy, fetched up rakishly,” was “shocked by his stern reception and sulked peevishly until he was brought face to face with the reality of British contempt for him and his evil works.”25 While there is no indication that Schellenberg was tortured, he was treated more poorly than he\n\nexpected. He clearly did not appreciate the “light, being hollered at, [or] cold water baths,” and he noted that he had been “finished.” After eight weeks in a dark cell, he had been ready to kill himself but did not find the opportunity to do so. Or so he claimed in a later exchange with R. W. M. Kempner.26 As a witness, Schellenberg was as loquacious and eager as ever. Nothing suggests that his interrogators had to “force [information] out of him.”27 From the first (Frankfurt) interrogation on, it was clear that Schellenberg would talk—and talk he did. The interrogation then formed the basis for the “Final Report on the Case of Walter Friedrich Schellenberg,” a detailed summary report of more than 120 pages and twenty-three sometimes extensive appendixes on various topics.28 The “Final Report” was not the Allies’ last word on Schellenberg, but it came close. It is of central importance, for it established a core understanding of Schellenberg, his activities, and his role in Nazi Germany. The interrogations in London were driven by two main motivations: the wish to understand the man and his service—both of which had been shrouded in mystery and had been sources of anxiety among Western intelligence agencies—and the need to arrest developing security threats, such as postdefeat networks. As such, they sated the immediate interest of the intelligence communities. However, the realities these interrogations unveiled turned out to be an exasperating letdown.29 Neither Schellenberg nor the service he led lived up to Allied expectations. Schellenberg was transferred to Nuremberg in early November 1945, where the International Military Tribunal was about to get under way. Amt VI had turned out to be largely a mirage and far from a security threat, but Schellenberg had come to be known as a fountain of information. Slated as a witness for the prosecution, he was further interrogated in view of the upcoming trial. It is a fair assumption that the new surroundings agreed with Schellenberg. For one, he had been trained in law and thus was in his element. His role as a witness also allowed him to flaunt his knowledge of the inner workings of Nazi Germany and its leading personalities. In addition, it gave him an opportunity to settle some scores and to hone his persona as a friend of the West.30 “The best thing Schellenberg had going for him after the war was that he had developed the right internal enemies,” Richard Breitman quips shrewdly and very truly.31 They included Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the last head of the RSHA and thus Schellenberg’s superior; Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop; the head of Office IV (Gestapo) Heinrich Müller; and sabotage expert Otto Skorzeny. These men counterbalanced nicely Schellenberg’s “wrong friends,” a category in which Heydrich and Himmler took pride of place. Schellenberg was able to exploit his enmity with Kaltenbrunner to the fullest—there was no love lost between the two men, a fact well known at Camp 020 and apparently a source of amusement—and to use their antagonistic relationship to recast his own past.32 The Allies, for their part, regarded the enigmatic Kaltenbrunner as particularly unsavory, and after Himmler’s suicide, he was the highest-ranking member of the RSHA in Allied hands. His name connected to the much feared, yet largely imaginary “alpine redoubt,” Kaltenbrunner was considered a security threat and a potential postwar player.33 He also fit\n\nthe image of the proverbial ugly German, down to his dueling scars, which was a nice visual bonus for the upcoming trial. Schellenberg expertly delivered on Allied expectations. Schellenberg’s “Autobiography” focused on the last few months of the war, and it presented Kaltenbrunner as the tale’s main villain—his relationship with Kaltenbrunner had long before shifted from general cooperation to outright conflict. Schellenberg left little doubt that it was the head of the RSHA who obstructed his efforts to make contact and negotiate with the Western powers and to free concentration camp inmates. Yet Schellenberg’s narrative goes even further: he notes that even Himmler feared the head of the RSHA, since Kaltenbrunner was close to Hitler, subtly implying that Kaltenbrunner might have held influence over Hitler. In effect, the “Autobiography” created two competing centers of power, a dichotomy of good and evil, of reasonable and unreasonable: the former consisted of Himmler and Schellenberg, while the latter comprised Hitler and Kaltenbrunner. In Schellenberg’s narrative, Kaltenbrunner is the man who reproached him for supporting too strongly Count Bernadotte’s plans to move Scandinavian concentration camp inmates out of the collapsing Germany; who issued orders in Himmler’s name that had not originated with the RFSS; who did not comply with orders coming from Himmler; and who “got Hitler to stop any further trains [of freed Jews] to Switzerland.”34 Whatever went wrong with Schellenberg’s plans, the blame was Kaltenbrunner’s. Schellenberg portrayed Kaltenbrunner as an outright dangerous man on two different yet interconnected levels. On the one hand, his eagerness to harm Schellenberg presented an immediate and personal danger to the latter; on the other hand, Kaltenbrunner’s proximity to Hitler and his alleged influence with or over the Führer made him dangerous in a broader sense. Schellenberg set the stage for this story line in the opening pages of his “Autobiography,” noting that in late 1942 and early 1943, “Hitler and later Himmler” wanted “to imprison me and my associates in a concentration camp for defeatism.” The alleged reason was an intelligence report on Russia, and the instigator was Kaltenbrunner. There is no independent confirmation of this threat against Schellenberg, but he very skillfully created the impression of a man under siege. Himmler, who had taken a “personal liking” to Schellenberg, became his shield. In the world that Schellenberg created in his “Autobiography,” Himmler was the voice of reason; with him, Schellenberg said, “[I] could always be sure that I myself and my work would always be judged by ‘non-party-political’ standards.”35 In other words, in a political system in which an intelligence report could lead to accusations of defeatism and in which a man like Kaltenbrunner held power, Himmler became a beacon of nonideological common sense and a natural ally to a man like Schellenberg. In the broader sense, Kaltenbrunner’s influence with and proximity to Hitler made him dangerous. Kaltenbrunner “got Hitler to stop any further trains [of camp inmates as part of the negotiations with Musy] to Switzerland,” and Hitler then “forbade any German, under threat of death, to help not only one Jew more, but interestingly enough also any American or English P.O.W.” In a roundabout way, Schellenberg experienced Kaltenbrunner’s\n\ninfluence in his own interactions with Himmler, for Himmler coveted and clamored for Hitler’s approval. In early April 1945, for example, Schellenberg and Musy struck upon the idea of a four-day truce “on land and in the air, in order to use this time to conduct all Jews and other foreign prisoners in an orderly manner through the front lines, and thus show Germany’s ‘good will.’” Ultimately, Schellenberg held the expectation that this plan would—“beyond the rescue of these people”—segue into the “discussion of a compromise, which would be to everybody’s benefit.” In other words, the truce would lead to negotiations about a separate peace with the Western Allies. However, none of this could be achieved without Hitler’s approval, and Himmler, who by Schellenberg’s reckoning personally agreed with the plan’s merits, did not dare to discuss it with the Führer. Instead, Himmler consulted “with the chief of the ‘Camarilla’ which surrounded Hitler, Kaltenbrunner, who then indicated his refusal.”36 All that stood between Schellenberg, a solution to humanitarian crisis in the camps, and the end of the war was Kaltenbrunner. Similar points are made in the “Final Report,” but Schellenberg provided additional, damning details. He gleefully conveyed Kaltenbrunner’s bumpy career trajectory (owed largely to Kaltenbrunner’s disbarment after his involvement in the 1934 Nazi coup attempt in Austria) and compared it to his own much more successful one. He related Kaltenbrunner’s jealousy and his efforts to make Schellenberg’s professional life difficult, one of the report’s main themes. Kaltenbrunner brought about a deterioration of Schellenberg’s position, rebuffed Schellenberg’s efforts, attempted to remove Schellenberg from his position in Amt VI, and established himself as a relentless micromanager: “All documents and reports of importance had to be submitted to Kaltenbrunner and signed by him and all important decisions and authorizations were taken by Kaltenbrunner personally.” As Kaltenbrunner was Schellenberg’s superior, this should not have been a shocking surprise. After Kaltenbrunner’s appointment, Schellenberg also found his own direct access to Himmler, which he had until then enjoyed, much restricted; this was a source of major irritation for him. Conversely, Kaltenbrunner was not amused that Schellenberg kept going over his head and directly to Himmler still.37 Schellenberg also made much of Kaltenbrunner’s attempt to circumscribe more precisely Schellenberg’s position in his office and in the RSHA in general or to undermine him by establishing Kaltenbrunner’s cronies, such as Otto Skorzeny, Wilhelm Hoettl, or Wilhem Waneck, the men of the “Austrian Group,” in Schellenberg’s domain. Schellenberg countered by putting his own allies in place. Schellenberg furthermore reframed events that were indicative of a good working relationship between him and Kaltenbrunner. When, in the aftermath of the usurpation of the Abwehr, Kaltenbrunner “put Schellenberg in charge of Amt Mil,” Schellenberg let it be known that this had been “provisional.”38 Schellenberg thus recast a career capstone into a temporary arrangement; indirectly, this also implied that the responsibility for Amt Mil was not his alone. Schellenberg also suggested that Kaltenbrunner forced upon him the rank of Major General of the Police and strongly insinuated that he much preferred his civilian titles. Kaltenbrunner, according to Schellenberg, remained a threat to him until the end of the\n\nwar and occasionally tried to have him removed from his position. When this removal happened—on May 1, 1945—Schellenberg was with Himmler in Northern Germany and the Reichsführer SS did not take Kaltenbrunner’s step seriously. Indeed, Schellenberg stressed that Himmler appeared to regret not having taken a stronger stand against Kaltenbrunner earlier.39 In sum, Kaltenbrunner was at the root of all problems. There was plenty of information in this report that could be used against Kaltenbrunner, and it was abundantly clear that Schellenberg would be all too glad to provide additional information if the prosecution so desired. Schellenberg’s narrative about Kaltenbrunner and his insidiousness remained stable from the “Autobiography” to the “Final Report.” The main difference can be found in the level of detail—whereas the “Autobiography” focuses largely on Schellenberg’s “humanitarian” and peace-negotiating efforts in the last months of the war, the “Final Report,” in which those very same efforts provide the main plot, covers a much broader swath of history. It gave Schellenberg extended opportunities to paint Kaltenbrunner in an unfavorable light and, conversely, to elevate his own standing. These efforts were not restricted to Kaltenbrunner’s political demeanor. Schellenberg also made sure to include a fair sprinkling of juicy personal tidbits, with Kalten brunner’s vanity taking pride of place.
