The series, which will be jointly edited and directed by Ann Mackenzie and Paul Preston, is part of a proposed larger enterprise of collaboration involving scholars in Britain, Spain and throughout the world. This series of Research Studies on Spain is designed to stimulate and publish research into the history of Spanish civilization in all its aspects - political, social, religious, literary, artistic, international- from the Golden Age through to the twentieth century. This first volume of the series has its origins in an idea conceived by Paul Preston several years ago. In 1984, in order to make available to a wide readership key aspects of research being undertaken on Spain during the 1930s, he had edited and published a collection of studies dealing with Revolution and War in Spain 1931-1939. 1 In the decade that followed major researches continued to be carried out in this field, and he formed the opinion that a second volume of collected studiesas successor to Revolution and War in Spain - should be published. Numerous other commitments, however, not least his monumental biography of Franco, prevented him from realizing his intention. Then, in 1994, there came a suggestion from Ann Mackenzie: would he edit, with her, a collection of essays to commemorate, in 1996, the sixtieth anniversary of the Spanish Civil War? An application made to the Canada Blanch Foundation for a grant to publish the book proved successful. The University of Glasgow, following Ann Mackenzie's 1\n\n(London: Methuen 1984).\n\nPREFACE\n\nii\n\nappointment in 1995 to a Chair at that institution, also agreed to assist the costs of publication. Thanks to these subventions, the Editors were able to realize the original project and publish a coherent collection of studies representative of current researches into the history and politics, the character and predicament, of the Spanish Republic Besieged 1936-1939.\n\n***** A significant number of publications and other academic happenings, of which this book is one, have followed the centenary, in 1991, of the birth of E. Allison Peers. These diverse studies and events have been designed to honour his prodigious contributions, as scholar and university teacher, to the advancement of learning and development of Hispanic Studies in Britain and throughout the world. In 1994 Geoffrey Ribbans delivered the Fifth E. Allison Peers Lecture at the University of Liverpool, offering an objective interpretation of the life and work of 'E. Allison Peers: A Centenary Reappraisal'. An exhibition entitled Redbrick Revisited: The University of Liverpool 1920-1952, held at Liverpool University in that same year, celebrated the career of Allison Peers as Gilmour Professor of Spanish and recorded his considerable influence upon changes in British universities during the critical period of post-war reconstruction - achieved most notably through the books which he wrote pseudonymously about 'Redbrick' Universities. In 1995 Peers' previously unpublished Memoirs, together with a Critical Introduction and Notes elucidating their significance, entitled Redbrick University Revisited: The Autobiography of 'Bruce Truscot', were sent to press and will shortly be published. 2 A recently issued Special Number of the Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, financed by the Gulbenkian Foundation, commemorated Peers' foundation of the journal more than seventy years ago, and also recognized Peers' pioneering work to develop in Britain the study of Portugal: Its Culture, Influence and Civilization. Soon forthcoming is a 2\n\nEdited by Ann L. Mackenzie and Adrian R. Allan (forthcoming, 1996).\n\nTHE REPUBLIC BESIEGED: crvn, WAR IN SPAIN 1936-1939\n\nm\n\nHomage Volume of Essays in Memory of E. Allison Peers, jointly published by the Modern Humanities Research Association and Liverpool University Press, which acknowledges the enduring importance of Peers' researches into Spanish literature and culture, observed most notably in his surveys and analyses of the Romantic Movement in Spain and his Studies of the Spanish Mystics. The present book differs from other studies already dedicated to Allison Peers in that it celebrates, rather than his achievements as a literary critic, journal-editor and educationist, his work as a historian. In a series of influential books written in the late 1930s and early 1940s, Peers documented and illuminated contemporary conflicts, issues and preoccupations affecting and transforming the State, Church and Society in Spain. These books, during the decades when they were published, established Peers as the most trusted commentator on the Spanish Civil War- as, on this so controversial topic, the one dispassionate, reliable guide and mentor of the English-speaking world amidst a welter of confusing emotionalisms. 3\n\nEven nowadays, between fifty and sixty years after they were written, The Spanish Tragedy 1930-1936: Dictatorship, Republic, Chaos (1936); Catalonia Infelix (1937); The Spanish Dilemma (1940); and Spain in Eclipse (1943), revealing Peers' extraordinary knowledge of Contemporary Spain, are, as Geoffrey Ribbans has commented, a valuable source of purely political history, of great documentary, and at times eye-witness, value. 4\n\nAmong more than fifty books which Peers completed in 'an incredible rhythm of production', these histories of 'The Spanish Tragedy' represent some of the most enduring results of his researches. For these works Allison Peers deserves to be 3 See William C.

They are particularly grateful to Professor Sir Graeme Davies, Principal of the University of Glasgow, for his decisive encouragement at a critical stage in the book's preparation. Equally they are indebted to the Canada Blanch Foundation for support that has been moral as well as financial- support which, remarkably, did not waver when the concise book of studies originally proposed, which had been expected to fill only one hundred and twenty pages, more than doubled its length to become a History of The Republic Besieged: Civil War in Spain 1936-1939. Ann L. Mackenzie\n\nJanuary 1996.\n\nIntroduction 1 PAUL PRESTON\n\nIn 1996, there will be commemorations of the sixtieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. It is likely to be the last such substantial commemoration which will enjoy the participation of surviving protagonists of the war most of whom are now in their eighth decade. There can be little doubting the significance of the Spanish Civil War, both as 'the last great cause' and as a defining moment on the road to the Second World War. In Spain, Mussolini and Hitler drew together in the Rome-Berlin Axis as they witnessed the pusillanimity of the democratic powers. 2 Scholarly research and anniversaries, however, are not usually comfortable bedfellows. It is in the nature of research that it rarely comes to fruition in time to be published on an appropriate anniversary. The previous major commemoration of the Spanish Civil War in 1986 stimulated a great surge of publishing activity in Great Britain, which included reprints of major works by Raymond Carr and Hugh Thomas, a work of synthesis, graphic collections and valuable memoirs and other material concerning the International Brigades, but little in the way of major new advances in research. 3 In the United States, 1 I would like to thank the Vicente Canada Blanch Foundation for its generous support for this volume and also of the individual research of several of the contributors. 2 See Paul Preston, The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939 (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1986), 1-7. 3 Among the books published in 1986 were Images of the Spanish Civil War, with an introduction by Raymond Carr (London: George Allen & Unwin); No Pasaran: Photographs and Posters of the Spanish Civil War, ed. Frances Morris (Bristol: Arnolfini); Cockburn in Spain: Despatches from the Spanish\n\nvi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe anniversary was marked only by the publication of books about the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. 4 In Spain itself, there was less made of the fiftieth anniversary than might have been expected. That was a consequence of the so-called 'pacto del olvido' (the pact of forgetfulness). As part of the general desire of the great majority of the Spanish people to ensure a bloodless transition to democracy, there was a tacit, collective agreement that there would be no settling of accounts after the death of Franco. A determination to prevent a repetition of Civil-War violence eventually overcame any longing for revenge. This collective determination to contribute by whatever means to the reestablishment of democracy had its advocates within the historical profession. The consequence was a reticence in universities about teaching the history of the period of the war and its aftermath and, in research, a marked reluctance to publish work which might in some way reopen old wounds. This was reflected in a refusal by the Socialist Government to sanction any official commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Civil War in 1986. 5 Despite its crucial value in political Civil War, edited by James Pettifer (London: Lawrence & Wishart); Voices from the Spanish Civil War: Personal Recollections of Scottish Volunteers in Republican Spain 1936-39, ed. Ian MacDougall (Edinburgh: Polygon Press); Walter Gregory, The Shallow Grave: A Memoir of the Spanish Civil War (London: Victor Gollancz); and International Brigade Memorial Archive: Catalogue 1986 (London: Marx Memorial Library). There were reprints of Raymond Carr, The Civil War in Spain (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, first published 19??) and Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War (London: Hamish Hamilton, first published 19??). The work of synthesis was my own book on the war (see above, note 2). 4 See Carl Geiser, Prisoners of the Good Fight: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939 (Westport, Connecticut: Lawrence Hill & Co.) and Marion Merriman and Warren Lerude, American Commander in Spain: Robert Hale Merriman and the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (Reno: Univ. of Nevada Press). 5 The trend towards a 'value-free' history of the Civil War during the first decade of the transition period was made explicit in Juan Luis Cebrian, 'Para una nueva cultura polftica', his introduction to the fiftieth-anniversary collection of articles published in the newspaper of which he was then editor, El Pais, La guerra de Espana 1936-1939 (Madrid: El Pais, 1986). The impossibility of forgetting the past was clear in both the fiftieth-anniversary history produced by Historia 16, La guerra civil, ed. Julio Ar6stegui et al., 24 vols (Madrid: Informaci6n y Revistas, 1986-88) and in the proceedings of a major conference held in Salamanca in September 1986 (Julio Ar6stegui,\n\nTHE REPUBLIC BESIEGED: CIVIL WAR IN SPAIN 1936-1939\n\nvu\n\nterms and its importance as a measure of the great political maturity of a Spanish populace traumatized by both the Civil War and the experience of the Franco dictatorship, the 'pacto del olvido' was always going to be difficult for the historians. 6 In fact, in Catalonia, major research on disagreeable aspects of the Spanish Civil War had proceeded despite the 'pact'. 7 Elsewhere, the uneasy truce with the past was broken within five years as a stream of important works began to appear about the repression in the Nationalist zone during the war and in Franco's Spain thereafter. 8 In the ten years since the last flurry of non-specialist interest in the Spanish Civil War, research has also moved on substantially in Britain. Inevitably, logistical considerations mean that the kind of detailed local research now being undertaken in Spain can rarely be matched by foreign scholars -although chapters 6 and 8 of the present volume show that it can be done. In consequence, much of the recent research being Historia y memoria de la guerra civil, 3 vols [Valladolid: Junta de Castilla y Le6n, 1988]). 6 See, for example, Francisco Moreno G6mez, La guerra civil en Cordoba (1936-1939) (Madrid: Editorial Alpuerto, 1985). 7 See Joan Villarroya i Font, Els bombardeigs de Barcelona durant la guerra civil (1936-1939) (Barcelona: Abadia de Montserrat, 1981); Hilari Raguer, Divendres de passi6: vida i mort de Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera (Barcelona: Abadia de Montserrat, 1984); Josep M.

The purpose of this volume is to make available to a wider audience the results of the research in progress of some of the growing number of scholars working on these aspects of the Spanish Civil War. Local research in Spain and elsewhere has enriched our view of the crisis of the 1930s and it has also reinforced one of the two central facts about the Spanish Civil War: in its origins, it was a series of Spanish social wars and many of the difficulties faced within the Republican zone derived from the incomplete resolution of some of those conflicts. Foreign, as well as Spanish scholars, 9 have contributed to confirming the other central truth about the war: in its course and outcome, it was an episode in a greater European Civil War that ended in 1945. 10 The ultimate defeat of the Spanish Republic came after a three-year siege in which it was besieged from without and from within; from outside, by the forces of international Fascism and their unwitting accomplices among the democratic states and, from inside, by the forces of the extreme left who put their own revolutionary ambitions before the effort to build a centralized war effort. The rising took place on the evening of 17 July in Spain's Moroccan colony and in the Peninsula itself on the morning of 18 July. The plotters were confident that it would all be over in a few days. Had they just had the Republican government to contend with, their predictions might have come true. In fact, Spain was soon divided along the lines of the electoral geography of February 1936 - the coup was successful in the 9 The pioneer in this regard was Angel Vinas; see his La Alemania nazi y.el 18 de julio (Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 1974) and El oro de Moscu: alfa y omega de un mito franquista (Barcelona: Grijalbo, 1979). More recently, important works include Ismael Saz Campos, Mussolini contra la II Republica: hostilidad, conspiraciones, intervenci6n (1931-1936) (Valencia: Edicions Alfons el Magnanim, 1986); Enrique Moradiellos, Neutralidad benevola: el gobierno britanico y la insurrecci6n militar espanola de 1936 (Oviedo: Pentalfa, 1990); and Juan Aviles Farre, Pasion y farsa: franceses y britanicos ante la guerra civil espanola (Madrid: Eudema, 1994). 10 Paul Preston, 'The Great Civil War: European Politics, 1914-1945', in The Oxford History of Contemporary Europe, ed. Tim Blanning (Oxford: Oxford U. P., 1995), 148-81.\n\nTHE REPUBLIC BESIEGED: CIVIL WAR IN SPAIN 1936-1939\n\ntx\n\nCatholic small-holding areas which voted for the CEDA. However, in the left-wing strongholds of industrial Spain and the great estates of the deep south, the uprising was defeated by the spontaneous action of the working-class organizations. Within a matter of days, the country was split into two war zones and there was every reason to suppose that the Republic would be able to crush the rising. While power in the streets lay with the workers and the militia organizations, there was still a bourgeois Republican government which had legitimacy in the international arena, control of the nation's gold and currency reserves and virtually all of Spain's industrial capacity. There was not that much to choose between the armed forces of both sides. What the working-class militias lacked in training they made up in an enthusiasm that could not be matched by the conscripts of the rebel army. That situation was exemplified in the navy where left-wing sailors had mutinied against their right-wing officers. There would, however, be two factors which would soon make all the difference between the two sides - the ferocious Mrican Army and the help of the Fascist Powers. At first, the colonial army under Franco, was blockaded in Morocco by the fleet. However, while the Republican Government in Madrid met only hesitance from its sister Popular Front government in Paris and covert hostility from London, Franco was quickly able to persuade the local representatives of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy that he was the man to back. As Enrique Moradiellos shows in chapter 1, Franco also managed to persuade the local British authorities in North Mrica that he was fighting a 'frankly Communist' enemy and that they should close the facilities of the ports of Tangier and Gibraltar to the Republican forces. Altogether more decisive was his success with the Italians and Germans. Again, as is demonstrated in chapters 2 and 3, his 'blind faith' in his own success and his powers of persuasion were crucial. Both the Italian authorities in Tangier and local representatives of the Nazi Party were sufficiently convinced by him that they put his case to Mussolini and Hitler respectively. Their decision-making processes were, of course, then conditioned by their own calculations of the opportunities offered by the Spanish crisis to alter the European balance of power to the detriment of Britain\n\nx\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nand France. Nevertheless, it is significant that, in London, the insurgents were soon known as 'General Franco's forces' and, in Rome, as 'i franchisti' - and this two months before Franco was elected as single commander of the rebel forces. As Dr Moradiellos demonstrates, the confident prophecy of important figures in Whitehall that Franco would see the benefits to Spain of friendship with Britain was not fulfilled. 11 By the end of July, Junkers 52 and Savoia-Marchetti transport aircraft were arriving to permit the airlift of the bloodthirsty Foreign Legion across the Straits of Gibraltar. That crucial early aid was soon followed by a regular stream of high technology assistance. In contrast to the state-of-the-art equipment arriving from Germany and Italy, complete with technicians, spare parts and the correct workshop manuals, the Republic, shunned by the democracies, had to send its illequipped and bookish emissaries to operate in the open arms market and, in consequence, make do with over-priced and obsolete equipment from private arms dealers. However, whereas unstinted Italian aid would severely damage Italian military effectiveness, the Germans, as Christian Leitz demonstrates in chapter 3, were ruthless in ensuring a return on their investment in terms of strategic raw materials and growing penetration of the Spanish mining industry. Western European diplomats stationed in Moscow had reported to their governments that the initial reaction of the Soviet Union was one of deep embarrassment about the events in Spain. The Kremlin did not want the rising and the revolution which it provoked to undermine its delicately laid plans for an alliance with France. However, by mid-August, as Denis Smyth shows in chapter 4, it was apparent to the Soviet hierarchy that an even greater disaster would befall those plans if the Spanish Republic fell. That would severely alter the European balance of power, leaving France with three Fascist states on her borders. Eventually, it was reluctantly decided to send help. The tanks and planes which arrived in the autumn were, together with the arrival of the International Brigades, to 11 On Franco's pro-Axis sentiments after the Spanish Civil War, see Denis Smyth, Diplomacy and Strategy of Survival: British Policy and Franco's Spain, 1940-41 (Cambridge: Cambridge U.

However, they were also to be used to justify the intervention of Hitler and Mussolini. The motivation of both was principally to undermine the AngloFrench hegemony of international relations but they were sure of a sympathetic ear in London when they claimed to be fighting Bolshevism. The volunteers who fought to save Madrid were described by German and Italian diplomats to their receptive British and French colleagues as agents of Moscow sent to Spain to establish a Communist outpost in Western Europe. In fact, their reasons for going had nothing to do with any such schemes. They were among the first in Europe to take up arms against the Fascist menace. Italian, German and Austrian refugees saw the Spanish Civil War as their first chance to fight back against Fascism. French (the most numerous contingent), British and North-American volunteers went to Spain out of concern about what defeat for the Republic might mean both in international terms and also in their own countries as a boost for the extreme right. In that sense, they were fighting national as well as international conflicts on Spanish soil. An extreme example of this is provided by the Irish who, as Robert Stradling shows in chapter 5, were to be found on both sides, fighting in Spain essentially Irish battles. The pro-Republican volunteers from all over Europe and the Americas were the first in the field in a war which would not end until 1945. These 'premature antifascists' were reviled on their return home to Britain, treated as the 'scum of the earth' in French internment camps or regarded as dangerous and un-American in the United States. Despite this, the surviving volunteers fought in the Second World War - after all, the anti-Fascist war was their war. The Spanish Republic was fighting not only Franco and his armies but also, to an ever greater degree, the military and economic might of Mussolini and Hitler. Besieged from outside, the Republic also had massive internal problems unknown in Franco's brutally militarized zone. The crumpling of the bourgeois state in the first days of the war saw the rapid emergence of revolutionary organs of parallel power. A massive popular collectivization of agriculture and industry took place. Exhilarating to participants and observers like George Orwell\n\nxu\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nand Franz Borkenau, the great collectivist experiments of the autumn of 1936 did little to create a war machine. That task, as is demonstrated by Helen Graham in chapter 7, would lie at the heart of the undeclared civil war which would rage within the Republican zone until mid-1937. Socialist leaders like Prieto and Juan Negrin were convinced that a conventional state, with central control of the economy and the institutional instruments of mass mobilization, was essential if there was to be an efficacious war effort. Even the marginalized President of the Republic, Manuel Azafi.a, shared this goal. However, as James Whiston shows in chapter 9, it is a measure of his abdication from the struggle that his views were expressed in oblique form in his novel-cumdialogue, La velada en Benicarl6. The Communists and the Soviet advisers agreed- not only was this common sense but the playing down of the revolutionary activities of Trotskyists and anarchists was necessary to reassure the bourgeois democracies with which the Soviet Union sought understanding. In chapter 6, Chris Ealham explains why the traditional theory and practice of Spanish anarchism was inimical to the aims of Negrin and his Soviet advisers. The anti-statist thinking of the libertarian movement, the Confederaci6n Nacional del Trabajo, the Federaci6n Anarquista Iberica and the Federaci6n Iberica de Juventudes Libertarias, led them to pose their revolutionary goals in opposition to the Republican state. Deeply damaging to the central economic coordination of the war effort, this also led to crippling internecine hostilities within the Republican zone. The activities of 'uncontrollables' who engaged in robbery and violence for their own ends undermined the efforts of successive Republican governments to project an image of bourgeois normality. This in turn permitted the coalition of Republicans, moderate Socialists and Communists to justify the crushing of a revolution which could be portrayed as objectively playing into the hands of Fascism. It was in large part against the indisciplined individualism of the anarchists that, henceforth, there would be a struggle to establish a Popular Front government which fulfilled the expectations of the architects of the Popular Front electoral coalition of February 1936. That was eventually established\n\nTHE REPUBLIC BESIEGED: CML WAR IN SPAIN 1936-1939\n\nXIu\n\nunder the premiership of Negrin from May 1937. Despite having crushed the revolution, incorporated the working-class militias into the regular forces and dismantled the collectives, it still did not achieve victory - not because the policies were wrong but because of the strength of the international forces arrayed against the Republic. With the Spanish Republic abandoned by the Western Powers and opposed by Franco, Hitler and Mussolini, only the Soviet Union came to its aid. Of course, Stalin did not do so out of any idealism or sentiment. Rather the case was that, threatened by expansionist Germany, he was hoping like his Czarist predecessors to limit the threat by seeking an encircling alliance with France. He feared rightly that, if Franco won the war with the help of Hitler, France would crumble. Accordingly, he set out to give sufficient aid to the Republic to keep it alive while ensuring that the revolutionary elements on the left were prevented from provoking the conservative decision-makers in London from supporting the Axis in an antiBolshevik crusade. It is appalling that the revolutionary elan of the Spanish people, the Republic's greatest asset, should have been squandered or that the sincere revolutionaries of the POUM should have been smeared as Nazi agents and bloodily suppressed by the agents of the NKVD. It is certainly true, as Denis Smyth argues, that Stalin's rational quest for respectability did nothing to alter the contempt felt in Whitehall for the Spanish Republic. However, as Herbert Southworth demonstrates in chapter 10, one of the consequences of the Cold War was the successful dissemination of the idea that it was the Stalinist repression which led to Franco's victory. In the historiography of the Spanish Civil War sponsored by the CIA-funded Congress for Cultural Freedom, minor episodes of the internecine struggles within the Republican zone are allowed to dwarf the wider issues of the war. The success of that historiography has obscured the fact that Hitler, Mussolini, Franco and Chamberlain were responsible for that victory, not Stalin. It is difficult to imagine how a revolutionary Spain could have succeeded without the support of Russian arms. Indeed, without Russian arms and the International Brigades, Madrid would probably have fallen in November 1936 and Franco been\n\nXlV\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nvictorious long before the anarchists and Trotskyists of Barcelona became an issue. The consequences of his victory are examined in chapter 8 by Michael Richards. Franco was determined to win the war slowly and thoroughly. His ambition was not a swift and stylish victory but a thorough-going demolition of everything related to the Republic as the first step towards the permanence of his own regime. If he did not aspire to a thousand-year Reich, he made it clear in many speeches that he intended to eradicate socialism, communism, anarchism, liberal democracy and freemasonry from Spain for centuries to come. Part of that project was accomplished by a slow war of attrition in which many Republicans were killed and many communities annihilated. Systematic and deliberate massacres such as those at Badajoz, Malaga and Guernica had an immediate objective within the war but also a longer-term aim of demoralizing the Republican population.l 2 To put it crudely, Franco intended that those Republicans who were not killed in the war or forced into exile would be left too traumatized ever to oppose his regime. Michael Richards explains what that really meant in terms of losses of ideals, of hope, of identity, of dignity, of material comfort, of personal security. He shows how, by the deliberate and systematic use of terror, the conditions were created in which the struggle for mere survival erased any possibility of political opposition. Franco's regime would be the institutionalization of his victory in the Spanish Civil War. The Great Powers would acquiesce in its survival just as they had acquiesced in its creation.\n\n12 See Paul Preston, 'General Franco as Military Leader', Transactions of The Royal Historical Society, 6th Series, IV (1994), 21-41.\n\nPART I\n\nINTERNATIONAL HOSTILITY TO THE SECOND REPUBLIC\n\n1\n\nThe Gentle General: The Official British Perception of General Franco during the Spanish Civil War ENRIQUE MORADIELLOS\n\nJust before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, information on Francisco Franco in official circles was decidedly scanty, despite the fact that the future Caudillo had been a guest of the British Government in January 1935, as the Spanish representative at the funeral of George V. It was far less detailed than that available on his famous aviator brother and significantly more sparse than information on Generals Sanjurjo, Berenguer and Goded, whose political activity had in recent years been intense. It was limited to a biographical note in the routine report which the British Embassy in Madrid had to compile on 'leading personalities' for use by the Foreign Office and the government. Nevertheless, the note written in January 1936 by the Ambassador, Sir Henry Chilton, already emphasized the professional merits, political possibilism and anti-revolutionary zeal of the ascendent general. It read as follows: Franco, Major General Francisco. Born at Ferrol on the 14th December 1892. An infantry officer who served with great distinction in Morocco, where he commanded the Foreign Legion from 1923 to 1926. He played a conspicuous part in the occupation of the Ajdir sector, for which he was promoted to BrigadierGeneral. On creating the General Military Academy at Saragossa in 1928, General Primo de Rivera appointed him its first Commandant. When this academy was closed under the first Republican Government, General Franco was appointed to the 15th Infantry Brigade. In 1933 he became Military Commander of\n\n2\n\nENRIQUE MORADIELLOS\n\nthe Balearic Islands. In February 1935 he was appointed Commander-in-chief, Morocco, but was called home in May, after Sr. Gil Robles had become War Minister, to be chief of the Central General Staff. He was promoted to his present rank in March 1934. A fearless officer, clever tactician, popular commander, General Franco is one of the most prominent officers in the Spanish Army, and has now the almost unique record among senior officers of being as much appreciated by Republican War Ministers as he was formerly by Ministers under the Monarchy. He is regarded as a 'national power'. He acted as principal adviser to the War Minister in many aspects of the military campaign in October 1934 in Asturias. General Franco belongs to a family of distinguished soldiers. His brother, Don Ramon, is the well-known airman. 1\n\nDuring the critical semester between the Popular Front victory in February 1936 and the military insurrection in July information on Franco received in London remained exiguous. This is surprising because, given Britain's important economic and strategic interests in Spain, analysts in the Embassy and in the Western (Europe) Department in the Foreign Office had closely followed the tense socio-political situation during the Second Republic. 2 In fact, during this latter period in Conservative governmental circles an interpretation of the Spanish crisis had been developed. It stressed that Spain was undergoing a pre-revolutionary crisis analogous to that in Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, with an impotent 'Kerenski' Cabinet which was being overwhelmed by the mobilization of the peasants and workers who had brought it to power. By July these sources almost totally ruled out the possibility of a constitutional resolution of the crisis and expected either an intervention of the army to reimpose order as in 1923 or a civil war which would bring in its train a 1 Records of Leading Personalities in Spain, 7 January 1936 (Foreign Office Records, Confidential Prints [FO 425], file 413, document W245 [thereafter, FO 425/413 W245)).

It was in this context that the name of Franco appeared in reports relaying rumours of a military coup picked up by the Madrid Embassy in the spring of 1936. Yet the figure of Franco was only tentatively mentioned, and always appeared after those of the impulsive Goded and the exiled Sanjurjo. It was Goded who, acting as 'Head of the Spanish Army', was responsible for a secret mission to London at the end of May in which the British authorities were warned that a military coup d'etat 'designed solely to restore order' was imminent, that it had no Fascist objectives and that it had no connection with Italy. 3 However, from 18 July, after the outbreak of the military insurrection, the figure of General Franco rapidly acquired importance on the international political stage and he soon shook off his relative anonymity amongst the British governing class. It was the Ambassador Chilton who, on urgently telegraphing the Foreign Office on 19 July to inform it that 'Senor Gil Robles and General Franco had come out openly against the Government', first emphasized his stature over and above the other generals. Simultaneously, Franco's standing was reinforced by the reports from the British consul in Tetmin (capital of Spanish Morocco), which described him as the 'head of the Army of Mrica', precisely the part of the Spanish army with most combat experience, operational capability and prestige abroad. 4 Indeed, the failure of Generals Goded and Fanjul in Barcelona and Madrid respectively and their immediate detention (prior to their execution within a matter of weeks), along with the accidental death of Sanjurjo in Lisbon, pushed Franco to a position of pre-eminence in a matter of hours. Furthermore, these unforeseen set-backs eliminated competitors and converted the Moroccan troops into the key 3 Note by Mr Shuckburgh, 30 May 1936 (Foreign Office Records, General Correspondence, FO 371/20522 W4919). In a previous despatch by Chilton to the Foreign Office (22 April) he mentioned the rumour that after the military coup 'either General Franco or General Goded' would be 'the dictator' (FO 371/20521 W3720). 4 Despatch from Mr Monck-Mason (British consul at Tetuan) and telegram from Chilton, 18 and 19 July 1936 (FO 371/10523 W6702 and W6626).\n\n4\n\nENRIQUE MORADIELLOS\n\nforce that could break the initial equilibrium in Spain between the military insurgents on the one hand and the worker and pro-government militias, on the other. Franco himself built his reputation by very successfully undertaking wide-ranging international negotiations aimed at securing vital foreign support. At the same time as he contacted local representatives of the Fascist governments of Rome and Berlin to obtain aircraft to transport his troops to Seville, the General held a series of meetings with the British consul in Tetuan, Mr Monck-Mason, to ask the British Government to close the ports of Gibraltar and Tangier to the Republican navy, which was blockading the Straits. At his first meeting with the British consul on 20 July, Franco maintained that he was fighting against a 'frankly Communist' enemy, and stated that for this reason the United Kingdom should close its port facilities. The British Government, after receiving this request along with a contrary one from the Republican authorities, on 22 July decided de facto to accept Franco's demand and neutralized the ports of Gibraltar and Tangier for the duration of the War. To a large extent, this reaction reflected the British authorities' fears about the presence in Gibraltar of a fleet 'commanded and manned by Communists' (according to the Governor of Gibraltar). More importantly, it followed on from their conclusion that in Spain 'military forces' were combating 'a virtual Soviet' under the umbrella of a lifeless, phantasmagoric government, which was, as a result, unworthy of either indirect or direct support. Such a government, as a mask for Bolshevik expansionism, deserved, in the eyes of London, no more than the arms embargo which would soon be imposed with the signing of the Non-Intervention Pact by all the European Powers.5 5 Dispatch from Mr Monck-Mason, 21 July 1936; telegram from the Gibraltar Governor, 22 July 1936; telegram from the Embassy secretary, 21 July 1936 (FO 371/20523 W6758, W6747 and W6575); Cabinet Minutes and Conclusions, 22 July 1936; Cabinet Office Records, Cabinet Minutes (CAB 23), file 85 (thereafter, CAB 23/85).

Also, Enrique Moradiellos, 'Appeasement and Non-Intervention: British Policy during the Spanish Civil War', in Britain and\n\nTHE GENTLE GENERAL\n\n5\n\nIn these initial (daily) meetings with the British consul in Tetuan, Franco transmitted the image of a prudent and sincere leader who accepted the difficulties he faced and who had to look for aircraft and other help from abroad. On 29 July, after the arrival of the first planes sent secretly by Hitler and Mussolini, Franco 'very optimistically' informed the consul that '[he] had now a larger number of aeroplanes than the Government forces', and that he would use them to transport his troops over to the mainland and initiate the march on Madrid. He also affirmed that, 'he did not attempt to conceal the fact that the reduction of Madrid would take some time to effect'. Such a show of prudence and sincerity led the consul to conclude that: 'There can be no doubt that General Franco is extremely anxious to do nothing that might entail complications with Great Britain'. 6 In this way, together with his success in obtaining Italian-German aid, by the end of July Franco had attained a pre-eminent position amongst the insurgents in the European chancilleries and mass media, far above the other generals and the anonymous National Defence Junta officially established in Burgos. This could be seen in the first debate on the Spanish conflict in the British House of Commons. On 31 July, a leading figure in the Labour Party, Philip Noel-Baker, maintained that the Republican Government still retained the right to buy British arms in order to defend itself and bitterly denounced the attempted coup by 'General Franco and his fellow-conspirators'. Even the anodyne minutes of British Cabinet meetings reflect a significant change of emphasis. Hence, while in the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Policy on 27 July the rebels were referred to simply as the 'Spanish Insurgents', when it met again on 25 August the phrase 'General Franco's forces' predominated. By this time, in the British right-wing and Catholic press, Franco had been elevated to the position of head of an anti-Communist crusade. Thus, on 20 July, the London daily, The Morning Post, stated that 'General Franco is the strong man of the movement'. Seven days later the The Daily the Threat to Stability in Europe, 1918-1945, ed. P. Caterrall and J. C. Morris (London: Leicester U. P., 1993), 94-104. 6 Despatches from Mr Monck-Mason, 24 and 30 July 1936 (FO 371/20524 and 20525, W6989 and W7492).\n\n6\n\nENRIQUE MORADIELLOS\n\nMail published the first interview Franco had given to a foreign newspaper under the headline, 'GENERAL FRANCO TALKS', in which he was presented as the 'commander-in-chief of the southern anti-red Army'. The general's message could not have been more direct and straight-forward: Communism triumphant spells the destruction of Western Civilization and religion. We appeal to the great nations for sympathy in our struggle against destructive Bolshevism. 7\n\nWith respect to official British Conservative circles, although never admitted in public, the promotion of Franco into the representative of the insurgent forces had very positive, even though hidden, effects. Given Franco's record and his cautious personality, the British authorities were convinced that they were faced with a nationalist and counterrevolutionary military movement, which had no aggressive fascistic ambitions to revise the international status quo, as was the case with Italy and Germany. Franco's insurrection was therefore perceived as posing no threat to the country's strategic position (the security of the British naval base in Gibraltar) or to its economic interests (the continuation of substantial British investments and the dominance of U.K. companies over Spanish commerce). In brief, Franco did not appear to be either a dangerous doctrinaire politician (like Adolf Hitler) or an unpredictable Fascist demagogue (like Benito Mussolini). Rather he was viewed as a good Spanish military man, who was prudent, conservative and nationalist, and who had risen up only to combat chaos and the spectre of social revolution which had now raised its head in the Republican rearguard. Moreover, as Britain's old and faithful Portuguese allies never tired of repeating, Franco intended 'the establishment of a regime resembling the Portuguese rather than a Fascist State'. 7 Parliamentary Debates.

Watkins, Britain Divided. The Effects of the Spanish Civil War on British Political Opinion (London: Thomas Nelson, 1963).\n\nTHE GENTLE GENERAL\n\n7\n\nWhichever side won the war, Britain could count on two decisive elements to guarantee her position in Spain: in the first place British financial and economic strength, which was of crucial importance for the Spanish economy, and, secondly, the military supremacy of the Royal Navy in the area. Nevertheless, Franco's victory in the Civil War was viewed as a 'splendid' prospect because, in the revealing words of a senior official within the Foreign Office, 'the alternative to Franco is Communism tempered by anarchy'. 8 It was because of this reasoned political confidence in Franco, and in the nature of the insurrection he headed, that the British authorities contemplated his quest for Italo-German aid and its deliverance without excessive concern. Moreover, Franco was quick to send a telegram to London on 8 August giving a formal guarantee that there would be no territorial agreements with Rome or Berlin in recompense: Sent via Lisbon Stop Categorically deny the story spread in that country about supposed promise of bases in Morocco to any Power Stop Spanish National Movement will respect treaties in vigour with all loyalty Stop General Franco.9\n\nAs the reactions in the Foreign Office indicate, this denial was accepted as sincere and truthful. Sir George Mounsey, Assistant Under-Secretary in charge of Western Europe, noted laconically that: 'It is not a Spanish characteristic to bargain away his property'. Mr Shuckburgh, clerk officer responsible for Spanish affairs in the Western Department, added afterwards, 'we can probably rely on the General's nationalistic feeling to prevent anything of that sort'. Nevertheless, in order to prevent any misunderstandings Anthony Eden, Secretary of the Foreign Office, asked for and obtained approval from the Cabinet to transmit a warning, suauiter in modo, to the unpredictable Mussolini laying out the tolerable limits for Great Britain of his support for Franco. These were respect for the 8 Minute by Gladwyn Jebb, 25 November 1936 (FO 371/20570 W15915).

Given the great expansion of the Fascist Falange Espafiola on the back of the wartime social mobilization, his maintenance of tight military control over the anti-Republican coalition was much appreciated in London. On 25 September Mr Oswald Scott, First Secretary of the Embassy (evacuated to Hendaye near the Franco-Spanish border), sent a dense report to London which was to be of key importance in the definitive crystallization of the official British position. In it he argued that a victory for the Republic would result in an inexorable Balkanization of Spain combined with total Soviet dominance. In addition, a note enclosed by the Commercial Secretary added that: 'This will be the end of our financial stake in Spain and the ruin of our commerce for years'. In contrast, the expected victory of the insurgents would bring a badly needed stability to the country on the basis of rule by General Franco with the support of the social-Catholic masses, who would act as a bulwark against Falange extremism: General Franco has a wider vision and contemplates probably a liberal military dictatorship, with the Roman Catholic Church reestablished but kept aloof from politics, and measures of social, industrial and agrarian reform designed to preclude a recurrence of the conditions which in recent years made unrest inevitable among the working and peasant classes. If Sr. Gil Robles were to be able to reassume control of Acci6n Popular and the CEDA he might quite well be found co-operating with General Franco but his absence from Spain in the early days of the revolt has for the time being destroyed his prestige and popularity and opened the road for the extreme elements of Falange Espaiiola. [... ] This [collaboration between Franco and Gil Robles] should afford a combination with sufficient vision, discipline and administrative ability to produce a government capable of giving the country what it has looked for in vain for years: firm leadership, progressive ideals, education (not on purely clerical lines), and perhaps even equal justice. 10 Telegram and minute, 13 and 21 August 1936 (FO 371/20532 W8997); Cabinet Minutes, 2 September 1936 (CAB 23/85).\n\nTHE GENTLE GENERAL\n\n9\n\nThe Commercial Secretary added, in his accompanying note, that he saw as achievable the British hope that it would be possible to intensify future relations with the new Spanish regime through the old, well established, recourse to the diplomacy of pound sterling: I do not think that Germany and Italy will be able to exert a special influence on Spanish Commercial policy. As long as the United Kingdom remains a large market for Spanish exports, we shall have adequate means of protecting ourselves. Commerce usually depends upon self-interests, and gratitude rarely plays an important part.\n\nBoth reports were subject to a close examination by highranking civil servants in the Foreign Office, and they were sent to other ministries (War, Admiralty, Air, Board of Trade and the Treasury) for their information. On the basis of these reports, the desk officer in charge of Spanish affairs in the Foreign Office elaborated a crucial minute which took up the generalized identification of Franco as 'the protagonist of a liberal dictatorship', whose establishment would be favourable for the interests of the United Kingdom. Given its sincerity it is worth quoting at length: I suggest that our chances of regaining our influence in Spain during this period [the postwar] are considerable, owing to the fact that the Spanish revolution, unlike the Fascist and Nazi revolutions, will have been won primarily by the military, who traditionally look to the United Kingdom and France rather than to Germany and Italy. [. .. ] It is therefore a British interest that a liberal military rather than a Fascist dictatorship should emerge (1) in order to counteract Italian and German influence, (2) in order to stabilise the internal situation. 11\n\n11 Minute by Mr Montagu-Pollock in response to the reports by Mr Scott and Mr Pack cited, 9 October 1936 (FO 371/20540 W12454). Mr Pack reaffirmed his opinion in an extensive report (30 October 1936) in which he pointed out that 'when the war is over Spain will be in need of imports considerably above her normal requirement [... ], will be short of foreign exchange and there will be a grave need for extensive foreign credits [... ]. In any case the obvious country in which to obtain such foreign credits will be Great Britain. The inference is that we shall, in the future, be in a very strong position for negotiating any commercial agreement with the new Spanish Government, even though we may have offended them in the course of the\n\n10\n\nENRIQUE MORADIELLOS\n\nThese arguments and the expectation of a rapid end to the war guided the conduct of the British authorities during the whole of the first semester of the Civil War. They were behind the official policy of collective Non-Intervention, whose real aims were less impartial than they were declared to be. These were, in reality, to confine the war to Spain and at the same time to block the support of Britain's French ally to the Republic, prevent an Anglo-French alliance with the Soviet Union on the Spanish problem, and side-step any conflict with Germany and Italy as a result of their aid to Franco. Winston Churchill had defined these aims succintly in a private letter to Eden on 7 August: It seems to me most important to make Blum [French Socialist Premier] stay with us strictly neutral, even if Germany and Italy continue to back the rebels and Russia sends money to the Government. 12\n\nHowever, the unexpected Republican resistance in Madrid at the end of 1936, thanks to Soviet military aid, destroyed the expectation of a short military conflict. At the same time, the sudden intensification of Italo-German military and diplomatic support undermined the credibility of the European system of collective Non-Intervention. In these circumstances the unanimity of the British leadership regarding the policies followed began to break down. The growing Italo-German intervention and collaboration, along with the signs of Fascist growth in the Francoist zone, led Anthony Eden and his collaborators in the Foreign Office to consider necessary a reevaluation of the potential danger for British interests and a redesign of the country's policies with respect to what was now perceived as likely to be a long war. On the last day of December 1936, Sir Robert Vansittart, Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, presented to the Cabinet a dense secret report on The World Situation and British Rearmament. According to this document, the principal threat to the far-flung and weakened British Empire was to be war' (FO 371/20519 W14919). 12 Foreign Office Records, Eden Papers (FO 954), file 27. Cf. E.

Faced with this danger, the British response should be to maintain the present policy of appeasement, negotiation and limited rearmament, while exploring the possibilities of separating Italy from Germany and avoiding the nightmare of an exhausting conflict on three separate fronts. In this respect, the report called attention to the potential risks which the present policy of tacit tolerance towards the Nazi-Fascist activities in Spain could have: The two dictator States are creating a third; and, by recognising General Franco's government before he is sure of winning, they have committed themselves irretrievably to making a success of his venture, thus limiting niceties as to means. This may well bring the dictators still closer together, anyhow for a while, though here again there are already signs that Italy is disquieted by the thoroughness of the German effort, and might conceivably be prised loose. It is true that the Soviet government, which seems lately bereft of statesmanship or even card-sense, is largely responsible for making Spain the scene and cause of the bloodiest form of that very ideological struggle that we are seeking to prevent. The fact remains that the new totalitarian partners, who have been keeping their domains on a positive war-footing for the past few years, have cheerfully accepted the opportunity, and with their great quantities of surplus war material have turned ideological cannibalism into something even more concretely inimical to our interests. It is ironically true that, the crisis once precipitated, the victory of the Right would be no worse for us than the victory of the Left - a very extreme Left - which would spread a dividing and disintegrating contagion into France and from France into ourselves, and would so alter the European kaleidoscope as to present Germany with hegemony ready made. On the other hand, if Franco wins, the now combined weight of the two larger autocrats - unless natural causes and our own skill diminish their unity - will be too great for him, and he will be pulled more completely into their camp than his past proclivities and present interests render natural. We shall then be faced by at least a temporarily working combination of dictators, major, minor and minimus. 13 13\n\nReproduced m Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1918-1945,\n\n12\n\nENRIQUE MORADIELLOS\n\nThese same doubts were expressed concurrently by Anthony Eden in Cabinet in order to force a firmer Non-Intervention policy whose objective would be to favour a mediated settlement which would prevent the establishment of a Spanish regime closely associated with the German-Italian Axis. However, these worries were not shared by the other members of the British Government nor by high-ranking policy makers and military strategists. In the words of the influential Sir Maurice Hankey, Secretary to the Cabinet and of the Committee on Imperial Defence: I take a less serious view than he of the German and Italian adventures in Spain. General Franco is still a long way off victory, even if he captures Madrid, and, even if he wins, he may easily quarrel with his erstwhile supporters. Gratitude is not a strong tie in Politics. 14\n\nHence, after the transformation of the conflict into a long war at the end of 1936, the British leaders decided to maintain their Non-Intervention policy, and their tacit acceptance of an Italo-German aid which, at the end of the day, served to counter Soviet support for the Republic. The fact was that it seemed clear that this Nazi-Fascist help was in no way modifying the nature of the insurgent camp. Sir George Mounsey recalled in this regard: 'We have all along being inclined to discount the permanence of any German or Italian influence in Spain. Franco has had to lean on those two Powers because no help was forthcoming from any other quarter'. In any case, the marginal 'Spanish affair' could not be allowed to undermine the key policy of European appeasement and the possibility of separating Italy from Germany, especially because the resort to the 'diplomacy of pound sterling' would always be available in Spain. In March 1937, Neville Chamberlain, then Chancellor of the Exchequer and two months later to be Prime Minister, headed the opposition to the policy of firmness favoured by Eden with this key argument: Series 2, vol. XVII (London: H.M.S.O., 1979), appendix II, 779-80. 14 'Some Remarks on Sir Robert Vansittart's Memorandum', January 1937 (Cabinet Office Records, series 63 [Hankey Papers], file 51: CAB 63/51). On the efforts made by Eden see the minutes of the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Policy, 8 January 1937 (CAB 27/628).\n\nTHE GENTLE GENERAL\n\n13\n\nIt had to be remembered that we were dealing not only with the Spanish insurgents, but, behind them, with the Germans and Italians. General Franco was not a free agent. No doubt he hoped to win, but hardly without assistance from the Germans and Italians. Consequently he was unlikely to agree to any undertaking which was unacceptable to the Germans and Italians unless we were able to do something disagreeable to him in return. The Germans and Italians would not allow him to do so. To insist up to the point proposed in the Secretary of State's Memorandum therefore, was not only useless but must lead to a very serious situation with Germany and Italy. If and when General Franco had won the Civil War, however, the situation would be very different, and no doubt he would be looking round for help from other countries besides Germany and Italy. That would be the moment at which to put strong pressure upon him. [. .. ] that would be the time for action.15\n\nThe decision of the British Government to maintain unaltered its policy of unconditional Non-Intervention - in practice so favourable to the insurgents- was accompanied by a confirmation of its secret confidence in General Franco. This reaffirmation was not unrelated to the measures taken by the General and his victories on the battlefield, and was not even undermined by the crisis provoked by the naval blockade of Bilbao in April 1937. Mter the key conquest of the city, and of its industrial hinterland two months later, Franco renewed his pledge to respect British interests in Spain both through his unofficial representative in London, the Duke of Alba, and through the Portuguese Government. At the same time, the General communicated his acceptance of the British presence in Gibraltar and 'his desire that the nations of the Iberian Peninsula should work together within the orbit of British foreign policy'. 16 Moreover, the recent changes in the structure of the regime and, above all, the forced unification of all the right wing political parties in April seemed to confirm the military's predominance over the extremist elements within the 15 Cabinet Minutes and Conclusions, 3 March 1937 (CAB 23/87). The previous quotation in a minute, 3 April 1937 (FO 371/21288 W6244). 16 Minute by Lord Cranborne, 28 June 1936 (FO 800/296 [Foreign Office Records, series 800, 'Private Collections', file 296, 'Cranborne Papers1); despatch from Eden to the Ambassador in Lisbon, 28 June 1936 (FO 425/414).\n\n14\n\nENRIQUE MORADIELLOS\n\nNationalist coalition, and the increasingly unassailable position of Franco at its head. Both these phenomena were seen as reassuring in official British circles, which continued to maintain a mythical vision of Franco as an affable and 'liberal' general, who was the most effective antidote to Falangist extremism and the best solution to the Spanish tragedy. Thus, on 13 July 1937 a minute by Mr Walter Roberts, Head of the Western (Europe) Department at the Foreign Office, insisted that General Franco was 'a man of liberal ideas surrounded by reactionaries' and that his triumph and the consolidation of authoritarian rule under his person was in the British interest: I have always thought that in the event of a Nationalist victory General Franco, if he were to survive as a political leader, would have to maintain for a time a regime which did not include concessions to former enemies, and that it would only be after his position was fully established that he could afford to make a beginning with his liberal programme. If I am right, it would probably be in the interests of future peace in Spain that this position should be accepted by foreign governments, and in particular by His Majesty's Government, and that we should resist the clamour for the immediate restoration of a parliamentary regime, which would almost inevitably lead to General Franco being overthrown by his extremist supporters and to a further period of civil war. 17\n\nMr Roberts' reasoning was backed up with more firmly grounded arguments by Lord Cranborne, Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State at the Foreign Office, in an extensive report dated 21 July. Cranborne argued that fears expressed by some official analysts, along with leaders of the Labour Party and some Conservatives, regarding the security of Gibraltar and British naval hegemony in the Mediterranean in the event of a Francoist victory with Italo-German help were unfounded. His confidence was based on the persuasive power of the pound sterling and the dissuasive capability of the Royal Navy: I suggest that we are far too apt to assume that General Franco must be regarded as an inevitable danger to us. If he is for the moment hostile, it is largely the result of the present conjunction of circumstances. [... ] But there are other and far more enduring 17 Minute, 13 July 1937 (FO 371/21295 W12237).\n\nTHE GENTLE GENERAL\n\n15\n\nconsiderations which must incline him, in the long run, towards friendship with England. There is the fact that we want nothing from him, that we do not intend to sue his extremity to extract from him embarrassing concessions. There is the fact that we are the richest country in Europe, and have indeed in the past played far the greatest part in financing the development of Spain. There is the fact that we have the greatest fleet in the world, well placed alternatively to blockade or assist in the protection of his coasts. There is the fact of our long friendship with Portugal. All these are considerations that must be constantly in his mind. [. .. ] A Franco Spain is not necessarily a weakness to the British Empire - it might easily be a strength. But it rests with us to take the first step, if the foundations of future friendship are to be well and truly laid. 18\n\nDuring the second half of 1937, in accordance with these ideas, British policy was frankly favourable to the Franco regime on a series of bilateral and diplomatic fronts. In particular, in November 1937, the British Cabinet recognized the Francoist administration as de facto Government in Spain and there then followed an exchange of diplomatic agents between London and Burgos. The new British agent, Sir Robert Hodgson, held his first meeting with General Franco on 31 January 1938, and his impressions served to validate the General and the majority view already held within the Foreign Office: He has a very attractive personality. He is small of stature, probably no more than 5 feet and 6 inches, stockily built, and, I understand, 46 years of age. His hair, which was originally black, is now turning a steel grey and curls over his temples. He has a soft voice and speaks gently and rapidly. His charm lies in his eyes, which are of a yellow brown, intelligent, vivacious, and have a marked kindliness of expression. [. .. ] General Franco told me that at the time when the 'movement' broke out he was busy studying English. His lessons had been brusquely interrupted. He then asserted his friendly feelings towards England, mentioning the good feeling which had united the two countries in the past and referring briefly to old history and the Duke of Wellington's campaign. He spoke, too, of the cultural ties which united so many Spanish families with England and of the favourable dispositions which the simple folk in this country entertained towards things 18 FO 371/21298 W14857.\n\n16\n\nENRIQUE MORADIELLOS\n\nEnglish. Both countries had a maritime tradition and their position on the map was a tie between them. [... ] He also ... spoke of Anglo-Spanish relations in a manner which justifies the belief that the cordial tone he used to me was a true index of his sentiments. 19\n\nMter the resignation of Anthony Eden as Secretary of the Foreign Office in February 1938 because of disagreements over the tolerance of Italian intervention, the pro-Francoist proclivities of Neville Chamberlain's Cabinet were further accentuated. The British leadership was not prepared to allow the Spanish affair to get in the way of the improvement of Anglo-Italian relations, and saw the victory of Franco as a necessary contribution to this aim. As the private secretary of Lord Halifax, the new Foreign Secretary, stated in his diary on 5 June: 'In Spain the Government are praying for Franco's victory'. A clear example of this was the pressure put on the French Government in June 1938 definitively to close the southern border with Republican Spain to the supply of Soviet arms. The success of this policy signified the blockage of the last open route for the importation of arms and munitions to the Republican army. Franco confidentially expressed his gratitude to Chamberlain for this and other measures in a personal message transmitted by Lord Phillimore on 3 July: His Excellency wished me to greet Mr Chamberlain in his name and to thank him heartily for the friendship which he has shown towards Spain and to remind him that by his policy he is defending the same ideals and principles as we are and working in the interests ofworld peace and civilization.20\n\nThe offer of neutrality made by Franco in September 1938, during the diplomatic crisis which concluded with the Munich Pact and the partition of Czechoslovakia, temporarily calmed any British anxieties regarding Francoist foreign policy. However, the subsequent deterioration of the situation in Europe and the clear symptoms of growing Fascist influence within the Franco regime rekindled fears within some sectors of 19 Despatch, 1 February 1938 (FO 425/415). 20 Message from General Franco, 3 July 1938 (FO 800/323 ['Halifax Papers']). The previous quotation is in The Diplomatic Diaries of Oliver Harvey, 1937-1940 (London: Collins, 1970), 148.\n\nTHE GENTLE GENERAL\n\n17\n\nthe Foreign Office. In November 1938, various reports sent from Spain contradicted the image harboured by the British of the Spanish Caudillo. Some dispatches stated that Franco 'is now very much under the influence of the Falangists', and especially that his brother-in-law and Minister of the Interior, Ramon Serrano Sufier, was 'very pro-German'. Field-Marshal Sir Philip Chetwode, president of the International Commission for the Exchange of Prisoners, confessed in a private letter to Lord Halifax, that with regard to clemency and humanity Franco 'is worse than the Reds'. Meanwhile, reports from British military attaches on both sides of the conflict stressed that Franco was a mediocre strategist and that his conduct of the war left much to be desired. 21 With the definitive Nationalist victory in March 1939, Franco's limitations became clear, as did his determination to retain his post without taking any steps towards a Monarchist restoration. The new British Ambassador, Sir Maurice Peterson, who met Franco on 11 April, found him 'a friendly and sincere, although simple-minded, man', whose only 'genuine' obsession was Communism. According to Peterson, Franco shared 'the obstinacy, as well as the chivalry, with which the Spanish tradition credits the Galician' and 'goes on beating the anti-Communist drum because he does not know what other note to sound'. 22 By this time, the British authorities had reached the conclusion that 'Franco is going to be a big noise for a considerable time to come - a second Primo de Rivera', and that this situation 'would probably suit us best'. Reports insisted that Franco 'enjoys his position', was delighted with the shows of support he had received, and 'is taking root in his capacity as Head of State'. Consequently, 'he is unlikely to step down in favour of anyone else for some considerable time to\n\n21 Despatch from the British Ambassador in Paris, 9 November 1938 (FO 371/22631 W14907); private letter from Chetwode to Halifax, 14 November 1938 (FO 800/323); reports from Major Mahony and Major Richards, 7 November and 9 October 1938 (FO 425/415). 22 Despatches by Peterson, 12 April, 9 June 1939 (FO 425/416 and FO 371/24130 W9645).\n\n18\n\nENRIQUE MORADIELLOS\n\ncome'.23 This, it was felt, could be a guarantee of neutrality in the case of war with Germany because, in the words of a confidential report prepared in July 1939 by the War Office (Directorate of Military Operations and Intelligence), Franco, like the rest of the Spanish generals, 'is fully alive to the dangers which might threaten Spanish Morocco, the Balearics, the Canaries, etc., should Spain excite the hostility of the Democracies'. The same report went on to repeat the favourable impression of Franco which had been predominant in official circles during the Civil War: General Franco is a well know Spanish type: Dignified, austere, simple, a devout Catholic, a bland even-tempered, non 'intellectual', Middle Class personality. A good general with a reputation for calmness and cautiousness, but no Napoleon or Frederick The Great. Everything about him is the antithesis of the tub thumping fire-breathing Nazi or Fascist. He gives the impression of being a gentle and humane personality upon whom greatness has been thrust unasked for. He commands complete loyalty from the Generals and therefore from the Army; for the present his position as Head of the State is unchallenged. 24\n\nUnfortunately for Britain, with the onset of the Second World War, the Foreign Office would soon discover the other side of the gentle general, despite the fact that he was quick to declare Spain's neutrality. At the end of September 1939 Franco received a visit from the Conservative MP, Lord Lloyd, who found him 'quite friendly', but also stated that he was 'full of German propaganda with no real knowledge of what is going on in the world'. Furthermore, according to Lord Lloyd, 'he fully believed the German stories about our naval reverses, and thought that the French would run out of the war'.25 Meanwhile, within Spain a whole system of secret aid for the German war effort was being put into operation: the official press showed its preference for a German victory without any reservations; Spanish ports were made available as secret bases for the supply of Nazi submarines; and the Spanish military and police authorities gave logistic aid to the German secret 23 Despatch and telegram by Peterson, 3 May, 13 July 1939 (FO 371/24129 and 24131, W7368 and W10625). 24 Report by Major Mahony, 26 July 1939 (FO 371/24131 Wll396). 25 Minute, 1 November 1939 (FO 371/23170 C17246).\n\nTHE GENTLE GENERAL\n\n19\n\nservices. 26 On 9 October 1939 Ambassador Peterson summed up with the following words the significance of these facts: 'the tempo of the German drive in Spain has accelerated'. 27 In conclusion, the gentle general began to show another side of his personality, that of a dictator minimus, annoying, irritating and expectant. And once he was launched on his game of war and bluff, for the British the worst was yet to come.\n\n26 Minute on Spanish Press and Neutrality, 11 September 1939; note from the Naval Staff, Admiralty, 3 October 1939 (FO 371/23170 C13685 and C17705).

They had anticipated a classic pronunciamiento and assumed that, within a matter of days or at most a couple of weeks, they would control Spain. In general, they had not expected the scale of working-class resistance on the Spanish mainland. More particularly, given that the naval officer corps was solidly anti-Republican, they did not foresee the mutiny which placed the fleet in Government hands and permitted the blockade in Morocco of the most powerful rebel forces, the professional Army of Mrica, commanded by General Franco. Accordingly, in the days immediately following the uprising, both Franco and General Emilio Mola, the leader of the military rebels on the Spanish mainland, sent requests for help to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The earliest formal requests from both to reach the German Foreign Office were dismissed out of hand and it was only when emissaries from Franco with Nazi Party connections reached Hitler on the evening of 25 July that a decision was taken to help the Spaniards.2 Messengers reached Rome as early as 21 July but another four days were to pass before Mussolini began to incline towards taking a hand and a 1 This paper has benefited enormously from the help in terms of advice and materials so kindly given me by Lucio Ceva, MacGregor Knox, lsmael Saz and Brian R.

Despite his lengthy hesitation, the Duce's decision was taken in ignorance of that of Hitler albeit at about the same time or shortly thereafter. 3 The initial resolutions of both dictators were remarkably similar. They were to send the aircraft and other materials necessary to assist General Franco to transport his forces from Spanish Morocco to the mainland. Over the next weeks and months their commitment to Franco's cause would increase considerably. None the less, Hitler was to remain relatively circumspect, sending important equipment and the crack, technologically advanced, but small, Condor Legion. In contrast, Mussolini's involvement increased to the point at which Italy was, in everything but name, at war with the Spanish Republic. In consequence, his contribution to Franco's victory was decisive. In the process, Mussolini willingly moved into the orbit of the Third Reich and he permitted financial and physical resources to be deployed on a scale which severely diminished Italian military effectiveness in the Second World War. Given the sheer scale of Mussolini's involvement in Spain, fighting a full-scale external war, it is remarkable how relatively cursory is its treatment at the hands ofhistorians. 4 It is perhaps understandable that there has been little evaluation of the Italian contribution to Franco's victory since it did not suit Francoist historians to seek explanations for the Caudillo's success other than his own genius and, since 1945, Italian historians have not been inclined to dwell on Mussolini's few triumphs in terms of military aggression. The precise calculation of the financial and military costs to Italy of the Duce's Spanish entanglement is a difficult subject which has 3 There is no basis for the assertion of Denis Mack Smith, Mussolini's Roman Empire (London: Longman, 1976), 99, that Mussolini made his decision 'Only when he heard that the Germans had agreed to assist'. 4 Maxwell H.

The second concerns the reasons, including Spanish and German pressures, for the escalation of Italian commitment. The assumptions made by the bulk of the extant historiography are that the initial Italian commitment to Spain was partly a response to reports that French aircraft and munitions were being sent to the Spanish Republic and partly an ideological anti-Communist commitment to preventing the Soviet Union gaining a foothold in the Mediterranean. It is further accepted that the decision was delayed only until the arrival of an emissary, the Spanish Monarchist Antonio Goicoechea, who could confirm the links beween the 1936 uprising and an earlier agreement made by Mussolini in 1934 to assist the Spanish Right to overthrow the Second Republic. 5 Generale Mario Montanari, 'L'impegno italiano nella guerra di Spagna', in Memorie Storiche Militari 1980 (Rome: Ufficio Storico dello Stato Maggiore dell'Esercito, 1981), 121-52; Lucio Ceva, 'Influence de la guerre d'Espagne sur l'armement et les conceptions d'emploi de !'aviation de l'Italie Fasciste', in Fondation pour les Etudes de Defence N ationale, Adaptation de l'arme aerienne aux confiits contemporains et processus d'independance des armees de l'Air des origines a la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale (Paris: Service Historique de l'Armee de l'Air, 1985), 191-99; Lucio Ceva, 'L'evoluzione dei materiali bellici in ltalia', in L'ltalia e la politica di potenza in Europa (1938-40), ed.

The widespread currency of this version owes much to the existence of a convenient and colourful document containing Goicoechea's own fanciful account of how, on 25 July 1936, he persuaded Ciano to release the Italian assistance which he had negotiated in March 1934.11 In fact, Goicoechea had little to do with the Duce's intervention in Spain. Nor was that initiative the fruit of a rash determination to take on both France and Russia in the Mediterranean. Rather it came as the culmination of a complex· and anything but spontaneous decision-making process. Ultimately, the long-term commitment would become as personal and capricious as other initiatives by Mussolini, but the original decision was influenced by evaluation of information and pressures from various sources. The input to be considered consisted of the requests and accompanying claims of several Spanish emissaries, of reports from Italian representatives in Spain and Spanish Morocco regarding the likely outcome of the conflict, of information from Italian Embassies in London, Paris and Moscow- but not Berlin - 12 about the likely reaction to the Spanish conflict of Britain, 7 Joaquin Arraras, Historia de la Cruzada espanola, 8 vols, 36 tomos, (Madrid: Ediciones Espafiolas, 1939-43), III, 126. 8 Renzo de Felice, Mussolini il duce: lo stato totalitario 1936-1940 (Turin: Einaudi, 1981), 365. 9 Giordano Bruno Guerri, Galeazzo Ciano: una vita 1903-1944 (Milan: Bompiani, 1979), 227-29. 10 John F.

Not until 4 August was there any interchange of information about intervention.\n\nMUSSOLINI'S SPANISH ADVENTURE: FROM LIMITED RISK TO WAR\n\n25\n\nFrance and Russia, and, to a much lesser extent, of the views of important elements of the Italian establishment, the hierarchy of the Fascist Party, the Church and the Armed Forces. In the first couple of days, there was little hard information reaching Rome about the situation in Spain. Along with most of the diplomatic corps, the Italian Ambassador, Orazio Pedrazzi, had already taken up residence in his summer quarters in the elegant Basque resort of San Sebastian. In the wake of news that the uprising in Madrid had been defeated and the most effective rebel troops isolated in Morocco, Pedrazzi was deeply pessimistic. He departed rapidly to an hotel in St Jean de Luz on the other side of the frontier. The first gloomy reports that he managed to get through to Rome did nothing to incline Mussolini to intervene. 13 Pedrazzi's predecessor, Raffaele Guariglia, also went to St Jean de Luz in order to get his Spanish fiancee out of San Sebastian and was so negatively impressed by the uphill task facing the military rebels that he sent a pessimistic report to Rome along with an hysterical claim that the Republic was receiving massive assistance from France. 14 The first request for Italian help for the Spanish military rebels was carried to Rome by Luis Bolin, the correspondent in England of the Monarchist newspaper ABC. Bolin had chartered, and flown as far as Casablanca in, the De Havilland Dragon Rapide which was to go on to the Canary Islands to take Franco to Morocco. When the aircraft stopped at Casablanca on the return, Bolin joined Franco on the last stage of his journey to Tetuan in Spanish Morocco. On arrival, it was made clear that the ferocious Army of Mrica, with its 47,000 well-armed and well-trained men, was effectively blockaded in Mrica by the Spanish fleet now in the hands of its loyal Republican crews. Franco swiftly instructed Bolin to go to Rome to seek help. He gave him a sheet of paper containing the cryptic message 'I 13 Pedrazzi to MAE, 18 July 1936, Archivio Storico del Ministero degli Affari Esteri (ASMAE), Politica, Spagna, busta 11, telegrama 173; 20 July 1936, ASMAE, Spagna Fondo di Guerra (SFG), b.1; Jose Ignacio Escobar, Asi empez6 (Madrid: G. del Toro, 1974), 65-66; Coverdale, Italian Intervention, 68-69. 14 Raffaele Guariglia, Ricordi 1922-1946 (Naples: Edizioni Scientifiche Italiane, 1949), 325.

When Bolin asked what kind of aircraft and supplies, Franco added a scribbled footnote in pencil '12 bombers, 3 fighters with bombs (and bombing equipment) of from 50 to 100 kilos. One thousand 50-kilo bombs and 100 more weighing about 500 kilos'. Bolin was to get further authorization for his mission from General Jose Sanju:rjo Sacanell, the nominal head of the military uprising, who was in Lisbon. On 20 July, armed with another signature, Bolin flew in the Dragon Rapide from Lisbon to Biarritz, where he spent the evening in the company of the Conde de los Andes (Francisco Moreno y Zulueta) and the Marques de Luca de Tena, the owner of ABC. Andes telephoned the exiled Spanish King Alfonso XIII who was on holiday in Czechoslovakia. He agreed to help in persuading the Fascist authorities to grant the necessary military assistance. The Dragon Rapide took Bolin to Marseilles on the morning of 21 July whence he continued his journey by commercial aircraft. He arrived in a hot and muggy Rome later the same afternoon only to find his first efforts to gain entrance to the Palazzo Venezia rebuffed by a good-natured guard. 15 That evening, Bolin received a telephone call from Alfonso XIII announcing that his equerry, the Marques de Viana, was leaving for Rome with a letter of introduction. On the following day, 22 July, accompanied by Viana and armed with the letter from the King, Bolin secured a meeting with the Spanish-speaking Ministro degli Mfari Esteri, Galeazzo Ciano.16 It was the Spaniards' good fortune that Mussolini had himself relinquished the post of Ministro degli Affari Esteri barely six weeks earlier on 9 June and appointed his son-in-law. The dismissal of his Under-Secretary at the Ministero degli Affari Esteri, the cautious anti-German (and therefore) pro-Austrian Fulvio Suvich, represented an abandonment of his 15 Daily Express, 26 June 1938; Luis Bolin, Spain: The Vital Years (Philadelphia: J.

The thirty-four year-old Ciano was something of a lightweight- handsome and quick-witted but more given to the social pleasures of the 'notte romana' than to long hours with diplomatic papers. He came to the post after being Minister of Press and Propaganda and a spell in Ethiopia at the head of the Squadriglia La Disperata. It was assumed that he owed his preferment to the fact that he was the son of the influential Fascist Party hierarch, Admiral Costanzo Ciano, and, more importantly, to his marriage in 1930 to Mussolini's daughter, Edda. Mussolini's own sons, Bruno and Vittorio, had shown little political talent and the Duce was mistrustful of the more intelligent members of the Fascist hierarchy. Accordingly, his benevolence towards Ciano made it perhaps inevitable that his son-in-law should harbour ambitions of one day succeeding the Duce. Certainly, familiarity with his father-in-law had intensified his tendency to arrogance and to precipitate decision-making.17 Ciano had helped popularize the idea that the Abyssinian war had made Italy again a great power. His promotion was seen in the diplomatic corps as representing a fascistization of the Palazzo Chigi. He believed that his mission was to make Italian foreign policy fully Fascist. He was determined not to fall into the sin perceived as having been committed by Dino Grandi, Undersecretary from May 1925 to September 1929 and then Minister until July 1932, of letting the traditional career diplomats blunt his Fascist thrust. In fact, if Grandi had a Fascist thrust, it had been blunted more by the realities of the Great Power relationships within which he had to function. Henceforth, ambassadors and other diplomats would not be permitted to speak directly with the Duce. The British Ambassador, Sir Eric Drummond, commented 'In future, heads of missions will have to approach Signor Mussolini through the 17 Yvon de Begnac, Palazzo Venezia: storia di un regime (Rome: Editrice La Rocca, 1950), 571-84; Guerri, Ciano, 159-85; Mario Donosti, Mussolini e !'Europa: la politica estera fascista (Rome: Edizioni Leonardo, 1945), 43-44; Giorgio Pini and Duilio Susmel, Mussolini: l'uomo e !'opera, 4 vols (Firenze: La Fenice, 1953-55), III, 357. For an incident which showed the sexual decadence of Ciano, see Jose Antonio Gir6n de Velasco, Si la memoria no me falla (Barcelona: Editorial Planeta, 1994), 46.\n\n28\n\nPAUL PRESTON\n\nchannel of a young and inexperienced man'. Drummond also quoted an Italian observer as perceiving Ciano as 'another diaphragm between Mussolini and the world'.18 Within a year of taking up the post, the Count would boast to Rudolf Hess that 'in Italy, the most Fascist-minded Ministry is the Foreign Ministry'. In private, he would lament the time it took 'to conquer the Palazzo Chigi' saying 'only I know what a struggle I have to make these goats keep step to the Fascist march'.19 He was exaggerating for the benefit of Hess- the career diplomats had often not been able to restrain Mussolini before 1936 and the Ministry itself was not entirely opposed to the Duce's expansionism. Nevertheless, a process of greater fascistization would be carried out by means of the Gabinetto, an inner cabinet staffed by like-minded young Fascists and headed by the one-time head of propaganda services, Ottavio De Peppo. The head of his personal secretariat ('capo della segreteria particolare del ministro'), and deputy to De Peppo, was his close friend, Filippo Anfuso. Mussolini's first Ambassador to Franco, Roberto Cantalupo, later bitterly described the Gabinetto as 'a court of young gentlemen with too many expectations, sick with snobbery, ambitious, very cultured but untrained'. Experienced Previously, functionaries were by-passed and humiliated. Mussolini's tendency to ill-considered daring was slightly inhibited by the weight of diplomatic input that he encountered in the Ministry. Henceforth, there would be a tendency for foreign policy to be concocted out of his whims and the encouragement of the easily enthused Ciano.20 18 Drummond to Eden, 12 June 1936, R3491/241/22, in British Documents on Foreign Affairs Part II, Series F, vol. 12 (Washington: University Publications of America, 1992), 60-"
