Foreword In the foreword to Volume I of tliis edition of The Europa Year Book it was pointed out that there is still as great a need for international knowledge and communication now as there was in 1926, when the first edition of The Europa Year Book was published. This is especially true of the countries in this volume, with the increasing power of the so- called 'Third World’ in international affairs and, more recently, the beginning of a thaw in East-West relations and the emergence of China as a world power. Whether for commercial, academic or general purposes, the present volume aims at providing information for the promotion of this international understanding. This year, one new chapter has been added, for the newly independent territory of Fiji, while the former Republic of Southern Yemen has now become the Democratic People’s Republic of the Yemen. The task of updating and gathering new information was hampered this year by a prolonged postal strike in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, every effort has been made to maintain our standard of accuracy with the most up-to-date information, further improved by the inclusion of an addenda of the very latest changes and events. Once again, we are ex- tremely grateful to all those organizations and individuals whose generous contributions have helped us in the revision of The Europa Year Book.

Its neighbours arc to the north the Soviet Union, to the west Iran, to the east China and to the cast and south Pakistan. The climate varies sharply between the highlands and lowlands; the temperature in the south-west in summer reaches I20°r (,iS.S°c) and in the winter in the Hindu Kush mountains of the north-cast falls far below zero. The two main languages arc Pakhto (Paslitn) and Dari Persian. With the exception of small minorities of Hindus, Sikhs and Jews, all Afghans arc Muslims, almost go per cent of them of the Sunni sect. The flag consists of black, red and green bands bearing symbolic emblems. The capital is Kabul. Recent History During both wars Afghanistan was neutral and is now a staunch advocate of the policy of non-alignment, accepting economic assistance from both East and West. Afglian-Pakistan trade and diplomatic relations were suspended between 1961 and 1963 over the long, and still unsettled, Pashtunistan dispute concerning Afghanistan’s support for an autonomous area for the Pathan tribes living in the north-west of Pakistan. The ten-year administration of Sardar Daud was followed by the administrations of Dr. M. Yusuf (1963-65), M. II. Mai- wandwal (1965-67) and the present Prime Minister, N. A. Etemadi. A liberal constitution was promulgated in 1964 and parliamentary elections have been held in October 1965 and August-Scptcmbcr 1969, although no political parties exist. Much political activity takes the form of radical student unrest; in the spring of 197° this was countered by conservative Muslim demonstrations in Kabul. Government Under a new Constitution approved in 1964 the prime legislative body is a bicameral Parliament, elected for four years. The Lower House (House of the People) is elected by universal secret ballot; some members of the Upper House (House of Elders) are appointed by the King and by the provincial councils. Each of the 29 provinces has a Consultative Council presided over by a Governor. Provincial Governors are directly responsible to the Minister of the Interior. The Prime Minister is nominated by the King, who also approves the Cabinet Ministers appointed by the Prime Minister. Defence . , Every able-bodied Afghan has to serve two years m the Army, which numbers 150,000 men. Its equipment and training are very largely provided by the Soviet Union. The Afghan Air Force is equipped with supersonic jet air- craft. Police security forces come under the Ministry of the Interior. Economic Affairs Agriculture remains the mainstay of the economy, in terms of both production and employment. About two- thirds of agricultural production is at subsistence level. Roughly a sixth, comprising wool, karakul skins, cotton and fruit, is exported, but it has recently been necessary to import quantities of foodstufls, notably wheat. There are known deposits of petroleum, iron ore (with estimated reserves of over 2,000 million tons) and other minerals, but commercial exploitation is limited at present to coal, salt and lapis lazuli. The discovery of over 60,000 million cubic metres of natural gas in northern Afghanistan holds promise for the development of the uncxploitcd minerals, and the increasing export of natural gas to the U.S.S.It., started in 1967, will have an important impact on the eco- nomy. Existing sources of energy are imported petroleum (mainly from the U.S.S.R.), hydroelectricity, coal and wood. Industry accounts for only about 5 per cent of domestic production. Major industries arc cotton textiles, cement and the processing of agricultural products, but among the limited consumer industries hand-woven car- pets are very valuable as export items. Over onc-tliird of exports go to the U.S.S.R. under barter contracts, about a quarter to India and Pakistan under bilateral trade agreements, and the remainder is sold in Western markets for convertible currencies. Imports are greatly in excess of exports, and Afghanistan is depen- dent on the foreign aid she receives mainly from the U.S.S.R. American aid has diminished in recent years, but has largely been replaced by assistance from China, France and Federal Germany. Foreign aid plays a major part in financing the Third Five-Year Plan (1967-71). Transport and Communications Afghanistan is a land-locked country and the most convenient access to the sea lies through Pakistan. There are no railways. The United States and the Soviet Union have helped to build all-weather highways connecting the main towns, and a network of asphalted highways covers the country. A road link between Kabul and the northern provinces through the Hindu Kush was opened in 1964. There are internal and international air services and water traffic on the River Oxus. Social Welfare Government officials in the main towns enjoy national health insurance and all officials are entitled to an Old Age Pension. Most private companies have their own doctors and hospitals. There are 63 public hospitals. Disabled people are looked after in Social Welfare Centres in the provincial capitals. Education Primary education is free, and compulsory wherever possible; by 1968 there were 497,879 children in over 2,500 schools. The Government aims to provide basic educational facilities to 50 per cent of the population by 1980. There are two Universities. Tourism These are Afghanistan’s principal attractions: Bamian with its high statue of Buddha and thousands of painted 1 AFGHANISTAN— (Statistical Survey) caves. Bandi Amir with its suspended lakes. The Blue Mosque of Mazar. The walls of Kabul. Herat with its Grand Mosque and minarets. The towns of Kandahar and Girishk. Balkh (ancient Bactria) “Mother of Cities’ in the north. Bagram, Hadda and Surkh Kotal (of interest to archaeologists). And, finally, the high mountains of the Hindu Kush. Visas are required to enter Afghanistan for nationals of all countries. Sport The traditional sports are wrestling and buzkashi, a game played by teams of hundreds of horsemen. Athletics and ball games are sponsored by the Ministry of Education. Public Holidays 1971 : May 7 (Birth of the Prophet Muhammad), August 23-25 (Independence), October 14 (H.M. the King's Birth- day), October 15 (Nejat Anniversary), November 19 (Id el Fitr). 1972 : January 26 (Id el Adha), February 16 (New Year). Weights and Measures The Metric System has been officially adopted but traditional weights are still used. One \"seer” equals 16 pounds. Currency and Exchange Rates The principal currency unit is the Afghani which is divided into 100 puls. Coins: 1, 2, 5, 25, 50 Afghanis. Notes: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1,000 Afghanis. Exchange rate: 200 Afghanis = £1 sterling 84 Afghanis = $1 U.S. STATISTICAL SURVEY AREA AND POPULATION Total Area ( sq. km.) Cultivated Area ( sq. km.) Population ( 1969 est.)

The climate on the coast is temperate, becoming more extreme in the Atlas mountains immediately to the south. The Sahara, further south, is hot and arid. The languages spoken are French and Arabic. The Muslim faith pre- dominates; the Catholic minority greatly declined when most French settlers departed. The flag consists of a red crescent and star against a white and green field divided vertically. The capital is Algiers. Recent History Formerly a part of the French Republic, Algeria fought a civil war from 1954 to 1962. The nationalist forces came to be led by the Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN), based on Tunisia. In 1962, by the Agreement of Evian, self-government was ceded by France. There was provision to maintain French bases in Algeria and for continued French aid to the territory. In the autumn of 1963 there was a brief border war with Morocco but a cease-fire agreement was soon reached through the intervention of the Organization of African Unity. In June 1965 the former President Ben Bella was deposed in a bloodless coup d’ Hal and Col. Houari Boumedienne assumed control of the state as President of a Revolutionary Council. Relations with France have since deteriorated, particularly during the winter of 1970-71 when prolonged negotiations about the French oil interests in Algeria took place. Mean- while strong links with the Soviet Union have been formed. Algeria has taken a militant Arab nationalist position since independence, notably over Palestine, and Col. Boumedienne is now generally thought to be amongst the principal leaders of the Arab world. Government Under the 1963 Constitution Algeria is a one-party state with strong executive powers vested in the President. The National Assembly is the main legislative body, elected for five years by universal adult suffrage. The present Assembly was elected in September 1964. Since June 1965 the func- tions of Presidency have been exercised by the Revolution- ary Council. Communal and departmental assemblies have been functioning since 1967 and 1969 respectively; the government announced a general election for a national assembly in 1970, but none was in fact held. Defence The National Popular Army, formerly FLN’s military wing, is now Algeria’s official army. The estimated strength of the armed forces is 65.000. Both France and the Soviet Union provide military equipment and training. Early in 1968 France handed back its major naval base at Mers-el- Kebir. Compulsory national service for both sexes was officially introduced in 1969, but many recruits will be mainly employed on public service projects. Economic Affairs Algeria is predominantly an agricultural country, but it is also rich in minerals, notably iron ore, phosphates, oil and natural gas. An industrialization programme based on these resources is now under way. Oil production reached 46 million tons in 1969. Since 1964 liquefied natural gas has been exported in quantity to the U.K. and France, and a large American contract is being negotiated. With the exception of oil and gas, production in Algeria declined after the change of regime, but many sectors recovered after 1965. However, the economy continues to be heavily bol- stered by external aid. Most foreign firms have been nationalized; autogestion, a form of management by the workers, has been tried out in industry but is now being replaced by orthodox state capitalism. Wine, a major ex- port to France, is now also exported in quantity to the U.S.S.R., which is building a steel plant at Annaba. In 1969 Algeria joined the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In February 1971 Algeria took over 51 per cent interest in the French oil companies’ local operations, having previously nationalized all other oil companies. Transport and Communications There are 2,500 miles of railway, excellent coastal roads and good major roads over the mountains and into the Sahara. Algiers is one of the principal ports on the Mediter- ranean. There are internal and international air services. Social Welfare The unemployment situation has been improved by the creation of nearly half a million jobs in public works and by the opening of employment agencies. Some 30 per cent of the labour force are without work and many more are underemployed. Public works projects attempt to absorb some of the unemployed; workers are provided with food but otherwise unpaid. In 1968 an agreement was signed with France allowing 35,000 Algerian workers into France each year. Education In the 1970-71 school year primary schools enrolled two million children, and secondary schools 225,000. Instruc- tion in Arabic is being gradually extended with the aim of eventually replacing French. Adult education is being expanded — 75 per cent of the population over 10 is illi- terate. A Four- Year Literacy Programme has been launched with the aim of teaching a million adults to read by 1973. Many teachers (over 5,000) are French nationals whose salaries arc largely paid for by France. There are universities at Algiers and Oran, and a university centre at Constantine. Tourism The chief attractions for tourists are the Mediterranean coast, the Atlas mountains and the Desert, and the climate. An ambitious programme for the expansion of tourist facilities began in 1968 with the object of attracting over 400,000 tourists a year by 1973. 11 ALGERIA— (Introductory Visas are not required to visit Algeria by nationals of tbe following countries: Andorra, Bahrain, Denmark, 1'inland, France and the French overseas territories, Guinea, Guyana, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Liechten- stein, Mauritius, Morocco, Norway, Oman, San Marino, Spain, Spanish Sahara, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Republic, Yemen and Yugoslavia.
