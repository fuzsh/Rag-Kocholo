Rio Grande do Norte is a small Brazilian state with a rate of leprosy lower than other areas in the same region, for unknown reasons. Objectives We present here a review based on the analysis of a database of registered leprosy cases in Rio Grande do Norte state, comparing leprosy's geographic distribution among municipalities with local socio-economic and public health indicators and with historical documents about human migration in this Brazilian region. Results The current distribution of leprosy in Rio Grande do Norte did not show correlation with socio-economic or public health indicators at the municipal level, but it appears related to economically emerging municipalities 100 years ago, with spread facilitated by railroads and train stations. Drought-related migratory movements which occurred from this state to leprosy endemic areas within the same period may be involved in the introduction of leprosy and with its present distribution within Rio Grande do Norte. Conclusions Leprosy may disseminate slowly, over many decades in certain circumstances, such as in small cities with few cases. This is a very unusual situation currently and a unique opportunity for epidemiologic studies of leprosy as an emerging disease.

Maia U.M., Jaffe R., Carvalho A.T. & Imperatriz-Fonseca V.L. [Meliponiculture in Rio Grande do Norte.] Meliponicultura no Rio Grande do Norte. Revista Brasileira de Medicina VeterinÃ¡ria, 37(4:327-333, 2015. Departamento de Biologia, Faculdade de Filosofia, CiÃªncias e Letras de RibeirÃ£o Preto, Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, Avenida Bandeirantes, 3900, Monte Alegre, RibeirÃ£o Preto, SP 14040-901, Brasil. E-mail: ummaia@usp.br This study aimed to assess the current status of stingless bee beekeeping (meliponiculture in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, with the aid of structured questionnaires made during visits to beekeepers. The results were compared with a previous census made in the state and with a similar study from Australia. Meliponiculture in Rio Grande do Norte is still informal and little standardized. The activity has grown in recent years considering the mean number of nests per beekeeper. Most apiaries are formed of up to 50 colonies, usually distributed in the backyards of homes. Twelve species of stingless bees were reared in the state, and the most common was the âJandaÃ­raâ bee (Melipona subnitida, whose honey is considered medicinal. While many beekeepers already know the importance of bees as pollinators, stingless bees are still not used for crop pollination. Compared to a recent analysis of beekeeping in Australia, meliponiculture in Brazil is more traditional, honey is the main product and the number of colonies per beekeeper is much higher. Our results highlight the need to reinforce knowledge about bees and promote specific training aimed at improving and standardizing management practices.\n\nQUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF VERNALIZATED SEMI-NOBLE GARLIC CULTIVARS IN WESTERN RIO GRANDE DO NORTE STATE, BRAZIL\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRAFAELLA RAYANE MACEDO DE LUCENA\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Garlic is a vegetable that has economic and social relevance in Brazil. Rio Grande do Norte is among the consumer states, however, despite having regions with favorable conditions for growing garlic, it depends on imports of this product to meet its demand. The introduction of cultivars that have high yield and quality, and the adjustments in vernalization technology, which is a key issue for adaptation of new cultivars, are mechanisms that can contribute to garlic revitalization in areas previously producing this vegetable. Therefore, the objective of this work was to assess the quality characteristics of semi-noble garlic cultivars subjected to different bulb-seed pre-planting vernalization periods in two counties of the Western Mesoregion of Rio Grande do Norte State (RN, Brazil. Two experiments were simultaneously conducted in Barauna RN and Governador Dix-sept Rosado RN, from April to November, 2012. A complete randomized block experimental design was used with four replications. The treatments were arranged in split-plot design, with the plots consisted of cultivars (Gigante-do-Nucleo and BRS-Hozan and subplots consisted of bulb-seed pre-planting vernalization (4Â±1Â°C periods (0, 10, 20 and 30 days. The evaluations consisted of bulb diameter, pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, total soluble sugars, reducing sugars, pungency, total solids and industrial index. The use of 10-day bulb-seed pre-planting vernalization increased the semi-noble garlic quality produced in Barauna and Governador Dix-sept Rosado. The cultivars Gigante-do-Nucleo and BRS-Hozan presented good prospects for industrialization, with good characteristics of flavor and aroma.\n\nFirst record of Chara indica and Chara zeylanica (Charophyceae, Charales, Characeae in the semiarid reservoirs the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNorma Catarina Bueno\n\n2013-09-01\n\nFull Text Available In the present study we present the first record of the macroalgaes Chara indica and Chara zeylanica for the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, and the semiarid northeastern.

Its fruits are used in animal feed and the wood may be used as piles, firewood and charcoal. The species was introduced in 1942, spreading in \"low areas\" in Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Bahia and PiauÃ­ States. This article aims to elucidate how mesquite was introduced in Rio Grande do Norte State and to understand how it was spread. It was first introduced in Rio Grande do Norte State by the introduction experiments installed at SÃ£o Miguel farm in the municipality of Angicos. The enthusiasm of technicians and researchers promoted the distribution of pods and seedlings on farms and cities in the state. In addition, there were government incentives to production, distribution and planting the species. This work aims to establish considerations to be used as historical basis on studies about this species and to consider aspects regarding current situation of this culture in Brazilian Northeast.\n\nAnti-Brucella abortus antibodies in free-ranging equids from MossorÃ³, Rio Grande do Norte, BrazilAnticorpos anti-Brucella abortus em equÃ­deos errantes do municÃ­pio de MossorÃ³, Rio Grande do Norte\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nElaine Maria Seles Dorneles\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The aims of the present study were (i to determine the occurrence and (ii to evaluate possible factors associated with infection by Brucella abortus in free-ranging equids from MossorÃ³, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.

Two main types of granitic rocks have been identified in this batholith. Dioritic inclusions occur in both of them. The predominating type is an extremely porphyritic syenogranite, which is intruded by a fine-grained monzogranite. K-feldspar megacrysts are found in both porphyritic granite and dioritic inclusions. The megacrysts long axes average around 4 cm, reaching up to 9 or 10 cm. The megacrysts are euhedral, zoned, and, sometimes, they show rapakivi texture. Flow textures and tuillage are common, but irregularly distributed. The K-feldspar megacrysts contain inclusions of plagioclase, biotite, quartz, hornblende, sphene, and apatite. These inclusions are concentrically arranged and parallel to the megacrysts zones. The included minerals are generally smaller than the same minerals in the groundmass. Microprobe analyses and X-ray difraction studies show that the megacrysts of both facies are similar in composition, containing around 90% of orthoclase. Taking into account the textural and compositional aspects, it is concluded that the megacrysts of porphyritic granite and dioritic inclusions are phenocrysts and not porphyroblasts.

In this region, gold is produced, even today, by artisanal methods that use Hg to increase the extraction efficiency with no control of Hg release to water systems and the atmosphere. In this context, the Gualaxo do Norte River is of particular interest; its springs are located in the Doce River basin, an important Brazilian basin that supplies water for 3.5 million people. The main goal of this work was to quantify and speciate the Hg in the sediments of the Gualaxo do Norte River using a direct mercury analyzer and gas chromatography-pyrolysis-atomic fluorescence detection system. Statistical analyses consisted of principal component analysis, aiming to assess interactions among elements and species and to group the variables in factors affecting the properties of sediment. The results show that total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (CH 3 Hg + ) concentrations in samples ranged from 209 to 1207Â Î¼gÂ kg -1 and from 0.07 to 1.00Â Î¼gÂ kg -1 , respectively (methylation percentages from 0.01 to 0.27%). Thermal desorption analysis showed that mercury is mainly present in the oxidized form, and correlation analyses pointed to a relationship between THg and MnO, indicating that manganese can oxidize and/or adsorb Hg. Together, MO and CH 3 Hg + are important parameters in the third principal component, indicating the influence of OM on the methylation process. This first investigation on Hg methylation in this small-scale gold mining area points to the possibility of Hg bioaccumulation and to the need of better understanding the biogeochemical cycle of Hg in this area. Samples were collected in 2012, prior to the 2015 FundÃ£o Dam disaster.

In this area, previous works has identified sanukitoids (â¼2.87 Ga), (quartz) diorites of BADR affinity and undifferentiated leucogranites, with charnockites cross-cutting the other granitoids. New geological mapping data allowed to differentiate three new groups of granitoids: (i) biotite monzogranites (BMzG); (ii) epidote-biotite granodiorites (EBGd); and (iii) porphyritic granitoids (pGrt). Thus, this paper aims to define their classification, nature, formation processes and deformation aspects, and discuss the relations between plutonism and deformation for the Ourilandia do Norte granitoids. The petrographic data showed that each one of these groups can be subdivided into two facies. The BMzG is differentiated into equigranular (eBMzG) and heterogranular (hBMzG) and the EBGd into heterogranular (hEBGd) and sparsely porphyritic (spTEBGd). These granitoids constitute two batholiths separated by a rock strip of sanukitoid and BADR affinities. Both are largely dominated by BMzG rocks, with less abundant EBGd lenses. The pGrt is individualized in porphyritic granodiorites (pBHGd) and trondhjemites (pEBTd), which occur as smaller bodies. Structurally, the central portions these plutons represent lower strain domains, while their borders are marked by large-scale shear zones, where occur submagmatic and mylonitic fabrics of ENE-WSW main direction and subvertical dip, respectively. The meso- and microstructural data indicate that the rocks studied are syn-to late-tectonic and were affected by high temperature deformation (>500 Â°C) and low differential stress, in a sinistral transpression regime, indicating that both fabrics are related to the a same deformational event.

It begins where the Rio Piranhas leaves the crystalline Precambrian rocks to flow across the outcrop of sedimentary rocks. The area considered in this report extends northward for about 45 kilometers; it is terminated arbitrarily where encroachment by sea water has contaminated the aquifer and imparted a disagreeable saline taste to the water in it. The boundary was not determined in the field, however, for lack of special equipment. Part of the extensive uplands on either side of the valley are included. This makes the total area approximately 2,500 square kilometers. The largest town, Acu, had a population of about 8,000 in 1960. The area is considered to be part of the Drought Polygon of northeast Brazil because the precipitation, although averaging 448 millimeters annually at Acu, varies widely from year to year and often is deficient for many months. The precipitation has been supplemented by use of irrigation wells, but irrigated agriculture is not yet far advanced, and the quantities of water used in irrigation are small. Geologically, the area consists of basement crystalline rocks (Precambrian), a wedge of sedimentary rocks thickening northward (Cretaceous), and alluvial sediments constituting a narrow band in the bottom of the valley (Alluvium and terrace deposits). The crystalline rocks contain water mainly in fractures and, in general, are impermeable. The sedimentary rocks of Cretaceous age comprise two units: a thick but fine-grained sandstone grading upward into siltstone and shale (Acu Sandstone), and limestone and dolomite with an included shale zone (Jandaira Limestone). The sandstone especially and the limestone to a lesser degree are ground-water reservoirs of large capacity. The limestone has been tapped at several places, but the sandstone and its contained water are practically untested and, hence, imperfectly\n\nTropidurus semitaeniatus (Squamata: Tropiduridae as seed disperser of the plant Commiphora leptophloeos (Burseraceae in the Caatinga of Northeastern Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBarros Ribeiro, Leonardo\n\n2008-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Tropidurus semitaeniatus is broadly distributed in the rocky habitats of the caatingas of northeastern Brazil (Vanzolini et al., 1980.

Before that time, the regional public policies did not see tourism as a strategic and developmental activity in Brazil and also did not evaluate the impacts arising from the real estate deals proper for summer vacation. In this paper, we propose an investigation on the diffusion models and ideas about the global and local tourism and summer vocations activities in coastal areas, focusing on the coast of the Northeastern region of Brazil. The territorial arrangement promoted by the construction of tourist-estate on the coast of Bahia, CearÃ¡, Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte were the focus of the research, as they are the largest recipients of these types of properties for leisure. Regarding the Methodologly, the study was conducted in three stages: bibliographical survey, secondary data analysis, along with the right public bodies and the preparation of cartograms that enabled the understanding of logical installation of these projects in the main cities of the Northeast region. The coast designed as recreational space is a spatiality predominantly in the main cities of the Northeast region of Brazil.

M.; HernÃ¡ndez-Lasheras, J.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nExtreme wave climate in the Gulf of Mexico is determined by tropical cyclones and winds from the Central American Cold Surges, locally referred to as Nortes. While hurricanes can have catastrophic effects, extreme waves and storm surge from Nortes occur several times a year, and thus have greater impacts on human activities along the Mexican coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the constant impacts from Nortes, there is no available classification that relates their characteristics (e.g. pressure gradients, wind speed), to the associated coastal impacts. This work presents a first approximation to characterize and classify Nortes, which is based on the assumption that the derived wave energy synthetizes information (i.e. wind intensity, direction and duration) of individual Norte events as they pass through the Gulf of Mexico. First, we developed an index to identify Nortes based on surface pressure differences of two locations. To validate the methodology we compared the events identified with other studies and available Nortes logs. Afterwards, we detected Nortes from the 1986/1987, 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 seasons and used their corresponding wind fields to derive the wave energy maps using a numerical wave model. We used the energy maps to classify the events into groups using manual (visual) and automatic classifications (principal component analysis and k-means). The manual classification identified 3 types of Nortes and the automatic classification identified 5, although 3 of them had a high degree of similarity. The principal component analysis indicated that all events have similar characteristics, as few components are necessary to explain almost all of the variance. The classification from the k-means indicated that 81% of analyzed Nortes affect the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, while a smaller percentage affects the northern Gulf of Mexico and even less affect the western Caribbean.\n\nInsecticide resistance in Aedes aegypti populations from CearÃ¡, Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGoulart Marilia OF\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Background Organophosphates and pyrethroids are used widely in Brazil to control Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue viruses, under the auspices of the National Programme for Dengue Control. Resistance to these insecticides is widespread throughout Brazil. In CearÃ¡ the vector is present in 98% of districts and resistance to temephos has been reported previously. Here we measure resistance to temephos and the pyrethroid cypermethrin in three populations from CearÃ¡ and use biochemical and molecular assays to characterise resistance mechanisms. Results Resistance to temephos varied widely across the three studied populations, with resistance ratios (RR95 of 7.2, 30 and 192.7 in Juazeiro do Norte, Barbalha and Crato respectively. The high levels of resistance detected in Barbalha and Crato (RR95 â¥ 30 imply a reduction of temephos efficacy, and indeed in simulated field tests reduced effectiveness was observed for the Barbalha population. Two populations (Crato and Barbalha were also resistant to cypermethrin, whilst Juazeiro do Norte showed only an altered susceptibility. The Ile1011Met kdr mutation was detected in all three populations and Val1016Ile in Crato and Juazeiro do Norte. 1011Met was significantly associated with resistance to cypermethrin in the Crato population. Biochemical tests showed that only the activity of esterases and GSTs, among the tested detoxification enzymes, was altered in these populations when compared with the Rockefeller strain. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that two A. aegypti populations from CearÃ¡ are under strong selection pressure by temephos, compromising the field effectiveness of this organophosphate. Our results also provide evidence that the process of reducing resistance to this larvicide in the field is difficult and slow and may require more than seven years for reversal. In addition, we show resistance to cypermethrin in two of the three populations studied, and for the first time\n\nGeochronology Intermediary Laboratory implantation at the Rio Grande do Norte Federal University: the dating of the Serrinha Granitoid (RN) and the correlate Brasiliana extensional deformation; Implantacao do Laboratorio Intermediario de Geocronologia na UFRN: a datacao do granitoide de Serrinha (RN) e da deformacao extensional brasiliana correlata\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMacedo, Maria Helena F.; Sa, Emanuel F.

Por meio de um estudo de corte transversal foram analisados 81 exames, atravÃ©s do mÃ©todo de SedimentaÃ§Ã£o EspontÃ¢nea (MÃ©todo de Hoffman et al., 1934. Foi constatada positividade em 72,8% dos idosos, predominando o monoparasitismo (43,2%. Os helmintos foram os mais freqÃ¼entes (70,4%, destacando-se: Ascaris lumbricoides (35,2%, Trichuris trichiura (16,0%, Ancylostoma duodenale (9,0% e Strongyloides stercoralis (9,0%. Dentre os protozoÃ¡rios (29,5%, a ocorrÃªncia de Entamoeba coli foi de 18,2%, GiÃ¡rdia lamblia de 7,0% e Entamoeba histolytica 4,5%. NÃ£o houve associaÃ§Ã£o estatisticamente significativa entre sexo e grau de parasitismo e entre faixas etÃ¡rias e condiÃ§Ã£o parasitÃ¡ria. Estes resultados evidenciam um quadro de alta prevalÃªncia de parasitas intestinais nesta populaÃ§Ã£o e discordam dos reportados por outros pesquisadores quando afirmam que a intensidade da infestaÃ§Ã£o por parasitas diminui na idade avanÃ§ada. Os achados anteriores exigem das autoridades governamentais medidas de controle e educaÃ§Ã£o para melhorar a qualidade de vida desses idosos, considerando a grave repercussÃ£o que esses parasitas tem no estado nutricional dos gerontes de baixa renda.A study was carried out to determine the prevalence of enteroparasites attacking elderly people living in a riverside city of the Municipal district of Nova Olinda do Norte, Amazonas State Brazil.

A study was conducted in a rural area of the municipality of Limoeiro do Norte - CE, northeastern Brazil, aiming to determine the prevalence of T. cruzi infection. Of the inhabitants, 52% were examined, among whom 2.6% (4/154 were seropositive in at least two serological tests. All seropositive individuals were older than 50 years, farmers, with a low education and a family income of less than three minimum wages. Active surveillance may be an alternative for early detection of this disease.\n\nNote on the fisheries and biology of the golden crab (Chaceon fenneri off the northern coast of Brazil Nota sobre la biologÃ­a y la pesca del cangrejo dorado (Chaceon fenneri frente a la costa norte de Brasil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTiago Barros Carvalho\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The occurrence of golden crabs (Chaceon fenneri off the northern coast of Brazil was first reported in 2001. Since then, a few companies and boats have exploited this resource. In the state of CearÃ¡, one company has been fishing for these crabs with a single boat since 2003. The production and fishing effort of this company indicated a decrease in the number of trips and total catches per year. Data collected on one trip in 2006 showed that the CPUE was highest at over 650 m depth. As registered for other geryonid crabs, C. fenneri was segregated by sex along the northern slope of Brazil. Male crabs were significantly larger than females, presenting an isometric relationship between carapace width and length and an allometric relationship between carapace width and body weight.La presencia de cangrejos dorados (Chaceon fenneri frente a la costa norte de Brasil fue primeramente descrita en 2001. Desde entonces, algunas embarcaciones y compaÃ±Ã­as se han dedicado a explotar este recurso. En el Estado de CearÃ¡, una sola compaÃ±Ã­a ha estado pescando estos crustÃ¡ceos desde el aÃ±o 2003 con una sola embarcaciÃ³n. Se presenta la producciÃ³n y esfuerzo pesquero aplicado por esa compaÃ±Ã­a, indicando la disminuciÃ³n en el nÃºmero de viajes y captura total por aÃ±o. Registros recolectados en un viaje realizado el 2006 muestran que los mayores valores de CPUE se obtienen a profundidades mayores de 650 m. Al igual que lo registrado en otros Geryonidae, agregaciones por sexo se determinaron en C fenneri a lo largo del talud en la regiÃ³n norte de Brasil. Los machos fueron significativamente mÃ¡s grandes que las hembras, presentando una relaciÃ³n isomÃ©trica entre el ancho y longitud del caparazÃ³n; como tambiÃ©n, una relaciÃ³n alomÃ©trica entre el ancho y el peso.\n\nZika virus in Brazil and the danger of infestation by Aedes (Stegomyia mosquitoes\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCarlos Brisola Marcondes\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Zika virus, already widely distributed in Africa and Asia, was recently reported in two Northeastern Brazilian: State of Bahia and State of Rio Grande do Norte, and one Southeastern: State of SÃ£o Paulo. This finding adds a potentially noxious virus to a list of several other viruses that are widely transmitted by Aedes (Stegomyia aegypti and Aedes (Stegomyia albopictus in Brazil. The pathology and epidemiology, including the distribution and vectors associated with Zika virus, are reviewed. This review is focused on viruses transmitted by Aedes (Stegomyia mosquitoes, including dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, Mayaro, and yellow fever virus, to emphasize the risks of occurrence for these arboviruses in Brazil and neighboring countries. Other species of Aedes (Stegomyia are discussed, emphasizing their involvement in arbovirus transmission and the possibility of adaptation to environments modified by human activities and introduction in Brazil.\n\nZika virus in Brazil and the danger of infestation by Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquitoes.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMarcondes, Carlos Brisola; Ximenes, Maria de FÃ¡tima Freire de Melo\n\n2016-02-01\n\nZika virus, already widely distributed in Africa and Asia, was recently reported in two Northeastern Brazilian: State of Bahia and State of Rio Grande do Norte, and one Southeastern: State of SÃ£o Paulo.
