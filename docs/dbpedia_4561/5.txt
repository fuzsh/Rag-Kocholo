This is a list of all of the active squadrons that currently exist in the United States Marine Corps, sorted by type. Most squadrons have changed names and designations many times over the years, so they are listed by their current designation.

To see Marine Aviation units sorted by command hierarchy, see aviation combat element.

Squadron designations[]

The basic tactical and administrative unit of United States Marine Corps aviation is the squadron. Fixed-wing aircraft squadrons (heavier than air) and tiltrotor squadrons are denoted by the letter "V", which comes from the Spanish verb "volar" (to fly). Rotary wing (helicopter) squadrons use "H." Marine squadrons are always noted by the second letter "M." Squadron numbering is not linear as some were numbered in ascending order and others took numbers from the wing or the ship to which they were assigned. From 1920 to 1941, Marine flying squadrons were identified by one digit numbers. This changed on July 1, 1941 when all existing squadrons were redesignated to a three-digit system. The first two numbers were supposed to identify the squadrons parent group but with the rapid expansion during World War II and frequent transfer of squadrons this system fell apart.[1]

Rotary-Wing Aircraft[]

Marine Helicopter Squadron[]

The squadron is responsible for the helicopter transportation of the President of the United States, , Cabinet members and VIPs. In addition to its VIP transport role, it is also tasked with operational test and evaluation (OT&E) of new flight systems for Marine Corps helicopters.[2] The squadron currently flies the VH-3D Sea King and the SH-60 Seahawk. These were due to be replaced by the VH-71 Kestrel,[3] however that program was cancelled in April 2009.[4]

Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadrons[]

Heavy helicopter squadrons were first formed in 1966 when the Marine Corps began flying the heavy lift CH-53 Sea Stallion during the Vietnam War.[6] Their primary role is moving cargo and equipment with the secondary role of transferring troops ashore in an amphibious assault. Most of the squadrons have transitioned to the larger and more powerful CH-53E Super Stallion; however, three squadrons of the original Sea Stallions still remain.[7] The CH-53Es are the most powerful helicopter in the U.S. military inventory today.[8] Due to a reorganization in Marine aviation, HMH-366 was reactivated in 2008[9] at MCAS Cherry Point.[10]

The squadron trains newly designated (i.e., winged) Naval Aviators, conversion pilots, refresher pilots, and enlisted aircrew on the CH-53E Super Stallion.[17]

Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadrons[]

The Marine Corps’ light attack squadrons are composite squadrons usually made up of 18 AH-1W Cobras and 9 UH-1N Hueys. The primary missions of the Cobra is close air support, forward air control, reconnaissance and armed escort,[18] while the Huey provides airborne command and control, utility support, supporting arms coordination and medical evacuation.[19] Both airframes are due to be upgraded as part of the H-1 upgrade program which will see them get greater power, improved avionics and an 85% commonality of parts. When the aircraft are upgraded, they will have the new nomenclatures AH-1Z[20] and UH-1Y.[21][22] Due to the need for more light attack squadrons, the Marine Corps began adding new squadrons in 2008.[23] HMLA-467 and HMLA-469 activated recently.[10]

The squadron trains newly designated (i.e., winged) Naval Aviators, conversion pilots, refresher pilots, and enlisted aircrew on the AH-1W SuperCobra, the UH-1N Twin Huey, as well as transition to the newer AH-1Z Viper and UH-1Y Venom variants.[33]

Marine Medium Helicopter Squadrons[]

The Marine Corps' HMM squadrons first came to being in 1964 with the fielding of the CH-46 Sea Knight medium helicopter. They provide all-weather, day/night, night vision goggle (NVG) assault transport of combat troops, supplies, and equipment during amphibious and subsequent operations ashore. Troop assault is their primary function and the movement of supplies and equipment is secondary.[34][35] The CH-46 is currently being replaced by the MV-22B Osprey and HMM squadrons are incrementally being deactivated and coming back as VMMs.[36]

Tiltrotor Aircraft[]

Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadrons[]

Marine tiltrotor squadrons are new units operating the MV-22 Osprey with their main mission being assault support. The Osprey offers twice the speed, three times the payload, five times the range, and can fly more than twice as high as the helicopters it is replacing.[41] As the Marine Corps’ number one aviation acquisition priority, the Osprey is replacing the aging fleet of CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters and is a cornerstone of the capstone concept of Expeditionary maneuver warfare.[42] The Marine Corps is planning on transitioning two squadrons a year to the new airframe until all squadrons have made the conversion.[36][dead link]

Marine Attack Squadrons[]

After World War II, the United States Navy decided to combine all of the functions of the scout bomber, torpedo bomber and bomber torpedo communities into the Attack designation.[60] On July 22, 1946, it released Bulletin No. 46-1543, which authorized the formation of attack squadrons; however, the Marine Corps did not form any until 1952.[1] Today, Marine attack squadrons fly the AV-8B Harrier II[61] and are tasked with providing close air support, air interdiction, surveillance and escort of helicopters. Because the STOVL Harrier can operate from amphibious assault ships, expeditionary airfields and tactical remote landing sites, it provides commanders with more flexibility in providing air support.[62] The Harrier is due to be replaced by the F-35B, the STOVL version of the F-35 Lightning II.[63]

Marine Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadrons[]

VMAQ squadrons operate the EA-6B Prowler[70] and are tasked with providing electronic attack, electronic counter-countermeasures, radar jamming and suppression of enemy air defense using the AN/ALQ-99 jamming pod[71] and the AGM-88 HARM. Each of the four squadrons operates five aircraft and are land-based, although they are capable of landing on board U.S. Navy aircraft carriers.[72][73] The Marine Corps has recently solidified plans to install a next-generation jammer on the F-35 Lightning II. It has joined the EA-18G Growler as the launch platform for the jammer, which is scheduled to enter service in 2018.[74]

Marine Fighter Attack Squadrons[]

The Marine Corps' VMFA squadrons fly the single seat F/A-18A++, F/A-18C Hornet and F-35B Lightning II. Their primary role is to intercept and destroy enemy aircraft and to attack and destroy surface targets in all weather conditions. Each Hornet squadron operates 12 aircraft, while each F-35B squadron operates 16 aircraft.[79][80]

Marine All-Weather Fighter Attack Squadrons[]

The VMFA(AW) squadrons fly the two seat F/A-18D Hornet. Their primary mission is to attack and destroy surface targets, day or night, under all weather conditions; conduct multi-sensor imagery reconnaissance; provide supporting arms coordination; and intercept and destroy enemy aircraft in all weather conditions. The current F/A-18s saw their first action in Operation Desert Storm after replacing the venerable F-4 Phantom II.[79][80]

VMGR squadrons operate the KC-130 Hercules tanker/transport. Their primary missions are aerial and rapid ground refuelling, transportation of personnel and cargo to include MEDEVACs and parachute insertions, flying the airborne version of the Direct Air Support Center (DASC) and emergency resupply into unimproved landing zones.[97][98][99]

Unmanned Aerial Systems[]

Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadrons[]

VMUs operate the RQ-7B Shadow unmanned aerial system (UAS) which provides Marine ground forces with reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition. They also provide artillery spotting and can assist in search and rescue operations.[106][107] Since 2004, the VMU squadrons have also been operating the Boeing ScanEagle UAS, and has longer endurance and smaller footprint, but has a lesser camera capability with no IR pointer.[108] The Navy/Marine Corps has shown interest in the MQ-8B Fire Scout Vertical Takeoff and Landing Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTUAV),[109] which was originally developed to meet the future Tier III requirements of the Marine Corps.[110] Due to the high operational tempo of the VMU squadrons in recent years, the Marine Corps stood up VMU-3 in 2008 and VMU-4, a reserve unit, was activated in 2010 with the lineage of VMO-4.[23]
