        "text": "This is a list of all of the active squadrons that currently exist in the United States Marine Corps, sorted by type. Most squadrons have changed names and designations many times over the years, so they are listed by their current designation.\n\nTo see Marine Aviation units sorted by command hierarchy, see aviation combat element.\n\nSquadron designations[]\n\nThe basic tactical and administrative unit of United States Marine Corps aviation is the squadron. Fixed-wing aircraft squadrons (heavier than air) and tiltrotor squadrons are denoted by the letter \"V\", which comes from the Spanish verb \"volar\" (to fly). Rotary wing (helicopter) squadrons use \"H.\" Marine squadrons are always noted by the second letter \"M.\" Squadron numbering is not linear as some were numbered in ascending order and others took numbers from the wing or the ship to which they were assigned. From 1920 to 1941, Marine flying squadrons were identified by one digit numbers. This changed on July 1, 1941 when all existing squadrons were redesignated to a three-digit system. The first two numbers were supposed to identify the squadrons parent group but with the rapid expansion during World War II and frequent transfer of squadrons this system fell apart.[1]\n\nRotary-Wing Aircraft[]\n\nMarine Helicopter Squadron[]\n\nThe squadron is responsible for the helicopter transportation of the President of the United States, , Cabinet members and VIPs. In addition to its VIP transport role, it is also tasked with operational test and evaluation (OT&E) of new flight systems for Marine Corps helicopters.[2] The squadron currently flies the VH-3D Sea King and the SH-60 Seahawk. These were due to be replaced by the VH-71 Kestrel,[3] however that program was cancelled in April 2009.[4]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station HMX-1 Nighthawks 1 December 1947 Headquarters Marine Corps MCAF Quantico, VA[5]\n\nMarine Heavy Helicopter Squadrons[]\n\nHeavy helicopter squadrons were first formed in 1966 when the Marine Corps began flying the heavy lift CH-53 Sea Stallion during the Vietnam War.[6] Their primary role is moving cargo and equipment with the secondary role of transferring troops ashore in an amphibious assault. Most of the squadrons have transitioned to the larger and more powerful CH-53E Super Stallion; however, three squadrons of the original Sea Stallions still remain.[7] The CH-53Es are the most powerful helicopter in the U.S. military inventory today.[8] Due to a reorganization in Marine aviation, HMH-366 was reactivated in 2008[9] at MCAS Cherry Point.[10]\n\nThe squadron trains newly designated (i.e., winged) Naval Aviators, conversion pilots, refresher pilots, and enlisted aircrew on the CH-53E Super Stallion.[17]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station HMH-361 Flying Tigers 25 February 19 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA[11] HMH-362 Ugly Angels 30 April 1952 MAG-24, 1st MAW MCAS Kaneohe Bay, HI[12] HMH-366 Hammerheads 30 September 2008 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS Cherry Point, NC HMH-461 Iron Horse 15 March 1944 MAG-26, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[13] HMH-462 Heavy Haulers 15 April 1944 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA[14] HMH-463 Pegasus 20 July 1944 MAG-24, 1st MAW MCAS Kaneohe Bay, HI[15] HMH-464 Condors 5 April 1944 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[16] HMH-465 Warhorse 1 December 1981 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA HMH-466 Wolfpack 30 November 1984 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station HMHT-302 Phoenix 1 November 1966 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC\n\nMarine Light Attack Helicopter Squadrons[]\n\nThe Marine Corps’ light attack squadrons are composite squadrons usually made up of 18 AH-1W Cobras and 9 UH-1N Hueys. The primary missions of the Cobra is close air support, forward air control, reconnaissance and armed escort,[18] while the Huey provides airborne command and control, utility support, supporting arms coordination and medical evacuation.[19] Both airframes are due to be upgraded as part of the H-1 upgrade program which will see them get greater power, improved avionics and an 85% commonality of parts. When the aircraft are upgraded, they will have the new nomenclatures AH-1Z[20] and UH-1Y.[21][22] Due to the need for more light attack squadrons, the Marine Corps began adding new squadrons in 2008.[23] HMLA-467 and HMLA-469 activated recently.[10]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station HMLA-167 File:Hmla167 insig.jpg Warriors 1 April 1968 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[24] HMLA-169 Vipers 30 September 1971 MAG-39, 3rd MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA[25] HMLA-267 Stingers 15 February 1944 MAG-39, 3rd MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA[26] HMLA-269 The Gunrunners 22 February 1971 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[27] HMLA-367 Scarface 1 December 1943 MAG-24, 1st MAW MCAS Kaneohe Bay, HI[28] HMLA-369 Gunfighters 1 April 1972 MAG-39, 3rd MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA[29] HMLA-467 Sabers 1 October 2008 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS Cherry Point, NC[30] HMLA-469 Vengeance 30 June 2009 MAG-39, 3rd MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA[31] HMLA-773 Red Dog June 1968 MAG-49, 4th MAW Robins AFB, GA[32]\n\nMarine Light Attack Helicopter Training Squadron[]\n\nThe squadron trains newly designated (i.e., winged) Naval Aviators, conversion pilots, refresher pilots, and enlisted aircrew on the AH-1W SuperCobra, the UH-1N Twin Huey, as well as transition to the newer AH-1Z Viper and UH-1Y Venom variants.[33]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station HMLAT-303 Atlas 30 April 1982 MAG-39, 3rd MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA\n\nMarine Medium Helicopter Squadrons[]\n\nThe Marine Corps' HMM squadrons first came to being in 1964 with the fielding of the CH-46 Sea Knight medium helicopter. They provide all-weather, day/night, night vision goggle (NVG) assault transport of combat troops, supplies, and equipment during amphibious and subsequent operations ashore. Troop assault is their primary function and the movement of supplies and equipment is secondary.[34][35] The CH-46 is currently being replaced by the MV-22B Osprey and HMM squadrons are incrementally being deactivated and coming back as VMMs.[36]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station HMM-268 Red Dragons September 15, 1972 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA[37] HMM-364 Purple Foxes September 1, 1961 MAG-39, 3rd MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA[38] HMM-774 Wild Goose 1969 MAG-49, 4th MAW NS Norfolk, VA[39]\n\nMarine Medium Helicopter Training Squadron[]\n\nThe squadron trains newly designated (i.e., winged) Naval Aviators, conversion pilots, refresher pilots, and enlisted aircrew on the CH-46 Sea Knight.[40]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station HMMT-164 Knightriders July 1, 1962 MAG-39, 3rd MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA\n\nTiltrotor Aircraft[]\n\nMarine Medium Tiltrotor Squadrons[]\n\nMarine tiltrotor squadrons are new units operating the MV-22 Osprey with their main mission being assault support. The Osprey offers twice the speed, three times the payload, five times the range, and can fly more than twice as high as the helicopters it is replacing.[41] As the Marine Corps’ number one aviation acquisition priority, the Osprey is replacing the aging fleet of CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters and is a cornerstone of the capstone concept of Expeditionary maneuver warfare.[42] The Marine Corps is planning on transitioning two squadrons a year to the new airframe until all squadrons have made the conversion.[36][dead link]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station VMM-161 Greyhawks 15 January 1951 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA[43] VMM-162 Golden Eagles June 30, 1952 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[44] VMM-163 Ridge Runners December 1951 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA[45] VMM-165 White Knights July 1, 1965 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA[46] VMM-166 Sea Elk September 13, 1985 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA[47] VMM-261 Raging Bulls April 5, 1951 MAG-26, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[48] VMM-262 Flying Tigers September 1951 MAG-36, 1st MAW MCAS Futenma, Japan[49] VMM-263 Thunder Eagles June 16, 1952 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[50] VMM-264 Black Knights June 30, 1959 MAG-26, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[51] VMM-265 Dragons October 1, 1962 MAG-36, 1st MAW MCAS Futenma, Japan[52] VMM-266 Fighting Griffins April 26, 1983 MAG-26, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[53] VMM-363 Red Lions June 2, 1952 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA[54] VMM-365 Blue Knights July 1, 1963 MAG-26, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[55] VMM-764 Moonlight April 15, 1958 MAG-41, 4th MAW Edwards AFB, CA[56]\n\nMarine Tiltrotor Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron[]\n\nThe squadron is a joint Marine Corps and Air Force test and development unit.

Because the STOVL Harrier can operate from amphibious assault ships, expeditionary airfields and tactical remote landing sites, it provides commanders with more flexibility in providing air support.[62] The Harrier is due to be replaced by the F-35B, the STOVL version of the F-35 Lightning II.[63]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station VMA-211 Wake Island Avengers 1 January 1937 MAG-13, 3rd MAW MCAS Yuma, AZ[64] VMA-214 Black Sheep 1 July 1942 MAG-13, 3rd MAW MCAS Yuma, AZ[65] VMA-223 Bulldogs 1 May 1942 MAG-14, 2nd MAW MCAS Cherry Point, NC[66] VMA-231 Ace of Spades 8 February 1919 MAG-14, 2nd MAW MCAS Cherry Point, NC[67] VMA-311 Tomcats 1 December 1942 MAG-13, 3rd MAW MCAS Yuma, AZ 15 February 1944 VMA-542 Tigers 6 March 1944 MAG-14, 2nd MAW MCAS Cherry Point, NC[68]\n\nMarine Attack Training Squadron[]\n\nThe squadron trains newly designated (i.e., winged) Naval Aviators to fly the AV-8B Harrier II.[69]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station VMAT-203 Hawks July 1, 1947 MAG-14, 2nd MAW MCAS Cherry Point, NC\n\nMarine Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadrons[]\n\nVMAQ squadrons operate the EA-6B Prowler[70] and are tasked with providing electronic attack, electronic counter-countermeasures, radar jamming and suppression of enemy air defense using the AN/ALQ-99 jamming pod[71] and the AGM-88 HARM. Each of the four squadrons operates five aircraft and are land-based, although they are capable of landing on board U.S. Navy aircraft carriers.[72][73] The Marine Corps has recently solidified plans to install a next-generation jammer on the F-35 Lightning II. It has joined the EA-18G Growler as the launch platform for the jammer, which is scheduled to enter service in 2018.[74]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station VMAQ-1 Banshees July 1, 1992 MAG-14, 2nd MAW MCAS Cherry Point, NC [75] VMAQ-2 Death Jesters September 15, 1952 MAG-14, 2nd MAW MCAS Cherry Point, NC [76] VMAQ-3 Moon Dogs July 1, 1992 MAG-14, 2nd MAW MCAS Cherry Point, NC [77] VMAQ-4 Seahawks November 7, 1981 MAG-14, 2nd MAW MCAS Cherry Point, NC [78]\n\nMarine Fighter Attack Squadrons[]\n\nThe Marine Corps' VMFA squadrons fly the single seat F/A-18A++, F/A-18C Hornet and F-35B Lightning II.
