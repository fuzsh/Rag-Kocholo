        "text": "Double Feature: 70mm! LAST ACTION HERO, 1993, Sony Repertory, 130 min. DIE HARD director John McTiernan, LETHAL WEAPON screenwriter Shane Black and megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger join forces to deliver the last word on action movies with this crowd-pleasing spoof. When teen film buff Danny Madigan (Austin O’Brien) is given a magical golden ticket, he gains entrance to the world of his favorite screen character, rough-and-tumble L.A. cop Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger). But the ticket works both ways, giving a movie villain (Charles Dance) access to the real world. F. Murray Abraham, Anthony Quinn, Mercedes Ruehl and Art Carney co-star, along with cameo appearances by a legion of celebrities.\n\n70mm! STREETS OF FIRE, 1984, Universal, 94 min. One of the great guilty pleasures of the 1980s, director Walter Hill’s spectacular, rock & roll-fueled pulp classic roars at you like a souped-up roadster with the radio going full blast. B-movie god Michael Paré stars as an enigmatic loner who comes back to town to save former gal-pal Diane Lane from the clutches of sinister biker chieftain Willem Dafoe (sporting one of the wickedest hair-dos known to mankind.) Outtasight, baby! Special Ticket Prices: $15 General, $13 Cinematheque Members. No vouchers."
