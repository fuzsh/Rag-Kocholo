        "text": "Last Action Hero | DVD | (16/02/2004) from £9.99 | Saving you £-4.00 (N/A%) | RRP £5.99\n\nJohn McTiernan (The Hunt for Red October) imaginatively directs this action comedy, which is an interesting failure with some fascinating ironies that make it well worth seeing. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays both a character named Jack Slater--a fictional cop hero who exists only in the movies (ie, the movies seen by the characters in this movie) and the actor who plays Jack Slater in the real world (ie, in the movie we're actually watching). McTiernan's hall-of-mirrors effect is fun, though Last Action Hero never quite identifies itself as a pure action movie, science fiction, a kid's movie, or anything else. (The expensive film suffered at the box office as a result and was roundly criticised for this ambivalence.) What lingers in the memory, however, is Schwarzenegger, playing himself, being confronted by Slater for having created an alter ego for film in the first place. It's a provocative moment: how often have we seen a major star blatantly wrestle with his actor's legacy in this way? --Tom Keogh\n\nThe Bible - Esther | DVD | (29/11/2010) from £7.05 | Saving you £0.94 (13.33%) | RRP £7.99\n\nA powerful story of love passion and religious conflict!

Attempting to seduce the Margrave of Alsace (F. Murray Abraham, Amadeus, Homeland) into paying for a printing press to make and publish his erotic imagery, Goltzius promises the Margrave a spectacular illustration of the Old Testament s biblical stories: erotic takes on figures such as Adam and Eve, Lot and his daughters, Samson & Delilah and John the Baptist & Salome. To tempt the Margrave further, Goltzius and his printing company offer to perform dramatisations of these erotic tales for his court... Recently awarded Outstanding Contribution to British Cinema at the 2014 BAFTA s, Peter Greenaway returns to the cinematic arena of The Draughtsman s Contract with GOLTZIUS AND THE PELICAN COMPANY, a film that showcases Greenaway s hallmarks of breath-taking visual framing and a fascination with sex and death.

In the spring of 1980, the port at Mariel Harbour was opened, and thousands set sail for the United States. They came in search of the American Dream. One of them found it on the sun-washed avenues of Miami wealth, power and passion beyond his wildest dreams. He was Tony Montana. The world will remember him by another name Scarface. The iconic film starring Al Pacino along with Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Robert Loggia has become a cultural phenomenon brilliantly directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone.\n\nFinding Forrester (Dual Format) (Blu-ray & DVD) | Blu Ray | (27/02/2017) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £N/A\n\nFinding Forrester is a very accomplished example of the sentimental melodrama that Gus Von Sant has made his own--issues like integrity and snobbery are presented with just enough simplification to the set pieces that no-one feels challenged. Brilliant baseball player Jamal gets the chance to move from a sink school in the Bronx to a private academy where his real intellectual and artistic talent will be nurtured along with his sporting skills. This is an American film about class and race, but one that makes the real issue Jamal's unsuspecting need to defend himself against accusations of plagiarism. His artistic mentor is a reclusive novelist, whose whereabouts he keeps secret even when he stands to lose everything. Rob Brown is extraordinary as the boy, conveying the sensitivity, genius, obstinacy and physicality of a character written as a paragon; Sean Connery turns in a predictably fine performance as Forrester, using his authority to make the part credible; F Murray Abrahams is, as always, an effective villain--he brings an observed creepy snobbery to the film; Anna Paquin makes a good impression in the minor part of Jamal's white schoolfellow and supporter. On the DVD: The disc includes two powerful deleted scenes of school choirs, a \"making-of\" documentary and a short film about the auditions process which found Rob Brown. It has fine sound--Dolby Digital 5.1--that brings out the film's jazz score perfectly. The anamorphic 2.35:1 aspect ratio, enhanced for 16:9 TVs, looks just fine. --Roz Kaveny\n\nScarface | DVD | (15/07/2002) from £5.98 | Saving you £17.00 (568.56%) | RRP £19.99\n\nThis sprawling epic of bloodshed and excess, Brian De Palma's update of the classic 1932 crime drama by Howard Hawks, sparked controversy over its outrageous violence when released in 1983. Scarface is a wretched, fascinating car wreck of a movie, starring Al Pacino as a Cuban refugee who rises to the top of Miami's cocaine-driven underworld, only to fall hard into his own deadly trap of addiction and inevitable assassination. Scripted by Oliver Stone and running nearly three hours, it's the kind of film that can simultaneously disgust and amaze you (critic Pauline Kael wrote \"this may be the only action picture that turns into an allegory of impotence\"), with vivid supporting roles for Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Robert Loggia. -- Jeff Shannon, Amazon.com\n\nLast Action Hero / Kindergarten Cop / Twins | DVD | (03/10/2005) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £19.99\n\nLast Action Hero (Dir.

Like its DNA-altered spawn (the title refers to the way some insects evolve to resemble their predators), Mimic is not your everyday bug picture, but a more poetic (though quite gruesome) sort of film, literally crawling with bizarre, striking images. In this case, the mutant bugs are not the result of evil atomic experiments (as in Them!), but are the unexpected side effect of work done by an entomologist (Mira Sorvino) and her Centre for Disease Control officer husband (Jeremy Northam), who, in a last-ditch effort to control a roach-carried disease epidemic that was killing children, released a genetically altered form of sterile cockroaches beneath the city. They stopped the virus, but... Also starring Charles Dutton, Giancarlo Giannini, F. Murray Abraham, and Josh Brolin. --Jim Emerson\n\nStar Trek : Insurrection | DVD | (01/08/2005) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £24.99\n\nThe battle for paradise has begun.
