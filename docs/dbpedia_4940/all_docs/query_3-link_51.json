        "text": "USA. New York. Manhattan. 1957. A Llama in Time Square.©Inge Morath/MAGNUM PHOTOS\n\nInge Morath was born in Graz, Austria, in 1923. After studying languages in Berlin, she became a translator, then a journalist and the Austrian editor for Heute, an Information Service Branch publication based in Munich. All her life Morath would remain a prolific diarist and letter-writer, retaining a dual gift for words and pictures that made her unusual among her colleagues.\n\nMorath was invited to join Magnum photo agency in 1953 at the invitation of reknowned photojournalist Henri Cartier-Bresson. She married playwright Arthur Miller in 1962 and remained his wife until her passing in 2002.\n\nCONTACT SHEET FROM HER SHOOT:"
