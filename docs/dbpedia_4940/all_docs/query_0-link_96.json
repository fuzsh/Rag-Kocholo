        "text": "Inge Morath (1923-2002) was born in Graz, Austria and grew up in Darmstadt and Berlin. After graduating from high school, she studied languages in Berlin and initially became a translator after graduating. The Austrian-born photographer initially worked in Vienna as a reportage journalist, then went to Paris at the invitation of Robert Capa to work as a text and photo editor for the newly founded photo agency Magnum. She only began taking photographs late in 1951 and became a member of Magnum in 1953. In the years that followed, she traveled the world as a photographer and her essays were published in well-known magazines. Inge Morath's photographs demonstrate great empathy and a great interest in people. A large part of her work is portraits, both of passers-by and of personalities.\n\nArtist: Inge Morath\n\nTitle: Mayfair, Bond Street, London, 1953\n\nMedium: Silver Gelatin Print, gestempelt\n\nPaper size: 40,5 x 50,5 cm\n\nImage size: 32 x 47,5 cm"
