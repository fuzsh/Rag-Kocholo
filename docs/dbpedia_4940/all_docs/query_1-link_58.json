        "text": "Toronto. Inge Morath was an Austrian-American photographer. At the time of her second marriage (to American playwright Arthur Miller), she emigrated to the States. Her work was featured in the TIME–LIFE Photography series in the late 1960s, early 1970s.\n\nInge was a member of the famous Magnum Photo organization in Paris, France. Stefan Musil, of the Austrian Gallery “Galerie Ostlicht”, dropped me a note a couple of weeks ago that Inge’s work would be in a gallery exhibition there from December 9th, 2020 until June 2nd, 2021.\n\nIf you are in Austria anytime the exhibition is on, be sure to drop in. Meantime, those of us who are homebodies – by nature or by pandemic rules, take a browse online. You may find a print to add to your collection.\n\nABOUT THE POSTS\n\nWhile we try to follow the Society (PHSC) mandate and by-laws, the opinions of each post reflect those of the writer and not necessarily that of the Society (PHSC) or it’s executive.\n\nMONTHLY MEETINGS\n\nUsually 3rd Wednesday Sept through June\n\nby ZOOM/Eventbrite or if possible in person\n\n(e.g. COVID affected on site meetings) at\n\n5120 Yonge Street at Park Home\n\nMemorial Hall\n\nBurgundy Room\n\nToronto ON (North York)\n\nNorth York Centre Subway Station\n\nMAIL ADDRESS\n\n666 Burnhamthorpe Road Box 11703\n\nEtobicoke ON Canada M9C 2Z0\n\ninfo@phsc.ca"
