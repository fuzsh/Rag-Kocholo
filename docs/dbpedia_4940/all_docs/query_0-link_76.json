        "text": "Inge Morath Award 2019\n\n*scroll down for submit button*\n\nAbout the Award\n\nThe Magnum Foundation and the Inge Morath Estate are pleased to announce the 18th annual Inge Morath Award, a $5,000 grant given to a female photographer under the age of 30 to support the completion of a long-term documentary project. One Awardee and up to two finalists are selected by a jury composed of Magnum photographers, the Executive Director of the Magnum Foundation, and Inge Morath Estate.\n\nInge Morath was an Austrian-born photographer who was associated with Magnum Photos for nearly fifty years. After her death in 2002, the Inge Morath Foundation was established with a limited-term mission to manage Morath’s estate and facilitate the study and appreciation of her contribution to photography. With the closure of the research space in 2014, all ongoing activities of the estate were folded into the Legacy Program of the Magnum Foundation, New York. The Inge Morath archive was acquired by the Beinecke Library at Yale University, and a set of Morath’s master prints by the Yale University Art Gallery, where they are now available to scholars.\n\nBecause Morath devoted much of her enthusiasm to encouraging women photographers, her colleagues at Magnum Photos established the Inge Morath Award in her honor.\n\nThe Award is administered by the Magnum Foundation as part of its mission to expand creativity and diversity in documentary photography, in cooperation with the Inge Morath Estate.\n\nPast recipients of the Inge Morath Award include:\n\nMelissa Spitz (US, 18'), for You Have Nothing to Worry About, Johanna-Maria Fritz (Germany, ‘17), for Like a Bird, Daniella Zalcman (US, ‘16), for Signs of Your Identity, Danielle Villasana (US, '15), for A Light Inside, Shannon Jensen (US, '14), for A Long Walk; Isadora Kosofsky (US, '12), for Selections from “TheThree” and “This Existence;” Zhe Chen (China, '11) for Bees; Lurdes R.

The Foundation, in furtherance of its charitable purposes, may, in the future, (1) display the project on its website and make it available for display on the website of the Inge Morath Estate; and (2) publicly display the project (or excepts from it) in connection with exhibitions or promotional materials related to the Inge Morath Award. The Foundation will credit the artist as the author and copyright holder of her photographs.\n\nIM Award recipients may be required to provide additional identifying information prior to receiving payment.\n\nNote:\n\nWe will not be accepting submissions by mail.
