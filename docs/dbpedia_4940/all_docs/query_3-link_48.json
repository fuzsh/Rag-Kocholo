Ms. Morath and Miller were married two years later.\n\nAccording to the Magnum Photos website, Ms. Morath was born in Graz, Austria. Her parents were scientists and took her on their many European assignments.

She wrote articles, as well, and became an editor at the Magnum Agency. She began photographing in London in 1951, and assisted Henri Cartier-Bresson as a researcher in 1953-54.\n\nA world traveler, she was especially interested in the arts and world cultures.
