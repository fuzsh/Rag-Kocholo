        "text": "I am especially interested in photographing in countries where a new tradition emerges from an ancient one. I am more attracted to the human element than the abstract.\n\nIn my heart I like to remain an amateur, in the sense of being in love with what I’m doing, forever astonished again at the endless possibilities of seeing and using the camera as a recording tool.\n\nPressing the shutter has remained a moment of joyful recognition, comparable to the delight of a child balancing on tiptoe and suddenly, with a small cry of delight, stretching out a hand toward a desired object."
