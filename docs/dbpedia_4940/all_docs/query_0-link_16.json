        "meta_description": "Inge Morath was born in Graz, Austria. She studied languages in Berlin, and after the Second World War became a translator  and  journalist. She became the Austrian editor  for Heute, a  publication of the American Information Service  Branch based in Munich. A friend of photographer Ernst Haas, Morath wrote articles to accompany his photographs. Together  they were  invited to Paris by Robert Capa to join the newly  founded  Magnum agency, where she worked as an editor. &nbsp;Morath began photographing  in 1951, and assisted Henri Cartier-Bresson  as a researcher  in  1953-54. She became a member of Magnum in 1955. Morath and  Eve Arnold,  who  became a member in 1957, were the pioneering  first  women to join the agency. In the following years, Morath traveled extensively  in Europe,  North  Africa,  the  United  States,  and  the Middle East. Her  special  interest  in  the arts  found expression  through  photographic  essays published by a number of leading magazines, such as Life and Holiday, as  well  as  publication  of several  books including   From  Persia to  Iran, Fiesta in Pamplona, Venice Observed  with  Mary McCarthy,  Bring Forth the Children  with  Yul Brynner,  and  Le Masque with Saul Steinberg. &nbsp;After her marriage  to Arthur Miller  in 1962, Morath settled  in New York  and Connecticut. She made her first  trip  to  the  USSR in 1965, and  in 1978, after studying  Mandarin  for five years,  she made the first of  many  trips  to  the  People’s Republic  of  China. Morath   co-published   several collaborations  with Miller based on their travels together. In  the 1980s  and  ‘90s, Morath continued to pursue both  assignments  and  independent  projects. As portraitist  of personalities in politics and arts, she photographed  a  number of famous contemporaries. She photographed on the sets of several films and the stage  productions  of  plays  by  Arthur Miller. &nbsp;She won numerous awards, including being presented with  a Doctor Honoris Causa  by  the  University  of Connecticut, the Austrian State Prize for Photography, the Gold medal  of the  National Art Club,  and  the Medal of Honor in Gold of the City of Vienna.&nbsp;www.magnumphotos.com&nbsp;",
