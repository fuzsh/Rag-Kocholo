        "text": "Ingeborg Morath (May 27, 1923 – January 30, 2002) was an Austrian photographer.[1] In 1953 she joined the Magnum Photos Agency. She became a full photographer with them in 1955. In 1955 she published her first collection of photographs, of a total of 30 monographs during her lifetime.\n\nIngeborg Morath was born in Graz, Austria. Her parents were scientists. They went to different laboratories and universities in Europe during her childhood. She first went to French-speaking schools. In the 1930s her family moved to Darmstadt, a German intellectual center. Then they moved to Berlin.\n\nMorath's first encounter with avant-garde art was the Degenerate Art show by the Nazi party in 1937. It was supposed to make people not like modern art. \"I found a number of these paintings exciting and fell in love with Franz Marc's Blue Horse\", Morath later wrote.[2]\n\nMorath went to Berlin University. At university, Morath studied languages. She learned French, English, and Romanian. Later she added Spanish, Russian and Chinese. Toward the end of World War II, Morath worked for factory service in Tempelhof, alongside Ukrainian prisoners of war. During an attack on the factory by Russian bombers, she ran on foot to Austria. In later years, Morath would not photograph war.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Morath worked as a translator and journalist. In 1948, she was hired by Warren Trabant. She worked for Heute. Morath met photographer Ernst Haas in post-war Vienna. She brought his work to Trabant's attention.[3] Working together for Heute, Morath wrote articles to go along with Haas' pictures. In 1949, Morath and Haas were invited by Robert Capa to join the newly founded Magnum Photos in Paris.\n\nMorath was briefly married to the British journalist Lionel Birch. She moved to London in 1951. That same year, she began to photograph during a visit to Venice. Morath asked for an apprenticeship with Simon Guttman. He was then an editor for Picture Post and running the picture-agency Report.\n\nMorath divorced Birch and returned to Paris. Her first jobs were stories that did not interest \"the big boys.\" She went to London on an early job to photograph the residents of Soho and Mayfair. Morath's portrait of Mrs. Eveleigh Nash, from that job, is among her best-known works. During the late 1950s Morath traveled widely. She covered stories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the United States, and South America. She worked for such publications as Holiday, Paris Match, and Vogue. In 1955 she published Guerre à la Tristesse, photographs of Spain, with Robert Delpire. This was followed by De la Perse à l'Iran, photographs of Iran, in 1958. Morath published more than thirty monographs during her lifetime.\n\nLike many Magnum members, Morath worked as a still photographer on numerous motion picture sets. She met director John Huston while she was living in London. Huston's Moulin Rouge (1952) was one of Morath's earliest jobs. It was her first time working in a film studio.\n\nMorath married the playwright Arthur Miller on February 17, 1962. They moved to the United States. Miller and Morath's first child, Rebecca, was born in September 1962. The couple's second child Daniel was born in 1966 with Down syndrome. He was institutionalized shortly after his birth.[4] Today Rebecca Miller is a film director, actress, and writer.\n\nIngeborg Morath Miller died of cancer in New York City in 2002, at the age of 78.[1]\n\n2003, her family established the Inge Morath Foundation.\n\n2002, members of Magnum Photos made the Inge Morath Award in honor of their colleague as an annual award. It is administered by the Inge Morath Foundation, and is given to a woman photographer under the age of 30, to support her work towards the completion of a long-term project.\n\n1992 Great Austrian State Prize for Photography.\n\n1984 Doctor Honoris Causa Fine Arts, University of Connecticut, Hartford, USA.\n\n1983 State of Michigan Senate Resolution NO 295; Tribute to Inge Morath.\n\n2008 Well Disposed and Trying to See: Inge Morath and Arthur Miller in China, University of Michigan Art Museum, Ann Arbor, USA.\n\n2004 Inge Morath: The Road to Reno, Chicago Cultural Center, Illinois, USA.\n\n2004 Inge Morath: Chinese Encounters, Pingyao International Photography Festival, Pingyao, China.\n\n2003 Exposition, Henri Cartier-Bresson Foundation, Paris, France.\n\n2002 Inge Morath: Danube, City Gallery of Russe, Russe, Bulgaria.\n\n2002 Inge Morath: New York, Galerie Fotohof, Salzburg, Austria; Stadt Passau, Europäische; Wochen, Germany ESWE Forum, Wiesbaden; Esther Woerdehoff Galerie, Paris, France; Amerikahaus Tübingen, Germany.\n\n1999 Retrospective, Kunsthalle Wien, Austria; FNAC Etoile, Paris, France; FNAC, Barcelona, Spain.\n\n1999 Spain in the Fifties, Museo del Cabilde, Montevideo, Uruguay.\n\n1998 Inge Morath: Danube, Festival of Central European Culture, London, UK; Museen d.
