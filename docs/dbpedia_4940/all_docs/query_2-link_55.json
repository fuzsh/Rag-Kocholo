        "text": "I decided to do some research on Austrian born photographer Inge Morath. Morath had a very interesting life, she was born into a family of scientists and travelled with her mother and father as a young girl to many different laboratories throughout Europe. Her life was very much affected by World War II and later she aimed to show the devastating effects of war through her photography. Much of her photography was done on film productions and she worked with many notable actresses like Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe. Morath died of cancer in 2002.\n\nInge Morath\n\nPhotograph for the New Yorker by Inge Morath\n\nPortrait of Marilyn Monroe shot by Inge Morath"
