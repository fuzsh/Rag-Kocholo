        "text": "Inge Morath (1923–2002) was the first woman to become a full member of MAGNUM Photos, the legendary agency for high-quality photojournalism that has been dominated by men until today.\n\nBorn in Graz, Austria, Morath grew up in Darmstadt and Berlin and spoke five languages, among them Russian and Mandarin. She studied photography with Ernst Haas in Vienna, Simon Guttmann in London, and Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris. In 1955, Robert Capa recruited\n\nher for MAGNUM. Associating with intellectuals, artists, and actors, she created memorable portraits and also produced photo reportages from Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and China. Exclusively for MAGNUM she took pictures on many film sets such as Marilyn Monroe’s last movie The Misfits, written by Arthur Miller, Marilyn’s then husband. After their divorce, Inge Morath married the playwright.\n\nThe main text of this English/German publication that accompanies a major retrospective exhibition in Munich is an autobiographic lecture Inge Morath gave in Berlin in 1994. Filmmaker and novelist Rebecca Miller, the daughter of Inge Morath and Arthur Miller, has written an intimate foreword ; edited by Isabel Siben and Anna-Patricia Kahn."
