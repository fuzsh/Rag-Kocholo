        "text": "Louise Bourgeois in her studio, New York, 1991.\n\nInge Morath is an Austrian born American photographer who conquered the trauma of barely surviving World War II growing up in Nazi Germany. She used her camera as her armor to document the world closed off to women. In 1953, Morath was one of the first women to join Magnum Photos. She worked closely with Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson throughout her career. Inge Morath: An Illustrated Biography by Linda Gordon (co-published by Magnum Foundation and Prestel, November 2018) provides a collection of astonishing and powerful images throughout her career.\n\nMorath spent the majority of her life traveling around the world dismantling the conventions and limitations systematically designed for women. She navigated these spaces shutoff to women by documenting interpersonal relationships and various cultures. Her empathy and courage fueled her desire to capture the world.\n\nThe Magnum Foundation will be presenting a conversation about the work and legacy of Inge Morath and two other defining Magnum photographers Susan Meiselas and Martine Franck. The event will take place at the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris on Friday, November 9, at 6pm.\n\nFor more information about the event in Paris: click here"
