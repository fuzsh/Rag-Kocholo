From far away, she hears John, a lone man in an empty house, who is trying to put together a sentence form Revelation 22:13 (in Biblical Greek).\n\nShe begins her journey to help him put together the sentence. John creates maps of his coordinates that mysteriously appear for Maria. As she makes her way towards his house, she turns the phrase around."
