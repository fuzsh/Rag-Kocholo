        "text": "Short online film explores the space between interactivity and storytelling\n\nBOULDER, Colo. – June 2, 2016 – Rapt Media, a leader in groundbreaking interactive video technology, and Aardman, the four-time OscarⓇ award-winning storytelling animation studio behind internationally known characters like Wallace & Gromit and Shaun the Sheep, today released a new short interactive film titled “Dead Lonely.”\n\nThe story—which is part film and part game—is set in a post-apocalyptic world in which the story’s protagonist, a zombie named Fred, is searching for his long-lost love. Throughout the interactive film, the viewer is invited to make decisions for Fred, guiding and directing the story’s action.\n\n“There’s no question that ‘Dead Lonely’ provides viewers with a deeply gratifying experience. The film puts the control in the hands of the viewer, allowing them to feel rewarded with discovery,” said Erika Trautman, founder and CEO of Rapt Media. \"Our research shows that consumers are craving more personalization and self-discovery in their online content, and ‘Dead Lonely’ offers both.”\n\nRapt Media recently conducted a survey to determine what consumers want from their content, and their report found that 66 percent of consumers said that uninteresting or irrelevant content is the main reason they don’t view content all the way through. Additionally, 61 percent stated that they still prefer to discover content on their own even when it's customized.\n\nAardman Digital Group Creative Director Daniel Efergan described the decision to team up with Rapt Media: “We wanted to partner with Rapt Media on this creative endeavor because our two teams have similar beliefs and philosophies about interactive content and how it can change the way people engage with stories.”\n\nAn interactive \"making of\" video was also produced, “Behind The Scenes With Aardman,” in which “Dead Lonely’s” creative team discusses all aspects of the interactive storytelling and development process.\n\n“‘Dead Lonely’ is an innovative and unforgettable journey—an interactive storytelling experience that represents the future of content marketing,” said Trautman.\n\n###\n\nAbout Rapt Media\n\nRapt Media has created the only interactive storytelling tech combining personalized narrative with unparalleled data integration. Our HTML5, mobile-native video platform gives you the power to intrigue, turning viewers into participants and engagement into real insights. Welcome to the future of video."
