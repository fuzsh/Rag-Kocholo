If you are as curious as I, you should drop by Davies Theatre and check out the student-made film entitled Rapt.\n\nStarring three UWEC theater majors (Charlene Lucht, Kaysee Schmidt, and Eddie Neve) and music written and played by UWEC music major Brandon Covelli, the idea for the film was birthed from the creative and quirky minds of students Matt Troge and Ben Klema, the writers and producers. Troge and Klema’s passion for creating film has manifested itself in the small, on-campus production company entitled Level Seven.\n\nThey have created several miniseries and were awarded “Best Film and Audience Award” at the 2009 Student Independent Film Festival for their film entitled Love, Daphne. Wanting to create a more frightening film for Halloween, they call Rapt an “experimental, psychological thriller” dealing with obsession and the human mind driving itself insane.\n\nYup, that sounds freaky enough to me. Featuring a girl named Ann who finds a box that can’t be opened, she slowly drives herself insane with curiosity and eventually ends up endangering those around her to discover what is in the box.\n\nCheck it out in Davies Theatre Halloween weekend. Approximately 30 minutes long, Rapt will be following the Ed Wood film Plan 9 From Outer Space, shown at 6 and 8:30pm from Thursday, October 29 through Sunday, November 1."
