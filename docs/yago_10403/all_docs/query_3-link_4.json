        "text": "Worlds collide in “Rapt,” a solid yet fleet French thriller about a society kidnapping and its shockwaves. You see one world in the gangbuster opening that, with a racing camera, follows a sleek, unidentified man as he hurtles through a day in a matter of moments, rushing out of his home, whooshing into an office, bolting from a meeting and all but flinging himself into the arms of one woman before embracing another. This frenetic activity soon jolts to a halt, though, when his chauffeured car is jacked and he’s snatched by armed kidnappers who turn him into a victim even as the outside world transforms him into the accused.\n\nThat transformation, along with the clash of truths and interests, is at the core of “Rapt,” which stars Yvan Attal as Stanislas Graff, the chairman of a corporation whose cosseted existence comes with a substantial family fortune and what turns out to be a heavy price. As suggested by the film’s slamming start and by the luxury that surrounds and at times almost seems to encrust him like barnacles — gold trims his mansion and marble turns his office into a mausoleum — Graff is an archetypal vision of the industrialist as modern aristocrat. He’s the sort of man who makes the society pages when he squires his wife around (Anne Consigny plays the designated weeper, Françoise) and the gossip columns when he doesn’t.\n\nAfter Graff is kidnapped, another news cycle kicks in as reporters gather outside his mansion baying for news before turning to something, anything, else, when the information grows stale. In its outlines — a man of power humbled — the case (and Graff’s hauteur) evokes that of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former chairman of the International Monetary Fund accused of sexually assaulting a New York hotel worker. In truth, the story is drawn from the 1978 kidnapping of Baron Édouard-Jean Empain, a Belgian-French industrialist who, during his ordeal, unwillingly lost part of a finger. (As in the movie, the purloined flesh was left in a baggage locker for pickup.) Initially identified as radical leftists (snatching the rich was all the vogue in some revolutionary circles), his kidnappers just wanted dough.\n\nAs reports of Graff’s womanizing and gambling hit, perceptions — in his home, the boardroom, the media and perhaps the movie theater — shift. For much of the film, Mr. Belvaux moves seamlessly between two separate realms, with Graff and his kidnappers occupying one stage and his family, the police, politicians and increasingly jittery board members playing their roles in the other. Mr. Belvaux doesn’t force the parallels; rather he shows the stress, panic and fear that color the interactions on both sides, as when he lingers over a late-night conversation between Françoise and a sympathetic cop or makes time for a sociable kidnapper (Gérard Meylan) who calls himself Le Marseillais and gives Graff a homemade meal.\n\nDespite its contemporary milieu and restive camerawork, “Rapt” brings to mind classic films noirs like “Laura” and “The Killers” in which somehow physically absent characters come into focus through investigations. Graff may be onscreen for much of the movie, but because he’s often gagged, blindfolded and bound, he also presents a question mark, a cipher. He’s scared, and then he’s grizzled with a haunted, gaunt face full of beard. Mr. Attal makes the most of a difficult role. He seizes your attention with a charismatic gestural performance that slices through rooms and telegraphs what it means to be a master of the universe, and then later he gives you pause with the hollowed-out gaze of a man now frighteningly, terminally alone.\n\nRAPT\n\nOpens on Wednesday in Manhattan.\n\nWritten and directed by Lucas Belvaux; director of photography, Pierre Milon; edited by Danielle Anezin; art director, Frédérique Belvaux; costumes by Nathalie Raoul; produced by Patrick Sobelman, Diana Elbaum and Sebastian Delloy; released by Lorber Films. At Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village. In French, with English subtitles. Running time: 2 hours 6 minutes. This film is not rated.\n\nWITH: Yvan Attal (Stanislas Graff), Anne Consigny (Françoise Graff), André Marcon (André Peyrac), Françoise Fabian (Marjorie), Alex Descas (Walser), Gérard Meylan (Le Marseillais) and Michel Voita (Commissioner Paoli)."
