        "text": "The Danish drama which is having its on-site world premiere this Saturday (September 12th) at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), won the 2020 AFCAE Award from the French Arthouse Cinema Association, an award presented last year to Parasite.\n\nAnother Round was preferred to high profile European films such as Sharunas Bartas’ In the Dusk, Maiwenn’s DNA and Lucas Belvaux’s Home Front.\n\nFrench distributor Haut et Court will release the film in France on October 14, 2020.\n\nThe Zentropa film co-written by Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm, is screening at Toronto’s Special Presentations programme, before heading off to San Sebastian and the BFI London Film Festival.\n\nToronto Nordic programmer Steve Gravestock said about the film: “Directed with insight and energy by Vinterberg, and driven by a great ensemble cast [Maria Bonnevie, Magnus Millang, Lars Ranthe, Thomas Bo Larsen) with the incomparable Mads Mikkelsen at its centre, Another Round is a boisterous and sobering comedy about how men deal (and don’t deal) with ageing, though underlying it all is a shared, unnerving suspicion they may never have actually grown up in the first place.”\n\nOn the eve of the film’s world premiere in Toronto, sales outfit TrustNordisk has announced that Samuel Goldwyn Films has acquired rights for the US.\n\nOther recent sales were negotiated with Japan, Australia, China, Mexico, Central America and Colombia, Brazil, Spain, Italy, Israel and Romania, on top of previous deals signed with 25 territories.\n\nThe film will be released September 24 in Denmark as part of Biografklub Danmark, with Nordisk Film handling the distribution across the Nordics."
