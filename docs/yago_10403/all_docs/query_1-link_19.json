        "text": "73/100\n\n[originally written on my blog]\n\nBelvaux is the most resolutely matter-of-fact and detail-obsessed filmmaker out there who's committed to genre work, which makes him a weirdly unsung treasure. How can the family deliver the money if only the kidnapping victim has access to his bank accounts? Now that we've cut off his finger, what should we do about his stump? If you spend weeks covering your eyes every time you awaken or somebody walks into the room, does that become a reflex action? Even the ostensible climax is awesomely anti-sensationalistic, over almost before you know it's begun. Only a schematic overall conception (blameless victim destroyed by his heretofore ignored sins coming to light) disappoints.\n\nA politician ransome set-up done in a way prioritizing realism over theatrics, diverting lazy tropes. I love how it explores the feelings people have towards the main character, and the lead performance is very good. Not sure if I love how the runtime is used at 2 hours, and do wish we had a tighter tale. I really like where the third act went.\n\nI wondered why the dog, but in fact I know why: that's the only pure, uncomplicated relationship in the whole movie. Belvaux has no gimmick or specific theme in mind, just a detailed procedural with the whole locus of interactions - each with its particular texture - among all these people. He probably ran his career into the ground making films like this.\n\nThis is just a really good kidnapping story that just focuses on the kidnapped victim, those around him and the aftermath of that.\n\nItâ€™s all very engrossing, the relationships between the characters are complicated and complex, the police and their handling of the kidnapping adds a nice cop layer.\n\nOverall, a thrilling drama that captures the torture of the victim and his family, the aftermath of the kidnapping and all of this told back and forth and the eventual clash is worth it.\n\nA French dramatic thriller about the kidnapping of a business executive whose secret life comes to light while his family and employers are working to free him. It highlights the self-interests of corporations over the individual, but also the self-interest of the victim towards his family. What appears to be a story of survival becomes a darker tale of self-destruction and isolation. It moves along, but at a typical foreign film's pace, with lots of dialogue-free scenes. Very strong performances and many scenes of duress, but minimal violence except for one squicky scene. A solid morality tale that will appeal to those with a high tolerance for artistic cinema.\n\nSimply directed, sparsely scored and underplayed, Rapt is an usual, very realistic kidnap thriller; it's unconventional mostly because it isn't overblown, full of twists or hysterical. Refreshingly, Rapt examines the after-effects of the kidnap in as much detail as the kidnap/negotiations/revelations themselves, continuing on for a good 30 minutes more where your typical Hollywood product would have finished. This does mean that the shift in tone in the final third is a little patience testing after the first two thirds careful build-up and suspense, but the film as a whole is more rewarding and thoughtful for it. An interesting attempt at doing something different that isn't always successful but worth seeking out.\n\nEffective Franco-Belgian thriller in which that age old conundrum is posited - would you pay the ransom to free your CEO from kidnappers or use the money to hire 1,000 new editorial assistants? The answer in this case is ambiguous and brought to mind cost-benefit analysis and the way welfare economists will calculate the 'price' of a life. That said, it never possesses the tension of films such as 'A Hijacking' or elements of series 3 of 'The Killing' that possess similar themes. From the word go, we are not that sympathetic to the guy who has been kidnapped."
