        "text": "20. Polite Society: the biggest surprise of the year\n\n47:07| |Season 5, Ep. 20\n\nFor film club this week weâ€™re watching Polite Society, last yearâ€™s British martial artsaction comedy film from debut feature filmmaker Nida Manzoor. The setup sees Ria, a London-based Pakistani Muslim girl who dreams of becoming one of Britainâ€™s top stuntwomen. But it;s about so much more than that. Itâ€™s genre hopping, itâ€™s a rewarding British comedy, itâ€™s giving Kick Ass, and you know what, itâ€™s different to the other sh*t you see in the cinemas. The film inspires us to reflect on meeting your heroes, co-dependant sisterly relationships and family who are dubious of your dreams. We agree it has the coolest stunt scenes of recent years, the perfect synergy between the choreography and camerawork being helped by the fact the cinematographer herself has a black belt in karate (OBSESSED). Maisie opens up about her experience filming stunts for Game of Thrones, the stamina and prep needed to make them look convincing, and we discuss the perseverance of stunt people in general.We cover clever sound design, budget and the 10 year journey of getting the film made. Plus, our confusion/disappointment that itâ€™s had such a small global impact. When it gets onto streamers - we hope you all stream the **** out of it. We think youâ€™ll love it.A full transcript of this episode can be found here.Keep up to date with us on Instagram, TikTok, Letterboxd and YouTube: @frankfilmclub\n\n19. Jenniferâ€™s Body: butchered by the marketing campaign\n\n46:14| |Season 5, Ep. 19\n\nMean Girls meets Scream? This week we passionately and lovingly rant about the cult classic, Jennifers Body (2009). Turns out back in 2009, the film industry execs, aka the boys, ruined Diablo Codyâ€™s masterpiece. Fresh off the heels of her hit Juno, screenplay writer Cody was given free rein to create her dream horror comedy starring Megan Fox, the actress born to play the title role. The film flopped thanks to the sexist marketing targeting the wrong audience, jeopardising Megan and Diabloâ€™s careers. Obviously weâ€™re furious. We discuss the brilliance of the writing that firmly cements this in the high school film canon. We analyse how relatable the friends-by-default setup is and the joy of seeing toxic friendship depicted on screen. We love the Labrador puppy vs black cat energy of the Amanda Seyfried and Megan Fox duo. We compare our favourite lines and discuss the films legacy. Itâ€™s been a Maisie pick this week > enjoy the rewatch and tune in to our chat ðŸ’•A full transcript of this episode can be found here.Keep up to date with us on Instagram, TikTok, Letterboxd and YouTube: @frankfilmclub\n\n18. How To Have Sex: lead actor & BAFTA Rising Star Mia McKenna-Bruce joins us!\n\n48:38| |Season 5, Ep. 18\n\nWe lure the amazing Mia McKenna-Bruce to our studio to discuss our fave film of last year: How To Have Sex. She stars as the central character of Tara in this stunning film exploring sexual consent, female friendship, toxic friendship, and self discovery. Mia gives us the scoop on filming those party scenes, drunk acting tips and regressing 10 years for this role. We reflect on the weighty themes of the film. Unsurprisingly we can all identify with the experiences of the central character and itâ€™s powerful to see the feelings of young, and yes drunk, girls, be validated onscreen. We respect how the young male characters arenâ€™t depicted as monsters and agree how this makes the film all the more impactful. We agree that the incredible authenticity of this film is a testament to not only the writing, but also its thorough research and lengthy casting process. Maisie and Mia compare working with intimacy coordinators on set, to previous uncomfortable jobs when the role didnâ€™t exist. And finally, we hear about Miaâ€™s wildly different upcoming role after winning her BAFTA. How To Have Sex (2023) is the debut feature from talented writer/director Molly Manning Walker. Consider us obsessed.A full transcript of this episode can be found here. Keep up to date with us on Instagram, TikTok, Letterboxd and YouTube: @frankfilmclub\n\n17. Femme: how this gobsmacking neo-noir revenge thriller got made\n\n43:36| |Season 5, Ep. 17\n\nWear an extra pair of socks because this film will knock them right off. This week we discuss Femme, the Neo-noir thriller and debut feature from directing duo Sam H. Freeman and Ng Choon Ping. In Femme, we see Jules targeted in a horrific homophobic attack, destroying his life and career. Some time after that, he encounters one of his attackers in a gay sauna and wants revenge. We discuss the inspiring journey of this film getting made, from short to feature, plus a whole new cast, with the support of Agile films. You go Agile films! We discuss the simply astounding performances from Nathan Stewart-Jarrett and George MacKay. We give serious props to the shoestring budget, the unbelievable 3 week actor prep time, and the quality of the scriptwriting. TW: this film features a lot of sexual violence. Femme (2023) is available to stream on Netflix. A full transcript of this episode can be found here. Keep up to date with us on Instagram, TikTok, Letterboxd and YouTube: @frankfilmclub\n\n16. Maestro: getting onscreen ageing so wrong and so right\n\n46:36| |Season 5, Ep. 16\n\nThis week we watch Maestro, a film where Bradley Cooper convincingly ages before your eyes across four decades. We address his biographical film about American conductor Leonard Bernstein. In this episode, we learn a lot about Cooperâ€™s career and directing techniques. We finally learn what a conductor actually does. We discuss whether the apparent 6 years of prep goes unnoticed as far as the performances are concerned. And we recoil in horror at Carey Mulligans lack of ageing.Maestro (2023) follows Leonard Bernstein as he begins a tumultuous relationship with actress Felicia Montealegre, upturning both of their lives. It stars Bradley Cooper, Carey Mulligan, Maya Hawke, Sarah Silverman. It is available to stream on Netflix.A full transcript of this episode can be found here.Keep up to date with us on Instagram, TikTok, Letterboxd and YouTube: @frankfilmclub"
