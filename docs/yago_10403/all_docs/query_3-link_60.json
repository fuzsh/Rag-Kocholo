        "text": "Spoilers & mention of attempted sexual assault ahead.\n\nDirector Dimitri Kirsanoff's first sound film and the last work on which he had complete artistic freedom, The Kidnapping is a dizzying swirl of images and emotions. Still relying little on dialogue, Kirsanoff's focus here is instead on landscapes and faces: how they look when they dream; they suffer; when they wonder and when they scheme.\n\nThe plot of the film is completely ludicrous, about Firmin (Geymond Vital), a shepherd who kidnaps the girlfriend (Dita Parlo as Elsi) of the man who killed his dog. It's an impulsive action which he immediately regrets, but also one which bring him a certain degree of warped pride — he did, after all, bring a pretty girl home, a trophy…\n\nThis is a wonderfully photographed movie, set in the Swiss Alps, and offers us a cautionary tale about the futility of revenge.\n\nThere is a beautiful valley separating two mountain towns that speak a different language and follow different religious views. Otherwise, the two settlements are the same, both involved in making a living from animal husbandry on the slopes of the Alps.\n\nA shepherd, trying to protect his sheep from an unleashed (and beautiful) Airedale dog, kills the creature with a thrown rock. We don't know if the man was trying to kill the dog or just chase it off.\n\nWhen the aggrieved owner (from the other town) comes asking about his dog, he is treated coldly by the…\n\nTo get the inevitable 'But what is..' questions out of the way.\n\nIt's adventurous but it's not Menilmontant.\n\nDita Parlo is magnificent but It's not L'Atalante\n\nWith those comparisons out of the way you're left with a film that manages to stand on it's own merits perfectly well even if it never quite catches lightning on screen like those films.\n\nIt's got some excellent montage work, particularly in the delirious final act, some great alpine locations and a story of vengeance and distrust of the Other that remains gripping after 80 years.\n\nThe folks from one side of the mountain have nothing to do with the foreigners from the other. On the high peaks a dog is killed and a…\n\n\"Rapt is a film of such magnificence that it must be classed as one of the three or four best sound films made.\" - In Memoriam of Dimitri Kirsanov, A Neglected Master; Film Culture Magazine\n\nThat is quite the exaggeration... However I can understand how one can have a tendency to hyperbole when first seeing Kirsanoff's work. And this is indeed a work remarkably ahead of its time in many ways, and is also remarkably entertaining for a film from '34, because it is in many ways way more sophisticated and subtle than most works of the time, and therefore seen today, feels much more attuned to our current sensibilities.\n\nThe film is set and shot in the Swiss Alps.…\n\n100 Essential Films That Deserve More Attention #25\n\nSet high in the Swiss Alps, Rapt was filmed on location where director Dimitri Kirsanoff used the impressive backdrop to create a visually engaging and arresting picture, befitting of such a beautiful location. Here is where two different cultures separated by the highlands collide; French speaking Catholics and German speaking Protestants, in an astonishing adaptation of a book by the Swiss author Charles Ferdinand Ramuz entitled La Separation des Races.\n\nHans and his fiancee Elsa reside in this stunning part of the Swedish countryside and appear to live a relatively peaceful Catholic existence alongside Elsa's younger brother. When Hans kills a dog who is terrorising his goat herd, the dog's owner, Fermin,…"
