        "text": "It doesnâ€™t take Â£3m to make a first feature (as the heads at BBC Film and Film Four suggest) - and the idea it does makes it difficult for new voices to be heard. We spent (roughly) 1/30th of that budget to make Lapwing and had a UK cinema release and digital release across the US and Europe. If we had any more money it would have been spent on supporting our release which was the area most impacted by a lower budget. So yes, more money would have been great. But the idea it must cost millions to make a feature does not come from independent filmmakers - I can name multiple excellent films made for a fraction of that. So what are we optimising for? Better stories? More adventurous filmmakers? Developing talent? If we were doing that, we would make more, faster, and allow unique voices to develop in a space where risk and play is actually encouraged. I can tell you with certainty that Lapwing would never have happened if it needed Â£3m to get started and that would mean the talent involved would still be waiting for a chance to shoot something longer than a short. Show me someone with Â£3m to invest, and Iâ€™ll direct them to 10 exceptional projects that can be shot and still leave them with change. https://lnkd.in/edi-ybQD\n\nLocal Suppliers, Crew and Talent Can you provide a service to Film Productions in Dorset & Hampshire? Would you like to see more film projects in this region? Just imagine how working locally will reduce the time and cost of travelling to set, let alone carbon footprints! Then raise your hand now, and let us know who you are. Why? The doors are opening wide with opportunities for local Crew, Talent, Services and Locations. We need to gather the stats that show Film & TV Productions that we can deliver world-class skills and facilities across Hampshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve been out and about talking to land-owners, studios, investors, streamers, and councils across our region. All of them have expressed an interest in seeing film studios in the two counties. Whatâ€™s more you could benefit from whatâ€™s coming through our connections: Â· The new Medina Film Studios on the Isle of Wight is coming soon! Â· There are talks for another film studio in Southern Hampshire. Â· Discussions are also taking place for two new film studios in Dorset. Â· COLLABORATION IS KEY, join us, Dorset Film Office, Hampshire Film Office, Isle of Wight fixers, FILM EXPO SOUTH and Medina Studios working together to 'MAKE IT HAPPEN' To complete our survey, itâ€™ll only take you two minutes - the more Crew/Talent we can highlight in the region, the greater the benefit to all. Taking a few minutes of your time could make a major change for our region and the opportunities in the industry for us all. So please fill out the survey here: https://lnkd.in/ejQHZtzv and letâ€™s pull together to make sure that light turns green. Please do share with other local filmmakers.

But whilst passion comes in to this, there are a number of drivers to our decision to do more in this amazing region which I will touch on below. We have been putting this plan together for close to 5 years now and only in the last 6 months have we seen the lights go in peoples heads - hopefully this will lead to more govt and soft funding options becoming available - which have been severely lacking to date. We are excited by Leo Pearlman Fulwell 73 Productions plans and hugely appreciate them using their impressive profile in the industry to draw attention to our collective cause and wish them every success in their endeavour in Sunderland! We would like to thank Alison Gwynn and her team at North East Screen for their support and congratulate them on everything they have achieved in the last 24 months to put the region back on the agenda and make it far more more visible within the ent sector! 1. Clear Market Opportunity - The North East has been chronically underinvested in for a number of decades and has very little in terms of an ent sector (apart from Video Games). There are no studios for film / tv production bar Hartlepool and no post facilities. It is untapped in terms of natural resource and talent. Yet we have a shortage of studio space and edit facilities nationally and a concentration in and around London. Infrastructure is the key necessity for the region to consider itself a serious option for film and tv producers and productions. 2. Clear Business Opportunity - For Goldfinch owning a studio and post facility allows us to push costs down, greenlight more projects, generate another revenue stream and turbo charge other businesses we are involved in > First Flights, N44, Selectors, Myco - all things we need to be thinking about as business owners in the ent sector in general. The region will only be as good as the busiensses operating within it. 3. Untapped Talent Pool - the North East has a huge number of colleges (20+) and universities (5+) all with energetic students desperate for job opps and a pathway to filmmaking. Whilst they need further training and mentorship, this pool is vital to provide the life blood for companies, productions and the infrastructure being built here. 4. Pride - We are a proud region, that has been left behind economically vs the rest of the UK. Globally you can see the economic and cultural effects that entertainment and sport has on regions embracing and investing in to it. We have seen this first hand with investment in to NUFC and we can continue to elevate and put the spot light back on the North East through meaningful investment in the entertainment sector now! Thank you to all our supporters and partners so far in our North East journey. The tunnel is v long but at least we have some light to focus on at the end now ðŸ˜Ž"
