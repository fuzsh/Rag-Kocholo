        "text": "The Belgian-born film-maker Lucas Belvaux is best known for his 2002 Trilogie, a three-part film more palimpsest than trilogy, in which the same overlapping events are viewed first as a thriller, then as a romantic farce and finally as a melodrama on the theory that our lives are like genre movies. It revolves around a ruthless terrorist (played by Belvaux himself) returning to the beautiful French city of Grenoble after 15 years in jail, and the overall effect suggests Odd Man Out rewritten by Alan Ayckbourn.\n\nHis new film, Rapt, a taut thriller set in and around Paris, begins with the kidnapping of Stanislas Graff (Yvan Attal), the handsome boss of a multi-billion conglomerate based in Paris. To establish their seriousness, the brutal abductors, never seen unmasked, send a severed finger along with a ransom demand for €50m. But there is conflict between Graff's apparently loving family, his conspiratorial associates and the cops, all influenced by the discovery of what several have suspected, that in addition to being a businessman of genius he's also a womaniser and a reckless gambler with serious debts to the gaming fraternity.\n\nThe media have a field day as the case drags on for weeks, and from being the innocent victim of a terrible crime the hapless, abused Graff is transformed into a contentious figure robbed of his individuality. To the public at large, he becomes a symbol of what is wrong with French capitalism, to his corporation a financial liability, to his chic, socially conscious wife and his two teenage daughters a traitor, while to his haute-bourgeoise mother (Françoise Fabian, a familiar French actress from 1960s pictures such as Buñuel's Belle de jour, and Rohmer's Ma Nuit chez Maude) he's an object of indifference. Thus a police procedural movie turns into a moral state-of-the‑nation picture and a rather good one."
