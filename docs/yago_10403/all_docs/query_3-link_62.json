        "text": "As a young film student, many cinematic stories could reel me in and leave me rapt, inspired, and deeply emotional.\n\nBlockbuster hits entertained me but when the credits rolled and the theater lights came on, I didn’t imagine myself directing similar daunting fare. For all of its heavy, gooey cheese, Titanic took my breath away, yet left me wondering if my storytelling talents could ever lead me to creating such a unique movie experience.\n\nEven films like Braveheart and Gladiator intimidated me — I knew my Hollywood experience would never include becoming a creative force in shaping sweeping, star-studded epics. Yet, for every giant studio project, an almost-perfect movie like Cinema Paradiso made me feel as though one day, in the vague and distant future, I would become a filmmaker.\n\nHowever, two films informed and deeply inspired my crappy student films and future dreams more than any other movies of the time: Good Will Hunting (1997) and … Bottle Rocket (1996). Although the former had A-list talent attached, like Robin Williams and Gus Van Sant, both projects began in the imaginations of young, unknown creatives."
