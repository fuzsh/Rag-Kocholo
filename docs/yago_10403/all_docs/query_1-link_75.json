This short film captures the joyous, moving moments of residents' daily lives, and the hidden beauty and unseen sides of a slum town fighting for survival. The Director’s objectives were to inspire, inform and educate viewers about Makoko and Nigerian culture. And to enhance the incredible sound of Kokoroko through emotive film to bring the band’s debut music-video to audiences globally. The brief to elevate Kokoroko’s Afrobeat sound and launch the band globally through a film featuring three tracks from their album “Could We Be More”: Ewà Inú, Home, and Age of Ascent, re-imagines the music as a soundtrack to a triptych of interconnected stories set in Makoko. Noteworthy too is the film’s sensitive and poignant filming of the peoples of Makoko. The city built on stilts is under constant threat being torn down by the Nigerian government. With a light touch, Akinola Jr.’s objective to inspire and educate viewers about its residents' plight was beautifully achieved. Kokoroko'smusic “gifts the listener feelings of homecoming and joy” says the band. The same natural and ultimately joyous tone imbues Akinola's film. Female-led, London-based Afrobeat band, Kokoroko, is simultaneously reviving and reinventing Afrobeat at a time when pop, Hip-Hop, rock, electronic dance music and Latin are the five most popular music genres worldwide. So for the director, shooting the video in Makoko was entirely appropriate. Indeed, the film reimagines the music as a soundtrack to a triptych of interconnected stories set in Makoko - a community originally settled by fishermen excluded from official census records and under threat of demolition, told through a allegorical and enigmatic story. Shot over two days, the film is highly narrative, taking a documentary approach that was sensitive to the peoples of Makoko. Akinola worked with local fixers and a charity to ensure a positive impact for the communities they filmed.\n\nAkinola Davies Jr is a BAFTA nominated and Sundance award- winning Filmmaker, Visual Artist, and Music Curator, whose work spans nations to explore themes of community, race, spirituality, identity and gender, telling stories that bridge the gap between traditional and millennial communities.
