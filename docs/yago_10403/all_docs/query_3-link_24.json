        "text": "1934\n\n1 hr 13 mins\n\nDrama\n\nNR\n\nWatchlist\n\nWhere to Watch\n\nFilmed in Switzerland, Magic Mountain was inspired by Separation des Races, a novel by Ramud, and was originally released as Rapt. Set high in the Alps, the story concerns a romance blighted by ethnic differences. The plot is subordinated throughout by the \"arty\" photography, which borrows heavily from the German expressionistic school. With the exception of German leading lady Dita Parlo, most of the cast of The Magic Mountain is French."
