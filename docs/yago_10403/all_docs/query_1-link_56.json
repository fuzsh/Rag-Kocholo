        "text": "63\n\nSlant Magazine by\n\nIt presents itself in a sleek suit and tie, carrying itself from the moment it enters the room with a steadfast gait that suggests there's no dotted line it can't get us to agree to sign.\n\n83\n\nIndieWire by Eric Kohn\n\nProgressing with a coldly observational pace, Rapt often strains its drawn-out structure, creating a lethargic experience despite essentially taking the form of a Bressonian suspense-thriller.\n\n90\n\nVariety by Jordan Mintzer\n\nThe issues come clashing together in an explosive package that, despite some snafus, remains fairly riveting to the end.\n\n50\n\nVillage Voice by Melissa Anderson\n\nThe growing disgust of both his family and business associates, all hazily drawn, may knock the magnate down, but it's a limp substitute for the public fury that still burns after the fall of 2008.\n\n83\n\nThe A.V. Club by Sam Adams\n\nWhile the back-and-forth between various parties grows tiresome through repetition, Rapt rallies with a lengthy epilogue in which the aftermath of Attal's ordeal proves more draining than the physical privation that preceded it.\n\n75\n\nNew York Post by V.A. Musetto\n\nYvan Attal and Anne Consigny give understated but powerful performances as Graff and his wife, Fran√ßoise. Although a bit too long, Rapt makes for compelling viewing."
