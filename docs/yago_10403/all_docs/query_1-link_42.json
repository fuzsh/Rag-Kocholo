        "text": "DANCE FILMS and TRAILERS\n\nRaptâ€™s biggest passion is making dance films. With many of our team members being professional dancers as well as filmmakers, dance holds a special place in our collective creative hearts. Many members of the Rapt team also work in collaboration with the San Francisco Dance Film Festival. We also produce the trailers for the festival every year.\n\nBranded Content & Documentaries\n\nRapt was born over twenty years ago out of a desire to tell the story of dance in the Bay Area. From that desire, the feature length documentary Artists in Exile was created. In 2011, we completed our second feature documentary, Stage Left: a Story of Theater in San Francisco. From Emmy nominated feature documentaries to short branded content, we continue to create for a variety of arts, education, and business organizations. It is our passion to share their stories in a meaningful way so that the public might better understand the important work they do.\n\nPerFORMANCE & EVENT CAPTURE, LIVE-STREAMING & EDITING\n\nRapt has been capturing performance in a highly crafted way for decades. Every videographer is trained in the specialized Rapt Technique, praised by grant panel members as highly effective in the successful transmission of live performance through video documentation. We continue to strive to find new ways to enhance this process, including choreographing the camera with the dance.\n\nWe also film events, presentations, and classes, in addition to providing single and multi-camera live-streaming."
