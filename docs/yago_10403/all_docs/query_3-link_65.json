        "text": "RAPT is a \"cool and ingenious thriller\" (Andrew O'Hehir, Salon.com) packed with sexual betrayal and political intrigue.\n\nWealthy industrialist Stanilas Graff (Yvan Attal) is kidnapped in a daring daylight operation, and held ransom for 50 million Euros. As his family scrambles to raise the funds, his multi-national company is more concerned with massaging public opinion and limiting their financial exposure. Before long, the unsavory details of Graff's personal life are splashed over the tabloids. He is revealed to be an inveterate gambler, adulterer and worse, and with this disgrace the private urgency to free him disappears. It is left to the police to secure his escape. For Graff, however, the world he might return to has become just as dangerous and lonely as the one in which he is imprisoned.\n\nDirected with elegance and precision by Lucas Belvaux, RAPT is \"a nail-biting, emotionally charged captivity policier\" (LA Times) that also resonates powerfully with contemporary economic and political realities."
