        "text": "ON THE RUN\n\n(three stars)\n\nFast-moving thriller.\n\nIn French with English subtitles. Running time: 117 minutes. Not rated. At the Angelika, corner of Houston and Mercer Streets.\n\nAN enjoyably spare and fast- moving French thriller, “On the Run” (its French title is “Cavale”) is the first part of “The Trilogy,” an acclaimed cinema experiment by actor-director Lucas Belvaux.\n\nThe three films in Belvaux’ trilogy feature the same characters and unfold around the same core events, but the other two, “An Amazing Couple” and “After the Life,” are, respectively, a romantic comedy and a melodrama.\n\nEach film stands by itself but fills in important gaps in the other two.\n\n“On the Run” begins explosively with a violent prison breakout by Bruno (Belvaux), a Marxist terrorist, with the help of an accomplice on the outside.\n\nIt’s a gripping sequence that sets the understated tone for the rest of the film.\n\nThere’s no needless gore or indulgence in slow motion bullet-impacts; much of the camerawork is handheld from the back of the car; and the dialogue is minimal.\n\nThough he’s been in prison for 15 years, Bruno has little problem evading the police and making his way to his hometown of Grenoble, where he tries to make contact with his former comrades and restart a bombing campaign.\n\nIt becomes clear that Bruno’s group, the “armee populaire,” was remarkably well-armed and well-funded and that he himself is a disciplined, skilled professional – scenes in which he calmly prepares for missions are reminiscent of “Day of the Jackal.”\n\nBut Bruno finds his comrades have changed, and for one reason or another, none of them want to get back in the game.\n\nMost disappointingly this includes his ex-girlfriend, Jeanne (Catherine Frot), who’s now a married schoolteacher with a child. Though she’s willing to give him keys to the group’s old safe houses, she’s lost any taste she had for killing and blowing things up.\n\nTerrorism has never entirely ceased to be chic in France, and Bruno’s decent side is shown by the way he goes to the aid of a female junkie being beaten up by a pusher.\n\nBy fortunate coincidence, she then turns out to be the wife of the cop who’s leading the hunt against him.\n\nThough “On the Run” is a welcome reminder that effective thrillers don’t have to be noisy or dumb, the film does contain slightly jarring moments of inadvertent humor (as when Bruno dons obviously fake mustaches, beards and wigs) and possibly deliberate spillover from the other films in the trilogy."
