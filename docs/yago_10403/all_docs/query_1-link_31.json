        "text": "Belvaux writes his characters in shades of greys, and his cast is smart enough to play on that moral ambiguity as much as possible.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 7.5/10 | Jul 3, 2019\n\nBelvaux establishes the professionalism of the kidnappers and observes the poker-faced boardroom violence of Stanislas's firm. A late attempt at Chabrolian irony doesn't take, but the story is entertainingly tense while it lasts.\n\nFull Review | Jul 1, 2013\n\n\"Rapt'' is smooth, cool, and efficient. It's a movie with very little wasted motion - or, for much of its length, wasted emotion.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Sep 15, 2011\n\nBelvaux, who wrote the script, defies genre expectations at every turn while still providing apt doses of tension and depravity.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Sep 13, 2011\n\n[Belvaux'] latest isn't the thriller/policier one might expect, but instead is a tantalizing look at his own kind of 'man who wasn't there.'\n\nFull Review | Original Score: B+ | Sep 12, 2011\n\nWhat lends \"Rapt\" its fascination is that it represents such a dramatic fall from grace for its hero.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Sep 1, 2011\n\nA slick, inventive and grippingFrench kidnap drama which doesn't so much deliver an adrenaline shot of nervy thrills as steadily ooze disquieting tension over the course of its two-hour running time.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: A- | Aug 14, 2011\n\n\"Rapt\" fuses strands of dramatic tension in a shrewd enough way that it even saves its sharpest cuts for the kidnapping's aftermath, when a well-heeled life laid bare must reconcile with a much different form of enforced solitude.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Aug 11, 2011\n\nWhat distinguishes \"Rapt\" from other kidnapping movies is that, virtually as soon as he is abducted, details of his life start coming out.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jul 21, 2011\n\nThe kind of film that serves as rigid, nicely paced entertainment during its two-hour running time, then can be counted on to jump-start conversation on the drive home.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jul 14, 2011\n\nFor two rapt hours, I also felt extremely fortunate not to be a rich and powerful industrialist.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Jul 10, 2011"
