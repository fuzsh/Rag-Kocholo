        "text": "With her most recent film “In A Better World” is expected to walk away with the Best Foreign Film Oscar, Susanne Bier has already moved onto her next project says Deadline.\n\nBier’s longtime writing collaborator Anders Thomas Jensen (“Brothers,” “After the Wedding”) is said to be almost done with the script for “Rapt”, a remake of the Cesar-nominated French true story thriller.\n\nThe story follows a corporate chairman who is held for ransom by a group of crims. In the meantime his family, the company and the police are pitted against each other in a battle of wills.\n\nShooting is aiming to get off the ground before the end of the year for release in 2012. Lorber Films will release the original at NYC’s Film Forum on July 7th."
