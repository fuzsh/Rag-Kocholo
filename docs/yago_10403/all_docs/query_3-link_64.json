Some of our favourite films from last year started out as a short. Over half of the film industry are thought to enter via shorts, yet some – without established industry connections – can find the routes challenging to navigate. We want to hear all about that journey so this week, dialling into our Bristol studio are Abdou Cisse for Festival of Slaps (2023), Dina Mousawi and Elham Ehas for Yellow (2023), Joe Weiland for Gorka (2023), Yasmin Afif for Jellyfish and Lobster (2023) and Simon Woods for Such A Lovely Day (2023). We hear about their individual routes into filmmaking, how each made their film on a shoestring budget and their plans to take their filmmaking to that next level. This episode is in collaboration with BAFTA. A full transcript for this episode can be found here. Hosted on Acast.
