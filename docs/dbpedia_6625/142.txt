PlayStation Portable

Initially released on December 12, 2004, PSP (PlayStation Portable) is a brand of portable, handheld video game consoles sold by Sony. PSP devices are composed of a small LED (light-emitting diode) screen with controls on both sides. The button layout closely resembles a DualShock controller, which is sold with other PlayStation consoles. Physical games for the PSP were sold in a proprietary format called UMD (Universal Media Disc). They could also be purchased digitally through the PlayStation Store.

In 2014, PlayStation Portable consoles were discontinued after the release of their successor, the PlayStation Vita in 2011.
