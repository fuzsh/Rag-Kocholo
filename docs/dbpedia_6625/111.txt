Forgive me, but I missed it when Exit originally hit the PlayStation Portable more than a year ago. But I have the ability to look back at what my cohorts have written about the title, and it's clear that, well, the franchise has had some rough beginnings. This feeling is pretty much translated into my hands-on with the Nintendo DS version that Taito had on display at its booth during the Tokyo Game Show.

So the original PlayStation Portable game features a dark and dashing hero in the lead, Mr. Esc, as he sets off into dangerous environments to rescue people in peril. This is the theme of the Nintendo DS version, too. The PSP's visual style is translated to the DS pretty well using an engine that blends 2D backgrounds with 3D characters.

But what really stinks about this game is the controls: it's entirely touch-screen operated, and the way the player manipulates Mr. Esc, he doesn't do what you want him to do with any sort of regularity. Want him to climb up a ledge? Swipe the stylus at an upwards diagonal when you guide him there. Unless, of course, you want him to shove a box against a wall, which then means you swipe horizontally towards that object. But if he decides to instead climb that box rather than push it, wellâ€¦that's your problem, isn't it?

Exit DS was an exercise in frustration, and I'm hoping that it was simply because the game was still in some sort of early stage of development. This is almost confirmed after getting Mr. Exit stuck in a wall several times when I accidentally commanded him to get on his knees and crawl when in a small gap in the floor. Whoops.
