        "text": "While Spider-Man 2 is still renowned for being one of the best superhero games of all time, the PSP version was a shorter-lived experience that brought exhilarating action to our fingertips. It actually featured the voices of Hollywood actors Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Alfred Molina, who starred in the 2004 Spider-Man movie, and had tons of mission variety that kept gameplay varied to ensure that the game never overstayed its welcome. Even after the sequel was released, I always found myself coming back to this game years later because I could never get enough.\n\n9 FIFA Street 2 (2006)\n\nFIFA Street took the world by storm in 2005, providing players with an experience unlike anything they had ever seen before (think NBA Jam, but miles better)! Up until Fifa Street was released, sports games were more or less what people expected; if a new installment was without any major graphical improvements, fans were unenthusiastic. FIFA Street brought us the uncut version of an everyday street football experience that players could relate to on a personal level.\n\nThe second version of the game perfected its formula and became a must-play game for football fans all over the world. It was easy enough for casual players to pick-and-play, but complex enough for veteran gamers to compete over. Chasing a new high score while attempting out-of-this-world combo moves with your favourite football player is surely a thrill like no other, especially without the fear of red cards.\n\n8 Patapon (2007)\n\nThere’s a good reason why people say, “Good luck getting 'Patapon' out of your head”. While it looks like a simple enough game on the surface, Patapon is in fact one of the most addictive and satisfyingly challenging games on the system. It’s a rhythm game that had you controlling the action by matching your button presses to the beat of the music. The game’s story followed a dominant tribe’s journey to seeking eternal happiness. It takes a surprising amount of skill and patience to prevail in this game, and it’s truly impressive how the developers even managed to incorporate boss fights into this game. It was truly a joy to play back then and still remains a joy today.\n\n7 Daxter (2006)\n\nFrom the developers of the renowned Uncharted and The Last of Us series, Jack & Daxter came to be one of the best action-platformer franchises of the early 2000s. The console versions of the game had set expectations really high, but I think it’s safe to say that the developers more than delivered on the handheld front. These kinds of games transitioned really well to handhelds, and Daxter was a witty adventure that was chaotic fun for old and new fans alike. Alas, it’s a shame that the series has been abandoned for generations, but at least we have old gems like Daxter to take a trip down memory lane.\n\n6 Burnout: Legends (2005)\n\nDespite being one of the best-looking games on the PSP, Tekken 6 played almost identically on the console and the handheld, proving to us what the PSP was truly capable of. This celebrated fighting game introduced new characters alongside beloved franchise favourites for an epic showdown that always kept you playing just “one more game”. Being huge fans back in the day, my sister and I constantly fought over our PSP to beat each other’s ranks, and just thinking about it brings a smile to my face. This is a game that you won’t regret getting!\n\n4 Persona 3 Portable (2006)\n\nOpen-world games were never expected to be released on the PSP due to its limited hardware and controls. However, Rockstar Games proved doubters wrong by successfully executing what others had tried and failed to do in the past. Vice City Stories brought us the same GTA chaos that we had grown to love and expect from the series, albeit in a smaller package. The freedom offered by the open-world was liberating and the controls worked flawlessly - accommodating well for the lack of a second analog stick. In my opinion, this game is the best out of all three GTA games released on the device.\n\n2 Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker (2010)\n\nNot only is Peace Walker one of the best games on the PSP, but it is also one of the best games in the entire Metal Gear Solid franchise. This game proved that a deeply engaging narrative can indeed be told on a handheld, breaking barriers in video game storytelling forever! It is still worth getting a PSP just to play this game even after all these years.\n\nBefore announcing our choice for the best PSP game of all time, let’s show some appreciation for these honourable mentions that didn’t make our final list:\n\n· Final Fantasy: Crisis Core (2007)\n\n· Gran Turismo (2009)\n\n· LocoRoco (2006)\n\n· Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters (2007)\n\n· Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror (2006)\n\n· Tomb Raider: Anniversary (2007)\n\n· Wipeout Pulse (2007)\n\n1 God of War: Ghost of Sparta (2010)\n\nThe best PSP game of all time is none other than Ghost of Sparta (seriously, were you expecting anything else?). One of the most popular PlayStation franchises ever, fans could not believe it when a God of War game was announced for the PSP, and the hype caught on pretty quick. The final release of the game was nothing short of a miracle, considering the scale of the whole thing. Ten years later, I still don’t know how they managed to pull off the final product on hardware that was half a decade old and provide us with a seamless experience that never stuttered. Thinking of the boss battles and the amazing journey in the game still gives me goosebumps today! Even with the radical shift in the new games, you can’t deny how well the old games were made. Ghost of Sparta is still a solid game today and deserves to be experienced by each and every one of us!\n\nThat was our list, and we hope it brought back some of your favourite memories with the PSP. Although the store may have been shut down, these experiences will remain close to our hearts, and we shall cherish these games for ages to come! (I am not crying, you are). Here’s to hoping that the PlayStation handhelds make a comeback soon and provide amazing experiences to another generation of players!\n\nFor more on PlayStation, click here to read how fans marked history by revoking a major decision by Sony earlier this year."
