        "text": "The following information is a compilation of what I've learned while surfing the web. I've put it together in a way that I believe a fellow PSP-Newbie can follow & understand. This means that a more experienced PSP user will probably find this literal Step-By-Step Guide to be overly detail oriented. I'm just posting it here in the hopes that this will help fellow newbies like myself.\n\nCopying your UMD game onto your Memory Stick\n\nThe only things you'll need are:\n\n-- Playstation Portable running custom firmware version 3.52 M33 or 3.71 M33 (or higher ;-)\n\n-- Your own PSP UMD game\n\n-- USB cable to connect your PSP to your computer\n\n-- Memory Stick (from here on we'll call it MS)(;-)\n\nIf your PSP is running 3.52 m33-4 or 3.71 m33 you already have a built in UMD ripper & you're ready to get down to business without the need of any other program or download.\n\nJust go into the \"M33 VSH MENU\" (3.52 M33: press \"Home\" on your PSP or 3.71 M33: press \"Select\" on your PSP) and switch the \"USB DEVICE\" to \"UMD disc\". You can also change the \"UMD ISO MODE\" to \"Sony NP9660\" if you don't want to need any kind of UMD game inserted in order to play the game from your memory stick. When you're done with that press the \"Home\" or \"Select\" button on your PSP to quickly exit the M33 VSH MENU.\n\n-- Choose the UMD game you want to copy to your MS, put it into your PSP & turn it on.\n\n-- Open \"M33 VSH MENU\" (press either \"Home\" or \"Select\"; depends on your M33 version)\n\n-- In \"USB DEVICE\" select \"UMD Disc\"\n\n-- OPTIONAL but highly recommended: In \"UMD ISO MODE\" select \"Sony NP9660\" so you can play the game without having to put a UMD game of any kind in your PSP. This will extend the use of your battery.\n\n-- Close the \"M33 VSH MENU\" (press either \"Home\" or \"Select\"; depends on your M33 version)\n\n-- Connect your PSP to your computer with a USB cord.\n\n-- Go into USB mode (Do this by scrolling to the far left icons on your XMB {main PSP menu} until \"USB Connection\" is highlighted & press the X button on your PSP).\n\nOk, so, you've connected your PSP to your computer with a USB cord. If you've followed the directions then you're ready to copy / back-up the UMD game. After your PSP is fully connected to your computer you'll notice a window opens up on your monitor. You'll see a single capital letter followed by \" :/ \" with an icon in the window. That window shows the copy of your game. It may say something like \"UMD9660 ISO Image file\". It's time to follow the next set of steps:\n\n-- Copy (drag & drop) that file onto your desktop (This is the game rip / copy / back-up that you want to put on your MS).\n\nAfter it's finished copying to your desktop:\n\n-- Rename it in order to differentiate it from any other copy you make.\n\n(right click on it & choose \"Rename\" ;-) )\n\n-- Exit USB Mode (press the O button on PSP)\n\n-- Open \"M33 VSH MENU\" (press either \"Home\" or \"Select\"; depends on your M33 version)\n\n-- Change \"USB DEVICE\" from \"UMD Disc\" back to \"Memory Stick\"\n\n-- ?? I'm not sure if you need to change \"UMD ISO MODE\" from \"M33 driver\" back to \"Normal\" if you usually have this set to \"Normal\" Does anyone know for sure about this?\n\n-- Close the \"M33 VSH MENU\" (press either \"Home\" or \"Select\"; depends on your M33 version)\n\n-- Go back into \"USB Connection\"\n\n(press X at \"USB Connection\" icon. You'll see a new window open on your monitor. You'll see the drive letter of your PSP's memory stick. You should see the following folders:\n\nISO\n\nMP_ROOT\n\nMUSIC\n\nPSP\n\nPICTURE\n\nVIDO\n\n{ MEMSTICK.IND & MSTK_PRO.IND aren't actually folders, but they show in my window}\n\n-- Copy (drag & drop) the UMD ISO Image file from your Desktop into your PSP's \"ISO\" file.\n\nAfter it's finished copying to your MS:\n\n-- Exit USB Mode (press the O button on PSP)\n\n-- Scroll to the \"Game\" icon of your XMB (main PSP menu)\n\n-- Open the \"Game\" Memory Stick icon (Scroll down to the \"Memory Stick\" icon & press X on your PSP)\n\n-- You'll see your game icon! Just start playing it by pressing X\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou may discover that your MS isn't big enough to store what you want. It's possible to shrink down the size of your copied game-files. You have a choice of leaving it in ISO format (which can be pretty large), or compressing it to cso (which somehow makes the original ISO file much, much smaller), BEFORE transfering to the memory stick. umdgen & ciso converter are two programs that will compress iso into cso. Check out: Winnydows.com's ISO Compressor that can compress ISO to CSO, DAX or JSO as well as decompress CSO, DAX or JSO to ISO.\n\nYou can save some time by copying a game to your Desktop (RENAME IT!), & immediately copy the next UMD game to your Desktop (don't forget to rename it immediately). Once you ripped all the games you want, go back into the \"M33 VSH MENU\"(the menu that pops up onscreen when you push the \"Home\" or \"Select\" button), switch the \"USB DEVICE\" from \"UMD Disc\" back to \"Memory Stick\" and exit. Then go back to \"USB Connection\" and enable it. The computer will show the memory stick contents again. Copy (drag and drop) each of the games to the ISO folder (which should be in the root of the memory stick. if there isn't any, create one in all caps; it should look like this, ms0:\\ISO). Bam! You've just copied multiple games onto your MS (^.^)\n\n--------------------\n\nWhen I have time I'll add some type of \"At a glance\" guide that isn't as rediculously detail oriented as this turned out to be (^.^)\n\n--------------------\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIgnore this part. I'm just listing possible Google-type search queries that may bring more traffic to this awesome site ^.^\n\n3.52 M33 user's manual\n\nHow to use 3.52 M33\n\nHow to use 3.71 M33\n\n3.71 M33 user's manual\n\nHow do I use 3.52 M33?\n\nHow do I use 3.71 M33?\n\n3.52 M33 vsh menu description\n\n3.71 M33 vsh menu description\n\nStep by Step Guide to copying your UMD game onto your Memory Stick\n\nThanks for the compliment & for giving me my very first +rep (^.^)\n\nI just discovered a quicker way to exit the M33 VSH Menu. When you're done making changes to the settings all you have to do is press \"Home\" or \"Select\" again. That's easier than scrolling down to EXIT & pressing X. I'll have to see if that streamlines anything in the guide. {EDIT: Just finished doing that. Not sure if it streamlined the guide, but I know it'll save quite a few presses of the buttons when in practice}\n\nAlso, x3sphere just pointed out how this guide can be used to copy UMD Movies too. I'll have to figure out how to add that info. I think I'll wait on that until I figure out what went wrong for me though. After I got my Lords of Dogtown UMD Movie copied to my MS & actually working...none of my UMD Games would work. I ended up having to completely power off my PSP. After leaving it off for a few minutes I turned it back on & everything was back to normal. I still don't understand what went wrong though. Very weird.\n\nIf anyone has any tips on how to use 3.52 M33 or 3.71 M33 custom firmwares then please tell me about them in my Need \"User's Manual\" for 3.52 M33 & 3.71 M33 thread. I could put together an actual guide for these new CF's. Although it'd be just fine by me if someone else beat me to it. These things take a lot of time to make!"
