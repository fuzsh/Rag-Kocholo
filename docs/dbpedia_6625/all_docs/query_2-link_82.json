        "text": "So, my kids were playing Astro’s Playroom the other day, and when they unlocked the PSP Go, I told them “We have this thing at home, let me fetch it”.\n\nDisclaimer: this is a copy of a Twitter thread I published back in March 2022. I’m hoping publishing it here will get it some visibility for those of you who don’t follow me on Twitter.\n\nI haven’t turned my PSP Go on in years, possibly a decade. Let’s have a look!\n\nHere it is! (I’m cheating, it was very dirty, I had to clean it up with alcohol before taking this picture. I almost threw up when I saw the color of the buttons)\n\nOf course, after a decade in a closet, the PSP won’t turn on. It took me a while to find the charger… I think that’s the right one?\n\nIt looks like it’s charging! That’s a miracle in itself. Let it sit for a few hours then come back. Fingers crossed!\n\nAnd the PSP Go still works after a decade of inactivity, ladies and gentlemen! I haven’t touched it in so long, I am excited to discover what’s on it, as I don’t remember at all.\n\nIt’s running on firmware 6.60…\n\nSome psp games related to usermode exploit research in there. Uno, Patapon, Hot Shots Golf in particular were used as entry points for PSP/Vita hacks:\n\nHappy new year! PSP Game UNO vulnerability revealed by Frostegater, port of CEF To Vita 2.02 incoming. (2012)\n\nWay to keep a secret malloxis (2010)\n\nHBL Released for 6.30/6.31 (2010)\n\nAfraid to click the PRO CIPL Flasher as I don’t clearly remember what it does. I decide to leave it for now\n\nSome homebrew on the console: rrootage, Touhou Imitation Style, Adventure Game Studio,… most releases seem to be around 2011 (as I said, haven’t touched it in a decade)\n\nAGS Port by JJS: play hundreds of indie games on your PSP! (2011)\n\nrRootage for PSP Download page\n\nThe list wouldn’t be complete without some emulation. The console has Snes9xTyl (SNES Emulator) installed.\n\nSnes9xTyl Download page\n\nAnd of course, my very own homebrew game, Wagic ( https://wololo.net/download/ ), which at this point was pretty much burned in on the internal flash…\n\nDid you notice Killzone Liberation in my photo above? This game was given to PSP owners for free as a commercial gesture by PlayStation, after a very long downtime of the PSN back in 2011. Remember what caused that downtime?\n\nBefore I try to run homebrew, I’m having a quick look at what else is on the console. I have a bit of music in there… the PSP was a great MP3 player! In an era where dedicated MP3 players were a thing, having a multi-purpose portable device was kind of new when the PS Launched\n\nRemember these? You could watch TV (with the dedicated accessory) and subscribe to some comic ebook service on the PSP…at least in Japan\n\nI enter the image folder, and… crash! Some tiff image in there that the console doesn’t like… Image lib vulnerabilities were a popular usermode entry point on the PSP. We didn’t have Webkit 🙂\n\nLet’s go back to homebrews. I haven’t run the 6.60 PRO exploit yet, so most homebrews refuse to start:\n\nRrootage is the exception. The homebrew was signed, meaning it behaves as a “legit” game and can run on an unhacked console. This signing technique was developed by hackers in 2011, following the discovery of critical PSP keys on the PS3.\n\nNow running PSP Pro Custom Firmware. This will install the hack in RAM, deactivate the console’s security, & allow me to run unsigned software. PSP Pro was one of the most popular CFWs for the PSP, because it defeated almost all games anti-piracy measures.\n\nMy unsigned homebrews now run! As to why some homebrews were unsigned even though we knew how to sign them and run them without a hack: unsigned homebrews had benefits, for example they could use more RAM\n\nThat’s all! I hope you enjoyed. It was a nice trip down memory lane for me 🙂\n\nWhat do you remember from the PSP days? Share in the comments below!"
