        "text": "Exit 2\n\nMr. ESC returns in the sequel to the puzzler Exit. The second adventure places a greater emphasis on challenging puzzle elements, with over 110 stages that put your brain to the test. In turn, the game's control scheme has been changed in order to deemphasize action and place the emphasis on puzzles -- you now input actions in order to make Mr. ESC move rather than directly control him. Among other gameplay refinements, you can now change your direction when climbing up a ladder. The game also adds new obstacles, like ropeways and escalators. You'll also find new types of survivors, including a dog, whose capable of making long jumps and swimming, and a \"macho,\" a male or female character who, as the name suggests has tremendous strength. And returning for the sequel is the ability to download new content after the game's release."
