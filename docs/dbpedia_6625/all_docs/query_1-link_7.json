Inwa initially disappointed they weren't traditional MGS games, but I ended up loving them. I think they'd be solid podcast games.\n\nPeace Walker is balanced around multiplayer and bosses can be annoying alone. It's mission based and otherwise fun. It definitely shares a lot of DNA with MGS V.\n\nPortable Ops is missing QOL stuff from it, but I liked it and it has better bosses at least. Ive only played the PS3 version of PW, so I don't know how different the controls are on PSP.\n\nThe GTA Stories games are great, too.\n\nTimPV3\n\nOct 30, 2017\n\n662\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#11\n\nLoved Megaman Maverick Hunter X and Gurumin back in the day.\n\ndemi\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n15,401\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#12\n\nA lot of of PSP games are available on other platforms in one way or another, thankfully\n\nBut not Metal Gear Acid!

GoW games are close second. I also recommend Patapon and LocoRoco.\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#17\n\nThe two Valkyria Chronicles games on psp have some story missions, but it's designed like MGS Peace Walker / Monster Hunter.

(I think. My PSPs were always modded so I might have just used an MP3 player plugin in the background lol.) Not entirely necessary though, as both games have absolutely banging soundtracks.\n\nAlso, Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together is a GOAT-tier turn-based strategy game. And a PERFECT podcast game. It's similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, but with larger-scale battles and more character/class customization.\n\nThe recently-released Tactics Ogre Reborn is a remastering of that game, with some pretty large mechanical changes. I personally prefer the PSP version, aside from a few particular QOL additions in the remaster (like nixxing chance-based crafting). It's got plenty of story to engage in whenever you feel like it.\n\nBigkrev\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n12,576\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#21\n\nI know you said no Puzzle games so I'll avoid the obvious ones, but you might want to check out Crush which may feel like enough of a platformer to you to enjoy.\n\nBasilZero\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n37,365\n\nOmni\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#22\n\nExcluding games that got remade or ported over to modern platforms\n\nFinal Fantasy Dissidia/Duodecim 12\n\nFinal Fantasy I Anniversary\n\nFinal Fantasy II Anniversary\n\nFinal Fantasy IV Complete Collection\n\nGrand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories\n\nGrand Theft Auto Vice City Stories\n\nBreath of Fire III\n\nDarkstalkers Chronicle Chaos Tower\n\nGod of War Chains of Olympus\n\nGod of War Ghost of Sparta\n\nMetal Gear Ac!d\n\nMetal Gear Ac!d 2\n\nPersona 1 Portable (Story heavy but I still recommend it)\n\nPersona 2 Innocent Sin (Story heavy but I still recommend it)\n\nTales of Eternia\n\nTekken 5 Dark Resurrection\n\nThere's a few others I think I'm missing but these are the ones that come to mind.\n\nHopefully these will end up in the PSP classics or get ported/remastered.\n\nsir_crocodile\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n24,003\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#23\n\nHalf Minute Hero is one of the best games ever made. Kind of an oddball arcadish rpg and easily the best game on the platform.\n\nJeanne D'arc\n\nGrowlanser : Wayfarer of Time\n\nWild Arms XF/Megaman X Maverick Hunter/R-Type Tactics/Hexyz Force are not bad. X is really only because of the new Vile mode tho, otherwise it's not much different then the snes one other than graphics. Breath of Fire 3 is marginally better on PSP then PSX, so that too if you've never played it on PSX.\n\nLot of RPGs in my list tho, which obv have a lot of story so YMMV on how much is \"too much\" for you\n\nviotech3\n\nJul 31, 2020\n\n5,437\n\nMaryland\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#24\n\nRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrridge Rrrrrrrrrrrrracers 2!~\n\n(There are many amazing games on PS, too many to list)\n\nMupod\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n6,219\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#25\n\nWell I was gonna say Lumines but no puzzle I guess. Patapon is pretty neat and leaves a good first impression but gets old rather quick, well worth trying.\n\nMonster Hunter Freedom Unite and Portable 3rd were great at the time but not a whole lot of reason to go back to those nowadays unless you're really curious about 2nd gen MH.\n\nCastlevania Dracula X Chronicles is a 2.5D remake of Rondo of Blood and includes both that and SOTN. If you've already played Rondo and liked it, it's still worth playing because they mix it up a bit. If you haven't played Rondo it's easily my favorite classic/non-metroidvania game in the series.\n\nTo be honest I had a ton of PSP games and just used it as a Monster Hunter machine 99% of the time. Rest of that was the above games and Crisis Core, the latter of which has other options these days.\n\nShinobido Heart\n\nDec 23, 2017\n\n8,786\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#26\n\nPhantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity but you need a translation patch.\n\nReturning to Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity with PPSSPP.\n\nIt has been roughly 10 years since I last played Phantasy Star Portable 2... Portable 2 was an absolute blast to play if you had a PSP back then. It was essentially a single player action adventure game and an MMO right in your pocket, play it on the go or at home, and join one of the many...\n\nstn\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n5,864\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#27\n\nDissidia 012\n\nKenka Bancho: Badass Rumble\n\nTekken DR\n\nI'm sure I am missing a bunch but these are my favorites.\n\n.exe\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n22,661\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#28\n\nRidge Racer and Ridge Racer 2 could be the only games on PSP and I would be satisfied.\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#29\n\nAssuming you want English games: Popolocrois, Burnout Legends, Metal Gear AC!D 2, Crush, Space Invaders Extreme, Exit, Loco Roco, and Valkyria Chronicles 2.\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#30\n\nWild Arms XF\n\nPhantasy Star Portable 1/2\n\nPeace Walker\n\nGitaroo Man\n\nLord of Apocalypse\n\nMy Summer Vacation Portable\n\nRidge Racers 1/2\n\nPersona 1/2 remakes\n\nToukiden Kiwami\n\nMonster Hunter Portable 3rd\n\nSpace Invaders Extreme\n\nExit\n\nMG Acid 1/2\n\nDissidia\n\nMega Man Powered Up\n\nBrandish\n\nBurnout Legenda\n\nColin McRae\n\nEverybody's Golf\n\nI really want to see Wild Arms XF and MM Powered Up get some more love.

Some games from my collection\n\nIf you're a Silent Hill fan, I highly recommend the Silent Hill experience. It's not a game but has tons of cool Silent Hill content.\n\npsynergyadept\n\nShinra Employee\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n16,650\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#41\n\nFinal Fantasy Dissidia/Duodecim; It's an absolute travesty Square hasn't ported these!!! To say they're \"leaving money on the table\" is a fucking understatement!!!\n\nAsk so CRIMSON GEM SAGA!!! Any time a psp recommendation thread pops up I have to highlight thus game. An absolutely fantastic jrpg few have played…then come wallow an despair as well never get a sequel!\n\nRodney McKay\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n12,813\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#42\n\nDaxter: Probably my favorite game in the Jak and Daxter series. None of the crappy vehicles and open worlds from 2+3, and IMO it has even more fun levels and platforming than 1.\n\nTomb Raider Anniversary: not an exclusive, and if you have a PC or any other version of the game is probably better, but I thought the game was fantastic when I played it on PSP back in the day. Some big levels and fun puzzles to solve.\n\nX-men Legends 2: perfect portable RPG/Beat 'em up for the system. Marvel Ultimate Alliance is also on PSP, but for some reason I always preferred Legends 2. Maybe I'm just more of an X-men fan (even though there's a decent amount in MUA).\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#43\n\nUnironically\n\nRock Band Unplugged.\n\nI spent so much time playing that game.\n\nMaNuu\n\nMay 11, 2024\n\n55\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#44\n\nPatapon 1 and 2\n\nMonster Hunter (don't remember the exact name, think it was ultimate or something)\n\nMetal gears (the second one made for PSP)\n\nKingdom Hearts birth by sleep\n\nsrtrestre\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n19,081\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#45\n\nToo many to count but I will highlight Ultimate Ghosts n Goblins.

The 1080p 60FPS console version with dual analog control is way better if you're just planning to play it at home.\n\nKazooie\n\nJul 17, 2019\n\n5,417\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#48\n\nLocoRoco is pretty nice and unique.\n\nTYRANITARR\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n4,257\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n#49\n\nHalf minute hero\n\nDissida Final Fantasy\n\n...
