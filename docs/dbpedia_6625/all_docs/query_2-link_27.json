A new Animal crossing & Splatoon would also not be shocking to be release its first 1-3 years of its life cycle.\n\nWhere does this put PlayStation. PC ports already converting PS gamers to migrate to other platforms as PS no longer has permanent exclusive to compete & strengthens its platform & storefront. And Sony reporting down year over year just after 4 years of PS5 being in the market (you can argue the first 2 years didn’t allow PlayStation to truly sell PS5 which the down year is shocking but can explain the lack of first party exclusive from first party PS studios having 1 or no major games in 2023 & 2024 making Sony miss 2023 targets of 25 million PS5 sold which would break all time record for PlayStation.\n\nI fully expect Nintendo with its crazy lineup to easily break 25 million once again showing Sony wrong that the old models for profits proves to be the reliable correct strategy to follow. (I think Nintendo can sell 25 million consoles multiple times in its first 1-2 years maybe even 3 years if they’re line up crazy.\n\nNintendo Switch 2 is rumored to be in the same power as the PS4 which will allow Nintendo to capitalize on 3rd party that never release on Nintendo console & what where once exclusive to PS previous, will see much aggressive competition from Nintendo with devs now releasing most if not all 3rd party games on Nintendo & PS.\n\nAnd depending on 3rd party relationship. We could see a Nintendo that has exclusive Monster Hunter, Dragon Quest & Final Fantasy (if Nintendo is aggressive which I do see happening) skipping PS which would be crazy all while PS continues to lower there wall garden & further allow there platform & storefront to diminish & become obsolete & relevant long term.\n\nSony is putting themselves in the same position as Xbox. I could see a future where PS is all in PC ignoring all negative effects slowly boiling themselves like a frog where devs focus on PC & Nintendo & if Steam wanted to replace PS they would push Steamdeck as the hybrid console that can play PC, Xbox & PS games all in one platform. Steam also making new games would further push there already dominate & almost defacto platform & storefront in gaming.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how PlayStation navigate while not having exclusive to make its platform & storefront a defacto platform. Even if Sony announce a PS6 or if the PS6 is a hybrid handheld PS no longer has permanent exclusive all of there first party games are time exclusive & there will be a Steamdeck that can play those games once the get ported while also having the benefit of PC & having cheaper prices from sales, no pay online subscription plus Steam has its Valve permanent exclusive & exclusive PC games that don’t go to PS.\n\nAlso if Xbox somehow builds a open PC hybrid handheld that allows you to play Xbox, PS & PC games in 1 platform MS would ironically be more invested in hardware then PS themselves as a PS console would only have PS games missing Xbox games be it Xbox games get ported 1 year later & PC games.\n\nImo Sony is dumb for following Xbox disastrously failed strategy. Sony made there slow death bed & MS is probably laughing Sony decided to drop there wall garden no longer allowing PS to fully kill off Xbox. Unless Sony changes plan I doubt I continue investing on the PS platform & storefront that has to many holes & cautious signs for me to fully invest in the long run. I’m already in the procces of fully migrating to PC & Nintendo all I’m waiting for is if PS next leader continues this path that has diminished, harm & out risk of the PS brand identity & if the Switch 2 will be at the power of a PS4 which can play beautiful games like Uncharted 4, TLOU2, GOT, GOW if it does it will be an easy decision where to invest my money in the long run on a safe platform since I don’t ever see Steam or Nintendo ever dropping there wall gardens & seeking other methods such as mobile, live service, park, cross media, toys & other methods for increase profits & expansion that won’t harm, diminish its identity or put them at risk of Nintendo ability to be highly competitive.\n\nGiving how the gaming industry is heading more mobile w traditional console going away & hybrid handhelds taking the place of console where does PlayStation stands against its competitor imo there position in a awkward & dangerous spot within gaming & hardware.\n\nToday ex 3rd party relationship joined Nintendo prior to the Switch 2 release.\n\nWith Nintendo doubling down on it’s hardware hybrid handheld console it seems like Nintendo is head for a major cadence the first 3 years w fans speculating a new smash or smash dlc, a new Pokémon already announced for 2025, a new 3D Mario speculated & a new Mario Kart 3/4 out of these options are very likely to release the first 1-2 years w other games like a new Metroid to be rumored to be release in its first year.

Playstation as we know it has long since disappeared.\n\nPS4 generation\n\nPS5 generation\n\nAnd Sony reporting down year over year just after 4 years of PS5 being in the market (you can argue the first 2 years didn’t allow PlayStation to truly sell PS5 which the down year is shocking but can explain the lack of first party exclusive from first party PS studios having 1 or no major games in 2023 & 2024 making Sony miss 2023 targets of 25 million PS5 sold which would break all time record for PlayStation.\n\nSony isn't reporting down YoY. In FY23 they performed better than FY22 in almost all areas in all quarters:\n\nAnd decreases would be normal because the industry still has been going back to normality after the covid bump. In the specific case of hardware, the yearly sales of any console make a curve, with the peak year being normally between 2nd and 5th year. In case of PS5 the peak it should have been FY23, meaning, should go down after that every year.\n\nBut because of being the normal case of any console lifecycle (same reason of why Switch hardware sales keep decreasing).\n\nI fully expect Nintendo with its crazy lineup to easily break 25 million once again showing Sony wrong that the old models for profits proves to be the reliable correct strategy to follow. (I think Nintendo can sell 25 million consoles multiple times in its first 1-2 years maybe even 3 years if they’re line up crazy.\n\nNintendo Switch 2 is rumored to be in the same power as the PS4 which will allow Nintendo to capitalize on 3rd party that never release on Nintendo console & what where once exclusive to PS previous, will see much aggressive competition from Nintendo with devs now releasing most if not all 3rd party games on Nintendo & PS.\n\nAnd depending on 3rd party relationship.

They have very different strategies and very different results.\n\nI could see a future where PS is all in PC ignoring all negative effects slowly boiling themselves like a frog\n\nThe evidence says there are no negative effects so far, in any case there are positive effects.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how PlayStation navigate while not having exclusive to make its platform & storefront a defacto platform. Even if Sony announce a PS6 or if the PS6 is a hybrid handheld PS no longer has permanent exclusive all of there first party games are time exclusive & there will be a Steamdeck that can play those games once the get ported while also having the benefit of PC & having cheaper prices from sales, no pay online subscription plus Steam has its Valve permanent exclusive & exclusive PC games that don’t go to PS.\n\nSony is already becoming one of the top PC publishers with mostly PC ports of old games and the old Destiny 2. Adding more PC ports of old game and more successful new GaaS, they'll become one of the top publishers on PC. I don't think they'll go day one on PC with all their games (I think new SP games will continue being released 2+ years later), but if they do it maybe even the top 1 publisher on PC.\n\nThat would mean they would be the leaders of both console and PC gaming.\n\nAlso if Xbox somehow builds a open PC hybrid handheld that allows you to play Xbox, PS & PC games in 1 platform MS would ironically be more invested in hardware then PS themselves as a PS console would only have PS games missing Xbox games be it Xbox games get ported 1 year later & PC games.\n\nI think MS will announce soon their PC handheld featuring Windows, featuring their store but being open to install there Steam, Epic Store, potential future PC PSN store, emulators and so on.\n\nI think Sony will do it some years later, releasing it as a PS Portal successor for PS6 that also includes cloud gaming and running natively minimum Sony's PC and mobile games.\n\nImo Sony is dumb for following Xbox disastrously failed strategy.\n\nSony isn't following the Xbox strategy. They have a different one that is way more successful.\n\nSony made there slow death bed & MS is probably laughing Sony decided to drop there wall garden no longer allowing PS to fully kill off Xbox. Unless Sony changes plan I doubt I continue investing on the PS platform & storefront that has to many holes & cautious signs for me to fully invest in the long run. I’m already in the procces of fully migrating to PC & Nintendo all I’m waiting for is if PS next leader continues this path that has diminished, harm & out risk of the PS brand identity & if the Switch 2 will be at the power of a PS4 which can play beautiful games like Uncharted 4, TLOU2, GOT, GOW if it does it will be an easy decision where to invest my money in the long run on a safe platform since I don’t ever see Steam or Nintendo ever dropping there wall gardens & seeking other methods such as mobile, live service, park, cross media, toys & other methods for increase profits & expansion that won’t harm, diminish its identity or put them at risk of Nintendo ability to be highly competitive.\n\nEven if Sony grew their walled garden breaking several records in gaming history for any console maker and they are broke sales records with their 1st party games on console almost every recent year (2020, 2022, 2023), that wallen garden won't be big enough to make profitable big non-GaaS SP AAA games that had sales of Days Gone, Bloodborne, Death Stranding, Returnal, Demon's Souls or Sackboy now that big AAA budgets are going $300M-$400M, because they'd need over 10M copies to become profitable.\n\nAnd they work in over two dozens big games at the same time. So they need extra revenue. GaaS are becoming too huge in console, and also PC and mobile are bigger markets than PS. So Sony is expanding their growth in GaaS, PC and mobile (areas where they already have been since forever btw, even if with a more secondary approach).\n\nThey run a business that need to keep profitable and with a healthy revenue and userbase growth. That's their priority, not to make happy some fanboys who are angry because someone else now can also play their games. For them GaaS, PC and mobile are huge markets -almost new for them- where they can grow a lot in terms of userbase, revenue and profit. So they'll go for it. Which is also compatible with to continue growing in console as they did in recent years.\n\nPS4 generation\n\nIn the left there's the PS Studios head (back then known as SCE Worldwide Studios) who started the strategy of expanding PS 1st party games to PC and GaaS, and greenlighting many of the GaaS, remasters, remakes and PC ports we saw recently.\n\nIn the right there's the guy in charge of porting TLOUP1 remake (greenlighted by Yoshida), Uncharted 4 and Uncharted Legacy of Thieves to PC.\n\nForwards compatibility is the killer. Why upgrade from a PS4/pro when I can still play the most popular titles?\n\nUpgrade to a PS5 for; returnal and ratchet. That's not enough incentive.\n\nOT: Op, call me a doomer but I think it's too late for any course correction to have a meaningful impact. Yes, Sony need to change course, they need to return to tradition and reject the modern AAA industry as soon as possible.\n\nLeave behind the politics on both sides that the common man is sick of.\n\nLeave behind the majority of games being high budget.\n\nLeave behind the chasing of cross platforms.\n\nReturn to; high powered console at a reasonable price with quick turnaround games and reduced the dev time from 7 years to 18 months. The time to triangle this gen is a joke.\n\nRebuild the A/AA markets.\n\nRevamp and resurrect old IPs instead of letting them sit dormant.\n\nReturn to being Sony 1994 and not Microsoft 2014.\n\nI think it would be better to stop making -at least most of- their games bigger and bigger and instead scale back to make more shorter, 10-30 hours long games, but why do you want Sony to stop focusing making AAA games and focus on indie sized games instead? Their best 1st and 3rd selling games on their platform are the big ass ones, not the indies.\n\nPeople in this forums are constantly crying saying that Sony haz no games when they have a record amount of games under development at the same time, and also say that their smaller projects \"don't count\".\n\nAnd well, AA and even many indie games take way more than 18 months to be made, this isn't realistic at all to ask Sony to make games in a year and a half. Also, the idea is to make more money, not less. Most indie games don't sell a shit compared to big Sony AAA games.\n\nAnd if they'd stop making AAA games, why would they want a powerful console?\n\nRegarding course correction, doesn't make any sense to correct anything when they are better than ever and growing in basically all areas. The logical thing would be to continue with the strategy that is helping them to grow in all areas.\n\nReturn to being Sony 1994 and not Microsoft 2014.\n\nThey are in the market of 2024, not the one of 1994 or 2014. The games that sell are different and way more complex, so they require a lot of more work to be made.\n\nAnd the Sony of 2024 is being way more successful than the Sony 1944 and Microsoft 2014 combined, and in a yearly pattern of growth in all areas. Which means that they will continue being even more successful in 2025, 2026, etc."
