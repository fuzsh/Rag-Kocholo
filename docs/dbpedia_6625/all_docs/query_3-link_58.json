        "text": "The quest to redeem Kratos\n\nLiving as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.\n\n“The son is the humanity that Kratos lost. He’s that mirror that’s reminding him that there is a different way, a way that he might have forgotten so long ago.\n\n-Cory Barlog, Creative Director\n\nAtreus is the humanity that Kratos lost\n\n\"From a story perspective, Atreus is the humanity that Kratos lost. He's helping Kratos understand what it was like to be a human and Kratos is trying to help the kid understand what it means to be a god. The kid has no idea about any of that stuff. They're both sort of teaching each other a little bit and kind of helping each other hobble through a very difficult emotional journey.\"\n\n-Cory Barlog, Creative Director (Mashable)\n\n“Atreus only knows the world that he lives in with his dad. They've lived in this forest, a very small area. They're going out on the road together. Dad is just Dad. You don't really know any different. That's just a parameters for his life. As he starts to learn who he is, how he fits into all of this and who his dad is, it's an interesting sort of way that—he sees life differently than we see Kratos. He allows us to see Kratos with a slightly different lens because he's experiencing it all differently.”\n\n-Cory Barlog, Creative Director (Vice)\n\nAtreus is the humanity that Kratos lost\n\n\"From a story perspective, Atreus is the humanity that Kratos lost. He's helping Kratos understand what it was like to be a human and Kratos is trying to help the kid understand what it means to be a god. The kid has no idea about any of that stuff.

He allows us to see Kratos with a slightly different lens because he's experiencing it all differently.”\n\n-Cory Barlog, Creative Director (Vice)\n\nFights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.\n\n\"Right away the magic of throwing the axe, having it stick anywhere in the world, and then recalling it, and then kind of playing around with that, and realizing you can hit people with it, you can throw it behind them, move in front of them, recall it and hit him in the back.\"\n\n-Cory Barlog, Creative Director (GamesRadar+)\n\nFrom the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods.\n\n“We don’t force you to go find something, but when you do, you are rewarded. You are rewarded with things like “Wow, there’s an entire level over here!” And I think that sense of discovery is so important. Linearity can drive you through this fantastic story – you’re always going to be driven forward by the development and arc of the characters – but at any given point in this game, you can pull the lever on the bus and stop to look around, and then get back on the bus and keep going.\"\n\n- Cory Barlog, Creative Director (Game Informer)\n\nPrehistory point\n\nWhile real Norse lore and mythology was extensively researched by our team and is often heavily drawn from, this is our unique twist on the Pre-Viking, Pre-Migration Era of Norse Mythology.\n\n\"In the Viking era, they always talked about, 'The gods have abandoned us.' Thor and Loki and Odin all walked the Earth at one point, but they're not around anymore. [The vikings] fight for them, but they're not there. This idea that we're at is saying, we're at a prehistory point, where gods did walk the Earth, when monsters were real before they became extinct.\"\n\n-Creative Director, Cory Barlog (GameSpot)\n\nScoring God of War\n\n\"My work on God of War began nearly two years ago. One rainy November afternoon, I was called into Santa Monica Studio to meet with acclaimed music producers Pete Scaturro and Keith Leary (with whom I had collaborated closely on Sony’s SOCOM 4: US Navy Seals), to discuss a secret project.\n\nOur conversation revolved around folk music, mythology, Nordic ethnic instruments, vocal writing, and classical thematic development. \"Wait a minute.\" I asked. \"Is this... a new God of War?!\" Their facial expressions told me everything I needed to know. And with that, I realized I was tumbling headfirst into a daunting and challenging dream project.\""
