        "text": "The PlayStation Portable[1] (PSP) is a handheld game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was first released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in PAL regions on September 1, 2005. It's the first handheld instalment in the PlayStation line of consoles. As a seventh-generation console, it competed with the Nintendo DS.\n\nThe PSP was announced during E3 2003, and the console was unveiled at a Sony press conference on May 11, 2004. The system was the most powerful portable console when revealed. The PSP was the first real competitor of Nintendo's handheld consoles after many challengers, such as Nokia's N-Gage, had failed. The PSP's advanced graphics capabilities made it a popular mobile entertainment device, connecting to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 consoles, computers with USB, other PSP systems, and the Internet. The PSP also had a vast array of multimedia features such as video playback. So has been considered a portable media player. The PSP is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its primary storage medium. Both games and movies were released on UMDs.\n\nThe PSP was received positively by critics and sold over 80 million units during its ten-year lifetime. Several console models were released before the PSP line was succeeded by the PlayStation Vita, released in Japan in 2011 and worldwide. The Vita is backwards compatible with PSP games released on the PlayStation Network through the PlayStation Store. It became the primary method to buy PSP games after Sony shut down access to the PSP store on March 31, 2016. Hardware shipments of the PSP ended worldwide in 2014; production of UMDs ended when the last Japanese factory producing them closed in late 2016.\n\nHistory[]\n\nSony Computer Entertainment first announced the development of the PlayStation Portable at a press conference preceding E3 2003. Although samples were not presented, Sony released extensive technical details. CEO Ken Kutaragi called the device the \"Walkman of the 21st century\", a reference to the console's multimedia capabilities. Several gaming websites were impressed with the handheld's computing capabilities and looked forward to its potential as a gaming platform.\n\nIn the 1990s, Nintendo had dominated the handheld market since launching its Game Boy in 1989, experiencing close competition only from Bandai's WonderSwan (1999â€“2003) in Japan and Sega's Game Gear (1990-2001). In January 1999, Sony had released the briefly successful PocketStation in Japan as its first foray into the handheld gaming market. The SNK Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia's N-Gage also failed to cut into Nintendo's share. According to an IDC analyst in 2004, the PSP was the \"first legitimate competitor to Nintendo's dominance in the handheld market.\"\n\nThe first concept images of the PSP appeared at a Sony corporate strategy meeting in November 2003. They featured a model with flat buttons and no analog joystick. Although some reviewers expressed concern about the lack of an analog stick, these fears were allayed when the PSP was officially unveiled at the Sony press conference during E3 2004. Sony released a list of 99 developer companies that pledged support for the new handheld. Several game demos, such as Konami's Metal Gear Acid and Studio Liverpool's Wipeout Pure, were also shown at the conference.\n\nLaunch[]\n\nOn October 17, 2004, Sony announced that the PSP base model would be launched in Japan on December 12 that year for Â¥19,800 (about US$181 in 2004), while the Value System would launch for Â¥24,800 (about US$226). The launch was a success, with over 200,000 units sold on the first day of sales. Colour variations were sold in bundle packs that cost around $200. On February 3, 2005, Sony announced that the PSP would be released in North America on March 24 in one configuration for an MSRP of US$249/CA$299. Some commentators expressed concern over the high price, which was almost US$20 higher than the Japanese model and over $100 higher than the Nintendo DS. Despite these concerns, the PSP's North American launch was a success. Sony said 500,000 units were sold in the first two days of sales, though it was also reported that this figure was below expectations.\n\nThe PSP was initially intended to have a simultaneous PAL and North American launch. On March 15, 2005, Sony announced that the PAL launch would be delayed due to high demand for the console in Japan and North America. The next month, Sony announced that the PSP would be launched in the PAL region on September 1, 2005, for â‚¬249/Â£179. Sony defended the high price by saying North American consumers paid local sales taxes and that the Value Added Tax (sales tax) was higher in the UK. Despite the high cost, the PSP's PAL launch was a success, with the console selling over 185,000 units in the UK. All stock of the PSP in the UK sold out within three hours of its launch, more than doubling the previous first-day sales record of 87,000 units set by the Nintendo DS. The system also enjoyed great success in other PAL region areas; over 25,000 units were pre-ordered in Australia. Nearly one million units were sold across Europe in the system's first week of sales.\n\nHardware[]\n\nFurther information: PlayStation Portable hardware\n\nThe PlayStation Portable uses the standard \"bar\" form factor. The original model measures approximately 6.7 by 2.9 by 0.9 inches (170 by 74 by 23 mm) and weighs 9.9 ounces (280 g). The console's front is dominated by the system's 4.3-inch (110 mm) LCD screen, which is capable of 480 Ã— 272 pixel display resolution with 24-bit colour, outperforming the Nintendo DS. Also on the unit's front are four PlayStation face buttons ( , , , ); The PlayStation Portable uses the standard \"bar\" form factor. The original model measures approximately 6.7 by 2.9 by 0.9 inches (170 by 74 by 23 mm) and weighs 9.9 ounces (280 g). The console's front is dominated by the system's 4.3-inch (110 mm) LCD screen, which is capable of 480 Ã— 272 pixel display resolution with 24-bit colour, outperforming the Nintendo DS. Also on the unit's front are four PlayStation face buttons (, , , ); the directional pad, the analog \"nub,\" and several other buttons. The system also has two shoulder buttons, a USB 2.0 mini-B port on the top of the console, and a wireless LAN switch and power cable input on the bottom. The PSP back features a read-only Universal Media Disc (UMD) drive for access to movies and games. A reader compatible with Sony's Memory Stick PRO Duo flash cards is located on the system's left. Other features include:\n\nAn IrDA-compatible infrared port\n\nA two-pin docking connector (discontinued for later models)\n\nBuilt-in stereo speakers\n\nHeadphone port\n\nIEEE 802.11b Wi-Fi to access the Internet\n\nFree online multiplayer gaming via PlayStation Network\n\nData transfer.\n\nThe PSP uses two 333 MHz MIPS32 R4000 R4k-based CPUs, a primary CPU and Media Engine, a GPU at 166 MHz, and 32 MB main RAM (64MB on PSP-2000 and later models), and 4 MB embedded DRAM split between the GPU above and Media Engine. The hardware was initially forced to run more slowly than it was capable of; most games ran at 222 MHz. With firmware update 3.50 on May 31, 2007, Sony removed this limit and allowed new games to run at 333 MHz.\n\nThe PSP has an 1800 mAh battery (1200 mAh on the 2000 and 3000 models), providing about three and six hours of gameplay, four and five hours of video, or eight and eleven hours audio.\n\nThe PSP's battery's capacity was reduced from 1800 mAh to 1200 mAh in the PSP-2000 and 3000 models to slim the unit. However, due to more efficient power use, the expected playing time is the same as that of older models. The original high-capacity batteries work on the newer models, giving increased playing time. However, the battery cover does not fit. The batteries take about 1.5 hours to charge and last for between four-and-a-half and seven hours, depending on factors such as screen brightness settings, the use of WLAN, and volume levels. In March 2008, Sony released the Extended Life Battery Kit in Japan, which included a bulkier 2200 mAh battery with a fitting cover. In Japan, the kit was sold with a specific-coloured cover matching the many PSP variations available. The North American equipment released in December 2008 was supplied with two new covers; one black and one silver.\n\nRevisions[]\n\nPSP-2000[]\n\nThe PSP-2000, marketed in PAL countries as the \"PSP Slim,\" is the first redesign of the PlayStation Portable. The PSP-2000 system is slimmer and lighter than the original PSP, reduced from 0.91 to 0.73 inches (23 to 18.6 mm) and from 9.87 to 6.66 ounces (280 to 189 g). At E3 2007, Sony released information about a slimmer and lighter version for the device. It was first released in Hong Kong on August 30, 2007, in Europe on September 5, in North America on September 6, in South Korea on September 7, and in Australia on September 12. The UK release for the PSP 2000 was September 14.\n\nThe serial port was modified to accommodate a new video-out feature, making it incompatible with older PSP remote controls. On the PSP-2000, games only output to external monitors and televisions in progressive scan mode. Non-game video outputs work in either advanced or interlaced way. USB charging was introduced. The D-Pad was raised in response to low-performance complaints, and the buttons' responsiveness was improved.\n\nOther changes include improved WLAN modules and micro-controller and a thinner, brighter LCD screen. The internal memory (RAM and Flash ROM) was doubled from 32 MB to 64 MB to improve UMD games' low loading times on the original model. It now acts as a cache, improving the web browser's performance.\n\nPSP-3000[]\n\nIn comparison with the PSP-2000, the 3000, marketed in PAL areas as \"PSP Slim & Lite\" or \"PSP Brite,\" has an improved LCD screen with an increased colour range, five times the contrast ratio, a halved pixel response time, new sub-pixel structure, and anti-reflective technology to reduce outdoor glare. The disc tray, logos, and buttons were all redesigned, and a microphone was added. Games could now be output in either component or composite video using the video-out cable. Some outlets called this model \"a minor upgrade.\"\n\nThe PSP-3000 was released in North America on October 14, 2008, Japan on October 16, Europe on October 17, and Australia on October 23. In its first four days on sale in Japan, the PSP-3000 sold over 141,270 units, according to Famitsu; it sold 267,000 units during October.\n\nA problem with interlacing when objects were in motion on the PSP-3000 screen was noticed on its release. Sony announced this problem would not be fixed.\n\nPSP Go (N1000)[]\n\nThe PSP Go (model PSP-N1000) was released on October 1, 2009, in North American and European territories, and on November 1 in Japan. It was revealed prior to E3 2009 through Sony's Qore video on demand service. Its design is significantly different from other PSP models.\n\nThe unit is 43% lighter and 56% smaller than the original PSP-1000, and 16% lighter and 35% smaller than the PSP-3000. Its rechargeable battery is not intended to be removed by the user. It has a 3.8-inch (97 mm) 480 Ã— 272 pixel LCD screen, which slides up to reveal the main controls. The overall shape and sliding mechanism are similar to those of Sony's mylo COM-2 internet device.\n\nThe PSP Go features 802.11b Wi-Fi like its predecessors, although the USB port was replaced with a proprietary connector. A compatible cable that connects to other devices' USB ports is included with the unit. The new multi-use connector allows video and sound output with the same connector using an optional composite or component AV cable. As with previous models, Sony also offers a cradle (PSP-N340) for charging, video out, and USB data transfer on the PSP Go. This model adds support for Bluetooth connectivity, which enables the playing of games using a Sixaxis or DualShock 3 controller. The cradle's use with the controller allows players to use the PSP Go as a portable device and as a console, although the output is not upscaled. PlayStation 1 games can be played in full screen using the AV/component cable or the cradle.\n\nThe PSP Go lacks a UMD drive and instead has 16 GB of internal flash memory, which can be extended by up to 32 GB using a Memory Stick Micro (M2). Games must be downloaded from the PlayStation Store. The removal of the UMD drive virtually region locks the unit because it must be linked to a single, region-locked PlayStation Network account. While the PSP Go can download games to itself, users can also download and transfer them to the device from a PlayStation 3 console or the Windows-based software Media Go.\n\nAll downloadable PSP and PlayStation games available for older PSP models are compatible with the PSP Go. Sony confirmed that almost all UMD-based PSP games released after October 1, 2009, would download. Most older UMD-only games would also be downloadable.\n\nIn February 2010, it was reported that Sony might re-launch the PSP Go due to the lack of consumer interest and low sales. In June 2010, Sony began bundling the console with 10 free downloadable games; the same offer was made available in Australia in July. Three free games for the PSP Go were offered in America. In October that year, Sony announced it would reduce the price of the unit. On April 20, 2011, the manufacturer announced that the PSP Go would be discontinued outside of North America to concentrate on the PlayStation Vita.\n\nPSP Street (E1000)[]\n\nThe PSP-E1000, which was announced at Gamescom 2011, is a budget-focused model released across the PAL region on October 26 of that year. The E1000 lacks Wi-Fi and has a matte, charcoal-black finish similar to that of the slim PlayStation 3. It has a mono speaker instead of a stereo one. It lacks a microphone and the physical brightness buttons from the handheld front, instead offering brightness controls in the System Software's 'Power Save Settings' menu.\n\nAn ice-white version was released in PAL territories on July 20, 2012.\n\nBundles and colours[]\n\nThe PSP was sold in four main configurations. The Base Pack, called the Core Pack in North America, contained the console, a battery, and an AC adapter. This version was available at launch in Japan and was released later in North America and Europe.\n\nMany limited editions of the PSP were bundled with accessories, games, or movies. Limited-edition models were first released in Japan on September 12, 2007; North America and Europe on September 5; in Australia on September 12, and in the UK on October 26. The PSP-2000 was in piano black, ceramic white, ice silver, mint green, and Felicia blue. Others include lavender purple, deep red, matte bronze, metallic blue, and rose pink colours.

The limited-edition \"Big Boss Pack\" of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker had a camouflage pattern. At the same time, the God of War: Ghost of Sparta bundle pack included a black-and-red two-toned PSP. The Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy Cosmos & Chaos edition, released on March 3, 2011, has an Amano artwork as the PSP's faceplate.\n\nComparison[]\n\nBelow is a comparison of the different PlayStation Portable models:\n\nModels PSP-1000 PSP-2000 PSP-3000 PSP Go (PSP-N1000) PSP Street (PSP-E1000) Image Original release date December 12, 2004 (Japan) August 30, 2007 (Hong Kong) October 10, 2008 October 2009 November 2011 Discontinued December 2014 December 2014 December 2012 April 20, 2011 December 2014 Display 4.3 in (110 mm) 30:17 TFT at 480 Ã— 272, 16.77 million colours 3.8 in (97 mm) 30:17 TFT at 480 Ã— 272, 16.77 million colours; sliding screen 4.3 in (110 mm) 30:17 TFT at 480 Ã— 272, 16.77 million colours CPU MIPS R4000 at 1~333 MHz RAM 32 MB 64 MB Internal storage 32 MB; reserved for system software 64 MB; reserved for system software 16 GB; shared between user and system software 64 MB; reserved for system software Connectivity USB 2.0, UMD, serial port, headphone jack, Memory Stick PRO Duo USB 2.0, UMD, video out, headphone jack, Memory Stick PRO Duo USB 2.0, UMD, video out, headphone jack, microphone, Memory Stick PRO Duo All-in-one port, headphone jack, microphone, Memory Stick Micro (M2) USB 2.0, UMD, headphone jack, Memory Stick PRO Duo Wireless 802.11b Wi-Fi, IRDA 802.11b Wi-Fi 802.11b Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR N/A Battery 3.6 V DC 1800 mAh removable battery; upgradeable to 2200 mAh 3.6 V DC 1200 mAh removable battery; upgradeable to 2200 mAh 3.6 V DC non removable battery Original system software 1.00 3.60 4.20 5.70 6.50\n\nSoftware[]\n\nSystem software[]\n\nMain article: PlayStation Portable system software\n\nThe PSP runs a custom operating system referred to as the System Software, which can be updated over the Internet, or by loading an update from a Memory Stick or UMD. Sony offers no method for downgrading such software.\n\nWhile System Software updates can be used with consoles from any region, Sony recommends only downloading updates for the model's area. System Software updates have added many features, including a web browser, Adobe Flash support, additional codecs for various media, PlayStation 3 (PS3) connectivity, and patches against security exploits and homebrew execution programs. The most recent version, numbered 6.61, was released on January 15, 2015.\n\nApps and functionality[]\n\nWeb browser[]\n\nSee also: PlayStation Portable system software Â§ Web browser\n\nThe PSP Internet Browser is a version of the NetFront browser and came with the system via an update, supporting the most common web technologies. These include HTTP cookies, forms, CSS, and necessary JavaScript. It features limited tabbed browsing and has a maximum of three tabs.\n\nRemote Play[]\n\nMain article: Remote Play\n\nRemote Play allows the PSP to access many of the PlayStation 3 console features from a remote location using the PS3's WLAN capabilities, a home network, or the Internet. Using Remote Play, users can view photographs, listen to music, and watch videos stored on the PS3 or connected USB devices. Remote Play also allows the PS3 to be turned on and off remotely and lets the PSP control audio playback from the PS3 to a home theatre system. Most PS3 capabilities are accessed with Remote Play. These include DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, PlayStation games, PlayStation 2 games, most PS3 games, and copy-protected files stored on the hard drive are not supported.\n\nVoIP access[]\n\nStarting with System Software version 3.90, the PSP-2000, 3000, and Go can use the Skype VoIP service. Due to hardware constraints, it is not possible to use the service on the PSP-1000. The service allows Skype calls to be made over Wi-Fi and â€“ on the Go â€“ over the Bluetooth modem. Users must purchase Skype credit to make telephone calls.\n\nRoom for PlayStation Portable[]\n\nMain article: Room for PlayStation Portable\n\nAt Tokyo Game Show 2009, Sony announced that a service similar to PlayStation Home, the PS3's online community-based service, was being developed for the PSP. Named \"Room\" (stylized RâˆžM) was being beta-tested in Japan from October 2009 to April 2010. It could be launched directly from the PlayStation Network section of the XMB. As in Home, PSP owners would have invited other PSP owners into their rooms to \"enjoy real time communication.\" Development of Room halted on April 15, 2010, due to feedback from the community.\n\nDigital Comics Reader[]\n\nSony partnered with Rebellion Developments, Disney, IDW Publishing, Insomnia Publications, iVerse, Marvel Comics, and Titan Books to release digitized comics PlayStation Store. The Digital Comics Reader application required PSP firmware 6.20.\n\nThe PlayStation Store's \"Comic\" section premiered in Japan on December 10, 2009, with licensed publishers ASCII Media Works, Enterbrain, Kadokawa, Kodansha, Shueisha, Shogakukan, Square-Enix, Softbank Creative (HQ Comics), Hakusensha, Bandai Visual, Fujimishobo, Futabasha, and Bunkasha. It launched in the United States and in English-speaking PAL countries on December 16, 2009. However, the first issues of Aleister Arcane, Astro Boy: Movie Adaptation, Star Trek: Enterprise Experiment and Transformers: All Hail Megatron were made available as early as November 20 through limited-time PlayStation Network redemption codes. In early 2010 the application was expanded to the German, French, Spanish and Italian languages. Regional Comic Reader software is dictated by the PSP's firmware region. The Japanese Comic Reader will not display comics purchased from the European store, and vice versa. Sony shut down the Digital Comics service in September 2012.\n\nHomebrew development and custom firmware[]\n\nMain article: PlayStation Portable homebrew\n\nOn June 15, 2005, hackers disassembled the code of the PSP and distributed it online. Initially, the modified PSP allowed users to run custom code and a limited amount of protected software, including custom-made PSP applications such as a calculator or file manager. Sony responded to this by repeatedly upgrading the software. Some users could unlock the firmware to allow them to run more custom content and DRM-restricted software. Hackers were able to run the protected software on the PSP through the ISO loaders loading copies of UMD games from a memory stick. Custom firmware, including the M33 Custom Firmware, Minimum Edition (ME/LME) CFWm, and PRO CFWl, were commonly seen in PSP systems.\n\nAlso, an unsigned program was made for the PSP, which allowed the handheld to downgrade its firmware to previous versions.\n\nGames[]\n\nSee also: List of PlayStation Portable games, List of downloadable PlayStation Portable games, List of best-selling PSP video games, and List of cancelled PlayStation Portable video games\n\nThere were 1,370 games released for the PSP during its 10-year lifespan. Launch games for PSP included; Ape Escape: On the Loose (North America, Europe, Japan), Darkstalkers Chronicle: The Chaos Tower (North America, Europe, Japan), Dynasty Warriors (all regions), Lumines (North America, Europe, Japan), Metal Gear Acid (North America, Europe, Japan), Need for Speed: Underground Rivals (North America, Europe, Japan), NFL Street 2: Unleashed (North America, Europe), Ridge Racer (North America, Europe, Japan), Spider-Man 2 (North America, Europe, Japan), Tiger Woods PGA Tour (North America, Europe, Japan), Tony Hawk's Underground 2 Remix (North America, Europe), Twisted Metal: Head-On (North America, Europe), Untold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade (North America, Europe, Japan), Wipeout Pure (all regions), and World Tour Soccer: Challenge Edition (North America, Europe). Additionally, Gretzky NHL and NBA were North America exclusive launch titles. The best selling PSP game is Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, which sold 7.6 million copies as of October 2015.\n\nOther top-selling PSP games include Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, Gran Turismo, and Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. Retro City Rampage DX, which was released in July 2016, was the final PSP game that was released. The best-rated PSP games on Metacritic are God of War: Ghost of Sparta, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, and Daxter, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the only PSP game to receive a perfect score from FamitsÅ«. During E3 2006, Sony Computer Entertainment America announced that the Greatest Hits range of budget titles was extended to the PSP system. On July 25, 2006, Sony Computer Entertainment America released the first batch of Greatest Hits titles. These titles included Ape Escape: On the Loose, ATV Offroad Fury: Blazin' Trails, Hot Shots: Open Tee, Twisted Metal: Head-On, and Wipeout Pure. The PSP Greatest Hits lineup consists of games that have sold 250,000 copies or more and have been released for nine months. PSP games in this lineup retail for $19.99 each. Downloadable games were limited to 1.8 GB, most likely to guarantee a potential UMD release. A section of the PlayStation Store is dedicated to \"Minis\"; smaller, cheaper games available as a download only.\n\nDemos and emulation[]\n\nIn late 2004, Sony released a series of PSP demo games, including Duck In Water, world/ball, Harmonic City, and Luga City. Demos for commercial PSP games could be downloaded and booted directly from a Memory Stick. Demos were sometimes issued in UMD format and mailed out or given to customers at retail outlets. Also, several older PlayStation games were re-released; these can be played on the PSP using emulation. As of 2008, this feature could be officially accessed through the PlayStation Network service for PlayStation 3, PSP, PlayStation Vita (or PlayStation TV), or a personal computer. The PSP emulation is well-developed; one of the first emulators was JPCSP, which ran on Java. PPSSPP is currently the fastest and most compatible PSP emulator; it supports all major games.\n\nPeripherals[]\n\nThe console's official accessories include an AC adapter, car adapter, headset, headphones with remote control, extended-life 2200 mAh battery, battery charger, carrying case, accessories pouch, and cleaning cloth and system pouch and wrist strap. A 1seg television tuner peripheral (model PSP-S310), designed specifically for the PSP-2000, was released in Japan on September 20, 2007.\n\nSony sold a GPS accessory for the PSP-2000; this was released first in Japan and announced for the United States in 2008. It features maps on a UMD and offers driving directions and city guides.\n\nAfter the discontinuation of PSP, the Chinese electronics company Lenkeng released a PSP-to-HDMI converter called the LKV-8000. The device is compatible with the PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP Go. To overcome PSP games' problem being displayed in a small window surrounded by a black border, the LKV-8000 has a zoom button on the connector. A few other Chinese companies have released clones of this up-scaler under different names, like the Pyle PSPHD42. The LKV-8000 and its variants have become popular among players and reviewers as the only means of playing and recording PSP gameplay on a large screen.\n\nReception[]\n\nThe PSP generally received favourable reviews soon after launch; most reviewers noted similar strengths and weaknesses. CNET awarded the system 8.5 out of 10 and praised the console's powerful hardware and its multimedia capabilities but lamented the lack of a guard to cover the screen and the reading surface of UMD cartridges. Engadget praised the console's design, stating that \"it is definitely one well-designed, slick little handheld.\" PC World commended Sony's decision to built-in Wi-Fi capability. Still, it criticized the lack of a web browser at launch and the glare and smudges that resulted from the console's shiny exterior. Most reviewers also praised the console's large, bright viewing screen and its audio and video playback capabilities. In 2008, Time listed the PSP as a \"gotta have travel gadget,\" citing the console's movie selection, telecommunications capability, and upcoming GPS functionality.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable was initially seen as superior to the Nintendo DS when both devices were revealed in early 2004 because of the designers' emphasis on the system's technical accomplishments. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime, however, focused on the experience aspect of the Nintendo DS. The DS started to become more popular than the PSP early on because it attracted more third-party developers. The DS sold more units partly because of its touchscreen, second display, and wireless elements.\n\nFrom a multimedia perspective, the PSP has also been seen as a competitor to portable media players, notably the iPod Video released in the same year.\n\nReviews of the PSP Go were mixed. It was criticized for its initial pricing. Ars Technica called it \"way too expensive,\" and The Guardian stated that cost was the \"biggest issue\" facing the machine. Engadget said the Go cost only $50 less than the PS3, which has a Blu-ray player. Wired said the older PSP-3000 model was cheaper and supported UMDs, and IGN stated that the price increase made the PSP Go a \"hard sell.\" The placement of the analog stick next to the D-pad was also criticized. Reviewers also commented on the change from a mini-USB port to a proprietary port, making hardware and cables bought for previous models incompatible. The Go's screen was positively received by Ars Technica, which called the screen's image \"brilliant, sharp and clear,\" and T3 stated that \"pictures and videos look great.\" The controls received mixed reviews; The Times described them as \"instantly familiar\" whereas CNET and Stuff called the position of the analog stick \"awkward.\" The device's capability to use a PS3 controller was praised by The New Zealand Herald. Still, Ars Technica criticized the need to connect the controller and the Go to a PS3 for initial setup.\n\nSales[]\n\nRegion Units sold First available Japan 19 million (as of April 28, 2013) December 12, 2004 United States 17 million (as of March 14, 2010) March 24, 2005 Europe 12 million (as of May 6, 2008) September 1, 2005 United Kingdom 3.2 million (as of January 3, 2009) September 1, 2005 Worldwide 76.3 million (as of March 31, 2012)\n\nBy March 31, 2007, the PlayStation Portable had shipped 25.39 million units worldwide, with 6.92 million in Asia, 9.58 million in North America, and 8.89 million in Europe. In Europe, the PSP sold 4 million units in 2006 and 3.1 million in 2007, according to estimates by Electronic Arts. In 2007, the PSP sold 3.82 million units in the US, according to the NPD Group. It also sold 3,022,659 in Japan, according to Enterbrain. In 2008, the PSP sold 3,543,171 units in Japan, according to Enterbrain.\n\nIn the United States, the PSP had sold 10.47 million units by January 1, 2008, according to the NPD Group. In Japan, on March 24â€“30, 2008, the PSP nearly outsold all of the other game consoles combined, selling 129,986 units. According to Media Create, some of which were bundled with Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G was the bestselling game in that week. As of December 28, 2008, the PSP had sold 11,078,484 units in Japan, according to Enterbrain. In Europe, the PSP had sold 12 million units as of May 6, 2008, according to SCE Europe. In the United Kingdom, the PSP had sold 3.2 million units as of January 3, 2009, according to GfK Chart-Track.\n\nFrom 2006 to the third quarter of 2010, the PSP sold 53 million units. In a 2009 interview, Peter Dillon, Sony's senior vice-president of marketing, said piracy of video games led to lower sales than hoped. Despite being aimed at a different audience, the PSP competed directly with the Nintendo DS. During the last few years of its life cycle, sales of the PSP models started to decrease. Shipments to North America ended in January 2014, later in Europe. On June 3, 2014, Sony announced sales of the device in Japan would end. Production of the device and sales to the rest of Asia would continue. During its lifetime, the PSP sold 80 million fewer units than the Nintendo DS.\n\nMarketing controversies[]\n\nIn late 2005, Sony hired graffiti artists to spray-paint advertisements for the PSP in seven major U.S. cities, including New York City, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. They paid businesses and building owners for the right to spray-paint their walls. A year later, Sony ran a poster campaign in England. A poster bearing the slogan \"Take a running jump here\" was removed from a Manchester Piccadilly station tram platform due to concerns it might encourage suicide.\n\nLater in 2006, news of a billboard advertisement released in the Netherlands depicting a white woman holding a black woman by the jaw, saying \"PlayStation Portable White is coming,\" spread. Two similar advertisements existed; one showed the two women facing each other on equal footing in fighting stances. The other showed the black woman in a dominant position on top of the white woman. Sony's stated purpose was to contrast the white and black versions of the PSP. Still, the advertisements were interpreted as being racially charged. These advertisements never made it to the rest of the world. They were withdrawn from the Netherlands after the controversy. The ad attracted international press coverage; Engadget said Sony may have hoped to \"capitalize on a PR firestorm.\"\n\nSony came under scrutiny online in December 2006 for a guerrilla marketing campaign in which advertisers posed as young bloggers who desperately wanted a PSP. The site was created by advertising firm Zipatoni.\n\nSee also[]\n\nSony Ericsson Xperia Play"
