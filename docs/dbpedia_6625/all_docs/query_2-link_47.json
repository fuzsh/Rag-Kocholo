        "text": "RolStoppable said:\n\nThe major draw of such a console would be high-end PS5 games, because virtually all other third party games would already be available on Switch. This raises a multitude of issues:\n\n1. Price of the console: The barebones SteamDeck goes for $399 while the handheld-only Switch Lite costs $199. If the SteamDeck is the measuring stick for comparisons here, Sony would be re-entering the handheld space at at least twice the price of Nintendo's machine.\n\n2. Battery life: The games that sell the console would get ~2 hours of playtime per charge and that seems generous.\n\n3. Game sizes: Third parties have not optimized the storage sizes on PS consoles and they aren't going to do that for this hypothetical PS5 handheld either. With individual game sizes coming in between 30 to 100 GB, the purchase of additional storage becomes mandatory, increasing the price of the system further.\n\n4. The games themselves: We are talking about games that are tailor-made to be played on big screens, similar to how certain kinds of movies are much more enjoyable to be experienced in cinema and lose much of their luster when watched on a common TV set. It diminishes the selling power of these games and that's a point that is commonly overlooked. Switch has a monopoly over the portable console market, but this has not resulted in high sales for the AAA third party PS4 games that got ported over. Conversely, less demanding games that had previously been PS-exclusive have been able to achieve comparable sales to their PS counterparts. So while PS gamers who are not about the AAA experiences have bought Switch consoles, there are no serious indicators that there's high demand for AAA games to be played on a small screen.\n\n5. Probably no physical media: I doubt that Sony would go for having PS5 games on disc (home console) and cards (handheld) alike, so this would most likely be a digital-only device.\n\nI'd like Sony to go for it, because I'd like to see the failure unfold, but I don't think even Jim Ryan is that stupid. Point 4 of this post is the central problem, it's basically the question if there's even a sizeable market for a handheld that plays the big PS games. And while there would be cost savings in terms of game development in comparison to the old way of the PSP and PSV, there still remain significant costs for R&D of the device, its marketing and potentially loss-leading on hardware sales to prevent the handheld from being dead on arrival.\n\nIs a PS handheld going to lead to enough additional software sales and PS+ subscriptions to make the whole endeavor worth it? That's for Sony to decide. But if a major consideration is to get in the way of Nintendo and/or appease Japanese third parties, then it would be a much safer investment to moneyhat third party content for the PS5 home console as is instead of going to the lengths of launching a competing device."
