I'm going to go out and hit a few to pick up some RPG's. I just wish PSP had more turn based and less strategy. If anyone finds a place with decently priced copies of Salamander and Parodius Portable shoot me a message.\n\nnoiseredux said on 1/2/12 5:05 PM\n\nGreat blog post dsh! (And not just because you plugged an article I wrote). I feel the same way about collecting for PSP. Strike while the iron's hot you guys -- the PSP is only going to continue building momentum as a cult-system and I predict prices to rise for CIB games in the future.\n\ndsheinem said on 1/2/12 5:29 PM\n\n@noiseredux:I actually plugged two of your posts It is a bit unsettling how many PSP games at Gamestop and on eBay are UMD only.\n\nnoiseredux said on 1/2/12 6:07 PM\n\nActually what kills me is how many of that are box, but NO MANUAL. ARGH I hate that.\n\nCrabmaster2000 said on 1/3/12 4:30 AM\n\nI've been patiently waiting for a time such as this to even pick up a PSP. Looks like its time!\n\nslackur said on 1/3/12 9:46 AM\n\nGlad you pointed this out, and I agreed completely; I've told my local gaming buddies that this is the year to grab anything PSP, 'cause some of that stuff has always been a little tough to find, and this is likely the cheapest and easiest to find it will get.I took advantage of this last holiday's sale prices and filled many holes in the PSP library for dirt cheap. Still many excellent RPG and niche games left to track down, though. I think this system's odd library will only endear itself to collectors more and more over time.Which is a strange turnaround for me, since I think I may have played my Neo Geo Pocket Color more than my PSP. I've always respected its library more than I actually enjoy playing games on the thing. Just never got comfortable with the way it feels, including the analog nub or the positioning of the controls. Personal preference, I admit. Oddly I'm more comfortable with the admittedly less form-fitting DS series.\n\nblcklblskt said on 1/3/12 1:15 PM\n\nI have picked up quite a few PSP games for dirt cheap this year. Looks like I need to head to GameStop and take another look.\n\ndsheinem said on 1/3/12 1:48 PM\n\n@Crabmaster2000: the price point on the hardware has remarkably stayed around the same for some time now, but the games have really dropped. it might make sense to get games now and a system after the Vit launch.@slackur: and @blcklblskt: what games have y'all picked up for \"dirt cheap\"?\n\nslackur said on 1/3/12 3:19 PM\n\nFF IV Complete, 3rd Birthday, Tactics Ogre, Valkyria Chronicles II, Darkstalkers, Jikandia, Mana Khemia, Micro Machines V4, PowerStone Collection, and Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins. Each were between 4 to 9 bucks, many under buy 2 get 1. I made sure each were complete, some even new. Mostly GameStop and BestBuy sales.\n\nSilent Scythe said on 1/3/12 7:37 PM\n\nThanks for the informative post, managed to pick up a few games I've been wanting for a while. Hopefully another local Gamestop will have FF IV Complete in stock.\n\nbombatomba said on 1/7/12 1:19 PM\n\nLike many of you, I plan on plowing into and through the PSP death-wake with a nice, full wallet (though many will argue this has been happening for years now). However, I don't think we'll see any significant price drops on software (or hardware) for quite a long while. Why? Despite what I think Sony wants, the Vita will not be seen as a clear successor for the PSP (much like the GBA was for the GB, or the DS was for the GBA). To this day I still see tons of kids playing their PSPs in my area at doctors offices, barber shops, and waiting in line at the movie theaters."
