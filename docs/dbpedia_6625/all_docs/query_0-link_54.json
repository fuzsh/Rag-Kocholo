        "text": "EXIT DS\n\nExit is a 2005 action/puzzle video game that was developed and published by Taito for the PlayStation Portable. It was first released in Japan, on December 15, 2005, in North America on February 14, 2006, in Australia on March 30, 2006, and in Europe on March 31, 2006. A version for Xbox Live Arcade was released on October 24, 2007. A version for the Nintendo DS was released in Japan in January 2008.\n\nThe basic premise is to lead the main character Mr. ESC, an escapologist, out of hospitals, underground facilities, offices and other buildings within a time limit. Along the way, the player will be hindered by obstacles such as fires, earthquakes, floods, or even meteor showers.\n\nSometimes the player must help trapped individuals escape as well, and it will take quick thinking and planning ahead to exit the building successfully.\n\nENDAST KASSETT\n\nKommentarer"
