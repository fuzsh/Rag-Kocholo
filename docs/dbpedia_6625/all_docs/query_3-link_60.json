        "text": "When it comes to underrated consoles, the PlayStation Portable is near the top of the list. Released in 2005 in North America, the PSP was light-years ahead of the Game Boy in terms of sheer graphics capabilities. With enough power to rival the PS2, the PSP was supposed to herald a new age of hand-held gaming, and while it may have been pretty popular in Japan, North American sales were anything but enthusiastic (although piracy may have played a large role in that). Still, there were some amazing games released during the PSP's 10-year run (especially RPGs), as well as plenty of hidden gems. Forget all the best and most popular games â€” this list is ranking all the best underrated PSP games you've probably never heard of.\n\nThe PSP came out at a strange time in video game history. During the early 2000s, portable gaming consoles were slowly falling out of favor. Instead, people were starting to turn to their smartphones for on-the-go gaming. Although the PSP did reach a decent level of popularity for a few years, its audience fizzled out a lot quicker than previous portable consoles. As a result, many games that were developed for the PSP never really got their chance to shine.\n\nSo dust off that old PSP of yours and check out some of these awesome forgotten titles. As always, vote up all the games you think deserve more recognition, and add any you think should be included in this list."
