        "text": "Sharing is caring!\n\nBack in 2015, I spent a month or so researching the history of watches that play video games. The research led to a fascinating piece I called “Time Killers,” which ran on Polygon. Unfortunately, my research also sparked a bit of an obsession for me in handheld gaming systems.\n\nIt turns out there’s a bit of shared history for both handheld games and game watches that can be traced back to, of all things, calculators.\n\nBack in 1976, Mattel created one of the first handheld game and launched both its own line of Mattel Electronics games and handheld games with the release of Auto Race.\n\nAuto Race, or so the story goes, was the concept of product development engineer George J. Klose who was messing around with other uses for standard calculator hardware. The Auto Race was manufactured by Microelectronics Division of Rockwell International and was so successful that it led to the creation of a slew of other titles, including the much more famous Mattel Football.\n\nMattel Football was released in 1977, and a year later, the much less successful gaming watch phenomenon bumped and wheezed to life, eventually giving birth to something much broader in nature: The smartwatch and hybrid watch.\n\nHandheld game consoles soon exploded in popularity, expanding in shape and form and — most importantly — shaping the face of home consoles as well.\n\nAs I started to read up on the history of these systems, I realized that I had quite a few of my own, and that led me to start collecting those I was missing and building out a display case of my collection.\n\nI’ve annotated the picture of my collection below to offer some details of each system I currently own. Below that, you’ll find a list of what I’m still saving to collect.\n\n1975 Quiz Kid\n\n1976 Unisonic Casino 7 calculator\n\n1976 Mattel Auto Race\n\n1976 Texas Instruments Little Professor\n\n1977 Unisonic Jimmy the Greek 21 Pocket Blackjack Computer\n\n1977 Mattel Football\n\n1977 Invitica Electronic Mastermind\n\n1979 Tiger Rocket Pinball\n\n1979 Milton Bradley Microvision\n\n1980 Mattel Computer Chess\n\n1981 Sharp WN-100 Wondertopia\n\n1983 Casio Game & Radio Shuttle Bomber\n\n199x Queentex QGH-78 (Game Kid)\n\n1981 Mattel Dungeons & Dragons Computer Fantasy Game\n\n1990 Game Plus\n\n1991 Bit Corp.

Altair DBGB-061\n\n1990 Hartung Game Master\n\n1996 Koei PasoGo\n\n1996 Philips In2It\n\n2005 MoMA Eve\n\n2009 Planet Interactive MI2\n\n2011 Jungle\n\n2012 Blaze Entertainment GameGadget\n\n2021 Smach Z\n\nIt’s worth noting that a lot of the systems that hit in the late 1970s and early 1980s were single-game handhelds. That means there’s a lot to collect if, for instance, I wanted to gather all of the Game & Watch, the Bandai games, or even the relatively small assortment of Mattel handhelds. I decided it’s best to collect a single iconic handheld from each, with an eye toward collecting the first from each eventually. Ball, I’ve got my eye on you! There are, of course, quite a few variations, which I’ve largely ignored for my collection.\n\nI’ll work on updating this list as my collection grows."
