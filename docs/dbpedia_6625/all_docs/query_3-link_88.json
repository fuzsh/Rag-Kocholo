        "text": "Sony PlayStation Portable\n\nThe PlayStation Portable is Sony's first major push into the handheld gaming market which was previously dominated by the Nintendo Game Boy franchise. The Sony PSP is a complete handheld entertainment system that can play games, music, and movies. The PSP features built-in stereo speakers, a high-resolution, 4.3-inch TFT display, and can produce close to PlayStation 2-level graphics. The unit also has built-in Wi-Fi networking capability, and it supports the Sony Memory Stick Duo as well as a new Universal Media Disc (UMD) media format.\n\nSony released the PSP in Japan in December of 2004, and immediately sold 200,000 units on the first day of release. The PSP is set to hit North America on March 24, 2005. The PSP will initially only be available in a $249 \"Value Pack,\" which will include the PSP unit, a 32MB Memory Stick Duo, headphones with remote control, lithium-ion battery pack, AC adapter, soft case and cleaning cloth, and a UMD demo disc that contains sample movies, music, and video game footage.\n\nThe first million PSP Value Packs will include a special UMD featuring the Spider-Man 2 major motion picture. Sony will manufacture 1 million units for sale in the North American market through March 31, so all Value Packs purchased during the first week of release should have the Spider-Man 2 UMD.\n\nSony offers a PSP \"Standard Pack\" in Japan that includes no accessories outside of the power cable and carries a lower price, but Sony has not yet announced if or when the bare-bones pack will be available in the States.\n\nThe system itself weighs just over half a pound, but there isn't one square inch of fat on the machine--all of the weight is packed into a dense little package. The screen itself is a sight to behold. The 480x272 resolution may not look impressive on paper, but that's before you realize that all those pixels are stuffed into a bright, 4.3-inch widescreen display. The Nintendo DS may have dual screens, but they're only 256x192 pixels each. If you actually multiply out the pixel total, the PSP's 480x272 resolution screen has 130,560 total pixels while the Nintendo DS has 98,304 pixels, when you add up the number of pixels on both DS screens. That basically means the PSP display will look extremely sharp while the DS displays will appear grainy, but still touchable in comparison.\n\nWhen it comes to controls, the Sony PSP comes with the standard input options instantly recognizable to anyone who is familiar with the PlayStation and the PlayStation 2 console systems. The unit has the standard directional pad on the left-hand side of the unit, and the right-hand side has the usual triangle, circle, cross, and square buttons. The top of the unit has left- and right-shoulder buttons and the start, select, and home buttons are located just below the LCD screen. The PSP also has a small analog stick, more of an analog stub actually, right next to the D pad. The analog stub functions almost like a Dual Shock 2 analog stick, but the lack of a shaft means the stub doesn't rise very far above the PSP face.\n\nEarly reports have stated that users have returned about 4,800 Japanese PSP units (out of 800,000) to Sony due to problems with the square button. The internal contact point for the square input doesn't sit directly below the button itself, as the other three buttons do. Sony made the conscious decision to design the contact point slightly off center, since having a centered contact would have forced Sony to either shrink the screen or to make the device slightly larger. Most of our editors haven't had a problem with the button on the PSPs we have in the office, but one editor did notice that the square button can lag occasionally in a handful of games that require precise button inputs.\n\nUniversal Media Disc and Parental Control\n\nThe PSP accepts the Memory Stick Duo and UMD media formats. Users will be able to play music and movie files from the memory stick, but retail games and movies will be sold in UMD form. Sony has indicated that it might be possible for users to download games in the future, but that functionality doesn't exist yet. The UMD is a 60mm optical disc that can hold up to 1.8GB of data. This isn't quite the size of a single-layer 4.7GB DVD, but 1.8GB is still plenty, considering that it's more than twice the size of a normal CD-ROM. Sony has started the process of opening the UMD format to allow third-party content producers to release music and movies in the UMD format.\n\nHardware manufacturers will also be able to use their own UMD-based media players, but Sony will still keep its bread- and-butter UMD game format proprietary. Opening the standard means we'll see more content coming out in UMD format, and this will help Sony, because a large media library will make the PSP more attractive to consumers.\n\nThe PSP has security settings that let you set the \"parental control level,\" which can prevent the system from playing any UMD media rated above a user-determined threshold. For example, a parent can set the PSP parental control level to \"5\" to only allow the system to play UMD-rated \"Teen\" or below. We imagine that most young PSP owners will neglect sharing the existence of said feature with their parents.\n\nMemory Stick Duo\n\nThe Sony Memory Stick is one of the removable flash memory formats used in consumer electronics, such as digital cameras, MP3 players, and PDAs. Other popular removable flash memory formats include CompactFlash and Secure Digital. The PSP supports the advanced Memory Stick Duo, which includes the Memory Stick Duo, MagicGate Memory Stick Duo, and the Memory Stick Pro Duo formats. Unfortunately, the PSP is only compatible with the smaller \"Duo\" format. Regular, normal-sized memory sticks won't be able to fit into the PSP memory slot. Sony manufacturers its own Sony-branded Memory Stick Duo cards, but you can find less expensive cards from other manufacturers, such as SanDisk and Lexar.\n\nYou can transfer files onto the memory stick by either connecting the PSP to a PC using a USB cable, or by using a PC with a memory stick reader or built-in drive. The PSP has a built-in image viewer and it can play MP3 and ATRAC files directly from the memory stick without a problem. However, the PSP can only play MPEG-4 video files encoded for the Memory Stick format. We were able to get movies onto our memory stick by using a free software encoder and doing some fancy file renaming, but we advise users to wait for Sony to release its media software since it'll have easier drag-and-drop functionality designed to work specifically with the PSP. Sony's Image Converter 2 software package, currently available in Japan, can encode movies and images into file formats compatible with the PSP.\n\nNetworking\n\nThe Sony PSP has built-in 802.11b Wi-Fi support that allows up to 16 PSPs to connect to each other over an ad hoc wireless network. The PSP also supports an \"infrastructure\" mode that will allow the PSP to connect to the Internet through a wireless access point, such as a wireless router at home or a public Internet hot spot, but Sony hasn't implemented the infrastructure mode yet. Users can currently only play each other over local, ad hoc wireless connections.\n\nOnce Sony enables the infrastructure mode, it's virtually guaranteed that PSP owners will be able to play against each other over the Internet. Even though up to 16 PSP systems can see each other on a single local network, most PSP games won't offer full 16-player multiplayer support. Expect most multiplayer game modes to support between two, four, or eight players. It's likely that we'll see modes that support a larger number of simultaneous players once Internet support is enabled, since it'll be easier to get a large numbers of players together online. However, until that time comes, every PSP unit has a wireless LAN switch that allows the user to toggle the Wi-Fi networking on or off to save power.\n\nUPDATE: Sony Computer Entertainment America has just confirmed that five of its upcoming PSP titles will feature multiplayer online support. The announcement indicates that the PSP will likely have online support when it launches in the US.\n\nPower Consumption\n\nAs with any portable gaming device, power consumption plays a major role in hardware and software design. The PSP comes with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack. It snaps into the back of the unit and is easily replaceable. Battery life averages between two and a half to eight hours or more depending on the application. A game such as Ridge Racers with its graphics, physics, and heavy UMD access will run closer to the three-hour mark compared to a puzzle game like Lumines.\n\nGame developers have designed games with power consumption in mind, since you can no longer get away with constantly streaming data from the media disc as with the PlayStation 2. Sony gives an ambiguous 1-333MHz CPU speed in all official specification lists, because the system throttles down the CPU speed to conserve power. Software developers tell us that 222MHz is the current magic number for the CPU.\n\nAlso expect a faster power drain if you play games over Wi-Fi. While playing MP3 music files, you always have the option to turn off the PSP backlight to conserve battery power. You can \"hot swap\" battery packs while the unit is on, but the system needs to be plugged into a wall adapter to keep any games running in the middle of the swapping process. It takes about two hours to fully recharge the battery pack.\n\nAccessories and Games\n\nSony Computer Entertainment CEO Ken Kutaragi has confirmed rumors that Sony is working on a device that will turn the PSP into a mobile phone. In early 2005, Sony inadvertently released a \"dummy\" PSP patch update that revealed the names of some promising new features, including e-mail, Web browsing, and Sonic Stage music-management software support that would greatly increase the usability of the PSP. Sony has not confirmed that any of the features are in the works, but the fact that they are listed in the patch indicates that the company is at least considering developing the additions.\n\nThird-party manufacturers such as Nyko, Madcatz, and Intec have all announced Sony PSP peripherals, and we're sure many other manufacturers are gearing up to jump on the PSP gravy train. As with the Nintendo DS launch, the Sony PSP accessories list will be limited to the basic carry case, media holder, and screen protector paraphernalia, but Nyko has a couple unique accessories including a PSP Charger Case and the Theater Experience PSP. You'll also want to get a 512MB or 1GB Memory Stick Duo flash memory card to get music, movies, and images onto your PSP.\n\nThe Sony PSP will have 24 launch titles ready for the North American \"launch window.\" Sony hasn't yet specified the size of the window, but with 24 titles, it'll be safe to assume that you'll have several games to choose from on launch day. Game titles will range in price from $39.99 to $49.99.\n\nPSP Launch Titles\n\nApe Escape: On the Loose, Sony Computer Entertainment America\n\nATV Offroad Fury: Blazin' Trails, SCEA\n\nDarkstalkers Chronicle: The Chaos Tower, Capcom\n\nDynasty Warriors, Koei\n\nFIFA 2005, Electronic Arts\n\nGretzky NHL, SCEA\n\nLumines, Ubisoft\n\nMetal Gear Acid, Konami\n\nMLB, SCEA\n\nMVP Baseball, EA\n\nNBA, SCEA\n\nNBA Street Showdown, EA\n\nNeed for Speed Rivals, EA\n\nNFL Street 2 Unleashed, EA\n\nRengoku: Tower of Purgatory, Konami\n\nRidge Racer, Namco\n\nSmartbomb, Eidos Interactive\n\nSpider-Man 2, Activision\n\nTiger Woods PGA Tour, EA\n\nTony Hawk's Underground 2 Remix, Activision\n\nTwisted Metal: Head-On, SCEA\n\nUntold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade, Sony Online Entertainment\n\nWipeout Pure, SCEA\n\nWorld Tour Soccer, SCEA"
