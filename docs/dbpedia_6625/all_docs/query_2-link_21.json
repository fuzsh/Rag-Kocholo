        "text": "Full credit to Iroshino for sharing this\n\nRussian journalist Anton Logvinov, who was the first or one of the first to say earlier that Sony would release its games on PC, said today that Sony is preparing a new PSP for release and PS4 games will be available on it.\n\nHe talks about PS4 games that are already available on Steamdeck\n\nАнтон Логвинов. Мем. Ванга. Легенда\n\nКстати, могу подтвердить, что Sony готовит к релизу новую PSP, но бля - там в стартовой линейке только PS4 игры, которые в общем-то доступны на ПК, а значит и на SteamDeck. Торговые сети, кстати, довольно скептичеки настроены. Либо Sony что-то совсем, либо пока хранят секреты от партнеров.\n\nTranslation done by DieH@rd\n\nКстати, могу подтвердить, что Sony готовит к релизу новую PSP, но бля - там в стартовой линейке только PS4 игры, которые в общем-то доступны на ПК, а значит и на SteamDeck. Торговые сети, кстати, довольно скептичеки настроены. Либо Sony что-то совсем, либо пока хранят секреты от партнеров. \"\n\nGoogle Translate:\n\n\"By the way, I can confirm that Sony is preparing a new PSP for release, but damn - there are only PS4 games in the launch lineup, which are generally available on PC, and therefore on SteamDeck. Retail chains, by the way, are quite sceptical. Either Sony is doing something completely, or they are still keeping secrets from their partners.\"\n\nWhile a PS4 handheld would be cool it would have the problem that by the time it comes out there likely won`t be many new big or talked about games releasing on it anymore which could make it \"less\" exciting for people, because of the lack of \"new\" releases. How would you market this console after launch without new titles and make sure it keeps selling? You would also have people that have a PS5 and wouldn`t be able to play their current gen only titles on such a handheld. The only way to do it would be to also offer PS5 game streaming on it as a feature, but the question is how expensive such a device would be.\n\nThe next Nintendo console would also be out by that time which likely would have better hardware and tons of new releases coming. A Xbox Series S handheld would also be much more interesting, because it could play current gen games that will continue to come out for many years to come even by the time the next console generation is out.\n\nA PC gaming handheld would also not make much sense for Sony, because they don`t have their own store and less than 20 games available on PC plus the PS Plus Premium app on PC is very bad and you can`t even stream PS5 games on it.\n\nIf it played _all_ PS4 games and, for example, offered access to PS cloud streaming (and the PS5 games there), that might at least offer an interesting template for next gen. Where maybe you have an eventual handheld that can play _all_ PS5 games, and streaming of PS6 games.\n\nAs with the idea of a Series S level handheld from Xbox. A PS4 level handheld, if it's coming pretty soon - like alongside the Pro perhaps - could be a baby-step test for the market's appetite for these kinds of things. Sort of like the next step after Portal.\n\nI'm up for a new Sony handheld for sure, however if it is just limited to \"PS4 games\", that doesn't sound super appealing, again when we have handheld PCs that can do it all, though I guess there's some PS4 games that aren't on PC. I'm guessing/hoping it more means it's powered similar to PS4, hopefully could still run stuff on PS5 at a lower res/fps, etc and it's not actually a PSP either ha.\n\nFantastic news!\n\nIf it retains access to all the PS Classics I bought on Vita, I'll be absurdly happy. That little machine was a portable PS1 for me, and I adored it. But good to know it would be capable of running games like GT7 too.\n\nMy favourite PlayStation handheld remains the PSPGo though. I was so ready for all digital, and again, used it almost exclusively for PS1 Classics so wasn't affected by Sony's very silly decision to have some key PSP releases not be available digitally alongside a digital only handheld (Crisis Core was probably the big one there). I just loved the form factor, and it's the console that finally sold me on Monster Hunter with Freedom Unite (on a single analog stick!!!)\n\nThis random journalist was the first, if I remember correctly, who said that Sony would port its games to the PC. Many did not believe him then. But it turned out that he was telling the truth.\n\nPointing out one fairly obvious possible thing is not exactly a track record. There were posters on era probably 5 or 6 years ago saying the same thing - it doesn't mean they have an inside scoop just they correctly saw where things were headed.\n\nLike if I say today that Nintendo games are heading to PC in the future wink wink and then in 5 years they do that doesn't make me an insider\n\nBe still my beating heart. I literally just made this post a minute ago in another thread about vBulletin forum nostalgia:\n\n\"I was on the PSP forum 6 months before the PSP actually released in Europe and had learned everything about the device and the hacking scene in detail ahead of time. I was an absolute savant, so when the PSP released I already knew all the ins and outs and intricacies of the device.\n\nI have never felt about a piece of OEM hardware as I did about the PSP, Vita and Steam Deck came close, but the PSP was something else, before smartphones were a thing it was the closest thing to modern smartphones, a device way ahead of its time.\"\n\nThe idea of this is cool, as much as i'd love another proper sony handheld, but it feels weird because at some point devs will transition over to ps5 only releases, which we're seeing a lot more of now, and so if/when this eventually comes years down the line there will just be \"no games\" releasing for this thing - especially first party and major third party wise so it'd be repeating some of the Vita's history.\n\nI guess the alternative way of looking at it could be \"we now have a minimum spec that would support 3 different platforms\" with only 1 release - and assuming Switch 2 is within the PS4 spec ballpark (pre-DLSS or whatever) then that might help for securing JP releases since Vita did fairly well in Japan (and games actually sold on it :P)\n\nWell, its technically very hard to make a handheld that can Run PS4 binaries. From the part I quoted it implies that it will run the PS4 games already ported to PC, which is much easier. I guess it could run a custom linux distro.\n\nthe translation isn't really correct. He didn't say it will only play games ported to pc. He says its launch lineup will be just ps4 games so it won't have any exclusives over steamdeck because Sony already ported almost all f them\n\nWell, its technically very hard to make a handheld that can Run PS4 binaries. From the part I quoted it implies that it will run the PS4 games already ported to PC, which is much easier. I guess it could run a custom linux distro.\n\nReading a google translate of the original, it's just a comment that 'damn, there's only PS4 games available, and we have PS4 games on Steam Deck already' - it's more a comment on the consumer appeal if a lot of PS4 games are already on Steam Deck. It's not saying that this would be running PC ports of PS4 games.\n\nI'd assume this thing would be meant to be a PS4-in-a-handheld that can run your whole PS4 library (or as much as makes sense), the native PS4 binaries on the PS4 OS, otherwise it doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\nSeems pointless to me\n\nThe ability to play ones PlayStation Library and PS Plus games seamlessly on a portable device, in the same way as Steam games on Steam Deck, would be very much welcome.\n\nMy idea of what this could be like is greater than any probable reality…\n\nSadly I imagine all-digital purchasing, very limited selection (with continued apathy towards their staggering back catalogue) and ultimately, a lack of support. This includes from Sony themselves (see PSVR2/Vita) and likely third parties.\n\nI would have to imagine they would do an OS level hardware profile that downscales the heavier games to be able to run on the hardware.\n\nReading a google translate of the original, it's just a comment that 'damn, there's only PS4 games available, and we have PS4 games on Steam Deck already' - it's more a comment on the consumer appeal if a lot of PS4 games are already on Steam Deck, not that it's technically only going to run PC ports of PS4 games.\n\nI'd assume this thing would be meant to be a PS4-in-a-handheld that can run your whole PS4 library (or as much as makes sense), on the PS4 OS, otherwise it doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\nThat would be very interesting to see. But its very hard to achieve. I think that Sony would need some kind of layer for that like Steam Deck proton or perhpas more line Apple's Rosetta."
