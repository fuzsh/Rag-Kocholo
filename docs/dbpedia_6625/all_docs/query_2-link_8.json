        "text": "Sony's PSP shipments have already ceased in North America, and will be phased out worldwide by the end of the year.\n\nThe classic PlayStation Portable was replaced by the Vita two years ago, but internationally sales hadn't fared too badly. Even last September, <a href=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/128174-3DS-Surpasses-Lifetime-Wii-Sales-in-Japan>two of the top 20 handheld games were PSP titles; an impressive feat a generation after its heyday. Regardless, it was only a matter of time before Sony pulled the plug, and the manufacturer has now confirmed that worldwide PSP shipments will cease later this year.\n\nNorth American shipments already ended last January, but other regions continued sales for several months. Deliveries to Japan will conclude in June, while Europe will hold out for a bit longer. By the year's end however, the only place you'll find a PSP is at used gaming stores and online marketplaces.\n\nWhile the last days of the PSP won't be <a href=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/121372-Sony-Ceases-PlayStation-2-Production-Worldwide>as bittersweet as the PlayStation 2's swan song, the handheld had a good run nonetheless. First launched in 2004, the PSP went on to sell an estimated 76.3 million units, making it the ninth best-selling console of all time. The system still faced its share of difficulties: Sony had hoped to replicate the PS2's monstrous success as a movie player, but customers weren't interested in repurchasing UMD films at full price. The PSP also faced strong competition in its later years, not just from Nintendo's DS, but mobile gaming markets that Sony hadn't prepared for.\n\nI haven't played my PSP in a few years now, but I do have many fond memories with it. Being able to experience Grand Theft Auto and Star Wars: Battlefront on lengthy bus rides was a blast, and it first showcased the remote play features that today's Vita was able to expand on. While the gaming world has certainly moved on, the PSP was still an impressive handheld unit for its time. I, for one, can't help but feel a little sad to see it go.\n\nSource: <a href=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/gaming/Sony-set-to-discontinue-PlayStation-Portable/articleshow/35996425.cms>Times of India\n\nPermalink\n\nI remember when I first got mine. I was so excited. Up until that point, I only had a gameboy color and a very used Advanced SP, which I loved both, but the PSP had quality unparalleled in the handheld market. The first game I got was Need for Speed Most Wanted: 5-1-0, which was a very watered down version of Most Wanted on PS2/Xbox. Next was the remastered version of Valkyrie Profile, and soon my collection expanded. My favorite game by far was Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops, in my opinion THE closest representation of a MGS game on a handheld, though many people would argue Peace Walker was better.\n\nEventually I did put a couple emulators on the PSP though, such as the gameboy color and gameboy advanced, as well as a PS1 emulator for those games that the Playstation Store didn't have available. The PSP still is an amazing system. I got a PS Vita only a few days ago, and I love it, but I'll admit my hype for it doesn't even compare to how excited I was for the PSP.\n\nCid SilverWing said:\n\nUnlike the Game Boy, it didn't quite have the battery life to justify even bringing it for the bus ride, leaving it in sleep mode during school then resuming gameplay during breaks or on the bus ride back.\n\nIn my experience, anyway. Not exactly very portable either unless you got huge pockets.\n\nBattery life was quite bad. The Vita is a massive improvement though. I bring my Vita to work, play some FFX HD on breaks, put it in sleep mode, and 6 hours later it still has full battery and the game picks up as if I didn't even put the system in sleep mode.\n\nAs for portability, I didn't mind it's size. Sure, it didn't fit in pants pockets, but my jacket pockets did just fine, or I just had my messenger bag with me. However for most people I could see the problem.\n\nI love my PSP. I really do. It is my single most prized possession. I once told my wife that I only married her because I couldn't legally marry my PSP. She just laughed and thought I was joking...\n\nThe PSP is the first thing that I bought, when I have got my first real job (not counting internships). It was a red God Of War Chains Of Olympus bundle.\n\nI played it everyday on the train... GTA, God Of War, Metal Gear, Rock Band, Patapon.\n\nWhen the PSP launched, the times were different. Today, everyone is looking at their smartphones the whole time. But, back then, having a PSP was something MAGICAL. The iPhone didn't even exist. To me, the PSP is the first Gadget, the first \"smartphone\". When people saw one, they wanted to know what it was, what games it played. Is it a portable PS2?! Can it connect to the internet?\n\nAnd it had an amazing library. Almost every good PS2 game had a PSP sequel (even if the quality wasn't always great).\n\nAnthrSolidSnake said:\n\nMy favorite game by far was Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops, in my opinion THE closest representation of a MGS game on a handheld, though many people would argue Peace Walker was better.\n\nPortable Ops is, to this day, still, my favorite game of all time.\n\nI'm not saying its the best game ever made. But it is my favorite.\n\nI could write a book about why I love it, but I can try to summarize:\n\nWhat makes Portable Ops unique is that it took the PSP's limitations (as a portable system) and made it work with the Metal Gear Solid's storyline, in which Big Boss was supposed to build an army.\n\nSo we've got a stealth adventure about building and managing an private army!\n\nI obsessively captured the enemy soldiers, converted them for my cause and assigned them to jobs that really made me feel like I was commanding an unit.\n\nAnd the storyline of that game is one of the best in the series.\n\nYou had a great run PSP! I will remember you fondly!"
