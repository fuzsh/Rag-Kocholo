        "text": "A brand new video game console will be launched next month in the form of the PlayStation Portal.\n\nThe Portal is a handheld console designed to be carried around, as opposed to the standard models which are stationary and connect to your TV. Though the PlayStation Portable (PSP) of the 2000s is remembered fondly, it has been over a decade since Sony launched a handheld console in the form of the PS Vita.\n\nThe handheld console market has been largely left to Nintendo since with the Switch. However, Sony has promised to utilise “new innovations” with its handheld console, which has already sold out in pre-orders in Japan. Here is everything you need to know about the PlayStation Portal.\n\nREAD MORE: DWP's second round of Cost of Living Payment dates announced\n\nREAD MORE: We are looking for the best roast dinner in Liverpool\n\nFeatures\n\nUnusually for a handheld device, the Portal requires a standard console in the form of the PlayStation 5 to operate. It is more of a companion console in that sense, allowing players to remotely stream games from your main console to the device over WiFi, bypassing the need for a television and letting you play games anywhere at home.\n\nIt will play games that are installed on your device and use the controller. PS VR2 games and games played through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming, are not supported.\n\nLike the Switch, the Portal is designed with two control pads on each side and a tablet screen in the middle. Sony’s new Pulse Elite wireless headset and Pulse Explore wireless earbuds are also compatible with the Portal, although both items are sold separately.\n\nPrice\n\nThe Portal’s recommended retail price is £199.99. It can be pre-ordered from Amazon, Argos, Game and The Game Collection.\n\nRelease date\n\nThe PlayStation Portal will be released on November 15 in the UK.\n\nGet the top stories straight to your inbox by signing up to our what's on newsletter"
