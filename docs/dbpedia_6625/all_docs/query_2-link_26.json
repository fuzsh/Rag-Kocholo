        "text": "A new PlayStation handheld rumor making waves on social media suggests a new PSP successor is in the works. Can Sony avoid the mistakes of the past?\n\nOpinion by Miri Teixeira\n\nPublished 06 Feb 2024\n\nFollowtopics\n\nMiri Teixeira\n\nThe potential of a new PlayStation handheld rumor has currently captured the attention of social media at large. I'm still over here trying to get to grips with the PlayStation Portal handheld for PS5, but as a recovering PS Vita stan, I can't deny the rumor mill has me very excited. There are a lot of bumps ahead for Sony in it's heading down this path, but here's what I think the company is going to have to offer to win us over.\n\nHow will Sony make the new portable different from the PSP and Vita?\n\nI wouldn't blame you if the prospect of a new PlayStation portable console feels you with equal parts jubilation and dread, yet here we are again. According to a report from Moore's Law is Dead (who you'll recall leaked the PS5 Slim to us well ahead of its reveal), a follow-up to the PS Vita is \"currently in the high level design phase\" and is seemingly roughly two years away from launch at the least.\n\nThat dread you may feel likely comes from the fact that, despite their greatest aspects, Sony's portable consoles have never quite lived up to their expectations. There are a lot of stories out there about why the PSP didn't receive the love it deserved, ranging from the revolutionary Nintendo DS releasing around the same time, to the lack of battery life and restrictive UMD format. That said, at least the PSP was a fair success in terms of sales.\n\nThe PS Vita, on the other hand, was not. After the commercial failure of its second handheld, Sony announced that there would be no follow-up device, and seemed to leave handheld gaming in Nintendo's capable hands for the next few years.\n\nIn theory, the Vita was almost the perfect conception — not far off the Switch in terms of ergonomics, capabilities, and portability. It looked good, it felt good, and it had one of those fancy touchscreens everyone seemed to want. However, there were too many drawbacks for the console to gather momentum in the West.\n\nIf you were a visual novel fan — as I was — it was everything you ever needed. It was basically a portable Danganronpa-playing device. But those hoping for more action-packed AAA games were more often served mobile titles, and at its relatively high price point (particularly for those proprietary memory cards), the Vita just couldn't hold up under the increasing pressure of the 3DS.\n\nSuffice it to say that with both of its major portable initiatives, Sony has struggled to maintain a foothold in the handheld market. This, understandably, should inspire some trepidation on behalf of prospective handheld buyers and Vita survivors everywhere. Yet, there's still so much potential in a new PlayStation handheld, so let's instead turn our attention towards the future.\n\nSony's next handheld needs to tap into its niche\n\nI've spoken to a number of people and have read many online comments, and have thus concluded that for those who have yet to buy a handheld console, it's because the market has missed their niche.\n\nThe Switch, in their eyes, is too focused on kids/party games and offers no backward compatibility. Meanwhile, the Steam Deck and its various PC competitors are too \"techy\" and obtuse. I'm not convinced either of these perceptions are completely accurate, but I think if Sony wants to play its new handheld smart, it'll want to lean into the gulf right in the middle. Basically: position this supposed \"PSP 3\" as a simple to use, teens-to-adult focused, all-in-one handheld platform capable of supporting both powerful and smaller games.\n\nWhen it comes to exclusives, Sony also has to play this carefully. For those who stick to their PS5 and PS4 consoles and have so far eschewed a handheld, a move to support Nintendo or Steam would be too much — they don't want to lose their entire library in the shift to another platform. It's expensive, inconvenient, and sometimes impossible (when games are PlayStation exclusives, for example).\n\nThe biggest gift to existing PlayStation gamers (which would reflect directly in sales) would be to launch a handheld that supports their existing PlayStation library as well as new releases with a focus on PS Plus titles. Fortunately, if the rumors are to be believed, that's exactly what seems to be on the cards.\n\nImplementing this could be tough, as one of the things that harmed the sales performance of the Vita was the promised backward compatibility with the PSP — yet the total lack of a UMD disc drive meant that this was only true for digital titles. To compensate, Sony would have to implement a similar concept to its PS5 upgrade scheme — a scheme that allowed for digital variants of physical games to be moved across platforms. This seems unlikely, but at least at this early stage we can dream.\n\nI believe the new handheld will need to lean into the indie market, perhaps even championing smaller developers and supporting creators in a way they haven't been previously. Indie games are incredibly easy to get on Steam, so PlayStation will need to offer something to coax them away from the PC market. Perhaps the classic Sony tactic of splashing cash on exclusives would do the trick.\n\nNew PlayStation portable console could support PS5 and PS4 games\n\nThat being said, if Sony doesn't learn from the Tale of The Vita and solidly support AAA games on its platform, they will run into trouble. One thing you can't fault Nintendo on: they keep throwing exclusive AAA games at the Switch every year. Unless Sony's handheld console is uniquely affordable, people will be wary of dropping big bucks on something that could fail to support their favorite games on the go and will ultimately just stick with Nintendo.\n\nThe rumor suggests that this supposed \"PSP3\" will be powered by AMD, will be a non-streaming console, and will be capable of supporting PS4 and PS5 games. All of these are green flags so far, but if Sony strays too far toward the money grab, it could see another commercial failure on its hands.\n\nSony has to time and pitch the new console just right to slip by the Switch and Steam Deck and offer something tangibly different to a market that may finally be ready to forgive and forget. Here's hoping they pull it off though — I know I could use a new PS Vita in my life.\n\nSpeaking of, don't sleep on the very best PS Vita games — they're still going strong! Let us know in the comments if you'd invest in the next Sony handheld console, and if not, what it would need to offer to win you over.\n\nWritten by Miri Teixeira\n\nMiri's hobbies outside of gaming inform everything about their on-screen preferences: Lots of reading, irritatingly tough puzzles, and anything vaguely historical. As such, they're always on the lookout for another Disco Elysium-type read-a-thon, a Myst-like island to get lost in, or an ancient time capsule like The Forgotten City. Other than that, if anything is being described as \"weird and unsettling\", it's either Miri, or their new favorite indie game.\n\nHide ads\n\nGet the biggest PlayStation news delivered straight to your inbox every week.\n\nJoin"
