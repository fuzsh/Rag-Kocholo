        "text": "I never liked the PSP and I'm not sure why. Ironically, I love the vita / pstv. I think I did not like the UMDs and that just drove me away from the console as a whole. I always felt they were big and bulky to carry around in conjunction with the psp itself. I missed out on a lot of really great games because of my hate for the handheld. I still don't have any desire to go back and collect for it.\n\nWith the Vita, I have been playing some of the PSP games I did miss out on via PSN. I do really enjoy them so far too. I hate the vita property memory passionately. I bought a 64gb card so I've got lots of room to download psp titles I missed.\n\nI think had sony done a consolized psp or add on for the ps3 (like the GC GBA Player) I would have been really into the psp. Unrelated, I'd kill for Nintendo to do a 3DS / DS add on for the Wii U.\n\nI got to decent puzzle games. I wouldn't pay much for them, but I payed 2 bucks each, and for that Price I'm really happy:\n\nEvery Extend Extra\n\nGunpey\n\nIf you can put enough time into learning it, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite is an amazing game. It#s not as niche as it might seem. It's a stripped down Action RPG with a complex and incredibly well done combat and it focuses a lot on that. There's gathering, and some other stuff that detract in my oppinion, but it's ridiculously easy to get 20 hours out of the game, and if you get into it you'll go over 100 no doubt.\n\nAs far as consoles go, I only have a 3000 and a E1000 (street). The 3000 is great, but it has an interlaced Screen. I don't know what got into Sony for doing that, it will bother you for sure if you hate those interlace jagged lines.\n\nThe e1000 is a cost cutting model that really cuts a ton. The Screen is a kinda crappy TN that you have to hold at the right angle or you'll see jack. It also doesn't have wifi, and you can't Exchange the battery easily. But besides These pretty serious Problems it's actually pretty decent, and as Long as you hold it steady playing with it feels good. Oh, until you have to Play the start or select Buttons. They used Buttons flush with the System covered with a plastic fil, just like the original 3DS. That kinda stuff just plain sucks. On my psp 3000 all those menu Buttons are great. On the PSP E1000 it seriously annoys me specially in the dark.\n\nI hate manu RPGS at this Point, but I really enjoyed Breath of fire 3 on the PSP GO a while back. I can't tell you why I liked it, to me now, thinking back,, that game is utter crap. But I guess if you're into JRPGs with those menu combat Systems you'll possibly like it. The Story is good it you like shit stories.\n\nSeriously. I did enjoy the game...\n\nJust don't Forget. Hack your System immedtialy, buy a mSD to MS Duo Adapter and copy all your games to micro SD Cards. Those UMDs do suck ass, but if you just install the games the System suddenly becomes much better. Hacking a PSP is ridiculously easy. I was impressed. You don't even Need to make an Image or anything. You just put a couple files in the Card you formated witht he PSP itself and you run a program. Done. That will allow you to back up and Play your origial UMDs, and like that the System really shines.\n\nControlls are great on both the PSP 3000 and E1000. I did have a go, but the butrons and d-pad are shallow and clicky, giving it a very distinct feel. The analog is kinda crap, and I hated it whenever I had to use it. To Play somehting like Frogger or Pac Man it works great. For games where you wanto to fluently Switch directions and for a more playstation Controller Feeling the normal PSP is just worlds above.\n\nI Still think the PSP GO has it's place, and now that you can find it for decent Prices it's actually worth a buy for having a small actually portable System. It's super small and light, and the Screen is great.\n\nIf anyone wants to know more just ask, I just got my PSPs and am having tons of fun with them. I did have the go before, where I mostly played PS1 games, minis, etc.. I even used it as my MP3 Player for a while. But nowadays even my utter crap Nokia cellphone that's not even a Smartphone Plays MP3.. So that's hardly a selling Point.\n\nIf you're not into the PSP's poor screens, the console emulates extremely well on the PC. The games look great in HD.\n\nhttp://ppsspp.org/screenshots.html\n\nDespite what the website says, you dont really need a powerful PC to get 1080p gameplay. My mid-tier gaming rig from 2010 was able to max out all games at 60fps.\n\nWell said. To me this console hit it perfectly on all fronts. With a modded PSP you can easily copy UMDs to the PC and emulate the games. I haven't done it yet, but I intend on buying Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, ripping it and playing on the PC. And of course, with that I can also Play the collections of fighting games and arcade games ON the PC. It's not strictly legal, but as long as I have the UMD I feel it's fair.\n\nAnd then I can still Play These games on the go.\n\nHaven't seen it mentioned, There's a Mega Man and a Ghosts and Goblings made for the PSP.\n\nIt's well known, the library of JRPGS on PSP is just huge.\n\nI'm searching. I guess there are many more good actual hidden gems for this console ( Like Gunpey and EEE) I'll Keep searching. I think any hidden gems will be selling for nothing, since PSP UMDs right now are pretty much at the bottom of the pit of undesireable gaming trash. I'd say they are what Atari games were during the NES and SNES era, with the exception some PSP games are actually expensive. I guess back in the day Atari games were all dirt cheap. Too few People gave a toss wether an atari game was \"rare\" or not."
