        "text": "Since the introduction of tiers to PlayStation Plus, Sony's subscription-based service for PlayStation users, players have grappled with the decision of which tier provides the best value for their money. PlayStation Plus now offers three tiers, each progressively offering more games through Game Catalog, Classics Catalog, and Game Trials. Recent reports suggest that a PlayStation Portable title may be the next addition to the Classics Catalog.\n\nIn a tweet by the gaming news source Gematsu, it has come to light that the PSP game based on the Pixar franchise, Up, has recently received a rating in Taiwan for both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. The reevaluation of the game's rating in any country typically suggests its impending release on a different platform, which points towards a potential entry into the Classics Catalog for this title.\n\nHowever, fans are not too happy about it, with some suggesting that PlayStation should “pick better titles” to validate the Premium tier for accessing Classic titles. Another opinion shared is that there are “many better PSP games to add.” While Up may evoke nostalgia for a specific group of players, the choice is questioned regarding its appeal to a broader audience. What old title would you prefer to see featured in the Classics Catalog next? Here's hoping for the Sly Cooper series to be the next addition.\n\nPlayStation Players Majorly Opt For 12-Month PS Plus Plans\n\nIn other PlayStation news, PlayStation CEO Hiroki Totoki revealed during the latest earnings call (via Tweak Town) that the majority of PlayStation Plus users opt for the 12-month plans, constituting approximately 60% of users. This trend is not surprising, considering that the 12-month plans offer significant savings in the long term compared to the cost of purchasing 1-month or 3-month plans individually.\n\nPlayStation Portal Release Date Announced for Australia and New Zealand"
