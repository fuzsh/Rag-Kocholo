        "text": "1\n\nMoroboshi876\n\nThey finally gave up. It was about time.\n\nNot that I hate them (just a little), but it's clear that handheld market is very little and two systems can hardly coexist. Now, with the Switch cattering to Nintendo style games and also general games for hardcore gamers too... there wasn't actually room for the PS Vita. Which was beaten by the 3DS anyway.\n\nThere is a reason Atari Lynx, Game Gear and Neo Geo Pocket, among others, didn't succeed.\n\n2\n\nJoeDiddley\n\nNo current plans hopefully doesn’t mean it’ll never happen, especially given the success of the Switch.\n\nBut they have been burned twice now, a shame really as I like handheld systems that try and offer full experiences - by both Nintendo and Sony.\n\n3\n\nFragRed\n\nIt makes sense. For the same reason Nintendo effectively abandoned trying to support 2 systems, Sony also couldn't support both a handheld and home console. Something had to give.\n\n4\n\nkopaka\n\nSo, now you just need to buy Playstation as your home console and Nintendo's device as a handheld? Thats kinda both cheap and useful, thanx, Sony!\n\n5\n\nbratzdoll\n\nNooooooo\n\nCompetition only benefits the consumer, I hope they change their mind.\n\n6\n\nAnti-Matter\n\nMy judgements :\n\nNDS >>> PSP\n\n3DS >>>>>>>>> Ps vita\n\nSony handhelds are suck.\n\nBoth of them are Failed to impress me.\n\nTheir games by mostly = Blah.\n\nJust leave it to Nintendo for King of Handheld games.\n\nHail to NDS & 3DS !\n\n7\n\nPlayerOne\n\nIt's not all that surprising, but I really like my Vita, and I've pretty much given up gaming on phones and tablets. I'd imagine the 3DS doesn't have all that long, and is there a successor planned? Or is the Switch going to take on both roles for Nintendo?\n\n8\n\nRhaoulos\n\n\"Leaving It All To Nintendo\" It feels like this was already the case with the PSVita\n\n9\n\nMr_Pepperami\n\nKind of a shame. The original PSP was excellent and had a lot of great stuff on it. While Sony dumped the vita way too early and left it to others to build it to what it became. Good news for Nintendo though.\n\n10\n\nhippoeater\n\n@JoeDiddley I don’t know that I would call selling 82 million psp’s burned twice - the ps vita for sure - still sold more units than the Wii U tho\n\n11\n\nmeppi64\n\nAfter the way they handled the Vita and it's fans, I personally wouldn't trust them enough to buy a new handheld from them anyway.\n\nAnd that's coming from someone who had the Vita as his main gaming system for a couple of years.\n\n12\n\nZuljaras\n\nPSP was great. Vita was just nice.\n\nI have them both and still play them.\n\nI am sad for the Vita but it was inevitable.\n\nPeople, ignore the hate-weirdo of the forums. It is best to avoid its tantrums.\n\n@misterMike what to expect from mentally unstable people with troubled past\n\n13\n\nRazer\n\nI never liked Sony, i did enjoy their PSP and PS Vita but their biggest issue was selling 90% of their games digital, giving the Vita hardly any internal storage and locking people into purchasing Sony only SD cards that cost almost as much as the console itself if you wanted to have a decent amount of storage.\n\nTo be honest Sony had no idea what they were really doing in this space... They were trying to follow Nintendo's lead (as usual), except with more power but that all came to a head with the Vita...\n\nI believe the reason for Sony's hard headed stance on price of the thing and price of SD cards was simply production costs...\n\nI remember reading in 2014 that PS Vita had cost Sony nearly a billion in production costs that haven't been recouped.\n\nThat is a HUGE loss.\n\n14\n\nGrailUK\n\nThey are so looking at hybrids. It's obvious.\n\n15\n\ngcunit\n\nHardware will continue to converge.\n\n16\n\nLando_\n\nI liked the Vita more than the Switch - as a handheld. But Sony didn't support it. It was killed by their creators. I think, another handheld by the PlayStation makers would face a similar destiny. I don't think Sony would beat the likes of Zelda and Mario in the portable market anyway. They'll always remain second with okay'ish sales numbers. :/\n\n17\n\nRazer\n\nhttp://thevitalounge.net/2014/05/15/sonys-fiscal-year-ps-vita-by-the-numbers/\n\nYep 1.2 billion lost in 2014, Vita accounted for 80% of that loss.\n\n18\n\nGKO900\n\nNo surprise Nintendo has always been the King of Handheld consoles just like PlayStation is the King of Home consoles, too bad the Switch it's not a true handheld console such a disappointing console to me\n\n19\n\n6ch6ris6\n\nbut the vita had such cool memory cards\n\ntrollololollololololol\n\n20\n\n1UP_MARIO\n\nDidn’t have a vita but still loved the psp, a revolutionary handheld of its time. Sad news for gamers\n\n21\n\nThe-Chosen-one\n\nIts better that way. And dont go the Hybrid (nintendo switch) road as well. Stay in the home console please that way when sony comes with a new home console i will buy it again next to Nintendo. MICROSOFT kinda lost my interest or they need to step up their game with lots of exclusives.\n\n22\n\ntc-senzei\n\nEver since the model and screens for the nintendo switch surfaced on the internet and we knew that it was gonna be a hybrid system, you can put money on it that playstation will copy them.......once again\n\nAnd fail.....once again\n\n23\n\nPod\n\nThey really did give it a go.\n\nTheir systems were super sleek, and of very high build quality.\n\nA salute!\n\n24\n\ngeordie\n\nThe Vita will live on in the modding scene.\n\nGreat handheld, shame Sony had no idea what to do with it.\n\n@Anti-Matter you really do bore me.\n\n25\n\nAlexSora89\n\nI definitely get what the article's subtitle is aiming at, but jeez NintendoLife if your timing is awful.\n\nDefinitely bummed about this. Sony could have put up a decent handheld business - the Vita was essentially Switch before Switch - if they only gave an actual crap about it. When first-party resources keep going to PS4 and even the PS3 with the Vita barely getting PS3 ports, that's kind of what happens.\n\n26\n\nkozaihod\n\nKinda sad, kinda not. The Vita is a great piece of hardware, (far far better than 3DS in my opinion) with the best screen of all the handhelds ever (OLED of the fat version) and is home to a lot of great indie titles. The PSP is a haven of JRPGs (Legend of Heroes series, Ys, Final Fantasies, Star Ocean, Valkyria Chronicles) and a slew of solid PSX titles. Plus the d-pad on the Vita is beyond godly. On the other hand, support for the console from Sony is absymal. Here's hoping the companies that had the PSP and Vita in high regard (Xseed with its Falcom translations, Square, tri-ace) will move their efforts to Switch.\n\n27\n\nRazer\n\n@GKO900 actually i kind of see what you mean... The Switch as a handheld is actually great but as a console its already out of date...\n\n4k TVs at start of 2017 were still rare are now not as rare and by this time next year even less so... Which tells me that the Switch has maybe 12 to 18 months left in it as a viable home console.\n\nBut if you own a 4k TV your gonna want a PS4 Pro or Xbox One X to accompany that over priced TV. You won't purchase a console that doesn't use the benefit you just paid 1.5+ grand for.\n\nNintendo needs to realize this within the next 3 months and act on it quickly... 3 things that need to be done as this approaces:\n\n1 - price drop via no packed in dock\n\n2 - Nintendo neeeeds to find a way to lower the cost of games, if not physical then at least digital\n\n3 - Nintendo needs a proper MH game built from the ground up for the Switch and as a portable.\n\nEdit: a possible 4th thing would be bringing street pass back on the Switch... It wasn't popular here but huge in Japan... It added a lot of value to portable gaming and Nintendo needs to send that message.\n\nI trust Nintendo as a portable gaming manufacturer\n\n28\n\nDualmask\n\nNot unexpected, but I actually liked the PSP and Vita more than the DS/3DS line. No one beats Nintendo in the handheld market, and I had both Sony and Nintendo handhelds, but I preferred the single screen systems like Game Boy Advance (which I thought the PSP was the spiritual successor to), the PSP, Vita, and now the Switch. I barely played my 3DS except for Monster Hunter and ended up handing it down to my son when I got my Switch.\n\nIf only Sony didn't screw up the Vita so badly with its lack of support and proprietary memory sticks.\n\n29\n\nSuper_Gravy\n\nTo be honest, this is considered an bad news for me since there's no one will complete with Nintendo to keep the portable gaming industry alive. I supposed we are switching to mobile world a lot more quickly than we excepted. I don't mind mobile games with Bluetooth controller supports but we are lacking in those markets.\n\n30\n\nKwehst\n\nI got both my PSP and Vita day one. They held so much potential in my eyes... “oh the PSP is like a ps1.5!” Oh good! Maybe I can relive the glory of the ps1 era again yay! Sadly it just became my ps1 emulator machine....\n\nVita was going to be my ps2.5! No, was basically the bearer for my final fantasy 1-9/dissidia museum. If only it had proper R2 and L2 buttons I would’ve even used it for remote play. Alas\n\nOh well. I will still miss Sony’s attempts at the handheld market, but Nintendo will always be king on that front.\n\n31\n\nThe_Pixel_King\n\n@Medic_alert Oh hell yeah! I love my Vita, but I’d gladly pay a full retail £49.99 for a proper Persona 4 Golden HD remaster. Heck, with P4G’s cult fan base, I reckon it would help Nintendo shift even more Switch units!\n\n[EDIT]: Oh and there’s one other thing the Switch needs from Vita... its bloody D-pad!\n\n32\n\ndimi\n\nI love my PS Vita and yes Persona 4 golden is the best game! Also i loved Fifa 2015, Minecraft and Stardew Valley.\n\nUncharted Golden Abyss is looking as good as any Switch game. It was more than a tech demo!\n\n33\n\nblockfight\n\nLoved my psp back in the day. But those umd disks were a bad design. And only being able to use Sony memory cards instead of the standard SD cards was another big mistake.\n\n34\n\nSuper_Gravy\n\n@Kwehst I agreed with you about remote play which is why I was thinking of getting attachment for my first OLED fat Vita to have L2 and R2 buttons.\n\n35\n\nGKO900\n\n@Medic_alert Well anything can be better than Wii U lol, but anyways I don't like that it tries to compete with consoles thanks to the hybrid nature of the console which I understand but I only buy Nintendo consoles as my secondary console for their unique games and exclusives like the 3DS which has games like Etrian Odyssey and also had Monster Hunter for a time and others, also it has poor battery, I find the joy cons gimmicky, no local save backups, and in my opinion it's overpriced with some games having the Nintendo tax and more but that's my opinion\n\n36\n\nRazer\n\n@Medic_alert your are a fool if you think your mentality is the majority.\n\nI already know people who work close by to my dock yard, during lunch we talk by the canal, many own 4k TVs... People don't purchase 4k TVs for novelty and you are dumb if you believe that.\n\nJust because we dont care about visuals doesn't make us the majority... Far from it...\n\nPeople who purchase 4k TVs will purchase 4k equipment to go with it... If you believe otherwise you are again a fool.\n\nIf you think 4k won't catch on... Again you are a fool... It already has.\n\n37\n\nThe_Pixel_King\n\n@Medic_alert Now I come to think of it, there’s a bunch of really cool Vita RPG’s that really ought to be on Switch. I’m talking all three Danganronpa games, Vanillaware’s gorgeous Muramasa Rebirth, Dragon’s Crown and Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir, plus 2019’s Catherine: Fully Body.\n\n38\n\nAlexSora89\n\n@Medic_alert\n\nI know. I'm specifically talking about the year-dash-year format.\n\n39\n\nSuper_Gravy\n\nI bought my 4K TV for like 400 bucks CAD... So... its getting cheaper over time. I got 4K Netflix and that's it so far but people I know who got 4K got PS4 Pro.\n\n40\n\nGKO900\n\n@Razer I prefer if they focus more on the handheld side instead of trying to appeal to the home console side honestly that market it's already dominated by Sony but on the handheld one Nintendo rules but not with those crazy prices of games accessories and now having to pay online too\n\n41\n\nRayquaza2510\n\nVita is still fun and where Nintendo had always great handheld games overall, PSP and Vita had the JRPGs and VN's and in case of the PSP the raw power made some games better compared to the DS.\n\nBut now they are gone which is sad, because there is nobody else on the handheld market now to compete with Nintendo.\n\nBut it gives me a little laugh when I read Nintendo is the handheld king, sales wise yes but with the switch they made mistakes (voicechat via phone app, no local backups ect) that even while I really like the system a lot, just make me annoyed because even a \"king\" makes mistakes...\n\nI'm sure the Switch will get a lot of great games, I enjoy the Switch a lot and it's good to see lots of great games come to it.\n\n@Razer billion japanese yen, which is a lot less than dollars, also it was a total loss including the Vita.\n\nThe biggest loss ever for Sony was the PS3 because the Cell processor was stupidly expensive.\n\n42\n\nSuper_Gravy\n\n@The_Pixel_King\n\nVanillaware games are awesome!\n\n@Medic_alert\n\nThat's suck... I remap control by using PS4 accessibility for some games.\n\n43\n\nThe_Pixel_King\n\n@Medic_alert You’re right, most games are perfectly fine making do with four separate direction buttons. And yep, the JoyCon set-up certainly hampers fighting games, but for me, 2D platformers do feel infinitely better with a finely tuned D-pad. Especially the twitchy variety.\n\n44\n\nBionicDodo\n\nShame. I love my Vita. Pretty fond of my PSP too, although the lack of a second stick hurt it.\n\n45\n\nMrBlacky\n\nI believe, sooner or later Nintendo will also leave the handheld market and hybrid consoles like the Switch will become the future.\n\n46\n\nRazer\n\n@Medic_alert\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.tvtechnology.com/.amp/news/4k-quickly-becoming-standard-for-tv-sales\n\nOnly a matter of time before 4k is the standard... Unlike Blueray... This is actually catching on... Its the next level past HD or ultra hd...\n\n47\n\nRayquaza2510\n\n@KingdomHeartsFan one of the reasons Vita died are the smartphones, 3ds survived because it had the exclusive Nintendo games mostly.\n\nStill sad because smartphone gaming still mostly sucks after all these years.\n\n48\n\nRazer\n\n@GKO900 thats exactly what i was getting at with my 3 points... All would put bigger focus on Handheld rather than home console...\n\nNintendo has no future in the home console market... They beat Sony at portable but got hammered in the home console.\n\n49\n\nAdrevenue\n\nAs much as I loved the DS family they could never hold a candle to the psp/Vita for me. In fact I play my old psp as much as the switch\n\nvery sad imo.\n\n50\n\nRazer\n\n@KingdomHeartsFan sorry i have had this discussion with people before... Before hd became a thing and now with 4k.\n\nBoth times with Nintendo fans and imo anyone who doesn't understand advancing technology tends to be... Lets face it... A bit foolish.\n\nBut yea sorry for the names... Just wish people would get with the times and see things change...\n\nThese discussions reminds me of the ones i would have with smqrt phone doubters in 2009... 2 years later they all shut up.\n\n51\n\nAlexSora89\n\n@Medic_alert\n\nNot even remotely willing to spark up a controversy over this. I made the mistake of posting the comment before finishing it, but the rest of said comment, edited in afterwards, is the part that's actually related to the article itself. The opening bit was merely something I wanted to point out.\n\n52\n\nNinChocolate\n\nConfirms my thoughts. Though, I’d have liked a Vita 2 (but not at launch lol)\n\n53\n\nRazer\n\n@Medic_alert i think you are not giving the average consumer much credit...\n\nMost i know are VERY tech savvy... They dont know much about gaming or latest games but they know their technology...\n\nMany of these people purchase consoles and hardly ever switch them on... Just have them.there just in case... As an entertainment option if needed...\n\nThat is 80% of consumers... Most fall under that particular category... Not all buy consoles but most tend to stay up to date with technology and the latest must haves\n\n54\n\nRayquaza2510\n\n@Frendo \"I saw that Vita was absolutely dead in the western market\"\n\nBad sales? Yes but not really dead.\n\nI am mostly a handheld gamer because I am on the go a lot, so next to my love for Nintendo handhelds I also have a PSP and Vita for games that are playstation only.\n\nVita was almost the first handheld ever to skip because a lot of people told me it was dead and I too never saw Vita games at a shop.\n\nTill I accidently came across the Vita community...\n\nVita has 1400+ games worldwide from which 800+ in english, from that excluding limited runs the systems has 300+ physical english games, so for english gaming it's mostly digital.\n\nThat's maybe no a lot, but I wouldn't call it dead by far, meanwhile good gamingshops like play-asia (which Gamestop isn't) still have a lot of english Vita titles.\n\nVita failled a lot, but really it got till last year a lot of great games, some of them afterwards ported to the Switch like YS VIII or Fate/Extella.\n\n55\n\nNincompoop\n\nSony gave up on Vita years ago, now they finally buried it. LOL Vita (Life) is finally dead.\n\nSony wants to focus on just one console so they can put all efforts into making better PS4 games, similar to Nintendo getting rid of 3DS eventually and concentrating on Switch.\n\n56\n\nBlizzia\n\n@Razer I'd agree if it seemed like it was the truth, but it isn't. Yes, 4k TVs are being sold. Yes, 4k hardware exists. But it's pretty easy to see on hardware sales that people aren't really feeling the 4k craze yet. Buying a 4k TV doesn't mean you'll be buying a 4k console either. I know many people who just wanted a big 4k TV but still grabbed the base ps4 because the purpose of the TV was watching movies. AKA completely unrelated.\n\nThe thing is we're in an era where people are split between \"4k is the next big thing\" and \"well 4k is neat and all, but 1080p looks just fine, so why bother?\"\n\nI'm in the 2nd camp as well. I see no point in 4k, because I'd never get a big TV and I don't actually feel like it looks that much better for the price point.\n\nEither way, the Switch is dominating hardcore, and that hardware won't go 4k, that's for sure.\n\nThat, and we aren't graphics freaks over in the Nintendo camp. Gameplay reigns supreme, and that's how it'll continue. Nintendo doesn't need to make any changes to their current course, they just need to keep going.\n\n57\n\nRayquaza2510\n\n@The_Pixel_King Catherine is not coming to the west on Vita\n\nMeanwhile Atlus said few years back that core Persona games or games like Catherine don't fit on Nintendo in their opinion, hench the Persona Q spin off games.\n\n58\n\nSlim1999\n\nNah nah nah goodbye\n\n59\n\nThe_Pixel_King\n\n@Rayquaza2510 Really? Oh man, I could have sworn Catherine was coming to western Vita’s 😔\n\n[EDIT]: What with Switch attracting more and more mature gamers, perhaps Atlus will soften their stance regarding what is (and isn’t) suitable for Nintendo fans?\n\n60\n\nRazer\n\n@Blizzia dude Hardcore and everything will go 4k... These things take time but I'll be sure to hit you up when your chewing on your words in a couple of years time.\n\nFirst HD TVs were available in the late 90s but didn't vecome standard till the mid 00s...\n\n4k came out in March 2016....\n\nSo how long do you think before you start chowing down on a words sandwich 😂😂😂... I give it 2 to 3 years at most but considering...\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.tvtechnology.com/.amp/news/4k-quickly-becoming-standard-for-tv-sales\n\n4k tv by many analysts is set to be the standard within the next couple of years.\n\nSo you say it won't catch on with gamers? 😂😂... You remember the change from SD to HD... I remember seeing many gamers like you... Many even stopped gaming after too... Dont worry it won't hurt much.\n\n61\n\nRedMageLanakyn\n\nAnd on this day the NL staff weeped, as they realized they just lost a dozen possible fanboy flaming articles with this tragic news\n\n62\n\nRistar24\n\n'All to Nintendo' and the numerous other portable devices... OK, so you mean 'platforms primarily dedicated to gaming' I liked the Vita a lot, I still use it on trips to play the Capcom compilations, Earth Defense Force and various other digital PSP games (along with my GBA SP).\n\nWas a really good system, though the memory card cost was just silly. I'd put the PSP and Vita up there with the GB, GBA and DS as my favorite handhelds, always because of the various great games I played on them, not the brand itself.\n\n63\n\nHollowGrapeJ\n\nThat sucks, but I suppose it was for the best. I doubt they'd go the portable console route like Nintendo either. But I wouldn't mind if they did.\n\n64\n\nWoosh193\n\nOnce upon a time there was a gaming site that gave every non Sony game a crap score ...................................................\n\nEnough said 😁\n\n65\n\nBlizzia\n\n@Razer You can say what you want, but we're only on year 2 of the Switch. It won't grow powerful enough to manage 4k on games even with a hardware revision, and that's that.\n\nWe also won't be seeing 4k become the gaming standard simply because the prices will still be ridiculous in 2-3 years. Right now if I wanted a proper 4k curved TV it'll cost me over 3k euro. That's not going to magically drop to what most people can afford, i.e. sub 1k euro, in 2-3 years.\n\nAnd until it does drop to sub 1k euro, it's not gonna become standard. People just don't have the money. This is also why game consoles have to stay within certain hardware ranges, because the price point needs to be low enough for it to actually sell well.\n\nFeel free to let me know when 4k gaming is the world standard. I doubt you'll be pinging me anytime soon.\n\nAt least not within the lifetime of the Nintendo Switch\n\n66\n\nNemodius\n\nthe PSP 2000 was the last good one for them, they added \"tv-out\" to the 3000, but other than that, Sony has NOT brought enough with their successive system to the table to make them worth it, if they just added a second set of L&R (L2&R2), it could have expanded the system enough in many ways including ports from the PSX & PS2, Nintendo has always tried to create not just processing and graphical upgrades, but also major ability upgrades and options for future abilities, which Nintendo has always brought to the table big time, they had a (magnetic) disk upgrade and an early \"Nintendo Direct\" satelite service for the ORIGINAL NES !!!, but most competitive systems have usually not done that, Nintendo has not always had the best processors or graphics, but they gave so much more to the players, it made them look at Nintendo first or as an equal, so it's good Sony is saying goodbye to the portable market\n\n67\n\nMountain_Man\n\nWhile it's fun to own a product that is the undisputed king (in this case, the Nintendo Switch as a handheld console), competition is what drives quality and innovation, and without at least one competitor in the handheld market nipping at Nintendo's heels, they could easily lose their edge.\n\n68\n\nHaywired\n\nI don't think you can say \"the PlayStation Portable ... a device created to tap the insanely popular Nintendo DS market\" when they came out at the same time.\n\n69\n\nMando44646\n\nI really don't get this. Particularly in Japan, where portables are the thing that consumers prefer. Seems like too much money left on the table.\n\nThen again, I wouldn't buy it anyway. Not after Sony burned me so hard by killing the Vita\n\n70\n\nchiefeagle02\n\nIt was good while it lasted.\n\n71\n\nRayquaza2510\n\n@Frendo that sucks, I live in the Netherlands and without prepaying fees (cheaper directly at PA) shipping is €6 for a loose game.\n\nOther options I use for Vita and other games are eBay (only from EU sellers and if from japan than only free shipping and up to €22), 365games UK, Nedgame, Amazon and sometimes places like CeX, Nisa EU or Bol.com\n\n@jhewitt3476 you complain about the lack of L2 and R2 buttons, but did the 3ds have it?\n\nNo, also I still remember that terrible circlepad pro thing and the first thing I did when the New 3ds came out was recplacing my old one for it, c-stick should be on 3ds from the start.\n\n72\n\nOctane\n\n@Frendo That's true for the Wii (±100m) to Wii U (±15m) as well, what went wrong? Even DS (±150m) to 3DS (±75m) is quite a big drop. I don't think there's a single reason. But I do think that a sudden surge in interest in gaming among the non-gamers occured during the seventh generation; Every console was successful, considering that ±80m sales was the 'least' successful console (PSP, PS3, and 360). I think mobile/tablet gaming took over near the end of the seventh generation with the introduction of smartphones. Of course, marketing plays a big role, the game library, etc. It's difficult to pin it down on one reason alone, as it's more than likely a combination of a lot of factors, and maybe a little bit of bad luck.\n\n73\n\nJustaguest\n\nCompetition is good. Bad news.\n\n74\n\nRadioHedgeFund\n\nBack in 2005 I leveraged my position at a popular up-market department store to grab a PSP when there were none to be had.\n\nStaff weren’t allowed to reserve them, but I checked stock nationwide and our Nottingham branch had one left. I rang up their back room call centre, reserved it and then jumped on the train from Sheffield to go get it £180 with WipEout Pure.\n\nIt’s easy to forget in the age of the iPad and 6” phones that when it came out, the PSP had the biggest LCD of any portable consumer product and it looked astounding. Where the DS clicked once you played Warioware and used the touchscreen for the first time, you only had to gaze at the PSP to want one.\n\nI loved mine to bits. Particular fun was going to coffee shops and using the free WiFi (back when nobody had it at home) to download the WipEout DLC and browse the internet. It seems quaint in 2018 but in 2005, there was nothing like the PSP.\n\nI played the PSP and the DS to death for the next 3 years, but as soon as I played Super Monkey Ball on my iPhone in 2008 I knew the reign of the handheld was over.\n\nIt’s an equally remarkable and depressing thought that with my kids and wife hogging the Switch and Xbox all the damned time, my most-played gaming device is the iPhone.\n\n75\n\nDanteSolablood\n\nWell, this is both sad & fully expected - Sony never really understood how handhelds work & simply crammed as much power into the smallest casing it could find.\n\nWhen the original PSP was launched almost everyone in gaming said the UMDs (game disks) were a bad idea because of the amount of battery power they use - the only ones that didn't realise this was Sony & no one wanted to watch movies on that tiny screen when tablets were a thing meant there was no upside the UMD.\n\nThe Vita mostly died for two reasons, the software (from a Western perspective) and the memory cards. Sony was absolutely HAMMERED by piracy on the PSP and must have taken a huge hit on profits due to pretty much free game sharing in the PSP community.. Sony didn't make money on the console itself. Therefore when the PS Vita was being designed they decided to \"price out\" the piracy by introducing proprietary storage & charging a HUGE amount for it.\n\nFinally, Sony never really got handheld gaming - a lot was made of playing CoD on the go... but who would actually want to play a full CoD match on a shaky train, with a poor connection & then quit the match at their stop? Sony never really understood how to make games specifically for the handheld market. This ALSO explains why the Vita did so well in Japan - RPGs have pretty much always worked on the go.\n\nSo in summary, the PSP & Vita were technical marvels but not designed well for the job they had to do. It's a shame that Nintendo loses a competitor for the handheld market... but did Sony ever really compete against Nintendo in that market?\n\nPersonally, I want to see a NeoGeo Pocket Ultimate.. NeoGeo Pocket Color quality controls with Sony power?\n\n76\n\nDarthFoxMcCloud\n\nI liked the Vita, it had a few great games that I truly loved. But for me, a lot of those happened early in the console's life (Uncharted and Gravity Rush come to mind). Over the years, I played it less and less and when I did use it, it was a portable Netflix player (but then I got an iPad Pro which had a way better screen and built-in speaker than the Vita). Eventually I just traded it in for a Nintendo Switch. I really think part of the issue was really expensive proprietary memory cards, that turned a lot of people off the Vita. And of course, not a large variety of genres arrived in the West for Vita. It was a system that had great potential but Sony just never seemed to give it the care it deserved, in the West at least. But I'm loving the concept of Nintendo Switch, being a hybrid system. In the age of smartphones, I think Nintendo has the best way forward in the handheld arena.\n\n77\n\nTheFrenchiestFry\n\nI`m probably in the minority here, but I am pretty bummed about Sony stepping away from the handheld market.\n\nAs someone who owned a DS, PSP, 3DS and Vita, I really came to appreciate the Sony handhelds for their attempt at pushing out more mature and engrossing experiences, particularly from the Sony first party titles, in contrast with the more casual experiences from the Nintendo handhelds.\n\nThat being said, the Vita has been on Death`s doorstep since long before the Switch`s announcement. It was mostly just a lack of support from Sony and major third-parties, that led to its demise.\n\nI`ll always prefer the 3DS and Switch over the Vita, but I liked that system so much that, it really stinks that Sony isn`t willing to try again, but I totally understand why.\n\n78\n\nDarthFoxMcCloud\n\n@Spectra Nintendo Switch is quickly taking the Vita's place as THE console for JRPGs anyway.\n\n79\n\nNemodius\n\nPlus, even though Nintendo was not the first to make a portable that could out to a tv, China's been making those since the NES days usually found at flea markets, and of course Sony PSP 3000 was the first purposeful tv-out upgrade, but Nintendo just perfected the hybrid and they've pretty much done it so no company can make a better hybrid (portables are dead now, its hybrids or nothing), Nintendo just monopolized the portable gaming system market and still remains a major competitor with consoles all in one neat little package, my worry is, will Nintendo be able to make a new hybrid 10+/- years from now, or just upgrades like the numerous ones that the DS/3DS had? will the next gen hybrid bring enough to the table to be considered a separate system ??? with power getting better and smaller, there will be no need for a base console anymore, the next one will be a hybrid, but will it be \"The New Nintendo\" or \"The New Nintendo Switch\" ???\n\n80\n\nTheFrenchiestFry\n\n@Ristar24 Capcom support was pretty solid on Vita. I was surprised that Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was a Vita launch title, and yet it`s still one of the best looking games on the system, that game and the Vita version of Street Fighter X Tekken, which I spent so many hours on\n\n81\n\nZequio\n\nIts not about competing with Nintendo now, its competing with smartphones too.\n\n82\n\nTheFrenchiestFry\n\n@DarthFoxMcCloud It`s not completely overshadowing the Vita`s JRPG lineup until it gets a Persona game... IT NEEDS AT LEAST P4G\n\nSMT is cool. I always preferred Persona though\n\n83\n\nJokerwolf\n\n@kopaka I hacked my PS4, you get way more millage out if it that way, Switch on the other hand I would not hack just yet until I get a second one.\n\n84\n\nHeavyarms55\n\nHandheld gaming is on its way out. Technology is improving to the point that having a dedicated handheld gaming device isn't really needed anymore. Nintendo Switch has proven that. Yes the Switch isn't as powerful as a dedicated home console right now, but you have to admit, it really comes close. Especially in terms of functionality, if not raw power. And game companies are starting to see diminishing returns constantly trying to push graphics and resolution to the max, more and more cost and effort, for less and less actual improvement.\n\nI think we are going to reach a tipping point, sometime in the next 5-10 years, where dedicated gaming devices are actually going to follow in Nintendo's footsteps. We're going to have hybrid devices become the norm. Right now, Nintendo is pushing it with the Switch, it's just strong enough. But with the way computer tech is improving and shrinking, largely thanks to the smartphone industry, I don't think we are that far off from having Nintendo's innovation start... let's say \"inspiring\" the rest of the industry.\n\nAnd look out if Apple decides to release a gaming iPad/iPhone. Or if a company like Apple or Samsung were to partner up with Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo and release a device like that. As much as I dislike the mobile gaming scene, a proper gaming tablet or phone,(not a Chinese emulator machine with Windows 10 shoved on it or a weird, laggy Chinese piracy drone) done right, and supporting TV functionality like the Switch, could be an industry changer.\n\n85\n\nSinton\n\nCalling it now: PS5 will be a more powerful hybrid console.\n\n86\n\nRalizah\n\nUnsurprising, considering how hard and how quickly Sony dropped support for the Vita. It's a beautiful piece of tech that's more well-constructed than any of my recent Nintendo portables and introduced me to some of my all-time favorite games (Rondo of Blood, Danganronpa 2 and V3, Corpse Party, Gravity Rush, etc.), but it doesn't really have a lot of life left in it.\n\n87\n\ndougphisig\n\nLet's be honest the PSP would have been better if not for the UMD system, but the Vita was pretty good however they had the issue with only using their memory cards. However I still liked both systems. Sony never game them enough love though, also I wish I could have gotten the remote play to work with my PS4 which was one of the main reasons I bought a vita, however no regrets it's got lots of good rpg's and stuff.\n\n88\n\nMando44646\n\n@Medic_alert Sony is no longer producing new Vitas for Japan as of this month either. I just wish that Vita RPGs like Persona 4 and Trails Of would come to Switch\n\n89\n\ntameshiyaku\n\nThe Vita is a fantastic little device. People have just deemed it dead for years because it didn't get tripple A releases, but it is releasing countless great games for on the go until this day. I find it more practical on the go than my switch (which I love dearly as well).\n\nEven if Sony were to do a hybrid console, nintenderds shouldn't flatter themselves for doing it first. Sega was way ahead of the game with the Nomad.\n\nMan, I wish Nintendo was software only just like Sega.\n\n90\n\nthenikdavies\n\nEven with my smaller hands, I found playing the Vita unbearable. I enjoyed Tearaway and LittleBigPlanet and that was it. It was a waste of money\n\n91\n\nAnti-Matter\n\n@misterMike @geordie\n\n3 Reasons why i choose NDS & 3DS than PSP & PS Vita :\n\n1. Both NDS & 3DS have TONS of Cute , Girlie & Kiddie games, just like i want. There are Cooking Mama, Nintendogs, Animal Crossing New Leaf, Akogare Collections, Paper Mario Sticker Star, Tomodachi Life, Miitopia, Pokemon, Fantasy Life, Hamtaro, etc.\n\n2. NDS & 3DS have Backward compatibility with previous machine (With NDS Lite i can play GBA games & with 3DS i can play NDS games also.\n\n3. NDS & 3DS Save data on its cartridge. Very handy.\n\n92\n\nKoopaTheGamer\n\nThat sort of sucks. I never owned PSP or Vita, but I think competition is beneficial for the industry.\n\n93\n\nAgramonte\n\nJust put Ray Tracing and DPS on the PS5. And we will call it even.\n\n94\n\nIBeAGamer\n\nTwo great handhelds and I loved every moment with them.\n\n95\n\nveeflames\n\nAw man, so no Sony Swap? As I grow older and have responsibilities laid upon me, I have less time to sit in front of the TV playing console games. I was genuinely hoping that, for their next handheld, Sony walks along the path Nintendo's taken and produce an Switch-like handheld.\n\nOh well. I still want a Vita, if only for collection purposes.\n\n96\n\nJaxonH\n\nI could see Sony conceding the handheld market to Nintendo to give Nintendo a safe space in which to operate.\n\nBecause with the resurgence of 3rd party support even on Switch, if they Nintendo were to lose ground in the handheld market and then, in response make a power console the following generation, it could be a very serious threat.\n\nBest to back off and let Nintendo have a less competing space in which to operate\n\n97\n\nHughesy\n\nIf Sony actually backed the Vita it could have been amazing. When it came out it was an amazing bit of kit for a handheld. If Sony ever did create another one I won't be buying it, I loved the Vita but Sony just abandoned it so fast I don't trust them.\n\n98\n\nJoeDiddley\n\n@hippoeater I meant burned more by their standards and expectations rather than mine - as a happy PSP owner\n\n99\n\nDanteSolablood\n\n@OberonPrime I disagree to a certain degree in regards to the UMDs, while we can both agree to load time & battery drain Sony definitely stopped releasing movies onto UMD very early into the life of the PSP - partially for price consideration (the UMD format generally meant movies cost more than equivalent DVDs) and partially due to lack of interest. DVDs were cheap, tablets were exploding.\n\nAs for mMemsticks, not only have Sony insiders confirmed that they were using their proprietary memory due to hacking & piracy..\n\n\"Sony was concerned with security. The PSP was plagued by firmware hacks, and Sony's goal may be to prevent the Vita from succumbing to the same fate by keeping its memory on a new proprietary format.\" - Muneki Shimada, Sony Division 2 Software Head\n\n..but it was also understandable, Sony tends to sell it's hardware at a loss & makes it's profit back from hardware. Resistence:Retribution was available for free on BitTorrent on the same day it launched. Yes, piracy may have shifted more hardware but Sony that's not where they made their money.\n\nI agree that CoD was a bad example, but it was the game which was hyped up the most & one of the biggest selling points from people I spoke to at the time. Indeed Sony did bring some amazing games to the Vita, but how many of them were tailored to the handheld market rather than being ports of current games?\n\nI 100% agree with you on the marketing though, Sony could have done better with the Vita and dropped it's support too early, though where I disagree is that I don't believe it was ever likely to compete with the 3DS. Yes, the Vita was a good piece of hardware BUT out of all the things it could do it didn't do anything the PS3 didn't and never gave the Sony fanbase many reasons to buy a second copy of a game they were likely to play at home. 3DS games were VERY different to the gamecube/Wii offerings and were UNIQUE handheld fun. PS Vita offered PS3 (PS2.5) on the go.\n\nMy personal story is that I picked up the PSP at launch as I am a huge handheld fan & bought everything from the Gameboy, NeoGeo Pocket Color to the Wonderswan & Game Gear.. and enjoyed my time with the PSP. When the PS Vita was announced, I was not excited as it didn't seem they'd really learned anything about the handheld market. I'm only sorry I was correct as I WANTED Sony to succeed.\n\n100\n\nDarthFoxMcCloud\n\n@The_Pixel_King I know it's a separate purchase, but the Pro Controller has an incredible D-Pad. Since I mostly play in docked mode anyway though, the Pro Controller is great. That said, Hori and a few other third party manufacturers have made either Joy Con with D-pads or cheaper knockoff Pro Controllers for the Switch. There's also the Nintendo Switch Online NES controllers (although they're only good for the NES games, and you're likely better off getting a 3rd party Bluetooth one anyway).\n\n101\n\nNEStalgia\n\nNot at all surprising. Sony has never really met with success in the arena, and what success they had has proven to be a distraction that, like Nintendo, neither company can successfully juggle handling the two platforms acceptably at once, with one always taking a back seat to the other. Nintendo solved that by merging their \"behind the times\" home consoles with their handhelds into one Swiss Army console. That's not a viable option for Sony that pushes power over all else. This wasn't going to end any other way.\n\nRIP Vita. Switch is the handheld you wanted to be.\n\nEveryone needs to keep in mind though, Ubisoft, 2k, EA, Microsoft are all throwing their hats hard into the streaming arena, so \"handheld\" for them is going to be pushed as \"console quality games on your phone, tablet, or laptop.\" Whether or not it works in most of North America, is a different question.\n\nMeanwhile Sony's backing away from Gaikai/PS Now and making it available as a download library (except PS3).....their faith in their own streaming seems to be waning.\n\n@OberonPrime Switch didn't kill Vita, 3DS did. More specifically, Nintendo's synonymous association with \"handheld\" and the volume of key games on 3DS early on made it the obvious handheld seller. Dismayed at sales, Sony, internally turned to their shiny new PS4 launch and at that point abandoned almost any and all push on Vita, painting it as a dead, abandoned experiment doomed to live as a PS4 accessory to make it a me too WiiU. Then when WiiU failed they abandoned that pretense as well. And so went Vita. And instead of trying to really reboot that business they went onto their next #trending pet project in PSVR, always signaling they didn't care much about Vita support since 2013. Meanwhile 3DS was marketed, sold, and seen everywhere with more must-have titles than even PS4 for the first year of PS4's life.\n\nBasically, 3DS surged, Sony panicked, and lost their own messaging and faith in the Vita, moved on to PS4, and never really bothered looking back once they saw success there. And after 2 failed PS portables, and Switch dominating that market already, launching a new one would be a pretty expensive sidetrack as they get set to launch a replacement of their core success.\n\n102\n\nFrenean\n\n@kopaka\n\nNah, I don't \"NEED\" to buy a PlayStation console, I have Steam.\n\nSucks that they're quitting the handheld market, I know there are people who liked the Vita but that thing was dead years ago. Honestly with Nintendo dominating the handheld/hybrid space and Steam being the biggest home platform, I don't know how much longer traditional, underpowered consoles are going to stick around.\n\n103\n\nRiver3636\n\nPoor Vita I liked you and still will. Maybe I can mod it. .\n\n104\n\nDeadlyblack\n\nPSP and Vita were fun devices.\n\nIf the console market is going strong for Sony, why dabble in the handheld market. Microsoft wants nothing to do with it either.\n\nNintendo not getting any competition in the handheld market isn't going to be good going forward. You know, competition breeds innovation.\n\n105\n\nArkay\n\n@Anti-Matter cute and girly games? Tends to have shirtless chibi men as a profile pic?\n\nWhy don't you have a seat over here..\n\n106\n\nFrenean\n\n@Deadlyblack\n\nNintendo hasn't really ever had competition in the handheld market though, and they have been doing just fine. Sony's portables never came close as far as sales.\n\n107\n\nArcamenel\n\nPeople talking about lack of competition as if Nintendo still doesn't have to compete with Mobile phone gaming.\n\n108\n\nRazzy\n\nThat's a shame. Even though my first two handhelds were the gbc and gba, I then went for PSP2000 and never regretted it. The games it had were astounding compared to the DS. Heck, even 3Ds games only beat PSP games in terms of graphics sometimes due to real shaders, PSP is still better at complex geometry.\n\nI dunno, over half the sales of a cheaper handheld from the many years long of handhelds for a new player in the handheld domain seems like a success to me.\n\nThe Vita was even better, but, sadly, the support dropped pretty fast. The horribly expensive memory didn't help. Though, nowadays, with a hacked vita and an SD adapter, that's not really a problem.\n\nThough, I find it funny that the Vita still got an exclusive (at least until the HD) edition AC game, and the PAP got exclusive AC and GTA games, plus even the DS's exclusive GTA game, while the Switch didn't get any such stuff.\n\nLoss of competition will only hurt the industry. I mean, nVidia has no competition in the top performance market and just look at the prices of their newest graphics cards.\n\n@NEStalgia You mean like the Wii U was a me too PS3/PSP combo, amirite?\n\nCya\n\nRaziel-chan\n\n109\n\nRyu_Niiyama\n\nNo offense but they said no plans before they announced the vita. I'll wait till 2019 and see what they do. I will say if their next handheld isnt essentially a hybrid I will likely pass this time... the vita is one of my smallest game libraries. If I was merely a handheld gamer it would have been fantastic but not enough unique games on its own and at the same time not enough console games from the ps3 either. And the forced touchscreen controls were worse imo than the Nintendo hardware forced ones. I think I felt about it the way most people did about the wiiu. It just didnt...click.\n\n110\n\nFrenean\n\n@Arcamenel\n\nThey don't, though. At least not for the attention of hardcore gamers. People that will shell out hundreds or more dollars on new games every year. The biggest reason why non-Nintendo fans buy Switches is because they don't want to have to deal with bad touch screen console on their tiny phones. Mobile games are made with the most basic, mindless player in mind. 90% of mobile RPGs have an auto battle feature so you don't even have to play the game. Other games just have you clicking on notifications most of the time and others are very simple puzzle games.\n\n111\n\nDanteSolablood\n\n@OberonPrime Thank you, I respect your opinions as well.\n\nWhile it's true that Sony eventually failed the prevent piracy on the Vita long term, from their point of view they wanted to do everything they could to slow it down... they could simply not afford to release the Vita & instantly lose ALL their profit from piracy. Was it a mistake? Almost certainly. But we can only look at the reality of what happened.\n\nAs for Sony offering more in regards to online, you are again absolutely correct, though I don't see this as a great innovation - they just wanted to cram as much into the Vita as possible to try and steal some headway from Nintendo. Unfortunately Sony were simply offering the same experience as the PS3 & the games were not different enough to provide a reason to buy them on top of the PS3.\n\nAnd yes, the Vita was/is probably light years ahead of Nintendo in regards to online - this is something that Nintendo has always struggled with. However, technically there is physical reason why the Switch can not provide voice chat & friends list. It's all up to Nintendo!\n\nPersonally, if Sony wants to go into hybrid console territory they either make the PS5 a 100% hybrid console or don't do it at all. One of the key failings of the PS Vita was not offering enough reasons for the Sony fanbase to buy a Vita AND PS3/PS4. If they released a PS Vita Plus & it's just a PS4 in a handheld shell.... who the heck would buy that instead of just getting a cheap second hand PS4?? It's not like Sony would open a studio to develop portable games (aka like Nintendo had).\n\n112\n\nDanteSolablood\n\n@Arcamenel That's not quite correct - Nintendo do have to compete with mobile gaming, but it's a different \"sector\" with very different factors. Usually people compare like-to-like competition.\n\nHowever, all consoles and PCs are having to compete with mobile games to a certain degree now. I know plenty of kids who spend more time on Pokémon Go & tablet games than they do on ANY console... that's potential money lost from Nintendo, Sony & Microsoft.\n\n113\n\nFrenean\n\n@Royalblues\n\nAnd Steam? The biggest platform in the world? It has high production games and a great online infrastructure as well.\n\n114\n\nNemodius\n\n@Sinton\n\nI have not seen anything that suggests the PS5 will be a hybrid portable console, even John Kodera said might/could but no \"would\", but he DID promise that nothing, no matter solid console or hybrid will be seen before 2021, so the Switch will have been well established for 4 years and Sony may end up looking like fools. so please explain how you seem so sure it will be a hybrid at all ???\n\n@Spectra\n\nok, you say Switch is not as good as dedicated handheld and you hope for another dedicated handheld...\n\nplease explain why the Switch is lacking as a handheld and if you were the big guy at Nintendo, what would you try and bring to the table for a new dedicated handheld (realistically) that would surpass the 3DS & make it unique and noteworthy enough to be considered a worthwhile investment\n\n115\n\nFrenean\n\n@Royalblues\n\nBlizzard's own service, but it's just another program to launch like Steam. It's fine if people don't play on PC, but I just find it funny when people compare consoles like there isn't a bigger dog in the house. If the PlayStation and Xbox had a cool gimmick like the Switch, I might actually be interested in one. The PS4 has Bloodborne which is one of my favorite games of the past decade, but I played that on my fiance's system and don't feel the need to buy one. From a PC gamer's perspective, the Switch actually has value for its portable play. Plus I've been a Nintendo fan since the SNES days. xD\n\n116\n\nRealnoize\n\nI personnally liked the Vita more than the 3DS. And I'd still say that, so far, the Vita had a lot more games I was interested in at the time, than the couple of games on the Switch that interests me right now. People can be fanboys all they want (and this being a Nintendo-oriented site, I assume many here are), but the reason Sony failed with the Vita is that they built it like we were still in 2004.\n\nSony failed to acknowledge the rise of mobile gaming. And while Nintendo said they also felt the mobile gaming impact, the fact that their 3DS line was marketed in a general \"family-friendly\" way, made them the default go-to solution for parents wanting to buy a portable system for their kids. Sony always wanted to market themselves as more \"serious, mature and edgy (whatever that means)\" which means it was aiming at an oder, more traditional console gaming market (case in point, the Vita was marketed as being more like a \"home console but playable on the go\").\n\nProblem was, nowadays, that this crowd already have a device they bring with them all the time that can play games - their mobile phone - and while being more of the casual type of games, it is ok for many that don't feel the need anymore to bring along yet another device in addition to the one in their pockets already. Many didn't buy the Vita because they didn't see a reason to pay that much, for something that won't bring them a lot more over what they have already.\n\nIn the original, pre-3DS and pre-Vita days, a portable console to play games on the go was like \"wow, that's cool\". Now, gaming on the go is pretty common. Even our parents are doing it now.\n\nAnd so, where Sony failed, is that without the \"family-friendly\" free pass that Nintendo is getting, they had to offer a reason for people to care about the Vita. And this is where they failed miserably.\n\nWay, way overpriced, almost mandatory memory cards (Sony wanted everything to be proprietary - more cash to them through licences - and to limit piracy)\n\nMedia functionalities were laughable.\n\nThe trend to send AAA franchise development to third-grade studios with low experience or hideous track record.\n\nMany good games, but no \"killer app\" to speak of (see above point for a possible reason why)\n\nSony relegating the platform to a \"legacy platform\" about less than two years after launch.\n\nNo flexibility. Instead of offering a dock with TV out, they launch a completely different TV box device made to play some Vita games only and stream PS4 games. And still, with laughable media playing integration.\n\nThe whole Vita saga is almost a story on what not to do.\n\nIt is sad, because the Vita was, hardware-wise, awesome.\n\nAnd Sony exiting the game only means less competition, and that is NEVER a good thing, as companies tend to stall innovation when there is no competitor out there.\n\n117\n\nTyranexx\n\nI've never owned any of Sony's handheld systems, but I've heard decent things about the PSP. I was considering getting a Vita at one point, but there wasn't quite enough there for my interests. I think the Vita could have done better if a few things had been handled differently.\n\nI've known about this news for awhile, but it's still sad. I've always liked that there was an alternative to the 3/DS family. Unfortunately with the rise of mobile gaming, that space is harder to manage than ever.\n\n118\n\nFrenean\n\n@Realnoize\n\nThe Vita was very cool hardware-wise, but the overpriced memory cards are why I never bought one. That, and aside from a few pretty cool Sony exclusives like that Uncharted game and Tearaway, there wasn't much that enticed me. I'm really picky on JRPGs and have only completed like seven in my life not counting Pokemon games, so it didn't really have much going for me personally. Sony has no-one to blame for the Vita's failure but themselves tbh\n\n119\n\nJJ286\n\nThey won't be miss.\n\n120\n\nNEStalgia\n\n@Razzy WiiU was an attempt at putting the DS in the living room space, it had nothing really in common with PSP+PS3. If anything MH3 tried to emulate that with WiiU + 3DS, which makes sense since MH had just come from PSP.\n\nBack when WiiU came out, following Wii, both Sony and MS were hedging hard against it being a runaway success. Sony did the \"With a $200 PSV addon it's just like a WiiU\" and MS did the \"With XBone and Smart Glass on a Surface RT, it's just like WiiU!\" thing. Then WiiU crashed and burned and they all stopped talking about it.\n\n121\n\nKai_\n\n@Medic_alert I am absolutely desperate for them to port Persona 4, to anything current really but Switch would be perfect.\n\n122\n\nFrenean\n\n@NEStalgia\n\nThat Xbox Smart Glass Minecraft demo was REALLY cool, I hope they still do something like that in the future. I loved my Wii U, played it mostly at my computer desk, virtual console games on my GamePad. That's why I can understand the Vita fans and the pain they feel, it sucked that the Wii U wasn't a success.\n\n123\n\nNemodius\n\n@Rayquaza2510 I guess you didn't read what I said, I didn't have a problem with the 3DS, not having those extra buttons, my reference for the R2 & L2 was that if the PSP 3000 or Vita had added those, it would have brought more to the table for fans of Sony, especially when porting PSX & PS2 games, otherwise even adding the TV-OUT though good idea, it was a poor execution, even if you had the 30' extention cord, it really wasn't that special, you were still tied, now Nintendo took care of that with the fully remote operation, so yah, the portable Sony is done\n\n124\n\nNEStalgia\n\n@Dalarrun I got the double-whammy. I bought 3DS day one and loved it, but was a super hyped Day 1 preorderer of Vita to get that \"console on the go\" experience. Fully expected it to kill my interest in 3DS. I even have the special edition launch bundle with the 3G and the custom hard case, lol!\n\nAaaand....then it fizzled into nothingness. So then WiiU came out and I was super hyped....an actual console with the screen like Vita...not on the go, but around the house it was the dream I'd waited for!\n\nAaand....then it fizzled into nothingness.\n\nThankfully the third time is the charm and the Switch actually does what both of those did and is not actually fizzling It's the consoles my last 3 consoles wished they were\n\n125\n\nbstie1198\n\nVita is my all time favorite gaming system, and my favorite library of games, as well. I consider PSP and PS1 Classics part of the library. Vita improved PSP games due to the extra control and visual options. PSP games look and play better on Vita thanks to the exactly 4x resolution over PSP, unlike DS games on 3DS. The proprietary memory sticks were a major design flaw, and I think a significant contributing factor to its commercial failure.\n\n126\n\nsdelfin\n\nI always liked Sony's hand-held hardware designs. It's a shame to see them pull out of the market, at least for now. I wouldn't be surprised if they were experimenting with a Switch competitor, but they're not in a good position to make that work due to having higher-end consoles. Lots of other people piled on Sony with criticism of the overpriced memory cards for the Vita, so I don't have to add to that. But I will because it was so incredibly stupid. Having a proprietary memory card is one thing, but to have them priced at such a ridiculous level was a massive deal breaker. I considered getting a Vita, but the situation with the memory cards never seemed to improve and so it was the main reason I never got the system. I believe the Vita also had a sealed battery which I do not appreciate in such a device, but that's another matter.\n\n127\n\nMordridakon\n\nThis article is timely because I'm currently on retro-buying spree with my PSP, building up a small collection of games.\n\nIts sad to see Sony leave, but they completely fumbled the VITA after the relative success of the PSP. Sure it never touched the DS, but it was a good system with lots of good games on it.\n\n128\n\nParasolStars\n\nTheir \"support\" for Vita has been token at best since about 2015. After the PSTV flopped in the west they all but gutted support of the portable outside of Japan and Asia. What you had left in NA and Europe was a small dedicated group of western publishers like NIS, Aksys, and Xseed localizing a handful of japanese titles for the west.\n\nAll this is them finally killing even PS Plus support for the system. More or less their final nail in the \"legacy\" platform coffin as they've called it the last few years. You can blame the grossly-overpriced proprietary memory cards, their stupid insistence of offering a 3G capable model of the handheld that you couldn't even play online over cellular networks with the subsequent data service needed to use it being too expensive to afford and not worth investing in, a medicore at best launch line-up, and the advent of tablets/smart phones amongst other things as to why the system flopped at retail.\n\nCredit to Nintendo with the 3DS though. They saw early sales of their system lagging in 2011 after about six months and aggressively dropped the price from $250 to $170 and it took off from there.\n\n129\n\necco6t9\n\nGood, Sony had little quality control on the handheld. Downloads would take hours and both systems I had crashed constantly.\n\n130\n\nNemodius\n\nFor those hopeful that the PS5 coming no sooner than 2021 (as stated by John Kodera of Sony) may possibly be a hybrid, the Nintendo Switch will have been well established for 4 years, so what (realistically) could be brought to the table by Sony to make it special and unique enough to be seen as a competing system and not just some attempt to ride on Nintendo's coat tails ???, now also consider, by 2021 Nintendo will 90% likely have a significant upgrade to the Switch, adding some things, so consider THAT when contemplating your answers\n\n131\n\nNEStalgia\n\n@Realnoize \"Sony relegating the platform to a \"legacy platform\" about less than two years after launch.\"\n\nThis is the big one. You're right about the lack of killer games, the low budget studios for \"AAA\" games, and all that. But the above, and the memory cards were above all else the real killers.\n\nMemory cards....imagine if Switch required Nintendo Memory that cost roughly double a microSD? And then made most games download-only? That brutalized it.\n\nBut the worst was the \"legacy\" status. They launched Vita in NA in Feb 2012. They killed Vita in NA February 2013 at the PS4 launch event. After how they treated that, and the following E3 it was clear they'd already abandoned Vita internally. It never felt the same from that point on. And from March 2014 on it really felt completely abandoned.\n\nWorse, they re-released a new model that took away what was it's most celebrated feature: The OLED display.\n\nVita makes WiiU look like a flying success of a product cycle. It was hard to blunder a console as badly as treating it as irrelevant a year after launch. Even WiiU at least tried to look relevant for 3 years.\n\n132\n\nFrenean\n\n@NEStalgia\n\nHeh, I'll drink to that! I adore my Switch and can't wait for Pokemon/Animal Crossing!\n\n133\n\nPhle\n\nHaving no competitors isn’t necessarily a good thing for Nintendo. I do agree that Nintendo’s handhelds usually comes out on top, but the proof, that existing other companies always fall behind, will be gone if Sony truly steps away from the handheld market. In a way, it’s a small loss for Nintendo.\n\n134\n\nNEStalgia\n\n@Phle Nintendo's had no competitors since early 3DS in the handheld space. Vita's really been dead in the water for years. Or more specifically Nintendo's had no dedicated handheld competitors. Mobile on one side and PSXBox on the other still are strong competition. Significantly more competitive than Vita ever was, at any rate.\n\n@sdelfin Switch has a \"non-replaceable battery\" as well, but it's only loosely true since it's only a few screws and a cable disconnect to get to it....if you can find a (Chinese knock-off?) battery to replace it with.\n\n135\n\nThe_Pixel_King\n\n@DarthFoxMcCloud Hey buddy, I’ve heard nothing but good things about the Pro Controller. Only thing is, the vast majority of my Switch gaming is in handheld mode. I’ve watched a ton of YouTube vids about the DIY JoyCon / D-pad conversions that you mentioned. I think they look great.\n\nIn truth though, the regular direction buttons work just fine. I’m just old and grumpy and stuck in my pixelated 2D ways! 😉\n\n136\n\nBenRK\n\nIt's a shame, but not unexpected. I enjoyed my Vita when I had it. Was even considering picking up a used one had they not announced all the Final Fantasies coming to the Switch. There is no real reason for me to go back to it sadly. Oh well.\n\n137\n\nfadedcolors\n\n@Anti-Matter\n\nDamn dude your comment reminded me of 2008 era fanboys\n\n138\n\nNemodius\n\n@NEStalgia @sdelfin\n\nsince when has \"non-replaceable\" batteries ever been an issue ??? not only will Nintendo have to replace them in OEM repair services, iphones have had those for decades, yet you still see phone repair shops that get 75%+ of their business from battery replacement, so I'd never be concerned about that as a deciding factor for anything\n\n139\n\nNEStalgia\n\n@jhewitt3476 Yeah it depends on the device. It's still a big issue (hang out around Samsung phone forums some time That said every single Samsung phone battery (replaceable) I've ever had has swollen to the point of bowing the screen out of the frame. Not an ideal situation if you can't just yank it.)\n\nBut yeah, OEM repairs are a joke, by the time you're done with shipping and \"3-12 weeks\" for repair, it's best to buy a new one and bin the old one. But the screen repair shops, that do batteries, yeah, that feels like the old TV repair shops....that's a good bet where it holds up. I remain hopeful with my Surface, Switch, and such that those shops will come in handy. The trick is actually getting available batteries. iPhones are available (knock-offs). Big Surface batteries are a lot harder to actually locate, and who knows about Switch so far. Now that it's popular that might get a lot easier (Vita OTOH........)\n\n140\n\nAnti-Matter\n\n@fadedcolors\n\nWhat ??\n\nDid you even read My 3 Reasons i choose NDS & 3DS ?\n\nIt's All about the GAMES i'm looking for.\n\nPS Vita DIDN'T even HAVE any Cute games like Wan Nyan Pet Shop , Nintendogs, Animal Crossing New Leaf, Yokai Watch, Fantasy Life, Tomodachi Life, Miitopia, etc.\n\nWhen i saw the full list of rated E & E10+ of PS Vita games, i found NO Games i want to buy. Just NOTHING to buy.\n\nSo, why should i care with ps vita that gave me NOTHING while NDS gave me MORE than 40 games & 3DS gave me MORE than 50 games ?\n\n90+ games of NDS & 3DS that can be played on New 3DS XL for me it's a HEAVENLY Handheld ever. And there is a White New 3DS XL also, Mmmmuaaah !!\n\nA Blow kiss from me to Nintendo DS & 3DS.\n\n141\n\nRadicalThe_Tay\n\nThat’s too bad. If they hadn’t stuck with insanely overpriced proprietary SD cards and had invested in speeding up PS store downloads it could have competed better with Nintendo.\n\n142\n\nYeshaYahu5417\n\nPR swerve possibly. But what better device can Sony come up with than current mobile devices including Switch that isn't copied by them? I say swerve possibly because wasn't Yoshida or some high Sony rep at the Switch reveal taking a whole lot of photos of the device up close?\n\n143\n\nRealnoize\n\n@Dalarrun\n\nI agree. Sony can only blame themselves. But I'm still bummed out that they're not even trying anymore. Even just for the sake of having some competition in the market.\n\nIt wouldn't be too hard to develop a product that would be interesting. While the Switch is a move in the right direction, I'm still thinking that the concept could be improved a lot more. Just picture a phone-sized device with a slide-out gamepad (similar to what the Xperia Play had, but better), running a custom version of Android with a dedicated PlayStation game marketplace (secured), that can be used like a regular phone as well.\n\nThe idea nowadays, and part of the reason that the Switch was so successful, is that combining home console and portable console is seen by people as being smart and practical. Everyone can clearly see the advantages of such a setup. Now Sony would just need to find a similar idea, one that people would think makes sense. And to me, having a single device that acts as my mobile phone AND a dedicated portable console would be an idea I'd be all over. I mean, bring just one device instead of two. And even if the gaming side of it ends up not supported anymore in the future (because Sony is pretty good at quickly dropping support of less performing products), if the device in itself is a solid, quality one, it will still function as a nice phone.\n\nThere ARE possibilities Sony could explore. Problem is, they may lack the imagination to do so properly.\n\nSad.\n\n144\n\nNemodius\n\n@Anti-Matter I completely understand where you are coming from, like me, it's 80% about the games, and on ALMOST every system I've owned, I purposefully wait 18-24 months after the system comes out to see about the number of games I might want, I made a mistake with the PS2, it never (for me) put out enough games, I paid more for the system than the total number of games for it and spent 90% of my time playing my older PSX games on it, but within 6 months, the Switch had so many games I knew I wanted, I went out and got it and 3 games on day 1, I now have 16 & plan to add another 7 in the next 5-6 months, so i am most certainly not disappointed by this system nor do I forsee becoming so\n\n145\n\nMuddy_4_Ever\n\n@Zuljaras Well said. I like great games. Nintendo does a lot of them, so I've tended to buy more of their stuff. But (get this!) there are also great games on other systems! If I get the opportunity to enjoy those, too, that's wonderful. Being so myopic that one says otherwise borders on creepy.\n\n146\n\nRealnoize\n\n@YeshaYahu5417\n\nThere are lots of better devices they can come up with. While the Switch is very good, to say it's perfect would be simple fanboyism. We can always improve on something.\n\nJust think of the stuff that people bring with themselves all the time. Everyone I see have their mobile phone already, that can play some games. Aside from that, some people bring with them a tablet as well. I see a lot of those in the commute everyday. I do bring mine too. But then, if I'd want to do some more \"serious\" gaming on the go, I also bring my Switch in my backpack. That's THREE devices right there.\n\nThe Switch is great because it merges toghether the concepts of home console and portable console. You buy one and you have both. It's practical. It's smart.\n\nNow what if someone puts out a good mobile phone with a slideout physical gamepad? What about if that phone runs on Android so you already get access to tons of apps you already use, but also have a dedicated marketplace of \"console games\" to play on the go? This would mean gamers like me could buy ONE device, and only bring one with me instead of two. I'd have my portable console with me at all times, as I have my phone with me at all times.\n\nWe just need to think things further.\n\nReleasing a new dedicated gaming portable today (that doesn't do anything else) wouldn't be smart. But combine that with something else to reduce the number of devices people have to bring with them, and you may be onto something. No?\n\n147\n\nNEStalgia\n\n@YeshaYahu5417 It was Yoshida. But it's a hard point. The Joycons could no doubt be copied in some patent avoiding way, the internals of the system are nVidia, and Sony trying to copy nVidia work directly just isn't going to go anywhere, and there's really no alternative vendor other than maybe Qualcomm, but they exist for the sole purpose of price gouging on behalf of CDMA carriers (and Samsung is their OEM which doesn't come cheap.) Now that Switch is becoming it's own icon any attempt to copy it would look as blatant as copying a DS. I daresay they missed the boat on that. Not that they care, they own console right now. They'll only care if that falters (and in a new gen, anything is possible.)\n\n148\n\nRect_Pola\n\nI can see why, but considering Nintendo is abandoning the values that handhelds used to harbor (less power, but cheaper to buy and develop for), I would've figured there was still a viable market to be exploited. I know plenty (including Nintendo) feel the Switch covers that void, but as a handheld it is the most delicate thing they have ever created.\n\nIf I had a Switch back when I had my gameboy it would've been dead within a year. Nevermind the cost makes \"each person has their own\" prohibitive.\n\n149\n\nsdelfin\n\n@NEStalgia I expected Switch would have a non-replaceable battery, but, after seeing the teardown of the system, I give them credit for making the internals accessible and fairly modular.\n\n@jhewitt3476 since when has that been an issue? It has always been an issue. And iphones haven't existed for decades. I've always criticized Apple for doing that and hated seeing the Android manufacturers go in that direction over the last several years. It may not be an issue for you or many others, but it is for me and for some people. Sealed batteries were not common until Apple made it popular and profitable. Now, many laptop computers are designed that way which seems quite silly to me. It's a trend I've never liked. You're free to not care about it, but it is an issue for some people. However, for portable game systems, it is better for the battery to be easily accessible since the devices can see use for years and are not meant to be as disposable as cell phones which have a much faster upgrade cycle.\n\n150\n\nNemodius\n\n@Muddy_4_Ever I don't really think having a specific set of preferences and going with a company who best suits your needs is \"myopic\", it's practical, there are some games that I like on other systems that aren't or won't be coming to my current systems (3DS, Wii, Switch), but at the same time, especially with the exorbitant prices of even last gen PS3 & 360, I can't afford to buy those systems just for 3-5 games, Nintendo has always provided a larger variety of the games I like, so I have almost always stuck with them, not out of loyalty or \"myopia\", but because my wallet can't take buying three of the same types of consoles, 1 main and 1-2 others so I can play 3-5 extra games.\n\nI have 3 Nintendo systems, but they are different, Wii, 3DS & Switch, so I felt legitimate in my owning them, but even then, it took me years to acquire each system individually, I didn't just go out and buy 1 every year or two\n\n151\n\nNEStalgia\n\n@Realnoize Trouble is Sony is garbage in the phone industry overall, even Vita's a success next to their phone division. And Xperia wasn't so successful. Cant' blame them for not trying that. (Plus the mobile hardware is either obscenely expensive, or obscenely underpowered next to Tegra...and Tegra needs air cooling which won't work on a phone.\n\nOther problem is size. Switch, honestly is really pushing below the real required screen size for running HD console content on a small screen. Text is often far too small, UI elements meant for large TVs are really questionable on many games on a 6.3\" screen. Cramming that onto a smaller screen might make most games totally unusable. Mobile game UIs are tailored and simple for small screens.\n\nIf anything Switch needs to get bigger, not smaller. But there's not much room for that beyond eating the bezel.\n\nBut remember, everyone's going to focus on streaming services for console gaming on phones. Every time Ubi/MS/EA says streaming they show a phone. I bet your carrier data plan's body is ready?\n\n152\n\nNemodius\n\n@NEStalgia too many people misunderstand what the patent really does, a person/company a specific and unique design, circuit, case, locking mechanism, ect., but they cannot patent a function, so a pair of removable, wireless remote controls are perfectly doable so long as the exact design of a thing is not copied, good example...\n\n3rd party tv docks and dongles for the Switch, they are usually very different, but have the exact same function, and Nintendo can't do Jack Squat about it, same with copyrights, you can copyright characters and unique aspects of a story, but an empire trying to take over a galaxy, led by a cyborg that weilds a lazer sword and uses magic or telepathy/telekinetics even finding out the unlikely hero is the relative of the villain cannot be copyrighted, that's how it goes\n\n153\n\nRealnoize\n\n@NEStalgia\n\nI think Sony as a whole, has a problem in the way they tackle their hardware. If what they launch is a huge success, they'll support it no problem, but if something is getting lower sales than anticipated in the FIRST quarter after its release, they're axing it.\n\nRemember the PSP Go? Sony announced it stop supporting it a year an a half after release. Remember the Eye Toy and the whole 2 to 3 games that were made for it? Remember the PS Eye camera? Remember PS Move? God that flopped so hard that Sony is now trying to recycle the old tech in its PSVR. The Vita, Sony dropped it (unnoficially) about a year and a half after launch. And now, PSVR is barely present anymore in retail stores, with many companies saying they're not investing in VR anymore (what we see now are VR games that were started two or more years ago and released now). I expect Sony to announce its dropping the PSVR platform sometimes in 2019 to focus on other things.\n\nSony is pretty good to quickly abandon anything it did as soon as it doesn't get the success it wanted.\n\n154\n\nNemodius\n\n@Spectra well, true, the \"hybrid\"designation was not Nintendo's original idda to call it, but was their obvious intention\n\nas for continued support for the 3DS, they put out the \"New 3DS only a few years ago and how would you feel if a company made you something then just gave up on it after a short bit....oh wait, Sony did that with the Vita !!! !!! BURN !!! !!!\n\nno, it's good for business that they keep their current customers happy by keeping them in the loop until they can afford to change over if they want, it's called customer loyalty\n\n155\n\nBraneman\n\nThey'll go out by dumping a five gallon bucket filled to the brim with microsd cards into an incinerator. They do this regularly with an ice cream bucket, but this is supposed to be a celebration. You wouldn't believe the applause from the hardware department when those cards go up in flame.\n\nAfterwards they bring out the knives and make a blood vow to never make good decisions about handhelds anymore. It's a popular tourist attraction to see the yearly Sony of Japan handheld games meeting. But I heard that the hardware department wasn't allowed to attend this time, people thought they'd get too rowdy.\n\n156\n\nburninmylight\n\n@Razer Your arguments for 4K televisions and the Switch are the exact same ones I heard a dozen years ago with the Wii and HDTVs. Yet, the Wii sold like gangbusters for years after launch, outselling the HD twins week after week for quite some time.\n\nSwitch is outselling PS4 and XB1 week after week, and is reaching software sales parity with multiplatform titles it shares with X1. You know a few people in your personal life who are more well informed tech enthusiasts. Good. Anecdotal evidence doesn’t trump sales data and facts though. Most consumers don’t give a crap about graphics and buzzwords they don’t understand and care to learn. They care about games and zeitgeist, and that has never stopped being true in the entertainment industry.\n\n157\n\nNEStalgia\n\n@jhewitt3476 In theory. In reality Apple won their suit against Samsung for developing a rectangular communications device with a screen. Because their patent was accepted while being sufficiently broad to cover basically anything that could be a similar device.\n\n@Realnoize Yeah, and it's not just their gaming hardware, but Sony hardware across the board. Unless it pushes a media format in which case they'll keep making it decades after nobody has bought it (cough Minidisc)\n\nAt least PS Move lives on for PSVR. They repurposed their Wii clone successfully there My favorite is that book AR thing they had that you see yourself inside the story. That died fast.\n\nVR was always going to be a fad, and I argued with so many people here that insisted it was here to stay! They did a huge PSVR push last Black Friday, and it looked like it was finally going to take off. To be fair, PSVR actually is really cool as affordable VR, and I wouldn't be too surprised if they renew focus on that on PS5 with a new model. VR itself is still doing well in the high end (Occulus, Vive) so if Sony can close the gap from the dismal resolution of current VR, they'd be in better shape for it, but it does look like the \"this time it's for realsies!\" hype in the industry has waned yet again (Remember when investors asked Nintendo non-stop when they were going to get into VR and finally join the trend? Lol.)\n\nBut yeah, Sony seems bent on one-hit-wonder every time. I guess it's not hurting them for now. But only because Nintendo and MS screwed up so badly in 2013.\n\n158\n\ntseliot\n\n@Liam_Doolan Sony had a handheld?\n\n159\n\nRazzy\n\n@NEStalgia I disagree. If anything, the ps4/vita combo was a further development of the ps3/psp combo. It didn't really copy any of the wiiu pad's features, it was still mostly for remote play. I wish people would stop forcing this narrative where every single thing Sony does is a ripoff of what Nintendo does.\n\nCya\n\nRaziel-chan\n\n160\n\nSuperWeird\n\nGood. The Vita sucked. I owned both versions. Won't be missed.\n\n161\n\nNemodius\n\n@Spectra Nintendo killed the dedicated handheld with the release of the Switch, it's compact, powerful, portable....if they attempted to make another dedicated handheld, people would ask \"why ???\", what's the point ???, what can Nintendo add that would make it a viable alternative to their Switch ??? they did the 3D thing, it is cool, but most people play their systems with it turned off anyway for various reasons, it's a nifty, but not even a huge thing, the 3DS only sold 3/4 of what the DS did, so they won't add that to the next dedicated (if any), so again, I'm asking again of YOU, if you were to design a dedicated handheld, (REALISTICALLY) what would you do that would make it a viable alternative to the Switch, and not make people wonder \"what's the point of this ???\"\n\ndon't forget price, the Switch is ONLY $300, so you have to make people look at you and feel that any price (realistic) difference $200-$300 is worth passing up the Switch, adding one or maybe two things better be REALLY significant or people will just look at you stupid\n\ncustomer loyalty isn't always the same as providing customer demand, I agree with taking away the Virtual Console\n\n162\n\nNemodius\n\n@SuperWeird had Sony added the L2&R2, it could have made a killer emulator console, it was easy to hack, but most people who hacked it were just hoping to put their PSX & PS2 ISO's on it and play that way\n\n163\n\ndatamonkey\n\n\"Leaving It All To Nintendo\"\n\nAnd Apple/Android\n\n164\n\nNEStalgia\n\n@Razzy Your forgetting the original push by Sony and MS (Vita/Smart Glass) for \"second screen experiences\". They dropped that after WiiU tanked and then it became all about remote play/game streaming, but originally they were pushing the \"second screen experience\" like WiiU, as were 3rd party publishers such as Ubisoft. But it was a brief period of trying to preventatively copy Nintendo's booming Wii repeat success before they all realized that ship sailed.\n\n165\n\nekwcll\n\n@Razer remember Nintendo had powerful consoles, and people ignored it for the ps2, which had an inferior console, that's why Nintendo went their own way. Nintendo could always make a powerful console, if they wanted to.\n\n166\n\nNemodius\n\nnow out of fairness to those I've said \"WWYD?\" for the next gen portable, I will put my 2 cents in for some improvements...\n\nI've had every portable since the original Game Boy, as they came out, this system (Switch) is light, powerful enough for the games I like, resolution is great, the various everything I love about it, almost as if I designed it myself, but I would like to see a couple things added...\n\nTWO micro sd card slots: especially for those digital download fans out there, these games and their updates can get pretty ridiculous and NO ONE wants to swap out cards\n\nan individual web browser like Chrome, I have streaming media accounts like Netflix and I want to watch them, but not have to wait for Nintendo to lighten their demands on those individual companies so they can add an app, lucky Hulu fans, what about us Prime and Netflix fans ???\n\nmake some joycon strap button add-ons that had a rechargeable battery in each to extend the docked or table play life\n\na high res player facing video cam and microphone would be nice\n\nyah, that's really all I can think of\n\n167\n\nHaywired\n\n@Spectra\n\nThere wasn't really any recent talk of a 3DS successor though. It was more a misleading headline from NintendoLife. Someone asked them about the future of dedicated handhelds and they just said they were considering many possibilities, which is basically a nothing answer that could just as well mean there definitely won't be a new 3DS as there will be. Personally I think the next dedicated handheld will be a smaller, more portable Switch Lite of some sort (as a hardware revision is, as always, 100% coming at some point and I doubt it's going to be a larger model). It wouldn't make much sense for Nintendo to unify their home and handheld divisions only to just disunify them a couple of years later. They're trying to keep the 3DS alive as much as they can now and eek as many last sales as they can because why wouldn't they, but once the Switch Lite hits I think that will be the end of it. I mean, mainline Pokémon is now a Switch game. And the Switch is basically already the new handheld in Japan even without the smaller version. Plus, after the 3DS and Wii U, neither 3D nor dual screens are really worth pursuing at this point. Their Switch/Switch Lite and Mobile ecosystem should have everything covered.\n\n168\n\nRealnoize\n\n@ekwcll\n\nI think that Nintendo, on that aspect (making powerful consoles) is much smarter than Sony or Microsoft. Sony and Microsoft are not making a lot of profits (if any, some suggest they even lose money), on console sales, making most of their profits on game royalties, accessories, PS+ subs, and so on. Same with Microsoft.\n\nNintendo, from what I've heard, since the Wii days, tried to do things differently and make sure that they do profits from console sales right up front, so they depend a lot less on everything else to make a profit. I'm pretty sure the Wii U still made profits for them. A lot less than anticipated, sure. But still, I think this approach is much smarter.\n\nLook at Sony. They try so much to put high-performance ($$$) hardware in their systems, that when things don't go as planned, they don't have any margin to support it for long.\n\nNintendo didn't abandonned the Wii U, despite sales far less than stellar. Sony dropped the Vita about a year and a half after launch. Same with the PSP Go back then.\n\n169\n\nduffmmann\n\nThing is, remote play via the Vita is a pretty useful thing, it's Sony's solution to getting current gen games out on a portable device, sure by having to rely on streaming, its not perfect, but it is a viable solution for those looking for it. But of course the price of a vita is a significant barrier if all you want is remote play of your PS4. So what I propose is that Sony creates a device JUST for remote play from the PS4, it could look very similar to a Vita, mostly gutted, only able to turn on and connect to wifi and your PS4, with the added necessary L2 and R2 triggers. Something like that could probably be sold for around $100. It wouldn't do amazing, but it would be something I'd be interested in, bundle it with a PS4 for an extra $100 and I'd absolutely consider getting that bundle.\n\n170\n\nduffmmann\n\n@jhewitt3476 That mostly sounds good, I'd also love to continue to see glasses-free stereoscopic 3D in future handhelds as well. As long as its always optional like it is on the 3DS, I see no reason not to include it (would be for handheld mode only obviously), but I have always loved that feature of the 3DS and I'd be disappointed if that tech was only ever utilized for the 3DS and no other portable gaming systems going forward.\n\n171\n\nerv\n\n@duffmmann this is exactly what I want! If I had a great hd screen and nice, full controls, I'd buy it for remote play.\n\nIt's one of the most used functions for me, I play remotely more often than not.\n\nI hope something comes along. Didn't know the vita didn't have two shoulder buttons on each side...\n\n172\n\nduffmmann\n\n@erv Yeah, you have to use the touch pad on the back of the Vita to substitute for L2 and R2 when using it for remote play. It works, but it is not ideal.\n\n173\n\nRealnoize\n\n@NEStalgia\n\nThat whole screen size issue may be relative. I had a GPD Win, which allowed me to play full blown PC games natively (not streamed) on a handheld the size of a 3DS (more or less), and it had a 5.6\" (or about) screen at 720p. I had no problem playing the likes of Burnout Paradise, Mass Effect, Borderlands, many LEGO games, Final Fantasy X-X2 remaster, and so many others... that were all made to work on bigger screens from the start.\n\nSure, it's small, but then I noticed that I naturally held this console differently than how I hold my Switch. I held the GPD Win closer to my face, while I hold the Switch a bit further away, lower, with me looking down on the screen.\n\nI'm not seeing this as a big issue. Even Mass Effect, with all that small text, was perfectly playable. So I don't think this is that big of an issue.\n\n174\n\nshani\n\nWell that makes sense, they just don't stand a chance against Nintendo dominating the portable market with two devices.\n\n175\n\nSlim1999\n\n@PlayerOne Nintendo said this year they are workin on the 3ds\n\nSuccessor\n\n176\n\nNEStalgia\n\n@Realnoize I'm pretty near-sighted. Close-up I can see things like a microscope. And even for me UIs start getting difficult to use on 6.3\"...not just the small UI text these days, but details in game action you're supposed to be paying attention to (sniping a far off character in Wolfenstein for example) just isn't meant for anything so small. Very many games become useless if you go any smaller.\n\nMost 1st party Nintendo games on Switch take that into account and have chunkier than average UIs by design, but games designed for other consoles and PC tend not to care much about that.\n\nThat brave new world of sub-6\" displays for console gaming doesn't really sound very appealing at all without games being designed for it. It's one thing on an ultra high res phone with reading small text in emails and such, but when the action gets going, and a display that's not as high res density it just falls apart.\n\nPlus it ignores a vast swath of population that's far-sighted in a time when they want to grow the customer base. And remember, someday we'll be the far sighted ones who can't see the thing!\n\n177\n\nSlim1999\n\n@jhewitt3476 lol Nintendo said this year they were working on a 3ds successor.and that the switch was not its replacement.lol they also said that at e3 this year\n\n178\n\nlink3710\n\nI always loved the Vita's hardware, it's a shame the software was never there for me to pull the trigger on buying one. Shame that that's the end of it.\n\n179\n\nDanteSolablood\n\n@OberonPrime I completely agree that healthy competition is a necessity for any progress to be made, though I don't know if I'd describe it as leaving \"money on the table\". While the PS4 has been a huge success, the Sony conglomerate as a whole has been leaking money like someone trying to carry the Atlantic ocean in a sieve... they can't afford to take too many risks.\n\nWhile the PSP was a moderate success & brought in some money, the PS Vita has sold well in Japan but gave Sony a financial hit in the the rest of the world.. we can't forget that Sony failed HARD on the Xperia Play phones. Unlike Microsoft that didn't make any money on their Xbox until WELL into the 360's lifecycle (probably as people usually had to buy more than one ), Sony has to be careful.\n\nPersonally, I can't see Sony attempting something in the handheld market until well into the PS5's lifecycle & even then will they be willing to break off a portion of their software development team to EXCLUSIVELY work on games for it... something that is 100% necessary.\n\nNow if Microsoft bought out Sega & put their hat into the ring.. then we'd be talking!!\n\nOh and I've leant my Vita to my younger brother.. personally I bought it to play some exclusive Japanese games - before I saw how much they cost!! Some more expensive than the console right now!\n\n180\n\nlink3710\n\n@Slim1999 To be fair, they've said from the start the NX would be an 'ecosystem' not a single piece of hardware. A portable only Switch iteration that plays the same games would certainly position itself as the cheaper alternative 3DS successor they were referring to without adding a whole extra system to support with releases.\n\n181\n\nHaywired\n\n@Slim1999\n\nSomeone asked Nintendo about the future of dedicated handhelds and Nintendo simply said they \"were considering many possibilities\", which could just as easily mean there definitely won't be a 3DS successor as there will be. NintendoLife's misleading headline may have suggested that they confirmed a new 3DS, but they never actually said anything of the sort. Unless by 3DS successor, we're talking about the inevitable Switch Lite/Switch Mini/Switch Portable or whatever, then yes, that will most likely be the 3DS successor. After all, it would be pretty strange to unify their home and handheld divisions, make a hybrid console, put mainline Pokémon on it, and then disunify them a couple of years later.\n\n182\n\nDanteSolablood\n\n@Slim1999 The \"3DS Successor\" is likely going to be whatever replaces the Switch rather than something that competes with it. Nintendo simply don't have the resources to adequately support two handheld/hybrid devices. Trying to manage two separate ecosystems was part of what led to huge gaming droughts during the WiiU's lifetime. Given that it takes a long time to develop new hardware from concept.. whatever this \"Successor\" is, could pop up in around 5 years time, when the Switch will be getting towards it's end.\n\n@Haywired Any \"3DS Successor\" would in reality be a \"2DS Successor\" as Nintendo themselves aren't really keen on the 3D gimmick any more. I'm glad they got it out of their system!! While, as a above, I doubt Nintendo will butcher their own sales by bringing out a new handheld to compete with the Switch... I can see they maybe producing the Switch Lite aimed at a younger \"joycon snapping\" audience.\n\n183\n\nNEStalgia\n\n@Slim1999 No, they most certainly did not. They have said, as they have always said they are \"always considering possibilities.\" A fun way of saying \"we have no comment at this time.\"\n\nWe do not know what hardware they will produce, but a 3DS successor that serves no function but to compete directly against Switch's momentum makes absolutely no sense at all. Switch may be \"too big and fragile and expensive\" to suit absolutely everyone's tastes, and we do not know if bigger/smaller skus of switch will be made available as other models in the ven of 2DS, but they are absolutely not going to produce a whole separate software ecosystem again, undermining the entire streamlining of resources and assets the unification into Switch was designed to achieve. If you like a smaller compact piece of hardware, there's a fair reason to believe a new SKU of Switch hardware that's physically smaller but plays most Switch games may come into existence around the time of Pokemon 2019. But if you're looking for a whole second platform with a whole software ecosystem, that's extraordinarily unlikely to happen. Switch's whole point is to get out of that cycle they could no longer afford to sustain (and clearly neither does Sony wish to.)\n\n184\n\nNemodius\n\n@Slim1999 and as for the same reasons I've mentioned before, unless Nintendo would coume up with something fantastic and astounding and unique, it will just be a dumb idea, short of making a \"Nintendo Wii-DS\", able to play the disk games and DS/3DS backwards compatibility, I can't see what Nintendo could put out that customers wouldn't see as \"what's the point ???\"\n\n185\n\nelectrolite77\n\n@Slim1999\n\n“Nintendo said this year they were working on a 3ds successor”\n\nThey really didn’t.\n\n186\n\nduffmmann\n\n@jhewitt3476 I don't think a new Nintendo handheld would need to do something completely innovative, it could instead continue to stand as Nintendo's separate 2 screen experience with optional stereoscopic 3D. If the improved processing power coupled with the framework being similar to the Switch, it wouldn't be hard for devs to create a slightly different version of all their titles that can then optionally make use of a second screen and stereoscopic 3D. I understand the idea of redundancy that would be happening there, but I think the 2 devices could coexist as different feature driven systems capable of playing the same games just in different ways.\n\n187\n\nelectrolite77\n\nProbably for the best Sony steering clear of handhelds.\n\nNobody can support two distinct systems anymore.\n\nTheir strength is in Home systems.\n\nThey made such a mess of the Vita it’s unreal. Gorgeous hardware but so many mistakes. Overpriced proprietary memory cards. Half hearted backwards compatibility. Not enough buttons to do Remote Play properly. Not enough buttons to play PS1 Classics properly. Dropping it like a stone after two years of second tier support.\n\nEveryone has their strengths and Sony are not great at handhelds.\n\n188\n\nelectrolite77\n\nAnybody wanting Nintendo to make another handheld with its own distinct range of software is wanting them to commit hari kari. A smaller more durable version of the Switch would be fine but anything else means development of software for two systems and would be a disaster.\n\n189\n\nMoshugan\n\nIt's a shame, because Sony's portable game was great! PS Vita especially is a fantastic product all-in-all. (Although I never owned Vita or PSP) And Nintendo needs healthy competition.\n\n190\n\nTheMadPolarBear\n\nI dunno about you folks but I've not seen the 3DS in stock for a while. They seem to be only producing the New 2DS's at the moment, at least in my humble part of the UK.\n\n191\n\nSuperzone13\n\nHey, I gotta give Sony some credit. They put up a better fight against Nintendo in the handheld market than anyone else ever has. The PSP in particular sold fairly well and had some classic games on it.\n\n192\n\nDarthFoxMcCloud\n\n@The_Pixel_King HEHE, it took me a while to get used to it too but honestly, like you I've gotten used to the separated directional buttons on the standard Joy Con. It is nice to know that there are options though, and maybe someday Nintendo will themselves sell left Joy Con with a standard D-Pad (hopefully if they do, it's cheaper than buying a Joy Con pack is now).\n\n193\n\ndarthstuey\n\n@Anti-Matter please please stop.\n\n194\n\nNEStalgia\n\n@duffmmann Sony already has a Remote Play app that works on Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS. Everybody already owns a Remote Play-only device to use with PS4. (and it works better than the Vita's does, considering more powerful hardware for streaming, and the ability to use a real controller rather than rear \"touch\" buttons for r2, l2, r3, l3.)\n\n195\n\nCrazyOtto\n\n@FragRed 8th gen killed \"pillars\" with the Wii U and PS Vita not being successful like the 3DS and PS4.\n\n196\n\nCrazyOtto\n\n@Slim1999 They said that they weren't counting out a 3DS successor so they would secretly have a plan B if the Switch abruptly falls off a cliff (not going to happen at this point).\n\n197\n\nAnri02\n\nI love my Vita, and am sad it's being discontinued.\n\n198\n\nCrazyOtto\n\nAlot of people say that the 3DS's rocky 2011 and the Vita's downfall was entirely because of the smartphone boogeyman when they were both because of choices that both Nintendo and Sony made.\n\n199\n\nlordzand\n\nSo we're just going to pretend like mobile phones aren't where most people go to play portable games now? Even Nintendo has caught on to that and is trying to cash it. I don't think a lot of causal even buy portable game systems anymore, as they were never really in it for long and in depth games anyway.\n\nThat said this could change. Also I still hope we get another dedicated handheld from Nintendo and I absolutely find it hilarious that everyone here thinks they know it would fail. The truth is that no wants to have to share new releases between the two no matter what people say about being happy with the indie flood we get now.\n\n200\n\nNemodius\n\nthe game system does not make the games, the games make the system, the people have demands, the companies try to make a system that allows the games the people want to exist, the better the abilities of a system, the more the people can get, the more the people get, the more they want, but......\n\nunlike the world of cars, the same company coming out with two almost identical SUV's, at the same time will look like fools, as the sales of the one SUV is cut in half and the sales of both vehicles will not be worth the money they put into either\n\nNintendo will be fools to make a separate portable system\n\n201\n\nBaker1000\n\nSony stopped supporting Vita years ago. When was the last time they mentioned it in their E3 conferences? Sony handhelds were only ever ported PS2 games or spin-off portable editions of other popular PS2 or 3 games. There was very little developed new for the systems, and when the audience Sony aim for is mainly people who want powerful consoles and the best graphics, they aren't going to downgrade or even double dip to play a game on the move.\n\n202\n\nSerpenterror\n\nI like their handhelds (PSP & PS Vita) but like Sega it seems Sony never really put any passion into both of their handhelds, kinda feel like they had to do it cause Nintendo does it. A lot of what they offer in both are mostly ports of games already on their consoles or other platforms, even PS Vita's best game Persona 4 Golden was a port. Exclusives are few and far between and unless you really dig deep will you find something truly good on those systems. Games like the Star Ocean 1 & 2 remakes, Crisis Core, Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep, the portable GTA games, and God of War were great exclusive to get a PSP but with PS Vita's non-backward compatibility with PSP physical games, Vita owner who wants to play those had to shell more money for an old PSP system as those games were never sold on Sony's PlayStation Store thus can't be play on PS Vita.\n\nEven PSP Go owners were outrage as not all PSP games went digital. Then there's the memory card situation, where they use proprietary memory card rather than common SD cards. Also add the fact that Sony had no killer app title, a Pokemon killer would had help their handheld so to go head to he"
