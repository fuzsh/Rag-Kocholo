        "text": "The PSP has received more than 650 games since it launched in March 2005. With nearly 10 million consoles sold in the USA the Playstation Portable had many games that sold millions of copies. But the PSP also has its fair share of rare games that are hard to find and are quite expensive. Below is a list of the rarest PSP games and what makes them so valuable.\n\nClick to see Prices For All Playstation Portable (PSP) Games\n\nMost Valuable PSP Video Games\n\nMonster Kingdom Jewel Summoner\n\nNew Price: $80 | Used Price: $28 | See Current Prices\n\nMonster Kingdom Jewel Summoner is a turn based RPG published by Atlus. You collect jewels that have trapped monsters inside. When you summon the monsters they will fight untamed monsters for you. The game is often compared to the Pokemon series.\n\nAtlus is well known for small print runs for their games. Monster Kingdom fit the stereotypical Atlus release and is quite difficult to find at local stores. If the game increases in price much more Atlus will probably reprint it as they have done with other popular games.\n\nHexyz Force\n\nNew Price: $70 | Used Price: $35 | See Current Prices\n\nHexyz Force is a RPG developed by Atlus. You follow the story of two different characters who try to save the world from destruction. Their stories are different but cross paths at certain points.\n\nHexyz Force was published in small quantities by Atlus, but was also hurt by a pre-order problem at Gamestop. Many customers who pre-ordered never received the game because of the snafu. Atlus typically sells a large percentage of their games via pre-order so this hurt sales a great deal.\n\nLegend of Heroes II Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch\n\nNew Price: $70 | Used Price: $23 | See Current Prices\n\nLegend of Heroes II is a role playing game published by Namco Bandai. The Legend of Heroes series has been on the NEC, Saturn, PC, and PSP but only the PSP games have been translated into English. This is actually the third game released in the series.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes series is not a popular RPG series outside of Japan so it was printed in a small quantity. Prices for Moonlight Witch more than doubled when the fourth title, Trails in the Sky, came out in 2011.\n\nYs I & II Chronicles\n\nNew Price: $60 | Used Price: $36 | See Current Prices\n\nYs I and II Chronicles is a compilation of the first two Ys RPG's released for the Turbo Grfx CD. Prior to the PSP version's release in 2011, the game had been relased on Wii Virtual Console and Nintendo DS. The game received widespread praise in the gaming press.\n\nThe Ys compilation sold very few copies. Even with the title available on many different consoles, gamer's continue to buy the PSP version. They can play it other places, but collector's are willing to pay a premium for its rarity.\n\nHarvest Moon Boy and Girl\n\nNew Price: $60 | Used Price: $26 | See Current Prices\n\nHarvest Moon Boy & Girl is a farm/life simulator published by Natsume. The Boy portion is a remake of Harvest Moon Back to Nature for PS1 and the girl version is a remake with a girl as the make character and boys she can choose to marry.\n\nHarvest Moon titles have a very devoted following of hardcore fans. This version of the game has been released on GBA, PS1, PSP, and even Playstation Network but many fans are willing to pay a premium for the rare PSP version.\n\nPhantasy Star Portable 2\n\nNew Price: $55 | Used Price: $33 | See Current Prices\n\nPhantasy Star Portable 2 is a role-playing game for the PSP. It has a single player mode but emphasizes co-op local and internet play. It is the only game in the series to not require a monthly fee for online play.\n\nPhantasy Star Portable 2 was published by Sega after moderate success from the original Phantasy Star game on PSP. The sequel sold poorly enough that Sega never brought the next game in the series, Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infitity, to the USA.\n\nRiviera The Promised Land\n\nNew Price: $55 | Used Price: $17 | See Current Prices\n\nRiviera The Promised Land is an turn based RPG from Atlus. The game has some unconvential takes on RPGs with dating sim elements and the lack of control of the main character when outside of dungeons. Riviera was originally released on WonderSwan Color in Japan and Gameboy Advance in the USA.\n\nLike all other Atlus titles on the list, the game was printed in limited quantites to ensure it sold out. Prices for the game in loose condition are fairly reasonable. When brand new the price is much higher and has been increasing during the last year.\n\nCrimson Gem Saga\n\nNew Price: $49 | Used Price: $30 | See Current Prices\n\nCrimson Saga is turn based role playing game developed in South Korea and published in the USA by Atlus. It is the sequel to Astonishia Story but with many new gameplay mechanics. The game doesn't do anything unique in the world of RPG's, but is very solid and well reviewed.\n\nThis is another Atlus published RPG. Atlus printed the game in limited quantities because it is a niche title and the original game sold very little. Atlus has not reprinted the game.\n\nHarvest Moon: Hero of LeafValley\n\nNew Price: $40 | Used Price: $25 | See Current Prices\n\nHarvest Moon: Hero of Leaf Valley is a farm/life simulation game in the long running Harvest Moon series. You take over your grandfather's farm and must raise crops and livestock to earn a profit. The grand goal is to save the town from turning into an amusement park.\n\nHarvest Moon is a very niche genre of farm and love simulation. You must raise crops and get girls from town to marry you. Harvest Moon generally sell very few copies but keep their value over a long time. Harvest Moon titles are some of the most expensive games for SNES and N64.\n\nNaruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Impact\n\nNew Price: $35 | Used Price: $27 | See Current Prices\n\nNaruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Impact is a fighting game for the PSP. You play as different characters from the Naruto series, each with unique abilities and moves. Ultimate Ninja Impact is the 6th Naruto game for the PSP and most likely the last.\n\nThe game sold modestly in the USA. It is the last title in the series for the PSP so it is still in high demand from Naruto fans.\n\nOther Expensive Playstation Portable (PSP) Games\n\nYu-Gi-Oh GX Tag Force 2 - New Price: $42 | Used Price: $23\n\nYs The Ark of Napishtim - New Price: $52 | Used Price: $14\n\nExpensive Limited Edition PSP Games\n\nDJ Max Fever Crew Edition - New Price: $250 | Used Price: $NA\n\nLunar: Silver Star Harmony Limited Edition - New Price: $45 | Used Price: $30\n\nYs: The Oath in Felghana Premium Edition - New Price: $36 | Used Price: $25\n\nLegend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky Premium Edition - New Price: $32 | Used Price: $28\n\nClick to see Prices For All Playstation Portable (PSP) Games\n\nThe list is ranked by the highest average new price and then highest average used price in the event of a tie.\n\nBuy and sell games in our Free Game Marketplace"
