        "text": "Welcome! We’ve had plenty to share already about PlayStation VR2 since its initial announcement. We’ve had the first look at the innovative PS VR2 Sense controller, early details on the system specs and the design inspirations behind the headset and recently the launch window lineup. Today.

Actual retailer prices may vary.\n\nAvailability in each country/region is subject to local import regulations.\n\nWhat’s included in the PS VR2 box?\n\nPlayStation VR2 will be available in two options at launch.\n\nPlayStation VR2\n\nIncludes PS VR2 headset, PS VR2 Sense controller, stereo headphones with additional earpieces, USB cable\n\nPlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle\n\nIncludes PlayStation Store voucher code for Horizon Call of the Mountain, PS VR2 headset, PS VR2 Sense controller, stereo headphones with additional earpieces, USB cable.\n\nHow does PS VR2 enhance gameplay?\n\nPS VR2 is a quantum leap for VR experiences, and allows you to interact in new and immersive ways powered by the PS5 console. With PlayStation VR2 Sense Technology, it combines PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers, PlayStation VR2 headset feedback, 3D Audio, and eye tracking to bring emotion and immersion to life.\n\nIn a huge boost to visual clarity, the PS VR2 headset features an internal HDR OLED display that supports 2000 x 2040 pixels per eye, along with a wider field of view to create a more seamless VR gameplay experience.\n\nPS VR2 also features headset feedback with subtle haptic effects that add a tactile element to the sensory experience. Examples could include feeling your character’s heartbeat, the rush of objects passing close to your head, and more. Eye-tracking cameras follow your line of sight when aiming or looking around, with PS VR2 delivering a high-fidelity visual experience by adjusting resolutions to pinpoint and enhance whatever you’re focusing on (this is known as foveated rendering). The PS5 console’s advanced 3D audio features allow developers to create an incredibly realistic soundscape, too.\n\nThe included PS VR2 Sense controller also brings significant enhancements to the VR experience, including much more precise hand motion tracking than PS VR, finger touch detection, as well as haptic feedback and adaptive trigger effects similar to the DualSense wireless controller for the PS5 console.\n\nAnd PS VR2’s setup is easy: One USB Type-C cord plugs directly into the PS5 console. “Inside out” cameras embedded into the headset track the movements of your head, making a simple, intuitive playing experience without the need for external cameras or other sensors.\n\nWill PS VR2 work with the PS4 console?\n\nPS VR2 is designed for the PS5 console, and will not work with the PS4 console.\n\nWhat are the differences between PS VR2 and the first generation PS VR?\n\nWhat are the different viewing modes on PS VR2?\n\nThere are two viewing modes.\n\nVR Mode: You can enjoy VR game content in a 360 degree view in a virtual environment. Content will be displayed in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) with 90Hz/120Hz frame rate.\n\nCinematic Mode: You can view the PS5 system and UI and all non-VR game and media content, such as streaming apps, on a virtual cinema screen. Content in Cinematic Mode will be displayed in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and also 120Hz frame rate. The audio and image will be only displayed on the VR headset and there is no output on the TV side when you are wearing VR headset and playing in Cinematic mode.\n\nDoes PS VR2 support HDR?\n\nYes, the PS VR2 headset will display supported content in HDR, both VR Mode and Cinematic Mode.\n\nHow do I connect the PS VR2 to my PS5?\n\nIt’s easy: just use the USB Type-C cable that is included for the PS VR2 headset to directly connect to your PS5 console.\n\nHow long is this included USB Type-C cable for the PS VR2 headset?\n\nThe included cable is approximately 4.5m (14.7 ft) long.\n\nWhat is the minimum play space I need to use PS VR2?\n\nThere are three different VR Play Styles depending on the game content. Please check the compatibility notice for each title to ensure you have enough play space.\n\nRoomscale (allows more movement)\n\nA minimum play area of 2m × 2m (6 ft 7 in × 6 ft 7 in) in the room is required.\n\nSitting\n\nRequires a minimum play area of 1m × 1m (3 ft 4 in × 3 ft 4 in). Make sure you have enough space to move your arms freely.\n\nStanding\n\nRequires a minimum play area of 1m × 1m (3 ft 4 in × 3 ft 4 in). Make sure you have enough space to move your arms freely.\n\nCan I customize this play area?\n\nThe play area for PS VR2 can be customized by using the PS VR2 Sense controller and the cameras that are embedded in the PS VR2 headset. The cameras will allow you to scan the room, while the PS VR2 Sense controller allows you to expand and further customize the play area to fit your play style and room environment.\n\nWhile playing, if you get close to the boundary you have set up, you will receive a warning that you are closely approaching the play area boundary. You can modify your settings at any time while PS VR2 is connected. Once you set up your play area, the settings will be saved unless you move into a different play area. You can use See-Through View to aid you at any time.\n\nWhat is See-Through View?\n\nWith PS VR2, you can see your surroundings while wearing the headset with the new See-Through View feature. It comes in handy when you want to easily check where the PS VR2 Sense controller is in your room without taking the headset off.\n\nThanks to the embedded cameras on PS VR2, you can press the function button on the headset, or use the PlayStation VR2 Quick Settings in the Control Center, to switch between viewing your surroundings, or viewing the content on PS VR2. The Card in the Control Center also gives quick access to other PS VR2 settings, such as adjusting the play area.\n\nThe See-Through View is for viewing only, so there’s no recording option.\n\nDoes my room have to be dark for PS VR2 to work?\n\nNo, this is not necessary. For the best experience, we recommend playing PS VR2 in a well-lit room.\n\nWhen I’m using PS VR2, will other people in the room be able to experience what I’m seeing?\n\nYes. Similar to PS VR, PS VR2 will also have Social Screen experience that allows others to see what you’re experiencing on the TV screen. Content is displayed in a 2D format. Please note this feature is only available when playing games in VR Mode.\n\nDo I need a separate camera to use PS VR2?\n\nNo. With inside-out tracking, PS VR2 tracks you and your controller through integrated cameras embedded into the PS VR2 headset. Your movements and the direction you look at are reflected in-game without the need for an external camera.\n\nCan I use the PS5 HD Camera with PS VR2?\n\nWhile there is no need to use an external camera to experience PS VR2 since it has four embedded cameras on the headset, the PS5 HD camera can be used with PS VR2 if you want to film yourself while playing using PS VR2’s broadcast feature.\n\nHow do I switch between playing PS VR2 games, and PS5 games on my TV?\n\nWill PS VR2 receive system updates?\n\nSystem updates for PS VR2 will be available through the PS5 console and players will be required to update to the latest version available.\n\nHow can I pre-order PS VR2?\n\nIn the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg, players can pre-order PS VR2 from PlayStation’s online store at direct.playstation.com.\n\nIn other markets, PS VR2 will be sold at participating retailers.\n\nWhat tips do you have to clean and maintain PS VR2?\n\nFor the PS VR2 headset and PS VR2 Sense controller surfaces, connectors, and ports, wipe clean with a soft dry cloth. Do not use thinners, benzine or alcohol. For lenses, wipe only with a soft, dry cloth made specifically for lens cleaning. Do not use paper towels or tissues that are not intended for lenses.\n\nThe lightshield can be removed from the PS VR2 headset and cleaned using water. Wipe the water off with a soft, dry cloth. Before using, air dry the light shield well in a place with good ventilation, before reattaching it back to the PS VR2 headset.\n\nThe integrated vents in the headset can be cleaned using a handheld vacuum cleaner to remove any dust buildup.\n\nThe Headset\n\nWhat is the video output in the headset?\n\nThe PS VR2 headset offers 4K HDR. The headset’s OLED display supports up to 2000×2040 per eye and refresh rates of 90/120Hz.\n\nCan the headset be adjusted for different head sizes?\n\nYes, similar to the first-generation PS VR headset, PS VR2 has an adjustable scope, a headband release button that can stretch or tighten the width of the band, and a headband adjustment dial to further tighten the band and fix the positioning.\n\nCan further adjustments be made in the viewfinder/scope area?\n\nYes, PS VR2 has a new lens adjustment dial, so you have an additional option to match the lens distance between your eyes to optimize your view.\n\nCan I wear my glasses inside of the headset?\n\nYes, PS VR2 was designed to accommodate players who wear glasses. However, some very wide or unusually shaped glasses may not fit.\n\nHow is PS VR2 headset design an improvement over PS VR?\n\nWe received a lot of positive feedback on PS VR’s comfort, so we kept some of the same ergonomic features players will be familiar with, such as the simple headband that can be adjusted to fit the wearer’s head, and careful weight distribution in the headset so it feels light and comfortable.\n\nWe also created a slimmer design with an overall weight reduction – even with the new added features such as the built-in motor for the headset feedback. For PS VR2, we took comfort a few steps further by adding new features, such as the adjustable lens dial and new integrated exhaust vent to help minimize lenses fogging up while players are immersed in a VR game.\n\nWhat additional sensory features are added compared to the first PS VR headset?\n\nThe headset feedback allows game designers to apply sensory feedback to the player’s head, increasing the feeling of immersion.\n\nThe PS VR2 headset can also detect the motion of your eyes using eye tracking, which has many possibilities for game design. Though game applications vary, some games allow you to look at an item to select it. This allows you to interact more intuitively in new and lifelike ways, allowing for a heightened emotional response and enhanced expression that provide a new level of realism in gaming.\n\nDoes the headset have PlayStation symbols embedded in it?\n\nYes, similar to the thousands of tiny PlayStation symbols we added to the surfaces of the PS5 console and DualSense controller, we also included tiny PlayStation symbols to the front and back bands of the PS VR2 headset. This adds a texture for a tactile feel for you to enjoy.\n\nDoes the headset have in-built mic, controls, and buttons?\n\nThe headset features a built-in microphone, a power button, and a function button that can switch to See Through View or mute/unmute the microphone.\n\nDoes the headset have a stereo headphone jack?\n\nYes. It’s the same placement as the original PS VR headset.\n\nHow long can I wear the PS VR2 headset for?\n\nTaking inspiration from PS VR, PS VR2 is designed for comfort and can be worn for extended periods of time. Players’ responses to VR gameplay can differ, but generally, the vast majority of gamers should be able to enjoy playing on PS VR2. We recommend taking frequent breaks, and if you experience any discomfort, discontinue playing.\n\nThe PS VR2 headset is not for use by children under age 12.\n\nCan I move around while wearing PS VR2?\n\nLimited movement is okay when playing content that uses the “Roomscale” VR Play Style, if you stay within the play area while using PS VR2. You’ll get a warning if you move close to the boundary area that you’ve set up in your customized play area.\n\nCan I use a wireless headset with the PS VR2 headset?\n\nHeadphones that are compatible with PS5 or with a 3.5mm jack will be compatible with PS VR2. Depending on the design and how you wear them, your headphones may not fit around the PS VR2 headband. Be sure to check for a proper fit.\n\nPlayStation VR2 Sense Controller\n\nWhat are the PS VR2 Sense controller features and buttons?\n\nThe new PS VR2 Sense controller enables players to feel and interact with games in a much more visceral way. There are several features, including key features from PS5’s DualSense controller, which match SIE’s vision for what the next-generation of VR games can be.\n\nAdaptive Triggers: Each PS VR2 Sense controller (Left and Right) includes an adaptive trigger button that adds palpable tension when pressed, similar to what’s found in the DualSense wireless controller. For instance, when playing Horizon Call of the Mountain, you’ll feel the tension when drawing your bow.\n\nHaptic Feedback: Optimized for its form factor, the PS VR2 Sense controller’s haptic feedback makes every sensation in the game world more impactful, textured, and nuanced. When you’re traversing through rocky desert or trading blows in melee combat, you’ll feel the difference, magnifying the extraordinary visual and audio experience that’s so central to VR.\n\nFinger Touch Detection: The PS VR2 Sense controller can detect the approximate location of your fingers, enabling you to make more natural gestures with your hands during gameplay.\n\nTracking: The PS VR2 Sense controller is tracked by the PS VR2 headset through a tracking ring across the bottom of the controller.\n\nAction Buttons / Analog Sticks: The Left controller contains one analog stick, the Triangle and Square buttons, a “grip” button (L1), trigger button (L2) and Create button. The Right controller contains one analog stick, the Cross and Circle buttons, a “grip” button (R1), trigger button (R2) and Options button. The “grip” button can be used to pick up in-game objects, as one example.\n\nCan I use the PS Move controller with PS VR2? Or the PS VR Aim controller?\n\nNo, only the included PS VR2 Sense controller and the DualSense controller or DualSense Edge controller for PS5 are compatible with PS VR2.
