        "text": "Entrepreneur and media personality Martina Zammit yesterday celebrated her one-year wedding anniversary with her partner, Emma, in a heartfelt social media post.\n\nThe couple, whose engagement in 2022 during a family trip to Sicily captured hearts, exchanged vows in Malta in 2023. Martina’s message, filled with gratitude and love, honoured their journey together, expressing appreciation for Emma as her “rock” and “partner in crime.”\n\nIn her post, Martina reflected on their special day, reminiscing about cherished memories from their special day and looking forward to the adventures, laughter, and love that lie ahead.\n\n#MaltaDaily\n\nLast Saturday, English Path & GBS Malta joined hands for a noble cause – a beach cleanup event at Golden Bay. With a dynamic mix of management staff, academics, and enthusiastic students, the collective mission was crystal clear: to remove litter from one of Malta’s pristine beaches and maintain its natural beauty.\n\nApart from a cleanup activity, the event doubled as a fantastic team-building exercise, breaking the teams free from their usual office attire and immersing themselves in a shared goal of environmental conservation. At their core, they believe in making meaningful contributions to their communities – a value that resonates deeply with each member of the organisation.\n\nFor English Path & GBS Malta, community involvement isn’t just a checkbox; it’s a passion they hold close to their hearts. That’s why their events calendar brims with opportunities for service, with a minimum of 4 to 6 impactful events scheduled each year. From a cleanup event at St. Paul’s Bay to lending a helping hand to Puttinu Cares and Len & Jacob, the commitment to making a difference knows no limits.\n\nBut the journey doesn’t end there. Next month, they are gearing up to extend their support to the Island Sanctuary, continuing the tradition of giving back to causes that matter.\n\nJoin in as English Path & GBS Malta champion environmental stewardship, teamwork, and community spirit. Together, we can create waves of change that ripple far beyond the shores of Golden Bay.\n\n#MaltaDaily\n\nA recent study conducted by the Health Metrics and Evaluation Unit in the United States, and published in The Lancet, indicates a global trend towards declining fertility rates, with Malta expected to experience a continued decrease in fertility until the year 2050. The comprehensive research, which examined data from 204 countries, predicts that nearly every population worldwide will see a decrease by the end of the century due to insufficient numbers of newborns to offset death rates.\n\nThis decline in global fertility, which is not expected to balance the rate of deaths until the year 2100, places Malta among the majority of nations unable to produce enough newborn children to support both deaths and population growth. The study reveals that 97% of countries will be affected by this trend, with the global fertility rate projected to fall from 2.23 births per woman in 2021 to 1.68 in 2050, and even further to 1.57 by 2100.\n\nFor population stability, developed countries require a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman. However, Malta’s fertility rate was 1.53 in 2021, and the study projects a decline to 1.39 by 2050 and 1.26 by 2100, underscoring a significant challenge. Japan and South Korea are identified as having the lowest fertility rates, highlighting a global issue that extends far beyond Malta’s borders. This anticipated demographic shift necessitates careful planning and policy adjustments to mitigate its impacts.\n\n#MaltaDaily"
