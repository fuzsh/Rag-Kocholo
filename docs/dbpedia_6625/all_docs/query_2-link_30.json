        "text": "It seems to me that the PlayStation Portable has been copping a lot more heat regarding predictions this year and what Sony plans to do with the console. IGN's Chris Roper recently posted an article which suggested that games that had come out exclusively on the PlayStation Portable - games like Pursuit Force, God of War, Wipeout, LocoRoco - might have come out on PSN (and, were they not licensed by Sony, also on XBLA), and thus be playable on consoles. (And I talked a bit about it on my podcast, plug ;) .)\n\nImagine the PSP never existed. Would you purchase and play value-priced games ($10~$15) of PSP-level quality, that is a similar graphical quality, similar physics engines, et cetera, if they were released on XBLA or PSN? For example, let's say Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is released in the state it would be released for the PSP for, except on PSN. Would you buy it for $15 or $20?\n\nI'd have to imagine that the graphics would obviously sub-par a full release, but with this comes the insinuation that graphics would be bumped up to a little bit better than PSP level. Personally, I'd totally be willing to pay $10 or $15 for a Chains of Olympus, and most definitely up to $25 for a Wipeout like Wipeout Pure or Pulse. Hell, I'd pay $25 right now if they just released those games as is for PSN right now. Those games are pretty damn good. Peace Walker? I'd pay ~$20. Perhaps that's the appeal: high quality games, in some cases, on the cheap as well, regardless of lower quality graphics.\n\nTo answer your question, yes, I would pay for full-fledged \"portable\" games to play on my PS3 or Xbox 360. You could argue that stuff like Braid, The Maw and the upcoming Explodemon are somewhat analogous to this idea though.\n\nHowever, this brings up a good point about the PSP. I do like Gran Turismo, LittleBigPlanet, Grand Theft Auto Stories & all those games, don't get me wrong. They're fantastic representations of how close the PSP can emulate higher powered systems & games. However, these games are exactly what's wrong with the PSP. I'm not impressed with a portable game that just emulates the console version. That's awesome and all, but in that case, I'd much rather just play games on my console instead. Give me something that cannot be done on any other system, or that is done best on a portable system, and I'll bite. Stuff like Dissidia and Pursuit Force work because they're simpler, bite-sized takes on action series, perfect for any time you have a few minutes to spare. Yes, they could arguably be done better on a \"big\" system, but if it works perfectly well on the portable system, why ruin that?"
