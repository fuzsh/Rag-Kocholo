Although heralded by some as one of the most original and innovative directorial debuts of the 1970s, Alan Rudolph's WELCOME TO L.A., like his REMEMBER MY NAME, seems specifically designed for cult status. It takes an off-beat look at a self-important group of Los Angeles bohemians and their essentially worthless lives, which revolve mainly around sex, drinking, and driving (though not necessarily at the same time). Carradine and his fellow Altman veterans just seem to wander around a lot, and the film's success or failure depends almost entirely on how much you like them.
