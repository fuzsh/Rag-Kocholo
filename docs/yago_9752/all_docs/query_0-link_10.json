        "text": "My dad is a retired TV director. He directed a lot of television in the Fifties-mostly filmed half-hour comedies like The Bob Cummings Show and The Donna Reed Shoio and The Ann Sothern Show. And he did some really nice things: Ford Theater, which wasn't comedy, and then he did a couple of Playhouse 90's. I started in the mailroom at Paramount, and then in 1967 I got into The Directors Guild Training Program. I became a Second Assistant Director, then a First A.D. really quick. I was one of the youngest Firsts around. I worked on a lot of very mediocre, functional things. Worked on some of the first movies for television. I worked on about fifteen of those at Paramount.

MILLER, and I really knew that was the place to be. And so, I came over here and started working.\n\nTHE LONG GOODBYE, I worked with Tommy as assistant director. I was listed as the second A.D. When I started working with Tommy and Bob, I hadn't been a second for something like four years. And with them, it wasn't like being a second. Bob would let me do things, and so would Tommy. I wasn't after career, so I didn't care about the credit. Since I worked with Bob, I haven't worked with anybody else on films.\n\nAfter the LONG GOODBYE, they went on to do thieves like us, and I said, \"This has been the..."
