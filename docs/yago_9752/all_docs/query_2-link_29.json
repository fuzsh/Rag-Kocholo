        "text": "Everything Coming Together\n\nInsofar as “independent” can refer to a fixed thing, Trouble in Mind fits the bill. Its $2.8 million budget was, for Rudolph, monstrous, but was in line with other independent features (with the exception of Carolco’s infamously bloated budget for 1985 Rambo: First Blood, Part II). Financing was strangely, blessedly secure. He told me:\n\nThis was the only time before or since when I’ve had absolute certainty concerning a future project. Knowing instead of hoping made a real difference how I approached matters on Trouble, Page 33 →creative and practical. The unpaved road was smooth for one glorious stretch before the next blind corner.10\n\nThe film came together in other ways. In our conversations, Rudolph stated that he took the best of his crewmembers from Choose Me, worked with the same producers, some of the same actors, and found other personnel in serendipitous ways. He would never have thought to hire Kristofferson to play Hawk had it not been for stepping in at the last minute to direct Songwriter; he was able to hire composer Mark Isham, sight unseen, based on overlapping phone calls (see Chapter 5, “The Style of Dreams”); he hired camera operator Toyomichi Kurita upon their first meeting in spite of Kurita’s shyness about taking on the project and his limited ability to speak English: the meeting, moreover, occurred by chance, within a week of cinematographer John Bailey recommending the Japanese cameraman to him. As for Divine, four other directors had approached him for projects; it was Rudolph’s Trouble in Mind that landed him.\n\nEven preproduction went smoothly. With the producers and a skeletal crew, Rudolph traveled from Los Angeles to Seattle—an area that he loves for its rainy, overcast cool weather—to scout locations for Wanda’s, Hilly’s mansion, and different areas (the street protest; the paths Georgia takes running; Coop’s and Solo’s petty thievery, etc.) In Seattle he found the perfect Rain City, a town that he said had its own “hard-boiled romanticism.” Producer David Blocker, by contrast, found Seattle to be an “empty city at the time; there was Page 34 →actually a sign as you went to the airport that said, ‘The last one to leave, turn out the lights.’”11 (A similar scenario afflicted other North American cities during the 1980s, between industrial shifts and economic downturns.) For costumer Tynan, the faltering economy made Seattle “a mecca of vintage stuff at the time,” and she raided its shops for kimonos, military outfits, and Carradine’s whacked-out urban wardrobe.\n\nDespite Rudolph musing that Seattle has a “dreamy quality to it”12 that he would call its “soul,”13 he knew that to make Rain City “we had to take the Seattle out of it.”14 “During shooting we daily used artwork to mask Seattle or create our world,”15 covering street and bus signs with their own signs that identified regional sectors or otherwise enhanced the sense of menace parading around the diegetic town. Scouting locations took time: “I had spent many weeks walking Seattle looking for Rain City.” But there, at a First Avenue alley, a boarded-up storage room for a neighboring fabric store would become Wanda’s Café. “It was just waiting for us,” he said. Wanda’s Café would end up looking so real that people came in off the streets and thought it was a functioning diner.16 Just as auspiciously, the upstairs had apartments that could be used as rooms for Wanda and Hawk. Producer David Blocker recalls that a hawk flew by and landed on the building, as if lending its approval.\n\nBlocker produced Trouble in Mind with Carolyn Pfeiffer, one of few powerhouse female producers (and the sole woman distributor) at the time, at the newly formed Island Alive with Island Pictures, where she, Chris Blackwell, and Shep Gordon were equal partners, collectively deciding what film projects Page 35 →to take on. Releases of Island Alive films included Stop Making Sense (1984), Koyaanisqatsi (1982), and the aforementioned Kiss of the Spider Woman. Gordon joined as head of Alive Enterprises, an active music management company (with acts such as Teddy Pendergrass, Alice Cooper, and Blondie), and Blackwell helmed the Island Records label, which included iconic rock clients such as Marianne Faithfull, Tom Waits, and U2, and which introduced Bob Marley and other Jamaican reggae artists to the world. The merger not only traded in indie musical hipness but in youth culture more generally, pitching wares to those open to nonmainstream fare at the time. For a few years, it was a perfect union, with Island Alive burnishing Trouble in Mind with young indie cred from the start. But internal squabbles would dissolve Island Alive during the making of Trouble in Mind, and its production and distribution would be picked up by Pfeiffer and Gordon’s Alive Films (which subsequently produced Rudolph’s The Moderns and distributed foreign art films such as Betty Blue [1986] and the documentary Marlene [1984]).\n\nThere was a certain convergence of Island Alive, Alive, and Island Records with Rudolph’s image as a director with a pulse on youth culture, given Rudolph’s familiarity with a wide range of popular music (it helped, as he has said, to have grown up in a house filled with records). Shep Gordon sent Rudolph some songs to consider for a soundtrack from Alive Enterprises client Teddy Pendergrass, the popular R&B singer whose career had taken a downturn in the mid-1980s after a disabling car accident. Rudolph was approached to make a music video for one of them, Luther Vandross’s “You’re My Page 36 →Choice Tonight / Choose Me.” He countered by proposing to make a movie based on the song for nearly the same budget.\n\nChoose Me’s soulful R&B had been preceded by the rock and roll soundtrack of Rudolph’s United Artists comedy Roadie in 1980, a film that followed the tour of the fictional Travis Redfish (played by the inimitable Meat Loaf), and included 1980s rock icons such as Blondie, Alice Cooper, Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, and Asleep at the Wheel. Cameos also included country legends Roy Orbison and Hank Williams, and Rudolph would solidify his C&W credentials five years later in Songwriter, which featured songwriter-singer superstars Willie Nelson and Kristofferson. Rudolph found the Songwriter experience enjoyable, and recalled the friendly rivalry between the two stars, who kept slipping songs under his door “for his consideration.” Kristofferson would go on to write the closing number for Trouble in Mind that Mark Isham arranged with a moving combination of muted jazz trumpet and synthesizer; Faithfull did the vocals, exemplifying in a single piece not only Rudolph’s range of musical passions and interests but his ability to bring different styles in collaboration together. Roadie had exhibited a similar crossing of styles when punk/pop singer Blondie performed the Johnny Cash classic “Ring of Fire.”\n\nLike his music, Rudolph’s casting choices evinced a youthful, counterculture savvy, and his means of hiring people was highly unconventional, typically bypassing tryouts and interviews. He says that his decisions are often made by “lightning bolts” rather than studied tryouts—Divine was “hired in about an hour.”Page 37 →appeared in a half dozen of his films; Nick Nolte, four; two each for Bruce Willis, Campbell Scott, Lori Singer, and Kristofferson, who moved on to Trouble in Mind immediately after Songwriter. Songwriter included a secondary role for musical star Lesley Ann Warren, who’d costarred in Choose Me that same year and would act again in Rudolph’s delightful but underrated Trixie (2000) and produce Ray Meets Helen nearly two decades later. Here Rudolph ticks off another “indie” box, joining other nonmainstream directors who draw from a personal stable of actors (Altman, John Cassavetes, Hal Hartley). Actors and crew enjoy working with Rudolph, demonstrated not only by returning to work on later projects, but by lowering their usual fee scales to do so. Trouble in Mind, for instance, not only featured two of the leads of Choose Me (Bujold and Carradine), but also its production designer (Steve Legler), first assistant director (Bruce Chevillat), costume designer (Tracy Tynan), and of course, its producers, Carolyn Pfeiffer and David Blocker. Working with people he enjoyed and already knew, Rudolph told me, made Trouble in Mind one of his favorite films to make, and the project, moreover, was unmarred by unexpected financial woes or production troubles—hospitalizations aside.\n\nBy the time of Trouble in Mind, Rudolph had gained a name for himself for making films efficiently: Island Alive films had been impressed by his ability to complete Return Engagement (1983) under time and under budget, making their decision to take on Choose Me easier. Hollywood also took notice, asking Rudolph to replace the director of Songwriter at literally the last minute (he was approached on a Friday and began shootingPage 38 → that Monday). As with Choose Me, efficiency characterized Trouble in Mind’s production: Choose Me had taken one week to write and was shot in three—exceptionally speedy, even by Rudolph’s standards. Trouble in Mind, which he started working on while filming Roadie and Songwriter, had taken him less than six months to complete three script drafts. The first was done in two weeks. He called it “sparse, straightforward,” but knew, as he told Carolyn Pfeiffer, that “we can’t do it straight—it’s been done straight.”18\n\nIn addition to writing most of his own, non-studio, films, Rudolph was hands-on with editing and, more unusually, with the score (he is his own music director), ticking another box that characterizes nonmainstream, independent filmmaking: that of the auteur, in which a singular vision—usually that of a director—leaves its imprint on a film. The term fails to consider the highly collective nature of filmmaking, a feature of the process that is particularly apposite in Rudolph’s case (all colleagues mention the free rein he gives you as soon as he puts his trust in you; it was Carradine’s idea, for instance, to go with the strange look for Coop, and Solo’s character was built in preproduction in collaboration with Morton).\n\nThe concept of auteurism still holds considerable sway in independent cinema, creating director-brands that tell potential filmgoers the kind of films to expect. Auteurist films can also indicate what likely distribution and exhibition paths a film will follow and the kinds of audiences that will be drawn to them in the first place. Conventionally, auteurs are understood to be directors who bring a personal mark to their work—a consistent “vision,” style, or set of themes—and Page 39 →Rudolph has certainly been described this way, with critics labeling his work “dreamlike,” “quirky” “atmospheric,” “stylized,” and so on. Without denying those features, especially regarding his mid-1980s work, such as Choose Me and Trouble in Mind, we should keep in mind that the concept of auteurism fails to capture the teamwork that marks an “Alan Rudolph” production and the collective experience that he values.19 James Schamus, former copresident of the indie company Good Machine, further critiques the concept, questioning its implication that Hollywood is the common enemy. Auteurism, he states, is “a peculiarly romantic (and free-market capitalist) notion of artistic identity, one that posits the heroic individual artist fighting for his vision.”20\n\nWith their broad variation in perceived difficulty, unconventionality, narrative resolution, and structural complexity, Rudolph’s films exemplify independent cinema’s interest in expanding not just the kind of stories that get told, but also how they get told. Some independent films are scarcely different from Hollywood’s; others seem closer to art or experimental cinema. Rudolph’s work enjoys a broad range across this wide, gray area. Trouble in Mind might be said to occupy an indeterminate, middle spot as it asserts his work’s most explicit point of contact with Hollywood—especially old Hollywood—through the stylized genre of film noir. Although Trouble in Mind fits into the category of neo-noir that flourished among studios and independents alike in the 1970s and 1980s, it could just as easily be considered anti-noir, so much does it challenge key generic conventions (in narration, gender, the role of humor). Whether neo- or anti-noir, however, Page 40 →and in both its near-Hollywood and non-Hollywood features, Rudolph’s film uses romance to anchor the film, one with a good old-fashioned triangular structure."
