        "text": "WHEN KEITH CARRADINE and Geraldine Chaplin, the two almost-lovers in \"Welcome to L.A.,\" talk by phone, each looks into a mirror. So does the movie: a very talented effort at very little, a sinewy jaw closing on a noodle, a fashion pose masquerading as a position.\"City of the One-Night Stands\" is the theme song of the film, written and directed by Alan Rudolph and produced by Robert Altman, his mentor. Like \"Shampoo,\" it is about the greed, boredom and decadence of a small, rich and talented cluster of West Coasters. But \"Shampoo\" said, in effect: These are some lives. \"Welcome,\" with far less vitality and with more style than wit, says: This is life.It doesn't make the case. It is a picture that has the smell of a coterie, of inside allusions and illusions, of private jokes or, rather—because there are few jokes—of private hangovers. The film is a very rich man in beautiful clothes telling you what a bad night he's had. You are sorry, but it was his night.\"Welcome\" begins with Carroll Barber (Mr. Carradine), after three years of drifting in Europe, returning to Los Angeles. The return is engineered by his father, Carl (Denver Pyle) a self-made millionaire who wants to bring him into his business. The bait is the offer by a pop singer (played by Richard Baskin who, in fact, wrote the film's songs) to record one of Carroll's pieces. It is a phony offer; paid for, in fact, by Carl.Carroll, rich, languid, untouchable, drifts through, drinking Southern Comfort out of a pint bottle, driving an expansive car with one hand, and sleeping with a succession of frantic women.Why are they frantic? Susan Moore, an agent (Viveca Lindfors) is frantic because she is aging and life is all grappling and no grasp. Ann Goode a real-estate woman played with a kind of defeated enthusiasm by Sally Keller-man, is frantic because her husband sleeps around. Karen Hood (Geraldine Chaplin) is frantic because her husband, Ken, a comically ambitious assistant to Carl Barber, is totally wrapped up in himself.The men, incidentally, are equally frantic, but have a little more breathing space. They need to score instant successes—with sex, work, lifestyle—and flee intimacy. Thy love their wives, but play around on Christmas Eve.We see these things in episodes, sometimes clever, usually well-acted, but excessively contrived. Harvey Keitel as a man twisted out of all shape by the need to succeed—he bounces like Silly Putty—is funny and grotesque, but never touching. Sissy Spacek has a perfectly polished role as a live-in maid who does her vacuuming topless, and entertains clients when Carroll Barber goes out. She adds a corrosive kind of humor to the movie, but no life.The only figure that does have life—in other words, she is not defined completely at her first appearance, but goes on changing — is Karen Hood, played by Miss Chaplin. She rides around in taxis, talking to herself: cultivates an interesting cough, and rather endearingly attributes to Benjamin Franklin, not Goya, the phrase about the sleep of reason producing monsters.The role, as written, is more winsome than moving, but Miss Chaplin gives it a genuine wildness, and a rhythm that sounds like static and feels like electricity. In her absurdly miscalculated relationship with Mr. Carradine she is far better than anything else in the movie.And Mr. Carradine is worse. Perhaps it is the director's fault more than his, but he sinks the film. We see interminable shots of him staring out windows, drooping around, driving. He is sullen and laconic, and we get dreadfully tired of him. He is the equivalent of the Poor Little Rich Girl. His deadness is supposed to be the film's judgment upon the hyperactive life of its characters. But except for Miss Chaplin, the characters are neither alive nor interesting. Mr. Rudolph is mowing down lead soldiers.The songs are a particular torment. The music whines, the lyrics complain, and Mr. Carradine sings them with a kind of hushed writhing, like a worm dying at the bottom of a barrel.\n\nBoring CoterieWELCOME TO L.A., written and directed by Alan Rudolph produced by Robert Altman; director of photography, Dave Myers; music and songs by Richard Baskin; edited by William A. Sawyer and Tom Walls; Released by United Artists. At the Baronet Theater. Running time 105 minutes. This film has been rated R.\n\nBoring Coterie"
