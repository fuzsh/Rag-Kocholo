The film is presented in the aspect ratio of about 1.85:1 on a single layer disc.\n\nIt’s a little smudgy and dull colour wise but generally speaking it looks decent enough. The print is in very good condition with only a few marks marring it. Minor ringing is present and noise is a bit of a problem in darker corners of the screen but the digital transfer itself is pretty clean otherwise, even handling some of the tighter patterns that appear. But the image is never all that sharp and it looks to have been processed over a bit as it can have a waxy look. As well colours are incredibly muted and drab, though this could be intentional, and blacks show some extreme crushing causing details to get lost in darker sequences, making for an incredibly smudgy picture in these cases.\n\nIt looks as though the restoration, if any has been done at all, has been minimal, but the digital presentation, though it could be better, is at least still fairly acceptable.\n\nAudio 6/10\n\nA subtle and very quiet Dolby Surround track is included. I had to crank it but once I did dialogue was fairly clear as was the lounge music that acts as the score. Nothing spectacular but serviceable.\n\nExtras 1/10\n\nA theatrical trailer is all we get here.\n\nClosing\n\nI really wanted to like this but honestly felt the whole thing was a poor man’s attempt at an Altman ensemble film (and ironically enough Altman did produce the film.) There’s a dreamy quality to it that I liked, and L.A. manages to become a sort of living being within the film, but unfortunately I didn’t find much else of interest in its meandering tale of the narcissistic souls who seem to float through. Altman would make the better L.A. odyssey almost 17-years later with Short Cuts I feel.\n\nThe presentation is at least fairly solid if not all that special and on a technical level the disc is fine. Those looking to finally own the film on DVD should be generally pleased with it.\n\nBUY AT:"
