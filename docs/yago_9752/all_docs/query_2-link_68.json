        "text": "When Christopher Gallien went to downtown Lake Elsinore this week, he had no idea he would wind up in a movie.\n\nYet he ended up rubbing shoulders with an acclaimed director and meeting producers and actors.\n\n“I actually came over to work passing out fliers, and some of the assistants asked me to be an extra,” he said. “As far as I know, I’m going to be in the bus scene. It’s a first-time experience.”\n\nMain Street, as well as Graham Avenue and Lakeshore Drive, were transformed into movie sets Tuesday as director Alan Rudolph, along with producers Steven Wolfe and Etchie Stroh, oversaw the shooting of scenes for the independent feature film, “Ray Meets Helen.”\n\n“We hope it will open at a major film festival like Sundance or something like that, if we’re lucky,” Wolfe said.\n\nGiven the credentials of Rudolph, the producers and the starring actors — Sondra Locke, Keith Carradine and Samantha Mathis — there’s a good chance for success.\n\nAmong more than 20 features to his credit, Rudolph has directed such highly regarded pieces as “Choose Me,” “Trouble in Mind” and “The Moderns,” all of which featured Carradine. He has previously collaborated with Wolfe, whose 20-plus credits include “500 Days of Summer” and “Twin Falls Idaho.” Stroh produced “Afterglow,” which Rudolph directed.\n\nIn Lake Elsinore, they were looking for an appropriate setting for several scenes for Helen, played by Locke. She was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actress in “The Heart is a Lonely Hunter” and appeared in six movies with former partner Clint Eastwood.\n\n“We just wanted a real small, quaint town that was representative of the best small town in America,” Wolfe said. “We pulled up photos of Main Street and took a look. It looked even better in person than it did in the photos, so we’re here.”\n\nGiven its proximity to Hollywood, Riverside County is a popular destination for film production. Lake Elsinore has attracted some cinematic interest in the past, going back to the silent movie days. The most famous Elsinore-related film was the cult classic documentary on off-road motorcycle racing, “On Any Sunday,” which featured Hollywood celebrity Steve McQueen and motocross superstar Malcolm Smith.\n\nCity Special Events Coordinator Melissa Houtz said the city receives frequent inquiries about filming, but mostly for commercials and television shows. The A&E network’s “Storage Wars” series included a couple of episodes in Lake Elsinore.\n\nThe city does not have a film permit fee, but works with productions to lessen impacts.\n\nIn all, 10 scenes were produced in Lake Elsinore for “Ray Meets Helen,” in which about 30 technicians and 15 extras participated. The scenes included one in which Helen enters the 92-year-old Cultural Center doubling as a bank and another in which she walks past The Chimes, the nearly 130-year-old structure that once housed the Crescent Bath House. The activity brought a liveliness to downtown not typically encountered on a Tuesday.\n\n“I think it’s awesome,” said Angie Due, proprietor of the Main Street shop, The Mindful Lotus. “It’s exciting and it brings some publicity to our small town. If Hollywood’s willing to come here, why not others? I love it.”\n\nWolfe and company took a break from the shooting at one of Main Street’s mainstay restaurants.\n\n“Cast and crew had a nice lunch together at Guadalajara Mexican Cantina,” he said.\n\nThis story has been modified to correct spelling of Locke’s name, her status as an Academy Award nominee, Rudolph’s previous collaborations with Wolfe and spelling of a restaurant’s name."
