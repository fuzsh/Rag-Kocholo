Yet it was by no means faultless and as the pages from 1 to 276 were electrotyped, it was no easy task to correct every mistake. But at great expense of time, labor, and money, all errors of facts and most of the grammatical mistakes have been corrected. Several pages, and even whole articles, have been rewritten. The article on ;\n\nThe First Norwegian Immigration, or The Sloop Fartj^ of 1825, is a new production. Nearly twenty pages of Bibliography and some valuable statistical tables have been added. Pages 291-364, dealing with Scandinavian settlements, churches, and schools, in Minnesota, are new matter, prepared for this edition and the balance of Vol. ;\n\nI.\n\nconsists of biographies of Scandinavians in Minnesota,\n\nmost of which appeared\n\nin the first edition; but all of them have been rewritten, rearranged, and brought up to date. In fact, the revision and reconstruction of the whole first volume have been so thorough and complete that in many respects it is an entirely new history of the Scandinavians in America, brought up to the beginning of the twentieth\n\ncentury.\n\nThe first edition of the second volume was issued so recently (in 1897) and prepared with such great care that hardly any changes were made up to page 236, except in regard to the arrangement of the biographies. The rest of IX\n\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION But owing to the lack of appeared in the first which space, several biographies edition had to be omitted, and some were .very much the\n\nwork was\n\nreset altogether.\n\nabridged.

Hence, the record of such individuals necessarily has to be an important feature of Scandinavian-American history. Partly to sell my work, and partly to secure the most reliable information on historical and biographical topics, I have personally visited all the counties and cities in Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin where any considerable number of Scandinavians reside. In selecting and editing the biographies as well as in preparing everything else for this work I have endeavored to be impartial. It has been my aim not to be influenced by any religious belief, national prejudice, political conviction, or personal friendship or dislike. In cases where I felt that I might be liable to lean toward one side or another, some of the editors or revisers, whose opinions differed from mine, this country.\n\nis\n\nâ€”\n\nwere consulted.\n\nTo\n\nstate the\n\nunadorned\n\nâ€”\n\nfacts,\n\nwithout\n\nlite-\n\nrary display or expression of judgment, has been the constant endeavor in regard to the biographical sketches. Yet sometimes it was almost necessary to pass judgment on a man's standing within a certain sphere, and I have not shrunk from doing so, or from permitting it to be done, whenever it seemed advisable or desirable, and when the opinions expressed were by general consent considered to be true. No one has been allowed to write his own biography, even the editors of, and contributors to, this work having been subjected to this rule. The parties themselves, how-\n\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION ever, when living, have been permitted to examine their biographies in regard to the facts; but the language used, the views expressed, and the method of treatment, are strictly our own. The proper equilibrium of modesty and self-esteem is a difficult virtue to attain, and some of our Scandinavian-Americans are sadly deficient in this respect. One man, whose chief merit apparently consisted in having been in the lower branch of the legislature a couple of terms, was indignant because his biography did not begin thus: \"Hon. is one of the most popular and active Repub.\" licans in the state of A much larger percentage, however, go too far in the other direction. For an historian to avoid the sins of commission and omission under such circumstances, and at the same time not to offend people, is a Herculean task. Consequently, the biographies of living men are more or less unsatisfactory. At the same time the great pains which have been taken with the biographies, some of which have been revised by half a dozen different parties, ought to make them exceptionally reliable. In regard to the spelling of the geographical names in the Scandinavian countries, the postoffice directories of Den-\n\nmark, Norway, and Sweden have been carefully consulted, and in most cases the latest mode of spelling has been followed. The radical changes in spelling which have been adopted by the government of Norway in recent years has a comical side in connection with this work, namely, that several educated Norwegian-Americans do not know^ how to spell correctly the name of their own birthplace. Whenever possible, not only the forsaxnling or prestegjeld\n\nwhere a person was born has been mentioned, but also the stift or province, and of course the country this was necessary because several places in the North have the same name; for example, there are in Sweden over 50 places ;\n\nXI\n\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION stated that a of the Scandione person has received a college education in navian countries, it is meant that he has completed a course at one of the eJezaentar Mrovarken in Sweden or the Latin schools of Denmark or Norwayâ€”the names of these institutions cannot be properly translated, but the best equivalent for them is college. Nearly all the names of newspapers and books, as well as foreign words, have been called Saby,\n\nand 75 Berg.\n\nWhenever\n\nit is\n\nprinted in Italics.\n\nyears past numerous attempts have been made both in the English and the Scandinavian languages, to elucidate certain features of the life of the Scandinavian- Americans. Many of these productions were meritorious, and a few of them are standard works as far as they go. Among the men making these attempts\n\nFor\n\nby\n\nfifty\n\ndifferent parties,\n\nwere several\n\nwho by intellectual endowment and\n\nthorough-\n\nness of education were well prepared to undertake and successfully complete their task. Yet, apparently, none of these productions have received sufficient recognition and\n\nsupport to enable any one of the many ScandinavianAmerican writers to devote time and talent to extensive historical research concerning their countrymen on this side of the Atlantic. That I have been enabled to devote several years to historical investigations, to meet the various and often heavy expenses connected with the preparation and publication of such a large work, and to make a living out of the sale of the book, seems to indicate that my labors are appreciated. This appreciation has not only been manifested by a courteous reception of the author wherever he has traveled, and by a flattering endorsement of his work, but by a generous financial patronage, sometimes involving considerable sacrifice on the part of the admirer of the enterprise. The keen interest which the XII\n\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION Scandinavian-Americans, especially the clergj^, have taken in the history, has incited the author to greater\n\neducated\n\nexertion in the prosecution of his labor. I am indebted to so many people for the successful completion of this edition that it is beyond my power to give fall credit to all those who have assisted me in the undertaking. Special mention, however, should be made of Consul G. N. Swan, Rev. Adolph Bredesen, Ernst Skarstedt, Rev. C. M. Esbjorn, and J. J. Skordalsvold, who have carefully and critically revised several important articles and rendered valuable assistance in the completion of the Bibliograpbjr. The last mentioned has also revised and read proof of the whole work, and without his able aid it might not have appeared in its present form. Elias Anderson and F. L. Tronsdal have taken more than ordinary wife has looked after the interest in the enterprise. purely artistic part of the work. I am also under obliga-\n\nMy\n\ntion to the Lumberman Publishing Company, the typesetter; the Tribune Job Printing Company, who have done the press work; Bramblett Beygeh, the engravers; and A. J. Company, the binders. Dahl Owing to the magnitude of the labor and expense involved in completing this edition, a few years may pass before I shall be able to prepare and publish the third volume, which no doubt will deal with Illinois and some neighboring states. Partly on account ol having different writers to prepare the various articles, no absolutely uniform system of\n\n&\n\n&\n\nand punctuation has been maintained work. Yet the exceptions to the rigid \"Rules of Nelson and Skordalsvold\" are few and unimportant. Sometimes in quoting from another author, it was\n\ncapitalization\n\nthroughout\n\nthis\n\ninconvenient to use his exact language. XIII\n\nIn such cases the\n\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION single quotation mark ( ) has been employed to indicate that the expression is not my own. As has been said before, no literary brilliancy has been attempted. Hamlin Garland remarked recently: \"I believe the -well-educated descendants of the Scandinavian settlers of the Northwestern states are closer to Webster's dictionary to-day than are the languid Southerners, or the erudite Easterners.\" If his assertion be true, I may entertain the hope that the language used in this work is tolerably correct, because the classes of people he refers to have written or revised a large portion of it. The greatest master of history, Edward Gibbon, says, \"Diligence and accuracy are the only merits which an historical writer may ascribe to himself.\" Another celebrated writer, James Clark Ridpath, asserts, \"The historian must either lay down his pen or cease to be a partisan;\" and on the altar of Diligence, Accuracy, and Impartiality I have laid down the best fruits of my labor.

The very fact that the Scandinavians have, by the might of their swords, crowned and dethroned foreign rulers; dictated terms to popes and emperors; fought, both for and against, the liberties of men; and in many other ways taken an active part in the affairs of the world, must have had a great influence upon civilization.

The Romans, who had at first assailed the domains of the barbaric Teiitons beyond the river Rhine, were in the third and fourth centuries of this era called upon to defend their own territories against the invasion of the very same barbarians whom they had been unable to conquor or subdue.

Time rolled on; for centuries the Roman world â€”yea the world itselfâ€”was hidden in darkness. For this wholesale barbarization the Romans themselves were partly responsible. They lacked the frankness, manliness, honesty, and virtue requisite to preserve sufiicient moral power to govern decently a great state. The old civilization which Rome represented had lost its force. The Roman believed in nothing. Right and wrong were only relative terms. To him anything which succeeded was right, everything which failed was wrong.

The Icelanders created a classical litei'ature from which is received the best information we have in regard to the mythology of the Teutons in general, and of the Scandinavians in particular; established a humanitarian, free republic, on the basis of the Northmen's conception of a civil government, which lasted for nearly four hundred years; discovered America five hundred years before Columbus sailed from Spain, and perhaps\n\n12\n\nHISTORY OF THE SCANDINAVIANS IN THE\n\nU.

During the Viking age the boundary lines between the Scandinavian countries were not sharply drawn. In fact the people were at first tribes; then a great number of petty kingdoms were formed. It was not until the latter part of the ninth century that the present divisions of the Northern nationalities were established, and the Scandinavians continued to speak one and the same language for tw^o or three hundred years later.

Yet it is certain that the Swedes participated less in the destruction, and later in the upbuilding of the western European countries than the Danes and Norwegians. The Danes confined themselves principally to England and France. The Norwegians attended to Scotland, Ireland, and other northern islands. The Swedes, being closed out from the North Sea, went east, where they founded the Russian Empire in the middle of the ninth century, and served in large numbers in the imperial army at Constantinople. The descendants of the Swedish founders of Russia ruled that country until the sixteenth century. In certain parts of Switzerland the people claim, at least they did half a century fore, incorrect\n\nago, that they are descendants of the Swedes.\n\nWhat were\n\nthe causes which produced the Viking age ?\n\nThe answer is\n\nâ€”Although there\n\nFirst\n\nis\n\nevery reason to believe that the\n\nScandinavian countries were a great deal less populous than at present; yet, being poorly tilled, and one man often\n\nhaving children by several women, there were more people than could be supported.

They honestly believed that\n\n\"War was\n\nthe natural condition of\n\nman,\" and that a legitimate reason for declaring hostility was, that those who were attacked had valuable property. After all, this robbery did not differ much from the English opium war, the plundering of Denmark and Prance of their provinces by the Germans, and the treatment of the Indians, Mexicans, and Spaniards by the United States. The Northmen were in a kind of continual state of hostility.

In regard to the ultimate results, and the benefits to the human race which was the consequence of these bloody times, reference has already been made to the state of affairs at and after the fall of Rome.

It is true that they never were very obedient children, and they took the first opportunity offered to be their own masters, yet something had been accomplished.

In Denmark, on the contrary, the peasants became almost slaves of the great landowners. But since 1849 the Danes have virtually enjoyed full universal male suffrage, which none of the other two Northern countries possess. * Yet the king of Denmark has a greater veto-power than the king of Sweden-Norway; consequently the people of the former country have, in reality, less political rights than those of tries,\n\nthe\n\ntwo\n\nlatter.\n\nIn\n\nNorway nature has divided the country managed its own local affairs;\n\ninto great valleys; each valley *In\n\nNorway the\n\nsuffrage\n\nwas greatly extended\n\nia 1808.\n\nâ€” CHARACTERISTICS\n\nSCANDINAVIANS\n\ncommon\n\nthe\n\npeople\n\nAND HISTORY.\n\nknew and cared nothing about\n\n19 the\n\nDanish rulers or the doings of the world, and retained their In Denmark and Sweden feudalism, and patriotism became more general than in aristocracy, Norway.

The country is rich, productive, and thickly settled; consequently, social and financial intercourse is so frequent that the people out of necessity become courteous, refined, enterprising, and broad-mined. This part of the North was first civilized and Christianized. Later, the introduction of feudalism and the enslavement of the peasants could easily be accomplished here, vs-here, unlike Norway and northern Sweden, no great mountain walls and deep fjords defended the weak against the encroachment of the strong.

In actual life they are at present a more modest people. \"There is certainly in this respect a great difference between the three Scandinavian nations. The Swedes have formerly been more aptto go to extremes. Although they are not lacking in any of the more solid qualities of the Danes and Norwegians, they have in their composition more of the French elan than their brethren; and they have at least a certain kind of pushing energy. We shall not attempt to decide whether this is due to the difference in climateâ€” there being in Sweden more of the stirring, continental difference between the seasons, more frequent changes from heat to cold than in Denmark or Norway; or to the accidental his-\n\nSCANDINAVIANS toric\n\nâ€” CHARACTERISTICS\n\nAND HISTORY.\n\n29\n\ndcTelopment which connected Sweden, more than Den,\n\nmark-Norway, with general European politics; or, finally, difiference in race between the remarkably gifted people of the Svear north of the great Swedish lakes, and the Goths and other Scandinavian tribes farther south. The Danes are certainly a people of extreme moderation. They are unbearably conservative in business, where they work respectably, but seldom exert themselves very much. In their religion they rarely show much zeal, although, as a rule, on the other hand, they are far from being professed free-thinkers. In art, their national school copies with truthfulness the characteristics of the country and of the people, but lacks all brilliancy in colors and in ideas. Molesworth, an English ambassador of two hundred years ago, in describing the country and the people, speaks of their extraordinary moderation in virtues as in vices; and thus it certainly cannot be their absolute government which has produced all this respectable mediocrity in the nation. The temperate climate makes one day like another, and their isolated location allows the people to live their own life free from the great European movements. The Norwegians have more earnestness, as their soil and climate are harder and more severe than the fertile Danish country and the moderate Danish climate. But their location has kept them still more apart from general European matters, and their greatness as a seafaring nation can hardly keep up with the changes of the times.

For example, Hans Hansen Bergen, of Bergen, Norway, came with the Dutch emigrants to New York as early as 1633, and became the ancestor of a large American family by that name. In the Dutch colonial and church records he w^as variously called Hans Hansen von Bergen, Hans Hansen de Noorman, etc. He married a Dutch lady, was quite a noted character in those early days, and his namehas, perhaps, been mixed up with the supposed DanishNorwegian colony at Bergen, N.

It is a remarkable fact that the total sum of the Danish emigrants from 1820 to 1840 equals in number the total sum of both the Norwegians and Swedes during the same time; yet the Danish immigration has never been its maximum of nearly 12,000 in 1882, when, on the other hand, 30,000 Norwegians and 65,000 Swedes arrived. Since, the immigration of all the Scandinavi-\n\nvery heavy, reaching\n\nan countries has declined. The Norwegians never exceeded a thousand a year until 1843, the Swedes not until 1852, and the Danes not until 1857. It seems that the early Danish immigrants in this country and the Swedish colonists at Delaware River should have been the means of spreading reliable information in regard to America in their respective countries, and thus become factors in making the emigration from Denmark and Sweden much earlier than from Norway. But it is just the reverse. The Danes, however, have been too busy in re-constructing their affairs at home, and on that account have, probably, been prevented from participating in the movement towards the West. The common people in Sweden knew nothing about the colony at Delaware River, the relation between these settlers and their father-land had virtually ceased before the present century commenced. Such adventurers as Kleng Person came in direct contact with the laboring classes of Norway, and thus hastened the American fever in that country. The Kleng Persons of Denmark and Sweden appeared on the scene much later.

The early colonies of America, for example, the Swedish settlement at the Delaware River in the first part of the seventeenth century, were not private affairs, but national, under the direction of the respective governments; they also differed from emigration. Thegreat stream of human beings who have sought and seek homes on the American continent and in Australia in the nineteenth century are emigrants.\n\nBut if migration,\n\ncolonization,\n\nand\n\nemigration have differed in their nature, the causes which\n\nhave lead the Scandinavians, and to a great extent other people, to participate in these movements have always been the same.\n\nWhat have been the chief motives and main causes which have induced the one-and-a-half million Scandinavians to exchange their northern homes and settle on the wild prairies and in the thick forests of the Western continent in the nineteenth century? First: The Northern countries, on the whole, are barren and unproductive. The wealth, and especially the best part of thelaud, has been, toagreatextent, concentrated in a few hands. And although the Scandinavian countries in many places are not thickly populated, yet the land being poor, unequally divided, and not always cultia large portion of the intelligent, industrious, and prudent classes have been compelled to drag vated to\n\nits fiillest capacity,\n\nout their lives in poverty.

In Denmark these movements of the people resulted in important changes. Property was revolutionized. The greater part of the land before 1849 belonged to the large estates; the laboring people and tenants, being bound to the soil, were virtually slaves of the great land owners; but since most of the land has passed into the hands of small and middle-sized farms; and classes\n\nthe people\n\nnow exercise a great influence upon all affairs per-\n\ntaining to the government.\n\nmark\n\nThis reconstruction of Den-\n\nno doubt, hindered the Danish emigration, which 1880 did not reach 5,000 in number a year, and has\n\nhas,\n\nbefore\n\nnever exceeded 12,000 annually.\n\nIn southern Sweden, how-\n\nan attempted revolution failed totally; some of the drunk when action was necessary. But on the whole little has been attempted or accomplished by revolutionary movements to better the economical conditions of the Scandinavians at home. Nor can it be denied that feudalism, a strong central government, a mistaken idea of patriotism, the great distinction between the classes, the religious belief that the superiors must be obeyed in all things, and the continuous preaching of contentment by the clergy to the masses, had induced the descendants of the independever,\n\nleaders got\n\nent Vikings to submit slavishly to'the condition of things.\n\nBut the\n\nspirit of freedom was not dead, it only slept.

Class opposed class. The clergy, the school, the press, and the upper classes leagued together in opposing the whole emigration movement. The clergy maintained that to emigrate to a foreign country was a sin against the fourth commandment \"Honor thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God commandeth thee that thy days may be long, and that it may go vrell with thee upon the land which the Lord thy God gi veth thee \" But these pious men omitted to mention that their God had brought his chosen people out of thebondage of Egypt. In the public schools, children were taught that to emigratew^asa crime against patriotism. The press ridiculed the whole movement and published the contributions from Scandinavian-Americans only as a matter of curiosity, and as a specimen of American mendacity. Scandinavian travelers, tourists, and those who had ruined their financial and social conditions in the old country, often went to the United States and described in the newspapers at home the sufferings and horrors which awaited the emigrants, and the barbarity of the American nation.

It became a fashion. Smith, in his book Emigration and Immigration, says \" Emigration is sometimes spoken of as if it were simply the operation of an individual coolly and rationally measuring the advantages to be gained, and thus advancing his own ecconomic condition and that of the country to which he comes. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Emigration proceeds now under the numerous influences, the efforts of steamship companies, the urging of friends and relations, the assistance of poor law authorities and charitable societies, and the subtle but powerfial influence of popular delusion in regard to the New World.\" Another authority, speaking the United States, then the emigration\n\nespecially in regard to the ScandinaNian emigration,\n\nwhich Smith does not, although his assertions apply to it as well as to others, writes \"With a few minor exceptions the whole movement has been unorganized, though agents of steamship and railway companies, and even some of the states, have systematically worked up immigration sentiment in the :\n\nNorthlands.\"\n\nThere are certainly very few Scandinavian paupers and criminals -who have, as has been the practice in other European countries, and especially in England, been sent to foreign countries\n\nby the government,\n\ncharitable associations.\n\nlocal communities, or\n\nYet, in by-gone days, philanthro.\n\nHISTORY OF THE SCANDINAVIAN IMMIGRATION. pic societies in\n\nSweden have paid the passage to America\n\n45 of\n\nliberated criminals.\n\nTo sum up half million\n\nthe causes which have induced one-and-a-\n\nNorthmen\n\nto emigrate to the United States\n\nin the nineteenth century, the main reason has at\n\nbottom been the same as that which produced the Viking age, namely, materia/ betterment.\n\nreUgious, social,\n\nwas the case with the Northmen, and adventure, especially as the unjust\n\nYet, as\n\nthe love for freedom\n\nand\n\npolitical conditions\n\nhave been rather\n\noppressive to the middle and laboring classes, has, during\n\nthe whole history of the Scandinavian emigration, been a pow-\n\npromoting the movement. It was adventurand those who were hostile to all class distinction, that gave the first impulse to the movement, and may be said to have directed the Northern immigrants towards the Northwest. While, as veas the custom in the heroic age of the ninth and tenth centuries, the spirit of the time and the fashion of the age have in latter years induced many young people in the Scandinavian countries to court dangers and turn the wheel of fortune in foreign lands. The man who dared to leave his native country has always been admired for his courage and bravery, although his motives have often been questioned. To emigrate has of late been looked upon as the proper thing to do for those who were ambitious and possessed sufficient energy to become successful in foreign lands.
