        "text": "4.3 EU regulation of relevance for common Nordic initiatives\n\nEU’s Single Aviation Market\n\nSince 1996, all member state airlines have unlimited cabotage rights in other member states, i.e. unlimited rights to also operate their business within other member states’ territorial borders. EU’s Single Aviation Market means that all member states have “the nine freedoms of the air”. This includes the right of foreign airlines to offer flights on domestic routes. Investors may invest freely in airlines across the EU (European Commission, 2015).\n\nVAT is not levied on international aviation to and from EEA countries. Passenger taxes are implemented in Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom (Amsterdam economics & CE Delft, 2019; Faber & Huigen, 2018). If an EEA country introduces passenger taxes, they have to be uniform for the whole EEA area (e.g. Faber & Huigen, 2018).\n\nEU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)\n\nEU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) outlines that within the sectors that are covered by it, emissions are to be reduced by 43% in the period from 2020 to 2030, compared to 2005. The amount of quotas/emission allowances is reduced by 2.2% every year (called the linear reduction factor). A business within the included sectors polluting more than the emission allowances that it has been issued, has to either reduce its emissions or buy emission allowances from other businesses covered by the EU ETS, while a business pollutes less than its allowances can sell them. The idea of this market driven system is that the yearly reduction will be made by industries and companies where it is cheapest and thereby minimize the total reduction costs of achieving the reduction set out by the linear reduction factor.\n\nThe economic crisis starting in 2008–2009 created a large oversupply of EU ETS allowances, leading to very low allowance prices for several years. The price of an allowance was around 3 Euros per tonne CO2 at the lowest in periods between 2016–2017 before the system was reformed in November 2017 (Ministry of Transport, 2019). It is currently (August 2020) around 25 Euros a tonne CO2 (Ember, 2020).\n\nAs a consequence of the allowance surplus, 900 million emission allowances were \"back-loaded\" from the EU ETS in 2014–2016 to increase the emission allowance prices and transferred to a Market Stability Reserve, which began operating in 2019. The Market Stability Reserve (MSR) improves the system's resilience to major shocks by adjusting the supply of allowances to be auctioned each year (European Commission, 2020e).\n\nAviation within the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) was included in the EU ETS from 2012. Only CO2 emissions are targeted by EU ETS, and not the climate impact from contrails etc. All flights within the European Economic Area are regulated by the EU ETS. However, most emissions allowances to the aviation sector in EU ETS, 82%, were from 2013, and are until the end of 2020 (the third EU ETS phase), granted to the airlines for free. Only 15% are auctioned, and the 3% were set aside in a special reserve (European Commission, 200x; Ministry of Transport, 2019; Schuknecht, 2019). From 2012 until 2023, all flights to and from the EU are exempted from the EU ETS. After this, the situation will be reviewed.\n\nThe EU ETS has led to reduced GHG emissions from aviation in Europe by 17 million tonnes yearly, according to the European Commission (2020g).Compared to a situation with the ETS. Nevertheless, CO2 and NOx emissions from aviation in the EU have grown significantly from 2012 onwards (EEA et al., 2019 p. 25).\n\nThe aviation industry currently receives a higher amount of free allowances than the other industries included in the third phase: Power generators do not receive any free allowances, while the manufacturing industry in 2013 received 80% free allowances, which was gradually reduced to 30% in 2020 (European Commission, 2020d).\n\nFrom 2012 until 2020, the airline operators have been granted the same number of EU ETS emission allowances, meaning that all additional emissions would have to be covered by airlines’ buying of EU ETS quotas at auction or from the market (European Commission, 2018). From 2021 until 2030, in the fourth EU ETS compliance period, the EU ETS quotas to the aviation sector for intra EEA flights will be reduced by 2.2% per year, i.e. the linear reduction factor in the EU ETS will also be applied to aviation. This will contribute to pushing the price of the ETS emission quotas/allowances upwards.\n\nThe current EU legislation on aviation will last until 2023. Dependent on the development of CORSIA, the EU legislation on aviation may be changed after that year (European Commission, 2018). There are different options as to the relationship between EU ETS and CORSIA in the future, and that no option has been chosen yet (Rothenberg, 2019).\n\nEnvironmental organizations in Europe, like Transport & Environment are highly skeptical to CORSIA’s potential effects on EU’s GHG emissions: They argue that if CORSIA would be implemented in the EEA instead of EU ETS and other EU legal frameworks that, it would lead to a significant increase of GHG emissions from the aviation sector from 2021-2030: increases by 683.8 million tonnes CO2 (T&E, 2019). The argument is that EU has agreed on total emissions amounting to maximally 111 million tonnes CO2 from all outbound aviation from EEA airports for the 2030 emissions reduction target. In 2017, total EU emissions were 174 million tonnes CO2, thus the EU target is requiring a reduction of 36% GHG emissions from 2017–2030 (T&E, 2019).\n\nThe Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in the European Parliament and the European Commission has asked member states not to accept CORSIA’s exclusivity clause in order to protect the EU ETS and keep up the environmental ambitions for aviation within the EEA (Greenair, 2019). EU negotiators have over several years worked to make CORSIA more ambitious, for example that sustainable fuel should be defined as having at least 30% lower GHG emissions than conventional jet fuel (European Commission, 2020g; European Parliament, 2019; Ministry of Transport, 2019).\n\nAccording to our interviewees, various CORSIA member states have voiced criticism towards the EU ETS in CORSIA and argued that the EU by having EU ETS that includes the aviation sector violate their international commitments. Thus, they have threatened to withdraw from CORSIA (Interviews, 2020).\n\nThe Renewables Directive and its update\n\nThe EU Renewable Energy Directive (Renewables Directive, RED I) from 2009 includes sustainability criteria for biofuel (Parliament and Council, 2009). In December 2018, a revised version of this directive (RED II) entered into force (Parliament & Council, 2018), and it is to be implemented in 2020, at the latest by June 2021 by the member states individually. By 2030, 32% of all energy consumed and 14% of the energy used in transport must stem from renewable energy sources. 3.5% of the energy in transport shall stem from advanced biofuels, described as fuels based on waste, residues, e-fuels, renewable electricity and recycled carbon (See RED II, Annex IX, part A for a complete list).\n\nIn the current RED II, the multiplier“The contribution of non-food renewable fuels supplied to these sectors will count 1.2 times their energy content” (European Commission & EU Science Hub, 2019). for advanced biofuel used in aviation is 1.2, so that the member states may more easily reach the target of 14% renewable energy in transport by use of SAF (European Commission & EU Science Hub, 2019). However, since the member states can implement the RED II directive in a number of ways, the present version does not necessarily impact the production and consumption of SAFs and e-fuels in aviation. Thus, there has been a public hearing where stakeholders have been invited to elaborate on various policy measures to enhance production and consumption of bio jet fuel and e-jet fuels for aviation (European Commission & DG Move, 2020).\n\nTo prevent increased demand of renewable energy in the transport sector from having adverse environmental consequences, such as cutting down rain forest to produce palm oil (called indirect land use change, ILUC), both RED I and RED II include sustainability criteria for bioenergy. The member states may only use a certain share of bio energy that are of high risk of ILUC to attain their renewables target in transport. The limits for high ILUC risk bio energy will be gradually stricter: “These limits consist of a freeze at 2019 levels for the period 2021–2023, which will gradually decrease from the end of 2023 to zero by 2030”. Bio based energy sources that have been certified to be low ILUC risk are exempted (European Commission & EU Science Hub, 2019).\n\nStill, the EU has been criticized for its biofuel requirements, which as to date are argued to have contributed to the reduction of significant areas of rainforest/wanton deforestation, because much of the bioenergy used in the EU stems from oil made of palm trees and soybean plants planted after rainforests in for example Indonesia have been cut down to provide for such production (Rainforest Foundation & Cerulogy, 2019).“Avoiding the direct use of palm oil and soy oil as feedstocks can reduce the likely deforestation impact of alternative fuel policies, but due to the connectivity of global vegetable oil markets, any use of food oils as biofuel feedstock is liable to drive some expansion of tropical oil crops, with associated indirect land use change emissions” (Rainforest Foundation & Cerulogy, 2019). Another criticism is that the EUs RED II directive implies that consumption of palm oil will be phased out in the EU by 2030, while there is to date no such phasing out of soybean oil (Rainforest Foundation & Cerulogy, 2019). Critics also claim that implementation of the current version of CORSIA will pose similar risks of adverse consequences as the current RED I and RED II (Ministry of Transport, 2019; Rainforest Foundation & Cerulogy, 2019).\n\nEU’s Energy Taxation Directive, Directive 2003/96/EC\n\nThe Energy Taxation Directive (Directive 2003/96/EC) establishes the minimum excise duty rates that Member States must apply to energy products for fuel and transport, and electricity. However, commercial aviation is exempt from excise duty. In fact, the Directive prohibits fuel taxation for international flights. Member states can tax aviation fuel used for domestic flights and by means of bilateral agreements, also fuel used in intra-EEA flightsEU’s Excise Duty Directive, Directive 2008/118/EC also applies to energy products, thus also aviation fuels. It states formulates that if there is to be a levy, it has to be demanded at the point of sale, i.e. in the moment of fuelling for flying domestically (European Council, 2008; T&E & Hemmings, 2019). (Amsterdam economics & CE Delft, 2019; European Council, 2008; Faber & Huigen, 2018). Norway and Switzerland have domestic aviation fuel charges (T&E & Hemmings, 2019). In addition, some multilateral and most bilateral treaties contain limitations on taxation of fuel (Pirlot & Wolff, 2017).\n\nPirlot (2020) comments that the EU’s energy tax policy and EU’s climate objectives are largely detached from each other and lack consistency. Interaction between the policies have no clear rules, particularly the relationship between the Energy Tax Directive and the EU Emissions Trading System.\n\nA revision of the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) is planned as part of the European Green Deal. Proposals for a revision will be presented by the European Commission in the second quarter of 2021 (European Commission, 2020b). The revision will also look at the current tax exemptions for aviation and maritime shipping with the aim that the jet fuel price should reflect its environment and health impact (European Commission, 2019a, p. 10).\n\nThe ETD revision may open up EU-wide taxation of non-sustainable aviation fuel, which could favor SAF and e-jet fuels. If the exemption for aviation fuel tax for intra-EU and international flights is taken out of the Energy Taxation Directive, the minimum tax would be 33 Eurocents a liter of jet fuel. Foreign airlines from states that the EU has air service agreements with will have to be exempted until the agreements have been renegotiated (Hemmings et al., 2020).Assessment by law expert Echard Pache.\n\nReform of the ETD may, however, be hard to attain, because there are clearly divergent opinions on the matter among member states, and because issues related to tax is subject to unanimous decision making in the Council (Amsterdam economics & CE Delft, 2019; Interview consultant, 2020). With continued unanimity voting, a number of EU member states may block it, namely those with peripheral locations, island states, and those that generally are critical to stronger environmental legislation (Amsterdam economics & CE Delft, 2019). There is a suggestion that the voting rules in ETD might be changed to use the ordinary legislative procedure, which requires qualified majority, rather than unanimity voting (European Commission, 2019a, p. 5).\n\nEU’s initiative on sustainable aviation fuels\n\n24 March–21 April 2020, there was a public consultation for a roadmap for SAF, Sustainable aviation fuels – ReFuelEU Aviation organized by the DG Movement in the European Commission. The roadmap deals with how supply and demand of SAF in the EU can be boosted, so as to increase its share of fuel consumption in aviation within EEA. The initiative is part of the work programme for the European Commission and also the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy. The public consultation mentions several measures that may be implemented alone or together with other measures (European Commission & DG Move, 2020, p. 3).This has been called for by the Nordic Initiative for Sustainable Aviation (NISA). These include: SAF blending mandates, revision of the multiplier for aviation in the RED II directive and monitoring of production and use of SAF, develop key performance indicators to assess the effects of SAF policies. The European Commission has planned to adopt the strategy by the fourth quarter of 2020 (European Commission & DG Move, 2020).\n\nB.1 Policy oriented stakeholder initiatives for sustainable aviation\n\nNordic initiatives\n\nNordic Energy Research has organized several activities related to increasing the use of SAF, including organizing several conferences and workshops and commissioning and publishing research on the topic.\n\nNordic Innovation is financing various activities related to making aviation more sustainable, including commissioning research and financing activities like Nordic Network for Electric Aviation.\n\nNordic Initiative for Sustainable Aviation is a Nordic organization that works for making the aviation industry more sustainable, particularly in regard to making the fuel more sustainable. Members are: Air Greenland, Airbus, Atlantic Airways, Avinor, Boeing, Copenhagen Airports, Brancheforeningen Dansk Luftfart, Finavia, Finnish Transport Safety Agency (Trafi), Finnair, International Air Transport Association (IATA), Icelandair, Isavia, Ministry of Transport and Communications of Finland, NHO Luftfart, SAS, SkyNRG, Svenska Flygbranschen, Föreningen Svenska Flyg, Swedavia, Swedish Transport Agency, Trafikstyrelsen (Danish Transport Authority), Sunclass Airlines (Interview NISA, 2020; Nordic Initiative for Sustainable Aviation, 2020).\n\nDenmark\n\nDanish Aviation Association (Brancheforeningen Dansk Luftfart, BDL) has argued for a carbon fund/climate fund to support production of sustainable aviation fuel, to be supported via the airlines’ ticket price, and it is intended to bring in DKK 250–300 million yearly. From 2020, their members will CO2-compensate all inland aviation in Denmark, which is limited compared to that of Sweden, Norway and Finland in number, c.f. Ch. 2. Their target is that Danish aviation at the very latest in 2050 is carbon neutral (BDL, 2019; SAS, 2019a).\n\nLuftfartens klimapartnerskab: In November 2019 the Danish Government asked a group of core stakeholders including the main airlines, Copenhagen Airport, NISA, the Danish Aviation Association, and others to join the so called Luftfartens Klimapartnerskab. The aim was to present their view on how aviation could contribute to reach the Danish climate goals. May 2020 the group presented their report (Luftfartens Klimapartnerskab, 2020). The report aims at a 30% of CO2 emission in 2030 as compared to 2017. As the optimal measure the report recommended a global CO2-tax on aviation, or a European CO2 tax on aviation as a minimum solution. Denmark shall work internationally for such a tax.\n\nHowever, until this is implemented, they recommend that the aviation industry voluntarily establish a non-governmental climate fund (Luftfartens Klimafond), to be financed via passenger fees. The fund shall finance the additional fuel costs of a SAF blending mandate reaching 30% in 2030. The fund is suggested to be funded by a passenger fee of, for example, 20–30 Danish kroner from the passengers departing from Danish airports, which according to their estimations will lead to an income of 500 million Danish kroner. This climate fund shall be used for environmental purposes, like creating demand for sustainable aviation fuels and thus make this production be scaled up. The fund will pay for the difference between the cost of SAF and conventional jet fuel, so that there will be scaled up solutions for production, distribution and purchasing of SAF.\n\nThe climate fund should promote Danish solutions, and thereby contribute to creating new work places, and collaboration between the various sectors, like aviation, waste and agriculture They also plead for a national plan for green electricity and carbon capture and storage (CCS) (Luftfartens Klimapartnerskab, 2020).\n\nFinland\n\nAutumn 2019, more than 50,000 Finnish citizens signed a petition where they asked for a Finnish aviation passenger tax in order to increase the costs of travel by aviation and also to use the revenue for environmental purposes. That means that the Finnish parliament has to consider the case (Teivainen, 2019).\n\nNorway\n\nA representative from the Norwegian Business Association Aviation branch (NHO Luftfart) has voiced the view that there should be established a CO2-fund for bio-jet fuel, modelled after the successful Norwegian NOx-fund, so that the speed of innovation in biofuel production and the commercial production of biofuel in Norway could be established (Norsk klimastiftelse, 2018; Rambøll, 2017). The target of the fund is to bridge the gap between the price of conventional jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nSince the current CO2-tax does not sufficient to cover the extra costs of SAF, the fund should also be financed via the Norwegian passenger tax. Alternatively, the organization could be similar to the current Norwegian NOx-fund. This would imply that the airlines would not have to pay a certain tax if they instead paid a certain amount of money to a privately organized fund for the industry, which could be used to finance sustainable aviation projects (Rambøll, 2017).\n\nBlending criteria for biofuel will also create a market, but also, without additional measures, drive up the costs for the airlines significantly. Regardless of the solution chosen, a criterion would be that the aviation fuel is sustainably produced and not be detrimental for example for food production (Interview NHO Luftfart I, 2020; Rambøll, 2017). The whole aviation industry in Norway has supported this initiative (Interview Avinor 3, 2020). See Chapter 8 for further discussion and elaboration about a CO2/sustainable aviation fund.\n\nSweden\n\nThe interest organization Fossil Free Sweden together with the interest organization Föreningen Svenskt Flyg in 2018 created a plan for how to make aviation in Sweden more sustainable. Here, they also launch two targets:\n\n2030: All domestic air travel shall be fossil free (Föreningen Svenskt Flyg & Fossilfritt Sverige, 2018).\n\n2045: Fossil free international aviation departing from Sweden in 2045 (Föreningen Svenskt Flyg & Fossilfritt Sverige, 2018).\n\nFossil Free Aviation 2045: Their target is to create a Swedish national platform to enable aviation in Sweden to be fossil free by 2045. They aim to achieve collaboration, sharing of knowledge, and synergies between established research institutions and stakeholders working with innovation. Stakeholders for the whole value chain/ecosystem to create fossil free flights are included in the network.\n\nPartners: SAS, Swedavia and RISE (Founders) in addition to flyresor.se, Westander, Sødra, Afry, NISA, Mælardalen Høgskola, Svenska miljøinstitutet (IVL), KLM, European Flight Service (EFS), Cowi, BRA, Bioshare, BIO4ENERGY, Østersund kommun and Neste.\n\nB.2 Initiatives to promote sustainable aviation fuels\n\nInitiatives aimed at passengers\n\nBraathens Regional Airlines /BRA (Sweden) write that they offset GHG emissions for all their flights. This is included in the ticket price. The airline customers may also contribute extra to use bio-jet fuel and other means of emissions reduction through paying 300 Swedish kroner extra. Braathens Regional Airlines also offset emissions for the rest of their operations (Braathens Regional Airlines, 2020; Dahl, 2019).\n\nFly Green Fund (Sweden): Partners are Swedish airport operator Swedavia and SRF (Swedish Regional airports). The founders are Karlstad Airport, SkyNRG, Nordic Initiative for Sustainable Aviation (NISA). Here, airline customers may pay an amount to support the increased use of bio-jet fuels in Sweden. 75% of the revenue goes to the purchase and delivery of sustainable aviation fuels. 25% of the revenue goes to market development and supporting initiatives that contribute to increased market demand and local production of sustainable aviation fuels in Sweden (Fly Green Fund, 2020; Interview NEA, 2020).\n\nFinnair (Finland): The GHG emissions from the corporate customers will be offset from 1. September 2020. Corporate customers will in the future also have the opportunity to reduce their climate footprint through the increased use of biofuel. Their target is to reduce GHG emissions by 50% from the 2019-level by 2025 (Finnair, 2020a). By 2045, Finnair aims to be carbon neutral. The airline has also partnered with biofuel producer Neste to increase the bio-jet fuel production in Finland and increase its share of sustainable aviation fuel (Finnair, 2020b; News Now Staff, 2020). In 2011, Finnair was the second international airline to operate flights using biofuel (Finnish Transport Safety Agency, 2018).\n\nIcelandair (Iceland): Here, passengers may offset GHG emissions by paying extra to support projects for reducing GHG emissions by paying for tree planting to compensate for their GHG emissions (Icelandair, 2020).\n\nNorwegian (Norway): Passengers may offset emissions of greenhouse gases by paying extra. The revenue goes to various climate projects approved by the UN, such as renewable energy projects (Norwegian, 2020).\n\nSAS (Scandinavian): Youth tickets and tickets bought through the Eurobonus programme are automatically climate compensated (Bergskaug, 2020). Customers can, since summer 2019, buy bio-jet fuel comparable to 20 minutes flight time, and may multiply this to pay for the total flight time (SAS, 2020). SAS’ target is that 17% of its fuel is bio-jet fuel by 2030 (Euractiv, 2019).\n\nWiderøe (Norway): lets the customers buy bio-jet fuel when they order tickets (Hjørnevik, 2020).\n\nInitiatives aimed at airlines\n\nAvinor (the state-owned operator of most of the Norwegian commercial airports, operates a total of 46 airports in Norway). In 2016 and 2017, Avinor together with AirBP and several airlines launched blending of biofuel in their airports, amounting to 1,25 million litres, or 0.1% of all jet fuel sold in 2016 in Norway. The first airport was Oslo Airport Gardermoen. In 2017, the scheme was expanded and also included to include Bergen Airport Flesland. This year, there was very limited availability of bio-jet fuel, so only 125 000 liters were blended in. There was also limited volumes sold in 2018. Oslo Airport was the first airport to offer bio-jet fuel on a regular basis and offer jet fuel with bio-jet fuel to all airlines fueling there (Avinor, 2020a; Miljødirektoratet, Avinor, & Luftfartstilsynet, 2018, p. 4).\n\nFor the period 2013–2022, Avinor set aside 100 million NOK for measurements and projects to the introduction of bio-jet fuel in Norway. Together with airlines and the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries (NHO Luftfart), Avinor has explored the potential for establishing the large-scale production of biofuels for aviation using biomass from the Norwegian forestry industry. The conclusion is that this can be realised between 2020 and 2025. Jet biofuel can also be imported from abroad. Avinor has worked with a number of stakeholders on the production of jet biofuel for aviation in Norway. In addition, Avinor supports several research projects related to this, including in collaboration with SINTEF, BI Norwegian Business School, and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (Interview Avinor 3, 2020).\n\nThe sustainable aviation fuel has come from different sources and producers, including hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) produced by Finnish Neste based on camelina oil produced in Spain supported by the EU project Itaka, and HEFA based on used cooking oil (UCO) produced by World Fuels in California and brought to Norway by ship (Interview Avinor 3, 2020). Their target is that 30% of the aviation fuel in 2030 shall be advanced biofuel.\n\nSwedavia (the largest Swedish airport operator, operates 10 airports in Sweden): was the first airport operator to offer bio-jet fuel to airlines that had been stored at the airport. Swedavia has since 2016 bought bio-jet fuel amounting to the same as the fuel for their employees’ flights for business reasons. This amount has been 450 tonnes a year. Now, Swedavia will increase its purchase to 560 tonnes bio-jet fuel yearly. The remaining 110 tonnes of bio-jet fuel will be used by other businesses. Swedavia has set the target that within 2025, 5% of the fuel is to be fossil free (Swedavia, 2019). In 2019, eight Swedavia operated airports in Sweden supplied bio-jet fuel to the airlines.\n\nSveriges regionala flygplatser (Swedish regional airports), include Karlstad Airport. Karlstad airport was the first in the world, in 2014, to deliver bio-jet fuel in the same chain of logistics as the fossil jet fuel (Interview NEA, 2020).\n\nCopenhagen Airports (CPH, Denmark’s largest airport): aims to be emissions free by 2030 (Copenhagen Airport, 2019). The customers of SAS can choose to fly and reduce emissions by the use of bio-jet fuel tanked at CPH, as well as other airports in Scandinavia (SAS, 2019b).\n\nB.3 Research and development initiatives on sustainable aviation fuel\n\nInternational projects with Nordic partners\n\nThe Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) The Nordic members of RSB includes: Neste, Quantafuel, UPM-Kymmene Corporation, Eco-1, Maersk, SAS Tech AB.\n\nRevofuel: https://www.sekab.com/en/products-services/product/rewofuel/\n\nDenmark\n\nAs an agricultural country with strong engineering expertise, a number of projects regarding producing various types of sustainable bio energy fuels and electrofuels have been launched.\n\nMaersk, DSV Panalpina, DFDS, Ørsted, SAS and Copenhagen Airports. Maersk, DSV Panalpina, DFDS, Ørsted, SAS and Copenhagen Airports have joined forces in a partnership that will build a hydrogen plant in the metropolitan area as early as 2023. The factory will be fully expanded by 2030 to supply more than 250,000 tonnes of sustainable fuel for ships, aircraft and road traffic (Friis, Svansø, & Hansen, 2020; Maritime Danmark, 2020).\n\nEUDP (a Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program), Power2Met.

Participants in NEA are: Avinor, Finavia, Swedavia, Swedish Regional Airports, Copenhagen Airports, Air Greenland, Braathens Regional Airlines, Finnair, Heart Aerospace, Icelandair, SAS, El-fly AS, Green Flyway, Nordic Initiative for Sustainable Aviation (NISA), Nordic Innovation, SAS, Green Flyway and RISE.\n\nThis network has four main targets: 1) to standardize the infrastructure for electric airplanes in the Nordic countries, 2) develop business models for regional direct routes between the Nordic countries, 3) develop aircraft technology to meet the weather needs in the Nordics, 4) create a platform for European and global collaboration. The network is funded by Nordic Innovation (NEA, 2020). Their first meeting was held in Östersund in Sweden, December 2019.\n\nGreen Flyway is a project between Avinor, the Røros Region, Østersund Municipality, SINTEF Digital, and Swedish partners like Swedavia Airports. The project leaders are Næringshagen in Røros and Østersund Municipality, while the research partner is SINTEF Digital. They will establish a testing arena for electric aviation, autonomous aircraft (drones), and aircraft control on the route between Røros and Østersund/Åre. This is a little trafficked area. The project is open to all types of electric aircraft, and the project leaders are in dialogue with various developers and manufacturers of electric airplanes (Interview SINTEF Digital, 2020). The winter coldness of the area is regarded as useful, as drones and electric aircraft also needs to be tested under very cold conditions, as batteries have shorter ranges during low temperatures. Green Flyway is supported by EU-funding through an Interreg programme, and also receives Norwegian funding (Avinor, 2019b; Interreg.no, 2020; Jære, 2020).\n\nFinding Innovations to Accelerate Implementation of Electric Regional Aviation (FAIR) is an EU -, nationally and regionally funded project regarding electric aircraft in the Kvarken region in Sweden (Region of Västerbotten) and Finland (Region of Österbotten). The Kvarken Council is coordinating the project. Aims: to gain knowledge about the opportunities of electric aircraft, to enhance the introduction of electric aircraft and start cross border innovation processes. First, there will be a market analysis to describe the regional effects. There will then be a mapping of what is necessary to introduce electric aircraft early in the region. Third, there will be development of new services, products and business models to create added value of the technology both for the private and the public sectors. Partners/receivers of funding are Kvarkenrådet, Umeå University, Vasa University, BioFuel Region, RISE, and Region Västerbotten (Kvarkenrådet & Merenkurkun neuvosto, 2020).\n\nSAS and Airbus collaborate to create electric airplanes. They will have a joint research project to enhance their knowledge about the opportunities and challenges for electric aviation in commercial passenger traffic (SAS, 2019c). Their collaboration continues as previously despite the Covid-19 crisis. They are looking at the specifications about electric airplanes that Airbus could produce, like range, weight, time and ground handling time (Interview SAS, 2020).\n\nSAS, in addition to participating in NEA and collaborating with Airbus, also carries out other activities related to electric airplanes. This including supporting Heart Aerospace through having given them a letter of support and providing them with insight about rules and regulations and other things that are important. SAS is also in dialogue with other Star Alliance partners with similar travel patterns about electric aviation, like partners in Canada and New Zealand. As regards concrete technologies for electric/electrified airplanes, SAS is technology neutral. In the future, SAS will rather accelerate their work with electric airplanes than reduce it. For them, the airplanes’ sizes and capacities will decide when they can be used after they have been certifies. Then envision that they can use airplanes with 50–70 seats and larger when they have been certified, and could need 30-40 airplanes of this size in the future (Interview SAS, 2020).\n\nDenmark\n\nCopenhagen airport would like to see electric airplanes using their facilities. The previously mentioned Smart Airports project includes that the airport must be prepared to handle and be able to charge future electric aircraft (Interview NISA, 2020).\n\nIn the fall 2019, NISA, together with the Engineering Association, Danish Aviation and Copenhagen Airports planned an electric aircraft seminar for the fall 2019. In combination, a Danish electric aircraft initiative was prepared, including the identification of possible routes, cooperation in the Øresund region, Danish and Nordic technology stakeholders. The initiative postponed due to Covid-19, - expected to be initiated in autumn 2020 (Interview NISA, 2020).\n\nThe Climate Partnership for Aviation includes electric aircraft as part of the long-term plan, i.e. mainly after 2030 to reduce the climate impact. (Interview NISA, 2020).\n\nFinland\n\nHelsinki Electric Aviation Association is sponsored by Finavia and Fortum, and is testing a small electric airplane of the type Pipistrel Alpha Electro (Rønningsbakk, 2018). They have arranged conferences and events on the topic of electric and other types of sustainable aviation (MAF, 2020). The organization works with different technologies, including an electric/hybrid powerline, an electric/hybrid seaplane, an electric/hybrid skydiving plane, and is also involved Kvarken area electric passenger airplane study (Interview Helsinki Electric Aviation Association, 2020).\n\nFinavia has started testing flying with small electric airplanes, similar to Avinor (Rønningsbakk, 2018).\n\nNorway\n\nEquator Aircraft is a Norwegian company developing small two-seater hybrid-electric sea airplanes. They have received funding from small investors. They participate in a research project called Flightsmart together with Maritime Robotics, SINTEF and NTNU on developing the technology: automation, a sophisticated and minimalist user interface and aerodynamic cooling (Dalløkken, 2018). Equator Aircraft also collaborate with the Danish company Nordic Seaplanes in developing electric aircraft for passenger transport. The latter company operate commercial sea plane routes between Copenhagen and Aarhus. In the future, they want to have larger aircraft that can fly commercial routes. They think that these aircraft can replace helicopters and other small conventional airplanes. The project is supported by Kjeller Innovation (Bay, 2019).\n\nThe word’s first fully electric commercial passenger route? Avinor, Sparebanken Vest, Berg-Hansen, Aircontact Group and the Business organization in the Stavanger Region (Næringsforeningen i Stavanger-regionen) collaborate to set up the first commercial fully electric passenger route in the World between Stavanger and Bergen. They have established a company called Start Norge AS to achieve this. Their first target was to achieve this within 2023. However, they aim to achieve this as soon as possible, in light of what kind of electric airplanes suitable for passenger transport is available (Interview Aircontact Group, 2020).Personal communication with Aircontact Group, 2020. See also Norum (2020).\n\nA study is commissioned to map the opportunities and challenges by introducing electric airplanes between Stavanger and Bergen. They await the results of this study before conducting further work in the project, as to if the passenger number is large enough, the distance works for electric airplanes, the airports may be able to contribute with the needed infrastructure, and that local business is interested and motivated to contribute to a sustainable change. Their target is to contribute with financing of the airplanes so that the financial risk of the airlines of acquiring electric airplanes is reduced. Aircontact group also envisions that they can take part in the establishment of support functions for electric aviation in the next years. The project collaborators are open to different types of technologies regarding electric airplanes (Interview Aircontact Group, 2020). There is hard competition to be the world’s first all-electric route, and it may well be, that the first all-electric route will be established in Vancouver (Reuters, 2020) or at the Orkney Islands (Sigler, 2019).\n\nAvinor: Stavanger Airport and Bergen Airport are preparing for electric aviation, and plan to install charging infrastructure for electric airplanes (NTB, 2019b). Avinor will contribute with the necessary infrastructure once the electric airplanes are in place (Avinor, 2020b).\n\nElnett21 is a project where they install charging infrastructure, solar panels, battery storage and work with smart electricity use. They are working on micro grids. The area involves Risavika harbor, Stavanger airport (Sola), Sola and Forus Næringspark. Partners are Avinor, Forus Næringspark, Lyse Elnett, Smartly and Stavangerregionen Havn (Elnett21, 2020).\n\nWiderøe and Rolls-Royce Electrical Norway collaborate on developing electric airplanes. They signed an agreement about research collaboration in 2019 (Rolls-Royce, 2019). Rolls Royce delivers the jet turbines to airplane manufacturer Airbus.\n\nWiderøe’s internal project, Project Zero, aims to introduce electric airplanes in Widerøe’s fleet within 2030. More than 30 airplanes, their Dash 8 fleet, are to be changed within 2030, and Widerøe has set the target to have launched commercial zero emission routes within this year. The project is supported by Innovation Norway (Dalløkken, 2019b; Rolls-Royce, 2019). The current crisis caused by COVID-19 has made Widerøe signal that their target for at least one zero emission route within 2030 may have to be postponed. However, the target is still to electrify at least one route within 2030 (Norum, 2020). Widerøe works with different types of electric airplanes, including battery electric, serial hybrid (two motors, with hydrogen fuel cells and gas turbines) and parallel hybrid (combustion engine motor and an electric motor) (Interview Widerøe, 2020).\n\nRolls-Royce Electrical Norway and Airbus collaborate on developing electric aircraft. Rolls-Royce in 2019 bought Siemens’ e-aircraft department, eAviation, located in Munich and Erlangen in Germany and in Budapest in Hungary (Dalløkken, 2019b; Siemens, 2019c; Svensson, 2019). Siemens’ target was to have hybrid electric aircraft with a range of 1000 kilometers within 2030. This will, according to their representatives, suffice to cover 2/3 of all destinations that are directly attainable from Gardermoen by airplane (Siemens, 2019b).\n\nRolls-Royce has a technology department located in Trondheim where a staff of around 50 persons work on developing electric motors and propulsion systems for aviation (Lorentzen, 2019c). Their target is to become the leading supplier of electric and hybrid electric airplane motors (Siemens, 2019c). Rolls-Royce is also developing the electric motor for the luxury commuter aircraft Eviation Alice, which may carry 9 passengers and a staff of 2 (Eviation, 2019; Rolls-Royce, 2019/2020). The aircraft Alice is currently under certification by the Federal Aviation Administration, and the same is the case for Bye Aerospace’s e-flyer.\n\nRolls-Royce Electrical Norway and Airbus collaborated to create the first hybrid electric aircraft in the E-Fan X project. The last phase of this project was cancelled spring 2020. However, Rolls Royce will continue to test the electric motors that it has developed and work on further technology development (Excell, 2020; Norum, 2020).\n\nOSM aviation in 2019 launched an order of 60 electric airplanes from Bye Aerospace, to be used for pilot training in their training schools in the United States, Norway and Sweden. These are to be delivered from the end of 2021. Advantages with these airplanes include very low operating costs, low noise, zero emissions, high speed and good performance at high altitudes (Dalløkken, 2019a; Lorentzen, 2019a).\n\nEl-Fly AS (Elfly AS), located in Bergen, also launched an order of 18 small electric aircraft from Bye Aerospace in 2019, to be used for commercial operations, like training of pilots or other purposes, like tourist sightseeing, air taxiing or for flight clubs (El-fly AS, 2020; Lorentzen, 2019b). They want to stimulate so that electric airplanes are used as early as possible.\n\nAvinor, the operator of most Norwegian airports, has been working on electric aviation since 2010. In 2015, the Norsk Luftsportforbund and Avinor started collaborating on electric aviation. In 2016, Avinor organized an environmental conference Zerokonferansen, where Airbus presented their work on electric aviation.\n\nAvinor also participate in or has launched a number of other initiatives and projects. Their interest is all types of electric airplanes with fixed wings (as opposed to rotors) that may be used for the Norwegian short-haul airports, primarily with airplanes with 19 seats or upwards. The airport operator is also, together with Norsk luftsportforbund, is testing to fly with small electric airplanes of the type Pipistrel Alpha Electro. This airplane has been used in various airplane shows in Norway before it had an accident and had to be repaired (Avinor, 2020b).\n\nAvinor has contributed to setting electrification of aviation on the public agenda in Norway in numerous ways. The company has set the target that all domestic aviation is to be electric within 2040, and that the GHG emissions from domestic aviation will be reduced with 80% within this year. To stimulate electrification, Avinor has promised that small electric airplanes will be free of charges and receive free electricity at their airports until 2025. To prepare for electric aircraft, Avinor is the first half of 2020 mapping the existing electricity infrastructure at all their airports in order to prepare for future electrification of the aircraft (Avinor, 2020b).\n\nAvinor and the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority (Luftfartstilsynet) March 2020 launched a report where they suggest how electric airplanes can be introduced to commercial aviation (Avinor & Civil Aviation Authority, 2020). Here, they recommend that “Norway should be one of the main areas in the world for the electrification of air travel”, Avinor CEO Dag Falk-Petersen note. This may be attained via development, testing and using electrified aircraft early (CAA Norway, 2020).\n\nThey recommend that objectives set by the government should be that: a) by 2030, the first electrified aircraft (i.e. fully electric of hybrid electric) should carry passengers in ordinary scheduled routes, b) within 2030, all inland aviation transport within Norway should have electrified aircraft. To attain these targets, many measures are needed. These include incentives for technology development, support for investments, and beneficial operating conditions. Technology development could be attained via establishing an international test center for electric aviation in Norway, and an international cooperation forum (CAA Norway, 2020).\n\nInvestment support could include for example support schemes when airlines are purchasing new airplanes. The same is the case for schemes to establish aircraft charging infrastructure. Light aircraft should have an exception for VAT. To make electric aviation attractive for the ordinary customers, the ticket prices must be cheaper than the tickets for flying with ordinary airplanes. This can be achieved, for example, by VAT exception or reduction until 2040 on passenger aircraft, exemption or reduction of the passenger tax until 2040, lower take off charges at Avinor’s airports, and reduction of the electricity tax for electric airplanes in ordinary traffic (CAA Norway, 2020). Their report is on a public hearing until August 2020. Link: The Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, Avinor, Widerøe, Safran, Airbus, Leonardo/ATR, and EASA on collaborate the topic electric aviation in a high-level task force. By summer 2020, they write that they will launch a roadmap for “innovation related to zero and low-emission regional aircraft” (CAA Norway, 2020).\n\nAvinor and SINTEF in 2020 signed an agreement to collaborate on electric airplanes, efficient, secure and sustainable aviation. The collaboration will include participating in joint research projects, that employees will have the chance to work at each other’s places, and that research results are commercialized (SINTEF, 2020).\n\nThe University of Tromsø (UiT) has acquired two electric airplanes of the type Pipistrel Alpha Electro for research purposes. Their branch University of Tromsø School of Aviation (UTSA) collaborates with the research center Arctic Centre for Sustainable Energy (ARC) in making aviation as sustainable as possible. They want to test the battery capacity of their electric airplanes and how they are to fly. However, so far, they have not been flown a single time, because they await the certification of the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, expecting it by the end of June 2020. The electricity fueling the airplanes are primarily created by the university’s own solar cell panels, and they have 100 square meters of solar panels to generate electricity. This may also be helpful in discovering the opportunities for local generation and energy storage at other airports for electric aviation, as there are large surfaces where solar panels may be installed (Interview UiT flight school, 2020).\n\nUiT flight school is the only public flight school in Norway. In the future, they want to use the electric airplanes in their pilot training and want to have them introduced as early as possible after they have received ordinary certification (Interview UiT flight school, 2020; NTB, 2019a; Wangen, 2018). One hour of flying with a conventional little airplane, like their Cessna 182 demands 40–50 liters of jet fuel and thus costs about 700 NOK per flight hour. With an electric airplane like Pipistrel, the energy cost per hour could be reduced to 20 NOK or less. In addition, the electric airplanes are much cheaper to maintain. The Cessna 182 needs a good round of maintenance every 50th flight hour, while the electric small airplanes need maintenance every 100th flight hour, and then will need very small adjustments. UiT flight school will also start the world’s first master study within aviation, with a particular focus on electric aviation (Interview UiT flight school, 2020).\n\nThe Norwegian political parties: Electric aviation receives broad political support in Norway. February 2020, Centre Party representatives launched an initiative in the Norwegian Parliament regarding improvement of the aviation offer from the Norwegian short-haul airports. This included measures that would stimulate the introduction of electric airplanes in Norway: changing the fees to stimulate the development and introduction of electric airplanes and making the airports ready for electric airplanes (Stortinget, 2020). The case was debated in the Norwegian Parliament on 26 May 2020, and their requests were turned down (Stortinget, 2020).\n\nThis does not imply that there is little interest in the topic. The government wanted a thorough discussion of the issue in relation to the national transport plan. The last government and the current government have had electrification of aviation in their platforms, and also asked Avinor and the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration to create a program for the introduction of electric aircraft.\n\nSweden\n\nElectric Aviation in Sweden (ELISE): is funded by the Swedish innovation agency Vinnova. They are, according to their own web page, building an electric aircraft in collaboration with a number of universities and other research institutions and the Civil Aviation Administration (Elise, 2020). Aircraft manufacturer Heart Aerospace is also a member.\n\nSwedavia Airports launched a strategy for electric aviation February 2020. All 10 airports they operate shall be made ready to have electric commercial routes within 2025. Swedavia works for fossil free domestic aviation within 2030. They are also a participant in the aforementioned Green Flyway project. The testing of drones and electric airplanes between Røros and Öresund is planned to start autumn 2020. Umeå airport is participating in a project where they assess the opportunities for electric aviation between Finland and Sweden (Swedavia Airports, 2020b).\n\nSwedish Regional Airports, by member Skellefteå Airport, have strategies for electric aircraft. It is made ready to have electric airplanes there for testing (Flyg24Nyheter, 2020; Interview NEA, 2020).\n\nHeart Aerospace is developing a 19-seater battery electric aircraft, to travel 400 kilometers, and aims to have it launched within 2025 (Heart Aerospace, 2019). 19 seat airlines are not subject to the same certification criteria as aircraft with more than 20 seats and are thus simpler to certify. A number of Nordic airlines have signed letter of intents, amounting to 127 airplanes altogether. 2/3 of their funding is from private investors and 1/3 of the funding is from public agencies. Heart Aerospace works with a number of research and innovation projects. Their aircraft uses a traditional aluminum frame. The motor and other systems, they design themselves, and have subcontractors as suppliers. The largest cost of developing the airplane is to achieve certification, and this is a very costly process (Interview Heart Aerospace, 2020). They say that the COVID-19 crisis has delayed some of their equipment suppliers, and that they thus are some months behind schedule (Norum, 2020).\n\nKatla Aero is developing small battery electric airplanes. Their aircraft can be manned, unmanned, and carry up to two passengers or 200 kilos (Katla Aero, 2020).\n\nResearch Institute of Sweden (RISE) is participating in a number of projects on electric aviation, including ELISE, NEA and FAIR. Recently, they launched an internally financed strategic initiative on electric aviation. Here, anybody within the organization that is interested in the topic may meet and creates a link to the ongoing external projects. The initiative, called Electric Flight Systems, aims to address not only the development of the actual airplanes, but also to take a holistic research approach on the possibilities and challenges associated with a systematic introduction of electric aviation in the overall transportation ecosystem (Interview RISE, 2020)."
