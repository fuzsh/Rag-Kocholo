        "text": "When we interact with others, we make inferences about their internal states (i.e., intentions, emotions) and use this information to understand and predict their behavior. Reasoning about the internal states of others is referred to as mentalizing, and presupposes that our social partners are believed to have a mind. Seeing mind in others increases trust, prosocial behaviors and feelings of social connection, and leads to improved joint performance. However, while human agents trigger mind perception by default, artificial agents are not automatically treated as intentional entities but need to be designed to do so. The panel addresses this issue by discussing how mind attribution to robots and other automated agents can be elicited by design, what the effects of mind perception are on attitudes and performance in human-robot and human-machine interaction and what behavioral and neuroscientific paradigms can be used to investigate these questions. Application areas covered include ...\n\nSocial robots need intelligence in order to safely coexist and interact with humans. Robots without functional abilities in understanding others and unable to empathise might be a societal risk and they may lead to a society of socially impaired robots. In this work we provide a survey of three relevant human social disorders, namely autism, psychopathy and schizophrenia, as a means to gain a better understanding of social robots’ future capability requirements. We provide evidence supporting the idea that social robots will require a combination of emotional intelligence and social intelligence, namely socio-emotional intelligence. We argue that a robot with a simple socio-emotional process requires a simulation-driven model of intelligence. Finally, we provide some critical guidelines for designing future socio-emotional robots.\n\nSocial robotics entertains a particular relationship with anthropomorphism, which it neither sees as a cognitive error, nor as a sign of immaturity. Rather it considers that this common human tendency, which is hypothesized to have evolved because it favored cooperation among early humans, can be used today to facilitate social interactions between humans and a new type of cooperative and interactive agents – social robots. This approach leads social robotics to focus research on the engineering of robots that activate anthropomorphic projections in users. The objective is to give robots \" social presence \" and \" social behaviors \" that are sufficiently credible for human users to engage in comfortable and potentially long-lasting relations with these machines. This choice of 'applied anthropomorphism' as a research methodology exposes the artifacts produced by social robotics to ethical condemnation: social robots are judged to be a \" cheating \" technology, as they generate in users the illusion of reciprocal social and affective relations. This article takes position in this debate, not only developing a series of arguments relevant to philosophy of mind, cognitive sciences, and robotic AI, but also asking what social robotics can teach us about anthropomorphism. On this basis, we propose a theoretical perspective that characterizes anthropomorphism as a basic mechanism of interaction, and rebuts the ethical reflections that a priori condemns \" anthropomorphism-based \" social robots. To address the relevant ethical issues, we promote a critical experimentally based ethical approach to social robotics, \" synthetic ethics, \" which aims at allowing humans to use social robots for two main goals: self-knowledge and moral growth.\n\nThis paper urges that if we wish to give social intelligence to our agents, it pays to look at how we acquired our social intelligence ourselves. Our drives and motives are innate and deeply social. Next, as children we are social-ized to acquire norms and values. This motivational and group-based life is the core of our being in the real world. As a consequence, economic rationality or logical reasoning will only take agents so far when it comes to social intelli-gence. In order to advance our understanding of social intelligence, and to build socially versatile agents, we need to complement our attention for the ‘what’ and ‘how’ with attention for the ‘why’ and ‘with whom’. Basic features of our social behaviour, of the kind that one sees early in the lives of children, need to be prominent. These include basic drives, such as avoidance and fear, approach and love, aggression when thwarted. They also include recognizing distinctions relevant to those drives, such as big and small,..."
