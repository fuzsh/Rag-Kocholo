Witnesses told authorities the UTV was \"driving down the middle of the roadway at highway speeds\" before the crash, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nFirst responders found the pickup truck and UTV in a ditch. The UTV was on fire, and witnesses had already pulled two women from it. The sheriff's office said both women died at the scene.\n\nThe 57-year-old man driving the pickup suffered minor injuries \"as a result of the crash and efforts to aid the victims in the UTV,\" the sheriff's office said."
