        "text": "When you are admitted as a student at Blekinge Institute of Technology, you must make an online application or contact housing companies available in Karlskrona in order to find accommodation. We highly recommend that you start looking as soon as possible after receiving your admission letter to avoid having to stay a considerable time in a hostel before you can get a student room.\n\nTo make the process of finding accommodation as easy as possible, we have gathered a list with links to housing companies, private landlords, and other accommodation possibilities.\n\nIf you have questions concerning accommodation, please contact:\n\nBTH Student Union at bostad@bthstudent.se, or visit their website\n\nBTH’s Accommodation coordinator at accommodation@bth.se\n\nKarlshamn\n\nYou can commute by train and bus from the nearby municipalities of Ronneby and Sölvesborg to both Campus Karlskrona and Campus Karlshamn. Between our campus’ it is about 45 minutes by train. Read more on Karlshamn kommun.\n\nWhen you apply for an apartment, remember to check:\n\nHow much to pay in rent\n\nWhat is included in the rent (internet, electricity etc)\n\nIf you are allowed to live together with friends\n\nIf the apartment is furnished or not\n\nProperty Insurance (home insurance)\n\nBTH recommends all students to individually purchase property insurance (hemförsäkring) from a Swedish or international insurance company. Personal property refers to your personal belongings that are not covered by any insurance at BTH, e.g. clothing, jewellery, bicycles, computers, cameras, etc.\n\nFor more information regarding accommodation and housing, please visit Blekinge Student Union."
