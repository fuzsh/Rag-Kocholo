        "meta_description": "This publication addresses the challenges in managing Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) in the Nordic countries including an outlook on other European countries. Despite a 70% recovery target, the Nordics lag behind due to economic, legislative, and social barriers. The study emphasizes the need for better CDW statistics and highlights successful European initiatives. Key findings include that the barriers do not seem to be technical feasibility, but rather include economic obstacles, and regional variations in recycling. Recommendations include unified approaches, regulations, and stronger incentives for reuse and recycling of CDW. The study advocates waste prevention through reuse and design strategies for future constructions, emphasizing collaboration within the Nordics and the EU.",

        "text": "In Table 3 and Table 4, data for treated CDW per capita are showcased. Table 3 shows the amounts of treated CDW per capita according to each of the Nordic countries. The data is shown according to the main CDW categories, and the amounts are reported in kg waste per capita. This was done to put the amounts of treated CDW into context as the size of the countries differs, and therefore different volumes of CDW are treated in each of the countries. When looking at the table, Denmark reports significantly more volumes of treated CDW when compared to the other countries, especially the countries that have similar numbers of inhabitants. This can be due to several reasons, for example the detail of the data and reporting, and the other cultural differences, such as traditional building methods and materials and the norms in the industry. Short distances also can lead to that more material is transported as waste instead of e.g., direct backfilling or recycling of mineral materials on-site. Also, the statistics can vary a lot from year to year.\n\nBetter statistics that measure all the waste, will lead to higher number of kg waste per capita, whereas in some regions, e.g., in Iceland, the statistics are not as detailed as the other countries which might be the cause for lower amounts reported in the statistics. Difference in statistics among countries could also stem from variations in how the source data is generated, for instance, waste companies categorizing waste fractions differently in the respective regions. Differences in building stock can also explain the numbers for Denmark, where houses are largely made of bricks instead of wood, that weigh less than bricks. Also, the amount of asphalt waste reflected in the CDW statistics could explain the differences, since asphalt do not necessary get reported as CDW waste if recycled internally by the infrastructure company.\n\nThe Waste management regulation, Reglugerð um meðhöndlun úrgangs (803/2023), is set by the Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Climate and was entered in to force in July 2023. The regulation states that preparation for reuse, recycling and other material recovery (including backfilling) of CDW shall be at minimum 70% (of weight).\n\nThe national building regulation, Byggingarreglugerð (112/2012) is set by the Housing and Infrastructure Agency in Iceland and acts as a minimal standard for design and construction of new buildings to help protect the health and safety of people living/operating in them. The Ministry of Infrastructure oversees the Housing of Infrastructure Agency in Iceland. The regulation states that from January 1, 2020, at least 70% of CDW must be sorted in such a way that is suitable for recovery before it is returned to a waste reception facility. Furthermore, the regulation states the following for management of CDW.\n\nNew buildings should be designed and built in such a way that all the waste that may come from them, i.e., due to construction works, maintenance and changes during their lifetime as well as demolition, causes the least possible damage to the environment.\n\nBefore constructions of buildings that require a building permit begins, the owner must submit to the license provider a plan for the management of construction and demolition waste, which includes information on planning, registration, classification, reuse, and disposal, if the project is expected to amount more than 10 ton of waste.\n\nA list of construction and demolition waste generated during the construction shall be made. Material types and their quantities must be recorded.\n\nAll construction waste must be transported to an approved waste reception facility.\n\nIn Figure 10, the material flows for the CDW treated in Iceland in 2020 can be seen, and the data have been visualised in a Sankey-diagram. When comparing the waste categories shown in the diagram to the minimum sorting categories of waste defined in the Icelandic national waste laws, some differences can be seen. That is due to the amendments of the national waste laws came into force in the beginning of 2023 and therefore, data is not available for those categories for the year 2020.\n\nThe waste diagram shows that mineral waste and other CDW, mainly asphalt waste, accounts for the largest amounts of the total treated CDW. Furthermore, the majority of the CDW is recovered and goes into backfilling operations. The second largest treatment method for the CDW is recycling, but the type of recycling is unspecified to a large extent. A very small fraction is sent to energy recover as there is no such facility operating in Iceland.\n\nWaste generated from demolition work, renovation work and maintenance work on buildings and facilities must be reported to the local authorities prior to starting the work and must be sorted on site if it amounts to more than 1 ton of waste, or if the work involve the replacement of double-glazed windows that may have been manufactured in the period 1950 to 1977. If the total amount of waste from a demolition or construction site is expected to be less than 1 ton, on-site sorting is not mandatory. In that case, the waste must be sorted at an off-site facility. The waste-producing company may let unsorted construction and demolition waste, which is suitable for material recovery, be sorted at a suitable registered sorting facility.\n\nMost of the construction waste is handled by large private waste management companies that operates nationwide and have large facilities for treatment of waste (sorting, shredding, crushing etc.). In many cases concrete is crushed by mobile machinery and backfilled on site or used on other projects close by. In Denmark it is usually cheaper to sort and recycle materials, since the landfill fees are very high. There is an emerging market for reusable construction materials but as of today the volume is small and the market is hampered by lack of uniformity and difficulties to comply with building code requirements.\n\nFor some specific sorted construction materials (like glass, gypsum, and metals) close to 100 % of the generated waste is recycled in the production of new materials, e.g., glass insulation wool (Isover), glass packaging (Ardagh) and new plasterboards. Metals are largely exported for recycling. Wood waste primarily is recycled into chipboards, but the amount depends largely on the market prices and can therefore fluctuate between recycling into chipboard or used for energy recovery.\n\nThe summary of current treatment methods for different CDW fractions are shown in following table below. A list of the largest treatment facilities in Denmark are shown in Appendix 1.\n\n2.2.2 Greenland\n\nGreenland is a vast country with a small and dispersed population. The amount of generated waste is relatively small. All kinds of waste in Greenland have traditionally been disposed by means of discharge to the sea or by landfill.\n\nSince the late 1990s the waste system in the settlements and in the smaller towns have typically consisted of a landfill and an incineration plant, as well as some system for collecting hazardous waste.\n\nIn 2019 the five municipalities joined and founded a national waste management company with the purpose of creating solutions for the handling of all kinds of waste in Greenland. This includes the building of two new incineration plants in Nuuk and Sisimiut which will replace the current six regional incinerators and the many outdated small settlement incinerators. Waste suitable for incineration will be collected in the villages and settlements and shipped to the new larger facilities.\n\nOther types of waste will be sent for processing to other locations in Greenland or abroad. The waste will have to be shipped or airlifted, as the villages and settlements do not have interlinking roads. This combined with a relatively small production of waste make many of the solutions used in continental Europe unsuitable since the economic costs will be disproportionately high.\n\nAs of today, there are no public or private companies approved for the reception, treatment, or recycling of any type of waste. When asked about recycling of construction waste in Greenland two of the five municipalities answer that they have no knowledge of reuse or recycling of construction and demolition waste in connection with the renovation of existing buildings or for the construction of new buildings.\n\nMetal waste is collected and shipped for treatment in Denmark. Wood and plastic waste is incinerated at local waste incineration plants and glass waste, mineral waste and gypsum waste is landfilled locally. Some mineral waste (concrete) is crushed and used locally as backfilling.\n\nThe largest bank in Greenland, Grønlandsbanken, plans to offer loans on more favourable terms for environmentally friendly and sustainable building-/renovation projects.\n\nAll hazardous waste (such as waste oils, chemical, paint residues and electronics) throughout Greenland is sorted and then sent to Denmark for further processing.\n\nWaste that is handed over to the municipality's waste reception facilities must, as a minimum, be sorted into the following waste fractions:\n\n2.2.4 Finland\n\nDemolition waste treatment process varies in Finland depending on the size of demolition site. Typically, biggest waste fractions like mineral (concrete and tiles), wood and metals are separated on site with excavator. In larger demolition sites the concrete waste can be crushed on site with a mobile crusher or pulverized with excavator. Alternatively, the concrete waste fraction can be transported to stationary treatment plant where it is refined as concrete crush. A lot of demolished material ends up in mixed fraction which is delivered to mechanical treatment plant where it is separated. Certain materials such as gypsum waste is difficult to separate afterwards from mixed waste as it pulverizes easily.\n\nIn practice, the separate collection of different waste fractions does not realize in construction and even less in demolition sites, even though it is obligated in the legislation. The separate collection obligation is not generally supervised or there is no penalty for neglecting the obligation. Overall, the costs are main driver to determine what happens to the demolition waste. Largest fractions, such as metals, wood and concrete, have existing recycling or recovery practices and reasonable or even positive price for recycling as a material or energy recovery. However, the waste fractions which requires more work to separate in the demolition site, such as plastics, mineral wool or gypsum waste, typically ends up in mixed CDW and are used for energy recovery or deposited to landfill instead of recycling. The separate collection of many waste fractions would increase the overall costs for demolition projects. Especially the public demolition projects are typically tendered based on lowest price.\n\nAs the recycling rate targets for CDW are not achieved, new recommendations and practices arise in a fast pace. Pre-demolition audit is voluntary in Finland, but it is recommended for all buildings over 100 m2. Only the mapping of hazardous substance and asbestos is currently mandatory for all buildings which are constructed or renovated before 1994. Emerging markets in reuse and recycling can be seen, even though still in relatively small scale compared to total amount of CDW.\n\nFinland has variety of treatment plants for mixed CDW. Municipal waste management companies are responsible to arrange waste management for CDW from households, for example waste from renovations. Larger CDW streams from building demolition and construction are typically source separated and delivered for utilization to private waste management companies. Common practice is that the contractor does only limited source separation (for example separation of steel and wood) and sends the mixed CDW to the other private waste management companies for further treatment and recycling. For example, mineral waste fractions, such as concrete and brick waste, are quite often utilized by the demolition contractors themselves for backfilling or other infra construction purposes.\n\nThe biggest mixed CDW treatment facilities are located near the major centre of population in Finland (Helsinki metropolitan area, Turku, Oulu and Tampere). The major CDW treatment and recycling plants in Finland are listed in the appendix 1. Especially for the mixed CDW treatment and recycling plants the list is not comprehensive as there are plenty of smaller enterprises which separates and treats mixed CDW around Finland. Typically, the smaller treatment facilities do not have stationary treatment/separation lines and therefore the separation is mainly done with excavator.\n\nThe general processing for the different CDW materials is described below:\n\nUntreated, treated and impregnated wood are typically separated on-site. Untreated wood can be directed to recycling, but still majority of all wood CDW ends up in energy recovery. New recycling alternatives, such as biochar production, are upcoming in Finland. Treated and impregnated wood goes mainly to energy recovery facilities with permission to handle this fraction.\n\nMineral CDW, especially concrete waste and bricks, can be used for certain infra construction applications if they fulfil given requirements concerning hazardous substances and technical requirements and they are crushed on site or sent to stationary crushing stations. Mineral waste which is not suitable for infra construction purposes are used as a backfill in landfill structures.\n\nMineral insulation wool waste from demolition typically ends up in mixed CDW fraction and in landfills. Small amounts of mineral wool waste have been separated and directed to recycling. However, Finland currently lacks large-scale recycling alternatives for mineral insulation wool which origins from demolition or renovation activities. For new constructions there are collection systems for excess mineral wool insulation materials.\n\nMetal is sorted out and is delivered for recycling, the metals are melted and used in new products of metal. Metal products can also be reused but it is still relatively small-scale operation.\n\nGlass is sorted out and is delivered for material recycling and production of new products (e.g., foam glass), the rest ends up in landfill.\n\nPlastic waste from demolition sites typically ends up in mixed CDW and it is sorted off-site in mechanical sorting facilities. The new construction sites, at least larger ones, have separate collection for packaging plastics. Overall majority of plastic CDW ends up in energy recovery, small amounts end up in recycling and landfill (e.g., majority of PVC).\n\nSeparation of plasterboard waste on-site in demolition sites is typically considered too expensive and therefore it mainly ends up in mixed CDW fraction where only small amounts can be separated off-site for recycling. Plasterboard waste collection from construction sites is easier and it is done in some extent. Good quality plaster waste can be sent to plasterboard production facilities. Currently most of the plaster waste ends up in landfill and small fraction to incineration.\n\nThe main treatment methods for different CDW fractions in Finland is summarized in Table 7.\n\nThe private service providers are a diverse group of contractors and operators that offer waste services. Some of these service actors specialize in a specific field and have a license for the reception, transport of waste or other treatment of a specific type of waste while others undertake a wide range of waste services for almost all types of waste. The service providers do business with each other and there are many examples of waste being transferred between parties. Parties that handle waste must have a work permit from the health committee or the Environmental Agency in Iceland according to the nature of the treatment, and the best available techniques should be used for waste management.\n\nService providers and recycling companies which handle the waste submit a report to the Environmental Agency on the waste they handle, with information on types of the waste and quantity, origin by industry category and municipalities and disposal of each material. Waste producers who dispose of their own waste at the production site or export their own waste for further treatment must submit a similar report. The Environment Agency therefore has an overview of registered waste for each municipality, both for households and legal entities.\n\nIceland has several waste facilities located around the country, both public and private facilities, but not all treat the same categories of construction and demolition waste. Some only handle a few materials, while other plants have the capacity of taking care of more categories of CDW. The main receivers of construction and demolition waste in Iceland are:\n\nPublic landfills\n\nDisposal sites for inert waste\n\nComposting plants\n\nMines\n\nWaste incineration (without energy recovery)\n\nScrap metal companies\n\nVarious private service providers\n\nOther reception points, e.g., occasional landfills in the sea or other\n\nGeneral landfill sites and various service providers are the ones that handle the largest part of construction waste in Iceland. However, it is not known exactly how big a part of the total amount of construction wastes these service providers handle, due to the registration of the amount of construction waste with them is not publicly available. The major CDW treatment facilities in Iceland are listed in Appendix 1. The main treatment methods for different CDW fractions are summarized in Table 8.\n\n2.2.7 Norway\n\nWaste management in the construction sector in Norway is well regulated in the Building Regulation (TEK), which requires the preparation of waste plans before new construction and renovation or before demolition starts. The sorting takes place in large scale on the site for all types of projects if the project is not too small (for projects over 300 m2 for new buildings, over 100 m2 for changes or projects generating over 10 tons of construction and/or demolition waste). Each fraction is collected and sent to reception for the waste. If there is lack of space on the site for many containers for the sorting of each fraction, there may be performed sorting of waste at the reception site. Sorting at the waste reception site will not be accepted as a fulfilment of demand to 70 % sorting of the construction and demolition waste. For all projects hazardous waste is registered for separate sorting. Non-hazardous waste is registered for sorting into different fractions by materials for either reuse, recycling, incineration, or landfill (e.g., plaster). Some waste ends up as unsorted and is sent to incineration and/or landfill.\n\nFor construction waste from sites of new buildings or other constructions (roads, harbours and likewise) it is a similar process with sorting of hazardous waste for no reuse and other waste sorted into fractions for further transport to reception of waste and next for reuse, recycling, incineration, or for landfill.\n\nAt the reception site for waste the different fractions will be treated as needed with removing of materials that is not sorted in the correct fraction, removing materials for a cleaner or more homogenous fraction, crushing, if necessary, sort for transport to handling the fraction in another site in Norway or transport to Europa, or handling the fraction at the place. The fractions can be delivered for incineration (energy recovery), reuse, recycling of materials or landfill. Norway do not have an additional landfill tax, which is different from most other Nordic countries.\n\nThe general processing for the materials is described below:\n\nUntreated wood from construction and demolition waste is sent to energy production by incineration. Some amounts can be used for new production of for example chipboard. Treated wood, like painted, varnished and pressure treated (impregnated) wood is delivered to waste facilities with permission to handle this fraction.\n\nMaterials with minerals, like concrete, brick and stone, can be used as backfilling if proved to be free from hazardous substances. Waste facilities will crush the fraction, or this fraction can be crushed at the construction site and be used if needed there as backfilling. If the fraction has a small amount of hazardous substances, it can be used if permission is given after application to Miljødirektoratet/Norwegian Environment Agency. If the fraction is under a given limit for several hazardous substances, it can be used to replace virgin materials, without need to seek for permission, like in backfilling. The limits values are regulated in legislation “avfallsforskriften kap. 14a”. If the amount of hazardous substances is so high that the materials will be categorized as hazardous waste it must be transported to waste facility which is approved for handling this kind of waste. Surplus of insulation made of stone or glass is reused or recycled by delivering the fraction back to the producer or to a recycling site witch also delivers to the producer. Most of the fraction minerals goes to material recovery and landfilling .\n\nMetal is sorted out and is delivered for recycling, the metals are melted and used in new products of metal. Metal products can also be reused but it is still relatively small-scale operation.\n\nGlass is sorted out and is delivered for material recycling and production of new products (e.g., glass wool), and some goes to landfill. All glass with hazardous substances must be delivered to waste facilities with permission to handle this waste. In Norway, insulating glass units containing PCB, are under an EPR scheme. Ruteretur AS operates as the approved nationwide take-back system for discarded insulating glass units containing PCBs in Norway. Norsk Gjenvinning AS work as a contracting company to recycle the glass and breakdown hazardous components through incineration with energy recovery.\n\nPlastic is sorted in several fractions, of which some goes to energy recovery, some goes to recycling and production of new products and some goes to landfill.\n\nGyspum waste is sorted out and it is delivered for recycling to producer of plasterboard, after it has been crushed and cleaned to plaster powder. Some also goes to incineration, and some goes to landfill.\n\nWhen a container of waste is delivered to a waste reception the content will be controlled to make sure that it is the right category name that has been used on the fraction. It will be controlled visually, by documents and by random samples. If needed the fraction will be sorted further done manually or with crane and claw.\n\nFractions that go to energy production will be cleaned for unwanted materials and crushed to the wanted size for the incinerator the fraction is sent to. The fractions used for this is combustible waste and combustible wood (meaning untreated wood).\n\nThere are seven large waste incineration plants in Norway, i.e., plants that burn more than 100,000 tonnes of waste per year. They incinerate household waste and some commercial waste. The seven large facilities are in Oslo, Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, Kristiansand and Ålesund .\n\nFractions that are delivered for material recycling will be handled with removal of unwanted materials. Some fractions will be crushed, like concrete, asphalt, bricks and plaster. Others will be cut into smaller parts to make it easier to handle, like wood and metal. Metal will be sent to facilities which will melt it and use it or sell it for new production. If materials are suitable for reuse, they will be sorted manually and registered in different database depending on which waste reception the material is delivered to.\n\nFor construction and demolition waste there are facilities and sites with databases like Loopfront, Resirquel, Rehub, Sirken. These companies receive materials from demolition and rehabilitation projects, and excess material from construction of new buildings. The responsibility for quality control of the reused products has been moved from the seller to the buyer, which increases availability of products for reuse. The materials and products are stored until sold for reuse.\n\nThe current treatment methods for different CDW fractions in Norway are summarized in the following table (Table 9). The list of the major CDW treatment facilities in Norway are listed in Appendix 1.\n\n2.2.8 Sweden\n\nIn Sweden, waste from construction and demolition (CDW) represents approximately 40 % of all generated waste, when waste from the mining industry is excluded. Of this, approximately 5 % of CDW is hazardous material. Sweden reports a material recovery rate of approximately 50 % for CDW excluding soils and excavation masses . The statistics of CDW in Sweden is inadequate and a progress of collecting data of generated as well as recovered CDW is necessary and an ongoing work for Swedish authorities.\n\nPrior to demolition, identification of hazardous materials and components is (exceptions may occur) required, as well as identification of possible material recovery and what the recovery process will look like. Either permission from, or a notification to, the local authorities is required prior to demolition.\n\nHazardous CDW, such as asbestos and impregnated wood, demands specialized handling and must be transported to a treatment facility with permission to receive hazardous waste.\n\nIn January 2023 all CDW generated from households became municipal responsibility. Municipalities exclusively have the right to transport and treat waste within their waste management jurisdiction. This means that for private individuals renovating at home, waste can only be professionally transported and handled by the municipality or contractors authorized by the municipality .\n\nCDW is received and treated by private waste management companies, as well as by public actors. Facilities often accept all fractions of CDW, and the mixed CDW is usually mechanically sorted, crushed and stored before being delivered to recycling or other treatment. Smaller companies often rely on municipal recycling centres. The bulk of sorted waste is then transported for further treatment . Of the mixed CDW sorted mechanically approximately 34 % go to material recovery or recycling, and the rest is treated by energy recovered or disposed of to landfill .\n\nThe wood waste from construction and demolition is most often used for energy production. Mineral waste such as concrete is often crushed and used on site as backfilling material.\n\nThe Swedish Construction Federation intends to improve resource management within the construction sector by creating industry standards for waste management that comply with the Swedish Environmental Code and the EU Waste Management Hierarchy. These guidelines prioritize waste reduction, reuse, and recycling over disposal methods like landfill and energy recovery. They aid construction companies in managing waste correctly, promote sustainable construction practices, and encourage recycling and reuse.\n\nThe list of the major CDW treatment facilities in Sweden are listed in Appendix 1. The current treatment methods for different CDW fractions in Sweden are summarized in Table 10.\n\n2.3 Challenges with recycling and reusing of CDW\n\nThe treatment and transportation costs are probably the major factor which guides the selection of treatment method for CDW. For example, the energy recovery option is more easily applied for certain CDW fractions, especially for wood and plastic waste, even though recycling alternative would be available. On-site separation of smaller CDW fractions is in many cases considered too expensive and time consuming and therefore these fractions end up in mixed CDW which is transported to off-site sorting facilities. The mixing of different CDW fractions may prevent the further recycling due to contamination or pulverization during the process. The good availability of cheap virgin raw materials (e.g., aggregates for concrete production) can inhibit the usage or recycled materials even though they would be available.\n\nHazardous substances are also one factor that limits recycling and reuse of CDW materials. The hazardous substances are especially problematic in certain product categories from previous decades such as mortars, jointing materials, impregnated wood structures, insulation materials, paints or glues. Hazardous substances containing materials needs to be disposed properly to prevent accumulation. Energy recovery can be done from certain hazardous fractions (e.g., treated wood) other fractions are typically landfilled (e.g., asbestos) to remove harmful substances from circulation.\n\nThe level of detail of available CDW statistics from different Nordics varies and most of the Nordic countries have only limited data available especially from the smaller CDW fractions. For example, mineral fraction typically includes many smaller fractions, such as gypsum or mineral wool waste, which makes the evaluation of total volumes and current treatment methods difficult.\n\nMineral waste and wood waste represents the largest CDW fractions in all countries and the increase of recycling or reusing of these materials would have the biggest impact on all CDW recycling and reuse. Certain waste fractions, such as mineral wool waste, plaster waste and reject from mechanical CDW separation, were identified as the most problematic fractions in the terms of recycling in many Nordic countries as these materials typically ends up in landfill. However, the situation between Nordics varies and especially Denmark was identified to have a functional recycling process as these fractions mentioned above were not considered problematic in the terms of recycling.\n\n2.3.1 Mineral waste (concrete and bricks)\n\nMost of the concrete and tile CDW is recovered and backfilled as supporting layers under roads and foundations. This represents a low rank in the waste hierarchy. A step up could be using the materials in the production of new concrete. The main obstacle preventing recycling of concrete waste in new concrete production is good availability of cheap virgin aggregates which makes the recycling unprofitable in many cases.\n\nAnother obstacle is possible contaminations. Today the concrete producers typically use concrete waste from element production or other sources where the concrete materials are guaranteed free of contaminations. The concrete waste from demolition activities may contain contaminants (e.g., PCB, PAH, lead compounds, or asbestos), which typically origins from coatings, jointing materials, paints or for example water sealants. In addition, other impurities, such as plastic, ceramic or wood, may mix into concrete during demolition process which limits the use as aggregates in new concrete production. The European waste legislation prescribes that hazardous substances needs to be separated from other waste streams and treated only in specially designed facilities that have obtained permission for hazardous waste treatment. This applies also for demolition waste.\n\nA further step up for concrete waste could be reuse of concrete elements or pillars, but it is difficult to make old materials comply with the new regulations and it is more expensive and time consuming than simply ordering custom fit or standardized new building materials. The regulations are less restrictive when designing outdoor areas and elements, pillars or tiles might find use as outdoor walls or pavement on paths and squares. Different Nordics have or are developing guidelines and practices for concrete structure and brick reuse, but so far, the reuse is estimated to be still rather small-scale activity. The Nordics lacs of unified statistical data concerning the reuse of structural elements.\n\nMost of the Nordic countries have set limit values for hazardous substances which needs to be fulfilled for mineral waste fractions, mainly for concrete and bricks, that are to be utilized e.g., in infra construction purposes. There are variations between countries for example at which point the material needs to be analysed prior to utilization and for what purpose the material can be used. The limit values in Finland differs from other countries as the limit values are mainly set as leachable solutions (L/S = 10) not as a total concentration as in other countries. Finland also has two different limit values: limit values for concrete and brick waste when they are used for certain infrastructure purposes and national EOW criteria for concrete waste. The hazardous substance limit value comparison for utilization is presented in Table 11.\n\n2.3.2 Metal waste\n\nMetal waste possess significant value and therefore the recycling rate for long has been very high in all the Nordics and possibilities for increasement in recycling rate is negligible. A step up in the waste hierarchy could be reuse of the materials which has been done in some extent nearly in all Nordic countries. However, as for concrete, the reusable steel structures must comply with existing building regulations and technical requirements which makes it typically more difficult and cumbersome compared to construction with new construction products.\n\n2.3.3 Glass waste\n\nThe reuse of windows and window frames is possible, and it has been done project-wise in all Nordics. However, a majority of glass waste generated in demolition and construction sites ends up for recycling in Nordics. Glass waste can be recycled for example in glass production, glass wool production or foam glass production. Older glass frames may contain PCB or other hazardous substances in the jointing materials which needs to be separated in recycling process.\n\n2.3.4 Wood waste\n\nWood waste is mainly across the Nordics recovered as energy and there are limited options for recycling such as use in the production of particle boards or biochar. Wood waste is typically divided in three categories: untreated, treated and impregnated. All kind of treatment such as paintings, wood preservatives, anti mould agents and impregnating agents limits the recycling possibilities of wood waste and treated wood fraction typically ends up in energy recovery .\n\nUntreated wood has the highest potential for recycling and reusing. Denmark stands out with a dedicated large plant for recycling wood waste in particle board production. A step up in the waste hierarchy is reuse of wood in new constructions. In a smaller scale some companies specialise in seeking out higher quality wood waste for use in production of sheds or use more ordinary wood for building interim measures on construction sites. There is a potential to increase the recycling of wood waste and in some extent also to increase the reuse but generally, wood is in large supply in the Nordics (at least in Sweden, Norway, and Finland) making the case for recycling and reuse of wood waste less economical clearcut. A big obstacle in increasing the recycling or reuse of wood waste is the work required in separation into different qualities and grades of wood, including certification and technical control."
