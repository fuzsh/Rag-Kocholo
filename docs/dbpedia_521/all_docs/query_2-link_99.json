        "text": "The target of the biosphere reserves recognized under UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme is to contribute to sustainable development in the area by assuring sound management, transfer of innovation, decision and policy-making. The World Network of Biosphere Reserves comprises 610 sites in 117 countries. The biosphere reserve concept has shown its importance beyond protected areas and has increasingly been embraced by scientists, planners, policy-makers and local communities to have a variety of knowledge, scientific investigations and experiences to link biodiversity conservation and socio-economic development for human well-being. The focus of biosphere reserves is on developing models for global, national and local sustainability, to serve as learning sites and to work together to translate the global principles of sustainable development into locally relevant praxis. Switzerland launched its new park system with the approval of the Entlebuch Biosphere Reserve in a bottom-up process in 2001. Within 10 years, Switzerland has established the laws, procedures, regulations and funding mechanisms to establish a comprehensive park network. The framework can be considered as a basis for the new generation of model regions for sustainable development. A Model is a “best practice” regarding an integrated approach for sustainable development. It should be attractive, accepted, realistic, easy to understand, visible and tangible, reproducible, measurable and it has to be assessed continuously. The new concept, “Global Regions”, was launched in December 2012. A Global Region is a territorial system, which interlinks environment, society and economy and bases its activities on production cycles on the local biocapacity, particularly the available natural resources. The overall goal is to launch the implementation of sustainable development worldwide.\n\nLarge scale protected areas are considered a promising way of nature protection. Its management, however, depends to a great extent on the way in which potential coflicts between nature protection measures and socioeconomic aspirations of local population are treated. In this context the concept of biosphere reserve, as it was articulated at the UNESCO’s Man and Biosphere (MaB) Conference in Sevilla (1995) and reinforced in Madrid (2008), is suggested as an efficient tool to achieve the consensus among individual stakeholders. In our conditions, the biosphere reserve is as a rule institutionally associated with the administration of a particular area protected according to the Czech environmental legislation. In order to discuss the chance of this concept to be practically implemented, three Czech biosphere reserves, including the Sumava Biosphere Reserve, were analysed in a view of four missions biosphere reserves are expected to fulfill. Results of the analysis suggest that the pr...\n\nThe main priority of UNESCO MAB program is to emphasize the implementation of biosphere reserve concept for achieving sustainable development. Biosphere reserve is a concept of site management to harmonize the needs for conservation of both land and coastal ecosystem with the need for economic development in the basis of research on the utilization of natural resources, including cultural resources recognized by UNESCO MAB Program in order to promote a balanced relationship between human and the nature. Principally, the concept of biosfer reserve is applied to bring the conservation of biological diversity into line with sustainable development for achieving a balanced relationship between human and the nature. The advantage of applying the biosphere reserve concept lays on the excellent combination of its three functions, namely: (1) The function associated with conservation of biological resources, ecosystems, and cultural diversity; (2) The function associated with development th..."
