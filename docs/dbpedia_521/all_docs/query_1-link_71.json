        "text": "This paper discusses information technology as political and practical discourse. This repetitive discursive model can be distinguished in global, regional and local contexts and contains an optimistic belief in technology as an independent power that automatically furthers democratic development. The second part of the paper presents empirical material and experiences from the ‘Women Writing on the Net’ project. The aim was to build up a virtual space for women and use writing as aim, tool and method. This created a more complex understanding of the values of the predominant IT discourses and revealed the ‘cracks’ and possibilities for feminist definitions of these values."
