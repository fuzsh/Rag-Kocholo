The ITSEC security and the ITSEM methods given by the European Community are used as a base. The EC INFOSEC research programme has included the project 'PER DOMUM' which focuses on remote reading of energy meters. The project is a co-operation between TACS (U.K.), GPP (Germany), CESI (Italy) and ENEL (Italy). SP has during the spring and summer of 1994 participated in the concluding of the project. Threats, security functions and security mechanisms are given for remote reading of energy meters. All of the listed functions and mechanisms do not origin from the 'PER DOMUM' project, but are the experiences of SP. The security evaluation is explained in two ways. One description of the required by ITSEM is given. Another description is given of which deliverables are required to perform the evaluation\n\nAdditional functions of remotely read kWh-meters\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKoponen, P [VTT Energy, Espoo (Finland); Vehvilaeinen, S [Mittrix Oy (Finland); Rantanen, J [Helsinki Energy Board (Finland)\n\n1998-08-01\n\nIn this chapter the possibilities to include new applications into remotely read smart kWh-meters are considered. New electronic meters can measure various electric quantities and have some extra calculating capacity. So they can be used to provide functions that distribution automation and the customer need and thus share the costs. Some applications like monitoring the state of the distribution network or locating faults are only for the utility, but many applications also need an interface to the customers or their automation systems. Among those are monitoring the quality of electricity, estimating load curves, applying dynamic tariffs and selling electricity and accounting. As a special item, the continuous monitoring of the quality of electricity is discussed. This includes voltage levels, total distortion, asymmetry and so on. If such a kWh-meter indicates quality problems it is possible to go there with a portable quality meter that is suitable for the case and inspect the situation. The poor quality can be detected before it causes harm to equipment owned by the customers or the power distribution company. This article also presents a prototype of such a quality monitoring kWh-meter. Dynamic tariffs and free electricity markets require two way communication with the utility and the customer and measurement of the time variations of the energy consumption. The customers or their energy management system must receive the energy prices from the utility and calculate the energy costs and decide upon the energy consumption control actions. Some alternative ways to meet these customer interface requirements are compared. Remote reading of kWh-meters requires a certain investment in meters and their data communication with the utility. Because smart meters can have some additional memory and calculating capacity and are capable of measuring various electric quantities, it is possible to share the costs with other applications that use the same hardware and data\n\nAdditional functions of remotely read kWh-meters\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKoponen, P.

The system selects trusted technology such as, the identity authentication, integrity verifying, and data protection. By the experiments, it is proved that the remote meter reading system of the heat meter can be used to verify the feasibility of the technology, and verify the practicability and operability of data protection technology.\n\nRadio-controlled automatic gas meter-reading system; Releve automatique de compteur par radio\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nYasui, M. [Osaka Gas Co., Ltd (Japan); Ishikawa, K.; Fujiwara, J. [Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. (Japan); Ichihashi, T. [Toho Gas Co., Ltd. (Japan)\n\n2000-07-01\n\nIn Japan, an automatic gas meter-reading system is in operation, also incorporating the functions of monitoring for abnormalities in gas use and remote-controlled emergency gas supply shutoff. This system has been realized by linking microcomputer-controlled gas meters(It's called 'Intelligent gas mater') equipped with automatic shutoff mechanism to the gas utility company operation center via communication lines. While the present system uses cable communication lines, we of Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd., Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. and Toho Gas Co., Ltd., have jointly developed a new system based on radio communication. This paper introduces this new system. While radio-controlled meter-reading systems are used in many countries around the world solely for automatic meter reading, our recently developed system is also capable of monitoring for abnormalities in gas use and remote-controlled emergency gas supply shutoff, thanks to its almost real-time two-way communication function. The new system can serve for a period of ten years without recharging. It is also characterized by its applicability as different systems according to purposes: 1) conventional automatic meter-reading system (terminal network control unit or T-NCU), 2) large-scale radio-controlled meter-reading system, and 3) portable terminal-type radio-controlled meter-reading system.

In 2014, Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta operated 179,305 units of street lights. Of the number of installed armature, 92 % of them or 166,441 units are HPS (High-Pressure Sodium) armatures which are inefficient. In 2016, the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta cut down the energy used for street lighting, by implementing the programs of kWh-meter installation in every street lighting panel and use energy-saving lamps equipped with the smart system. The Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta is registered with 6,399 customer IDs in PLN (State Owned Electric Company), and gradually carried out the kWh Meter installation and changes to the contract. The program to use energy-saving lights done by replacing the HPS armature that is not energy efficient to LED armature which is known to be energy efficient. Until the end of 2016, the number of armatures that has been replaced was 89,417 units. The research results on 25 samples of PLN customer IDs and the replacement of 2,162 units armature, showed that the energy efficiency through kWh meter installation and armature replacement reduce the power consumption from 330,414 kWh to 71,278 kWh or by 78.43%. Generally, there was a decrease in the value of electricity bill compared to the before the replacement. The program of kWh-meter installations and replacement of the armature has a payback period of 2.66 years.\n\nThe 59 meter dash - automatic rapid meter reading in Ronneby\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nOttosson, Hans [Enersearch (Sweden); Selander, Lars [Linkoeping Univ. (Sweden); Bergstroem, Ulrika [Sydkraft (Sweden)\n\n1999-02-01\n\nAs a result of deregulation of the telecommunications and energy markets, the utilities in Sweden see opportunities to use power lines for additional profitable applications such as transmission of data; the technology is called Power Line Telecommunications (PLT). The potential advantages are said to be 'massive'. The potential applications include remote security, automatic meter reading, load management and 'smart' home automation. A small scale feasibility study has been carried out in Ronneby in Sweden where it was shown that load management and efficiency improvements can reduce the costs of supplying the town with heat and electricity by about 3%. The Ronneby trial is described in detail. Since Scandinavia makes use of weather-dependent renewables for much of its power generation, load management is an attractive potential application of PLT.

Flims nutzt sein Kabelnetz\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSantner, G.\n\n2006-07-01\n\nThis short article discusses the experience gained by the local electricity utility in Flims, Switzerland, on reading out its customers' electricity meters via the Internet. The utility uses the cable-TV network - which it also operates - to automatically transmit counter values to the utility's central server. Remote locations send data via the GPRS mobile network. The system provides consumers with monthly bills and allows the utility to plan mains-loading in a better way. The advantages of the system are discussed, in particular with respect to the liberalisation of the electricity market. The extension of the system to provide remote metering of gas and water is also discussed.\n\nPrivacy friendly aggregation of smart meter readings, even when meters crash\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nHoepman, J.H.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nA well studied privacy problem in the area of smart grids is the question of how to aggregate the sum of a set of smart meter readings in a privacy friendly manner, i.e., in such a way that individual meter readings are not revealed to the adversary. Much less well studied is how to deal with\n\nR and D of remote reading system. Remote reading system no kaihatsu kenkyu\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNakano, H.; Hamada, T.; Nakamura, O. (The Kansai Electric Power Co. Inc., Osaka (Japan)); Imai, Y.; Akiyama, K.\n\n1992-03-25\n\nAs measures for the spots difficult in metering within a framework to integrally automate the power distribution, a remote reading system was prototypically tested and evaluated in reliability on the actual field. The system methodically selected the signal {prime}s line injection, high frequency wave signal and voltage detection, while the signal frequency, transmission rate and highest transmission output were set at approx. 3.5KHz, 7.5bps and 50dBm, respectively from the test result. The demonstration test on reliability of the system locatively selected a vicinity of high voltage consumer, high harmonic wave-generating consumer, transforming station, etc. The total ratio of success in reception was comparatively high in Kuzuno and Yamazaki areas, but low in Kamojyo and Ichinomiya areas, The badness in reception was caused by the fluctuation in noise and strongness in damping which was influenced by the condenser in the high voltage consumer. The locative relation between the parent and child stations of system, and high voltage consumer being classified into four patters, an application table of remote reading system was prepared by simulation. 14 figs., 6 tabs.\n\nTopology-Based Estimation of Missing Smart Meter Readings\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDaisuke Kodaira\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Smart meters often fail to measure or transmit the data they record when measuring energy consumption, known as meter readings, owing to faulty measuring equipment or unreliable communication modules. Existing studies do not address successive and non-periodical missing meter readings. This paper proposes a method whereby missing readings observed at a node are estimated by using circuit theory principles that leverage the voltage and current data from adjacent nodes. A case study is used to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to successfully estimate the missing readings over an entire day during which outages and unpredictable perturbations occurred.\n\n18 CFR 367.9020 - Account 902, Meter reading expenses.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... 18 Conservation of Power and Water Resources 1 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false Account 902, Meter...

It examines the state of the technology and the economical benefits of advanced metering. One result of the survey is that advanced metering currently has a penetration of about six percent of total installed electric meters in the United States. Applications to the infrastructure differ by type of organization. Being integrated with emerging communication technologies, smart meters enable several kinds of features such as, not only automatic meter reading but also distribution management control, outage management, remote switching, etc.\n\nBeyond revenue metering -- a new age for automatic meter reading\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nChebra, R. J. [RJC Consulting L.L.C., PQ (Canada)\n\n2002-10-01\n\nAdvanced metering, data management, and communications possibilities of automated meter reading are explored. Applications in the area of demand side management, including load reduction, peak shaving and load shifting, new tariff structures based on the 'time of use incentive/penalty' approach, and information grade metering are emphasized. Based on trends and expectations, it is predicted that AMR will continue to experience rapid growth and deployment as new services are made available to the mass market. For example, technological advances will enable the industry to make 'time of use metering ' more attractive and beneficial to residential consumers, and embedded intelligence will make it possible to achieve more holistic energy environments.\n\nIntroduction of remote meter reading for Hydro-Quebec's residential customers\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHache, R.; Pouliot, D.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nIn 1986 Hydro-Quebec set a province-wide objective, under its program to improve the quality of customer service, to achieve 95% billing based on real readings. Using market studies, Hydro-Quebec was able to determine a population (approximately 10% of customers) of hard-to-access meters. To reach the objective, they examined the options of using additional human resources or using new technology. In 1988, they decided to adopt inbound technology (TELEREADER) and carry out a pilot project to validate certain aspects of the technology. This document gives an introduction to TELEREADER, along with its requirements, parameters and information on its installation.\n\nElectric Power Substitute Meter Management via Mobile Application\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNelson C.

K.S. [Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited (China)\n\n2000-07-01\n\nRemote meter reading is probably one of the fastest growing areas for the meter manufacturing industry. There are fixed installation system, RF system, power line signal system etc. Nevertheless, it is rather difficult to have a system in the market that is both cost-effective and suitable for situations like Hong Kong which is full of high rises and concrete jungle. This payer will describe how The Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited, being the gas utility in Hong Kong serving more than 1.2 million residential customers, successfully comes up with an innovative remote meter reading system which takes advantage of the uniqueness of local gas supply system. Instead of trying to concentrate data from scattering points of the massive piping system through layers of concrete slabs, the new design being developed abandons the traditional spatial RF transmission approach. It utilizes the piping system itself as trunk links to transmit RF signal and negotiate through concrete layers without difficulties.

One of the most important processes in the field of measurement is the calibration of measuring instruments. The calibration process of the electrical meters was performed at laboratories. However, the new directives, now, require a regular test of accuracy. Nevertheless, moving each time on site to check the accuracy of a meter can be annoying. To solve this problem our contribution is to propose a new structure of a smart meter that integrates a calibration card, so that, this process is carried out remotely. To be able to calibrate the meter or test its accuracy, we have included an AC-AC converter powered by the electrical grid and that provides a stable voltage independent of the electrical grid in term of frequency and amplitude. The output voltage of the converter is used as the reference signal during calibration or accuracy testing. In this paper, we will present the structure of the calibration card, the study and dimensioning of the converter, as well as the control technique used to eliminate variations of the input voltage. At the end, we will present the results of simulations and experiments.\n\nStrategy of the spread of automatic meter reading for 10 million customers\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOkano, H.; Koyanagi, A.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nIn response to the major changes now taking place in its business environment, Tokyo Gas will restructure its meter-reading operations, including services peripheral thereto, to build a strong corporate structure toward the year 2010. Specifically, Tokyo Gas will proceed to intentional automatic meter reading, making use of the know-how it has accumulated doing so as part of a value-added service it has been marketing since 1988. Tokyo Gas will also use its two-way communication infrastructure to promote improved operational efficiency and labor savings. Intentional automatic meter reading will enable Tokyo Gas, over the 13 years following its commencement, to realize total cost savings of 53.5 billion yen and reassign 776 employers to strategic work. Tokyo Gas will also utilize its two-way communication infrastructure to provide additional services, including value-added services that will generate upwards of 3.7 billion yen margin annually and contracted meter reading services for utilities throughout Japan. Tokyo Gas will thus carry out a business expansion that will enable it to grow limitlessly together with society.

The primary purpose of this research is to design and implement an energy meter which can remotely control and monitor through global system for mobile (GSM) communication technology. For this purpose, a single phase or three phase digital energy meters are used to add on different advanced modules. The energy meter can be activated and display power consumption information at the consumer premises on liquid crystal display and through a short message service (SMS) by using GSM technology. At the power sending end, an energy meter can be remotely control and monitor through GSM technology without any system disturbances. This study will lead to make the system easier, economical, reliable and efficient for the electrical department.\n\nCompletely contained and remotely operated digital density meter\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGoergen, C.R.\n\n1979-10-01\n\nA completely contained and remotely operated density determination system having unique features was designed, fabricated, and installed at the Savannah River Plant.

Blood glucose monitoring data were downloaded from the meters and insulin pumps of 47 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Independent and paired t tests compared BGM data downloaded from meters and BGM data downloaded from insulin pumps. There were significant differences in BGM data downloaded from the insulin pumps of patients using wireless meters compared to those using nonwireless meters. Wireless patients appeared to engage in more BGM, had more low and in-range BG readings and fewer very high BG readingss than nonwireless patients. However, a comparison of BGM data downloaded from meters and insulin pumps of nonwireless patients indicated that their insulin pump data significantly underestimated the number of BGM readings conducted, as well as the number of low and in-range readings, while overestimating the number of very high BGM readings. Because patients who use nonwireless-compatible meters do not manually enter their low and in-range BGM readings into the insulin pump, BGM data downloaded only from pumps may provide an incomplete representation of BGM frequency or results. It is recommended that patients use meters that directly communicate with pumps or perform bolus calculations. Patients should be educated about the importance of manually entering all BGM readings if they do not use a wireless-compatible meter with their insulin pump.

If efficient appliances are used, an average household will use about 700 kWh per year, compared to about 3000 kWh it is using on average at present. Efficient appliances, however, are more expensive. The extra cost per kWh saved is about the same as the cost of the fuel needed to produce a kWh in a power plant. The 700 kWh per year can be produced by an autonomous solar cell system with an area of 3 m 2 (efficiency 19%). The analysis is valid roughly for the area between 40 o northern and southern latitude. A comparison has been made between the total costs of a grid connection and the costs of an autonomous solar cell system. If all costs are capitalized and compiled, a grid connection will amount to about $6,000 (fuel costs are not included). The costs of a solar cell system producing 700 kWh per year are about the same or even lower. The modular nature of solar cell systems makes it possible to start with a certain number of appliances, depending on the amount of money one can spend. 6 tabs., 2 refs\n\nThe development of a metering and remote checking system using a light sensor\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nJang, S.Y.; Ahn, S.H.; Lee, K.J. [R and D Center, Korea Gas Corporation, Ansan (Korea); Choi, W.Y.; Lee, B.C.; Song, J.C.; Park, J.Y.; Park, J.H.; Park, K.L.; Kim, K.Y.; Kim, J.Y [Venture Korea Corporation (Korea)\n\n1999-12-01\n\nThe light sensing technology developed in this project can apply all the conventional mechanical meters using only attaching a light sensor set. The technology is available to the majority of small scale consumption such as households, restaurants and offices rather than the minority of large scale consumption such as industry use. When the light sensing technology is practically in use, the expense of the remote checking system can be below 30,000 won per household, and unnecessary national loss can be prevented due to replacement of the conventional meters. If the remote checking system can be constructed using low-priced expenses, all the city gas companies can not only settle all the inconveniences of consumers due to unexpected visit of a gas meterman and communication problems in their absence fundamentally but expect economic profit such as curtailment of the expenses of inspection of meters and early retrieval of gas usage charge. Especially, by inspecting all the households in the midnight of every month simultaneously, civil petitions can be reduced by eliminating causes of bottleneck for flexible rate of natural gas, thus it is expected that general management expenses can be curtailed to a great extent. 22 figs., 6 tabs.\n\nRemote impact of rotating objects on semiconductor detector of gamma radiation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMel'nik, I.A.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nRemote impact of rotating objects (such as electric motors, flywheels) on meter and ionizing radiation detector readings were studied.

Three year-old peach palms from Yurimaguas, Peru were studied in Ubatuba, SP, Brazil, spaced 2 x 1 m in area under a natural gradient of organic matter which allowed four plots to be considered, according to the peach palms leaves colors, from light yellow to dark green. The SPAD readings and the stomatal frequency of leaflets were evaluated. The photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, Î¼mol m-2 s-1, the leaf temperature (Tleaf, ÂºC, the CO2 assimilation (A, Î¼mol m-2 s-1, the stomatal conductance (g s, mol m-2 s-1, the transpiration (E, mmol m-2 s-1 and the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci, Î¼mol mol-1 were evaluated with a portable infrared gas analyzer (LCA-4, ADC BioScientific Ltd., Great Amwell, U.K.. A linear increase in the CO2 assimilation as a function of the SPAD readings (y = -0.34 + 0.19x, RÂ² = 0.99, indicates that they can be a rapid and cheap complementary method to evaluate in peach palms some important physiological events, such as CO2 assimilation.\n\nSmart metering - energy data management at every meter point; Smart Metering - Energiedatenmanagement an jedem Zaehlpunkt\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKeller-Giessbach, D.; Kiel, E. [LogicaCMG, Muenchen (Germany)\n\n2007-09-15\n\nThe demise of monopolistic structures in the German energy market has also led to a change of perspective on metering. New requirements have to be met. Even in mass processing jobs such as meter reading it is no longer sufficient to simply read consumption data off a technically reliable meter or have customers do this themselves in preparation of billing. Currently used meters were not designed with a mind to demand management, environmental protection through energy conservation, changes in consumer behaviour or new service offers. This has been recognised in many European countries since the beginning of the present decade. The traditional task of metering is developing into a more comprehensive energy data management that takes account of the needs of customers, energy suppliers and regulatory requirements.\n\nEMMNet: Sensor Networking for Electricity Meter Monitoring\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZhi-Ting Lin\n\n2010-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Smart sensors are emerging as a promising technology for a large number of application domains. This paper presents a collection of requirements and guidelines that serve as a basis for a general smart sensor architecture to monitor electricity meters. It also presents an electricity meter monitoring network, named EMMNet, comprised of data collectors, data concentrators, hand-held devices, a centralized server, and clients. EMMNet provides long-distance communication capabilities, which make it suitable suitable for complex urban environments. In addition, the operational cost of EMMNet is low, compared with other existing remote meter monitoring systems based on GPRS. A new dynamic tree protocol based on the application requirements which can significantly improve the reliability of the network is also proposed. We are currently conducting tests on five networks and investigating network problems for further improvements.

Two examiners clinically graded the flare in 110 eyes. The flare was then measured using the Kowa laser flare meter. Twenty-nine eyes were graded as anterior chamber flare +2; for 18 of these, the clinicians were in agreement, the rest differed by the order of one grade. The range of the laser flare meter for these eyes was 5.2-899.1 photons/ms. The median value was 41.4. Seventy-four eyes were graded with flare +1. Agreement was established in 51 of these eyes. Disagreement for the rest was again by the order of 1, and the flare meter range was 1.1-169.9 photons/ms, median value 18.4. For the clinical measure of flare 0, the clinicians disagreed on three out of five eyes. The flare meter readings ranged from 2.5 to 14.1Â photons/ms, median value 9.9. Only two eyes were graded with flare +3 and there was one step disagreement on both of them. We found little evidence of association between the flare readings and intraocular pressure or age. Our findings suggest that clinical evaluation of aqueous flare is subjective. Compared with the Kowa laser flare meter's numeric readings, the discrepancies observed indicate that clinical grading is an approximate science. The laser flare meter provides an accurate, reproducible, non-invasive assessment of aqueous flare that can prove valuable in research and clinical decisions.\n\nIntermediate photovoltaic system application experiment operational performance report. Volume 3 for Beverly High School, Beverly, MA\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\n1981-12-01\n\nSoftware and hardware problems resulted in the loss of sixteen days of data during September. The total electrical energy produced by the PV system during September is listed as 3986 kWh. The meter is manually read only about every other month, but readings which bracket a majority of the days of the month of September indicate an average daily output of 220 kWh per day or 6600 kWh total for the month. Using the average inverter efficiency of 88 percent, shown in report Module 4, infers that the array produced 7500 kWh of dc output energy during September. Similar analysis for October, when data was collected for 26 of 31 days, infers that total system output for the full 31 days was approximately 6800 kWh rather than the recorded value of 5782 kWh.\n\nFundamental principles of rotary displacement meters\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nRosen, J. [Schlumberger Industries, Owenton, KY (United States)\n\n1995-12-01\n\nThe gas meter exists to continually and accurately measure the volume of gas supplied over the complete flow range of the load. In effect the gas meter serves as the {open_quotes}cash register{close_quotes} of the gas industry; its accurate and dependable performance ensures fair dealings for both the supplier and the user. An investment both in and of itself, the gas meter should be chosen as a function of its usefullness both over the short term and the long term. Thus in addition to initial cost, one must take into account various associated factors, costs and benefits, including the following: Design Characteristics Application, suitability, Meter features and options, Operation constraints, Installation, Service and maintenance, Repair and replacement, Life expectancy, Compatibility with complimentary products, Correcting devices, Remote reading capabilities, Data generation and gathering, Upgradeabilty. This paper will look at one positive displacement meter, the Rotary meter, and address the fundamentals principals of the technology as well as looking at some of the benefits derived from its application. Rotary positive displacement meters were introduced at the end of last century. Used primarily for metering transmission sized loads, the meters` measuring capabilities have extended to cover nearly all areas of distribution with exception of domestic applications. Rotary meters are available in rated capacities from 800 cfh to 102,000 cfh and operating pressures from 175 PSIG to 1440 PSIG. The use of rotary meters on load ranges in the 800 to 10,000 cfh category has increased and is replacing the use of diaphragm meters because of the smaller relative size of rotaries, and improvements in rangeabilities in the last few years. Turbine meters are usually the meter of choice on loads over 16,000 cfh unless a meter with high rangeability is required because of varying load characteristics, in which case a large foot mounted rotary might still be selected.\n\nRFID-BASED Prepaid Power Meter\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nTeymourzadeh, Rozita\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAn Electric power meter is an important component in electric energy service.

Y.; Han, S. C.; Han, Y. H.; Park, B. J.; Bae, Y. C.; Lee, W. R.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA superconductor flywheel energy storage system (SFES) is an electro-mechanical battery which transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy for storage, and vice versa. A 10 kWh class flywheel energy storage system (FESS) has been developed to evaluate the feasibility of a 35 kWh class SFES with a flywheel Ip/If ratio larger than 1. The 10 kWh class FESS is composed of a main frame, a composite flywheel, active magnetic dampers (AMDs), a permanent magnet bearing, and a motor/generator. The flywheel of the FESS rotates at a very high speed to store energy, while being levitated by a permanent magnetic bearing and a pair of thrust AMDs. The 10 kWh class flywheel is mainly composed of a composite rotor assembly, where most of the energy is stored, two radial and two thrust AMD rotors, which dissipate vibration at critical speeds, a permanent magnet rotor, which supports most of the flywheel weight, a motor rotor, which spins the flywheel, and a central hollow shaft, where the parts are assembled and aligned to. The stators of each of the main components are assembled on to housings, which are assembled and aligned to the main frame. Many factors have been considered while designing each part of the flywheel, stator and frame. In this study, a 10 kWh class flywheel energy storage system has been designed and constructed for test operation.\n\nFY 2015 Report: Developing Remote Sensing Capabilities for Meter-Scale Sea Ice Properties\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2015-09-30\n\nalbedo retrieval from MERIS dataâPart 2: Case studies and trends of sea ice albedo and melt ponds in the Arctic for years 2002â2011.

This study was aimed to develop the relationships among NNI, leaf N gradient, chlorophyll meter (CM) readings gradient, and positional differences chlorophyll meter index [PDCMI, the ratio of CM readings between different leaf layers (LLs) of crop canopy] and to validate the accuracy and stability of these relationships across the different LLs, years, sites, and cultivars. Six multi-N rates (0-320 kg ha -1 ) field experiments were conducted with four summer maize cultivars (Zhengdan958, Denghai605, Xundan20, and Denghai661) at two different sites located in China. Six summer maize plants per plot were harvested at each sampling stage to assess NNI, leaf N concentration and CM readings of different LLs during the vegetative growth period. The results showed that the leaf N gradient, CM readings gradient and PDCMI of different LLs decreased, while the NNI values increased with increasing N supply. The leaf N gradient and CM readings gradient increased gradually from top to bottom of the canopy and CM readings of the bottom LL were more sensitive to changes in plant N concentration. The significantly positive relationship between NNI and CM readings of different LLs ( LL 1 to LL 3) was observed, yet these relationships varied across the years. In contrast, the relationships between NNI and PDCMI of different LLs ( LL 1 to LL 3) were significantly negative. The strongest relationship between PDCMI and NNI which was stable across the cultivars and years was observed for PDCMI1-3 (NNI = -5.74 Ã PDCMI1-3+1.5, R 2 = 0.76 ** ). Additionally, the models developed in this study were validated with the data acquired from two independent experiments to assess their accuracy of prediction. The root mean square error value of 0.1 indicated that the most accurate and robust relationship was\n\nMetering; Accurate, fast response the key.

Interview study of the expectations on the new meters and their knowledge of electricity and energy; Maetaren kom - vad haende? Intervjustudie om kundernas foervaentan paa de nya elmaetarna och deras kunskaper om el och energi\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLindstedt, Inger; Maardsjoe Blume, Karin\n\n2008-11-15\n\nThe Swedish Parliament has announced that from 1 July 2009 all electricity meters will be read at least once a month. This has resulted in the electricity grid companies having to install new electricity meters that can be read by remote control. The long-term objectives of such a change are that bills will be clearer and easier to interpret, customers will be more aware of their energy consumption and that consumption will gradually be reduced. The replacement of electricity meters has been an important issue for the energy industry - particularly network operators. It not only involves investing in new technology and new routines, but also new opportunities for providing customers with more and better information about their electricity and energy consumption. Important customer-related questions need to be addressed in connection with this technological change-over, such as whether people are interested in this new technology, whether they are interested in energy issues, and whether they are willing to take an active interest in their electricity consumption. In an attempt to answer these questions, we conducted interviews with customers in Alvesta and Gothenburg. In both places we interviewed 7 people, all of whom were selected on the basis of criteria relating to low/high consumption, house/flat dweller, man/woman and age. Each interview lasted approximately 45 minutes. Although the replacement of electricity meters has been a big step for the electricity suppliers, as far as their customers are concerned it seems relatively insignificant. While those interviewed had a vague notion that the meters would be changed, very few knew why. The respondents didn't have any particular expectations in terms of results either, and there was no difference in expectations between those respondents with new meters or those without. It is worth pointing out that expectations of and advantages with the new meters all relate to the production of more uniform bills. The\n\nFrom the manual meter reading to Smart Metering.

To evaluate the effect of plastic wrap on dental X-ray machine kVp meters, a radiation output device was used to measure output in mR/ma.s. An intraoral dental X-ray unit (S.S. White Model number-sign 90W) was used to make the exposures. First, the kVp meter was not covered with plastic wrap and output readings were recorded at various kVp settings with the milliamperage and time held constant. Secondly, the same kVp settings were selected before the plastic wrap was placed. Milliamperage and time were again held to the same constant. The X-ray console was then covered with plastic wrap prior to measuring the output for each kVp. The wrap possessed a static charge. This charge induced erroneous kVp meter readings. Out-put readings at the various induced kVp settings were then recorded. A kVp of 50 with no wrap present resulted in the same output as a kVp of 50 induced to read 40 or 60 kVp by the presence of wrap. Similar results were obtained at other kVp settings. This indicates that the plastic wrap influences only the kVp meter needle and not the actual kilovoltage of the X-ray machine. Dental X-ray machine operators should select kVp meter readings prior to placing plastic wrap and should not adjust initial settings if the meter is deflected later by the presence of wrap. The use of such a procedure will result in proper exposures, fewer retakes, and less patient radiation. If plastic wrap leads to consistent exposure errors, clinicians may wish to use a 0.5% sodium hypochlorite disinfectant as an alternative to the barrier technique\n\nNaval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport utilities metering, Phase 1\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nCarroll, D.M.\n\n1992-11-01\n\nPacific Northwest Laboratory developed this report for the US Navy`s Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, Rhode Island (NUWC).

Deregulation of electricity markets around the world is pushing players to face competition. Supply companies are thus looking for ways to improve efficiency and gain Client's preference and confidence. Taking advantage of the technological innovation, AMR and Energy Management Systems can be a vital weapon in such a competitive scenario. Providing a wide range of services, from remote metering of electricity consumption to monitoring of supply quality, these systems can arm electrical utilities with necessary tools to improve supply efficiency and customer services. Following these trends, electrical utilities around Europe and all over the world are testing AMR and Energy Management solutions, and tailoring systems to their needs and modus operandi. Based on previous experience, gained with R&D work since 1991, EDP, the Portuguese Electrical Utility, is currently working on such systems and planning field trials in several scenarios. This paper presents EDP's approach towards AMR and Energy Management Systems, describing the system architecture and services; the way interoperability with existing commercial and technical management systems is planned; how technical solutions are planned to be tested and field trials are designed.

This paper examines the value of the bill savings that customers receive under net metering, and the associated role of retail rate design, based on a sample of approximately two hundred residential customers of California's two largest electric utilities. We find that the bill savings per kWh of PV electricity generated varies by more than a factor of four across the customers in the sample, which is largely attributable to the inclining block structure of the utilities' residential retail rates. We also compare the bill savings under net metering to that received under three potential alternative compensation mechanisms, based on California's Market Price Referent (MPR). We find that net metering provides significantly greater bill savings than a full MPR-based feed-in tariff, but only modestly greater savings than alternative mechanisms under which hourly or monthly net excess generation is compensated at the MPR rate. - Highlights: â We examine the value of bill savings under net metering to PV owners in California. â Bill savings per kWh of PV generation varies by a factor of four with net metering. The variation is attributable to rate design, the unique inclining block structure. â The median value of bill savings is reduced by 40-67% with MPR feed-in tariff. â The median value of bill savings is reduced by 6-12% with hourly netting.\n\nDesign of a 1-kWh bipolar nickel hydrogen battery\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCataldo, R.

After a recall of legislation regarding exposure to electromagnetic waves, this first part present the two tested meters (Linky of first and third generation, G1 and G3), the performed tests, measurements devices and method. It more precisely reports investigations performed on these both meters, and a comparison with other home appliances. The second part reports additional measurements performed with both meters according to the same methodology, but with the use of a new electric field probe which allows more precise measurements. Maximum electric and magnetic fields have been measured. The third part reports field measurements performed with the same methodology but in dwellings equipped with Linky meters of first generation (G1). Exposure levels have been measured at the vicinity of meters and in other parts of the dwelling\n\nPortable wireless metering\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDiPaola, L [Powtel Monitoring Systems, Inc., Ajax, ON (Canada)\n\n1996-12-31\n\nPortable meters were discussed as alternatives to standard billing meters for temporary installations. Current, voltage and power factor at a distribution station were measured to calculate kW and kVAR, using an easy to install product that communicates live readings directly to the existing billing system. A background of situations where temporary metering is a possible alternative to regular meters was presented. Use of electronic, clamp on Electronic Recording Ammeters (ERA) and their drawbacks were discussed. An improved temporary metering solution using FM radio transmission to deliver live data to a receiving device, the Eagle Series 3500, was introduced. Improvements over previous ERA systems were discussed, including accuracy, lack of batteries, immediate confirmation of functionality, current, voltage and power factor monitoring, direct feed to billing system, line crew savings, need for only a single unit at any given site, bi-directional power flow metering, independent report storage media, and a portable voltage and P.F. diagnostic tool. Details of trial applications at the Utopia distribution station west of Barrie, ON were presented. This technology was said to be still in the testing stage, but its flexibility and economy were sonsidered to be very promising for future application.\n\nReal time Aanderaa current meter data collection system\n\nDigital Repository Service at National Institute of Oceanography (India)\n\nAshokKumar, K.; Diwan, S.G.\n\nAanderaa current meters are widely used for recording the current speed and such other 4 parameters by deploying them over extended period of time.

Vernooy\n\n2013-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The utilization of high accuracy sensors in harsh environments has been limited by the temperature constraints of the control electronics that must be co-located with the sensor. Several methods of remote interrogation for resonant sensors are presented in this paper which would allow these sensors to be extended to harsh environments. This work in particular demonstrates for the first time the ability to acoustically drive a silicon comb drive resonator into resonance and electromagnetically couple to the resonator to read its frequency. The performance of this system was studied as a function of standoff distance demonstrating the ability to excite and read the device from 22 cm when limited to drive powers of 30 mW. A feedback architecture was implemented that allowed the resonator to be driven into resonance from broadband noise and a standoff distance of 15 cm was demonstrated. It is emphasized that no junction-based electronic device was required to be co-located with the resonator, opening the door for the use of silicon-based, high accuracy MEMS devices in high temperature wireless applications.\n\nThe disc pasture meter: Possible applications in grazing management.\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nThe disc meter is a simple inexpensive instrument which may be used to make rapid yield estimates of standing forage.

[Gestalt, Camden, NJ (United States); Ferguson, P.D. [Newmarket Hydro Ltd., Newmarket, ON (Canada)\n\n2006-07-01\n\nThe full value of smart metering programs will be realized when information and communication capabilities are used to enable distribution automation, intelligent grids, and sufficient data management that will transform interval meter data into useful information. By leveraging and managing meter data effectively, utilities can increase their operational efficiency, improve their understanding of customers' needs, and develop more effective demand side management programs. This presentation examined some of the changing priorities of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) strategies, and provided details of meter data management (MDM) technologies developed to help utilities increase efficiency, cut costs and provide better service to their customers. An MDM system is the set of data bases and applications required to provide utilities with a solution for the data retention, analysis and storage repository gaps that will be created when monthly manual meter readings are replaced with AMI systems. In order to resolve storage, functionality and legacy integration gaps, MDM systems must be scalable systems that can support large and small quantities of meter data, and must also conform to industry standard data warehouse designs. Data structure in the systems must support both regulated and deregulated markets, and be capable of providing extensive graphical, tabular and Excel export of the metered and totalized data from the interval to system level. MDM systems can provide improved support for demand response decision-making processes; distribution planning and reliability; outage management; revenue assurance; forecasting; and curtailment. It was concluded that MDM systems can be used to improve processes and provide additional benefits well beyond the meter reading and billing process benefits originally identified by utilities as a primary goal of implementing AMI. refs., tabs., figs.\n\nCalibration of ionization chamber and GM counter survey meters, (1)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBingo, Kazuyoshi; Kajimoto, Yoichi; Suga, Shin-ichi\n\n1978-01-01\n\nThree types of ionization chamber survey meters and a type of GM counter survey meter were calibrated for measuring the Î²-ray absorbed dose rate in a working area. To estimate the Î²-ray absorbed dose rate, a survey meter was used without and with a filter. A reading of survey meter's indicator measured with the filter was subtracted from a reading measured without the filter, and then the absorbed dose rate was obtained by multiplying this remainder by a conversion coefficient. The conversion coefficients were roughly constant with distance more than 8 cm (ionization chamber survey meters) and with distance more than 5 cm (GM counter survey meter). The conversion coefficient was dependent on Î²-ray energies. In order to measure the absorbed dose rate of tissue whose epidermal thickness is 40 mg/cm 2 , the constant value, 4 (mrad/h)/(mR/h), was chosen independently of Î²-ray energies as the conversion coefficient of three types of ionization chamber survey meters. The conversion coefficient of the GM counter survey meter was more energy dependent than that of every type of ionization chamber survey meter.

Since 2006, the utility has installed more than 230,000 Smart Meters throughout its service territory in an effort to provide better services to its customers. This initiative represents the largest operational advanced metering infrastructure network in Canada. This move was necessary before time-of-use rates can be implemented in Ottawa. The Smart Meters deliver data wirelessly to Hydro Ottawa's Customer Information System for billing and eliminating manual readings. The Smart Meters are designed to promote more efficient use of electricity. The Government of Ontario has passed legislation requiring the installation of Smart Meters throughout the province by the end of 2010\n\nA Routing Algorithm for WiFi-Based Wireless Sensor Network and the Application in Automatic Meter Reading\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLi Li\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The Automatic Meter Reading (AMR network for the next generation Smart Grid is required to possess many essential functions, such as data reading and writing, intelligent power transmission, and line damage detection. However, the traditional AMR network cannot meet the previous requirement. With the development of the WiFi sensor node in the low power cost, a new kind of wireless sensor network based on the WiFi technology can be used in application. In this paper, we have designed a new architecture of WiFi-based wireless sensor network, which is suitable for the next generation AMR system. We have also proposed a new routing algorithm called Energy Saving-Based Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (E-HWMP on the premise of current algorithm, which can improve the energy saving of the HWMP and be suitable for the WiFi-based wireless sensor network. The simulation results show that the life cycle of network is extended.\n\nIMAGE TYPE WATER METER CHARACTER RECOGNITION BASED ON EMBEDDED DSP\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLIU Ying; HAN Yan-bin; ZHANG Yu-lin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn the paper, we combined DSP processor with image processing algorithm and studied the method of water meter character recognition. We collected water meter image through camera at a fixed angle, and the projection method is used to recognize those digital images. The experiment results show that the method can recognize the meter characters accurately and artificial meter reading is replaced by automatic digital recognition, which improves working efficiency.\n\nRFID technology for reading of electricity measurements; RFID-lukumoduli saehkoeenergiamittaustietojen luentaan\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nVehvilaeinen, T [MX Electrix Oy, Paelkaene (Finland)\n\n2006-12-19\n\nIn the project is developed a reading module for electricity energy meters. The module saves and transmits the meter's energy measurement and power quality data. The project is based on RFID technology, which is a new application in reading of electricity measurements. The reading module of the meter is read via the customers GSM-telephone, which has a RFID- interface. The reading data is transmitted automatically from the module to the GSM hone, when the customer visits the meter. The utility sends the reading request and needed identifier to the customers GSM. After the reading the measured data is transferred to the utility's data base automatically. The utility can send information to the customer of used energy, pricing, make offers etc. The customer can transfer the data to his/hers own computer or get the information via the internet.

This will put higher demands for stricter requirements on the available transmission capacity and on the security of supply. Elaborate metering systems is one condition for meeting the challenges facing the electricity market. Electricity metering is also relevant for a range of applications such as remote reading, management of customer relations, demand management and value added services. Utilizing meter data to provide feedback enables use of the electricity metering systems in order to obtain electricity conservation. As of July 2009 the Swedish electricity distributors are required to read and report the electricity use on a monthly basis for all customers with a safety fuse of up to 63 amps. Remote electricity reading is the main function in the current system, which means that the distribution system operator (DSO) is provided with metering data without the need for manual reading and that the customers are charged on a monthly basis for their actual electricity use (rather than an estimate). One reason for the introduction of monthly billing, based on actual electricity use, was to visualize the electricity use to the households. For the electricity use to become visual and controllable, it is important that customers receive feedback on their electricity use. The introduction of monthly billing implied an improvement of the feedback, but it can be further improved in order to allow greater savings. Improved feedback can be given by synthesizing high-resolution data to information presented in new ways, for example by means of in-home-displays, and web-based interfaces combined with counselling. Research shows that the electricity\n\nEvaluation of a portable urinary pH meter and reagent strips.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDe Coninck, Vincent; Keller, Etienne Xavier; RodrÃ­guez-Monsalve, MarÃ­a; Haymann, Jean-Philippe; Doizi, Steeve; Traxer, Olivier\n\n2018-04-27\n\nTo evaluate a portable electronic pH meter and to put its accuracy in perspective with reagent strips read by a layperson, a healthcare professional and an electronic reading device. Based on a pre-analysis on 20 patients, a sample size of 77 urine aliquots from healthy volunteers was necessary to obtain sufficient study power. Measurements of urinary pH were obtained by use of reagent strips, a portable pH meter and a laboratory pH meter (gold standard). Reagents strips were read by a professional experienced in interpreting strips, a layperson, and an electronic strip reader. The mean matched pair difference between measurement methods was analyzed by the paired t-test. The degree of correlation and agreement were evaluated by the Pearson's correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots, respectively. The mean matched pair difference between the gold standard and all other pH measurement methods was the smallest with the portable electronic pH meter (bias 0.01, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.08; p=0.89), followed by strips read by a professional (bias -0.09, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.02; p=0.10), layperson (bias -0.17, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.04; p=0.015) and electronic strip reader (bias -0.29, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.16; pmeter achieved the highest Pearson's correlation coefficient and narrowest 95% limits of agreement, followed by strip interpretation by a professional, the electronic strip reader and the layperson. In order to quantify the ability of pH measurement methods to correctly classify values within a predefined urinary pH target range, we performed classification tests for several stones. The portable electronic pH meter outperformed all other measurement methods for negative predictive values. Findings of the current study support that the portable electronic pH meter is a reliable pH measuring device. It seems to be more accurate compared to reagent strips readings.\n\nApplications of the automatic meter reading techniques at the Brazilian gas domestic market; Application des techniques de releve automatique des compteurs sur le marche domestique Bresilien du gaz\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nVenancio, J.; Monteiro, F.

Using a set of rhymed and metered proverbs, as well as nonrhymed and nonmetered versions of these proverbs, the present study reveals this hitherto unspecified difficulty of comprehension to be specifically driven by perceived ambiguity. Roman Jakobson was the 1st to propose this hypothesis, in 1960. He suggested that \"ambiguity is an intrinsic, inalienable feature\" of \"parallelistic\" diction of which the combination of rhyme and meter is a pronounced example. Our results show that ambiguity indeed explains a substantial portion of the rhyme- and meter-driven difficulty of comprehension. Longer word-reading times differentially reflected ratings for ambiguity and comprehension difficulty. However, the ambiguity effect is not \"inalienable.\" Rather, many rhymed and metered sentences turned out to be low in ambiguity.

We assessed the diagnostic performance of this system for abdominal CT interpretation. Performance was compared with an emergency department clinical monitor using a DICOM viewer. A total of 100 abdominal CT examinations were presented to four observers. There were 56 examinations showing appendicitis and 44 which were normal. The observers viewed the images using a UMPC display and an LCD monitor and rated each examination on a five-point scale. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to test for differences. The sensitivity and specificities of all observers were similarly high. The average area under the ROC curve for readings performed on the UMPC and the LCD monitor was 0.959 and 0.976, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two display systems for interpreting abdominal CTs. The web-based mobile teleradiology system appears to be feasible for reading abdominal CTs for diagnosing appendicitis and may be valuable in emergency teleconsultation.

Due to the effect of liquid in a wet gas, the differential pressure over the converging section of a Venturi meter is higher than that when a pure gas flows through with the same flow rate. This phenomenon is referred to as over-reading. Thus, a correction for the over-reading is required. Most of the existing wet gas models are more suitable for higher pressure (>2 MPa) than lower pressure ( 0.5) than lower quality (<0.5) in recent years. However, conditions of lower pressure and lower quality also widely exist in the gas and oil industries. By comparing the performances of eight existing wet gas models in low-pressure range of 0.26â0.86 MPa and low-quality range of 0.07â0.36 with a vertically mounted Venturi meter of diameter ratio 0.45, de Leeuw's model was proven to perform best. Derived from de Leeuw's model, a modified model with better performance for the low-pressure and low-quality ranges was obtained. Experimental data showed that the root mean square of the relative errors of the over-reading was 2.30%.

The appropriate use of radiation detector is significant in order to maintain a radiation and contamination free workplace. This paper reports on the development of a prototype of PIC-based digital survey meter. This prototype of digital survey meter is a hand held instrument for general-purpose radiation monitoring and surface contamination meter. Generally, the device is able to detect some or all of the three major types of ionizing radiation, namely alpha, beta and gamma. It uses a Geiger-Muller tube as a radiation detector, which converts gamma radiation quanta to electric pulses and further processed by the electronic devices. The development involved the design of the controller, counter and high voltage circuit. All these circuit are assembled and enclosed in a plastic casing together with a GM detector and LCD display to form a prototype survey meter. The number of counts of the pulses detected by the survey meter varies due to the random nature of radioactivity. By averaging the reading over a time-period, more accurate and stable reading is achieved. To test the accuracy and the linearity of the design, the prototype was calibrated using standard procedure at the Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory (SSDL) in MINT.

When DPC was experiencing diminished service within its analog cellular-based data communications system, it was presented with an opportunity to install a new automated telecommunications system that would provide secure collection of meter readings from all of its substations. DPC decided to evaluate an advanced multifunctional digital meter from Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL). The SEL-734 Revenue Metering System offers complete instantaneous metering functions, including voltages, currents, power, energy and power factor. Other capabilities include predictive demand, time-of-use metering, automatic voltage monitoring, harmonics metering and synchrophasor measurement. From a metering perspective, DPC wanted to perform daily load profiles and interval-by-interval metering of their delivery points for billing purposes. They also wanted to provide real-time monitoring of electricity being delivered for both generation and transmission purposes and to make that information available to a distribution SCADA system for their members. The SEL-734 Revenue Meter was well suited to those needs. The SEL-734 provides very high-accuracy energy metering, load profile data collection, instantaneous power measurements, power quality monitoring, and communicates simultaneously over a modem, serial ports, and wide area networks (WAN). The meter is backed with a ten-year warranty as well as field support engineers. 5 figs.\n\nTwo-channel neutron boron meter\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChen Yongqing; Yin Guowei; Chai Songshan; Deng Zhaoping; Zhou Bin\n\n1993-09-01\n\nThe two-channel neutron boron meter is a continuous on-line measuring device to measure boron concentration of primary cooling liquid of reactors.

The air-kerma area product, PKA, is a dosimetric quantity that can be directly related to the patient dose and used for risk assessment associated with different x-ray examinations. The calibration of reference KAP-meters at the SSDL gives important information on parameters influencing the calibration factor for different types of KAP-meters. The use of reference KAP-meters calibrated at the SSDL is an easy and reliable way to calibrate or verify the PKA indicated by the x-ray equipment out in the clinics. Material and methods. Twelve KAP-meters were calibrated at the SSDL by use of the substitution method at five diagnostic radiation qualities (RQRs). Results. The calibration factors varied from 0.94 to 1.18. The energy response of the individual KAP-meters varied by a total of 20% between the different RQRs and the typical chamber transmission factors ranged from 0.78 to 0.91. Discussion. It is important to use a calibrated reference KAP-meter and a harmonised calibration method in the PKA calibration in hospitals. The obtained uncertainty in the PKA readings is comparable with other calibration methods if the information in the calibration certificate is correct used, corrections are made and proper positioning of the KAP-chamber is performed. This will ensure a reliable estimate of the patient dose and a proper optimisation of conventional x-ray examinations and interventional procedures\n\nDecentralized electrification by small-scale hydraulic stations : a viable solution in mountainous regions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDahman Saidi, A.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe installation of a small-scale hydroelectric generating station to supply electricity to the small community of Takordmi in Morocco was described.
