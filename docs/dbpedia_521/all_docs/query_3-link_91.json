        "text": "HALO--a Java framework for precise transcript half-life determination.\n\nPubMed\n\nFriedel, Caroline C; Kaufmann, Stefanie; DÃ¶lken, Lars; Zimmer, Ralf\n\n2010-05-01\n\nRecent improvements in experimental technologies now allow measurements of de novo transcription and/or RNA decay at whole transcriptome level and determination of precise transcript half-lives. Such transcript half-lives provide important insights into the regulation of biological processes and the relative contributions of RNA decay and de novo transcription to differential gene expression. In this article, we present HALO (Half-life Organizer), the first software for the precise determination of transcript half-lives from measurements of RNA de novo transcription or decay determined with microarrays or RNA-seq. In addition, methods for quality control, filtering and normalization are supplied. HALO provides a graphical user interface, command-line tools and a well-documented Java application programming interface (API). Thus, it can be used both by biologists to determine transcript half-lives fast and reliably with the provided user interfaces as well as software developers integrating transcript half-life analysis into other gene expression profiling pipelines. Source code, executables and documentation are available at http://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/software/halo.\n\nUsing gamma distribution to determine half-life of rotenone, applied in freshwater.\n\nPubMed\n\nRohan, Maheswaran; Fairweather, Alastair; Grainger, Natasha\n\n2015-09-15\n\nFollowing the use of rotenone to eradicate invasive pest fish, a dynamic first-order kinetic model is usually used to determine the half-life and rate at which rotenone dissipated from the treated waterbody. In this study, we investigate the use of a stochastic gamma model for determining the half-life and rate at which rotenone dissipates from waterbodies. The first-order kinetic and gamma models produced similar values for the half-life (4.45 days and 5.33 days respectively) and days to complete dissipation (51.2 days and 52.48 days respectively). However, the gamma model fitted the data better and was more flexible than the first-order kinetic model, allowing us to use covariates and to predict a possible range for the half-life of rotenone. These benefits are particularly important when examining the influence that different environmental factors have on rotenone dissipation and when trying to predict the rate at which rotenone will dissipate during future operations. We therefore recommend that in future the gamma distribution model is used when calculating the half-life of rotenone in preference to the dynamic first-order kinetics model.

E.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nA high-precision half-life measurement for the superallowed Î²+ transition between the isospin T =1 /2 mirror nuclei 21Na and 21Ne has been performed at the TRIUMF-ISAC radioactive ion beam facility yielding T1 /2=22.4506 (33 ) s, a result that is a factor of 4 more precise than the previous world-average half-life for 21Na and represents the single most precisely determined half-life for a transition between mirror nuclei to date. The contribution to the uncertainty in the 21Na F tmirror value due to the half-life is now reduced to the level of the nuclear-structure-dependent theoretical corrections, leaving the branching ratio as the dominant experimental uncertainty.\n\nDetermination of photon emission probability for the main gamma ray and half-life measurements of 64Cu.\n\nPubMed\n\nPibida, L; Zimmerman, B; Bergeron, D E; Fitzgerald, R; Cessna, J T; King, L\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) performed new standardization measurements for 64 Cu. As part of this work the photon emission probability for the main gamma-ray line and the half-life were determined using several high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. Half-life determinations were also carried out with a NaI(Tl) well counter and two pressurized ionization chambers.

Precise determination of ft values for superallowed mixed transitions between mirror nuclides could provide an avenue to test the theoretical corrections used to extract the Vud matrix element from superallowed pure Fermi transitions. Calculation of the ft value requires the half-life, branching ratio, and Q value. 25Al decay is of particular interest as its half-life is derived from a series of conflicting measurements, and the largest uncertainty on the ft value stems from the half-life uncertainty. The life-time was determined by the Î² counting of implanted 25Al on a Ta foil that was removed from the beam for counting. The 25Al beam was produced by a transfer reaction and separated by the TwinSol facility of the Nuclear Science Laboratory of the University of Notre Dame. The 25Al results will be presented with preliminary results of more recent half-life measurements.

E.; Ball, G. C.; Leslie, J. R.; Austin, R. A. E.; Bandyopadhyay, D.; Chaffey, A.; Chakrawarthy, R. S.; Garrett, P. E.; Hackman, G.; Hyland, B.; Kanungo, R.; Leach, K. G.; Mattoon, C. M.; Morton, A. C.; Pearson, C. J.; Phillips, A. A.; Ressler, J. J.; Sarazin, F.; Savajols, H.; Schumaker, M. A.; Wong, J.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe half-life of the superallowed Î²+ emitter Ga62 has been measured at TRIUMF's Isotope Separator and Accelerator facility using a fast-tape-transport system and 4Ï continuous-flow gas proportional counter to detect the positrons from the decay of Ga62 to the daughter Zn62. The result, T1/2=116.100Â±0.025 ms, represents the most precise measurement to date (0.022%) for any superallowed Î²-decay half-life. When combined with six previous measurements of the Ga62 half-life, a new world average of T1/2=116.121Â±0.021 ms is obtained. This new half-life measurement results in a 20% improvement in the precision of the Ga62 superallowed ft value while reducing its mean by 0.9Ï to ft=3074.3(12) s. The impact of this half-life measurement on precision tests of the CVC hypothesis and isospin symmetry breaking corrections for Aâ©¾62 superallowed decays is discussed.\n\nImproved half-life determination and Î²-delayed Î³-ray spectroscopy for 18Ne decay\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrinyer, G. F.; Ball, G. C.; Bouzomita, H.; Ettenauer, S.; Finlay, P.; Garnsworthy, A. B.; Garrett, P. E.; Green, K. L.; Hackman, G.; Leslie, J. R.; Pearson, C. J.; Rand, E. T.; Sumithrarachchi, C. S.; Svensson, C. E.; Thomas, J. C.; Triambak, S.; Williams, S. J.\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThe half-life of the superallowed Fermi Î²+ emitter 18Ne has been determined to Â±0.07% precision by counting 1042 keV delayed Î³ rays that follow approximately 8% of all Î² decays. The deduced half-life, T1/2=1.6648(11) s, includes a 0.7% correction that accounts for systematic losses associated with rate-dependent detector pulse pileup that was determined using a recently developed Î³-ray photopeak-counting technique. This result is a factor of two times more precise than, and in excellent agreement with, a previous lower-statistics measurement that employed the same experimental setup. High-resolution Î²-delayed Î³-ray spectroscopy results for the relative Î³-ray intensities and Î²-decay branching ratios to excited states in the daughter 18F are also presented.\n\nA New Method to Determine the Half-Life for Penicillin Using Microcalorimeter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Z. X.; Zhao, W. W.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe dissolution process of penicillin in normal saline and isotonic glucose solution was reported using a microcalorimeter. Both the integral and differential heats of solution were measured. The quantitative relationships between the amount of heat released and the quantity of dissolved penicillin were established. Meanwhile, the kinetics and the half-life of the dissolution processes as well as the enthalpy of solution, the entropy of dissolution, and the free energy of dissolution were determined. The results showed that a change of the solvent from normal saline to isotonic glucose solution had little effect on the half-life of penicillin in the dissolution process, and there was no significant difference between the stabilities of penicillin in isotonic glucose solution and normal saline. Moreover, the dissolution process of penicillin in isotonic glucose solution followed the first-order kinetics. These results could provide a theoretical basis for the clinical applications of penicillin.\n\nProtein half-life determines expression of proteostatic networks in podocyte differentiation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchroeter, Christina B; Koehler, Sybille; Kann, Martin; Schermer, Bernhard; Benzing, Thomas; Brinkkoetter, Paul T; Rinschen, Markus M\n\n2018-04-25\n\nPodocytes are highly specialized, epithelial, postmitotic cells, which maintain the renal filtration barrier. When adapting to considerable metabolic and mechanical stress, podocytes need to accurately maintain their proteome. Immortalized podocyte cell lines are a widely used model for studying podocyte biology in health and disease in vitro. In this study, we performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis of the cultured human podocyte proteome in both proliferative and differentiated conditions at a depth of >7000 proteins. Similar to mouse podocytes, human podocyte differentiation involved a shift in proteostasis: undifferentiated podocytes have high expression of proteasomal proteins, whereas differentiated podocytes have high expression of lysosomal proteins. Additional analyses with pulsed stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and protein degradation assays determined protein dynamics and half-lives. These studies unraveled a globally increased stability of proteins in differentiated podocytes. Mitochondrial, cytoskeletal, and membrane proteins were stabilized, particularly in differentiated podocytes. Importantly, protein half-lives strongly contributed to protein abundance in each state. These data suggest that regulation of protein turnover of particular cellular functions determines podocyte differentiation, a paradigm involving mitophagy and, potentially, of importance in conditions of increased podocyte stress and damage.-Schroeter, C.

S.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nShort half-life is one of the key challenges in the field of therapeutic peptides. Various studies have reported enhancement in the stability of peptides using methods like chemical modifications, D-amino acid substitution, cyclization, replacement of labile aminos acids, etc. In order to study this scattered data, there is a pressing need for a repository dedicated to the half-life of peptides. To fill this lacuna, we have developed PEPlife (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/peplife), a manually curated resource of experimentally determined half-life of peptides. PEPlife contains 2229 entries covering 1193 unique peptides. Each entry provides detailed information of the peptide, like its name, sequence, half-life, modifications, the experimental assay for determining half-life, biological nature and activity of the peptide. We also maintain SMILES and structures of peptides. We have incorporated web-based modules to offer user-friendly data searching and browsing in the database. PEPlife integrates numerous tools to perform various types of analysis such as BLAST, Smith-Waterman algorithm, GGSEARCH, Jalview and MUSTANG. PEPlife would augment the understanding of different factors that affect the half-life of peptides like modifications, sequence, length, route of delivery of the peptide, etc. We anticipate that PEPlife will be useful for the researchers working in the area of peptide-based therapeutics.\n\nHalf-life of 51Mn\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGraves, Stephen A.; Ellison, Paul A.; Valdovinos, Hector F.; Barnhart, Todd E.; Nickles, Robert J.; Engle, Jonathan W.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe half-life of 51Mn was measured by serial gamma spectrometry of the 511-keV annihilation photon following decay by Î²+ emission. Data were collected every 100 seconds for 100,000-230,000 seconds within each measurement (n =4 ). The 511-keV incidence rate was calculated from the 511-keV spectral peak area and count duration, corrected for detector dead time and radioactive decay. Least-squares regression analysis was used to determine the half-life of 51Mn while accounting for the presence of background contaminants, notably 55Co. The result was 45.59 Â±0.07 min, which is the highest precision measurement to date and disagrees with the current Nuclear Data Sheets value by over 6 Ï .\n\nPrecise half-life measurement of the superallowed emitter 30S\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIacob, V. E.; Hardy, J. C.; Chen, L.; Horvat, V.; Bencomo, M.; Nica, N.; Park, H. I.; Roeder, B. T.; Saastamoinen, A.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe have measured the half-life of 30S, the parent of a superallowed 0+â0+Î² transition, to a high precision using very pure sources and a 4 Ï proportional gas counter to detect the decay positrons. Our result for the half-life is 1.179 92(34) s. As a by-product of this measurement, we determine the half-life of its daughter, 30P, to be 2.501(2) min.\n\nHalf-life of the superallowed Î²+ emitter Ne18\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrinyer, G. F.; Smith, M. B.; Andreoiu, C.; Andreyev, A. N.; Ball, G. C.; Bricault, P.; Chakrawarthy, R. S.; Daoud, J. J.; Finlay, P.; Garrett, P. E.; Hackman, G.; Hyland, B.; Leslie, J. R.; Morton, A. C.; Pearson, C. J.; Phillips, A. A.; Schumaker, M. A.; Svensson, C. E.; Valiente-DobÃ³n, J. J.; Williams, S. J.; Zganjar, E. F.\n\n2007-08-01\n\nThe half-life of Ne18 has been determined by detecting 1042-keV Î³ rays in the daughter F18 following the superallowed-Fermi Î²+ decay of samples implanted at the center of the 8ÏÎ³-ray spectrometer, a spherical array of 20 HPGe detectors. Radioactive Ne18 beams were produced on-line, mass-separated, and ionized using an electron-cyclotron-resonance ionization source at the ISAC facility at TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada. This is the first high-precision half-life measurement of a superallowed Fermi Î² decay to utilize both a large-scale HPGe spectrometer and the isotope separation on-line technique. The half-life of Ne18, 1.6656 Â± 0.0019 s, deduced following a 1.4Ï correction for detector pulse pile-up, is four times more precise than the previous world average. As part of an investigation into potential systematic effects, the half-life of the heavier isotope Ne23 was determined to be 37.11 Â± 0.06 s, a factor of 2 improvement over the previous precision.\n\nHalf-life determination for {sup 108}Ag and {sup 110}Ag\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZahn, Guilherme S.; Genezini, Frederico A.\n\n2014-11-11\n\nIn this work, the half-life of the short-lived silver radionuclides {sup 108}Ag and {sup 110}Ag were measured by following the activity of samples after they were irradiated in the IEA-R1 reactor. The results were then fitted using a non-paralizable dead time correction to the regular exponential decay and the individual half-life values obtained were then analyzed using both the Normalized Residuals and the Rajeval techniques, in order to reach the most exact and precise final values. To check the validity of dead-time correction, a second correction method was also employed by means of counting a long-lived {sup 60}Co radioactive sourcemoreÂ Â» together with the samples as a livetime chronometer. The final half-live values obtained using both dead-time correction methods were in good agreement, showing that the correction was properly assessed. The results obtained are partially compatible with the literature values, but with a lower uncertainty, and allow a discussion on the last ENSDF compilations' values.Â«Â less\n\nNew Measurement of the 60Fe Half-Life.\n\nPubMed\n\nRugel, G; Faestermann, T; Knie, K; Korschinek, G; Poutivtsev, M; Schumann, D; Kivel, N; GÃ¼nther-Leopold, I; Weinreich, R; Wohlmuther, M\n\n2009-08-14\n\nWe have made a new determination of the half-life of the radioactive isotope 60Fe using high precision measurements of the number of 60Fe atoms and their activity in a sample containing over 10(15) 60Fe atoms. Our new value for the half-life of 60Fe is (2.62+/-0.04) x 10(6) yr, significantly above the previously reported value of (1.49+/-0.27) x 10(6) yr. Our new measurement for the lifetime of 60Fe has significant implications for interpretations of galactic nucleosynthesis, for determinations of formation time scales of solids in the early Solar System, and for the interpretation of live 60Fe measurements from supernova-ejecta deposits on Earth.\n\nPrecision half-life measurement of 17F\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrodeur, M.; Nicoloff, C.; Ahn, T.; Allen, J.; Bardayan, D. W.; Becchetti, F. D.; Gupta, Y. K.; Hall, M. R.; Hall, O.; Hu, J.; Kelly, J. M.; Kolata, J. J.; Long, J.; O'Malley, P.; Schultz, B. E.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nBackground: The precise determination of f t values for superallowed mixed transitions between mirror nuclide are gaining attention as they could provide an avenue to test the theoretical corrections used to extract the Vu d matrix element from superallowed pure Fermi transitions. The 17F decay is particularly interesting as it proceeds completely to the ground state of 17O, removing the need for branching ratio measurements. The dominant uncertainty on the f t value of the 17F mirror transition stems from a number of conflicting half-life measurements. Purpose: A precision half-life measurement of 17F was performed and compared to previous results. Methods: The life-time was determined from the Î² counting of implanted 17F on a Ta foil that was removed from the beam for counting. The 17F beam was produced by transfers reaction and separated by the TwinSol facility of the Nuclear Science Laboratory of the University of Notre Dame. Results: The measured value of t1/2 new=64.402 (42) s is in agreement with several past measurements and represents one of the most precise measurements to date. In anticipation of future measurements of the correlation parameters for the decay and using the new world average t1/2 world=64.398 (61) s, we present a new estimate of the mixing ratio Ï for the mixed transition as well as the correlation parameters based on assuming Standard Model validity. Conclusions: The relative uncertainty on the new world average for the half-life is dominated by the large Ï2=31 of the existing measurements. More precision measurements with different systematics are needed to remedy to the situation.\n\nHalf-life of Si-32 from tandem-accelerator mass spectrometry\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nElmore, D.; Anantaraman, N.; Fulbright, H. W.; Gove, H. E.; Nishiizumi, K.; Murrell, M. T.; Honda, M.; Hans, H. S.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nA newly developed mass-spectrometry technique employing a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator together with a special beam-transport system and heavy-ion detector has been used to determine the half-life of Si-32. The result obtained, 108 plus or minus 18 yr, disagrees with the accepted value of 330 plus or minus 40 yr. The implications of the new half-life of Si-32, which is used for dating studies, are discussed.\n\nHigh-Precision Half-Life Measurement for the Superallowed Î²+ Emitter 22Mg\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDunlop, Michelle\n\n2017-09-01\n\nHigh precision measurements of the Ft values for superallowed Fermi beta transitions between 0+ isobaric analogue states allow for stringent tests of the electroweak interaction. These transitions provide an experimental probe of the Conserved-Vector-Current hypothesis, the most precise determination of the up-down element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, and set stringent limits on the existence of scalar currents in the weak interaction. To calculate the Ft values several theoretical corrections must be applied to the experimental data, some of which have large model dependent variations. Precise experimental determinations of the ft values can be used to help constrain the different models. The uncertainty in the 22Mg superallowed Ft value is dominated by the uncertainty in the experimental ft value. The adopted half-life of 22Mg is determined from two measurements which disagree with one another, resulting in the inflation of the weighted-average half-life uncertainty by a factor of 2. The 22Mg half-life was measured with a precision of 0.02% via direct Î² counting at TRIUMF's ISAC facility, leading to an improvement in the world-average half-life by more than a factor of 3.\n\nHalf-life of the superallowed {beta}{sup +} emitter {sup 18}Ne\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGrinyer, G.

Radioactive {sup 18}Ne beams were produced on-line, mass-separated, and ionized using an electron-cyclotron-resonance ionization source at the ISAC facility at TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada. This is the first high-precision half-life measurement of a superallowed Fermi {beta} decay to utilize both a large-scale HPGe spectrometer and the isotope separation on-line technique. The half-life of {sup 18}Ne, 1.6656 {+-} 0.0019 s,moreÂ Â» deduced following a 1.4{sigma} correction for detector pulse pile-up, is four times more precise than the previous world average.

V.; Pattrick, R. A. D.; Crowther, S. A.\n\n2008-11-15\n\nTo determine the half-life of {sup 130}Te we have analyzed multiple aliquots of geological telluride samples 100 times smaller than those previously reported using a unique resonance ionization mass spectrometer. We employ a low-fluence neutron irradiation that allows determination of parent and daughter from the same xenon isotopic analysis. Step heating of these irradiated samples allows the {sup 130}Xe/{sup 132}Xe ratio of fluids trapped inside the tellurides to be determined. Considering only samples where the trapped {sup 130}Xe/{sup 132}Xe ratio is demonstrably consistent with atmospheric xenon, we can avoid over- or under-estimating the half-life due to redistribution or inheritance ofmoreÂ Â» radiogenic {sup 130}Xe. Combining our work with literature data, it is clear that several relatively young samples have retained xenon quantitatively since formation, allowing the half-life to be determined as (8.0{+-}1.1)x10{sup 20} yr. Older samples have clearly been affected by post-formation processing. This suggests that there is little hope of monitoring solar luminosity through the geological record of {sup 126}Xe production by solar neutrinos, but it is possible that geologically useful chronological information can be obtained from this system.Â«Â less\n\nBeta Decay Half-Life of 84Mo\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStoker, J.

Treatment of the background and the poor statistics accumulated during the previous half-life measurement leave questions about statistical and systematic errors.

We have assessed how differences in absorption and half-life of cortisol influence glucocorticoid exposure. Forty-eight patients (21 M) aged between 6Â·1 and 20Â·3Â years with CAH due to CYP21A2 deficiency were studied. Each patient underwent a 24-h plasma cortisol profile with the morning dose used to calculate absorption parameters along with an intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone (15Â mg/m(2) body surface area) bolus assessment of half-life. Parameters derived were maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ), time of maximum plasma concentration (tmax ), time to attaining plasma cortisol concentration <100Â nmol/l and half-life of cortisol. Mean half-life was 76Â·5Â Â±Â 5Â·2 (range 40-225Â·3) min, Cmax 780Â·7Â Â±Â 61Â·6Â nmol/l and tmax 66Â·7 (range 20-118) min. Time taken to a plasma cortisol concentration less than 100Â nmol/l was 289 (range 140-540) min. Those with a fast half-life and slow tmax took longest to reach a plasma cortisol concentration less than 100Â nmol/l (380Â Â±Â 34Â·6Â min), compared to those with a slow half-life and fast tmax (298Â Â±Â 34Â·8Â min) and those with a fast half-life and fast tmax (249Â·5Â Â±Â 14Â·4Â min) (One-way anovaFÂ =Â 4Â·52; PÂ =Â 0Â·009). Both rate of absorption and half-life of cortisol in the circulation play important roles in determining overall exposure to oral glucocorticoid.

R.; da Cruz, M. T. F.; Hoffman, D. C.; Larimer, R.-M.; Lesko, K. T.; Norman, Eric B.\n\n1993-06-01\n\nIn the laboratory, 91Nb decays by electron capture with a 680-yr half-life. However, as a high energy cosmic ray, it would be stripped of its atomic electrons and would be able to undergo only Î²+ decay. We produced and chemically purified a sample of 91Nb and observed its decay with an array of Ge and NaI detectors. By following the Î²+ annihilation radiation, we were able to determine the Î²+ branching ratios of both the 105-keV, 61-d isomer and the ground state of 91Nb. The ground-state branch is (7.7+/-0.8)Ã10-3% leading to a Î²+ partial half-like of (8.8+/-1.9)Ã106 yr. Such a value of the half-life makes 91Nb a good candidate for determining the confinement time of this secondary component of the cosmic rays.\n\nPrecision half-life measurement of 11C: The most precise mirror transition F t value\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nValverde, A. A.; Brodeur, M.; Ahn, T.; Allen, J.; Bardayan, D. W.; Becchetti, F. D.; Blankstein, D.; Brown, G.; Burdette, D. P.; Frentz, B.; Gilardy, G.; Hall, M. R.; King, S.; Kolata, J. J.; Long, J.; Macon, K. T.; Nelson, A.; O'Malley, P. D.; Skulski, M.; Strauss, S. Y.; Vande Kolk, B.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nBackground: The precise determination of the F t value in T =1 /2 mixed mirror decays is an important avenue for testing the standard model of the electroweak interaction through the determination of Vu d in nuclear Î² decays. 11C is an interesting case, as its low mass and small QE C value make it particularly sensitive to violations of the conserved vector current hypothesis. The present dominant source of uncertainty in the 11CF t value is the half-life. Purpose: A high-precision measurement of the 11C half-life was performed, and a new world average half-life was calculated. Method: 11C was created by transfer reactions and separated using the TwinSol facility at the Nuclear Science Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame. It was then implanted into a tantalum foil, and Î² counting was used to determine the half-life. Results: The new half-life, t1 /2=1220.27 (26 ) s, is consistent with the previous values but significantly more precise. A new world average was calculated, t1/2 world=1220.41 (32 ) s, and a new estimate for the Gamow-Teller to Fermi mixing ratio Ï is presented along with standard model correlation parameters. Conclusions: The new 11C world average half-life allows the calculation of a F tmirror value that is now the most precise value for all superallowed mixed mirror transitions. This gives a strong impetus for an experimental determination of Ï , to allow for the determination of Vu d from this decay.\n\nPerfluorooctane Sulfonate Plasma Half-Life Determination and Long-Term Tissue Distribution in Beef Cattle (Bos taurus).\n\nPubMed\n\nLupton, Sara J; Dearfield, Kerry L; Johnston, John J; Wagner, Sarah; Huwe, Janice K\n\n2015-12-30\n\nPerfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is used in consumer products as a surfactant and is found in industrial and consumer waste, which ends up in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). PFOS does not breakdown during WWTP processes and accumulates in the biosolids. Common practices include application of biosolids to pastures and croplands used for feed, and as a result, animals such as beef cattle are exposed to PFOS. To determine plasma and tissue depletion kinetics in cattle, 2 steers and 4 heifers were dosed with PFOS at 0.098 mg/kg body weight and 9.1 mg/kg, respectively. Plasma depletion half-lives for steers and heifers were 120 Â± 4.1 and 106 Â± 23.1 days, respectively. Specific tissue depletion half-lives ranged from 36 to 385 days for intraperitoneal fat, back fat, muscle, liver, bone, and kidney. These data indicate that PFOS in beef cattle has a sufficiently long depletion half-life to permit accumulation in edible tissues.\n\nDesigning of peptides with desired half-life in intestine-like environment.\n\nPubMed\n\nSharma, Arun; Singla, Deepak; Rashid, Mamoon; Raghava, Gajendra Pal Singh\n\n2014-08-20\n\nof peptides and to design mutant peptides with better half-life and physicochemical properties.

In girls leu-enkephalin half-life is significantly longer than in boys. The half-life of leu-enkephalin is different in infants on breast and formula feeding. Nine characteristics of temperament in infants of the first year of life were determined using EITQ and ITQ questionnaires. Serum leu-enkephalin half-life directly correlated with temperament characteristics (activity, perception, threshold), but not with the level psychomotor development.\n\nThirty years after Chernobyl: Long-term determination of 137Cs effective half-life in the lichen Stereocaulon vesuvianum.\n\nPubMed\n\nSavino, F; Pugliese, M; Quarto, M; Adamo, P; Loffredo, F; De Cicco, F; Roca, V\n\n2017-06-01\n\nIt has been widely shown that nuclear fallout includes substances, which accumulate in organisms such as crustaceans, fish, mushrooms and lichens, helping to evaluate the activity concentration of contaminants accumulated on a long time. In this context, radiocaesium deposited in soil following the Chernobyl accident on 26 April 1986 is known to have remained persistently available for plant uptake in many areas of Europe. Studies on the lichen Stereocaulon vesuvianum show the plant's high capacity to retain radionuclides from the substrate and the air. After the Chernobyl accident, starting from September 1986, at the Radioactivity Laboratory (LaRa) of the University of Naples Federico II, four monitoring campaigns to evaluate the activity concentration of four isotopes of the two elements caesium and ruthenium ( 134 Cs, 137 Cs, 103 Ru and 106 Ru) were carried out until 1999. This study allowed the effective half-life of 134 Cs and 137 Cs to be estimated. Twenty-eight years after the accident, in December 2014, a further sampling was carried out; only 137 Cs was revealed beyond the detection limits, measuring activity concentrations ranging from 20 to 40 Bq/kg, while the other radionuclides were no longer observed due to their shorter half-life. The last sampling allowed more precise determination of the effective half-life of 137 Cs (6.2Â Â±Â 0.1 year), due to the larger dataset on a large time period. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The 1912 and 1924 218Po half-life measurements, which provided the 3.05-min value listed in nuclear tables for the past 60 y, are critically reviewed. Two more recent experiments, which yielded longer values of 3.11 min (Van Hise et al. 1982) and 3.093 min (Potapov and Soloshenkov 1986), are also discussed.\n\nMeasurement of the half-life of 79Se with accelerator mass spectrometry\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nDou, Liang; Jiang, Shan; Wang, Xiao-Bo; ...\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThe accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is an effective method for the determination of the half-life of long-lived radionuclides. In this paper, we report a method for measurement of the half-life of 79Se. The number of 79Se atoms was determined from measured 79Se/Se absolute ratios with the AMS system at the China Institute of Atomic Energy and the decay rate of 79Se was determined by counting the emitted Î²-rays with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The major improvements of our measurements include using the high abundance of an 79Se sample which was cooled for many years to exclude the interference of short-livedmoreÂ Â» nuclides, the extraction of SeO 2 - molecular ions, that results in a suppression of the 79 Br background by as much as about five orders of magnitude. Also, an AMS measurement of the absolute ratio of 79 Se/Se was developed to avoid systematic errors. The results show that 79 Se/Se is (2.35Â±0.12)Ã10 -7 in the reference sample and the radioactivity of 79Se is (1.24Â±0.05) Bq/g, so the half-life of 79Se is (2.78Â±0.18)Ã10 5 a.Â«Â less\n\nDetermination of the half-life of the ground state of {sup 229}Th by using {sup 232}U and {sup 233}U decay series\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKikunaga, H.; Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0198; Suzuki, T.\n\n2011-07-15\n\nThe half-life of the ground state of {sup 229}Th ({sup 229}Th{sup g}) has become an important factor in nuclear technology, for example, in the geological disposal of nuclear spent fuel. However, the values reported in two previous studies are not in agreement. This study reevaluates the half-life of {sup 229}Th{sup g} by using a simple and reliable method. The {sup 232}U/{sup 233}U activity ratio of a {sup 232,233}U sample was measured by high-resolution {alpha}-particle spectrometry. Next, the {sup 228}Th/{sup 229}Th{sup g} activity ratio of the Th sample, which was grown from the {sup 232,233}U sample, was also measured. The half-lifemoreÂ Â» of {sup 229}Th{sup g} was calculated from these activity ratios, the growth time, and the half-lives of {sup 232}U, {sup 233}U, and {sup 228}Th. From the results of these five measurements, the half-life of {sup 229}Th{sup g} is determined to be 7932 {+-} 55 yr at a confidence level of 2{sigma}.Â«Â less\n\nEstimation of Monocrotophos renal elimination half-life in humans.\n\nPubMed\n\nJose, Arun; Selvakumar, Ratnasamy; Peter, John Victor; Karthik, Gunasekaran; Fleming, Denise Helen; Fleming, Jude Joseph\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMonocrotophos, implicated in about 1/4th of organophosphate poisonings in our centre, is associated with the highest mortality (24%). Yet data on its pharmacokinetics in humans is limited. We estimated the renal elimination half-life of monocrotophos. Consecutive patients presenting with monocrotophos overdose over a 2-month period who had normal renal function were recruited. Monocrotophos in plasma and urine were quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Urine was obtained from catheterised samples at 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-12 and 12-24 h. Plasma specimens were collected at the time of admission, and at the midpoint of the urine sample collections at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 21 h. Renal elimination half-life was calculated from the cumulative amount excreted in the urine. The cohort of 5 male patients, aged 35.8 Â± 2.94 years, presented with typical organophosphate (cholinergic) toxidrome following intentional monocrotophos overdose. All patients required mechanical ventilation; one patient died. Plasma data was available from 5 patients and urine data from 3 patients. The median renal elimination half-life was 3.3 (range: 1.9-5.0 h). Plasma monocrotophos values, as natural log, fell in a linear fashion up to around 10 h after admission. After the 10-hour period, there was a secondary rise in values in all the 3 patients in whom sampling was continued after 10 h. A renal elimination half-life of 3.3 h for monocrotophos is consistent with a water-soluble compound which is rapidly cleared from the plasma. The secondary rise in plasma monocrotophos values suggests possible re-distribution. Determining the elimination profile of this compound will help develop better strategies for treatment.\n\n[beta][sup +] decay and cosmic-ray half-life of [sup 91]Nb\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHindi, M.M.; Sur, B.; Wedding, K.L.\n\n1993-06-01\n\nIn the laboratory, [sup 91]Nb decays by electron capture with a 680-yr half-life.

The accurate knowledge of this parameter has direct impact on, e.g., age determination of archeological artifacts and of the elemental synthesis in the universe. In order to derive the half-life of a long-lived radionuclide, the activity and the absolute number of atoms have to be analyzed. Whereas conventional radiation measurement methods are typically applied for activity determinations, the latter can be determined with high accuracy by mass spectrometric techniques. Over the past years, the half-lives of several radionuclides have been specified by means of multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) complementary to the earlier reported values mainly derived by accelerator mass spectrometry. The present paper discusses all critical aspects (amount of material, radiochemical sample preparation, interference correction, isotope dilution mass spectrometry, calculation of measurement uncertainty) for a precise analysis of the number of atoms by MC-ICP-MS exemplified for the recently published half-life determination of 60Fe (Rugel et al, Phys Rev Lett 103:072502, 2009).\n\nHalf-life of Xe120\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPhillips, A.

These two half-lives were measured and compared for glucoamylase (GA) and Î²-galactosidase (BG). The dynamic half-life was much longer than the static half-life by one to three orders of magnitude for both enzymes. For BG, the half-life of the enzyme physically entrapped in a membrane reactor was also measured. In this case also, the half-life of BG in the membrane reactor was much longer than the free enzyme without substrate. These results suggest the large difference in stabilities between the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. This may be related to the natural enzyme metabolism. According to the difference in half-life, the lifetime molecular turnover (LMT), which is the number of product molecules produced by a single molecule of enzyme until it loses its activity completely, was much higher by one to four orders of magnitude for the active enzyme than the free enzyme. The concept of LMT, proposed here, will be important in bioreactor operations with or without immobilization. Copyright Â© 2016 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

S.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nLuminescence signals from natural and man-made materials are widely used in dosimetric and dating applications. In general, there are two types of half-lives of luminescence signals which are of importance to experimental and modeling work in this research area. The first type of half-life is the time required for the population of the trapped charge in a single trap to decay to half its initial value. The second type of half-life is the time required for the luminescence intensity to drop to half of its initial value. While there a handful of analytical expressions available in the literature for the first type of half-life, there are no corresponding analytical expressions for the second type. In this work new analytical expressions are derived for the half-life of luminescence signals during continuous wave optical stimulation luminescence (CW-OSL) or isothermal luminescence (ITL) experiments. The analytical expressions are derived for several commonly used luminescence models which are based on delocalized transitions involving the conduction band: first and second order kinetics, empirical general order kinetics (GOK), mixed order kinetics (MOK) and the one-trap one-recombination center (OTOR) model. In addition, half-life expressions are derived for a different type of luminescence model, which is based on localized transitions in a random distribution of charges. The new half-life expressions contain two parts. The first part is inversely proportional to the thermal or optical excitation rate, and depends on the experimental conditions and on the cross section of the relevant luminescence process. The second part is characteristic of the optical and/or thermal properties of the material, as expressed by the parameters in the model. A new simple and quick method for analyzing luminescence signals is developed, and examples are given of applying the new method to a variety of dosimetric materials. The new test allows quick determination of whether a set of\n\nSuperior serum half life of albumin tagged TNF ligands\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMueller, Nicole; Schneider, Britta; Pfizenmaier, Klaus\n\n2010-06-11\n\nDue to their immune stimulating and apoptosis inducing properties, ligands of the TNF family attract increasing interest as therapeutic proteins. A general limitation of in vivo applications of recombinant soluble TNF ligands is their notoriously rapid clearance from circulation. To improve the serum half life of the TNF family members TNF, TWEAK and TRAIL, we genetically fused soluble variants of these molecules to human serum albumin (HSA). The serum albumin-TNF ligand fusion proteins were found to be of similar bioactivity as the corresponding HSA-less counterparts. Upon intravenous injection (i.v.), serum half life of HSA-TNF ligand fusion proteins, as determined bymoreÂ Â» ELISA, was around 15 h as compared to approximately 1 h for all of the recombinant control TNF ligands without HSA domain. Moreover, serum samples collected 6 or 24 h after i.v. injection still contained high TNF ligand bioactivity, demonstrating that there is only limited degradation/inactivation of circulating HSA-TNF ligand fusion proteins in vivo. In a xenotransplantation model, significantly less of the HSA-TRAIL fusion protein compared to the respective control TRAIL protein was required to achieve inhibition of tumor growth indicating that the increased half life of HSA-TNF ligand fusion proteins translates into better therapeutic action in vivo. In conclusion, our data suggest that genetic fusion to serum albumin is a powerful and generally applicable mean to improve bioavailability and in vivo activity of TNF ligands.Â«Â less\n\nMeasurement of the {sup 214}Po half-life by the DEVIS track setup\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBelov, V.

In this work, the half-life of 177Lu has been measured using a re-entrant ionisation chamber over a period of 82 days (approximately 12 half-lives). Unlike the majority of previous studies, the material used in this work was produced via the 176Yb(n,Î³)177Yb reaction followed by the Î²-decay to 177Lu, producing insignificant quantities of 177mLu. This has resulted in the most precise half-life measurement of 177Lu to date. A half-life of 6.6430 (11) days has been determined.

In an attempt to determine if the metabolism of somatostatin is also altered as a result of SDAT, we examined the regional metabolic half-life of somatostatin-28 (SS-28) and somatostatin-14 (SS-14). The activity of the following peptidases was also determined: neutral endopeptidase E.C. 3.4.24.11; metalloendopeptidase E.C. 3.4.24.15; carboxypeptidase E (E.C. 3.4.17.10); and trypsin-like serine protease. The metabolic half-life of SS-28 was significantly reduced in post-mortem Brodmann Area 22 of SDAT tissue. This decrease in SS-28 metabolic half-life was correlated with a significant increase in trypsin-like serine protease activity in the same SDAT brain region. The formation rate of SS-14 from SS-28 incubated with Brodmann Area 22 homogenates was also increased in SDAT tissues as compared to controls. A regional variation in neutral endopeptidase E.C. 3.4.24.11 was also noted in both controls and SDAT samples. Although postmortem intervals of samples varied significantly, no effect was seen on any biochemical parameter measured. Results from this study provide evidence that a correlation can be made between changes in metabolic half-life somatostatin and alterations in neuropeptidase activities due to SDAT. As these data show alterations in both proteolytic metabolism and peptidase activities, many other biologically active peptide substrates could also be affected in SDAT.\n\nHigh-precision half-life measurements of the T =1 /2 mirror Î² decays 17F and 33Cl\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrinyer, J.; Grinyer, G. F.; Babo, M.; Bouzomita, H.; Chauveau, P.; Delahaye, P.; Dubois, M.; Frigot, R.; Jardin, P.; Leboucher, C.; Maunoury, L.; Seiffert, C.; Thomas, J. C.; Traykov, E.\n\n2015-10-01\n\nBackground: Measurements of the f t values for T =1 /2 mirror Î²+ decays offer a method to test the conserved vector current hypothesis and to determine Vud, the up-down matrix element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. In most mirror decays used for these tests, uncertainties in the f t values are dominated by the uncertainties in the half-lives. Purpose: Two precision half-life measurements were performed for the T =1 /2 Î²+ emitters, 17F and 33Cl, in order to eliminate the half-life as the leading source of uncertainty in their f t values. Method: Half-lives of 17F and 33Cl were determined using Î² counting of implanted radioactive ion beam samples on a moving tape transport system at the SystÃ¨me de Production d'Ions Radioactifs AccÃ©lÃ©rÃ©s en Ligne low-energy identification station at the Grand AccÃ©lÃ©rateur National d'Ions Lourds. Results: The 17F half-life result, 64.347 (35) s, precise to Â±0.05 % , is a factor of 5 times more precise than the previous world average. The half-life of 33Cl was determined to be 2.5038 (22) s. The current precision of Â±0.09 % is nearly 2 times more precise compared to the previous world average. Conclusions: The precision achieved during the present measurements implies that the half-life no longer dominates the uncertainty of the f t values for both T =1 /2 mirror decays 17F and 33Cl.\n\nStandardisation and half-life of 89Zr.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a-ToraÃ±o, E; PeyrÃ©s, V; Roteta, M; Mejuto, M; SÃ¡nchez-Cabezudo, A; Romero, E\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe nuclide 89 Zr is being tested for the labelling of compounds with long blood circulation times. It decays by beta plus emission (22.8%) and by electron capture (77.2%) to 89 Y. Its half-life has been determined by following the decay rate with two measurement systems; an Ionisation Chamber and an HPGe detector. The combination of six results gives a value of T 1/2 = 78.333 (38) h, slightly lower than the DDEP recommended value of 78.42 (13) h. This radionuclide has also been standardised by liquid scintillation counting, 4ÏÎ³ counting and coincidence techniques. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet uncertainty relating to the time period integrated by isotopic measurement of animal tissues can confound the interpretation of isotopic data. There have been a large number of experimental isotopic diet shift studies aimed at quantifying animal tissue isotopic turnover rate Î» (%Â·day(-1), often expressed as isotopic half-life, ln(2)/Î», days). Yet no studies have evaluated or summarized the many individual half-life estimates in an effort to both seek broad-scale patterns and characterize the degree of variability. Here, we collect previously published half-life estimates, examine how half-life is related to body size, and test for tissue- and taxa-varying allometric relationships. Half-life generally increases with animal body mass, and is longer in muscle and blood compared to plasma and internal organs. Half-life was longest in ecotherms, followed by mammals, and finally birds. For ectotherms, different taxa-tissue combinations had similar allometric slopes that generally matched predictions of metabolic theory. Half-life for ectotherms can be approximated as: ln (half-life) = 0.22*ln (body mass) + group-specific intercept; n = 261, p<0.0001, r2 = 0.63. For endothermic groups, relationships with body mass were weak and model slopes and intercepts were heterogeneous. While isotopic half-life can be approximated using simple allometric relationships for some taxa and tissue types, there is also a high degree of unexplained variation in our models. Our study highlights several strong and general patterns, though accurate prediction of isotopic half-life from readily available variables such as animal body mass remains elusive.\n\nPersistence and Effective Half-Life of Chemical Warfare Agent VX on Grass Foliage\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2017-08-01\n\nobtain results applicable to VX- contaminated battlefields.

This spectrometer consists of a LaBr3 scintillator, a thin plastic scintillator and an HPGe detector. Half-lives are deduced using the Î²-Î³-Î³ delayed coincidence method. The prompt-time distribution curves measured with the spectrometer give a time resolution (FWHM) of 600 ps for 100-keV Î³ rays. This resolution means that half-lives down to the subnanosecond range or shorter can be measured. We reported recent measurements of the half-life of {sup 149}Pr and {sup 149}Nd. Some of the more interesting results include themoreÂ Â» first determination of the half-lives of {sup 149}Pr levels at 86.5 and 125.6 keV, which are 4.2(5) ns and 1.0(2) ns, respectively. In addition, the data indicate that the half-life of the 270.8-keV level in {sup 149}Nd is not 5.1(3) ns as reported previously, but 0.42(3) ns.Â«Â less\n\nIntrinsically disordered segments and the evolution of protein half-life\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBabu, M.\n\n2013-03-01\n\nPrecise turnover of proteins is essential for cellular homeostasis and is primarily mediated by the proteasome. Thus, a fundamental question is: What features make a protein an efficient substrate for degradation? Here I will present results that proteins with a long terminal disordered segment or internal disordered segments have a significantly shorter half-life in yeast. This relationship appears to be evolutionarily conserved in mouse and human. Furthermore, upon gene duplication, divergence in the length of terminal disorder or variation in the number of internal disordered segments results in significant alteration of the half-life of yeast paralogs. Many proteins that exhibit such changes participate in signaling, where altered protein half-life will likely influence their activity. We suggest that variation in the length and number of disordered segments could serve as a remarkably simple means to evolve protein half-life and may serve as an underappreciated source of genetic variation with important phenotypic consequences.

While conjugation to macromolecules has been a mainstay approach for enhancing the half-life of proteins, the steric hindrance of macromolecules often harms the binding of peptides to target receptors, compromising the in vivo efficacy. Here we report a new strategy for enhancing the in vivo half-life of peptides without compromising their potency. Our approach involves endowing peptides with a small-molecule that binds reversibly to the serum protein, transthyretin. Although there are few reversible albumin-binding molecules, we are unaware of designed small molecules that bind reversibly to other serum proteins and are used for half-life extension in vivo. We show here that our strategy was indeed effective in enhancing the half-life of an agonist for GnRH receptor while maintaining its binding affinity, which was translated into superior in vivo efficacy.

Short plasma half life times are commonly due to fast renal clearance as well as to enzymatic degradation occurring during systemic circulation. Modifications of the peptide/protein can lead to prolonged plasma half life times. By shortening the overall amino acid amount of somatostatin and replacing L: -analogue amino acids with D: -amino acids, plasma half life time of the derivate octreotide was 1.5 hours in comparison to only few minutes of somatostatin. A PEG(2,40 K) conjugate of INF-alpha-2b exhibited a 330-fold prolonged plasma half life time compared to the native protein. It was the aim of this review to provide an overview of possible strategies to prolong plasma half life time such as modification of N- and C-terminus or PEGylation as well as methods to evaluate the effectiveness of drug modifications. Furthermore, fundamental data about most important proteolytic enzymes of human blood, liver and kidney as well as their cleavage specificity and inhibitors for them are provided in order to predict enzymatic cleavage of peptide and protein drugs during systemic circulation.\n\nHigh-Precision Half-Life and Branching Ratio Measurements for the Superallowed Î²+ Emitter 26Alm\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFinlay, P.; Svensson, C.

J.; Triambak, S.\n\n2013-03-01\n\nHigh-precision half-life and branching-ratio measurements for the superallowed Î²+ emitter 26Alm were performed at the TRIUMF-ISAC radioactive ion beam facility. An upper limit of â¤ 15 ppm at 90% C.L. was determined for the sum of all possible non-analogue Î²+/EC decay branches of 26Alm, yielding a superallowed branching ratio of 100.0000+0-0.0015%. A value of T1/2 = 6:34654(76) s was determined for the 26Alm half-life which is consistent with, but 2.5 times more precise than, the previous world average. Combining these results with world-average measurements yields an ft value of 3037.58(60) s, the most precisely determined for any superallowed emitting nucleus to date. This high-precision ft value for 26Alm provides a new benchmark to refine theoretical models of isospin-symmetry-breaking effects in superallowed Î² decays.\n\nDetermination of the energy transitions and half-lives of Rubidium nuclei\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBiÃ§er, Ahmet; Manisa, Kaan; Engin ÃalÄ±k, Abdullah; ErdoÄan, Mehmet; Åen, MÃ¼rsel; Bircan, Hasan; Dapo, Haris; Boztosun, Ismail\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe photonuclear reactions, first extensively studied in the 1970's and performed using the gamma rays obtained via bremsstrahlung, are a standard nuclear physics experiment. In this study, a non-enriched Rubidium sample was irradiated with photons produced by a clinical linear electron accelerator (cLINACs) with energies up to 18 MeV with the aim of activating it through photonuclear reactions. The activated sample was measured with a high purity germanium detector (HPGe) with the aim of measuring the transition energies and half-lives. The spectroscopic analysis performed on the obtained data yielded high quality results for the transition energies with precision matching or surpassing the literature data. For the half-lives the results were consistent with the literature, most notably the half-life of 84mRb decay was determined as 20.28(2) m. The results for both energies and half-lives further show that the clinical linear accelerators can be successfully used as an efficient tool in experimental nuclear research endeavors.\n\nHigh-Precision Half-life Measurements for the Superallowed Î²+ Emitter 14O\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLaffoley, A.

The results, TÂ½(Î³) = 70:632 Â± 0:094 s and TÂ½(Î²) = 70:610 Â± 0:030 s, are consistent with one another and, together with eight previous measurements, establish a new average for the 14O half-life of TÂ½ = 70:619 Â± 0:011 s with a reduced Ï2 of 0.99.\n\nThe Use of Gene Ontology Term and KEGG Pathway Enrichment for Analysis of Drug Half-Life\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Lei; Lu, Jing; Kong, XiangYin; Huang, Tao; Li, HaiPeng\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA drugâs biological half-life is defined as the time required for the human body to metabolize or eliminate 50% of the initial drug dosage. Correctly measuring the half-life of a given drug is helpful for the safe and accurate usage of the drug. In this study, we investigated which gene ontology (GO) terms and biological pathways were highly related to the determination of drug half-life. The investigated drugs, with known half-lives, were analyzed based on their enrichment scores for associated GO terms and KEGG pathways. These scores indicate which GO terms or KEGG pathways the drug targets. The feature selection method, minimum redundancy maximum relevance, was used to analyze these GO terms and KEGG pathways and to identify important GO terms and pathways, such as sodium-independent organic anion transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0015347), monoamine transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0008504), negative regulation of synaptic transmission (GO:0050805), neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (hsa04080), serotonergic synapse (hsa04726), and linoleic acid metabolism (hsa00591), among others. This analysis confirmed our results and may show evidence for a new method in studying drug half-lives and building effective computational methods for the prediction of drug half-lives.

Comparison of the high precision I-Xe and Pb-Pb ages of chondrules and pure mineral phases separated from eight meteorites suggests the 17.5 Ã· 14.6 Ma range for the 129I half-life, assuming that the 235U and 238U half-lives are correct. The mean value of 16 Ma indicates that the 15.7 Ma half-life of 129I used here for the I-Xe age calculations is most probably correct. Since the 129I half-life value only affects the relative I-Xe ages, the few Ma relative to the Shallowater standard, the absolute I-Xe ages are almost immune to this uncertainty in the 129I half-life.\n\nUbiquitin-fusion as a strategy to modulate protein half-life: A3G antiviral activity revisited\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCadima-Couto, Iris; Freitas-Vieira, Acilino; Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Lisboa\n\n2009-10-25\n\nThe human APOBEC3G (A3G) is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication and its activity is suppressed by HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif). Vif neutralizes A3G mainly by inducing its degradation in the proteasome and blocking its incorporation into HIV-1 virions. Assessing the time needed for A3G incorporation into virions is, therefore, important to determine how quickly Vif must act to induce its degradation. We show that modelling the intracellular half-life of A3G can induce its Vif-independent targeting to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. By using various amino acids (X) in a cleavable ubiquitin-X-A3G fusion, we demonstrate that the half-life (t1/2) of X-A3GmoreÂ Â» can be manipulated. We show that A3G molecules with a half-life of 13 min are incorporated into virions, whereas those with a half-life shorter than 5 min were not. The amount of X-A3G incorporated into virions increases from 13 min (Phe-A3G) to 85 min (Asn-A3G) and remains constant after this time period. Interestingly, despite the presence of similar levels of Arg-A3G (t1/2 = 28 min) and Asp-A3G (t1/2 = 65 min) into HIV-1 DELTAvif virions, inhibition of viral infectivity was only evident in the presence of A3G proteins with a longer half-life (t1/2 >= 65 min).Â«Â less\n\nPrecise measurement of the half-life of the Fermi {beta} decay of {sup 26}Al{sup m}\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nScott, Rebecca J.; Thompson, Maxwell N.; Rassool, Roger P.\n\n2011-08-15\n\nState-of-the-art signal digitization and analysis techniques have been used to measure the half-life of the Fermi {beta} decay of {sup 26}Al{sup m}.

This new datum contributes to the experimental testing of the conserved-vector-current hypothesis and the required unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix: two essential components of the standard model.

We evaluated factors related to expression of the half-pounder life history in wild steelhead from the lower Klamath River basin, California. We also evaluated fitness consequences of the half-pounder phenotype using a simple life history model that was parameterized with our empirical data and outputs from a regional survival equation. The incidence of the half-pounder life history differed among subbasins of origin and smolt ages. Precocious maturation occurred in approximately 8% of half-pounders and was best predicted by individual length in freshwater preceding ocean entry. Adult steelhead of the half-pounder phenotype were smaller and less fecund at age than adult steelhead of the alternative (ocean contingent) phenotype. However, our data suggest that fish of the half-pounder phenotype are more likely to spawn repeatedly than are fish of the ocean contingent phenotype. Models predicted that if lifetime survivorship were equal between phenotypes, the fitness of the half-pounder phenotype would be 17â28% lower than that of the ocean contingent phenotype. To meet the condition of equal fitness between phenotypes would require that first-year ocean survival be 21â40% higher among half-pounders in freshwater than among their cohorts at sea. We concluded that continued expression of the half-pounder phenotype is favored by precocious maturation and increased survival relative to that of the ocean contingent phenotype.\n\nA new measurement of the half-life of (166m)Ho.\n\nPubMed\n\nNedjadi, Y; Bailat, C; Caffari, Y; Froidevaux, P; Wastiel, C; Kivel, N; Guenther-Leopold, I; Triscone, G; Jaquenod, F; Bochud, F\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe work presented here is a new and precise measurement of the half-life of (166m)Ho by determining the activity concentration, using an ionisation chamber calibrated for this nuclide, and measuring the number of (166m)Ho atoms using multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Since the isotope (166)Er interferes with the mass spectrometric measurement, Er has to be eliminated from the (166m)Ho radioactive solution. The elimination was achieved using ion-exchange chromatography with the cation exchange resin Dowex AG 50W-X8 and 2-Hydroxybutanoic acid as the mobile phase. After a first transit through the chromatographic column, the purified (166m)Ho eluate was spiked with natural Er to get a resulting Er isotopic composition close to that of natural Er at better than 99.5%, and then it underwent two further separations to eliminate the Er. The activity concentration of this Er-free radioactive (166m)Ho solution was measured in our reference ionisation chamber calibrated for this nuclide by means of the 4ÏÎ²(PC)-Î³ and 4ÏÎ²(PS)-4ÏÎ³ coincidence techniques and integral counting with a well-type NaI(Tl) detector and Monte Carlo efficiencies. An aliquot of this standardized solution was sent to the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) for mass concentration determination using an isotope dilution MC-ICP-MS approach. The mass concentration of (166m)Ho in this solution was determined with 0.25% relative standard uncertainty. This value was corroborated by two other independent measurements. The new half-life of (166m)Ho, 1132.6(39) years (k=1), is compatible with the value determined in 1965, but is 5.6% shorter and about 43 times more precise. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Albumin has an extended serum half-life of 3 weeks because of its size and FcRn-mediated recycling that prevents intracellular degradation, properties shared with IgG antibodies. Engineering the strictly pH-dependent IgG-FcRn interaction is known to extend IgG half-life. However, this principle has not been extensively explored for albumin. We have engineered human albumin by introducing single point mutations in the C-terminal end that generated a panel of variants with greatly improved affinities for FcRn. One variant (K573P) with 12-fold improved affinity showed extended serum half-life in normal mice, mice transgenic for human FcRn, and cynomolgus monkeys. Importantly, favorable binding to FcRn was maintained when a single-chain fragment variable antibody was genetically fused to either the N- or the C-terminal end. The engineered albumin variants may be attractive for improving the serum half-life of biopharmaceuticals.

CA645 was demonstrated to bind human, cynomolgus, and mouse serum albumin with similar affinity (1-7Â nM), and to bind human serum albumin (HSA) when it is in complex with common known ligands. Importantly for half-life extension, CA645 binds HSA with similar affinity within the physiologically relevant range of pH 5.0 - pH 7.4, and does not have a deleterious effect on the binding of HSA to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). A crystal structure of humanized CA645 Fab in complex with HSA was solved and showed that CA645 Fab binds to domain II of HSA. Superimposition with the crystal structure of FcRn bound to HSA confirmed that CA645 does not block HSA binding to FcRn. In mice, the serum half-life of humanized CA645 Fab is 84.2Â h. This is a significant extension in comparison with < 1Â h for a non-HSA binding CA645 Fab variant. The Fab-HSA structure was used to design a series of mutants with reduced affinity to investigate the correlation between the affinity for albumin and serum half-life. Reduction in the affinity for MSA by 144-fold from 2.2Â nM to 316Â nM had no effect on serum half-life. Strikingly, despite a reduction in affinity to 62Â ÂµM, an extension in serum half-life of 26.4Â h was still obtained. CA645 Fab and the CA645 Fab-HSA complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession codes, 5FUZ and 5FUO, respectively.\n\nPile-up corrections for high-precision superallowed Î² decay half-life measurements via Î³-ray photopeak counting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrinyer, G.

L.; Zganjar, E. F.\n\n2007-09-01\n\nA general technique that corrects Î³-ray gated Î² decay-curve data for detector pulse pile-up is presented. The method includes corrections for non-zero time-resolution and energy-threshold effects in addition to a special treatment of saturating events due to cosmic rays. This technique is verified through a Monte Carlo simulation and experimental data using radioactive beams of Na26 implanted at the center of the 8Ï Î³-ray spectrometer at the ISAC facility at TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada. The Î²-decay half-life of Na26 obtained from counting 1809-keV Î³-ray photopeaks emitted by the daughter Mg26 was determined to be T=1.07167Â±0.00055 s following a 27Ï correction for detector pulse pile-up. This result is in excellent agreement with the result of a previous measurement that employed direct Î² counting and demonstrates the feasibility of high-precision Î²-decay half-life measurements through the use of high-purity germanium Î³-ray detectors. The technique presented here, while motivated by superallowed-Fermi Î² decay studies, is general and can be used for all half-life determinations (e.g. Î±-, Î²-, X-ray, fission) in which a Î³-ray photopeak is used to select the decays of a particular isotope.\n\nUpdate of NIST half-life results corrected for ionization chamber source-holder instability.\n\nPubMed\n\nUnterweger, M P; Fitzgerald, R\n\n2014-05-01\n\nAs reported at the ICRM 2011, it was discovered that the source holder used for calibrations in the NIST 4ÏÎ³ ionization chamber (IC) was not stable. This has affected a large number of half-life measurement results previously reported and used in compilations of nuclear data. Corrections have been made on all of the half-life data based on the assumption that the changes to the ionization chamber response were gradual. The corrections are energy dependent and therefore radionuclide specific. This presentation will review our results and present the recommended changes in half-life values and/or uncertainties.

This research explores applications of neutron activation analysis (NAA) in two parts. Part 1. High Precision Methods for Measuring Decay Half-Lives, Chapters 1 through 8 Part one develops research methods and data analysis techniques for making high precision measurements of nuclear beta decay half-lives. The change in the electron capture half-life of 51Cr in pure chromium versus chromium mixed in a gold lattice structure is explored, and the 97Ru electron capture decay half-life are compared for ruthenium in a pure crystal versus ruthenium in a rutile oxide state, RuO2. In addition, the beta-minus decay half-life of 71mZn is measured and compared with new high precision findings. Density Functional Theory is used to explain the measured magnitude of changes in electron capture half-life from changes in the surrounding lattice electron configuration. Part 2. Debris Collection Nuclear Diagnostic at the National Ignition Facility, Chapters 9 through 11 Part two explores the design and development of a solid debris collector for use as a diagnostic tool at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). NAA measurements are performed on NIF post-shot debris collected on witness plates in the NIF chamber. In this application NAA is used to detect and quantify the amount of trace amounts of gold from the hohlraum and germanium from the pellet present in the debris collected after a NIF shot. The design of a solid debris collector based on material x-ray ablation properties is given, and calculations are done to predict performance and results for the collection and measurements of trace amounts of gold and germanium from dissociated hohlraum debris.\n\nMeasurement of the two-neutrino double-beta decay half-life of $$^{130}$$Te with the CUORE-0 experiment\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nAlduino, C.; Alfonso, K.; Artusa, D. R.; ...\n\n2017-01-06\n\nHere, we report on the measurement of the two-neutrino double-beta decay half-life of 130Te with the CUORE-0 detector. From an exposure of 33.4 kg year of TeO 2, the half-life is determined to be T 2Î½ 1/2 = [8.2 Â± 0.2 (stat.) Â± 0.6 (syst.)] Ã 10 20 year. This result is obtained after a detailed reconstruction of the sources responsible for the CUORE-0 counting rate, with a specific study of those contributing to the 130Te neutrinoless double-beta decay region of interest.\n\nInnovative methodology for intercomparison of radionuclide calibrators using short half-life in situ prepared radioactive sources\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOliveira, P. A.; Santos, J. A. M., E-mail: joao.santos@ipoporto.min-saude.pt; ServiÃ§o de FÃ­sica MÃ©dica do Instituto PortuguÃªs de Oncologia do Porto Francisco Gentil, EPE, Porto\n\n2014-07-15\n\nPurpose: An original radionuclide calibrator method for activity determination is presented. The method could be used for intercomparison surveys for short half-life radioactive sources used in Nuclear Medicine, such as{sup 99m}Tc or most positron emission tomography radiopharmaceuticals. Methods: By evaluation of the resulting net optical density (netOD) using a standardized scanning method of irradiated Gafchromic XRQA2 film, a comparison of the netOD measurement with a previously determined calibration curve can be made and the difference between the tested radionuclide calibrator and a radionuclide calibrator used as reference device can be calculated. To estimate the total expected measurement uncertainties, a carefulmoreÂ Â» analysis of the methodology, for the case of{sup 99m}Tc, was performed: reproducibility determination, scanning conditions, and possible fadeout effects. Since every factor of the activity measurement procedure can influence the final result, the method also evaluates correct syringe positioning inside the radionuclide calibrator. Results: As an alternative to using a calibrated source sent to the surveyed site, which requires a relatively long half-life of the nuclide, or sending a portable calibrated radionuclide calibrator, the proposed method uses a source preparedin situ. An indirect activity determination is achieved by the irradiation of a radiochromic film using {sup 99m}Tc under strictly controlled conditions, and cumulated activity calculation from the initial activity and total irradiation time. The irradiated Gafchromic film and the irradiator, without the source, can then be sent to a National Metrology Institute for evaluation of the results. Conclusions: The methodology described in this paper showed to have a good potential for accurate (3%) radionuclide calibrators intercomparison studies for{sup 99m}Tc between Nuclear Medicine centers without source transfer and can easily be adapted to other short half-life\n\nSite-Specific Albumination as an Alternative to PEGylation for the Enhanced Serum Half-Life in Vivo.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Byungseop; Lim, Sung In; Kim, Jong Chul; Tae, Giyoong; Kwon, Inchan\n\n2016-05-09\n\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) has been widely used as a serum half-life extender of therapeutic proteins. However, due to immune responses and low degradability of PEG, developing serum half-life extender alternatives to PEG is required. Human serum albumin (HSA) has several beneficial features as a serum half-life extender, including a very long serum half-life, good degradability, and low immune responses. In order to further evaluate the efficacy of HSA, we compared the extent of serum half-life extension of a target protein, superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), upon HSA conjugation with PEG conjugation side-by-side. Combination of site-specific incorporation of p-azido-l-phenylalanine into sfGFP and copper-free click chemistry achieved the site-specific conjugation of a single HSA, 20 kDa PEG, or 30 kDa PEG to sfGFP. These sfGFP conjugates exhibited the fluorescence comparable to or even greater than that of wild-type sfGFP (sfGFP-WT). In mice, HSA-conjugation to sfGFP extended the serum half-life 9.0 times compared to that of unmodified sfGFP, which is comparable to those of PEG-conjugated sfGFPs (7.3 times for 20 kDa PEG and 9.5 times for 30 kDa PEG). These results clearly demonstrated that HSA was as effective as PEG in extending the serum half-life of a target protein. Therefore, with the additional favorable features, HSA is a good serum half-life extender of a (therapeutic) protein as an alternative to PEG.\n\nSettling the half-life of 60Fe: fundamental for a versatile astrophysical chronometer.\n\nPubMed\n\nWallner, A; Bichler, M; Buczak, K; Dressler, R; Fifield, L K; Schumann, D; Sterba, J H; Tims, S G; Wallner, G; Kutschera, W\n\n2015-01-30\n\nIn order to resolve a recent discrepancy in the half-life of 60Fe, we performed an independent measurement with a new method that determines the 60Fe content of a material relative to 55Fe (t1/2=2.744ââyr) with accelerator mass spectrometry. Our result of (2.50Â±0.12)Ã10(6)ââyr clearly favors the recently reported value (2.62Â±0.04)Ã10(6)ââyr, and rules out the older result of (1.49Â±0.27)Ã10(6)ââyr. The present weighted mean half-life value of (2.60Â±0.05)Ã10(6)ââyr substantially improves the reliability as an important chronometer for astrophysical applications in the million-year time range. This includes its use as a sensitive probe for studying recent chemical evolution of our Galaxy, the formation of the early Solar System, nucleosynthesis processes in massive stars, and as an indicator of a recent nearby supernova.\n\nÎ²-decay half-life of V50 calculated by the shell model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHaaranen, M.; Srivastava, P. C.; Suhonen, J.; Zuber, K.\n\n2014-10-01\n\nIn this work we survey the detectability of the Î²- channel of 2350V leading to the first excited 2+ state in 2450Cr. The electron-capture (EC) half-life corresponding to the transition of 2350V to the first excited 2+ state in 2250Ti had been measured earlier. Both of the mentioned transitions are 4th-forbidden non-unique. We have performed calculations of all the involved wave functions by using the nuclear shell model with the GXPF1A interaction in the full f-p shell. The computed half-life of the EC branch is in good agreement with the measured one. The predicted half-life for the Î²- branch is in the range â2Ã1019 yr whereas the present experimental lower limit is 1.5Ã1018 yr. We discuss also the experimental lay-out needed to detect the Î²--branch decay.\n\nLabel-free Fab and Fc affinity/avidity profiling of the antibody complex half-life for polyclonal and monoclonal efficacy screening.\n\nPubMed\n\nRead, Thomas; Olkhov, Rouslan V; Williamson, E Diane; Shaw, Andrew M\n\n2015-09-01\n\nA unified approach to affinity screening for Fab and Fc interactions of an antibody for its antigen and FcÎ³R receptor has been developed. An antigen array is used for the Fab affinity and cross-reactivity screening and protein A/G proxy is the FcÎ³R receptor. The affinities are derived using a simple 1:1 binding model with a consistent error analysis. The association and dissociation kinetics are measured over optimised times for accurate determination. The Fab/Fc affinities are derived for ten antibodies: mAb-actin (mouse), pAb-BSA (sheep), pAb-collagen V (rabbit), pAb-CRP (goat), mAb-F1 (mouse), mAbs (mouse) 7.3, 12.3, 29.3, 36.3 and 46.3 raised against LcrV in Yersinia pestis. The rate of the dissociation of antigen-antibody complexes relates directly to their immunological function as does the Fc-FcÎ³R complex and a new half-life plot has been defined with a Fab/Fc half-life range of 17-470Â min. The upper half-life value points to surface avidity. Two antibodies that are protective as an immunotherapy define a Fab half-life >250Â min and an Fc half-life >50Â min as characteristics of ideal interactions which can form the basis of an antibody screen for immunotherapy.\n\nThe impact of extended half-life versus conventional factor product on hemophilia caregiver burden.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwartz, Carolyn E; Powell, Victoria E; Su, Jun; Zhang, Jie; Eldar-Lissai, Adi\n\n2018-05-01\n\nExtended half-life factor products have reduced annualized bleeding rates in hemophilia patients. The impact of extended half-life versus conventional factor products on hemophilia caregiver burden has not been investigated. This study aimed to evaluate caregiver burden in extended half-life versus conventional factor products for hemophilia A and B. This cross-sectional web-based study of caregivers of people with hemophilia A or B was recruited from a panel research company and by word of mouth. Participants completed the Hemophilia Caregiver Impact measure, the PedsQL Family Impact Module (PedsQL), and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI). We also collected demographic, insurance coverage, and medical information related to the hemophilia patient(s). Burden differences were assessed using linear regression and matched cohort analyses. The sample (nâ=â448) included 49 people who were caring for people on extended half-life factor products. Worse caregiver burden was associated with more infusions per week and more bleeds in the past 6Â months. Regression analyses suggested that caring for someone who is on a extended half-life factor product is associated with lower emotional impact (Î²Â =â-â0.11, pâ<â0.05, Adjusted R 2 â=â0.06), and shows a trend association with lower practical impact (Î²Â =â-â0.09, pâ<â0.10, Adjusted R 2 â=â0.05). The matched cohort analysis also revealed that people on extended half-life factor product had lower Emotional Impact and Practical Impact scores (tâ=â-"
