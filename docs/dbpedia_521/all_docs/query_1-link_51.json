        "text": "Regional investment aid can be granted for major investments in machinery and buildings in assisted areas 1, 2 or 3, for example. For this, the enterpriseâ€™s market must extend beyond its own region.\n\nRegional investment aid is granted in accordance with SFS 2022:1467 Regulation on State aid for regional investments.\n\nEach application is examined individually\n\nPlease note that regional investment aid is an opportunity but not a right, and that the aid must not exceed what is necessary, taking into account other financing options and other circumstances, for the implementation of the measure for which the aid is intended. The application is assessed in respect of sustainability and:\n\nwhether the investment has growth potential\n\nhow many jobs will be created\n\nthe importance of the enterprise and the investment for the location\n\nthe regenerative power of the investment\n\nthe risk with the investment\n\nthe need for aid so that the investment takes place.\n\nMore stringent demands are made of large enterprises\n\nAid may be granted to large enterprises for initial investment in new economic activities. This means that aid to large enterprises may only be granted if the investment is aimed either at setting up a new activity or at investing in a new activity at an existing place of work which is not the same as or similar to the activity conducted previously at that place of work.\n\nYour application must be submitted before the investment can begin. An investment must normally be implemented within two years of the decision.\n\nContact your region and the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth before applying for aid. It is always useful to have a discussion before starting an application. Many local trade and industry offices also have extensive knowledge and can assist."
