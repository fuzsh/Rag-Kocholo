PROs are direct reports from a child on their health status, without interpretation by anyone else. PROs allow for a better understanding of the patient experience, allow clinicians to provide patient-centered care, and add value to clinical trials. When PROs cannot be collected, caregiver-proxy reports can provide important information on the child’s more observable symptoms and functioning. In this paper, we describe the current use of PROs in specific PRDs, align current research with best practice recommendations for both clinical care and research settings, highlight exciting new developments, and identify areas for future research.\n\nKeywords: Pediatric rheumatic diseases, patient-reported outcomes, patient-reported outcome measures, clinical trials, clinical care, future directions\n\nPatient-reported outcomes (PROs) are an integral part of research and clinical care across medical specialties. Certain aspects of a patient’s life, like pain, sleep quality, or daily functioning, remain unknown unless directly queried. By allowing patients to directly report on their health status, researchers and clinicians better understand the full experiences of living with a condition or disease. Assessing PROs for children and adolescents (typically 8 years or older) is an accepted practice if the measures themselves are developmentally appropriate.1 In fact, having pediatric patients report directly on their health status is important for their autonomy, and may highlight divergent perspectives compared with their parents.2 PROs are particularly important for pediatric rheumatic diseases (PRDs), in which children may experience chronic symptoms, such as pain, and functional limitations. When children are too young or ill to self-report, caregiver-proxy measures can be used.\n\nWhat are patient-reported outcome measures?\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines PROs as “important aspects of how individuals are feeling and functioning,”3 and PRO measures refers to the questionnaire the patient completes without the help of another individual. The PRO measure produces a score reflecting lower or higher levels of the PRO that may be used to inform research findings or treatment options. Many stakeholders in the healthcare setting recognize the importance of PROs. Both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency advocate for use of PRO measures, such as those measuring health-related quality of life (HRQOL), in clinical trials (fda.gov and ema.europa.eu). In addition to evaluating treatment efficacy and monitoring clinical symptoms, PRO measures have been used to screen patients with PRD for mental health concerns4 and help redefine outcomes to make them more meaningful to patients (eg, redefining “clinical remission”5).\n\nThe potential benefits of measuring PROs in clinical care and research settings are many, but the application of rigorous standards to identify, develop, and evaluate PRO measures is relatively new (most guidance/standards published over the past 20 years). In addition, research into pediatric PROs has progressed more slowly than in adults. Although pediatric rheumatologists have proactively assessed PROs for patients with PRDs,6 more work is needed. Thus, the goal of this article is to describe the current use of PROs in PRDs, aligning current research with best practice recommendations, and identify areas for future work.\n\nPatient-reported outcomes in pediatric rheumatic diseases\n\nPediatric rheumatologists often focus on ‘disease activity’ using objective measures such as laboratory and clinical biomarkers. These outcomes are important for making decisions on starting, stopping, maintaining, or escalating treatment. However, patients with rheumatic conditions often identify other priorities, including pain, fatigue, sleep quality, functioning, mental health, and medication side effects.7 Historically, visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to capture this information from the family, focusing on global construct like ‘overall wellbeing’ rather than specific disease or drug-related symptoms. Pediatric rheumatologists also adopted PRO measures for children and adolescents based on adult measures. For example, the Children’s Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ)8 was adapted from the adult Health Assessment Questionnaire9, designed to capture functional status (i.e., disability) for a number of rheumatic conditions.\n\nAs the field of health assessment has grown, rigorous methods have been applied to the design of PRO measures. Launched in 2004, the NIH’s Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System® (PROMIS®) provides researchers and clinicians access to a broad range of high quality, universal, and freely available PRO measures.10 PROMIS measures were rigorously developed, designed, and evaluated with state-of-the-science qualitative and quantitative methods11,12 across a broad range of adult and pediatric populations including PRDs.13–15 more than 100 adult and 25 pediatric domains of symptoms, function, and well-being provide researchers and clinicians flexibility to select measures based on their needs and length of questionnaire (longer measures provide more reliable assessment). For example, a pediatric rheumatologist may select to assess pain, fatigue, physical functioning, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety in clinical practice. The rheumatologist may select the PROMIS Pediatric 8-item short forms for important domains such as pain and physical functioning and select PROMIS Pediatric 4-item short forms for fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety. The rheumatologist may also use the PROMIS computerized-adaptive testing (CAT) versions of the measures to individually tailor the assessment for each pediatric patient. Thus, PROMIS can be tailored to the needs of a care provider or researcher to yield high quality patient-centered data for use in clinical care, research, and quality improvement.\n\nPRO measurement greatly enhances understanding of patient’s lived experience with PRD. In particular, children may experience disease impacts on life in ways that are not captured by biomarkers. For example, children with pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) reported ongoing pain and fatigue, even in the face of “normal” conventional disease activity measures.16 In addition, some therapeutic trials that failed to meet primary disease activity end points have shown important improvement in patient symptoms (eg, hydroxycholorquine reducing pain in Sjögren syndrome17), but inclusion of PROs in clinical trials relies on strong measurement properties.18 Furthermore, at an individual patient level, PROs may identify opportunities for improving patient care. Pediatric rheumatologists who screen patients for functional impairments and psychological comorbidities, which often linger after disease activity “resolves”, can identify patients who might benefit from occupational therapy or counseling referrals.4,19 There are four questions that rheumatologists should consider when identifying and implementing PROs in pediatric rheumatic disease settings (Box 1).\n\nBox 1\n\nFor PROs to inform decision making for pediatric rheumatic diseases, researchers and clinicians should address four questions:\n\nWhat outcomes matters most to patients and is actionable for clinicians, investigators, patients, and caregivers?\n\nWho is the best source for providing information on symptoms, functioning, and quality of life given the age and health condition of the child?\n\nWhat PRO has the strongest evidence for validity and reliability to measure the targeted outcomes?\n\nHow do we effectively integrate PRO measures into research and healthcare delivery settings?\n\nConsideration 1: Starting at the Beginning. What matters to patients?\n\nIdentifying what is meaningful to patients is a crucial first step to developing PROs. To accurately represent the voice of individuals living with disease, those individuals and their caregivers should be directly involved in deciding which HRQOL domains to assess within a specific context (e.g. clinical care, research, or clinical trials; Box 2). The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) workgroup found a strong need for patients to be involved in revising the established core domain sets (a common set of assessment variables across studies) for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).20 It was updated in 2018 based on input from 53 patients aged 15–24 years and several parents,21 showing that (1) older children/adolescents were able to successfully participate in the process, and (2) domains prioritized by patients and families were different than other stakeholders.21 It cannot be overstated that asking children, adolescents, and families what is most meaningful to their lives is critical to driving patient-centered research and care. Patient and family input may be more vital in rare and less well-researched conditions like juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), localized scleroderma/morphea (LS), and chronic recurrent nonbacterial osteomyelitis/chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CRMO/CNO) because of the unique disease features. Furthermore, because our knowledge and understanding of these conditions is in development, incorporating patient voices has a great potential for positive impact on research and care.\n\nBox 2\n\nQuestion 1: Starting at the Beginning. What matters most to patients?\n\nPatients and families decide what health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains to assess with PRO measures, as they are able to identify domains that are important to them and meaningfully impact their lives.\n\nHRQOL domains collected via PRO measures need to be relevant to the setting (e.g., actionable by clinicians, related to the mechanism of action or side effects in clinical trials).\n\nHRQOL domains relevant to patients may differ depending on the disease or condition (e.g., joint pain for patients with juvenile arthritis) or may vary by patient age (e.g., body image for teenagers), while some domains may be more general (e.g., fatigue for all pediatric rheumatic diseases).\n\nQuestion 2: Who is the best source for providing information on these health-related quality of life domains?\n\nChildren and adolescents report directly on their health status whenever possible.\n\nThe selection of the appropriate measure should be based on a good understanding of the target population in terms of their developmental level age and abilities.\n\nParental proxy report provides helpful information, but is not equivalent to child self-report.\n\nQuestion 3: What is best measure of key health-related quality of life domains?\n\nEvidence supporting use of PRO measures should be specific to the target population and the purpose of the assessment.\n\nRecommended attributes of a PRO measure from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Medical Outcome Trust33 include:\n\nBasis on a conceptual and measurement model\n\nReliability (including internal consistency and test-retest reliability)\n\nValidity (including content validity and construct validity)\n\nResponsiveness to change\n\nInterpretability of scores\n\nLow respondent and administrative burden\n\nAvailability in alternative forms\n\nCultural and language adaptations and translations\n\n‘Legacy measures’ should be evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure their continued validity.\n\nQuestion 4: How effectively to integrate PRO measures into research and healthcare delivery settings?\n\nPRO measures have been successfully integrated into pediatric clinical care and research settings.39,40\n\nGuidance documents provide specific information about integrating PRO measures into clinical research and care settings41,42,44.\n\nCommon contexts for PRO assessment are clinical care (e.g. to improve patient-clinician communication, drive shared treatment decisions, provide referrals to specialists such as psychiatrists for mental health issues), and clinical trials (e.g. evaluate treatment efficacy, capture medication side effects). In any context, it is important to identify outcomes important to the patients, relevant to the setting, and actionable by clinicians, caregivers, and other invested parties invested in the child’s well-being, including themselves. Clinicians are likely to ignore outcomes less directly related to therapeutics (e.g., spirituality) or that lack clear meaningfulness, which may subsequently leave patients feeling that their time completing the questionnaire was wasted.22 It is also recommended to share the PRO data with the child and their family in ways that ensure the scores are meaningful in understanding the child’s health.\n\nConsideration 2: Who is the best source for providing outcome information?\n\nA child’s self-report is the best source for learning their feelings and function (Box 2). In general, children as young as five years are generally capable of self-reporting aspects of HRQOL (e.g., pain) with some assistance1, and responses become even more reliable as they get older.23 Children at least 8 years old are often able to read and self-report independently on a broader type of outcomes such as anxiety. In particular, the PROMIS Pediatric measures were developed to be appropriate for children 8–17 years old, with parent proxy measures (when caregivers report their child’s health status) available for children 5 to 17 years old.24,25\n\nWhen children are too young, too ill, or developmentally unable to report their own HRQOL, parent-proxy report can be a helpful method to gain information about the patient’s HRQOL. However, disagreement between the child’s self-report with either caregivers or clinicians’ report often exists.26 Clinicians typically have poor to fair associations with child self-report.27 Caregiver report is more closely associated with the child’s self-report, but caregivers’ ratings are impacted by their own health and life experiences.28,29 For example, as parent’s own health worsens they tend to report worse health for their child.30,31 Thus, experts recommend prioritizing child self-report unless a child is unable to complete a PRO measure, then collecting data from caregivers is appropriate. However, caregiver-reported data should not be treated as equal to child self-report, but rather an alternative helpful information source.32\n\nConsideration 3: What are attributes of a high quality measure?\n\nThe Medical Outcomes Trust recommends eight attributes for a quality HRQOL measure (Box 2).33 Understanding the recommended attributes can help a pediatric rheumatologist identify PRO measures that have adequate validity and reliability for the intended population in the intended context. There also are published guidances and frameworks to help clinicians and researchers evaluate existing measures for a specific purpose (e.g., COSMIN methodology34, FDA guidance35).\n\nEven PRO measures widely used in PRDs warrant critical review. There are “legacy measures” adopted early by researchers and clinicians that were never rigorously evaluated or are outdated due to changes in understanding and/or treatment of disease. Thus, it is worth revisiting legacy measures to see if they are still valid for current contexts. A recent qualitative study enrolled children and youth 10–24 years with PRDs into focus groups. When discussing psychosocial research priorities, they described the CHAQ, a widely used functional status measure in research and clinical practice, as “too long” and “did not capture their experience of their condition.”36 In a subsequent study, 52 patients 5–17 years with JIA or JDM preferred PROMIS Pediatric measures to the CHAQ. In analysis, the PROMIS pediatric measures did not show ceiling effects, although the CHAQ did37.\n\nFor rare conditions that lack validated PROs, generic (universal) measures like the PROMIS Pediatric measures can be a useful way to gather evidence on specific outcomes of interest (e.g, pain, fatigue, physical functioning). Another strength of using universal measures in rare conditions is that they allow comparison of scores with other more prevalent PRDs, other chronic conditions, and ‘healthy’ populations for which there is documented normative data. In some cases, it may be useful to consider ‘disease-specific’ measures, which are PRO measures developed and validated purposely for one population. In some cases, this can increase the likelihood that the measure is capturing information that is relevant and specific to the rare disease. The importance of re-considering legacy measures is also critical for rarer PRDs. For example, when the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index, a legacy measure for localized scleroderma (LS), was formally evaluated, it was found to have limited construct validity and the researchers concluded that scores were likely to underestimate the true impact of LS on patients’ HRQOL.38\n\nConsideration 4: How can PRO measures integrate effectively into research and healthcare delivery settings?\n\nAlthough the use of PROs in pediatric settings lags behind adults39,40, there are a number of evidence-based guidances to help PRO implementation (Box 2). The SPIRIT-PRO guidelines focus on clinical trial protocols where PRO measures are a central outcome (primary or secondary), including recommendations around intervention time points and strategies to minimize missing data.41 Other helpful frameworks include the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) PRO extension,42 the Setting International Standards in Analyzing Patient-Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life Endpoints Data Consortium recommendations43, and the International Society for Quality of Life Research’s minimum standards.44 Despite minor differences in perspectives across the documents, recommendations are largely consistent45; meaning that pediatric rheumatologists can feel comfortable following any of the selected guidelines. Similar guidances are available for providers interested in implementing PRO measures in clinical practice.46,47\n\nState of the Field\n\nPRDs make up a group of heterogeneous, often painful, chronic conditions often affecting multiple organ systems. Specific considerations for PROs may differ between disease populations. In the following sections, we highlight research in specific disease areas. Most of the published research has focused on JIA and pSLE, although there are emerging bodies of research for lesser-known conditions like LS.\n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).\n\nPROs have been used for several decades in JIA research across various domains, including pain intensity, pain interference, physical function, and medication side effects, and there are ongoing efforts to optimize and further incorporate PROs into research and clinical care.48 Recently, there have been several large-scale efforts responding to the need for rigorous and patient-centric outcome measures for JIA ( ). For example, the Juvenile Arthritis Multidimensional Assessment Report (JAMAR) is a multidimensional PRO measure designed for use in standard clinical care.49 Since its development, the JAMAR has been translated into 54 languages50 and is currently used in a global effort of the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO) to evaluate disease categories, treatment and health status worldwide. Simultaneously, several groups are evaluating PROMIS measures in JIA.51 Recent publications report clinically meaningful severity and minimally important differences for several PROMIS measures.14,52 Although additional work to evaluate validity and reliability of PROMIS measures for JIA in specific contexts is needed, these findings and ongoing use of PROMIS underscores its usefulness in JIA.\n\nTable 1.\n\nThe Juvenile Arthritis Multidimensional Assessment Report (JAMAR)A multidimensional PRO measure designed for use in standard clinical care.49 Since development, the JAMAR has been translated into 54 languages50 and is being used in a worldwide effort of the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO) to evaluate disease categories, treatment and health status worldwide.^International Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) initiativeIntended to improve outcome measurement through a data-driven, iterative consensus process, relevant stakeholders (including patients) established a JIA Working Group in 2015. Since then, the JIA Working Group has developed and updated a Core Domain Set for JIA studies21 using OMERACT methodology, with ongoing efforts to identify and systematically evaluate the best outcome measures for the domains.The CAPTURE-JIA workgroup (United Kingdom)Developed a core dataset to address the need for consensus PROs in JIA.79 Because no pre-existing questionnaire captured all priorities identified by patients and parents, the group developed a new questionnaire (CAPTURE-JIA PROM/PREM) using OMERACT methodology. CAPTURE-JIA PROM/PREM was recently validated and shown to be feasible for use in routine clinical care.80The Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) JIA Research Committee Outcomes WorkgroupWith ongoing efforts endorsed by OMERACT, the working group intends to re-examine core set variables, standardize scoring of disease activity, and integrate parent assessment of overall well-being.*\n\nPediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE).\n\nSeveral PRO measures are used to capture important domains in pSLE including pain, fatigue, physical/social functioning, and others contributing to disease burden.53 Similar to JIA, the CHAQ has been used to assess disability in pSLE,54 but in recent years this legacy measure has been overshadowed by several newer PROs specific to SLE, including the Lupus Quality of Life (LupusQoL), Lupus Patient Reported Outcomes, Lupus Impact Tracker (LIT) instruments, among others. The LIT measures HRQOL in SLE across several domains including cognition, physical health, pain/fatigue impact, and medication side effects.55 The LIT recently showed favorable psychometric properties and correlation with both patient-reported and physician-reported measures of disease activity in a pilot study of adolescents and young adults with pSLE.55 The Simple Measure of the Impact of Lupus Erythematosus in Youngsters (SMILEY) assesses children’s self-perception of quality of life56 and has some evidence to support its validity in pSLE57.58 Several PROMIS Pediatric domains also have support for validity when used in pSLE.16,52\n\nJuvenile dermatomyositis (JDM).\n\nIn general, PRO measure use in JDM is less mature than other PRDs, but there are several ongoing efforts to advance the use of PROs. A core dataset has been developed with input from patients and parents,59 and the CARRA JDM Research Committee Quality Measures Workgroup has partnered with patients and families in collaboration with the CureJM Foundation to evaluate importance of various PROs and quality indicators.60 For JDM, PROMIS measures have been evaluated for validity61 and clinically important differences,62 and used in descriptive studies.63\n\nJuvenile localized scleroderma (LS).\n\nSeveral different PRO measures have been used to evaluate HRQOL in this population, with largely conflicting results.64 The disease-specific Localized Scleroderma Quality of Life Instrument (LoSQI) was designed with input from children and adolescents with LS, and showed content validity using a patient-centered approach.64,65 The LoSQI is currently used in two North American registries (National Registry for Childhood Onset Scleroderma & The Morphea in Adults and Children Cohort), and cross-cultural adaptation for international use is ongoing (https://www.printo.it/projects/ongoing/37).\n\nChronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO)\n\nChronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), also known as chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), is a rare but increasingly recognized painful inflammatory bone disease. Recent studies highlight patient perspective on disease burden and other aspects of HRQOL.66,67 There is a CRMO/CNO working group through OMERACT and a prospective registry of CRMO/CNO is currently collecting PROMIS measures.\n\nFuture Directions\n\nThere are recent and ongoing efforts to develop core outcomes and core outcome assessments that incorporate PROs, including work by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative (https://www.cometinitiative.org/) and the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM; https://www.ichom.org/). The FDA launched a program to develop core outcome sets as part of their patient-focused drug development (PFDD) initiative. The development of core outcome sets is typically based on a consensus-seeking process involving multiple stakeholders (including patients and patient advocates) and the published literature. Adoption of recommended core sets in research and healthcare delivery settings will standardize assessment of the most important HRQOL domains using high quality measures, facilitating aggregation and comparison of results across multiple studies. We encourage similar core sets be developed for PRDs.\n\nFor any PRO measure to be clinically useful, including the PROMIS Pediatric measures, the scores have to be interpretable by end users, requiring patient and physician definitions of low versus high scores, and consensus around scores representing no/normal, mild, moderate or severe symptom burden. One recommended approach is to conduct standard setting (also called bookmarking) studies.68 Mann et al (2020) utilized this technique with PRD patients, parents, and clinicians to identify severity categories for PROMIS Pediatric measures of anxiety, mobility, fatigue, and depressive symptoms.52 Further similar studies are encouraged.\n\nUnderstanding meaningful change in scores over time or difference in scores between groups also is critical to improving interpretability. There are a number of approaches to assess meaningful change or differences, some of which use an established clinical variable as an ‘anchor’ for responsiveness in the PRO score.14,69,70 For PROMIS Pediatric measures, meaningful difference estimates of 3 points were determined for most symptom and functional domains based on scale judgement methods among adolescents, caregivers, and clinicians.71 Morgan et al (2017) used standard setting methods with adolescents, caregivers, and clinicians for JIA and found a 5-point meaningful change for PROMIS Pediatric measures of fatigue and upper extremity function. Other domains had different meaningful change values based on the child, parent, or clinician perspectives.14 Additional research using clinical anchors in real world settings to identify meaningful change or differences in PRD is needed.\n\nIn addition to more research in JIA and pSLE, we also recommend a stronger focus on rare PRD populations. Although there have been efforts directed at rare adult rheumatic disease populations by groups such as OMERACT to develop72–74 disease-specific PRO measures, the lag in pediatric research is more substantial in rare PRDs. We recommend inclusion of PROs into collaborative efforts studying rare PRDs.\n\nFinally, internet-based technology for collecting PROs provides additional opportunities to leverage PROs to improve understanding of children’s symptoms and functioning in PRD. Using technology is feasible and can improve data quality compared to paper forms.75 Further, mobile applications can support more frequent assessment of symptoms and functioning, including ecological momentary assessments, which can improve sensitivity and allow for dynamic assessment of outcomes in a real-world setting.76 Other important applications for administering PROs via technology include ease of sharing data with relevant stakeholders (including back to the patient/family), although more research is needed in this area.77 Sharing PRO data with the child and caregivers may empower them to be more knowledgeable of their condition and to changes in their conditions, and may result in better compliance with completing future PRO measures. However, the use of technology to capture PROs can exacerbate racial disparities in PRO data collection.79 Considering health equity and access in future work is critical.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough pediatric rheumatology has been at the forefront of PRO research, knowledge gaps persist in understanding of the patient experience and ensuring PRO measures are meaningful to patients, valid for a specific purpose, and useful to inform decision-making for clinicians and researchers (Box 3)\n\nBox 3\n\nIdentifying standard core outcomes sets that include both the selected health-related quality of life domain’s PROs and appropriate and well-justified PRO measures for PRDs to allow for aggregation of results across studies.\n\nStandard setting and bookmarking studies to improve interpretability of PRO measure scores.\n\nEstablishing meaningful change (or meaningful differences) in PRDs using clinical anchors in real world settings.\n\nIncreased effort to implement PRO assessment in lesser-known or rare conditions that affect children and adolescents.\n\n​\n\nWhenever possible, children and adolescents with PRD should report directly on their health status via PRO measures.\n\nWhen using PRO measures, researchers and clinicians should consider (1) what is important to measure, (2) who is the best source of information, (3) what is the best measure, and (4) how best to integrate the measures into the targeted setting.\n\nMost published research for PROs has focused on juvenile idiopathic arthritis and pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus, although there are emerging bodies of research for lesser known conditions.\n\nFuture directions for PROs in PRD include establishing core outcome sets, improving interpretability of scores, identifying clinically meaningful changes using a variety of methods, and identifying PROs for rare conditions.\n\nCOI Statements:\n\nDr. Zigler reports funding via her institution from the National Institutes of Health, the Food & Drug Administration, and the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA).
