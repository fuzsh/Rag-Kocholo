        "text": "In 1998, the Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM) began to offer a 5-year civil engineering degree that, in the Spanish context, contained an innovative teaching model, which was characterized by a reduced number of students and project-based learning (PjBL) included in the curriculum. Now, 15 years after the graduation of the first civil engineers from the UCLM, graduates were given a questionnaire to evaluate the extent by which the advantages described in the PjBL literature were perceived as such by these graduates. As a result of chain-referrals and in order to cross-reference the results, a parallel questionnaire was given to their work colleagues. The survey revealed how the development of PjBL-related abilities and skills were appreciated by UCLM graduates, such as the ability to work in groups, communication/debate skills, and leadership. The engineers were generally satisfied with their theoretical and practical learning due to the high demands required of engineering ...\n\nThe paper reviews experience from the implementation of a project based design-build (DB) course given during the last year of the master level education at two specializations at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). Key features concerning constructive alignment, efficient learning modes, the teacher’s role, assessment and general implementation aspects are discussed. Traditional learning approach in mechanical engineering and naval architecture studies at University of Split are described and compared with methodologies developed at the KTH. Possibilities for implementation of project based learning and CDIO approach at University of Split are presented.\n\nChisholm’s ‘first year experience’ is a significant feature of the new industry focused Bachelor of Engineering Technology program delivered in association with the South East Melbourne Manufacturers’ Alliance (SEMMA). Whereas it is common for CDIO Initiative programs to have a first year experience program containing a project typical of the type of industry project they would complete as a graduate engineer or engineering technologist, this goes further by using real industry projects provided by SEMMA members. A concern is that the industry involvement of the projects adds substantially to an already heavy student workload. It is recognised that an excessive workload could lead students to adopt surface learning approaches in other subjects. The goal of the project is to evaluate student perceptions of the value and work load impact of the industry project and other new first year initiatives.\n\nEngineering design and build projects aims at improving student ability to think and solve problem while enhancing soft skills like communication skills and teamwork. Assessing this outcome could be relatively complicated because in some instances students are being exposed to advanced engineering courses that will allow them to perform complex calculations while completing their project. It is therefore necessary to instill into students the motivation to study independently and integrate engineering concepts into practice. Solving the design problem becomes the main motivation behind self-learning that frame the context for advanced engineering courses. This happens as a result of the Problem-Based Learning approach which pushes students to acquire engineering knowledge they don't possess. This approach could raise several problem when assessing quantitatively student outcome achievement and the overall effectiveness of the course. This paper focuses on students' attitudes rather than skills. Design thinking affinities such as team work, problem solving and communication are assessed as part on an ongoing improvement plan. A survey has been developed to measure the course effectiveness. The paper aims at measuring student attitude toward engineering design. Though such instrument has been used in existing engineering education literature, the diversity of students' attitudes justify this study. The study reveals that problem-solving perception constitute the dimension that require interventions. External motivation are proposed in order to create good attitude.
