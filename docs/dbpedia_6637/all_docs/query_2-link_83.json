        "text": "The present study concerned risk and protective factors in the development of child externalizing behavior problems. The risk factors examined were paternal antisocial personality disorder and paternal alcohol use disorder, while the primary protective factor was maternal nurturance. The sample included 329 intact families with a biological son aged 3 to 5 years old. Results of both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses indicated some support for the main effect of maternal nurturance, but none of the interaction terms were significant. In short, maternal nurturance did not serve as a protective factor for children of alcohol-disordered fathers. This negative finding is consistent with the results of the only other longitudinal examination of the question (Curran and Chassin, 1996).\n\nThis Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.
