They laugh with television characters who are funny; they viciously attack and destroy evil videogame creatures; they see advertising\n\nfor candy, makeup, and even liquor; they listen to rap lyrics about sex and violence; and they interact with people all over the world online. The social world these “digital natives” experience is very different from the one their parents and grandparents faced during childhood.\n\nThe purpose of this book is to provide an overview of what is known about the impact of the media on youth in the 21st century. The goal is to provide a comprehensive, research-oriented treatment of how children and adolescents interact with the media and of the role it has assumed in their everyday lives. In each chapter, we review the latest findings as well as seminal studies that have helped frame the issues. Because research alone can often be dry and difficult to follow, we have sprinkled each chapter with illustrations, examples from the media, public debates, and real-life instances of media impact. Our intent is to show the relevance of social science research to media-related issues involving youth.\n\nOne of the unique features of this book is its developmental focus. In Chapter 1, we begin with a discussion of how children and teens are unique audiences of the media, and we outline developmental differences in how young people process and make sense of media content and form. We also discuss how babies increasingly are interacting with media. Our developmental framework is used throughout the remainder of the book to help readers appreciate how, for example, a 5-year-old might respond differently to a media message than a 10-year-old or a 15-year-old would. In subsequent chapters, we examine the impact of media content in distinct areas, including advertising (Chapter 2); educational and prosocial content (Chapter 3); violence (Chapter 4); sexuality (Chapter 5); drugs, alcohol, and tobacco (Chapter 6); obesity and eating disorders (Chapter 7); and the family (Chapter 11). An important strength of this book is the inclusion of chapters written by leading experts in the topic, including Ed Donnerstein, who writes about revolutionary ways in which the Internet has changed the landscape of content available to children (Chapter 8); Megan Moreno, who presents cutting-edge research on youth engagement with social media (Chapter 9); and Jeanne Funk Brockmyer, who writes about the positive and negative outcomes of video game playing (Chapter 10). Finally, Robert McCannon has provided a thorough review of studies and a guide for media literacy and media education as a strategy for inoculating youth against the negative effects of antisocial content (Chapter 12). The book concludes with a consideration of U.S. media policies and their effectiveness at improving the media environment in which children live and learn.\n\nTwo other features make this book unique. First, the book covers the entire developmental period ranging from infancy to childhood to adolescence. Other media-related books have been limited to addressing only children or only teens, but to our knowledge, this is the first media book of its kind that deals with the entire age span that characterizes youth. Second, the three authors bring very different backgrounds to the issues at hand. Victor C. Strasburger is a Distinguished Professor of Pediatrics who has spent most of his career\n\n17\n\nlooking at the impact of the mass media on children’s health. Barbara J. Wilson is the Kathryn Lee Baynes Dallenbach Professor of Communication who conducts research on child development and the media. Amy B. Jordan is the Director of the Media and the Developing Child sector of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, where she studies the impact of media policy on children and families. Together we have identified the media topics that are most pressing to parents, health care practitioners, educators, and policymakers today. As coauthors, we bring our rich and diverse experiences in medicine, social science, child development, and public policy to the issue of youth and media. We also all are parents, which of course gives us firsthand experience with many of the issues we raise.\n\nThe approach we have taken is grounded in the media effects tradition. Where appropriate, we have highlighted other perspectives and readings that take a more cultural or critical approach to the study of media and youth. Those perspectives sensitize us to the importance of considering children and teens as active and powerful agents of their media experiences. Youth cannot be shielded from the media, nor should they be. Clearly, children use the media to learn about their culture as well as about childhood itself. In fact, several chapters in this edition of our book focus exclusively on the positive effects of exposure to the media on children’s development. Still, there is much we can do to help children and teens approach the media as critical consumers. Readers will notice that we have selected some of the most controversial topics about the media for several chapters of this book. Our aim is not to be one-sided but instead to target the areas at the heart of debates in the United States about the media and public health. Where relevant, we also introduce how other countries are grappling with these issues. We hope we have highlighted the importance of considering the content of the messages to which children are exposed. For today’s young people, there are tremendous benefits as well as serious hazards of spending time with media.\n\nThis book is designed to serve as a core text for courses in communication, psychology, education, and public health where content covers children and the media. It could also serve as supplemental reading in courses on child and adolescent development, issues in child development, or issues in the media. The book is most appropriate for an upper-level or advanced undergraduate course or even a beginning graduate seminar in the area. We assume some basic knowledge of research methods in social science, but we also provide background to help readers distinguish and compare different research traditions and methodologies. As a way to engage students, we provide a series of exercises at the end of each chapter. The exercises are meant to stimulate debate and can serve as paper assignments or small-group discussion activities. To our minds, the exercises illustrate just how complex and engaging the media environment is for today’s youth.\n\n18\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nDr. Strasburger would like to thank his colleagues in the Council of Communications of the American Academy of Pediatrics, who have supported his interest in the media, and his colleagues at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, who have allowed him time to write this book.

To the wonder, joy, and vexation of adults, they are different. As they grow older, they become increasingly like us and therefore intelligible to us, but at each age or stage of development there is something for adults to learn more about, to be amused by, and to adjust to.\n\n—Professor Aimee Dorr Television and Children: A Special Medium for a Special\n\nAudience (1986, p. 12)\n\nOver the past twenty or thirty years, the status of childhood and our assumptions about it have become more and more unstable. The distinctions between children and other categories—“youth” or “adults”—have become ever more difficult to sustain.\n\n—Professor David Buckingham After the Death of Childhood: Growing\n\nUp in the Age of Electronic Media (2000, p. 77)\n\nChildren and young people are a distinctive and significant cultural grouping in their own right—a sizeable market share, a subculture even, and one which often “leads the way” in the use of new media.\n\n—Professor Sonia Livingstone Young People and New Media: Childhood and\n\nthe Changing Media Environment (2002, p. 3)\n\nUnlike the children of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, whose media choices were limited and stood out like isolated, familiar landmarks in communal life, kids today inhabit an environment saturated and shaped by a complex “mediascape” that envelops and bombards them day and night.\n\n—James P. Steyer The Other Parent: The Inside Story of\n\nMedia’s Effect on Our Children (2002, p. 4)\n\necause it was one of her favorite movies, Louise decided to rent a DVD of the film Monsters, Inc. to share with her two children, a 4-year-old and a 10-year-old. The 10-year-old immediately liked the blue-furred\n\nSulley and his one-eyed sidekick Mike, laughing at the monsters as they scared children and collected their screams to power their factory in the city of Monstropolis. The 4-year-old, on the other hand, tensed up the first time she saw Sulley’s hulking frame and Mike’s bulging eyeball. The young child asked several nervous questions: “What are they?” “Why are they trying to scare those kids?” Shortly thereafter, the 4-year-old announced that she did not like this “show” and that she wanted to change the channel. When a young girl named Boo accidentally entered the factory, the 4-year-old let out a yelp and buried her face in her blanket (see Figure 1.1). Louise was dismayed at her young child’s reaction, wondering how anyone could be frightened by such funny and benign monsters.\n\nAlthough this example involves a fictitious family, the incident is likely to resonate with parents who are\n\n20\n\noften perplexed by their children’s responses to the media. Indeed, a great many parents have reported that their preschool children were unexpectedly frightened by the gentle but strange-looking alien in the movie E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (Cantor, 1998). Likewise, G-rated movies such as Bambi and Beauty and the Beast have provoked fear in younger children (Hoekstra, Harris, & Helmick, 1999). One study even found that younger children were frightened by Michael Jackson’s music video “Thriller,” which featured the popular singer transforming into a werewolf (Sparks, 1986).\n\nFigure 1.1 Image from the film Monsters, Inc.\n\nThese reactions are not unique to a few films or videos. Research has documented strong differences in the types of media themes that frighten people across age (Harrison & Cantor, 1999). The types of stories that most often upset children younger than 7 involve animals or distorted-looking characters such as ghosts and witches (see Figure 1.2). The impact of such themes greatly diminishes by the time people reach adolescence and adulthood. In older viewers, portrayals involving blood and physical injury are most likely to trigger negative emotions.\n\nFrom an adult perspective, a young child’s fears of monsters and ghosts are difficult to explain. But they signal the importance of considering children’s unique orientation to the world in trying to understand how the media can affect younger audiences. In this chapter, we will explore how children and adolescents interact with the media, concentrating on the crucial role human development plays in the process. As background, we will first give an overview of the media environment and media habits of today’s youth. Next, we will explore several major principles or ideas that can be gleaned from child development research: Children are different from adults, children are different from each other, and adolescents are different from children. We will conclude the chapter with a focused look at specific cognitive skills that emerge during childhood and adolescence that are relevant to making sense of the mass media.\n\nFigure 1.2 Percentage of respondents reporting fright responses to media themes as a function of age at\n\n21\n\ntime of exposure.\n\nSOURCE: Adapted from Harrison and Cantor (1999).\n\nThe Media Environment and Habits of Today’s Youth\n\nA recent headline in the Detroit Free Press warned, “More Kids Vulnerable to Sexual Exploits Online” (Baldas, 2012). The article described an incident in which a 14-year-old boy visited an online chat room and interacted with a stranger who convinced him to expose himself on a webcam. According to research cited in the article, nearly half of American children (48%) between the ages of 10 and 17 say they have visited chat rooms, and one in 11 children (9%) has received an unwanted sexual solicitation online. Such statistics help to stir a sense of panic about the impact of media technologies on youth. But even more traditional forms of media can raise concerns. Reality programs on television feature the lives of teenage moms as they juggle adolescence with parenthood, and those of “real” housewives who seem obsessed with physical appearance and money. Rap artists such as Eminem and Lil Wayne celebrate hatred, revenge, and violence in their music. And video games have become increasingly violent. A popular video game series called Call of Duty allows the player to take on the role of a soldier battling increasing levels of enemy violence, which occasionally results in the death of innocent parents and children.\n\nThere is no doubt that today’s youth are confronted with a media environment very different from the one faced by their grandparents or even their parents (see Figure 1.3). Terms such as digital television, texting, and Google did not even exist 20 or 30 years ago. One of the most profound changes concerns the sheer proliferation of media outlets and technologies. Children today live in a “multidevice, multiplatform, multichannel world” (Carr, 2007). The advent of cable and satellite television has dramatically increased the number of channels available in most homes today. Digital cable is multiplying this capacity. Many homes in the United States are also equipped with CD players, DVD players, personal computers, wireless Internet access, and digital cameras. At a very young age, then, children are learning about keypads, e-readers, touch screens, and remote controls.\n\nAs these technologies proliferate, they are changing the nature of more traditional media. The TV screen,\n\n22\n\nwhich once provided a way to watch broadcast television, is now being used for a much wider range of activities, including online shopping, video-on-demand, and viewing digitally recorded photographs and home movies. Newspapers can still be delivered to the doorstep, but they can also be received online. In other words, old distinctions between the television screen and the computer screen or between print and broadcast are becoming less meaningful.\n\nFigure 1.3\n\nSOURCE: Baby Blues by Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott. © 2006 Reprinted with permission of King Features Syndicate.\n\nAs media technologies are converging, so are the corporations that own them. In January 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Justice Department approved the merger of Comcast, the largest cable operator in the United States, and NBC Universal, the well-known broadcasting company. Together, these two media giants own 10 TV and movie production studios; a number of national cable networks, including USA, MSNBC, Oxygen, and Bravo; over two dozen local NBC and Telemundo broadcast stations; two pro sports teams, four theme parks; and several digital media properties, including NBC.com and iVillage. All of this, plus the merger, means access to more than 23 million video subscribers and nearly 17 million Internet subscribers. The deal represents a powerful integration of content and delivery, meaning that programming can be created, promoted, and delivered by a single corporation. This $30 billion megamerger is one of many examples of corporate synergy and partnership.\n\nSuch mergers have sparked heated debates in the United States about the dangers of monopolistic growth (Hiltzik, 2011; Silver, 2011). Furthermore, media corporations that were once primarily American-based now have major stakes in the international market. So our capitalistic, privately owned media system and the cultural messages we produce are being exported worldwide. And as these media industries grow, they are becoming increasingly commercial in nature. For example, advertising is now a regular part of the Internet (see Chapters 2 and 8) and is creeping into cable television and even movie theaters.\n\nIn the relentless search for new markets, media corporations are increasingly recognizing and targeting youth as a profitable group of consumers (see Chapter 2). Television networks such as Nickelodeon and the Cartoon Network are designed for young viewers; magazines such as J-14, Teen Vogue, American Cheerleader, and Teen Voices are targeted to adolescents, particularly girls; and many websites are aimed specifically at children and adolescents. Poptropica, a site targeting 6- to 15-year-olds, allows children to create a “Poptropican” character to travel the many islands of Poptropica, solve mysteries at each location, and interact with other players in “multiplayer” rooms. Of course, there are game cards and toys available for purchase.\n\n23\n\nEven technologies are being marketed to youth. Handheld gadgets such as the VTech MobiGo and the\n\nLeapFrog Leapster Explorer are popular among younger children, an age group that is also the target for specially designed smartphones (see Figure 1.4). By 2010, one in five (20%) American children between the ages of 6 and 11 had their own cell phone (American Kids Study, 2010). Ownership increases dramatically by age; roughly 77% teens between the ages of 12 and 17 own a cell phone (Lenhart, 2012). And two out of three (67%) teens have a mobile device capable of connecting to the Internet (Rideout, 2012). The proliferation of such handheld devices means that children can experience media around the clock, seven days a week.\n\nFigure 1.4 Technologies for young children.\n\nFinally, digital technology is altering the very nature of media experiences. Images and sounds are more realistic than ever, further blurring the distinction between real-world and media events. By entering virtual worlds while riding on a school bus or sitting in their bedrooms, children can travel to different places, encounter strange creatures, and play adventurous and often violent games. And these new media are far more interactive, allowing youth to become participants in their quest for information, action, and storytelling.\n\nHow are the youth of today responding to this modern and complex media environment? A recent national study took an in-depth look at the media habits of American children (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts, 2010). Surveying more than 2,000 children ages 8 to 18, the study documented that youth today are surrounded by media. The average child in the United States lives in a home with four TVs, two CD players, two radios, three DVD/VCR players, two console video game players, and two computers. More telling, the media have penetrated young people’s bedrooms. A full 71% of American children between the ages of 8 and 18 have a television in their room. Moreover, 49% have access to cable or satellite TV and 50% have a video game console in their room (see Figure 1.5). And one-third (33%) of these young people have Internet access in their bedroom, up from 20% in 2005. Having a TV as well as a video game console in the bedroom is more common among both African American and Hispanic youth than among White and Asian youth (Rideout, Lauricella, & Wartella, 2011).\n\nFigure 1.5 Proportion of children 8 to 18 years of age having various media in their bedroom.\n\n24\n\nSOURCE: Adapted from Rideout, Foehr, and Roberts (2010).\n\nIn terms of exposure, the average U.S. child between the ages of 8 and 18 spends seven and a half hours a day consuming media (Rideout et al., 2010). As noted by Rideout and her colleagues, the typical young person in this country spends roughly the same amount of time with media as most adults spend at work each day. Moreover, time spent with media keeps increasing. In 2005, youth spent an average of six and a half hours a day consuming media—a full hour less than in 2010. Even more critical is that most youth today engage in multitasking—using more than one medium at a time. When multitasking is taken into account, youth today consume a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes’ worth of media content during those seven and a half hours per day.\n\nDespite all the technologies available, most of this time is spent watching television (see Figure 1.6). On average, American children watch four and a half hours of TV content per day. Notably, “television” today is no longer just regularly scheduled programs on broadcast TV. It now includes DVDs of popular TV series and movies, on-demand TV, prerecorded content on TiVo and other digital recorders, and classic and current TV programs watched online using a laptop, iPad, or cell phone.\n\nAs it turns out, media use differs by race and ethnicity. Black, Hispanic, and Asian youth consistently spend more time consuming media each day than do White youth (Babey, Hastert, & Wolstein, 2013; Rideout et al., 2011). The biggest differences are in TV viewing: Black and Hispanic youth spend at least one hour more a day watching TV than White youth do (Rideout et al., 2011). In contrast, Asian youth spend about an hour more a day using the computer than do the other three groups. These differences hold up even after controlling for parents’ socioeconomic status and whether the child is from a single- or two-parent home.\n\nFigure 1.6 Average amount of time children 8 to 18 years of age spend with each medium during a typical day.\n\n25\n\nSOURCE: Adapted from Rideout, Foehr, and Roberts (2010).\n\nThe national study by Rideout and her colleagues (2010) also revealed that parents typically do not exercise much control over their children’s media experiences. Less than half (46%) of the children reported that there were rules in their home about what they could watch on TV, and less than one-third (30%) said there were rules concerning which video games they could play. In general, children more often have rules about the specific types of content they may consume than about the amount of time they may spend consuming it. In addition, the likelihood of having media rules decreases with age—30% of 15- to 18-year-olds reported having no rules at all about any type of media use, whereas only 3% of 8- to 10-year-olds reported no rules. Of course, when parents themselves are queried, they report supervising their children’s media use to a greater extent than their offspring report (Gentile, Nathanson, Rasmussen, Reimer, & Walsh, 2012). Underscoring the importance of parental oversight is the fact that children and teens who have a TV set in their bedroom spend substantially more time watching television than do those without a set in their room (Jordan et al., 2010; Rideout et al., 2010).\n\nComputers are rapidly spreading in American homes, and so is Internet access. Today the vast majority of young people have a computer at home regardless of their parents’ education or race (Rideout et al., 2010). However, Internet access, especially high-speed wireless, still varies by demographics: White youth and youth whose parents are college educated are more likely to have high-speed access. The most popular computer activities for young people are visiting a social networking site such as Facebook, playing a computer game, and watching a video on a site such as YouTube.\n\nOf course, one of the most dramatic changes in the media landscape is the explosion of mobile devices. Roughly two-thirds of young people between the ages of 8 and 18 own a cell phone, and nearly one-third have their own laptop (Rideout et al., 2010). It is rare these days to spend time with any teen who is not carrying a phone. And texting is a big part of teen communication (see Figure 1.7). One recent study found that the typical teen sends an average of 167 text messages a day (Lenhart, 2012). Older girls in particular have embraced this form of communication; girls between 14 and 17 years of age send an average of almost\n\n26\n\n200 texts a day, or 6,000 texts a month. Heavy texters are more likely to talk on their cell phones, more likely to spend time with friends outside of school, and more likely to use a social networking site than are their light-texting peers (Lenhart, 2012). In other words, heavy texters are socially active teens. Yet despite all these gadgets, teens report that they prefer using old-fashioned face-to-face communication to talk with friends (Rideout, 2012). Moreover, in a recent national survey of 1,000 13- to 17-year-olds, 43% agreed strongly or somewhat that they wished they could “unplug” sometimes (Rideout, 2012). In addition, 41% reported that they would describe themselves as “addicted” to their cell phone.\n\nFigure 1.7\n\nSOURCE: Zits © 2005 Zits Partnership. Reprinted with permission of King Features Syndicate.\n\nMost of the tracking of media habits has focused on older children and teens. However, infants and preschoolers are spending a fair amount of time with media as well. One national study surveyed over 1,000 parents of children ages 6 months to 6 years (Vandewater et al., 2007), age groups that many assume are too young to be involved much with media. Contrary to this assumption, the average American child between the ages of 6 months and 6 years spends about an hour and a half a day using media. Again, most of this time is spent watching television or videos and DVDs (see Figure 1.8). In fact, children younger than age 6 spend more time watching TV and videos than they do reading (or being read to) or playing outside. Perhaps most surprising, nearly 20% of children younger than age 3 have a TV set in their bedroom; roughly 40% of 3- to 6- year-olds have a TV in their room (see Figure 1.9). In a recent large-scale study of over 600 preschoolers, those who had a TV in their bedroom were significantly more likely to suffer from sleep problems, including daytime tiredness and difficulty falling asleep at night (Garrison, Liekweg, & Christakis, 2011).\n\nAmerican children are not so different from some of their counterparts abroad. One early study of more than 5,000 children living in 23 different countries found that the average 12-year-old spent three hours a day watching television (Groebel, 1999), a figure remarkably comparable to that found in the United States at the time. A more recent study of five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) found that 95% of young people in this region have Internet access in the home, but that television viewing remains the single most prominent leisure activity (Carlsson, 2010).\n\nTo summarize, youth today are confronted with a media environment that is rapidly changing. Technologies are proliferating, merging, more interactive, and mobile. Furthermore, the content featured in these technologies is increasingly graphic, realistic, and commercial in nature. At the same time, media use is at an all-time high. Youth today spend anywhere from one-third to one-half of their waking hours with some\n\n27\n\nform of media (see Figure 1.10). Preteens and teens frequently are engaging in more than one media activity\n\nat a time, making estimates of overall exposure more challenging. And much of this media use is becoming more private as children carry smartphones throughout their daily activities and then retreat to their bedrooms to watch TV, play video games, listen to music, or text their friends. We will now highlight several developmental principles that underscore the need to consider youth as a special audience in today’s media environment.\n\nFigure 1.8 Children spend a great deal of time watching television each day.\n\nFigure 1.9 Television sets are common in American children’s bedrooms.\n\nFigure 1.10\n\n28\n\nSOURCE: Zits © 2005 Zits Partnership. Reprinted with permission of King Features Syndicate.\n\nChildren Are Different From Adults\n\nMost adults believe that they personally are not affected much by the media. In a well-documented phenomenon called the “third-person effect,” people routinely report that others are more strongly influenced by the media than they themselves are (Perloff, 2009). As an example, a recent study found that undergraduates perceived themselves to be less likely to be harmed by Facebook use in terms of privacy and future employment opportunities than were their closest friends, friends in their Facebook network, and even Facebook users in general (Paradise & Sullivan, 2012). This difference in perceived impact gets larger as the age of the “other” person decreases. In other words, adults perceive that the younger the other person is, the stronger the effect of the media will be (Eveland, Nathanson, Detenber, & McLeod, 1999). Interestingly, even children endorse a kind of third-person effect, claiming that only “little kids” imitate what they see on TV (Buckingham, 2000).\n\nAre children more susceptible to media influence than adults are? At the extremes, there are two radically different positions on this issue (see Buckingham, 2011). One view is that children are naive and vulnerable and thus in need of adult protection. This stance sees the media as inherently problematic and in some cases evil because they feature material that children are simply not yet ready to confront. Buckingham (2000) points out that “media panics” have been with us a long time, especially those concerning the impact of sex and violence on children. Such panics gain steam any time a public crisis occurs, such as the massacre at Columbine High School, or any time a new and unknown form of media technology is developed (Wartella & Reeves, 1985).\n\nA contrasting view is that children are increasingly sophisticated, mature, and media savvy (Livingstone, 2002). According to this position, efforts to shield youth from media are too protectionist in nature, smack of paternalism, and construe children as acted upon instead of actors. Instead, children should be empowered to take control of their own media experiences, negotiating and learning along the way. Buckingham (2000) noted that this position is widely shared among those who see children as independent consumers who should be able to spend their own money and buy what they want.\n\nThese very different perspectives illustrate that notions of childhood are constantly being defined, debated, and renegotiated over the course of history (James, Allison, Jenks, & Prout, 1998). In truth, neither of these extreme positions seems very satisfying. Children are not entirely passive in the face of the media, nor are they extremely worldly and discriminating. The reality is probably somewhere in between. Nevertheless, most\n\n29\n\nparents, developmental psychologists, policymakers, and educators would agree that children are not the same\n\nas adults (see Figure 1.11).\n\nSeveral features of childhood support this distinction. First, children bring less real-world knowledge and experience to the media environment (Dorr, 1986). Every aspect of the physical and social world is relatively new to a young child, who is busy discovering what people are like, how plants grow, what animals eat, and where one neighborhood is located relative to another. As they get older, children explore increasingly abstract concepts and ideas such as the social norms of their culture, what prejudice is, and how life begins. In almost every arena, though, children possess a more limited knowledge base compared to adults.\n\nOne implication of this is that children can fail to understand a media message if they lack the background knowledge needed to make sense of the information. As an illustration, in 1996, researchers at the Children’s Television Workshop (now called Sesame Workshop) wanted to produce a Sesame Street segment about visiting the doctor. On the basis of preliminary interviews, the researchers discovered that preschoolers mostly associated doctor visits with getting shots and that they had little knowledge of the importance of such vaccinations (“Feeling Good,” 1996). Had the producers not discovered this, they might have created a script that focused too much on getting shots, inadvertently reinforcing children’s negative and limited impressions of the purpose of going to a physician.\n\nFigure 1.11\n\nSOURCE: Baby Blues © 2007 Baby Blues Partnership. Reprinted with permission of King Features Syndicate.\n\nAs another example, researchers working on the Sesame Street website wanted to create an activity that would help preschoolers learn about email. In developing the “Sesame Street Post Office,” the researchers discovered that preschool children have little, if any, experience with email or with composing letters (Revelle, Medoff, & Strommen, 2001). In other words, the children’s background knowledge was quite limited. Taking this into account, the post office activity was designed to be very concrete by having the child choose a Muppet to email from a set of pictures of Muppets and then choose questions to ask from a set tailored to each Muppet. The child’s message was displayed on the screen before it was sent so that children could see how their choices influenced the composed letter. Researchers also determined that adding a “Dear [name of Muppet]” to the beginning of the email and a “Your friend, [name of child]” to the end of it helped children understand the conventions of letter writing.\n\nThe lack of real-world knowledge can also make children more willing to believe the information they receive in the media. It is difficult to evaluate a story for accuracy or truthfulness in the face of no alternative\n\n30\n\ndata. An adult watching a TV advertisement is able to evaluate that message in the context of knowledge about the television industry as well as a vast array of personal experiences with purchasing products. A child, on the other hand, rarely has this rich set of knowledge structures on which to rely. As an illustration, Figure 1.12 presents children’s perceptions of how truthful advertisements are (Chan, 2001). In a sample of over 400 children ages 5 to 12, a full 42% reported that television advertising is “mostly true.” Given this level of trust, a young child seems fairly defenseless when confronted with a slick TV ad that costs thousands of dollars to produce and may yield millions of dollars in sales profit.\n\nA second feature that distinguishes childhood from adulthood is the strong eagerness to learn that marks the early years (Dorr, 1986). Parents find this tendency exhausting sometimes, as their infant daughter puts one more object in her mouth or their preschool son asks for the 20th time, “What’s that?” or “Why?” Such curiosity is a hallmark of childhood and is celebrated by educators. But it means that children are as open to learn from the mass media as from other sources, particularly in situations where firsthand experience is not possible. For example, most American children are not able to visit Japan, but they can learn about the country by reading a book or viewing a TV documentary. A preschooler can even watch Big Bird in Japan, a Sesame Workshop production available on DVD or even YouTube. These examples show the educational benefits of the media. Unfortunately, a child could also learn about Japan by visiting a website created by a hate group that disparages people of Asian descent.\n\nFigure 1.12 Children’s (5–12 years of age) perceptions of the truthfulness of TV advertising.\n\nSOURCE: Adapted from Chan (2001).\n\nA third feature that characterizes childhood is a relative lack of experience with the media. Admittedly, these days some children are actually more media savvy than their parents are. Indeed, many children know how to take and store photos on a smartphone or program the digital video recorder while their parents still fumble with these technologies. One study found that 19% of children younger than age 6 were able to turn on the computer by themselves (Rideout & Hamel, 2006). But with most media, it is still the case that adults have spent more time with the technology. Adults readily appreciate, for example, that the placement of a\n\n31\n\nstory in a newspaper signals something about its importance, that public television is a noncommercial channel in contrast to the broadcast networks, and that there are different genres and subgenres of movies. In contrast, children often show an incomplete understanding of production techniques such as dissolves and split screens (Beentjes, deKoning, & Huysmans, 2001), have difficulty distinguishing nightly news programs from tabloid news shows such as Inside Edition and Current Affair (Wilson & Smith, 1995), and do not fully appreciate the commercial nature of most media in the United States (Dorr, 1980). This lack of familiarity with the technical forms and structure of the media makes a child less able to critically evaluate the content presented.\n\nTo summarize, children differ from adults in a number of ways that have implications for responding to the media. Younger age groups have less experience with the real world and at the same time possess a strong readiness to learn about those things with which they are unfamiliar. They also tend to be less savvy about the nature, intricacies, and potential distortions of the media. Such naïveté makes a preschooler and even an elementary schooler more likely to believe, learn from, and respond emotionally to media messages than is a more mature and discriminating adult.\n\nChildren Are Different From Each Other\n\nIt may be easier to recognize that children are different from adults than it is to appreciate how much children differ from one another. In some ways, the label children itself is misleading because it encourages us to think of a fairly homogeneous group of human beings. As the Monsters, Inc. example at the start of this chapter illustrates, a 4-year-old thinks and responds to the world very differently than a 10-year-old does. But even a group of 4-year-olds will exhibit marked differences in how they respond to the same situation. In fact, sometimes it is difficult to believe that two children are the same age or in the same grade level.\n\nOn any elementary school playground, kindergartners can be readily distinguished from 5th graders—they are shorter in height and normally weigh less. Their heads are smaller, they dress differently, and they tend to be more physically active. But even more profound differences exist in their cognitive functioning. Younger children attend to and interpret information in different ways than do their older counterparts. Several influential perspectives on children’s development support this idea, including Piaget’s (1930, 1950) theory of cognitive development as well more recent models of information processing (Flavell, Miller, & Miller, 2002; Siegler, 2005).\n\nAge is often used as a marker of these differences in cognitive abilities, although there is tremendous variation in how and when children develop. Still, most research reveals major differences between preschoolers and early elementary schoolers (3–7 years of age) on the one hand and older elementary school children (8–12 years of age) on the other, in terms of the strategies they use to make sense of the world (Flavell et al., 2002). These strategies have important implications for how children respond to mass media, as will be discussed below in the section titled “Developmental Differences in Processing the Mass Media.”\n\nCognitive development is not the only factor that distinguishes children from each other. Personality differences also set children apart. For instance, some children are withdrawn or inhibited in unfamiliar\n\n32\n\nsituations, whereas others are not (Kagan & Snidman, 2004). Children also differ in the degree to which they possess prosocial dispositions toward others (Eisenberg, Fabes, & Spinrad, 2006), the degree to which they are capable of regulating their emotions (Stegge & Terwogt, 2007), and the degree to which they enjoy novel or stimulating situations (Zuckerman, 1994).\n\nResearch consistently shows sex differences among children, too. For example, girls tend to prefer activities that are less vigorous than the ones boys tend to choose (Eaton & Enns, 1986), and boys typically are more physically aggressive (Kistner et al., 2010). In terms of cognitive skills, girls generally obtain higher grades in school and do better on tests involving writing, whereas boys do better on visual-spatial tasks (Halpern, 2004).\n\nThe fact is that children, even those who share biological parents and are raised in the same environment, differ on many dimensions. And children themselves recognize these differences early in development. For example, children become aware of their own gender by around age 2 (Berk, 2000). During the preschool years, they begin formulating mental conceptions of activities, norms, attributes, and scripts that are associated with being male or female (Ruble et al., 2007). Young children’s initial understanding of gender as a social category is often based on superficial qualities such as hair length and dress. As they enter elementary school, children’s conceptions grow more sophisticated, and they become keenly interested in gender role information in the culture. They actively search for cultural meanings about gender in their homes, on the playground, and in the media (see Bussey & Bandura, 1999). In other words, the unique characteristics that differentiate children in turn get represented and reinforced in the culture.\n\nAll of these unique characteristics make it difficult to come up with a single prototype for what a child is like. Therefore, when we make generalizations about children and the media, we must be careful to take into account the developmental, personality, and gender characteristics of the individuals involved.\n\nAdolescents Are Different From Children\n\nAlthough we cannot generalize about all children, we can clearly differentiate them as a group from their older counterparts—teenagers. Parents certainly appreciate this transformation as they watch their warm, cuddly 12-year-old turn into an emotionally distant and independent 13-year-old. Of course, this developmental progression does not happen evenly or all at once. But the changes are reflected in a variety of activities and interests that a young person has, including media preferences. For example, children under the age of 12 prefer watching cartoons and animated movies on television, many of which involve fantasy themes (see Table 1.1). In contrast, viewers between the ages of 12 and 17 prefer reality shows and sitcoms that focus on teenage issues. There is some overlap in the list of top 10 TV programs for these two age groups, but the differences are striking.\n\nAdolescence is often characterized as a time of challenge and turbulence (Roth & Brooks-Gunn, 2000). Along with bodily changes that can be quite dramatic, teens are faced with increased independence and growing self-discovery. Scholars of adolescent development refer to these changes as developmental transitions or passages between childhood and adulthood (Arnett, 1992a). In other words, the sometimes stormy periods are a necessary and normal part of growing up (Gondoli, 1999).\n\n33\n\nUnfortunately, parents and even the general public often view the teenage years with some trepidation. One national poll revealed that 71% of adults described teenagers negatively, using terms such as irresponsible and wild (Public Agenda, 1999). Some of this public opinion is likely fueled by the media’s preoccupation with high-profile cases of troubled teens who become violent. Contrary to public opinion, though, most teens are able to navigate adolescence in a socially responsible way, learning new competencies and new roles on the path to adulthood (Graber, Brooks-Gunn, & Petersen, 1996).\n\nWhat are some of the developmental hallmarks of adolescence? One of the main challenges a teen faces is identity formation (Klimstra, Hale, Raaijmakers, Branje, & Meeus, 2010). During the teenage years, boys and girls alike begin to ask questions about who they are and how they differ from their parents. This emerging sense of the self is fragile and malleable as teens “try on” different appearances and behaviors. An article in Newsweek magazine described the teen years like this: “From who’s in which clique to where you sit in the cafeteria, every day can be a struggle to fit in” (Adler, 1999, p. 56). As this quote suggests, the process of identity formation is highly social in nature, with teens working to integrate different facets of themselves as they encounter others at school, at work, and during leisure activities (Crosnoe & Johnson, 2011). Today’s youth even use the media to grapple with their identities. For example, one study of 20 female teen bloggers found that the girls used LifeJournal as a digital space for self-expression and “self-theorizing” (Davis, 2010). Another study found that 50% of 9- to 18-year-olds who used the Internet had pretended to be somebody else while communicating by email, instant messaging (IM), or chat (Valkenburg, Schouten, & Peter, 2005). Teens also spend a great deal of time posting photographs, videos, and personal information on popular websites such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. As they experiment with ways of expressing themselves online, teens may be working through the psychosocial process of understanding who they are and how they feel about their emerging identity (Valkenburg & Peter, 2011).\n\nTable 1.1 Top 10 Programs for the 2010–2011 Season\n\n34\n\nSOURCE: Copyrighted information of Nielsen, licensed for use herein.\n\nA second challenge of adolescence is increased independence. Parents naturally feel less need to supervise a 13-year-old who, unlike a 5-year-old, can dress, study, and even go places alone. Teens often have jobs outside the home and by age 16 can typically drive a car, furthering their autonomy. In one study, the percentage of waking hours that teens spent with their families fell from 33% to 14% between the 5th and 12th grade (Larson, Richards, Moneta, Holmbeck, & Duckett, 1996).\n\nTime away from parents can provide teens with opportunities to make independent decisions. It also can allow for experimentation with a variety of behaviors, some of which are not very healthy. A large national study involving more than 90,000 adolescents in Grades 6 to 12 found strong differences between teens who regularly ate dinner with a parent and those who did not (Fulkerson et al., 2006). In particular, teens who spent less dinner time with parents showed significantly higher rates of smoking, drinking, depression, violence, and school problems, even after controlling for family support and family communication. The direction of causality is difficult to pinpoint here because it may be that troubled teens simply choose to spend less time at home. However, other studies have also documented the importance of parent involvement as a buffer against unhealthy behaviors during the teenage years (Cookston & Finlay, 2006).\n\n35\n\nThis point leads us to a third feature of adolescence—risk taking. Today’s teens face tough decisions regarding a number of dangerous behaviors such as smoking, drug use, and sexual activity. And there is no doubt that adolescence is a time of experimentation with reckless activities (Santelli, Carter, Orr, & Dittus, 2009). For example, 1.4 million American youth under the age of 18 started smoking cigarettes for the first time in 2010 (National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2010). Furthermore, a recent national survey revealed that 47% of 9th through 12th graders reportedly have had sexual intercourse (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). The same study found that 17% of the teens had carried a weapon (i.e., gun, knife, or club) during the 30 days preceding the survey, 39% had drunk alcohol, 23% had used marijuana, and 40% of sexually active students had not used a condom (see Figure 1.13). Moreover, 24% had ridden in a vehicle in the last 30 days that was driven by someone who had been drinking.\n\nSome of this risk taking may be a function of what scholars have labeled “adolescent egocentrism” (Elkind, 1967, 1985; Schwartz, Maynard, & Uzelac, 2008). In particular, teenagers often seem preoccupied with their own thoughts and appearance and assume others are equally interested in their adolescent experiences. This view of the self as unique and exceptional can in turn lead to a feeling of invulnerability to negative consequences (Greene, Krcmar, Walters, Rubin, & Hale, 2000). In other words, self-focused teens think they are different from everyone else and that tragedies occurring to others “won’t happen to me.” Indeed, studies show that teens routinely underestimate their own personal chances of getting into a car accident compared with the risks they assume others face (Finn & Bragg, 1986). Similar misjudgments have been found among sexually active young girls who underestimate the likelihood that they themselves might get pregnant (Gerrard, McCann, & Fortini, 1983). One study linked this type of optimistic bias to teen smoking. Song, Glantz, and Halpern-Felsher (2009) surveyed over 300 ninth graders every six months for two years. They found that adolescents who perceived low risk associated with being exposed to secondhand smoke were more likely to start smoking in subsequent months than were those who perceived secondhand smoke to be risky. Risk taking can also be viewed as an adolescent’s effort to assert independence from parents and to achieve adult status (Jessor, 1992). However, not all teens engage in reckless behaviors, and even the ones who do seldom limit their activities to those legally sanctioned for adults. Arnett (1995) argued that risk taking must be viewed in the larger context of an adolescent’s socialization. Some teens experience narrow socialization, which he characterized as involving strong allegiance to the family and community, clear expectations and responsibilities, unambiguous standards of conduct, and swift sanctions for any deviation from those standards. Other teens are raised in an environment of broad socialization, where independence and autonomy are encouraged, standards of conduct are loose or even self-determined, and enforcement of standards is lenient and uneven. Arnett argued that in addition to parents, the schools, the legal system, and even the media contribute to these overarching patterns of socialization. As might be expected, risk taking is more prevalent in cultures in which socialization is broad rather than narrow (see Arnett, 1999, for a review).\n\nFigure 1.13 Percentage of U.S. high school students who reported engaging in risk-related behaviors over the last two decades.\n\n36\n\nSOURCE: Adapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2012).\n\nA fourth feature of adolescence is the importance of peers. Teens spend a great deal of time with friends and place a high value on these relationships (Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker, 2006). On average, teens spend up to one-third of their waking hours with friends (Hartup & Stevens, 1997). In her controversial book The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do, Judith Harris argued that parents have a minimal influence on their child’s development other than to nurture and shape the child’s peer group (Harris, 1998). Peer groups certainly do make a difference during adolescence. Studies have documented the role of peers in the initiation and continuation of behaviors such as cigarette smoking (Scherrer et al., 2012), drug use (Creemers et al., 2009), and sexual intercourse (Whitbeck, Yoder, Hoyt, & Conger, 1999). Engaging in reckless behavior often helps a teen become a member of a peer group, and the group itself can foster a sense of collective rather than individual invincibility (Arnett, 1992a).\n\nBut peer influence is not as straightforward and not necessarily as negative as some might assume. Friends actually can be a source of support for teens and can also increase self-esteem (Wilkinson, 2004). Generally, adolescents are more susceptible to antisocial peer pressure when they have more delinquent than nondelinquent friendships (Haynie, 2002), when they have poorer relationships with their parents (Dishion, 1990), and when they are alienated from community support structures such as schools (Arnett, 1992b; Resnick et al., 1997).\n\nLast but not least, puberty and sexual development are hallmarks of adolescence. Body hair, acne, muscle growth, and weight gain are only a few manifestations of the dramatic physical changes that occur during the teenage years. Puberty typically begins during early adolescence, around age 9 or 10 for girls and roughly one to two years later for boys (Archibald, Graber, & Brooks-Gunn, 2003), although there are large individual variations. As their bodies change, many teens also experience an increased energy level as a function of\n\n37\n\nsignificant changes in their endocrine system (Petersen & Taylor, 1980). Furthermore, increased production of androgens and estrogens stimulates the growth of reproductive organs (see Rekers, 1992).\n\nAs might be expected, the hormonal and physical changes associated with puberty are accompanied by an increased interest in sexuality. In one study, for example, 12- to 15-year-old girls who were more physically mature (i.e., had experienced earlier puberty) reported a greater interest in seeing sexual content in the movies, television, and magazines than did those who were less mature (J. D. Brown, Halpern, & L’Engle, 2005). Thus, at some point during adolescence, most teens will become intensely curious about sex and will seek information about sexual norms, attitudes, and practices in their culture. It is no accident, then, that popular teen magazines devote a great deal of space to sexual issues and relationships (Walsh-Childers, 1997).\n\nWhether the teenage years are characterized as tempestuous or transitional, there is no doubt that significant developmental changes occur during this period. Adolescents spend more time alone or with friends and less time with parents. This growing independence comes at the same time that teens are exploring their identities and their sexuality. The challenge is to provide these young people with enough latitude as well as guidance so that the decisions they make will result in a healthy rather than risky lifestyle.\n\nDevelopmental Differences in Processing the Mass Media\n\nSo far, we have focused on broad developmental features that characterize childhood and adolescence and that differentiate these periods from adulthood. Now we will turn our attention more directly to young people’s interactions with the media. Any individual who confronts a mediated message must make sense of and interpret the information presented. Like adults, children and adolescents construct stories or readings of media messages that they encounter (Dorr, 1980). Given some of the pronounced differences in experience and maturation described above, we can expect that interpretations of the same content will vary across the life span. That is, a young child is likely to construct a different story from a TV program than an older child or teenager will.\n\nThese different interpretations may seem “incorrect” or incomplete to an adult viewer. But even among mature adult viewers, there are differences in how people make sense of stories. For example, one early study looked at people’s reactions to the 1970s TV sitcom All in the Family, featuring a bigoted character named Archie Bunker (Vidmar & Rokeach, 1974). The research revealed that interpretations of the program varied widely based on individual attitudes about race. Viewers who held prejudiced attitudes identified with Archie Bunker and saw nothing wrong with his racial and ethnic slurs (see Figure 1.14). In contrast, viewers who were less prejudiced evaluated Archie in negative ways and perceived the program to be a satire on bigotry.\n\nWhat cognitive activities are involved when a young person watches a television program, enjoys a movie, or plays a video game? In general, five mental tasks are involved (Calvert, 1999; Collins, 1983). First, the child needs to select important information for processing. When viewing television, for example, a multitude of auditory and visual signals are presented in a particular program or advertisement. Moreover, there are cues in the environment that often compete with the television, such as family members talking in the background or\n\n38\n\nloud music from another room. A viewer must allocate attention to these myriad cues, consciously or unconsciously filtering out what is not essential and instead focusing on what is important in the situation.\n\nFigure 1.14 Adults’ reactions to the TV show All in the Family as a function of viewer prejudice.\n\nSOURCE: Adapted from Vidmar and Rokeach (1974).\n\nSecond, the child needs to sequence the major events or actions into some kind of story. Most media messages feature a narrative or storyline (Grossberg, Wartella, & Whitney, 1998). Television plots are the easiest example of this, but even an advertisement, a video game, a song, or a radio program conveys a story.\n\nThird, the child needs to draw inferences from implicit cues in the message. The media do not have the space or the time to explicitly present all aspects of a story. Television programs jump from one location to another, characters in movies have dreams or experience flashbacks, and even characters in video games travel in ways that are not always orderly or linear. A sophisticated consumer recognizes the need to “read between the lines” to fill in the missing information. But a young child may fail to recognize that time has passed between scenes (Smith, Anderson, & Fischer, 1985), that the events depicted are only part of a dream (Wilson, 1991), or that a flashback to earlier events in the plotline has occurred (Durkin & Lowe, 1999).\n\nFourth, to make sense of both explicit and implicit cues in the message, a child must draw on the rich database of information he or she has stored in memory that relates to the media content. For instance, a child who lives in a rural community will have an easier time making sense of a movie about a family that loses a farm to bank foreclosure than will a child who lives in an apartment complex in New York City. This rich set of past experiences and acquired knowledge forms a mental database that helps a child interpret new messages.\n\nFifth, the child will typically evaluate the message in some way. The simplest evaluation pertains to liking or not liking the message. Children as young as 2 years of age already show preferences for certain types of TV programs, such as those featuring puppets and young characters (Lemish, 1987; Rideout & Hamel, 2006). One mother described her preschool daughter’s attachment to a televised purple dinosaur in the following way: “She played the Barney tape every single hour that she was awake the entire weekend. And if we tried to turn it off, she’d be screaming, yelling, crying” (Alexander, Miller, & Hengst, 2001, p. 383). As children grow\n\n39\n\nolder, they become increasingly sophisticated and critical of media messages (Potter, 2010). Not only are they capable of evaluating the content, but they also begin to appreciate the forms, economic structure, and institutional constraints that characterize different media (Dorr, 1980). An adolescent, for example, may reject all mainstream American television programming because of its inherent commercialism.\n\nGiven this set of tasks, we can expect that children will process media messages in different ways across development. We now describe some of the major shifts in cognitive processing that occur during the transition from early to middle childhood and during the transition from late childhood to adolescence. By no means is this list exhaustive; instead, it reflects some of the skills that are most relevant to interacting with the media (for further reading, see Dorr, 1980; Flavell et al., 2002; Wilson & Drogos, 2009). We will end this chapter with a topic receiving a great deal of interest these days: How do infants and toddlers interact with the media?\n\nTwo caveats need to be noted here. First, most of the changes highlighted below occur gradually rather than abruptly during development (Flavell et al., 2002). Piaget (1950, 1952) argued that younger children’s thinking is qualitatively different from that of older children, such that their cognitive systems progress through distinct stages (i.e., sensorimotor, approximately 0–2 years of age; preoperational, 2–7 years; concrete operational, 7–11 years; formal operational, 11 years and older). However, research indicates that cognitive performance can be uneven across different types of tasks and that children exhibit varied skill levels even within a particular domain (Siegler, 2005). Thus, it is widely believed that development is far less stagelike or abrupt than Piaget’s theory would have us believe.\n\nSecond, the ages during which these shifts occur vary markedly across children. For rough approximations, we define younger children as those between 2 and 7, older children as those between 8 and 12, and adolescents as those between 13 and 18.\n\nYounger Children Versus Older Children\n\nFrom Perceptual to Conceptual Processing. Preschoolers pay close attention to how things look and sound. This focus on salient features has been referred to as perceptual boundedness (Bruner, 1966). Perceptual boundedness is defined as an overreliance on perceptual information at the expense of nonobvious or unobservable information that may be more relevant (Springer, 2001). For example, preschoolers frequently group objects together based on shared perceptual features such as color or shape (Bruner, Olver, & Greenfield, 1966; Melkman, Tversky, & Baratz, 1981). In contrast, by age 6 or 7, children have begun sorting objects based on conceptual properties such as the functions they share (Tversky, 1985). With regard to the media, studies show that younger children pay strong visual attention to perceptually salient features such as animation, sound effects, and lively music (Anderson & Levin, 1976; Calvert & Gersh, 1987; Schmitt, Anderson, & Collins, 1999). Older children, on the other hand, tend to be more selective in their attention, searching for cues that are meaningful to the plot rather than those that are merely salient (Calvert, Huston, Watkins, & Wright, 1982).\n\nOne creative experiment involving television revealed this distinction quite clearly. Hoffner and Cantor (1985) exposed children to a television character who was either attractive or ugly and who acted kind toward\n\n40\n\nothers or was cruel (see Figure 1.15). Preschoolers generally rated the ugly character as mean and the attractive\n\ncharacter as nice, independent of the character’s actual behavior. In other words, their evaluations were strongly affected by the character’s physical appearance. Older children’s judgments, in contrast, were influenced more by the character’s behavior than her looks.\n\nWhy are younger children so perceptual in their focus? Tversky (1985) has argued that all children can be swayed by strong perceptual cues in a situation, but that as they develop children come to suppress immediate, salient responses in favor of slower, more thoughtful ones. This shift is undoubtedly fostered by the acquisition of knowledge that is conceptual in nature, such as the idea that motives are an important predictor of behavior. Children of all ages, and even adults, are also less likely to be swayed by perceptual cues when they are dealing with situations and tasks that are familiar (Springer, 2001).\n\nWe can apply this developmental trend in perceptual boundedness to the example at the beginning of this chapter. The preschool child is transfixed by the monsters’ strange physical appearance, reacting with fright when she sees their distorted forms. In contrast, the older child is able to minimize the characters’ looks and instead focus on the creatures’ behavior and motivation.\n\nFrom Centration to Decentration. As noted above, children and even adults can respond strongly to salient features in a message. But another characteristic of younger children’s thinking is that they often focus on a single striking feature to the exclusion of other, less striking features. This tendency has been called centration and is illustrated in some of Piaget’s classic liquid conservation tasks (see Ginsburg & Opper, 1979). In these tasks, a child is shown two glasses containing identical amounts of water. Once the child agrees that the amounts are identical, the experimenter pours the water from one glass into a third glass, which is taller and thinner (see Figure 1.16). The experimenter then asks the child whether the two amounts of liquid are still identical or whether one glass now contains more water. The typical preschooler concludes that the taller glass has more liquid in it. Why? Because the taller glass looks as if it has more in it. In other words, the differential height of the liquids captures most of the preschooler’s attention.\n\nFigure 1.15 Four characters differing in appearance and behavior.\n\n41\n\nSOURCE: From Hoffner and Cantor (1985).

Reprinted with permission.\n\nIn contrast, older children are increasingly able to “decenter” their attention and take into account the full array of perceptual cues. The liquid in one glass is higher, but that glass also has a different shape to it. It is taller and thinner. Also, pouring the liquid from one container to another does not change the quantity. The amount of liquid stays the same. By recognizing that the liquid is the same, the older child is able to conserve continuous quantities.\n\nThe same developmental differences are found with other types of conservation tasks. For example, two rows of six pennies can be laid out next to one another in one-to-one correspondence. If one row is then compressed, a younger child is likely to perceive it as containing fewer coins because it is now shorter (Ginsburg & Opper, 1979). In contrast, the older child notes all the perceptual data in the situation and recognizes that the number of pennies is unchanged or “conserved” despite appearances.\n\nFigure 1.16 A typical Piagetian conservation task.\n\n42\n\nO’Bryan and Boersma (1971) documented these differences further by examining children’s eye movements during conservation tasks. They found that younger children who are unable to conserve or master the task correctly tend to fixate on a single dimension, such as the height of the liquid in a glass. Older children who are able to conserve show more varied eye movements, shifting their gaze over many parts of the testing display.\n\nApplying the idea of centration to the media, younger children are likely to respond strongly to a single feature in a television or movie scene, such as a character’s red dress or a hero’s shiny weapon. The prominence of the cues as well as the child’s own interests will help determine what is most salient. Other perceptual cues such as the character’s hair color, name, physical size, and even certain overt behaviors may go unnoticed. In emotional stories, for example, a character’s feelings are often conveyed through facial expressions as well as situational information in the plot. Younger children will be more likely to fixate on one or the other of these sets of cues, even when they conflict (Wiggers & van Lieshout, 1985). Thus, in some cases, we can expect that this centration will interfere with a young child’s comprehension of the storyline (see Figure 1.17).\n\n43\n\nFrom Perceived Appearance to Reality. Another important cognitive skill during childhood concerns the ability to distinguish fantasy from reality. Much to a parent’s amazement, a 3-year-old child may attribute life to an inanimate object such as a rock, have an invisible friend, and want Dora from Dora the Explorer to come over to the house for a play date. All of these tendencies reflect a fuzzy separation between what is real and what is not.\n\nNumerous studies have found strong developmental differences in children’s perceived reality of television (see Dorr, 1983; Wright, Huston, Reitz, & Piemyat, 1994). Younger children between the ages of 2 and 3 show little understanding of the boundary between television and the real world (Jaglom & Gardner, 1981). In fact, at this age, children routinely talk to the television set and wave at the characters (Noble, 1975). For example, in one study, many 3-year-olds reported that a bowl of popcorn shown on TV would spill if the television set were turned upside down (Flavell, Flavell, Green, & Korfmacher, 1990).\n\nBy around age 4, the young child begins to appreciate the representational nature of television but still tends to assume that anything that looks real is real (M. H. Brown, Skeen, & Osborn, 1979). This literal interpretation has been called the “magic window” perspective, reflecting the idea that young children naively assume that television provides a view of the real world. Gradually, children come to appreciate that some of what is shown on television is not real, although most of this centers first on perceptual cues. For example, 5- year-olds typically judge cartoons as not real because they feature physically impossible events and characters (Wright et al., 1994). In other words, the young child assesses content by looking for striking violations of physical reality (Dorr, 1983). It is important to note, though, that these emerging distinctions are initially quite fragile. Young children may be able to report that an animated character is “not real” yet still become quite frightened of it (Cantor, 1998). In one study (Woolley, Boerger, & Markman, 2004), preschoolers were introduced to a novel fantasy creature named the “Candy Witch,” and even 5-year-olds believed she was real and not “pretend,” particularly if the witch purportedly visited their homes at night and left candy. In a more recent study, 5-year-olds were just as willing to follow advice from a computer-generated TV character as from a live person, whereas 7- and 9-year-olds responded only to the person (Claxton & Ponto, 2013).\n\nFigure 1.17\n\nSOURCE: PEANUTS reprinted by permission of United Features Syndicate, Inc.\n\nAs children mature, they begin to use multiple criteria for judging reality in the media (Hawkins, 1977). Not only do they notice marked perceptual cues, but they also take into account the genre of the program, production cues, and even the purpose of the program. Most important, older children begin to judge content based on how similar it is to real life (M. H. Brown et al., 1979). Although they recognize that much of\n\n44\n\ntelevision is scripted, older children are likely to judge a scene or a program as realistic if it depicts characters\n\nand events that are possible in the real world (Dorr, 1983; Hawkins, 1977). In one survey, 28% of 2nd and 3rd graders and 47% of 6th graders spontaneously referred to “possibility” criteria in judging whether a series of characters and events on television were realistic (Dorr, 1983). In contrast, only 17% of kindergartners used this type of criteria. These trends are congruent with research on language comprehension, which suggests that the concept of possibility is not fully understood until around 8 years of age (Hoffner, Cantor, & Badzinski, 1990; Piaget & Inhelder, 1975).\n\nObviously, a child’s personal experiences will place a limit on how sophisticated these reality judgments can be. As an illustration, Weiss and Wilson (1998) found that elementary schoolers rated the TV sitcom Full House as very realistic, indicating on average that “most” to “all” real-life families are like the family featured in this program. These perceptions seem a bit naive given that the program was about a widowed father raising his three daughters with live-in help from his brother-in-law and his best friend.\n\nAdditionally, the nature of the media will have an impact. Computer games and other technologies that employ virtual reality can simulate the perceptual and social features of the real world. Interacting in such environments may tax a young person’s cognitive capacity, making it difficult even for an older child to distinguish fantasy from reality.\n\nFrom Concrete to Inferential Thinking. A final cognitive trend during childhood that has implications for the media is the shift from concrete to inferential thinking. As we have mentioned above, a young child’s thinking is very tangible, focusing closely on what can be seen and heard (Bruner, 1966). For a 2- or 3-year-old, this means that attention can be swayed by highly salient cues that may actually be extraneous to the plot (Schmitt et al., 1999). For example, a bright red costume may get more attention than the actions of the character who is wearing this garment.\n\nBy age 4, children can begin to focus more on information that is central to the plot than on incidental details (Lorch, Bellack, & Augsbach, 1987). Of course, younger children do best with age-appropriate content, programs that are relatively short in duration, and comprehension tests that assess forced-choice recognition rather than spontaneous recall (Campbell, Wright, & Huston, 1987). With development, children become increasingly able to extract events that are central to the storyline in a program (Collins, 1983; Durkin & Lowe, 1999). Yet the information younger children focus on is still likely to be fairly explicit in nature. For example, one study found that 4- and 6-year-olds most often recalled actions after watching televised stories, whereas adults most often recalled information about characters’ goals and motives (van den Broek, Lorch, & Thurlow, 1996). Actions are typically concrete and fairly vivid in television programming, making them easy to understand and represent in memory. Another study found that a majority of kindergartners thought an episode of Clifford the Big Red Dog was a story about dogs interacting, which meant they took the story quite literally (Mares & Acosta, 2008). At this young age, they missed the overarching moral lesson about social tolerance and inclusiveness. As discussed above, full comprehension involves apprehending not only explicit content but also implicit information in the unfolding narrative. For instance, in one scene, a protagonist might discover that a “friend” is trying to steal his money. In a later scene, the protagonist might hit the friend. The viewer must deduce that the protagonist’s aggression, which in isolation\n\n45\n\nmight appear unprovoked, is actually motivated by a desire to protect personal property. In other words, the viewer must link scenes together and draw causal inferences about content that is not explicitly presented. Studies show that older children are better able than their younger counterparts to draw different types of inferences from verbally presented passages (Ackerman, 1988; Pike, Barnes, & Barron, 2010). The same pattern emerges in the context of mediated messages. By roughly age 8 or 9, children show substantial improvements in their ability to link TV scenes together and draw connections between characters’ motives, behaviors, and consequences (Collins, Berndt, & Hess, 1974; Collins, Wellman, Keniston, & Westby, 1978; Kendeou, Bohn-Gettler, White, & van den Broek, 2008). This shift from concrete to inferential processing has implications for other forms of media as well. A video game and even a website require the user to make connections across space and time.\n\nTo summarize, a number of important cognitive shifts occur between early and middle childhood. A preschooler watching screen media is likely to focus on the most striking perceptual features in a program. This child may comprehend some of the plot, especially when the program is brief and age appropriate. Yet comprehension will be closely tied to concrete actions and behaviors in the storyline. In addition, the preschooler is likely to have difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy in the portrayals. As this same child enters elementary school, she will begin to focus more on conceptual aspects of the content such as the characters’ goals and motives. She increasingly will be able to link scenes together, drawing causal connections in the narrative. And her judgments of reality will become more accurate and discriminating as she compares media content with that which could possibly occur in the real world. Clearly, her overall understanding of a media message is quite advanced compared with what she was capable of as a preschooler. Nevertheless, her skills are continuing to develop even during her later elementary school years. Next we will explore some of the cognitive shifts that occur between late childhood and adolescence.\n\nOlder Children Versus Adolescents\n\nFrom Real to Plausible. As described above, older children use a variety of cues to judge the reality of media content. One of the most important yardsticks for them is whether the characters or events depicted in the media are possible in real life (Morison, Kelly, & Gardner, 1981). Adolescents become even more discriminating on this dimension, judging content as realistic if it is likely or probable in real life (Dorr, 1983; Morison et al., 1981). In Dorr’s (1983) research, almost half of adolescents defined real television events as those that were probable or plausible in real life. In contrast, probability rationales were seldom used by older elementary school children. To illustrate this distinction, a movie featuring an evil stepfather who is trying to poison his stepchildren may be very upsetting to a 9- or 10-year-old because this scenario could happen in real life. A teenager, on the other hand, is less likely to be disturbed by such content, reasoning that the vast majority of stepfathers in the world are not murderers. The movement to probabilistic thinking is consistent with studies of language comprehension that indicate that the ability to differentiate probability from possibility crystallizes during early adolescence (Piaget & Inhelder, 1975; Scholz & Waller, 1983).\n\nFrom Empirical to Hypothetical Reasoning. A related development that occurs between late childhood and early adolescence is the shift from empirical to hypothetical reasoning (Flavell et al., 2002). Adolescents become\n\n46\n\nincreasingly able to understand abstract concepts, use formal logic, and think hypothetically (Byrnes, 2003). Along with this abstract thinking comes an ability to engage in inductive and deductive reasoning (Keating, 2004) as well as conditional reasoning (Gauffroy & Barrouillet, 2011). An older child is able to reason conceptually too, but much of this process is based on collecting empirical evidence. A 5th or 6th grader, for example, may watch a person’s behavior across several situations and infer from these actions what the person’s motives are. In contrast, an adolescent might begin with a theory or hypothetical set of motives for a person and then observe behaviors to see if the theory is correct. In other words, the teenager is capable of more abstract thinking that need not be tied too closely to observable data.\n\nAdolescents are also increasingly capable of suspending their own beliefs to evaluate the reasoning of someone else (Moshman, 1998). Put another way, teens can sometimes reason about arguments at an objective level.\n\nThe ability to think hypothetically means that a teenager can anticipate different plot events and predict logical outcomes as a storyline unfolds. The teen is also able to critique the logic and causal structure of different media messages. As abstract thought flourishes, the adolescent may also consider the meaning behind the message (e.g., “Who is the source of this website, and why is it constructed this way? How would the content differ if it were designed by someone else with different motives?”).\n\nMetacognitive Thinking. Metacognition refers to the ability to understand and manipulate one’s own thought processes (Metcalfe & Shimamura, 1994). It is called metacognition because it refers to second-order mental activities: A person thinks about his or her own thinking. Adults routinely reflect on their own cognitive processing, especially during situations that highlight the need to do so. For instance, studying for a test or actually taking one requires a person to concentrate carefully on cognitive enterprises such as attention, comprehension, and memory.\n\nFlavell and his colleagues (2002) have distinguished between two types of metacognition: metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive monitoring and self-regulation. Metacognitive knowledge refers to a person’s knowledge and beliefs about the human mind and how it works. For example, most adults realize that short- term memory is of limited capacity (see section below on processing capacity), that it is generally easier to recognize something when you see it than to recall it outright, and that certain tasks are more difficult and demanding of the human mind than others. But young children do not necessarily possess such metacognitive knowledge. In one study, for example, Lovett and Flavell (1990) presented 1st graders, 3rd graders, and undergraduates with three tasks: a list of words to be memorized, a list of words to match up with a picture, and a list of words to memorize and match. Unlike the 1st graders, the 3rd graders and the undergraduates were able to select which strategy—rehearsal, word definition, or both—would work best for each task. Yet only the undergraduates understood that the tasks would be more difficult with longer lists and unfamiliar words. Thus, as children develop, they become increasingly aware that the mind engages in a range of activities, including memory, comprehension, and inference (Flavell et al., 2002).\n\nThe second type of metacognition involves monitoring and readjusting one’s ongoing thinking. Consider the test taking instance, for example. An adult who is having difficulty with a certain section on a test might decide to jump ahead to an easier part for efficiency’s sake and to build confidence before returning to the\n\n47\n\nharder material. Research suggests that this type of self-monitoring is difficult during early childhood (see Flavell et al., 2002). In one study, preschoolers and elementary schoolers were instructed to examine a set of objects until they were sure they could recall them (Flavell, Friedrichs, & Hoyt, 1970). Older children examined the objects for a period of time, determined they were ready, and typically recalled all the items correctly. In contrast, the preschoolers examined the items, thought they were ready, and generally failed on the recall test. In other words, the preschoolers were not capable of monitoring their memory processes very accurately.\n\nHow do metacognitive knowledge and monitoring relate to the media? We can expect that as children approach adolescence, they will be better able to analyze the cognitive demands of different media and even different messages within a particular medium. According to Salomon (1983), some media require more nonautomatic mental elaborations or more AIME (amount of invested mental effort) than others. In general, television requires less effort and concentration than reading, for example, because the former is highly visual and relies less on language skills (Salomon & Leigh, 1984). Thus, a teenager is more likely than a young child to recognize that a difficult book or a television documentary requires higher concentration than watching a music video. Their awareness of different media will affect the depth of processing they use, which in turn should enhance comprehension and learning. Interestingly, when children are instructed to pay attention to and learn from TV, their mental effort and performance increase compared to what they do without such instruction (Salomon, 1983).\n\nNevertheless, the trend toward multitasking with media may make it difficult for even the most sophisticated teen to recognize the cognitive overload in such situations (see Cantor, 2009). Recent research indicates that people experience substantial declines in performance when they try to do more than one thing at a time (Bowman, Levine, Waite, & Gendron, 2010). For example, driving performance suffers when people simultaneously text on their cell phones (Owens, McLaughlin, & Sudweeks, 2011). Despite their metacognitive abilities, teens and young adults alike are fairly naive about how well they can study for an exam while monitoring Facebook, texting on their phones, and listening to music all at the same time.\n\nLast, as children reach the teenage years, they should increasingly be able to monitor their own affective reactions to the media, for example, avoiding classical music they do not like or reminding themselves that “it’s only a movie” when they feel scared. In one illustration of this, preschoolers and 9- to 11-year-olds were given different types of instructions on how to think about a frightening program they were about to watch on television (Cantor & Wilson, 1984). Children were told either to imagine themselves as the protagonist (role taking set) or to remember that the story and the characters were make-believe (unreality set). The cognitive- set instructions had no appreciable effect on the preschoolers’ emotional reactions to the program. In other words, they showed little ability to use the information to alter how they perceived the program. In contrast, older children in the role taking condition were more frightened by the program, and those in the unreality condition were less frightened, compared with a control group that received no instructions at all (see Figure 1.18). The findings are consistent with the idea that as children develop, they are increasingly able to modify their thought processes while watching television.\n\nRegulatory Competence. Adults have long assumed that much of cognitive growth occurs during the childhood\n\n48\n\nyears. Recent research on the brain contradicts this view. With better measurement tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we are beginning to realize that there are substantial changes in brain development during adolescence (Spear, 2010). Much of this development occurs in the prefrontal cortex region of the brain, which is crucial to the regulation of behavior and emotion (Sowell, Trauner, Gamst, & Jernigan, 2002). Until this area of the brain is fully developed, which may not occur until the mid-20s, young people often have difficulty regulating and controlling their moods and responses to different situations. This development of an “executive suite” or executive function is receiving considerable attention these days (Steinberg, 2005), in part because it s"
