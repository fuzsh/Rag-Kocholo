        "text": "It would be a pity, however, if his heroic and heartrending situation obscured Reeve's acting achievements. After all, he appeared in 17 feature films, a dozen television movies and about 150 plays.\n\nReeve was born into an intellectual family in New York; his father, F.D. Reeve, is a noted novelist, poet and scholar of Russian literature; his mother, the journalist Barbara Johnson. He enjoyed a stimulating childhood environment that included Sunday dinners with the poets Robert Frost and Robert Penn Warren, and the politician and academic Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n\nThe atmosphere was such that Reeve's father was disappointed to learn that the role of Superman his son had been offered was not one in the George Bernard Shaw play, Man and Superman.\n\nReeve started acting while a pupil at the exclusive Princeton day school. \"I never once asked myself, 'Who am I?' or 'What am I doing?\"' he recalled. \"Right from the beginning, the theatre was like home to me. It seemed to be what I did best. I never doubted that I belonged in it.\" After high school he toured the country as Celeste Holm's leading man in The Irregular Verb To Love.\n\nAt Cornell University he majored in music theory and English. He then studied theatre in Britain and France. In London, he worked at the Old Vic. \"I was a glorified errand boy, but it was a very exciting time. I helped by teaching the British actors to speak with an American accent.\"\n\nIn lieu of his final year at Cornell, Reeve was one of two students (Robin Williams was the other) accepted at the Juilliard School of Performing Arts, New York. There, he studied under the celebrated John Houseman, supporting himself financially with a role in the long-running television soap, Love of Life. His looks and his athletic, 1.93-metre frame made him perfect material for a soap opera hero.\n\nIn 1976 he won the coveted role of Katharine Hepburn's grandson in a Broadway production of Enid Bagnold's A Matter of Gravity. The same year, he got a small part in Gray Lady Down, a submarine adventure film.\n\nIt was while appearing in an off-Broadway production that Reeve successfully screen-tested for the 1978 movie Superman - the most inspired casting of an unknown in a series since Sean Connery's James Bond. Reeve portrayed Superman as \"somebody that you can invite home for dinner ... What makes [him] a hero is not that he has power, but that he has the wisdom and the maturity to use the power wisely.\"\n\nOf playing Clark Kent, Superman's alter ego, Reeve reckoned that \"there must be some difference stylistically between Clark and Superman. Otherwise, you just have a pair of glasses standing in for a character.\" Though he played the two roles without any sign of camp, he revealed a deft, Cary Grant-inspired comic timing.\n\nUnfortunately, the three sequel films were a matter of diminishing returns and, after Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), Reeve determined to \"escape the cape\". As he explained, \"I've flown, become evil, loved, stopped and turned the world backward. I've faced my peers, befriended children and small animals and rescued cats from trees. What else is there left for Superman to do?\"\n\nAway from his role as the man of steel, he portrayed a wide range of characters in films that included the love fantasy Somewhere in Time (1980); the thriller Deathtrap (1982); Monsignor (1982), where, in the title role, he wore a cape again; and two Merchant-Ivory period pieces, The Bostonians (1984) and The Remains of the Day (1993).\n\nHe also showed his ability at farce in Switching Channels (1988) and Noises Off (1992). Further proof of his versatility came on stage in The Aspern Papers, in London with Vanessa Redgrave and Wendy Hiller, Beaumarchais' The Marriage Of Figaro in New York, and Tennessee Williams's Summer and Smoke in Los Angeles, as well as on tour in Love Letters.\n\nBefore his accident, Reeve seemed to have everything. He was an accomplished pianist and a superb athlete. He twice flew solo across the Atlantic and also flew gliders. He was an expert sailor, scuba diver and skier, though horses were his great passion. He returned to acting in 1998, in a TV movie update of Hitchcock's Rear Window, which, though a remarkable feat, was treated as a freak show.\n\nHe is survived by his parents; by his wife Dana Morosini, whom he married in 1992, and their son; and by a son and daughter from an earlier long relationship with modelling executive Gae Exton.\n\nRonald Bergan\n\nChristopher Reed writes:\n\nChristopher Reeve's nine-year campaign for medical research into paralysis brought encouragement to millions worldwide, and he even forecast that he would walk again one day. His fame and personal efforts - such as a surprise appearance at the 1996 Oscars ceremony in his wheelchair - substantially boosted money for research.\n\nUnder the slogan \"Stand up for those who can't\", his Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, which, in 1999, merged with the American Paralysis Association, gave away millions of dollars to fund research and improve the quality of life for people suffering such injuries.\n\nLast July the foundation announced a grant of $US779,000 ($1.07 million) to 126 non-profit organisations as part of its annual donations to help sufferers. When the program began in 1999, only 20 groups benefited. Last May, the foundation donated $US2 million for individual research initiatives in Israel, a world leader in the field of paralysis injuries.\n\nProfessor Geoff Raisman, director of the spinal repair unit at University College, London, had been due to visit Reeve in December to discuss his work. Raisman and his team hope to start human trials in the next three years to help restore movement to people severely disabled like Reeve, using cells from the nasal cavity."
