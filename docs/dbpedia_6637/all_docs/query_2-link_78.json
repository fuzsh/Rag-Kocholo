Antonia Bennett has a rich musical heritage and a distinctive voice that The New York Times describes as “Billie Holiday meets Diana Krall.”\n\nShe performs music from the Great American Songbook and her original works. Growing up in Los Angeles, she was surrounded by some of the greatest vocalists of all time, including Rosemary Clooney, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra.\n\nHer passion for music led her to study at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\nAntonia’s career took off in New York City, where she started performing as her father’s opening act in renowned venues like Radio City Music Hall, the Hollywood Bowl, the Newport Jazz Festival, and the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nIn 2008, she recorded “I’ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm” with her father and released her own critically acclaimed EP, “Natural,” in 2010.\n\nHer debut album, “Embrace Me,” featured ten standards from the Great American Songbook.\n\nAnne Marie Chastain, the Executive Director of the Carmel Symphony Orchestra, expressed her excitement about the collaboration and the significance of the event.\n\nShe highlighted the orchestra’s dedication to bringing high-quality musical experiences to the community and the importance of celebrating jazz legends.\n\nFor more information about the Carmel Jazz Festival and to purchase tickets, visit the festival’s website."
