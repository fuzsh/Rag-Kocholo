HEADS and teachers of Catholic primary schools in Kampala Archdiocese are worried by the massive exodus of the faithful to born-again churches.

The teachers raised the concern during a religious education meeting at Pope Paul Memorial Community Centre in Kampala recently.

They said people were leaving for born-again churches because of the miracles performed there yet the Catholic Church performs miracles too.

Others attributed the exodus to the money and food which the born-again churches entice the believers with.

They said children were getting saved due to lack of knowledge of the Catholic Church history.

They urged parents to teach their children to love Catholicism.
