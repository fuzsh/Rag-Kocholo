        "text": "A massive crowd of devout Buganda Kingdom loyalists turned up on yesterday to join Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II celebrate his 63rd birthday.\n\nThis event (Kabaka’s birthday) which is celebrated annually attracted thousands of his subjects who who lined up along Kampala-Masaka highway dancing, drumming and singing Buganda kingdom praise songs.\n\nSimilar events like these can be enjoyed when you choose to travel with Saso Uganda Safaris. They offer packages such as;\n\n4 Days Chimps & Gorilla Trekking\n\n5 Days Bwindi Forest & Queen Elizabeth\n\n6 Days Lake Mburo, QENP & Murchison\n\n7 Days Mburo, Bwindi, Bunyonyi & QENP\n\n11 Days Murchison, Kibale, QENP, Bwindi, Mburo & Bunyonyi Long Safari\n\n15 Days Uganda – Rwanda Epedition Safari\n\n18 Days Great Uganda Safari Tour\n\n20 Days Best if Uganda Adventure Safari\n\nAfter entering Masaka, the Kabaka made several stop overs at Lukaya, Mukoko, Butende, Nyendo, Kyabakuza among other towns where his subjects had gathered. In some areas, he had to disembark his car, move on foot waving at people amid pomp.\n\nAt Buddu-Mawokota (Kalungu-Mpigi) boarder, the Kabaka was received by the third deputy Katikkiro in the Buganda Kingdom, Apollo Makubuya and the kingdom’s Minister for Culture, Heritage, Royal Tombs and Tourism, Denis Walusimbi Ssengendo.\n\nThe Kabaka reached Villa Maria at 10am, planted a memorial tree at the venue before going for a guided tour around the church which is said to be one of the oldest in Uganda.\n\nAfter the tour, the Masaka diocesan bishop John Baptist Kaggwa led the congregation in a Mass after which the Kabaka gave a speech and later served his subjects a birthday cake which climaxed the week- long celebrations (Kabaka’s birthday) that begun with Kabaka’s Birthday Run last Sunday in Kampala and other towns in Uganda and diaspora.\n\nKabaka Mutebi was born on April 13, 1955 to Kabaka Edward Fredrick Muteesa II and Nabakyala Sarah Nalule at Mulago Hospital and spent his early years in Mengo palace. He was later taken to Masaka and the UK in 1967 when President Obote abolished the kingdoms.\n\nHe stayed in the diaspora until his father’s remains were returned for burial in 1972.\n\nKabaka Mutebi attended school at North Polytechnic, Bradfield College and Cambridge University. He once practiced journalism and marketing between 1970 and 1980.\n\nOn July 31, 1993 when the kingdoms were reinstated by NRM government under President Museveni, Mutebi was consecrated as King.\n\nOn August 27, 1997, he got married to Sylvia Nagginda."
