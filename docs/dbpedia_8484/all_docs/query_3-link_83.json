        "text": "There was nothing miraculous about Moses' birth. His mother conceived in the usual fashion. The only comment about Moses is made in Ex 2:2 -\n\nand she conceived and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a beautiful child, she hid him for three months.\n\nThe premise for this hiding for 3 month was because of the royal decree that all male children must be drowned by throwing them in the Nile river (Ex 1:28).\n\nThe subtlety in the story is that Moses' mother decided to comply with this requirement with a twist (a \"set-up\") aimed at achieving the opposite effect of the royal decree's intention, to save the baby's life by tugging at the heart-strings (Ex 2:6) of pharaoh's daughter, who apparently had no children.\n\n[Side note: Whatever chronology one uses for the dating the story of Moses, archeology tells us that the Egyptian royal families were incestuous, and as a result, did not live long because of delicate health and numerous diseases. Further, infertility of royal women was also common. By contrast, the Hebrew women were \"vigorous\" (Ex 1:19) and lived longer and healthier lives and reproduced readily and copiously. Thus, a Hebrew child would have been desirable as an Egyptian adoptive.]\n\nThus it was by the cunning of Jocabed that Moses' life was saved as follows:\n\nMoses was \"thrown\" in the Nile, but with a little boat to prevent him drowning\n\nthe place where Moses was placed in the river was deliberately near where pharaoh's daughter bathed\n\nthe thinly disguised ruse (which the princess almost certainly understood immediately) was designed to have Moses adopted by the princess\n\nthe services of a wet nurse were offered by the near-by and watching Miriam. Again, this was a pretense which the princes would have understood to maintain a fig-leaf of credibility and respectability.\n\nThus, while this was a cunning ruse, I do not believe for a moment that the princess was deceived - she must have known what was going on but played along for her own benefit - she recognized the child as a Hebrew child! (Heb 2:6.) [Again, archeological records show that because of the endemic fertility problems in Egyptian families (due to poor health and incest) adoption was common.]\n\nLastly, the princess even named the child, \"Moses\" which is probably a reference to her \"drawing out\" the child from the river Nile. That is, the name was Hebrew in sound but Egyptian in origin and had a royal \"ring\" to it. [\"Moses\" or a slight variation was contained in many of the pharaoh's names, such as Ahmose, Kahmose, Ramases, Thutmose, etc, etc.]\n\nNotes about \"Ruses\"\n\nGenerally, we may classify a ruse as either:\n\ndeceptive - a ruse that is designed to deceive and gain a personal advantage, is clearly immoral and unethical and invariably damaging.\n\n\"harmless\"; while any ruse is by its very nature deceptive to some extent, these latter types are do not necessarily cause harm but are often used to minimize or eliminate harm. See the appendix below.\n\nThe ruse of Moses' mother to protect his life by saving him from the king's decree, was clearly designed in such a way as not to cause any harm, but to prevent it. Further, very little, if any, deception was involved because the princess must have been fully aware of what was going on but played along with the \"game\" to save the baby Moses' life.\n\nWhether this ruse was divine directed as in the case of the prophet Samuel (1 Sam 16:1-3), we are not told; however, the tenor and importance of the story makes it appear that it was at least part of God's providence.\n\nAPPENDIX - Lying\n\nLying, or spreading what is untrue, or bearing false witness, are acts forbidden by the ninth commandment (Ex 20:16) and many other places (Lev 19:11, Ps 34:13, 58:3, 101:7, 109:2, Prov 6:16-19, 12:19, 14:5, 19:5, 9, 21:6, 24:28, Matt 15:18-20, 1 Cor 6:9-11, Eph 4:25, Col 3:9, 10, Rev 21:8, etc.) However, there were times when an ethical dilemma arises where lying was the lesser of two evils.\n\nJeremiah – Jer 38:24-27\n\nJericho spies – Josh 2:1 (spying, by nature, is an enacted lie.)\n\nRahab of Jericho – Josh 2:2-7\n\nSamuel – 1 Sam 16:1-3\n\nHushai the Arkite – 2 Sam 15:32-37, 16:15-19\n\nWoman at Bahurim – 2 Sam 17:17-20\n\nMichal protecting David – 1 Sam 19:11-17\n\nDavid – 1 Sam 21:1-9, 12-15\n\nProphet – 1 Kings 13:18\n\nJehu – 2 Kings 10:10, 19, 30\n\nThe fact that some lied in order to protect life clearly says that life had, in some cases, a greater value than truth."
