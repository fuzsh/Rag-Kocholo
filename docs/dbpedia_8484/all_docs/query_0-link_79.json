        "text": "We were dreamers, dreaming greatly, in the man-stifled town —\n\nWe yearned before the skylines where the strange roads go down…\n\nSix a.m.\n\nThe news greeted us last evening. We weren’t so bothered though. We’ve heard of the increment of fares before. Upon the mere change in weather and seasons, even. Christmas and Easter are tantamount to doubling the usual fares, and both the beginning and the end of school holidays leave us begging the taxi operators and drivers for shreds of their mercy that has never been granted. We always travel anyway. We’re becoming as adapted to the changing weather of fares as we are endowed with genetic polymorphisms, perhaps.\n\nWas it an increment of two hundred shillings? Knowing the new figures surely won’t salvage my worrying about how I’ll travel today but we all dread that whether the price of a litre of diesel increased by six per cent, or less, it still could amount to a fifty per cent increment in the current fares.\n\nI’m still debating the possibilities to trail yesterday’s radio-news when a buzz from my phone interjects. I flay the rheum from the corners of my eyes and inspect the palatability of the accompanying news. A notification, saying a deposit just happened on my mobile money account — now to me, not a mere deposit transaction but the very promise of eternal prosperity. I’m all praises for my Brother Paul’s magnanimity. Blood is thicker than water — thanks to providence, the ancient philosophy is still binding on us.\n\nThat the ten thousand shillings grant from Paul will savour the expenditures of lunch, fare and other unnumbered utilities is as indubitable as the money’s steep insufficiency — but enough to reduce my wretched heart to a foolish smile.\n\nSix thirty a.m.\n\nMy teeth clatter involuntarily. I know I wasn’t chewing, and that’s how I know, even before my eyelids pop open, that the taxi I boarded has just reached the ruggedness at the bus stop in Kitintale. I slide my hand to feel for the copy of a choice of Kipling’s verse — I ought to be reading — and what I feel isn’t a book’s skin but human skin, my fingers greeting one another.\n\nMy heart skips beats when I stoop beneath my knees and notice in our taxi’s base a crack through which I see the taxi’s drift over the very tarmac we’re treading. I am left in wonderment of both how my book missed going through the hole and when the sweaty man seated beside me came in. How the arrival of his stench failed to wake me up upends my reason.\n\nThe pretention of finding my last-read is punctuated by another impromptu jerk. At first, I think the wheel has strayed, lodged into a manhole, but memory beckons my reason, and I needn’t look back to know that we’re in Bugolobi — just after the junction. Nowhere else on Port Bell Road do potholes seat in the middle of the road, enthroned like kings, ruling our daily commute like dictators.\n\n“Naye duleeva, stop driving us like we’re bags of popcorn,” a man with a hoarse voice roars from one of the front row seats as though he’d been gathering all our silent grievances.\n\nAnd so does it turn out to be true when the passengers seated in front accuse the entire cohort of taxi-drivers and conductors of failing to limit their consumption of weed and waragi. But shall we blame the toll of torments we’ve endured on these roads only on the drivers’ tipsiness or on our sitting in the most shrieking of taxis?\n\nSix p.m.\n\nThe squalling of wind, the whirling of dust and leaves puffs the feel of war into the air and a ghostly dark-murkiness hovers angrily above City Square — the same way it appears in the paintings of Apocalypse.\n\nKampala knows not of Apocalypse. She laughs off the thought of apocalypse ever happening in a teething city in the heart of Africa.\n\nApocalypse is as far from us as a brazen promise of rain on the moon. Apocalypse can only happen in big cities like New York, Kampala seems to declare silently. But whether Kampala says it or not, we all know that we are so still in Exodus to think of Apocalypse.\n\nCumulonimbus clouds are responsible for thunderstorms. But these thunderstorms over Old Kampala Hill are not akin to those once on Mount Sinai. Cumulonimbus clouds are also the announcement of the conquering-fall of a heavy downpour to quench the thirsty-dryness trite in January, an imminent rise of the ferric scent of petrichor, the smell of our Exodus.\n\nThis is our Exodus — the masses still moving from dusty roads, age-old infrastructure and patches of tarmac, moving to our promised land. For months, the news has been flying from mouth to mouth. Better roads, free from the plough of age, poverty and corruption, and what I heard the boda-boda cyclist call esi-gi-ala. I suppose he meant SGR — The Standard Gauge Railway which has failed to be conceived in the country’s womb.\n\nThe Expressway is now a story about to fall into desuetude. They say it’s waiting to be commissioned by the president himself. But until then, we’ll live on its promise to wade off the traffic congestion that accompanies every visit of dusk along Entebbe-Kampala highway. At least we’ll live on the hope to decongest Kampala’s traffic. After all, hope never disappoints. We’re still feeding on our stacks of hope — to get rid of the changing weather of transport fares and traffic congestion.\n\nA rain drop draws a fake tear on my face and I realize it’s insinuating the tear my right eye hoarded as I squinted my way to Old Taxi Park through the dust that’s dancing like a league of demons.\n\nOld is Gold, the broke-man’s gold. Old Taxi Park has the cheapest fares for whoever fate has kept far away from the lucky mustering driving back home through the smell of wealth and the smoothest tarmac in suburbs like Kololo and Nakasero. When more of the fake teardrops turn into showers, we rehearse to waddle like ducks through the daub.\n\nSeven p.m.\n\nThe rain resigns and I muse at the illusion that it had freed the streets from every single human soul. The swarm I’m lost in now has only grown bigger, barely draining dry like the water that was running in the rills to the down-warped Old Taxi Park.\n\nWhen the hawker weighing his merchandise abaft mutters, “Jam ekutte”, I pause and clutch into my pockets to ascertain my readiness to pay twice the fare I would pay on a dissimilar, rainless evening.\n\nOn Friday evening, only the aggression of the home-craving, retiring worker in Kampala can win a squeezing space in a taxi, and that’s why on such an occasion, I have learnt the need to gather more than my usual strength so as to weave through the dins at the door of every taxi heading to Entebbe.\n\nMore than relieved to be part of the small-horde that fidgeted for entrance into one of such taxis, I cling tenaciously in the hind seat, wishing that patience were a free commodity in fronds of abundance like the swarming human species now roaming the semi-darkness brooding over downtown.\n\nThe inside of the taxi is filled with a rotten silence. There’s surely no sound, no echo of sound, in the deserts of deep but here in the womb of the world — here on the tie-ribs of earth, words and words of men flicker and flutter and beat.\n\nIt’s quite hard to believe that the silence, I’m trying to acclimatize to, harbours the same sojourners. The once bolting horses are now wounded colts.\n\nIt’s been a rainy evening and it seems every animal odour imaginable is aiming at the nostrils’ recognition. The dampness of the air in here reminds me of the moorland there was once in Bwaise before swamp reclamation gave way to the floods that have haunted the generation. A seasonal creek doesn’t forget where it once flowed, our people say.\n\nI sniff out — not sure whether I’m breathing well or not breathing at all — but the closest we’re to moving, after half an hour, is the taxi’s hopping around like a toad in the mud pools birthed from the potholes in Old Taxi Park. Two ladies seated just in front of me break the silence with what I think is a rather exaggerated laughter.\n\nWhile I am still bewildered by how Ugandans afford laughter in such discomfort, the man I now call my neighbour begins to sing along The Ghetto President’s song playing in one of the shops. I’m overcome when he goes mute. Perhaps he’s learned that his chanting isn’t welcome as his shoes fuming with hydrogen sulphide. But that’s the way we live and that’s the way we die — in the sufferance against what we think is disgrace.\n\nA whistle blow from the traffic officer should suggest release of the traffic lane but it literally commands the lumbering and frog-jumping of these aged wagons — barely enough to speak that the drivers’ patience has already been churned into impatience.\n\nI look out and see the same fronds of people, streaming like a shoal in a drying creek, still looking for home. The streams of taxis are hardly moving. The lanes are coiling like my intestinal tract before pulling out with an angry inertia.\n\nThere’s a transient relief from the damp inside here when a cool flow of air whistles through the windscreens but a more dominant wave of exhaust-fumes conquers it. It’s a lie to think about relief at Clock Tower round about.\n\nI am tempted to scroll through twitter news feeds when my neighbour growls some counsel — against the naivety of my decision. I am just headstrong for smart phones flying from passengers’ hands at these very traffic lights before getting beclouded eternally in the throngs on the pavements is not a fable I heard only yesterday.\n\nThey say “Kifeesi” rules this place, and that their authority is more fortified than the brutality of the Police will ever be. Haven’t the police been branded as working for Kifeesi? It may be the mere allegation of media reports that say but the prudence of life is, “if you can’t beat them, join them.” So, who joined who? Whether police joined Kifeesi or Kifeesi joined police, Clock Tower is still not safe a place for texting your girlfriend or stalking the posts of your girl-crush. It’s much better to venture into closing the windscreen and suffer the foul of the air inside here.\n\nI’m bothered by the way the mob herein, the hind quarters, is throwing accusing red eyes towards me until one of the ladies points at it — the fattest of bedbugs I have ever seen. It was creeping on my shirt!\n\nI am glad to know they weren’t blaming me of breeding the infestation we all found here when she jests, “I think the taxi driver should give us discount for feeding his bedbugs.”\n\nI am somewhat amused, at first, until my neighbour yawns. My inside riots and nausea is called to my throat, the fact that I’m hungry and fatigued notwithstanding. But what I really do care about is that, finally, I am going back home."
