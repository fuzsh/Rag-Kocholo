        "text": "Gospel singer George Lubega Timothy commonly known as Exodus confessed that he relapsed from being a staunch Born-Again Christian and turned into a drunkard.\n\nWhile kneeling as he was performing at Pastor Bugembe’s “Katonda Wabanaku Mweno Ensonga” concert Exodus admitted with tears rolling that he took the wrong path by drinking alcohol which tarnished his name as a Christian.\n\nHowever he noted that currently he stopped to drink, he went ahead and vowed to change and again serve God rightly adding that he will even visit most churches around Kampala apologizing for everything that was uttered about him whether false or right.\n\nPastor Bugembe’s “Katonda Wabanaku Mweno Ensonga” took place on Friday 3rd June 2022 at Hotel Africana and it was a successful one after his fans turning up in large numbers.\n\nBy 3;00 pm, the venue was full , Performances from several artists such as Bebe Cool, Spice Diana, Exodus, Levixone, Nina Roz, among others made the show remarkable .\n\nPastor Bugembe also killed his fans with enjoyment as he dropped his hit songs for the past fifteen years.\n\nMeanwhile Bugembe declared that profits from the concert were to help in completing the construction of his Worship House Church in Nansana."
