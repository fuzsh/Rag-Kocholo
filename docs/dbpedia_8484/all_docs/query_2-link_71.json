        "text": "The year that changed me: In this series, writers reflect on what 2022 taught them; lessons learned from a transformative moment in their lives\n\nExactly 50 years ago, on a cold winter’s day in 1972, my father arrived in the UK from Uganda. He was 12 years old. Uganda was the only country he had ever known – it was where he was born, where his family were, and where he imagined he would spend the rest of his life. But when dictator Idi Amin announced that he was expelling all Asians from Uganda, my father and his family were forced to leave their home to come to England. Specifically, north London.\n\nThis is a story I’ve known my whole life. Both my parents were born in Uganda, though my mother’s family went to India before Amin’s edict, eventually coming to the UK just after my father. It’s part of my family history, and I’ve grown up listening to my parents reminisce about how wonderful life in Uganda was, casually referencing wild cheetahs, leopards and elephants while I looked at my pet rabbit in its hutch.\n\nI’ve wanted to go to Uganda ever since, but neither of my parents have wanted to return. They’re both deeply curious to see their former homes, but as my dad says: “I don’t want to ruin my memories. Besides, it would be too painful.” For years, I’ve been waiting for them to change their minds, but this year, I realised I didn’t have to wait anymore; I could go alone.\n\nI booked a tour from Kenya to Uganda that included safari, hiking to see mountain gorillas, and most importantly, visiting Jinja – the city that both my parents lived in. I had no idea what to expect. Both my parents were nervous for me. Suddenly, they stopped recounting idyllic memories, instead referencing thefts, attacks, and worse. But I knew I had to do this – and the fact it was the 50th anniversary made me even more determined.\n\nThe second that our vehicle crossed over the border into Uganda, I cried. I was finally in this country my parents used to call home. I told the immigration officers why I was there, and their faces instantly transformed from sternly intimidating to openly welcoming. “You’re Ugandan, then!” they cried out. “Welcome!”\n\nThat turned out to be no anomaly. I didn’t think local Ugandans would particularly care about a 32-year-old British Indian woman visiting their country because her parents were born there 60-odd years ago, but they did. Everyone wanted to know my story, and the second I mentioned 1972, their faces changed. I realised that what I’d always seen as a trauma for the Ugandan Asians who had to leave was just as much a trauma for the Ugandans who stayed behind.\n\nLike my parents, they too were trying to move on from a painful past, and they all expressed regret it had ever been allowed to happen.\n\nThat’s when I realised my family was still holding onto this wound, but I didn’t have to. I could let go of my family history, and create my own relationship with this country. I could heal our past, and make my own memories here. So that’s exactly what I did. I walked the streets of my parents’ childhoods in Jinja, sending them photos of their former roads, houses and schools. I was welcomed into their primary schools, with teachers proudly showing me what remained from the 60s, when my parents were living there, and just how much had changed.\n\nI sent my parents photos and videos, watching how it healed them too. Even the fact that their daughter was being welcomed into a country that had rejected them was symbolic, let alone the fact I was now walking in their footsteps. “It’s bringing up a lot of emotions,” said my dad, in what might be the first time he’s ever used the word “emotions”. He also shared recollections, long buried, of public violence and brutality, interspersed with funny anecdotes about taking mangoes from the market.\n\nWhen I sent my mum a selfie outside her old house, she told me I was standing on the exact green she used to play cricket on as a child. I felt a shiver when I read that message. And then I felt pride – she grew up in a world so different to the one she brought me up in. It was the same for my dad, and yet both of them made England home, and gave me and my brother so much.\n\nI’m still the first person in our family to visit Uganda since 1972, and I’m so glad that I did. The trip has changed me. It’s not just seeing where my parents came from and getting to know them on a deeper level; it’s about me exploring my own origins.\n\nAs I walked through Jinja alone, and stood by the source of the River Nile, I felt an unexpected sense of belonging. I realised that if it wasn’t for Idi Amin, I would have been born in Uganda. My life would have played out here, in this country awash with colour, heat, sound and life. I have never lived in Uganda, but it’s still a part of my history, my life and my story.\n\nBy the time I got on the plane home on 21 November, 2022, I felt full. I messaged my parents to tell them. My dad replied telling me that he’d left Uganda on 21 November, 1972. I laughed out loud. I’d had no idea of this when I’d planned my trip, but now that I knew, it felt so right. I was rewriting my family history, letting go of my parents’ past to create my own present."
