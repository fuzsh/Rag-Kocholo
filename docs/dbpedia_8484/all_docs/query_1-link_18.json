        "meta_description": "George Lubega Timothy (born 8 June 1984) is a Ugandan singer known by his stage name Exodus. He made his musical debut in 2004 with his hit single 'Ganja Man'. Raised by a single mother, he met Pastor Kayanja in 2002, who enlisted him in his church, where he became choir leader two years later. In 2004 Isaac Rucibigango (Rucci) recruited Exodus and two others, Bahati Nsereko and Kenneth Tusubira, to form the Sauti band that toured the Great Lakes region. He toured Tanzania, Rwanda and Kenya. While in Kenya in 2007, he left Sauti. In 2008, he released his first song 'Ganja man'. The song later became very big and it took over Uganda and beyond. He followed that single with 'Addicted', 'I am Walking' and his biggest hit yet, 'Igwe'. He is now working on his first 12-track album. With only four songs under his belt, Exodus has been nominated for, and won more awards than many musicians who have been in the field much longer. In 2009, He was nominated for an MTV Africa Music Awards and won four Buzz teen awards. He has also won the Groove awards based in Nairobi, Pearl of Africa Music Awards; won two Olive gospel awards and was nominated in the All Africa Gospel Music awards in London as one of Africa's best gospel artistes. Exodus works as the Artistic Director and Peace Ambassador of the Irene Gleeson Foundation (IGF) based in Northern Uganda.",
