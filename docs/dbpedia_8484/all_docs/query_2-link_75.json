        "text": "1. Establishment of the National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA)\n\nThe US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016 for Uganda notes that the National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA) was established in 2015, and \"is responsible for registering all persons in the country for the purpose of national identification\" (US 3 Mar. 2017, 30). An article in the Daily Monitor, a newspaper based in Uganda, reports that NIRA was established as an independent authority under the Ministry of Internal Affairs by the Registration of Persons Act, 2015 (The Daily Monitor 6 Jan. 2016). The same source indicates that prior to the establishment of NIRA, the role of registering births and deaths \"was carried out by Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB) under the Births and Deaths Registration Act\" (The Daily Monitor 6 Jan. 2016). A joint press release from the URSB and NIRA similarly notes that NIRA was established by the Registration of Persons Act, 2015, which \"repeals the existing Births and Deaths Registration Act and transfers the [b]irths and [d]eaths registration function from [URSB] to [NIRA]\" (Uganda 29 Dec. 2015). The press release further notes that \"[w]ith effect from January 01, 2016, NIRA will take over the mandate of registration of [b]irths, [d]eaths and [a]doption orders from URSB\" (Uganda 29 Dec. 2015, bold in original).\n\nThe NIRA website describes its mandate as follows:\n\nTo create, manage, maintain and [operationalize] the National Identification Register by\n\nRegistering all citizens of Uganda;\n\nRegistering non-citizens of Uganda who are lawfully residents in Uganda;\n\nRegistering births and deaths[;]\n\nAssigning a unique National Identification Number to every person registered[;]\n\nIssuing National Identification Cards and Aliens’ Identification Cards to all registered persons. (Uganda n.d.a)\n\n2. Requirements and Procedures to Obtain a Birth Certificate\n\n2.1 Birth Registration\n\nSection 32 of the Registration of Persons Act, 2015 provides the following:\n\n32. Mode of registration of births.\n\nA person giving notice of the birth of a child shall give the prescribed particulars, which shall be entered forthwith by the registration officer in the register, and the person notifying the birth shall certify to the correctness of the entry by signing or by affixing a mark to the register.\n\nThe registration officer shall before entering any information in the register, ensure that a person giving notice under subsection (1) provides the following particulars—\n\nin respect of a birth; the name, sex, date, disability if any weight at birth [sic], place and district of birth;\n\nin respect of the mother; the name, age, marital status, usual residence, nationality, National Identification Number or Alien Identification Number for citizens and Aliens respectively; level of education, profession or occupation, and previous births;\n\nin respect of the father; the name, age, marital status, usual residence, nationality, National Identification Number or Alien Identification Number for citizens and Aliens respectively; level of education and profession or occupation; and\n\nin respect of the informant, the name, capacity, nationality, National Identification Number or Alien Identification Number for citizens and Aliens respectively; signature of informant, and date of notification. (Uganda 2015)\n\nThe NIRA website lists the following requirements for registration of a birth:\n\nA birth Notification Record.\n\nA NIRA Birth declaration Form 3 complete and signed by one of the parents or guardian of the child.\n\nThe National Identification Number (NIN) of Notifier.\n\nPhotocopy of the National ID of the Notifier.\n\nNote: For a birth that has occurred in a medical facility, a notification Record shall include a document duly signed and stamped by a Hospital Administrator or Superintendent.\n\nFor a birth that has occurred in the community, a notification Record shall include a document duly signed and stamped by a Division- Town Clerk, Sub county – Sub county Chief, and shall have the following particulars of the event:\n\nDate of [b]irth.\n\nTime of [b]irth.\n\nRegistration [n]umber.\n\nName of child.\n\nNames of [p]arents (Uganda n.d.b)\n\nA copy of the NIRA Birth Declaration Form 3 has been attached to this Response (Attachment 1).\n\n2.2 Registration of Births Occurring Outside Uganda\n\nSection 34 of the Registration of Persons Act, 2015 provides the following:\n\n34. Registration of births occurring outside Uganda.\n\nA person giving notice of a birth occurring outside Uganda of a child whose parent or guardian is a citizen of Uganda, shall produce to the registration officer the following evidence of the birth—\n\na certificate of birth issued by the appropriate authority in the foreign country, with an English translation of the certificate if it is not in English; or\n\nif a certificate of birth are [sic] not issued in the foreign country, a certificate of the birth given by the doctor, midwife or other persons who attended to the birth, with an English translation of the certificate if it is not in English; or\n\nif there is a Uganda Mission in the country abroad, a certificate of an officer of the Mission that the officer is satisfied, from the evidence produced and inquiries the officer has made, that the particulars of the birth given in the certificate are correct; or\n\nif there is no Uganda Mission in the country abroad, such other evidence as the Minister may prescribe in the Regulations.\n\nThe person giving notice of the birth shall certify in writing to the registration officer the correctness and authenticity of the evidence which such person submits.\n\nUpon receiving the evidence required under subsection (1), the registration officer shall forthwith enter the prescribed particulars of the birth in the register of births occurring outside Uganda. (Uganda 2015)\n\n2.3 Obtaining a Birth Certificate\n\nSection 39(1) of the Registration of Persons Act, 2015 provides the following:\n\nUpon receipt of the application in the prescribed form and upon payment of the prescribed fee, the Authority shall issue a certificate in the prescribed form of the birth of any person compiled in the prescribed manner from the records and register in the Authority’s custody. (Uganda 2015)\n\nThe NIRA website indicates that the fee to obtain a birth certificate is 5,000 Ugandan shillings (UGX) [approximately C$1.88] for nationals, and US$40 for foreigners (Uganda n.d.c). The same source further notes that the fee to obtain a \"Certified Copy of an Entry in the Register\" is 1,000 UGX [approximately C$0.37] (Uganda n.d.c). A copy of NIRA Form 15, Application for a Certified Copy of Entry in the Register of Birth and Death, has been attached to this Response (Attachment 2).\n\nThe Observer, a newspaper based in Kampala, reports that in 2011, the URSB, in partnership with Uganda Telecom and UNICEF, launched the Mobile Vital Records System (Mobile VRS), which \"enables birth notifications to be sent by mobile phones to URSB's server and enables health and government officials who have access to the internet and a printer to register and print birth certificates in real time\" (The Observer 20 Dec. 2013). The website for Uganda Mobile VRS notes that the system \"enables the use of a web based application and mobile phones (USSD) to register births and deaths in health facilities and communities respectively\" (Uganda Mobile VRS n.d.). The website further notes that:\n\nFor deliveries outside health facilities, mobile phones are used by Notifiers to send via USSD, births and deaths notifications from the community level to a central Mobile VRS server at NIRA. This information is accessible to the respective Registration Officers of a given registration area, who verify it for completeness and consistency, before a birth certificate is printed, signed and issued to the registered child.\n\nFor deliveries in hospitals, birth records of new born babies are registered using a web-based system positioned at the hospital and their birth notifications are printed and issued to them immediately, while at the same time uploading this information into the central Mobile VRS server in real time. (Uganda Mobile VRS n.d.)\n\nIn a post from May 2017, NIRA noted that it would be registering births and issuing birth certificates at the Kampala Baby Expo from 6 May to 7 May 2017, and \"[t]o enhance the acquisition process, birth certificate applicants [are required] to provide birth notifications from hospitals for children born in hospitals and Division or Sub county notifications for children born out of hospitals\" (Uganda 3 May 2017). Further information could not be found among the sources consulted by the Research Directorate within the time constraints of this Response.\n\nInformation on whether a birth certificate can be obtained by a third party could not be found among the sources consulted by the research directorate within the time constraints of this Response.\n\n2.3.1 Locations to Obtain Birth Certificates\n\nA December 2013 article in the Observer reports that Mobile VRS \"is now operational in all 135 government and missionary hospitals and 36 out of 112 districts across Uganda\" (The Observer 20 Dec. 2013). An undated post on the Republic of Uganda's Justice Law and Order Sector (JLOS) [1] website notes that the system \"is functional in all 135 government and missionary hospitals and in only 58 of the 112 district local governments,\" adding that birth registration in Uganda had increased from 30 percent in 2011 to an estimated 60 percent by the end of 2014 (Uganda n.d.d). The US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015 for Uganda reports that Mobile VRS \"operated in 135 hospitals in 58 districts\" (US 13 Apr. 2016, 30).\n\nThe NIRA website indicates that its headquarters are located in Kampala, Uganda (Uganda n.d.e). The Daily Monitor similarly notes that the offices of NIRA are located in Kampala (The Daily Monitor 6 Jan. 2016). The NIRA website further states that \"NIRA will open other service points across the country until the goal to cover the entire country is [completed]\" (Uganda n.d.f). An April 2017 post by the Uganda Media Centre, \"[t]he Government of Uganda's Official centre for public Communications,\" indicates that \"NIRA offices are located in all districts in the country. In Kampala, [NIRA's] offices are located at the five KCCA [Kampala Capital City Authority] Divisions for Kampala\" (Uganda 15 Apr. 2017). Without providing further information, the NIRA website, in a post from May 2017, reports that in addition to its outreach at the Kampala Baby Expo, \"a number of similar (Birth, Death and Adoption Order Registration) activities have been lined up across selected parts of the country, including in; Tororo, Gulu and Mbarara\" (Uganda 10 May 2017).\n\nThe website of the Uganda High Commission in Ottawa states that \"[a]pplications and authentication of birth certificates is not handled by the Ottawa Mission\" (Uganda n.d.g). The website of the Uganda High Commission in London, UK similarly notes that the \"Uganda High Commission does not handle any matters relating to births, deaths and marriage certificates\" (Uganda n.d.h). The website of the Embassy of the Republic of Uganda in Washington, DC indicates that the embassy authenticates birth certificates (Uganda n.d.i). Further and corroborating information on locations where birth certificates can be obtained, within or outside of Uganda, could not be found among the sources consulted by the Research Directorate within the time constraints of this Response.\n\n3. Appearance of Birth Certificates\n\nThe joint press release by URSB and NIRA notes that \"all births, deaths, and adoptions certificates issued under the Births and Deaths Registration Act prior to January 01, 2016 shall remain valid\" (Uganda 29 Dec. 2015, bold in original). For a description of birth certificates issued prior to the establishment of NIRA, including information contained within them, refer to Response to Information Request UGA103781 of July 2011.\n\nThe Uganda Radio Network (URN), a news agency in Uganda, reports that effective 6 March 2015, the Ugandan government began issuing birth certificates with \"enhanced security features,\" and cites a URSB official as stating that the new certificates include a unique barcode and number (URN 12 Mar. 2015). The same source indicates that the official declined to specify other enhanced security features (URN 12 Mar. 2015). The article further cites a Senior Registration Officer with the government as noting that the certificates would only be issued to new applicants, and that persons with previously issued certificates would only be issued the enhanced version if they required a replacement (URN 12 Mar. 2015). Further and corroborating information could not be found among the sources consulted by the Research Directorate within the time constraints of this Response.\n\nSection 39(2) of the Registration of Persons Act, 2015 provides the following:\n\n(2) A certificate of birth issued under subsection (1) shall contain—\n\nthe information concerning the child which shall include;\n\nname;\n\nplace of birth;\n\ndate of birth;\n\nsex;\n\nnationality;\n\nNational Identification Number or Alien Identification Number of a child who is a citizen and alien respectively.\n\nthe information concerning the parents of the child which shall include the name, nationality, National Identification Number or Alien Identification Number for citizens and Aliens parents respectively; and\n\nany other information as may be prescribed by the Minister. (Uganda 2015)\n\nThis Response was prepared after researching publicly accessible information currently available to the Research Directorate within time constraints. This Response is not, and does not purport to be, conclusive as to the merit of any particular claim for refugee protection.
