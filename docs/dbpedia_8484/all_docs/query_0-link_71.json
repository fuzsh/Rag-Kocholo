        "text": "Zimbabe’s Rugby Union are reportedly in talks with former All Blacks and Wallabies stars as the newly-crowned Rugby Africa champions ramp up their bid to qualify for the 2027 World Cup.\n\nThe Sables, who dethroned 10-time consecutive champions Namibia in the semi-finals, won their first Rugby Africa Cup in 12 years on Sunday as they beat the Algeria 29-3 in the Ugandan capital Kampala.\n\nHaving now risen to 28th on World Rugby’s Test rankings – their highest position since they were 26th in November 2015 – Zimbabwe have now turned their attention to securing a place at the next World Cup in Australia.\n\nAccording to a report by RugbyPass, former Wallabies centre Kyle Godwin and ex-All Blacks flank Gareth Evans could use World Rugby’s new eligibility laws to make the switch to represent Zimbabwe.\n\nHarare-born Godwin, who plays for Lyon in the Top 14, could have made his debut for Zimbabwe in the Rugby Africa Cup had it not coincided with his wedding.\n\nThe 32-year-old earned his one and only cap for the Wallabies in 2016, so has fulfilled World Rugby’s stand-down criteria to make the nationality switch.\n\nLikewise, former Highlanders flank Evans last played for the All Blacks in 2018, so is eligible to represent Zimbabwe.\n\nFormer Vodacom Bulls lock Eli Snyman, born in Zimbabwe and schooled in Johannesburg, is also reported to be in the frame for a call-up, as the Benetton player is currently uncapped at senior level.\n\nZimbabwe already have former Western Force captain Ian Prior in their squad, as they hunt a place in the World Cup for the first time since 1991."
