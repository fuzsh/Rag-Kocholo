        "text": "Idi Amin Dada Oumee (; c. 1925 – 16 August 2003) was a Ugandan military officer who served as the President of Uganda from 1971 to 1979. Popularly known as the \"Butcher of Uganda,\" he is considered one of the most brutal despots in world history.Amin was born either in Koboko or Kampala to a Kakwa father and Lugbara mother. In 1946, he joined the King's African Rifles (KAR) of the British Colonial Army as a cook. He rose to the rank of lieutenant, taking part in British actions against Somali rebels in the Shifta War and then the Mau Mau rebels in Kenya. Uganda gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, and Amin remained in the armed forces, rising to the position of major and being appointed Commander of the Army in 1965. He became aware that Ugandan President Milton Obote was planning to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, so he launched a military coup in 1971 and declared himself President. During his years in power, Amin shifted from being a pro-western ruler enjoying considerable support from Israel to being backed by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko, the Soviet Union, and East Germany. In 1975, Amin became the chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), a Pan-Africanist group designed to promote solidarity among African states. Uganda was a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights from 1977 to 1979. The UK broke diplomatic relations with Uganda in 1977, and Amin declared that he had defeated the British and added \"CBE\" to his title for \"Conqueror of the British Empire\". Radio Uganda then announced his entire title: \"His Excellency President for Life, Field Marshal Alhaji Dr. Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, CBE\".As Amin's rule progressed into the late 1970s, there was increased unrest against his persecution of certain ethnic groups and political dissidents, along with Uganda's very poor international standing due to Amin's support for the terrorist hijackers in Operation Entebbe. He then attempted to annex Tanzania's Kagera Region in 1978, so Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere had his troops invade Uganda; they captured Kampala on 11 April 1979 and ousted Amin from power. Amin then went into exile, first in Libya and then in Saudi Arabia, where he lived until his death on 16 August 2003. Amin's rule was characterized by rampant human rights abuses, political repression, ethnic persecution, extrajudicial killings, nepotism, corruption, and gross economic mismanagement. International observers and human rights groups estimate that between 100,000 and 500,000 people were killed under his regime.\n\nIrshad Manji (born 1968) is a Canadian author, educator, and advocate of a reformist interpretation of Islam. She is a well-known critic of Islamic fundamentalism, which she has argued is in the mainstream of Islam, and was described in 2003 as \"Osama bin Laden's worst nightmare\".Manji has written several books, two of which have been banned in Malaysia. The Trouble with Islam Today (first released as Trouble with Islam), has been published in more than 30 languages, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Malay and Indonesian. Allah, Liberty and Love was released in June 2011. Don't Label Me: An Incredible Conversation for Divided Times—a new book about diversity, bigotry, and our common humanity, written to help foster dialogue and progress about divisive subjects—was published in February 2019. Manji founded several educational projects to help young people discover their values and their courage; of note are Project Ijtihad and the Moral Courage Project. Manji produced a PBS documentary in the America at a Crossroads series titled \"Faith Without Fear\", chronicling her personal attempt to \"reconcile her faith in Allah with her love of freedom\". The documentary was nominated for a 2008 Emmy Award. Her articles have appeared in many publications, and she has addressed audiences ranging from Amnesty International, to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. She has appeared on television networks around the world."
