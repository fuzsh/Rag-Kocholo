        "text": "If your habitual abode is in Uganda, you can acknowledge paterinty in accordance with German law at the German Embassy in Kampala.

Having a German marriage certificate will simplify other processes when you return to Germany.\n\nWith effect from January 1, 2009, family registers will no longer be kept in Germany; existing family registers will be continued as marriage entries. Instead, marriage registers are created and maintained at the registry offices.\n\nThe following documents are required to apply for marriage registration (1 original + 1 copy):\n\nCompleted and signed application for certification of a foreign marriage in the German marriage register (see downloads; Note: application form is available only in German)\n\nIf necessary, proof of name declaration in the marriage (see downloads; Note: application form is available only in German)\n\nUgandan marriage certificate\n\nProof of the nationality of both spouses (e.g. passports, certificates of naturalisation if not nationality since birth)\n\nBirth certificates of both spouses\n\nIf applicable: divorce decree, marriage certificates of previous marriages, death certificates\n\nIf the marriage was not concluded in Germany or Uganda: non-marriage certificate from the respective home country\n\nImportant information:\n\nPlease also note that documents that are not issued in German, English or French must first be translated by a translator based in Germany.\n\nVerification of Ugandan documents: Requirements for the legalization of public documents from Uganda are not met at the moment. Ugandan documents can therefore be checked for authenticity, legal conformity and correctness of content at the discretion of the responsible German authority if they are to be used in the German jurisdiction. Further information can be found under the keyword verification.\n\nName declaration: If the application of the registration of your marriage in the German marriage register also includes a name declaration, the application must be signed by both spouses and certified by the diplomatic mission abroad. In this case, both spouses must be present. If you only want to apply for the registration of your marriage in the German marriage register, only one spouse must be present. A public certification is not necessary in this case.\n\nFees: The diplomatic mission abroad will forward your application to the relevant registry office in Germany. If you still are or were registered in Germany as your place of residence, the respective registry office at your place of residence is responsible for the entry in the marriage register. Otherwise, the registry office I in Berlin is responsible.\n\nIf the application needs to be certified by the diplomatic mission abroad, a fee of €79.57 at the current exchange rate of the Embassy Kampala in Uganda shillings will be charged. Fees can only be paid in cash and not by credit card.\n\nFurthermore, the responsible registry office charges a fee for entry in the marriage register and for issuing German marriage certificates.

If you still are or were registered in Germany as your place of residence, the respective registry office at your residence is responsible for the entry in the marriage register. Otherwise, the registry office I in Berlin is responsible.\n\nRecording the birth of a German child born in Uganda can also be done by the German diplomatic mission abroad. There is generally no deadline for registering a birth in the German birth registry, but it is advisable to register the child as soon as it is born. If the mother and father do not have a common family name at the time of the child's birth, a name declaration is usually required.\n\nThe following documents are required to apply for a birth certificate (1 original + 2 copies):\n\nCompleted application form to record an oversee's birth abroad in the German Birth Register (see downloads; Note: application form is available only in German)\n\nLong birth certificate of the child\n\nParents' birth certificates\n\nProof of the parents' nationality (passport/citizenship card)\n\nif applicable, the child’s passport\n\nif applicable, marriage certificate of the parents\n\nif applicable, divorce decree from one parent\n\nif applicable, death certificate of one parent\n\nif applicable, acknowledgement of paternity\n\nif applicable, custody decision\n\nif applicable, name declaration (see downloads; Note: application form is available only in German)\n\nif applicable, certificate of citizenship\n\nIn individual cases, additional documents may also be required.\n\nImportant information:\n\nPlease also note that documents that are not issued in German, English or French must first be translated by a translator based in Germany.\n\nVerification of Ugandan documents: Requirements for the legalization of public documents from Uganda are not met at the moment.
