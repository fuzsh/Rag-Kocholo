In the case of a serious accident, you will need to be evacuated by a private ambulance.\n\nYou should also make sure you are covered by health insurance for treatment in the UK, as the NHS could charge you for any care received in the UK.\n\nThe NHS has information for people moving abroad.\n\nYou can access a list of some of the medical hospitals in Uganda.\n\nSee our travel advice sections on health, safety and security.\n\nNOTE: UK travel insurance providers will not generally cover your healthcare costs if you live overseas.\n\nMedicine\n\nIf you use prescription medication you should ensure you have a supply of it or are able to obtain it when in Uganda.
