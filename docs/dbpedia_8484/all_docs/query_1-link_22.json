        "text": "Essential Info\n\nIs this trip for you?\n\nThis trip is graded Activity Level 2 (Easy & Moderate) with a Wildlife Rating of Four. For more information on our trip gradings please visit the Activity Level Guidelines page or our Wildlife Holidays page for more on our Wildlife Ratings. If you have any queries about the difficulty of the trip please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nThe Moderate grade applies specifically to the gorilla and chimp treks, the rest of the itinerary is graded Easy.\n\nGorilla trek: Owing to the terrain and the need to explore to find gorillas, the trek doesn’t follow a path in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest; instead, the guides cut a route through the undergrowth. Expect a minimum of three hours of walking on rough terrain, with the possibility of climbing up to 8,553ft (2,607m); steep ascents and descents over muddy slopes are the norm. Strong footwear is essential and we recommend hiring a local porter to help you carry your bag/camera equipment and provide a steady, supportive hand (porters are arranged and paid for locally on the day).\n\nThis is a busy and active trip with some early starts as we explore as much as we can of this wonderful country. There are some long drives, sometimes on bad roads, but we use comfortable safari vehicles and the fantastic scenery does make time on the drives go by.\n\nBooking conditions\n\nAt the time of booking, a £732 (or equivalent in booking currency) non-refundable deposit is required to cover the cost of the gorilla permit and a £209 (or equivalent in booking currency) non-refundable deposit is required to cover the cost of the chimp permit. If for any reason we are unable to secure the permits and must cancel the trip, you receive a full refund.\n\nIf you would like a second gorilla or chimp trek, please request this at time of booking, an extra deposit is required. However, we only request the extra permits once the trip has been guaranteed as, otherwise, they must be paid in full even if the trip doesn’t run. Once the extra gorilla or chimp permits have been requested, the deposits are non-refundable.\n\nFollowing a review of all our trips we have categorised this trip as generally not suitable for persons of reduced mobility. However if you are a regular traveller on such trips, please contact customer services to discuss the trip and your personal condition.\n\nJoining Instructions\n\nGetting to the start hotel\n\nOur start hotel is approximately 15 minutes from Entebbe International Airport (EBB). Exodus provides free arrival transfers to the start hotel from the airport for all customers. Please note that check in times differ between hotels but is between 12.30 – 14.00.\n\nIf you would like further information on joining this trip, please speak to your sales representative.\n\nCatching your return flight\n\nThe group returns to Entebbe at approximately 6pm. If your flight departs between 8pm and 10pm, you will be dropped at the airport before dinner. If you are on the later flight, you will be transferred to the airport after dinner. Please do not book flights departing before 8pm.\n\nFull joining instructions including local emergency numbers will be sent to you as part of our Final Joining Instructions. If you do not receive these at least a week before departure, or require them earlier please contact our office or your travel agent.\n\nLocation start: Entebbe\n\nLocation end: Entebbe\n\nVaccinations and Health\n\nUganda\n\nVaccination against yellow fever is necessary and you must bring a valid certificate of vaccination. You may also want to consider vaccinations for hepatitis A, polio, tetanus, typhoid, cholera, hepatitis B, meningococcal disease, rabies and tuberculosis. Malaria prophylaxis is essential. Please seek advice from your doctor or travel clinic on the best course of action for all the above.\n\nAdditionally, bilharzia is known to occur in some of the lakes or rivers visited on this itinerary, we therefore advise all to take advice from your guide or leader locally before venturing for a swim. Zika fever, a mosquito‐borne viral disease, is also a known risk in places visited on this trip. There is currently no vaccine or prophylaxis available, we therefore strongly recommend you take the usual precautions to avoid mosquito bites.\n\nVisa\n\nUganda\n\nTravellers from the UK, US and EU normally need a visa to enter Uganda. Please note, visa requirements often change and it is your responsibility to obtain any required visas for this trip. Therefore, we recommend that you check with the nearest embassy or consulate of your chosen destination(s), including any countries you may be transiting or transferring through.\n\nSome local governments provide guidance on what visas their citizens need. To help, we’ve gathered a selection of useful links below.\n\nAustralia: www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/uganda\n\nCanada: www.travel.gc.ca/destinations/uganda\n\nUnited Kingdom: www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/uganda/entry-requirements\n\nUSA: www.travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Uganda.html\n\nYou can apply for your visa (or find out more information) at www.visas.immigration.go.ug. The decision taken on the application will be sent electronically through the email provided by the applicant. If approved, an approval letter will be sent as an attachment to the email provided. Print it out and present it together with a valid passport/travel document at the port of entry. The cost of a standard single-entry visit visa is US$50 and can be paid online.\n\nPlease note: Currently, the single-entry visa is only valid for three months from the issue data. Please ensure your visa is valid for your travel dates.\n\nIf after visiting Uganda, you will also travel to Rwanda and Kenya, you may apply for an East African Visa, which covers all three countries. Please contact the Ugandan High Commission to obtain more information about the combined visa from Uganda.\n\nFood & Drink\n\nAll breakfasts, 10 lunches and nine dinners included.\n\nThe service can be either à la carte or buffet, depending on the lodge. For early game drives, and to maximise the time spent in the parks, a packed breakfast or lunch may be provided in some instances. The food provided is a mix of good local and international food throughout.\n\nIt is possible to cater for vegetarians or those with special requirements; however, please make sure you advise your sales representative at time of booking.\n\nPlease note: The availability of certain specialised products for restricted diets (eg gluten-free or dairy-free) is minimal or non-existent in Uganda and we strongly recommend you bring these specialised dietary items from home.\n\nWeather\n\nThe wettest areas are concentrated along the shores of Lake Victoria and the western mountain districts. Although rains are normally more frequent during the two rainy seasons (April-May and October-November), wet spells can occur during the dry season, so please come prepared. Uganda can be visited at any time, the weather is pleasant for much of the year over most of the country and temperatures are never excessively high.\n\nThe temperatures are usually cooler at night and this depends more on the altitude than on the actual area of the country.\n\nComfortable hotels and lodges near national parks\n\nThe accommodation on this trip has been chosen to maximise your animal-watching opportunities and minimise travel time. Listed below are the properties we usually use.\n\nEntebbe: 2 Friends Beach Hotel, Papyrus Guest House or Boma Hotel (night 1)\n\nOur first night is spent at one of three hotels: 2 Friends Beach Hotel, Papyrus Guest House or Boma Hotel (above), depending on availability. All are within a 15 to 25-minute drive from the airport. The start hotel for your trip will be sent to you as part of our Final Joining Instructions or if you require them earlier please contact our office or your travel agent.\n\nNear Kibale Forest National Park: Turaco Treetops (nights 2-3)\n\nWithin 12 acres (5ha) of rainforest bordering Kibale Forest National Park, this comfortable three-star hotel is the ideal base to explore the park and trek with chimpanzees. The lodge is powered by solar power, ensuring it operates in harmony with the surroundings. The hotel has a spacious pool, lounge and restaurant plus comfortable rooms with balconies.\n\nNear Queen Elizabeth National Park: Simba Safari Camp (nights 4-5)\n\nThis two-star camp is on the edge of Queen Elizabeth National Park. The location is outstanding and there is a small pool that provides a perfect spot to chill in the afternoon heat. The rooms are simple but clean with private bathrooms and the hotel is renowned for having friendly staff.\n\nBuhoma: Haven Lodge Buhoma (nights 6-8)\n\nThis community-owned lodge is perfectly located close to the meeting point for the gorilla treks. There are amazing rainforest views from the terraces, and the comfortable rooms are made with local materials to blend into the surroundings.\n\nNear Lake Mburo National Park: Rwakobo Rock (nights 9-10)\n\nThis comfortable three-star lodge is just 0.6mi (1km) from the gate of Lake Mburo National Park and each cottage is set apart to offer privacy and uninterrupted views of the park. There is a water hole beneath the dining areas so you can watch the wildlife come to drink while you enjoy dinner."
