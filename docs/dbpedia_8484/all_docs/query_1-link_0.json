His journey to the top of the charts wasn't paved with choir practice and polished performances. It began on the harsh streets of Kampala, a world away from the stages he commands today.\n\nForced to leave home at a young age due to hardship, Exodus, barely a teenager, found himself navigating the unforgiving reality of life on the streets. The details of those years remain etched in his memory, a stark contrast to the life he leads now.\n\nBut Exodus' story isn't one of despair. It's a testament to the power of resilience and the unexpected paths life can take. How this young man, hardened by his experiences, found solace and purpose in gospel music is a story waiting to be unraveled.\n\nThis is more than just a story of musical success. It's a testament to the human spirit's ability to overcome adversity and find redemption in the most unexpected places. It's the story of Exodus, and it's a story worth hearing.\n\nI had a sit down with Exodus over his remarkable journey as we explored his grueling years on the streets, the turning point that led him to faith, and his meteoric rise to become a revolutionary figure in Ugandan gospel music.
