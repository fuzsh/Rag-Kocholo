        "text": "Nationwide — Safina Namukwaya, a 70-year-old woman from Uganda, is making headlines as one of the oldest mothers as she recently gave birth to twins via cesarean at a fertility center in the city of Kampala.\n\nNamukwaya, who welcomed a baby boy and girl, expressed her joy, calling the birth a “miracle,” according to BBC.\n\nThe Women’s Hospital International and Fertility Centre (WHI&FC) in Kampala, where the delivery took place, joined in the celebration, emphasizing that it goes beyond “medical success; it’s about the strength and resilience of the human spirit.”\n\nSharing the remarkable achievement on their Facebook page, the WHI&FC wrote, “We’ve achieved the extraordinary — delivering twins to Africa’s oldest mother aged 70!”\n\nDr. Edward Tamale Sali, a fertility specialist at the hospital, revealed that the mother underwent in-vitro fertilization (IVF) using a donor egg and her partner’s sperm. The twins were born prematurely at 31 weeks but are currently in stable condition, being cared for in incubators.\n\nMeanwhile, Namukwaya said that her pregnancy journey was challenging, especially since her partner abandoned her upon learning she was expecting twins instead of just one.\n\n“Men don’t like to be told that you are carrying more than one child. Ever since I was admitted here, my man has never showed up,” she said.\n\nThis isn’t Ms. Namukwaya’s first experience with motherhood. Just 3 years ago, she gave birth to a baby girl. She explained that her desire to have children stemmed from societal pressures.\n\n“I looked after people’s children and saw them grow up and leave me alone,” she said. “I wondered who would take care of me when I grow old.”"
