        "text": "Community of the Indian diaspora\n\nEthnic group\n\nThere is a sizable community of the Indian diaspora and people of Indian descent in Uganda. In 2003, there were an estimated 15,000 people of Asian descent (mostly Indians and Pakistanis) living in Uganda. At its peak, this community stood at between 80,000 to 100,000 people in the 1960s. However, in 1972, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin issued an order to expel all South Asians from the country amidst a backdrop of anti-Indian sentiment and Black supremacy.[1] In response to the exodus, India, the United Kingdom, and several other countries severed diplomatic ties with Uganda.\n\nAfter the Tanzanian invasion of Uganda overthrew Amin and exiled him to Libya, many Indians gradually returned to the country over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, and have once again gone on to dominate the country's economy, accounting for at least 40% of it.[2] Despite making up less than 1% of the population, Uganda's Indian community is estimated to be contributing up to 65% of the country's total tax revenue.[2] Ugandan businessman Sudhir Ruparelia, who is of Indian origin, is the country's richest man, with his net worth standing at approximately US$1.2 billion in 2019.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBritish Empire\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1895, construction of the Uganda Railway began. The Imperial British East Africa Company awarded Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee, an agent based in Karachi, with the contract to supply the required labour force. Jeevanjee recruited his workforce from the Punjab region of British India.[3] The first group to arrive had a total of 350 men, and over a six-year period, a total of 31,895 men worked on the project. Some died, others returned to India after the end of their contracts, and others chose to stay. The population was later bolstered by Gujarati traders called \"passenger Indians\", both Hindu and Muslim free migrants who came to serve the economic needs of the indentured labourers and to capitalize on the economic opportunities.[4][5]\n\nPost-British era\n\n[edit]\n\nOver time, Indians became prosperous and dominated much of the Ugandan economy, with some acting in the role of 'colonial overseers' for the British regime, which prompted the rise of resentment and Indophobia.[4] These resentments came to a crisis when Idi Amin ousted Milton Obote by military coup d'état in 1971. The following year, Amin ordered the expulsion of Asians living in Uganda.[6] As a result, many Indians migrated to the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, and elsewhere and began rebuilding their lives. After Amin's death, however, more Indians who were born in Uganda started migrating back.[7][8]\n\nNotable Ugandans of Indian descent\n\n[edit]\n\nAkbar Baig - Ugandan cricketer\n\nAnup Singh Choudry - Former judge of the High Court of Uganda\n\nAvan Jogia - Canadian actor[9]\n\nArif Virani - 53rd Attorney General of Canada\n\nAsif Din - English cricketer\n\nBharat Masrani - CEO of TD Canada Trust\n\nBhaskar Bhattacharya (filmmaker) - Indian independent film-maker and scholar.\n\nCharli XCX - British singer\n\nChirag Patel - Norwegian Artist\n\nHasmukh Dawda - businessman\n\nIrshad Manji - Canadian author\n\nJayesh Manek - Indian fund manager\n\nJitendra Patel - Canadian cricketer\n\nKashif Siddiqi - English footballer\n\nMahmood Mamdani - Ugandan academic\n\nMayur Madhvani - Ugandan industrialist\n\nMiraj Barot - businessman\n\nMobina Jaffer - Canadian senator\n\nMukesh Shukla - Ugandan industrialist\n\nNandi Rose Plunkett - American musician\n\nNandikishore Patel - Ugandan cricketer\n\nNaomi Scott - English actress and singer\n\nNehal Bibodi - Ugandan cricketer\n\nMohamed Keshavjee - International Family Mediator\n\nOmar Sachedina - Canadian journalist\n\nPriti Patel - British politician\n\nPeter Nazareth - Ugandan-American author\n\nRajat Neogy - Ugandan-American poet, Founder & First Editor of Transition Magazine\n\nSalma Lakhani - 19th Lieutenant Governor of Alberta\n\nShailesh Vara - British politician\n\nShekhar Mehta - Kenyan rally driver\n\nShimit Amin - Indian film director\n\nSikander Lalani - Ugandan steel magnate\n\nSudhir Ruparelia - Ugandan businessman\n\nWilfred de Souza - Politician and Chief Minister of Goa\n\nWalter de Sousa - Indian field hockey player\n\nSupra Singhal - Ugandan swimmer\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nIndia portal\n\nUganda portal\n\nIndia–Uganda relations\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nKumar, Mukesh (2011). \"Indians in Post-War Uganda, 1948-62\".
