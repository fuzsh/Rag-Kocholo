        "text": "Gospel singer George Timothy Lubega also known as Exodus is the latest voice that doesn't think very highly of the top leadership of the new association.\n\nAlthough he is a member, Exodus thinks the fellow gospel artiste, Pastor Wilson Bugembe, should have been at the helm of federation.\n\n“Bugembe became a pastor but he never quit music; he is still putting out music; he is very passionate and he loves the industry. I think he should be the guy for the job,” Exodus told reporters recently.\n\nInstagram\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe music federation which was unveiled on May 5th, 2023 with Eddy Kenzo as President and Sheebah Karungi deputising, hit the ground running but not without its fair share of criticism from within and outside the industry.\n\nArtistes such as Big Eye, Carol Nantongo, Eddy Kenzo, Alien Skin have all shared some degree of reservation about the federation.\n\nMuch of the criticism has been largely about the quality of leadership as well as its real intentions.\n\nBut the association leadership insists that if harnessed, it could deliver massive dividends to the Music industry in Uganda.\n\nVP Sheebah Karungi, citing a record breaking $964 million made in royalties by Nigerian artistes Tems and Wizkid from the hit “Essence” said Ugandan musicians could be looking at the benefits if they remain united.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“My Fellow Ugandan Musicians, This right here is the reason why we should stick together as one and fight for our royalties. And to do that , We must have our copyrights,” she said."
