        "text": "By Clare Muhindo\n\nKnown by his stage name Exodus, George Lubega Timothy, is a Ugandan singer.\n\nHe made his musical debut in 2004, with his single hit “Ganja Man.”\n\nExodus describes himself as a down-to-earth, serious about business and God-fearing person, who was molded by the life on the streets where smoking marijuana was the order of the day.\n\nHis early life\n\nExodus who was born on 8 June 1984, was raised by a single mother, who passed away when he was 10 years old.\n\nHe was then taken in until he was 12 years old by his polygamous father.\n\nExodus had to join the streets of Kampala after being rejected by his physically and mentally abusive father.\n\nAt age 12 in 1996, he started feeding in dustbins, smoking marijuana, sniffing petrol and pickpocketing for a living around Katwe, Dewinton road and Owino market which was his base.\n\nIn 2001, he left the streets for Nakulabye in Kiyaaye where together with a friend, Dan Kimuli, began a new life.\n\nKnowing Jesus\n\nKimuli suggested that he visit Pastor Robert Kayanja‘s Miracle Centre church.\n\n“I wanted to taste this Jesus that was preached that day, and the following week I went back and gave my life to Jesus,” said Exodus in an interview.\n\nHis first hit as a solo artist “Once a Ganja Man” narrates the journey of his life on the streets of Kampala to his transformation as a follower of Christ.\n\nIn “Once a Ganja man” he narrates, “Remember the days of Ganja, when we used to smoke Ganja.”\n\nThis single became an anthem in churches, conferences and even at secular concerts. The “Once a ganja man” single became so massive and it got huge airplay on radio and Television stations worldwide.\n\nAt his age, his first serious single managed to get airplay on MTV base yet those that joined the industry years back and even have the funds to facilitate their projects have failed to have their songs played on MTV.\n\nWith just one song, Exodus won several awards from religious organizations and Buzz Magazine.\n\nMusic Career\n\nAfter meeting Pastor Kayanja in 2002, in 2004 he became a leader and singer in the church choir.\n\nIt is the same year that Isaac Rucibigango (Rucci) recruited Exodus and two others, Bahati Nsereko and Kenneth Tusubira, to form the Sauti band that toured the Great Lakes region.\n\nHe toured Tanzania, Rwanda and Kenya.\n\nWhile in Kenya in 2007, he left Sauti.\n\nIn 2008, he released his first song Ganjaman. The song later became very big and it took over Uganda and beyond.\n\nHe followed that single with Addicted, I am Walking and his biggest hit yet, Igwe.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nOn July 1, 2011, Exodus wed his long time fiance, Brenda Mwanje, in a colorful ceremony at Rubaga Miracle Cathedral.\n\nThe ceremony was witnessed by about 300 guests. The couple rented two limousines.\n\nPastor Kayanja and his wife, Jessica Kayanja were the guests of honor.\n\nThe wedding reception was held at Speke resort, Munyonoyo, where Aroma Band, Morgan Isaac, and Kupper were some of the artistes that entertained the guests.\n\nExodus crowned the event at around 11. 30 pm, with a thrilling performance.\n\nCharity\n\nExodus works as the Artistic Director and Peace Ambassador of the Irene Gleeson Foundation (IGF) based in Northern Uganda.\n\nIGF is a charitable organisation taking care of more than 10,000 ex-child soldiers. On 19 August 2012, Exodus held a concert in Kampala, Uganda, in the Victoria hall of Serena Hotel to raise money to support the children of IGF.\n\nExodus performed with featuring artists such as Isaiah Katumwa, Maurice Kirya, Isaac Rucci, G Way, Hum Kay and Tabu Flo. All the proceeds went to the Foundation\n\nExodus is remembered for contributing goods worth sh 10m to the people of Bududa in eastern Uganda who were affected by the deadly landslide early in 2010.\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nWith only four songs under his belt, Exodus has been nominated for, and won more awards than many musicians who have been in the field much longer.\n\nIn 2009, He was nominated for an MTV Africa Music Awards and won four Buzz teen awards.\n\nHe has also won the Groove awards based in Nairobi, Pearl of Africa Music Awards; won two Olive gospel awards and was nominated in the All Africa Gospel Music awards in London as one of Africa’s best gospel artistes.\n\nTable 1.
