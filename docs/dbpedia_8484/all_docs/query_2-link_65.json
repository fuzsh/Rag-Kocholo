        "text": "A 70-year-old woman in Uganda had a pair of twins after undergoing fertility treatment, becoming one of the world’s oldest mothers.\n\nMs Safina Namukwaya gave birth to a boy and a girl on Nov 29 via caesarean section at a fertility centre in the capital, Kampala.\n\nThe Women’s Hospital International and Fertility Centre believes Ms Namukwaya is Africa’s oldest mother, adding in a Facebook post that this was not just about medical success, but it is about the “strength and resilience of the human spirit”.\n\n“She’s healthy. She’s talking. She’s walking around if they (medical staff) tell her to walk around the hospital,” Associated Press quoted the hospital spokesman Arthur Matsiko as saying.\n\nMs Namukwaya became pregnant after undergoing in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) using a donor egg and her partner’s sperm.\n\nThe babies were born premature at 31 weeks and weigh more than 1.3kg.\n\nThey were placed in incubators, reported the BBC, quoting the hospital’s fertility specialist, Dr Edward Tamale Sali, who added they are in a “stable” condition.\n\nMs Namukwaya also has a three-year-old daughter at her rural village in the east African nation, who was also conceived at the same hospital via IVF.\n\nShe said she had always wanted children after being mocked by others over her childless stage during her younger days.\n\n“I looked after people’s children and saw them grow up and leave me alone. I wondered who would take care of me when I grow old,” she told Uganda’s Daily Monitor newspaper.\n\nFor now, Ms Namukwaya will have to raise her children on her own, as her partner abandoned her after finding out she was carrying twins.\n\n“Men don’t like to be told that you are carrying more than one child. Ever since I was admitted here (the hospital), my man has never shown up,” she said.\n\nStill, she is not too worried as people from her village have expressed their willingness to pitch in.\n\n“Some households will be helping me with washing and the babies because of my advanced age,” Ms Namukwaya said.\n\nTypically, women go through menopause at ages 45 to 55, which means they are no longer able to bear children naturally. But advances in medical sciences have made it possible for older women to give birth.\n\nA Spanish woman, Ms Maria del Carmen Bousada de Lara, gained worldwide attention when she became the world’s oldest mother at the age of 66 in December 2006 after undergoing IVF treatment.\n\nShe died of cancer in July 2009 when her twin sons were 2½ years old. They are now under the care of her nephew and his wife.\n\nIn 2019, Ms Erramatti Mangayamma, then a 73-year-old farmer in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, gave birth to twin girls.\n\nIn Singapore, a 55-year-old woman gave birth to a baby in 2022, making her only the third woman aged 55 and above to have given birth and registered the birth of a baby since the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority started publishing the annual report on registration of births and deaths in 1989."
