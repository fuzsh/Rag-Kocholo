        "text": "A baby, Moses, is given life thanks to brave midwives and then pulled from the water by a princess. The birth imagery is striking. This is the beginning of the Passover story. At its end, a nation-being-born passes through the narrow cavity of the path that God opens through the Sea of Reeds and then emerges out the other side, alive and free. Birth imagery again.\n\nWe find yet more birth imagery here in the middle of the story, in the verses we will read the first morning of Passover. It shows up again at this crucial moment, just before the 10th plague brings grief and sorrow to so many in ancient Egypt, just before the Pharaoh finally summons Moses and Aaron and spits out the words, “Up, depart from among my people, you and the Israelites with you. Go, worship the Eternal as you said! Take also your flocks and your herds, as you said, and begone! And may you bring a blessing upon me also!” (Exodus 12:31-32)\n\nSaf is a somewhat unusual word, and it calls our attention to a key word in the other two moments of birth imagery that I’ve mentioned. In the first instance, which describes baby Moses being placed into the Nile and then drawn out of the water by the Pharaoh’s daughter, the text tells us that Moses’ mother placed the basket containing her beloved child in the reeds of the river. The Hebrew word for reeds is soof, spelled almost identically to saf. In the second instance — the liberation of the Israelites after they cross the divided Sea of Reeds — the word soof appears again, this time as part of the name of the body of water from which they emerged.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at these little Hebrew words, saf and soof, and see what other connections emerge. Let’s also expand our examination of the birth imagery that is so present throughout this story. When we do, we find elements, or at least hints, of death, blood and rebirth in all three of these key moments in the story.\n\nSo as we see, the story of the rescue and adoption of baby Moses is fraught with the potential of death. It also offers us a scene with its own unique moment of birth imagery when the Pharaoh’s daughter sees the helpless baby and has compassion on him, drawing him out of the waters and taking him for her own. Let’s listen to Philo’s interpretive telling of this moment as well:\n\nPhilo also adds a story that, after keeping the baby a while, she faked a pregnancy, stuffing things into the abdomen of her clothing in order to create appearances of having birthed the child herself. If we assume that Philo was relaying folklore or possibly early oral midrash in his elaborations on the story we find in the Torah, which mentions very little about the Egyptian princess, her feelings or her back story, then we see one of the most well-known birth motifs found in the Hebrew bible being attributed to the Egyptian princess — the agony of being unable to conceive a child and the arrival of a miraculously unexpected child to solve the problem.\n\nI think there’s blood imagery here, too, though it’s only hinted at. Later, during the 10 plagues, the Nile will be turned to blood. But also in this story, reading between the lines, it may be that the Pharaoh’s daughter was heading to the Nile to purify herself ritually following her menstrual cycle. If so, then Moses’ arrival represents a miraculous reversing of a lack of conception and birth.\n\nWhen we look at the Torah verses that tell the story of the 10th plague and the angel of death passing over the homes of the Hebrew slaves and slaying the first born of the Egyptians, we also see a story that presents us with death, with blood and with birth. The vividness of the lamb’s blood in the basin — the saf — being painted on the doorposts and lintels is there; these are like birth canals the Israelites will pass through after the destroying angel has passed over them.\n\nAnd finally, in the closing part of the Passover story — the marching through the miraculously divided Sea of Reeds, there are once again hints of death, blood, and images of birth. The word for “reeds” – soof bears close resemblance to the Hebrew word for “end,” which is sof. The Yam Soof, the Sea of Reeds, is also a pun for what the Israelites are afraid it really will be for them, namely the Yam Sof — the Sea of their End, their deaths. And with the Egyptian chariots pressing in on them, the death they are terrified they are about to experience is going to be a bloody one.\n\nBut then the Sea of Death turns into an unexpected birth canal, and when the people march across the sea to freedom and then the sea closes in and drowns the Pharaoh’s armies, the violent birth of this nation is complete. And on either side of the sea, we find two lone figures with the strangest of relation to the newborn. The Pharaoh, a maternal grandfather of sorts to Moses, stunned and defeated on one side, and Miriam, biological sister to Moses and therefore just on the cusp of being a granddaughter to Pharaoh, leading the women in dance on the other. A defeated, would-be god-on-earth on one side. A prophetess of the God Who Has No Name on the other.\n\nDeath, blood, birth. It’s there throughout this story.\n\nI’d like to close with one last image, also from Philo. Philo lived in the Jewish community of Alexandria in Egypt about 2,000 years ago, and his life’s work involved harmonizing Greek philosophy and Torah. What I’d like to leave you with is his explanation of the allegorical meaning of the burning bush miracle, later in Moses’ life, when he finds himself upon Mount Sinai, tending his father-in-law’s flocks, and sees a scrub brush bush on fire but notices that the little bush isn’t being consumed by the flames. Here is what Philo wrote about this:"
