Exodus Ug

Gospel Music Artist

George Lubega Timothy, also known as Exodus, born on 8 June 1984, is a renowned Ugandan singer recognized by his stage name, Exodus. His musical journey commenced in 2004 with the release of his chart-topping single "Ganja Man."

Early Life:

Exodus was raised by a single mother until her passing when he was 10 years old. Subsequently, he lived with his polygamous father until the age of 12. However, due to his father's abusive behavior, Exodus found himself on the streets of Kampala. In 1996, at the age of 12, he resorted to scavenging for sustenance, engaging in vices like smoking marijuana and sniffing petrol, as well as resorting to petty theft around Katwe, Dewinton road, and Owino market.

In 2001, Exodus transitioned to Nakulabye in Kiyaaye, where he embarked on a new chapter of his life alongside his friend Dan Kimuli. Kimuli's suggestion led Exodus to attend Pastor Robert Kayanja's Miracle Centre church, where he found solace and eventually embraced Christianity. His debut solo track, "Once a Ganja Man," chronicles his tumultuous journey from the streets of Kampala to his spiritual awakening. This single resonated widely, becoming a staple in both religious and secular settings, receiving extensive airplay on global radio and television platforms, including MTV base.

Music Career:

Following his encounter with Pastor Kayanja in 2002, Exodus joined the church choir and became a prominent figure. In 2004, he joined forces with Isaac Rucibigango (Rucci) and others to form the Sauti band, embarking on tours across the Great Lakes region, including Tanzania, Rwanda, and Kenya. However, he departed from Sauti during their tour in Kenya in 2007.

In 2008, Exodus released his breakthrough track, "Ganjaman," which propelled him to national and international acclaim. Subsequently, he followed up with hits like "Addicted," "I am Walking," and his chart-topping single, "Igwe."
