        "text": "​Tracy Paramo has been a licensed practitioner since 1989. With over 30 years of experience, Tracy has seen first-hand every possible salon situation including hourly, commission, booth lease, and salon ownership. From 1997-2012, Tracy was self-employed in a successful salon in Dallas, Texas. Having fallen in love with the Pacific Northwest, she finally decided to make the move here in 2012.\n\nUpon moving to Portland, she procured her Oregon licenses in Hair Design, Esthetics, and Nail Technology, as well as her Educator's license. Tracy has spent time here working as both a stylist and salon manager, however, she found a new vehicle for her passion when she began educating. She is currently the Director of Operations at Summit Salon Academy Portland.\n\nHer dedication to the industry is showcased by her commitment to supporting new service providers with essential knowledge to be successful. Tracy says, “We need to encourage more truth about this industry. All too often service providers sell themselves short. Operate with integrity, charge your worth, continue to educate yourself and you will see great success.\"\n\nHarold Fowlkes is a distinguished business owner from Happy Valley, OR. Born and raised in Southern California, his travels brought him to Washington State University in Pullman, WA where he finished his MBA in Finance.\n\nThe majority of his career has been, and still is, in the healthcare field, including Sales, Marketing, Management, Training, Leadership and Consulting for both private and Fortune 500 companies.\n\nHe and his business partners purchased \"The Influential Grooming Lounge\" two years ago. Their main goal is to provide an opportunity for members of the community to receive top quality service, while at the same time being in a place that fosters mentorship and grows influential leaders. The partners would like to open multiple locations and bring the same philosophy to other communities.\n\nChelsea Wescott has been a licensed hair stylist since 2004 and has worked in cosmetology schools since 2010. She was born and raised in Portland Oregon. Chelsea is very passionate about hair and education and chose this industry because she is a creative person who loves people and helping students find their inspiration and drive for a career. Her favorite part about working with students is watching them become the stylist, esthetician or nail artist they set out to be. She is inspired by all forms of art and draws from many different mediums when creating.\n\nAlysia Read has been a licensed cosmetologist since 1991. After two opportunities to serve on rules advisory committees, she realized that serving on the Board would be a great next step in giving back to the cosmetology community.\n\nAlysia believes that getting to know how an industry grows and shapes itself is key to understanding what it's capable of. She would like to see stylists graduating with a deeper knowledge of all hair types, fundamental skills for assessing toxicity in products and workplaces, and the ability to formulate a strong financial plan for their careers.\n\nOver the years, she has seen excellent stylists exit the industry early due to injury, illness, or the need for a more stable income. Also, interacting closely with humans on a day-to-day basis can sometimes take an emotional toll. While serving on the board, Alysia hopes to find opportunities to further the stylists health, financial well-being, education, and overall happiness with their career. She is grateful for this opportunity to serve.\n\nSara Schilling is a licensed esthetician with over four years of expertise spanning two states. Currently working as a clinical master and advanced esthetician, Sara is deeply passionate about both the art and science of skincare. With a firm belief in the power of education and sustainable business practices, Sara continually seeks to elevate industry standards and foster a culture of diversity and excellence.\n\nBeyond her professional endeavors, Sara is committed to advocating for inclusivity and representation within the beauty community. Recognizing the importance of embracing neurodiversity, she strives to create spaces within the cosmetology industry that welcome individuals from all walks of life.\n\nSara's unwavering dedication to her craft, coupled with her commitment to progressive values, positions her as a valuable asset to the Oregon Board of Cosmetology. She looks forward to contributing her expertise and perspective to further the board's mission of ensuring the highest standards of practice and professionalism within the industry."
