        "text": "What is the BSD License?\n\nThis page shares some examples of a BSD licenses, some details about the BSD license philosophy, and a few links to more information about the BSD license.\n\nSome interesting quotes and comments\n\nBSD license examples\n\nExamples of usage of BSD-licensed code\n\nLinks to other BSD licensing info\n\nThe only requirements of the BSD license are preservation of copyright and a standard disclaimer of liability. Due to its minimal license, BSD software can be freely modified and used in proprietary or commercial software.\n\nMany (usually older) BSD licenses include a clause that said advertising materials must display acknowledgement. In 1999, the Office of Technology Licensing at University of California at Berkeley stated: \"Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to include the acknowledgement within advertising materials. Accordingly, the foregoing paragraph of those BSD Unix files containing it is hereby deleted in its entirety.\" (This applies to UCB-licensed materials.)\n\nAlso some BSD licenses include a clause that restricts the use of the project (or contributors) for endorsing or promoting by-products.\n\nSome interesting quotes and comments\n\nThe NetBSD Goals page says:\n\nIn general, developers pattern their license terms after what's known as the \"Berkeley license.\"\n\nBerkeley-style licenses ... allow people to copy and modify the software, so long as we get name recognition and our names aren't used without our permissions.\n\n[T]he GNU General Public License ... is very different from the Berkeley license.\n\nThe FreeBSD FAQ says:\n\nWe believe that our first and foremost ``mission'' is to provide code to any and all comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets the widest possible use and provides the widest possible benefit.\n\n[W]e ... endeavor to replace such [GPL] software with submissions under the more relaxed BSD copyright whenever possible.\n\nAnd the OpenBSD Policy webpage says:\n\nCopyright law is complex, OpenBSD policy is simple - OpenBSD strives to maintain the spirit of the original Berkeley Unix copyrights.\n\n... software bound by the GPL terms can not be included in the kernel or \"runtime\" of OpenBSD, though software subject to GPL terms may be included as development tools or as part of the system that are \"optional\" as long as such use does not result in OpenBSD as a whole becoming subject to the GPL terms.\n\nKirk McKusick interview:\n\n... Berkeley had what we called \"copycenter,\" which is \"take it down to the copy center and make as many copies as you want.\" You want to go off and do proprietary things with it? Fine, you can do that. You want to keep it out in the Open Source domain? You're welcome to do that as well.\n\nBSD License examples\n\nFrom NetBSD's /usr/src/sys/netinet6/ipsec.c:\n\nCopyright (C) 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998 WIDE Project. All rights reserved.

At its core, Darwin uses BSD.\" (See Darwin below.)\n\nOpen Source\n\nDarwin\n\n\"Darwin is a version of the BSD UNIX operating system ... the BSD license is very open, which has made it easy for us to leverage its compelling core technology to enhance the Mac OS. ... Darwin is simply BSD tweaked in ways we think will help Apple deliver the next great version of the Mac OS.\" (Darwin itself uses the Apple Public Source License.)\n\nLinks to BSD licensing information\n\nThe BSD License Problem\n\nhttp://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html\n\nSome thoughts about BSD from the GNU site.\n\nUCB License Change\n\nftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change"
