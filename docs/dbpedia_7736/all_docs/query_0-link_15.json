And then for those who do use it in derivatives, it becomes like a cancer, the eventual plan being it embraces, extends and extinguishes everything so that those who aim to avoid it may even one day be forced to use it, and therefore they become defeated and eliminated either way. :D\n\nOr if you take a moral high ground like rms, the bsd is basically saying you can be naughty if you want. But the gpl says you can't be naughty, so therefore it's overall gooder, &there4; reason enough to use it. Although I agree this probably ain't practical but I guess the point is that you shouldn't nevertheless be specifically allowing everyone to be naughty if they want. And for organisations like fsf, I guess it isn't completely impractical since they have the sflc.\n\nBSD. I really don't care about anything anyone does with my code unless they claim they made it. In actual fact, I wouldn't be able to stop someone from cloning a repo, compiling some packages and claiming they made them, so maybe I should just be realistic and Creative Commons Zero license everything. I'd still like to think I have some power, so I still do use BSD, regardless of whether I can actually enforce it.\n\nmy website: kaashif.co.uk\n\n(26-11-2014, 02:30 PM)pizzaroll1 Wrote: BSD.

I don't care about that, especially as it annoys me a lot to add a whole rat's tail of CAPITALIZED law prose to my code if I want to use some other people's libraries. If you'll ever find yourself in my position and you don't absolutely need juvenile wordings with slight legal ambiguity, the 0BSD or MIT-0 licenses might be worth a look:\n\nhttps://spdx.org/licenses/0BSD.html#licenseText\n\nhttps://spdx.org/licenses/MIT-0.html#licenseText\n\nI think I'll use these a lot in the future.\n\n--\n\n<mort> choosing a terrible license just to be spiteful towards others is possibly the most tux0r thing I've ever seen\n\n(28-02-2019, 04:28 PM)jkl Wrote: Where is the difference between CC0 and other pseudo-Public Domain licenses?\n\nAs mentioned above, my understanding is that this section is the critical part:\n\nQuote:3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\n\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\n\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\n\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\nSo as compared to Unlicense, for example, you'll ensure that no matter what the actual legal situation is, you'll get as close as possible. Other issues with Unlicense can be found here.\n\nA good sign of being old is if you start to use the CDDL (as I did last week). It combines the troll factor of being incompatible with the GPL with rip-off security as companies need to - at least - state that they use (and closed) your code somewhere.\n\nBackground: On Twitter, someone who did not think about his choices thoroughly enough has complained that Amazon uses his non-attribution licensed code for a new product of theirs without mentioning him. Well, no sympathy here - nobody enforced the license on him. The tweet made me think about licenses again, though, and the CDDL combines the best of both worlds in my opinion, unless I missed a license in my research. I wonâ€™t relicense all of my code now, but I might choose more freely in the future.\n\n--\n\n<mort> choosing a terrible license just to be spiteful towards others is possibly the most tux0r thing I've ever seen\n\n(20-02-2019, 01:53 PM)zge Wrote:\n\n(19-02-2019, 01:10 PM)mrtn Wrote: Most of the times? Unlicense - because I don't care.\n\nYou really shouldn't be using Unlicense. It's vague and problematic in some countries without a public domain in the US sense.\n\nIn many countries you can't give away something to public domain while you are still alive, and even if you could, there are ways to restore your ownership/copyright through the local court. So CC0 is not always applicable, this license will most likely be avoided by the corpo world.\n\nAs for me, I didn't write anything substantial yet, but if I were, I would pick no-license at all. The reason is - I don't want Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, or any other big corporation to use my code in any way or form whatsoever. But I wouldn't care for regular folks like you and me to use it even commercially. I don't think there are license for that.\n\nBig corpo already on top of everything, not paying taxes, not subjects to anti-monopoly laws, with big lobbying power, why, WHY should we help them to gain even more power??? I think it doesn't make sense. BSD is absolutely crazy license, if you are so opinion-less about freedom, rights, justice or anything else, you might as well go and work for free at any big corpo, at least you will get free meal for your code."
