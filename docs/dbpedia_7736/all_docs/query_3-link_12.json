        "text": "BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. This is in contrast to copyleft licenses like the GPL, which have reciprocity share-alike requirements. The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system. The original version has since been revised and its descendants are more properly termed modified BSD licenses.\n\nSee the Wikipedia article on BSD licenses for more information.\n\nSimplified BSD License\n\nThe Simplified BSD (or BSD 2-clause) license is the simplest BSD license. A licensee of BSD-licensed software can:\n\nUse, copy and distribute the unmodified source or binary forms of the licensed program\n\nUse, copy and distribute modified source or binary forms of the licensed program, provided that all distributed copies are accompanied by the license\n\nThe BSD-2 license text can be found at:\n\nSee also\n\nBSD-2 on Open Source Initiative\n\nModified BSD License\n\nThe Modified or New BSD (or BSD 3-clause) license is the same as BSD-2, but with an additional clause prohibiting the names of the authors from being used to endorse or promote products relating to the software.\n\nThe BSD-3 license text can be found at:\n\nSee also"
