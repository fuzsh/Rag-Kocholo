        "text": "Hey folks,\n\ni'm an absolute novice when it comes to freebsd. never installed the base OS. my experience with it is through pfsense. that will change in time however (meaning, when resources become available, i will set up a freebsd box to learn on).\n\nthat being said. BSD is incredible. Hats off to the engineers.\n\nhere's my question; if the xBSD's are open source, in an effort to protect it, why isnt the BSD license amended to be more like the gnu gpl? my reasoning is that there are companies like netgate and opnsense that, while it's great they're huge contributors, they're ultimately creating a product to profit from the work of the original design. Yes, FreeBSD is available to all, however products like pfsense are slowly and quietly going down the path of making it proprietary. I would still want to see Berkley as the custodian and engineer behind it, and to continually scrutinize the source to maintain its excellence, however no one should have the right to take said source and hijack it to be sold as their own for profit. again, it hasn't happened yet, but it's quietly going down that path..\n\nThere are many folks (like me) in the community who are concerned that the xBSDs will ultimately be commandeered by 3rd parties and we'll lose the base product. apparently it's a known fact that microsoft took much of the source of the freeBSD tcp/ip stack and used it in windows NT+..\n\nsorry, very long winded question/rant by a concerned citizen of this community.\n\ncomment?\n\nif the xBSD's are open source, in an effort to protect it, why isnt the BSD license amended to be more like the gnu gpl?\n\nWhy do you think only the GPL can protect it? The BSD license protects it just fine.\n\nthey're ultimately creating a product to profit from the work of the original design.\n\nYes, and they have every right to do that because the BSD license allows this.\n\nI would still want to see Berkley as the custodian and engineer behind it,\n\nBerkeley hasn't been involved in the development of BSD (Free, Open or Net) for many, many years. The FreeBSD foundation owns and maintains FreeBSD;\n\nand to continually scrutinize the source to maintain its excellence\n\nAbout the Foundation | FreeBSD Foundation\n\nWhat is the FreeBSD Foundation? The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3), US based, non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and promoting the FreeBSD Project and community worldwide. Funding comes from individual and corporate donations and is used to fund and manage projects, fund...\n\nhowever no one should have the right to take said source and hijack it to be sold as their own for profit.\n\nKind of limiting isn't it? You know what the cool thing about freedom is? To do whatever you want with it, including taking the code, building a product with it and then selling it.\n\nit hasn't happened yet\n\nAre you sure? Because JunOS (Juniper firewalls/routers) is based on BSD. Cisco's original IOS was based on BSD. Citrix Netscalers are based on BSD. OS-X borrowed many parts from BSD. I can probably name a whole bunch of other products that are (at least partially) based on BSD.\n\nThere are many folks (like me) in the community who are concerned that the xBSDs will ultimately be commandeered by 3rd parties and we'll lose the base product.\n\nThe FreeBSD foundation has a different opinion.\n\nHello & Welcome to this FreeBSD community!\n\nI think SirDice covered this pretty well. I'll just leave a few more remarks here.\n\nThere are many folks (like me) in the community who are concerned that the xBSDs will ultimately be commandeered by 3rd parties and we'll lose the base product.\n\nI'd say exactly the opposite is the case. As far as I can tell (personal opinion), what you're describing is what's happening over in the Linux world. Due to the more restrictive licensing, commercial entities have to resort to other means to gain influence and control. This is heavily showing in both the direction Linux is heading as well as the trend of quality over time.\n\nIn the meantime, BSD licensed products remain unaffected by these corporate measures because they are allowed to just use it for whatever purpose they see fit. There's no need for commercial entities to resort to those measures.\n\nI'd also like to add that plenty of commercial entities which take part(s) of (Free)BSD are heavily contributing back to the code base. Just have a look at the various direct financial sponsorings/fundings and contributed code. Based on my business experience it's also easier for larger entities to put resources back into a BSD licensed project than an (L)GPL licensed project (partly due to legal reasons, partly due to business politics).\n\nThe list is quite long but these include entities like Sony, Nintendo, Netflilx, CISCO, Juniper Networks, iXsystems and many, many more including also many smaller commercial entities.\n\nUsing BSD licensed software for commercial aspects is something I'd consider to be endorsed. It helps to keep projects alive, omits the need for \"questionable measures\" to be employed by commerical/corporate entities and makes the software/projects more stable as a result.\n\nThe day when (Free)BSD changes the licensing to something more restrictive might actually be the day when (Free)BSD is dying for real.\n\nGPL takes over BSD licensed code all the time, then it becomes locked from companies to profit off of.\n\nThe whole thing about opensource licenses seems to be a paradox to me. GPL is too viral, and it contributes to piling on, because there's less motivation to improve things. I also understand the argument that a lot of companies take, but give back very little. I have to think about BSD, ISCL or MIT licenses like water, it's free for everyone, and anyone can drink it, make their own juice out of it, or a company can make a proprietary drink or brand out of it. It makes sense for libraries, backends, small programs, moderately sized programs, software foundations and common applications.\n\nOne problem where GPL isn't how it's made out to be is, a company dual licenses software in GPL, and they are allowed to get all contributions from that piece of code, while others can't. In some cases, that's beneficial to the opensource community, as the company wrote most of it from the beginning, and has a business model that helps other companies. This exception is in the spirit of opensource when a code is dual licensed to be both opensource and proprietary, but other cases aren't in the spirit of GPL-like arguments relating to how companies shouldn't benefit. Another company can dual license an addition to that GPL code which wouldn't be dualy owned by another company. They would benefit from the common GPL code, but keep their own sets which can be used together, to be improved without giving it away.\n\nIt seems like the Apache license is good. I was thinking what if there a clone of LGPL for libraries compatible with LGPL, for the purposes of it be not named containing the acronym \"GPL\". This would be necessary to make it fully compatible with LGPL to not have to have duplicate code which provides the same function for GPL, BSD and other opensource code which relies on it as dependencies. Then, have another license like LGPL, except that it's restricted to be taken over by more restrictive licenses like the GPL, intended for software even parts of software that aren't libraries. It could be linked to by proprietary and opensource code that allows it, but can't be taken over by any of them.\n\nOne thing that was lacking in many opensource licenses was a clause to prevent software from being taken into more restrictive opensource licenses. There were clauses for how to address proprietary: whether to fully allow, restrict it, or to focus on protecting opensource from patent trolls.\n\nI have this worry that there's opensource code, which is in BSD, MIT or ISC, that a proprietary company or GPL will take it, add a literal exclamation point inside the code, and say, opp, you can't use this for the less restrictive opensource license anymore. I realize that they can't really restrict it, because ad minimis can't be copyrighted nor patented. The worry is still there for me, for what's an obvious improvement made under a more restrictive code will prevent the original code license from using.\n\nno one should have the right to take said source and hijack it to be sold as their own for profit\n\nIt seems like BSD-like licensed code gets hijacked a lot by GPL as well as the obvious, proprietary companies. Someone could remind me of an argument that BSD/MIT licenses are made for that, which I somewhat agree on but don't fully agree with. The closet I can come up with allowing free code is in what I wrote above.\n\nEdits: BSD, MIT, ISC licenses make sense for libraries, backends, small programs, moderately sized programs, software foundations and common applications. It also makes sense for programs which aren't too big that 1, 2 or a small group of people are able to write and maintain it. Or also for organizations like Xorg or FreeBSD. Big projects like complex games, they make sense as GPL.\n\nThey obviously don't take the rights away from the original. Though, they did release the exact same code under the GPL. This is easy to get lost, as they preserve the exact code as GPL. The original with the original more free licenses have to be preserved. Many authors already do that, and copyright or maintain the whole code. They hijack the movement to putting everything into some shit SystemD pile. It's still hijacking, and in the form of what was written about in the first post.\n\nI have this worry that there's opensource code, which is in BSD, MIT or ISC, that a proprietary company or GPL will take it, add a literal exclamation point inside the code, and say, opp, you can't use this for the less restrictive opensource license anymore. I realize that they can't really restrict it, because ad minimis can't be copyrighted nor patented. The worry is still there for me, for what's an obvious improvement made under a more restrictive code will prevent the original code license from using.\n\nNo one said, they are allowed to prevent, someone from using the BSD code as it was last written. But in effect, what I said above, is like them doing that, and that will happen if the last original isn't preserved as BSD, which I haven't noticed GPL do for what they use. Maybe they do, but it doesn't seem prioritized at all. Also, they do hijack it in the sense of pulling it in and making it into a SystemD system or other convoluted shit. I feel like you respond to what stands out, and end up ignoring everything else.\n\nNow, it seems that, if GPL is allowed to take BSD-like licensed code, which for many cases I agree with, they should be required to preserve or link to a copy for public access of all of pieces of original BSD code they used. In a customized license, if that copy of sourcecode gets lost by them or the link they use, then that BSD-like code is void for them. In spirit, the BSD license is there, but there's hardly preservation of what wasn't non-GPL by them. It seems like, the BSD stamp gets replaced by the GPL stamp, and the assumption is that because it's opensource, it's ok to not preserve the first stamp as the differentation of the original and the GPL code. The adjusted license can take over all of MIT/BSD/ISC code, just as GPL takes over other code. GPL can use it, but if it's inconvenient, so taking BSD code was convenient.\n\nIt seems like major GPL projects need to have the responsibility of having a GIT repository of all BSD code ever incorporated into GPL code. Github seems to do some of this already, when forks are preserved. GPL isn't required to, but it seems like preserving the last BSD licensed code should be forced by a new license or they'll plainly abandon it, as GPL abandoned/discouraged CDDL, even though it's BSD-like, that they just didn't like it because it was too open for GPL. Such a license couldn't be forced retroactively, however.\n\nhowever no one should have the right to take said source and hijack it to be sold as their own for profit.\n\nFirst off, I'm not attacking your beliefs, just challenging them.\n\nThis sentiment you hold seems endemic in the *linux community, at least from afar. This is primarily because they believe their licensing system is perfection itself; it is not. Why?\n\nThe idea that you can be affronted by a licence for code you did not write baffles me. Truly.\n\nIf I want to release source code in the public domain then why can't I? If someone exploits that code, isn't it purely my choice?\n\nSimilarly, if I want to release the code with a \"all rights reserved\" I could easily do it.\n\nA licence is just that, a licence and BSD-style licences are just permissive in their downstream usage. No matter what someone does with my code, the code belongs to ME. You can take it, put it with some proprietary code but you never own the code. You cannot remove the licence from it because it says not to. Ultimately, people trust others to do the correct thing. They may not, but ultimately, we don't really care because it's BSD-style.\n\nagain, it hasn't happened yet, but it's quietly going down that path..\n\nIt has happened. There's plenty of examples, some not public, where software from FreeBSD (and indeed Net and Open) have been used to make everything from customised server platforms to embedded systems. Often code is not returned upstream, but, this is part of having a permissive licence.\n\nCheers\n\nFynin Hxenvar"
