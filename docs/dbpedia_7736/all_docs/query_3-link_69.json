        "text": "US businesses across all industries have a variety of software options to choose from. However, with the different types of software licenses, it may be difficult to make cost comparisons.\n\nYour business requires various software, such as human resource management (HRM) systems to manage your IT infrastructure and employees, or customer relationship management (CRM) systems to provide the best user experience to your clients and customers.\n\nHowever, the usage of software requires the initiation of software licenses and for you to agree to the software licensing terms and conditions.\n\nTo ensure legal compliance, it is integral you understand the types of software licenses, their terms, associated costs, and limits before purchasing any software for your organization.\n\nSoftware Licenses Explained: What Are Software Licenses?\n\nA software license is an agreement between the software creators and the end user, which in this case, is your business. Software licenses protect the source code of the software and place limitations on how the program can be used.\n\nSoftware licenses include:\n\nInstallation rights\n\nDistribution rights\n\nWarranties\n\nLiabilities\n\nThis text document is very meticulous and serves the main purpose of protecting intellectual property and the legal rights of the software developer. The best way to ensure you have understood a software license properly and to get help with software license management is by getting in touch with an IT professional who can examine and break down the details for you.\n\nYou’re Probably Paying 29% Too Much for Your Software\n\nLet us help you identify and eliminate wasted IT spending\n\nGet Started\n\nHow Do Software Licenses Work?\n\nWhen you purchase licensed software for your business, you enter an end-user license agreement (EULA) with the software provider.\n\nThis contract establishes the rules that must be followed by your organization when operating the software. The EULA will outline when the agreement becomes active, the duration of the agreement, and the terms of the cancellation of the agreement as well. Details regarding charges and billing per user will also generally be included in the software license EULA.\n\nBreaching the terms of a software license will violate copyright law and can land your business in hot water with the law, so you should make it a priority to understand the software license details before purchasing it.\n\nSoftware License Fees Models\n\nThe fee developers charge you to use their software will depend on the user and payment structure of the subscription software.\n\nThere are various user and payment structures available for subscription software, including:\n\nUser-Based\n\nIn a user-based or per-user pricing model, the software developer will charge your business for every user of your product. The greater the number of users you have, the more the developer will charge. User-based licensing pricing models may charge your business based on every user downloading the software or for every user who actively uses the software.\n\nIf you have several employees who each require their own personal login credentials and heavily rely on the software, then this may be a good choice for you. These licenses sometimes come as concurrent user licenses where you are charged for the number of users using the system at the same time rather than for all the users that access the system.\n\nUsage-Based (Pay-As-You-Go)\n\nThe usage-based pricing model or consumption model offers a variable pricing option. With this form of pricing, you will be given a base rate and then charged an additional rate based on the amount of usage your business gets from the software.\n\nIf you expect your usage of the software to vary over time, and you have the resources to thoroughly monitor the usage, this may be a good option for your business.\n\nFlat-Rate\n\nFlat-rate pricing models offer a fixed price for all the features the software offers. With this billing method, your business will be charged the same amount every time a billing cycle is complete. This is a good option for companies who don’t need software with many features and who want more predictable costs.\n\nAnother ‘flat-rate’ pricing model is the perpetual license, where you only have to pay for the software once (typically upfront). Though the software is ‘yours’ to use without further charge, the EULA still applies.\n\nAside from various user and payment structures, there are also different types of software licenses for you to choose from.\n\nDifferent Types of Software Licenses\n\nSoftware classified as public domain or private unlicensed software is not covered by software licenses. However, software that is licensed is generally either classified as free and open source software (FOSS) or proprietary software (closed source).\n\nFOSS and proprietary software are very different but they both cover the responsibilities, limitations, liabilities, warranties, and disclaimers regarding the usage of the program.\n\nFOSS Licenses\n\nAccording to research by RedHat, enterprise businesses are increasingly using open-source software to meet their operational needs. This license type is a great option for your businesses if you want to personalize software for your specific organization’s needs.\n\nThe downside of FOSS is that support and troubleshooting largely fall on you to manage. Because this type of software does not generate revenue, support from developers will be limited and fixes will come in the form of patches built by other users.\n\nProprietary Software Licenses\n\nProprietary licenses are not as flexible, and they usually only come with an operational code ― not a source code that can be altered at will. This is a better option for your business if you find software that fits your business perfectly and you do not want to reverse engineer it to better suit your business goals.\n\nThe main types of open-source software licenses include:\n\nCopyleft Licenses\n\nCopyleft licenses are known as restrictive licenses. These licenses allow you to alter the code and even distribute the changed software product as long as you distribute the source code of the new works under the same software license. This clause often leads organizations to refrain from using such licenses since they do not want their competitors to get access to their software code. Some licenses such as the MPL also contain patent grants and others such as AGPL are only triggered when the software is being distributed.\n\nThe available copyleft licenses include:\n\nGNU General Public License (GPL)\n\nLesser General Public Licenses (LGPL)\n\nMozilla Public License (MPL)\n\nAffero GPL (AGPL)\n\nEclipse Public License (EPL)\n\nPermissive Licenses\n\nPermissive licenses are also known as attribution-style licenses. Unlike copyleft licenses, permissive licenses place only a minimal number of restrictions on how the software can be used, altered, and distributed. In most cases, permissive licenses will only require you to include the copyright information in a file when you are distributing the software. Some permissive licenses like the Apache license also include a patent grant, while others include multiple clauses such as the BSD license.\n\nThe most common permissive licenses include:\n\nMIT License\n\nBerkeley Source Distribution (BSD) License\n\nApache License\n\nDual Software Licenses\n\nIn some cases, software developers choose dual licensing in which they use both an open source license as well as a commercial license. This is done so the open source license grants you easy access to the code, but if you want to profit from the software, you will need to step up and obtain a commercial license.\n\nWhat Software Do You Need For Your Business?\n\nLet our professional technicians advise you on the best software blend to optimize your business processes.\n\nGet in Touch With Us Today\n\nWhat Do I Need to Know About Software Licenses?
