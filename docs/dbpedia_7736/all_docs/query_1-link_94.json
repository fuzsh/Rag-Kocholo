        "text": "Spots : Spots are typically brown or red skin lesions including freckles, acne scars, hyper-pigmentation and vascular lesions. Spots are distinguishable by their distinct color and contrast from the background skin tone. Spots vary in size and generally have a circular shape.\n\nPores : Pores are the circular surface openings of sweat gland ducts. Due to shadowing, pores appear darker than the surrounding skin tone and are identified by their darker color and circular shape. The VISIA system distinguishes pores from spots based on size; by definition, the area of a pore is much smaller than a spot.\n\nWrinkles : Wrinkles are furrows, folds or creases in the skin, which increase in occurrence as a result of sun exposure, and are associated with decreasing skin elasticity. This skin feature has the greatest variability from image to image as it is highly dependent upon the facial expression of the client. Wrinkles are identified by their characteristic long, narrow shape.\n\nTexture :Texture is primarily an analysis of skin smoothness. Texture measures skin color and smoothness by identifying gradations in color from the surrounding skin tone, as well as peaks (shown in yellow) and valleys (shown in blue) on the skin surface that indicate variations in the surface texture.\n\nPorphyrins : Porphyrins are bacterial excretions that can become lodged in pores and lead to acne. Porphyrins fluoresce in UV light and exhibit circular white spot characteristics.\n\nUV Spots : UV spots occur when melanin coagulates below the skin surface as a result of sun damage. UV spots are generally invisible under normal lighting conditions. The selective absorption of the UV light by the epidermal melanin enhances its display and detection by VISIA.\n\nRed Areas : Red Areas represent a potential variety of conditions, such as acne, inflammation, Rosacea or spider veins. Blood vessels and hemoglobin contained in the papillary dermis, a sub-layer of skin, give these structures their red color, which is detected by the RBX Technology in VISIA. Acne spots and inflammation vary in size but are generally round in shape. Rosacea is usually larger and diffuse compared to acne, and spider veins usually are short, thin and can be interconnected in a dense network.\n\nBrown spots\\ : Brown Spots are lesions on the skin such as hyper-pigmentation, freckles, lentigines, and melasma. Brown Spots occur from an excess of Melanin. Melanin is produced by melanocytes in the bottom layer of the epidermis. Brown Spots produce an uneven appearance to the skin, and are detected in VISIA by RBX.\n\nThree data display options are available depending upon the needs and preferences of the practice, and can either be selected from within VISIA's Session Options tab or by right clicking on any data display bar or graph.\n\nFeature Counts : Feature Counts provide a count of the number of discrete instances of the feature being evaluated, without regard to the size or intensity of each instance. Feature Counts can be used to track treatment progress when a reduction in the number of discrete instances of a particular feature is desired.\n\nAbsolute Scores : Absolute Scores provide a comprehensive measurement of the impact that the feature has on the client's complexion. Absolute Scores factor in the total size and area as well as intensity of detected instances of the feature being analyzed. Absolute Scores can be used to track treatment progress when the size and intensity of instances of a feature are the most relevant indicator of treatment effectiveness.\n\nPercentiles : Percentiles provide a context in which to evaluate a client's complexion analysis results by presenting a comparison of the individual's Absolute Scores to those of people with similar characteristics. Percentiles are useful in providing a baseline assessment of the overall condition of the client's complexion.\n\nThere are several potential reasons why the porphyrin count for a particular patient may not be reduced-or worse case, increase, after cleansing his/her skin. First, certain types of paper/tissue that might have been used to dry the face after cleansing could have a high content of lint particles. Lint will actually fluoresce under UV light. Subject matter expert Greg Hillebrand, Ph.D., offers the further explanation that \"in some situations, the true porphyrin fluorescence of an initial image could be quenched by something that the subject had on his/her unclean face, and then after removal of this interfering quenching agent, a higher level of fluorescence could be observed. Finally, the simple cleansing of the skin with a normal everyday facial cleanser is probably not going to change the true number of pores that show porphyrin fluorescence. It has been reported that washing with a cleanser containing benzoyl peroxide will, over time, reduce the number of pores. Also, using strips or other devices to physically remove the contents of the pores will help to reduce the fluorescence as well.\"\n\nAccording to subject matter expert Greg Hillebrand, Ph.D., there may be a real correlation between the amount of porphyrins and skin aging as described in the following technical excerpt that offers the best understanding we have today on the matter: \"In pilosebaceous follicles, porphyrins are produced by propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) that are normal inhabitants of the human skin and the pilosebaceous ducts. Porphyrins are highly fluorescent pores containing P. acnes and the associated porphyrins appear red-orange when facial skin is illuminated with long wavelength UVA radiation. The intensity of the follicular fluorescence and its extent of facial involvement is known to be proportional to the density of P. acnes. Porphyrin fluorescence appears first on the nose and chin, and then increases in incidence through adulthood and declines after the age of 50, possibly reflecting the rate of sebum secretion. Porphyrins may also have cytotoxic and comedogenic potential. With exposure to the sun, porphyrins can release singlet oxygen that in turn can oxidize lipids (lipid peroxidation) in the skin yielding irritating and cytotoxic lipid peroxides that can cause skin damage. Thus, the presence of porphyrins in the follicular pores may enhance or accelerate hyperpigmentation, wrinkling and other signs of photo-aging by sun exposure.\""
