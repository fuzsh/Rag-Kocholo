        "text": "How to cut down on saturated fat\n\nHere are some practical tips to help you specifically cut down on saturated fat.\n\nAt the shops\n\nNutrition labels on the front and back of packaging can help you cut down on saturated fat. Look out for \"saturates\" or \"sat fat\" on the label.\n\nHigh: More than 5g saturates per 100g. May be colour-coded red.\n\nMedium: Between 1.5g and 5g saturates per 100g. May be colour-coded amber.\n\nLow: 1.5g saturates or less per 100g. May be colour-coded green.\n\nAim to choose products with green or amber for saturated fat.\n\nThere can be a big difference in saturated fat content between similar products.\n\nChoose the food that's lower in saturated fat. Serving sizes can vary too, so make sure you're comparing like for like. The easiest way to do this is by looking at the nutritional content per 100g.\n\nAt home\n\nSpaghetti bolognese: use a lower-fat mince, as it's lower in saturated fat. If you're not using lower-fat mince, brown the mince first, then drain off the fat before adding other ingredients. Alternatively, mix meat mince with a meat-free mince alternative.\n\nPizza: choose a lower-fat topping, such as vegetables, chicken, tuna and other seafood instead of extra cheese or cured meats like pepperoni, salami and bacon.\n\nFish pie: use reduced-fat spread and skimmed milk to reduce the fat in the mash and sauce.\n\nChilli: use lower-fat mince or mix in a meat-free mince alternative. Or, make a vegetarian chilli using mixed beans, some lentils and vegetables. Beans and lentils can count towards your 5 A Day, too.\n\nChips: choose thick, straight-cut chips instead of french fries or crinkle-cut to reduce the surface area exposed to fat. If you're making your own, cook them in the oven with a little vegetable oil and the skins on, rather than deep frying.\n\nPotatoes: make your roast potatoes healthier by cutting them into larger pieces than usual and using just a little sunflower or olive oil.\n\nMashed potato: use reduced-fat spread instead of butter, and skimmed milk instead of whole or semi-skimmed milk.\n\nChicken: go for leaner cuts, such as chicken breast. Before you eat it, take the skin off to reduce the saturated fat content.\n\nBacon: choose back bacon instead of streaky bacon, which contains more fat. Grill instead of frying.\n\nEggs: prepare eggs without oil or butter. Poach, boil or dry fry your eggs.\n\nPasta: try a tomato-based sauce on your pasta. It's lower in saturated fat than a creamy or cheesy sauce.\n\nMilk: use skimmed milk on your cereal and in hot drinks. It has about half the saturated fat of semi-skimmed.\n\nCheese: when using cheese to flavour a dish or sauce, try a strong-tasting cheese, such as reduced-fat mature cheddar, as you'll need less. Make cheese go further by grating instead of slicing it.\n\nYoghurt: choose a lower-fat and lower-sugar yoghurt. There can be a big difference between different products, so check the nutrition label.\n\nEating out\n\nTips to help you cut down on saturated fat when eating out.\n\nCoffee: swap large whole milk coffee for regular \"skinny\" ones. Avoid adding cream on top.\n\nCurry: go for dry or tomato-based dishes, such as tandoori or madras, instead of creamy curries like korma, pasanda or masala. Choose plain rice and chapatti instead of pilau rice and naan.\n\nKebabs: go for a shish kebab with pitta bread and salad rather than a doner kebab.\n\nChinese: choose a lower-fat dish, such as steamed fish, chicken chop suey or szechuan prawns.\n\nThai: try a stir-fried or steamed dish containing chicken, fish or vegetables. Watch out for curries that contain coconut milk, which is high in saturated fat. If you choose one of these, try not to eat all the sauce.\n\nSnack time: swap foods high in sugar, salt and fat, such as chocolate, doughnuts and pastries, for:"
