        "text": "What Is Price Skimming?\n\nPrice skimming is a pricing strategy in which a company starts by charging the highest price that customers will pay. Over time, the company lowers the price to reach different types of customers. Initially, the high price targets early adopters willing to pay more for a new product. As these early customers are satisfied and competitors enter the market, the company reduces prices to attract more price-sensitive consumers.\n\n\"Price skimming\" originates from \"skimming\" layers, like removing successive layers of cream from the top of milk. Unlike penetration pricing, which starts with a low price to attract a large customer base quickly, price skimming leverages initial high prices to maximize early profits before adjusting to more competitive levels.\n\nHow Price Skimming Works\n\nPrice skimming is often used when a new product type enters the market. The goal is to gather as much revenue as possible while high consumer demand and competition haven't entered the market.\n\nThis approach works well for products with a high perceived value or innovative features, where early adopters are less sensitive to price. Initially targeting these consumers, companies can recover their investment quickly and generate significant early profits. Once the market becomes more saturated with competitors, lowering the price helps capture a broader audience and maintain market share.\n\nKey factors for effective price skimming include understanding the product's life cycle, projected demand, and the competitive landscape. High demand allows for higher initial prices, while increased competition necessitates price adjustments.\n\nThis approach contrasts with the penetration pricing model, which focuses on releasing a lower-priced product to grab as much market share as possible. This technique is generally better suited for lower-cost items, such as basic household supplies, where price may be a driving factor in most customers' production selections.\n\nFirms often use price skimming to recover development costs and in situations where:\n\nEnough prospective customers are willing to buy the product at a high price.\n\nThe high price doesn't attract competitors.\n\nLowering the price would have only a minor effect on increasing sales volume and reducing unit costs.\n\nThe high price is interpreted as a sign of high quality.\n\nFor new products, like innovative home technology, a high initial price can signal quality and exclusivity. This attracts early adopters willing to spend more and can generate valuable word-of-mouth marketing.\n\nPrice Skimming Example\n\nOne of the most common examples of price skimming is the launch of Apple's iPhone. When Apple introduces a new iPhone model, it tends to set a high initial price to target early adopters willing to pay a premium for the latest technology. However, as demand from this segment is met and newer iPhone models are released, Apple gradually lowers the price of the older models to attract more price-sensitive customers.\n\nThis strategy allows Apple to maximize early revenue from a new product and gradually expand its market reach without alienating different customer segments. By lowering prices over time, Apple can remain competitive and continues to generate sales throughout the product's life cycle.\n\nPrice Skimming Limits\n\nGenerally, the price skimming model is best used for a short time, allowing the early adopter market to become saturated but not alienating price-conscious buyers over the long term. If the price isn't reduced promptly, consumers may turn to cheaper competitors, resulting in lost sales and revenue.\n\nPrice skimming may also be less effective for any competitor's follow-up products. For example, once the initial market of early adopters has purchased the latest gaming console, other buyers may not purchase a competing product at a higher price without significant improvements over the original.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPrice skimming sets high initial prices for new, innovative products to target early adopters, then lowers prices over time to attract more budget-conscious buyers. This approach maximizes early profits and helps recover development costs, as seen with Apple's iPhone. However, timing is critical; for example, delaying price cuts can drive customers to competitors.\n\nThough effective, price skimming works best for highly innovation products or products with a high perceived value. It's less successful for follow-up competitor products because the early adopter market may already be saturated."
