        "text": "There are certain commonly used open-source licenses that are often applied to software that has been made available in source code form to the public for free. Those licenses fall into two general categories: “permissive” licenses and “copyleft” licenses.\n\nPopular “permissive” licenses include:\n\nApache License 2.0\n\nBSD 2-Clause “Simplified” or “FreeBSD” license\n\nBSD 3-Clause “New” or “Revised” license\n\nMIT license\n\nThese commonly used permissive open-source licenses typically impose few restrictions and requirements on licensees, and permit them to use the permissively licensed open-source software in products made available in executable form or over the internet that are subject to proprietary (i.e., non-open source) license agreements. Many open-source licenses, even permissive ones, include attribution requirements.\n\nPopular “copyleft” licenses include:\n\nGNU General Public License (GPL)\n\nGNU Library or “Lesser” General Public License (LGPL)\n\nMozilla Public License 2.0\n\nCommon Development and Distribution License (CDDL)\n\nIn contrast to permissive licenses, these commonly used copyleft licenses generally allow licensees to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute open-source software, but there’s a catch: all distributions of the original open-source software, and all modifications to that software, must be provided in source code form and under the terms of the copyleft open-source license. In the open-source context, “distribution” generally refers to transferring a copy of the open-source software outside of your company (e.g., as embedded in hardware, or in software applications that are intended to run locally on a user’s machine).\n\nUnder some commonly used copyleft licenses (e.g., GPL version 2), when copyleft open-source software is distributed and that copyleft code integrates or interoperates with your proprietary code in certain ways, that proprietary code is deemed subject to the terms of the copyleft open-source license and must be made available in source code form. Some of these particularly onerous copyleft licenses even treat copyleft open-source software used over a network (e.g., on a software-as-a-service basis) as a distribution that could require proprietary code to be subject to the terms of the copyleft open-source license and made available in source code form."
