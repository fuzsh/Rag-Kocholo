        "text": "The terms of BSD say that contributors to BSD 3 Clause-licensed code cannot be held liable for any damages resulting from modifications or updates to the original work. In addition, any person or company that makes use of code licensed under BSD 3 is prohibited from using the name of the project or its contributors to promote their derivative work without written permission. In fact, this is the subject of the titular third clause of the BSD 3-Clause License.\n\nwhat is bsd-3-clause\n\nDownload Zip ⚙⚙⚙ https://urllio.com/2zNx6V\n\nAn important note: Open source licenses generally have deprecated advertising clauses. So, if you find code under a license with an advertising clause, you may want to consider whether it is up-to-date and secure.\n\nFinally, the 0-Clause BSD License does not require users to include the license text or copyright notice in their copy or modification of the code. In other words, it has no requirements whatsoever, making it a public-domain-equivalent license.\n\nThere are several reasons why open source authors and users alike might select the BSD 3-Clause License for their OSS project. These reasons also apply to the other commonly used BSD license variant, the BSD 2-Clause License, with the exception of anything related to the non-endorsement clause. (The non-endorsement clause is not part of the BSD 2-Clause License.)\n\nRich text editor Quill licenses its software under the BSD 3. Another example is key/value store levelDB, created by Googlers Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat. A third is the JavaScript library D3.js, which is used to create dynamic data visualizations.\n\nWhile the BSD-3-Clause is well known and thoroughly discussed here and elsewhere, I have been unable to find much information on precisely how the additional patent stipulation in the BSD-3-Clause-Clear might change the license terms (if at all).\n\nMy understanding was that it added additional protections to BSD-3 licence against potential malicious patent bullying/trolls. As in, if you use or modify code licensed under the BSD-3-Clause-Clear, you would not be able to patent that modified code (and by extension, enforce that patent against other derivations or contributors).\n\nThere have been some great threads here explaining what exactly is meant by \"express grant of patent rights\" clauses in licenses (notably Apache 2.0), but I still have trouble understanding what patent rights mean.\n\nInventions protected by patents can have a software component (or in some cases be completely covered by software). The additional text in the BSD-3-Clause-Clear license makes it explicit that if the software is also covered by a patent, then everybody must request a separate patent license from the patent holder to be able to use the software.\n\nThis is no different from the regular BSD-3-Clause license, although there it is possible to use a defense when you are sued for patent infringement that there could have been an implied patent license.\n\nThe situation is the exact opposite of the patent clause in the Apache 2.0 license. The Apache 2.0 license grants you a patent license in addition to the copyright license, while the BSD-3-Clause-Clear license makes it explicit that there is no such combined license.\n\nI found some discussions, stating \"it is possible\", others say \"no\". Most of the \"no\" were for commercial projects. Most of the \"yes\" are referring to: \"include BSD in GPLv3\", but that's not what I mean. I want GPLv3 along with BSD.\n\nWell, I don't know where your problem is, however next to keeping your code under BSD you could also dual-license it under GPL which will help you to keep headaches out on your end if licensing causes you some and you don't want to consult a lawyer on your behalf.\n\nThat done you can keep all your code under BSD (next to having it GPL) to also full-fill requirements to distribute GPL'ed parts with it. You can do that by making clear to users who contribute code that they contribute it under both licenses.\n\nUsers who don't want to have a GPL'ed package can just remove any GPL'ed parts and only use the parts under BSD. Just make clear with your dual licensing model is not conjunctive (GPL and BSD) but disjunctive (GPL or BSD) for the files you keep under dual licensing.\n\nThis would also help you with the problem offering a software package on Github containing GPL'ed software not under the GPL - which is what I see you right now doing with the Github hosting platform (it has automatic packaging).\n\nSkim over FSF's GPL compatible licenses and you'll see a range of commentary about how well a particular license can fold into the GPL. And yes, by compatible, what FSF really means is how easily can you combine two works and release the resultant work as a GPL'd work. It's obviously a bit self-serving, but at least you can better understand the ramifications to your project when you combine it with a GPL'd project.\n\n6. Some portion of the software package may contain software subject to Open Source Terms (as defined below) applicable for each such portion (Open Source Software?), as further specified in the software package. Such Open Source Software is supplied under the applicable Open Source Terms and is not subject to the terms and conditions of license hereunder. Open Source Terms? shall mean any open source license which requires as part of distribution of software that the source code of such software is distributed therewith or otherwise made available, or open source license that substantially complies with the Open Source definition specified at www.opensource.org and any other comparable open source license such as for example GNU General Public License (GPL), Eclipse Public License (EPL), Apache Software License, BSD license and MIT license.\n\n2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nGenerally speaking, and this is important to know, you should always find a link to the license document applicable to any SW package directly on its corresponding webpage. Individual SW components license terms are either embedded directly into the release notes of said components (found in the actual local copies of the packages), or provided through a link to the original document.\n\nHALs are distributed under the 3-clause BSD license, and that means you are free to do pretty much anything with them as long as you propagate the copyright and don't use ST and contributors' names for commercial endorsement or promotion.\n\nAs advertised on arm's website, all CMSIS SW components are under the business-friendly Apache 2.0 license. It is a bit less permissive than BSD, and you should for example pay attention to the clauses regarding redistribution as they are a bit more developed (for example item #4).\n\nRegarding BLE, we have several packages on our website offering a BLE stack, so I will assume here that you are using X-CUBE-BLE1 as a basis. This package is distributed under SLA0077. In a (big) nutshell, it mentions that you sometimes have to refer individual SW components licenses to get all the details, but the most important item is the usage restriction to ST devices only (STM32, BlueNRG-1,...).\n\nFinally, FreeRTOS is now distributed under the business-friendly MIT license following its buyout by Amazon. Quite simple here as you can do pretty much whatever you wish as long as you propagate the copyright and license terms.\n\nAs I embarked into doing an open-source project, among the first things to decide is what kind of open-source license should it have. After reading a lot of materials, I will write here my recommendations and also some reviews of the most used licenses in open-source projects.\n\nI would choose Apache License 2 for a finite project which can be installed directly and used. Think about something like a full web app, or a desktop application. This is because it can create trust in installing the application and using it without any concern about patents.\n\nI would choose the MIT License for plugins, gems, packages, libraries. Think about Nodejs packages or Ruby gems. I recommend this because MIT License is easier to understand (can be read in a minute), and thus more developers will use the creation, and it is used a lot in the community.\n\nThere is a risk specifically for the developer that someone might take the code and use it in an unintended way (including making it part of a proprietary, non-open source software), and there is no legal ground to stop that.\n\nA permissive license whose main conditions require preservation of copyright and license notices. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.\n\n4a15465005"
