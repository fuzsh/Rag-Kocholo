        "text": "Español | Kreyòl Ayisyen\n\nAffidavit of Fraudulent Use of an EBT Card\n\nIf your Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits were stolen due to skimming and/or cloning, you can take action to determine if you are potentially eligible for reimbursement. Individuals who believe their benefits were stolen on or after October 1, 2022, will need to file a claim with the Department.\n\nChecking your EBT history online or by downloading the FIS ebtEDGE mobile app (available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store). Or\n\nCalling the toll-free EBT Customer Service line at (888) 356-3281.\n\nPlease note, if you have been skimmed and have not reported your EBT card lost or stolen, your account is likely still at risk. No replacement benefits may be issued until you have reported your compromised EBT card lost or stolen. To report your card stolen, request a new card, and change your PIN, please call EBT Customer Service at (888) 356-3281.\n\nPlease note that only SNAP benefits stolen on or after October 1, 2022, are potentially eligible for reimbursement. If your SNAP benefit case is closed but the benefits were stolen when your case was open, you may still be eligible for reimbursement.\n\nThe Department will review your claim within 10 business days of receipt. If your claim is approved, the stolen benefits will be reimbursed, either the exact amount stolen or the equivalent of two months of SNAP benefits before the theft, whichever is less. Once your claim is validated, the benefits will be available for use on your Electronic Benefit Transfer card the following day.\n\nPlease fill out the below form in its entirety.\n\nIndicates required field\n\nHousehold Information\n\nFLORIDA Case Number\n\nYour case number has ten digits and start with a 1.
