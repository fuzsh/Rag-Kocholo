        "text": "Dunes - Help us protect them\n\nThe dunes, which are the mounds of sand on the landward side of the beach, are the barriers that protect properties from high tides and storm surges. Many of the dunes rely on vegetation to stay in place as both wind and sea work at relocating them. For this reason, there is one over-riding rule pertaining to the dunes: Please stay off the dunes! It’s the law in Cocoa Beach and in every other beach along the Atlantic Coast.\n\nBeach Regulations\n\nWe ask that you enjoy the beach. And if you find that previous visitors have not been as courteous, your assistance in picking up the beach would be very much appreciated. It’s an activity that most local beach-goers practice. Here are rules necessary to maintain our beautiful natural resource - the beach:\n\nDog-Friendly Beach Information\n\nDogs are allowed only at the designated beach area with the following conditions:\n\nBetween 4th Street South to the north side of Murkshe Park.\n\nDog must on a 10 ft. leash (maximum length of the leash) at all times\n\nTo access dog beach you must be located in the dog beach area. You may not walk along the beach to get to the dog beach.\n\nAllowable times for dogs to be on the beach are:\n\n6:00 am-10:00 am\n\n4:00 pm- 7:00 pm during standard time\n\n5:00 pm - 9:00 pm during daylight savings time.\n\nOwners must clean up after their dog. There are pet disposal stations located at each crossover from 4th Street South to the Northside of Murkshe Park\n\nPlease keep dogs off dunes and away from turtle nests.\n\nViolation may result in a $50.00 fine.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The dog park at Lori Wilson Park is open but NO dogs are allowed outside the fenced enclosure or on the beach at this location.\n\nGeneral Beach Rules\n\nFires are only allowed on the beach with a permit, allowed in certain areas of the City during certain times of the year. No open fires, including any type of charcoal. View more information on our Beach Fire Burn Permits page.\n\nNo Fireworks on the beach.\n\nNO Glass on the beach.\n\nNo Holes - for safety reasons, please do not dig large holes.\n\nNo camping.\n\nLeave only your footprints - leave no trash or cigarette butts on the beach.\n\nTurtles, Turtle Nests, or Turtle Hatchlings - please do not disturb\n\nSea turtles are an endangered species, if you are lucky enough to see a turtle come ashore, give it very wide berth, do not shine a flashlight or use a flash camera.\n\nNesting and hatching season in Florida extends from March 1 through October 31.\n\nIdeally, lighting should remain off throughout the night during this period. Light sources remaining on until 11 PM will still affect about one third of the hatchlings emerging from nests on a given night.\n\nStranded Marine Mammals - please do not push back to sea\n\nFrom time-to-time, large sea mammals such as whales, manatees and dolphins may beach themselves. If you happen onto the scene of a beaching:\n\nCall the Cocoa Beach Police Department at 321-868-3251 and request them to call Sea World\n\nTry to keep the mammal comfortable by pouring sea water over the exposed skin and keep it shielded from the suns rays by covering it with wet towels until Sea World officials arrive.\n\nSurfcasting\n\nFishing from the beach, known as surfcasting, is a popular sport in Cocoa Beach. Year round, many varieties of fish may be caught from the beach. Both residents and non-residents must have a license in order to surf fish in Florida.\n\nGeneral saltwater fishing license is paid\n\nResidents can obtain a free license that they can use only for shore fishing.\n\nDo not fish where people are swimming."
