        "text": "The person who told you about reverse engineering is incorrect. There are no open-source licenses that explicitly allow the recipient of a binary distribution to reverse engineer the code, especially not code that wasn't distributed under an open-source license.\n\nOpen-source licenses come on a spectrum, ranging from permissive to weak copyleft to strong copyleft. The common denominator for open-source licenses is that they give people who receive the code under the terms of an open-source license the right to make changes and to re-distribute the code with or without changes.\n\nPermissive licenses, like MIT and BSD, are written with the idea to give the direct recipient of the code a lot of freedom, including the freedom to re-distribute the code under a closed-source license. The simple fact that you received something under, for example, the MIT license, does not imply in any way that the recipient of your product gets any modification rights.\n\nStrong copyleft licenses, like GPL and AGPL, have the requirement that if one part of a project is subject to the license, then the complete project must be provided under the terms of the same strong copyleft license. Those terms also include a requirement to provide source code, so reverse engineering of a binary should not be needed. The aim of these licenses is to give as much freedom as possible to the end-users.\n\nWeak copyleft licenses, like LGPL and MPL, are a bit of a middle ground. Code that you received or placed under a weak copyleft license needs to remain under the copyleft license and source code must be provided for those parts. But the license also allows the copyleft part to be combined with closed-source parts. The LGPL is the strongest of these licenses with its requirement that the end-user must be able to use the product with a modified version of the LGPL parts. If you don't pay attention during development, this requirement can force you to disclose object code of the closed source portions, so the end-user can re-link them to the LGPL portions. Reverse engineering of the closed-source parts is still not allowed.\n\nTo be complete, the law may permit reverse engineering for certain purposes. Those you cannot prevent or forbid with your license terms. This is independent of what 3rd-party components you use and what licenses they have.\n\nFor example, in the EU it is by law allowed to do limited forms of reverse engineering to provide interoperability between products of different vendors.\n\nI don't disagree with Bart's answer, but I'd like to come at the question from a different direction.\n\nReverse-engineering is not generally per se illegal. Different jurisdictions have different degrees of protection/proscription for it, some of which are outlined on Wikipedia.\n\nSome jurisdictions, notably the US, maintain that it's not a violation of copyright, but if the licence requires that you not do it, doing so can be a breach of the licence terms. Hence, many proprietary software licences require you to agree not to do it in order to purchase a software licence. The EU, on the other hand, specifically protects the right; this from Article 5 of directive 2009/24/EC:\n\nThe person having a right to use a copy of a computer program shall be entitled, without the authorisation of the rightholder, to observe, study or test the functioning of the program in order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program if he does so while performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program which he is entitled to do.\n\nFree software takes a different path. One of the four freedoms is the \"freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish\", and moreover \"access to the source code is a precondition for this\". So free software not only protects your right to reverse-engineer, but seeks to bend over backwards so you won't need to. You are not, therefore, going to find any kind of free licence that restricts reverse-engineering.\n\nIn answer to your specific question: if you take code released under a permissive free licence (which includes MIT and BSD3) and incorporate it into a product, and you licence that product under proprietary terms which forbid reverse-engineering, then those users in jurisdictions where that right is not otherwise protected will be (at least theoretically) in breach of the terms of the licence should they do so, and further (unlicensed) use of the code would arguably be a violation of your copyright."
