Just today, I have put my card to use again. Another horse, another emergency and another vet bill. I will be mailing the statement and the card number to my vet in the next mail. It has helped me when things were tight especially with my horses. They can always seem to get into trouble in a hurry.\n\nRead story\n\n\"I am so thankful for Care Credit. Because of you, I was blessed to be able to have skin removal surgery after large weight loss. I was able to have a mini tummy tuck, brachioplasty, medial thigh lift and extensive liposuction . I would never have been able to do this on my own without being able to finance part of my surgeries(3). These surgeries were not out of vanity but a need because after losing over 100 pounds, I was still having to buy clothing to accommodate the skin, not my new size!\n\nRead story\n\n\"I can't say enough about Care Credit. This company has been such a blessing to my family. My teenage son needed glasses and we had no insurance. About $600 for 2 pairs that he desperately needed because he had been using the same pair for 3 years. He is in the marching band at high school and practices 3 hours a day and 10-12 hours on Saturdays for competition. He needed them badly to be able to hit his marks on the field. Thank you Care Credit for helping me support my son. Love to you all!\n\nRead story\n\n\"Due to measles as a child, I've lived with only 30% of my hearing. Now, thanks to CareCredit, I have a set of the most incredible hearing aids! Calls to my cell phone come directly into my ears. I can watch a television show into my hearing aids without disrupting the household! I can hear my little dog's Ewok squeaks for the first time! This new technology, previously unaffordable, was only available to me because of CareCredit. Thank you so much for every new sound.\n\nRead story\n\n\"For sometime, I had to make tough choices on which health issues I could afford to address first, second, and third. I had to address my hearing by having a cochlear implant to be able to hear my students as I am a teacher. Next, I had to make sure I had glasses or contacts to see. Lastly, I had to put on hold needed dental care as I couldn't afford my hearing, eyes, and dental at the same time. With care credit, I am able to take care of all three. I thank God for Care Credit!!\n\nRead story"
