        "text": "If you’re contributing to or extending an existing project, it’s almost always easiest to continue using that project’s license. To find its license, look for a file called LICENSE or COPYING, and skim the project’s README. If you can’t find a license, ask the maintainers.\n\nDepending on the original project’s license, using the same license might be a requirement, not just the easiest thing to do. (See the “same license” condition of some licenses.)\n\nSome communities have strong preferences for particular licenses. If you want to participate in one of these, it will be easier to use their preferred license, even if you’re starting a brand new project with no existing dependencies. Some examples include:\n\nApache requires Apache License 2.0\n\nCloud Native Computing Foundation requires Apache License 2.0\n\nGNU recommends GNU GPLv3 for most programs\n\nnpm packages overwhelmingly use the MIT or the very similar ISC licenses\n\nOpenBSD prefers the ISC License\n\nRust crates are overwhelmingly licensed MIT OR Apache License 2.0\n\nWordPress plugins and themes must be GNU GPLv2 (or later)\n\nJoomla extensions and templates must be GNU GPLv2 for the PHP code."
