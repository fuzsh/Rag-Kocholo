        "text": "<<GNUSocal is GPLed which means its non-free (its still open source though)>>\n\nGPL is free. It is the preferred license of the Free Software Foundation (the organization that the founder of the free software movement, Richard Stallman, started). Usually people make the false claim that it is free, but not open source. It is both, and adheres to both the open source definition and the free software definition.\n\n<<If they can work together that would be best because then the competition would help drive innovation.>>\n\nAs the article states, they will both be compatible with each other through OStatus.\n\n<<What I do want to see is that GNUSocial wins and then there is little chance of getting a free implementation available.>>\n\nI'm guessing this is based off of the first miscunderstanding...\n\nGPL is free. It is the preferred license of the Free Software Foundation (the organization that the founder of the free software movement, Richard Stallman, started). Usually people make the false claim that it is free, but not open source. It is both, and adheres to both the open source definition and the free software definition.\n\n\"A mushroom is a pizza because I say so\"\n\nWho cares what the Free Software Foundation says?\n\nThe GPL license is less free than the BSD license because it has more restrictions on what a developer could do with the code\n\nUsually people make the false claim that because it is open source and because you can modify the source it free. Even more people make the false claim that because Richard Stallman and his organization say the GPL is free that the GPL becomes free.\n\nyou can't just take something with a meaning and change it how you like...\n\nFree: grant freedom to; free from confinement\n\nSoftware: (computer science) written programs or procedures or rules and associated documentation pertaining to the operation of a computer system and that are stored in read/write memory;\n\nThus free software is written programs or procedures or rules and associated documentation pertaining to the operation of a computer system and that are stored in read/write memory that is free from confinement.\n\nThe GPL has section 5c\n\n\"\"\"c) ....This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\"\"\"\"\n\nwhich is a confinement (a better word might be restriction but I'm trying to stay within the definition).\n\nThus the GPL is not Free Software.\n\nYour mistake is thinking that this is only about user freedom.\n\nSoftware is most free when people can use, modify, and distribute it without restriction.\n\nThe restrictions on distribution do not protect the user from exploitation. The original project and license is still around if the user wants the source.\n\nAll the license does it discourage and/or legally prevent people from making modifications to the software not distributing them. That is it. The user is never exploited in that scenario. S/he does not have to use the new software in any way.\n\nMy point is that the \"Free software movement\" is a misnomer and they are actually the \"open source software\" movement.\n\nI know of no organization that attempts to defend Free Software that does not attempt to re-write the definition of \"free\" in a form of political doublethink.\n\nMostly – I don't give a damn about movements. I generally prefer to use the best software and I don't care if it is free or not. However when there are otherwise equal projects I will generally choose to use the most free one.\n\nRe the history – I've read a significant amount of literature on the movement. Please advise me as to what I'm missing instead of using ad hominem arguments.\n\nIt is silly to think that a license that certain types of uses is more free than one that allows them. Keep in mind that it is perfectly acceptable to fork a BSD licensed project AND distribute source. The GPL model works perfectly with it.\n\nHowever the BSD license has one advantage that the GPL does not have: companies don't HAVE to release the source. That way a company, like apple, could use a projects source code, like FreeBSD (my OS of choice), and make an awesome OS out of it: the mac . Not only that but then this company could contribute paid developers to help work on the OS.\n\nRe the preference – I was misinformed: I thought Diaspora was MIT licensed. I take back that statement and wish them both equal amounts of luck\n\n<<GNU social will be difficult to install and use. It will be the preserve of geeks.>>\n\nGenerally, that's how network services work. They run on someone's server and the general public signs up on there.\n\n<<There won't be a hosted version or marketing along those lines.>>\n\nAs stated, there are already instances of StatusNet up and running, and when GNU social get's stable, they will be running it as well.\n\n<<And people won't like the name.>>\n\nGNU social is the name of the project. You can host a service using it and call it Christaanville if you like.\n\nug For the history they were pointing out that stallman *started* the free software movement itself. I'm having a bit of trouble thinking that the license designed by the man who started the fs movement is somehow nonfree. I also suggest you look up embedded devices(A place where GPL'd software is used commercially quite often), and Redhat for your claims about bsd's strength is that it's used in commercial settings. Also take a look at freedoms vs powers. The \"freedom\" to kill someone is hardly the kind of freedom you want to pass around to everyone. For the purposes of free software(As in wants all software to be free) considers the ability to make a proprietary program a power which shouldn't be available.\n\nFor me software freedom is being able to choose and customize the software you use wherever it may be running. That means being able to run your own instance and modify it but I also prefer AGPL because I wouldn't want my work to be used to subjugate someone else(which is possible with some free software licenses).\n\nI would also like to see all of these projects do more to ensure users have the freedom to move their accounts off to another system with a minimum of pain and inconvenience....I call that the freedom to migrate.\n\nI know that Richard Stallman started a movement which and created a license which he called \"Free\" (and thus misused the term and caused the debate we are having now).\n\nThus he started a movement which became known as the \"Free Software Movement\" (I'm unsure if he used the term movement or it was eventually called that)\n\nI know that embedded devices use GPL software a lot. But take a look at TiVO and Linksys. The former got hit hard by the GPL and now won't touch (and therefore possibly help) GPLv3 projects. The latter got hit as well and now doesn't use GPLed software. They may not have contributed projects before that – but now they have a strong reason not to.\n\nIt is correct that the freedom to kill to not a freedom which you want passed around. It is for this reason that I'm not a fan of \"freedom\" movements.\n\nThe freedom I talk about with software is one of definition – not of moral goodness or badness. Software which allows more uses and modifications is more free than software which does not.\n\nAgain – please note that freedom is not binary as I mentioned above.\n\n>> Software which allows more uses and modifications is more free than software which does not.\n\nPerhaps it's useful to remember that this is not a question strictly of software. In using free software, we are interested in advancing a version of society where people cooperate and do not attempt to gain power over each other. We live increasingly online and through software and if you are using a program for which you cannot make the changes you need, your life is unnecessarily limited and to some extent controlled by the developer or the system administrator(in the case of network services).\n\nYou are right that it's a continuum but my personal hope is that we always strive for self-reliance, self-determination and not lose our ideals of freedom for a few features here and there.\n\nDavid Perry\n\n\"\"\"are interested in advancing a version of society where people cooperate and do not attempt to gain power over each other.\"\"\"\n\nforgive if this is not what you mean but I think your talking about some form of light socialism.\n\nCompetition (and the drive for money) encourages innovation. Look at software patents: by stifling competition you reduce innovation in the market place.\n\nThe same thing occurs with the GPL: you are reducing the ability of a company to make money from the project (not that it is impossible, but it reduces the possibilities. The redhat way of selling support is still doable with a BSD license)\n\n\"\"You are right that it's a continuum but my personal hope is that we always strive for self-reliance, self-determination and not lose our ideals of freedom for a few features here and there.\"\"\"\n\nWhich is why I don't use a mac (along with the fact that I don't have the cash for it ;-))\n\n\"\"if you are using a program for which you cannot make the changes you need, \"\"\n\nI will make two arguments here\n\n1) Given good defaults most users don't need to make source level changes.\n\n2) You can easily choose to get the source code and host it yourself. The user of a project based on BSD licensed code that does not distribute the code is doing so willingly. Heck – the user of any project is doing so willingly\n\nDPic\n\nYet you engaged in it for a few posts\n\nDavid Sterry\n\nSo you have an agenda beyond that of \"free software\". Its an agenda I find laudable – but not solely based around the concept of \"free software\"\n\neveryone:\n\nI can't continue this debate now and I know I will forget to come back tomorrow to the comments (I usually use the RSS feed). Anyways – I think our positions are clear and I don't think that further debate would change much.\n\nJust for reference, there is a free BSD licensed open source alternative to Diaspora. It's called Mistpark. It's much more secure and capable than Diaspora at this point, and it runs on commodity hosting – e.g. PHP/MySQL.\n\nIt doesn't yet play with OStatus because nobody has yet decided how to make OStatus work for private conversations – and there are also no basic definitions and expectations of content policy (e.g. redistribution of confidential material) once something enters that network.\n\nWhen they do, these networks (Diaspora, Status.net, GNU social, yadda yadda) will be supported in Mistpark as well. We're just waiting for them to figure out how to secure their own networks so that attaching to them doesn't cause gaping holes in ours.\n\n- gnu-social is much easier to install than diaspora, more practical (as easy as installing a wordpress or one of those php/mysql things). I'm currently trying it out and we will see. as the author mentions clearly, it's base on statusnet, hence the resemblance, but will go further (private message/photo/chat and so on).\n\n- if it can talk to diaspora, that would be great. the whole thing (for me at least) is to have a \"spec/rfc/protocol\" so that anyone can develop or maintain their own server, just like with email. you can use whatever server/client software to communicate with others using totally different programs.\n\n- as for the GPL vs. BSD thing, my IMHO is: BSD seems very nice, but I am not ready for that, I mean, I want to share but I don't want people to \"steal\" work, I want them to use it, distribute it etc, but not close it up. Ensuring the freedom of the code requires rules. If linksys or any other company flees the GPL because they are not allowed to steal it and close source their forks then that is their choice. Free Software does not need them because by doing that they do not contribute in any way shape or form.\n\nFree Software is not just about ensuring freedom of the users (even if that is the main part), it's also making sure the code stays free. When the day comes where there is no closed source licensed software out there anymore I will rethink about the BSD license."
