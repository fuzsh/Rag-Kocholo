        "text": "OH MT GOD\n\nCHESSBASE IS GETTING SUED?\n\n@OzzieTezz\n\nTrue! That's a good point, and I may be wrong, but because Stockfish is open source, wouldn't the licensing agreement not include any of that?\n\nI think @h2b2 said it best above, the problem isn't that they are reselling it, it's that they are reselling it without releasing the source code as the SF licensing agreement requires.\n\n@OzzieTezz\n\nAhh ok. I can sympathize with that, but whenever I skim comments on Stockfish/Chessbase issues I always see people harping on that chessbase is evil because they sold stockfish's free product, which explains my original post.\n\nChessbase has a long history of not adhering to open source licenses.\n\nCircumventing license and using open source code to build a product and then not revealing it can only be tolerated to an extent.\n\nAt the core it is about ethical practices as a company which Chessbase has repeatedly not respected.\n\nGood move by Stockfish.\n\nThe open source community shouldn't have to endure this every single time.\n\nEspecially innocent chess players, who are the gullible targets for Chessbase.\n\n@VulcanForge That's easy to explain: somebody found a 'hidden' directory on Houdart's website and got in by simply guessing the password. In that directory were versions of the Houdini code.\n\n@h2b2\n\nThere are angles being discussed that are not just legal ones. Obviously we understand that chessbase isn't being sued because of the price of the product, we're just saying it's still stupid (legal or not).\n\nStockfish is doing a great job distributing strong engines for free. Copying its source codes and scams like this is not ethical against such a great organization. And most grateful to Lichess for giving updates on latest news.\n\nChessBase is an overrated GUI anyway...slow and buggy. I like SCID vs PC the ability to write comments on games is a lot more clean and readable and versatile than ChessBase's. On the other hand, I have to say I love ChessBase's \"Similar Positions\" features.\n\nThe point is, I feel ChessBase as a whole is overrated in both their integrity and products."
