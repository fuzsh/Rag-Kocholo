        "text": "Disclaimer: I'm just a software developer sharing personal opinions and not your lawyer.\n\nWell, I don't know where your problem is, however next to keeping your code under BSD you could also dual-license it under GPL which will help you to keep headaches out on your end if licensing causes you some and you don't want to consult a lawyer on your behalf.\n\nThat done you can keep all your code under BSD (next to having it GPL) to also full-fill requirements to distribute GPL'ed parts with it. You can do that by making clear to users who contribute code that they contribute it under both licenses.\n\nThat done its clearly your users choice. All you need to do when accepting patches is to take care that the BSD of your library code is preserved.\n\nThis would be similarly the situation when the GPL component would not be part of your library and a user would integrate GPL components with it. Because of the BSD, nobody is hindered doing that.\n\nUsers who don't want to have a GPL'ed package can just remove any GPL'ed parts and only use the parts under BSD. Just make clear with your dual licensing model is not conjunctive (GPL and BSD) but disjunctive (GPL or BSD) for the files you keep under dual licensing.\n\nThis would also help you with the problem offering a software package on Github containing GPL'ed software not under the GPL - which is what I see you right now doing with the Github hosting platform (it has automatic packaging)."
