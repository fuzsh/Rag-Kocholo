        "text": "Licensing of components is standard in the semiconductor industry. My experience went like this.\n\nThe design team in America licensed standard components like an ARM core, SRAM, DDR controller, and ethernet interface. We did not have complete designs for all of these. If not, we had software models. I knew if I asserted read enable while providing an address, I would get data out on the next clock. The simulation would show me that much. I could not trace the address decode logic to see how this miracle occurred. The SRAM block was effectively a black box. We had to be careful to say exactly what parameters would be used to instantiate this black box. For example, did we want single ported memory, 1 read + 1 write but only to different addresses, or 1 read + 1 write with bypassing for simultaneous access to the same address?\n\nPhysical layout and fabrication was all done in China. Payment of royalties for the \"IP\" was verified somewhere along the way. The IP worked as advertised.\n\nTwo key differences: there are not as many fabs as there are machine shops, and it costs on the order of a million dollars to get a chip made. The first makes it harder to cheat, and the second lessens the incentive to cheat over a relatively small amount of money.\n\n0\n\n@Jon, glad to see you here! I hope things are going well for you...\n\nI find this whole topic really interesting. I had to read Jon's blog post to really understand what he was getting at and I highly recommend anyone else skimming this thread to go read it here.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a lawyer.\n\nI spend a lot of time on both open source contributions and proprietary hardware and I expect to contribute to open hardware in the future, so treat the following as introspection rather than bashing.\n\nOpen source licenses are fascinating to me because, unlike releasing a work to the public domain, the author is trying to assert their will on those consuming their work. \"I'll give you a gift, but only if you let me put you in an arm lock.\" The different flavors of compulsion in open source licenses leads to churn between them as authors try to figure what's important to them individually. Churn between GPL style \"join my vision of utopia\" and BSD style \"here ya go, BTW my ass is covered\" seems to happen a lot. My own opinion is that the licenses with a social mission (like the GPL) contribute less to society than other FOSS licenses.\n\nRegarding hardware, I don't think open source licenses are a good place to start. I think that any creator that wants to impose their will on anyone downstream, deriving from or mashing-up their \"open hardware\" work, should just use contract law. Contracts are negotiated agreements while source code licenses derive their strength from copyright law and may or may not be contracts depending on context. Contract law is well established, can accomplish the task, and in my opinion, fits the spirit of what a creator wants to accomplish better. The main issue being that there must be an agreement between parties to the contract, and that takes more effort than just throwing a license in the general direction of someone.\n\nOne nice thing about open source code is its accessibility; how easy it is to get a hold of, experiment with, and try out. I think this is also key for open hardware. The interaction between the parties a contract requires is potentially a roadblock in distributing the open hardware, but I think that technology can help here. Specifically using digital signatures to establish unquestionably who is party to the contract and what the terms of the contract are. I think that with the right use of technology for distributing terms and collecting signatures, hardware designs can be shared with little friction to large numbers of people, under contract terms that suit the original creator.\n\nI think for myself, in most cases a public domain release of hardware is the only one that makes sense. If some other company picks up the design and figures out how to make millions off it, that is exactly the goal. The point of releasing the design is so that others can benefit from it. If it's really important to you that only a specific subset of people benefit, stop whining and go do the hard work it takes to make that happen.\n\nMeanwhile thinking about licenses and contracts always brings me back to the same point. I'm always aware that law is a provincial or national phenomena in this international world of business and that justice, and the lawyers required to seek it, is expensive and uncertain. I prefer to take the attitude of a small fish in a big ocean... If I drop my guard or stop swimming there are beasts so big that they won't even notice swallowing me, but agility and speed are on my side so I focus on using this to my advantage.\n\nBelow are some interesting things I came across as I was writing this...\n\nA short article on contracts vs licenses: http://www.law.washington.edu/lta/swp/law/contractvlicense.html\n\nAn article on the effect of contracts on copyright law: http://www.law.berkeley.edu/journals/btlj/articles/vol12/Elkin-Koren/html/reader.html\n\nAn article on some open source (GPL) rulings: http://opensource.com/law/14/7/lawsuit-threatens-break-new-ground-gpl-and-software-licensing-issues\n\n3"
