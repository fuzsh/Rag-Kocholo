Great for that purpose! No complaints...praise to the coders!\n\nGreat\n\nI LOVE Skim, but version 1.6.9 has a bug: it places an annoying black rectangle over the part of page containing an error, which remains there after correcting and after quitting Skim. So I re-installed 1.6.8 and all is well! Thank you for your (usually faultless) work!
