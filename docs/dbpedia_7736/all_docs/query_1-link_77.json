Over the past decade, through the work of the , CMS has been monitoring antipsychotic medication use in nursing homes. Though steps have been taken to reduce the use of these drugs, there continue to be concerns that nursing home residents may be inappropriately prescribed antipsychotic medications due to being erroneously diagnosed and coded as having schizophrenia;\n\nTo increase our focus on this issue, CMS recently announced they will be conducting off-site nursing home audits. If the audit reveals a pattern of inaccurate coding and if there are instances where a practitioner has not followed professionals’ standards of practice for diagnosing individuals and prescribing medications, we believe these practitioners should be referred to their respective state medical boards for investigation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ A MORE DETAILED VERSION OF THIS NOTICE\n\nFor questions and to obtain more information, please contact DNH_BehavioralHealth@cms.hhs.gov.\n\nOKCAPMAP\n\nThe supports the primary care provider’s provision of pediatric mental health care in the primary care setting.
