        "text": "What are options to debug SBL?\n\nSBL supports source level debugging using Intel UEFI Development Kit (UDK) debug tool (via UART). Depending on the board configuration, developers can also debug SBL with Intel trace hub, secure debug token (if enabled) or memory buffers.\n\nIs Embedded Controller (EC) supported?\n\nNo. Different boards may have different EC or SuperIO. Developers need implement the code for the target board.\n\nDoes it support RTOS?\n\nSBL features loading x86 ELF executables in its payload stage. We have verified loading Open Source Zephyr RTOS (See Boot Zephyr).\n\nWhat tool chains are supported to compile SBL?\n\nSBL supports Microsoft Visual Studio 2015/2017 and GNU GCC toolchains (gcc 7 or newer). Additional tools including Python (3.6), nasm, and IASL are required to build SBL.\n\nThe current version of BaseTools is UDK2018 from EDKII open source project.\n\nDoes SBL support verified boot and measured boot?\n\nYes. SBL supports both from software point of view. In order to enable hardware root-of-trust in SBL, the Intel stitching software kit is required. For measured boot, SBL supports TPM (Trusted Platform Module) 2.0.\n\nDoes SBL support SMM?\n\nSBL does not support SMM. If SMM is required, a new SBL payload can be created to support it.\n\nDoes SBL support Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware update?\n\nSBL has a built-in firmware update payload that features power-fail safe mechanism. OS specific OTA support can be implemented based on the provided firmware update interface in SBL.\n\nDoes SBL support splash screen?\n\nYes. Custom splash screen can be enabled or disabled (for boot performance) via SBL build options.\n\nDoes SBL support legacy boot?\n\nSBL currently does not support option ROM or CSM mode.\n\nDo you have a porting guide for new boards?\n\nPlease visit and search Developer’s Guide section first. We plan to post step-by-step porting guides with more details.\n\nI need help…"
