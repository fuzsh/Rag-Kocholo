        "text": "The full terms\n\n(with handy summaries at the end of each section)\n\nWhat it means\n\nThese terms apply to any Customer on PostHog Cloud. Separate terms for users of PostHog FOSS can be found here: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-foss/blob/master/LICENSE\n\nBy signing up to PostHog Cloud, you and any entity that you represent (\"Customer\") are unconditionally consenting to be bound by and are becoming a party to these PostHog Subscription Terms (\"Agreement\") as of the date of Customer's first download of the licensed materials (the \"effective date\").\n\nCustomer's continued use of the software or any licensed materials provided by PostHog, Inc., trading as PostHog (\"PostHog\") (or one of its affiliates and/or subsidiaries, as specified on an order form or quote), shall also constitute assent to the terms of this agreement.\n\nIf these terms are considered an offer, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms. If you are executing this agreement on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to do so.\n\nBy signing into PostHog, you agree to all these terms.\n\n(See our separate terms if you’re self-hosting the open source edition.)\n\n1. License and support\n\n1.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, PostHog hereby grants to Customer and its Affiliates (as defined below) a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license for Customer’s and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors to (1) internally (a) use, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, and display the code of PostHog Cloud at the tier level selected by Customer (or set forth on a Quote (as defined below), if applicable with the specifications generally promulgated by PostHog from time to time (the “Software”), solely (i) for its internal use in connection with the development of Customer’s and/or its Affiliates’ own software, and (ii) at the level of usage for which Customer has paid PostHog; and (b) use the documentation, training materials or other materials supplied by PostHog (the “Other PostHog Materials”); and (2) modify the Software and publish patches to the Software, solely at the level of usage for which Customer has paid PostHog. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Customer agrees that PostHog and/or its licensors (as applicable) retain all right, title and interest in and to all Software incorporated in such modifications and/or patches, and all such Software may only be used, copied, modified, displayed, distributed, or otherwise exploited in full compliance with this Agreement, and with a valid PostHog Cloud subscription for the correct level of usage.\n\nThe Software and Other PostHog Materials are collectively referred to herein as the “Licensed Materials.” “Affiliate” means any entity(ies) controlling, controlled by, and/or under common control with a party hereto, where “control” means the ownership of more than 50% of the voting securities in such entity. “User” means each individual end-user (person or machine) of Customer and/or its Affiliates (including, without limitation, employees, agents or consultants thereof) with access to the Licensed Materials hereunder.\n\nYou can use PostHog with the features defined in your chosen plan. You can also use our docs and tutorials to help you.\n\nYou can make pull requests on Github to help us make changes, but we own the rights to any modifications.\n\nWe will also continue to improve the product and make changes that enhance your experience as a user.\n\n1.2 Subject to the terms hereof, PostHog will provide reasonable support to Customer for the Licensed Materials as set forth on the 'Pricing' page, for the support plan selected and paid for by Customer.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event that Customer does not reasonably comply with written specifications or instructions from PostHog’s service engineers regarding any support issue or request (including without limitation, failure to make backups of Customer’s Licensed Materials) (each, a “Support Issue”), PostHog may terminate its support obligations to Customer with respect to such Support Issue upon fifteen (15) days’ written notice if Customer does not cure such noncompliance within the notice period.\n\nWe’ll provide support as outlined in your product plan.\n\nWe can close a support ticket if you fail to respond to a request from one of our engineers within 15 days.\n\n1.2.1 PostHog will use reasonable commercial efforts to respond to support questions by Slack, email, or community forums. The number of support questions is not limited.\n\nWe will aim to answer your questions as fast as we can, using a few different channels.\n\n2. Restrictions and responsibilities\n\n2.1 Except as expressly authorized in Section 1.1, Customer will not, and will not permit any third party to: use the Licensed Materials for any purpose other than as specifically authorized in Section 1, or in such a manner that would enable any unlicensed person to access the Licensed Materials; use the Licensed Materials or any other PostHog software for timesharing or service bureau purposes or for any purpose other than its and its Affiliates’ own internal use (including without limitation, sublicensing, distributing, selling, reselling any of the foregoing); except as expressly permitted herein; use the Licensed Materials in connection with any high risk or strict liability activity (including, without limitation, space travel, firefighting, police operations, power plant operation, military operations, rescue operations, hospital and medical operations or the like); use the Licensed Materials or software other than in accordance with this Agreement and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations (including but not limited to any privacy laws, and laws and regulations concerning intellectual property, consumer and child protection, obscenity or defamation); or use the Licensed Materials in any manner that (1) is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or libelous (including without limitation, accessing any computer, computer system, network, software, or data without authorization, breaching the security of another user or system, and/or attempting to circumvent any User authentication or security process), (2) impersonates any person or entity, including without limitation any employee or representative of PostHog, or (3) contains a virus, trojan horse, worm, time bomb, unsolicited bulk, commercial, or “spam” message, or other harmful computer code, file, or program (including without limitation, password guessing programs, decoders, password gatherers, keystroke loggers, cracking tools, packet sniffers, and/or encryption circumvention programs).\n\nYou can’t:\n\nLet other companies use your PostHog instance.\n\nUse PostHog for some things, like military operations or policing.\n\nUse PostHog in the space rocket you’re building.\n\nUse PostHog to do anything illegal or harmful to other people.\n\nPretend to be somebody else, including a PostHog employee.\n\nTry to hack PostHog, or use PostHog to do bad internet things.\n\nBasically, (i) don’t use PostHog to be a jerk, or do anything dangerous and (ii) if you build a space rocket and use PostHog, it’s not our fault if it crashes.\n\n2.2 Customer will cooperate with PostHog in connection with the performance of this Agreement by making available such personnel and information as may be reasonably required, and taking such other actions as PostHog may reasonably request. Customer will also cooperate with PostHog in establishing a password or other procedures for verifying that only designated employees of Customer have access to any administrative functions of the Licensed Materials.\n\nCustomer shall maintain during the term of this Agreement and through the end of the third year after the date on which the final payment is made under this Agreement, books, records, contracts and accounts relating to the payments due PostHog under this Agreement (collectively, the “Customer Records”). PostHog may, at its sole expense, upon 30 days’ prior written notice to Customer and during Customer’s normal business hours and subject to industry-standard confidentiality obligations, hire an independent third party auditor to audit the Customer Records only to verify the amounts payable under this Agreement. If an audit reveals underpayment, then Customer shall promptly pay the deficiency to PostHog plus late fees pursuant to Section 5.2. PostHog shall bear the cost of an audit unless the audit reveals underpayment by more than 5% for the audited period, in which case Customer shall promptly pay PostHog for the reasonable costs of the audit.\n\nYou need to work with us on some things, like creating passwords or answering emails.\n\nIf we think you’ve done any of the above naughty things, you need to allow us to check on that.\n\nWe reserve the right to check if you’ve underpaid, and ask you to pay if you have.\n\n2.3 Customer will be responsible for maintaining the security of Customer’s account, passwords (including but not limited to administrative and User passwords) and files, and for all uses of Customer account with or without Customer’s knowledge or consent.\n\nYou need to keep your account secure with passwords and not sharing all your data with anybody you don’t want to.\n\n3. Confidentiality\n\n3.1 Each party (the “Receiving Party”) understands that the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) has disclosed or may disclose information relating to the Disclosing Party’s technology or business (hereinafter referred to as “Proprietary Information” of the Disclosing Party). Without limiting the foregoing, the Licensed Materials are PostHog Proprietary Information.\n\nYou might tell us secret stuff you don’t want other people to know, and we might do the same back.\n\n3.2 The Receiving Party agrees: (i) not to divulge to any third person any such Proprietary Information, (ii) to give access to such Proprietary Information solely to those employees with a need to have access thereto for purposes of this Agreement, and (iii) to take the same security precautions to protect against disclosure or unauthorized use of such Proprietary Information that the party takes with its own proprietary information, but in no event will a party apply less than reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information.\n\nThe Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing will not apply with respect to any information that the Receiving Party can document (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without any action by, or involvement of, the Receiving Party, or (b) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (c) was rightfully disclosed to it without restriction by a third party, or (d) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party.\n\nNothing in this Agreement will prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Proprietary Information pursuant to any judicial or governmental order, provided that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party reasonable prior notice of such disclosure to contest such order. In any event, PostHog may collect data with respect to and report on the aggregate response rate and other aggregate measures of the Licensed Materials’ performance and Customer’s usage of the Licensed Materials; provided that PostHog will not identify Customer as the source of any such data without Customer’s prior written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, use of a third party to host the data collected shall not be deemed a disclosure.\n\nWe both agree not to tell anybody else about these things, unless it was already obvious – we all share some stuff on the internet, right?\n\nWe should try hard to make sure we keep the secrets safe and take extra steps to do that. We both agree that if anybody official, like a judge or the government, asks to see anything you want kept secret, that we let the other person know before we share.\n\nHopefully it’s obvious that Jeff Bezos doesn’t count – well, AWS anyway, Jeff’s too busy on a boat to care.\n\n3.3 Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other may suffer irreparable damage in the event of a breach of the terms of Sections 1.1, 2.1 or 3.2 of this Agreement and that such party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief (without the necessity of posting a bond) in the event of any such breach.\n\nWe both agree that giving away all the other’s secrets can lead to serious legal issues.\n\n3.4 Both parties will have the right to disclose the existence of the relationship between the parties, but not the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless such disclosure of the Agreement terms is approved in writing by both Parties prior to such disclosure, or is included in a filing required to be made by a party with a governmental authority (provided such party will use reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment or a protective order) or is made on a confidential basis as reasonably necessary to potential investors or acquirers.\n\nWe can both talk about working with each other, we just can’t share anything secret with others.\n\n4. Intellectual property rights\n\n4.1 Except as expressly set forth herein, PostHog alone (and its licensors, where applicable) will retain all intellectual property rights relating to the Licensed Materials and any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, code, or other recommendations provided by Customer, its Affiliates or any third party relating to the Licensed Materials, which are hereby assigned to PostHog. This Agreement is not a sale and does not convey to Customer any rights of ownership in or related to the Licensed Materials, or any intellectual property rights.\n\nPlease do not copy PostHog or any of our stuff, pretty please.\n\n4.2 Customer shall not remove, alter or obscure any of PostHog’s (or its licensors’) copyright notices, proprietary legends, trademark or service mark attributions, patent markings or other indicia of PostHog’s (or its licensors’) ownership or contribution from the Licensed Materials. Additionally, Customer agrees to reproduce and include PostHog’s (and its licensors’) proprietary and copyright notices on any copies of the Licensed Materials, or on any portion thereof, including reproduction of the copyright notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, certain components of the Licensed Materials, including without limitation, any component of the Licensed Materials distributed by PostHog as part of the PostHog FOSS Edition, are licensed by third parties pursuant to the terms of certain third party licenses described in such source code annotations.\n\nPlease respect our copyright and brand.\n\nOh, and pleeeeeease don’t copy our website. We love that you like it, but it is an important part of our brand. If you need help, get in touch and we’ll happily share some advice. 🙏\n\n4.3 Customer and its licensors shall (and Customer hereby represents and warrants that they do) have and retain all right, title and interest (including, without limitation, sole ownership of) all software, information, content and data provided by or on behalf of Customer or made available or otherwise distributed through use of the Licensed Materials (“Content”) and the intellectual property rights with respect to that Content. If PostHog receives any notice or claim that any Content, or Customer’s activities hereunder (including without limitation, with respect to any Content), infringes or violates the rights of a third party or any applicable law or regulation (a “Claim”), Customer will indemnify, defend and hold PostHog harmless from all liability, damages, settlements, attorney fees and other costs and expenses in connection with any such Claim, as incurred. The immediately foregoing indemnity obligations are expressly conditioned on PostHog providing Customer with prompt notice of, and reasonable cooperation and sole control over the defense and/or settlement of the applicable Claim. Subject to the foregoing, PostHog may participate in the defense and/or settlement of any applicable Claim with counsel of its choosing at its own expense.\n\nYou will own all the data you receive through your use of PostHog. However, if PostHog learns that somebody else owns that data, you will tell the other party that we had nothing to do with it, and protect PostHog from any legal issues.\n\n4.4 PostHog will defend, indemnify and hold Customer harmless from liability and other amounts paid or payable to unaffiliated third parties resulting from the infringement or violation of any intellectual property or proprietary rights by the Licensed Materials, provided PostHog is promptly notified of any and all threats, claims and proceedings related thereto and given reasonable assistance and the opportunity to assume sole control over defense and settlement thereof. Subject to the foregoing, Customer may participate in the defense and/or settlement of any claim that is indemnifiable by PostHog with counsel of its choosing at its own expense. The foregoing obligations do not apply with respect to portions or components of the Licensed Materials (i) not created by PostHog, (ii) that are modified after delivery by PostHog, (iii) combined with other products, processes or materials where the alleged infringement relates to such combination, (iv) where Customer continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (v) where Customer’s use of the Licensed Materials is not strictly in accordance with this Agreement and all related documentation.\n\nIf somebody tells you PostHog has done anything wrong, and it turns out we have, when it comes to using PostHog, we will let them know you didn’t know about it.\n\n5. Payment of fees\n\n5.1 Customer will pay PostHog the then applicable fees described in the Order Form or Quote for the Licensed Materials in accordance with the terms therein (the “Fees”). If Customer’s use of the Licensed Materials exceeds the Service Capacity set forth on the Order Form or Quote or otherwise requires the payment of additional fees (per the terms of this Agreement), Customer shall be billed for such usage and Customer agrees to pay the additional fees in the manner provided herein. PostHog reserves the right to increase the Fees or applicable charges and to institute new charges and Fees at the end of the Initial Service Term or then current renewal term, upon thirty (30) days prior notice to Customer (which may be sent by email). PostHog reserves the right to reduce the Fees or applicable charges during the Initial Service Term or then current renewal term, immediately with notice to Customer (which may be sent by email). If Customer believes that PostHog has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact PostHog no later than 60 days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in order to receive an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed to Company’s customer success department (sales@posthog.com).\n\nYou will pay for using PostHog on time – usually via credit card.\n\nIf we’re going to increase prices, we need to give you 30 days notice, giving you the chance to cancel with us.\n\nIf we reduce our prices, which does happen (I know, crazy right!) we can do that immediately, so you feel the benefit asap.\n\nIf you think we’ve billed you incorrectly, let us know within 60 days so we can sort it.\n\n5.2 PostHog may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by PostHog according to the payment terms specified in the invoice. Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of Service. Customer shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Licenses Materials other than U.S. taxes based on PostHog’s net income.\n\nIf you choose annual payments, we will send an invoice. Please pay on time or it could lead to late fees.\n\n5.3 Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, GST, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever in relation to your purchases under this Agreement (collectively, the “Taxes”). You are solely responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your purchases hereunder. If we have a legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible for under this Clause 4.3, we shall invoice you and you shall pay that amount to us unless you provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. We shall calculate applicable Taxes based on your billing address as detailed on the relevant Order Form or Quote (it is your duty to inform us if Taxes should be assessed on a different address). You shall promptly notify us of any changes to any of your addresses specified in an Order Form or Quote. Taxes shall not be deducted from or set-off against the fees in the applicable Order Form or Quote.\n\nAll our prices are without sales tax.\n\n5.4 Subject to earlier termination as provided below, this Agreement is for the Initial Service Term as specified in the Order Form or Quote, and shall be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the Initial Service Term (collectively, the “Term”), unless either party requests termination with at least thirty (30) days notice.\n\nPostHog is a monthly subscription that renews each month. You can cancel at any time with 30 days notice. PostHog can do the same.\n\n6. Termination\n\n6.1 This Agreement shall continue until terminated in accordance with this Section 6. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days’ written notice to the other party hereto in the event that Customer has no then-current subscription with respect to the Licensed Materials.\n\nYour contract with PostHog runs until either you cancel it, or PostHog does. You can do this in the app, or just email us\n\n6.2. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon 30 days’ written notice to the other party in the event of any material breach of this Agreement (including without limitation, any breach of Section 2.2 and/or failure to pay any amounts when due hereunder) by such party where such material breach is not cured during such notice period.\n\n6.3 Either party may terminate this Agreement, without notice, (i) upon the institution by or against the other party of insolvency, receivership or bankruptcy proceedings (provided such proceedings are not dismissed within one hundred twenty (120) days of such institution), (ii) upon the other party’s making an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (iii) upon the other party’s dissolution or ceasing to do business without a successor.\n\n6.4 Customer’s rights to the Licensed Materials, and any licenses granted hereunder, shall terminate upon any termination of this Agreement. In the event that Customer terminates this Agreement pursuant to the second sentence of Section 6.2 above, PostHog will refund to Customer a pro-rated portion of pre-paid Fees for Services not actually received by Customer as of the date of such termination. The following Sections will survive any termination of this Agreement: 2 through 6 (except for Section 4.3), and 8 through 11.\n\nWhen the agreement terminates, your right to use PostHog ends. If PostHog broke the contract then you can get a pro-rata refund if you have pre-paid anything.\n\n7. Warranty; Customer Software Security\n\nPostHog represents and warrants that (i) it has all rights and licenses necessary for it to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) it will not knowingly include, in any PostHog software released to the public and provided to Customer hereunder, any computer code or other computer instructions, devices or techniques, including without limitation those known as disabling devices, trojans, or time bombs, that are intentionally designed to disrupt, disable, harm, infect, defraud, damage, or otherwise impede in any manner, the operation of a network, computer program or computer system or any component thereof, including its security or user data. If, at any time, PostHog fails to comply with the warranty in this Section, Customer may promptly notify PostHog in writing of any such noncompliance. PostHog will, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such written notification, either correct the noncompliance or provide Customer with a plan for correcting the noncompliance. If the noncompliance is not corrected or if a reasonably acceptable plan for correcting them is not established during such period, Customer may terminate this Agreement as its sole and exclusive remedy for such noncompliance.\n\nPostHog promises we own all the rights to sell you PostHog and using it won’t cause you any damage.\n\n8. Warranty Disclaimer\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN, THE LICENSED MATERIALS, SOFTWARE AND POSTHOG PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND ANYTHING PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS,” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. POSTHOG AND ITS LICENSORS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\nWhoa, if we have to shout then it must be important. You should read this carefully.\n\n9. Limitation of liability\n\nEXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO BREACH(ES) OF SECTION 1.1 AND/OR 2.1, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY OR THEIR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS OR ANYTHING PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED MATERIALS OR ANYTHING PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF REVENUE OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS OR LOST SALES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO BREACH(ES) OF SECTION 1.1 AND/OR 2.1, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY AND ITS LICENSORS, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE GREATER OF (i) ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,000), OR (ii) THE FEES PAID TO POSTHOG HEREUNDER IN ONE YEAR PERIOD ENDING ON THE DATE THAT A CLAIM OR DEMAND IS FIRST ASSERTED. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.\n\nALL CAPS AGAIN, we’ll get out of the way here. 👀\n\n11. Miscellaneous\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by either party without the other party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that either party may transfer and/or assign this Agreement to a successor in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this Agreement relates. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed or otherwise agreed to by each party, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect whatsoever. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees. All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested), postage prepaid. PostHog will not be liable for any loss resulting from a cause over which it does not have direct control. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A. without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
