This is what I know already.

Okay, I understand the text, but I cannot understand how someone (the project using GPL as their license) can take away a right (to use the code freely under the terms of the BSDL) from me or my licensees. The point here is not what is written in the GPL as I did not put my code under GPL. Furthermore "*sub*licensing" sounds to me as if the BSDL does not lose its validity through the "process" of sublicensing. It sounds to me as if the GPL - which offers only a subset of the rights I granted the licensees by BSDLing my code - is just relevant in the context of the project but does not touch the rights granted to users (by me) of the particular used (BSDLed) modules. Still reading ... so some of my above prejudices may be gone after it. I would surely enjoy personal email conversation with you ;) ... because I suspect that the other list members may perhaps be bored from this discussion (already).
