        "text": "Series Details\n\nThe Skylark of Space\n\nDuring an experiment for the Government Bureau of Chemistry, Richard Seaton realises that he has discovered the means for liberating intra-atomic energy. Seaton, and a friend, millionaire Reynolds Crane, decide to build a space-flier, to be propelled by this intra-atomic energy.\n\nMeanwhile, Marc DuQuesne and the Steel Trust, aware of the discovery’s potential, make attempts to steal the experimental solution the discovery is based on and the plans for the space-flier.\n\nThe Skylark of Space (1928) was first published in Amazing Stories in 1928. While there are earlier stories about space travel, it is the first novel about interstellar travel and is considered the first “space opera” book.\n\nSkylark Three\n\nSkylark Three (1930) by E.E. ‘Doc’ Smith is the second book of the classic Skylark trilogy. Skylark Three is “the tale of the galactic cruise which ushered in Universal Civilization.”\n\nAfter the huge success of The Skylark of Space in 1928, Amazing Stories asked E.E. Smith (1890-1965) to write a sequel. Skylark Three was originally published in Amazing Stories in three parts in 1930, beginning with the August issue.\n\nSkylark of Valeron\n\nThe Skylark of Valeron (1934-5) brings to a conclusion the classic Skylark trilogy by E.E. ‘Doc’ Smith. While DuQuesne has survived to become Master of the Earth, the Seatons and the Cranes must run for their lives into the fourth dimension — from which none have ever returned.\n\nThe Skylark of Valeron was first published in seven parts in Astounding Stories in 1934 and 1935.\n\nEdward Elmer Smith Ph.D. (1890-1965) earned two degrees in Chemical Engineering from the University of Idaho. He lived in Washington D.C. where he became a chemist for the National Bureau of Standards, developing standards for butter and oysters. He is sometimes called the father of space opera.\n\nFiles:"
