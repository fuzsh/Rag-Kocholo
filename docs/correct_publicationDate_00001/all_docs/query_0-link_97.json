        "text": "From the ground-breaking digital initiative, the SF Gateway, the four novels of the Skylark sequence by the prolific E. E. ‘Doc’ Smith. A perfect introduction to the father of modern space opera.\n\nThis omnibus forms an ideal sample introduction to the fantastic work of E. E. ‘Doc’ Smith, one of the most influential authors of the pulp era. Working with legendary Astounding Science Fiction editor, John W. Campbell, Smith revolutionised space opera, giving it many of the tropes still evident today. This volume reprints the four novels of his classic Skylark series: The Skylark of Space, Skylark Three, Skylark of Valeron & Skylark DuQuesne."
