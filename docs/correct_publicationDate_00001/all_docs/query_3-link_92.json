Paul and Karen Anderson are and were long time friends of Virginia and Robert Heinlein. In 1940, Robert wrote the novella Magic, Inc., a speculative fiction story of a universe in which an everyday element of our workaday lives is magic. Sixteen years later, Poul wrote a series of stories incorporating that world that were published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science-Fiction later collected and, with interstitial material, published in 1971 as Operation Chaos and dedicated by their author to Robert and Virginia. Last year, Operation Luna, Mr. Anderson’s sequel to Operation Chaos, was released. All three of these works are in-print, reissued by TOR in the past year, with Magic, Inc. available as the lead-off story in the new collection The Fantasies of Robert A. Heinlein.\n\nAs our online visitor, Mr. Anderson will discuss his long time relationship to Robert Heinlein and his works, the several stories involving the universe of Magic, Inc., and speculative fiction and his own other stories in general.\n\nWe urge you, if you haven’t read the stories to do so, and attend one or both of Poul Anderson’s guest visits.\n\nE mail The Robert A.

Date: October 1999\n\nABOUT THE BOOK\n\nFrom The Publisher\n\nRobert A. Heinlein, the dean of American SF writers, also wrote fantasy fiction throughout his long career. The Golden Age of SF was also the time of a revolution in fantasy fiction, and Heinlein was there with stories set in a convincingly realistic world. Many of his tales, such as “Magic, Inc., ” “They, ” and “The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag, ” appeared in the famous magazine Unknown Worlds. Now Heinlein’s best fantasy short stories and novellas have been collected in one big volume for the first time.\n\nReviews\n\nFrom Russell Letson – Locus\n\nProbably the best reason for the existence of this volume is to juxtapose three of Heinlein’s most striking nightmare visions. “They” and “All You Zombies” are variations on the solipsism theme that shows up throughout Heinlein”s career (notably anything featuring Lazarus Long). “The Unpleasant Profession of Johnathan Hoag” runs some metaphysical games with links to both of the solipsism stories and finishes with an image (the loving couple sleeping handcuffed to each other) that complements the curtain line of “Zombies”. Maybe these explorations of the extremes of the human condition are important because they are so unlike what we think of as “Heinlein SF.” Fantasy, after all, is the back door to the mind, and tracing the connections that link these stories to each other and to the rest of his work reveals a good bit of what made Heinlein tick.\n\nOperation Luna\n\nPoul Anderson\n\nto order on-line, click the blue hyperlink below\n\nbn.com – Operation Luna\n\nbn.com Price: $16.06\n\nRetail Price: $22.95\n\nYou Save: $6.89 (30%)\n\nIn-Stock: Ships within 24 hours\n\nFormat: Hardcover, 1st ed., 316pp.\n\nISBN: 0312867069\n\nPublisher: Dohery, Tom Associates\n\nPub.

For starters, Ginny is a licensed witch and Steve is a werewolf. Steve moonlights as an engineer working on a spacecraft in the Arizona desert, along with Will Greylock, Ginny’s older brother. Will has determined that there are intelligent beings on the moon. Neither Will nor the U.S. government has any inkling as to the nature of these moonsprites, and everyone is anxious to make contact. But when the time comes to test the would-be spacecraft, a host of bugs, snafus, and angry spirits conspire to prevent the launch. It’s a recipe for perfect lunacy as Ginny and her clan struggle to figure out who, or what, is sabotaging the greatest magical and scientific achievement of the century.\n\nFrom The Publisher\n\n“Ginny Greylock and Steven Matuchek are partners on an Earth quite unlike our own.

He’s a werewolf who makes his living as an engineer. Similarities to Nick and Nora Charles are, perhaps, not entirely accidental. Anderson’s humorous stories about Ginny and Steve Matuchek, set in an alternate contemporary America where most technology is based on magic, first began appearing in the 1950s and were novelized as Operation Chaos in 1971. In his latest novel (after Starfarers), Anderson continues the saga in a tale that features light-hearted cloak-and-dagger suspense, ingenious adaptations of magic to the routine of daily life, and an attempt to send magically endowed spacecraft, including a souped-up broomstick, to the moon under the auspices of NASA (the National Astral Spellcraft Administration). Anderson deals playfully with a number of different\n\nmagical and religious traditions, centering on Zuni, Chinese and Norse lore. He also introduces a variety of eccentric human and supernatural characters–including Bob Shining Knife, a skilled FBI agent who conducts his investigations in full Apache regalia; Fjalar, a dwarf who is supernaturally skilled at forging both iron and passports; a magical sword named Fotherwick-Botts that won’t stop running off at the mouth; and Alger Sneep, an agent of the IRS (Inquisition for Revenue Securement), who attempts to derail the Matucheks’ moon flight by quite literally putting them through the audit from hell. The humor can be arch at times, and Anderson’s tendency toward thinly veiled libertarian political satire won’t work for all readers, but in general this is an enjoyable tale by a veteran writer who knows exactly what he’s doing. (Aug.) Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information.\n\nFrom Kirkus\n\nBelated and iffy sequel novel to a collection of linked stories, Operation Chaos (1971). The previous volume was set in an alternate world where the Industrial Revolution inhibited magic, so the surviving supernatural Beings spelled themselves to sleep. Later, a method was found to release the “goetic forces” (strong magic) and permit a grand Awakening. Now, Project Selene is ready to send a spaceship-a giant horse boosted by four broomsticks!-to the moon. But the launch proves a spectacular failure, thanks to certain inimical supernatural influences. So the National Astral Spellcraft Administration calls in consultant witch Ginny Graylock and her werewolf/engineer husband Steve Matuchek. The two diagnose interference from the Trickster, Coyote, and other powers, possibly Chinese. Despite hassles from the IRS, Ginny and Steve receive authorization to proceed with Project Luna, their own smaller, quieter method of reaching the moon, since only there can they find out who’s trying to destroy the space program, and why. Ginny will be assisted by her precocious 13-year-old daughter, Valeria, her familiar, Edgar the raven, and various friendly American Indian shamans. Steve flies off to England to find a powerful antique talking sword-it now calls itself Fotherwick-Botts-along with the sword’s smith, the massive, uninhibited, hammer-wielding dwarf, Fjalar. Anderson’s not particularly comfortable with his material: a glum, effortful outing, too seldom vitalized by humor or imagination.\n\nQuotes\n\n“One of science fiction’s most revered writers.” –USA Today\n\n“One of hard science fiction’s most consistently impressive writers.” –Omni\n\n“Anderson has produced more milestones in contemporary science fiction and fantasy than any one man is entitled to.” –Stephen R.

There are infinite number of time streams in the universe including one in which a large segment of the earth populace uses magic. In the first century BC, the physical rules governing magic were discovered. Two millenniums later, magic is considered a combination science and religion that centers on spells that harness supernatural energies.\n\nIn this modern world reside two individuals who will impact the future of civilization, which is why the Adversary keeps close watch over them. Werewolf Steve Matuchek and witch Ginny Greylock meet just outside Trollsberg, Oregon. They are in a battle with the Saracen Caliphate, an extremist Morlen sect. The duo must retake the town if they are to drive the sect out of the United States. Ginny and Steve succeed in their endeavor, and fall in love with one another during their encounters. They marry and beget a baby. However, a few years later that infant is kidnapped and taken to Hell. Steve and Ginny follow in hot pursuit of their beloved child. The reprinting of the 1970’s OPERATION CHAOS shows the highly regarded novel passes the time test required of being labeled a classic. Science Fiction giant Poul Anderson paved the way for many of the next two decades’ great writers such as Huff, Hamilton, and Lisle with works like this one where an alternate earth seems physically real. The engrossing story line focuses on Steve and Ginny, who appear to be real persona in spite of their supernatural\n\ntendencies. Mr. Anderson’s novels retain their freshness and that make him a hall of fame level of story teller.\n\nHarriet Klausner\n\nQuotes\n\n“Operation Chaos was one of the truly fine fantasies of the 1970s, a fantasy whose magic was so splendidly engineered that you felt it was as logical–and as likely–as our real technology.”–Harry Turtledove, author of Between the Rivers –St. Martin’s Press\n\n—\n\nAGPlusOne\n\n“The Lieutenant expects your names to shine!”\n\n–Robert Anson Heinlein, USNA ’29, Lt.(j.g.)\n\nUSN, Retired, 1907-1988\n\nSubject: Re: Early Notice–Poul Anderson Guest Visit\n\nDate: 4/6/00 7:11 PM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nFrom: BPRAL22169\n\nRe: Material on “Magic, Inc.” Fearless Leader (or intrepid, if you prefer) asked about magic sources in alt.fan.heinlein and received a bountiful response, cross-posted here:\n\nSubject: Magic in Magic Inc was Re: OT:I think it is sad…\n\nFrom: “Jani”\n\nDate: 4/6/00 1:14 PM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nAGplusone < > wrote\n\n>About the flame Amanda whatzername used\n\non the nasty little guy, whatever his\n\nspecies is … since I’ve got to read it\n\nfor Next Thursday when Mr. Anderson visits,\n\nI think I’ll try to get it right for a while.\n\nMy copy of Magic Inc having magically disappeared (grrr) this is from memory and some almost illegible scribbled notes…here goes…\n\nIt seems clear from RAH’s comments in EU that he had met practitioners of modern witchcraft, and that he regarded them in a fairly positive light. He\n\nmentions that he knows of four covens (presumably Wiccan, that being the largest group among the many different branches of witchcraft) and says “Treat (a witch) with warm politeness and you may learn much more.”\n\nHowever, I’m guessing that these encounters with Pagans occurred after Magic Inc was written, so probably don’t throw any light on his sources of\n\ninformation.\n\nAnyway, as to the various forms of magical tradition in the story: Granny Jennings is perhaps the most familiar figure to non-Pagans – the little old\n\nlady living alone in her cottage with her cat, brewing love-potions and reading tea-leaves. She’s obviously a force for good, combining grandmotherly kindness with sound common-sense and a very strong will when it comes to disciplining recalcitrant children (such as the gnome.) Wise, practical, homely and at first glance rather quaint, she’s the epitome of the “kitchen witch”. She and the two other female characters, Eileen and Sally, represent the triple aspect of the Goddess – maiden, mother and crone. However, her command of the elementals demonstrates the power hidden beneath the rather frail exterior, and later her transformation into young Amanda reveals another aspect of her character: the strong, dynamic and sexually attractive warrior against the forces of evil. Archie mentions that she reminds him of the “bronze Diana of the Woods”, so evidently he sees her as a fearless huntress.\n\nThe concept of the triple Goddess, and the image of the virgin huntress are obviously well-known, so I’d guess Robert Graves might have been the source RAH used.\n\nBiddle, now, is another kettle of fish. Flashy, materialistic and let’s face it, downright incompetent. If it were not for the fact that he evidently has *some* power (his showy dematerialisations, for instance) I would have him pegged as a cynical psychic charlatan who preys on the vulnerable in order to finance his fancy office suites and pretty secretaries. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, I see him as the kind of “occult practitioner” who wears the robes, knows the rituals but has never had to do any real magical work in his life (to use a Christian analogy, the equivalent of an actor playing the role of a priest.) He has no idea how to deal with the elementals, and is ignorant enough to tell Archie that *no-one* can help him (at this point, he still thinks he’s going to get paid, so it isn’t a deliberate ploy to stop Archie consulting Amanda.)\n\nThere are businessmen like Biddle in all walks of life, so RAH wouldn’t necessarily have had to consult an esoteric source to develop the character. I’m tempted to think he might have read Crowley’s comments on clueless occultists, though <g>\n\nNow this is a point at which my memory falters, so bear with me. Jack Bodie says, I think, that his father taught him all he knew, but insisted that Jack went to college to get “official” qualifications. Hereditary witch families teach their craft parent-to-child and are, even these days, very secretive about their beliefs and practices – a different system from Amanda’s, although the two obviously have some common ground. Perhaps RAH took this from Gerald Gardner, although I have a feeling the publication date of Magic Inc probably doesn’t bear this out.\n\nOK, on to Satan. No problem with sources here – Magic Inc’s Satan is pretty much as described in the evidence given in the witch-trials of a few hundred\n\nyears ago. However, by setting Amanda against Old Nick, RAH brings together two traditions in a combat which could not actually have taken place – Satan is a part of Christian (and I think, Islamic) belief, whereas no such entity exists in witchcraft. The Horned God who represents the male principle in the witches’ faith is not a representation of evil, but the counterpart of the female principle as evinced by the Goddess. It seems unlikely that RAH was unaware of this, so presumably he chose to personify evil as a demonic figure familiar to Christians and non-Christians alike. Fair enough.\n\nI’m going to gloss over Royce Worthington rather quickly, since I’m totally unfamiliar with African religions, but I *will* go and look up nganga as soon as I get the chance. However, the way in which Royce transmutes into what seems to be a totem animal sounds as if there might be a similarity with NAI tradition – anyone help me out here? His relationship with his grandfather is reminiscent of Voudoun, practitioners of which retain a strong spiritual link with their ancestors. RAH’s sources for Royce? Archie mentions the misconceptions arising from white people “seeing the black man outside of his cultural matrix”, which sounds more like RAH’s perspective than Archie’s (I don’t find Archie the brightest person in the multiverse, really <g>) so I reckon a *lot* of research went into Royce. Wish I knew what it was!\n\n(I’ve just had a phone call telling me my copy of Magic Inc will be returned by the borrower tomorrow. Phew.)\n\nAnyway, you get the drift from what I’ve said above – the story might appear, superficially, to use stereotypes or universally recognisable images to further the plot, but there’s a *lot* more to it between the lines.\n\nSorry this is so long. Please feel free to chop, snip, disembowel and criticise it at leisure, once everyone’s recovered from the shock of Jani posting more than six lines *and* on-topic 😉\n\nJani\n\nSubject: Re: Early Notice–Poul Anderson Guest Visit\n\nDate: 4/6/00 7:21 PM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nFrom: BPRAL22169\n\nMore cross-postings from alt.fan.heinlein on the general subject of the sources for magic theory in “Magic, Inc.” Jani’s post provoked an interesting exchange.\n\nSubject: Re: Magic in Magic Inc was Re: OT:I think it is sad…\n\nFrom: ddavitt\n\nDate: 4/6/00 2:43 PM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nInteresting post Jani, thanks! Heinlein certainly does seem to have crammed a lot into the story. It reminds me a little of the Alvin Maker stories by Orson Scott Card; an America where magic and hexes are accepted as part of life and people skilled in magic are both respected and feared. Or maybe the Anita Blake stories where vampires are citizens with a vote 🙂\n\nI agree with you about Archie’s reaction to Royce; I have always assumed it was Heinlein’s way of getting over his own views too; seems to be a little over stressed. Wonder how it went over at the time of writing?\n\nJane\n\nSubject: Re: Magic in Magic Inc was\n\nRe: OT:I think it is sad…\n\nFrom: David Wright\n\nDate: 4/6/00 9:10 PM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nI can’t say how it went over in the early 40’s. I, personally, can attribute that my own thinking and perceptions of blacks began to change on encountering this particular book in the early 50’s. I was a southerner from a family which was one of the last to leave the neighborhood when it turned from white to black and this particular quotation helped me realize that I had erected a wall against my new neighbors because of prejudice. The contrast between Worthington and Archie’s black workers, (and what I thought I myself had seen in all blacks in my own lifetime), made me think. This and some other things in Heinlein helped me to come up, (at least part way), out of prejudice.\n\nDavid\n\n* Sent from RemarQ http://www.remarq.com The Internet’s Discussion Network * The fastest and easiest way to search and participate in Usenet – Free!\n\nSubject: Re: Magic in Magic Inc was Re: OT:I think it is sad…\n\nFrom: “Jani”\n\nDate: 4/6/00 3:51 PM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nWell, in the same way as a scientist will look at what’s behind a more “techie” bit of RAH’s background material, and extrapolate for us – just for once it was part of *my* field. Nice change <G>\n\nRe the Alvin Maker stories by Orson Scott Card: There’s a very strong hereditary tradition in the US, perhaps because all immigrants bring their cultural baggage along. To face discrimination because of skin colour, dress customs etc is bad enough – but to have your religion treated as demon-worship is pushing it a bit 🙂 I wonder if Card got his original inspiration from Bell, Book and Candle? (Highly recommended also to old-movie fans, Jimmy Stewart fans, Kim Novak fans…:)\n\nRe: Royce: To me, re-reading it the 80s, it seemed very racist. When I first read it in <counting back> 63, 64? I had no preconceptions about prejudice, and I just accepted that Archie was surprised at one stereotype being replaced by another, Oxford dons and African initiates being equally outside of my experience.\n\nNow, <hindsight on> I see a big difference between the superstitious workmen who wouldn’t touch the “voodoo marks” on the bricks, and Royce who was still very much part of his own culture, however much he’d acquired a posh accent and a briefcase for purposes of communication in the “real” world.\n\nJani\n\nSubject: African Magic in Magic Inc\n\nwas Re: OT:I think it is sad…\n\nFrom: “Jani”\n\nDate: 4/9/00 12:23 PM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nSlewing off at another tangent here, Royce’s form of magic seems to be the other side of the coin from Clarke’s Law. His practices are evidently unfamilar to Archie, but when I looked at African traditions I found that the acceptance of magic in everyday life is very similar to the world of Magic Inc. For instance, a nganga is the expert you would consult if you were hexed (which is about as common as nuisance phone calls are here, from what I can gather) and to get to the bottom of the affair there would be a public hearing similar to a court case – hence Royce’s comment about his function being analogous to a prosecuting attorney. (Not too different from Archie consulting Biddle, either, except for the difference between a private insurance settlement and a civil court case). Ancestors are consulted as a matter of course on all sorts of social and professional matters (reminded me of the way corporate Martians talk to Old Ones in SiaSL, which thoroughly confused the Earthlings!). And, to my great delight, I discovered something which IMO explains Royce’s transformation into a dog – there is a widespread belief in African tradition that witches can change into -no, not dogs, but hyenas, which were regarded with the same distrust and suspicion as black cats associated with witches were in Europe. It seems close enough to assume that that’s where RAH got the idea from…\n\nJani\n\nSubject: Re: Early Notice–Poul Anderson Guest Visit\n\nDate: 4/6/00 7:23 PM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nFrom: BPRAL22169\n\nSubject: Re: Magic in Magic Inc was Re: OT:I think it is sad…\n\nWonderful bit of research, Jani. Thank you. There are some other traditions this would probably be a good place to point out.\n\nThe one (and for a long time only) source I recognized was Frazer’s The Golden Bough. That bit about the Laws of Magic — the law of contagion, the law of similarity, etc. — seems to come out of his syntheses.\n\nNow I can tell there is also a hermetic (and specifically alchemical) strain in there, too. The elementals there — undine and salamander — are not the traditionally pictured ones of the various European animist traditions, but seem to relate more to the alchemical theories of the four elements — undine\n\nbeing an incarnated water; salamander being an incarnated fire. (The other two are gnomes for earth and sylphs for air).\n\nAnother hermetic tradition seems to be referenced by the geomantry Amanda does — the complex geometric invocations instead of the simple Magic Circle. That\n\nseems to be Renaissance mathesis rather than mediaeval alchemy.\n\nBasically, Heinlein put a lot of *Stuff* in there. There is, for example, some of Paradise Lost in the demonology.\n\nIncidentally, while we are on this subject, I found a long letter of comment following the publication of “Magic, Inc.” in Unknown. The readers’ letters were not published with any consistency, so it was a stroke of luck to find one on this story. (There isn’t any for “They,” which would have been really neat).\n\nCAUTION: this reader has a very rigid mind and thinks there is only “One, True Answer” for any question, so don’t take his objections seriously.\n\nUnknown, February 1941, [160] R.B. Kimball, New York: “I definitely enjoyed “The Devil Makes the Law,” but I believe Heinlein might have chosen a more appropriate title — say, “Magic, Incorporated,” for instance — as actually, it was not the Devil who made the law — except in his own Half World — but Ditworth, a pseudohuman demon. [Campbell replies: “Actually, Heinlein’s original title was ‘Magic, Inc.’ We had to change it because ‘Magic’ constituted part of the preceding novel, ‘The Mathematics of Magic.'”]\n\n“Notwithstanding the fact that I derived great pleasure from his novel, and would be the first to welcome more of his yarns in Unknown, I am firmly of the opinion that R. Heinlein must have a wonderfully unabridged — and unique — dictionary at his disposal. Androids (p. 63), gonifs (p. 48), black and red grimoires (p. 2) [Ed. note: a grimoire is traditionally a spell book or “book of shadows.” Practitioners in many magical traditions keep detailed notes of their magic or alchemical workings] and Arcane Laws (pp. 21, 62) were never in any dictionary or encyclopedia I have ever referred to. Neither were stonkered (p.23), and apportation (p. 18) — the latter, though, might perhaps be justified as a futuristic term not thought up yet. Discommode (p. 48), a rare form of incommode, was used, and what on earth is a “goon squad” (p. 52)? Finally, mandragores and mandrakes were herbs the last I knew anything about them. So much for that. [Campbell replies: “Heinlein’s vocabulary of magical terms is authentic, his other words accepted colloquialisms.”]\n\n“What was it that flooded Archie Fraser’s store? From Jedson’s remark on page 17, I was under the impression that it was supposed to have been an undine– but an undine is a female water spirit — usually beautiful — and neither Cartier’s illustration of a monster slug, nor Heinlein’s unpleasant description of a rather disgusting shapeless something or other that ‘dripped and spread its slimy moisture to the edge of the magic ring,’ and ‘stank of fish, kelp and iodine’ seemed to bear out such an idea.\n\n“Another thing. According to the theory of Paracelsus, a salamander was a being who inhabited the elemental fire, and did not constitute it. A different theory is that it is a mythical animal having the power to endure fire without harm — but in either case, fire burns. Could it be that Heinlein’s specimen is a mutation?\n\n“My last criticism. Heinlein certainly picked a very novel assortment of characters to be wing commanders and the Fallen Thrones for Satan’s army of demons. Let me explain:\n\n“BEEZLEBUB — I believe this was just a misspelling of Beelzebub, the fallen angel ranking immediately below Satan.\n\n“LEVIATHAN — This name is either a product of Heinlein’s imagination, or was suggested by Thomas Hobbes’ great work, “The Leviathan,” which expounds his — Hobbes’ — theories of government. Or it may have been taken from the Biblical leviathan, an aquatic monster.\n\n“ASHTORETH — the goddess of fertility and sexual love. She was also regarded by the classical nations as a moon-goddess. (Not exactly the name for a demon.\n\nHow come Heinlein overlooked Belial?)\n\n“ABADDON — Ah, Heinlein is getting warmer. Abaddon is the name of the destroying angel of the bottomless pit. (See Rev. 9:11.)\n\n“MAMMON — In Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost,’ Mammon was the demon of Cupidity; in the Gospels, Mammon was a sort of personified riches.\n\n“THEUTUS — Heinlein seems to have been struggling with two ideas: Thetis, a Neried [sic] of Greek myth, and theurgy, a kind of occult art in which the operator may evoke the aid of beneficent spirits. Heinlein apparently compromised with himself and took a little of each. Result — Theutus.\n\n“ASMODEUS — a demon of Hebrew story who plays an important role in the book of Tobit.\n\n“INCUBUS — an evil demon supposed to haunt the sleep of mortals and cause nightmares.”\n\nAnd for the sake of completeness, from the same issue:\n\n[162] Eugene V. Walter, The Bronx, NY: “Sprague de Camp’s ‘Mathematics of Magic’ was simply de-lovely. More of Harold Shea and Reed Chalmers. Allister Park’s adventures were rather engrossing, and those of Archie in the incomparable ‘Devil Makes the Law’ were whacky but extremely amusing.”\n\nConcluding, I believe The White Goddess (Robert Graves) was published after WWII, wasn’t it? If so, it would be too late to have influenced “Magic, Inc.”\n\nW (Bill Patterson)\n\nSubject: Re: Early Notice–Poul Anderson Guest Visit\n\nDate: 4/6/00 7:30 PM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nFrom: BPRAL22169\n\nFWIW a copy of the “Magic Inc.” issue of Unknown (where it appeared as “The Devil Makes the Law” (Sept, 1940) is being offered for sale on E-bay.

She was aware that the classic authors of her youth were now mere shadows from the past, but that La Motte Fouque should have ceased to be even a shadow shook her…. ‘Undine was a water spirit. It’s a German legend. She fell in love with an earthly knight and married him, but in the end he was false to her and she disappeared in a cloud of spray from a fountain. One of the Chopin ballades puts the story into music.”\n\nThis sounds much prettier than Heinlein’s undine and of course is quite a recurring theme in fairy stories.

In the story the views are expressed by Jedson but this is one case where we can be certain that they are the views of the author. This is because they are almost identical to the views put forward in “Take Back Your Government.” Highgrading? Maybe. Compare; “Most women in the United States have a short-sighted, peasant individualism resulting from the male created romantic tradition of the last century. They were told that they were superior creatures, a little nearer to the angels than their menfolks. They were not encouraged to think, nor to assume social responsibility. It takes a strong mind to break out of that sort of conditioning, and most minds simply aren’t up to it, male or female. Consequently, women as electors are usually suckers for romantic knowledge. They can be flattered into misusing their ballot even more easily than men. In politics their self-righteous feeling of virtue, combined with their essentially peasant training, resulted in their introducing a type of cut-rate, petty chiselling that should make Boss Tweed spin in his coffin.” Whew! Try to get away with that today, I dare you! That little rant is from Magic Inc. Was it in “The Devil makes the Law” as well? Were there any revisions?\n\nThis is from TBYG; “We were told when Votes For Women was new, that women would bring higher moral standards and would eliminate the graft and corruption which the nasty old men had tolerated. Women have had an effect {…..} They have also brought political corruption to a new low. Whoops! Easy girls – please! quiet down. There are exceptions to all rules – you may be the exception to this one. That is for you to determine. Judge yourself. A great many women are willing to go to hell in a wheelbarrow. Their husbands may be politically just as dishonest but the gentler sex are usually willing to sell out for a lower price. They go for cut-rate corruption.” And later; “I am inclined to believe, although I am not sure, that the average difference in political honesty between men as a group and women as a group is actually considerable and not just a matter of a lower pay scale for corruption on the part of women. [….] I am of the opinion that women usually know less about political issues than men and consequently are less inclined to realize that political issues are of moral consequence.”\n\nTBYG was written in 1946, Magic Inc. in 1940. Obviously these were views that Heinlein felt strongly about; they were echoed in “A Bathroom of Her Own” where the female politician is shown as idealistic but politically naive. I am hesitant to link these views ( which obviously changed with the years) to his increasingly difficult marriage but it does seem one possible cause for such cynical bitterness. Even allowing for the time lag and the undoubted fact that in the earlier part of the century women were discouraged from having or forming political opinions he does seem to be rather unbalanced in his opinion. Not comfortable reading, even when all allowances have been made.\n\nJane\n\nSubject: Re: Magic in Magic Inc was Re:\n\nOT:I think it is sad…\n\nFrom: (AGplusone)\n\nDate: 4/7/00 4:23 PM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nJani:\n\n1.

One of them says (and I’m paraphrasing, big time) “I wonder when what we do will be better understood so that the science can be separated from the superstition?” We may have a somewhat analogous situation here, and RAH is aluding to it in that subtle way he has of adding texture to a story by simple off-handed comments.\n\nRandy\n\n—\n\nRandy J.

The scapular was a popular religious item worn by Roman Catholics back in the ’60s (I don’t know if they’re still used these days or not– I haven’t paid significant attention to Catholicism since the early ’70s.) The ones I’m familiar with had a pair of small cloth rectangles (maybe 2″ square) on a sort of necklace–you wore it so that one rectangle was on the front of your torso and one was on the back. There was a specific picture (a saint? a prayer? it’s been too long…) on each rectangle, and IIRC, if you were wearing one when you died you were guaranteed *not* to go to Hell.\n\nThe amulet described in “Magic Inc.” was “an unsavory wad of nothing in particular, about as appetizing as the bottom of a bird cage”.\n\nFunctionally, who knows? The implication in the story is that such amulets were more superstition than “real” magic–about like having a “lucky hat” to wear to ball games to make sure your team wins.

His amulet might not have worked but that isn’t known; the judgement is given (admittedly by someone who isn’t all that much of an expert) before more than the string around his neck is seen.\n\nJane\n\nSubject: Re: Magic in Magic Inc was\n\nRe: OT:I think it is sad…\n\nFrom: “Jani”\n\nDate: 4/8/00 11:59 AM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nIMO, the difference is between “certain remarkable developments in human knowledge in general use which are commonly referred to by the laity as magic” -which I would see as Waldo’s “aborted sciences” allowed to grow and flourish in Archie’s world – and matters of belief which are a separate issue. For instance, Zack isn’t allowed to practise magic because of his religion, magic doesn’t work over consecrated ground, and there is nothing to show that charlatans and “headologists” can’t still influence the ignorant. I think the Sicilian reference is to the Mafia, since that would be a reasonable association for an American reader of the time to make, and Joe’s comment about “he did all that to himself, because he believed in it” bears out the mobster’s superstitious/credulous mentality. So the magic would *work* (depending on how competent the magician was) in the same way that a car will *work” if the mechanic and driver know what they’re doing … but both of ’em could still be wearing unappetising amulets while they’re working on the engine. <g>\n\n(Sticking my neck out here) Jane, did you see a similarity between Star’s geometric magic and Amanda’s invocation of the elementals?

It’s an interesting idea and really, it’s a lot easier to accept than magic playing by different rules than the rest of the world. If what magic does and it is firmly grounded in reality, then a potion that causes you to fall in love may be as reasonable as a Lemsip potion to cure a cold.\n\nStar’s version of magic seems to straddle the line even more; possibly because she comes from such a technologically advanced society. We all know the Clarke line about magic and science; I think that’s what we are looking at here.\n\nJane\n\nSubject: Re: Magic in Magic Inc was\n\nRe: OT:I think it is sad…\n\nFrom: Gary Greene\n\nDate: 4/7/00 7:10 PM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nI’m a Quaker these days but I was raised Catholic and did my turn as an altar boy too …”ad Deum que latificat juventutem meum”… :-> remember that much of my Mass, among other bits.\n\nLike the old saying goes, you can take the boy out of Catholicism, but you can’t quite take the Catholicism out of the boy.\n\nWhen you said scapular, I thought you referred to the little cloth “badges” (for want of a better word) that were blessed by the priests that we wore as devotionals along with our crucifix.

Ever notice the wrist bands and necklaces some recent Asian-American folk wear?\n\nIf I wanted to jump on Heinlein’s portrayal of the mafia hood imported from the ‘east’ who offers Archie protection, I’d have asked why he didn’t mention the neat spats on his shoes, color-cordinated with the silk handkerchief in his breast pocket and his wide tie.\n\nAnd I still wouldn’t have been surprised to see the string of the amulet (scapular, what’s the difference?) on the back of his neck.\n\nTell me, Yisroel, what am I likely to see a little unusual worn by someone extorting a shopkeeper near Brighton Beach, assuming such a terrible thing could possibly occur? 😉\n\n—\n\nDavid M.

Heinlein Reading Group\n\nAOL: Thursday, April 13, 2000,\n\nfrom 9 PM to midnight, EDT (Eastern US Daylight Time)\n\nAIM: Saturday, April 15, 2000,\n\nfrom 5 to 8 PM, EDT\n\nEminent author Poul Anderson will visit us on the above dates and discuss Robert A. Heinlein’s novella Magic, Inc. and his own two sequels, the novels: Operation Chaos and Operation Luna, as well as his longtime friendship with RAH, his own other works, and whatever else can come up in two three-hour meetings.\n\nAnyone is free to attend either or both meetings. The Thursday meeting on AOL will be held in a chat room TBA (it depends on what response we anticipate–it’ll be either the regular chatroom, known as “Barnes III” that we use, e.g., Keyword “BN” –>reading groups chatrooms–>Barnes III, or it’ll be a larger room called an ECR that we’ll announce). If you’re not a member of AOL all you need to do is establish a so-called 30-day trial account by downloading AOL software from http://www.aol.com, or installing it using one of those CD ROMs you might have around that haven’t been warped beyond use by using it as a hot drink coaster or Frisbee or clay pigeon, use it and then decide whether you want to keep the account before your trial period runs out. If you do, that’s your choice. Steve Case wouldn’t offer the choice if he didn’t think it worthwhile to him; and I don’t work for Steve and didn’t set up this chat to benefit him either.\n\nWhether you’re on AOL or not, to attend the AIM chat, download the AIM 3.0 software from http://www.aol.com/aim/home.html, install it and make sure you get the name you register to me–because you don’t get into the chat room by invitation unless I know that name and you’ve notified me.\n\nYou may attend either or as much of both as you need. We may, depending on size, use a little protocol for the chat … as little as possible and for a short a time as possible. I’ll let you know later and I or someone helping me will let you know again at the beginning of or when you join the meeting.\n\nSo much for procedures … now it’s time to get things started formally on these boards to discuss what we’re about to talk to Mr. Anderson (and his lovely wife Karen at her keyboard) about.\n\nI’ve been a little busy, but I met them last Saturday at a meeting they invited me to as they happened to be attending it in North Hollywood and I can tell you two things: (1) they are both wonderful people, and (2) don’t believe for a second that Mr. Anderson has even lost a step–I listened to him give a taped radio interview–at his age. Expect a good chat!\n\nOthers will post this thread about Mr. Anderson’s writings in general and specifically. I’ve only read some of his writings, although I will tell you one thing: about the early 1960s while I was overseas I gave up on science fiction for over twenty years, except for Heinlein, and one other writer whom I read occasionally–I was really sort of busy–and his name was Poul Anderson.\n\nI’d like to just start off with a couple points:\n\nI’m forced by Jani and others to reread Magic, Inc., if for no other reason that to avoid putting my foot in my mouth by forgetting details such as Ms. Jennings’ last name and the species of denizens of the other world that appear.\n\nSo I started rereading it, for the first time critically, today. Two things I note–(1) a setting that may require a bit more than normal comment, and (2) what it’s really about, and what that may require on certain preconceptions about the Author’s point of view–whether it indeed ever changed.\n\nAs to setting:\n\nThe best way to fully understand Heinlein’s setting is to have seen a lot of 1920s and 30s Hollywood movies–the kind of wise movie that Edgar G. Robinson or Jimmy Cagney might have played in. This is a hip, gangster, or sophisticated setting–maybe even Nick and Nora Charles movies, to understand the slang and some of the references and allusions. The biggest allusion of all, of course, is the title.\n\nIn the ’20s and ’30s in the US crime lord Charles (“Lucky”) Luciano, before he was imprisoned, consolidated organized crime under his sole rule. When all else failed, he killed his rivals for that title. The means was a part of his organization run by a lieutenant named Albert Anastasia. It was called “Murder, Inc.” Everyone knew about it except J. Edgar Hoover, who denied until much later there was even a thing called the “Mafia” in the US.\n\nThere may be questions about details of this setting, or allusions. Ask them in this thread.\n\nAs to what it’s all about:\n\nThis novella is about a violation of law particularly topical to today. It’s about American antitrust law. Set and written in a time before most of\n\nus were born and most of you were even conceived, the story is a classic about a conspiracy in restraint of trade. I don’t want this thread to turn into an off-topic debate about whether Bill Gates and Microsoft “should” be penalized. That’s not the issue: what is the issue is how typically RAH sets the stage and how classically he demonstrates how it’s done.\n\nStage One:\n\nSomeone decides to monopolize. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a predator like Rockefeller with oil, or a trade association, or a professional association or even, a union of employees. First step: form an association “for the betterment” of the industry, profession, or employees–talk about construction standards in say, electrical wiring, or ethical standards among real estate salesmen–RAH tried selling real estate before he turned to writing–or\n\nefficiencies of scale. It doesn’t matter what you say to gull the gullible, what you’re after is exclusion of your competitors and something to convince the peepul that you’re acting for their benefit until you can start fixing the prices.\n\nSecond step: sign up your market–doesn’t matter whether it’s a standard area union contract, a mandatory licensing scheme for the profession, or offering cut-rate but exclusive contracts to your customers. Tie them in by contract or other legality! And then start fixing the price.\n\nThird step: get laws passed to perpetuate the situation forever to your advantage. Step three can come before two or one … or all of them can come together at once. Doesn’t matter how you do it, so long as the end is you have laws justifying what you do–call them regulations by an administrative agency you control that set the mandatory rates you want it to allow you to charge–and limit competition, by whatever rationale it uses; and by ‘n by you’ll have your monopoly.\n\nWhat do we think about this viewpoint by RAH? How does it tie to, for example, his distrust of corporations in Friday or Citizen of the Galaxy?\n\nHow did it evolve later? Do you think he ever changed his mind about the undesirability of a monopolized business or trade or labor market?\n\nNow there’s lots of other things to talk about … and I’m looking forward to as much as we can dredge up before a week from now … when the AOL chat takes place, and the Saturday thereafter, when the AIM chat takes place.\n\nI’m ready for Magic! Get ready too.\n\nDavid\n\n—\n\nAGPlusOne\n\n“The Lieutenant expects your names to shine!”\n\n–Robert Anson Heinlein, USNA ’29, Lt.(j.g.)\n\nUSN, Retired, 1907-1988\n\nSubject: Re: Early Notice–Poul Anderson Guest Visit\n\nDate: 4/7/00 9:56 AM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nFrom: AGplusone\n\nI happen to be one of those who thinks Heinlein cannot be trusted not to play around with the names of his major characters. Archibald Fraser — interesting name, and he wears his tartan as a tie.\n\narchi- [see ARCH] a prefix meaning 1. chief, first and 2. _biology_ primitve, original\n\nArchibald [of Gmc. origin (akin to OHG _Erchanbald_) prob. nobly bold] a masculine name.\n\nThe name Fraser evidently traces its roots from the French word for strawberry, and the family is believed to have originated in the provinces of Anjou and Normandy. The Fraser arms are silver strawberries on a field of blue, and their motto is “All my hope is in God.”\n\nThere are two branches of Clan Fraser today, the line of the original Laird of the clan having gone extinct, in 1720, when Charles, 4th Lord Fraser, died without issue or collateral male heirs. His seat was Castle Fraser, near Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, under the care of the National Trust for Scotland.\n\nThe present senior branch of the clan are the Frasers of Philorth-Lords Saltoun, descended from the Frasers of Touch-fraser, tracing their line back to one Sir Gilbert Fraser, somewhere in the 1300s.\n\nThe junior branch of the clan are the Frasers of Lovat, whose arms are a buck’s head erased proper, and motto is Je suis prest (I am ready).\n\nThe Lovat Frasers are descended from a brother of Alexander Fraser, Tenth Lord Saltoun (who acquired that title in 1669). The seat of the chiefs of Lovat was Castle Dounie from 1511 until it was burned following Culloden. The chiefs are called MacShimi, which means son of Simon, of whom more later.\n\nUndoubtedly, considering the subject matter of Magic, Inc., the use of the surname Fraser for RAH’s main character may have been a tip of the hat to the man today who is probably the most famous historical Fraser, at least to academics.\n\nSir James George Frazer, 1854-1941 (Frazer is a sept of the senior branch of the clan, the Frasers of Saltoun). Scots anthropologist and folklorist, born Glasgow, educated at Larchfield Academy, Helensburgh, at Glasgow University and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he because a classics fellow. Admitted to the English bar in 1879, he never practised, turning his attention to anthropology which together with his classic training produced beginning in 1890, _The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religions, 12 vols, 1890-1915, which is *the* classic named after the golden bough in the sacred grove at Nemi, near Rome. His other works included several, but also notably, after “Magic, Inc.” was written, alas, _Magic and Religion_ (1944). He was professor of social anthropology at Liverpool (1907-08) and Cambridge (from 1908).\n\nThere were other Frasers who have stood out in history, including an explorer of large portions of Canada, after whom a large river is named, another who was first sea lord and signed the articles surrender in Tokyo Bay in 1945, even a pretty good lady swimmer; but let’s get back to why the Lords Lovat are called the sons of Simon.\n\nSimon Fraser, Lord Lovat (c. 1667-1747) Scottish chief, born Tomich in Ross-shire, graduated from Aberdeen in 1695. In 1696 his father on the death of his grandnephew, Lord Lovat, assumed that title, and next year, Simon, after failing to abduct the late lord’s daughter and heiress, a child nine years old, forcibly married her mother, a lady of the Atholl family–a crime for which he was found guilty of high treason and outlawed. In 1699 he succeeded his father as twelfth Lord Lovat, in 1702 he fled to france, but a year later returned to Scotland as a Jacobite agent and because involved in the abortive Queensberry plot which forced him once more to escape to France. In 1715 he took the government side; his clan left the Jacobite rebels and he obtained a full pardon with possession of the Lovat title and estates. In the 1745 Jocobite Rising Lovat sent his son and clan to fight for the young Pretender Charles Edward Stewart while he protested his loyalty to the government. After all those bonnets lay dead on the field of Culloden he fled, but was captured and taken to London for trial. He defended himself with ability and dignity and met death by beheading with the same combination of gallantry and cynicism that had served him so well in life.\n\nCourage, boldness and resourcefulness, and a very tricky gentleman indeed.\n\nAfter the writing of “Magic Inc” another Lord Lovat distinguished himself for the first noted quality. Take a look at Zanuck’s _The Longest Day_ sometime. Remember the character leading the commandos ashore in the white sweater (so the boys could see him leading from the front, but the better to earn you a sniper’s bullet, my dear), played by Peter Lawford, who led the commandos off the beach and on to timely relief of Major Howard and the glider airborne troops who took those bridges, with his piper piping alongside him. That was the late Lord Lovat, father of the present one, I believe.

They were also personal friends whose contacts became more frequent after the Heinleins moved to Santa Cruz in 1966 (Anderson has for a very long time lived in the Bay Area community of Orinda). Anderson’s warm appreciation of Heinlein can be found in Part III of REQUIEM. They also have in common that they are both SFWA Grand Masters. RAH received the first SFWA Grand Master award in 1974 (presented at the 1975 Awards banquet), and Anderson received his in 1998. They are both members of a very small and select group: writers who make their living exclusively from commercial writing of speculative fiction (including both science fiction and fantasy). This is a tribute to Anderson’s hard work, thoroughgoing writerly skill, and enduring popularity.\n\nI found over 1700 entries for Poul Anderson on Yahoo, most of them author lists of varying degrees of dependability and organization. The publication dates given for the different books varies greatly from list to list, and I was not able to find in my short research a reliable biography online. The information does exist, but I can only give a short sketch of Anderson’s writing at this point, largely from memory of the time I saw him frequently at SF conventions in the 1970’s. Corrections or amplifications will be gratefully solicited.\n\nBorn in November 1926, and nurtured in midwestern science fiction fandom, his first published science fiction story appeared in Astounding in 1947, and he has written consistently and prolifically since then. He has been married to sf fan (and writer) Karen since, I believe, the mid-1960s. He is an affable and charming individual who, at conventions, is seen with a bottle of beer — Lowenbrau by preference — surgically attached to one hand.\n\nHe established himself in the 1950’s as a master writer of science fiction with a series of remarkable novels — Brain Wave (1954), Three Hearts and Three Lions (1954) (a moving book that set new standards for the deCampian fantasy), The Broken Sword, and, one of my personal read-many-times favorites, The High Crusade (1960). With fellow sf fan-turned-writer, Gordon Dickson he wrote humorous sf stories about the Hoka, which have been turned into four collections starting in 1957 with Earthman’s Burden. His stories of diplomat Dominick Flandry and trader Nicholas van Rijn came together in a remarkable series of future history collections and novels that go by the portmanteau name of The Polesotechnic League. His writing in the 1960’s culminated in the remarkable 1969 novel, Tau Zero, which narrowly missed a Hugo, losing to Larry Niven’s perhaps equally remarkable Ringworld. In a 1997 interview with Locus magazine, Anderson was asked which five books he would like to be remembered for, and he named Tau Zero, saying:\n\n“I like that one especially. It was some-\n\nwhat of a tour de force, and I think it\n\ngot across what I was trying for.\n\nMidsummer Tempest [1974], certainly. And\n\nThe Boat of a Million Years [1989] — that’s\n\nactually borderline between science fiction\n\nand fantasy. Three Hearts and Three Lions\n\nI have an affection for. For number five,\n\nI was hesitating over half a dozen, but\n\nThe Enemy Stars will do. I wish I could\n\nget a really good single idea like that —\n\none you can run all over the field with,\n\noftener. That is what science fiction\n\ndoes best. Brain Wave, old as it is, could\n\nbe on that list, too.”\n\nRecently, Anderson (paralleling Heinlein’s progression as an older writer) has begun writing very large scale works, the four-volume Starfarers series was currently in production at the time of the Locus interview.\n\nW (Bill Patterson)\n\nSubject: AIM chat–Poul Anderson’s Operations\n\nChaos and Luna\n\nFrom: (AGplusone)\n\nDate: 4/11/00 4:53 PM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nPoul Anderson’s Operation Chaos (1971) This is the first of the two novels Mr. Anderson wrote ‘in the universe’ of Robert A. Heinlein’s novella Magic, Inc. Rereading it reminds me why, when I ceased reading science-fiction and fantasy for a number of years after the early 1960s, I continued reading Anderson. The novel was originally four stand-alone short stories published in the Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. When they were collected and published together under the name Operation Chaos in 1971, Mr. Anderson wrote interstitial material to string them together, much as Zenna Henderson did with her collections of the “People” tales for the two collections of her short stories. There’s a brief passage between the first two stories of Operation Chaos that brings to mind the reason I always liked to read Anderson’s work, even when written in the most fantastic genres of the most unlikely things:\n\n“The real business of people is not strife\n\nor danger or melodrama; it’s work, especially\n\nif they’re so fortunate as to enjoy what they\n\ndo; it’s recreation and falling in love and\n\nraising families and telling jokes and stumbling\n\ninto small pleasant adventures,”\n\nfrom the Interlude, Cp. VIII, pp. 50-51 paperbound edition. Operation Chaos and its sequel, Operation Luna, is about a perfectly ordinary couple–given their exemplary intelligence and characters–Steve Matuchek and Virginia Graylock, who meet during wartime, World War II, in fact, while serving their country, have adventures, some rather melodramatic and dangerous, fall in love and, after the war, marry and raise a daughter. They are perfectly ordinary except that they live in another of the multiuniverses–or multiverses as Michael Crighton’s recent Timeline calls them–in which magic exists; and Steve is a werewolf while Virginia is a witch. Given that, the setting is somewhat fun to read … with some practical touches that I find worked out well. In “Operation Afreet” for example, the first of the stories, it’s World War II, as noted, but in a different world with a different history. The Axis powers may have Germany territory, but a Germany that is under the Saracen Caliphate, i.e., I think Charles Martel lost the big one at Tours, or that Roland and Oliver didn’t hold that pass long enough for Charlemagne to escape Spain with his Army. Or maybe Don Juan of Austria lost Lepanto. I wonder who planted the first American colony. Just guessing, I’d think they never left Leif Erickson’s Vinland the Good, considering the author. <VEG> It’s a World War II in which the enemy is on the territory of the Continental US; and whatever is left of Europe outside the Caliphate is fighting, if anything, a guerilla war, or awaiting a MacArthur’s call to rise, and “strike home!” Turtledove or Drake fans might enjoy this tremendously. [By the way, speaking of Turtledove, he wrote yet another novel in this ‘universe,’ named, I am told, something like “The Case of the Toxic Spellda,” a detective story or stories. Another one to track down and put on the to be read ASAP pile.]\n\nSteve and Virginia are given a joint mission behind enemy lines, a Jedburgh mission, so to speak. The enemy has a superweapon–an Afreet, which can potentially throw the Allied Armies into full retreat, and it must be nullified. What’s an Afreet? Go read The Thousand and One Nights (whatever version you may have available, and look for the tale of the fisherman and the bottle) or perhaps if you can find a copy, of Tennyson’s “Solomon’s Seal.”\n\nYou’ll love the use made of Alfred Korzybski’s paramount principle by Captain Graylock against the afreet. Quite a bit more clever than the fisherman in answering the eternal question “How do you get the djini back into the jar?”\n\nThere’s more than a bit of adventure, melodrama, and danger in these stories. For example, bearing in mind that Poul Anderson wrote the interludes some time around 1971, what do you think, if you’ve read it, about Steve Matuchek’s ruminations about the fundamental psyche of a country overrun by an enemy even for a short time in immediate post war period before he returns to college to studying engineering?\n\nSteve concludes, with benefit of hindsight, that a significant part of the country had become unbalanced with ‘demagogues, self-appointed prophets, would be necromancers, nut cultists in religion, politics, dieting, life style and Lord knows what’–but exactly what country and what war is he talking about?\n\nOne of the European countries following World War 2 in our world? Perhaps even the US with McCarthyism about to unleash itself? Or is he possibly talking about 1971 in our world, and the malaise affecting us arising out to the ‘defeat’ of Vietnam?–after all, our own self-appointed and network anointed prophet Cronkite had declared that war lost two years earlier during the battle of Tet.\n\nLots of things in these stories. What do you folk think? Remember, only two days left to post your thoughts before the AOL meeting, and four days before the AIM meeting. I hope you all attend both meetings.

Heinlein’s novella Magic, Inc.\n\nI wonder if the first three novelets were so much “written in the universe of” “Magic, Inc.” as they simply used the same set of assumptions — i.e., “industrial magic.” Though, clearly, the last of the novelets is an homage specifically to “Magic, Inc.”\n\nWhat I most like about these two books of Andersons is the rolling-on-the-floor funniness of them. Steve Matuchek finds work as an actor in Hollywood after the war — doing a Rin-Tin-Tin type series (he’s a werewolf, see — ). And they conjure Bolyai and Lobachevsky as guides for their trip into the Hell universe. And the bit about the FBI undercover demon is priceless as he — well, you get the picture.\n\nAlthough the overall tone of Operation Luna is somewhat more somber, it still has those wild moments of pawky humor — Ginny’s trip to Yggsdrasil, for example, and comments about Swedes and coffee. You think ROFL is a metaphor — not always!\n\nBill\n\nSubject: Re: AIM chat–Poul Anderson’s Operations\n\nChaos and Luna\n\nFrom:\n\nDate: 4/12/00 7:33 AM Pacific Daylight Time\n\nRe: The Operation Chaos stories’ relation to Magic, Inc.\n\nDefinitely not the same universe/history, but yes, similar assumptions. And Turtledove’s _The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump_ is also not in the same universe as either. Nor the HBO movies “Cast a Deadly Spell” and “Witch Hunt”, which I also recommend (the former is better than the latter).\n\nRe: Steve Matucek as actor\n\nHe’d been a successful actor before the war — after the war, due to his wounds (losing much of his tail), his work was less satisfactory both to himself and the studio, so he went back to college.\n\nRe: The FBI undercover demon\n\nHmm? The FBI undercover demon was in _Magic, Inc._, not in Anderson’s stories.\n\nRe: The Humor of the stories\n\nAnd the mention of _The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump_as a thriller that Steve was too distracted to concentrate on.\n\n—\n\nWard Griffiths\n\nhttp://members.home.net/wdg3rd/\n\n“No matter how deep you’ve buried it, never\n\nunderestimate the ability of shit to find\n\na fan”\n\nF.

I can’t choose a favourite but I did giggle aloud at Britannia waiving the rules and the joke about the dwarf and the fake passport; “dwarves can forge anything.”\n\nI notice that there is a lot of emphasis on different types of magic than the ones in Magic Inc, particularly those of the American Indians. I felt some familiarity here from my reading of the Tom Deitz books that cover this; he has a great series set mainly in Georgia which covers the Anasazi and Hopi magics plus dealings with the Sidhe. I recommend them without having the faintest idea how accurate the descriptions of the rituals are but they feel right.\n\nI also saw that in the book, Steve and Ginny’s daughter is reading the latest book about Magister Lazarus by Lyle Monroe….<sigh> Lucky universe to still have new books by that author 🙂\n\nJane\n\nCHAT LOG — ONLINE VISIT WITH POUL ANDERSON\n\nThursday, April 13, 2000\n\nExtract from David’s Log:\n\n4/13/2000 5:30:13 PM Opening “RAH Chat Log 4/13/2000”\n\nAGplusone: Thursday, April 13, 2000, 5:31:37 PM, PDT\n\nAGplusone: Robert Heinlein wrote science fiction, from 1939 to 1988, over forty novels and collections. He was called the “Dean of Science Fiction” and won the first awarded Grand Master Nebula Award for lifetime achievement.\n\nAGplusone: Bye. Come back again …\n\n\\¼¼¼/ \\¼¼¼/ \\¼¼¼/\n\nAGplusone: _||_ _||_ _||_ Champagne, anyone?\n\nBookOworm: Hi David… just checking out the room 🙂 What time does the chat start…9….I lost my train of thought today\n\nAGplusone: Hi, Max, just checking my macros. In 27 minutes. Boy, so did I\n\nOnlineHost: Poul Anderson has entered the room.\n\nAGplusone: Hi, Karen, meet Marsha, who’ll be helping me … actually she’s my ex-boss. So ‘helping’ is a little inaccurate.\n\nAGplusone: I’m testing my macros right now.\n\nBookOworm: LOL… Hi Poul 🙂\n\nPoul Anderson: K: At last — I’ve been trying to get on, and send and e-mail, for about half an hour. Hi, M\n\nAGplusone: Welcome to the Robert A. Heinlein Reading Group. Tonight we are honored by visitor Poul Anderson. He’s here to discuss anything he’d like, but we’ve all read Robert Heinlein’s Magic, Inc. and his novels Operation Chaos and Operation Luna in anticipation of this visit..\n\nAGplusone: :::\n\nDenvToday: Greetings to one and all.\n\nAGplusone: Before we begin I have to note we will operate under a protocol at least for the beginning of the meeting. If you have a question, type “?” and if you have a statement, type “!” and we’ll recognize you in order. MikeC89102 will keep and will call on you in order.\n\n:::\n\nAny questions before we begin?\n\n:::\n\nAGplusone: Hi, Denv, just testing my macros.\n\nPoul Anderson: Hi, Marsha, Poul isn’t on yet, this is Karen.\n\nDenvToday: Very impressive, AG. lol\n\nBookOworm: Hi Karen 🙂\n\nAGplusone: ROFL, actually. 🙂 Do you have any you need to test, Karen? We can leave if you wish.\n\nDenvToday: Mrs. Anderson, I’m about one hundred pages into Operation Luna. You must find the acknowledgement very touching.\n\nPoul Anderson: K: Does the ? or ! precede or follow the question/statement it identifies?\n\nAGplusone: Or we can go into informal … yes, what happens is that Mike when he comes will call on the next question or statement.\n\nDenvToday: The only people who have acknowledged me lately are my creditors and the IRS.\n\nPoul Anderson: K: About the acknowledgement, yes indeed. I hope you’re enjoying the book.\n\nAGplusone: Them too, huh? You and me, Denv. I am … it arrived finally today.\n\nDenvToday: It’s excellent, as always. I’ve been on a Poul Anderson jag lately. I just re-read Boat of a Million Years and Trader to the Stars.\n\nAGplusone: I am boggled by the fun I’m having. Hi, Candy, welcome!\n\nDenvToday: lol AG.\n\nCandyLC: Hi David\n\nDenvToday: Not to mention the Anson Guthrie novels a few months ago.\n\nAGplusone: Karen, Candy is the coleader of the Great Sci-Fi and the Fantasy reading group here.\n\nCandyLC: Hi Karen\n\nPoul Anderson: David, I have some answers to possible questions, should I send them privately so you can ask the questions?\n\nBookOworm: Here is my autowelcome…\n\nBookOworm: Welcome To our Chat! Tonights Guest is Author, Poul Anderson! Chat Etiquette: Please Type a ? or a ! for a Question or Comment. Wait to be Called On 🙂\n\nCandyLC: Nicely done, Marsha\n\nAGplusone: {maybe you all might talk … ?} Sure, if you wish to test them. That’s great Maxy, and thank you, ex-boss, for helping out, as always. Marsha says what I say in about 15% of the words. Always …\n\nCandyLC: LOL, she always chopped away anything I wrote, too.\n\nDenvToday: Conciseness is highly overrated…especially if you’re being paid by the word.\n\nAGplusone: GA, Karen … (GA=go ahead)\n\nBookOworm: Give me a break…normally I only fix spelling errors…VEG\n\nAGplusone: stop picking on my former profession, Denv … I quit it!\n\nDenvToday: lol Sorry AG.\n\nDenvToday: But it is my current profession…despite what my agent may tell you.\n\nAGplusone: Ah, and you loved Rainmaker too, I suppose. those sharks were great.\n\nBookOworm: AG… all you really want me around for is to handle auto IM’s and any troublemakers?\n\nDenvToday: Rainmaker??\n\nCandyLC: And your pleasant company, Marsha.\n\nAGplusone: The Grisham novel made into a movie. Loved every minute of it.\n\nDenvToday: Oh, yes. I try to block out all things Grisham.\n\nAGplusone: Hi, Bill, welcome.\n\nAGplusone: Me too, generally, but those sharks in his office were just too good.\n\nBPRAL22169: Thanks. I thought I’d arrive a little early.\n\nDenvToday: Lawyers depress me. lol\n\nAGplusone: Karen is on … say hello. And welcome David, our benefactor.\n\nAGplusone: Me too.\n\nBPRAL22169: Karen; delighted to see you again (figuratively speaking)\n\nBPRAL22169: David, thank you exceedingly much\n\nAGplusone: I loved the line in Operation Luna, saying: after detailing the changes in various professions, that law school always involved the magic and so didn’t change at all. I have a theory … but I’ll let it evolve during discussion. When we begin in ten minutes or so.\n\nBPRAL22169: And Poul, too, of course.\n\nDenvToday: Did you all catch the Heinlein reference in Operation Luna?\n\nBookPotato: Glad to be able to help.. I am a life-long SF reader…\n\nPoul Anderson: K: Poul is ready to come on. Here’s a squirt from him–\n\nPoul Anderson: Good evening. Thank you for inviting me. This is an honor and will surely be a pleasure. However, It’s my first experience of any such thing, and I’m doing it with the help of my wife Karen, who’s much better with a computer than I am. So if —\n\nCandyLC: Hiya Mike\n\nAGplusone: Okay. I think she got booted for scrolling. Too fast.\n\nAGplusone: Hi, Mike.\n\nBPRAL22169: A procedural question, before we start? Are we vulnerable to — that answers my question.\n\nCandyLC: Yep, the macro puntskies\n\nAGplusone: We’ll get her back, which is why I suggested she test them\n\nDenvToday: That’s why God invented Power Tools.\n\nMikeC89102: Hi everyone 🙂 (setting up the queue)\n\nAGplusone: Agree.\n\nDenvToday: Hello Mike.\n\nAGplusone: Hi, Mike … we’ll start in about ten minutes or so.
