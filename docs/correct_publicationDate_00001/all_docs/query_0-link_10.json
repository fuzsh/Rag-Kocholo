A seed is quite another order of being to the murderous majesty of a toppling tree. A match flame can become a holocaust.\n\nAnd the chain of events that can unseat the rulers of galaxies can begin in a cozy living room, before a hearth....\n\nOutwardly, the comfortable (if somewhat splendidly furnished) living room of the home of the Richard Ballinger Seatons of Earth presented a peaceful scene. Peaceful? It was sheerly pastoral! Seaton and Dorothy, his spectacularly auburn-haired wife, sat on a davenport, holding hands. A fire of pine logs burned slowly, crackling occasionally and sending sparks against the fine bronze screen of the fireplace. Richard Ballinger Seaton Junior lay on the rug, trying doggedly, silently, and manfully, if unsuccessfully, to wriggle toward those entrancing flames.\n\nInwardly, however, it was very much otherwise. Dorothy's normally pleasant--as well as beautiful--face wore a veritable scowl.\n\nThe dinner they had just eaten had been over two hours late; wherefore not one single item of it had been fit to feed to a pig. Furthermore, and worse, Dick was not relaxed and was not paying any attention to her at all. He was still wound up tight; was still concentrating on the multitude of messages driving into his brain through the button in his left ear--messages of such urgency of drive that she herself could actually read them, even though she was wearing no apparatus whatever.\n\nShe reached up, twitched the button out of his ear, and tossed it onto a table. \"Will you please lay off of that stuff for a minute, Dick?\" she demanded. \"I'm fed up to the eyeballs with this business of you killing yourself with all time work and no time sleep. You never had any such horrible black circles under your eyes before and you're getting positively scrawny. You've got to quit it. Can't you let somebody else carry some of the load? Delegate some authority?\"\n\n\"I'm delegating all I possibly can already, Red-Top.\" Seaton absently rubbed his ear. Until Dorothy had flipped it away, the button had been carrying to him a transcription of the taped reports of more than one hundred Planetary Observers from the planet of Norlamin, each with the IQ of an Einstein and the sagacity of an owl. The last report had had to do with plentiful supplies of X metal that had been turned up on a planet of Omicron Eridani, and the decision to dispatch a fleet of cargo-carrying ships to fetch them away.\n\nBut he admitted grudgingly to himself that that particular decision had already been made. His wife was a nearer problem. Paying full attention to her now, he put his arm around her and squeezed.\n\n\"Converting a whole planet practically all at once to use fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-order stuff is a job of work, believe me. It's all so new and so tough that not too many people can handle any part of it. It takes brains. And what makes it extra tough is that altogether too many people who are smart enough to learn it are crooks. Shysters--hoodlers--sticky-fingers generally. But I think we're just about over the hump. I wouldn't wonder if these Norlaminian 'Observers'--snoopers, really--from the Country of Youth will turn out to be the answer to prayer.\"\n\n\"They'd better,\" she said, darkly. \"At least, something had better.\"\n\n\"Besides, if you think I look like the wrath of God, take a good look at Mart sometime. He's having more grief than I am.\"\n\n\"I already have; he looks like a refugee from a concentration camp. Peggy was screaming about it this morning, and we're both going to just simply...\"\n\nWhat the girls intended to do was not revealed, for at that moment there appeared in the air before them the projected simulacra of eight green-skinned, more-or-less-human men; the men with whom they had worked so long; the ablest thinkers of the Central System.\n\nThere was majestic Fodan, the Chief of the Five of Norlamin; there was white-bearded Orion, the First of Astronomy; Rovol, the First of Rays; Astron, the First of Energy; Drasnik, the First of Psychology; Satrazon and Caslor, the Firsts of Chemistry and of Mechanism, respectively; and--in some ways not the least--there was that powerhouse of thought, Sacner Carfon the two thousand three hundred forty-sixth: the hairless, almost porpoise-like Chief of the Council of the watery planet Dasor. They were not present in the flesh. But their energy projections were as seemingly solid as Seaton's own tall, lean body.\n\n\"We come, Overlord of the System, upon a matter of--\" the Chief of the Five began.\n\n\"Don't call me 'Overlord'. Please.\" Seaton broke in, with grim foreboding in his eyes, while Dorothy stiffened rigidly in the circle of his arms. Both knew that those masters of thought could scarcely be prevailed upon to leave their own worlds even via projection. For all eight of them to come this far--almost halfway across the galaxy!--meant that something was very wrong indeed.\n\n\"I've told you a dozen times, not only I ain't no Overlord but I don't want to be and won't be. I don't like to play God--I simply have not got what it takes.\"\n\n\"'Coordinator', then, which is of course a far better term for all except the more primitive races,\" Fodan went imperturbably on. \"We have told you, youth, not a dozen times, but once, which should have been sufficient, that your young and vigorous race possesses qualities that our immensely older peoples no longer have. You, as the ablest individual of your race, are uniquely qualified to serve total civilization. Thus, whenever your services become necessary, you will so serve. Your services have again become necessary. Orion, in whose province the matter primarily lies, will explain.\"\n\nSeaton nodded to himself. It was going to be bad, all right, he thought as the First of Astronomy took over.\n\n\"You, friend Richard, with some help from us, succeeded in encapsulating a group of malignant immaterial entities, including the disembodied personality of your fellow-scientist Doctor Marc C. DuQuesne, in a stasis of time. This capsule, within which no time whatever could or can elapse, was launched into space with a linear acceleration of approximately three times ten to the twelfth centimeters per second squared. It was designed and powered to travel at that acceleration for something over one hundred thousand million Tellurian years; at the end of which time it was to have been rotated through the fourth dimension into an unknown and unknowable location in normal three-dimensional space.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Seaton said. \"And it will. It'll do just exactly that. Those pure-intellectual louses are gone for good; and so is Blackie DuQuesne.\"\n\n\"You err, youth,\" corrected the Norlaminian. \"You did not allow us time sufficient to consider and to evaluate all the many factors involved. Rigid analysis and extended computation show that the probability approaches unity that the capsule of stasis will, almost certainly within one Tellurian year of its launching and highly probably in much less time, encounter celestial matter of sufficient density to volatilize its uranium power bars. This event will of course allow the stasis of time to collapse and the imprisoned immaterial entities will be liberated; in precisely the same condition as in the instant of their encapsulation.\"\n\nDorothy Seaton gasped. Even her husband showed that he was shaken. DuQuesne and the Immortals free? But--\n\n\"But it can't!\" he fairly yelled the protest. \"It'll dodge--it's built to dodge anything that dense!\"\n\n\"At ordinary--or even extraordinary--velocities, yes,\" the ancient sage agreed, unmoved. \"Its speed of reaction is great, yes; a rather small fraction of a trillionth of a second. That interval of time, however, while small, is very large indeed relative to zero. Compute for yourself, please, what distance that capsule will in theory traverse during that space of time at the end of only one third of one of your years.\"\n\nSeaton strode across the room and uncovered a machine that resembled somewhat a small, unpretentious desk calculator. He picked up a helmet and thought into it briefly; then stared appalled at the figure that appeared on a tape.\n\n\"My--aunt's--cat's--kitten's--pants--buttons,\" he said, slowly. \"It'd've been smarter, maybe, to've put 'em in orbit around a planetless sun.... And I don't suppose there's a Chinaman's chance of catching 'em again that same way.\"\n\n\"No. Those minds are competent,\" agreed the Norlaminian. \"Only one point is clear. You must again activate the Skylark of Valeron and again wear its sixth-order controller, since we know of no other entity who either can wear it or should. We eight are here to confer and, on the basis of the few data now available, to plan.\"\n\nSeaton scowled in concentration for two long minutes.\n\nIt was a measure of the strain that had been working on him that it took that long. As he had said, he was no God, and didn't want to be. He had not gone looking for either conquest or glory. One thing at a time... but that \"one thing\" had successively led him across a galaxy, into another dimension, through many a hard and desperate fight against some of the most keen-honed killers of a universe.\n\nHis gray eyes hardened. Of all those killers, it was Blackie DuQuesne who posed the greatest threat--to civilization, to Seaton himself, and above all to his wife, Dorothy. DuQuesne at large was deadly.\n\n\"All right,\" he snapped at last. \"If that's all that's in the wood, I suppose that's the way it'll have to be carved.\"\n\nThe Norlaminian merely nodded. He, at least, had had no doubts of how Seaton would react to the challenge. Typically, once Seaton had decided speed became of the essence. \"We'll start moving now,\" he barked. \"The parameters give us up to a year--maybe--but from this minute we act as though DuQuesne and the Intellectuals are back in circulation right now. So if one of you--Rovol?--will put beams on Mart and Peg and project them over here, we'll get right at it.\"\n\nAnd Dorothy, her face turning so white that a line of freckles stood boldly out across the bridge of her nose, picked the baby up and clasped him fiercely, protectively to her breast.\n\nM. Reynolds (\"Martin\" or \"Mart\") Crane was tall, slender, imperturbable; his black-haired, ivory-skinned wife Margaret was tall and whistle stacked--she and Dorothy were just about of a size and a shape. In a second or two their full working projections appeared, standing in the middle of the room facing the Seatons--projections so exactly true to life and so solid-seeming as to give no indication whatever that they were not composed of fabric and of flesh and bone and blood.\n\nSeaton stood up and half-bowed to Margaret, but wasted no time in getting down to business. \"Hi, Peg--Mart. He briefed you?\"\n\n\"Up to the moment, yes,\" Crane replied.\n\n\"You know, then, that some time in the indeterminate but not too distant future all hell is going to be out for noon. Any way I scan it, it looks to me as though, more or less shortly, we're going to be spurlos versenkt--sunk without a trace.\"\n\n\"You err, youth.\" Drasnik, the First of Psychology of Norlamin, spoke quite sharply, for him. \"Your thinking is loose, turbid, confused; inexcusably superficial; completely...\"\n\n\"But you know what their top man said!\" Seaton snapped. \"The one they called 'One'--and he wasn't kidding, either, believe me!\"\n\n\"I do, youth. I know more than that, since they visited us long since. They were not exactly 'kidding' you, perhaps, but your several various interpretations of One's actual words and actions were inconsistent with any and every aspect of the truth. Those words and actions were in all probability designed to elicit such responses and reactions as would enable him to analyze and classify your race. Having done so, the probability approaches unity that you will not again encounter him or any of his group.\"\n\n\"My--God!\" Dorothy, drawing a tremendously deep breath, put Dick the Small back down on the rug and left him to his own devices. \"That makes sense... I was scared simply witless.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Seaton admitted, \"as far as One and the rest of his original gang are concerned. But there's still DuQuesne. And if Blackie DuQuesne, even as an immaterial pattern of pure sixth-order force, thinks that way about me I'm a Digger Indian.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; DuQuesne. One question, please, to clarify my thinking. Can you, do you think, even with the fullest use of all the resources of your Skylark of Valeron, release the intact mind from any body?\"\n\n\"Of course I... oh, I see what you mean. Just a minute; I think probably I can find out from here.\" He went over to his calculator-like instrument, put on a helmet, and stood motionless for a couple of minutes while the great brain of the machine made its computation. Then, wearing a sheepish grin:\n\n\"A flat bust. I not only couldn't, I didn't,\" he reported, cheerfully. \"So One not only did the business, but he was good enough to make me know that I was doing it. What an operator!\" He sobered, thought intensely, then went on, \"So they sucked us in. Played with us.\"\n\n\"You are now beginning to think clearly, youth,\" Drasnik said. \"We come now, then, to lesser probabilities. DuQuesne's mind, of itself, is a mind of power.\"\n\n\"You can broadcast that to the all-attentive universe,\" Seaton said. \"Question: how much stuff has he got now? We know he's got the fifth order down solid. Incarnate, he didn't know any more than that. However, mind is a pattern of sixth-order force. Knowing what we went through to get the sixth, and that we haven't got it all yet by seven thousand rows of Christmas trees, the first sub-question asks itself: Can a free mind analyze itself completely enough to work out and to handle the entire order of force in which it lies?\n\n\"We may assume, I think, that One could have given DuQuesne full knowledge of the sixth if he felt like it. The second sub-question, then, is; did he? If those questions aren't enough to start with I can think of plenty more.\"\n\n\"They are enough, youth,\" Fodan said. \"You have pointed out the crux. We will now discuss the matter. Since this first phase lies largely in your province, Drasnik, you will now take over.\"\n\nThe discussion mounted, and grew, and went on and on. Silently Dorothy slipped away, and the projection of force that was Margaret Crane followed her into the kitchen.\n\nThere was no need for Dorothy to prepare coffee and sandwiches for her husband, not by hand; one thought into a controller would have produced any desired amount of any desired comestibles. But she wanted something to do. Both girls knew from experience that a conference of this sort might go on for hours; and Dorothy knew that with food placed before him, Seaton would eat; without it, he would never notice the lack.\n\nShe did not, of course, prepare anything for the others.\n\nThey were not there. Their bodies were at varying distances--a few miles for Crane and his wife, an unthinkable number of parsecs for the Norlaminians and Sacner Carfon. The distance between Earth and the Green System was so unthinkably vast that there was no point in trying to express it in numbers of miles, or even parsecs. The central green sun of the cluster that held Norlamin, Osnome and Dasor was visible from Earth, all right--in Earth's hugest optical telescopes, as a tiny, 20th-magnitude point--but the light that reached Earth had been on its way for tens of thousand of years before Seaton's ancestors had turned from hunting to agriculture, had taken off their crude skins and begun to build houses, cities, machines and, ultimately, spaceships.\n\nTo all of this Dorothy and Peggy Crane were no strangers; they had been themselves in such projections countless times. If they were more than usually silent, it was not because of the astonishing quality of the meeting that was taking place in the Seatons' living room, but because of the subject of that meeting. Both Dorothy and Peg knew Marc DuQuesne well. Both of them had experienced his cold, impersonal deadliness.\n\nNeither wanted to come close to it again.\n\nBack in the living room, Seaton was saying: \"If One gave DuQuesne all of the sixth-order force patterns, he can be anywhere and can do practically anything. So he probably didn't. On the other hand if One didn't give him any of it DuQuesne couldn't get back here in forty lifetimes. So he probably gave him some of it. The drive and the projector, at least. Maybe as much as we have, to equalize us. Maybe One figured he owed the ape that much. Whatever the truth may be, we've got to assume that DuQuesne knows as much as we do about sixth-order forces.\" He paused, then corrected himself. \"If we're smart we'll assume that he knows more than we do. So we'll have to find somebody else who knows more than we do to learn from. Question--how do we go about doing that? Not by just wandering around the galaxy at random, looking; that's one certain damn sure thing.\"\n\n\"It is indeed,\" the moderator agreed. \"Sacner Carfon, you have, I think, a contribution to make at this point?\"\n\n\"I have?\" The Dasorian was surprised at first, but caught on quickly. \"Oh--perhaps I have, at that. By using Seaton's power and that of the Brain on the Fodan-Carfon band of the sixth, it will undoubtedly be possible to broadcast a thought that would affect selected mentalities wherever situate in any galaxy of this universe.\"\n\n\"But listen!\" protested Seaton. \"We don't want to advertise how dumb we are all over space!\"\n\n\"Of course not. The thought would be very carefully built and highly selective. It would tell who we are, what we have done, and what we intend and hope to do. It would state our abilities and--by inference, and only to those we seek--our lacks; and would invite all qualified persons and entities to get in touch with us.\"\n\nSeaton looked abstracted for a moment. He was thinking. The notion of sending out a beacon of thought was probably a good one--had to be a good one--after all, the Norlaminians and Sacner Carfon knew what they were doing. Yet he could see complications. The Fodan-Carfon band of the sixth order was still very new and very experimental. \"Can you make it selective?\" he demanded. \"I don't mind telling our prospective friends we need help--I don't want to holler it to our enemies.\"\n\nThe Dasorian's deep voice chuckled. \"It can not be made selective,\" he said. \"The message would of necessity be on such a carrier as to be receivable by any intelligent brain. Yet it can be hedged about with such safeguards, limitations and compulsions that no one could or would pay attention to it except those who possess at least some ability, overt or latent, to handle the Fodan-Carfon band.\"\n\nSeaton whistled through his teeth. \"Wow! And just how are you going to clamp on such controls as those? I don't see how anything but magic--sheer, unadulterated, pure black magic!--could swing that load.\"\n\n\"Precisely. Or, rather, imprecisely. It is unfortunate that your term 'magic' is so inexcusably loose and carries so many and so deplorable connotations and implications. Shall we design and build the thought we wish to send out?\"\n\nThe thought was designed and was built; and was launched into space with the inconceivable, the utterly immeasurable velocity of its order of being.\n\nA red-haired stripper called Madlyn Mannis, strutting her stuff in Tampa in Peninsula Florida, felt it and almost got it; but, not being very strongly psychic, shrugged it off and went on about the business of removing the last sequin-bedecked trifle of her costume. And, as close to the dancer as plenteous baksheesh could arrange for, a husky, good-looking young petrochemical engineer named Charles K. van der Gleiss felt a thrill like nothing he had ever felt before--but ascribed it, naturally enough, to the fact that this was the first time he had ever seen Madlyn Mannis dance. And in Washington, D.C. one Doctor Stephanie de Marigny, a nuclear physicist, pricked up her ears, tightened the muscles of her scalp, and tried for two full minutes to think of something she ought to think of but couldn't.\n\nOut past the Green System the message sped, and past the dust and the incandescent gas that had once been the noisome planet of the Fenachrone. Past worlds where amphibians roared and bellowed; past planets of methane ice where crystalline life brooded sluggishly on its destiny.\n\nIn the same infinitesimal instant it reached and passed the Rim Worlds of our galaxy; touching many minds but really affecting none. Farther and farther out, with no decrease whatever in speed, it flew; past the inconceivably tiny, inconceivably fast-moving point that housed the seven greatest, most fearsome minds that the Macrocosmic All had ever spawned--minds that, knowing all about that thought already, ignored it completely.\n\nImmensely farther out, it flashed through the galaxy in which was the solar system of Ray-See-Nee--where, for the first time, it made solid contact with a mind in a body human to the limit of classification. Kay-Lee Barlo, confidential secretary of Department Head Bay-Lay Boyn, stiffened so suddenly that she stuttered into her microphone and had to erase three words from a tape--and in that same instant her mother at home went into deep trance.\n\nAnd still farther out, in a galaxy lying almost on the universe's Arbitrary Rim, in the Realm of the Llurdi, the message found a much larger group of receivers. While none of the practically enslaved Jelmi could do much of anything about that weirdly peculiar and inexplicably guarded thought, many of them were very much interested in it; particularly Valkyrie-like Sennlloy, a native of the planet Allondax and the master biologist of all known space; ancient Tammon, the greatest genius of the entire Jelman race; and newlyweds Mergon and Luloy, the Mallidaxian savants.\n\nNone of the monstrous Llurdi--not even their most monstrous \"director\", Klazmon the Fifteenth--being monstrous--could receive the message in any part. And how well that was! For if those tremendously able aliens could have received that message, could have understood it and acted upon it, how vastly different the history of all humanity would have been!\n\nChapter 2. Llurdi and Jelmi\n\nThe distance from Earth to the Realm of the Llurdi is such that it is worth while to take a moment to locate it in space.\n\nIt has been known for a long time that solar systems occur in lenticular aggregations galled galaxies; each galaxy consisting of one or more thousands of millions of solar systems. And for almost as long a time, since no definite or systematic arrangement of the galaxies could be demonstrated, the terms \"Universe\" and \"Cosmic All\" were interchangeable; each meaning the absolute totality of all matter and all space in existence anywhere and everywhere.\n\nThere had been speculations, of course, that galaxies were arranged in lenticular universes incomprehensibly vast in size, so that the term \"Cosmic All\" should be reserved for a plurality of universes and a hyper-space of more than three spatial dimensions.\n\nSeaton and Crane in the Skylark of Valeron proved that our galaxy, the Milky Way, lies in a lenticular universe by charting every galaxy in that universe. And they suggested to the various learned societies that the two celestial aggregates should be named, respectively, the First Galaxy and the First Universe.\n\nMany millions of parsecs distant from Tellus and its First Galaxy, then, out near the Arbitrary Rim of the First Universe, there lay the Realm of the Llurdi. This Realm, which had existed for over seventy thousand Tellurian years, was made up of four hundred eighty-two planets in exactly half that many solar systems.\n\nTwo planets in each populated system were necessary because the population of the Realm was composed of two entirely different forms of highly intelligent life. Of these two races the Jelmi--the subject race, living practically in vassalage--were strictly human beings and lived on strictly Tellus-type worlds.\n\nThe master race, the Llurdi, had originated upon the harsh and hostile planet Llurdiax--Llurdiaxorb Five--with its distant, wan, almost-never-seen sun and its incessant gales of frigid, ice-laden, ammonia- and methane-impregnated, forty-pounds-to-the-square-inch air. Like mankind, they wore clothing against the rigors of their environment. Unlike mankind, however, they wore clothes only for protection, and only when protection was actually necessary. Nor was Llurdiax harsh or forbidding--to them.\n\nIt was the best of all possible worlds. They would not colonize any planet that was not as nearly as possible like the mother world of their race.\n\nLlurdi, although they are erect, bifurcate, bi-laterally symmetrical, bi-sexual, mammalian, and have a large crania and six-digited hands each having two opposed thumbs, are not humanoids. Nor, despite their tremendous, insensitive, unfreezable wings, are they either birds or bats. Nor flying cats, although they have huge, vertically-slitted eyes and needle-sharp canine teeth that protrude well below and above their upper and lower lips. Also, they have immensely strong and highly versatile tails; but there is nothing simian about them or in their ancestry.\n\nThe Realm was not exactly an empire. Nor was Llanzlan Klazmon the Fifteenth exactly an emperor. The title \"Llanzlan\" translates, as nearly as possible, into \"Director\"; and that was what Klazmon regarded himself as being.\n\nIt is true that what he said, went; and that if he didn't like any existing law he expunged it from all existence. But that was exactly the way things should be. How else could optimum conditions be achieved and maintained in an ever-expanding, ever-changing, ever-rising economy? He ruled, he said and thoroughly believed, with complete reason and perfect fairness and strictly in accordance with the findings of the universe's largest and most competent computers as to what was for the best good of all.\n\nWherefore everyone who did not agree with him was--automatically, obviously, and unquestionably--wrong.\n\nLlurdias, the capital city of the world Llurdiax and of the Realm, had a population of just over ten million and covered more than nine hundred square miles of ground. At its geometrical center towered the mile-square, half-mile-high office-residence-palace (the Llurdian word \"llanzlanate\" has no Tellurian equivalent) of Llanzlan Klazmon the Fifteenth of the Realm of the Llurdi. And in that building's fifth sub-basement, in Hall Prime of Computation, Klazmon and his Board of Advisors were hard at work.\n\nThat vast room, the first receptor of all the reports of the Realm, was three-quarters full of receivers, recorders, analyzers--bewilderingly complex instrumentation of all kinds. From most of these devices tapes were issuing--tapes that, en route to semi-permanent storage, were being monitored by specialists in the hundreds of different fields of the Llurdan-Jelmi economy.\n\nKlazmon the Fifteenth and his Board, seated at a long conference table in hard-upholstered \"chairs\" shaped to fit the Llurdan anatomy, were paying no attention to routine affairs.\n\n\"I have called this meeting,\" the ruler said, \"to decide what can be done to alleviate an intolerable situation. As you all know, we live in what could be called symbiosis with the Jelmi; who are so unstable, so illogical, so bird-brained generally that they would destroy themselves in a century were it not for our gentle but firm insistence that they conduct themselves in all matters for their own best good. This very instability of their illogical minds, however, enables them to arrive occasionally at valid conclusions from insufficient data; a thing that no logical mind can do. These conclusions--they are intuitions, really--account for practically all the advancement we Llurdi have made and explain why we have put up with the Jelmi--yes, cherished them--so long.\"\n\nHe paused, contemplating the justice of the arrangement he had just described. It did not occur to him that it could in any way be described as \"wrong.\"\n\nHe went on: \"What most of you do not know is that intuitions of any large worth have become less and less frequent, decade by decade, over the last few centuries. It was twelve years ago that the Jelm Jarxon elucidated the 'Jarxon' band of the sixth order, and no worth-while intuition has been achieved since that time. Beeloy, has your more rigorous analysis revealed any new fact of interest?\"\n\nA young female stood up, preened the short fur back of her left ear with the tip of her tail, and said, \"No, sir. Logic can not be applied to illogic. Statistical analysis is still the only possible tool and it cannot be made to apply to the point in question, since it is incapable of certainty and since the genius-type mind occurs in only one out of thousands of millions of Jelmi. I found a very high probability, however--point nine nine nine plus--that the techniques set up by our ancestors are wrong. In breeding for contentment by destroying the discontented we are very probably breeding out the very characteristics we wish to encourage.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Beeloy. That finding was not unanticipated. Kalton, your report on Project University, please.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" An old male, so old that his fur was almost white, stood up. \"Four hundred males and the same number of females, the most intelligent and most capable Jelmi alive, were selected and were brought here to the Llanzlanate. They were put into quarters that were Jelm-type in every respect, even to gravity. They were given every inducement and every facility to work-study and to breed.\n\n\"First, as to work-study. They have done practically nothing except waste time. They seem to devote their every effort to what they call 'escape' by means of already-well-known constructions of the fifth and sixth orders--all of which are of course promptly negated. See for yourselves what these insanely illogical malcontents are doing and know for yourselves that, in its present form, Project University is a failure as far as producing intuitions is concerned.\"\n\nKalton picked up a fist-sized instrument between the thumbs of his left hand and a tri-di \"tank\" appeared on the table's top, in plain sight of every member of the Board. Then, as he began to finger controls, a three-dimensional scene in true color appeared in the tank; a smoothly-flowing, ever-shifting scene that moved from room to room and from place to place as the point of view traversed the vast volume of the prison.\n\nIt did not look like a prison. The apartments, of which there were as many as the Jelmi wanted, were furnished as luxuriously as the various occupants desired; with furniture and equipment every item of which had been selected by each occupant himself or herself. There were wonderful rugs and hangings; masterpieces of painting and of sculpture; triumphs of design in fireplaces and tables and chairs and couches. Each room or suite could be set up for individual control of gravity, temperature, pressure, and humidity. Any imaginable item of food or drink was available on fifteen seconds' notice at any hour of the day or night.\n\nIn the magnificent laboratories every known or conceivable piece of apparatus could be had for the asking; the memory banks of the library would furnish in seconds any item of information that had been stored in any one of them during all seventy thousand years of the Realm's existence.\n\nAnd there were fully-equipped game and exercise rooms, ranging in size from tiny card-rooms up to a full-sized football field, to suit every Jelman need or desire for play or for exercise.\n\nBut not one of the hundreds of Jelmi observed--each one a perfect specimen physically, as was plainly revealed by the complete absence of clothing--appreciated any one of these advantages! Most of the laboratories were vacant and dark. The few scientists who were apparently at work were not doing anything that made sense. The library was not in use at all; the Jelmi who were reading anything were reading works of purely Jelman authorship--mostly love stories, murder mysteries, and science fiction. Many Jelmi seemed to be busy but their activities were as pointless as cutting out paper dolls.\n\n\"The pale, frail, practically hairless, repulsive, incomplete, illogical, and insane animals refuse steadfastly to cooperate with us on any level.\"\n\nAny Earthman so frustrated would have snarled the sentence, but the Llurd merely stated it as a fact. \"You can all see for yourselves that as far as productive work is... but hold!\"\n\nThe viewpoint stopped moving and focussed sharply on a young man and a young woman who, bending over a table, were working on two lengths of smooth yellow material that looked something like varnished cambric. \"Mergon and Luloy of planet Mallidax,\" Kalton said into the microphone. \"What are you doing? Why are you so far away from your own laboratories?\"\n\nMergon straightened up and glared at what he thought was the point of origin of the voice. \"If it's any of your business, funnyface, which it isn't,\" he said savagely, \"I'm building a shortlong whatsit, and Luloy has nothing to do with it. When I get it done I'm personally going to tear your left leg off and beat you to death with the bloody end of it.\"\n\n\"You see?\" Kalton dispassionately addressed the other members of the Board. \"That reaction is typical.\"\n\nHe manipulated controls and both Jelmi leaped to their feet, with all four hands pressed to their buttocks. The fact that Luloy was a woman--scarcely more than a girl, in fact--was of no consequence at all to Kalton. Even Llurdan sex meant very little to the Llurdi. Jelman sex meant nothing whatever.\n\n\"Nerve-whip,\" Kalton explained to his fellows. He dropped his controller into his lap and the tri-di tank vanished. \"Nothing serious--only slightly painful and producing only a little ecchymosis and extravasation. Neither of those two beasts, however, will be at all comfortable until they get back where they belong. Now, to continue my report:\n\n\"So much for failure to work-study. Failure-refusal to breed, while not possible of such simple and easy demonstration, is no less actual, effective, and determined. A purely emotional, non-logical, and ridiculous factor they call 'love' seems to be involved, as does their incomprehensibly exaggerated, inexplicable craving for 'liberty' or 'freedom'.\"\n\nThe Llanzlan said thoughtfully, \"But surely, unwillingness to breed cannot possibly affect the results of artificial insemination?\"\n\n\"It seems to, sir. Definitely. There is some non-physical and non-logical, but nevertheless powerful, operator involved. My assistants and I have not been able to develop any techniques that result in any except the most ephemeral pregnancies.\"\n\n\"You apparently wish to comment, Velloy?\" Klazmon asked.\n\n\"I certainly do!\" a middle-aged female snapped, giving one tautly-outstretched wing a resounding whack with her tail. \"Of course they haven't! As Prime Sociologist I said five years ago and I repeat now that no mind of the quality of those of the Jelmi here in the llanzlanate can be coerced by any such gross physical means. Kalton talks of them and thinks of them as animals--meaning lower animals. I said five years ago and still say that they are not. Their minds, while unstable and completely illogical and in many instances unsane to the point of insanity, are nevertheless minds of tremendous power. I told this Board five years ago that the only way to make that project work--to cause selected Jelmi to produce either ideas or young or both--was to give the selectees a perfect illusion of complete freedom, and I recommended that course of action. Since I could not prove my statement mathematically, my recommendation was rejected. While I still cannot prove that statement, it is still my considered opinion that it is true; and I now repeat both statement and recommendation. I will keep on repeating them at every opportunity as long as this Board wastes time by not accepting them. I remind you that you have already wasted--lost--over five years.\"\n\n\"Your statement becomes more probable year by year,\" the Llanzlan admitted. \"Kalton, have you anything more to say?\"\n\n\"Very little. Only that, since Project University has admittedly failed, we should of course adopt--\"\n\nKalton was silenced in mid-sentence by a terrific explosion, which was followed by a rumbling crash as half of one wall of the Hall collapsed inward.\n\nA volume of Jelman air rushed in, enveloping a purposeful company of Jelmi in yellow coveralls and wearing gas-masks. Some of these invaders were shooting pistols; some were using or throwing knives; but all were covering and protecting eight Jelmi who were launching bombs at one great installation of sixth-order gear--the computer complex that was the very nerve center of the entire Realm.\n\nFor the Jelmi--who, as has been said, were human to the last decimal of classification--had been working on fifth- and sixth-order devices purely as a blind; their real effort had been on first-order effects so old that their use had been all but forgotten.\n\nThe Jelman plan was simple: Thirty men and thirty women would destroy the central complex of the computer system of the entire Realm. Then, if possible, the survivors of the sixty would join their fellows in taking over an already-selected Llurdan scout cruiser and taking off at max.\n\nIt was quite probable that many or even most of the attacking sixty would die. It was distinctly possible that they all would. All sixty, however, were perfectly willing to trade their lives for that particular bank of sixth-order apparatus, in order that seven hundred forty other Jelmi could escape from Llurdiax and, before control could be re-established, be beyond their masters' reach.\n\nTheoretically, the first phase of the operation should have been successful; the Realm's nerve center should have been blown to unrecognizable bits. The Jelmi knew exactly what they were going to do, exactly how they were going to do it, and exactly how long it would take. They knew that they would have the advantage of complete surprise. There would be, they were sure, half a second or so of the paralysis of shock, followed by at least one second of utter confusion; which would give them plenty of time.\n\nThey were sure it would be as though, during a full-formal session of the Supreme Court, a gang of hoodlums should blast down a wall and come leaping into the courtroom with Tommy-guns ablaze and with long knives flying and stabbing and slashing. Grave, stately, and thoughtful, the justices could not possibly react fast enough to save their lives or their records or whatever else it was that the gangsters were after.\n\nThe Jelmi, however, had never seen any Llurd in emergency action; did not know or suspect how nearly instantaneous the Llurdan speed of reaction was; did not realize that a perfectly logical mind can not be surprised by any happening, however unusual or however outrageous.\n\nThus:\n\nYelling, shooting, throwing, stabbing, slashing, the men and women of the Jelmi rushed into battle; to be met--with no paralysis and no confusion and no loss of time whatever--by buffeting wings, flailing tails, tearing teeth, and hard, highly skilled hands and fists and feet.\n\nMany machine operators, as agile in the air as bats, met the bombs in midair and hurled them out into and along the corridor through the already-breached wall, where they exploded harmlessly. Harmlessly, that is, except for a considerable increase in the relatively unimportant structural damage already wrought.\n\nTwo knives were buried to their hilts in the huge flying muscles of the Llanzlan's chest. His left wing hung useless, its bones shattered by bullets. So did his right arm. Nevertheless, he made it at speed to his console--and the battle was over.\n\nBeams of force lashed out, immobilizing the human beings where they stood. Curtains of force closed in, pressing the Jelmi together into a tightly packed group. An impermeable membrane of force confined all the Jelman air and whatever Llurdan atmosphere had been mixed with it.\n\nThe Llanzlan, after glancing at his own wounds and at the corps of surgeons already ministering to his more seriously wounded fellows, resumed his place at the conference table.\n\nHe said, \"This meeting will resume. The places of those department heads who died will be taken by their first assistants. All department heads are hereby directed to listen, to note, and to act. Since Project University has failed, it is to be closed out immediately. All Jelmi--I perceive that none of those present is dead, or even seriously wounded--will be put aboard the ship in which they intended to leave Llurdiax. They will be given all the supplies, apparatus, and equipment that they care to requisition and will be allowed to take off for any destination they please.\"\n\nHe glanced at the captured Jelmi, imprisoned in their force-bubble of atmosphere. To them it reeked of methane and halogens, but they stood proudly and coldly listening to what he said.\n\nHe dismissed them from his mind and said. \"A recess will now be taken so that those of us who are wounded may have our wounds dressed. After that we will consider in detail means of inducing the Jelmi to resume the production of breakthroughs in science.\"\n\nChapter 3. Free (?)\n\nSome hours later, far out in deep space, the ex-Llurdan scout cruiser--now named the Mallidax, after the most populous Jelman planet of the Realm--bored savagely through the ether. Its crew of late revolutionaries, still dazed by the fact that they were still alive, recuperated in their various ways.\n\nIn one of the larger, more luxurious cabins Luloy of Mallidax lay prone on a three-quarter-size-bed, sobbing convulsively, uncontrollably. Her left eye was swollen shut. The left side of her face and most of her naked body bore livid black and blue bruises--bruises so brutally severe that the marks of Kalton's sense-whip punishment, incurred earlier for insubordination, were almost invisible. A dozen bandages showed white against the bronzed skin of her neck and shoulders and torso and arms and legs.\n\n\"Oh, snap out of it, Lu, please!\" Mergon ordered, almost brusquely. He was a burly youth with crew-cut straw-colored hair; and he, too, showed plenty of evidence of having been to the wars. He had even more bruises and bandages than she did. \"Don't claim that you wanted to be a martyr any more than I did. And they can engrave it on a platinum plaque that I'm damned glad to get out of that fracas alive.\"\n\nStopping her crying by main strength, the girl hauled herself up into a half-sitting position and glared at the man out of her one good eye.\n\n\"You... you clod!\" she stormed. \"It isn't that at all! And you know it as well as I do. It's just that we... they... he... not a single one of them so much as... why, we might just as well have been merely that many mosquitoes--midges--worse, exactly that many perfectly innocuous saprophytic bacilli.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" he agreed, sourly, and her glare changed to a look almost of surprise. \"That's precisely what we were. It's humiliating, yes. It's devastating and it's frustrating. We tried to hit the Llurdi where it hurt, and they ignored us. Agreed. I don't like it a bit better than you do; but caterwauling and being sorry for yourself isn't going to help matters a--\"\n\n\"Caterwauling! Being sorry for myself! If that's what you think, you can...\"\n\n\"Stop it, Lu!\" he broke in sharply, \"before I have to spank your fanny to a rosy blister!\"\n\nShe threw up her head in defiance; then what was almost a smile began to quirk at the corners of her battered mouth. \"You can't, Merg,\" she said, much more quietly than she had said anything so far. \"Look--it's all red, green, blue, yellow, and black already. That last panel I bounced off of was no pillow, friend.\"\n\n\"Llenderllon's favor, sweetheart!\" Bending over, he kissed her gingerly, then drew a deep breath of relief. \"You scared me like I don't know when I've been scared before,\" he admitted. \"We need you too much--and I love you too much--to have you go off the deep end now. Especially now, when for the first time in our lives we're in position to do something.\"\n\n\"Such as what?\" Luloy's tone was more lifeless than skeptical. \"How many of our whole race are worth saving, do you think? How many Jelmi of all our worlds can be made to believe that their present way of life is anything short of perfection?\"\n\n\"Very few, probably,\" Mergon conceded. \"As of now. But--\"\n\nHe paused, looking around their surroundings. The spaceship, which had once been one of the Llurdi's best, might have a few surprises for them. It was a matter for debate whether the Llurdi might not have put concealed spy devices in the rooms. On balance, however, Mergon thought not. The Llurdi operated on grander scales than that.\n\nHe said, \"Luloy, listen. We tried to fight our way to freedom by attacking the Llurdi right where it hurts, in center of their power. We lost the battle. But we have what we were fighting for, don't we? Why do you think they let us go, perfectly free?\"\n\nLuloy's eye brightened a little, but not too much. \"That's plain enough. Since they couldn't make us produce either new theories or children in captivity, they're giving us what they say is complete freedom, so that we'll produce both. How stupid do they think we are? How stupid can they get? If we could have wrecked their long eyes, yes, we could have got away clean to a planet in some other galaxy, 'way out of their range; but now? If I know anything at all, it's that they'll hold a tracer beam--so weak as to be practically indetectable, of course--on us forever.\"\n\n\"I think you're right,\" Mergon said, and paused. Luloy looked at him questioningly and he went on, \"I'm sure you are, but I don't think it's us they are aiming at. They're probably taking the long view--betting that, with a life-long illusion of freedom, we'll have children of our own free will.\"\n\nLuloy nodded thoughtfully. \"And we would,\" she said, definitely. \"All of us would. For, after all, if we on this ship all die childless what chance is there that any other Jelmi will try it again for thousands of years? And our children would have a chance, even if we never have another.\"\n\n\"True. But on the other hand, how many generations will it take for things now known to be facts to degenerate into myths? To be discredited completely, in spite of the solidest records we can make as to the truth and the danger?\"\n\nLuloy started to gnaw her lip, but winced sharply and stopped the motion. \"I see what you mean. Inevitable. But you don't seem very downcast about it, so you have an idea. Tell me, quick!\"\n\n\"Yes, but I'm just hatching it; I haven't mentioned it even to Tammon yet, so I don't know whether it will work or not. At present a sixth-order breakthrough can't be hidden from even a very loose surveillance. Right?\"\n\nBy now Luloy's aches and pains were forgotten. Eyes bright, she nodded. \"You're so right. Do you think one can be? Possibly? How?\"\n\n\"By finding a solar system somewhere whose inhabitants know so much more than we do that the emanations of their sixth-order installations continuously or regularly at work will mask those of any full-scale tests we want to make. There must be some such race, somewhere in this universe. The Llurdi charted this universe long ago--they call it U-Prime--and I requisitioned copies of all the tapes. Second: the Llurdi are all strictly logical. Right?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" the girl agreed. \"Strictly. Insanely, almost, you might say.\"\n\n\"So my idea is to do something as illogical as possible. They think we'll head for a new planet of our own; either in this galaxy or one not too far away. So we won't. We'll drive at absolute max for the center of the universe, with the most sensitive feelers we have full-out for very strong sixth-order emanations. En route, we'll use every iota of brain-power aboard this heap in developing some new band of the sixth, being mighty careful to use so little power that the ship's emanations will mask it. Having found the hiding-place we want, we'll tear into developing and building something, not only that the Llurdi haven't got, but a thing that by use of which we can bust Llanzlan Klazmon the Fifteenth loose from his wings and tail--and through which he can't fight back. So, being absolutely--stupidly--logical about everything, what would His Supreme Omnipotence do about it?\"\n\nLuloy thought in silence for a few seconds, then tried unsuccessfully to whistle through battered, swollen lips. \"Oh, boy!\" she exclaimed, delightedly. \"Slug him with a thing like that--demonstrate superiority--and the battle is over. He'll concede us everything we want, full equality, independence, you name it, without a fight--without even an argument!\"\n\nGrinning, Mergon caught her arm and led her out of the room. Throughout the great hulk of the Llurd spaceship the other battered Jelmi veterans were beginning to stir. To each of them, Mergon explained his plan and from each came the same response. \"Oh, boy!\"\n\nThey began at once setting up their work plans.\n\nThe first project was to find--somewhere!--a planet generating sufficient sixth-order forces to screen what they were going to do. In the great vastnesses of the Over-Universe there were many such planets. They could have chosen that which was inhabited by Norlaminian or Dasorian peoples. They could have chosen one of a score which were comparatively nearby. They, in fact, ultimately chose and set course for the third planet of a comparatively small G-type star known to its people as Tellus, or Earth.\n\nThey could have given many reasons why this particular planet had been selected.\n\nNone of these reasons would have included the receipt of the brief pulse of telepathic communication which none of them, any longer, consciously remembered.\n\nAnd back on Llurdiax the Llanzlan followed the progress of the fleeing ship of Jelm rebels with calm perception.\n\nHis great bat wings were already mending, even as the scars of the late assault on his headquarters were already nearly repaired by a host of servo-mechanisms. Deaf to the noise and commotion of the repairs, heedless of the healing wounds which any human would have devoted a month in bed to curing, the Llanzlan once again summoned his department heads and issued his pronouncement:\n\n\"War, being purely destructive, is a product of unsanity. The Jelmi are, however, unsane; many of them are insane. Thus, if allowed to do so, they commit warfare at unpredictable times and for incomprehensible, indefensible, and/or whimsical reasons. Nevertheless, since the techniques we have been employing have been proven ineffective and therefore wrong, they will now be changed. During the tenure of this directive no more Jelmi will be executed or castrated: in fact, a certain amount of unsane thinking will not merely be tolerated but encouraged, even though it lead to the unsanity termed 'war'. It should not, however, be permitted to exceed that quantity of 'war' which would result in the destruction of, let us say, three of their own planets.\n\n\"This course will entail a risk that we, as the 'oppressors' of the Jelmi, will be attacked by them. The magnitude of this risk--the probability of such an attack--cannot be calculated with the data now available. Also, these data are rendered even less meaningful by the complete unpredictability of the actions of the group of Jelmi released from study here.\n\n\"It is therefore directed that all necessary steps be taken particularly in fifth- and sixth-order devices, that no even theoretically possible attack on this planet will succeed.\n\n\"This meeting will now adjourn.\"\n\nIt did; and within fifteen minutes heavy construction began--construction that was to go on at a pace and on a scale and with an intensity of drive theretofore unknown throughout the Realm's long history. Whole worldlets were destroyed, scavenged for their minerals, their ores smelted in giant atomic space-borne foundries and cast and shaped into complex machines of offense and defense. Delicate networks of radiation surrounded every Jelm and Llurd world, ready to detect, trace, report and home on any artifact whatsoever which might approach them. Weapons capable of blasting moons out of orbit slipped into position in great latticework spheres of defensive emplacements.\n\nThe Llurdi were preparing for anything.\n\nLlurdan computations were never wrong. Computers, however, even Llurdan computers, are not really smart--they can't really think. Unlike the human brain, they can not arrive at valid conclusions from insufficient data. In fact, they don't even try to. They stop working and say--in words or by printing or typing or by flashing a light or by ringing a bell--\"DATA INSUFFICIENT\": and then continue to do nothing until they are fed additional information.\n\nThus, while the Llanzlan and his mathematicians and logicians fed enough data into their machines to obtain valid conclusions, there were many facts that no Llurd then knew. And thus those conclusions, while valid, were woefully incomplete; they did not cover all of actuality by far.\n\nFor, in actuality, there had already begun a chain of events that was to render those mighty fortresses precisely as efficacious against one certain type of attack as that many cubic miles of sheerest vacuum.\n\nChapter 4. Llurdi and Fenachrone\n\nThe type of attack which was about to challenge the Llurdi was from a source no civilized human would have believed still existed.\n\nIf Richard Seaton, laboring at Earth's own defenses uncountable parsecs away, had been told of it, he would flatly have declared the story a lie. He ought to know, he would have said. That particular danger to the harmony of the worlds had long since been destroyed... and he was the man who had destroyed it!\n\nWhen the noisome planet of the Fenachrone was destroyed it was taken for granted that Ravindau and his faction of the Party of Postponement of Universal Conquest, who had fled from the planet just before its destruction, were the last surviving members of their monstrous race. When they in turn were destroyed it was assumed that no Fenachrone remained alive.\n\nThat assumption was wrong. There was another faction of the Party of Postponement much larger than Ravindau's, much more secretive, and much better organized.\n\nIts leader, one Sleemet, while an extremely able scientist, had taken lifelong pains that neither his name nor his ability should become known to any except a select few. He was as patriotic as was any other member of his race; he believed as implicitly as did any other that the Fenachrone should and one day would rule not only this one universe, but the entire Cosmic All. However, he believed, and as firmly, that The Day should not be set until the probability of success of the project should begin to approach unity as a limit.\n\nAccording to Sleemet's exceedingly rigorous analysis, the time at which success would become virtually certain would not arrive for at least three hundred Fenachronian years.\n\nFrom the day of Fenor's accession to the throne Sleemet had been grimly certain that this Emperor Fenor--headstrong, basically ignorant, and inordinately prideful even for an absolute monarch of the Fenachrone--would set The Day during his own reign; centuries before its proper time.\n\nTherefore, for over fifty years, Sleemet had been preparing for exactly the eventuality that came about, and:\n\nTherefore, after listening to only a few phrases of the ultimatum given to Emperor Fenor by Sacner Carfon of Dasor, speaking for the Overlord Seaton and his Forces of Universal Peace, Sleemet sent out his signal and:\n\nTherefore, even before Ravindau's forces began to board their single vessel Sleemet's fleet of seventeen superdreadnoughts was out in deep space, blasting at full-emergency fifth-order cosmic-energy drive away from the planet so surely doomed.\n\nSurely doomed? Yes. Knowing vastly more about the sixth order than did any other of his race, he was the only one of his race who knew anything about the Overlord of the Central System; of who and what that Overlord was and of what that Overlord had done. He, Sleemet, did not want any part of Richard Ballinger Seaton. Not then or ever.\n\nCurse Fenor's abysmal stupidity! Since a whole new Fenachrone planet would now have to be developed, the Conquest could not be begun for more than three hundred years!\n\nWhile Sleemet knew much more about the sixth order than Ravindau did, he did not have the sixth-order drive and it took him and his scientists and engineers several months to develop and to perfect it. Thus their fleet was still inside the First Galaxy when they finally changed drives and began really to travel--on a course that, since it was laid out to reach the most distant galaxies of the First Universe, would of necessity lie within two and a quarter hundreds of thousands of light-years of the galaxy in which the Realm of the Llurdi lay.\n\nAs has been intimated, the Llurdi were literal folk. When any llanzlan issued a directive he meant it literally, and it was always as literally carried out.\n\nThus, when Llanzlan Klazmon ordered the construction of an installation of such a nature that \"no even theoretically possible attack on this planet will succeed\" he meant precisely that--and that was precisely what was built. Nor, since the Llurdi had full command of the fourth and fifth orders, and some sixth-order apparatus as well, was the task overlong in the doing.\n\nThe entire one-hundred-six-mile circumference of Llurdias and a wide annulus outside the city proper were filled with tremendous fortresses; each of which was armed and powered against any contingency to which Computer Prime--almost half a cubic mile of miniaturization packed with the accumulated knowledges and happenings of some seventy thousand years--could assign a probability greater than point zero zero zero one.\n\nEach of those fortresses covered five acres of ground; was low and flat. Each was built of super-hard, super-tough, super-refractory synthetic. Each had twenty-seven high-rising, lightning-rodlike spikes of the same material. Fortress-shell and spikes through closely spaced cast-in tubes; and the entire periphery of each fortress, as well as dozens of interior relief-points, went deep into constantly water-soaked, heavily salted ground. Each fortress sprouted scores of antennae--parabolic, box, flat, and straight--and scores of heavily insulated projectors of shapes to be defined only by a professional mathematician of solid geometry.\n\nAnd how the Llurdan detectors could now cover space! The Jelm Mergon, long before his abortive attempt to break jail, had developed a miniaturized monitor station that could detect, amplify, and retransmit on an aimed tight beam any fifth- or sixth-order signal from and to a distance of many kiloparsecs.\n\nHundreds of these \"mergons\" were already out in deep space. Now mergons were being manufactured in lots of a thousand, and in their thousands they were being hurled outward from Llurdiax, to cover--by relays en cascade--not only the Llurdan galaxy and a great deal of intergalactic space, but also a good big chunk of inter-universal space as well.\n\nThe Fenachrone fleet bored on through intergalactic space at its distance-devouring sixth-order pace. Its fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-order detector webs fanned out far--\"far\" in the astronomical sense of the word--ahead of it. They were set to detect, not only the most tenuous cloud of gas, but also any manifestation whatever upon any of the known bands of any of those orders. Similar detectors reached out to an equal distance above and below and to the left of and to the right of the line of flight; so that the entire forward hemisphere was on continuous web of ultra-tenuous but ultra-sensitive detection.\n\nAnd, as that fleet approached a galaxy lying well to \"starboard\"--the term was still in use aboard ship except for matters of record, since the direction of action of artificial gravity, whatever its actual direction, was always \"down\"--two sets of detectors tripped at once.\n\nThe squat and monstrous officer on watch reported this happening instantly, of course, to Sleemet himself; and of course Sleemet himself went instantly into action. He energized his flagship's immense fifth-order projector.\n\nThose detections could have only one meaning. There was at least one solar system in that galaxy peopled by entities advanced enough to work with forces of at least the fifth order. They should be destroyed--that is, he corrected himself warily, unless they were allied with or belonged to that never-to-be-sufficiently-damned Overlord of the Central System of the First Galaxy... But no, at this immense distance the probability of that was vanishingly small.\n\nThey might, however, have weapons of the sixth. The fact that there were no such devices in operation at the moment did not preclude that possibility.\n\nVery unlike the late unlamented Fenor he, First Scientist Sleemet, was not stupidly and arrogantly sure that the Fenachrone were in fact the ablest, most intelligent, and most powerful race of beings in existence. He would investigate, of course. But he would do it cautiously.\n\nThe working projections of the Fenachrone were tight patterns of force mounted on tight beams. Thus, until they began to perform exterior work, they were virtually indetectable except by direct interception and hard-driven specific taps. Sleemet knew this to be a fact; whether the projection was on, above, or below the target planet's surface and even though that planet was so far away that it would take light hundreds of centuries to make the one-way trip.\n\nThe emanations of his vessels' sixth-order cosmic-energy drive, however, were very distinctly something else. They could not be damped out or masked and they could be detected very easily by whoever or whatever it was that was out there... Yes, an exploration would not change matters at all...\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Fenachrone Fleet's emanations had been detected a full two seconds since.\n\nA far-outpost mergon had picked it up and passed it along to a second, which in turn had relayed it inward to its Number Three, which finally had delivered it to Computer Prime on incredibly distant Llurdiax.\n\nThere, in Hall Prime of Computation, a section supervisor had flicked the switch that had transferred the unusual bit of information to his immediate superior, Head Supervisor Klarton--who had at sight of it gone into a tizzy (for a Llurd) of worrying his left ear with the tip of his tail. He stared at the motionless bit of tape as though it were very apt indeed to bite him in the eye.\n\nWhat to do? Should he disturb the llanzlan with this or not?\n\nThis was a nose-twitching borderline case if there ever was one. If he didn't, and it turned out to be something important, he'd get his tail singed--he'd be reduced to section supervisor. But if he did, and it didn't, he'd get exactly the same treatment... However, the thing, whatever it might be, was so terrifically far away...\n\nYes, that was it! The smart thing to do would be to watch it for a few seconds--determine exact distance, direction of flight, velocity, and so forth--before reporting to the Big Boss. That would protect him either way.\n\nWherefore Sleemet had time to launch an analsynth projection along the indicated line.\n\nHe found a solar system containing two highly industrialized planets; one of which was cool, the other cold. One was peopled by those never-to-be-sufficiently-damned human beings; the other by a race of creatures even more monstrous and therefore even less entitled to exist.\n\nHe studied those planets and their inhabitants quickly but thoroughly, and the more he studied them the more derisive and contemptuous he became. They had no warships, no fortresses either above or below ground, no missiles, even! Their every effort and all their energies were devoted to affairs of peace!\n\nTherefore, every detail having been recorded, including the gibberish being broadcast and tight-beamed by various communications satellites, Sleemet pulled in his analsynth and sent out a full working projection.\n\nHe had already located great stores of prepared power-uranium bars and blocks on both planets. Careless of detection now and working at his usual fantastic speed and with his usual perfect control, he built in seconds six tremendous pyramids upon each of the two doomed worlds--pyramids of now one-hundred-percent-convertible superatomic explosive. He assembled twenty-four exceedingly complex, carefully aimed forces and put them on trip. Then, glaring balefully into an almost opaque visiplate, he reached out without looking and rammed a plunger home--and in an instant those two distant planets became two tremendous fireballs of hellishly intolerable, mostly invisible, energies.\n\nAnd almost eight thousand million highly intelligent creatures--eating, sleeping, loving, fighting, reading, thinking, working, playing--died in that utterly cataclysmic rending of two entire worlds.\n\nPractically all of them died not knowing even that they had been hurt. A few--a very few--watch officers in inter-planetary spaceships observed one or the other of those frightful catastrophes in time to have an instant's warning of what was coming; but only three such officers, it became known later, had enough time to throw on their faster-than-light drives and thus outrun the ravening front of annihilation.\n\nCosmically, however, the thing didn't amount to much. Its duration was very short indeed. While a little of each planet's substance was volatilized, practically all of it was scarcely more than melted. When equilibrium was restored they did not shine like little suns. They scarcely glowed.\n\nHands quietly poised, Sleemet again paused in thought.\n\nThe fact that he had murdered almost eight billion people did not bother him at all. In fact, he did not think of the action at all, as murder or as killing or as anything else. If he had, the thought would have been the Fenachrone equivalent of \"pesticide.\" All space comprising the Cosmic All and every planet therein should and would belong to the Master Race; no competing race had any right whatever to live.\n\nShould he, or should he not, explore the lines of those communications beams and destroy the other planets of this group? He should not, he decided. He would have to slow down, perhaps even change course; and it was quite possible that he was still within range of the sixth-order stuff of that self-styled Overlord. Besides, this group of queerly mixed entities would keep. After he had found a really distant Fenatype planet and had developed it, he would come back here and finish this minor chore.\n\nBut very shortly after making this decision Sleemet was given cause to know starkly that he had not investigated this civilization thoroughly enough by far; for his vessel was being assailed by forces of such incredible magnitude that his instantaneously reactive outer screen was already radiating in the high violet!\n\nAnd, before he could do much more than put a hand to his construction panel, that outer screen began to show black spots of failure!\n\nIn Hall of Prime Computation, on Llurdiax, one entire panel of instrumentation went suddenly dead. The supervisor of that section flicked two testing switches, then scanned the last couple of inches of each of two tapes. Then he paused, for a moment stunned: knocked completely out of any Llurd's calm poise. Then, licking his lips, he spoke; apparently to empty air:\n\n\"Llanzlan Klazmon, sir, Blaydaxorb Three and Blaydaxorb Five stopped reporting, simultaneously, eleven seconds ago. Orbiting pyrometers of both planets reported thermonuclear temperatures at the end-points of their respective transmissions. End of report, sir.\"\n\nThe supervisor did not elaborate.\n\nWhile he was appalled and terribly shocked--he had never imagined such disasters possible--it was not his job to comment or to deduce or to theorize. His business--his only business--was to report to a higher echelon the pertinent facts of any and all unusual events or conditions; the height of the echelon to which he reported being directly proportional to the unusualness and/or magnitude of the event or condition.\n\nSince this event was unprecedented and of very great magnitude indeed, his report went straight to the top--thus overtaking and passing the report of Head Supervisor Klarton, which was not yet ready for delivery.\n\nHaving reported the pertinent facts to the proper echelon the section supervisor went calmly, almost unconcernedly, back to his job of supervising his section. He paid no more attention to the incident even when the llanzlan--fully recovered now from his wounds--who had been asleep in his penthouse apartment came into the Hall from the down-flyway. (Everyone rode a force-beam up, but came down on his own wings.)\n\nWhile Klazmon was not hurrying any more than usual, his usual technique was to drop a full half mile with folded wings before beginning to put on his brakes. Hence his tremendous wings and stabilizing surfaces sent blasts of cold, dense air throughout the whole end of the Hall as he slowed down for a high-G landing in his seat at his master-control console. Fingers, thumbs, and tail-tip flashed over the banked and tiered keyboards of that console; and, all around the periphery of Llurdias, that miles-wide girdle of mighty fortresses came instantly to life.\n\nA multi-layered umbrella of full-coverage screens flashed into being over the whole city and Klazmon, engineering his fifth-order projector, sent his simulacrum of pure force out to see what had happened in or to the solar system of Blaydaxorb.\n\nHe was now, to all intents and purposes, in two places at once.\n\nHe could see, hear, feel, taste, and smell exactly as well with one self as with the other. He was, however, thoroughly accustomed to the peculiar sensations of having a complete personality; he could block out at will any perceptions of either self. And his immaterial self had two tremendous advantages over his material one. It could traverse incredibly immense distances in no measurable time; and, no matter where it went or what it encountered, his physical self would remain entirely unaffected.\n\nIn a mere flick of time, then, Klazmon was in the solar system of Blaydaxorb. The sun itself was unchanged, but in orbits three and five, where the two inhabited planets had been, there were two still-wildly-disturbed masses of liquids and gases.\n\nHe threw out a light, fast detector web, which located the marauding Fenachrone fleet in less than a second. Then, returning most of his attention to his console, he assembled seventeen exceedingly complex forces and hurled them, one at each vessel of the invading fleet.\n\nActually, Klazmon was little if any more affected than was Sleemet the Fenachrone about either that utterly frightful loss of life as such or the loss of those two planets as such. The Realm was big enough so that the total destruction of those two planets--of any two planets except of course Llurdiax itself--was unimportant to the economy of the Realm as a whole. No; what burned the llanzlan up--made it mandatory that that fleet and the entire race whose people manned it should, after thorough study, be wiped completely out--was the brazenness, the uncivilized and illogical savagery, the incredible effrontery of this completely intolerable insult to the realm of the Llurdi and to imperial Klazmon its llanzlan.\n\nKlazmon knew of only one race who made a habit of performing such atrocities; such wanton, illogical, insane offenses against all sense and all reason: those chlorine-breathing, amoeboid monstrosities inhabiting Galaxy DW-427-LU. Those creatures, however, as far as any Llurd had ever learned, had always confined their activities to their own galaxy. If, Klazmon thought grimly to himself, those insanely murderous amoeboids had decided to extend their operations into the Galaxy of the Llurdi, they would find such extension a very expensive one indeed.\n\nWherefore, hunched now over a black-filtered visiplate, with slitted eyes narrow and cat-whiskers stiffly outthrust; with both hands manipulating high-ratio vernier knobs in infinitesimal arcs; Klazmon shoveled on the coal.\n\nChapter 5. Combat!\n\nAs has been said, the Llurdi were a literal folk. Klazmon's directive had specified \"...that no even theoretically possible attack on this planet will succeed.\"\n\nHence that was precisely what had been built. No conceivable force or combination of forces, however applied and even at pointblank range, could crack Llurdiax's utterly impenetrable shields.\n\nNor was that all; for Llurdan engineers, as well as Llurdan philosophers, were thoroughly familiar with the concept that \"The best defense is a powerful offense.\" Wherefore Llurdiax's offensive projectors were designed to smash down any theoretically possible threat originating anywhere within a distance that light would require one and three-quarters millions of Tellurian years to traverse.\n\nUnder the thrustings and the stabbings, the twistings and the tearings, the wrenchings and the bludgeonings of those frightful fields of force, seventeen sets of Fenachrone defensive screens--outer, intermediate, and inner--went successively upward through the visible spectrum, through the ultra-violet, and into the black of failure; baring the individual vessel's last lines of defense, the wall-shields themselves.\n\nThen Klazmon increased the power, gouging and raving at those ultra-stubborn defenses until those defenses were just barely holding; at which point he relaxed a little, read his verniers, leaned back in his bucket seat, and took stock.\n\nThe marauding spaceships were tremendous things; cigar-shaped; flying in hollow-globe formation with one vessel--the flagship, of course--at the exact center; spaced so closely that their screens had overlapped--overlapped in such fashion that unless and until that shell of force was broken no attack could be made upon that central ship.\n\nSo far, so good. With the overwhelming superiority of ultimate-planetary over any at-all-probable mobile installations he, Llanzlan Klazmon the Fifteenth, had smashed that shell completely. He could, he was sure, destroy all those vessels as completely.\n\nBut it would not do at all to destroy even one of them without examining both it and its crew. Klazmon had to know the who and the what and the wherefore and the how and the why. Therefore, leaving all of his attacking beams exactly as they were, Klazmon assembled another gigantic beam--the entire output of one Llurdiaxian fortress--and hurled it against the tail-section of the flagship.\n\nWall-shield and tail-section vanished in a few nanoseconds of time; and not only the tail-section, but also a few hundreds of yards of the flagship's prodigious length as well, became a furiously raging fireball; a sphere of violence incredible.\n\nKlazmon drove his projection forward then, through the now unresisting steel wall and into the control room; where it was met by blasts of force from the hand-weapons of the Fenachrone officers.\n\nThis demonstration, however, lasted for only a second or two. Then those officers, knowing what it was that was standing there so unconcernedly, abandoned their physical assault and attacked the invading projection with the full power of the huge, black, flame-shot wells of hypnotic force that were their eyes. When the mental attack also failed they merely stood there; glaring a hatred that was actually tangible.\n\nKlazmon immobilized each one of the officers individually with pencils of force and began to study them intensively. While much shorter and thicker and wider and immensely stronger than the Jelmi of the Realm, they were definitely Jelmoid in every important respect... yes, the two races had certainly had a common ancestry, and not too far back. Also, their thinking and conduct were precisely as was to be expected of any Jelman or Jelmoid race that had been allowed to develop in its unsane and illogical way for many thousands of years without the many benefits of Llurdan control!\n\nThey would of course have thought-exchange gear; any race of their evident advancement must have... ah, yes; over there.\n\nNow--which of these wights would be the admiral? That one wearing the multiplex scanner would be the pilot; that one facing the banks of dials and gages would be the prime engineer; those six panels had to be battle panels, so those six monsters had to be gunnery officers... ah!\n\nThat one there--off by himself; seated (in spite of the fact that with their short, blocky legs no Fenachrone had any need, ever, to sit) at a desk that was practically a throne; facing no gadgetry and wearing consciously an aura of power and authority--that one would be the one Klazmon wanted.\n\nKlazmon's projection flashed up to the motionlessly straining admiral. The helmets of the \"mechanical educator\" snapped onto the Llurd's quietly studious head and onto the head with the contemptuously sneering face--the head of First Scientist Fleet Admiral Sleemet of the Fenachrone.\n\nThat face, however, lost its sneer instantly, for Sleemet--even more overweeningly and brutally and vaingloriously prideful now than were the lower echelons of his race--had never imagined the possibility of the existence of such a mind as this monstrous invader had.\n\nKlazmon's mind, the product of seventy thousand years of coldly logical evolution, tore ruthlessly into the mind of the Fenachrone. It bored into and twisted at that straining mind's hard-held blocks; it battered and shattered them; it knocked them down flat.\n\nThen Klazmon, omnivorous scholar that he was, set about transferring to his own brain practically everything that the Fenachrone had ever learned. Klazmon learned, as Richard Seaton had learned previously, that all Fenachrone having authority and responsibility were meticulous record-keepers. He learned what had happened to the civilization of the Fenachrone and to its world, and who had done it and how; he learned that each and every captain knew exactly the same and had exactly the same records as did First Scientist Fleet Admiral Sleemet himself; he learned that each vessel, alone by itself, was thoroughly capable of re-creating the entire Fenachrone civilization and culture.\n\nA few of the many other thousands of things that Klazmon learned were: That there were many Jelman and Jelmoid--human and humanoid, that is--races living in what they called the First Galaxy. That all these races were alike in destructiveness, belligerence to the point of war-lust, savagery, implacability, vengefulness, intolerance, and frightfulness generally. Not one of them (by Klazmon's light!) had any redeeming features or qualities whatever. That all these races must be destroyed if any worthwhile civilization were ever to thrive and spread.\n\nThere was no word in any language of the Realm of the Llurdi corresponding even remotely to \"genocide.\" If there had been, Klazmon would have regarded it an etymological curiosity. All those surviving Fenachrone would have to die: no such race as that had any right whatever to live.\n\nBefore being destroyed, however, they would have to be studied with Llurdan thoroughness; and any and all worthwhile ideas and devices and other artifacts should be and would be incorporated into the Llurdan-Jelman way of life.\n\nOne vessel would be enough, however, to preserve temporarily for the purpose of study. In fact, what was left of the flagship would be enough.\n\nThe now-vanished tail-section had contained nothing new to Llurdan science, the encyclopedic records were intact, and the flagship's personnel--males and females, adults and adolescents and children and babies--were alive and well.\n\nWherefore sixteen sets of multiplex projectors doubled their drain of power from Llurdias' mighty defensive girdle, and all the Fenachrone aboard sixteen superdreadnoughts died in situ, wherever they happened to be, as those sixteen vessels became tiny sunlets.\n\nAnd the llanzlan issued orders:\n\n1) The bulk of the Fenachrone flagship was to be brought in to the llanzlanate at full sixth-order drive.\n\n2) A test section of the llanzlanate was to be converted at once to a completely authentic Fenachrone environment.\n\n3) Every possible precaution was to be taken that no Fenachrone suffered any ill effects on the way, during transfer to their new quarters, or while in their new quarters.\n\nDropping the Fenachrone flagship and its personnel from his mind, Klazmon immersed himself in thought.\n\nHe had learned much. There was much more of menace than he had supposed, in many galaxies other than Galaxy DW-427-LU... especially that so-called First Galaxy... and particularly the Green System or Central System of that galaxy? The green-skinned Norlaminians--how of them? And how of that system's overlord, Seaton of Tellus? That one was, very evidently, a Jelm... and, even after making all due allowance for Sleemet's bias, he was of a completely uncontrolled and therefore extremely dangerous type.\n\nAnd as, evidently, his was a mind of exceeding power, he could very well be a very dangerous and quite immediate threat.\n\nThe mergons must be wider-spread even than originally planned and they must be on the lookout for this Overlord Seaton. In fact, he might be worth interviewing personally. It might be well worth while, some of these years, to take some time off and go to that distant galaxy, purposely to make that Jelm Seaton's acquaintance...\n\nShrugging his shoulders and shaking both wings, Klazmon cut off his projection and called another meeting of his Board of Advisors.\n\nHe briefed them on what had happened; then went on:\n\n\"We must protect all our planets in the same way and to the same extent that this planet Llurdiax is protected now: a course of action now necessary because of these many Jelman and Jelmoid races that have been developing for untold millenia in their unsane and illogical ways, with no semblance of or attempt at either guidance or control.\n\n\"Second: any force of any such race that attacks us will be destroyed before it or they can do us any harm.\n\n\"Third: the manufacture and distribution of mergons will continue indefinitely at the present rate.\n\n\"Fourth: No chance or casual vessel or fleet traversing any part of the vast volume of space to be covered by our mergons is to be destroyed, or even hailed, until I myself decide what action, if any, is to be taken.\"\n\nSo saying, the Llanzlan Klazmon dismissed his advisors. His great wings fanned idly as he contemplated what he had done. He was well pleased with it. He had, he reflected, scratching his head contentedly with the tip of his tail, provided for every possible contingency. Whatever this Jelm, or Jelmlike creature, named Seaton might be or do, he would pose no real threat to the llanzlanate.\n\nOf that Klazmon was one hundred per cent sure...\n\nAnd wrong!\n\nChapter 6. Of Disembodied Intelligences\n\nWe have now seen how the ripple of thought that began with the conference between Seaton and his advisors from the Green System had spread throughout all of recorded space, and how it had affected the lives and destinies of countless millions of persons who had never heard of him.\n\nYet a few threads remain to be drawn into our net. And one of these threads represents the strangest entities Seaton had encountered, ever... as well as the most deadly.\n\nTo understand what these entities are like, it is necessary to look back to their beginnings.\n\nThese are most remote, both in space and in time. In a solar system so distant from that of Sol as to be forever unknowable to anyone of Earth, and at a time an inconceivably vast number of millennia in the past, there once existed a lusty and fertile Tellus-type planet named Marghol. Over the usual millions of years mankind evolved on Marghol and thrived as usual. And finally, also as usual and according to the scheduled fate of all created material things, the planet Marghol grew old.\n\nWhether or not a Tellus-type planet ordinarily becomes unfit to support human life before its sun goes nova is not surely known. Nor does it matter very much; for, long before either event occurs, the human race involved has developed a faster-than-light drive and has at its disposal dozens or hundreds of Earth-like planets upon which even subhuman life has not yet developed. The planet Marghol, however, while following the usual pattern in general, developed a specific thing that was, as far as is known, unique throughout all the reaches of total space and throughout all time up to the present.\n\nOn Marghol, during many, many millions of years of its prime, there had continued to exist a small, tightly-inbred, self-perpetuating cult of thinkers--of men and women who devoted their every effort and their total power to thought.\n\nThey themselves did not know what freak of mind or quirk of physical environment made the ultimate outcome possible; but after those many millions of years, during which the perpetually inbreeding group grew stronger and stronger mentally and weaker and weaker physically, the seven survivors of the group succeeded finally in liberating their minds--minds perfectly intact and perfectly functioning--from the gross and perishable flesh of their physical bodies.\n\nThen, able to travel at the immeasurable speed of thought and with all future time in which to work, they set out to learn everything there was to know. They would learn, they declared, not only all about space and time and zero and infinity and animals and people and life and death, but also everything else comprising or having anything to do with the totality of existence that is the Cosmic All.\n\nThis quest for knowledge has been going on, through universe after universe and through dimension after dimension, for a stretch of time that, given as a number in Tellurian years, would be a number utterly incomprehensible to the human mind. For--what perceptible or tangible difference is there, to the human mind, between a googolplex of seconds and the same number of centuries? And, since these free minds ordinarily kept track of time only by the life-cycles of suns, the period of time during which they had already traveled and studied could have been either shorter or longer than either of the two exact figures mentioned.\n\nSeven free minds had left the planet Marghol. They called themselves, in lieu of names, \"One\" to \"Seven\" in order of their liberation.\n\nFor a brief time--a mere cosmic eye-wink; a few hundreds of millions of years--there had been eight, since One had consented to dematerialize one applicant for immortality. The applicant Eight, however, sick and tired of eternal life, had committed suicide by smashing his sixth-order being out of existence against Richard Seaton's sixth-order screens.\n\nNow those seven free minds, accompanied by the free mind of Immortality Candidate Doctor Marc C. DuQuesne, were flying through ultra-deep space in a time-stasis capsule. This capsule, as has been said, was designed and powered to travel almost to infinity in both space and time. But, as the Norlaminians pointed out to Seaton, his basic assumptions were invalid.\n\nNothing happened, however, for week after week. Then, so immensely far out in intergalactic space that even the vast bulk of a galaxy lying there would have been invisible even to Palomar's \"Long Eye,\" the hurtling capsule struck a cloud of hydrogen gas.\n\nThat gas was, by Earthly standards, a hard vacuum; but the capsule's velocity by that time was so immensely great that that cloud might just as well have been a mountain of solid rock. The capsule's directors tried, with all their prodigious might and speed, to avoid the obstruction, but even with fullest power they did not have time enough.\n\nEight multi-ton power-bars of activated uranium flared practically instantaneously into ragingly incandescent gas; into molecular, atomic, and subatomic vapor and debris. A fireball brighter than a sun glared briefly; then nothing whatever was visible where that massive structure had been.\n\nAnd out of that sheer emptiness came a cold, clear thought: the thought of Doctor Marc C. DuQuesne.\n\n\"One, are you familiar enough with this region of space to estimate at all closely how long we were in that stasis of time and where we now are with reference to the First Galaxy?\"\n\nFreemind One did not exactly answer the question. \"What matters it?\" he asked. If the thought of an immortal and already incredibly old and incredibly knowledgeful mind can be said to show surprise, that thought did. \"It should be clear, even to you of infinitesimally short life, that any length of time expressible in any finite number of definite time periods is actually but a moment. Also, the Cosmic All is vast indeed; larger by many orders of magnitude than any that the boldest of your thinkers has as yet dared to imagine.\n\n\"Whether or not space is infinite I do not know. Whether or not my life span will be infinite I do not know. I do not as yet completely understand infinity. I do know, however, that both infinite time and infinite space are requisite for the acquisition of infinite knowledge, which is my goal; wherefore I am well content. You have no valid reason whatever for wishing to return to your Earth. Instead, you should be as eager as I am to explore and to study the as yet unknown.\"\n\n\"I have unfinished business there.\" DuQuesne's thought was icy cold. \"I'm going back there whether you do or not.\"\n\n\"To kill beings who have at best but an instant to live? To rule an ultra-microscopic speck of cosmic dust? A speck whose fleeting existence is of but infinitesimal importance to the Great Scheme of Things? Are you still infantile enough, despite your recent transformation, to regard as valid such indefensible reasons as those?\"\n\n\"They're valid enough to me. And you'd have to go back, too, I should think. Or isn't it still true that science demands the dematerialization of the whole Skylark party?\"\n\n\"Truth is variable,\" One said. \"Thus, while certain of our remarks were not true in the smaller aspect, each of them was designed to elicit a larger truth. They aided in the initiation of chains of events by observation of which I will be able to fit many more constituent parts of this you call the First Universe precisely into place in the Great Scheme.\n\n\"Now as to you, DuQuesne. The probability was small that you were sufficiently advanced to become a worthy member of our group; but I decided to give you your chance and permitted Richard Seaton to do what he did. As a matter of fact I, not Seaton, did it. You have failed; and I now know that no member of your race can ever become a true Scholar. In a very few millions of your years you would not be thinking of knowledge at all, but merely of self-destruction. I erred, one-tenth of a cycle since, in admitting Freemind Eight to our study group; an entity who was then at approximately the same stage of development as you now are. I will not repeat that error. You will be rematerialized and will be allowed to do whatever you please.\"\n\nThe mind of DuQuesne almost gasped.\n\n\"Out here? Even if you re-create my ship I'd never get back!\"\n\n\"You should and will have precisely the same chance as before of living out your normal instant of life in normal fashion. To that end I will construct for you a vessel that will be the replica of your former one except in that it will have a sixth-order drive--what your fellow-human Seaton called the 'Cosmic Energy' drive--so that you will be able to make the journey in comparatively few of your days. I will instruct you in this drive and in certain other matters that will be required to implement what I have said. I will set your vessel's controls upon your home galaxy at the correct acceleration.\n\n\"I compute... I construct.\"\n\nAnd faster by far than even an electronic eye could follow, a pattern of incredibly complex stresses formed in the empty ether.\n\nElemental particles, combining instantaneously, built practically instantaneously upward through electrons and protons and atoms and molecules beams and weaponry up to a million tons or more of perfectly-operating superdreadnought--and at the same time built the vastly more complex structure of the two hundred pounds or so of meat and so forth that were to enclothe Freemind DuQuesne--and did the whole job in much less time than the blink of an eye.\n\n\"...I instruct... It is done,\" and all seven freeminds vanished.\n\nAnd DuQuesne, seated at a thoroughly familar control-board and feeling normal gravity on the seat of his pants, stared at that board's instruments, for a moment stunned.\n\nAccording to those instruments the ship was actually travelling at an acceleration of one hundred twenty-seven lights; its internal gravity was actually nine hundred eighty-one point zero six centimeters per second squared.\n\nHe stared around the entire room, examining minutely each familiar object. Activating a visiplate, he scanned the immense skyrover, inside and out, from stem to stern: finding that it was in fact, except for the stated improvements, an exact duplicate of the mighty ship of war he had formerly owned: which, he still thought, had been one of the most powerful battleships ever built by man.\n\nThen, and only then, did he examine the hands resting, quiescent but instantly ready, upon the board's flat, bare table. They were big tanned, powerful hands; with long, strong, tapering, highly competent fingers. They were his hands--his own hands in every particular, clear down to the tiny scar on the side of his left index finger; where, years before, a bit of flying glass from an exploding flask had left its mark.\n\nShaking his head, he got up and went to his private cabin, where he strode up to a full-length mirror.\n\nThe man who stared back at him out of it was tall and powerfully built; with thick, slightly wavy hair of an intense, glossy black. The eyes, only a trifle lighter in shade, were surmounted by heavy black eyebrows growing together above his finely-chiseled aquiline beak of a nose. His saturnine face, while actually tanned, looked almost pale because of the blackness of the heavy beard always showing through, even after the closest possible shave.\n\n\"He could rematerialize me perfectly--and did,\" he said aloud to himself, \"and the whole ship--exactly!\"\n\nScowling in concentration, he went into his bathroom and stepped upon the platform of his weight-and-height Fairbanks. Six feet and seven-eighths of an inch. Precisely right. Two hundred two and three-quarters pounds. Ditto.\n\nHe examined the various items of equipment and of every-day use. There was his cutthroat razor, Osnomian-made of arenak--vastly sharper than any Earthly razor could possibly be honed and so incredibly hard that it could shave generation after generation of men with no loss whatever of edge.\n\nComb, brush, toothbrush, lotion--inside the drawers and out--every item was exactly as he had left it... clear down to the correctly-printed, peculiarly-distorted tubes of tooth-paste and of shaving cream; each of which, when he picked it up, fitted perfectly into the grip of his left hand.\n\n\"I'll... be... totally... damned,\" DuQuesne said then aloud.\n\nChapter 7. DuQuesne and Klazmon\n\nThe Skylark of Valeron swung in orbit around the sun of Earth. She was much more of worldlet than a spaceship, being a perfect sphere over a thousand kilometers in diameter. She had to be big. She had to house, among other things, the one-thousand-kilometers-diameter graduated circles of declination and of right ascension required to chart the thousands of millions of galaxies making up any given universe of the Cosmic All.\n\nShe was for the most part cold and dark. Even the master-control helmets, sprouting masses and mazes of thigh-thick bundles of hair-thin silver wire, hung inactivated in the neutral-gray, featureless master-control room. The giant computer, however--the cubic mile of ultra-miniaturization that everyone called the \"Brain\"--was still in operation; and in the worldlet's miles-wide chart-room, called the \"tank,\" there still glowed the enormous lenticular aggregation of points of light that was the chart of the First Universe--each tiny pool of light representing a galaxy composed of thousands of millions of solar systems.\n\nA precisely coded thought impinged upon a receptor.\n\nA relay clicked, whereupon a neighboring instrument, noting the passage of current through its vitals, went busily but silently to work, and an entire panel of instrumentation came to life.\n\nSwitch after switch snapped home. Field after field of time-stasis collapsed. The planetoid's artificial sun resumed its shining; breezes began again to stir the leaves of trees and of shrubbery; insects resumed their flitting from bloom to once-more-scented bloom. Worms resumed their gnawings and borings beneath the green velvet carpets that were the lawns. Brooks began again to flow; gurglingly.
