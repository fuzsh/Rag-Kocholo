E. Smith or E.E. “Doc” Smith has been behind the publications of a great number of literally works which included two series publication; Skylark, and The Lensman. His works including thesis research that he undertook during his early varsity education as well as his career as a food engineer, has inspired more literally contributions by different authors. Most of his work has been based on the science fiction genre since he had great interest in interstellar travel. The “Father of Space Opera” as he was known, is revered as the godfather of science fiction. It was not until 1928 when Hugo Gernsback appended “PhD” to Smith’s name for his notable contribution to Amazing that he became known as “Doc” Smith. E.E. “Doc” Smith was born on May 2, 1890 to Fred Jay Smith and Caroline Mills Smith in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. He worked as a manual laborer until he suffered a wrist injury at the age of 19 while escaping a fire. He enrolled at the University of Idaho where he went on to receive two degrees in chemical engineering. His death was recorded on August 31, 1985 at the age of 75 at Seaside, Oregon, US.\n\nThrough his works, he has inspired many legendary authors in the science fiction genre. From publication of books, airing of TV shows to most science fiction movies that are on the big screen, science fiction authors can accredit their success to E.E. “Doc” Smith. His most notable series, The Lensman, which has ben referred to as “complex beyond all reason” by Josh Tyler from the CINEMABLEND news website, has still proven to be an epic, sprawling story which follows a group of people travelling beyond space and time to serve as guardians of the universe. Back in 2008 – 2009 there had been speculation of an adaptation of the “Lensman” stories by J. Michael Straczynski; most notably known as the mind behind Babylon 5 (1994), Thor (2011), World War Z (2013) among others for his ground breaking success on television and science fiction. He was said to be writing a script for Ron Howard but as at the writing of this article no adaption for the screen has been made. This however cannot be said to be wholly true. There are many notable adaptations of movies, books and TV shows which have copied and span aspects of E. E. Smith’s works including The Green Lantern which could be said to have a similar concept as that of The Lensman as well as Star Wars where characters from E.E. “Doc” Smith’s books have been referenced just to name a few, it could be argued that the science fiction genre is the indirect adaptation of Smith’s fictional work.\n\nHis first series Skylark, was inspired from discussions he held with a former classmate of his from the University of Idaho, Dr. Carl Garby. A discussion ensued about journeys into outer space where Smith would vividly express his ideas and notions pertaining interstellar possibilities. It would later be suggested that Smith should put his ideas into written form as a story. Although he was interested Smith was not fully receptive of the idea because as he stated, “he believed a certain degree of romantic element would be required and he was uncomfortable with that.” It is important to note that on this important junction of Smith’s writing career, an important decision was about to be made.\n\nMrs. Garby, Carl’s wife, offered to assist Smith by taking care of the romantic dialogue as well as the love interest and smith decided on taking up the challenge. Smith chose to base the main characters, the “Seatons” and the “Cranes” on both his and his friend’s family respectively. About one-third of “The Skylark of Space” had been written by the end of 1916 when Smith and Garby gradually abandoned work on it. In 1919, he resumed work on “The Skylark of Space” which he proceeded to complete in the spring of 1920. He submitted it to many book publishers and magazines where he ended up spending more on postage compared to what he received in publication. Smith had begun work on the “Skylark III” before his first book was submitted and accepted by Amazing Stories magazine initially for $75 and then later raised to $125. The first instalment was such a success that a sequel was requested before the second installment had been published.\n\nIn the early 1930’s he finished writing “Spacehounds of IPC” which he considered one of his finest works as he took great care to avoid scientific impossibilities which had bothered some of the readers of the Skylark series. Fan letters after the publication in the July to September issue of Amazing complained about how the installment was confined to the solar system. Harry Bates, editor of Astounding Stories, offered Smith a 2 cents per word contract which meant Spacehounds would not have a sequel. This was the beginning of the Lensman series.\n\nFrom the first book of The Lensman series Triplanetary (published by Amazing Stories in April 1934, later revised in 1948 by Fantasy Press) to the final publication of Children of the Lens (1953. Originally published in four parts from November 1947 to February 1948, Astounding Stories), Smith was able to write without having to bother with any scientific detail but rather have his imagination run “riot”. Without a doubt, characters inside the story call attention to its mental and logical implausibility, and now and again even appear to present self-spoof. At different times, they are prominently silent about clear implausibility.\n\nE.E. “Doc” Smith’s books are generally thought to be great space operas, and he is occasionally referred to as the first of the three “novas” of twentieth-century sci-fi (with Stanley G. Weinbaum and Robert A. Heinlein as the second and third novas). Heinlein credited him for being his fundamental impact: “I have gained from numerous journalists—from Verne and Wells and Campbell and Sinclair Lewis, among others— however, I have gained more from you than from any of the others and maybe more than for all the others put together . . . .” Smith communicated an inclination for designing fictional technologies that were not entirely impossible (so far as the science of the day was aware) yet exceptionally unlikely: “the more highly improbable an idea is—shy of being as opposed to science whose principal operations include no disregard of infinitesimals—the better I like it” was his expression. Lensman was one of five finalists when the 1966 World Science Fiction Convention judged the Isaac Asimov’s Foundation the Best All-Time Series though he came second the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Smith in 2004.\n\nBook Series In Order » Authors » E.E. “Doc” Smith\n\nOne Response to “E.E. “Doc” Smith”"
