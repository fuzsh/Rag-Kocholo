        "text": "Shipping Terms:\n\nWe realize that the packaging and shipping of your purchase is an important aspect of your order. You have spent time carefully selecting which copy of a book to purchase (Thank you for choosing ours!), often based on its described condition. Bearing this in mind, we carefully package your purchase using:\n\ncardboard boxes or cardboard shipping wraps\n\ncardboard wrap in a Poly Mailer\n\nbubble wrap\n\nfoam wrap\n\nair bags\n\npaper fill\n\nWhile we often re-use shipping materials, we only do so with clean materials that are worthy of the job. We believe in the second \"R\" in \"Reduce, Re-use, Recycle\" when it comes to shipping, but only if it does not compromise your purchase.\n\nChoosing the most appropriate materials suited to your purchase, we package up your parcel, taking the time to do everything we can to ensure its safe and secure delivery to you. Attention is paid to protecting corners and boards of hardcover books and ensuring that paperback books cannot be curled or folded while in transit. To ensure that no moisture damage occurs while in transit, we make sure that a plastic, protective barrier is a part of your package, either by using a Poly Mailer or by plastic bagging/wrapping your book(s) if a cardboard box is to be used for shipping. No loose edges or flaps are left on the outside of packages to ensure smooth flow and safe journey through postal system sorting and scanning equipment. An Invoice and Packing Slip are always safely enclosed with your book(s), so that should an unfortunate incident occur to exterior labelling and/or packaging, postal employees can identify the rightful owner of the contents and complete delivery. We try to think of everything!\n\nWe then choose one of the various shipping services offered by Canada Post to meet your chosen shipping timeframe. While not all services include a Tracking Number, if the one that we choose to use does, we enter this number into the Order Details and/or email our customers this information, so that its delivery progress can be monitored, if customers choose to do so. Packages that are shipped including a Tracking Number also include Insurance. If we choose to ship a package using a service that does not include a Tracking Number and Insurance, it is only when it is not economically feasible to do otherwise.\n\nIf you have any special requests regarding packaging and shipping, please just let us know. We want to work with you to ensure complete purchase satisfaction.\n\nWhen initiating a RETURN: (1) Please notify us of your intent to return a purchase and the reason why via email. (2) Please initiate the Return through abebooks, using the correct procedures (see AbeBooks Help for reference). (3) Please return the item (in the condition you received it) to us packed as you received it in the packing material you received it in, using the same or similar postal service."
