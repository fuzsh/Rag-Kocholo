        "text": "Edward Elmer Smith (1890 – 1965), publishing as E. E. Smith, Ph.D. and later as E. E. “Doc” Smith, was an American food engineer (specializing in doughnut and pastry mixes) and science-fiction author, best known for the Lensman and Skylark series. He is sometimes called the father of space opera.\n\nIn his 1947 essay “The Epic of Space”, Smith listed (by last name only) authors he enjoyed reading: John W. Campbell, L. Sprague de Camp, Robert A. Heinlein, Murray Leinster, H. P. Lovecraft, and A. Merritt (specifically The Ship of Ishtar, The Moon Pool, The Snake Mother, and Dwellers in the Mirage, as well as the character John Kenton), C. L. Moore (specifically “Jirel of Joiry”), Roman Frederick Starzl, John Taine, A. E. van Vogt, Stanley G. Weinbaum (specifically “Tweerl”), and Jack Williamson. In a passage on his preparation for writing the Lensman novels, he notes that Clinton Constantinescu’s “War of the Universe” was not a masterpiece, but says that Starzl and Williamson were masters; this suggests that Starzl’s Interplanetary Flying Patrol may have been an influence on Smith’s Triplanetary Patrol, later the Galactic Patrol. The feeding of the Overlords of Delgon upon the life-force of their victims at the end of chapter five of Galactic Patrol seems a clear allusion to chapter 29 of The Moon Pool, Merritt’s account of the Taithu and the power of love in chapters 29 and 34 also bear some resemblance to the end of Children of the Lens. Smith also mentions Edgar Rice Burroughs, complaining about loose ends at the end of one of his novels.\n\nE. E. Smith’s novels are generally considered to be classic space operas, and he is sometimes called the first of the three “novas” of 20th-century science fiction (with Stanley G. Weinbaum and Robert A. Heinlein as the second and third novas).\n\nRobert A. Heinlein credited him for being his main influence:\n\nI have learned from many writers—from Jules Verne and H.G. Wells and Campbell and Sinclair Lewis, et al.—but I have learned more from you than from any of the others and perhaps more than for all the others put together …\n\nE. E. Smith expressed a preference for inventing fictional technologies that were not strictly impossible (so far as the science of the day was aware) but highly unlikely: “the more highly improbable a concept is—short of being contrary to mathematics whose fundamental operations involve no neglect of infinitesimals—the better I like it” was his phrase.\n\nLensman was one of five finalists when the 1966 World Science Fiction Convention judged Isaac Asimov‘s Foundation the Best All-Time Series.\n\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Smith in 2004\n\nE. E. Smith – First Edition Identification Guide\n\nNote: This list only includes works published prior to 1977.\n\nE. E. Smith – First Printing Dust Jacket Identification Points\n\nGallery of First state Dust Jackets of E. E. Smith’s works. Only includes the first appearance in book form.
