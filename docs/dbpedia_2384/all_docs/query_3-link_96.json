        "text": "Click To Help Harley Quinn! Harley Quinn thinks that this article looks kinda boring, eh? Why not put some categories there to spice it up?\n\nHelp by adding new categories to the article!\n\nâœ“\n\nHypnos is a major antagonist of the Saint Seiya franchise. He's the god of sleep who resides in the Elysium. Alongside his twin brother Thanatos, he's one of the two most loyal and powerful servants of the god of the underworld Hades, helping him in his purpose to wipe out humanity and take control of the earth, facing the Saints of Athena throughout the centuries. He's one of the three secondary antagonists (alongside Thanatos (Saint Seiya) and Pandora (Saint Seiya)) of both the Hades arc of the original series and the spin-off series Saint Seiya The Lost Canvas.\n\nHe is voiced by Tomohiro Tsubou\n\nAppereance[]\n\nHypnos has the look of a young man with long golden hair and golden eyes, the opposite of his brother who has silver hair and eyes. Most of the time, he wears a long white robe that hides his Surplice Cloth, which is a gold and black armor (purple in the original manga) with a pair of wings that resemble the tail of a peacock. He also wears an helmet or diadem that surrounds his face and harbors two small wings, with the right one bigger and longer than the left one. He also has a pentagram star mark on the front of his head (in the anime, once he dies, this mark disappears).\n\nIn The Lost Canvas, he's seen with a priest cassock, serving as his casual outfit.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nHypnos is a calm, rational, and cold god and the complete opposite of his twin brother Thanatos, who is more impulsive and arrogant. Alongside his brother, he's the most loyal Servant devoted to Hades, making sure that his goals and desires are achieved, making sure that his orders are followed throughout his army, and making sure that nothing happens to him like it showed when he tries to stop the Bronze Saints from reaching the temple of Hades. Despite being a servant of Hades, Hypnos despises death and murder, preferring to put his enemies to an endless sleep, and kills only if it's necessary.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nNot much is known about Hypnos's past. Ever since the age of myth, he served Hades in his goal to conquer the earth and destroy all of mankind as his right-hand man. Due to that, he fought Athena and her Saints. It appears that he had witnessed the birth of the first God Cloth. He and Thanatos's identity became known during the Holy War of the 16th Century when he and his brother killed most of the Saints after Hades was sealed again. In that circumstance, the Athena of that time had to sacrifice herself to prevent them to descend into earth.\n\nThe Lost Canvas[]\n\nIn the 18th Century, Hypnos managed to descend into the earth to prepare for the awakening of Hades and the revival of his army. He becomes the priest of the local church of the Italian city where Hades's vessel, Alone, lives. He manages to corrupt him and make him feel the influence of the god by making him witness a perfect painting. Once Alone starts, Hypnos starts to direct both Pandora and the boy in commanding the army of Specters, noticing on several occasions the impulsiveness of both Pandora and Alone. At a certain point during the war, the Saints of Athena manage to reach the floating palace where he and Thanatos reside and he leaves Thanatos to face the Gold Saint Manigoldo and the Pope of Athena, sage. After Thanatos gets sealed in a box by Sage, Hypnos starts to become more active. He first sends his loyal Servants, the four gods of dreams to deal with the Saints of Athena, but they all get defeated by Tenma of Pegasus and the Gold Saint El Cid. The Saints of Athena then are ready to assault the castle of Hades, with Hakurei, one of the survivors of the previous Holy War, reaching one of the main rooms, where a barrier that weakens the Saints is activated. Before the man can destroy the barrier, Hypnos attacks him and engages in a battle with him. While the difference between the two is clear at first, Hakurei manages to gather the souls of the warriors of the previous Holy War and use his final technique, Seikishi Tenryo Ha and throws it at Hypnos. The god manages to block it at first, but Hakurei adds his soul to the attack which overwhelms Hypnos, defeating him and sealing him to the box as well. At the end of the series, Pandora puts the box with the sealed gods inside a mausoleum, where Hypnos would have waited for the next 200 years to be free again.\n\nSaint Seiya[]\n\nAround the year 1979, Thanatos and Hypnos managed to influence Pandora and his dog to reach the mausoleum where they were sealed. Through their manipulation, Pandora opens the box with the seal weakened, freeing Thanatos and Hypnos, who choose the girl to become the priestess of Hades in sight of his revival, saying that the spirit of Hades would have been born on the girl's younger brother. After promising her to grant her eternal life, the two deities go back to the Elysium, watching over Pandora and the preparation for the Holy War. Thanatos and Hypnos also tell Pandora about Hades's new vessel, Shun. Towards the end of the war, Athena follows Hades in the Elysium, where Hypnos meets her and puts her to sleep to put her inside a sacred jar that drains her of her blood, unaware of the fact that Athena planned for this. He then meets up with his brother Thanatos, who is busy dealing with the Bronze Saints who reached Elysium, putting him on guard before leaving. He returns once he feels the arrival of the God Cloth, an omen that turns out to be true. After witnessing the defeat and death of his brother at the hands of Seiya, Hypnos tries to stop him from reaching the temple of Hades but fails to do it after Seiya attacks him to run away. He's then forced to face the rest of the Bronze Saints, with three of them, Shun, Shiryu, and Hyoga, awakening the God Cloths. He manages to put Shun to sleep through his technique and manages to keep up with both Shiryu and Hyoga, but the two Saints manage to get through his attack and strike him down, with Hypnos bewildered to being defeated by humans. After Hades awakens in his true body, Hypnos tells the Saints that the world is ruined now that Hades is fully awakened and then passes away.\n\nPower and Abilities[]\n\nAs a god, Hypnos has supernatural and overwhelming powers. Much like the other gods of the franchise, it is said to have reached the legendary ninth sense. As the deity of sleep, he can manipulate the other's sleep, making them slumber even forever. His special technique Is called Eternal Drownsiness which puts the enemy to sleep since he prefers to put the enemies into slumber. If he gets defeated, the effects of his powers are nullified. He can also manipulate his spirit and form a material body for himself, as it's shown in The Lost Canvas.\n\nTrivia[]"
