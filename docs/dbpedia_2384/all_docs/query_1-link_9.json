        "text": "Hi Lauren,\n\nUnfortunately, Hypnos are very secretive about the content of their mattresses and do not always specify the number of spring in some of their mattresses. The Hypnos Reactive 10 is a ten turn pocket spring developed by them. To give context most pocket springs have 8 turns. So they have included a further 2. We guess this is to make the spring more 'reactive' though our experience in designing with springs means that this benefit would be very minor. The Reactive 10 pocket springs are synthetic spun-bond springs.\n\nWhen compared to Calico springs which are far more reactive due to their cotton cover and stitching vs glue that holds synthetic spun-bond springs together. It's worth weighing all of this up when looking at 'spring innovations' to see if they are really offering you any benefit or just a marketing spin. Without more details from Hypnos, we can't say one way of the other on their Reactive 10 springs.\n\nOur Origins Pocket 1500 is said to feel similar to the Hypnos Premier Inn mattress. The pocket 1500 contains 1500 pocketed springs in a King size model.\n\n[recommended-product post=\"627306\"]\n\nAs far as being a true pocket spring is concerned, these are spring contained in the individual pocket of either calico or spun bond fabric. Springs which are not contained within these pockets are usually connected together by utilising wire or some other joining material. A continuous coil is where the springs are made of one continuous piece of wire also known as the cage sprung mattress These should be avoided at all costs as they bounce and transfer movement really easily.\n\nI hope that this helps"
