        "text": "Description\n\nHypnos Head On Base (God Of Sleep) Bust 13″ Item No. F083 Dimensions: 7″L x 15″W x 13″H (18cm x 38cm x 33cm) Finish: Antique Stone\n\nMade of fiberstone. Fiberstone is a mixture of sand and stones cast into the surface using terrazzo-like techniques. The surface is then sandblasted and chemically treated, and then hand painted with an antique acid stain to give the appearance of aged stone. Since it is reinforced with a fiberglass backing, it remains less fragile and lighter alternative to concrete and cast stone. By mastering the art of casting our products in fiberglass we manage to retain all the detail or the original with the added benefits of less weight, greater strength, and product suitability for both indoor and outdoor use. The advantages of fiberstone and fiberglass when compared to concrete, cast stone, and cement are that they are about half the weight, are far less fragile, and much more resistant. Also, Fiberstone sculptures and architectural elements are weather resistant and can be safely displayed both indoor and outdoor in your garden, when coated with your choice of one of our outside grade color finishes.\n\nFinish as pictured: Antique Stone.
