        "text": "The first translation is different in Japanese and Cronus only indicates that he will destroy Aiolia.\n\nCronus: 我が大鎌（デュナミスドレパノン）の神力翼（デュナミスプチリュクス)は全ての刻を狩リ取リ崩ス...\n\nCronus: お前も原子のチリに崩れてモドレ...\n\nTranslation: \"The flames of my arms are an indicator: With each flame that is extinguished, a further shift in time occours. If you do not destroy me before they are all gone... Then everything both here and on Earth will collapse and end in ruin. And that not even Zeus will be able to avoid.\"\n\nThis part indicates that only the Earth (planet Earth) and the land where they were fighting (the castle of the Titans in the Tartarus) will be destroyed, it never indicates that the entire multiverse would be destroyed.\n\nTranslation: \"What happened? Get up already. Or are you going to let the flames of time be extinguished? When this flame fades, this earth will disappear. Oh, look... One's already gone.\"\n\nThis only describes that the earth, the place where Aiolia and Cronus were fighting would begin to be destroyed, even at the end of the fight the floor in that place is destroyed and the two fall into the depths of the Tartarus. Nor does it indicate that Cronus was destroying the multiverse.\n\nWhen this story was released, the concept of the multiverse was not even present in the franchise.\n\nIt is part of the multiverse and the Saint Seiya franchise, even the last chapter has a reference to the multiverse, because the version of Aiolos from this universe has a memory of the world of Seiya and company, or it is even possible that this Aiolos is the reincarnation of the Aiolos of the main universe.\n\nThe author of Saintia Sho probably made a reference at the beginning of Dark Wing, when Dysnomia mentions that a new universe was born in the multiverse.\n\nP1\n\nShaka: Spend the time...?\n\nShaka: Are you renouncing to fight?\n\nDysnomia: Hehe...\n\nDysnomia: I've already put you in \"quarantine\"\n\nDysnomia: My job as a dryad is done, don't you agree?\n\nDysnomia: Fighting now is meaningless... I'm actually not interested\n\nDysnomia: Furthermore, I want to know more about you... Mister Shaka\n\nShaka: ..........\n\nShaka: What on earth\n\nShaka: Is this place?\n\nP2 & P3\n\nDysnomia: Heh... You see...\n\nDysnomia: This is the place where all space-time from all Universes converge\n\nDysnomia: From the Myth Era to a far away future\n\nDysnomia: You can access it all from here, as you'd wish\n\nShaka was taken by Dysnomia's Reverse of Universe...?\n\nStage 81: Justice of the Saints/Justice for Saints\n\nDysnomia: A forbidden place where not even the gods eyes can reach\n\nDysnomia: ... Do you get it?\n\nDysnomia: If you look at any event or fate chosen by the stars\n\nDysnomia: They are just small fragments among millions of sparks\n\nDysnomia: Very, very tiny...\n\nP4\n\nDysnomia: Oh, look...\n\nDysnomia: It seems a new universe\n\nDysnomia: Is being born...\n\nEach universe has its own version of the gods, for example in Assassin we could even observe three different versions of Athena.\n\n- Saori is the Athena of the main world / universe.\n\n- Yoshino and Tomoe are an Athena from an unknown world who reincarnated as twins.\n\n- Saori who was killed by Aiolos and was the Athena of that world (named as Lost World in the manga).\n\nIf you read the thread, you’d see I’m not of the opinion Cronus is 2-A.\n\nand nothing you said proves canonicity for Dark Wing, vague references and reused characters doesn’t make a spin off canon. All works used in this thread are approved canon by Kurumada and/or appear on the official Saint Seiya timeline (there are blogs explaining this in the Wiki written by Matt).\n\nyou need a statement from Kurumada and/or the publisher to prove canonicity.\n\nas for there being multiple hosts for Athena, that’s been explained IN THE THREAD. It would be very much appreciated if you read the arguments.\n\nI have a question, because Cronus and Zeus are 2-A. What is the justification for this?\n\nI read the profile and it says that Cronus threatens to destroy the multiverse, but that never happened in the manga.\n\nCronus only says that his power affects the time of planet Earth (altering the different epochs of the planet) and the area where he was fighting with Aiolia (the castle of the Titans in the Tartarus).\n\nim not going to touch upon Cronos stuff currently. Overall my point is going to remain with Athena, and Hades scaling to Zeus\n\nEven each universe in the multiverse of Saint Seiya has its own version of the gods, for each universe there is a Hades, Cronus, Zeus, etc, so destroying the multiverse was never an option for a god. The only god that is likely unique is the version of Chronus that appears in ND.\n\nCronus and Zeus are probably 2-C by powerscalling of Hades and other gods.\n\nFirst, You can be 2-A without having 2-A Range but the 2-A Potency can be like the length of a sword\n\nNext;\n\nThis is impossible. Allow me to explain...\n\n2 identical beings cannot co-exist alongside each other in the same world. Both will desire to be unique and will not accept their duality. Saga's split personality suffered this fate. Ikki vs Aiolia was also this fate. Esermalda was reborn and suffered this fate.\n\nThis unique verse mechanic also extends to hierarchies, objects, and locations\n\nThis was all stated by pope Kanon\n\nand gets reiterated again by Ikki and Seiya\n\nWhy is this mechanic important?\n\nYoshino (an Athena) existed in the same timeline as Kido Saori Athena for 16 years without any issue.\n\nChaos Athena of the Lost World met Yoshino Athena which is her twin, but the two of them had no issue. (there is 3 scans here) In fact, the Lost World wants her back in their own world.\n\nIn other words; They are all the same being. Therefore, They do not kill each other. They are all the SAME Athena.\n\nZeus mentions any universe, any dimension, any time. This is lost world zeus speaking to Aiolia who was brought from some world or the past..to the timeline Seiya is in. Secondly; Assassins Timeline Poseidon directly stated that Lost World Zeus was his Brother.\n\nIt was pope Kanon that approved the resurrections of the gold saints. We learn here that Kanon managed to broker a deal with Hades This then leads into Aiolos implying there is only 1 underworld with his statement of \"I will conquer the underworld then one day.\" Why would Hades suddenly turn good anyways? When Hades had fought Athena for thousands of years for control over the earth before these events? Its because Lost world (other world) Ikki managed to do that Illusion demon fist (The stronger one) on Shun-Hades. It was at that moment, the first time, in the franchise that we ever seen a good Hades. Which then leads into this next part. The summon spell pope Kanon approved of was to target Camus which we then see him talking to Shun-Hades. Again this tells us there is only 1 Hades.\n\nI must add that Dark Wing is about a \"Good\" Hades and the first time we ever seen that is in Assassins AFTER Hades had the Demon fist used on him by God Cloth Ikki.\n\nEach universe has its own Underworld and each universe has its own version of Hades. The Underworld is not nexus to all realities, it is only the world of the dead, a world completely different from the time-space of the universe (it is not even affected by the distortion in time-space that is destroying the universe), but it is world created by Hades' version of that universe. Aiolos uses a portal (black nucleus) to connect his world (Lost World) with another world.\n\nYour point is immediately debunked by all my other points stated upon on this thread. Only 1 Hades, Only 1 Underworld, Aiolos used that only Underworld to move to other realities, and the Underworld is stated to be connected to all realities (worlds) All the scans to prove that are here.\n\nIt was never the attack with the power of 12 Gold Saints, because it was only an attack with a fraction of the power of some Gold Saints (Taurus, Cancer, Pisces and Aries), Silver Saints and Bronze Saints.\n\nHakurei's attack only uses the souls of his former companions to strengthen his technique, but they are only souls with a fraction of the cosmos of the Saints, a group of souls that weren't even wearing his true armor.\n\nPower scaling;\n\nOnes Attack Potency in their Cosmo is proportional to their durability with their cloth.\n\nGod Cloth Seiya fights Thanatos. God cloth Seiya blocks, and tanks Terrible providence which was able to destroy the Libra Weapons.\n\nGod Cloth Seiya pegasus Meteror Fisted Hypnos and it appears to have did nothing despite Seiya being able to defeat Thanatos so easily, but all it did make Hypnos compliment seiya and make Hypnos tremble with cold sweat.\n\nIt is part of the multiverse and the Saint Seiya franchise, even the last chapter has a reference to the multiverse, because the version of Aiolos from this universe has a memory of the world of Seiya and company, or it is even possible that this Aiolos is the reincarnation of the Aiolos of the main universe.\n\nThe author of Saintia Sho probably made a reference at the beginning of Dark Wing, when Dysnomia mentions that a new universe was born in the multiverse.\n\nThis is unfounded assumption with no proof or backing. There is nothing supporting this hypothesis. even you yourself imply that this is assumption.\n\nThere is also many multiverses which is directly stated and the Japanese raw makes no sense unless you make the word multiverse plural.\n\nEach universe has its own version of the gods, for example in Assassin we could even observe three different versions of Athena.\n\n- Saori is the Athena from the world of the future who appears in Assassin.\n\n- Yoshino and Tomoe are an Athena from an unknown world who reincarnated as twins.\n\n- An Saori who was killed by Aiolos and was the Athena of that world.\n\nAgain this is literally impossible, and is debunked, by an in-verse mechanic setup by the Author and very elaborately explained to us.\n\nAdditionally, Athena is reincarnating her true body. So her splitting her \"true body\" apart into twins further supports my claim; that literally every Athena in the multiverse is the same Athena, they are all aspects of the same being. Hence why they don't kill each other when another enters into another world because they are the same person. It is a different host body every time but the Goddess possessing them is the same. Only 1 Athena but infinite host bodies.\n\nSorry been absent for a few days.\n\nNo harm done buddy. I know what its like to be busy. I work 12 hour shifts Monday through Friday and sometimes Saturdays. Covid has changed my work place.\n\nI still vehemently refuse the idea that there's only one god per universe. Not only does Lost Canvas and now Saintia Sho and Dark Wing directly contradict this, but I think people going \"I'm as strong as Zeus\" is hyperbole.\n\nHow do you feel about Saint Seiya Omega Cross Canon Scaling to the manga?\n\nAdditionally; You still haven't discussed Athena's power being needed to destroy the soul, and body of Zeus in the Lost World. Which Zeus directly stated himself that Athena needed to Bless the Arrow and Bow.... This is 2-A Hax at the very least\n\nEdit: Lost Canvas also doesn't disprove anything. Thanatos and Hypnos got little to no screen time, and it was Alone borrowing the power of a slumbering Hades up until the end of the manga.\n\nim not going to touch upon Cronos stuff currently. Overall my point is going to remain with Athena, and Hades scaling to Zeus\n\nFirst, You can be 2-A without having 2-A Range but the 2-A Potency can be like the length of a sword\n\nIf they don't destroy or threaten to destroy a multiverse (with infinite universes) they cannot be 2-A. The gods (with the probable exception of Chronos because he incarnated all of space and time) in Saint Seiya have no feats to be considered as 2-A and the feats of the gods only indicate that they are 2-C.\n\nDohko (Gold Saint of Libra from another world) did not turn into a demon and tried to destroy Shiryu (Gold Saint of Libra from that world) when they met.\n\nShion (Gold Saint of Aries from another world) and Kiki (Gold Saint of Aries from that world) lived together in the world for years and did not destroy each other. The problems with time only began to increase as the portal grew stronger and began to unite the two worlds (planets).\n\nYoshino only woke up as Athena at the end of the story and we don't know what happened to her, because she doesn't appear in Requiem.\n\nZeus mentions any universe, any dimension, any time. This is lost world zeus speaking to Aiolia who was brought from some world or the past..to the timeline Seiya is in. Secondly; Assassins Timeline Poseidon directly stated that Lost World Zeus was his Brother.\n\nIt was pope Kanon that approved the resurrections of the gold saints. We learn here that Kanon managed to broker a deal with Hades This then leads into Aiolos implying there is only 1 underworld with his statement of \"I will conquer the underworld then one day.\" Why would Hades suddenly turn good anyways? When Hades had fought Athena for thousands of years for control over the earth before these events? Its because Lost world (other world) Ikki managed to do that Illusion demon fist (The stronger one) on Shun-Hades. It was at that moment, the first time, in the franchise that we ever seen a good Hades. Which then leads into this next part. The summon spell pope Kanon approved of was to target Camus which we then see him talking to Shun-Hades. Again this tells us there is only 1 Hades.\n\nI must add that Dark Wing is about a \"Good\" Hades and the first time we ever seen that is in Assassins AFTER Hades had the Demon fist used on him by God Cloth Ikki.\n\nThe characters acquire the memory of their version of the other world by the proximity of the worlds through the portal (black core).\n\n- Images\n\nAiolos also says that that version of Aiolia from another world is his brother and Shura from another world is his murderer, because he acquired the memory of Aiolos from that world (who was killed by Shura during Saga's rebellion). Even when that Aiolos has a different story and never died.\n\nPoseidon also fought with Athena for years, but he helps the Saints in the Hades Arc and returns to help the Saints in the invasion of Aiolos. Hades only made a deal after Athena destroys his true body, because as Dohko explains, if they destroy the god's body, he would give up his plans.\n\nShun / Hades is a different version of Hades, because it is Hades's version of the world of Aiolos. Even his fight against the Saints is different and Ikki with his last attack manages to awaken the soul of his brother.\n\n- Images\n\nThis Hades is a combination of the soul of Shun and Hades.\n\n- Images\n\nThe soul of Hades from the world of the future or the universe where the story takes place, appears to stop the destruction of his Underworld by the Black Nucleus that united the worlds.\n\n- Images\n\nIn the universe of Dark Wing, Hades has a different personality and made his peace with Athena, which is why the Saints and Specters have not fought in centuries.\n\nThey are different gods and souls, and each god has his own underworld in his universe.\n\nYour point is immediately debunked by all my other points stated upon on this thread. Only 1 Hades, Only 1 Underworld, Aiolos used that only Underworld to move to other realities, and the Underworld is stated to be connected to all realities (worlds) All the scans to prove that are here.\n\nAiolos uses the Black Nucleus (the strange singularity that was created when he killed his Athena) to travel to other worlds.\n\n- Images\n\nThe same singularity that united his world with the other world and thanks to the collision with the Crystal Wortex amplified its power and was even able to move the entire planet to that world / universe.\n\n- Images\n\nDohko only refers to the super dimension (the strange dimensional space that separates the Underworld and Elysium) in that scene.\n\nAthena only traveled to the past of his universe to steal the sword of Hades and change history to save Seiya.\n\nSeiya's soul in the Yomotsu Hirakasa may be a consequence of the distortion in space and time that threatens the universe, or confirms that the Yomotsu is a different space and time from the rest of the universe, just like the Underworld (which is not it is even affected by the distortion of space and time that threatens to destroy the universe). But this does not indicate that it is the same Underworld in all worlds.\n\nEach universe has its own Hades and Athena. In the Assassin story, the author showed three different versions of Athena and two different versions of Hades.\n\nAdditionally, Athena is reincarnating her true body. So her splitting her \"true body\" apart into twins further supports my claim; that literally every Athena in the multiverse is the same Athena, they are all aspects of the same being. Hence why they don't kill each other when another enters into another world because they are the same person. It is a different host body every time but the Goddess possessing them is the same. Only 1 Athena but infinite host bodies.\n\nNo, there is only one goddess Athena for each universe, the goddess does not use other bodies and reincarnates as a human, therefore, the goddess appears with her true body that reincarnates as a human. That Athena is described as a special case in the Multiverse and it also describes that Yoshino is more powerful and a better successor to Athena than her sister. Even each Athena has different memories, Saori does not have the memories of other Athenas (such as Sasha, TLC's 16th Century Athena, Avenir's World Athena, etc.) of the multiverse, because they are different gods.\n\nThis is also the same with the different versions of Hades in the multiverse, because they do not remember the events of each world, for example Hades OM has no memories of the events of the world of TLC, the world of the future of Avenir (where he won the holy war and killed Athena) and the world of Aiolos (where he ended up trapped in Shun's body).\n\nThe Underworlds are different, even the Underworld was destroyed in Dark Wing and probably also in the world of TLC because it is hinted that his future is similar to what was observed in the original manga (where the Underworld was destroyed with the death of Hades), but it still exists in the world of the future of Assassin and the world of Aiolos (a world with a very different story).\n\nEven Sho and TLC have a very different version of Ares in their universes.\n\nThis is unfounded assumption with no proof or backing. There is nothing supporting this hypothesis. even you yourself imply that this is assumption.\n\nThere is also many multiverses which is directly stated and the Japanese raw makes no sense unless you make the word multiverse plural.\n\nThe author mentions in the manga (Saintia Sho #81 which was published on January 19, 2021) ) that a new universe was born in the multiverse, a chapter after the beginning of Dark Wing (which began its publication on December 19, 2020), the reference is clear.\n\nThe author only describes that it is a multiverse.\n\nDohko: 異なる[宇宙] [世界]多元宇宙はすぐ近くに存在する...\n\nIt's interesting, because Okada is the only japanese author who writes that word as multiverse (マルチバース).\n\nEven the Spanish and Portuguese translations describe this as a multiverse.\n\n- Images\n\nyou're not understanding, why would the multiverse need to be effected? if Gaia is being summoned to a specific universe, there's 0 reason the multiverse would need to be effected, that's your head cannon.\n\nYes, the universe where that version of Gaia exists, because it does not exist in another universe. Each universe has its own version of the gods.\n\nbeing summoned to a specific universe =/= being only universal in range, Gods are literally 2-C based on Hades' UW so that logic doesn't even make sense.\n\nBecause it is their range and they only affect that universe, it is even described that they will return to take that universe, not the rest of the multiverse.\n\nThe argument is there's only 1 of each primordial, not that they're multiversal. If Gaia is summoned into 1 specific universe but can freely traverse the multiverse then effectively it doesn;t matter what universe she's summoned in to. That is my point. I'm not arguing for multiversal AP idk why you keep equating \"1 primordial/1 God to multiversal\", there can exist 1 single Gaia throughout a multiverse without Gaia being multiversal.\n\nNo, each universe has its own version of Gaia, and the Gaia that will be resurrected is the version of the universe where the Requiem story takes place. It is never said that Gaia and these gods can travel to other universes, it is even said that they only plan to take that universe back when they return.\n\nShe does twice in the series, as does Shaka and the other Gold Saints in ND, 8th sense users in LC have time traveled without the aid of Chronos. Saori needing Chronos' help in ND is literally an outlier when the series is considered as a whole.\n\nEDIT: Zeus can time travel without Chronos, the UW can be used to time travel (Seiya's soul in the past despite dying in the future), Aiolos sent his message throughout time in ND, Aiolos time travels in GA, Aiolia time travels in GA....\n\nShe never travel in time, that is only the cosmos of Athena helping Aiolia in that battle, something similar she also did with Kaon when she helped him survive with his cosmos in Cape Sounion.\n\nAthena has to ask her brothers for help to travel through time, and Artemis explains that she does not have that power either and needs the help of Chronos if she wishes to travel through time.\n\nThe Gold Saints currently exist on a completely different plane of existence (Shaka mentions that he reached Nirvana), they were even destroyed in body and soul in the explosion of the Wailing Wall. It is just an ability of these characters, which not even gods like Artemis and Athena possess.\n\nIn TLC they needed help from Chronos to travel through time and change the history of their universe.\n\nZeus never traveled in time, he only traveled to other universes. Aiolos need a ritual and his Athena to kill the strange singularity (black nucleus) to travel in time and other universes.\n\nThese aren't counters. You are repeating what I've already countered, this is known as ad nauseum, I won't be addressing the same points again. You're equating range, ap and existence in a really weird way when I've already explained how that's false.\n\nBecause that is what is shown in the history of this franchise. The gods do not affect the multiverse and neither are they a unique being in the entire multiverse. As explained, these gods only affect one universe, they will even only sacrifice the Earth of a universe to bring them back, and they clearly say that they will only seek to take back the universe, not the multiverse.\n\n\"she never traveled in time\" proceeds to admit she traveled in time\n\nanother time travel feat.\n\nIt's because she never traveled back in time in that scene, that's why even Cronos realizes that Saga never killed Athena, because the god believed that Saga killed Athena when she was a baby.\n\nNo, it only shows that Athena's cosmos can help the Saints in different parts of the world.\n\nPlot induced stupidity as Kuramada then shows literal 12 characters all able to time travel without any sort of help from any deity AND showed Hades' UW allows for time travelof some sort.\n\nIt is the main manga and the main author, who says that she cannot travel in time. Even the time travel and the three-day limit imposed by Chronos is a main part of the plot.\n\nAre you implying Gold Saints with 8th sense (which Athena has unlocked) exist on some higher plane Gods can't despite there being literal evidence that I've shown of Gods time traveling?\n\nNo, it only indicates that the Gold Saints reached a realm that even the gods cannot reach. Even Sho confirms that there are realms that even the gods cannot reach, for example the plane of existence where Dysnomia can observe the entire multiverse, that is why Dysnomia is interested in Shaka, because he is someone with a knowledge that even transcends the gods.\n\nWhat I sent was a different instance. The scan showed was an 8th sense user explainign to Virgo and Sagi (LC) how the 8th sense works whilst showing them modern technology (Asmita even gets hit by a train). This happened in the Virgo Gaiden.\n\nMy point is, Gaia scales to all these characters who can freely traverse time ans/or the multiverse, as such, being summoned to a single universe doesn't contradict anything.\n\nIt is just an illusion and vision of the future that Alkes (Ilias's wife) showed them, who was one of the Oracles of Delfos and had the power to see the future.\n\nNo, because it is unknown if she has that power in the story and is even described to be a rare power even among the gods. She is also not a unique being in the entire multiverse as each universe has its own version of the gods, the only god that is likely unique in the entire multiverse is Chronus and only because he is described as the embodiment of all time and space. ."
