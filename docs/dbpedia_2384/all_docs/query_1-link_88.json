        "text": "Hypnosis is a state of mind that is characterized by focused attention and heightened receptivity for suggestions. It is either established by compliance with instructions or achieved naturally; the critical nature of the mind is bypassed during hypnosis and acceptable suggestions are delivered. Misperceptions about hypnosis by clinical practitioners and their clients have been shaped through years of inaccurate but interesting portrayals of hypnosis in books, plays, and movies. Part of the misperceptions is that individuals with seemingly magical powers to manipulate the unsuspecting innocent with their authoritative voice commands and penetrating eyes are depicted as hypnotists. This chapter will review the traditional and conventional approaches used in hypnosis, their advantages and disadvantages as well as where hypnosis is used as a complementary or alternative therapy to the modern day orthodox medicine. Despite the pejorative image display of hypnosis and misconceptions surr...\n\nHypnotism, the study of hypnosis has many facets which may not be known to the common man. This paper will make the readers aware of the origin of Hypnosis and will take them on a journey of the history of hypnosis, acquaint the readers to the stalwarts in the field and enlighten them on the evolution of this mysterious field. We shall explore the process in detail and shall learn how hypnosis is done, what effect does it leave on the subject being hypnotized, what changes happen in the body and the brain of the subject, how the subject responds to the suggestions of the hypnotizer, how the patients suffering from pain, addiction and psychiatric disorders respond positively and get treated by hypnotherapy. We shall also explore the dark side of hypnosis and shall see the similarity between hypnosis and parapsychological phenomena and how hypnosis can help in parapsychological research. We shall also examine whether the hypnosis phenomenon is scientific. On the whole, we shall be looking at many perspectives of hypnosis in the paper.\n\nThe two-hundred-year history of hypnosis and its predecessor, animal magnetism, is replete with stories of unusual phenomena. Perhaps surprisingly, a close reading of that history reveals that investigators and students of hypnosis have been unable to achieve an agreed-upon definition of their subject matter. Because of this failure to describe the essential nature of hypnosis, they resorted to lists of hypnotic phenomena as a means for confirming the presence of a hypnotic state in clinical and experimental situations. However, identification and enumeration of hypnotic phenomena proved to be problematic. The content of these lists varied from era to era and from practitioner to practitioner, and the selection of phenomena seemed to be an arbitrary process. With no agreed-upon definition and no definitive list of phenomena that would apply to hypnosis and hypnosis alone, there was no way to ensure that the \"hypnosis\" that was being studied in clinical and experimental work was identical from one case to the next. This article offers a definition of hypnosis that is not based on lists of phenomena."
