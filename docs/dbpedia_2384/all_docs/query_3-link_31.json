        "text": "Description\n\nImpressive marble sculpture by Jean de Bay representing the allegory of the sea by depicting a Cupid braving the current in a small shell-shaped boat. He steers with an oar, sitting on a folded sail next to an anchor. Cupid’s determination to follow his own course and speed, with no desire to stop, may allude to the persistence of love against all odds.\n\nThe french sculptor Jean-Baptiste-Joseph de Bay (1802 – 1862)\n\nWith the same name as his sculptor father, Jean De Bay was born in Nantes on 31 August 1802. A pupil of his father and Baron Bosio, he entered the École des Beaux-Arts on the 22nd of December 1820. Jean De Bay received a first class medal in 1836 and a second class medal at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1855. He was made a knight of the Legion of Honour on the 25th of May 1851.\n\nHe died in Paris, at his home, 75, rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, on 7 January 1862, leaving some sculptures unfinished, which were ultimately completed by his brother Auguste De Bay.\n\nMaterial:\n\nWhite Carrara marble.\n\nDimensions:\n\nHeight: 101 cm.\n\nWidth: 85 cm.\n\nDepth: 48 cm.\n\nPeriod:\n\n1832\n\nDescription\n\nThe present sculpture represents the mythological story of Leda, a princess of Sparta who was seduced by Jupiter. In order to approach her, Jupiter transformed into a swan. Leaning back in ecstasy as she feels the soft plumage of the gently advancing swan behind her, Leda appears to willingly surrender to Jupiter’s seduction. A beautiful representation of female sensuality, this myth was depicted by some of the greatest artists in history going back as far as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael.\n\nReminding us in some ways of the Dance by Carpeaux, the present composition was inspired by Carpeaux’s Leda with the anatomical curves and the characteristic smile that illuminates the face. The diagonal line crossing Leda’s body creates a dynamic movement typical of Romanticism. The subject of Leda and the Swan is well known in art. It allows a very sensual representation that often pleases the viewer. The plaster model of Houssin’s “Léda” won an award at the Salon des Artistes Français in 1887. Thanks to its success, it was made in marble the following year. It is also without doubt Houssin’s most important surviving sculpture.\n\nThe french sculptor Edouard Houssin (1847 – 1917)\n\nThe sculpture is signed « E. Houssin 1888 ». Edouard Houssin (1847 – 1917) was born in Douai. He attended classes at the Douai Academic Schools in 1856, receiving many awards. In 1864 he moved to Paris where he was admitted to the « Ecole des beaux-arts » in 1866 in the workshops of Henri Lemaire and François Jouffroy.\n\nIn 1868, he exhibited for the first time a bust at the « Société des amis des arts de Douai ». From 1871 to 1877, he was appointed professor of sculpture at the Douai Art Schools. In 1873 he began to show his work at the Paris Salon, where he was awarded medals in 1887 and 1889. His commissions were largely centred on his native northern France. It included a number of monuments, as well as several figures in the Douai Museum.\n\nAt the beginning of 1894, he was appointed professor of modelling at the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres, a position he held until his death in 1919. On January 17, 1894, he participated in the conference followed by a banquet, organized by Charles Bodinier at the Théâtre d’Application, in honour of the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore with Paul Verlaine, Émile Gallé, Robert de Montesquiou and other personalities from the arts world. It was during this conference that the idea of a monument to the poetess was launched. He built the Monument to Marceline Desbordes-Valmore, inaugurated on July 13, 1896 in Douai.\n\nÉdouard Houssin has carried out numerous public commissions, particularly in northern France. In 1895, Fernand Lefranc wrote in « La Revue du Nord » : « His busts, all of them are of impeccable accuracy and admirably executed». Houssin’s monuments include Child with a panther (1881), Esmeralda (1883) Phaeton (1889), Loïe Fuller (1897), Saint Ignace (Braines) bronze cast by the Denonvilliers art foundry in 1888, the Lifeboat (1904).\n\nHe was a talented and well-known artist during his lifetime. Unfortunatly, the destruction and theft of nearly 90% of his work during the two great wars made him a relatively unknown artist today. As such, works by this artist are extremely rare and often heavily restored.\n\nMr Arnaud Debève, in charge of patronage for the Louvre Lens Museum, wrote the catalogue raisonné of the artist entitled « La Vie et l’Œuvre du sculpteur Édouard Houssin (1847-1919) » published in 2006. This testifies to the importance of the artist and the quality of his work.\n\nSome sculptures of Houssin can be found in museums such as :\n\nMan throwing a stone, Douai Museum\n\nLove stung by a bee, Douai Museum\n\nLéda, La Rochelle Museum\n\nMaterial:\n\nWhite Carrara marble.\n\nDimensions:\n\nHeight : 98,00 cm\n\nWidth: 55,00 cm\n\nDepth: 50,50 cm\n\nPeriod:\n\n1888\n\nDescription\n\nThe present marble exemplifies Barcaglia’s preoccupation with beautifully carved and highly realistic genre subjects. A poor boy in worn clothes with his handmade broom under the left arm and a scraper under his right arm, takes his lunch break. There is a piece of bread close to him on the couch. Meanwhile he sews a loose button on his vest\n\nThe realistic depicted worn clothes with holes and repairs. His far too small shoes where his heels pierce. The sculptor’s virtuoso treatment of marble is showcased in the naturalistic detail of the boy’s clothes and shoes, and the moss growing on the base. A variant of the model, in which the boy is polishing his shoe, is a popular feature in Paddington Gardens in Marylebone.\n\nThe italian sculptor Donato Barcaglia (1849 – 1930)\n\nDonato Barcaglia (1849 – 1930), born in Pavia, trained in Milan and Rome. During a period of outstanding technical accomplishment in marble carving, Barcaglia was renowned for the exceptional quality of his work in this medium. The last vestiges of neoclassicism which influenced his early work were soon replaced by a personal form of verismo. Following early successes such as his Vendemmiatore, which he sculpted at the tender age of seventeen and which was installed in the Palazzo Reale in Milan, the sculptor exhibited to great acclaim in Europe and America. His work brought him to exhibitions as far afield as Boston, Philadelphia, and Buenos Aires. Far from turning his back on his native Italy, Barcaglia executed several public monuments for Milan and its surrounding cities.\n\nMaterial:\n\nWhite Carrara marble\n\nDimensions:\n\nHeight : 111,00 cm\n\nBase : 46,00 x 42,00 cm"
