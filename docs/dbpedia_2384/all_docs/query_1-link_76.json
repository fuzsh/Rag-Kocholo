        "text": "Next is getting your character claimed. Claiming on this wiki is the process in which the character is approved for creation. Whether your character is a major character (what we consider demigods to be) or a minor character (pretty much anything that isn't a demigod, like satyrs, nymphs, etc) they must go through claiming. Our reason for this is to ensure uniformity and fairness across the wiki. This way powers are uniform, there aren't any OP (overpowered) characters, unfair story lines (someone trying to have their character raised by the god parent, which is directly stated in the PJO books to be not allowed), absurd story lines (one time there was a claim where an infant child was raised by cats) or crossing other genres and fictional lores with this one (one time a user tried to have a character that went to both Camp Half-Blood and Hogwarts >.>).\n\nMost users joining here are familiar with the Percy Jackson Books, whether they be the main original series (Heroes of Olympus) or the spin-off Roman camp (Lost Hero). A few key points to remember while heading into making your character:\n\nGreek vs Roman\n\nDespite that it is recognized that there are other gods out there, Greek, Norse, Egyptian, etc; here at this camp there are only Greek demigods, no Roman, no Norse, or any other mythos there is out there. We're working on Roman implementation, but we're not quite there yet!\n\nNo Imperial Gold weapons. Still working on that too!\n\nIf you have your character related to other gods in their past (for instance their father is Eros and their grandmother is Athena), that's fine, but it in no way gives special powers or advantages. They would only have powers their directly godly parent possesses. This is to ensure a uniform power base on the wiki so there are no unfair advantages.\n\nWeapons\n\nStygian Iron is allowed as a weapon, but only for certain gods with association to the underworld. The work the same effectively as Celestial Bronze. The only special metal is Adamantine, but that is reserved specifically for admin characters/large storyline use and in rare rare cases, not for regular campers to use.\n\nModern Weapons. Before you ask, yes there were guns in the books with celestial bronze bullets, and if you want it in your back story that's fine, HOWEVER no modern weapons will not be allowed at camp. This is another measure to ensure that powers remain fair and even.\n\nAge\n\nThe current youngest age allowed is 9, for those who are younger to have a wider character range. In general though, most on the wiki prefer roleplaying characters between the ages of 15 and 21, so it would be very hard to find a niche to RP in if you have say, a 7 year old character, they won't really have anyone to realistically interact with, just a bunch of older kids.\n\nMonster Attacks\n\nAn untrained demigod cannot realistically survive a multitude of monster attacks. It's unreasonable. Tf they had help, that's different, but not on their own. These monsters, while not smart, have been respawning for millennia, and have fought many a foe. They won't be deterred by loud noises or non-lethal weaponry, or an 11-year-old who doesn't know how to swing a heavy bronze sword properly.\n\nA child of Zeus, Poseidon or Hades should have at least one monster attack no later than the age of 11. All other demigods should have at least one monster attack no later than the age of 13. Now remember, just because they've narrowly avoided an attack doesn't mean they have to go directly to camp.\n\nSetting\n\nNow as far as the setting goes, we assume the events in the books happened 20 years prior to the present day. There are no canonical characters at Camp.\n\nFirst and foremost we follow the PJO books for how life is. The books presented the setting as present day more or less, so for the ease of everyone involved, we imagine that everything in life is true as we know it, with the exception of Greek gods being real and monsters and a camp to learn to fight it all. Biden is President, Prince William has a child, the current season at camp is the same as in the US right now, etc etc etc. So saying a 2 year old survived for 10 years on the streets is absurd and unrealistic, America uses group homes and foster care not orphanages, Harry Potter does not exist here, nor does Darth Vader. This may seem obvious to some, but we do get users asking for similar things in their character's backstories.\n\nWhat a claim looks like:\n\nName: <must be reasonable and cannot be blatantly off someone famous (i.e. Harrison Ford, Justin Bieber), cannot be the name of a PJO character (i.e. Percy Jackson) and should not be the main character of other popular series (i.e. Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, etc)>\n\nGod Parent: <Choose whichever parent you'd like. for Camp purposes, only use the provided cabin gods!>\n\nCurrent Age: <the age they are right now>\n\nAppearance: <what they look like or an image of what they look like (suggested but not needed)>\n\nPersonality: <Now some claim checkers are sticklers about checking this when they check claims, but generally this is just to show that you have put some thought into how you will be roleplaying your character on the wiki. They should be a character, not just an idea!>\n\nHistory: <Here's the biggest more important part of claiming. This should include: how the parents met and fell in love, the character being born, their early childhood, their first (and any subsequent) monster attack before getting to camp, and how they came to know about/get to camp. This should be an absolute minimum of 2 paragraphs.>\n\nPossessions/Weapons: <You can add this, but it is no longer needed in a claim. If you do add it, really its just to make sure that no one tries to get anything OP (overpowered) or OTT (over the top, aka absurd or unrealistic) for their character. (for instance a weapon that is charmed to never miss would be OP, an amulet that grants a child of Eros the power to shadow travel would be OP). Also, if you have your character using it in their claim to defeat a monster, make sure to put where your character got it! Celestial Bronze is rare, and doesn't just fall out of the sky (unless a god wanted it to...)>\n\nSigning Your Claim: Don't forget to put your signature at the end! (you can do that by clicking the signature button, or by typing ~~~~. That way, we can identify you more clearly.\n\nFor all the specifics, check out the example claim here.\n\nThis instructional video is outdated, but we'll be making a new one sometime soon!\n\nOnce you have completed your claim and hit submit, keep an eye on it! mMembers of the administration team will check it periodically and make any necessary notes or questions if anything is unclear, breaks rules or needs to be changed. Please, please please, I can't express enough, please, be patient with us. No one on the administration team gets paid to work here, this is all voluntary, we all have lives and things to do outside the internet. Many of us are students, some work, and most are generally busy people. Someone will get to your claim soon as possible, but because both the wiki and our lives can be very busy places, sometimes the claiming process can take anywhere from 1-5 days.\n\nThe claiming forum can be found, click this link.....\n\nAfter your claim is accepted, you should start on a page for your character. To do so, simply type the name of your character into the box below and click \"create\". For the Article title, put in the name of your character. If you spell it incorrectly or do something wrong, fear not, it can be corrected, on wiki there is no such thing as a permanent mistake. Keep in mind the first time you make the page it doesn't have to be pretty or coded or have fancy html, sometimes it's quicker to just copy/paste the information from your claim and get the page itself up, before exploring the world of html.\n\n<createbox> width=30 break=yes buttonlabel=Create a New Character preload=Template:Character </createbox>\n\n(The following instructions are credited to User:Mr.Mikachu from his blog, Coding 101)\n\nAs far as fancy stuff like coding and html and word bubbles, keep reading.\n\nThe Basics\n\nFirst of all, let's establish something important; CODING LOOKS DIFFERENT ON EVERY BROWSER. For example, you might have orange headers and a green background on Chrome but, when you look at Firefox, you might have grey headers and a green background. It's important to change both of the gradients\n\n-webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, color-stop(0, #2473BA), color-stop(1, #004188)); background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #2473BA 0%, #004188 100%);\n\nso your coding doesn't look messed up in a different browser.\n\nALSO READ THIS!! DO NOT EVER STEAL/USE/TWEAK ANYBODY'S CODING WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION!! ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO POLICY AGAINST IT, I WILL REVERT IT BACK TO THE DEFAULT VERSION IF YOU DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION!!\n\nDIV\n\nLet's start with the basics. If you're a starter, you probably will notice <div style= and </div>s. THESE ARE IMPORTANT!! DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THESE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!! Every <div style=\" matches with a </div> so if you want to delete something, remember to delete the </div> as well.\n\nTABLE\n\nSame goes with and s.\n\nWord Bubble Versions\n\nBasic\n\nMost basic Word Bubble, good for starters, easiest to use. click here for an instructional video on regular word bubbles\n\n{{Word Bubble |image = AshMika2v2.png |color = #9BC1C1 |color2 = #DBEFCD |textcolor = #DBEFCD |textcolor2 = #9BC1C1 |line = #9BC1C1 |fonttype = Harrington |charname = Ianto Buchanan |charpage = Ianto Buchanan |cabin = Hypnos' Cabin |godparent = Hypnos |title = The Welsh Sleeper |time = ~~~~~ |text = 'ello! }}\n\nBasic Minor\n\nThis is for Minor characters. click here for an instructional video on regular word bubbles\n\n{{Word Bubble 2 |image = AshMika2v2.png |color = #9BC1C1 |color2 = #DBEFCD |textcolor = #DBEFCD |textcolor2 = #9BC1C1 |line = #9BC1C1 |fonttype = Harrington |charname = Ianto Buchanan |charpage = Ianto Buchanan |species = Demigod |title = The Welsh Sleeper |time = ~~~~~ |text = 'ello! }}\n\nBasic Wide\n\nSame as previous one, just the picture is larger.\n\nNote: This version is for images that are wider than they are tall only...\n\n{{Word Bubble Wide |image = B42b9e8f5e5a3b2f37741acea85eda9c-d314nf3.jpg |color = #9BC1C1 |color2 = #DBEFCD |textcolor = #DBEFCD |textcolor2 = #9BC1C1 |line = #9BC1C1 |fonttype = Harrington |charname = Ianto Buchanan |charpage = Ianto Buchanan |cabin = Hypnos' Cabin |godparent = Hypnos |title = The Welsh Sleeper |time = ~~~~~ |text = 'ello! }}\n\nBasic Wide Minor\n\nThis is for Minor characters.\n\nNote: This version is for images that are wider than they are tall only...\n\n{{Word Bubble 2 Wide |image = B42b9e8f5e5a3b2f37741acea85eda9c-d314nf3.jpg |color = #9BC1C1 |color2 = #DBEFCD |textcolor = #DBEFCD |textcolor2 = #9BC1C1 |line = #9BC1C1 |fonttype = Harrington |charname = Ianto Buchanan |charpage = Ianto Buchanan |species = Demigod |title = The Welsh Sleeper |time = ~~~~~ |text = 'ello! }}\n\nGradient\n\nA fancier word bubble that looks nice.\n\n{{Word Bubble Gradient |image = AshMika2v2.png |color2 = #DBEFCD |color3 = #9BC1C1 |color4 = #BADFC5 |color = #8095AB |textcolor = #DBEFCD |textcolor2 = #9BC1C1 |line = #9BC1C1 |fonttype = Harrington |charname = Ianto Buchanan |charpage = Ianto Buchanan |cabin = Hypnos' Cabin |godparent = Hypnos |title = The Welsh Sleeper |time = ~~~~~ |text = 'ello! }}\n\nGradient Minor\n\nSame as the one before except the picture is larger.\n\n{{Word Bubble 2 Gradient |image = AshMika2v2.png |color2 = #DBEFCD |color3 = #9BC1C1 |color4 = #BADFC5 |color = #8095AB |textcolor = #DBEFCD |textcolor2 = #9BC1C1 |line = #9BC1C1 |fonttype = Harrington |charname = Ianto Buchanan |charpage = Ianto Buchanan |species = Demigod |title = The Welsh Sleeper |time = ~~~~~ |text = 'ello! }}\n\nGradient Wide\n\nSame as the one before except the picture is larger.\n\nNote: This version is for images that are wider than they are tall only...\n\n{{Word Bubble Gradient Wide |image = B42b9e8f5e5a3b2f37741acea85eda9c-d314nf3.jpg |color2 = #DBEFCD |color3 = #9BC1C1 |color4 = #BADFC5 |color = #8095AB |textcolor = #DBEFCD |textcolor2 = #9BC1C1 |line = #9BC1C1 |fonttype = Harrington |charname = Ianto Buchanan |charpage = Ianto Buchanan |cabin = Hypnos' Cabin |godparent = Hypnos |title = The Welsh Sleeper |time = ~~~~~ |text = 'ello! }}\n\nGradient Wide Minor\n\nNote: This version is for images that are wider than they are tall only...\n\n{{Word Bubble 2 Gradient Wide |image = B42b9e8f5e5a3b2f37741acea85eda9c-d314nf3.jpg |color2 = #DBEFCD |color3 = #9BC1C1 |color4 = #BADFC5 |color = #8095AB |textcolor = #DBEFCD |textcolor2 = #9BC1C1 |line = #9BC1C1 |fonttype = Harrington |charname = Ianto Buchanan |charpage = Ianto Buchanan |species = Demigod |title = The Welsh Sleeper |time = ~~~~~ |text = 'ello! }}\n\nIf you want to use the hexadecimal code for a custom colour, which gives you a wider variety of colours to use, here is a colour picker to help you.\n\nAlso, check out these websites:\n\nList of Colors From A-M\n\nList of Colors From N-Z\n\nPlease remember, everything that was in your claim should be on your character page. If we find a blank page with no history, it will be tagged and you will be asked to fix it. Coding may be fancy and pretty, but if you don't have a clue what you are doing, it is better to have a plain page or to ask someone else to help you make your page pretty, then to end up with a poorly coded page with lots of broken coding. Just remember, pretty/fancy html is optional and not required, at the end of the day it's better that your page be legible than have bright colours."
