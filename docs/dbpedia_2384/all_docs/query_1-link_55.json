Interiors Monthly was established in 2007, the magazine for the furniture and flooring, retail buyers is now seen as a leading magazine in the furniture and flooring sector. The magazine’s awards were announced in its August 2024 issue. Dids said, “Thank you so much for this prestigious award, I am honoured. It’s funny how life has its mysterious shifts and turns. Little did I know that when our own designs were copied so shamelessly over three decades ago, it would lead me on a different career path in life. We have some of the best and most innovative designers in the UK but, sadly, the insidious copycat culture is still a huge challenge impeding growth, costing precious resource to enforce, and causing untold stress. It has been a pleasure to work in this amazing sector for the past three decades”. Jessica said: “I am honoured to be singled out by Interiors Monthly for a lifetime achievement award this year. Thank you. My career in the furniture industry- and more specifically the bed industry – has been a wonderful journey over the past 40 plus years. I am pleased to have been able to make a difference.” Congratulations, Dids and Jessica! Read more: https://lnkd.in/ee-7x6Br\n\n6 weeks to go!
