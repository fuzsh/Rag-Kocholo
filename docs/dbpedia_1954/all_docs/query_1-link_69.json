        "text": "InSOTEC is a social sciences research project which aims to generate a better understanding of the complex interplay between the technical and the social in radioactive waste management and, in particular, in the design and implementation of geological disposal. It currently investigates and analyses the most striking socio-technical challenges to implementing geological disposal of radioactive waste in 14 national programs. A focus is put on situations and issues where the relationship between the technical and social components is still unstable, ambiguous and controversial, and where negotiations are taking place in terms of problem definitions and preferred solutions. Such negotiations can vary from relatively minor contestations, over mild commotion, to strong and open conflicts. Concrete examples of sociotechnical challenges are: the question of siting, introducing the notion of reversibility / retrievability into the concept of geological disposal, or monitoring for confidenc...\n\nThe European InSOTEC project aims to identify remaining socio-technical challenges for the implementation of geological disposal of radioactive waste in European countries. Geological disposal has been recognized as the reference solution in radioactive waste management by the European Commission, which has set up the IGD-TP as a platform to foster exchanges between authorities on research and development (R&D) on this topic. This paper turns to the national level to analyse national R&D programmes on radioactive waste management (RWM) and particularly, geological disposal (GD) in order to assess to what extent there are national platforms that broaden interaction beyond an expert community. For this, we focus on identifying those practices and structures that reflect a degree of inter-and transdisciplinarity in the design and implementation of national R&D programmes. Our argument, embedded in the Science and Technology Studies (STS) literature, is that the way GD is framed by the research and policy community has important implications for the processes of developing and governing a technology. From our empirical case studies, we will explore the extent to which social-science research is integrated and the way stakeholders may have an impact on the development of R&D programmes. Overall, including social science research as an integral part in R&D programmes on GD and fostering collaboration between different types of knowledge in the R&D agenda-setting phase may help in the consideration of GD as a socio-technical problem, where the social and the technical are inextricably linked.\n\nThe article develops a sociomaterial perspective on nuclear waste management by illuminating the role of geological formations and therefore 'nature' with respect to site selection procedures. Besides technical barriers (containers) and geotechnical barriers (filling materials), geological formations should serve as 'natural' barriers in their function as host rocks in order to isolate radioactive waste for thousands of years. Referring to empirical insights into the German procedure of site selection and ethnographic research on practices in a nuclear chemical laboratory, the contribution illustrates how humans and materials are interwoven in an alliance of multiple sociomaterial collaborations united by the task to isolate a toxic object-here, high-level radioactive waste. In this way, the article sheds light on how nature is addressed not only as a resource for an anthropocentric project but also as an active collaborator in order to master such disposal processes in the long run. Such a sociomaterial perspective aims to enrich sociotechnical considerations by emphasizing the role of nature as an integral part of nuclear waste management and by studying its complexity.\n\nThe producers of nuclear energy are responsible for the safe handling, management, and disposal of their wastes, as well as for the costs arising, according to the Finnish nuclear energy legislation. National authorities supervise the nuclear waste management and issue regulations for this purpose. The research needs of the authorities have traditionally been supported by public research programmes. The four-year KYT programme (2002Â–2005) followed the earlier public nuclear waste research programmes that started as long ago as in 1989. The main research area in KYT was in studies promoting the assessment of the longterm safety of the geological disposal of spent nuclear fuel. This wide area was divided into five sub-areas: (1) the methodology of safety assessment; (2) the release of radionuclides from the repository; (3) bedrock and groundwater; (4) radionuclide transport in bedrock, and (5) biosphere studies. The second research area covered strategic alternatives in spent nuclear ..."
