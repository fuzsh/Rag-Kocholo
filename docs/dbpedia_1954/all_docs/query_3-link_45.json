        "text": "Contemporary Obstetric Triage.\n\nPubMed\n\nSandy, Edward Allen; Kaminski, Robert; Simhan, Hygriv; Beigi, Richard\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe role of obstetric triage in the care of pregnant women has expanded significantly. Factors driving this change include the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, improved methods of testing for fetal well-being, increasing litigation risk, and changes in resident duty hour guidelines. The contemporary obstetric triage facility must have processes in place to provide a medical screening examination that complies with regulatory statues while considering both the facility's maternal level of care and available resources. This review examines the history of the development of obstetric triage, current considerations in a contemporary obstetric triage paradigm, and future areas for consideration. An example of a contemporary obstetric triage program at an academic medical center is presented. A successful contemporary obstetric triage paradigm is one that addresses the questions of \"sick or not sick\" and \"labor or no labor,\" for every obstetric patient that presents for care. Failure to do so risks poor patient outcome, poor patient satisfaction, adverse litigation outcome, regulatory scrutiny, and exclusion from federal payment programs. Understanding the role of contemporary obstetric triage in the current health care environment is important for both providers and health care leadership. This study is for obstetricians and gynecologists as well as family physicians. After completing this activity, the learner should be better able to understand the scope of a medical screening examination within the context of contemporary obstetric triage; understand how a facility's level of maternal care influences clinical decision making in a contemporary obstetric triage setting; and understand the considerations necessary for the systematic evaluation of the 2 basic contemporary obstetric questions, \"sick or not sick?\" and \"labor or no labor?\"\n\nObstetric Ultrasound\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNicholson, Stuart F.; Nimrod, Carl A.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThis article addresses the current indications for an obstetric ultrasound and describes the findings that it is reasonable to expect when reading an ultrasound report. The authors discuss several common obstetrical problems focussing the attention on the usefulness of the imaging information. Finally, they provide a glimpse into the future direction of obstetric ultrasound by discussing vaginal scanning, Doppler assessment of fetal blood flow, and routine ultrasound in pregnancy.

Although the obstetric complications have been related to the procoagulant properties of antiphospholipid antibodies, pathological studies of human placenta have shown the proinflammatory capacity of antiphospholipid antibodies via the complement system and proinflammatory cytokines. There is no general agreement on which antiphospholipid antibodies profile (laboratory) confers the greatest obstetric risk, but the best candidates are categories I and IIa. Combined treatment with low doses of aspirin and heparin achieves good obstetric and maternal outcomes. In this study, we also review the therapeutic possibilities in refractory cases, although the likelihood of progressing to other autoimmune diseases is low. We briefly comment on incomplete obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome, also known as antiphospholipid antibody-mediated pregnancy morbidity syndrome.

Obstetric anal sphincter injuries, which are the most severe form of perineal lacerations, result in disruption of the anal sphincter and, in some cases, the rectal mucosa during vaginal delivery. Long-term morbidity, including pain, pelvic floor disorders, fecal incontinence, and predisposition to recurrent injury at subsequent delivery may result. Despite several studies that have reported risk factors for obstetric anal sphincter injuries, no accurate risk prediction models have been developed. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors and develop prediction models for perineal lacerations and obstetric anal sphincter injuries. This was a nested case control study within a retrospective cohort of consecutive term vaginal deliveries at 1 tertiary care facility from 2004-2008. Cases were patients with any perineal laceration that had been sustained during vaginal delivery; control subjects had no lacerations of any severity. Secondary analyses investigated obstetric anal sphincter injury (3rd- to 4(th)-degree laceration) vs no obstetric anal sphincter injury (0 to 2(nd)-degree laceration). Baseline characteristics were compared between groups with the use of the chi-square and Student t test. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with the use of multivariable logistic regression. Prediction models were created and model performance was estimated with receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis. Receiver-operator characteristic curves were validated internally with the use of the bootstrap method to correct for bias within the model. Of the 5569 term vaginal deliveries that were recorded during the study period, complete laceration data were available in 5524 deliveries. There were 3382 perineal lacerations and 249 (4.5%) obstetric anal\n\n[Study on the first translated obstetrics book Tai chan ju yao (Essentials in Obstetrics)].\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, M\n\n2018-01-28\n\nIn 1893, Wan Tsun-mo translated and published Tai chan ju yao ( Essentials in Obstetrics ), the first monograph of western obstetrics in modern China, symbolizing the independence of obstetrics from such maternal and child books as Fu ying xin shuo and Fu ke jing yun tu shuo , which occupies an important position in the history of the development of modern Chinese obstetrics. The book introduced anatomy, physiology, pathology, embryology, diagnostics, surgery, pharmacology and other knowledge of obstetrics in a catechismal form, and had a detailed discussion of such advanced obstetrical technologies as antiseptic, anesthesia, forceps and cesarean section for the first time.Judging from the content and translation of Tai chan ju yao , this book has already possessed the basic knowledge system of modern obstetrics, though the translation appeared to be somewhat jerky and not elegant and the terminology needing to be further improved, it was not only used as an important medium for the introduction of obstetrical knowledge, but also of great clinical value.However, its influence was so weak that later researchers seldom mentioned this book.\n\nRisk Factors for the Development of Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries in Modern Obstetric Practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nRamm, Olga; Woo, Victoria G; Hung, Yun-Yi; Chen, Hsuan-Chih; Ritterman Weintraub, Miranda L\n\n2018-02-01\n\nTo characterize the rate of obstetric anal sphincter injuries and identify key risk factors of obstetric anal sphincter injuries, including duration of the second stage of labor. This retrospective cohort study included all singleton, term, cephalic vaginal deliveries within Kaiser Permanente Northern California between January 2013 and December 2014 (N=22,741). Incidence of obstetric anal sphincter injuries, defined as third- or fourth-degree perineal lacerations, was the primary outcome. Multiple logistic regression models were conducted to identify obstetric anal sphincter injury risk factors and high-risk subpopulations. The overall incidence rate of obstetric anal sphincter injuries was 4.9% (3.6% of women who delivered spontaneously vs 24.0% of women who had a vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery, P<.001, CI 18.1-22.6%). In bivariate and multivariate analyses, obstetric anal sphincter injury incidence was higher among women with second stage of labor longer than 2 hours, Asian race, nulliparity, vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, episiotomy, and vacuum delivery. Women with a vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery had four times the odds of obstetric anal sphincter injury (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 4.23, 95% CI 3.59-4.98) and those whose second stage of labor lasted at least 180 minutes vs less than 60 minutes had three times the odds of incurring obstetric anal sphincter injury (adjusted OR 3.20, 95% CI 2.62-3.89). Vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery conferred the highest odds of obstetric anal sphincter injury followed by prolonged duration of the second stage of labor, particularly among certain subpopulations. Understanding these risk factors and their complex interactions can inform antepartum and intrapartum decision-making with the goal of reducing obstetric anal sphincter injury incidence.\n\nMalpractice Burden, Rural Location, and Discontinuation of Obstetric Care: A Study of Obstetric Providers in Michigan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nXu, Xiao; Siefert, Kristine A.; Jacobson, Peter D.; Lori, Jody R.; Gueorguieva, Iana; Ransom, Scott B.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nContext It has long been a concern that professional liability problems disproportionately affect the delivery of obstetrical services to women living in rural areas. Michigan, a state with a large number of rural communities, is considered to be at risk for a medical liability crisis. Purpose This study examined whether higher malpractice burden on obstetric providers was associated with an increased likelihood of discontinuing obstetric care and whether there were rural-urban differences in the relationship. Methods Data on 500 obstetrician-gynecologists and family physicians who had provided obstetric care at some point in their career (either currently or previously) were obtained from a statewide survey in Michigan. Statistical tests and multivariate regression analyses were performed to examine the interrelationship among malpractice burden, rural location, and discontinuation of obstetric care. Findings After adjusting for other factors that might influence a physicianâs decision about whether to stop obstetric care, our results showed no significant impact of malpractice burden on physiciansâ likelihood to discontinue obstetric care. Rural-urban location of the practice did not modify the nature of this relationship. However, family physicians in rural Michigan had a nearly four fold higher likelihood of withdrawing obstetric care when compared to urban family physicians. Conclusions The higher likelihood of rural family physicians to discontinue obstetric care should be carefully weighed in future interventions to preserve obstetric care supply. More research is needed to better understand the practice environment of rural family physicians and the reasons for their withdrawal from obstetric care.

To identify incidence, indications, and complications of obstetric hysterectomy within a high-risk population. Transversal, retrospective study from July 1st 2004 to June 30 2006 at Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, Hospital de Ginecoobstetricia, Centro Medico Nacional de Occidente, IMSS. There were reviewed 103 patient' files with obstetric hysterectomy. Incidence was calculated, and clinical and socio-demographic characteristics, indications, and complications of obstetric hysterectomy identified and expressed in frequency, percentages, and central tendency measurements. Incidence of obstetric hysterectomy was 8 cases within every 1,000 obstetric consultation. Age average was 31.1 +/- 5.1 years. 72.8% had cesarean surgery history. Main indication was placenta previa associated with placenta accreta (33%), followed by uterine hypotony (22.3%). Complications were hypovolemic shock (56.3%), and vesical injuries (5.8%). There were no maternal deaths. Cesarean history induces higher obstetric hysterectomy incidence in women with high-risk pregnancy, due to its relation to placentation disorders, as placenta previa that increases hemorrhage possibility, and thus, maternal morbidity and mortality.\n\nObstetric fistula: what about gender power?\n\nPubMed\n\nRoush, Karen; Kurth, Ann; Hutchinson, M Katherine; Van Devanter, Nancy\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDespite over 40 years of research there has been little progress in the prevention of obstetric fistula and women continue to suffer in unacceptable numbers. Gender power imbalance has consistently been shown to have serious implications for women's reproductive health and is known to persist in regions where obstetric fistula occurs. Yet, there is limited research about the role gender power imbalance plays in childbirth practices that put women at risk for obstetric fistula. This information is vital for developing effective maternal health interventions in regions affected by obstetric fistula.\n\nThe malpractice premium costs of obstetrics.\n\nPubMed\n\nNorton, S A\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThis study examined, in 1992, the variation in the level of malpractice premiums, and the incremental malpractice premium costs associated with the practice of obstetrics for family practitioners and obstetricians. On average, in 1992 obstetricians and family practitioners providing obstetric services paid malpractice premiums of roughly $44,000 and $16,000, respectively. The incremental increase in malpractice premium costs represented roughly 70% of the premium the physicians would have paid had they not provided obstetric services. These results suggest that for both family practitioners and obstetricians, there is a considerable premium penalty associated with providing obstetric services which may have implications for women's access to obstetric services. Moreover, the results make it clear that physicians practicing in different states, and different specialists within a state, may face very different malpractice premium costs.\n\nRural-Urban Inequity in Unmet Obstetric Needs and Functionality of Emergency Obstetric Care Services in a Zambian District.\n\nPubMed\n\nNg'anjo Phiri, Selia; Fylkesnes, Knut; Moland, Karen Marie; Byskov, Jens; Kiserud, Torvid\n\n2016-01-01\n\nZambia has a high maternal mortality ratio, 398/100,000 live births. Few pregnant women access emergency obstetric care services to handle complications at childbirth. We aimed to assess the deficit in life-saving obstetric services in the rural and urban areas of Kapiri Mposhi district. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2011 as part of the 'Response to Accountable priority setting for Trust in health systems' (REACT) project. Data on all childbirths that occurred in emergency obstetric care facilities in 2010 were obtained retrospectively. Sources of information included registers from maternity ward admission, delivery and operation theatre, and case records. Data included age, parity, mode of delivery, obstetric complications, and outcome of mother and the newborn. An approach using estimated major obstetric interventions expected but not done in health facilities was used to assess deficit of life-saving interventions in urban and rural areas. A total of 2114 urban and 1226 rural childbirths occurring in emergency obstetric care facilities (excluding abortions) were analysed. Facility childbirth constituted 81% of expected births in urban and 16% in rural areas. Based on the reference estimate that 1.4% of childbearing women were expected to need major obstetric intervention, unmet obstetric need was 77 of 106 women, thus 73% (95% CI 71-75%) in rural areas whereas urban areas had no deficit. Major obstetric interventions for absolute maternal indications were higher in urban 2.1% (95% CI 1.60-2.71%) than in rural areas 0.4% (95% CI 0.27-0.55%), with an urban to rural rate ratio of 5.5 (95% CI 3.55-8.76). Women in rural areas had deficient obstetric care. The likelihood of under-going a life-saving intervention was 5.5 times higher for women in urban than rural areas. Targeting rural women with life-saving services could substantially reduce this inequity and preventable deaths.\n\n21 CFR 884.5100 - Obstetric anesthesia set.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2012-04-01 2012-04-01 false Obstetric anesthesia set. 884.5100 Section 884.5100 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) MEDICAL DEVICES OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL DEVICES Obstetrical and Gynecological Therapeutic Devices...\n\n21 CFR 884.5100 - Obstetric anesthesia set.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2013-04-01 2013-04-01 false Obstetric anesthesia set. 884.5100 Section 884.5100 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) MEDICAL DEVICES OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL DEVICES Obstetrical and Gynecological Therapeutic Devices...\n\n21 CFR 884.5100 - Obstetric anesthesia set.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2014-04-01 2014-04-01 false Obstetric anesthesia set. 884.5100 Section 884.5100 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) MEDICAL DEVICES OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL DEVICES Obstetrical and Gynecological Therapeutic Devices...\n\nExercise during pregnancy: the role of obstetric providers.\n\nPubMed\n\nMay, Linda E; Suminski, Richard R; Linklater, Emily R; Jahnke, Sara; Glaros, Alan G\n\n2013-08-01\n\nObstetric providers are logical choices for conveying information about physical activity to their pregnant patients. However, research regarding obstetric providers counseling pregnant patients about physical activity is sparse. To investigate the association between obstetric providers discussing exercise with their pregnant patients and patients' exercise behaviors and to explore factors related to obstetric providers discussing exercise and other health behaviors (tobacco use, alcohol use, and nutrition) with their patients. We received completed surveys from 238 pregnant women and 31 obstetric providers at 12 obstetrician offices. The offices were located throughout the United States and were heterogeneous in regards to patient insurance coverage, number of patients treated per month, and percentage of patients with complications. Women who were \"more careful about eating healthy\" (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-8.0) and who discussed exercise with their obstetric provider (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.3) were more likely to \"maintain or increase exercise\" during pregnancy than those who were not conscientious about their diets and those who did not discuss exercise with their obstetric provider, respectively. The odds of obstetric providers discussing exercise with pregnant patients increased 7-fold (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 1.4-37.3) for each health behavior the obstetric provider discussed with the patient. Patient discussions with obstetric providers about exercise and patient attention to eating habits are associated with exercising during pregnancy. A more multibehavioral approach by obstetric providers may improve the likelihood that patients exercise during pregnancy.\n\nComposite redesign of obstetrical forceps\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLawson, Seth W.; Smeltzer, Stan S.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nDue to the increase in the number of children being born recently, medical technology has struggled to keep pace in certain areas. In these areas, particular needs have arisen to which the subject of this paper is directed. In the area of obstetrics, the forceps design and function has remained relatively unchanged for a number of years. In an effort to advance the technology, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center has been asked by the obstetrical community to help in a redesign of the obstetric forceps. Traditionally the forceps design has been of tubular stainless steel, constructed in two halves which interlock and hinge to provide the gripping force necessary to aid in the delivery of an infant. The stainless steel material was used to provide for ease of cleaning and sterilization. However, one of the drawbacks of the non-flexible steel design is that excessive force can be placed upon an infants head which could result in damage or injury to the infant. The redesign of this particular obstetric tool involves applying NASA's knowledge of advanced materials and state of the art instrumentation to create a tool which can be used freely throughout the obstetrics community without the fear of injury to an infant being delivered.\n\n21 CFR 884.5100 - Obstetric anesthesia set.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2011-04-01 2011-04-01 false Obstetric anesthesia set. 884.5100 Section 884...

Therefore, we aimed to (1) test the feasibility of a proposed questionnaire for assessment of migrant status in epidemiological research and (2) assess some important associations between procedures and outcomes in obstetrics and migration in selected departments in Austria. We adapted a standardized questionnaire to the main immigration groups in Austria. Information on country of origin, length of residence in Austria and German-language ability was collected from eight selected obstetrics departments. Of the 1,971 questionnaires, 1,873 questionnaires of singleton births were selected and included in the analysis. We analyzed a total of 1,873 parturients with singleton births, of which 35 % had migrant status, 12 % were from ex-Yugoslavia, 12 % were from Turkey, and 12 % were from other countries. The proportion of parturients having their first care visit after the 12th week of pregnancy was higher in migrant groups (19 %). Smoking was highest in the migrants from ex-Yugoslavia (21 %). Vaginal delivery was more frequent in migrants from ex-Yugoslavia (78 %) and Turkey (83 %) than in nonmigrants (71 %) and episiotomy was more frequently performed in migrants from other countries. All differences are statistically significant. Administration of a standardized questionnaire for assessment of migrant status in obstetric departments in Austria was shown to be feasible. We assessed differences in obstetric care and outcome and consequently recommend that action should be initiated in Austria toward harmonizing obstetric procedures among the migrant and the nonmigrant groups and toward minimizing risk factors.\n\nIs personalized medicine achievable in obstetrics?\n\nPubMed\n\nQuinney, Sara K; Patil, Avinash S; Flockhart, David A\n\n2014-12-01\n\nPersonalized medicine seeks to identify the right dose of the right drug for the right patient at the right time.

A total of 22 French obstetric experts in court reviewed 30 cases of term deliveries of singleton pregnancies diagnosed with at least 1 hour of abnormal fetal heart rate, including 10 cases with adverse neonatal outcome. The experts reviewed all cases twice within a 3-month interval, with the first review being blinded to neonatal outcome. For each case reviewed, the experts were provided with the obstetric data and copies of the complete fetal heart rate recording and the partogram. The experts were asked to classify the abnormal fetal heart rate tracing and to express whether they agreed with the obstetrical management performed. When they disagreed, the experts were asked whether they concluded that an error had been made and whether they considered the obstetrical management as the cause of cerebral palsy in children if any. Compared with blinded review, the experts were significantly more likely to agree with the obstetric management performed (P < .001) and with the mode of delivery (P < .001) when informed about the neonatal outcome and were less likely to conclude that an error had been made (P < .001) or to establish a link with potential cerebral palsy (P = .003). The experts' intraobserver agreement for the review of abnormal fetal heart rate tracing and obstetrical management were both mediocre (kappa = 0.46-0.51 and kappa = 0.48-0.53, respectively). The interobserver agreement for the review of abnormal fetal heart rate tracing was low and was not improved by knowledge of the neonatal outcome (kappa = 0.11-0.18). The interobserver agreement for the interpretation of obstetrical management was also low (kappa = 0.08-0.19) but appeared to be improved by knowledge of the neonatal outcome\n\nA survey of Australasian obstetric anaesthesia audit.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, S J; Cyna, A M; Simmons, S W\n\n1999-08-01\n\nIn order to develop a minimal obstetric anaesthesia dataset based on current Australasian clinical audit best practice, we carried out a postal survey of 69 Australasian anaesthetic departments covering an obstetric service. We asked about data being collected, specifically concerning the high risk obstetric patient, epidural analgesia and postoperative anaesthetic review. Examples of any data collection forms were requested. Of the 66 responses, 35 departments (53%) were not collecting any audit data. Twenty-six of the 31 departments (84%) performing obstetric anaesthesia audit responded to our follow-up telephone survey. Eighteen departments believed that there had been an improvement in patient care as a result of their audit and 13 felt that the benefits outweighed the costs involved. However, only six departments (9%) had performed an audit cycle. The importance of feedback to patients or hospital staff and the incidence of post dural puncture headache (PDPH) were cited by some as priorities for obstetric anaesthesia audit. There was however no consistency as to what data should be collected. Many responses suggested a perceived need to collect clinical data without knowing what to do with it. Our survey has highlighted confusion between three distinct objectives; a dataset for obstetric anaesthesia record keeping, data required for continuing patient management in hospital and, a specific minimal dataset for clinical audit purposes. We conclude that current Australasian obstetric anaesthesia audit strategies are inadequate to develop a minimal dataset for cost-effective clinical audit.\n\nManagement of obstetric hemorrhage.\n\nPubMed\n\nShevell, Tracy; Malone, Fergal D\n\n2003-02-01\n\nA reluctance to proceed with hysterectomy for obstetric hemorrhage may be a more likely cause of preventable death in obstetrics than a lack of surgical or medical skills. Every obstetric unit should have protocols available to deal with hemorrhage and, in addition, have specific guidelines for patients who object to blood transfusions for various reasons. Risk factors for hemorrhage should be identified antenatally, using all possible imaging modalities available, and utilizing multidisciplinary resources whenever possible. Novel strategies for prenatal diagnosis of abnormal placentation include advanced sonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Placement and utilization of arterial catheters for uterine artery embolization is becoming more widespread and new surgical technology such as the argon beam coagulator seems promising. When intra or postpartum hemorrhage is encountered, a familiar protocol for dealing with blood loss should be triggered. Timely hysterectomy should be performed for signs of refractory bleeding. Application of medical and surgical principles combined with recent technologic advances will help the obstetrician avoid disastrous outcomes for both mother and fetus.\n\nObstetric training in Emergency Medicine: a needs assessment.\n\nPubMed\n\nJanicki, Adam James; MacKuen, Courteney; Hauspurg, Alisse; Cohn, Jamieson\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIdentification and management of obstetric emergencies is essential in emergency medicine (EM), but exposure to pregnant patients during EM residency training is frequently limited. To date, there is little data describing effective ways to teach residents this material. Current guidelines require completion of 2 weeks of obstetrics or 10 vaginal deliveries, but it is unclear whether this instills competency. We created a 15-item survey evaluating resident confidence and knowledge related to obstetric emergencies. To assess confidence, we asked residents about their exposure and comfort level regarding obstetric emergencies and eight common presentations and procedures. We assessed knowledge via multiple-choice questions addressing common obstetric presentations, pelvic ultrasound image, and cardiotocography interpretation. The survey was distributed to residency programs utilizing the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors (CORD) listserv. The survey was completed by 212 residents, representing 55 of 204 (27%) programs belonging to CORD and 11.2% of 1,896 eligible residents. Fifty-six percent felt they had adequate exposure to obstetric emergencies. The overall comfort level was 2.99 (1-5 scale) and comfort levels of specific presentations and procedures ranged from 2.58 to 3.97; all increased moderately with postgraduate year (PGY) level. Mean overall percentage of items answered correctly on the multiple-choice questions was 58% with no statistical difference by PGY level. Performance on individual questions did not differ by PGY level. The identification and management of obstetric emergencies is the cornerstone of EM. We found preliminary evidence of a concerning lack of resident comfort regarding obstetric conditions and knowledge deficits on core obstetrics topics. EM residents may benefit from educational interventions to increase exposure to these topics.\n\nRelevant Obstetric Factors for Cerebral Palsy: From the Nationwide Obstetric Compensation System in Japan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHasegawa, Junichi; Toyokawa, Satoshi; Ikenoue, Tsuyomu; Asano, Yuri; Satoh, Shoji; Ikeda, Tomoaki; Ichizuka, Kiyotake; Tamiya, Nanako; Nakai, Akihito; Fujimori, Keiya; Maeda, Tsugio; Masuzaki, Hideaki; Suzuki, Hideaki; Ueda, Shigeru\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective The aim of this study was to identify the relevant obstetric factors for cerebral palsy (CP) after 33 weeksâ gestation in Japan. Study design This retrospective case cohort study (1:100 cases and controls) used a Japanese national CP registry. Obstetric characteristics and clinical course were compared between CP cases in the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy database and controls in the perinatal database of the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology born as live singleton infants between 2009 and 2011 with a birth weight â¥ 2,000 g and gestation â¥ 33 weeks. Results One hundred and seventy-five CP cases and 17,475 controls were assessed. Major relevant single factors for CP were placental abnormalities (31%), umbilical cord abnormalities (15%), maternal complications (10%), and neonatal complications (1%). A multivariate regression model demonstrated that obstetric variables associated with CP were acute delivery due to non-reassuring fetal status (relative risk [RR]: 37.182, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.028â69.032), uterine rupture (RR: 24.770, 95% CI: 6.006â102.160), placental abruption (RR: 20.891, 95% CI: 11.817â36.934), and preterm labor (RR: 3.153, 95% CI: 2.024â4.911), whereas protective factors were head presentation (RR: 0.199, 95% CI: 0.088â0.450) and elective cesarean section (RR: 0.236, 95% CI: 0.067â0.828). Conclusion CP after 33 weeksâ gestation in the recently reported cases in Japan was strongly associated with acute delivery due to non-reassuring fetal status, uterine rupture, and placental abruption.

This included antenatal checks, normal delivery and Caesarean section. This study aims at assessing the changes in coverage of obstetric care according to the Unmet Obstetric Need concept before (2008) and after (2012) the implementation of the free emergency obstetric care policy in a rural health district in Guinea. We carried out a descriptive cross-sectional study involving the retrospective review of routine programme data during the period April to June 2014. No statistical difference was observed in women's sociodemographic characteristics and indications (absolute maternal indications versus non-absolute maternal indications) before and after the implementation of the policy. Compared to referrals from health centers of patients, direct admissions at hospital significantly increased from 49% to 66% between 2008 and 2012 (p = 0.001). In rural areas, this increase concerned all maternal complications regardless of their severity, while in urban areas it mainly affected very severe complications. Compared to 2008, there were significantly more Major Obstetric Interventions for Maternal Absolute Indications in 2012 (p < 0.001). Maternal deaths decreased between 2008 and 2012 from 1.5% to 1.1% while neonatal death increased from 12% in 2008 to 15% in 2012. The implementation of the free obstetric care policy led to a significant decrease in unmet obstetric need between 2008 and 2012 in the health district of Kissidougou. However, more research is needed to allow comparisons with other health districts in the country and to analyse the trends.\n\nThe Current Status and Future of Academic Obstetrics.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBowers, John Z., Ed.; Purcell, Elizabeth F., Ed.\n\nThe state of research in academic obstetrics and its relationship to research in other academic disciplines was addressed in a 1979 conference.

DESIGN: Qualitative study. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: A purposefully selected sample of nine female family physicians who met the criteria of being married, having children and currently practising obstetrics. OUTCOME MEASURES: Experiences of female family physicians and their strategies in their personal, family and professional lives that enable them to continue practising obstetrics. RESULTS: All participants continued to practise obstetrics because of the pleasure they derived from it, despite the challenges of balancing the unpredictable demands of obstetrics with their personal and family needs. To continue in obstetrics, they needed to make changes in their lives, either through a gradual, evolutionary process or in response to a critical event. Alterations to work and family arrangements permitted them to meet the challenges and led to increased satisfaction. Changes included making supportive call-group arrangements, limiting work hours and the number of births attended and securing help with household duties. CONCLUSIONS: An in-depth examination, through the use of qualitative methods, showed the reasons why some female family physicians continue to practise obstetrics despite the stressful aspects of doing so. This knowledge may be useful for women who are residents or experienced clinicians and who are considering including obstetrics in their practice.

Methods This was a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study of 151 obstetricians and gynecologists that attended the 46th Annual General Meeting and Scientific Conference of the Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria (SOGON) held in Abakaliki, southeast Nigeria in November, 2012. SOGON is the umbrella body that oversees the obstetric and gynecological practice in Nigeria. Data was collated and analyzed with Epi-info statistical software, and conclusions were drawn by means of simple percentages and inferential statistics using Odds Ratio, with P-valueâ<â0.05 at 95% Confidence Interval (CI) taken to be statistically significant. Results Of the 151 participants, males predominated; 110 (72.9%) practiced in government-owned tertiary hospitals in urban locations. Only 74 (49%) offered obstetric analgesia. Among users, only 20 (13.3%) offered obstetric analgesia routinely to parturients, 44 (29.1%) sometimes and 10 (6.6%) on patientsâ requests. The commonest analgesia was opioids (41.1%). Among non-users, the commonest reasons adduced were fear of respiratory distress (31.1%), cost (24.7%) and late presentation in labour (15.6%). Conclusion The routine prescription and utilization of obstetric analgesia by obstetricians in Nigeria is still low. Obstetricians are encouraged to step up its use to make childbirth a more fulfilling experience for parturients.

The economic benefit of those rural family physicians practicing obstetrics has not been studied. This study was designed to determine whether there was any added economic benefit of rural family physicians practicing obstetrics in rural, underserved Alabama. The Alabama Family Practice Rural Health Board has funded the University of Alabama Family Medicine Obstetrics Fellowship since its beginning in 1986. Family medicine obstetrics fellowship graduates who practice obstetrics in rural, underserved areas were sent questionnaires and asked to participate in the study. The questions included the most common types and average annual numbers of obstetrics/gynecological procedures they performed. Ten physicians, or 77% of the graduates asked to participate in the study, returned the questionnaire. Fourteen common obstetrics/gynecological procedures performed by the graduates were identified. A mean of 115 deliveries were performed. The full-time equivalent reduction in family medicine time to practice obstetrics was 20%. A family physician practicing obstetrics in a rural area adds an additional $488,560 in economic benefit to the community in addition to the $1,000,000 from practicing family medicine, producing a total annual benefit of $1,488,560. The investment of $616,385 from the Alabama Family Practice Rural Health Board resulted in a $399 benefit to the community for every dollar invested. The cumulative effect of fellowship graduates practicing both family medicine and obstetrics in rural, underserved areas over the 26 years studied was $246,047,120.

The aim of this study is to analyse selected parameters of obstetric relevance in the phases pregnancy, birth and postpartum period in dependence on the gender of the foetus. Materials and Methods: The selected study method comprised a retrospective data acquisition and evaluation from the Austrian birth register of the Department of Clinical Epidemiology of Tyrolean State Hospitals. For the analysis all inpatient singleton deliveries in Austria during the period from 2008 to 2013 were taken into account (live and stillbirths nâ=â444â685). The gender of the baby was correlated with previously defined, obstetrically relevant parameters. Results: In proportions, significantly more premature births and sub partu medical interventions (vaginal and abdominal surgical deliveries. episiotomies) were observed for male foetuses (pâ<â0.001). The neonatal outcome (5-min Apgar score, umbilical pH value less than 7.1, transfer to a neonatal special unit) is significantly poorer for boys (pâ<â0.001). Discussion: In view of the vulnerability of male foetuses and infants, further research is needed in order to be able to react appropriately to the differing gender-specific requirements in obstetrics.

It has been associated with lack of empathy and emotional discomfort of physicians. To identify the perceptions of obstetric violence and to determine the possible relationship with burnout syndrome. We evaluated 29 physicians whose scope of work relates to obstetrics and gynecology. The evaluation instruments were: a) questionnaire on professional perception that collects demographic information, situations of perceived obstetric violence, major concerns of physicians in their professional work, and includes an scale about level of job satisfaction, b) the Maslach Burnout inventory, and c) Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy. The most prevalent obstetric violence situations perceived were: medical malpractice and harmful practices (10/29), discrimination (10/29), rude treatment and verbal attacks (11/29). Seventeen participants reported lack of information on obstetric violence and not have tools to cope with this problem. Regarding the burnout syndrome, it was associated with several items of the scale of empathy and with the scale of job satisfaction. This study shows the importance of providing knowledge and tools to deal with obstetric violence and stress management to prevent such situations on medical practices.\n\nTreatment-seeking behaviour and social status of women with pelvic organ prolapse, 4th-degree obstetric tears, and obstetric fistula in western Uganda.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrause, Hannah G; Natukunda, Harriet; Singasi, Isaac; Hicks, Sylvia S W; Goh, Judith T W\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThis study looks at a trilogy of women's health issues including severe pelvic organ prolapse, unrepaired 4th degree obstetric tears and obstetric fistula, all of which can cause significant suffering in the lives of women and their families. Women undergoing surgery for severe pelvic organ prolapse, unrepaired 4th degree obstetric tears and obstetric fistulae, were interviewed to assess their perceptions of what caused their condition, subsequent impact on their social situation and sexual activity, and whether they had sought treatment previously. One hundred fifty women participated in the survey, including 69 undergoing surgery for genito-urinary fistula, 25 with faecal incontinence only (including 24 women with unrepaired 4th degree obstetric tears and 1 woman with an isolated rectovaginal fistula), and 56 women with severe pelvic organ prolapse. All groups of women were exposed to abandonment by their families with 42 % of women with genito-urinary fistula, 21 % with unrepaired 4th degree obstetric tear, and 25 % of women with severe pelvic organ prolapse rejected by their husbands. Most of the women had actively sought treatment for their condition with no success due to unavailability of treatment or misinformation. This study confirms the social stigma associated with obstetric fistula, however also highlights the social stigma faced by women suffering with severe pelvic organ prolapse and unrepaired 4th degree obstetric tears in western Uganda. There is an urgent need for education and training in obstetric management and pelvic organ prolapse management in such areas of limited resources.\n\nObstetric team simulation program challenges.\n\nPubMed\n\nBullough, A S; Wagner, S; Boland, T; Waters, T P; Kim, K; Adams, W\n\n2016-12-01\n\nTo describe the challenges associated with the development and assessment of an obstetric emergency team simulation program. The goal was to develop a hybrid, in-situ and high fidelity obstetric emergency team simulation program that incorporated weekly simulation sessions on the labor and delivery unit, and quarterly, education protected sessions in the simulation center. All simulation sessions were video-recorded and reviewed. Labor and delivery unit and simulation center. Medical staff covering labor and delivery, anesthesiology and obstetric residents and obstetric nurses. Assessments included an on-line knowledge multiple-choice questionnaire about the simulation scenarios. This was completed prior to the initial in-situ simulation session and repeated 3 months later, the Clinical Teamwork Scale with inter-rater reliability, participant confidence surveys and subjective participant satisfaction. A web-based curriculum comprising modules on communication skills, team challenges, and team obstetric emergency scenarios was also developed. Over 4 months, only 6 labor and delivery unit in-situ sessions out of a possible 14 sessions were carried out. Four high-fidelity sessions were performed in 2 quarterly education protected meetings in the simulation center. Information technology difficulties led to the completion of only 18 pre/post web-based multiple-choice questionnaires. These test results showed no significant improvement in raw score performance from pre-test to post-test (P=.27). During Clinical Teamwork Scale live and video assessment, trained raters and program faculty were in agreement only 31% and 28% of the time, respectively (Kendall's W=.31, P<.001 and W=.28, P<.001). Participant confidence surveys overall revealed confidence significantly increased (P<.05), from pre-scenario briefing to after post-scenario debriefing. Program feedback indicates a high level of participant satisfaction and improved confidence yet further program refinement is\n\nA multicenter study on the appropriateness of hospitalization in obstetric wards: application of Obstetric Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (Obstetric AEP).\n\nPubMed\n\nMannocci, Alice; Specchia, Maria Lucia; Poppa, Giuseppina; Boccia, Giovanni; Cavallo, Pierpaolo; De Caro, Francesco; Vetrano, Giuseppe; Aleandri, Vincenzo; Capunzo, Mario; Ricciardi, Walter; Boccia, Antonio; Firenze, Alberto; Malvasi, Antonio; La Torre, Giuseppe\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe cross-sectional study has been based on the implementation of the Obstetric Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (OAEP) in seven hospitals to determine inappropriate hospital admissions and days of stay. The outcomes were: inappropriateness of admission and \"percentage of inappropriateness\" for one hospitalization. A total number of 2196 clinical records were reviewed. The mean percentage of inappropriateness for hospitalization was 22%. The percentage of inappropriateness for the first 10âd of hospitalization peaked in correspondence of the fourth (42%). The logistic regression model on inappropriated admission reported that emergency admission was a protective factor (ORâ=â0.4) and to be hospitalized in wards with â¥30 beds risk factor (ORâ=â5.12). The second linear model on \"percentage of inappropriateness\" showed that inappropriated admission and wards with â¥30 beds increased the percentage (pâ<â0.001); whereas the admission in Teaching Hospitals was inversely associated (pâ<â0.001). The present study suggests that the percentage of inappropriate admission depends especially on the inappropriate admission and the large number of beds in obstetric wards. This probably indicates that management of big hospitals, which is very complex, needs improving the processes of support and coordination of health professionals. The OAEP tool seems to be an useful instrument for the decision-makers to monitor and manage the obstetric wards.\n\nEmergency preparedness in obstetrics.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaeri, Sina; Marcozzi, David\n\n2015-04-01\n\nDuring and after disasters, focus is directed toward meeting the immediate needs of the general population. As a result, the routine health care and the special needs of some vulnerable populations such as pregnant and postpartum women may be overlooked within a resource-limited setting. In the event of hazards such as natural disasters, manmade disasters, and terrorism, knowledge of emergency preparedness strategies is imperative for the pregnant woman and her family, obstetric providers, and hospitals. Individualized plans for the pregnant woman and her family should include knowledge of shelter in place, birth at home, and evacuation. Obstetric providers need to have a personal disaster plan in place that accounts for work responsibilities in case of an emergency and business continuity strategies to continue to provide care to their communities. Hospitals should have a comprehensive emergency preparedness program utilizing an \"all hazards\" approach to meet the needs of pregnant and postpartum women and other vulnerable populations during disasters. With lessons learned in recent tragedies such as Hurricane Katrina in mind, we hope this review will stimulate emergency preparedness discussions and actions among obstetric providers and attenuate adverse outcomes related to catastrophes in the future.\n\nObstetric fistulae in West Africa: patient perspectives.\n\nPubMed\n\nNathan, Lisa M; Rochat, Charles H; Grigorescu, Bogdan; Banks, Erika\n\n2009-05-01\n\nThe objective of this study is to gain insight into the nature of obstetric fistulae in Africa through patient perspectives. At l'HÃ´pital Saint Jean de Dieu in Tanguieta, Benin, 37 fistula patients underwent structured interviews about fistula cause, obstacles to medical care, prevention, and reintegration by 2 physicians via interpreters. The majority of participants (43%) thought their fistulae were a result of trauma from the operative delivery. Lack of financial resources (49%) was the most commonly reported obstacle to care, and prenatal care (38%) was most frequently reported as an intervention that may prevent obstetric fistulae. The majority (49%) of the participants requested no further reintegration assistance aside from surgery. Accessible emergency obstetric care is necessary to decrease the burden of obstetric fistulae in Africa. This may be accomplished through increased and improved health care facilities and education of providers and patients.\n\nObstetric acute renal failure 1956-1987.\n\nPubMed\n\nTurney, J H; Ellis, C M; Parsons, F M\n\n1989-06-01\n\nA total of 142 women with severe acute renal failure (ARF) resulting from obstetric causes was treated by dialysis at a single centre from 1956 to 1987. One-year survival was 78.6%, which compares favourably with other causes of ARF. Abortion, haemorrhage and preclampsia comprised 95% of cases, with survival being best (82.9%) with abortion. Survival was adversely affected by increasing age. Acute cortical necrosis (12.7% of patients) carried 100% mortality after 6 years. Follow-up of survivors showed normal renal function up to 31 years following ARF; 25-year patient survival was 71.6%. Improvements in obstetric care and the disappearance of illegal abortions have resulted in a dramatic decline in the incidence of obstetric ARF.\n\n[The evolution of vacuum extraction in obstetrics].\n\nPubMed\n\nNikolov, A\n\n2010-01-01\n\nVacuum extraction is one of the methods for assisted vaginal delivery. In this article the evolution of vacuum extraction in obstetrics is been discussed.

A narrative review was conducted of documents from the World Health Organization and the International Confederation of Midwives. The search used the descriptors midwifery and education. All official reports that guide midwife education policies, published from 2009 to 2015 in English and Spanish, and available online, were included. Reports that did not specifically refer to training were excluded. Five reports were selected. Analysis and synthesis of their respective objectives and contents were based on three themes: requirements for professional qualification, continuing education, and guidelines for skilled training in obstetrics, taking into account accepted core competencies for this specialty. Analysis of reports related to training in obstetrics identified that key tasks are being implemented for both educators and midwives. The reports represent a solid basis to develop educational policies that can contribute to universal access and coverage in health and to reducing maternal and neonatal mortality, and potentially can be used to guide international policies.\n\nSimulation Training in Obstetrics and Gynaecology Residency Programs in Canada.\n\nPubMed\n\nSanders, Ari; Wilson, R Douglas\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThe integration of simulation into residency programs has been slower in obstetrics and gynaecology than in other surgical specialties. The goal of this study was to evaluate the current use of simulation in obstetrics and gynaecology residency programs in Canada. A 19-question survey was developed and distributed to all 16 active and accredited obstetrics and gynaecology residency programs in Canada. The survey was sent to program directors initially, but on occasion was redirected to other faculty members involved in resident education or to senior residents. Survey responses were collected over an 18-month period. Twelve programs responded to the survey (11 complete responses). Eleven programs (92%) reported introducing an obstetrics and gynaecology simulation curriculum into their residency education. All respondents (100%) had access to a simulation centre. Simulation was used to teach various obstetrical and gynaecological skills using different simulation modalities. Barriers to simulation integration were primarily the costs of equipment and space and the need to ensure dedicated time for residents and educators. The majority of programs indicated that it was a priority for them to enhance their simulation curriculum and transition to competency-based resident assessment. Simulation training has increased in obstetrics and gynaecology residency programs. The development of formal simulation curricula for use in obstetrics and gynaecology resident education is in early development. A standardized national simulation curriculum would help facilitate the integration of simulation into obstetrics and gynaecology resident education and aid in the shift to competency-based resident assessment. Obstetrics and gynaecology residency programs need national collaboration (between centres and specialties) to develop a standardized simulation curriculum for use in obstetrics and gynaecology residency programs in Canada.\n\nExperiences of family physicians who practise primary care obstetrics in groups.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoppula, Sudha; Brown, Judith B; Jordan, John M\n\n2011-02-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of family physicians in primary care obstetrical groups. Using a qualitative approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 Edmonton family physicians who participated in primary care obstetrical groups. Experiences with respect to several aspects of group obstetrical practice were examined including advantages and challenges of primary care obstetrical groups, provision of patient care by a group, fit with other work commitments, and sustainability of the groups. Study data were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Independent and team analysis was iterative and interpretive. Primary care obstetrical groups were found to preserve a family physician's enjoyment of obstetrics and allowed for continuity of care. They afforded work-life balance, allowed for collaboration, and provided support and a social network for group members. Such groups were found to facilitate short-term family physician absences, although long-term absences (such as maternity leaves) were considered challenging. Participants described conflict within primary care obstetrical groups and considered sustainability to be a challenge. Family physicians' continued involvement in obstetrics could be facilitated by their participation in primary care obstetrical groups.\n\nSimulation laboratories for training in obstetrics and gynecology.\n\nPubMed\n\nMacedonia, Christian R; Gherman, Robert B; Satin, Andrew J\n\n2003-08-01\n\nSimulations have been used by the military, airline industry, and our colleagues in other medical specialties to educate, evaluate, and prepare for rare but life-threatening scenarios. Work hour limits for residents in obstetrics and gynecology and decreased patient availability for teaching of students and residents require us to think creatively and practically on how to optimize their education. Medical simulations may address scenarios in clinical practice that are considered important to know or understand. Simulations can take many forms, including computer programs, models or mannequins, virtual reality data immersion caves, and a combination of formats. The purpose of this commentary is to call attention to a potential role for medical simulation in obstetrics and gynecology. We briefly describe an example of how simulation may be incorporated into obstetric and gynecologic residency training. It is our contention that educators in obstetrics and gynecology should be aware of the potential for simulation in education. We hope this commentary will stimulate interest in the field, lead to validation studies, and improve training in and the practice of obstetrics and gynecology.\n\nCurrent applications of big data in obstetric anesthesiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nKlumpner, Thomas T; Bauer, Melissa E; Kheterpal, Sachin\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe narrative review aims to highlight several recently published 'big data' studies pertinent to the field of obstetric anesthesiology. Big data has been used to study rare outcomes, to identify trends within the healthcare system, to identify variations in practice patterns, and to highlight potential inequalities in obstetric anesthesia care. Big data studies have helped define the risk of rare complications of obstetric anesthesia, such as the risk of neuraxial hematoma in thrombocytopenic parturients. Also, large national databases have been used to better understand trends in anesthesia-related adverse events during cesarean delivery as well as outline potential racial/ethnic disparities in obstetric anesthesia care. Finally, real-time analysis of patient data across a number of disparate health information systems through the use of sophisticated clinical decision support and surveillance systems is one promising application of big data technology on the labor and delivery unit. 'Big data' research has important implications for obstetric anesthesia care and warrants continued study. Real-time electronic surveillance is a potentially useful application of big data technology on the labor and delivery unit.\n\nBarriers to emergency obstetric care services: accounts of survivors of life threatening obstetric complications in Malindi District, Kenya.\n\nPubMed\n\nEchoka, Elizabeth; Makokha, Anselimo; Dubourg, Dominique; Kombe, Yeri; Nyandieka, Lillian; Byskov, Jens\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPregnancy-related mortality and morbidity in most low and middle income countries can be reduced through early recognition of complications, prompt access to care and appropriate medical interventions following obstetric emergencies. We used the three delays framework to explore barriers to emergency obstetric care (EmOC) services by women who experienced life threatening obstetric complications in Malindi District, Kenya. A facility-based qualitative study was conducted between November and December 2010. In-depth interviews were conducted with 30 women who experienced obstetric \"near miss\" at the only public hospital with capacity to provide comprehensive EmOC services in the district. Findings indicate that pregnant women experienced delays in making decision to seek care and in reaching an appropriate care facility. The \"first\" delay was due to lack of birth preparedness, including failure to identify a health facility for delivery services regardless of antenatal care and to seek care promptly despite recognition of danger signs. The \"second\" delay was influenced by long distance and inconvenient transport to hospital. These two delays resulted in some women arriving at the hospital too late to save the life of the unborn baby. Delays in making the decision to seek care when obstetric complications occur, combined with delays in reaching the hospital, contribute to ineffective treatment upon arrival at the hospital. Interventions to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity must adequately consider the pre-hospital challenges faced by pregnant women in order to influence decision making towards addressing the three delays.\n\nAuditing the standard of anaesthesia care in obstetric units.\n\nPubMed\n\nMÃ¶rch-Siddall, J; Corbitt, N; Bryson, M R\n\n2001-04-01\n\nWe undertook an audit of 15 obstetric units in the north of England over a 10-month period to ascertain to what extent they conformed to the Obstetric Anaesthetists' Association 'Recommended Minimum Standards for Obstetric Anaesthetic Services' using a quality assurance approach. We demonstrated that all units conformed to the majority of standards but did not conform in at least one major and minor area.\n\n[The emergence of obstetrical mechanism: From Lucy to Homo sapiens].\n\nPubMed\n\nFrÃ©mondiÃ¨re, P; Thollon, L; Marchal, F\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe evolutionary history of modern birth mechanism is now a renewed interest in obstetrical papers. The purpose of this work is to review the literature in paleo-obstetrical field. Our analysis focuses on paleo-obstetrical hypothesis, from 1960Â to the present day, based on the reconstruction of fossil pelvis. Indeed, these pelvic reconstructions usually provide an opportunity to make an obstetrical assumption in our ancestors. In this analysis, we show that modern birth mechanism takes place during the emergence of our genus 2Â million years ago. References are made to human specificities related to obstetrical mechanism: exclusive bipedalism, increase of brain size at birth, metabolic cost of the pregnancy and deep trophoblastic implantation.

We prefer to consider it as a procedure that involves on one side the woman, the child and its family, and on the other the services entitled to give pre- and post-natal assistance. In order to realize this, a reformation of our methodological parameters and a critical analysis of the results obtained are required. In the courses of obstetric psychoprophylaxis that are held in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the University of Padua we take into consideration the following themes: - Methodological approach - Professional training of the staff - Significance of psychosocial culture in the management of the pregnancy by the health services.\n\nPathology Consultation on Viscoelastic Studies of Coagulopathic Obstetrical Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nGehrie, Eric A; Baine, Ian; Booth, Garrett S\n\n2016-08-01\n\nIn obstetrics, the decision to transfuse blood components has historically been driven by traditional laboratory testing in combination with direct observation of bleeding. The adjunctive use of viscoelastic testing, including thromboelastometry and thromboelastography, has gained increasing acceptance in the clinical domain. We performed a review of the published medical literature by searching the PUBMED database for keywords \"viscoelastic\" and \"obstetric,\" as well as \"viscoelastic\" and \"postpartum hemorrhage.\" Additionally, case reports and expert opinion publications that referenced viscoelastic studies in obstetrical patients were evaluated. There is very little high-quality evidence currently published in the medical literature to support the notion that viscoelastic testing obviates the need for traditional coagulation testing or improves mortality resulting from major obstetrical hemorrhage. Additional research is needed to further focus the optimum role of viscoelastic tests in major obstetrical hemorrhage. Â© American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2016. All rights reserved.

Emphasis on cost containment while preserving high quality has driven the redesign of healthcare delivery. A number of models for providing effective and less expensive obstetric care are now being examined in the USA and abroad. Increased market penetration by managed care will also exert profound and possibly harmful effects on traditional academic teaching institutions. These organizations must adapt to this new environment or face the erosion of physician support and training bases. Ultimately, significant moral and ethical dilemmas will arise when patients' best interests for care are being continually brought into conflict with the physician's need to earn a living.\n\nCurrent obstetrical practice and umbilical cord prolapse.\n\nPubMed\n\nUsta, I M; Mercer, B M; Sibai, B M\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess the contribution of current obstetrical practice to the occurrence and complications of umbilical cord prolapse. Maternal and neonatal charts of 87 pregnancies complicated by true umbilical cord prolapse during a 5-year period were reviewed. Twin gestation and noncephalic presentations were common features (14 and 41%, respectively). Eighty-nine percent (77) of infants were delivered by cesarean section of which 29% were classical and 88% were primary. The mean gestational age at delivery was 34.0 +/- 6.0 weeks, and the mean birth weight was 2318 +/- 1159 g. Obstetrical intervention preceded 41 (47%) cases (the obstetrical intervention group): amniotomy (9), scalp electrode application (4), intrauterine pressure catheter insertion (6), attempted external cephalic version (7), expectant management of preterm premature rupture of membranes (14), manual rotation of the fetal head (1), and amnioreduction (1). There were 11 perinatal deaths. Thirty-three percent of the infants (32) had a 5-min Apgar score < 7 and 34% had a cord pH < 7.20. Neonatal seizures, intracerebral hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, hyaline membrane disease, persistent fetal circulation, sepsis, assisted ventilation, and perinatal mortality were comparable in the \"obstetrical intervention\" and \"no-intervention\" groups. Most of the neonatal complications occurred in infants < 32 weeks' gestation. We conclude that obstetrical intervention contributes to 47% of umbilical cord prolapse cases; however, it does not increase the associated perinatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nRecurrence of obstetric third-degree and fourth-degree anal sphincter injuries.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoggs, Edgar W; Berger, Howard; Urquia, Marcelo; McDermott, Colleen D\n\n2014-12-01\n\nTo examine outcomes after primary obstetric anal sphincter injuries in a subsequent pregnancy. This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collated data from a large perinatal database between 2006 and 2010. Primiparous vaginal deliveries with an obstetric anal sphincter injury were identified and tracked to identify their subsequent delivery characteristics and perineal outcomes. A primary obstetric anal sphincter injury occurred in 5.3% of primiparous vaginal deliveries (9,857/186,239); of those patients, 2,093 had a subsequent delivery, and 91.9% delivered vaginally (1,923/2,093). The recurrent obstetric anal sphincter injury rate was also found to be 5.3% (102/1,923). The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for primary obstetric anal sphincter injuries were significantly increased in large-for-gestational-age neonates for both third-degree laceration (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-2.2) and fourth-degree laceration (adjusted OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.3-3.1) and almost all obstetric interventions studied. The adjusted ORs for recurrent obstetric anal sphincter injuries were significant for large-for-gestational-age (25/102, adjusted OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.6) and instrumental deliveries (15/102, adjusted OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.6). In this study population, the incidence of recurrent obstetric anal sphincter injuries was similar to that of primary obstetric anal sphincter injuries, and most patients went on to deliver vaginally for subsequent deliveries. The risk of recurrent obstetric anal sphincter injuries was doubled in those who delivered a large-for-gestational-age neonate and in those who had an instrumental delivery.\n\nRole of telephone triage in obstetrics.\n\nPubMed\n\nManning, Nirvana Afsordeh; Magann, Everett F; Rhoads, Sarah J; Ivey, Tesa L; Williams, Donna J\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe telephone has become an indispensable method of communication in the practice of obstetrics. The telephone is one of the primary methods by which the patient makes her appointments and contacts her health care provider for advice, reassurance, and referrals. Current methods of telephone triage include personal at the physicians' office, telephone answering services, labor and delivery nurses, and a dedicated telephone triage system using algorithms. Limitations of telephone triage include the inability of the provider to see the patient and receive visual clues from the interaction and the challenges of obtaining a complete history over the telephone. In addition, there are potential safety and legal issues with telephone triage. To date, there is insufficient evidence to either validate or refute the use of a dedicated telephone triage system compared with a traditional system using an answering service or nurses on labor and delivery. Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians. After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to analyze the scope of variation in telephone triage across health care providers and categorize the components that go into a successful triage system, assess the current scope of research in telephone triage in obstetrics, evaluate potential safety and legal issues with telephone triage in obstetrics, and identify issues that should be addressed in any institution that is using or implementing a system of telephone triage in obstetrics.\n\n21 CFR 884.4900 - Obstetric table and accessories.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-04-01\n\n...

Though access to medical care is considered to be life-saving during obstetric emergencies, data on the factors associated with health care decision-making during obstetric emergencies are lacking. We aim to describe the health care decision-making process during severe acute obstetric complications among women and their families in rural Bangladesh. Methods Using the pregnancy surveillance infrastructure from a large community trial in northwest rural Bangladesh, we nested a qualitative study to document barriers to timely receipt of medical care for severe obstetric complications. We conducted 40 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with women reporting severe acute obstetric complications and purposively selected for conditions representing the top five most common obstetric complications. The interviews were transcribed and coded to highlight common themes and to develop an overall conceptual model. Results Women attributed their life-threatening experiences to societal and socioeconomic factors that led to delays in seeking timely medical care by decision makers, usually husbands or other male relatives. Despite the dominance of male relatives and husbands in the decision-making process, women who underwent induced abortions made their own decisions about their health care and relied on female relatives for advice. The study shows that non-certified providers such as village doctors and untrained birth attendants were the first-line providers for women in all categories of severe complications.

Swami Rama Nagar, Dehradun. A total of 120 patients of ASA I & II obstetric & non-obstetric undergoing elective/emergency surgery under subarachnoid block were included under the study. To evaluate the frequency of PDPH during spinal anaesthesia using 27 gauge Quincke vs 27G whitacre needle in obstetric/non obstetric patient. In our study patients were in the age group of 15-75 years. Most of the patients in our study belong to ASA Grade I. There was 2%, 1%, 4% and 3% hypotension in-group A, B, C, D respectively. There was 2%, 4% shivering in-group A, C respectively and 1% each in group B, D. In our study failed spinal with 27G Quincke needle was in one case (3.33%) in-group C where successful subarachnoid was performed with a thicken spinal needle 23G Quincke.

In maternity of Xinxiang Central Hospital, the total number of deliveries cases has been up to 50,526 in 20 years, of which 48 cases were retrospectively analyzed for the clinical data of Emergency uterine surgery cases. Cases underwent obstetric emergency hysterectomy accounted for 0.095% of total deliveries (48/50 526), in which 11 cases of vaginal delivery, 37 cases of cesarean section. The indications for surgery: 27 cases were cased by placental factors accounted for 56.25%; 14 cases of uterine inertia, accounting for 29.17%; uterine rupture in 4 cases, accounting for 8.33%; 3 cases of coagulopathy, accounting for 6.25%. Where the maternal placental factors hysterectomy is the most common (69.70%, 23/33) and the predominant factor is early maternal uterine inertia (60.00%, 9/15). There are 74.09% (20/27) of patients with placental abnormalities history of previous cesarean section or uterine surgery. The major risk factors leading to obstetric emergency hysterectomy is placental factors. Preventing the occurrence of placental abnormalities planting actively can effectively reduce the rate of obstetric hysterectomy.\n\nThe 2013 Gerard W.

This study was carried out to identify women with potential risk for this event and to prevent this obstetric problem. The most frequent indications for hysterectomy were identified, as well as the sociodemographic characteristic of the patients. The surgical procedure carried out was extra-fascial technique with type Richardson hysterectomy modified; the surgical pieces went to the pathology service, to obtain the histopathological diagnosis. 43 cases of obstetric hysterectomy, were analyzed; the characteristics of this group showed that bigger percentage of this event was more frequent in 31 to 35 years (39.5%), with pregnancies at term (51.1%) in third pregnancies(27.9%), nulliparas (60.4%), with first cesarean section (39.5%), without previous abortions (79.0%). The most frequent obstetric complications were uterine atony and placenta accreta. The cause for uterine atony could be interstitial edema, as well as myometrial hypertrophy, because such histopathological diagnoses were the most common. Odds ratio showed that a patient with cesarean section has 1.16 more probabilities of suffering hysterectomy than a woman with childbirth. This study describes the histological presence of interstitial edema and myometrial hypertrophy as possible causes of uterine atony in the histological study of surgical specimen. This could be related to no response of myometrial to the uterus-tonic effect of oxytocin. Obstetric uterine dysfunction has multifactorial cause. Patients with the characteristics described in this study should be considered as high risk.\n\nObstetrical referrals by traditional birth attendants.\n\nPubMed\n\nMustafa, Rozina; Hashmi, Haleema; Mustafa, Rubina\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn Pakistan 90% of births are conducted by TBA's. In most cases, TBA's are unable to diagnose the complications and are often unable to take decisions on timely referral. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence, nature and outcome of life threatening obstetrical conditions in referrals by Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs). This Observational, Descriptive study was conducted from January to December 2007, in the obstetrical unit of Fatima Hospital, Baqai Medical University, a tertiary care community based hospital. The study included patients referred by TBA's who developed life threatening obstetric conditions (LTOCs). Total 64 patients were referred by TBA's. The prevalence was 7.8%. Out of them, 53 (82.8%) patients admitted with life threatening obstetric conditions. The near-miss morbidities and mortalities were 45 (84.9%) and 8 (15%) respectively. Maternal mortality to Near-miss morbidity ratio was 1:6. Obstructed labour caused near-miss morbidity in 32 (60.3%) patients with no mortality. Postpartum haemorrhage as life threatening condition developed in 16 (30.1%) patients with 10 (18.8%) near-miss morbidities and 6 (11.3%) mortalities. Puerperal sepsis accounted for 1 (1.88%) near-miss morbidity and 2 (3.76%) mortalities. The mortality index for puerperal sepsis is (66.6%) almost double of postpartum haemorrhage (37.5%). Mortality to near miss morbidity ratio is high. Misidentification and late referrals of complicated cases by TBA's were responsible for near-miss morbidities and mortalities.\n\nAre obstetric outcomes affected by female genital mutilation?\n\nPubMed\n\nBalachandran, Aswini A; Duvalla, Swapna; Sultan, Abdul H; Thakar, Ranee\n\n2018-03-01\n\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM) has been associated with adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes, such as postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), perineal trauma, genital fistulae, obstructed labour and stillbirth. The prevalence of FGM has increased in the UK over the last decade. There are currently no studies available that have explored the obstetric impact of FGM in the UK. The aim of our study was to investigate the obstetric and neonatal outcomes of women with FGM when compared with the general population. We conducted a retrospective case-control study of consecutive pregnant women with FGM over a 5-year period between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2013. Each woman with FGM was matched for age, ethnicity, parity and gestation with subsequent patients without FGM (control cohort) over the same 5-year period. Outcomes assessed were mode of delivery, duration of labour, estimated blood loss, analgaesia, perineal trauma and foetal outcomes. A total of 242 eligible women (121 FGM, 121 control) were identified for the study. There was a significant increase in the use of episiotomy in the FGM group (pÂ =Â 0.009) and a significant increase in minor PPH in the control group during caesarean sections (pÂ =Â 0.0001). There were no differences in all other obstetric and neonatal parameters. In our unit, FGM was not associated with an increased incidence of adverse obstetric and foetal morbidity or mortality.\n\nPsychological Symptoms Among Obstetric Fistula Patients Compared to Gynecology Outpatients in Tanzania\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWilson, Sarah M.; Sikkema, Kathleen J.; Watt, Melissa H.; Masenga, Gileard G.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Obstetric fistula is a childbirth injury prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa that causes uncontrollable leaking of urine and/or feces. Research has documented the social and psychological sequelae of obstetric fistula, including mental health dysfunction and social isolation. Purpose This cross-sectional study sought to quantify the psychological symptoms and social support in obstetric fistula patients, compared with a patient population of women without obstetric fistula. Methods Participants were gynecology patients (N = 144) at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center in Moshi, Tanzania, recruited from the Fistula Ward (n = 54) as well as gynecology outpatient clinics (n = 90). Measures included previously validated psychometric questionnaires, administered orally by Tanzanian nurses. Outcome variables were compared between obstetric fistula patients and gynecology outpatients, controlling for background demographic variables and multiple comparisons. Results Compared to gynecology outpatients, obstetric fistula patients reported significantly higher symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, somatic complaints, and maladaptive coping. They also reported significantly lower social support. Conclusions Obstetric fistula patients present for repair surgery with more severe psychological distress than gynecology outpatients. In order to address these mental health concerns, clinicians should engage obstetric fistula patients with targeted mental health interventions.

Although each seeks to improve care by using scientific approaches beyond human physiology and pathophysiology, patient safety methodologies seek to avoid preventable adverse events, whereas health care quality projects aim to achieve the best possible outcomes. It is well-documented that an increasingly complex medical system controlled by human workers is a circumstance subject to recurrent failure. A safety culture encourages a proactive approach to mitigate failure before, during, and after it occurs. This article highlights the key concepts in health care safety and quality and reviews the background of the quality improvement sciences with particular emphasis on obstetric outcomes and quality measures.\n\nElectronic fetal monitoring: family medicine obstetrics.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodney, John R M; Huntley, Benjamin J F; Rodney, Wm Macmillan\n\n2012-03-01\n\nElectronic fetal monitoring assesses fetal health during the prenatal and intrapartum process.

Understanding the social context of obstetric fistula may lead to improved prevention and treatment. This study investigated social experiences of women with obstetric fistula seeking treatment at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. A descriptive study was conducted among women seeking treatment for obstetric fistula during a surgical camp in July 2011 using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were computed regarding sociodemographics, obstetric history, and social experience. Fifty-three women participated; 39 (73.58%) leaked urine only. Median age was 29 years (range: 17-58), and most were married or separated. About half (28, 47.9%) experienced a change in their relationship since acquiring obstetric fistula. More than half (27, 50.94%) acquired obstetric fistula during their first delivery, despite almost everyone (50, 94.3%) receiving antenatal care. The median years suffering from obstetric fistula was 1.25. Nearly every participant's social participation changed in at least one setting (51, 96.23%). Most women thought that a baby being too big or having kicked their bladder was the cause of obstetric fistula. Other participants thought health care providers caused the fistula (15, 32.61%; nÂ =Â 46), with 8 specifying that the bladder was cut during the operation (cesarean section). Knowing someone with obstetric fistula was influential in pursuing treatment. The majority of participants planned to return to family (40, 78.43%; nÂ =Â 51) and get pregnant after repair (35, 66.04%; n = 53). Study participants experienced substantial changes in their social lives as a result of obstetric fistula, and there were a variety of beliefs regarding the cause. The complex social context is an important component to understanding how to prevent and treat obstetric fistula. Further elucidation of these factors may bolster current efforts in\n\nDomestic violence in the pregnant patient: obstetric and behavioral interventions.\n\nPubMed\n\nMayer, L; Liebs"
