Forskning peker imidlertid pÃ¥ at bÃ¥de tilfeldigheter og uklarheter er knyttet til utÃ¸velse av rollen. Forskningsprosjektet âTeachers` Professional Qualificationsâ (TPQ, undersÃ¸ker intensjoner med den nye lÃ¦rerutdanningsÂ­reformen i Norge i et bredt perspektiv. Denne artikkelen undersÃ¸ker hvordan praksislÃ¦rere oppfatter sin rolle og sine oppgaver pÃ¥ bakgrunn av at reformen har ambisjoner om praksisÂ­lÃ¦rere som likeverdige samarbeidspartnere i lÃ¦rerutdanning. Studien har utgangspunkt i en spÃ¸rreundersÃ¸kelse med 45 praksislÃ¦rere i tillegg til dybdeintervju med Ã¥tte andre.Resultatene viser at det som kjennetegner rollen som praksislÃ¦rer, fÃ¸rst og fremst er lang erfaring som lÃ¦rer. I tillegg viser resultatene at generelle lÃ¦reroppgaver har mer oppmerkÂ­somhet i praksisperioder enn det som er mÃ¥l i lÃ¦rerutdanningsprogrammet. PÃ¥ den mÃ¥ten legitimerer praksislÃ¦rere sin rolle ut av en lÃ¦rerutdanningskontekst. Studien bekrefter ogsÃ¥ det internasjonal forskning viser: behovet for Ã¥ involvere praksislÃ¦rere i felles prosesser for Ã¥ utvikle sammenhenger mellom teoristudier og praksisopplÃ¦ring i lÃ¦rerutdanning.Fire Ã¥r etter implementering av lÃ¦rerutdanningsreformen i Norge er det grunn til Ã¥ stille spÃ¸rsmÃ¥l ved i hvilken grad intensjonene i reformen har blitt realisert. Diskusjonen er i hovedsak knyttet til profesjonalisering av praksislÃ¦rerrollen og praksislÃ¦rere som likeverdige samarbeidspartnere i lÃ¦rerutdanning.NÃ¸kkelord: lÃ¦rerutdanning, lÃ¦rerutdannere, praksislÃ¦rere, forholdet teori-praksisAbstractPractice teachers have a central role in teacher education. However, research indicates ranÂ­domness and obscurity in performing this role.

It is also...... an established fact that the implementation of teacher education reforms to a large extent stands and falls with the competences of the teacher educators. Not least it is of importance that teacher educators possess the kind of competences that are needed to meet the intentions of a reform. Failing teacher...... educator competences might just as well be an explanation for frequent reforms in teacher education as it can be failure of the reforms themselves. Danish teacher education was in 2012 reformed for the third time in only fifteen years, but teacher educator competences were not mapped at all during...\n\nThe Role of Mobile Technologies in Pre-Service Foreign Language Teacher Education\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTolosa, Constanza\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPre-service teacher education plays a pivotal role in ensuring that future teachers are prepared to integrate technology effectively to their teaching.

The study sought to critically and collaboratively explore with a sample of six teacher educators their answers, perceptions and perspectives in relation to their knowledge and understanding of environmental problems in local/global contexts and their meanings of curriculum and pedagogical practices for fostering environmental education in their teacher education programs. The participants generally demonstrated a considerable amount of knowledge of the environmental realities and problems facing Egypt encompassing air, water and solid waste sectors. Their views concurred with national and official studies identifying these issues as the most pressing environmental problems in the country. The exploration of the institutional, social and cultural causes and developmental and/or global causes of environmental problems in Egypt led us to articulate different themes relating environmental crisis in Egypt to different issues. These issues included poverty, education, religion and development. One of the major findings of the study was the participants' view that development was the major contributor to the environmental crisis in Egypt. They all stressed that, in its pursuit of economic growth, the government did not pay due attention to the environmental costs. Sharing perspectives from a critical paradigm of ecological sustainability, the participants felt that the government needed to clearly address the economic and ecological dimensions of development. In addition, a few participants affirmed that development is the thread that ties all the different factors together bringing into the conversations other dimensions of development like the social, values, and political dimensions. Addressing the future dimension of development, all of them expressed the need for a\n\nPreparing Teachers for Diversity: The Role of Initial Teacher Education.

Less research has examined perceptions of relationships within this setting (i.e., perceived teacher support and relatedness) and their role in student motivation. The purpose of this study was to test the mediating roles of perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness in the relationship between social contextual factors and motivation in physical education students (N = 508). Results from structural equation modeling showed that perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness partially mediated the relationship between perceived teacher support and self-determined motivation and that mastery climate related directly to self-determined motivation. The results highlight the importance of perceived teacher support, mastery climate, and relatedness to motivation in physical education.\n\nTeacher Education in Nigeria: An Overview\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nand brieï¬y examined the development of teacher in Nigeria.

In a modern medical education context, teachers need to adapt to various educational roles. This article describes how a role-based portfolio with a qualitative self-assessment scale was developed. It strives to encourage and support teachers' growth in different educational roles. The portfolio was developed between 2009 and 2012 at the University of Helsinki in dialogue with teachers involved in faculty development. It is based on the role framework presented by Harden and Crosby. Today, it also involves the educational premises of constructive alignment, reflection and a scholarly approach to teaching. The role-based portfolio has led the teachers to discover new educational roles and set goals in their professional development.\n\nTeacher Education in Nigeria: An Overview | Jibril | African ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nThe paper stresses the importance of teacher education and briefly examined the development of teacher in Nigeria.

This study examined special education teachers' role in facilitating peer relationships among students with mild intellectual disabilities in a mainstream school context. The study was based on qualitative semi-structured interviews with nine special education teachers who belong to special education groups in lower secondary schools. A thematic structural analysis was used to identify themes. The teachers made substantial efforts to promote social competence and ensure optimal conditions to foster peer interactions. An \"academic-oriented\" education, divergent attitudes, challenges in teacher collaboration, and organizational constraints may be barriers. In a mainstream school, the role of special education teachers appears to be dependent on the basic values of the school management in terms of real opportunities to foster peer relationships among students with mild intellectual disabilities.\n\nTEACHER OF EARLY EDUCATION IN THE ROLE OF A TRAPPER-CREATOR OF LIBERATING EDUCATION\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJolanta MaciÄ g\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The modern civilization is characterised by a significant degree of development in thefields of science, technology and industry â which leads to numerous transformations in thefunctioning of traditional communities and societies, population migrations and creation ofnew groups and socio-professional layers. Due to the above-mentioned transformations, humaninterpersonal relations are frequently subject to the process of depersonalization, manifesting atendency to objectify people. Observing social changes that have been transpiring in Polandrecently as well as attempts to reform the educational system result in an increased importanceof questions concerning the role played by teachers and tasks they are to perform.According to Aleksander Nalaskowski, âa school is worth only as much as the teacherswho work in itâ1. Answering the questions of âWho currently works in Polish schools?â âWhoare our teachers?â- the author comes to the conclusion that we no longer encounter teacherteams at schools but only purely accidental gatherings of teachers. Such arbitrarily composedteacher assemblies do not form a unity, a characteristic group with numerous individual traits2.I consider it worthwhile to focus on the issue of professional awareness and professionalcompetences and qualifications of the teacher of children in the pre-school and early schoolstages (the so-called early education. School functioning is, after all, all the more effective ifthe teachers cooperate with one another, have a better understanding of childrenâs needs andare able to jointly improve their individual styles of work.

By consequence, these staff sustain the dual role of employed teacher and teacher-trainee usually at the beginning of their career. This paper reports on a project funded by ESCalate which researched the dual roles and dual identities of employee and trainee on in-service FE teacher-training courses. It argues that the lack of a culture of pedagogical development in colleges along with the pressure for trainees to quickly cope with teaching can lead to conservative practice as expedience may be prioritised over flair. In response, the paper makes recommendations to enhance the experience and development of in-service teacher trainees.\n\nMANAGERS AND BASIC EDUCATION TEACHERS : THE IMPLICATIONS OF ITS ROLE WITH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TECHNICAL SCHOOL BOARDS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nManuel Ortega MuÃ±oz\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This letter is part of a broader investigation that deals with the functioning of the School Technical Councils in the elementary schools in the state of Durango, Mexico.

The researcher interviewed secondary science teachers on the experiences they found meaningful in various program components that influenced their teacher identity, beliefs about science pedagogy, and their sense of preparedness for teaching. Document analysis of teachers' journals and lesson plans supplemented the qualitative data in addition to the researcher's role and knowledge as an outsider (non-Benedum graduate) and insider (facilitator and instructor in the technology integration based classes for one year) of the Benedum Collaborative Five-Year Teacher Education Program. Findings also supported the Holmes (1986) and Goodlad (1990) views for extended field experiences and \"collaborative culture\" in teacher education for well-prepared teachers.\n\n[The role of physical education teachers to support overweight and obese pupils].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJodkowska, Maria; OblaciÅska, Anna; Tabak, Izabela; Radiukiewicz, Katarzyna\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSchool-based physical education (PE) is often proposed as a strategy for obesity prevention and treatment. Thus the role of PE teachers is crucial on this field. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perception of PE teachers towards overweight and obese pupils aged 13-15 years, especially psychosomatic problems and support for obese adolescents in realisation of physical activity programme. A random sample of 185 PE teachers from 112 lower secondary schools in Poland were surveyed regarding their perception of pupils obesity and their support for obese adolescents. PE teachers observed many negative features among obese pupils: Two thirds of teachers (67% male and 74% teachers with work experience 6-10 years) observed decreased physical fitness and exercise capacity in this group of pupils. Body-related barriers in obese pupils and anxiety caused by weight related peer teasing were observed by respectively 30% and 20% teachers more often women teachers and teachers with shorter work experience. PE teachers were engaged in activities to support obese pupils: 90% of them assessed obese pupils by personal development, 70% conducted counseling and 20% cooperated with obese pupils' parents. Two third of teachers reported successes in their work with obese pupils. Their difficulties were connected with body-related barriers in pupils (24%), and aversion to exercise and physical efforts and location of PE lessons at school (9-16%). 1. The PE teachers can play an important role in preventing and combating obesity in pupils. 2. PE teachers should be motivated to organize interesting PE lessons, school sport and competitions for both normal and overweight pupils.\n\nThe Attitudes of Teachers in Further Education.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYoung, G.

Are they prepared for the shifts in their roles that are likely to occur over the next few decades? Are they developing a critical consciousness, to better assume leadership roles in educational change? These questions framed this exploration which qualitatively investigated pre-service teachers' perceptions of their role as educators in relation to advanced technologies. Pre-service teachers were asked to respond to a reading identifying (via an open ended think paper assignment what they liked and did not like about the future vision of education offered in the reading. Their responses indicate a strong conflict between the desire to work with motivated, responsible students who are actively engaged in their own learning and their notion of what a teacher should be, based on their own experiences in schools.\n\nFostering Teacher Educators' Professional Development in Research and in Supervising Student Teachers' Research\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGeerdink, Gerda; Boei, Fer; Willemse, Martijn; Kools, Quinta; Van Vlokhoven, Haske\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMost teacher educators who work at institutes for higher vocational education have faced a new role since the European Community aimed to upgrade the general quality of education.

The study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey. Information was collected from 305 secondary school teachers selected by multi-stage random sampling method from Osun state, Nigeria using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. Median age of respondents was 36 +/- 8.18 years. Male/female ratio was 1:1.2. Knowledge about key reproductive issues was poor and inadequate. Knowledge of more than one contraceptive method was low (39.0%), Condom was the most frequently mentioned (59.3%). The teachers exhibited poor perception of their role in sexuality education of their students. 52.8% placed the sole responsibility for sexuality education on parents and only 20.7% found that it should start before age 10 years. Mean menarcheal age was 13.1 +/- 1.7 y. A statistically significant association was found between respondents' gender and knowledge of menarcheal age (p = .03); and between class taught and knowledge of menarcheal age (p = .003). 86.90% had positive attitude towards inclusion of sexuality education in the school curriculum; however, 43.6% felt that contraceptive methods should not be part of the course content. An urgent need exists for education and re-orientation of teachers through seminars and workshops, in-service training education program to equip them properly for the task.

The author provides a review of the literature on the subject and specifies the concept of extra-role performance behavior of teachers, what factors cause or promote such behavior, and what it means to be a âgood teacherâ. Understanding the importance of extrarole performance behavior as an essential component of labor efficiency will help educational organizationsâ heads to use it in the recruitment, selection and certification of teachers, and in the development of personnel reserve. The author selects three factors predicting extra-role performance behavior: work experience, the school as an organization, and identification with the school staff. Regression models based on data on school teachers of Vologda (N = 78.6 schools, explained extra-role performance behavior associated with a change in the functioning of the organization (Model 2. Enhancement of performance, R2=0.21 and with behavior toward colleagues (Model 4. Helping the colleagues,R2=0.19. The predictive capacity (partial R2 of predictors turned out different: for work experience â 0.10, for affiliation with a particular school â 0.06, for identification with the school staff â 0.02 . Extra-role performance behavior of teachers in Vologda is more pronounced in comparison with the standardization sample. Newcomers are much less likely to display such behavior since they do not have opportunities to influence the school organization and help colleagues. The low degree of satisfaction with group membership as a component of identification with the school team can be caused by significant work-load. We assume that when work-load increases, it is extra-role performance behavior that suffers in the first place, and this leads to\n\nValues Education and Some Suggestions to Teachers\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDemirhan Iscan, Canay\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis paper focuses on the process, approaches and teacher roles in values education and offers recommendations for teachers.

J. J. M.; van Berkel, B.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nPhilosophy of science education can play a vital role in the preparation and professional development of science teachers. In order to fulfill this role a philosophy of science education should be made practical for teachers. First, multiple and inherently incomplete philosophies on the teacher and teaching on what, how and why should be integrated. In this paper we describe our philosophy of science education (ASSET approach) which is composed of bounded rationalism as a guideline for understanding teachers' practical reasoning, liberal education underlying the why of teaching, scientific perspectivism as guideline for the what and educational social constructivism as guiding choices about the how of science education. Integration of multiple philosophies into a coherent philosophy of science education is necessary but not sufficient to make it practical for teachers. Philosophies are still formulated at a too abstract level to guide teachers' practical reasoning. For this purpose, a heuristic model must be developed on an intermediate level of abstraction that will provide teachers with a bridge between these abstract ideas and their specific teaching situation. We have developed and validated such a heuristic model, the CLASS model in order to complement our ASSET approach. We illustrate how science teachers use the ASSET approach and the CLASS model to make choices about the what, the how and the why of science teaching.\n\nUnderstanding Differences in Role Stressors, Resilience, and Burnout in Teacher/Coaches and Non-Coaching Teachers\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRichards, K.

The Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC, led by the American Physical Society (APS and the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT, has supported transformation of physics teacher preparation programs at a number of institutions around the country for over a decade. In 2012â2013, PhysTEC supported an independent study on the sustainability of its sites after project funding ends. The study sought to measure the extent to which programs have been sustained and to identify what features should be prioritized for building sustainable physics teacher preparation programs. Most of the studied sites have sustained increases in the number of physics teachers educated per year as well as funding for physics teacher preparation. About half of the programs are thriving, in that in the post-award period, they have further increased both the number of physics teachers educated per year and funding for physics teacher preparation. All studied sites that sustained increases in the number of physics teachers educated per year have two features in common: a champion of physics teacher education and institutional commitment. The thriving physics teacher preparation programs in this study implemented different elements of physics teacher preparation according to diverse local priorities and opportunities, including the unique expertise of local personnel.\n\nRoles and Domains to Teach in Online Learning Environments: Educational ICT Competency Framework for University Teachers\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGuasch, Teresa; Alvarez, Ibis; Espasa, Anna\n\nThis chapter is aimed at presenting an integrated framework of the educational information and communications technology (ICT) competencies that university teachers should have to teach in an online learning environment. Teaching through ICT in higher education involves performing three main roles - pedagogical, socialist, and design/planning - and also two cross-cutting domains that arise from the online environment: technological and managerial. This framework as well as the competencies for university teachers associated with it were validated at a European level by a dual process of net-based focus groups of teachers and teacher trainers in each of the participating countries in a European Project (Elene-TLC) and an online Delphi method involving 78 experts from 14 universities of ten European countries.

Opportunities for promotion are limited, as is the support for obtaining educational qualifications. The aim of this study was to ascertain the views of such teachers at a dental school. An anonymous online survey was used to obtain both qualitative and quantitative views. The response rate was 80%. The school has n = 50 part-time clinical teachers, who have been teaching for, on average ten years, and for three sessions per week. Eighteen percent of teachers are recognised specialists. Forty-six percent of respondents have a formal teaching qualification, mostly at certificate level, and 55% thought it necessary to acquire a formal teaching qualification. Eighty-eight percent were happy with their role as clinical teachers. This study demonstrates that despite the lack of support and prospect of career progression, the majority of part-time clinical teachers at this institution are satisfied with their role.\n\nPre-Service Teachersâ Experiences during Off-Campus Observation: Basis for Improving the Roles of Teacher Education Institutions and Cooperating Schools\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaripaz C.

This used qualitative content analysis method in order to âsubjectively interpret the content of text data through the systematic classification process of coding and identifying themes or patternsâ (Hsieh & Shanon, 2005 p. 1278 . Data were taken from 136 pre-service teachers Â through open-ended questions and two high school principals, 10 cooperating teachers, six student supervisors and 12 pre-service teachers through Focus Group Interview (FGI and Key Informant Interview (KII. Codes and emerging themes were derived using content analysis.Â Results showed 18 themes for desirable experiences and 24 themes for undesirable experiences. Pre-service teachersâ experiences mostly focused on studentsâ attitudes and behaviors. Suggestions to improve off-campus observation from multi-level participants of the study concentrated on preparedness,Â orientation programs, supervision and monitoring, Â personal attributes and roles, values, attitudes and behaviors, deployment, post conferences,Â supervisory plan, observation policies and guidelines,Â required documents, seminars, time management, evaluation, coordination, and cultural diversity. To sustain the desirable experiences, both cooperating teachers and student supervisors believed that their roles were to serve as model, guide, leader, monitor, planner, and motivator. The varied experiences of pre-service teachers imply that Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs and cooperating schools should provide opportunities, develop competencies, take responsibilities and strengthen partnership to enhance off-campus observation.\n\nSpecial Education Teacher Leadership in Jordan: Current State and Constraints\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEman Al-Zboon\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Distributed leadership can enhance the professional learning communities of schools.

They regarded the provision of cognitive and emotional support to colleagues as their most important leadership role, and participating in interview committees and selecting new teachers as the least important. There were no significant mean differences between male and female special education teachers in their level of enacted leadership. Level of education and years of experience were found to have a significant effect on the level of teachersâ leadership.\n\nInvestigation the Role of Medical Teacher in Education in Universities of Medical Sciences in the Country from the Viewpoint of Medical Teachers\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHossein Jalahi\n\n2015-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Background and purpose: Ideal education is obtained when excellence and promotion of faculty members (faculty development considered in the university and it will not be possible unless the roles of faculty members (teachers are explained in education.

The abbreviation CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning has been used to designate the processes of language teaching and learning with the use of computers, and language teacher education in CALL to name teacher education for and with the use of new technologies, since a number of authors point to the interdependence of both processes. We intend in this article to present an overview of the literature of the area of language teacher education in CALL nowadays and discuss issues related to the use of new technologies concerning its integration to teacher education and the functional and institutional roles to be taken. We also present two proposals of teacher education with the use of new technologies which are being implemented and at the same time studied in Brazil, which we believe have essential elements for the development of language teachers for and with the use of new technologies currently.\n\n\"You're Not a Teacher, You're a Man\": The Need for a Greater Focus on Gender Studies in Teacher Education\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCushman, Penni\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIf teachers are to play a positive educative role in addressing societal gender-related issues that impact on social justice and inclusiveness, teacher education institutions have to ensure that their graduating teachers are well equipped with the necessary understandings and skills to enact this role.

Manager, Bureaucrat or Citizen?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAstrid MÄczkowska-Christiansen\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The article presents reflections on the role of the teacher in contemporary social reality dominated by neoliberal culture, which involves weakening democratic institutions; a corporate model of functioning in educational institutions; managerial discourse that reduces educational processes to management strategies; and the development of bureaucracy as a governance model. It is argued that âbureaucratâ and âmanagerâ are the two versions of a professional role currently being imposed on teachers, as well as the antithesis of teachersâ civic roles.\n\nPsychological reality and the role of the teacher in early-education sharing time\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAlsafi, Abdullah T.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe study of children's language development has been strongly influenced since the 1950s by linguistic research. How well, however, has the education of young children incorporated the concept of psychological reality, which interrelates the child's perceptual and cognitive development with linguistic and non-linguistic events in his/her environment? In reply to this question, the paper concentrates on\"sharing time\", known also as\"show and tell\", which has both affective and cognitive value. Although sharing time is a student-centered activity, the teacher plays a pivotal role in establishing its context, structure and norms. Feedback from the teacher and peers promotes language development, and the growth of curiosity and inquisitiveness. The article is derived from experience in teaching kindergarten teachers to conduct sharing time periods in Saudi Arabia. Practical suggestions are made for the implementation of the activity, in the interests of encouraging spontaneous and personalized language rather than focusing on evaluation of students' competence in the formal aspects of language development.\n\nScrutinizing EFL teachers' job satisfaction and stress at work: The intervening roles of gender, teaching experience, and educational level\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nFahimeh Kamali Cheshmeh Jalal; Afsaneh Ghanizadeh; Omid Akbari\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe present study sought to explore the relationship between English as a foreign language (EFL) EFL teachers' stress at work and their job satisfaction.

This has impacted all disciplines in higher education including medical anatomy programs. The objective of this review was to define the role and support needs of sessional anatomy teachers by reporting on the (1) qualifications, (2) teaching role, (3) training, and (4) performance management of this group of educators. A systematic literature search was conducted on the 27 July 2017 in Scopus, Web of Science, and several databases on the Ovid, ProQuest and EBSCOhost platforms. The search retrieved 5,658 articles, with 39 deemed eligible for inclusion. The qualifications and educational distance between sessional anatomy teachers and their students varied widely. Reports of cross-level, near-peer and reciprocal-peer teaching were identified, with most institutes utilizing recent medical graduates or medical students as sessional teachers. Sessional anatomy teachers were engaged in the full spectrum of teaching-related duties from assisting students with cadaveric dissection, to marking student assessments and developing course materials. Fourteen institutes reported that training was provided to sessional anatomy teachers, but the specific content, objectives, methods and effectiveness of the training programs were rarely defined. Evaluations of sessional anatomy teacher performance primarily relied on subjective feedback measures such as student surveys (nâ=â18) or teacher self-assessment (nâ=â3). The results of this systematic review highlight the need for rigorous explorations of the use of sessional anatomy teachers in medical education, and the development of evidence-based policies and training programs that regulate and support the use of sessional teachers in higher education.

This study investigated the perceptions of those teachers on when they read the IEP, how they measure attainment of IEP goals and objectives, and the IEPs usefulness in instructional planning. Four hundred twenty-six teachers from suburban school districts in central New Jersey were respondents. Results indicated that the majority of general and special education teachers are reading their studentsâ IEPs in a fairly timely manner and that they find them moderately useful in planning instruction. Results also suggested that teachers relied heavily on grades to document attainment of IEP goals and that teachers felt that the IEPs themselves could be improved if they were shorter with student-specific, critical information that was more relevant to classroom instruction.\n\nSustaining Physics Teacher Education Coalition Programs in Physics Teacher Education\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nScherr, Rachel E.; Plisch, Monica; Goertzen, Renee Michelle\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of increasing the number of physics teachers educated per year at institutions with thriving physics teacher preparation programs may inspire and support other institutions in building thriving programs of their own.

Methodological triangulation was used, comprising questionnaires completed by 15 PTs and mentors, followed by six semistructured interviews, to provide quantitative and qualitative data. The results of the study identify that post-registration students demanded considerable time due to their need to develop leadership and higher cognitive skills in practice. PTs and mentors identified feeling undervalued by the organisation and colleagues as they tried to maintain their dual role with limited time or resources allocated. Respondents reported that they often worked over their hours to maintain both roles which impacted on their work life balance. They reported that both peer and university support groups were valuable and suggested that increased contact from lecturers and greater flexibility in university courses would accommodate their continuing professional development. It is, therefore, concluded that further support is needed by both the organisation and the university to enable this dual role.\n\nA Qualitative Phenomenological Exploration of Teachers' Experience With Nutrition Education.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHall, Elisha; Chai, Weiwen; Albrecht, Julie A\n\n2016-05-03\n\nBackground: Nutrition education delivered by classroom teachers has become a popular intervention designed to combat childhood obesity. However, few qualitative studies have explored nutrition education with teachers Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore how elementary teachers describe their experience with nutrition education. Methods: A qualitative phenomenological approach was used. Semistructured interviews, observations, and document analysis were conducted with 10 teachers who delivered nutrition education in their classrooms. Inductive coding was used to determine invariant constituents, reduce constituents to categories, and cluster categories into themes. Reliability and validity were accomplished through intercoder agreement, audio recording, triangulation, bracketing, and member checking. Results: Results identified 5 core themes related to roles teachers play in nutrition education, the importance placed upon nutrition, motivation for supplementary activities, barriers, and a triadic relationship between students, teachers, and curriculum. Discussion: Findings reveal interactions within the nutrition education experience in which teachers balance barriers with their value of nutrition education and motivation to help students make healthy choices. Translation to Health Education Practice: Health educators should work with classroom teachers at the program design, implementation, and evaluation stages of curriculum development to better address needs and facilitate the delivery of high-quality nutrition education for students.\n\nTeachers' Perceptions and Practices of STEAM Education in South Korea\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPark, HyunJu; Byun, Soo-yong; Sim, Jaeho; Han, Hyesook; Baek, Yoon Su\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis study examined teachers' perceptions and practices of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education in South Korea, drawing on a survey of teachers in STEAM model schools.

Javier\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis study is aimed at assessing special education teachers' attitudes toward teaching pupils with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and at determining the role of variables associated with a positive attitude towards the children and their education. Sixty-nine special education teachers were interviewed. The interview included two multiple-choice Likert-type questionnaires, one about teachers' attitude, and another about teachers' perceived needs in relation to the specific education of the pupil with ASD. The study shows a positive view of teachers' expectations regarding the education of pupils with ASD. A direct logistic regression analysis was performed testing for experience with the child, school relationship with an ASD network and type of school (mainstream or special) as potential predictors. Although all three variables are useful in predicting special education teachers' attitudes, the most relevant was the relationship with an ASD network. Need for information and social support are the relatively highest needs expressed by teachers.
