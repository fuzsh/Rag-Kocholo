View presentation\n\nFiona Green, author of Winning with Data-CRM and Analytics for the Business of Sports spoke on âUsing CRM and Data to Increase Participation, Revenue and Engagementâ, giving a fascinating insight of the modern world and how attention span has changed over the years, to the point that the average adultâs current-day attention span is eight seconds (âa goldfish is nine seconds!â added Ms Green), for the younger generation six seconds and young children under five years old four seconds.\n\nMs Green quoted Microsoft founder Bill Gates saying in 1999: âHow you gather, manage and use information will determine whether you win or lose.â She said: âWe live in a world that is competing for time, money and attention and if you want to gain any of those, you have eight seconds or less to gain them before that personâs attention is off somewhere else.â\n\nMs Green talked about CRM (Customer Relationship Management) in the modern world and the key of âgetting the right message to the right person at the right timeâ and how technology and its ability to collect and analyse data enables you to do that. View presentation\n\nMichael Nishi, General Manager of the Bank of America Chicago Marathon spoke on âHow Technology may support the Safety and Security program of your raceâ. He gave a very impressive presentation on technologyâs central role in enabling the quality of decision making when managing a group of 45,000 people and all the variables that can involve.\n\nThe Chicago Marathon has a sophisticated command centre where all the services of police, traffic, fire, medical and expert decision makers are gathered where their decision making is informed by data and technology.\n\nOne example given was how the weather temperature is monitored from long before and during the race. The race uses various channels including digital and social media to inform, educate and advise runners and most importantly aim to keep them safe.\n\nIn 2007 the Chicago Marathon had to stop its event due to extreme heat. Where of course such actions bring disappointment, they are essential in the interests of the health of participants and the complex process has to be managed and access to data, analysis and communication is central to that process. The use of technology is a key component in effective decision making that in turn can saves lives. View presentation\n\nVaggelis Vlachos, Software Developer-Electronics Engineer and Eleni Vlachou Market Researcher & Business Consultant-Greece spoke on âArtificial Intelligence in Marathon Racesâ. Ms Vlachou gave an insightful talk about a system that is being developed to identify rogue runners who use false numbers to take part in the race without officially entering and how technology van be used to identify them and help avoid cheating and potential disruption to the event. View presentation\n\nOther speakers included the three Chairpeople of AIMSâ three new commissions started this year:\n\nMartha Morales, Chairperson of the AIMS Womenâs Commission talked about the planned initiatives that AIMS is developing around the world such as âempowerment for girlsâ through running.\n\nMichael Nishi Chairperson of AIMS Safety & Security Commission spoke about the considerable work being developed by AIMS to create models of good practice and test cases to help event organisers improve safety for runners, volunteers and staff and spectators.\n\nGeorge Kazantzopoulos Chairperson of AIMS Sustainability Commission talked about the models of good practice being developed by AIMS looking at examples of excellence in ensuring events are organised in a way that respects the environment. Looking for example at areas of air quality, climate change and waste management.\n\nPaco Borao President of AIMS commented: âOne of AIMSâ goals is to exchange knowledge and expertise and the AIMS Symposium is an excellent platform for enabling that to happen. Always with the goal of creating a better experience for the true actors of our show: the runners.â\n\nNote to AIMS members: Members are encouraged to review the presentations to be posted on the members section on the AIMS website www.aims-worldrunning.org.\n\nThe Symposium was arranged in collaboration with SEGAS (the Hellenic Athletics Federation) and âAthens Marathon. The Authentic.â and has been held annually since 2007.\n\nAIMS would like to thank partners and sponsors, in particular the âRegion of Atticaâ as co-organiser of the Symposium, the âGreek National Tourism Organisationâ and âAthens International Airportâ as official sponsors of the Symposium.\n\nThis article was revised after first publication.\n\nAIMS Marathon Symposium\n\n340 million runners in China take part in âonline marathonsâ\n\nAIMS Marathon Symposium in Athens discusses technology and mass running events\n\nAn astonishing 340 million runners in just the last four years have taken part in âonline marathonâ events in China.\n\nMs Sheng Lan Yang of the CAA (Chinese Athletics Association) cited this number on 9 November at the 13th Marathon Symposium in Athens, Greece, organised by AIMS.\n\nThe vice-director of marketing at the CAA, in her talk on âTechnology applications in Chinese marathon racesâ, said that in 1997, China had fewer than 10 marathons. By 2011 there were 39 events but just seven years later in 2018 there were 1,581 races with 5.83 million runners taking part.\n\nMs Yang went on to explain about the creation of a special âonline marathonâ initiative set up four years ago in conjunction with CAA and AIMS member the Xiamen Marathon, where runners signed up to running the race in their own local location through an app called âJoyrunâ.\n\nRunners register online and then run the marathon in their own location wherever they may be. The app includes virtual crowd cheers â âcome onâ and âyou are the bestâ. Once the runner has completed their route, followed by GPS, they then receive a physical medal and certificate sent to them to mark their achievement.\n\nSince that first âeventâ 340 million people have taken part in the Joyrun app online marathons. In 2018 alone 32.5 million people participated in online marathons. Individual âeventsâ have drawn entries of an astonishing 300,000 runners.\n\nOne other innovation mentioned by Ms Yang was a heart rate safety monitoring system where runners heart rate is fed into an algorithm which can monitor the runnerâs health during the race and warn if it is getting to a dangerous level and intervene in extreme cases. This is an excellent method of monitoring the runnerâs health and enables the data to be analysed in large numbers by health professionals using the knowledge obtained to inform medical support and policies. As an example, Ms Yang revealed that the maximum heart rate level during marathons in China arises between the 35-40 kilometre stage in the 42.2 km event.\n\nAIMS news\n\nAIMS hosts âBest Marathon Runnerâ awards gala in Athens\n\nWorld champions Desisa and Chepngetich take home the BMR awards for 2019\n\nThe Ethiopian distance runner Lelisa Desisa and Kenyaâs Ruth Chepngetich were tonight recognised as the male and female recipients of the âBest Marathon Runnerâ Award for 2019 by the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS).\n\nTheir achievements were given global recognition in the birthplace of the Marathon in Athens, Greece tonight (Friday 8 November 2019) at the seventh annual AIMS Best Marathon Runner (BMR) Gala.\n\nLelisa and Ruth were chosen by the AIMS Athletesâ Nomination Committee as the outstanding candidates for the Male/Female Best Marathon Runner Awards 2019 based upon their performances.\n\nThis is the first time either athlete has been recognised with an AIMS Award.\n\nLelisa Desisa (29) won the TCS New York City Marathon in November 2018 before becoming the World Champion in the Marathon, winning at the IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar on 6 October 2019, recording a time of 2:10:40.\n\nRuth Chepngetich (25) is a Marathon World Champion, winning at the 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar in a time of 2:32:43.

The Authentic\n\nDefending champion Misoi leads elite field in Athens\n\n2004 Olympic champion Stefano Baldini brings historical perspective to the original classic course\n\n2018 Athens Marathon Athens, Greece November 11, 2018 Photo: Victah Sailer@PhotoRun Victah1111@aol.com 631-291-3409 www.photorun.NET #run.photo\n\nPhoto: Victah Sailer\n\nÂ© www.photorun.NET/AMA\n\nBrimin Misoi, the Kenyan who made headlines with an emphatic victory last year, will take pride of place on the start line for the 37th edition of the âAthens Marathon. The Authenticâ on Sunday, November 10.\n\nIn 2018 Misoi ran the third fastest time ever of 2:10:56 on the renowned, tough course from the coastal town of Marathon to the heart of Athens. He crossed the finish line in the Panathenaic Stadium, venue for the 1896 Olympic Games, almost two minutes clear of his nearest rival.\n\nRetaining the title will prove no easy task despite the Kenyan improving his personal best to 2:09:31 in the Vienna City Marathon in April where he was sixth. His rivals will include compatriot Daniel Muteti, whose best of 2:09:25 in finishing second in the Cape Town Marathon was achieved in mid-September.\n\nAdding historic lustre will be the 2004 Olympic champion Stefano Baldini. On his return to the original marathon course the Italian will be running as a âtouristâ rather than elite competitor but his Olympic winning time of 2:10:55 was just one second faster than Brimin Misoiâs last year, further proof of the Kenyanâs quality.\n\nThe âAthens Marathon. The Authenticâ has already broken records in the race build-up with participation limits in the marathon and parallel events now fully booked. A record total of more than 20,000 will run the marathon, a further 12,000 take part in the 10km road race and another 20,000 run the 5km Road Race ZERO WASTE FUTURE (by Coca-Cola), while total numbers of runners in all events has exceeded 60,000, another record. This festival of running is organized as in previous years by the Hellenic Athletics Federation (SEGAS). For the first time the 10km road race will be held on Saturday evening in central Athens, rather than all the running events taking place on Sunday, another indication of the tremendous growth of interest in the past few years, including a steep rise in the international entry among mass runners. This year 12,000 runners from more than 120 countries will be represented among the 60,000 involved in total, making the Athens Marathon one of the most international races in the world.\n\nOne more record of the event is the attendance of the races at the 13th AIMS Marathon Symposium and the 7th Best Marathon Runners Awards Gala: Race directors and representatives of 80 international marathons from 45 countries will be present.\n\nAs for the race for top honours, Brimin Misoi has not raced since the Vienna City Marathon in April where he brought his personal best down to 2:09:31. A rival and fellow Kenyan who knows what it means to run at that level is Daniel Muteti, making his debut on the Athens course. As recently as September 15 he ran his best of 2:09:25 to finish second in Cape Town. He has had a busy year in marathon terms in general, having begun with 2:10:55 for fourth in Mumbai on January 20. Athens and its challenging, rolling hills then descent for the last 10km may test his powers of recovery. Rhonzas Kilimo of Kenya dropped out of his debut marathon in Hamburg in late April but the former steeplechaser finished second in the Berlin Half Marathon with 61:01, an indication of marathon promise, at least. Also known as Rhonzaz Lokitam he clocked a half marathon PB of 60:49 a year ago in Valencia. These runners and others have the potential to put Felix Kandieâs 2014 course record of 2:10:37under pressure.\n\nOne outcome already certain is that every marathon finisher in the Panathenaic Stadium will receive their own piece of history in the form of the inaugural medal depicting the history of the race. To be awarded over the next eight years, this debut finisherâs medal, aptly enough, portrays the Battle of Marathon where the legend of the lone Athenian soldier-messenger began.\n\nAIMS Green Award C&D Xiamen Marathon\n\nXiamen Marathon to receive AIMS Green Award\n\nFirst Chinese event to be honoured â Presentation at AIMS gala\n\nThe Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS), the member organisation representing more than 460 of the worldâs leading distance races is pleased to announce the Xiamen Marathon from the Chinese city of Xiamen as the recipient of the 2019 AIMS Green Award, becoming the first Chinese running event to win the Award.\n\nThe Award is given in recognition of excellence in environmental practice and will be presented during the prestigious AIMS âBest Marathon Runnerâ (BMR) Awards Gala to be held in the birthplace of the Marathon in Athens, Greece on Friday 8 November 2019.\n\nCandidates for the AIMS Green Award are judged, among other criteria, on how the race promotes environmentally friendly practices, how volunteers contribute to the success of the event and how the race educates younger generations about the benefits of sport and environmental protection.\n\nThe two other races shortlisted by the judges were the Marine Corps Marathon (USA) â 2nd, and the Schneider Electric Marathon de Paris (France) â 3rd.\n\nThe Xiamen Marathon was founded in 2003 and has been rated as an âIAAF Gold Label Eventâ for 12 straight years. The race organisers are demonstrating significant effort regarding climate change, waste reduction and environmental awareness raising. The start and finish of the race is Xiamen International Convention and Exhibition Center accessible by many public transport options which are promoted by the race. Free shuttle buses are provided to runners by the race while shared bicycle parking is provided. In 2019, over 40 thousand people took advantage of public transport options.\n\nThe race aimed to create the first âzero pollutionâ marathon event in China by organising volunteers to collect litter from the course of the marathon and categorise it for recycling. In 2019 the race recycled 16.15 tons of plastic bottles and paper cups and cleaned up six tons of plastic from the course.\n\nSince 2015, the Xiamen Marathon have donated over 130 thousand saplings to be planted, creating the âXiamen Forest of Loveâ in cooperation with the project âMillion Forestâ run by China Green Foundation.\n\nRuan Dunliang, Vice President of the Xiamen Marathon comments: âWe are very proud to be recognised with this very prestigious award by AIMS. We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously. From the year 2020, we will advocate Car-free Day on the race day. Meanwhile, we will continue to build âXiamen Marathon Forest of Loveâ and promote the plan of UNEP for cleaning the ocean to reduce environmental pollution. We look forward to visiting the home of the Marathon in Athens to receive the award.â\n\nPaco Borao, President of AIMS: âI am looking forward to welcoming the Xiamen Marathon to Athens for the Best Marathon Runner Gala on behalf of AIMS Members, Partners and Sponsors. All our Members can look to their example for inspiration in how to host a sustainable event. We would like to thank and congratulate all the member races that submitted their candidateship for the AIMS Green Award.â\n\nAIMS has been honouring races with the AIMS Green Award that have shown exceptional work in this area since 2013. However, AIMS intention is not only to honour âenvironmental initiativesâ of its members, but also to help them improve their races, in terms of good environmental practices during their marathon events. To this end, AIMS in collaboration with the Institute Team for the World Environmental Alliance 2004+, a scientific non-governmental not-for-profit organization headed by Mr. George Kazantzopoulos, Chairman of the AIMS Sustainability Commission and former Member of the IOC Sport & Environment Commission, has established a set of environmental guidelines, in line with the IOC Olympic Movementâs Agenda 21 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, over and above the creation of the AIMS Green Award.\n\nPrevious Recipients of the AIMS Green Award\n\n2013 – SuisseGas Milano Marathon (Italy)\n\n2014 â BMW Frankfurt Marathon (Germany)\n\n2015 â Chevron Houston Marathon (USA)\n\n2016 – GÃ¶teborgsVarvet Half Marathon (Sweden)\n\n2017 â Sanlam Cape Town Marathon (South Africa)\n\n2018 – SwissCityMarathon-Lucerne (Switzerland)\n\nRace news OMT Beirut Marathon\n\nBeirut Marathon postponed\n\nOrganisers âremain committed to its missionâ\n\nThe BLOM BANK Beirut Marathon (LIB) has been postponed due to ongoing civil unrest in Lebanon.\n\nAfter extensive discussions the organisers decided to cancel the race which had been planned to take place on November 11.\n\nâThe Beirut Marathon remains committed to its mission of moving and uniting Lebanon through running by placing our beloved country on the international map of sports and showing the true colours of Lebanon,â the organisers said in a statement.\n\nâKeeping true to our mission, values and relations with our partners, runners, stakeholders, volunteers, international participants and friends, we have hereby decided to postpone the 17th edition of BLOM BANK Beirut Marathon to a later, more appropriate date.â\n\nRunning news\n\nDraconian doping sanctions looming\n\n1,000,000 USD maximum fine\n\nAlfons Juck of EME News reports: The US House of Representatives has passed an act which would criminalise doping conspiracies.\n\nThe Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, which would have to be passed by the House of Congress and then President Donald Trump, would apply to all major international sporting competition involving American sportspeople as well as in other situations, insidethegames.biz reports.\n\nThe maximum penalties would be $1million or 10 years in prison.\n\nRace news Mainova Frankfurt Marathon\n\nWorld-class elite field in Frankfurt\n\nLonah Salpeter will be fastest women ever to run course on the River Main\n\n2019 World Outdoor Championships Doha, Qatar Sept27-Oct 06, 2019 Photo: Victah Sailer@PhotoRun Victah1111@aol.com 631-291-3409 www.photorun.NET #victahsailer\n\nPhoto: Victah Sailer\n\nÂ© www.photorun.NET\n\nThe addition of Lonah Salpeter completes the elite field for the Mainova Frankfurt Marathon which takes place next Sunday. The Kenyan-born runner who competes for Israel has a personal best of 2:19:46 which makes her the fastest woman ever to be on the start list of the Mainova Frankfurt Marathon.\n\nGiven the extraordinary strength in depth of the womenâs race, the course record could well fall after just one year in existence â and the Mainova Frankfurt Marathon might record the first sub-2:20 womenâs time in its history. Four women who have run under 2:22 will be on the start line: alongside Salpeter (2:19:46) will be the title holder Meskerem Assefa of Ethiopia, who set the course record of 2:20:36 last year, the Kenyan Valary Aiyabei with a best of 2:20:53 and the Ethiopian Bedatu Hirpa (2:21:32). The latter finished third in Frankfurt last year. Another expected to produce a strong performance is the Ethiopian Megertu Kebede whose best is 2:22:52.\n\nThe menâs race on Sunday features a rare, perhaps unique contest over the marathon distance: junior against veteran or masters world record holder â Tsegaye Mekonnen against Mark Kiptoo. Mekonnen of Ethiopia has a best of 2:04:32 which means he is the fastest man in the field, while the Kenyan Kiptooâs personal best is 2:06:00.\n\nMany athletes competing in Frankfurt will have their eyes on the qualifying times for the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year. The target for the men is 2:11:30 and 2:29:30 for the women.\n\nEight men with best times under 2:08 will be on the start line which suggests yet another high quality and exciting race for top honours in Frankfurt with finishing times to match. Tsegaye Mekonnen is looking to re-establish himself with a fast time after injury problems on a Mainova Frankfurt Marathon course renowned for speedy performances. The world masters record holder Mark Kiptoo, who set an age group record here last year, should also have a say in the outcome this time. If he can match his younger rivals, his own masters world record will be under pressure.\n\nTwo Europeans seeking both big improvements on their personal bests and the Olympic qualifying times will be Britainâs Stephanie Twell (2:30:14) and the local runner Katharina Steinruck (2:28:34).\n\nDate changes Volksbank-MÃ¼nster-Marathon\n\nRace date for Volksbank-MÃ¼nster-Marathon (GER) changed\n\nVolksbank-MÃ¼nster-Marathon date change\n\nThe Volksbank-MÃ¼nster-Marathon (GER) will take place on Sun 20 September 2020, not Sun 13 September 2020 as previously published.\n\nDate changes Taishin Women Run Taipei\n\nRace date for Taishin Women Run Taipei (TPE) changed\n\nTaishin Women Run Taipei date change\n\nThe Taishin Women Run Taipei (TPE) will take place on Sun 29 March 2020, not Sun 12 April 2020 as previously published.\n\nRace news Bank of America Chicago Marathon\n\nKosgei sets new marathon world record\n\nRadcliffeâs 2003 time smashed by 81 seconds\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - OCTOBER 13: Brigid Kosgei of Kenya poses for a photo after breaking the world record to win the 2019 Bank of America Chicago Marathon on October 13, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois.

Yet in the previous 16 years no woman had come anywhere near it â the closest had been Mary Keitany in the 2017 London Marathon with 2:17:01.\n\nKosgei won Chicago last year in 2:18:35 and improved to 2:18:20 in London earlier this year. She had become the fastest ever woman at the half marathon distance only the previous month with a time of 1:04:28 â but this was not set on a record-eligible course.\n\nShe set off fast, reaching 5km in 15:28 with only Ethiopiaâs Abebel Yeshaneh (15:36) even trying to keep pace. She then settled into a rhythm of 16 minutes per 5km split (31:28, 47:26) to pass halfway, accompanied by two male pacemakers, in 1:06:59. From 30â35km she sped up with a 15:45 split and followed through to 40km with 15:56. She did not falter in the finishing stages as she stormed on towards the finish line by herself.\n\nâI ran here last year so I knew it was a good course,â said Kosgei. âThere was a little bit of wind but it was okay. People were cheering all along the course, which gave me more energy.â\n\nResult\n\nmarathon\n\nMen\n\n1 Lawrence CHERONO KEN 2:05:45 2 Dejane DEBELA ETH 2:05:46 3 Asefa MENGSTU ETH 2:05:48 4 Bedan KAROKI KEN 2:05:53 5 Bashir ABDI BEL 2:06:14\n\nWomen\n\n1 Brigid KOSGEI KEN 2:14:04 2 Ababel YESHANEH ETH 2:20:51 3 Gelete BURKA ETH 2:20:55 4 Emma BATES USA 2:25:27 5 Fionnuala MCCORMACK IRL 2:26:47\n\nRunning news\n\nEliud Kipchoge breaks two hours for the marathon distance\n\nHistoric time of 1:59:40.2\n\nÂ© VCM/ Michael Gruber\n\nEliud Kipchoge proved that âNo Human Is Limitedâ by becoming the first ever sub-two-hour marathon runner in Vienna on 12 October. He ran the marathon distance in 1:59:40.2.\n\nThe 34-year-old Kenyanâs historic achievement began at 08:15 on the ReichsbrÃ¼cke bridge with the temperature at around 9ÂºC and the wind between 0.5â1.5 m/s. The circuit was configured as a 1.5km start section and then 4.2 laps on the Hauptallee, a historic tree-lined avenue in the Prater park, selected as the venue for the INEOS 1:59 Challenge because of its long, flat straight sections and its protection from the wind.\n\nKipchoge ran a consistent pace set by the electric timing car and the pacemakers of 2:50 per km throughout the race. Every split was between 2:48â2:52. A group of 41 elite runners from all over the World assisted as pacemakers, with teams of seven changing over approximately every 5km. âIt is a great feeling to make history in sport. I am the happiest man in the world to be the first human to run under two hours. I expect more people all over the world to run under two hours after today. I thank [the pacemakers] and appreciate them for accepting to do the job. I want to make the sport [of distance running] an interesting sport whereby all human beings can run and together we can make this world a beautiful world,â he said.\n\nKipchogeâs time will not be ratified as an official IAAF World record but it has shown what a human being is able to achieve when everything, down to every last detail, is planned and well prepared.\n\nRace news\n\nCourse records tumble in Cardiff\n\nLeonard Langat runs 59:30, beating course record by 73 seconds\n\n06.10.19 - Cardiff Half Marathon - Men's winner Leonard Langat crosses the line ahead of second placed Shadrack Kimining.\n\nPhoto: Aled Llywelyn/Huw Evans Agency\n\nÂ© Huw Evans Agency\n\nLeonard Langat helped the Cardiff Half Marathon celebrate its recent inclusion in the new European âSuperHalfs Seriesâ by taking 73 seconds off the course record in the Welsh capital.\n\nLangat came up with a brilliant sprint finish to pip fellow Kenyan, and 2016 champion, Shadrack Kimining by a mere two seconds. Langat won the race in 59:30, a mere 12 seconds outside his previous best, while long-time race leader Kimming at least had a 10 second PB to reward his efforts in second place in 59:32.\n\nThose two times would have earned them the silver and bronze medals at the 2016 World Championships staged over virtually the same course in Cardiff, when current world record holder Geoffrey Kamworor won the title in 59:10 with Mo Farah back in third place in 59:59.\n\nâI was feeling comfortable behind Shadrack and I pushed on in the final 500 metres. I kept the pace up right to the finish because I was feeling so strong,â said Langat.\n\nâI always feel strong when I am running happy and that is down to the fantastic training group I have in Kenya. This is a wonderful course and I am sure that someone could run faster than 58 minutes on it in the future.â\n\nKamworor cut the world record down to 58:01 in winning the Copenhagen Half-Marathon, another one of the âSuper Halfs Seriesâ events, last month.\n\nKimining tried to push up the steep incline coming off Roath Park Lake up to Cathays Cemetery, where Kamworor broke the field in 2016, but Langat refused to be shrugged off. He stayed on the shoulder of his rival before making his move coming down the finishing straight.\n\nâI am happy to have run a PB and I think this is one of the fastest courses on which I have ever run. It is a bit like the event in Ras Al Khaimah,â said Kimining.\n\nThere was another dramatic finish in the womenâs race as Kenyaâs Lucy Cheruiyot and Ethiopiaâs Azmera Abreha ran side-by-side down the finishing straight, with another Kenyan, Paskalia Kipkoech, not far behind.\n\nIn the end, the extra strength of Cheruiyot carried her to victory, although both she and Abreha were given the same times, 68:20.

Although starting at midnight and finishing in the very early hours of Saturday morning on 28 September all medallists commented on the conditions.\n\nWinner Ruth Chepngetich (KEN) said: âIt was a tough race. I knew what to expectâ¦ I trained for this weather by running in the afternoon when the sun is up. It was not easy to run in these conditions but that gave me strength and power.â\n\nThe defending champion, Rose Chelimo (KEN), commented: âIt was very hot todayâ¦ I was not expecting to be silver medallist in those conditions. This marathon here was much hotter than the one I finished in Jakarta. I managed to stay there almost until the end. I did not change anything compared to other marathons regarding water supplies or so from the beginning to the end.â\n\nBronze medallist Helalia Johannes (NAM) said: âI have never run at such a time and in such weather. And I also have never trained in similar conditions. Especially the humidity was tough. This is the first [women’s marathon] medal for my country Namibia, this means a lot to me.â\n\nCaution was the watchword from the start with the first 5km split taking 18:21 (Chepngetichâs winning pace, averaged out, would be 18:06 for every 5km). Nineteen others passed the mark within three seconds and continued to 10km at the same pace although the group reduced to seven. Visiline Jepkesho then pushed the pace up and five contenders reached 15km in 54:01 (17:43 5km split). The pace then dropped back (18:33, 18:27) but the effect of the conditions made itself felt upon Jepkesho, who dropped back, eventually to finish 15th. The remaining four stuck together as Rose Chelimo and Ruth Chepngetich made the running (18:12, 18:10) to 35km with Helalia Johannes and 2011 and 2013 champion Edna Kiplagat following. Chepngetich then forged ahead, running the fastest 5km split of the race between 35-40km (17:29), to stretch the others out in her wake.\n\nRace news Ravenna Marathon City of Art\n\nUNESCO recognition for Ravenna\n\nPatronage due to mix of sport, culture and heritage\n\nPhoto: Maratona Ravenna\n\nThe Ravenna Marathon â City of Art (ITA) has officially received the patronage of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nThe patronage represents recognition of the work carried out by the race organisers, the Ravenna Runners Club and of the qualities of the city of Ravenna, which is increasingly focussing its tourism offering on culture and history.\n\nUNESCO patronage is moral recognition for the event and does not carry any financial support or involvement by the UN organisation.\n\nThe Italian UNESCO National Commission said in a letter that it had accepted the request for the patronage of the Ravenna Marathon âin consideration of the significant value of the initiative aimed at encouraging a more active use of our UNESCO World Heritage by combining sport, art and cultureâ.\n\nDate changes Nationale-Nederlanden Warsaw Half Marathon\n\nRace date for PZU Warsaw Half Marathon (POL) changed\n\nPZU Warsaw Half Marathon date change\n\nThe PZU Warsaw Half Marathon (POL) will take place on Sat 23 May 2020, not Sat 30 May 2020 as previously published.\n\nRunning news\n\nAlberto Salazar faces four-year ban\n\nDoping offences included trafficking and tampering\n\nBy Jim Ferstie\n\nEUGENE, OR - JUNE 25: Alberto Salazar the coach of Galen Rupp watches the Mens 10,000 Meter during day one of the 2015 USA Outdoor Track & Field Championships at Hayward Field on June 25, 2015 in Eugene, Oregon.

As head coach of the Nike Oregon Project, Salazar, 61, has trained such stars as Great Britain’s Mo Farah, a four-time Olympic champion on the track; Galen Rupp, the top American marathon runner; and Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, who set a world record in the womenâs mile in July and finished first in the 10,000 metres at the world track and field championships in Doha, Qatar on 28 September. Farah stopped training with Salazar in 2017.\n\nSalazar won the New York City Marathon three times and the Boston Marathon once.\n\nJeffrey Brown, an endocrinologist from Houston who has worked with Salazar, also received a four-year ban, USADA said. Both have denied wrongdoing. Representatives for Salazar, Brown and Nike could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nTravis Tygart, the chief executive of the anti-doping agency, said in a statement that Salazar and Brown had âdemonstrated that winning was more important than the health and well-being of the athletes they were sworn to protect.â\n\nRace news BMW Berlin-Marathon\n\nBekele misses world record by two seconds\n\nSensational comeback victory in 2:01:41 â Womenâs race sees favourite Cherono drop out and Bekere triumph\n\nBerlin-Marathon 2019\n\nPhoto: Norbert Wilhelmi\n\nÂ© nw@wilhelmi-fotograf.de\n\nKenenisa Bekele made a sensational return to his international best with victory at the BMW Berlin Marathon on Sunday 29 September, missing the world record by just two seconds.\n\nFor good measure, the 37-year-old Ethiopian set a national record and the fastest time in the world this year. Only his great Kenyan rival Eliud Kipchoge, who ran 2:01:39 here in Berlin last year, ranks above him in the world all-time list.\n\nBekele knows all too well what it is like to miss the world record by a narrow margin. In 2016 he won in 2:03:03 which was just six seconds outside the then world record. There are also historical precedents for such narrow misses in marathon history: in 1985 the Welshman Steve Jones ran within one second of the world record in Chicago.\n\nBehind Kenenisa Bekele his fellow Ethiopian Birhanu Legese finished second in 2:02:48 to become the third fastest marathoner in history. Third place went to Sisay Lemma, running a personal best of 2:03:36 to complete the Ethiopian clean sweep. The best German runner was Jens Nerkamp who ran 2:14:54 to finish 37th.\n\nIn good weather conditions Ashete Bekere contributed her share to the Ethiopian celebrations with victory in her best time of 2:20:14, the fifth fastest womenâs time of the year. Last yearâs winner Gladys Cherono of Kenya dropped out at around 30km while Mare Dibaba of Ethiopia finished second in 2:20:21. Sally Chepyego, a teammate of world record holder Eliud Kipchoge, took third place in 2:21:06.\n\nMelat Kejeta, Ethiopian-born but since March a German citizen, made a scintillating marathon debut to finish sixth in 2:23:57 and become the second fastest German woman ever in the marathon.\n\nA record number of 46,983 runners from 150 countries entered the 46th BMW Berlin Marathon.\n\nResult\n\nmarathon\n\nMen\n\n1 Kenensia BEKELE ETH 2:01:41 2 Birhanu LEGESE ETH 2:02:48 3 Sisay LEMMA ETH 2:03:36 4 Jonathan KORIR KEN 2:06:45 5 Felix KANDIE KEN 2:08:07\n\nWomen\n\n1 Ashete BEKERE ETH 2:20:14 2 Mare DIBABA ETH 2:20:21 3 Sally CHEPYEGO KEN 2:21:06 4 Helen TOLA ETH 2:21:36 5 Sara HALL USA 2:22:16\n\nRace news BMW Berlin-Marathon\n\nCherono hopes for record fourth win in Berlin\n\nCourse record also a target\n\nProcessed with VSCO with c3 preset\n\nÂ© Copyright 2019. All rights reserved.\n\nGladys Cherono is keen to write another chapter of history on Sunday in the BMW Berlin Marathon. A year ago the Kenyan broke the course record which had stood for 13 years â and a fourth triumph here would give her more wins than any other female runner.\n\nCherono has a further goal in breaking her own course record of 2:18:11 hours.\n\nWhile the elite are aiming to produce world class times of under 2:20, Melat Kejeta is hoping to run 2:22, which would be a sensational debut at the distance for the former Ethiopian who received German citizenship only in March. The Olympic qualifying time for the womenâs marathon in next yearâs Games in Tokyo is 2:29:30, a target also shared by the home favourite Anna Hahner.\n\nAlso among the favourites should be Mare Dibaba, even though the 2015 World Marathon Champion and 2016 Olympic bronze medallist hasnât shown her best form recently. âMy aim is to run at the level of my personal best,â explained Dibaba, who has twice achieved the distinction of running 2:19:52.\n\nThis year the BMW Berlin Marathon has already established a record with 46,983 runners entered. âWe were able to increase the limit by 3,000 runners and with 150 nations represented, this is also a record. It will really be a world of runners on the startline,â said JÃ¼rgen Lock, CEO of the organizers, SCC EVENTS.\n\nRunning news\n\nPaperwork eased for running tourists in Italy\n\nForeign runners no longer require a medical certificate for Italian distance races\n\nTaking part in Italian marathons and half marathons just got easier for foreign athletes.\n\nRunners who are not members of recognized sport clubs in their own countries can finally participate in Italian races without having to present a medical certificate. From now on theyâll simply sign a liability waiver.\n\nThe Italian Athletics Federation (FIDAL) has amended a regulation which, until now, required organizers to only accept medical certificates that conformed to the Italian legal system.\n\nThis is a really important turning point settled thanks to the intense and favorable cooperation between the Italian Athletics Federation and the event organizers.\n\nFinally, all Italian sports events of international level will have the opportunity to welcome all those foreign citizens, with tourist-sporting goals, who had always run elsewhere due to the Italian bureaucratic difficulties.\n\nThe participation regulations for foreign athletes registered for sports clubs affiliated to foreign federations remain unchanged.\n\nRace news Athens Marathon. The Authentic\n\nAthens Marathon looks forward to record numbers\n\n60,000 participants expected for five-day running festival â AIMS Gala and Symposium\n\nOrganisers of the 37th edition of âAthens Marathon. The Authenticâ expect this year for the first time to welcome 20,000 marathon runners from around the world to run on the original course from Marathon to Athens.\n\nAlmost 125 years since the first Olympic Marathon at the start of the modern Olympic era in Athens in 1896, race organisers SEGAS, the Hellenic Athletics Federation, are anticipating a new record participation.\n\nAdding running events at shorter distances a total of more than 60,000 athletes will run through the Attica region and Athens. This record total puts the Authentic Marathon among the biggest running events anywhere in the world.\n\nThe marathon race begins in its historic setting of the town of Marathon. The marathon course of 42.195k, officially measured by the IAAF and AIMS, is practically identical with that of the 1896 Olympic Marathon and corresponds exactly to the course for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.\n\nTen years ago there were 10,000 athletes running through Athens in races of various distances, but in November this year there will be more than five times as many.\n\nAn innovation this year is that the 10k road race, which hitherto has been staged in parallel with the marathon, will now be run in the early evening on the previous day in central Athens.\n\nThe Marathon Expo where start numbers will be distributed will open on Wednesday, extending the duration of the âAthens Marathon. The Authenticâ to a five instead of four-day programme.\n\nTogether with the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS), the Hellenic Athletics Federation (SEGAS), will once again stage a gala on Friday evening before the Marathon and an international Marathon Symposium on Saturday morning. During the course of the Gala the male and female winners of the annual AIMS Best Marathon Runner Award will be announced.\n\nEvery marathon runner who crosses the finish line in the Panathenaic Stadium on November 10 will receive the first medal of a new series. The concept for the medals covers a period of eight years and will reflect the history of the marathon race. This yearâs medal will show the Battle of Marathon.\n\nRace news Mainova Frankfurt Marathon\n\nFrankfurt: women aim for 2:20 course record\n\nValary Jemeli and Alemu Kebede seen as favourites\n\n2014 TCS New York City Marathon Weekend New York City, New York November 2, 2014 Photo: Andrew McClanahan@PhotoRun vicath1111@aol.com 631-291-3409 www.photorun.NET\n\nPhoto: Andrew McClanahan\n\nÂ© PHOTORUN.NET\n\nCould spectators witness a new womenâs course record at the Mainova Frankfurt Marathon on 27 October? Two women who could be about to produce a world class time of around 2:20 are among the favourites.\n\nValary Jemeli of Kenya has a best of 2:20:53 while her Ethiopian rival Alemu Kebede has achieved 2:22:52. Alemu also showed last weekend that she is in formidable form in preparation for the Mainova Frankfurt Marathon, running her fastest ever half marathon in Copenhagen.\n\nTwo European runners who could also feature are Ana Dulce Felix of Portugal and Britainâs Stephanie Twell as well as the home contender Katharina Steinruck.\n\nâWe have put together a strong womenâs elite field once again and expect a high-class and possibly thrilling race. Our goal is to one day have a sub 2:20 course record. It would of course be great if we could achieve it this year,â said race director Jo Schindler. With 14,000 runners expected to take part, the organisers say places remain available for this IAAF Gold Label race, the top category awarded for road races worldwide.\n\nLast year the Ethiopian Meskerem Assefa improved Frankfurtâs course record to an impressive 2:20:36. It is highly possible that with good weather conditions this time could be under threat on October 27 and the city beside the River Main will stage its first ever sub-2:20 time by a woman. Valary Jemeli has certainly gone close to that barrier on several occasions. The Kenyan has broken 2:22 three times with her best achieved in Berlin two years ago when she finished third in 2:20:53. A strong sign of her potential for sub-2:20 is a personal best of 66:14 for the half marathon, set this year.\n\nA strong performance at half marathon is also a reason for making Alemu Kebede one of the favourites. The Ethiopian finished fourth in a highly competitive womenâs field for the half marathon in Copenhagen last Sunday, improving her personal best to 66:43. In spring this year she set another personal best to win the Rome Marathon in 2:22:52.\n\nAna Dulce Felix has been one of the best European marathon runners for some time now. The 36-year-old Portuguese will be making her debut at the Mainova Frankfurt Marathon. She has a personal best of 2:25:15 and took 16th place in the 2016 Olympic Games marathon in Rio.\n\nA runner who might well use Frankfurt as a springboard to establishing herself among the European Marathon elite is Stephanie Twell. The 30-year-old Briton was once regarded as a potential successor to Paula Radcliffe after some outstanding performances at junior level but subsequently suffered injuries which hindered her development. She made her marathon debut in Valencia last December, finishing seventh in 2:30:14. This could be a good omen for a marathon breakthrough.\n\nKatharina Steinruck will be running the Mainova Frankfurt Marathon for the third year in succession. The 29-year-old competes for the home club Eintracht Frankfurt and is making her first appearance at the distance since heel surgery. Her target will be the qualifying time for the Tokyo Olympics next year which is 2:29:30. Steinruck, better known under her maiden name of Katharina Heinig, has a personal best of 2:28:34.\n\nRace news BMW Berlin-Marathon\n\nBekele hopes to bounce back\n\nDeep Berlin fields headed by Kenenisa Bekele and Gladys Cherono\n\nNext Sunday Kenenisa Bekele hopes to bounce back once again at the BMW Berlin Marathon, a race he won in thrilling fashion three years ago with a personal best of 2:03:03. Gladys Cherono aims to win a fourth Berlin title which would make her the sole record winner of the event.\n\nWhile Vivian Cheruiyot had to cancel her start due to an Achilles tendon problem there are still five women on the start list with personal bests of sub 2:22. Four men feature personal records of sub 2:05, all of them from Ethiopia. A number of athletes will attempt to achieve the Olympic qualifying times of 2:11:30 and 2:29:30 for men and women respectively on the fast Berlin course.\n\nOrganisers recorded a record entry number of 46,983 runners from 150 nations. Along with races in Tokyo, Boston, London, Chicago and New York, the BMW Berlin Marathon is part of the Abbott World Marathon Majors. For the first time the BMW Berlin Marathon will be the final event in this yearâs series.\n\nAfter a series of disappointing results it remains to be seen in what sort of form Kenenisa Bekele is on Sunday. It is likely that his strongest rivals will be fellow Ethiopians. Birhanu Legese took the title in Tokyo in March with 2:04:48. In 2018 he made a spectacular debut with 2:04:15 in Dubai where he was sixth. Two more of the Berlin entries were in action in Dubai in 2018 and ran their personal bests there: Leul Gebrselassie was the runner-up in 2:04:02 while Sisay Lemma clocked 2:04:08 in fifth position. While Felix Kandie, who has a PB of 2:06:03, is the fastest Kenyan on the start list, two fellow countrymen could be in for a surprise â training partners Abel Kipchumba and Bethwel Yegon showed very good form in the build-up to their marathon debuts in Berlin.\n\nAfter victories in 2015 and 2017 Gladys Cherono achieved her third triumph in the BMW Berlin Marathon last year with a course record of 2:18:11. The Kenyan may well have to run another sub 2:20 to win title number four because there is a group of runners who have the potential to achieve such a time as well. One Ethiopians is on the start list, who has already achieved a sub 2:20 time: Mare Dibaba, who won the world marathon title in 2015 and one year later took the bronze medal at the Rio Olympics, has a personal record of 2:19:52. Another prominent Ethiopian athlete on the start list is Meseret Defar. She is the double Olympic 5,000m champion (2004 und 2012). Meseret Defar has the potential to run much faster than her current PB of 2:23:33.\n\nRunning news\n\nWorcester... England?\n\nHilarious transatlantic mix-up for Massachussetts runner\n\nSheila Pereira, a 42-year old American runner from the town of Worcester, Massachusetts, mistakenly entered herself in the Worcester City Half Marathon on 15 September thinking that it was in her home town â rather than 5000km away in the English Midlands.\n\nUndeterred, she recorded a 21.1km route on Strava that she ran on the same day as the race and sent it to the organisers as proof of her âparticipationâ in the event. They responded by sending her a finishersâ T-shirt and medal accompanied by a message inviting her to come over for next yearâs race.\n\nNo Boston Marathon entrant would make the mistake of entering the UK Marathon of the same name, which advertises itself as the flattest marathon in the country, but the Worcester event’s website uses the generic â.comâ suffix rather than â.co.ukâ which might have alerted Ms Pereira to the location. The name of the race organisers, âEvents of the Northâ, may have served to confuse â as the English Worcester is very much in the Midlands, while there are only six states in the continental USA wholly north of Massachusetts.\n\nRace news Valencia Trinidad Alfonso Marathon\n\nValencia races follow majors in fight against doping\n\nCooperation with AIU to create ârobust anti-doping programmeâ\n\nOrganisers of the Valencia Marathon Trinidad Alfonso EDP and Half Marathon have taken a new collaborative step to boost the fight against doping.\n\nThe organisers, running club SD Correcaminos and Valencia City Council have signed an agreement with the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), a body that is independent of the IAAF, to make extra-tough checks for the races, which will be held on the 27th of October and the 1st of December in Valencia â Ciudad del Running.\n\nThe agreement was promoted by FundaciÃ³n Trinidad Alfonso, the main collaborator in both races, to join with SD Correcaminos to ensure fair play in the sport.\n\nThe organisers of both races will make a voluntary contribution of EUR 25,000 to the AIU to carry out spot anti-doping checks of the main guest runners with a view to detecting illegal and fraudulent practices and thus protect the integrity and reputation of the two Valencian races.\n\nThis agreement follows the strategy adopted by the World Marathon Majors in their fight against doping, given that the world’s best marathons have also signed similar agreements with the AIU.\n\nThe Athletics Integrity Unit has undertaken to carry out all measures bearing on checking athletes’ biological passports, and to conduct the various routine anti-doping tests. SD Correcaminos in turn will give the AIU its full support and supply technical data on the elite athletes, their travel plans, stop-overs, etc. to order to facilitate testing and boost its efficacy.\n\nBeyond the terms of the agreement and on its own initiative, the organisers of the 2019 Valencia Marathon Trinidad Alfonso EDP and Half Marathon have also decided not to invite professional athletes who have been found guilty of doping. The idea is to send a clear message: Valencia only wants athletes who set records based upon exemplary conduct and fair play.\n\nUnder the agreement signed with the AIU, the trials will boost the fight against doping and ensure equality of opportunities for all those taking part to set records that reflect the highest sporting standards.\n\nâI want to thank the organisers of the Valencia marathon for making this commitment to clean sport. The MoU once again showcases that the key stakeholders in road running are being proactive in addressing integrity challenges in this segment of the sport of athletics,â commented Brett Clothier, Head of the AIU. âThe 2019 editions of these races will be amongst the most well controlled sporting events in the world from an anti-doping perspective. And the exciting thing is that in 2020 many other road race events under the IAAF Label Road Races program will be able to join them in making this claim,â he added.\n\nPresident of SD Correcaminos Paco Borao added: âI am very happy to embark on this relationship with the AIU. This is important for the credibility of our races and our sport. As President of AIMS (Association of International Marathons and Distance Races) Iâd also like to encourage our members to also commit themselves to this funding mechanism and participate fully in the fight against doping in road running.â\n\nDate changes Athens Half Marathon\n\nRace date for Athens Half Marathon (GRE) changed\n\nAthens Half Marathon date change\n\nThe Athens Half Marathon (GRE) will take place on Sun 22 March 2020, not Sun 15 March 2020 as previously published.\n\nRace news Copenhagen Half Marathon\n\nKamworor sets new world record of 58:01 in the half marathon\n\nCopenhagen sees Abraham Kiptumâs previous 58:18 record smashed\n\nGeoffrey Kamworor set a new world record of 58:01\n\nÂ© Matthew James Photography\n\nGeoffrey Kamworor set a new world record of 58:01 at the Copenhagen Half Marathon on 15 September taking 17 seconds off the 58:18 run by Abraham Kiptum in the Valencia Half Marathon last year.\n\nThe 26-year-old Kenyan returned to the Danish capital, where he won the first of his three world half-marathon titles, to run his first non-championship half marathon for almost five years.\n\nAfter passing 5km (13:53) in a large group in Kamworor edged the pace up to pass 10km in 27:34 and find himself heading the field. His reaction was to redouble the effort as he forged clear with a 13:31 split for 10â15km â all the more remarkable for having to battle through a brief but heavy shower in the 14th kilometre. His time at 15km (41:05) was the fastest ever recorded for the distance.\n\nOver the final 5km his pace dropped marginally but he passed 20km (55.00) in another âworld bestâ before breaking the tape and the world record, 75 seconds (450m) ahead of second-placed Bernard Kipkorir.\n\nâIt is very emotional for me to set this record.

The operation will involve logistics personnel, police officers and more than 150 traffic agents with units that will support the route as it passes through MedellÃ­n, Envigado and Sabaneta. The main deployment will be in the streets of the race, where total closures will be mounted on the vast majority of the roads and an important medical reinforcement with ambulances, roadside assistance posts and expert personnel led by the VigÃ­as Group and with the support from CES University.\n\nGustavo Orozco explained that public transport services will be limited between 05:00 and 13:00 and runners will be invited to use the Metro, reaching the finish line through San Antonio station.\n\nIn the first edition of the event in 1995, two thousand people from five countries participated â and only a 1/3 marathon was run, i.e. 14 kilometres. The 21K was added the following year.\n\nBy 2013, the Marathon had the participation of more than 12 thousand athletes and in 2018 it approached 15 thousand athletes from Colombia and abroad. In the celebration of its 25 years, the Medellin Marathon 2019 hopes to reach a new participation record.\n\nRace news\n\nCome out and support runners, says Cape Town\n\nSpectator zones set up\n\nSanlam Cape Town Marathon\n\nPhoto: Brenton Geach +27 (0)721971266\n\nÂ© Brenton Geach\n\nIn a little under two weeksâ time, on Sunday 15 September, the Sanlam Cape Town Marathon will take place in the âMother Cityâ.\n\nRace organisers have called on local residents to come out and cheer on the more than 26,000 runners in the race, which organisers say is fast becoming known as Africaâs âmust-runâ city marathon.\n\nOlympic long-distance runner Elana van Zyl-Meyer, ambassador for the marathon, knows from personal experience what goes into preparation for an undertaking of this kind, and how important spectators are on the big day. âA marathon is a long personal journey.

As such, along with his wife Ruth, he mounted a successful bid to host the 14th World Congress of AIMS at the Sheraton by the Falls Hotel in Niagara Falls, Ontario (CAN) in October 2002.\n\nHe was prominent in helping many other races in the local area and developed many friendships within AIMS through his regular attendance at AIMS Congresses right through from the 12th Congress in Turin (ITA) 2001 to the 20th Congress in Durban (RSA) 2014.\n\nOriginally from Scotland, Jim migrated to Canada at the age of 21. He settled at Niagara Falls and threw himself into voluntary work in support of the local community. He was an active sportsman and a particularly keen runner and member of the Niagara Track Club. His athletic interests gradually evolved into a second career as race director of the Niagara Falls Marathon.\n\nBoth Ruth and Jim regularly helped their close friends Les and Buffy Wright at the Lake Tahoe Marathon and often came to Maui to assist with the Maui Oceanfront Marathon.\n\nJim fought and survived prostate cancer back in 2007 and more recently had a heart valve replaced. He died on 23 August 2019 from a heart infection and kidney failure.\n\nDate changes Milton Keynes Marathon & Half Marathon\n\nRace date for Milton Keynes Marathon & Half Marathon (GBR) changed\n\nMilton Keynes Marathon & Half date change\n\nThe Milton Keynes Marathon & Half Marathon (GBR) will take place Sat 2 May 2020âSun 3 May 2020, not from 3 Mayâ4 May as previously published.\n\nRunning news\n\nOn the pill\n\nInnovation in temperature monitoring\n\nBeing âon the pillâ might soon start to have an entirely new meaning for athletes.\n\nThis pill is a piece of electronic gadgetry that athletes would take few hours before competing in unusually hot conditions â like those likely to be faced in the upcoming IAAF World Championships in Doha, Qatar and next year in the Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\nThe pill is designed to detect and relay the athlete’s core body temperature so that they can be monitored to safeguard against heat exhaustion. The pill passes through the digestive system in the normal way, and would be excreted sometime between 12â48 hours after the race.\n\nThe pills have already been trialled by some national federations in the endurance events â primarily Marathon and Walks â and will be offered to athletes on a voluntary basis at the World Championships in Doha starting at the ends of September.\n\nRace news Copenhagen Half Marathon\n\nSuper fast Norwegian runner for CPH Half\n\nSondre Moen hopes to triumph in Copenhagen\n\nA Nordic runner, who can keep up with the East African runners? The answer is Norwegian Sondre Moen, who has been confirmed to line up at the Copenhagen Half Marathon in September.\n\nSondre Moen established his name on the international running scene back in 2017. First he clocked 59:48 minutes on the half marathon distance. Only a month later, he won the Fukuola Marathon in Japan to set a a new European record.\n\nOn that occasion, he defeated both Stephan Kiprotich from Uganda, a former Olympic and World half marathon Champion, and Bedan Karoki from Kenya, who earlier that year came second at London Marathon.\n\nNow he has the third fastest half marathon time in Europe ever and was the first non-African athlete to break 2:06 on the marathon distance.\n\nSince his breakthrough, Sondre Moen has been injured for periods, but now he is back in shape and ready to run fast at the CPH Half.\n\nâIt is a flat course with Nordic weather conditions and a strong field that will be running fast. That is what Iâm looking forward to about the CPH Half. And if itâs the right day, I might even set a new personal best,â says Sondre Moen.\n\nâMy season started out well as I set a new Norwegian 5 km record with a time of 13:37. In March, I won a half marathon in Gdynia clocking 61:18 on a hilly and windy course. My training went well, but then I was injured, and was unable to prepare for the track season,â says the Norwegian super runner.\n\nNonetheless, Sondre Moen has just won the Norwegian 10,000 metres championships and came in third on the 5,000 metres.\n\nHis focus is on the longer distances, which is where his has his strengths as a runner.\n\nâI like to run for hours in a fast pace but without a sprint finish, which makes me better over long distances such as half marathon and marathon,â says Sondre Moen. âI have a great base after 10-15 years of training, and I am confident that I will be back stronger than ever. My dream is to win an Olympic marathon medal,â he says.\n\nRace news KoÅ¡ice Peace Marathon\n\nIn KoÅ¡ice 30 years ago\n\nPeace Marathon at a turning point in history\n\nIn 1989 the KoÅ¡ice Peace Marathon was held just a few weeks before the âVelvet Revolutionâ, which brought radical changes in what was then Czechoslovak society.\n\nThe race also had a radical change of its own. After 63 years the course was changed from simply going out-back to the turnaround point at SeÅa to a loop almost entirely within the city. This, later modified and improved several times, remains the basis of the present course.\n\nThe 1989 event was only the ninth edition to incorporate a womenâs race and the winner this time was home-grown Alena PeterkovÃ¡ in a new course record of 2:31:28 â nearly nine minutes ahead of her North Korean competition. Her record lasted 20 years. PeterkovÃ¡ later placed fourth at Boston in a personal best of 2:25:16.\n\nAnother home grown runner, Karel David, won the menâs race. In an even-paced run he beat his Soviet competition by 13 seconds. It was the 12th Czechoslovak victory in the menâs race, achieved by nine different runners. At the time David ranked among the best marathoners in Europe. He started the Olympic Marathons in Seoul and Barcelona and won marathons in Vienna, Bonn and Palermo. In 1991 in Tokyo he ran a personal best of 2:11:12.\n\n970 men and 31 women crossed the finish line that year which was again located at Lokomotive Stadium.\n\nDate changes\n\nRace date for Sfax Marathon Olive Trees (TUN) changed\n\nSfax Marathon Olive Trees date change\n\nPhoto: Zaber Kammoun\n\nThe Sfax Marathon Olive Trees (TUN) will take place on Sun 3 November 2019, not Sun 13 October 2019 as previously published.\n\nLives remembered\n\nRosie Ruiz, Marathon imposter\n\n21 June 1953 â 7 July 2019\n\nFamous for all the wrong reasons, Cuban-American Rosie Ruiz died on 7 July this year, 39 years after her impersonation of a Marathon winner in the 1980 BAA Boston Marathon.\n\nShe did not look the part as she crossed the finish line, without showing the least sign of distress, in 2:31:56 â well ahead of the race favourite Jacqui Gareau of Canada.\n\nGareau protested that she had not been overtaken during the race by any other female. Testimony from spectators who had seen Ruiz âjump inâ to the race only a few hundred metres from the finish soon made it look like a clear case of cheating. But this was after she had been âcrownedâ with a laurel wreath and presented with a winnerâs medal.\n\nShe basked in her âvictoryâ during a TV interview and some reporters ran with the story that a new marathon star was born. Others were unconvinced. Even for just a two-time marathon finisher she was totally ignorant about the sport â even what shoes she wore (âBrookes Brothersâ rather than Brooks the athletic brand).\n\nThen a photographer came forward who had travelled with Ruiz on the New York Subway during her purported participation in the race a few months previously (in order to qualify for the Boston Marathon). In a tradition started in the early Olympic Games Marathons (1806, 1904) she had taken a ride for most of the route and covered only the last few hundred metres of the race, then acted out the same deceit in Boston.\n\nIt took a week before Boston Marathon organisers awarded the victory to Gareau but Ruiz would not admit her guilt and never returned her medal.\n\nLives remembered\n\nAn Olympic peak in British Marathon running\n\nBasil Heatley, 25 December 1933 â 3 August 2019\n\nThe three winners of the marathon event at the Tokyo Olympics stand side by side on the rostrum, 23rd October 1964.

Bikila also set a world record of 2 hours, 12.11 minutes. (Photo by Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\n\nÂ© Getty Images\n\nBenjamin Basil Heatley was a British runner who mainly competed in the marathon. Born in Kenilworth in the English Midlands he competed for the renowned club Coventry Godiva.\n\nHe filled the void left by the retirement of Jim Peters in 1954 and before Ron Hill and Heatleyâs clubmate Bill Adcocks had seriously tested themselves at the Marathon. Hill finished 17 places behind Heatley in the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Marathon while Adcocks only made his debut at the distance that year.\n\nOn 13 June 1964 Heatley broke the world record for the marathon on the famous Polytechnic Marathon course from Windsor Castle to Polytechnic Stadium in Chiswick, West London. His 2:13:55 surpassed Buddy Edelenâs (an American runner long resident in UK) world best from the previous yearâs race by 33 seconds.\n\nFour months later, on 21 October 1964, Heatley ran in the Tokyo Olympic Marathon â where defending champion Abebe Bikila won another Olympic gold medal in another world record time (2:12:11).

Thereâs not much likelihood of a world record attempt but the times are likely to be very fast. In addition, the battle for victory could be a thrilling one that may well last until the final few kilometres,â said the race director Mark Milde, who is still recruiting more top performers.\n\nIn the past ten years Ethiopian runners have only won the menâs title in Berlin on two occasions. Haile Gebrselassie won in 2009 and Kenenisa Bekele in 2016. Otherwise Kenyans have dominated, breaking the world record four times. The most recent occasion was last year when Eliud Kipchoge ran a sensational 2:01:39 but he will not be running this year.\n\nBirhanu Legese is the one runner among the Ethiopian quartet who has won an Abbott World Marathon Majors race this year. The 24-year-old took the title in Tokyo in March with 2:04:48 in only the third marathon of his career. In 2018 he made a spectacular debut with 2:04:15 in Dubai which put him straightaway among the marathon world-class. Even so, his time was only good enough for sixth in an extraordinarily fast race. Legese has already won one big race in Berlin, emerging as the surprise winner of the cityâs Half Marathon with 59:45 in 2015.\n\nTwo more of the quartet for Berlin on September 29 were in action in Dubai 2018 and ran their personal bests there: Leul Gebrselassie and Sisay Lemma. Gebrselassie is not related to the former marathon world record holder and multiple Berlin winner Haile, but has strong credentials of his own, finishing runner-up in 2:04:02 in the race in the United Arab Emirates 18 months ago. In December the 25-year-old confirmed his ability in setting a course record of 2:04:31 to win the Valencia Marathon. In April this year he finished eighth in Londonâs traditionally highly competitive field.\n\nSisay Lemma improved his best by a big margin to 2:04:08 to finish fifth in Dubai in 2018. At the end of last October the 28-year-old produced another fine performance to break the course record in Ljubljana with 2:04:58. Three years ago he was fourth in the BMW Berlin-Marathon with 2:06:56. He marked 2015 with victories in Vienna and Frankfurt marathons.\n\nGuye Adola has every reason to have fond memories of Berlin on his return to the race. Two years ago the 28-year-old ran an unofficial world record debut to finish second in 2:03:46 â official world records for marathon debuts are not given. He even managed to put a superstar such as Eliud Kipchoge under pressure, leading until just before 40k from the Kenyan. Since that debut the Half Marathon World Championship bronze medallist in 2014 has struggled with injuries but Adola intends to put all that behind him at the BMW Berlin-Marathon this year.\n\nAIMS news\n\nCoveted AIMS awards open for nominations\n\nPreparations begin for Best Marathon Runner Awards Gala\n\n2018-11-10: Recipients of Green Award from the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races at its gala in Athens, Greece.\n\nMember races of the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS) have been encouraged to submit nominations for this yearâs gala awards.\n\nThe Special Awards â the Green Award, Social Award and Lifetime Achievement Award â will be presented at the annual AIMS gala in November in Athens, Greece, together with the Best Marathon Runner award which is given each year to the worldâs most outstanding distance athletes.\n\nAIMS President Paco Borao urged the associationâs member races to consider entering for the Special Awards, which recognise outstanding efforts in the areas of ecology and social engagement.\n\nThe Best Marathon Runner Awards Gala on Friday 8 November, now taking place for the seventh time, is followed by the AIMS Marathon Symposium on Saturday 9 November, at which race representatives and guest experts discuss developments in distance running.\n\nPaco Borao said in a letter to member races: âContinuing and developing the close collaboration we set up back in 2007 along with our friends here in Greece the Hellenic Athletics Federation and âAthens Marathon. The Authenticâ, we have already started the preparations for the 7th edition of the AIMS Best Marathon Runner Awards Gala and the 13th AIMS Marathon Symposium. Along with the important support of the Region of Attica as Co-Organiser and the significant help of the Greek National Tourism Organisation and Athens International Airport as official sponsors, we are all working towards this direction to organize successful events, promoting our sport Marathon as the previous years.â\n\nThe topic of the Marathon Symposium this year is âTechnology and Mass Running Eventsâ. Afterwards race delegates will have the opportunity to attend the Marathon Flame lighting at the Marathon Tomb archaeological site. Finally, on Sunday 10 November the host race, âAthens Marathon. The Authenticâ takes place.\n\nRace news\n\nPalestine Marathon now nearly 50% female\n\nOrganisers hope to reach 50:50 and 10,000 participants in 2020\n\nPhoto: RASHED K MARIE\n\nÂ© RASHED MARIE\n\nThe Palestine Marathon has evolved rapidly over the years. In seven years, the total number of participants has increased from 400 to over 8,000.\n\nThe percentage of female runners has increased from 37 percent to almost 50 percent (which is significant because the denial of free movement is a feature of sex inequality in Palestinian society and hinders efforts to ensure respect for the rights of women), and the number of foreign runners has increased from 220 to 1,700, helping Palestinian efforts to tell their story and r"
