        "text": "Bloodstain pattern analysis--casework experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarger, B; Rand, S; Fracasso, T; Pfeiffer, H\n\n2008-10-25\n\nThe morphology of bloodstain distribution patterns at the crime scene carries vital information for a reconstruction of the events. Contrary to experimental work, case reports where the reconstruction has been verified have rarely been published. This is the reason why a series of four illustrative cases is presented where bloodstain pattern analysis at the crime scene made a reconstruction of the events possible and where this reconstruction was later verified by a confession of the offender. The cases include various types of bloodstains such as contact and smear stains, drop stains, arterial blood spatter and splash stains from both impact and cast-off pattern. Problems frequently encountered in practical casework are addressed, such as unfavourable environmental conditions or combinations of different bloodstain patterns. It is also demonstrated that the analysis of bloodstain morphology can support individualisation of stains by directing the selection of a limited number of stains from a complex pattern for DNA analysis. The complexity of real situations suggests a step-by-step approach starting with a comprehensive view of the overall picture. This is followed by a differentiation and analysis of single bloodstain patterns and a search for informative details. It is ideal when the expert inspecting the crime scene has also performed the autopsy, but he definitely must have detailed knowledge of the injuries of the deceased/injured and of the possible mechanisms of production.\n\nExploring the role of contextual information in bloodstain pattern analysis: A qualitative approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nOsborne, Nikola K P; Taylor, Michael C; Zajac, Rachel\n\n2016-03-01\n\nDuring Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA), an analyst may encounter various sources of contextual information. Although contextual bias has emerged as a valid concern for the discipline, little is understood about how contextual information informs BPA. To address this issue, we asked 15 experienced bloodstain pattern analysts from New Zealand and Australia to think aloud as they classified bloodstain patterns from two homicide cases. Analysts could request items of contextual information, and were required to state how each item would inform their analysis. Pathology reports and additional photographs of the scene were the most commonly requested items of information. We coded analysts' reasons for requesting contextual information--and the way in which they integrated this information--according to thematic analysis. We identified considerable variation in both of these variables, raising important questions about the role and necessity of contextual information in decisions about bloodstain pattern evidence.

At present, it is unclear exactly which stain or pattern properties and their associated values are most relevant to analysts when classifying a bloodstain pattern. Eye tracking technology has been widely used to investigate human perception and cognition. Its application to forensics, however, is limited. This is the first study to use eye tracking as a tool for gaining access to the mindset of the bloodstain pattern expert. An eye tracking method was used to follow the gaze of 24 bloodstain pattern analysts during an assigned task of classifying a laboratory-generated test bloodstain pattern. With the aid of an automated image-processing methodology, the properties of selected features of the pattern were quantified leading to the delineation of areas of interest (AOIs). Eye tracking data were collected for each AOI and combined with verbal statements made by analysts after the classification task to determine the critical range of values for relevant diagnostic features. Eye-tracking data indicated that there were four main regions of the pattern that analysts were most interested in. Within each region, individual elements or groups of elements that exhibited features associated with directionality, size, colour and shape appeared to capture the most interest of analysts during the classification task. The study showed that the eye movements of trained bloodstain pattern experts and their verbal descriptions of a pattern were well correlated.\n\nHemoVision: An automated and virtual approach to bloodstain pattern analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nJoris, Philip; Develter, Wim; Jenar, Els; Suetens, Paul; Vandermeulen, Dirk; Van de Voorde, Wim; Claes, Peter\n\n2015-06-01\n\nBloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) is a subspecialty of forensic sciences, dealing with the analysis and interpretation of bloodstain patterns in crime scenes. The aim of BPA is uncovering new information about the actions that took place in a crime scene, potentially leading to a confirmation or refutation of a suspect's statement. A typical goal of BPA is to estimate the flight paths for a set of stains, followed by a directional analysis in order to estimate the area of origin for the stains. The traditional approach, referred to as stringing, consists of attaching a piece of string to each stain, and letting the string represent an approximation of the stain's flight path. Even though stringing has been used extensively, many (practical) downsides exist. We propose an automated and virtual approach, employing fiducial markers and digital images. By automatically reconstructing a single coordinate frame from several images, limited user input is required. Synthetic crime scenes were created and analysed in order to evaluate the approach. Results demonstrate the correct operation and practical advantages, suggesting that the proposed approach may become a valuable asset for practically analysing bloodstain spatter patterns. Accompanying software called HemoVision is currently provided as a demonstrator and will be further developed for practical use in forensic investigations. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This has generally involved the application of suitable image-processing methods to provide numerical data for identification or comparison. This paper outlines a unique image-processing methodology that can be utilised by analysts to generate reliable pattern data that will assist them in forming objective conclusions about a pattern. A range of features were defined and extracted from a laboratory-generated impact spatter pattern. These features were based in part on bloodstain properties commonly used in the analysis of spatter bloodstain patterns. The values of these features were consistent with properties reported qualitatively for such patterns. The image-processing method developed shows considerable promise as a way to establish measurable discriminating pattern criteria that are lacking in current bloodstain pattern taxonomies.

Passive bloodstains are not yet well understood. Accordingly the purpose of this research is to provide new tools to forensic investigators in the analysis of bloodstains arising from blood droplets dripping naturally. The study aims to understand the link between the final dried pattern of a passive bloodstain and its impact energy. Currently no such tool exists, and no correlation has yet been proven. This research was therefore focusing on a new parameter, the thicker outer rim observed on the dried final pattern. To do so, we created several passive bloodstains with different impact energies. A correlation was highlighted between the inner diameter, the maximum spreading diameter, the initial diameter of a blood droplet and its impact energy. This correlation shows how the drying mechanism of a blood droplet is influenced by its impact energy as it alters the red blood cells dispersion inside the droplet. The biological deposit and the final dried pattern are subsequently modified.

To determine where the blood source was investigators use a straight-line approximation for the trajectory, ignoring effects of gravity and drag and thus overestimating the height of the source. We determined how accurately the location of the origin can be estimated when including gravity and drag into the trajectory reconstruction. We created eight bloodstain patterns at one meter distance from the wall. The originâs location was determined for each pattern with: the straight-line approximation, our method including gravity, and our method including both gravity and drag. The latter two methods require the volume and impact velocity of each bloodstain, which we are able to determine with a 3D scanner and advanced fluid dynamics, respectively. We conclude that by including gravity and drag in the trajectory calculation, the originâs location can be determined roughly four times more accurately than with the straight-line approximation. Our study enables investigators to determine if the victim was sitting or standing, or it might be possible to connect wounds on the body to specific patterns, which is important for crime scene reconstruction.

Here, we explored accuracy and contextual influence in bloodstain pattern classification, and how these variables might relate to analyst characteristics. Thirty-nine bloodstain pattern analysts with varying degrees of experience each completed measures of compliance, decision-making style, and need for closure. Analysts then examined a bloodstain pattern without any additional contextual information, and allocated votes to listed pattern types according to favoured and less favoured classifications. Next, if they believed it would assist with their classification, analysts could request items of contextual information - from commonly encountered sources of information in bloodstain pattern analysis - and update their vote allocation. We calculated a shift score for each item of contextual information based on vote reallocation. Almost all forms of contextual information influenced decision-making, with medical findings leading to the highest shift scores. Although there was a small positive association between shift scores and the degree to which analysts displayed an intuitive decision-making style, shift scores did not vary meaningfully as a function of experience or the other characteristics measured. Almost all of the erroneous classifications were made by novice analysts. Copyright Â© 2016 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, bloodstain patterns can be altered in the presence of insects and can confound crime scene reconstruction. To address this problem, we conducted a series of controlled laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of Lucilia sericata (Meigen) on impact bloodstains and pooled bloodstains in association with three combinations of common surfaces (linoleum/painted drywall, wood floor/wallpaper, and carpet/wood paneling). L. sericata fed from the pooled bloodstains and added insect stains through regurgitation and defecation of consumed blood. L. sericata formed defecatory trails of insect stains that indicated directionality. Defecatory stains fluoresced when viewed at 465 nm with an orange filter. These observations differed from Calliphora vicina insect stains because feeding on blood spatter was not observed and trails of insect stains were formed by L. sericata. The fluorescence of defecatory stains can be used as a method to detect insect stains and discriminate them from real bloodstains.

Despite its development through the years, the method has been re-formulated a standard one and globally used, recognized in standard sheets. This method permits exact analysis of the dynamic and characteristic properties of bloodstains after impact on surfaces such as floors, walls, and ceilings, various exterior and interior items, and clothes. It is also possible to determine the characteristics of blood from the outer part of the body. According to the presence of blood and its quantity, it is also possible to use this method for verification of reconstruction of criminal acts, while being tested for its validity with primary conditions of preserved and readable traces of blood. Even though this method is not considered as the major one or the only one information obtained in this way can be used for judicial. In our research, we tested the validity of this method in an experimental model using firearms. We compared measurements of the lengths of trajectory of impact and the height of the blood sprayed upwards from a distance of 1, 3, 5 and 10 meters. The experiment was based on two main presumptions. The first was the knowledge of the value of the distance and the angle of impact of the bloodstain, the second, the ability of the blood to reach a certain height and the angle of its impact. In accordance with trigonometric formulas, both the impact of the selected distance of drops of blood, and the height of the selected bloodstain could be determined without any verification of the flight trajectory and the distance of bloodstains. The results indicate that the method for these requirements differs from the real values, while increasing the measurements with the indicated spot of the shot. Aside from the unique values which were calculated, other results of the impact of the distance of drops of bloodstain were considered of\n\nInterpreting the formation of bloodstains on selected apparel fabrics.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Castro, Therese; Nickson, Tania; Carr, Debra; Knock, Clare\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) is the investigation and interpretation of blood deposited at crime scenes. However, the interaction of blood and apparel fabrics has not been widely studied. In this work, the development of bloodstains (passive, absorbed and transferred) dropped from three different heights (500, 1,000, 1,500 mm) on two cotton apparel fabrics (1âÃâ1 rib knit, drill) was investigated. High-speed video was used to investigate the interaction of the blood and fabric at impact. The effect of drop height on the development of passive, absorbed and transferred bloodstains was investigated using image analysis and statistical tools. Visually, the passive bloodstain patterns produced on the technical face of fabrics from the different drop heights were similar. The blood soaked unequally through to the technical rear of both fabrics. Very little blood was transferred between a bloody fabric and a second piece of fabric. Statistically, drop height did not affect the size of the parent bloodstain (wet or dry), but did affect the number of satellite bloodstains formed. Some differences between the two fabrics were noted, therefore fabric structure and properties must be considered when conducting BPA on apparel fabrics.\n\nEffect of fabric mounting method and backing material on bloodstain patterns of drip stains on textiles.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, J Y M; Michielsen, S\n\n2016-05-01\n\nTextiles may provide valuable bloodstain evidence to help piece together events or activities at violent crime scenes. However, in spite of over 75 years of research, there are still difficulties encountered in many cases in the interpretation and identification of bloodstains on textiles. In this study, we dripped porcine blood onto three types of fabric (plain woven, single jersey knit, and denim) that are supported in four different ways (hard, taut, loose, and semi-hard, i.e., fabric laid on denim). These four mounting methods represent different ways in which a textile may be present when blood from a violent act lands on it. This study investigates how the fabric mounting method and backing material affect the appearance of drip stains on textiles. We found that bloodstain patterns formed on fabric lying flat on a hard surface were very different from when the same fabric was suspended loosely. We also found that bloodstains formed on the technical back of single jersey knit were vastly different from those on the technical face. Interestingly, some drip stains showed blood passing through the textile and leaving a stain behind it that resembled insect stains. By observing, recording, and describing how a blood stained textile is found or presented at the scene, the analyst may be able to better understand bloodstains and bloodstain patterns on textiles, which could be useful to confirm or refute a witness's account of how blood came to be where it was found after a bloodshed event.\n\nApplication of multi-resolution 3D techniques in crime scene documentation with bloodstain pattern analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoÅowko, Elwira; Januszkiewicz, Kamil; Bolewicki, PaweÅ; Sitnik, Robert; MichoÅski, Jakub\n\n2016-10-01\n\nIn forensic documentation with bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) it is highly desirable to obtain non-invasively overall documentation of a crime scene, but also register in high resolution single evidence objects, like bloodstains. In this study, we propose a hierarchical 3D scanning platform designed according to the top-down approach known from the traditional forensic photography. The overall 3D model of a scene is obtained via integration of laser scans registered from different positions. Some parts of a scene being particularly interesting are documented using midrange scanner, and the smallest details are added in the highest resolution as close-up scans. The scanning devices are controlled using developed software equipped with advanced algorithms for point cloud processing. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of multi-resolution 3D scanning in crime scene documentation, our platform was applied to document a murder scene simulated by the BPA experts from the Central Forensic Laboratory of the Police R&D, Warsaw, Poland. Applying the 3D scanning platform proved beneficial in the documentation of a crime scene combined with BPA. The multi-resolution 3D model enables virtual exploration of a scene in a three-dimensional environment, distance measurement, and gives a more realistic preservation of the evidences together with their surroundings. Moreover, high-resolution close-up scans aligned in a 3D model can be used to analyze bloodstains revealed at the crime scene. The result of BPA such as trajectories, and the area of origin are visualized and analyzed in an accurate model of a scene. At this stage, a simplified approach considering the trajectory of blood drop as a straight line is applied. Although the 3D scanning platform offers a new quality of crime scene documentation with BPA, some of the limitations of the technique are also mentioned. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

They can be used for DNA-profiling for verifying the suspect's identity or for pattern analysis in order to reconstruct the crime. However, until now, using bloodstains to determine the time elapsed since the crime was committed is still not possible. From a criminalistic point of view, an accurate estimation of when the crime was committed enables to verify witnesses' statements, limits the number of suspects and assesses alibis. Despite several attempts and exploration of many technologies during a century, no method has been materialized into forensic practice. This review gives an overview of an extensive search in scientific literature of techniques that address the quest for age determination of bloodstains. We found that most techniques are complementary to each other, in short as well as long term age determination. Techniques are compared concerning their sensitivity for short and long term ageing of bloodstains and concerning their possible applicability to be used on a crime scene. In addition, experimental challenges like substrate variation, interdonor variation and environmental influences are addressed. Comparison of these techniques contributes to our knowledge of the physics and biochemistry in an ageing bloodstain. Further improvement and incorporation of environmental factors are necessary to enable age determination of bloodstains to be acceptable in court. Copyright ÃÂ© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The need for better integrating FD and BPA is mentioned in a 2009 report by the US National Research Council, entitled ``Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward''. BPA aims for practical answers to specific questions of the kind: ``How did a bloodletting incident happen?'' FD, on the other hand, aims to quantitatively describe the transport of fluids and the related causes, with general equations. BPA typically solves the indirect problem of inspecting stains in a crime scene to infer the most probable bloodletting incident that produced these patterns. FD typically defines the initial and boundary conditions of a fluid system and from there describe how the system evolves in time and space, most often in a deterministic manner. We review four topics in BPA with strong connections to FD: the generation of drops, their flight, their impact and the formation of stains. Future research on these topics would deliver new quantitative tools and methods for BPA, and present new multiphase flow problems for FD.\n\nAge estimation of bloodstains using smartphones and digital image analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nThanakiatkrai, Phuvadol; Yaodam, Alisa; Kitpipit, Thitika\n\n2013-12-10\n\nRecent studies on bloodstains have focused on determining the time since deposition of bloodstains, which can provide useful temporal information to forensic investigations. This study is the first to use smartphone cameras in combination with a truly low-cost illumination system as a tool to estimate the age of bloodstains. Bloodstains were deposited on various substrates and photographed with a smartphone camera. Three smartphones (Samsung Galaxy S Plus, Apple iPhone 4, and Apple iPad 2) were compared. The environmental effects - temperature, humidity, light exposure, and anticoagulant - on the bloodstain age estimation process were explored. The color values from the digital images were extracted and correlated with time since deposition. Magenta had the highest correlation (R(2)=0.966) and was used in subsequent experiments. The Samsung Galaxy S Plus was the most suitable smartphone as its magenta decreased exponentially with increasing time and had highest repeatability (low variation within and between pictures). The quantifiable color change observed is consistent with well-established hemoglobin denaturation process. Using a statistical classification technique called Random Forestsâ¢, we could predict bloodstain age accurately up to 42 days with an error rate of 12%. Additionally, the age of forty blind stains were all correctly predicted, and 83% of mock casework samples were correctly classified. No within- and between-person variations were observed (p>0.05), while smartphone camera, temperature, humidity, and substrate color influenced the age determination process in different ways. Our technique provides a cheap, rapid, easy-to-use, and truly portable alternative to more complicated analysis using specialized equipment, e.g. spectroscopy and HPLC. No training is necessary with our method, and we envision a smartphone application that could take user inputs of environmental factors and provide an accurate estimate of bloodstain age.

Upon exiting the body, bloodstains transit from bright red to dark brown, which is attributed to oxidation of oxy-hemoglobin (HbO(2)) to met-hemoglobin (met-Hb) and hemichrome (HC). The fractions of HbO(2), met-Hb and HC in a bloodstain can be used for age determination of bloodstains. In this study, we further analyze the conversion of HbO(2) to met-Hb and HC, and determine the effect of temperature and humidity on the conversion rates. The fractions of HbO(2), met-Hb and HC in a bloodstain, as determined by quantitative analysis of optical reflectance spectra (450-800 nm), were measured as function of age, temperature and humidity. Additionally, Optical Coherence Tomography around 1300 nm was used to confirm quantitative spectral analysis approach. The oxidation rate of HbO(2) in bloodstains is biphasic. At first, the oxidation of HbO(2) is rapid, but slows down after a few hours. These oxidation rates are strongly temperature dependent. However, the oxidation of HbO(2) seems to be independent of humidity, whereas the transition of met-Hb into HC strongly depends on humidity. Knowledge of these decay rates is indispensable for translating laboratory results into forensic practice, and to enable bloodstain age determination on the crime scene.\n\nDetection of latent bloodstains beneath painted surfaces using reflected infrared photography.\n\nPubMed\n\nFarrar, Andrew; Porter, Glenn; Renshaw, Adrian\n\n2012-09-01\n\nBloodstain evidence is a highly valued form of physical evidence commonly found at scenes involving violent crimes. However, painting over bloodstains will often conceal this type of evidence. There is limited research in the scientific literature that describes methods of detecting painted-over bloodstains. This project employed a modified digital single-lens reflex camera to investigate the effectiveness of infrared (IR) photography in detecting latent bloodstain evidence beneath a layer or multiple layers of paint. A qualitative evaluation was completed by comparing images taken of a series of samples using both IR and standard (visible light) photography. Further quantitative image analysis was used to verify the findings. Results from this project indicate that bloodstain evidence can be detected beneath up to six layers of paint using reflected IR; however, the results vary depending on the characteristics of the paint. This technique provides crime scene specialists with a new field method to assist in locating, visualizing, and documenting painted-over bloodstain evidence.

Raman spectroscopy is one of a few analytical techniques capable of nondestructive and nearly instantaneous analysis of a wide variety of forensic evidence, including body fluid stains, at the scene of a crime. In this proof-of-concept study, Raman microspectroscopy was utilized for gender identification based on dry bloodstains. Raman spectra were acquired in mapping mode from multiple spots on a bloodstain to account for intrinsic sample heterogeneity. The obtained Raman spectroscopic data showed highly similar spectroscopic features for female and male blood samples. Nevertheless, support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neuron network (ANN) statistical methods applied to the spectroscopic data allowed for differentiating between male and female bloodstains with high confidence. More specifically, the statistical approach based on a genetic algorithm (GA) coupled with an ANN classification showed approximately 98% gender differentiation accuracy for individual bloodstains. These results demonstrate the great potential of the developed method for forensic applications, although more work is needed for method validation. When this method is fully developed, a portable Raman instrument could be used for the infield identification of traces of body fluids and to obtain phenotypic information about the donor, including gender and race, as well as for the analysis of a variety of other types of forensic evidence.\n\n[Determination of Bloodstain Age by UV Visible Integrating Sphere Reflection Spectrum].\n\nPubMed\n\nYan, L Q; Gao, Y\n\n2016-10-01\n\nTo establish a method for rapid identification of bloodstain age. Under laboratory conditions ï¼20 â, 25 â and 30 âï¼, an integrating sphere ISR-240A was used as a reflection accessory on an UV-2450 UV-vis spectrophotometer, and a standard white board of BaSOâ was used as reference, the reflection spectrums of bloodstain from human ears' venous blood were measured at regular intervals. The reflection radios R â ââ and R â ââ at a specific wavelength were collected and the value of R â ââ/ R â ââ was calculated. The linear fitting and regression analysis were done by SPSS 17.0. The results of regression analysis showed that R Â² of the ratios of bloodstain age to UV visible reflectivity in specific wavelengths were larger than 0.8 within 8 hours and under certain circumstances. The regression equation was established. The bloodstain age had significant correlation with the value of R â ââ/ R â ââ. The method of inspection is simple, rapid and nondestructive with a good reliability, and can be used to identify the bloodstain age within 8 hours elapsed-time standards under laboratory conditions.

In Czechoslovakian criminology is this method not commonly used. The objective of this work is to calculate the impact length, height and distance splashing of blood drops. The results are compared with the real values for specific cases. It is also compared to calculate the angle of incidence of blood drops, using sinÎ± with a form using tgÎ±. For this purposes we used two different character cases from practice with well-preserved condition and readable blood stains. Selected blood stains were documented in order to calculate the angle of incidence of blood drops and to calculateorigin splashes. For this drop of blood, the distance of impact of the drops of blood (x), the height of the sprayed blood drops (y) and the length of the flight path the drop of blood (l). The obtained data was retrospectively analysed for the two models. The first straight line is represented by the triangle (M1) and the other is the parabolic model (M2). The formulae were derived using the Euler substitution. The results show that the angle of incidence of the drop of blood can be calculated as sinÎ± and the tgÎ±. When applying, the triangle is appropriate to consider the application and sinÎ± parabolic requires the calculation of the angle of incidence drops of blood tgÎ±. Parabola is useful for the BPA. In Czechoslovakian should be providing workplace training seminars BPA primarily intended for forensic investigators.We recommend the use of this method during investigations, verification of acts in forensic practice.\n\nFundamental studies of bloodstain formation and characteristics.\n\nPubMed\n\nAdam, Craig D\n\n2012-06-10\n\nA detailed understanding of blood droplet impact dynamics and stain formation is an essential prerequisite to the interpretation of both individual bloodstains and spatter patterns. The current literature on theoretical models for the spreading and splashing of liquid drops on surfaces relevant to the forensic context of bloodstain formation has been reviewed. These models have been evaluated for a paper substrate using experimental data obtained as function of droplet size, impact velocity and angle. It is shown that for perpendicular impact there are fairly simple mathematical models for the spreading diameter and the number of scallops or spines formed around the stain though these have quite limited ranges of validity in their basic form. In particular, predictions for the diameter are best for small droplets impacting at high velocity and the number of spines saturates for higher impact velocities. In the case of spreading, a modification to the energy conservation model is found to provide excellent agreement with experimental stain diameters across a wide range of impact velocities. For non-perpendicular impact, the width of stains is found to depend principally on the normal component of impact velocity and may be predicted by an appropriate modification to the expression for the perpendicular case. Limitations in the calculation of impact angle from the stain aspect ratio are identified and a theoretical basis for the prediction of spines around an elliptical stain is proposed. Some key issues for future research are identified which include a systematic, quantitative study of the effect of surface properties on bloodstain formation. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although various methods of accomplishing this have been proposed, none has gained widespread use due to poor time resolution and weak age correlation. We have developed a method for the estimation of the time since deposition (TSD) of dried bloodstains using UV-VIS spectrophotometric analysis of hemoglobin (Hb) that is based upon its characteristic oxidation chemistry. A detailed study of the Hb Soret band (Î»maxâ=â412 nm) in aged bloodstains revealed a blue shift (shift to shorter wavelength) as the age of the stain increases. The extent of this shift permits, for the first time, a distinction to be made between bloodstains that were deposited minutes, hours, days and weeks prior to recovery and analysis. The extent of the blue shift was found to be a function of ambient relative humidity and temperature. The method is extremely sensitive, requiring as little as a 1 Âµl dried bloodstain for analysis. We demonstrate that it might be possible to perform TSD measurements at the crime scene using a portable low-sample-volume spectrophotometer.

In an effort to create a protocol that would have minimal impact on current work-flow, while still effectively removing task-irrelevant contextual information, the protocol was designed following an in-depth consultation with management and forensic staff. The resulting design was for a protocol of independent-checking (i.e. blind peer-review) where the checker's interpretation of the evidence is conducted in the absence of case information and the original examiner's notes or interpretation(s). At the conclusion of a ten-case trial period, there was widespread agreement that the protocol had minimal impact on the number of people required, the cost, or the time to complete an item examination. The agency is now looking to adopt the protocol into standard operating procedures and in some cases the protocol has been extended to cover other laboratory-based examinations (e.g. fabric damage, shoeprint examination, and physical fits). The protocol developed during this trial provides a useful example for agencies seeking to adopt contextual information management into their workflow.

Nevertheless, a major limitation of RNA-based applications is very low RNA stability in biological material, due to the RNAse activity. This highlights the need for improving the methods of RNA collection and storage. Technological approaches such as FTA Classic Cards (Whatman) could provide a solution for the problem of RNA degradation. However, different methods of RNA isolation from FTA cards could have diverse effects on RNA quantity and quality. The purpose of this research was to analyze the utility of three different methods of RNA isolation from peripheral blood collected on FTA Classic Cards (Whatman). The study also aimed at assessing RNA stability in bloodstains deposited on FTA cards. Material and methods: The study was performed on peripheral bloodstains collected from 59 individuals on FTA Classic Cards (Whatman). RNA was isolated with High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics), Universal RNA/miRNA Purification (EURx) and TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies). RNA was subjected to quantitative analysis followed by reverse transcription and Real - Time PCR reaction. Results: The study has shown that FTA Classic Cards (Whatman) are useful tools for storing bloodstains at room temperature for RNA analysis. Moreover, the method of RNA extraction employing TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) provides the highest efficiency and reproducibility for samples stored for no more than 2 years. Conclusions: The FTA cards are suitable for collecting and storing bloodstains for RNA analysis in clinical and forensic genetics.\n\nDrip bloodstain appearance on inclined apparel fabrics: Effect of prior-laundering, fibre content and fabric structure.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Castro, Therese C; Carr, Debra J; Taylor, Michael C; Kieser, Jules A; Duncan, Warwick\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe interaction of blood and fabrics is currently a 'hot topic', since the understanding and interpretation of these stains is still in its infancy. A recent simplified perpendicular impact experimental programme considering bloodstains generated on fabrics laid the foundations for understanding more complex scenarios. Blood rarely impacts apparel fabrics perpendicular; therefore a systematic study was conducted to characterise the appearance of drip stains on inclined fabrics. The final drip stain appearance for 45Â° and 15Â° impact angles on torso apparel fabrics (100% cotton plain woven, 100% polyester plain woven, a blend of polyester and cotton plain woven and 100% cotton single jersey knit) that had been laundered for six, 26 and 52 cycles prior to testing was investigated. The relationship between drop parameters (height and volume), angle and the stain characteristics (parent stain area, axis 1 and 2 and number of satellite stains) for each fabric was examined using analysis of variance. The appearance of the drip stains on these fabrics was distorted, in comparison to drip stains on hard-smooth surface. Examining the parent stain allowed for classification of stains occurring at an angle, however the same could not be said for the satellite stains produced. All of the dried stains visible on the surface of the fabric were larger than just after the impacting event, indicating within fabric spreading of blood due to capillary force (wicking). The cotton-containing fabrics spread the blood within the fabrics in all directions along the stain's circumference, while spreading within the polyester plain woven fabric occurred in only the weft (width of the fabric) and warp (length) directions. Laundering affected the formation of bloodstain on the blend plain woven fabric at both impact angles, although not all characteristics were significantly affected for the three impact conditions considered. The bloodstain characteristics varied due to the fibre content\n\nNon-invasive prediction of bloodstain age using the principal component and a back propagation artificial neural network\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSun, Huimin; Meng, Yaoyong; Zhang, Pingli; Li, Yajing; Li, Nan; Li, Caiyun; Guo, Zhiyou\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe age determination of bloodstains is an important and immediate challenge for forensic science. No reliable methods are currently available for estimating the age of bloodstains. Here we report a method for determining the age of bloodstains at different storage temperatures. Bloodstains were stored at 37 Â°C, 25 Â°C, 4 Â°C, andââ-20 Â°C for 80 d. Bloodstains were measured using Raman spectroscopy at various time points. The principal component and a back propagation artificial neural network model were then established for estimating the age of the bloodstains. The results were ideal; the square of correlation coefficient was up to 0.99 (R 2ââ>ââ0.99) and the root mean square error of the prediction at lowest reached 55.9829âh. This method is real-time, non-invasive, non-destructive and highly efficiency. It may well prove that Raman spectroscopy is a promising tool for the estimation of the age of bloodstains.\n\nCharacterization of UVC-induced DNA damage in bloodstains: forensic implications.\n\nPubMed\n\nHall, Ashley; Ballantyne, Jack\n\n2004-09-01\n\nThe ability to detect DNA polymorphisms using molecular genetic techniques has revolutionized the forensic analysis of biological evidence. DNA typing now plays a critical role within the criminal justice system, but one of the limiting factors with the technology is that DNA isolated from biological stains recovered from the crime scene is sometimes so damaged as to be intractable to analysis. Potential remedies for damaged DNA are likely to be dependent upon the precise nature of the DNA damage present in any particular sample but, unfortunately, current knowledge of the biochemical nature, and the extent, of such DNA damage in dried biological stains is rudimentary. As a model for DNA damage assessment in biological stains recovered from crime scenes, we have subjected human bloodstains and naked DNA in the hydrated and dehydrated states to varying doses of UVC radiation. It was possible to damage the DNA sufficiently in a bloodstain to cause a standard autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) profile to be lost. However, a detailed analysis of the process, based upon assays developed to detect bipyrimidine photoproducts (BPPPs), single- and double-strand breaks, and DNA-DNA crosslinks, produced some unexpected findings. Contrary to the situation with living tissues or cells in culture, the predominant UVC-induced damage to DNA in bloodstains appears not to be pyrimidine dimers. Although some evidence for the presence of BPPPs and DNA crosslinks was obtained, the major form of UVC damage causing genetic profile loss appeared to be single-strand breaks. It was not possible, however, to preclude the possibility that a combination of damage types was responsible for the profile loss observed. We demonstrate here that a significant measure of protection against UVC-mediated genetic profile loss in dried biological stain material is afforded by the dehydrated state of the DNA and, to a lesser extent, the DNA cellular milieu.\n\nA Molecular Method to Detect Wound Cells in Bloodstains Resultant of Sharp Force Injuries for Crime Scene Reconstruction.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnson, Donald J; Raymond, David E; Chen, Cynthia; Quon, Matthew; Lis, Julian; Choi, Mo Re; Lopez, Christopher; Han, Aileen; de Leon, Ray D; Bir, Cynthia\n\n2018-05-01\n\nPrevious research by the authors on an animal model showed that bloodstains can contain additional information about their somatic origin in the form of wound cells. Bloodstains produced by a gunshot wound to the head were distinguished from bloodstains produced by a gunshot wound to the chest by testing the stains for a brain microRNA marker. In this study, the effectiveness of the technique was examined on blood drops shed externally from a stab wound to the liver of rat carcasses. Specifically, investigations were conducted on the liver microRNA marker, rno-mir-122-3p, with the QIAGEN miScript System, and PCR analysis. Between the two stabbing methods used, 67% of the scalpel blades and 57% of the blood drops tested positive for rno-mir-122-3p; however, other samples tested negative giving inconclusive results as to the wound-of-origin. The amount of the liver cells in the bloodstains appeared to be related to the extent of trauma.

It mainly uses hydrogen peroxide or sodium perborate as coreactants. The easy decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate in the presence of many ions significantly affects the selectivity. Artemisinin is a natural peroxide that is quite stable in the presence of common ions. In the present study, artemisinin has been exploited for the forensic bloodstain chemiluminescence detection for the first time. Using smart phone as cost-effective portable detector, the visual detection of bloodstains has been achieved with a dilution factor of blood up to 100â¯000. Moreover, this system shows excellent selectivity against many common species. It can well differentiate bloodstains from other stains, such as coffee, brown sugar, and black tea. Both favorable sensitivity and selectivity makes the present method promising in forensic detection.\n\nBloodstain detection and discrimination impacted by spectral shift when using an interference filter-based visible and near-infrared multispectral crime scene imaging system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, Jie; Messinger, David W.; Dube, Roger R.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nBloodstain detection and discrimination from nonblood substances on various substrates are critical in forensic science as bloodstains are a critical source for confirmatory DNA tests. Conventional bloodstain detection methods often involve time-consuming sample preparation, a chance of harm to investigators, the possibility of destruction of blood samples, and acquisition of too little data at crime scenes either in the field or in the laboratory. An imaging method has the advantages of being nondestructive, noncontact, real-time, and covering a large field-of-view. The abundant spectral information provided by multispectral imaging makes it a potential presumptive bloodstain detection and discrimination method. This article proposes an interference filter (IF) based area scanning three-spectral-band crime scene imaging system used for forensic bloodstain detection and discrimination. The impact of large angle of views on the spectral shift of calibrated IFs is determined, for both detecting and discriminating bloodstains from visually similar substances on multiple substrates. Spectral features in the visible and near-infrared portion employed by the relative band depth method are used. This study shows that 1 ml bloodstain on black felt, gray felt, red felt, white cotton, white polyester, and raw wood can be detected. Bloodstains on the above substrates can be discriminated from cola, coffee, ketchup, orange juice, red wine, and green tea.\n\nChemistry, microscopy and smell: bloodstains and nineteenth-century legal medicine.\n\nPubMed\n\nBertomeu-SÃ¡nchez, JosÃ© RamÃ³n\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper analyses the development of three methods for detecting bloodstains during the first half of the nineteenth-century in France. After dealing with the main problems in detecting bloodstains, the paper describes the chemical tests introduced in the mid-1820s. Then the first uses of the microscope in the detection of bloodstains around 1827 are discussed. The most controversial method is then examined, the smell test introduced by Jean-Pierre Barruel in 1829, and the debates which took place in French academies and learned societies during ensuing years are surveyed. Moving to the courtrooms a review is conducted of how the different methods were employed in criminal trials. By reviewing these cases, the main arguments against Barruel's test during the 1830s are explored as well as the changes making possible the return of the microscope to legal medicine around 1840. By reconstructing the history of these three methods, the paper reveals how the senses of smell and vision (colours and microscopic images) were employed in order to produce convincing evidence in both academies and courts. The paper questions two linear master narratives that are organized in terms of progress and decline: the development of forensic science as a result of continued technological progress; and the supposed decline of smell in the history of the senses, particularly in the realm of chemistry and medicine.\n\nAn evaluation of the underlying mechanisms of bloodstain pattern analysis error.\n\nPubMed\n\nBehrooz, Nima; Hulse-Smith, Lee; Chandra, Sanjeev\n\n2011-09-01\n\nAn experiment was designed to explore the underlying mechanisms of blood disintegration and its subsequent effect on area of origin (AO) calculations. Blood spatter patterns were created through the controlled application of pressurized air (20-80 kPa) for 0.1 msec onto suspended blood droplets (2.7-3.2 mm diameter). The resulting disintegration process was captured using high-speed photography. Straight-line triangulation resulted in a 50% height overestimation, whereas using the lowest calculated height for each spatter pattern reduced this error to 8%. Incorporation of projectile motion resulted in a 28% height underestimation. The AO xy-coordinate was found to be very accurate with a maximum offset of only 4 mm, while AO size calculations were found to be two- to fivefold greater than expected. Subsequently, reverse triangulation analysis revealed the rotational offset for 26% of stains could not be attributed to measurement error, suggesting that some portion of error is inherent in the disintegration process.

A blind trial study was subsequently undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of this technique, using an applied, crime scene methodology. Calculations from bloodstains produced on paper, drywall, and wood were used to derive surface-specific equations to predict 39 unknown mock crime scene bloodstains created over a range of impact velocities (2.2-5.7 m/sec) and droplet volumes (12-45 microL). Strong correlations were found between expected and observed results, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.83 and 0.99. The 95% confidence limit associated with predictions of impact velocity and droplet volume was calculated for paper (0.28 m/sec, 1.7 microL), drywall (0.37 m/sec, 1.7 microL), and wood (0.65 m/sec, 5.2 microL).\n\nExsanguinated blood volume estimation using fractal analysis of digital images.\n\nPubMed\n\nSant, Sonia P; Fairgrieve, Scott I\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThe estimation of bloodstain volume using fractal analysis of digital images of passive blood stains is presented. Binary digital photos of bloodstains of known volumes (ranging from 1 to 7 mL), dispersed in a defined area, were subjected to image analysis using FracLac V. 2.0 for ImageJ. The box-counting method was used to generate a fractal dimension for each trial. A positive correlation between the generated fractal number and the volume of blood was found (R(2) = 0.99). Regression equations were produced to estimate the volume of blood in blind trials. An error rate ranging from 78% for 1 mL to 7% for 6 mL demonstrated that as the volume increases so does the accuracy of the volume estimation. This method used in the preliminary study proved that bloodstain patterns may be deconstructed into mathematical parameters, thus removing the subjective element inherent in other methods of volume estimation.

After acquiring greyscale SEM micrographs of a (dark red to the naked eye) human blood smear on grey chert, they were manually obtained in red tone using both the SEM-coupled image-acquiring system and an image-manipulation free software, as well as they were automatically generated in thermal tone using the SEM-coupled system. Red images obtained by the SEM-coupled system demonstrated lower visual-discrimination capability than the other coloured images, whereas those in red generated by the free software rendered better magnitude of scopic information than the red images generated by the SEM-coupled system. Thermal-tone images, although were further from the real sample colour than the red ones, not only increased their realistic appearance over the greyscale images, but also yielded the best visual-discrimination capability among all the coloured SEM micrographs, and fairly enhanced the relief effect of the SEM micrographs over both the greyscale and the red images. The application of digital colour by means of the facilities provided by an SEM-coupled image-acquiring system or, when required, by an image-manipulation free software provides a user-friendly, quick and inexpensive way of obtaining coloured SEM micrographs of bloodstains, avoiding to do sophisticated, time-consuming colouring procedures. Although this work was focused on bloodstains, well probably other monochromatic or quasi-monochromatic samples are also susceptible of increasing their realistic appearance by colouring them using the simple methods utilized in this study.\n\nHuman bloodstains on bone artefacts: an SEM intra- and inter-sample comparative study using ratite bird tibiotarsus.\n\nPubMed\n\nHortolÃ , Policarp\n\n2016-11-01\n\nApart from their forensic significance in crime investigation, human bloodstains have an anthropological interest due to their occurrence on certain traditional weapons and ritual objects. Previously, a guiding study of erythrocytes in experimental samples including domestic sheep (Ovis aries) tibia was carried out using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Here, a comparative SEM study to reveal the potential differences in bloodstain surface morphology as a function of intra-sample (smear region) and inter-sample (individual smear, smearing mechanism, bone origin) parameters is reported. A fragment of emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) tibiotarsus was smeared with an adult man's peripheral blood. After air-drying and storing indoors, the boundary and neighbouring inner areas of the three individual bloodstains obtained were examined via secondary electrons in a variable-pressure SEM working in low-vacuum mode. As a whole, desiccation microcracks were present, the limits between the smear and the substrate appeared poorly defined, and no erythrocyte negative replicas were observed in the examined areas. In addition, a putative fibrin network, more or less embedded in the dried plasma matrix, was observed in the smears' boundary. Regarding the smear region in sliding smears, the periphery and boundary revealed to be different, while the head and tail were similar. Considering individual sliding smears, they had similar characteristics. Relating to the smear region as a function of the smearing mechanism, the periphery was different whether sliding or touching, while the boundary was similar in sliding and touching smears. Concerning the smear region as a function of the bone origin, the periphery revealed to be similar in both ratite and mammalian bone, while the boundary did different in ratite and mammalian bone. The results of this study show that SEM examination can be used fruitfully to detect bloodstains on ratite bone. Combined with previous SEM results in\n\nDirect PCR amplification of DNA from human bloodstains, saliva, and touch samples collected with microFLOQÂ® swabs.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmbers, Angie; Wiley, Rachel; Novroski, Nicole; Budowle, Bruce\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPrevious studies have shown that nylon flocked swabs outperform traditional fiber swabs in DNA recovery due to their innovative design and lack of internal absorbent core to entrap cellular materials. The microFLOQ Â® Direct swab, a miniaturized version of the 4N6 FLOQSwab Â® , has a small swab head that is treated with a lysing agent which allows for direct amplification and DNA profiling from sample collection to final result in less than two hours. Additionally, the microFLOQ Â® system subsamples only a minute portion of a stain and preserves the vast majority of the sample for subsequent testing or re-analysis, if desired. The efficacy of direct amplification of DNA from dilute bloodstains, saliva stains, and touch samples was evaluated using microFLOQ Â® Direct swabs and the GlobalFilerâ¢ Express system. Comparisons were made to traditional methods to assess the robustness of this alternate workflow. Controlled studies with 1:19 and 1:99 dilutions of bloodstains and saliva stains consistently yielded higher STR peak heights than standard methods with 1ng input DNA from the same samples. Touch samples from common items yielded single source and mixed profiles that were consistent with primary users of the objects. With this novel methodology/workflow, no sample loss occurs and therefore more template DNA is available during amplification. This approach may have important implications for analysis of low quantity and/or degraded samples that plague forensic casework. Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

As a result, there are many tests that are frequently used to determine if a stain is blood, semen or saliva by exploiting the properties of certain molecules present within the fluids themselves. These include chemical reagents such as the Kastle-Meyer or Acid Phosphatase tests, as well as other techniques like the use of alternative light sources. However, most of the tests currently available have some major drawbacks. In this study, a handheld near-infrared spectrometer is investigated for the specific identification of deposited bloodstains. First, a calibration was carried out by scanning over 500 positive (blood present) and negative (blood absent) samples to train several predictive models based on machine learning principles. These models were then tested on over 100 new positive and negative samples to evaluate their performance. All models tested were able to correctly classify deposited stains as blood in at least 81% of tested samples, with some models allowing for even higher classification accuracy at over 94%. This suggests that handheld near infrared devices could offer great opportunity for the rapid, low cost and non-destructive screening of body fluids at scenes of crime.

In order to assess the feasibility of using SEM synthetic replicas for the identification of bloodstains (BSs) via morphology of red blood cells (RBCs), three fragments of different natural raw material (inorganic, stone; plant, wood; animal, shell) were smeared with peripheral human blood. Afterwards, molds and casts of the bloodstained areas were made using vinyl polysiloxane (VPS) silicone impression and polyurethane (PU) resin casting material, respectively. Then, the original samples and the resulting casts were coated with gold and examined in secondary-electron mode using a high-vacuum SEM. Results suggest that PU resin casts obtained from VPS silicone molds can preserve RBC morphology in BSs, and consequently that synthetic replicas are feasible for SEM identification of BSs on cultural heritage specimens made of natural raw materials. Although the focus of this study was on BSs, the method reported in this paper may be applicable to organic residues other than blood, as well as to the surface of other specimens when, for any reason, the original is unavailable for an SEM.\n\nSystematic investigation of drip stains on apparel fabrics: The effects of prior-laundering, fibre content and fabric structure on final stain appearance.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Castro, Therese C; Taylor, Michael C; Kieser, Jules A; Carr, Debra J; Duncan, W\n\n2015-05-01\n\nBloodstain pattern analysis is the investigation of blood deposited at crime scenes and the interpretation of that pattern. The surface that the blood gets deposited onto could distort the appearance of the bloodstain. The interaction of blood and apparel fabrics is in its infancy, but the interaction of liquids and apparel fabrics has been well documented and investigated in the field of textile science (e.g. the processes of wetting and wicking of fluids on fibres, yarns and fabrics). A systematic study on the final appearance of drip stains on torso apparel fabrics (100% cotton plain woven, 100% polyester plain woven, blend of polyester and cotton plain woven and 100% cotton single jersey knit) that had been laundered for six, 26 and 52 cycles prior to testing was investigated in the paper. The relationship between drop velocity (1.66Â±0.50m/s, 4.07Â±0.03m/s, 5.34Â±0.18m/s) and the stain characteristics (parent stain area, axes 1 and 2 and number of satellite stains) for each fabric was examined using analysis of variance. The experimental design and effect of storing blood were investigated on a reference sample, which indicated that the day (up to five days) at which the drops were generated did not affect the bloodstain. The effect of prior-laundering (six, 26 and 52 laundering cycles), fibre content (cotton vs. polyester vs. blend) and fabric structure (plain woven vs. single jersey knit) on the final appearance of the bloodstain were investigated. Distortion in the bloodstains produced on non-laundered fabrics indicated the importance of laundering fabrics to remove finishing treatments before conducting bloodstain experiments. For laundered fabrics, both the cotton fabrics and the blend had a circular to oval stain appearance, while the polyester fabric had a circular appearance with evidence of spread along the warp and weft yarns, which resulted in square-like stains at the lowest drop velocity.

In order to produce fully-focused 3D animations of strongly uneven surface microareas, a vertical stack of six digital secondary-electron SEM micrographs of a human bloodstain microarea was acquired. Afterwards, single combined images were generated using a macrophotography and light microscope image post-processing software. Subsequently, 3D animations of texture and topography were obtained in different formats using a combination of software tools. Finally, a 3D-like animation of a texture-topography composite was obtained in different formats using another combination of software tools. By one hand, results indicate that the use of image post-processing software not concerned primarily with electron micrographs allows to obtain, in an easy way, fully-focused images of strongly uneven surface microareas of bloodstains from small series of partially out-of-focus digital SEM micrographs. On the other hand, results also indicate that such small series of electron micrographs can be utilized for generating 3D and 3D-like animations that can subsequently be converted into different formats, by using certain user-friendly software facilities not originally designed for use in SEM, that are easily available from Internet. Although the focus of this study was on bloodstains, the methods used in it well probably are also of relevance for studying the surface microstructures of other organic or inorganic materials whose sharp displaying is difficult of obtaining from a single SEM micrograph.\n\nDNA analysis in the case of Kaspar Hauser.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeichhold, G M; Bark, J E; Korte, W; Eisenmenger, W; Sullivan, K M\n\n1998-01-01\n\nIn 1828 a mysterious young man appeared in NÃ¼rnberg, Germany, who was barely able to speak or walk but could write down his name, Kaspar Hauser. He quickly became the centre of social interest but also the victim of intrigue. His appearance, his origin and assassination in 1833 were, and still are, the source of much debate. The most widely accepted theory postulates that Kaspar Hauser was the son of Grand Duke Carl von Baden and his wife Stephanie de Beauharnais, an adopted daughter of Napoleon Bonaparte. To check this theory, DNA analysis was performed on the clothes most likely worn by Kaspar Hauser when he was stabbed on December 14th, 1833. A suitable bloodstain from the underpants was divided and analysed independently by the Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Munich (ILM) and the Forensic Science Service Laboratory, Birmingham (FSS). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was sequenced from the bloodstain and from blood samples obtained from two living maternal relatives of Stephanie de Beauharnais. The sequence from the bloodstained clothing differed from the sequence found in both reference blood samples at seven confirmed positions. This proves that the bloodstain does not originate from a son of Stephanie de Beauharnais. Thus, it is becoming clear that Kaspar Hauser was not the Prince of Baden.\n\nDirect amplification of casework bloodstains using the Promega PowerPlex(Â®) 21 PCR amplification system.\n\nPubMed\n\nGray, Kerryn; Crowle, Damian; Scott, Pam\n\n2014-09-01\n\nA significant number of evidence items submitted to Forensic Science Service Tasmania (FSST) are blood swabs or bloodstained items. Samples from these items routinely undergo phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol organic extraction and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) testing prior to PowerPlex(Â®) 21 amplification. This multi-step process has significant cost and timeframe implications in a fiscal climate of tightening government budgets, pressure towards improved operating efficiencies, and an increasing emphasis on rapid techniques better supporting intelligence-led policing. Direct amplification of blood and buccal cells on cloth and Whatman FTAâ¢ card with PowerPlex(Â®) 21 has already been successfully implemented for reference samples, eliminating the requirement for sample pre-treatment. Scope for expanding this method to include less pristine casework blood swabs and samples from bloodstained items was explored in an endeavour to eliminate lengthy DNA extraction, purification and qPCR steps for a wider subset of samples. Blood was deposited onto a range of substrates including those historically found to inhibit STR amplification. Samples were collected with micro-punch, micro-swab, or both. The potential for further fiscal savings via reduced volume amplifications was assessed by amplifying all samples at full and reduced volume (25 and 13Î¼L). Overall success rate data showed 80% of samples yielded a complete profile at reduced volume, compared to 78% at full volume. Particularly high success rates were observed for the blood on fabric/textile category with 100% of micro-punch samples yielding complete profiles at reduced volume and 85% at full volume. Following the success of this trial, direct amplification of suitable casework blood samples has been implemented at reduced volume. Significant benefits have been experienced, most noticeably where results from crucial items have been provided to police investigators prior to interview of\n\nHydrodynamics of back spatter by blunt bullet gunshot with a link to bloodstain pattern analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nComiskey, P. M.; Yarin, A. L.; Attinger, D.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nA theoretical model describing the blood spatter pattern resulting from a blunt bullet gunshot is proposed. The predictions are compared to experimental data acquired in the present work. This hydrodynamic problem belongs to the class of the impact hydrodynamics with the pressure impulse generating the blood flow. At the free surface, the latter is directed outwards and accelerated toward the surrounding air. As a result, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the flow of blood occurs, which is responsible for the formation of blood drops of different sizes and initial velocities. Thus, the initial diameter, velocity, and acceleration of the atomized blood drops can be determined. Then, the equations of motion are solved, describing drop trajectories in air accounting for gravity, and air drag. Also considered are the drop-drop interactions through air, which diminish air drag on the subsequent drops. Accordingly, deposition of two-phase (blood-drop and air) jets on a vertical cardstock sheet located between the shooter and the target (and perforated by the bullet) is predicted and compared with experimental data. The experimental data were acquired with a porous polyurethane foam sheet target impregnated with swine blood, and the blood drops were collected on a vertical cardstock sheet which was perforated by the blunt bullet. The highly porous target possesses a low hydraulic resistance and therefore resembles a pool of blood shot by a blunt bullet normally to its free surface. The back spatter pattern was predicted numerically and compared to the experimental data for the number of drops, their area, the total stain area, and the final impact angle as functions of radial location from the bullet hole in the cardstock sheet (the collection screen). Comparisons of the predicted results with the experimental data revealed satisfactory agreement. The predictions also allow one to find the impact Weber number on the collection screen, which is necessary to predict stain\n\nImpact of carpet construction on fluid penetration: The case of blood.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeng, Chengcheng; Michielsen, Stephen; Attinger, Daniel\n\n2018-03-01\n\nBloodstains and bloodstain patterns are often observed at crime scenes and their analysis through bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) can assist in reconstructing crime scenes. However, most published work related to BPA only deals with hard, non-porous surfaces and none of the studies have carefully characterized carpets. Soft and porous carpets are often encountered at crime scenes since they are common in American homes accounting for 51% of total U.S. flooring market; this has motivated the research described herein. To assess fluid penetration into tufted carpers, a new method for determining porosity and pore size distribution in tufted carpets has been developed for bloodstains on carpet. In this study, three kinds of nylon carpet were used: a low, a medium and a high face-weight carpet. Each carpet had an antistain treatment, which was removed from half of each carpet by steam-cleaning with a pH 12 NaOH solution. This resulted in six carpet samples. Yarn twist, carpet weight, pile height, water contact angles on carpets, water contact angles on individual fibers, and fiber cross-sectional shapes were characterized. Porosity and pore size distribution were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Porcine blood was used as a human blood substitute at three liquid volumes (30Î¼L, 10Î¼L, and 2Î¼L). Analysis showed that porous carpet construction and antistain finishing both affected penetration. The depth of blood penetration decreased with the increase of carpet face-weight but increased with increased drop height. The removal of antistain treatment increased blood penetration into the carpets and changed the pore size distribution. Effects of antistain treatment, porosity and pore size distribution of tufted carpet, and blood wicking behaviors on carpets were found to strongly affect blood penetration into the carpets.

The inference of the time that the crime was committed is of great significance to solve the case, and it was also a difficult problem in judicial authentication. Therefore, establishing a method of rapid determination of bleeding time is very necessary. Using a UV-visible spectrometer with a reflection accessory called ISR-240A and whiteboard as a reference standard, the reflection spectra of blood gauze, aluminum, glass and plastic were measured every hour under the condition of 16 Â°C and 70% humidity within 8 hours. Using SPSS to process the data, R541/R577 was figured out and linear fitting was completed. The same method was carried on on the gauze of blood at 24 Â°C. The results showed that, within 8 hours, spectral reflectance values of blood at 541 and 577 nm increased gradually with the passage of injury time. In addition to the R2 of the glass with blood is 0.769, the rest of the R2 were greater than 0.900. The values of F were greater than F0.05 (1, 6) = 5.59. Therefore, the linear regression model is significant meaningful. The method of using a UV-Visible spectrometer without doing any operations of the test samples is simple. Moreover, it does no harm to the further inspection in aspects of personal information, which is suitable for the judicial practice.\n\n[Forensic aspects of gunshot suicides in Germany].\n\nPubMed\n\nKunz, Sebastian Niko; Meyer, Harald J; Kraus, Sybille\n\n2013-12-01\n\nSuicidal gunshot wounds are a common appearance in forensic casework. The main task of the coroner lies in the detection of typical pathomorphological correlates, thus differentiating between homicide, suicide and accident. Apart from characteristic bloodstain patterns on the gun and shooting hand, the localisation of the entrance wound and the position of the weapon, additional details such as family background or medical history are important aspects of forensic investigation. An uncommon choice of weaponry and its unusual morphological manifestation often complicate the examination and reconstruction of such cases. Furthermore, due to social stigmatisation, the possibility of secondary changes by relatives at the crime scene should be considered. In addition to autopsy findings, a careful crime scene investigation and bloodstain pattern analysis, a ballistic reconstruction can be an essential tool to gain knowledge of the shooting distance and position of the gun.\n\nInfluence of the impact energy on the pattern of blood drip stains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSmith, F. R.; Nicloux, C.; Brutin, D.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe maximum spreading diameter of complex fluid droplets has been extensively studied and explained by numerous physical models. This research focuses therefore on a different aspect, the bulging outer rim observed after evaporation on the final dried pattern of blood droplets. A correlation is found between the inner diameter, the maximum outer diameter, and the impact speed. This shows how the drying mechanism of a blood drip stain is influenced by the impact energy, which induces a larger spreading diameter and thus a different redistribution of red blood cells inside the droplet. An empirical relation is established between the final dried pattern of a passive bloodstain and its impact speed, yielding a possible forensic application. Indeed, being able to relate accurately the energy of the drop with its final pattern would give a clue to investigators, as currently no such simple and accurate tool exists.\n\nThe detection of Rh antigens (D,C,c,E,e) on bloodstains by a micro-elution technique using low ionic strength solution (LISS) and papain-treated red cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nBargagna, M; Sabelli, M; Giacomelli, C\n\n1982-01-01\n\nNinety experimental bloodstains, were examined, with the intention of detecting the principal Rh antigens, by using a micro-elution method improved by the use of low ionic strength solution (LISS) and papain-treated red cells. This method makes it possible to employ most commercially produced sera in routine forensic haematology laboratory work. The antigens could regularly be detected in stains of the following ages: D, C and c in stains of at least 6 months, E in stains of at least 4 months, and e in stains of at least 2 months.\n\nA silicon sol-gel approach to the development of forensic blood substitutes: Design Considerations for Research and Training\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStotesbury, Theresa E.\n\nThe research and development of synthetic blood substitutes is a reported need within the forensic community. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge in bloodstain pattern analysis by offering a materials science approach to designing, producing and testing synthetic forensic blood substitutes. A key deliverable from this research is the creation of a robust silicon-based material using the solution-gelation technique that has been validated for controlled passive drip and spatter simulation. The work investigates the physical properties (viscosity, surface tension and density) of forensic blood substitute formulations and describes the similarity in the spreading dynamics of the optimized material to whole human blood. It then explores how blood and other fluids behave in impact simulation using high-speed video analysis and supports the use of the optimized material for spatter simulation. Finally, the work highlights the practical value of the material as an educational tool for both basic and advanced bloodstain experimentation and training.\n\nRoughness influence on human blood drop spreading and splashing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSmith, Fiona; Buntsma, Naomi; Brutin, David\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe impact behaviour of complex fluid droplets is a topic that has been extensively studied but with much debate. The Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) community is encountering this scientific problem with daily practical cases since they use bloodstains as evidence in crime scene reconstruction. We aim to provide fundamental explanations in the study of blood drip stains by investigating the influence of surface roughness and wettability on the splashing limit of droplets of blood, a non-Newtonian colloidal fluid. Droplets of blood impacting perpendicularly different surfaces at different velocities were recorded. The recordings were analysed as well as the surfaces characteristics in order to find an empirical solution since we found that roughness plays a major role in the threshold of the splashing/non-splashing behaviour of blood compared to the wettability. Moreover it appears that roughness alters the deformation of the drip stains. These observations are key in characterising features of drip stains with the impacting conditions, which would answer some forensic issues.\n\nPoint pattern analysis of FIA data\n\nTreesearch\n\nChris Woodall\n\n2002-01-01\n\nPoint pattern analysis is a branch of spatial statistics that quantifies the spatial distribution of points in two-dimensional space.

Thereby, attention should be paid to both the crime scene and the clothes of everyone involved in the crime. On dark textiles, though, it is difficult or even impossible for the human eye to detect bloodstains because of the low contrast to the background. However, in the near infrared wavelength range, contrast is considerably higher. Many textiles reflect light beyond a wavelength of 830Â nm and thus appear light-colored, whereas blood absorbs the light and appears dark. In our studies, a D7000 NIKON reflex camera modified for infrared photography produced high-resolution photographs visualizing even very small spatter stains on dark textiles. The equipment can be used at any crime scene or lab and provides immediately available and interpretable images. Thus, important findings can be obtained at an early stage of police investigations, as two examples (homicide and attempted homicide) illustrate.\n\nBlood identification and discrimination between human and nonhuman blood using portable Raman spectroscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nFujihara, J; Fujita, Y; Yamamoto, T; Nishimoto, N; Kimura-Kataoka, K; Kurata, S; Takinami, Y; Yasuda, T; Takeshita, H\n\n2017-03-01\n\nRaman spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to identify molecular structure. This technique is a nondestructive analysis and needs no sample preparation. Recently, Raman spectroscopy has been shown to be effective as a multipurpose analytical method for forensic applications. In the present study, blood identification and discrimination between human and nonhuman blood were performed by a portable Raman spectrometer, which can be used at a crime scene. To identify the blood and to discriminate between human and nonhuman blood, Raman spectra of bloodstains from 11 species (human, rat, mouse, cow, horse, sheep, pig, rabbit, cat, dog, and chicken) were taken using a portable Raman spectrometer. Raman peaks for blood (742, 1001, 1123, 1247, 1341, 1368, 1446, 1576, and 1619Â cm -1 ) could be observed by the portable Raman spectrometer in all 11 species, and the human bloodstain could be distinguished from the nonhuman ones by using a principal component analysis. This analysis can be performed on a bloodstain sample of at least 3Â months old. The portable Raman spectrometer can be used at a crime scene, and this analysis is useful for forensic examination.\n\nThe effect of firearm muzzle gases on the backspatter of blood.\n\nPubMed\n\nTaylor, Michael C; Laber, Terry L; Epstein, Barton P; Zamzow, Dan S; Baldwin, David P\n\n2011-09-01\n\nInjuries caused by gunshots can produce what bloodstain pattern analysts know as \"backspatter.\" Observations about the presence or absence of backspatter on an individual may be used in court as evidence of guilt or innocence. The discharge of three firearms (.22 caliber revolver, .38 caliber revolver, and .308 caliber rifle) and the resulting impact of bullets on a blood source were recorded using high-speed digital video imaging. Blood droplets, firearm muzzle gases, and ballistic shock waves were visualized using standard reflected light and shadowgraphy imaging techniques. A significant interaction between air currents, muzzle gases, and particulate material emanating from the firearms upon discharge with backspattered blood was observed. Blood droplets, initially spattered back toward the firearm and the shooter, were observed to change direction under the influence of firearm-induced air currents and were blown forward toward and beyond their original source location. Implications for experts testifying in court and for bloodstain pattern instructors are discussed.\n\nThe Effect of Firearm Muzzle Gases on the Backspatter of Blood\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTaylor, M.C.; Laber, T.L.; Epstein, B.P.\n\n2010-05-12\n\nInjuries caused by gunshots can produce what bloodstain pattern analysts know as 'backspatter.'

Today, DNA profiling with sets of highly polymorphic autosomal short tandem repeat markers is widely employed and accepted in the courts due to its high discriminating power and reliability. However, an artificial bloodstain purposefully created using molecular biology techniques succeeded in tricking a leading forensic DNA laboratory. The disturbing possibility that a forensic DNA profile can be faked shocked the general public and the mass media, and generated serious discussion about the credibility of DNA evidence. Herein, we present two exemplary assays based on tissue-specific methylation patterns and cell-specific mRNA expression, respectively. These two assays can be integrated into the DNA analysis pipelines without consumption of additional samples. We show that the two assays can not only distinguish between artificial and genuine samples, but also provide information on tissue origin. The two assays were tested on natural and artificial bloodstains (generated by polymerase chain reaction and whole genome amplification technique) and the results illustrated that the logical framework of forensic identification is still useful for forensic identification with the high credibility.\n\nHigh-speed video analysis of forward and backward spattered blood droplets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nComiskey, Patrick; Yarin, Alexander; Attinger, Daniel\n\n2017-11-01\n\nHigh-speed videos of blood spatter due to a gunshot taken by the Ames Laboratory Midwest Forensics Resource Center are analyzed. The videos used in this analysis were focused on a variety of targets hit by a bullet which caused either forward, backward, or both types of blood spatter. The analysis process utilized particle image velocimetry and particle analysis software to measure drop velocities as well as the distributions of the number of droplets and their respective side view area. This analysis revealed that forward spatter results in drops travelling twice as fast compared to backward spatter, while both types of spatter contain drops of approximately the same size. Moreover, the close-to-cone domain in which drops are issued is larger in forward spatter than in the backward one. The inclination angle of the bullet as it penetrates the target is seen to play a significant role in the directional preference of the spattered blood. Also, the aerodynamic drop-drop interaction, muzzle gases, bullet impact angle, as well as the aerodynamic wake of the bullet are seen to greatly influence the flight of the drops. The aim of this study is to provide a quantitative basis for current and future research on bloodstain pattern analysis. This work was financially supported by the United States National Institute of Justice (award NIJ 2014-DN-BXK036).\n\n[Evaluation of visualization of biological stains with the use of alternative light source (ALS) for the purpose of genetic identification.

Experimental bloodstains on the bright base were the most clearly seen in the natural light and white light, up to blood dilution of 1:600. Complete typeability of AmpFISTR SGM Plus kit profiles was obtained from bloodstains at dilution 1:1500. Partial AmpFISTR SGM Plus kit profiles were typed from bloodstains at dilutions 1:1750 and 1:2000. Experimental saliva stains on the light-colored base were completely invisible in the natural light and white light, while they were visualized at wavelength range 300-415 nm through yellow goggles, and at wavelength range 300-455 nm through orange goggles at saliva dilution 1: 600. Complete typeability of AmpFISTR SGM Plus kit loci was obtained from saliva stains at dilution 1:1750. Partial AmpFISTR SGM Plus kit profiles were typed from saliva stains at dilution 1:2000. The wavelength of 455 nm and orange goggles were the optimal set for visualization of bloodstains on various, noncontrasting materials. Other useful wavelength/combinations of goggles were CSS light/red goggles. In case of saliva, the most useful general condition for visualization of stains on various, non-contrasting materials was with the wavelength set to 300-415 nm, while wearing yellow goggles. Other useful combinations of wavelength/goggles were 300-455 nm/orange or red goggles, and also CSS light/orange or red goggles.\n\nGeneral aviation air traffic pattern safety analysis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParker, L.
