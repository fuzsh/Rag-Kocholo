glycan-derived monosaccharides in a sample.\n\nthe present disclosure also provides a method for detecting or monitoring a disease or disorder in a patient.\n\nthe present disclosure provides a method of determining aberrant glycotransferase activity.\n\nthe present disclosure further provides a system for analyzing or comparing glycans in a sample.\n\nGlycans are complex, heterogenous biological sugar polymers generally found attached to protein or lipids and are displayed on cell and macromolecular surfaces. Glycans are created in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus organelles by enzymes known as glycotransferases. The molecular structure of glycans strongly affects the biological activity of the protein or lipid to which it is attached. Aberrant glycotransferase activity (which, in turn, produces aberrant glycan structures) is a well-known hallmark of essentially every known type of cancer.\n\nthe altered expression of a single glycotransferase can result in the production of a complex, heterogeneous mixture of n unique, abnormal whole-glycan structures rather than in an uniformly increase expression of a single whole-glycan structure ( FIG. 1 ).\n\nThese heterogeneous mixtures of whole-glycan structures are often very difficult to fully characterize.\n\nexisting cancer biomarkers that are based on intact glycan structure are generally based on one or a few particular aberrant glycan structures (out of n) or perhaps as set of very closely related aberrant glycan structures that result in a unique antibody or lectin epitope.\n\nOne known method for characterizing glycans on the basis of molecular weight consists of permethylation, release from the protein substrate, and analysis intact by mass spectrometry.\n\na pre-isolated glycan or pre-isolated O-linked glycoprotein is permethylated, purified and analyzed intact by MALDI-mass spectrometry (MS) or liquid chromatography (LC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS.\n\nMS MALDI-mass spectrometry\n\nLC liquid chromatography\n\nESI electrospray ionization\n\nN-linked glycans by this approach would require preliminary cleavage from their protein substrates (usually by enzyme), followed by isolation then permethylation.\n\nGoetz et al. describe their method as a means to analyze pre-isolated glycoproteins or glycans. They do not consider complex mixtures of glycoproteins, whole biofluids or tissues.\n\nglycan methylation analysis A second known method for characterizing pre-isolated glycans known as glycan methylation analysis was developed by the University of Georgia's Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC) [Heiss et al. (âThe structure of Cryptococcus neoformans galactoxylomannan contains beta-D-glucuronic acid,â Carbohydrate Research 2009, 344(7), pp 915-20)].\n\nThis method is a trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)-based methylation analysis and consists of permethylation, hydrolysis, reduction and acetylation\n\nthe present disclosure provides a method for analyzing glycan-derived monosaccharides in a sample.\n\nthe method comprises (a) permethylating a sample comprising glycans; (b) partially purifying the permethylated glycans; (c) hydrolyzing the permethylated glycans thereby forming permethylated monosaccharides; (d) reducing the permethylated monosaccharides thereby forming partially methylated alditols; (e) acetylating the partially methylated alditol thereby forming partially methylated alditol acetates; (f) partially purifying the partially methylated alditol acetates; and (g) analyzing partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) using a substance identification procedure.\n\nPMAAs partially methylated alditol acetates\n\nthe glycans comprise a member selected from the group consisting of N-linked glycans, glycolipids and O-linked glycans.\n\nstep (a) includes an initial substep of mixing the sample comprising glycans with as labeled chemical substance.\n\nthe labeled chemical substance is a monosaccharide selected from the group consisting of heavy, stable-isotope labeled glucose, heavy fucose, heavy xylose, heavy galactose, heavy mannose, heavy N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), heavy N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and combinations thereof in other aspects\n\nthe labeled chemical substance is a polysaccharide comprising a saccharide selected from the group consisting of heavy, stable isotope labeled glucose, heavy fucose, heavy xylose, heavy galactose, heavy mannose, heavy N-acetylglucosamine GlcNAc), heavy N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and combinations thereof.\n\nstep (b) comprises liquid/liquid extraction, in some aspects of this embodiment, step (b) comprises adding a solution of NaCl followed by a halogenated organic solvent.\n\nthe halogenated solvent is chloroform.\n\nstep (d) uses a reducing agent selected from the group consisting of NaBH 4 , NaBD 4 and a combination thereof.\n\nstep (f) comprises liquid/liquid extraction.\n\nanalyzing partially methylated alditol acetates detects an increased or decreased concentration of glycan nodes.\n\nthe glycan nodes comprise monosaccharide-and-linkage-specific glycan chain links exhibiting molecular surrogacy for glycotransferase activity.\n\nthe glycan nodes comprise glycan monosaccharides selected from the group consisting of terminal fucose, 3-linked fucose, terminal xylose, 2-linked xylose, 4-linked xylose, terminal glucose, terminal mannose, terminal galactose, 2-linked glucose, 3-linked glucose, 2-linked mannose, 4-linked galactose, 4-linked mannose, 4-linked glucose, 3-linked mannose, 2-linked galactose, 3-linked galactose, 6-linked glucose, 6-linked mannose, 6-linked galactose, 3,4-linked galactose, 3,4-linked glucose, 2,4-linked glucose, 3,6-linked glucose, 2,3,4-linked glucose, 3,4,6-linked glucose, 3,4,6-linked galactose, 2,3-linked galactose, 2,\n\nstep (a) includes the substep of initially removing one or more of compounds selected from the group consisting of glycolipid, N-linked glycans and O-linked glycans.\n\nstep (e) comprises pre-saturating an acetic anhydride reagent with water prior to adding it to the partially methylated alditol.\n\nthe present disclosure also provides a method for detecting or monitoring a disease or disorder in a patient.\n\nthe method comprises (a) obtaining a sample comprising glycans from a patient; (b) permethylating the glycans; (c) partially purifying the permethylated glycans; (d) hydrolyzing the permethylated glycans thereby forming permethylated monosaccharides; (e) reducing the permethylated monosaccharides thereby forming partially methylated alditols; (f) acetylating the partially methylated alditol thereby forming partially methylated alditol acetates; and (g) detecting the altered presence of glycan nodes; wherein the altered presence of glycans nodes is associated with a disease or a disorder.\n\nthe disease or disorder is cancer.

The present disclosure also provides a method for detecting or monitoring a disease or disorder in a patient. In addition, the present disclosure provides a method of determining aberrant glycotransferase activity. The present disclosure further provides a system for analyzing or comparing glycans in a sample.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nGlycans are complex, heterogenous biological sugar polymers generally found attached to protein or lipids and are displayed on cell and macromolecular surfaces. Glycans are created in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus organelles by enzymes known as glycotransferases. The molecular structure of glycans strongly affects the biological activity of the protein or lipid to which it is attached. Aberrant glycotransferase activity (which, in turn, produces aberrant glycan structures) is a well-known hallmark of essentially every known type of cancer.\n\nThe altered expression of a single glycotransferase can result in the production of a complex, heterogeneous mixture of n unique, abnormal whole-glycan structures rather than in an uniformly increase expression of a single whole-glycan structure (FIG. 1). These heterogeneous mixtures of whole-glycan structures are often very difficult to fully characterize. Thus, existing cancer biomarkers that are based on intact glycan structure are generally based on one or a few particular aberrant glycan structures (out of n) or perhaps as set of very closely related aberrant glycan structures that result in a unique antibody or lectin epitope.\n\nOne known method for characterizing glycans on the basis of molecular weight consists of permethylation, release from the protein substrate, and analysis intact by mass spectrometry. In this approach, a pre-isolated glycan or pre-isolated O-linked glycoprotein is permethylated, purified and analyzed intact by MALDI-mass spectrometry (MS) or liquid chromatography (LC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS. Goetz et al. (âEnzymatic/Chemical Release of O-Glycans Allowing MS Analysis at High Sensitivity.â Anal. Chem., 2009, 81 (23), pp 9546-9552) describe this method. Importantly, Goetz et al. state that their method does not release N-linked glycans from proteins and they did not discuss glycolipids in this paper. The analysis of N-linked glycans by this approach would require preliminary cleavage from their protein substrates (usually by enzyme), followed by isolation then permethylation. Most notably, Goetz et al. describe their method as a means to analyze pre-isolated glycoproteins or glycans. They do not consider complex mixtures of glycoproteins, whole biofluids or tissues.\n\nA second known method for characterizing pre-isolated glycans known as glycan methylation analysis was developed by the University of Georgia's Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC) [Heiss et al. (âThe structure of Cryptococcus neoformans galactoxylomannan contains beta-D-glucuronic acid,â Carbohydrate Research 2009, 344(7), pp 915-20)]. This method is a trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)-based methylation analysis and consists of permethylation, hydrolysis, reduction and acetylation\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present disclosure provides a method for analyzing glycan-derived monosaccharides in a sample.

This method provides, for the first time, an analysis of O-linked protein glycans, N-linked protein glycans and glycolipids.\n\nThe method comprises the steps of (a) permethylating a sample comprising glycans; (b) partially purifying the permethylated glycans; (c) hydrolyzing the permethylated glycans thereby forming permethylated monosaccharides; (d) reducing the permethylated monosaccharides thereby forming partially methylated alditols; (e) acetylating the partially methylated alditol thereby forming partially methylated alditol acetates; (f) partially purifying the partially methylated alditol acetates; and (g) analyzing partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) using a substance identification procedure.\n\nSamples used in the methods of this disclosure may be obtained from a patient. As used herein, the term âpatientâ means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably, a mouse, rat, other rodent, rabbit, dog, cat, swine, cattle, sheep, horse, or primate, and even more preferably a human.\n\nThe sample may be blood, plasma, serum, seminal fluid, prostatic fluid, tissue, other biofluid optionally derived from tissue ex vivo or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the sample is derived from a diseased organ, tissue or secretion therefrom. Samples derived from a diseased organ or tissue include, but are not limited to sputum, prostatic fluid or semen, lung tissue, breast tissue, liver tissue, colon tissue and prostate tissue.\n\nThe samples used in the methods of this disclosure comprise glycans. In some embodiments, the glycans comprise one or more members selected from the group consisting N-linked glycans, glycolipids and O-linked glycans.\n\nIn step (a) of the method for analyzing glycan-derived monosaccharides in a sample, the sample comprising glycans is permethylated. Permethylation can be carried out according to methods known in the art. In some embodiments, permethylation comprises mixing the sample with a base and a methyl halide. The base can be sodium hydroxide and the methyl halide can be iodomethane.\n\nIn some embodiments, permethylation is performed, over solid phase sodium hydroxide. The permethylating mixture can be allowed to sit on the beads with occasional mixing. This embodiment simplifies processing samples in batches.\n\nIn some embodiments, step (a) includes an initial substep of mixing the sample comprising glycans with a labeled chemical substance. The labeled chemical substance can be a monosaccharide selected from the group consisting of heavy, stable-isotope labeled glucose, heavy fucose, heavy xylose, heavy galactose, heavy mannose, heavy N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), heavy N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and combinations thereof. Alternatively, the labeled chemical substance is a polysaccharide comprising a saccharide selected from the group consisting of heavy, stable isotope labeled glucose, heavy fucose, heavy xylose, heavy galactose, heavy mannose, heavy N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), heavy N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and combinations thereof. The labeled chemical substance can be added for purposes of quantification.\n\nIn some embodiments, step (a) includes the substep of initially removing one or more of compounds selected from the group consisting of glycolipid, N-linked glycans and O-linked glycans. Pre-isolation of glycolipid, N-linked glycans and O-linked glycans may be desirable in diagnostic applications. When the glycolipid is removed, it can be removed by liquid/liquid extraction using methods known in the art. See, Mills et al., âSynthesis of novel internal standards for the quantitative determination of plasma ceramide trihexoside in Fabry disease by tandem mass spectrometry,â FEBS Lett 515 (1-3), pp 171-6, When N-linked glycans or O-linked glycans are removed, they can be removed by enzymatic treatment or chemical methods, respectively, using methods known in the art. See, e.g., Higgins, âCarbohydrate analysis throughout the development of a protein therapeutic,â Glycoconj J 27 (2), pp 211-25.\n\nIn step (b) of the method for analyzing glycan-derived monosaccharides in a sample, the permethylated glycans are partially purified. As used herein, the term âpartially purifying permethylated glycansâ refers to methods of at least partially removing permethylated glycans from a mixture of other compounds.\n\nIn some embodiments, partially purifying permethylated glycans comprises liquid/liquid extraction. With liquid/liquid extraction, the partially purified permethylated glycans is in the organic phase. In some embodiments, the liquid/liquid extraction is repeated until the organic phase is clear.\n\nLiquid/liquid extraction, in some embodiments, comprises adding a solution of NaCl followed by a halogenated organic solvent. The halogenated organic solvent can be methylene chloride or chloroform. Adding the solution of NaCl prior to the halogenated organic solvent reduces the number of liquid/liquid extractions steps needed to partially purify the permethylated glycans. This reduces the amount of solvent used in the liquid/liquid extraction and saves a significant amount of sample processing time.\n\nIn step (c) of the method for analyzing glycan-derived monosaccharides in a sample, the permethylated glycans are hydrolyzed to form permethylated monosaccharides. The permethylated glycans can be hydrolyzed according to any method known in the art. In some embodiments, the permethylated glycans are hydrolyzed by acid. In some embodiments, the acid can be trifluoroacetic acid.\n\nIn step (d) of the method for analyzing glycan-derived monosaccharides in a sample, the permethylated monosaccharides are reduced to partially methylated alditols. The reducing agent used in this step can be any known in the art. In some embodiments, the reducing agent selected from the group consisting of NaBH4, NaBD4 and a combination thereof.\n\nIn step (e) of the method for analyzing glycan-derived monosaccharides in a sample, the partially methylated alditols are acetylated thereby forming partially methylated alditol acetates. The acetylation step can be performed using any known acetylating reagent. In some embodiments, the acetylating, reagent is acetic anhydride.\n\nIn some embodiments, step (e) comprises pre-saturating an acetic anhydride reagent with water prior to adding it to the partially methylated alditol. In some embodiments, the acetic anhydride reagent is acetic anhydride. This embodiment can improve the yield and consistency of yield of HexNAc residues (e.g., N-acetylglucosamines and N-acetylgalactosamines.\n\nIn step (f) of the method for analyzing glycan-derived monosaccharides in a sample, the partially methylated alditol acetates are partially purified. Step (f) is performed in the same way as described above for step (b).\n\nIn step (g) of the method for analyzing glycan-derived monosaccharides in a sample, the partially methylated ald"
