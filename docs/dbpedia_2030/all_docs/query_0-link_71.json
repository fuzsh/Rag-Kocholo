With only a 100-bed hospital, most lived in small bamboo huts. Those more able-bodied patients engaged in crude agriculture and fishing. Except for those who started families in the colony, patients were separated from relatives and the rest of society and lived in isolation and poverty.\n\nJapanese Occupation - WWII\n\n1943 ND Issue\n\nP103 - 5 Centavos\n\nFront: Banana plants\n\nSize: 120 x 58 mm P108 - 10 Pesos\n\nFront: Banana plants\n\nSize: 160 x 67 mm P110 - 5 Peso\n\nSerial Number: 0069879\n\nFront: Rizal Monument at left\n\nWatermark: Banana tree\n\nSize: 160 x 68 mm\n\nThe Rizal Monument is a monument near the west end of Rizal Park in Manila, Philippines, built to commemorate the Filipino nationalist, Jose Rizal.

Aquino operated a store, which became a refuge for the sick and wounded revolutionaries. She fed, gave medical attention to and encouraged the revolutionaries with motherly advice and prayers. Secret meetings of the Katipuneros (revolutionaries) were also held at her house. Thus she earned the name, \"Mother of the Katipunan\" or revolution. When the Spaniards learned about her activities and her knowledge to the whereabouts of the Katipuneros, she was asked where there were hiding but refused to conquerors steadily. She was then arrested by the Guardia Civil and was deported to the Mariana Islands. After the United States took control of the Philippines in 1898, Aquino, like other exiles, returned to Philippines until her death on March 2, 1919 at the age of 107.\n\nBanko Sentral Ng Pilipinas\n\n1978 ND Issue\n\nP159c - 2 Piso\n\nSerial Number: FE719220\n\nFront: Jose Risal at left, serial number at lower left and upper right, Central Bank Seal Type 4 at bottom right\n\nBack: Scene of Aguinaldo's Independence Declaration on 12 June 1898\n\nWatermark: Jose Rizal\n\nSignature: Ferinand Marcos (President) and Jaime C.
