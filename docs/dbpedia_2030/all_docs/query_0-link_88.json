        "text": "Years back, I remember writing a blog about Iloilo City. I call it “My City by the River”. For a sentimental soul like me, the river crisscrossing the city, touches a sentimental chord. I can’t have enough sunsets and river views! I walk the esplanade with friends and with my son Hezekiah, who paid me a quick visit in January.\n\nIt’s not only the river that attracts me to the city. I respect how it preserves its culture and the arts. In December 2018, I was able to visit two (2) lovely museums in the city plus a side trip to Casa Mariquit. I first went to Museo Iloilo at the City Proper. Museo Iloilo features various fossils and historical artifacts. It also hosts paintings and sculptures. I understand from my talk with the museum guide that the museum hosts Ilonggo artists’ artworks. I think it’s fantastic that Ilonggo artists’ artworks are provided a good venue for exhibition and promotion. Kudos to the management of the museum!\n\nI requested a guided tour because I find it very educational and enlightening. The greatest part was meeting the elementary teacher of Myla Dano. Myla was all joy introducing her former teacher to me. Imagine meeting your former teacher in a museum. It’s totally serendipity and quite historical! No pun intended. Truth of the matter, I have always been bewitched by museums. I have been to several museums in the country - it’s one of my adult life’s little pleasures.\n\nThen we went to Casa Mariquit. It was purely enchanting. The story of the house is intricately embedded in the affluence and illustriousness of the original occupants. Climbing the staircase is like entering a passageway into a powerful and riveting past. It will transport you to a time and place that’s totally preserved in history. I sat on the chair of former Vice President Fernando H. Lopez. Yes, I did, and took photos! But who is former Vice President Lopez? A little background check would be informative. Lopez entered politics when he was picked by President Sergio Osmeña to be Mayor of Iloilo City in 1945. In 1947, he ran for Senator and won. He served as Vice President of the Philippines for three (3) terms: once under Elpidio R. Quirino (1949-1953) for the Liberal Party and twice under Ferdinand E. Marcos (1965-1969 and 1969-1972) for the Nacionalista Party. Former Vice President Lopez was born on April 13, 1904 in Jaro, Iloilo (that’s right! Iloilo) to Benito Lopez and Presentacion Hofilena. He studied at the San Juan de Letran College, where he finished high school in 1921, and at the University of Santo Tomas, where he obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1925 and thereafter, passed the bar examinations.\n\nAs I researched further, I found his speech in the Presidential Museum and Library published online. It was delivered in 1950. Lopez, F. (1950) was the speech he gave on the occasion of the “Made-in-the-Philippines Products Week” celebration. It is found in the Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines, 46(2), 406-409. It is a beautiful, well-crafted, and inspired speech that still resonates up to this date and age.\n\nReturning to my surreal experience, I likewise sat on the chair where he presumably did his favorite pastime game, chess. What made it more dreamlike was the chandelier above the chess table. Probing further, I saw his Certificate from the Supreme Court of the Philippines attesting to his passing the bar exams. I must say that it is absolutely remarkable that these items are preserved up to this day and age. I felt honoured to have entered Casa Mariquit. Reading and seeing are two different things. While it is true that reading will bring us across places in our minds and imagination, however, seeing and touching give it more flesh and reality. You can be in the present while reliving the past.\n\nMoving forward. On the same day, we also proceeded to Iloilo Museum for Contemporary Art at Casa de Emperador situated at the Iloilo Business Park in Mandurriao. Contemporary artworks would fill your eyes and senses inside this avantgarde museum. I had a great sense of appreciation coming from a historical perspective early in the day and progressing to a contemporary exhibition towards the end of the day. What a mighty day that was! To cap the museum tour that fine December day, we modelled by the 8.8-meter bronze statue of Iloilo’s revolutionary hero General Martin Delgado.\n\nIloilo indeed is a rich city. Rich not only materially but more importantly at its core - its arts, history, and culture."
