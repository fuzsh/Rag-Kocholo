Osmeña had previously served as the Vice President of the Philippines and had been a prominent figure in Philippine politics for many years. He was also known for his moderate and conciliatory approach, which was seen as valuable in a time of political and social instability. Additionally, Osmeña was respected for his leadership during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II, and his willingness to work with the occupying forces was seen as a pragmatic decision to protect the Filipino people. Overall, Osmeña was seen as a figure who could provide stability and continuity during a tumultuous period in Philippine history, which led to his selection as president of the Second Republic."
