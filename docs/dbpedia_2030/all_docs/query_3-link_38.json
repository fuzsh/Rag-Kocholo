        "text": "CEBU, Philippines -- The body of Sergio Osmena, a popular opposition leader who died a 'lonely' man in the United States after fleeing the Philippines on the eve of martial law, today was flown back to his home town.\n\nOsmena, who unsuccessfully challenged President Ferdinand Marcos for the presidency in 1969 and later was charged with plotting to assassinate him, died of a massive heart attack last Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 67.\n\n'He died lonely, wanting to return to this country,' said his tearful daughter, Minnie Osmena, who accompanied her father's body home. 'That's why, in spite of the political risks, I am returning. I know his goals and will pursue them.'\n\nOsmena's father became president of the Philippines in 1944 and ran the government while in exile in the United States during the Japanese occupation in World War II.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Michael Armacost, Philippine opposition leaders and Manila Mayor Ramon Bagatsing were among those who paid final respects at the Manila airport as Osmena's body arrived from the United States.\n\nThe body of the former senator, who spent more than 14 years in exile in the United States, was then flown to his home town of Cebu, the nation's third largest city and a traditional opposition stronghold.\n\nA crowd of about 250 people watched as Osmena's coffin, draped with a Philippine flag, was carried off the plane.\n\nOsmena, who also served as mayor of Cebu and provincial governor, is to lie in state at a 16th century Santo Nino church next to the cross of Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who landed in Cebu in 1521.\n\nSome 5,000 people today filed past the body, laid in a half-open coffin, and 50,000 were expected by the weekend.\n\nOsmena will be buried Saturday at a family mausoleum.\n\nMarcos declared a special public holiday in the city and the province of Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila. Flags were ordered flown at half-mast to honor the opposition leader.\n\n'He was my opponent but we fought without rancor,' Marcos, 66, said in a statement.\n\nFour times elected Cebu mayor, Osmena was seriously wounded in a grenade attack at an opposition rally in April 1971. He fled to the United States on Sept. 15, 1972, seven days before Marcos declared martial law.\n\nThe government charged Osmena and some 30 other Filipinos and foreigners with plotting to assassinate Marcos and stage a coup in 1972. It cited at least seven assassination attempts against Marcos and his wife, Imelda, that year as part of the reason for imposing martial law.\n\nOsmena's son also was charged with plotting to kill Marcos and was among thousands arrested in the early days of martial law. But in a daring prison escape in 1976 he was whisked out of the country and has since lived in California."
