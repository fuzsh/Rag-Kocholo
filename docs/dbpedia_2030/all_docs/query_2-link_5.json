Incumbent president Sergio Osmeña ran for a full term but was defeated by Senator Manuel Roxas. Meanwhile, senator Elpidio Quirino defeated fellow senator Eulogio Rodriguez to become vice president.\n\nSoon after the reconstitution of the Commonwealth government in 1945, Senators Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, and their allies called for an early national election to choose the president and vice president of the Philippines, as well as the members of Congress. In December 1945, the House Insular Affairs Committee of the United States Congress approved the joint resolution, setting the election date by April 30, 1946.\n\nPrompted by this congressional action, President Sergio Osmeña called the Philippine Congress to a three-day special session. Congress enacted Commonwealth Act No. 725, setting the election date on April 23, 1946. President Osmeña signed the act on January 5, 1946.\n\nThree parties presented their respective candidates for the different national elective positions. These were the Nacionalista Party, the Conservative (Osmeña) Wing, the Liberal Wing of the Nacionalista Party, and the Partido Modernista. The Nacionalistas had Osmeña and Senator Eulogio Rodriguez as their candidates for President and vice president, respectively. The Modernistas chose Hilario Camino Moncado and Luis Salvador for the same positions. On the other hand, the standard bearers of the Liberals were Senators Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino.\n\nOn January 3, 1946, President Osmeña announced his candidacy for President. On January 22, 1946, Eulogio Rodriguez was nominated as Osmeña's running mate for Vice President in a convention held at Ciro's Club in Manila. According to the Manila Chronicle:\n\nThe convention opened at 10:15 in the morning when the acting secretary of the party, Vicente Farmoso, called the confab to order.\n\nCongressman Jose C. Romero, who delivered the keynote speech, accused Senate President Manuel Roxas and his followers of fanning the flames of discontent among the people, capitalizing on the people's hardship, and minimizing the accomplishment of the [Osmeña] Administration. These men with the Messiah complex have been the country's and world's bane. This is the mentality that produces Hitlers and Mussolinis, and in their desire to climb to power, they even want to destroy the party which placed them where they are today.\n\nSenator Carlos P. Garcia, who delivered the nomination speech for President Sergio Osmeña, recited Osmeña's achievements and virtues as a public official and private citizen.\n\nEntering the convention hall at about 7:30 p.m., President Osmeña, accompanied by the committee on notification, was greeted with cheer and applause as he ascended the platform. President Osmeña delivered his speech, a general outline of his plans once elected. He emphasized that as far as his party is concerned, independence is a close issue. It was coming on July 4, 1946.[1]\n\nOn January 19, 1946, Senator Roxas announced his candidacy for President in a convention held in Santa Ana Cabaret in Makati, Rizal. According to the Manila Chronicle:\n\n...more than three thousand (by conservative estimates, there were only 1,000 plus) delegates, party members, and hero worshipers jammed into suburban, well-known Santa Ana Cabaret (biggest in the world) to acclaim ex-katipunero and Bagong Katipunan organizer Manuel Acuña Roxas as the guidon bearer of the Nacionalista Party's Liberal Wing.\n\nThe delegates from all over the Islands met in a formal convention from 10:50 a.m. and broke up at about 5:30 p.m.\n\nThey elected 1. Mariano J. Cuenco, professional Osmeñaphobe, as temporary chairman; 2. Jose Avelino and ex-pharmacist Antonio Zacarias, permanent chairman and secretary, respectively; 3. nominated forty-four candidates for senators; 4. heard the generalissimo himself deliver an oratorical masterpiece consisting of 50 per cent attacks against the (Osmeña) Administration, 50 per cent promises, pledges. Rabid Roxasites greeted the Roxas acceptance speech with hysterical applause.[2]\n\nPresident Osmeña tried to prevent the split in the Nacionalista Party by offering Senator Roxas the position of Philippine Regent Commissioner to the United States, but the latter turned down the offer.\n\nAs a result of the split among the members of the Nacionalista Party, owing to marked differences of opinion on specific vital issues of which no settlement had been reached, a new political organization was born and named the Liberal Wing of the Nacionalista Party, which would later become the Liberal Party.\n\nThe election was generally peaceful and orderly except in some places where passions ran high, especially in Pampanga. According to the \"controversial\" decision of the Electoral Tribunal of the House of Representatives on Meliton Soliman vs. Luis Taruc, Pampanga \"was under the terroristic clutches and control of the Hukbalahaps. So terrorized were the people of Arayat were terrorized; at one time, 200 persons abandoned their homes, work, food, and belongings in a mass evacuation to the Poblacion due to fear and terror.\"\n\nA total of 2,596,880 voters went to the polls to elect their President and Vice President, who was to be the Commonwealth's last and the Republic's first. President Osmena chose not to actively campaign, saying the Filipinos knew his record of 40 years of loyal service to the country.\n\nFour days after election day, the Liberal candidates were proclaimed victors. Roxas registered a majority of votes in 34 provinces and nine cities: Abra, Agusan, Albay, Antique, Bataan, Batanes, Batangas, Bukidnon, Bulacan, Cagayan, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Capiz, Cavite, Cotabato, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Isabela, Laguna, La Union, Leyte, Marinduque, Mindoro, Misamis Oriental, Negros Occidental, Nueva Vizcaya, Palawan, Pangasinan, Rizal, Romblon, Samar, Sorsogon, Sulu, Surigao, Tayabas, Zambales, Manila, Quezon City, Bacolod (Negros Occidental), Iloilo City (Iloilo), Baguio (Mountain Province), Zamboanga City (Zamboanga), Tagaytay (Cavite), Cavite City (Cavite) and San Pablo City (Laguna)\n\nLikewise, the Liberal Party won nine out of 16 contested senatorial seats.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, the Liberals achieved a majority with 50 seats won, while the Nacionalistas and the Democratic Alliance were only victorious in 33 and six seats, respectively.\n\nCandidatePartyVotes%Manuel RoxasNacionalista Party (Liberal wing)[a]1,333,00653.93Sergio OsmeñaNacionalista Party[a]1,129,99445.72Hilario MoncadoModernist Party8,5380.35Total2,471,538100.00Valid votes2,471,53895.17Invalid/blank votes125,3424.83Total votes2,596,880100.00Registered voters/turnout2,898,60489.59Source: Nohlen, Grotz, Hartmann, Hasall and Santos[3]\n\nPopular vote Roxas 53.93% Osmeña 45.72% Moncado 0.35%\n\nProvince/City Roxas Osmeña Moncado Abra 6,760 3,813 18 Agusan 9,354 9,219 26 Albay 25,940 24,344 13 Antique 18,271 12,952 19 Bataan 9,468 8,309 4 Batanes 1,326 705 20 Batangas 56,410 24,118 37 Bohol 30,592 40,285 308 Bukidnon 3,011 2,451 150 Bulacan 39,799 38,549 38 Cagayan 15,514 25,605 365 Camarines Norte 10,471 5,482 4 Camarines Sur 33,267 24,214 21 Capiz 41,844 18,161 14 Catanduanes 5,477 8,698 4 Cavite 38,111 11,196 19 Cebu 53,848 98,700 792 Cotabato 17,826 16,490 66 Culion Leper Colony 47 420 0 Davao 11,896 19,226 1,536 Ilocos Norte 25,464 12,097 243 Ilocos Sur 30,322 16,530 34 Iloilo 79,136 43,522 25 Isabela 17,431 9,220 437 La Union 22,499 14,845 157 Laguna 36,527 22,246 26 Lanao 17,212 37,101 991 Leyte 64,236 49,965 155 Manila 82,457 31,513 172 Marinduque 10,596 2,487 8 Masbate 9,730 12,207 27 Mindoro 14,025 9,240 6 Misamis Occidental 11,165 15,926 848 Misamis Oriental 14,307 12,737 153 Mountain Province 8,490 11,369 468 Negros Occidental 62,605 52,982 58 Negros Oriental 13,262 25,594 171 Nueva Ecija 29,478 41,616 28 Nueva Vizcaya 7,458 3,664 9 Palawan 6,317 5,164 7 Pampanga 11,296 69,505 42 Pangasinan 82,081 64,794 56 Rizal 60,103 35,418 101 Romblon 9,200 3,560 17 Samar 37,553 30,793 82 Sorsogon 20,715 17,528 6 Sulu 6,833 9,228 6 Surigao 15,053 12,795 85 Tarlac 16,868 26,193 39 Tayabas 50,224 10,954 16 Zambales 15,811 6,853 16 Zamboanga 15,706 19,413 595 Total 1,333,392 1,129,996 8,538 Source: Bureau of the Census and Statistics[4]\n\nCandidatePartyVotes%Elpidio QuirinoNacionalista Party (Liberal wing)[a]1,161,72552.36Eulogio RodriguezNacionalista Party[a]1,051,24347.38Lou SalvadorModernist Party5,8790.26Total2,218,847100.00Valid votes2,218,84785.44Invalid/blank votes378,03314.56Total votes2,596,880100.00Registered voters/turnout2,898,60489.59Source: Nohlen, Grotz, Hartmann, Hasall and Santos[5]\n\nPopular vote Quirino 52.36% Rodriguez 47.38% Salvador 0.26%\n\nProvince/City Quirino Rodriguez Salvador Abra 6,894 3,092 7 Agusan 8,540 8,131 11 Albay 23,445 21,696 12 Antique 16,749 12,026 55 Bataan 6,424 8,245 17 Batanes 1,466 221 6 Batangas 32,185 22,195 111 Bohol 26,290 34,296 167 Bukidnon 2,899 2,138 99 Bulacan 29,277 38,881 50 Cagayan 21,826 17,226 238 Camarines Norte 10,013 4,894 4 Camarines Sur 31,282 23,052 24 Capiz 36,845 17,494 11 Catanduanes 5,164 8,645 4 Cavite 22,688 17,882 28 Cebu 50,495 92,253 524 Cotabato 17,366 11,718 68 Culion Leper Colony 100 329 1 Davao 12,015 17,629 1,090 Ilocos Norte 26,727 9,672 109 Ilocos Sur 36,158 9,460 12 Iloilo 68,520 40,343 42 Isabela 19,800 5,786 208 La Union 29,126 6,860 104 Laguna 17,724 30,552 26 Lanao 12,638 26,787 594 Leyte 55,873 43,776 139 Manila 67,228 43,197 139 Marinduque 6,405 4,181 27 Masbate 8,378 10,066 32 Mindoro 12,370 7,423 7 Misamis Occidental 8,835 15,046 334 Misamis Oriental 12,245 10,172 132 Mountain Province 11,340 6,530 221 Negros Occidental 56,527 47,011 63 Negros Oriental 11,869 23,000 83 Nueva Ecija 27,949 38,690 46 Nueva Vizcaya 7,095 3,486 21 Palawan 6,219 4,691 7 Pampanga 9,291 64,566 119 Pangasinan 84,775 56,806 45 Rizal 35,512 54,896 50 Romblon 7,482 3,060 24 Samar 34,920 25,586 140 Sorsogon 19,455 15,980 10 Sulu 5,953 7,640 5 Surigao 13,800 11,768 56 Tarlac 17,523 22,813 50 Tayabas 39,338 15,966 35 Zambales 15,370 4,928 39 Zamboanga 13,317 18,462 433 Total 1,161,725 1,051,243 5,879 Source: Bureau of the Census and Statistics[4]\n\nCommission on Elections\n\nPolitics of the Philippines\n\nPhilippine elections\n\nPresident of the Philippines\n\n1st Congress of the Philippines"
