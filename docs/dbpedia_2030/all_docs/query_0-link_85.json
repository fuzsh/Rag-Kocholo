        "text": "Filipino leader who fought first against Spain and later against the United States for the Independence of the Philippines.\n\nBorn of Chinese and Filipino parentage, Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, whom providence had placed as the supreme leader of his people at the critical period in their history. He was born in Kawit, Cavite, on March 22, 1869. He was the seventh among eight children of the spouses Carlos Aguinaldo and Trinidad Famy.\n\nHe took up his secondary course at the Letran de Manila where he finished only three years of high school. His favorite subject was geography. He did not finish the secondary course education.\n\nAt the age of 17, Emilio was elected as cabeza de barangay of Binakayan, the most progressive barrio of Kawit, Cavite. He served for his town-mates for eight years. He also engaged in inter-island shipping, travelling as far as Visayas and even Jolo, Philippines. On January 1, 1895, he was elected capitan municipal of Kawit the first to bear that title in accordance with the Mauro Law. At that time a capitan municipal received no salary except 3% of taxes he could collect. In August 1896 he was the local leader of the Katipunan, a revolutionary society that fought bitterly and successfully against Spanish. In December 1897 he signed an agreement called the Pact of Biac-na-Bato with the Spanish governor-general. He agreed to leave the Philippines and to remain permanently in exile on condition of a substantial financial award from Spain coupled with the promise of liberal reforms. While in Hong Kong and Singapore he made arrangement with representative of the American consulates and of Commodore George Dewey to return to the Philippines to assist the United States in the war against Spain.\n\nAguinaldo return to the Philippines on May 19, 1898 and announced renewal of the struggle with Spain. Upon the advice of Apolinario Mabini to Aguinaldo he should change the form of dictatorship to president of revolutionary government. The Filipinos, who declared their independence of Spain on June 12, 1898, proclaimed a provisional republic, of which Aguinaldo was to became president, and in September a revolutionary assembly met and ratified Filipino independence. However, the Philippines along with Puerto Rico and Guam were ceded by Spain to the United States by the Treaty of Paris, December 10, 1898.\n\nRelation between the Americans and the Filipinos were unfriendly and grew steadily worse. On January 23, 1899, the Malolos constitution by virtue of which the Philippines was a republic and which he had been approved by the assembly and by Aguinaldo was proclaimed. Aguinaldo, who had been president of the provisional government, was elected president.\n\nAguinaldo formally established the first Philippine republic. He also designated diplomats who were assigned in the major world capitals to seek recognition of Philippine independence.\n\nIn 1935 when the commonwealth government of the Philippines was established in preparation for independence, Aguinaldo ran for president but was decisively beaten. He returned to private life until the Japanese invaded the Philippines in 1941. The Japanese used Aguinaldo as an anti-American tool. They caused him to make speeches, to sign articles, and to address a radio appeal to General Douglas McArthur on Corregidor to surrender in order to spare the flower of Filipino youth.\n\nWhen the Americans returned, Aguinaldo was arrested and together with the others accused of collaboration with the Japanese was held for several months in Bilibid Prison until released by presidential amnesty. As a token vindication of his honor, he was appointed by president Elpidio Quirino as a member of the Council of State in 1950. In the latter years of his life, he devoted his major attention to veterans affairs, the promotion of nationalism and democracy in the Philippines, and the improvement of relation between the Philippines and the United States.\n\nAguinaldo resumed his life of retirement. In June 12, 1963, on the occasion of the celebration of Philippine independence, Aguinaldo veiled his historic mansion in Kawit, together with all the relics contained therein, to the Philippine government.\n\nOn February 6, 1964, he died at the age of 95 years old.\n\nFilipino statesman, leader of the independence movement, and first president of the Philippine Commonwealth established under United States tutelage in 1935.\n\nBorn in the small town of Baler province of Tayabas on August 19, 1878.

Manuel spent the early years of his childhood in his hometown among the common people. His first teacher was his mother. He enrolled at the San Juan de Letran college, one of the leading institutions of learning in the capital city. Quezon years at San Juan de Letran as a self-supporting student brought out of his latent potentialities. He finished Bachelor of Arts degree at the age of sixteen.\n\nHe cut short his law studies at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila in 1899 to participate in the struggle for independence against the United States, led by Emilio Aguinaldo. After Aguinaldo surrendered in 1901, however, Quezon returned to the University, obtained his degree (1903), landed fourth place in the 1903 Bar examinations, and practiced law for a year. Convinced that the only way to independence was through cooperation with the United States, he ran for governor of Tayabas province in 1905. Once elected, he served for two years before being elected as representatives in 1907 to the newly established Philippine Assembly.\n\nIn 1909, Quezon was appointed resident commissioner for the Philippines,, entitled to speak, but not vote in the U.S. House of Representative; during his years in Washington D.C., he fought vigorously for a speedy grant of independence by the Unites States. Quezon played a major role in obtaining Congress passage in 1916 of the Jones Act, which pledged independence for the Philippines without giving a specific date when it would take effect. The act gave the Philippines greater autonomy and provided for the creation of a bicameral national legislature modeled after the U.S. Congress. Quezon resigned as a commissioner and returned to Manila to be elected to the newly formed Philippines senate in 1916; he subsequently served as its president until 1935. In 1922 he gained control of the Nacionalista party, which had previously been led by his rival Sergio Osmeña.\n\nQuezon fought for passage of the Tydings McDuffie Act (1934) which provided for full independence for the Philippines ten years after the creation of a constitution and the establishment of a commonwealth government that would be the forerunner of an independence republic. Quezon was elected president of the newly formulated commonwealth on November 15, 1935. As president he reorganized the island military defense (aided by General Douglas McArthur as his special adviser).

Twice in that year he was shot by Philippine guerrillas but recovered, after the incident Laurel still held his post to served the Filipino people. It adds his eagerness and willingness to be of service to his countrymen.\n\nLaurel administration did not last long because when the Japanese occupation near to collapse, Yamashita, a Japanese leader ordered his troops to bring Laurel out from the Philippines, he was brought to Japan.\n\nIn August 15, 1945, Japanese surrendered to Americans. General McArthur order Lt. Col. Turner to arrest Laurel and company for a case of \"Collaboration\". They finally arrested in the City of Nara, Japan and temporary jailed at Sugano Prison near Tokyo, Japan.

Elected to the Senate in 1951, Laurel helped to persuade Ramon Magsaysay, then secretary of defense, to desert the Liberals and join the Nationalist. When Magsaysay became president, Laurel headed an economic mission that in 1955 negotiated an agreement to improve economic relations with the United States.

In 1932 Roxas and Sergio Osmeña, the Nacionalista Party leader, led the Philippine independence mission to Washington D.C., where they influenced the passage of teh Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act. Roxas was later opposed by Quezon, who held that the act compromised future Philippine independence; the Nacionalista Party was split between them on this issue. In 1934, however, Roxas was a member of the convention that drew up a constitution under the revised Philippine Independence and Commonwealth Act (Tydings McDuffie Act). Roxas also served as Secretary of Finance in the Commonwealth government (1938-1940).\n\nDuring World War II Roxas served in the pro-Japanese government of Jose Laurel by acquiring supplies of rice for the Japanese Army.

Roxas was elected president of the commonwealth in 1946 as the nominee of the liberal wing of the Nacionalista Party (which became the Liberal Party), and when independence was declared on July 4 he became the first president of the new republic.\n\nAlthough Roxas was successful in getting rehabilitation funds from the United States after independence, he was forced to concede military bases (23 of which were leased for 99 years), trade restriction for the Philippine citizens, and special privileges for U.S. property owner and investor. His administration was marred by graft and corruption; moreover, the abuses of the provincial military police contributed to the rise of the left-wing Hukbalahap (Huk) movement in the countryside. His heavy-handed attempts to crush the Huks led to widespread peasant disaffection.\n\nRoxas did not stay long in office because of heart attack upon a speech in an occassion in the Clark Air Base in April 15, 1948 and was succeeded by his vice president Elpidio Quirino.\n\nManuel Roxas bereaved wife Doña Trinidad de Leon and children Ruby and Gerardo Roxas who became congressman, senator, and a leader of Liberal Party.\n\nHe died at the age of 44.\n\nMarried to Doña Trinidad de Leon Roxas.

In 1934 he was a member of the Philippine Independence mission to Washington D.C., headed by Manuel Quezon, which secured the passage in Congress of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, setting the date for Philippine independence as July 4, 1946. He was also elected to the convention that drafted a constitution for the new Philippine Commonwealth. Subsequently he served as secretary of finance and secretary of the interior in the Commonwealth government.\n\nAfter World War II, Quirino serve as secretary of state and vice president under the first president of the independence Philippines, Manuel Roxas. When Roxas died on April 15, 1948, Quirino suceeded to the presidency. The following years, he was elected president for a four-year term on the Liberal Party ticket, defeating the Nacionalista candidiate.\n\nPresident Quirino's administration faced a serious threat in the form of the Communist led Hukbalahap (Huk) movement. Though the Huks originally had been an anti-Japanese guerrilla army in Luzon, the Communists steadily gained control over the leadership, and when Quirino's negotiation with Huk commander Luis Taruc broke down in 1948, Taruc openly declared himself a Communist and called for the overthrow of the government. By 1950 the Huks had gained control over a considerable portion of national defense to suppress the insurrection.\n\nQuirino's six years as president were marked by notable postwar reconstruction, general economic gains, and increased economic aid from the United States. Basic social problems, however, particularly in the rural areas, remained unsolved; Quirino's administration was tainted by widespread graft and corruption. The 1949 election, which he had won, were among the most dishonest in the country's history. Magsaysay, who had been largely successful in eliminating the threat of the Huk insurgents, broke with Quirino on the issue of corruption, campaigning for clean elections and defeating Quirino as the Nacionalista candidate in the presidential election of 1953. Subsequently, Quirino retired to private life, in his new country home in Novaliches where he died of heart attack on February 28, 1956.

Idol of the masses, champion of democracy, and freedom fighter.\n\nHe was born in the capital of Iba, Zambales on August 31, 1907. His parents are Exequel Magsaysay and Perfecta Del Fiero.\n\nMagsaysay finished his elementary at the Castillejos, However his secondary course at the Zambales Academy both in his hometown Zambales.\n\nThough most Philippine political leaders were of Spanish descent, Magsaysay was of Malay stock, like most of the common people. He took up mechanical engineering at University of the Philippines but ended up with a commerce degree from Jose Rizal College in Manila in 1933 and became general manager of a Try-Tran transportation company before starting as a mechanic. After serving as a guerrilla leader on Luzon during World War II, he was appointed military governor of his home province, Zambales, by MacArthur, when the United States recaptured the Philippines. He served two terms (1946-50) as a Liberal Party congressman for Zambales, his first experience in politics.\n\nPresident Elpidio Quirino appointed Magsaysay secretary of defense to deal with the threat of the Huks, whose leader, Luis Taruc, in February 1950 established a People's Liberation Army and called for the overthrow of the government. Magsaysay then carried out until 1953 one of the most successful anti-guerrilla campaigns in modern history. Realizing that the Huks could not survive without popular support, he strove to win the trust of the peasants by offering land and tools to those who came over to the government side and by insisting that army units treat the people with respect. Reforming the army, he dismissed corrupt and incompetent officers and emphasized mobility and flexibility in combat operations against the guerrillas. By 1953, Huks were no longer a serious threat, but Magsaysay's radical measures had made many enemies for him within the government, compelling him to resign on February 28, when he charge the Quirino administration with corruption and incompetence.\n\nAlthough Magsaysay was a Liberal, the Nacionalista Party successfully backed him for the presidency against Quirino in the 1953 elections, winning the support of Carlos P. Garcia, who had organized a third party. Magsaysay promised reform in every segment of Philippine life, but he was frustrated in his efforts by a conservative congress that represented the interest of the wealthy. Despite initial support of Congress in July 1955.\n\nMagsaysay was unable to pass effective land reform legislation; government indifference to the plight of the peasants then undid most of his good work in gaining the support of the people against the Huks. Neverthless, he remained extremely popular and had a well deserve reputation for incorruptibility.\n\nIn foreign policy, Magsaysay remained a close friend and supporter of the United States and a vocal spokesman against communism during the Cold War. He made the Philippines a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which was established in Manila on September 8, 1954. Before the expiration of his term as president, Magsaysay was killed when his airplane crashed at Mount Pinatubo in the early morning of March 17, 1957, he was succeeded by the vice president, Carlos P. Garcia. The nation was shocked upon learning of Magsaysay sudden death, most of the Filipino people mourned because the nation lost a well loved leader, who in his lifetime become a legendary figure in Philippine politics.\n\nHe left his bereaved wife Luz Banzon, children Teresita, Milagros Magsaysay Valenzuela and Ramon Magsaysay Jr., a proclaim winner in May 8, 1995 Senatorial election.\n\nMagsaysay died at the age of 50 years old.\n\nFilipino reformist president of the Republic of the Philippines.\n\nBest known as the \"Champion of the Common Man.\"\n\nHe was born in Barrio San Nicolas, Lubao, Pampanga, on September 28, 1910.

During World War II, he practiced law in Manila and aided the anti-Japanese resistance. After the war he worked in a law firm and in 1948 served as second secretary to the Philippine Embassy in Washington, D.C. The following year was elected to a seat in the Philippine House of Representatives, serving until 1956. During this time he was Philippine representative to the United Nations General Assembly three times. From 1957 to1961, Macapagal was a member of the Liberal Party and vice president under Nacionalista President Carlos P. Garcia. In the 1961 elections, however he ran against former president Carlos P. Garcia forging a coalition of the Liberal and progressive parties and making a crusade against corruption a principal element of his platform. He was elected by a wide margin.\n\nWhile president, Diosdado Macapagal worked to suppress graft and corruption and to stimulate the Philippine economy. He placed the Peso in the free currency-exchange market, encouraged wealthiest families, which cost the treasury millions of pesos yearly. His reforms, however, were crippled by a House Representatives and Senate dominated by the Nacionalistas, and he was defeated in the 1965 elections by Ferdinand E. Marcos.\n\nMacapagals administration (1961 - 1965) is best remembered for resetting the date of the celebration of Philippine Independence Day  from July 4 when the U.S. turned over the reins of government in 1946 to the more correct date of June 12 when Aguinaldo declared independence in 1898.\n\nIn 1972 he chaired the convention that drafted the 1973 constitution only to question in 1981 the validity of its ratification.

According to his scholastic records, Marcos always got an honor from his elementary and secondary course. He is best in oratory speeches as well as in debate and declamatory speeches.\n\nMarcos attended school in Manila and studied law in the late 1930s at the University of the Philippines, in Quezon City. Tried for the assassination in 1933 of a political opponent of his politician father, Marcos was found guilty in November 1939. But he argued his case on appeal to the Philippine Supreme Court, acquittal a year later. He become a trial lawyer in Manila. During World War II he served as an officer with the Philippine Armed Forces. Captured by the Japanese, he survived the Death March from Bataan to Central Luzon and then escaped. Marcos subsequent claims to being an important leader in the Filipino guerrilla resistance movement were a central factor in his later political success, but U.S. government archives revealed that he actually played little or no part in anti-Japanese activities during 1942-45.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1947 Marcos was a technical assistant to Manuel Roxas, the first president of the independent Philippine Republic. He was a member of House of Representatives (1949-1959) and of the Senate (1959-1965). Serving as Senate President (1963-1965).
