        "text": "This slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nby: CEMANDU (Cebu-Mandaue-Dumaguete) GROUP\n\nWriter/Editor : LUDELIZA C. LOPEZ\n\nCaption : JOU ANN S. BAGUIO/ LUCRESIA A. LOPEZ\n\nPhotographer : ETHIL LEPANGLEPANG-CARBO\n\nCameraman/Model : DAN P. ALAR\n\nBought by College Assurance Plan (CAP) on 1984, the old house of former President Sergio Osmeña Sr. was transformed into an adaptive re-use. The lower part of the house is used as offices while the upper part is used to keep the memorabilia and some personal belongings of the former president.\n\n“This house was bought by CAP from Ramon Osmeña, his son from his second wife Esperanza. Iya man ning share. (This is his share.) The preservation of this old house was initiated by former senator Manuel Manahan.” said Mrs. Joy Toledo, wife of the caretaker of Osmeña Museum.\n\nThe original house was built on August 20, 1947. The permit was granted to Mrs. Esperanza Osmeña to construct a building of strong materials with the area of 228 square meters on the first floor and 229 square meters on the second floor. “If you want to see the building permit, you can see that one at the left side of Osmeña Room”, Mrs. Toledo added. The room now is used by the caretaker as his office where he also stores his antique collections.\n\nBeside the Osmeña Room is McArthur Room. Inside this, one can see the different antiques, memorabilia, the two flags of America and Philippines, his old clothings which are left to deteriorate in the corner and most of all his prized Cadillac. “Gitawag na sya nga McArthur Room kay bestfriend baya na sila ni General Douglas McArthur. Kung moabot si General McArthur gikan sa America, anhi man na sya mo-stay kung naa pud sya dinhi. (It is called McArthur Room because he and General Douglas McArthur were bestfriends. If General McArthur arrived from America, he would stay here.)” said Mr. Roslin M. Carian, guard on duty, a native of Bago City, Negros Occidental who served here for 10 years already.\n\nThe Art Gallery is not really part of the old house. This is just added by CAP. The University of the Philippines Fine Arts students have displayed their paintings here. If the visitors like the painting and they want to buy, they will sell it. “Some of the memorabilia are just donated by people when they know that the house is opened and is made into a museum,” Mrs. Toledo informed us.\n\n“Kining balay, ma’am, gamiton man pud ni sa laing functions. Anhi sila magreception kung naay kasal, bunyag ug uban pa. naa man gu’y ubang mga guest nga gusto sila dinhi aron ang ilang mga guest nga Amerikano ug ang taga-layo makabisita ug makakita pud sa museum. Amo raman pud ning ipang-iswag diri dapit sa bintana ang mga butang kay aron dako ug lugar. Igkahuman ra pud nila, amo nasad ning ipamalik. (This house, ma’am, is used also for other functions. Others would hold their reception for the wedding, christening and etc. They chose it here because there are American guests and others from outside Cebu who want to see and visit the museum. We are just going to move these things here near the window to have ample space for the activity and we will just return them after the event.),” the guard added.\n\n“Do you know that the former President had his elevator here? It was perhaps the first of its kind in Cebu. It’s over there near the stairway. He used it during the time when he was in wheelchair. The two doors at your side are going to the balcony of the Auditorium and to the stock room. Most of the original furniture of the house are tied in nylon, the rest are just added by CAP,” Mrs. Toledo added.\n\nThe museum is open from Monday to Saturday. No entrance fee."
