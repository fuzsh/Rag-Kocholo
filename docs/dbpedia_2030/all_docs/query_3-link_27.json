        "text": "811B.00/9–1945: Telegram\n\nPresident Sergio Osmeña of the Philippines to the Secretary of the Interior (Ickes)\n\nIn reply to your telegram of September 11 I desire to state that information given you that I intend to release numerous persons against whom evidence was collected by the U.S. Army is erroneous. Persons kept in detention by Counter Intelligence Corps of U.S. Army and later delivered to the Commonwealth Government have been ordered detained by me even beyond the period of 6 hours permitted by the criminal laws of the Philippines. A few of them have been temporarily released on bail as determined by the Department of Justice pending presentation of charges against them and their trial before the courts. The Philippine Congress has enacted a law12 creating a special court to try all persons accused of collaboration with the enemy. The judges of this court will be persons who never served in any capacity under the puppet governments and the prosecutors are chiefly recruited from Army judge advocates and guerrilla leaders. Doubtless the prosecution of alleged collaborators will be diligently conducted and those found guilty will be promptly punished in accordance with law."
