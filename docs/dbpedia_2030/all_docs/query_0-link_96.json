        "text": "In the 1904 American World Fair – Louisiana Purchase Exposition in Saint Louis, Missouri — Martina de la Cruz (also known as “Jeanne” in the States) and her brother Juan (also known as “John”) was quoted by the Pittsburgh Gazette as “the most interesting anthropological types” among others in the Philippine display, published in March 1, 1904.They were also dubbed as “the smallest living adults alive in the world” at the time of the Exposition.\n\nBorn in a village in Panay, Capiz, The two were raised by their average size parents among three other siblings. They were smart and talented; spoke 3 local dialects such as Visayan, Tagalog, Kapampangan and two foreign languages such as Spanish and English. After the World Fair, the pair stayed in the U.S. and performed in a series of road show known as the Filipino Midgets.\n\nIn this photo, Martina was 36 years old and 32 inches in height, while Juan was 32 years old and 24 inches in height. Juan married Gregoria Gabriel -de la Cruz, a 21 year old lady and they had a very pretty baby girl, Maria. The baby was of normal size but unfortunately died at the age of three in the town of Daytona, Florida, March 15, 1907.\n\nIn June 3, 1932 in Washington D. C, the pair was appearing in a street carnival when a fire occurred. They were eventually saved in their tent by a German shepherd named “Kink/King”. Martina was 60 years old, 21 inches in height and weighs 34 pounds. Her brother, Juan was 58 years old, 24 inches in height and weighs 32 pounds.\n\nColored by: Bilog Bilugan\n\nLuneta, was earlier called Bagumbayan (new town) located 1.5 kilometer south of Manila. The word “Luneta” was derived from the word “Luna” since the area was a moon like shape before. The place was notorious for the public death penalty during the Spanish era of criminals and public enemies, one of which was the famous execution of Dr. Jose Rizal.\n\nAt present, Luneta park is highlighted by the famous Rizal monument which is guarded 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by ceremonial soldiers. More so, there are playgrounds, beautiful gardens, restaurants and open concert hall around the area.\n\nPhotograph from: University of Michigan Library Special Collections, 1900-1902\n\nColored by: Bilog Bilugan\n\nFrom 1904 to 1911, Dreamland was a famous and ambitious amusement park in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York City. Opened on May 15, 1904, this 15-acre lot was a park featured relatively high-class entertainment and dramatic spectacles based on morality themes, elegant architecture, pristine white towers, and some educational exhibits along with the rides and thrills.\n\nBy 1909, a group of Igorot tribe (among were women and children), garbed with only a few folds of vibrant-colored cloth, completed the park and featured as “human display”. The park was destroyed by fire in 1911.\n\nCollection by: George Grantham Bain\n\nColored by: Bilog Bilugan\n\nIn June 24, 1924, a group of Filipino representatives attended the Democratic National Convention held at the Madison Square Garden in New York City. The mission was headed by the Hon. Manuel L. Quezon, President of the Philippine Senate. Along with him was Hon. Isauro Babaldon, Philippine President Commissioner to the U.S.; Hon. Sergio Osmeña, member of the Philippine Senate; Hon. Claro M. Recto, Member and Minority Leader in the Philippine House of Representatives; Hon. Pedro Guevara, Philippine President Commissioner to the U.S.; Dean Jorge Bocobo, Technical Adviser to the Mission. ‪\n\nColored by: Bilog Bilugan\n\nThis fine lad was once called “Bright but lazy” during his schoolboy years, which was ironic since both of his parents were elementary teachers. Manuel L. Quezon however, had to work at various odd jobs when he resumed his study of law after the Philippine Revolution ended. In 1935, he became President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.‪\n\nPublisher: Bain News Service (between 1915 and 1920)\n\nColored by: Bilog Bilugan"
