        "text": "TODAY IN FILIPINO HISTORY: 15 November 1935 ‚Äî the Commonwealth of the Philippines was inaugurated with Manuel L. Quezon serving as its first President while Sergio Osme√±a served as his Vice President.\n\nThe Commonwealth of the Philippines was an administrative body that governed Filipinas from 15 November 1935 to 4 July 1946, as established by the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act, replacing the Insular Government of the Philippines Islands (which existed from 4 July 1901 up until the Commonwealth inauguration). The purpose of the Commonwealth was to transition the country to a fully fledged independent state. It followed a unitary presidential constitutional republic. It also marked the first time in Filipino History that a Filipino occupied Malaca√±ang Palace, the country‚Äôs seat of power which had been occupied by Spanish and US governors general for more than three centuries.\n\nThe Commonwealth had a brief interlude when the country was invaded by Japan on 8 December 1941. Quezon and Osme√±a were forced to establish a government in exile in Washington, D.C. (meanwhile, the Japanese established a puppet republic, with Jos√© P. Laurel as its president). When Quezon died on 1 August 1944, Osme√±a replaced him. The latter thus returned to the country as the new Commonwealth president right after the Japanese were driven away. He briefly served as the third and last President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 28 May 1946 to 4 July 1946, also effectively becoming the first President of the independent Third Philippine Republic after the United States ceded its sovereignty over our country.\n\nFollow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\nI have a few complaints on Quezon‚Äôs Game after having seen it last night with my wife (to celebrate her 43rd natal day):\n\n1) Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar was a bit off to be the setting for Manila. It was too wide open to the elements, too much sky to be seen, with even a mountain for a backdrop. Vigan, Ilocos Sur or Intramuros would have been more believable.\n\n2) There was too much English dialogue between Manuel Quezon and Sergio Osme√±a, and between Quezon and his wife Aurora. They spoke more in Spanish, of course.\n\n3) Emilio Aguinaldo never conversed in English with fellow Filipinos. In fact, he had a disdain for it.\n\n4) The rather contemptuous observation of a Jewish-run Hollywood is a recent one.\n\n5) I heard Quezon utter ‚Äúpu√±eta‚Äù only once.\n\nWhile it has no overall significance to our country‚Äôs general history, Quezon‚Äôs Game was still a good period film that offered viewers a glimpse on the behind-the-scenes political maneuverings of a US-sponsored Commonwealth of the Philippines, not to mention another least-known human side to Quezon. Raymond Bagatsing showed us another convincing performance, Audie Gemora was a spitting image of Osme√±a, and the white actors playing their white historical counterparts were all laudable in their thespian duties.\n\nAlso, Quezon‚Äôs Game was the second consecutive movie ‚Äúgame‚Äù that made my tears roll: the first was Avengers: Endgame. üòÇ"
