        "text": "UPDATE with OWN and TCM plans: Turner Classic Movies has scheduled a 24-hour film tribute to the late Debbie Reynolds for Friday, January 27, starting at 6 AM ET. Reynolds, who died Wednesday, one day after the death of daughter Carrie Fisher, became a sensation starring with Gene Kelly and Donald O’Connor in the MGM musical Singin’ In The Rain (1952) and received her only Oscar nomination for the title role in The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964). Those films will air at 6 PM ET and 8 PM ET, respectively, during the 12-title marathon.\n\nThe network previously scheduled a nationwide big-screen showing of Reynolds’ breakout role in Singin’ In The Rain on January 15 and January 18 as part of the TCM Big Screen Classics series, in partnership with Fathom events.\n\nOWN also said today that on January 5 at 10 PM it will re-air a 2011 The Oprah Winfrey Show episode that featured Reynolds and Fisher.

Produced and directed by World of Wonder’s Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, the special was nominated for two Primetime Emmys, including Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special.\n\nFisher was developing a sequel to Wishful Drinking at the time of her death, Geffen Playhouse confirmed this week.

That block will be followed by an episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race in which Reynolds served as a guest judge, after which Logo will show a Roseanne episode that featured Reynolds and was written by Fisher. Episodes of Golden Girls will follow at 1:30-2:30 AM Saturday, including one featuring Reynolds. Logo will re-air the Will & Grace block at 8 AM ET."
