        "text": "Debbie Reynolds (born April 1, 1932, El Paso, Texas, U.S.—died December 28, 2016, Los Angeles, California) was an American actress and singer whose vivacious personality and musical talents were showcased in such films as Singin’ in the Rain (1952) and The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964).\n\nReynolds’s working-class family moved from Texas to California in the late 1930s. She was spotted by a talent scout when she entered a beauty contest, and she embarked on an acting career while she was still a teenager. In 1948 she made her movie debut in June Bride. She played supporting parts in four musical comedies before her breakthrough role in 1952 as the ingenue who is made into a star in Singin’ in the Rain. Reynolds’s bright-eyed personality charmed movie audiences, who soon claimed her as “America’s Sweetheart.” She became a top box-office attraction during the 1950s, appearing in a series of light comedies that included Susan Slept Here (1954); The Tender Trap (1955), in which she costarred with Frank Sinatra; The Catered Affair (1956); Bundle of Joy (1956), in which she appeared with her husband, singer Eddie Fisher; Tammy and the Bachelor (1957); and The Mating Game (1959). Reynolds reached the height of her popularity in the late 1950s, during which time she was involved in a scandalous divorce from Fisher, who left her for actress Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nIn 1964 Reynolds earned critical acclaim for The Unsinkable Molly Brown, in which she starred in the title role; she earned an Academy Award nomination for her performance. Reynolds’s other movie credits included How the West Was Won (1962), Vincente Minnelli’s Goodbye Charlie (1964), The Singing Nun (1966), and Divorce American Style (1967), with Dick Van Dyke. In 1973 she provided the voice of the main character in the animated Charlotte’s Web. In addition to her film work, she also headlined the TV series The Debbie Reynolds Show (1969–70). On Broadway, she appeared in the musicals Irene (1973) and Woman of the Year (1983).\n\nLater in her career, Reynolds took on strong matriarchal roles, notably in Albert Brooks’s film Mother (1996); in episodes (1999–2006) of the TV series Will & Grace, as the latter title character’s flamboyant mother; and in the movie Behind the Candelabra (2013), as the mother of the entertainer Liberace. In 2001 she costarred with Shirley MacLaine, Joan Collins, and Elizabeth Taylor in the TV movie These Old Broads. Reynolds continued to perform as a singer in Las Vegas into the 21st century. She owned one of the largest private collections of Hollywood memorabilia, which was displayed in her Las Vegas hotel until the venture went bankrupt in 1997."
