Unfortunately, Will and an angry Grace end up temporarily estranged when he blurts out that he's gay and she orders him out of the house - and her life. Megan Mullally and Shelley Morrison also star. Part 1 of 2.\n\nWhose Mom Is It Anyway?\n\nGrace (Debra Messing), who is usually irritated by her well-meaning but meddling mother (guest star Debbie Reynolds), gets jealous when her mom starts to dote on Will (Eric McCormack).

Meanwhile, back home, a waiting Rosario (Shelley Morrison) bastes and tastes their juicy turkey. Helen Slater (\"City Slickers\"), Jon Tenney (\"Brooklyn South\"), Lainie Kazan (\"The Nanny\") and Kenneth Mars (\"The Producers\") also guest star as other bizarre family members. Part 1 of 2."
