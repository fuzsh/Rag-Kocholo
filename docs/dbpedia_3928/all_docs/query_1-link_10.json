        "text": "I started reading #Doglapan imagning a bollywood story of how ‚Äúnone of the people‚Äù working in the company you build, stood for you! Hard right? Itna bura kon kar sakta hai? Just to realize it was actually Ashneer Grover‚Äôs ego! #Ashneer writes - The idea seemed farfetched that Sharktank would propel a rather shy individual into becoming a ‚Äúnational youth icon‚Äù Sorry! I didn‚Äôt know Virat Kohli was on the show. Neither was Neeraj Chopra, PV Sindhu, Harmanpreet Kaur or Sunil Chettri! Another quote: The social media following jumped through the roof. This is exactly what #SharkTank did for me or what ‚ÄúI did for Shark Tank.‚Äù And I got confused again, whether I saw Shark Tank and found Ashneer sitting there or I went to Arshneer and saw Shark Tank sitting there?üòÖ Is the book entertaining? Definitely! The use of #Hindi gives ample gravity. There are many relatable Indian names Kotak Mahindra Bank, Deepinder Goyal etc. Which rarely happens because #bestsellers mostly sing a US success story! Ashneer narrated incidents without a slight of hesitation in taking names or mentioning personal incidents. Went to an extent where he narrated an incident in which his wife Madhuri Jain Grover fought which him and started taking of her jewellery in an aeroplane mid flight. This gave a very personal touch as mostly, when you are a businessman, the personal and professional lives do coincide. Not objectifying, or judging, but he continued to talk about her mentioning a feud, which broke down on shark tank sets. His wife got in touch with the producers to spend less on the vanity and services being provided to the judges and Aman Gupta got pissed. And I was amazed to see how the emotional side of Ashneer did not let him see that it was the same traits being highlighted when everybody in BharatPe was against his wife. A lesson or two taken about managing #relations with your business. Reading between the lines - the building blocks of Ashneer‚Äôs entire journey was the network of he built while working for American Express, #Grofers which is now Blinkit, PC Jeweller Ltd etc. Towards the end of the book, it feels like he‚Äôs using the book as a platform to crib against the company stakeholders who threw him out, and yes! Definitely he has got all his rights to use the popularity to get back at someone. But minute details like WhatsApp texts, meeting timings, and what he expected out of whome. Seems like a girlfriend or boyfriend cribbing after one point. It was very interesting to know via his work journey- about Indian banking system & biggest mergers and acquisitions of India being done by people from #IIT s and #IIM s! Yes! It‚Äôs a casual read which is entertaining and relatable, while I was expecting this to be at par with the biographies of international entrepreneurs! PS: Read Books! Doglapan gave me a feel as if I‚Äôve lived the journey of BharatPe. Living the journey of other companies does help to build your‚Äôs right?üòâ VsnapU in my case!\n\nThis lady rose from a violent marriage in Mumbai's slums to building a ‚Çπ2000Cr business empire. Meet Kalpana Saroj, a bright student, who was never given equal opportunity because of her caste. When she was 12, she was pushed into an unsuccessful marriage. She went on to do businesses like sewing, furniture, real estate, etc. before taking over a struggling metal engineering company in 2003. When she held the top position, the numbers looked bad: ‚Çπ4Cr in losses, 200 demoralized employees, and outdated machinery. üëâüèª She had no fancy MBA degree. Rather she re-built Kamani Tubes with her empathy. Here's how? ‚úÖ Redefining Leadership She connected with her workers, understood their struggles, and built trust. In a sector known for high attrition, she brought down this rate from 60% to 5%. Happy employees meant higher productivity & revenue. ‚úÖ Lean & Mean Operations: Kalpana slashed unnecessary costs, optimized inventory, & streamlined processes. By reducing wastage by 15% & increasing production by 20%, she squeezed profit from where others saw only red ink. ‚úÖ Innovation on a low budget: With limited resources, she focused on low-cost, high-impact innovations. She found alternatives to imported parts, saving the company lakhs on every project. This not only boosted profitability but also made them competitive in the international market. ‚úÖ Building Trust, Brick by Brick: She understood that business is not just numbers; it is about relationships. She fostered trust with clients by delivering on promises, exceeding expectations. This built a loyal clientele, leading to repeat business that accounted for 70% of their revenue. üëâüèª The results? ‚úÖ In just 5 years, Kalpana turned the loss company into a profit powerhouse. It's revenue soared to ‚Çπ120Cr with higher employee morale. ‚úÖ As of today, her wealth & assets are estimated to be around $112 million, or roughly ‚Çπ930Cr. ‚úÖ She runs seven business in total with a combined turnover of ‚Çπ2000Cr. ‚úÖ She received a Padma Shri for Trade & Industry in 2013 in recognition of her work with Kamani Tubes & others. What are your thoughts? Do you think she is the \"original slumdog millionaire\"? Let's grow together - #TheFinKid #entrepreneurs #inspiration #womeninbusiness"
