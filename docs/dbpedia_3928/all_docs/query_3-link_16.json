        "text": "‘Singin’ in the Rain’ (1952)\n\nMs. Reynolds was just 19 when she took on a star-making role opposite Gene Kelly and Donald O’Connor in this let’s-make-a-musical movie musical set in the late 1920s as silent films made way for talkies. Among the most memorable numbers is “Good Morning,” in which the three actors tapped their way through a kitchen, up and down stairs and — most elegantly — over two couches. Reflecting later on the making of the film, Ms. Reynolds said, “The two hardest things I ever did in my life are childbirth and ‘Singin’ in the Rain.’”\n\n‘The Tender Trap’ (1955)\n\nFrank Sinatra played a theatrical agent who falls for a young actress, played by Ms. Reynolds, in this romantic comedy directed by Charles Walters. (“Debbie Reynolds is all cuteness and spunk,” wrote Bosley Crowther in his review.) In a 2013 interview with NPR, Ms. Reynolds, who was married three times — including to the singer Eddie Fisher — said she received some relationship advice from Sinatra: “He said: ‘Now, I know you’re engaged to Eddie, but I don’t want you to marry a singer, because none of us are faithful, and he won’t be, and I’m not. We’re just awful,’ he said, ‘so don’t do it.’ And of course I didn’t mind him, and I had a lot of problems because I didn’t mind him, but Eddie and I were very young and very much in love at the time, but I guess he falls in and out of love.”"
