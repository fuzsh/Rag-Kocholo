        "text": "The film wasn’t supposed to screen until the spring, but HBO moved up the date after the subjects died just a day apart.\n\nHow do you not consider that context while watching “Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,” now scheduled to be shown on Saturday night?\n\nOf course, you can’t. But the 94-minute documentary, directed by Alex Bloom and Fisher Stevens, didn't need the heartbreaking loss of Reynolds and Fisher to be compelling.\n\nFisher, 60, suffered a massive coronary on a flight from London to Los Angeles on Dec. 23 and died four days later. Reynolds, 84, was rushed Dec. 28 to a hospital and died that day. The mother-daughter bond, so monumentally tested at various times during their 60 years together, was so strong that it made some kind of sense that their lives would end in the same week.\n\nAlthough “Bright Lights” was filmed in 2015, the movie sometimes has an eerie valedictory quality — about Reynolds and Fisher. Reynolds, at times, appears frail, even disoriented. At one point, she gamely shows up for an auction of part of her formidable collection of Hollywood memorabilia with half her face purple with bruises from a fall in the bathroom earlier that day.\n\nShe really was the title character she played in the film “The Unsinkable Molly Brown.”\n\nOne sequence proves especially telling: A smiling Reynolds is dressed in pink, seated in her home as Stevens and Bloom are about to film her. Suddenly, an alarm goes off in another part of the house. We see Stevens and others scrambling to find the source of the blaring sound and disable it. Reynolds remains perfectly poised and smiling, the calm center of a momentary domestic storm.\n\nAt first we think that she’s unaware of the sound. Then we realize that she’s completely aware but intends to keep calm and hold her pose. After all, that’s what she was trained to do as a young ingenue at MGM, where she began working in 1948 — training that served her well throughout life.\n\nThe film is surprisingly revealing, given that its subjects, in similar and individual ways, are playing for the audience.\n\nOne is an octogenarian with a fixed smile, twinkling eyes and the voice and name of a much younger woman who held her own at age 19, dancing and singing with Gene Kelly and Donald O’Connor in the film “Singin’ in the Rain.”\n\nThe other underwent a noticeable personality change at 13 and, only a few years later, wrestled with worldwide fame after she played Princess Leia in the first “Star Wars” film. Fisher battled drugs, alcoholism and mental illness all her life but found her way out of the thicket through treatment and therapy and by pulling few punches in her later drug- and alcohol-free life.\n\nSome of what she says seems rehearsed at first, as if she’s trying to convince us of something. But we soon realize that is her way of accepting who she is, someone who avoids filtering herself. Fisher says what she wants and what she feels. She readily acknowledges having two basic moods: The one she has named “Roy” is her happy state; “Pam” applies to her other pole, depression.\n\nFisher's performance differs from the kind of performance to which Reynolds defaulted — that of the perfect star, courtesy of MGM. Smile for the camera, even when your husband has dumped you for your best friend, Elizabeth Taylor; even when you’re besieged by the press everywhere you go; even when your next husband gambles away his money and yours.\n\n\"Performing is her life,” Fisher says. “It feeds her in a way family cannot. That’s why we’ve always been frustrating” to Reynolds.\n\nThat must have taken a toll on a young girl — feeling that her mother’s job came first. If so, the grown woman has made her peace with reality.\n\n“Everything in me demands that my mother be as she always was,” Fisher says as she weighs the reality of her mother’s increasing frailty. “Even if that’s irritating.”\n\nSeeing how close they are in the film, even while bantering from time to time, it’s hard to imagine how they survived for the decade or so that Fisher refused to have any contact with her mother. We can only guess at what drove Fisher to shut off her mother, but we readily see why reconciliation was inevitable.\n\n“Just do what your mother says,\" Reynolds deadpans. \"It’s easier.\"\n\nNeither woman ever opted for “easier.” That fact might have made their relationship challenging, but it also made it unbreakable — right up to its Hollywood ending."
