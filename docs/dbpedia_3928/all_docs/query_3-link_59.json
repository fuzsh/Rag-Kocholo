Her ebullient girlishness hit exactly the right note in the musicals and comedies which became her staple, and her popularity was so immediate that she was given starring roles while still a novice. Her early parts did not vary much, but her charm was so effortless that she could nudge a movie into the next higher notch of entertainment by the sheer force of enthusiasm. Her singing and dancing were no more than competent yet she was repeatedly cast in musicals, perhaps because her sprightly and buoyant character so readily lent itself to the musical's unreal milieu.\n\nHer gifts as a mimic, mined more thoroughly in the nightclub acts of her later career, are already in evidence in the delightful I Love Melvin, as is her inherent sense of comedy timing. She shows precocious skills as a farceur in such films as The Affairs of Dobie Gillis and Susan Slept Here, when the script requires only that she be adorable.\n\nHer zeal began to seem a bit forced in The Tender Trap, The Catered Affair, and A Bundle of Joy. A slurpy sentimentality crept into her vehicles, beginning with Tammy and the Bachelor. She could be theatrical and obvious in The Gazebo, How the West Was Won, and Mary, Mary. Still, her talents remain formidable. Witness her popular star turn as The Unsinkable Molly Brown, a role she played on screen and stage. And when she allows herself an offbeat role, as in the witty What's the Matter with Helen?, the results can be agreeably loopy.\n\nReynolds's career of late has not focused on feature filmmaking. Since the 1970s, she has led a crusade to restore and preserve the objects and real estate of Hollywood history, including buildings, costumes, posters, and props. She also has assembled an impressive collection of vintage movie memorabilia. These activities have made her one of the most respected citizens of Hollywood. Professionally, her career has been relegated almost exclusively to the stage and club dates, and to her appearances in two aerobic exercise videotapes. She also wrote an autobiography, Debbie: My Life.\n\nStill, her beauty and exuberance merely await the right screen role. Having acquitted herself so admirably with Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain when she was no more than 19, what might she be capable of now?\n\n—Frank Thompson, updated by Audrey E. Kupferberg"
