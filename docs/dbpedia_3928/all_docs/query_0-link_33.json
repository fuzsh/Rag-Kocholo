        "text": "As star of more than thirty motion pictures, two Broadway shows, two series, as well as dozens of television appearances, here and abroad, in 1991 Debbie Reynolds celebrates her forty-third year in show business. Born Mary Frances Reynolds on April Fool's Day, 1932 in El Paso , Texas , she moved with her parents and brother to Burbank , California when she was eight years old. An enthusiastic and highly energetic child, she excelled in sports, particularly sandlot baseball, Girl Scouts, baton twirling And in music where her specialty was the French horn. Her early comedic talents first came to light when she auditioned for dramatic roles in school plays and found everyone laughing at her serious' readings. Failing at that, she had to content herself with doing everything from the wind machine to the thunder and lightning offstage, but she never made it to an onstage appearance.\n\nAt age sixteen she entered a local beauty contest sponsored by Lockhead Aircraft. Never considered one of the beauties, she won on the strength of a lip-synching rendition of Betty Hutton singing  I'm A Square Peg In A Social Circle. Two of the judges that night were talent scouts from Warner Brothers and MGM. On the flip of a coin, the Warner Brothers scout, Solly Balano, got first dibs at a screen test for Mary Frances. The test led to a contract and the little girl's name was changed to Debbie.\n\nDebbie made her screen debut with June Haver and James Barton in The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady. Her first big break came in an MOM musical staffing Fred Astaire and Red Skeleton, Three Little Words, in which she portrayed Helen Kane, the Boop-hoop-a-doop girl of the late 1930's. A subsequent performance in a Busby Berkley musical Two Weeks With Love convinced the legendary L B Mayer to choose her for the leading female role in what became one of the greatest screen musicals of all time, Singin' In The Rain.\n\nOver a ten year period, Debbie made more than twenty-five films, including How The West Was Won, The Unsinkable Molly Brown (for which she was nominated for an Oscar), Susan Slept Here t ', The Tender Trap Tammy And the Bachelor', The Pleasure of his Company, Mary. Mary, Divorce American Style and Goodbye Charlie. Her recordings of Abba Dabba Honeymoon (from Two Weeks with Love) and Tammy both sold more than a million copies- In the mid-1960's Debbie put together her first nightclub act which debuted at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas. In the twenty-five years since, she has been a headliner on the casino circuit from Reno and Tahoe and Las Vegas to Atlantic City to the famed London Palladium, as well as in concert in every major American city, touring on the average of forty-two weeks a year.\n\nIn 1973, she took a break from her nightclub appearances to star in the Broadway revival of Irene, breaking all previous box office records for a Broadway musical. After an enormously successful national tour of the show, Debbie returned to the musical stage with another hit revival, Irving Berlin's Annie Get Your Gun, directed by the late Cower Champion (who also directed Irene). In 1983, she returned to Broadway again to star in the hit musical, Woman of the Year. In 1989, a National Tour of the Unsinkable Molly Brown.\n\nDebbie's off-screen, off-stage life has been as active and versatile. Mother of two children, actress/writer, Carrie Fisher and son Todd Fisher. In 1992, Carrie made her a grandmother, giving birth to a beautiful baby girl, Billie Catherine. She has been a life-long supporter and fund raiser for the Girl Scouts, and founder-president of the Thalians, a charitable organization which has raised millions for emotionally disturbed children.\n\nSince the late 1960's she has also been actively involved in a project closest to her heart, the collection and preservation of memorabilia from Hollywood's first half-century of film making, gathering thousands of costumes, props and mementos of Hollywood's studios and their greatest stars.\n\nHer dream to one day establish a Hollywood Motion picture and Television Museum is finally coming true. She has purchased a property in Las Vegas just off the Step, named The Debbie Reynolds \"Hotel and Casino, which will also house her collection, the largest individual collection of Hollywood Memorabilia.\n\nIn the late 1970's, anticipating her eventual retirement from performing, Debbie established The Debbie Reynolds Professional Rehearsal Studios in North Hollywood, which has since become one of the entertainment industry's leading rehearsal as well as professional, training studios In 1987, Debbie published her widely read memoir, Debbie, My Life, (co-written with David Patrick Columbia) with William Morrow & Company Publisher. Miss Reynolds has been married since 1985 to real estate developer Richard Hamlett.\n\nn 1987, Debbie published her widely read memoir, Debbie, My Life, (co-written with David Patrick Columbia) with William Morrow & Company Publisher.
