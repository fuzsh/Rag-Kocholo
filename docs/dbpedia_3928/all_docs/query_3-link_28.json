        "text": "Debbie finally broke out of her musical rut in 1955 when she was cast alongside Frank Sinatra, Celeste Holm and David Wayne in the straight comedy THE TENDER TRAP based on the play by Max Shulman and Robert Paul Smith. The best-written of any of Debbie's films since SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, THE TENDER TRAP gave her ample comic opportunities in her role as an eccentric theatre starlet determined not to let her career stand in the way of her marriage -- whenever it comes along. One of her most delightful films, THE TENDER TRAP charmed both critics and audiences and paved the way for other non-musical vehicles.\n\nDebbie's version of the title song from the film, \"Love is the Tender Trap,\" which became a hit record for Ella Fitzgerald (a .RM file).\n\nVideo Clips from THE TENDER TRAP (1955):\n\n\"An Invitation to Dinner\" with Frank Sinatra (a .AVI file courtesy MGM).\n\n\"The Finale\" with Frank Sinatra, Celeste Holm and David Wayne (a .AVI file courtesy MGM).\n\n(For help opening any of the multimedia files, visit the plug-ins page.)\n\nMore Memorable Quotations:\n\n\"And don't think it hasn't been fun, because it hasn't.\" --as Carol Pace in HIT THE DECK.\n\n\"I think I'd better sing. I talk too much.\" --as Julie Gillis in THE TENDER TRAP.\n\n\"A career is just fine, but it's no substitute for marriage.\" --as Julie Gillis in THE TENDER TRAP.\n\n\"Honestly, don't you think marriage is just the most important thing in the world? I mean, a woman isn't really a woman at all until she's been married and had children. And why? Because she's fulfilled.\" --as Julie Gillis in THE TENDER TRAP.\n\n\"Well after all, a person just can't go on adlibbing his way though life.\" --as Julie Gillis in THE TENDER TRAP.\n\n\"If you have a plan and you really believe in it, it'll work.\" --as Julie Gillis in THE TENDER TRAP.\n\n\"I love you just the way you are, almost.\" --as Julie Gillis in THE TENDER TRAP.\n\n\"After a while, if thing's aren't said, they aren't true any more.\" --as Jane Hurley in THE CATERED AFFAIR.\n\n\"Ralph, I think we better go to the movies.\" --as Jane Hurley in THE CATERED AFFAIR."
