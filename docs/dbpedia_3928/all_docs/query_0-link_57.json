        "text": "The Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto is honoring Debbie Reynolds — who died at age 84 on Dec. 28, just a day after her daughter, Carrie Fisher — with a double feature this weekend.\n\n“The Pleasure of His Company,” a 1961 comedy co-starring Fred Astaire, is paired with “The Catered Affair,” a family drama from 1956 that also stars Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine. I know, you may be asking where “Singin’ in the Rain” is, but both of these selections are gems in their own way. Astaire was pulled back from retirement when he made “The Pleasure of His Company” — giving Reynolds the rare opportunity of hoofin’ it with both Astaire and Gene Kelly in the span of a decade.\n\n“The Catered Affair” is a rare dramatic role for Reynolds, though not one she enjoyed at the time. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Reynolds said that director Richard Brooks hated her on the set and called her “Debbie Dimples” and “Little Miss Hollywood.” Davis plays her mother in the movie — with a story by Paddy Chayefsky and a screenplay by Gore Vidal — and took Reynolds under her wing during the production.\n\n“The Catered Affair” shows at 5:45 and 9:35 p.m. Friday through Sunday, with “The Pleasure of His Company” at 7:30 p.m. all three nights and 3:40 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. As a bonus, a 1955 newsreel short, “Wedding Bells for Debbie and Eddie,” on Reynolds’ marriage to Eddie Fisher, will be shown before the feature."
