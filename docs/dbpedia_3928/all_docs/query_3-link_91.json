        "text": "Fathom Events and Turner Classic Movies' ongoing partnership to bring monthly screenings of their TCM Big Screen Classics series to movie theatres nationwide continues January 15 and 18 with the 1952 Warner Bros. classic Singin’ in the Rain.\n\nDirected by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, Singin' in the Rain was co-written by Betty Comden and the late Adolph Green. The movie, which was nominated for two Academy Awards, starred Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, Millard Mitchell, Cyd Charisse, Douglas Fowley, and Rita Moreno. A Broadway musical based on the film opened at the George Gershwin Theatre July 2, 1985, and ran through May 18, 1986. Twyla Tharp directed and choreographed a cast headed by Don Correia. A Broadway revival of the song-and-dance musical, which was scheduled to arrive on Broadway this fall starring Derek Hough, was postponed.\n\n“Musician Don Lockwood (Kelly) rises to stardom during Hollywood's silent-movie era--paired with the beautiful, jealous and dumb Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen),” according to press notes. “When Lockwood becomes attracted to young studio singer Kathy Selden (Reynolds), Lamont has her fired. But with the introduction of talking pictures, audiences laugh when they hear Lockwood speak for the first time--and the studio uses Selden to dub her voice.”\n\nThe 2017 TCM Big Screen Classics series will also feature Some Like It Hot (1959) from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. (MGM); The Godfather (1972) from Paramount Pictures; The Graduate (1967) from Rialto Pictures; Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967) from Sony Pictures Entertainment; An Affair to Remember (1957), All About Eve (1950), and The Princess Bride (1987) from Twentieth Century Fox; Smokey and the Bandit (1977), Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), and E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) from Universal Pictures; North by Northwest (1959), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and Casablanca (1942) from Warner Bros.\n\nEach of these motion pictures will be digitally projected in its original aspect ratio at 2 PM and 7 PM local time each day (Sundays and Wednesdays). The films will also be accompanied by specially produced commentary from TCM host Ben Mankiewicz or Saturday-afternoon host Tiffany Vazquez, giving insight and behind-the-scenes tidbits.\n\n“TCM and Fathom are proud to announce some of the greatest feature films of all time in the 2017 TCM Big Screen Classics series. These 14 titles were released over five decades and include Best Picture winners, epic storytelling, astounding direction, legendary star-power and memorable soundtracks, all of which have captured the hearts of film lovers and defined moviemaking magic,\" said Fathom Events vice president of Studio Relations Tom Lucas in a previous statement.\n\n\"The TCM Big Screen Classics series presents a unique opportunity for movie lovers to experience some of the most beloved classics of all time, on the big screen and with a live audience, as they were originally intended to be shown,” added Genevieve McGillicuddy, vice president of partnerships and brand activation, Turner Classic Movies. “Expanding our long-term relationship with Fathom Events and our studio partners makes it possible for TCM to directly engage with a community of movie fans in a meaningful and memorable way, and share our love of classic film in local markets across the country.\"\n\nTickets for the 2017 TCM Big Screen Classics series can be purchased online by visiting FathomEvents.com, or at participating theatre box offices.\n\nDates of the screenings follow:\n\nSingin’ in the Rain 65th Anniversary (1952) – Sunday, January 15 and Wednesday, January 18\n\nAn Affair to Remember 60th Anniversary (1957) – Sunday, February 12 and Wednesday, February 15\n\nAll About Eve (1950) – Sunday, March 5 and Wednesday, March 8\n\nNorth By Northwest (1959) – Sunday, April 2 and Wednesday, April 5\n\nThe Graduate 50th Anniversary (1967) – Sunday, April 23 and Wednesday, April 26\n\nSmokey and the Bandit 40th Anniversary (1977) – Sunday, May 21 and Wednesday, May 24\n\nThe Godfather 45th Anniversary (1972) – Sunday, June 4 and Wednesday, June 7\n\nSome Like It Hot (1959) – Sunday, June 11 and Wednesday, June 14\n\nFast Times at Ridgemont High 35th Anniversary (1982) – Sunday, July 30 and Wednesday, August 2\n\nBonnie and Clyde 50th Anniversary (1967) – Sunday, August 13 and Wednesday, August 16\n\nE.T.
