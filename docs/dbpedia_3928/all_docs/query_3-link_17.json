        "text": "Name\n\nMary Frances Reynolds\n\nBirthplace\n\nEl Paso, Texas, U.S.\n\nBirth date\n\nApril 1, 1932\n\nDeath place\n\nLos Angeles, California, U.S.\n\nDeath date\n\nDecember 28, 2016\n\nOccupation\n\nActress, singer, dancer\n\nActive Years\n\n1948–present\n\nNotable Films\n\nDebbie Reynolds (born April 1, 1932 - December 28, 2016) is an American actress, notable for films such as The Affairs of Dobie Gillis, Susan Slept Here, The Catered Affair and Tammy and the Bachelor.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nMary Frances Reynolds was born on April 1, 1932, in El Paso, Texas, to Maxene N. \"Minnie\" Harman and Raymond Francis \"Ray\" Reynolds, a carpenter who worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad.[citation needed] She was of Scottish-Irish and English ancestry and was raised in a strict Nazarene church of her domineering mother. She had an older brother, William, who was two years her senior. Reynolds was a Girl Scout, once saying that she wanted to die as the world's oldest living Girl Scout. Reynolds was also a member of The International Order of Job's Daughters.\n\nHer mother took in laundry for income, while they lived in a shack on Magnolia Street in El Paso. \"We may have been poor,\" she said in a 1963 interview, \"but we always had something to eat, even if Dad had to go out in the desert and shoot jackrabbits.\"\n\nOne of the advantages of having been poor is that you learn to appreciate good fortune and the value of a dollar, and poverty holds no fear for you because you know you've gone through it and you can do it again... But we were always a happy family and a religious one. And I'm trying to inculcate in my children the same sense of values, the same tone that my mother gave to me.\n\nHer family moved to Burbank, California, in 1939. When Reynolds was a 16-year-old student at Burbank High School in 1948, she won the Miss Burbank beauty contest. Soon after, she was offered a contract with Warner Brothers and was given the stage name \"Debbie\" by studio head Jack L. Warner. One of her closest high school friends said that she rarely dated during her teenaged years in Burbank.\n\nThey never found her attractive in school. She was cute, but sort of tomboyish, and her family never had any money to speak of. She never dressed well or drove a car. And, I think, during all the years in school, she was invited to only one dance.\n\nReynolds agreed, saying, \"when I started, I didn't even know how to dress. I wore dungarees and a shirt. I had no money, no taste, and no training.\" Her friend adds:\n\nI say this in all sincerity. Debbie can serve as an inspiration to all young American womanhood. She came up the hard way, and she has a realistic sense of values based on faith, love, work, and money. Life has been kind to her because she has been kind to life. She's a young woman with a conscience, which is something rare in Hollywood actresses. She also has a refreshing sense of honesty.\n\nCareer[]\n\nFilm and television[]\n\nReynolds was discovered by talent scouts from Warner Bros. and MGM, who were at the 1948 Miss Burbank contest. Both companies wanted her to sign up with their studio, and had to flip a coin to see which one got her. Warner Bros. won the coin toss, and she was with the studio for two years. When Warner Bros. stopped producing musicals, she moved to MGM.\n\nWith MGM, Reynolds regularly appeared in movie musicals during the 1950s, and had several hit records during the period. Her song \"Aba Daba Honeymoon\" (featured in the film Two Weeks with Love (1950) and sung as a duet with co-star Carleton Carpenter) was the first soundtrack recording to become a top-of-the-chart gold record, reaching number three on the Billboard charts.\n\nHer performance in the film greatly impressed the studio, which then gave her a co-starring role in what became her highest-profile film, Singin' in the Rain (1952), a satire on movie-making in Hollywood during the transition from silent to sound pictures. It co-starred Gene Kelly, whom she called a \"great dancer and cinematic genius,\" adding, \"He made me a star. I was 18 and he taught me how to dance and how to work hard and be dedicated.\" In 1956, she appeared in the musical Bundle of Joy with her then-husband, Eddie Fisher.\n\nReynolds was one of 14 top-billed names in How the West Was Won (1962) but she was the only one who appeared throughout, the story largely following the life and times of her character Lilith Prescott. In the film, she sang three songs: What Was Your Name in the States?, as her pioneering family begin their westward journey; Raise a Ruckus Tonight, starting a party around a wagon train camp fire; and, three times, Home in the Meadow – to the tune of Greensleeves with lyrics by Sammy Cahn.\n\nHer starring role in The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964) led to a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Reynolds noted that she initially had issues with its director, Charles Walters. \"He didn't want me,\" she said. \"He wanted Shirley MacLaine,\" who at the time was unable to take the role. \"He said, 'You are totally wrong for the part.'\" But six weeks into production, he reversed his opinion. \"He came to me and said, 'I have to admit that I was wrong. You are playing the role really well. I'm pleased.'\" Reynolds also played in Goodbye Charlie, a 1964 comedy film about a callous womanizer who gets his just reward. It was adapted from George Axelrod's play Goodbye, Charlie and also starred Tony Curtis and Pat Boone.\n\nShe next portrayed Jeanine Deckers in The Singing Nun (1966). In what Reynolds once called the \"stupidest mistake of my entire career,\" she made headlines in 1970 after instigating a fight with the NBC television network over cigarette advertising on her weekly television show. Although she was television's highest-paid female performer at the time, she quit the show for breaking its contract:\n\nI was shocked to discover that the initial commercial aired during the premiere of my new series was devoted to a nationally advertised brand of cigarette (Pall Mall). I fully outlined my personal feelings concerning cigarette advertising ... that I will not be a party to such commercials, which I consider directly opposed to health and well-being.\n\nWhen NBC explained to Reynolds that banning cigarette commercials from her show would be impossible, she kept her resolve. The show drew mixed reviews, but according to NBC, it captured about 42% of the nation's viewing audience. She said later she was especially concerned about the commercials because of the number of children watching the show. She did quit doing the show after about a year, which she said had cost her about $2 million of lost income: \"Maybe I was a fool to quit the show, but at least I was an honest fool. I'm not a phony or pretender. With me, it wasn't a question of money, but integrity. I'm the one who has to live with myself.\" The dispute would have been rendered moot and in Reynolds' favor anyway had she not resigned; by 1971, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act (which had been passed into law before she left the show) would ban all radio and television advertising for tobacco products.\n\nReynolds played the title role in the Hanna-Barbera animated musical Charlotte's Web (1973), in which she originated the song \"Mother Earth and Father Time.\" Reynolds continued to make other appearances in film and television. She played Helen Chappel Hackett's mother, Deedee Chappel, on an episode of Wings titled, \"If It's Not One Thing, It's Your Mother,\" which originally aired on November 22, 1994.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2006, she played Grace Adler's theatrical mother, Bobbi Adler, on the NBC sitcom Will & Grace, which earned Reynolds her only Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2000. She played a recurring role in the Disney Channel Original Movie Halloweentown film series as Aggie Cromwell. Reynolds made a guest appearance as a presenter at the 69th Academy Awards in 1997.\n\nIn 2000, Reynolds took up a recurring voice role on the children's television program Rugrats, playing the grandmother of two of the characters. In 2001, she co-starred with Elizabeth Taylor, Shirley MacLaine, and Joan Collins in the comedy These Old Broads, a television movie written for her by her daughter, Carrie Fisher. She had a cameo role as herself in the 2004 film Connie and Carla. In 2013, she appeared in Behind the Candelabra, as the mother of Liberace.\n\nReynolds appears with her daughter in Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, a 2016 documentary about the very close relationship between the two. It premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. The television premiere was January 7, 2017, on HBO. According to USA Today, the film is \"an intimate portrait of Hollywood royalty ... [it] loosely chronicles their lives through interviews, photos, footage, and vintage home movies... It culminates in a moving scene, just as Reynolds is preparing to receive the 2015 Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, which Fisher presented to her mom.\"\n\nMusic career and cabaret[]\n\nHer recording of the song \"Tammy\" (1957; from Tammy and the Bachelor) earned her a gold record. It was a number one single on the Billboard pop charts in 1957. In the movie (the first of the Tammy film series), she co-starred with Leslie Nielsen.\n\nReynolds also scored two other top-25 Billboard hits with \"A Very Special Love\" (number 20 in January 1958) and \"Am I That Easy to Forget\" (number 25 in March 1960)—a pop-music version of a country-music hit made famous by Carl Belew (in 1959), Skeeter Davis (in 1960), and several years later by singer Engelbert Humperdinck.\n\nIn 1991, she released an album titled The Best of Debbie Reynolds.\n\nFor 10 years, she headlined for about three months a year in Las Vegas's Riviera Hotel. She enjoyed live shows, though that type of performing \"was extremely strenuous,\" she said in 1966:\n\nWith a performing schedule of two shows a night, seven nights a week, it's probably the toughest kind of show business, but in my opinion, the most rewarding. I like the feeling of being able to change stage bits and business when I want. You can't do that in motion pictures or TV.\n\nAs part of her nightclub act, Reynolds was noted for doing impressions of celebrities such as Eva and Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mae West, Barbra Streisand, Phyllis Diller, and Bette Davis. Her impersonation of Davis was inspired following their co-starring roles in the 1956 film, The Catered Affair. Reynolds had started doing stage impersonations as a teenager; her impersonation of Betty Hutton was performed as a singing number during the Miss Burbank contest in 1948.\n\nReynolds' last recording was a 1992 Christmas album with Donald O'Connor entitled Christmas with Donald and Debbie, arranged and conducted by Angelo DiPippo.\n\nReynolds was also a French horn player. Gene Kelly, reflecting on Reynolds's sudden fame, recalled, \"There were times when Debbie was more interested in playing the French horn somewhere in the San Fernando Valley or attending a Girl Scout meeting....She didn't realize she was a movie star all of a sudden.\"\n\nStage work[]\n\nWith limited film and television opportunities coming her way, Reynolds accepted an opportunity to make her Broadway debut. She starred in the 1973 revival of Irene, a musical first produced 60 years before. When asked why she waited so long to appear in a Broadway play, she explained:\n\nPrimarily because I had two children growing up, I could make movies and recordings and plays in nearby Las Vegas and handle a television series without being away from them. Now, they are well on the way to being adults. Also, there was the matter of being offered a show that I felt might be right for me ... I felt that Irene was it and now was the time.\n\nReynolds and her daughter Carrie both made their Broadway debuts in the play. Per reports, the production broke records for the highest weekly gross of any musical. For that production, she received a Tony nomination. Reynolds also starred in a self-titled Broadway revue, Debbie, in 1976. She toured with Harve Presnell in Annie Get Your Gun, then wrapped up the Broadway run of Woman of the Year in 1983, while Fisher was appearing in Agnes of God. In the late 1980s, Reynolds repeated her role as Molly Brown in the stage version of The Unsinkable Molly Brown, first opposite Presnell (repeating his original Broadway and movie role) and later with Ron Raines.\n\nBest Foot Forward (1953) (Dallas State Fair)\n\nIrene (1973) (Broadway and US national tour)\n\nDebbie (1976) (Broadway)\n\nAnnie Get Your Gun (1977) (San Francisco and Los Angeles)\n\nWoman of the Year (1982) (Broadway) (replacement for Lauren Bacall)\n\nThe Unsinkable Molly Brown (1989) (US national tour)\n\nIrene (2008) Perth Western Australia\n\nIn 2010, she appeared in her own West End show Debbie Reynolds: Alive and Fabulous.\n\nFilm history preservation[]\n\nReynolds amassed a large collection of movie memorabilia, beginning with items from the landmark 1970 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer auction, and she displayed them, first in a museum at her Las Vegas hotel and casino during the 1990s and later in a museum close to the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\nThe museum was to relocate to be the centerpiece of the Belle Island Village tourist attraction in the resort city of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, but the developer went bankrupt. The museum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009. The most valuable asset of the museum was Reynolds' collection. Todd Fisher, Reynolds' son, announced that his mother was \"heartbroken\" to have to auction off the collection. It was valued at $10.79 million in the bankruptcy filing. Los Angeles auction firm Profiles in History was given the responsibility of conducting a series of auctions. Among the \"more than 3500 costumes, 20,000 photographs, and thousands of movie posters, costume sketches, and props\" included in the sales were Charlie Chaplin's bowler hat and Marilyn Monroe's white \"subway dress,\" whose skirt is lifted up by the breeze from a passing subway train in the film The Seven Year Itch (1955). The dress sold for $4.6 million in 2011; the final auction was held in May 2014.\n\nBusiness ventures[]\n\nIn 1979, Reynolds opened her own dance studio in North Hollywood. In 1983, she released an exercise video, Do It Debbie's Way! She purchased the Clarion Hotel and Casino, a hotel and casino in Las Vegas, in 1992. She renamed it the Debbie Reynolds Hollywood Hotel but it was not a success and Reynolds was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1997. In June 2010, she replaced Ivana Trump on the Globe weekly's advice column but many of the published letters were plagiarized from Slate's Dear Prudence and possibly others.\n\nAdvocacy[]\n\nReynolds was a longtime ally of the LGBT community and an early advocate for AIDS. In 1983, Reynolds performed at an AIDS fundraiser with her friend Shirley MacLaine. In a 2014 interview with The Daily Telegraph, Reynolds revealed that she had helped several closeted actors conceal their homosexuality by dating them. When asked when she realised she was a gay icon, Reynolds replied, \"Over the years many of the boys that have worked for me as dancers have been gay. The creative people were all gay people, from producers to writers. To me, they were just family.\"\n\nFilmography[]\n\nAdd here\n\n[]"
