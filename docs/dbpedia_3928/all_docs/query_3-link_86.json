        "text": "In her day, Debbie Reynolds did it all. Subsequently, her day lasted for decades.\n\nThe actress, who became a national treasure as the star of one of the most beloved movies of all time and went on to enjoy a nearly 70-year career in film, television and theater, has died. She was 84. In confirming her death, son Todd Fisher told E! News, \"She went to be with Carrie. In fact, those were the last words she spoke this morning.\"\n\nReynolds was hospitalized Wednesday afternoon after suffering a stroke at a Beverly Hills home, barely a day after daughter Carrie Fisher died at the age of 60 following a heart attack.\n\n\"I'm heartbroken that I'm unable to be there in person to receive this extraordinary honor you have given me. So you could see how unbelievably happy you have made me,\" Reynolds, who was recovering from surgery at the time, said in sending her regrets. \"If joy could be weighed, this would be the most sizable rejoicing one could feel, especially if that one is me.\"\n\nFisher had presented Reynolds with the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award months beforehand at the 2015 SAG Awards, daughter and mother trading light-hearted jabs at each other in a nod to their tight-knit yet famously rocky relationship.\n\nAs an acknowledgment in her 2016 memoir The Princess Diarist, Fisher had written: \"For my mother—for being too stubborn and thoughtful to die. I love you, but that whole emergency, almost dying thing, wasn't funny. Don't even THINK about doing it again in any form.\"\n\nAnd the spotlight had been on Reynolds all those years for good reason. She was perhaps best known for singing and dancing her way into Gene Kelly's (and America's) heart as the spunky and sweet-voiced Kathy Selden in 1952's Singin' in the Rain, one of the most famous movie musicals of all time and No. 5 on American Film Institute's list of the best films ever made.\n\n\"It's generational,\" Reynolds discussed the movie in an interview with AFI. \"I think it really relates to young people. They like it because it has life and the story is so simple. It's boy-meets-girl, but it's movie star meets beginner. Actually, the character was a lot like me, Debbie. At the time I was 17, this was a young girl who was wanting to be a dancer, wanting to be in show business.\"\n\nBorn Mary Frances Reynolds in El Paso, Texas, Reynold's family moved to California when she was 7, and the petite star was discovered at 16 when she won the Miss Burbank pageant in 1948. That led to a studio contract, she changed her name to Debbie and she scored her first credited role on the big screen in 1950's The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady. Singin' in the Rain two years later was her first movie in which she played the leading lady (aka the object of the leading man's affection, as it often was in those days).\n\nWhile shooting the film with Kelly, she was being helped with her fancy footwork by the era's other dancing superstar, Fred Astaire, who was working on the soundstage next door.\n\n\"I was just lucky that they put me in that part that suited me,\" Reynolds recalled. \"In other words I didn't have to be a well-trained actress, which I certainly…when I was 17, I was brand new in the movies, so I certainly had no training. But if the part is you, and you're not afraid—and I wasn't afraid—you know, I was so dumb that I didn't feel you could fail. I felt it was me and I really just marched straight ahead and I wasn't frightened of the huge task. I had never danced!\"\n\nYou could watch her perfectly polished scenes with Kelly and Donald O'Connor a million times and never think for one second that Reynolds hadn't been dancing all her life. She was certainly known as a triple threat ever after.\n\n\"Although I didn't want to find out the truth, I had to face up to it. Even so, it was a great shock to find them together. It left me shattered.\"\n\nMoreover, \"I was a virgin when I married Eddie, but Elizabeth had been married three times…I was very religious so I didn't believe in divorce, but they laid guilt on me that I was keeping them and true love apart. So, I finally let Eddie off the hook. I told him to go.\"\n\nTaylor would soon divorce Fisher when she met Richard Burton on the set of Cleopatra, and she and Reynolds rekindled their friendship not long afterward.\n\n\"I loved to party with the Rat Pack, they were so much fun,\" she told the U.K.'s Telegraph in 2010 while on a 15-stop concert tour of England at the age of 77. \"All they did was have a good time. We'd get off work at two in the morning and hang out at a club and listen to other performers. I loved Frank Sinatra. If he liked you it was forever, and if he disliked you—I wouldn't want to be there.\"\n\nShe recalled Sinatra telling her not to marry a singer, as she was engaged to Fisher at the time. \"But Eddie was a darling boy and at the time I loved him very much,\" Reynolds said. \"Of course Frank was right.\"\n\n\"There's very few women from her generation who worked like that, who just kept a career going all her life, and raised children, and had horrible relationships, and lost all her money, and got it back again.\"\n\nThe documentary Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May and is slated to air on HBO in March 2017.\n\nIn 1997, Reynolds was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nAnd without a doubt, the actress who was such a famous mother in real life had found her niche playing Mom onscreen.\n\nReynolds stood out as Kevin Kline's startled yet understanding mother in the hit big-screen comedy In & Out, and she earned an Emmy nomination in 2000 for best guest actress in a comedy series for her turn as Debra Messing's scene-chewing mom in Will & Grace, a recurring character on the hit NBC series.\n\nUnrecognizable behind a prosthetic nose, Reynolds also gave a standout performance as Liberace's elderly mother in the 2013 HBO biopic Behind the Candelabra, starring Michael Douglas as the renowned entertainer. A regular in Vegas as well, Reynolds knew both Liberace, who died in 1987, and his mother, Frances.\n\nAlso in 2013, Reynolds released her memoir Unsinkable, the title a nod to one of her most famous roles. In the book, which picked up on her life in the late 1980s, she revealed that she had asked director Mike Nichols if she could audition for the MacLaine role in Postcards. Nichols said she wasn't right for the part, to which she replied, \"'Excuse me? I'm not right to play myself, a part I'd been creating—admittedly unwittingly—for my daughter for a decade?!'\"\n\nIn November 2014, 54 years after making her performance debut in Las Vegas at the Riviera Hotel, Reynolds bid Sin City farewell with a weekend engagement at the South Point Casino. Daughter Carrie, son Todd and granddaughter Billie joined her on stage and Reynolds closed the vaudeville-inspired show singing \"Tammy,\" a No. 1 hit for her in 1957.\n\nAsked in January 2015 if she planned on slowing down for good after having \"no vacation ever in 66 years,\" she assured it was just a \"hiatus.\"\n\n\"I'll never retire,\" Reynolds told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I'll always perform. It's the ham in me—I love to sing and dance. I watch Turner Classic Movies every night—what would I do without TCM?\"\n\nAnd what would TCM have done without stars such as Debbie Reynolds, the likes of whom belong to a forever-golden age.\n\n—With reporting by Alli Rosenbloom"
