        "text": "Description: A set of 8 Lobby Cards for the 1959 movie \"It Started With A Kiss\". The movie which starred Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds is about an Air Force Sgt. Joe Fitzpatrick who meets and marries a beautiful model, Maggie Putnam, on the eve of being shipped off to Spain. When the new Mrs. Fitzpatrick waits to join her husband, she promises him in a letter \"the most wonderful surprise that could happen to two people.\" Joe naturally assumes that she's pregnant, but the surprise turns out to be a fabulous new car that he won in a raffle. His new bride and car win him the scorn and jealousy of Spain's most famous toreador, not to mention the suspicions of his commanding officer. The cards are of nice and heavy cardstock, fully colored and in good shape given their age and the fact that they were in some theater's lobby. Please view the photos as they are part and parcel of the description.\n\nDate: 1959.\n\nOrigin: USA.\n\nSize: All cards measure 14\" by 11\".\n\nMaker: Loew's Incorporated.\n\nMarks: Copyright (c) 1959 Loew's Incorporated.\n\nDistinguishing Characteristics - Most Interesting About The Piece: A nice set of lobby cards.\n\nCondition: The cards are in good condition. They all have some minor tears to the edges, soiling, foxing, pin holes where they were affixed to a board in the lobby and rust marks from paper clips that were used to keep them together. All of these issues can be seen in the photos. Again, please see photos to appreciate the beauty and condition of these lobby cards."
