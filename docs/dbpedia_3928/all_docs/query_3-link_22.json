        "text": "By the early 1960s, good roles for an aging ing√©nue were becoming scarce and Debbie struggled to find material suited to her talents.\n\nIn Paramount's MY SIX LOVES (1963) she plays a successful stage actress on the verge of collapse who goes to Connecticut to rest and ends up adopting six orphans and romancing the local minister. Directed by Debbie's former MGM contemporary Gower Champion, the comedy was criticized for its cloying cheerfulness and marked the beginning of a distinct decline in Debbie's film career.\n\nHer next film, Warner Bros.'s film adaptation of Jean Kerr's hit Broadway comedy MARY, MARY (1963), about a recently divorced couple who attempt to break up each other's new romances, provided better source material, but Debbie's performance in the film was preceded by the reputation of the play's star, Barbara Bel Geddes, and reviewers did not compare the two performances in Debbie's favor.\n\nStill More Memorable Quotations:\n\n\"Well, if giving your bathroom shower curtains to the Hungarian Relief isn't kookie, I'd like to know what is.\" --as Nell Nash in THE GAZEBO.\n\n\"I wish this had happened in Los Angeles... They're always finding bodies out there. They don't think anything of it.\" --as Nell Nash in THE GAZEBO.\n\n\"Tell me something. What does it take to convince you you're not wanted? A gun?\" --as Maggie Putnam in IT STARTED WITH A KISS.\n\n\"Well, we finally agree on something. Falling in love is no reason to get married.\" --as Maggie Putnam in IT STARTED WITH A KISS.\n\n\"It ain't the money I love, Pa. It's the not havin' any I hate.\" --as Molly Brown in THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN.\n\n\"You're no prize. Where I come from we drown runts of the litter like you.\" --as Molly Brown in THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN.\n\n\"I can sing the hogs out of the hills.\" --as Molly Brown in THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN.\n\n\"Nobody's gonna stop me. Nothin's gonna get me down.\" --as Molly Brown in THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN.\n\n\"Well, dip me and fry me!\" --as Molly Brown in THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN.\n\n\"I'm interested in ev'rthin', 'cause I don't know nothin'.\" --as Molly Brown in THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN.\n\n\"Well, drop my drawers! It's Gladys McGraw.\" --as Molly Brown in THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN.\n\n\"I always said she was nuts.\" --in THE BODYGUARD (1992).\n\n\"Movie Talk: Debbie Reynolds talks of her career.\" (a .MP3 file)."
