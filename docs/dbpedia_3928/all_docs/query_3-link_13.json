        "text": "“Three Little Words” (1950)\n\nFresh out of high school, Debbie Reynolds was given a small role in this Fred Astaire, Red Skelton and Carleton Carpenter MGM musical, sang an old standard (“I Wanna Be Loved By You”) and shot to fame.\n\n</div> <div class=\"yad-dsk-box-ad-f wp-block-the-wrap-ad--inline wp-block-the-wrap-ad\"></div> <p> </p><p> </p><p><p>Reynolds reunited with Carleton Carpenter to sing the 1914 song &#8220;Aba Daba Honeymoon.&#8221; The song became such a hit that MGM sent the duo touring the country to promote it and the film.</p> <div class=\"yad-mob-box-ad-c wp-block-the-wrap-ad--inline wp-block-the-wrap-ad\"></div> </div><div class=\"wp-block-the-wrap-video-list-item\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYoEK051qaE?list=PLyTahCqBLvcKTFMK5Dgxzg2zBtc_ntw1y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>\n\n“Singin’ in the Rain” (1952)\n\nThe movie that made Reynolds a star and is still considered one of the greatest films of all times had her doing the Charleston to “All I Do is Dream of You.”\n\n“Singin’ in the Rain” (1952)\n\nDancing and singing “Good Morning” beside two of the best in the biz (Donald O’Connor and Gene Kelly) left an exhausted and aching Reynolds crying through the endless rehearsals… but the result is cinematic perfection.\n\n“Singin’ in the Rain” (1952)\n\nOnly a small portion of this “You Are My Lucky Star” number is seen at the end of the film, where the cut that made it to the screen featured her and Gene Kelly together in a kiss.\n\n“Skirts Ahoy!” (1952)\n\nSong and dance man Bobby Van joined Reynolds in the colorful number “Oh By Jingo.”\n\n“Give a Girl a Break” (1953)\n\nReynolds and mega-talent Bob Fosse danced their way to romance to this little known Ira Gershwin song “In Our United State.”\n\n“Hit the Deck” (1955)\n\nDuring MGM’s Golden Age of Musicals, you couldn’t go wrong with a pretty girl singing amongst a shipload of sailors, which is exactly what Reynolds did to the tune of “Loo Loo.”\n\n“Bundle of Joy” (1956)\n\nReal life hubby at the time, Eddie Fisher joined Reynolds in the ballad “Lullaby in Blue.” Reynolds was expecting their own bundle of joy at the time, daughter Carrie.\n\n“Tammy and the Bachelor” (1957)\n\nReynolds’ recording of the song “Tammy” became a gold record and the best-selling single by a female vocalist of the year.\n\n“The Unsinkable Molly Brown” (1964)\n\nThe Meredith Wilson song “I Ain’t Down Yet” has become an anthem for those who will not give up — or, as the film title says, are “unsinkable.”\n\n“The Unsinkable Molly Brown” (1964)\n\nReynolds proves to have an endless amount of energy in the spirited song “Belly Up To the Bar Boys.”"
