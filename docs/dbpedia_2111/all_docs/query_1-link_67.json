        "text": "Agrippa, the Roman admiral who granted to Octavian the triumph over Antonius and a quick rise to power, also deserved to be numbered among the ancient Vergilian critics. Though certainly an ardent admirer of the poet, he did not entirely approve of the manner in which Virgil sometimes strove to make the reader appreciate the novelty of his poetry: on these occasions, according to Agrippa, Augustus' friend was reproachable for his being a ‘faulty imitator’ (kakozelos), his desire of emulating his predecessors causing him to sacrifice the correctness and neatness of style to an unusual and odd kind of versification. In the fact, the words Agrippa resorts to in reprehending this poetical failure are not altogether clear in themselves, nor does the accompanying explanation provide any conclusive evidence allowing the modern critic to ascertain their exact meaning. The Author of the present paper does not pretend to settle so thorny a question but takes this instead as the starting point for a reassessment of the nature of Virgil’s language and the poet's debt to the Greek and Latin authors who had already distinguished themselves in enhancing through words and imitation the charm of ancient poetry.\n\nThe papyrus text of Sophocles’ Ichneutai preserves numerous interventions by a second copyist, whether punctuation marks, accents etc. The article focuses on his notes on the text (usually in the right margin). Usually these notes record variant readings by ancient scholars (or even by the copyist himself). Most variants are attributed to Theon and some to other grammarians, whose names are written with abbreviations. As a result these abbreviated names have often been misinterpreted by modern editors of the play. This article restores the correct decipherment of these names, contributes to our knowledge for the manuscript tradition of the play and correlates it to the tradition of other mss, which preserve similar abbreviations. Apart from Theon, it seems that the text of the Ichneutai had also been studied by Nicanor, Aristonicus and Aristophanes.\n\nThe article aims to restore the train of thought in Petr. Sat. 118. 3-5. In 118. 3, the manuscript reading sanitatem (instead of the emendation vanitatem) is to be retained and taken not as hinting at the lack of poetic ecstasy, but as 'stylistic simplicity' after Pavlova 2017. The adversative ceterum does not imply that poetry is the polar opposite of rhetoric, but stresses that contrary to the expectations of poeticizing orators, true poetry is hard toil. The first neque-clause does not imply contrast with rhetoric, but calls for a copious style (in particular, copious sententiae). The second neque-clause implies that poetry must absorb an immense literary tradition in order to attain a copious language. Thus, the two coordinate neque-clauses in 118. 3 are paired as requiring copiousness (a) in style and (b) in language. In the next two sentences, (a) and (b) are specified in chiastic order: (b) the borrowed diction must be elevated (118. 4); (a) the sententiae (as the primary stylistic ornament) must be integrated into the texture of the poem (118. 5). The idea that absorbing literary tradition must enrich poetic language may be paralleled in Hor. Epist. 2. 2. 115-118. Sententiae are regarded as an essential constituent of poetic style, despite the ironic remark on sententiolae vibrantes in 118. 2."
