        "text": "What happened to the music that defined us?\n\nRock music reigned supreme in the 2000s, but it has since vanished. Where did it go? The 2000s were a fantastic time for rock music. Many of the most popular bands in the world were playing arenas and stadiums across the globe, and their songs were constantly on the radio.\n\nThe rise of rock music in 2023 is predicted to bring back the sound of rock music that was popular in the 1980’s. This will include genres like punk, indie, grunge and hard rock. I’ve heard some since the turn of 2023 but where’s the rest? Is no one listening to it?\n\nAre the fans jumping ship and dabbling in other genres?\n\nWatching old favourites like Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd bounce around the Billboard Rock charts while ‘Until I Found You by Stephen Sanchez’ peeks at no1 after 52 weeks on the chart, ‘Until I Found You by Stephen Sanchez’ is confusing.\n\nThe Top 5 of the Rock /Alternative Billboard Chart as of March 23, 2023\n\nFurther adding to my head spin are tracks in the Top 5 of the Rock /Alternative Billboard Chart as of March 23, 2023. Where’s the Rock we know, love and trust? If this is rock today, then no wonder young music fans are listening to rock music.\n\n‘Until I Found You by Stephen Sanchez’?\n\nModern Day Outlaw- Eulogy\n\nSomething In The Orange by Zach Bryan?\n\nBad Habit by Steve Lacy?\n\nSunroof Nicky Youre & dazy?\n\nCeilings by Lizzy McAlpine?\n\nWhat does this mean? Where is the rock music we need to hear?\n\nThe statement pieces that drive hard and make us remember what it was a like to be in a stadium with those rock gods we idolized. We need new idols. We need to be inspired. We need the music to make us feel alive, and not just for the moment but every time we turn on the radio. We need those classic rock anthems that will be sung long after our generation is gone.\n\nI see post from other rock music fans asking the same thing….\n\nIs Rock Music Dead?\n\nAm I the only one who thinks like that?\n\nWhen thinking about all the weird music I listened back in ’00s there is not a moment when my memory won’t remind me of rock music (to some — metal, but I prefer say it’s rock). Some of the bands — Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Evanescence, System of a Down, Slipknot.\n\nI was young and that was music. I believe to older generation Kiss, Scorpions and AC/DC were of the same caliber.\n\nMy question is relating to today. I don’t hear that kind of music. Is it gone or is it somehow meshed to another music style? And why youngsters don’t listen to rock the way we did? What is your opinion on that?\n\nWith that said, I decided to write this post so I could make a list of new rock songs that we need to hear. If you are a rock music fan, help me support these amazing bands and their music.\n\nSpotify Playlist (Rock Vibes Rising)\n\nHere’s what’s on the horizon for rock music in 2023.\n\nWith the popularity of the internet in the early 2000s, we saw an explosion of DIY rock bands that took advantage of the new medium and sold direct to consumers. The Arctic Monkeys were riding high and hundreds of bands started popping in the undergound scene.\n\nEventually, these tech tools were absorbed by huge corporations and thus the limiting of rock started again with very little airplay and opportunities to be heard.\n\nI feel that we need an independent rock revolution\n\nWe need more bands that write and perform their own music, not just cover it. We need to be inspired by the new wave of rockers who are making a difference in the world with their music and skills. I want rock music to be what it was when I was young: raw, passionate, rebellious and loud. I want to be inspired by the guitars and moved by dynamic drums. I need lyrics that are not only powerful but memorable and speak for me.\n\nLet’s create that..\n\nSubmit your music (here)\n\nNew Rock Music of 2023 you need to hear…\n\nModern Day Outlaw- Eulogy\n\n‘Eulogy’ by Modern Day Outlaw takes the very close to home topic of suicide and the everyday struggles that we all face. When you do your best, but sometimes its still not enough. No one is immune to disappointment and hardship, when you are at the end of your rope and are looking for answers, where can you draw strength to move on.\n\nWellBad — Bad Habits\n\nReleased by: Blue Central Records\n\nGenre: Alternative Rock\n\nSimilar artists: The Black Keys, Paul Cauthen, Tom Waits, Cage the Elephant\n\n“This album saved my life and nearly destroyed it at the same time,” singer/songwriter Daniel Welbat says about his fifth studio album. Like many other artists, the pandemic and its lockdowns brought the Hamburg native to his knees, mentally speaking. Isolated from the rest of the world, Welbat took an unfiltered look at what is commonly referred to as “bad habits.”\n\nInner Circle Club — Doomed\n\nReleased by: Pariah Record Company\n\nGenre: Psychedelic Rock, Indie Rock, Garage Rock\n\nSimilar artists: Ty Segall, Jack White, Cage The Elephant, Father John Misty, The Last Shadow Puppets, The Arcs\n\nBrand new indie rock duo, our debut album released on March 17th 2023. Doomed is a fierce, energetic exploration of a doomed relationship backed by fuzzy guitars and a booming drum groove. The indie track combines elements of edgy garage rock, anchored by a bass line that would make Iggy Pop dance.\n\nVOTCHI — Out of Love\n\nMusic Genre: Rock\n\nVibe: Epic rock themes\n\nLocated in: Prague, CZ\n\nSounds like: Ghost, Alter Bridge, Avenged Sevenfold, SOAD, Mammoth WVH\n\nVotchi, hard rock band, started late 1999. The current line-up is Alex McBeat on vocals, Martin Smejkal on guitar, Dominik Vozobule on bass guitar, Mirek Mužík on keyboards, Honza Ježek on drums and Olga Vlachová on flute. In 2023, the band released new single “Out of Love” from the forthcoming EP, that will be released late 2023/2024.\n\nLYLVC’s New Ep “Perfect Drug” is Modern Rock meets Electronica\n\nLYLVC (pronounced “Lilac”) is a modern rock band that incorporates a male rapper and a female singer. I love that there is a female lead on this and she is a fabulous vocalist. All the musicians are very talented here. The band is heavily influenced by Linkin Park and Bring Me the Horizon. LYLVC combines elements of rock music, hip hop and electronica with a dual-vocalist dynamic. LYLVC released their new EP “Perfect Drug” January 20, 2023.\n\nMich Again — You’re Fire\n\nGenre: Indie Rock, Dream Pop\n\nMoods: Energetic, Epic\n\nSimilar artists: Imagine Dragons, Florence + The Machine, Kaleo, Tom Walker\n\n“Seriously good sounding music here. Your vocal with the effect is perfect and inspired. I love the warmth and energy in this song as it offers movement and a spacial feeling of floating through the instrumental.”\n\nMich Again (Michiel Tromp 17/07/1992), is an independent singer and musician born in the Netherlands, living in Barcelona.\n\n‘Caution Tape’ by Jake Kulak & The Modern Vandals is rock people can relate to\n\nMusic Genre: Indie Pop/ Indie Rock\n\nVibe: upbeat, energetic\n\nLocated in: Hartford County, CT\n\nSounds like: Pheonix, The Killers, The Strokes, Two Door Cinema Club\n\n‘Caution Tape’ by Jake Kulak & The Modern Vandals wastes no time opening with an energetic gritty guitar setting the pace of what’s ahead. The infectious melody grabs your attention from the first verse and continues to build as the story is told. Jake Kulak’s vocals are smooth and soulful as he sings about personal conflict that most of us went through in high school and college.\n\nLittle dove — Had Enough\n\nGenre: Psychedelic Rock, Indie Rock, Alternative Rock\n\nSimilar artists: Aretha Frank, The Black Keys, Jack White, Jethro Tull, Janis Joplin\n\nPowerful vocals really stood forward on this single. This singer is Janis Joplin brought back from the grave but with the chops of Heart rolled in to carry the torch.\n\nThe Shameless Band’s ‘It’s Alright’ is music that Brings people together\n\nMusic Genre: Rock Country Americana\n\nVibe: Easy listening\n\nLocated in: California\n\nWhen the World Falls Apart, Music brings people Together- Don’t you agree? When it comes to storytelling, I am really enjoying The Shameless Band with their newest release “It’s Alright” from their ‘’Less Is More’’ EP written during Covid Lockdown.\n\nThe Train Rockers — Munich\n\nMusic Genre: Alternative Rock / Indie Rock / Poprock\n\nVibe: Magical ;) / powerful / moody / epic / melancholic\n\nLocated in: Munich / Germany\n\nSounds like: The Strokes / Kings Of Leon / The Pixies / U2 / Arctic Monkeys\n\nOur song “Munich” tries to capture the magic of this place, ugly at first glance but beautiful in its imperfection. And the rare moments of love between “fellow humans” who come here to forget their hatred, their loss, and to numb their pain. These encounters inspired us to write our own songs. And right there in the streets of Munich, our musical and cultural differences were melting together, trying to bring a little tune, a little light, a little love, maybe a little faith to the ugly part of our town.\n\nModern Alibi — Seventies\n\nGenre: Indie Rock, Indie Pop, Alternative Rock\n\nSimilar artists: Arctic Monkeys; The Strokes; The Killers; Neon Trees\n\nModern Alibi is an alternative rock band from Charlotte, NC, founded by Holden Scott, an up-and-coming musician/songwriter. In Modern Alibi’s debut single, “Seventies”, the protagonist metaphorically relays the feelings of hopeless attraction. With influences from alt rock greats such as Arctic Monkeys, the driving music and lyrical imagery convey the passionate energy resulting from emotions swinging wildly between thrill and panic. The memorable chorus embodies the uneasy feelings of losing control and trying to resist the temptation and adventure alluded to in the verses.\n\nScott Tournet — Hold Your Head Head Up High\n\nRelease date: Mar 24, 2023\n\nGenre: Classic Rock\n\nSimilar artists: Daniel Rateliff, The Black Keys, Jack White, Grace Potter and The Nocturnals.\n\n“This song is designed to lift you up. If Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone made a record at Muscle Shoals Studios in 1973 but then sent the stems to 2023 to be mixed and mastered. Retro Futuristic..” There’s something about this artist that reminds me of Steve Miller. I love his voice for its tone and delivery of the lyrics."
