        "text": "FBI agents Monday stepped up a multistate search for two Arizona men after motel managers in Vinita reported the men had stayed there the night of the Oklahoma City federal building attack and one resembled elusive bombing suspect \"John Doe 2.\" Both men lived in an apartment in Kingman, Ariz., until April 3, less than a block from the motel room rented at the same time by bombing defendant Timothy James McVeigh, The Oklahoman learned.\n\nThe FBI confirmed agents have mounted a search for the two men - identified as Gary Allen Land, 35, and Robert Jacks - and Land's car, a white 1981 Ford Thunderbird, with Arizona tag number JWK-923.\n\nJacks' age was described as mid-50s.\n\nThe FBI did not say either man was \"John Doe 2\" - only that agents were looking for a potential witness to the bombing. The men were reported to be last seen April 24 at the Vinita motel.\n\nMotel manager Tom Crafton said one guest grinned when he was told four days after the bombing he looked just like a sketch of \"John Doe 2.\" Both guests left the next day.\n\n\"He came in and got some ice. ... I said, 'I've been seeing your picture on TV all morning. ' I said, 'You look like the guy they've been showing on there that done the bombing. ' ... He just kind of grinned and walked out. \" Crafton's wife, Juanita, said, \"One of them resembled ... 'John Doe 2' big-time. \" Agents spent most of Sunday gathering physical evidence at the 20-room Deward and Pauline Motel. Agents Monday were canvassing restaurants, convenience stores and banks in the Craig County town northeast of Tulsa.\n\nAgents were showing employees composite drawings and looking for surveillance tapes.\n\nThe tip in Vinita was one of more than 13,000 leads pursued by FBI agents in their frustrating worldwide manhunt for the second suspect in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building the morning of April 19.\n\nThe FBI on Monday released a third sketch of the suspect - a profile. FBI Special Agent Weldon Kennedy again insisted investigators do not yet know his identity.\n\n\"This sketch is based on additional witness interviews,\" Kennedy said. \"He has been described as muscular and very tan. He may be a weight lifter.\n\n\"Citizens may still consider the previous sketches which have been released in this case. This individual should be considered armed.\n\n\"At this point, we believe his age to be late 20s to early 30s. To date, we do not know his identity, so we have not interviewed anyone, to our knowledge, who has personal knowledge of this individual. \" In Kingman, Ariz., FBI agents raided a trailer home Monday evening belonging to Michael Fortier, a friend of McVeigh's who had served in the same Army unit.\n\nAt least 20 law enforcement officers were at the scene, according to witnesses. Yellow crime tape was wrapped through a chain link fence around the home.\n\nElsie Starkey, a neighbor, said she saw Fortier leave in his black Jeep shortly before FBI agents arrived.\n\nOn an application for a private mail box in Kingman, McVeigh listed his address as the current home of Fortier. Fortier has refused to comment on his friendship with McVeigh.\n\nIn Kansas, federal agents searched the woods and sent divers into Geary State Fishing Lake looking for evidence that materials for the bomb were mixed nearby and that tools and equipment used in the mixing were thrown into the water.\n\nKennedy confirmed investigators believe the fertilizer-based bomb was built in Kansas.\n\nMcVeigh, a 27-year-old drifter known to hold extremist right-wing views, is the only one charged so far in the bombing.\n\nInvestigators allege he and another man rented the bomb truck in Junction City, Kan., on April 17.\n\nThe search of the lake seven miles south of Junction City was prompted by witness reports of a Ryder truck at the site after April 17.\n\nInvestigators reportedly found a receipt for 1 ton of ammonium nitrate fertilizer in a search of Terry Nichols' house in Herington, Kan. The receipt bore a fingerGary Allen Land print of McVeigh's, an official said.\n\nNichols, a friend of McVeigh's, is being held as a material witness. He and his brother, James Nichols, are charged in Michigan with conspiracy to make bombs.\n\nIn Council Grove, Kan., Monday, FBI agents were back at Boot's U-Store-It checking records and a storage unit that was rented by a Joe Kyle, a name that owner Vernon \"Boots\" Hager said was an alias investigators are interested in.\n\nA man who gave the name of Kyle and a Junction City address rented the unit in October, but moved out at the end of February or the beginning of March, Hager said. Council Grove is 25 miles from Herington.\n\nTestimony at an April 21 detention hearing in Wichita, Kan., for Terry Nichols was that he used the alias of Kyle.\n\nThe probe in Vinita began Saturday when agents first checked the motel, then returned Sunday to gather evidence.\n\n\"They acted like it was the end of the world. Messed up a room.\n\nI am not too happy with them,\" Tom Crafton said. \"They put that black fingerprint stuff all over everything. It almost looks like it's been on fire. ... I think they ought to clean up their messes. If they can make them, they ought to be able to clean them up. \" The managers said the men arrived at 3 p.m. April 19, claiming to be from Mesa, Ariz. They paid for one night, then the next day paid for four more nights.\n\nAgents Monday were at the El Trovatore Apartments in Kingman, Ariz., where Land and Jacks stayed from Nov. 3 to April 3. Owner June Terranova said the two moved out - saying they were going to Oklahoma, where Jacks' sons lived.\n\nShe said agents told her \"they were supposed to have seen Gary's car in Oklahoma City. \" She said she did not think either man looked like the composite drawing of \"John Doe 2\" and she said she never saw McVeigh - or anyone else - visit them.\n\nInvestigators believe McVeigh was in the nearby Imperial Motel in Kingman from March 31 to April 12.\n\nThe Oklahoman learned that Land got the tag JWK-923 for the 1981 Ford Thunderbird in March, using the apartment as his address.\n\nLand lived at the Copper State Motel & Trailer Park in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa for about nine months before moving out last fall, said Opal Hancock, a neighbor.\n\nHancock said she didn't have anything to do with men, but did know them.\n\n\"Gary didn't talk to nobody much,\" Hancock said. \"I only heard him say two or three words. \" Hancock remembered the white Thunderbird they drove and Land lifting weights outside.\n\nHancock was interviewed by agents Monday and identified Land from a photo.\n\nThe FBI also has checked at the Dan D Motel in Perry because of information Land and Jacks may have rented a room there, too, the day of the bombing.\n\nMcVeigh was arrested north of Perry 75 minutes after the bombing after a trooper noticed his car had no tag. He was jailed in Noble County on a misdemeanor charge for carrying a gun and the FBI found him there April 21.\n\nStillwater bail bondsman Brent Goad told The Oklahoman Monday that McVeigh called him about 8:30 a.m. the morning after the bombing seeking assistance in getting released on bond. \"He didn't have bond set yet so I told him there wasn't anything I could do,\" Goad said. \"He was persistent. He wanted me to call a judge to try to speed it up.\n\n\"He told me he was from Carolina. \" The FBI is continuing to seek an Arizona license plate with the number LZC-646 that they theorize may have become detached from McVeigh's yellow Mercury.\n\nThe FBI's hot line number for tips is (800) 905-1514.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
