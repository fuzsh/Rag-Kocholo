        "text": "After Kate Roberts escaped from Megan Hathaway's compound, she was found and rescued by a mysterious fishing boat where she was put to work cutting fish. Kate knew there was mysterious boss and managed to get an audience with them. On May 8, Dimitri walked into his office to come face to face with Kate. Kate was stunned as she heard all about Dimitri from Billie, and thought he was in prison.\n\nDimitri says him being out of prison is his business only. Kate thinks Dimitri kidnapped her for a ransom, and tells him to call her loved ones to collect. Dimitri says he isn't interested in a ransom and implies he kidnapped Kate for another reason, but won't tell her. Instead, Dimitri aka Kate for a tango, wondering how she measures up to her daughter. Kate holds a knife in Dimitri, so he has her taken back to cut up fish.\n\nWhile having dinner with Kate, he is about to explain his intentions when Chad bursts in. Dimitri immediately grabbed Kate and drew his gun, saying Chad wasn't invited to his dinner party. Dimitri noted that he remembered Chad, and called him one of Stefano DiMera's bastard children. Chad said he preferred to think of himself as a love child, and Dimitri noted Chad had Stefano's arrogance, but not his cunning since he burst in there without a plan.\n\nChad said he had backup, and Dimitri said he knew that Steve Johnson and Harris Michaels were with him since had been expecting them, which is why his entire crew were armed to the teeth with orders to shoot to kill. Chad placed his gun on the table, and asked Dimitri how they resolve this. Dimitri noted that Chad just did by putting his gun on the table, and now he can kill both him and Kate. Chad reminded Dimitri the DiMera family would pay a fortune to get him back, and Dimitri admitted it was tempting, but he'd rather kill both Chad and Kate.\n\nSteve and Harris arrived, and Kate wiggled out of Dimitri's grip, allowing Steve and Harris to over power him. They tied Dimitri to a chair, and Harris stayed with Dimitri till the ISA arrived to arrest him. Dimitri stayed calm cause he had another hostage that wasn't on the ship. Harris noted Dimitri wanted immunity, and Dimitri said he wanted something else as well that wasn't money. Dimitri revealed he wanted to help get Megan Hathaway out of prison.\n\nHarris was confident that Megan would stay put in prison, and that Dimitri would be sent to an ISA black site cause the ISA wouldn't negotiate with him. Dimitri noted that Shane Donovan is the head of the ISA, and because he is, he will give him exactly what he wants, Harris figured out it had to do with the hostage, and Dimitri revealed that the hostage was Shane's son Andrew Donovan, who had been snatched just before Kate had been rescued.\n\nDimitri was held at a police station in Greece. Steve and Harris tried to intimidate Dimitri into revealing where he was holding Andrew, but despite showing some fear, Dimitri stood firm and told the men that if any harm came to him, his men have explicit instructions to kill Andrew.\n\nSteve and Harris wondered why Dimitri wanted him to get immunity for Megan. Harris wondered if Dimitri had been brainwashed, but Dimitri laughed that he doesn't need to be brainwashed to help Megan. They wondered if Megan was Dimitri's girlfriend, so he told them that Megan was his mother.\n\nDimitri admitted that, although he and his mother haven't always been close to each other, they have always had a close relationship. Harris asked Steve if he is buying this, and Steve admitted he is, saying Dimitri was a ruthless soulless DiMera through and through.\n\nDimitri laughed that they can insult his lineage all they want, but Megan is supposed to call him soon, and if he can't give her the news she wants to hear, Andrew will pay the price. Steve leaves the room to talk to Shane. Once alone, Dimitri tries to recruit Harris to work for him and Megan.\n\nDimitri tells Harris that Steve and the others will never accept him, but he and his other value the skills he processes. He brings up how Bo Brady was willing to discard his old identity as a good guy, and embrace his roots as a member of the Kiriakis family. He suggests Harris could do the same, but Harris told him the only way he would ever work for him and Megan is if he brainwashed him. Dimitri smirked that he would take it under advisement.\n\nSteve returned to confirm that Shane will give Dimitri what he wants, and Dimitri's phone rang. He demanded they give it to him, and Harris called Dimitri pathetic as Steve handed to him. Dimitri answered the phone and gave Megan the good news, saying he can't wait to celebrate. Megan praised him and said she can't wait to see him, but they need to add one more person to their deal. Dimitri then requested immunity for Kristen DiMera as well, and it was granted.\n\nUpon his release, Dimitri went to visit Chad. Chad was shocked to see Dimitri and assumed he was here for revenge, but Dimitri said he wasn't. Chad blasted Dimitri for kidnapping Kate and vowed to make him pay. Dimitri noted that Chad's loyalty to Kate was admirable, but misplaced since he doesn't share blood with Kate, but they share blood. Chad was confused, so Dimitri revealed he was Megan's son, making Chad his uncle.\n\nChad rejected Dimitri calling him uncle and said he doesn't want anything to do with him, but Dimitri made it clear that he and Megan planned to return to Salem and become apart of the DiMera family by moving into the family's mansion. Chad wondered if Dimitri was hoping they could all be one big happy family, and Dimitri clarified that they were.\n\nDimitri asked for any tips on being part of the family. He said the Von Leuschner's weren't as close as the DiMera's seem to be. Chad said the DiMera's always sleep with one eye open, but with him and Megan around, it will be two. Dimitri asked Chad to fire up the DiMera jet, so they can get to know each other on the ride home. Chad said he didn't have access to it, and Dimitri said he was willing to fly coach to spend some time with his uncle.\n\nChad rejected Dimitri again, but Dimitri said that like it or not they are family, so they will be seeing a lot of each other at family gathering. He hugged Chad before leaving and reminding him that they are family. Megan returned to Salem before Dimitri, and she began to worry that Dimitri hadn't shown up in Salem since he was supposed to come to Salem as soon as he was released. She expressed these worries to Kristen just as Dimitri arrived at the mansion, assuring his mother that her son was here.\n\nMegan wonders what took Dimitri so long, and he explained that they made it as difficult for him return to Salem since they weren't too pleased with the immunity. Dimitri felt a bit of resentment towards Kristen for threatening to shoot off his privates, and Kristen responded that she didn't know Dimitri was her nephew.\n\nMegan told Dimitri and Kristen to let bygones be bygones especially since they will be getting married. Dimitri and Kristen are floored and creeped out by the suggestion even though they weren't blood related.\n\nMegan reminded Kristen that she was raised by Stefano to be Tony's betrothed. Dimitri also didn't like the idea of marrying someone he didn't have a personal connection with her, and was twice his age. Kristen warned her nephew to watch it. Megan explained that it is imperative Dimitri marry before for his 40th birthday, which was only a few months away.\n\nMegan went onto explain that Dimitri is set to inherit a large sum of Von Leuschner money that will fund their plans, but only if he is married by his 40th. Dimitri wondered why he hadn't heard about this before, and Megan said she just recently found out as well because certain members of the Von Leuschner family were hoping Dimitri wouldn't succeed.\n\nDimitri still refused to marry Kristen, and she agreed, saying showing up with her nephew on her arm wouldn't look good in her custody fight against Brady. Dimitri reassured Megan there are plenty of fish in the season, but Megan worried about finding the right one.\n\nGwen Rizczech entered the mansion looking to do an interview with Dimitri. Kristen introduced Gwen as her friend, and Megan wondered how they knew each other. Gwen explained that Kristen had blackmailed her into busting her out of prison, and Kristen added that she had helped Gwen out of a jam or two, including that she had secured Gwen a pardon while they were in prison.\n\nDimitri wondered why Gwen was in prison, and Gwen said that she was in prison for kidnapping her late sister Abigail Deveraux, who was also his uncle Chad's wife. Gwen saw Abigail as an obstacle in her path for getting what she wanted, but now deeply regrets his actions.\n\nShe then inquired about Dimitri, but he said he wasn't interested in doing any interviews. Megan pulled Dimitri into the next room, and said she thinks Gwen would make the ideal wife for him. Dimitri was resistant, but once he and Megan overheard Gwen mention getting over Xander Kiriakis to Kristen, Dimitri agreed to the interview.\n\nDimitri had second thoughts about the interview especially once he found out he not only had to stay married for a year, but he had to appear to genuinely love her as well. Megan told Dimitri that if he pulls this off, they won't have to share the DiMera fortune with their relatives, and will have their own fortune to share. Dimitri was stunned that Megan would assume he would share his fortune with her, but Megan reminded her son about all she did for him and this was his way of paying her back.\n\nKristen entered the room, and enquired what Megan was planning with the Von Leuschner fortune, but Megan wouldn't tell her, and sent Dimitri away to get ready. When Dimitri came back down, he handed Dimitri a dossier that she had compiled on Gwen, and Dimitri took it before leaving for the interview.\n\nWhen Dimitri arrived at Gwen's suite at the Salem Inn, he was stunned that Leo opened the door. Dimitri was ready to exact some payback on Leo, but Gwen stopped him and threatened to have him sent back to prison if he harmed Leo, so Dimitri relented and apologized to Gwen.\n\nLeo left the room, and Gwen told Dimitri she has their table reserved at the Bistro, Dimitri requested to do the interview in her room. Gwen assumed Dimitri had other intentions, but Dimitri assured her he didn't, saying that it would be more quiet in the room. Gwen agreed, and Dimitri offered to buy room service as his treat.\n\nGwen started the interview, and Dimitri recounted his life, explaining that he was mostly tasked by his mother, and that she had been through some stuff prior to his birth, so in a way, he also had to parent her. Gwen wondered about his father, and Dimitri said he was never around and when he was, he was cold and distant and not much of a father. Dimitri blamed his father's lack of love on the reason why he went down the path he did.\n\nGwen said she can relate because her hostility towards her sister came from the fact that she believed her father also didn't love her, and her own mother wasn't much of a mother to her. Gwen says that she feels a connection to Dimitri that she didn't think she would feel.\n\nDimitri returned home to tell Megan about his interview with Dimitri, but found only Kristen there. Kristen was excited for her nephew to tell him how things went with Gwen. Dimitri explained the connection Gwen felt with him because of their similar backgrounds. Kristen reminded those details were fabricated to bond him closer to Gwen.\n\nDimitri agreed the details were modified, and said he detects Kristen disapproves. Kristen says she would be a hypocrite, but Dimitri wanted to be sure Kristen was okay with him using Gwen. Kristen admitted that she likes Gwen, but Gwen owes her and Kristen doesn't owe her anything.\n\nDimitri says when he marries Gwen, it will be richer and not for poorer. Kristen laughs, and reminds Dimitri that Megan has plans for all that money he is set to inherit. Dimitri knows cause Megan has a plan for everything. Megan comes back, and Dimitri tells her the interviews went well, and there is a mutual connection. Megan thinks Dimitri should go and see Gwen again, and Dimitri agrees.\n\nDimitri shows up at Gwen and Leo's place with flowers for Gwen. Leo starts accusing Dimitri of using Gwen, but Gwen sends him away. Dimitri tells Gwen that he has fallen for her, and Gwen says she has for him as well. They kiss and have sex, but Gwen says it can't ever happen again since she wants to schedule more interviews with Dimitri. Dimitri suggests they end their professional relationship, and then throws Gwen through a loop by proposing her.\n\nGwen is unsure, and then Leo comes back, and Dimitri makes himself scarce. He returns to the mansion, and tells Megan he asked Gwen to marry him. Megan is thrilled and confidant that Gwen will say yes. Megan says she can hear wedding bells already as Stefan DiMera and Gabi Hernandez enter. Stefan asks about wedding bells, and Megan covers by saying that she was telling his nephew that she wanted to throw Stefan and Gabi an engagement party.\n\nDimitri has a hard time getting a hold of Megan and has an encounter with Xander, who overhears his desire to marry Gwen. Xander makes it clear he doesn't trust Dimitri and wants him to stay away from Gwen. Dimitri doesn't remember Xander at first, but then remembers Gwen mentioning how she wants to get over him. The two men exchange threats and go their separate ways.\n\nDimitri returns to Gwen and Leo's room to propose with an actual ring. Leo is openly sceptical of Dimitri's motives who tries to convince Leo that his intentions towards Gwen are pure and that he hopes he and Leo can find common ground on wanting Gwen to be happy. Leo backs down and reluctantly lets Dimitri propose to Gwen. Dimitri also invites Gwen to be his date to Stefan and Gabi's engagement party.\n\nOn his way out, Dimitri sees Johnny and Wendy Shin and approaches them. Johnny and Dimitri had previously met and become acquainted as cousins, so Johnny introduces Dimitri to Wendy. Dimitri asks Johnny if he is going to Stefan and Gabi's engagement party. Wendy chimes in that she loves parties, so Johnny says he'll see Dimitri there.\n\nDimitri arrives with Gwen on his arm and greets Chad and Stephanie, saying he is determined to make Gwen his wife. Chad scoffs in shock and says he does not support them getting married. Megan soon arrives and greets the guests as Harris arrives and announces he is there to kill Stefan on Li Shin's orders. Gabi jumps on Harris' back and he accidentally shoots Megan. Dimitri rushes to his mother's side to stop the bleeding as she loses consciousness.\n\nDimitri stays at the hospital while Megan recovers from surgery. During which time, she is arrested when EJ and Kristen accuse her of trapping them in the DiMera tunnels. Gwen also stays by Dimitri's side through the whole ordeal as he worries about Megan.\n\nDimitri was there when Megan woke up, and Megan was happy to see Dimitri, but quickly realized she was handcuffed to the bed. Dimitri explained that Megan had been arrested since Aunt Kristen and Uncle EJ had accused her of locking them in the DiMera tunnels. Megan denied the accusations, but Dimitri remembered seeing Megan coming out of the DiMera tunnels with food.\n\nMegan was horrified that Dimitri would think she was capable of this and worried about him turning on her. Dimitri assured his mother he would never turn on her, and loves her. Megan asked Dimitri about his proposal to Gwen. Dimitri said that Gwen still hasn't accepted the proposal, but she has been here with her at the hospital the whole time.\n\nGwen entered the room to check in on Megan. Megan told Gwen and Dimitri that this near death experience has taught her that life ti too short and they shouldn't waste a single second. Dimitri offered to take Gwen home, and she left. Dimitri said he would be right behind her, and after Gwen left, Dimitri complicated Megan on her performance. Megan thanked Dimitri, and told him it's time for him to take the reins and make sure Gwen accepts the proposal.\n\nGwen took Dimitri home and she sat him down and said yes to marrying her. Dimitri was glad but wondered why Gwen said yes. Gwen admitted that what Megan said made her realize that she was right and shouldn't waste any time. Dimitri proposes again, and slips the ring on Gwen's finger.\n\nDimitri wants to go tell Megan the good news, but Gwen wants to celebrate. She and Dimitri make love, and he says he doesn't want to wait and they should get married today. Gwen wonders what the rush was, and Dimitri pushes it back to the end of the month, saying he promised himself he would be married by his 40th birthday and that was at the end of the month. Gwen agreed they would get married at the end of the month and then celebrate her husband's birthday.\n\nDimitri got home and was shocked to find Leo in his room. Leo has found the codicil that said Dimitri had to be married by his 40th to get an inheritance and now knew for sure he was using Gwen. Leo went to leave to tell Gwen, but Dimitri stood in his way. Leo told Dimitri to get out of his way, but Dimitri said he can't let him tell Gwen the truth. Leo says Dimitri can't stop him, but Dimitri says he can and then kisses Leo.\n\nLeo breaks the kiss and slaps Dimitri. Leo accuses Dimitri of using his attraction to him to manipulate him. Dimitri pulls off his shirt and admits to Leo that his feelings for him are very real since he is gay. Leo can't believe it since he has good gaydar and did not pick up anything from him. Dimitri said he has gotten good at hiding it.\n\nLeo slowly lets his guard down as Dimitri sweet talks him and makes it clear he wants to have sex with him. Leo asks Dimitri if he will be gentle, and Dimitri says of course. Leo tells him he won't be, and tosses Dimitri on the bed. They have sex, and afterwards, Dimitri begs Leo not to tell Gwen the truth. He says he does like Gwen and will take good care of her, but they can be together in secret.\n\nLeo isn't sure about keeping this secret from Gwen, and asks if it has to be a woman. Dimitri asks if Leo is asking him to marry him before adding that his family is old fashion, so it does have to be a woman. Leo agrees to keep quiet, and Dimitri has him over early this next morning, but Kristen reveals that his cousin Rachel Black saw him and Leo in bed together. She assumed it was a sleep over, but Kristen knew better.\n\nKristen called Gwen her dear friend, and threatened to tell her the truth, but said she would be willing to keep quiet if Dimitri gave her Megan's half of the Von Leuschner fortune since she had skipped town. Before Dimitri could answer, EJ and Stefan walked in, and told their nephew it was great getting to know him, and that they hope he keeps in touch.\n\nDimitri wondered if his uncles were going somewhere, but they clarified that they were kicking him out. However, Kristen stopped them by reminding them that Stefano valued family, and wouldn't want them to kick Dimitri out. Stefan relented, but EJ warned they would regret this. After EJ left, Dimitri thanked his aunt and uncle for having his back. Stefan left, and Kristen reminded Dimitri how he can thank her, so Dimitri agreed with Kristen's request\n\nThe night before the wedding, Gwen kissed Dimitri, and he jumped back, which confused Gwen. Dimitri covered by saying he just has too much on his mind, and Gwen left to go to the office. Dimitri wanted to have sex with Leo, who resisted until Dimitri stripped to his underwear. He and Leo started making out, but then Gwen returned cause she forgot her phone and was shocked to find her fiancé half naked with his best friend.\n\nGwen demanded an explanation, so Leo covered by saying he wanted Dimitri to wear one of his suits because his regular suits weren't flashy enough. Gwen bought the lie, and told Dimitri not to listen to Leo, saying he would look handsome in one is his suits. Rattled, Dimitri told himself he can do this. He can marry Gwen for his inheritance and continue to see Leo in secret.\n\nOn the day the wedding, Dimitri was sexting Leo, but Gwen saw it. Luckily, Leo had decided to put Dimitri's number under the alias of \"MP\". Kristen came up behind Dimitri while he was texting Leo, and teased him about texting Leo which Dimitri denied. After getting dressed and going downstairs, Dimitri would learn Stefan and Gabi had booked the mansion for his wedding.\n\nWhile EJ and Stefan were hostile towards Dimitri at first, Stefan realized the benefits of playing nice with Dimitri and talked Gabi into having a double wedding. Dimitri talked Gwen into the same thing and the couples married after Leo briefly interrupted presumably to tell Gwen the truth, but then changed his mind."
