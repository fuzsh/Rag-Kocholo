        "text": "Dexter has done research into Trinity's life, learning that in reality he is Arthur Mitchell, a devoted family man, teacher and deacon of his local church.\n\nAt home Rita is still upset with Dexter over the apartment issue. Nikki Wald (Rose's girlfriend) is adamant she did not shoot Lundy and Debra. Debra has Dexter take her to the station so she can watch the latest interrogation.\n\nDexter arrives at the crime scene of Trinity's bludgeoning murder. His plan is to try and stay ahead of his colleagues long enough to find Trinity before they do. Dexter spots a smudge Trinity left on the wall but Vince snags the evidence bag away from him.\n\nCut to Trinity washing his hammer (the murder weapon) in the garage.\n\nDebra watches Wald tell questioners she had nothing to do with her shooting. Though Wald has confessed to the vacation murders and to killing her boyfriend, Debra doesn't seem satisfied she won't fess up to shooting Debra and Lundy.\n\nAngel is upset he will be leaving homicide without solving Debra and Lundy's shooting. Angel tells Maria he is happy with the promotion and transfer, even though it will mean desk duty.\n\nDexter and Rita attend marriage counseling. The therapist gets Rita to admit Dexter's behavior isn't new and she has been trying to change him. That said, she doesn't want to stay in the marriage unless he is completely honest with her.\n\nWhile Dexter tests possible murder weapons, Vince runs in having found the crime scene smudge was cremated human remains along with a bit of the killer's saliva. Dexter knows Vince won't find Mitchell in the data base.\n\nDebra is still looking for evidence Wald might have been at the scene of her shooting. One of Harry's informants she had contacted left her a voicemail, telling Debra \"If you want to know the truth . . . \"\n\nDexter is trying to open up with Rita but having difficulty.\n\nDexter makes contact with Trinity after church, introducing himself as Kyle Butler, a man who is looking for help from a new church after his wife left him. Trinity tells Dexter the church is involved with building homes for the homeless and invites him to help with the latest build.\n\nChristine tells Quinn her editor is looking for more coverage of the vacation murders and asks for an interview with Debra. Quinn tells her \"no way.\" Debra shows up at Quinn's apartment and says she is thinking about giving false testimony that she saw Wald shoot her. Quinn tells her to give it some thought.\n\nVince discovered the DNA of the human remains and the killer's saliva show the two are related. They wonder why the killer would leave such a clue behind.\n\nAt the build site Trinity appears to be using the murder weapon. Dexter says he is without tools and Trinity lets him borrow the hammer. Dexter learns Trinity has been involved in these builds for years. He spots Trinity's son, Jonah, and asks him about his father. Jonah says their family is great and his father recently gave him a car.\n\nDebra visits Wald in her cell and tries to get her to confess to shooting her and Lundy. Wald sticks to the truth and Debra ends up choking her for several minutes before leaving in tears.\n\nMaria goes to brass and offers to change departments herself to keep Angel in homicide.\n\nDexter arrives home with nice gifts for all the kids. Rita is unimpressed, far more interested in Dexter opening up. He chokes again on sharing and she tells him she wants to increase their therapy sessions.\n\nMaria tells Angel she has arranged for him to stay in homicide. He isn't too keen on her having to move and they seem unsure what to do next.\n\nVince finds out the DNA from the scene is female, meaning it came from the killer's mother, sister or grandmother.\n\nDexter tells Maria he has discovered the hammer model used in the murder.\n\nDebra has been searching through Lundy's research and now thinks Wald is probably telling the truth. She notices that some of Lundys stuff is missing and thinks Trinity may have stolen it.\n\nMaria and Angel tell brass they have broken up and both plan to remain in homicide. After the meeting she tells Angel \"it's over,\" and he says \"sorry.\"\n\nDexter has to figure out how to hide his blood collection and killing tools. He does some research and finds out that Trinity's murders have been exact replications of family deaths His sister was found dead in a bathtub, his mother jumped off a bridge and his father was bludgeoned to death.\n\nAfter the next work day with Trinity's church, Dexter cuts himself as an excuse to get inside Trinity's house. When Trinity goes for a first aid kit, Dexter sees that Trinty's build sites have been the excuse for traveling to the various sites of his murders. Dexter spots the urn with Trinity's sister's ashes and holds it in his hand when Trinity returns to the room. This freaks Trinity out and he pins Dexter up against a wall with his forearm. He snaps out of it and apologizes to Dexter. Trinity tells Dexter he used to push people away but that his family saved him. Before he leaves Trinity gives Dexter a set of tools, including the murder weapon.\n\nAt the next counseling session Dexter tells Rita he wants \"to let you in\" but doesn't know how. They discuss the murder of Dexter's mother and he says he wants to change. Rita promises she will stay with him even if she learns who he truly is. He says he kept the apartment to have some space for himself.\n\nWe see Trinity and his wife enjoying a tender moment in the bath.\n\nDebra shares with Dexter her belief that Trinity realized Lundy was on to him and stole pieces of his research. She is certain Trinity shot them.\n\nWith the family's help, Dexter builds a shed in the backyard. Inside he stores his blood and the chest with his knives. Dexter feels he is evolving and \"it feels good.\" ."
