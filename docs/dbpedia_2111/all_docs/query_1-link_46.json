        "text": "Beneath a mass of engraved stone and earth at Highgate Cemetery in London, the skeletal toe of Karl Marx is twitching merrily to the sounds of Das Kapital.\n\nMuch to the relief of Adam Smith fans, Marx's magnum opus has not been turned into a musical. Das Kapital is the musical alias of Kyle Brinkmann, one of South Africa's top electronic dance music producers. His tracks have featured on the trailer for the 2012 blockbuster hit 22 Jump Street (released locally today) as well as the US TV series Ringer, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar.\n\nThis pierced-lipped, tattoo-sporting producer - who at one point dressed as \"a goth that listens to hip-hop and techno\" - is well on his way to becoming a pretty big deal.\n\nIn his early adolescence, Brinkmann began fiddling around with songwriting until, at age 15, he graduated to production. Unfortunately, finding a catchy stage name was harder than making the actual music.\n\n\"By the time I was 17 or 18, I had been producing music for three years but still didn't have a stage name. I ran through a whole bunch of terrible names before eventually settling on Das Kapital, which I was reading at the time,\" he said.\n\nSince then, Brinkmann has ridden the EDM tsunami that has swept through the music world without being entirely sucked into the mainstream fist-pumping sugariness that defines much of the genre.\n\n\"It's funny because a lot of the guys who were complaining that dance is too repetitive and calling it rave a few years ago are now at every festival losing their minds. I think that happens with every genre when it blows up,\" he said.\n\nHis musical knowledge and non-conformism have endowed him with a matchless sound and he isn't afraid to draw inspiration from across the spectrum.\n\n\"Personally, I love the idea of being able to combine straight stadium metal with something like dub step or electro house,\" he said.\n\n\"It's weird that guys pigeonhole themselves. I have no issue with someone wanting to be the master of a sound but music is by nature ethereal and no genre stays the same.\"\n\nThis passion for EDM has taken him from hosting the Das Kaptial show on UCT radio, which trended nationally on Twitter on its first night on air, to a spot on 5FM on Thursday nights called In Das We Trust that showcases what he believes are the best unreleased electronic dance music tracks from across the globe.\n\n\"The 5FM thing started as a way of me saying, hey main market South Africa, these are sounds that are doing damage on the dance circuit but are not necessarily released. It's great because I don't have to go in and do what the playlist already does,\" Brinkmann said.\n\nHe is arguably the local EDM scene's arch hipster, a fact that comes across not just in his encyclopaedic musical knowledge but also in his taste for bizarre but oddly stylish fashion choices. He has caught the attention of men's fashion magazine GQ.\n\n\"The whole fashion thing started when I was 15-16 and took control of what I was wearing. [Last] summer I wore all black because everyone everywhere was doing the bright colours thing. The only problem with that was that I had to spend all summer in the shade,\" he said.\n\nMarx may not be the most popular corpse in the world but with every passing day more and more people are getting to know Das Kapital."
