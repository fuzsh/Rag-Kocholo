        "text": "2020 Hall Of Fame Postponed!\n\nBy Sally Katen\n\nThis probably comes as no surprise, but the SBS Hall of Fame Committee and the Board of Directors have reluctantly voted to postpone the 2020 Hall of Fame Induction and Ceremony.\n\nConsidering the Covid-19 virus has not gone away and there is no viable vaccine at this time, we believe the safety and protection of our members and audience are more important.\n\nAn alternative for next year will be discussed in the meantime, including placing a plaque on the HOF Wall at the Torch Club that indicates the absence of inductees for 2020. We’re considering CORONA 2020!\n\nAs always, you can continue to submit any nominee you believe meets the criteria and deserves to be inducted. This information can be found on our website www.sacblues.com under the Hall Of Fame tab.\n\nThank you for your understanding during this difficult time. WE WON’T GIVE UP!\n\n[ezcol_1half]\n\nNominations and Guidelines\n\nEach year the Sacramento Blues Society receives nominations of those people in the Sacramento area who have been either a Performer (musician/vocalist) or Non-Performer (supporter of the blues) for 20 or more years, who are deserving of recognition. The guidelines and selection process for the SBS Hall of Fame are available HERE. If you are interested in nominating someone, you may submit your nomination online (below), mail the printed form to our P.O. Box or hand it to a SBS board member.\n\nThe deadline for nominations is June 1st every year. Please be sure to attend our Annual Induction Ceremony held at Harlow’s with a Blues Celebration following at the Torch Club featuring live music and special appearances by previous Inductees! Details will be posted on home page in advance of each year’s show\n\nAll past inductees are listed below. If you’re ever in the Torch Club, check out our Wall of Fame with photos and perpetual plaque.\n\n[/ezcol_1half] [ezcol_1half_end]\n\nHall of Fame Nominations\n\n[/ezcol_1half_end]\n\nLeo Bootes\n\nInducted 2019\n\nThere is no doubt that Leo Bootes was born to perform. When he picks up a guitar and steps center stage, he is confident, creative, and focused. He may be playing slide guitar, bass, or singing, but people listen.\n\nThe son of a Filipino Merchant Marine and a Scots-Irish mother, Leo lived in Seattle until his mother brought him to Sacramento when he was in elementary school.\n\nWhen he was 9 years old, someone gave Leo a cheap, old Sears Roebuck guitar with nylon strings. He learned to tune it and play by listening to recordings of the great rock and blues guitarists of the day. When he was 16, he left home to live on the streets of Sacramento and listen to local musicians like Johnny “Guitar” Knox. The two formed a friendship and Knox became Leo’s teacher and mentor. Crowds would gather when they sat outside Java City Café to practice.\n\nStill in his teens, Leo joined with other young musicians to form a rock band named Fat Molly’s Kitchen. The band got attention, playing up and down the California Coast. Later, he gathered other groups such as The Southside Shuffle, and Low Down Dirty Dogs. He spent 8 years with the Gary Mendoza Band and more recently playing pickup with other groups.\n\nLeo believes it has always been his destiny to play the music he loves and his induction to the Sacramento Blues Society Hall of Fame proves that to be true.\n\nMartin ‘Marty’ Deradoorian\n\nInducted 2019\n\nMartin “Marty” Deradoorian was born in Providence, Rhode Island and started playing professionally at age 19 with friend and band leader the great Jeffrey Osborne. While in Providence he toured with the Fatman Wilson Revue on the East Coast and up into Canada and Nova Scotia. He moved to San Francisco and played with Johnny Mars and Mike Henderson and backed up the great Albert Collins. He moved to Sacramento and got his first gig with fellow inductee Gary “Wailin” Black. Then he went onto Dave Bonds/Dave Rees band and was asked to join fellow HOF members Jimmy Morello and Ray “Catfish” Copeland to join The Blue Flames. Marty then opened for and/or shared the stage with the following legends: Bobby”Blue” Bland, Eddie “Cleanhead” Vinson, Taj Mahal, James Cotton, Bo Diddly, Elvin Bishop, Lowell Folson, and Delbert McClinton, and is currently playing his sax with The Foxtrot Mary Revue and gratefully “guesting” with Red’s Blues as well as The Hucklebucks.\n\nKenny Marchese\n\nInducted 2019\n\nBlues guitarist Kenny Marchese began playing Blues in Sacramento 27 years ago in 1992 after seeing Little Charlie and the Night Cats at a Shasta County Blues Society Show. Kenny was a part of the Shasta Blues Society in its inception, playing in local Blues bands in Redding.\n\nIn 1992, Kenny learned about two Blues Bars in Sacramento, The Torch Club, at 16th and L St, Sam’s Hof Brau located on J and 17th, and The Sutter Street Saloon located in Folsom. He started making the drive on Wednesdays for the Johnny Heartsman and Johnny Knox Blues Jams. The Torch Club and Sam’s became a familiar hang out and, in one of Kenny’s first times at a Sam’s blues jam; Robert Nakashima talked Kenny into playing for the first time in Sacramento with him.\n\nKenny became a regular from then on at these two great blues bars. Bands such as Johnny Heartsman, Johnny “Guitar” Knox, Rusty Zinn, Mark Hummel, Arbess Williams, (usually with Pat Balcom on drums), the Soul Prophets, Glenn Lane, Bobby Blues Ray, Omar Sharriff, Smooth Lou and Jimmy Pailer, Lena Mosley with Gene Chambers and Al Arnett, Johnny Nitro and the Door Slammers, Screamin’ Dave and the Bowlevils, The Beer Dawgs, and Little Charlie and the Night Cats, amongst others, were the bands that kept him excited about the Sacramento Blues scene.\n\nIn 1992, Kenny’s band from Northern California Tommy Twang, was included in Sacramento’s first blues compilation CD “Sacramento Blues” produced by “Big” Mike Balma. Kenny also continued to help the Shasta Blues Society book bands from the Sacramento area to their Northern California Blues Festivals in Redding, California.\n\nIn 1996, while at a jam hosted by The Hucklebucks at the Sutter Street Saloon, now known as The Power House Pub, band leader Doug Crumpacker asked Kenny to join his band after playing that night. Kenny then played with The Hucklebucks from 1996 to 1998, at times playing 15-20 dates a month in Sacramento, Chico, Davis and other areas in Northern California. During this time Kenny became one of the dedicated students of the late Johnny “Guitar” Knox. To this day, Kenny still plays with The Hucklebucks.\n\nKenny played with many bands in the Sacramento area over the years, including Ray “Catfish” Copeland’s band Catfish and the Crawdaddies for about ten years, as well as Johnny Guitar Knox’s band for 4 years. He played on and off with other local blues bands such as Bob Mora and the Third Degree Blues Band, Bobby Blues Ray, Gary Mendoza, and Dave Croall. He currently plays with the Kyle Rowland Blues Band with whom he has been playing for the last ten years.\n\nKenny says “the most important thing about my time in the Sacramento Blues scene is the great people I’ve met and become friends with over the years”.\n\nRobert Nakashima\n\nInducted 2019\n\nRobert Nakashima first played guitar onstage at the old Club 400, a venerable Sacramento strip club that featured a blues jam session hosted by the legendary Johnny “Guitar” Knox. As he did for so many younger players, Mr. Knox provided Robert with encouragement, guidance and mentorship at a crucial time. The Blues scene in Sacramento in the mid-eighties was unusually vibrant and alive. On any given night one could run into Johnny Heartsman, Gene Chambers, Marshall Jones, Al Arnett or any number of future Blues Hall of Fame members. It was a welcoming, family-like atmosphere that nurtured young musicians regardless of race, nationality or experience and it was in this environment that Robert received his education in the Blues.\n\nShortly after that first taste, Robert joined the South City Cobras, a down-home aggregation led by harmonica ace Johnny Ayers. Later in 1985, he formed The Soul Prophets with John Kwock and Anthony Brown. Lightning struck one night when he met and became friends with explosive gospel and soul singer as well as future Hall of Fame member Marcel Smith. The addition of Mr. Smith’s once-in-a-generation talents pushed the band to a higher level of creative power, culminating in the album “From the Old School” and a Sammie Award for Best Blues Band (an honor shared with Little Charlie and the Nightcats), both in 1993.\n\nThanks to the tireless efforts of “Big” Mike Balma, another Hall of Fame member, the original Soul Prophets reunited for a memorable show in 2010.\n\nGary “Whalin” Black\n\nInducted 2019\n\nGary “Whalin” Black got his professional name back in 1968 when he joined a band called Rich Waylon. The band never really caught on but Gary liked the name “Whalin” and kept it. Shortly after, he joined a local group called St. George and the Dragons as the lead singer. It wasn’t until another two years that he picked up the guitar.\n\nSeems Gary had always been part of the blues scene in the late 60’s and back in 1970 – 1971. When his number came up for the draft, he refused induction, which got him a two-year stint in minimum security prison. A friend sent him an inexpensive guitar and when he was released, he came out quite a guitar phenomenon; “top of the class” according to Ray “Catfish” Copeland. Gary also learned furniture upholstery and opened his own business “Good as Wood” where he would host after-hour parties when the bars closed.\n\nHe was part of the Sunland Blues Band with Nate “Snakeboy” Shiner, Johnny Nugget, Jerry Eddleman, Tony Montanino and Evan Jenkins. Gary started the jams at the Press Club, where he played for over 3 years, and at the Torch Club. He could sing anything and wasn’t limited by genre restraints. He had the talent, history, and dedication for the Blues and was inextricably entwined in the Sacramento Blues scene.\n\nRichard “RW” Grigsby\n\nInducted 2018\n\nRichard “RW” Grigsby has a special relationship with Sacramento. He has moved here twice! In 1984 after a number of years of playing in Georgia bar bands, RW caught the blues bug when he took to the road with famed harmonica man Fingers Taylor from the Jimmy Buffet band. They toured from Jackson to New Orleans, Austin, Houston and Memphis. In 1988 Richard hooked up with Austin, TX accordion star Ponty Bone’s Squeezetones. At one of Ponty’s gigs, RW met Carlene Carter of the legendary Carter Family. He toured with her through the summer of 1990 behind her top ten single, “I Fell in Love”. A three year stint with Austin harp man Gary Primich touring North America led RW to Sacramento playing at the old Sam’s Hofbrau in 1993. RW (AKA Guitar Grady) joined Dallas guitarslinger and Black Top recording/touring artist Mike Morgan & The Crawl in late 1993, but in 1995, headed for Sacramento. RW joined up with Sacramento mainstays The Hucklebucks. In the late 90’s they were playing 15-20 gigs a month. The road called again though, this time with New Orleans #1 harp man Johnny Sansone. More tours and a move back down south to Alabama until 2006 –when he headed back to Sacramento and got a call from California harmonica ace Mark Hummel. They’ve been working together for over a decade now. As a member of Mark’s ambitious Harmonica Blowouts, RW has backed up almost every major blues harp player in the U.S. including James Cotton, Charlie Musselwhite, Curtis Salgado, Billy Boy Arnold, Lazy Lester, Billy Branch, Mojo Buford, Willie Smith, Johnny Dyer, Rod Piazza, James Harman, Rick Estrin, Sugar Ray Norcia, RJ Mischo, Andy Santana and many more. Their 2013 CD, Remembering Little Walter was nominated for a Grammy and won two Blues Music Awards including Album Of The Year. The last several years, Mark’s project the Golden State-Lone Star Revue has been busy touring here in the states and overseas. Members have included Little Charlie Baty, Anson Funderburgh, Wes Starr, Mike Keller, Rusty Zinn, Mark Hummel–and of course, RW Grigsby, just nominated for the prestigious 2017 Blues Music Awards “BEST BASSIST.”\n\nWhen RW is not on the road, he and wife Beth Reid-Grigsby( AKA Red) have Red’s Blues, formed six years ago. You can find them playing in northern California with Dave Earl on guitar, SBS Hall of Famer Tim Wilbur on drums, RW on bass/vocals and Beth on lead vocals and fronting the band. Sometimes you can even find RW laying down the bottom with another SBS HOFer, Ray “Catfish” Copeland.\n\nTwo highly regarded recent albums, Red’s Blues and You Knock Me Out feature stellar originals from these two–and many outstanding special guests including Rusty Zinn, Rick Estrin, Anson Funderburgh, Kyle Rowland, Rockin’ Johnny Burgin, Mark Hummel, Mike Keller, Jon Lawton, Steve Freund, John Cocuzzi and Sacramento’s Johnny “Guitar” Knox.\n\nArtis “AJ” Joyce\n\nInducted 2018\n\nANY bass player should go to school on Sacramento’s Artis “AJ” Joyce. In one jaw-dropping extended solo, he can seamlessly quote Cream’s Sunshine of Your Love” to Sly Stone’s “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)” to “Mama’s Little Baby Loves Shortnin’ Bread” to Henry Mancini’s “Pink Panther” to the “Habanera“ from Bizet’s opera “Carmen.”\n\nAJ is perhaps best-known for playing on Alligator Records releases by Charlie Musselwhite, beginning with the critically acclaimed Ace of Harps album in 1990, which marked the start of a new era for the legendary singer and harmonica player. Musselwhite was quoted as saying it was made by “the best band I’ve ever had.”\n\nA big man with a big heart, he has toured North America and Europe, backing Musselwhite, Johnny Heartsman, Ron Thompson, Arbess Williams, Harvey Mandel, Little Milton, Sister Monica, Ron Hacker, Mick Martin, Leah Tysse, Alabama Mike and many more. He still makes it a point to come back home and volunteer to play numerous Northern California benefits. As he would say, PEACE!\n\nFrankie Lee\n\nInducted 2018\n\nLongtime Sacramento resident Frankie Lee (Jones) was born in Mart, Texas. As a child, he sang gospel music in church. In 1963, he signed a recording contact with Peacock Records. Billed as Little Frankie Lee, he released three singles, including “Taxi Blues”, a regional hit and his best-known song. After living with his friend Sonny Rhodes in Austin, Texas, Lee was recruited by Ike Turner to join the touring ensemble backing Ike & Tina Turner. Lee then settled in Houston and worked with other musicians, including Big Mama Thornton, Ted Taylor, Junior Parker and Joe Hinton.\n\nLee befriended Albert Collins during this period, and in 1965, they both relocated to California, with Lee singing in Collins’s band from that time until 1968. In 1971, Lee was signed to Elka Records, and his cousin, Johnny “Guitar” Watson, produced Lee’s tracks. In the late 1970s, Lee’s backing ensemble included the young Robert Cray. His firstalbum, The Ladies and the Babies, was released by HighTone Records in 1984. The All music journalist Thom Owens noted that “as one of the first albums on HighTone Records, the album helped set the stage for the numerous records and artists that teetered between soul and blues.\n\nFlying Fish Records released Lee’s second album, Sooner or Later (1992), on which he was backed by Doug Newby and the Bluz Blasters, with a guest appearance by Lucky Peterson. Going Back Home (1994) was released by Blind Pig Records. Lee toured widely, playing at American music festivals and in Europe and Japan. Lee’s final album, Standing at the Crossorads, was released in 2006 by Blues Express. The album was produced by Dennis Walker, who had produced The Ladies and the Babies more than twenty years earlier. Lee settled in Sacramento and acted as a mentor to many local blues musicians, including Kevin Burton, Pete Phillis, Chris Frasier, Martin Holland, Joe Lev, Jim Voorhees, Bruce Bandura, Ridley Howe and Tim Brisson. He appeared at Mekarkey’s, Sam’s HoF Brau, Tootsie’s, the Palms Playhouse, the Torch Club, Mr. D’s, Boston’s, the Powerhouse Pub, the Sacramento Heritage Festival and the Sacramento Blues Festival, Lee died at the age of 73 at his Sacramento home.\n\nJimmy Morello\n\nInducted 2018\n\nA powerful vocalist and super-quick drummer, Jimmy Morello began playing drums at age 11 and formed his first band at 13. He fell in love with blues music after attending a blues revue concert in 1971 with Ray Charles, T-Bone Walker and Jimmy Reed. His Pittsburgh DJ friend introduced him to Louisiana Red who took a shine to Morello’s band Cold Steel. The began to work regular in Pittsburgh blues venues and hit the road playing Washington D.C. , Philadelphia, Boston areas.\n\nMorello moved to Sacramento in 1980 and joined the Blue Flames with Ray ‘Catfish’ Copeland and Johnny Knox. Stayed with the Blue Flames from 1980-1988. Freelanced for several years with Bay Area and Sacramento Blues bands. Moved to Phoenix and played with Bill Tarsha’s Rocket 88’s from 1990-1993. In 1994 was signed with Rounder/Bullseye label with Pat Boyack and the Prowlers. Toured thru the US until 1997, when he returned to Northern California. Went on tour with Bob Margolin. The same year and got signed to JSP label out of England and put out 3 CD’s under his own name. Then he was hired by John Stedman at JSP to become A&R for the label. Produced 10 CD’s for various artists for JSP. During this time he was also touring Europe, Greece, Belgium and Switzerland and headlining festivals under his own name. He also had the pleasure of doing a Rounder/Bullseye Blues tour thru the US with Pat Boyack, Smokey Wilson and Smokin’ Joe Kubek. Here are some of the names of the great blues artists he has played with; Louisiana Red, Nappy Brown, Carey Bell, Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin, Lazy Lester, Clarence Holliman and Carol Fran, Joe Houston, Big Jay McNeely, just to name a few.\n\nAndy Santana\n\nInducted 2018\n\nBorn in San Jose, California, Andy Santana’s interest in blues and soul had an auspicious start. At 12 years old, Andy’s teenaged babysitter listened to the local radio station. She also played 45 records of her two favorites, Bobby Bland and James Brown when the radio didn’t please her. One fateful day, she won a radio promotion– two tickets for an afternoon show featuring James Brown and the Famous Flames! Couldn’t ditch Andy, so they rode the crosstown bus to the San Jose Civic Auditorium. “All the women were going nuts. I’d never heard girls scream like that before.” What a phenomenon for a 12-year-old lad. “I was amazed by the energy and environment.”\n\nOn Andy’s 19th birthday a girlfriend Janet gave to him two harmonicas, saying “you need some music”.\n\nSoon after while in San Francisco Golden Gate park, two life-changing moments occurred. While walking through the park he heard a young man (possibly Mark Hummel), playing. Andy asked him about a song he was playing—it was a Little Walter song. Andy scribbled it down on a matchbook cover. Later, that evening he walked past a North Beach club where Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee were booked. “I didn’t know a harmonica could sound like that,” Santana said. “I’d always looked at it as a toy. I had one but didn’t know one end from another. I was just blowing and drawing and making noise, not music. When I saw Sonny Terry, wow, I wanted to do that.”\n\nHumbled by his deep appreciation for his early musical encounters with harmonica player Gary Smith, guitarist Junior Watson and guitarist/harmonica player Paul Durkett helped to mold his lifetime of playing. Andy always credits his musical friends as the reason for inspiration and direction.\n\nWith over 30 years experience fronting bands in Northern California, Andy and his band have backed, played and toured with blues legends guitarist Jimmy Rogers, guitarist Luther Tucker, drummer Al Duncan, bassist Dave Myers, guitarist Freddie Robinson (Abu Talib), singer Nappy Brown, saxophonist Joe Houston and singer/guitarist Earl King. Andy was also featured on harmonica with Bonnie Raitt at the Bay Area Music Awards. He has played many West Coast music festivals, also the Jazz and Heritage Festival in New Orleans, and has toured from Seattle to Belgium.\n\nIn 2015, Andy joined southern California’s Delta Groove Music as a recording artist and producer. His CD Watch Your Step was released worldwide to rave reviews. He co-produced and wrote most of Lady Of The Blues for blues star Miss Freddye of Pittsburgh, PA, who was nominated for two Blues Music Awards in 2017.\n\nAndy’s band, the West Coast Playboys, consists of renowned northern California artists–Rusty Zinn, Mike Phillips, June Core, Greg Roberts, Kenny Marchese, and Larry Carr, depending on venue and location. These musicians form a world class blues band playing rhythm and roots music reminiscent of New Orleans, Chicago, and West Coast influences.\n\nBill Scholer\n\nInducted 2017\n\nBill Scholer is a native Californian, born in Concord, California in 1954. As a teenager, he was greatly influenced by Jimmy Page, Albert King, Mike Bloomfield, Steve Miller and many others. From that point on he worked to become a guitarist, making many trips on a Greyhound bus to San Francisco to see guitarists Albert King, Mike Bloomfield, Steve Miller and more.\n\nScholer came to Davis to work for the UCD Art Department as Graphic Technician in 1981, which led him to meet Mike Henderson. Henderson was a blues guitarist who was performing with Mike Bloomfield, Albert Collins and opening for Jerry Garcia. With the encouragement of Henderson, Bill started performing in Davis coffee shops and open mics.\n\nTeaming up with harmonica player Jim Lewis this acoustic duo opened shows for Paul Butterfield and Rick Danko, Willie Dixon, James Cotton and John Lee Hooker at the Palms. Adding drums, bass, and sax, The Bill Scholer Blues Band started hitting the clubs. This initial version of the Bill Scholer Blues Band opened shows for Los Lobos, The Chambers Brothers and The Ventures and played the Sacramento Blues Festival.\n\nAs bands do after many years, Scholer formed a newer version of the Bill Scholer Blues Band, which once represented the Sacramento Blues Society at the Oakland Art Museum at a gathering of Northern California Blues Societies and toured the Ukraine (then part of the USSR as part of the Davis Sister City Project}. Scholer went on to form other bands that played in the old Sam’s Hof Brau, Fox and Goose and the Hogshead Brew Pub in Old Sac. Each of these bands had a mixture of stellar performers.\n\nThe band took another turn in the 90’s, coming together with other current HOF members along with many other notables. Scholer continued to expand his repertoire and even played zydeco music in the Mark St Mary Zydeco Blues Band.\n\nIn 2000 Scholer performed at the Crocker Art Museum with Robert Armstrong, Keith Cary and Jim Monroe for the exhibition The Art of the Resonator Guitar.\n\nTeaching music has always been Bill’s passion; he was awarded the California Arts Council Artist in Residency grant to teach music within the California State Prison system before relocating to Japan in 2012, where he currently resides with his wife Karla.\n\nFred “Deacon” Baker\n\nInducted 2017\n\nFred “Deacon” Baker started his musical career early at the age of six singing gospel in the church choir and was singing solos by the age of 10. His first instrument of choice was the trumpet, which he played in high school and college marching bands. While in high school he taught himself harmonica and in college played in a jazz band that backed such notables as Doc Severinsen. His career in the Navy took him to various countries where he could expand upon his vocals and harp playing, eventually leading him back to the States, where he soon became a popular fixture, playing with Johnny Heartsman, Arbess Williams, and Omar Sharriff (all HOF members now), generally at Sam’s Hof Brau and the Torch Club. He has done studio work with Sly and the Family Stone and Sammy Hagar, television work out of Chico, CA on Channel 12, and even crossed the line playing country at the Opry Land Hotel and the Nashville Palace in Nashville.\n\nUpon returning to Sacramento Deacon was encouraged by Ken Van Cromphaut (Obie Dee) to join his band the BluesExciters and when it folded, joined up with the Sacramento Blues Revue, with whom he continues to play to this day.\n\nKen (Obie Dee) Van Cromphaut\n\nInducted 2017\n\nKen (Obie Dee) Van Cromphaut has been a fixture on the West Coast music scene for more than forty years. With formal classical training, he had a love for Gospel and Blues music at an early age. He has also donned the composer hat and is a member of ASCAP as well as being a session musician and performing artist. As a guitarist, Obie Dee has crafted a crystalline guitar tone and screaming leads, and along with his raspy vocals, they have become his signature sound. His membership in some of the best known bands include The BluesExciters (founder), performed with Mick Martin and the Blues Rockers, The Grant Urias Band, Ro Harpo, the Slim Chance Band, Sleeper, Bone Jelly, and most recently the Zola Moon Band. In addition, Ken has been active in fund-raising events such as Loaves and Fishes, MDA Telethon, and the Multiple Sclerosis Society.

He began sitting in with bands in Sacramento, including Sacramento Hall of Fame members Little Charlie and Rick Estrin of the Nightcats, Ray “Catfish” Copeland, and Johnny Knox, who were each important early influences on his playing and gave him practical education on playing music. Stan continued to sit in with local bands and play at jam sessions while he lived in Arizona and southern California in the 1980s, and he had the opportunity to play with now well-known national artists like Bob Corritore, Janiva Magness, and the William Clarke band (then featuring Rick Holmstrom and Zach Zunis on guitars). Stan also played on his first recording with the Phoenix band, the Hoo Doo Kings.\n\nUpon returning to Sacramento in 1991, Stan joined his first band, the Coolerators, which has since evolved into the current Midtown Creepers. The band has survived almost 25 years with original members Jerry McGuire and Stan Powell – while other personnel have changed, the band still includes a Nightcats alum and Hall of Fame member Liz Peel on bass, who Stan first met while taking lessons from Little Charlie. The Creepers have played at many of the notable Sacramento area clubs, including the Torch Club, Sam’s Hofbrau, the Stoney Inn, and the Sutterville Saloon (now the Powerhouse Pub), and put out their CD “All Over Town” that included a number of originals by the band.\n\nStan was also a member of Catfish and the Crawdaddies for about 15 years, reconnecting musically with Catfish Copeland. Stan participated in most of the band’s performances at the Sacramento Music Festival, and played on all three of the Crawdaddies’ CDs. Stan has also played with other northern California artists, including three CDs by west coast guitar wizard Kenny Blue Ray; Bobby Blues Ray’s recent “Blues Knight of the West Coast” CD; Julie and the Jukes and is currently playing original rock and roll music with Friday Night Band, having played on their first CD.\n\nTim Wilbur\n\nInducted 2017\n\nTim Wilbur has been a first call drummer for an extensive list of Sacramento’s best musicians/bands and beyond, going back decades.

Over the course of his music career, Jay worked with such notables as Chuck Berry, Otis Rush and Charlie Musselwhite and local luminaries like Johnny “Guitar” Knox and more recently, Kyle Rowland. Jay’s professionalism and showmanship were instrumental in taking Little Charlie and the Nightcats from working the local bar scene to being signed by Alligator records and touring the world. Jay fought and conquered some serious health issues and had really been thriving the past few years until the cancer got him.\n\nCharlie Baty recalls “Jay Peterson has represented Sacramento around the whole world. Jay was there at the inception of the blues scene at Sam’s Hofbrau and backed Johnny Knox there for years. Jay lived here for large chunks of time twice in his life. There have been few people who have been as influential as Jay Peterson in the history of Sacramento blues.”\n\nTony Montanino\n\nInducted 2016\n\nANTHONY (TONY) MONTANINO’s first band he played with was The Sunland Blues Band with Steve Samuels, Nate Shiner, and Dave Frasier, playing together about six years. The Sunland Blues Band backed up Luther Tucker, Charlie Musselwhite, John Lee Hooker, Willy Dixon and local Bobby ‘Blues’ Ray many times and opened to a sold-out Boz Skaggs concert at UCD Freeborn Hall.\n\nTony started a blues band called Quickshake after that, which consisted of Ray Copeland, Jim Monroe, and Liz Peel.

That led him to play drums. In the late 70’s Bruce started a successful touring group, the “Bruneau Gold Band” named after his grandfathers Nevada gold mine. Joe Lev was the original bass player. After the BGB, Bruce played with several groups and several styles of music, especially Blues, throughout the western USA, including Hawaii and Alaska. In 1996, Bruce was hired by Bawb Pearce to play drums for the famous BEER DAWGS. After 2 years and almost 600 gigs, Bruce left the BEER DAWGS. Subsequently Mick Martin called Bruce to possibly play drums with MICK MARTIN AND THE BLUES ROCKERS.

Since that day, the BLUES ROCKERS have shared the stage with Joe Bonamassa, Elvin Bishop, Coco Montoya, Eddie Cotton, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Little Feat, Robin Ford and the Ford Brothers Band, Maria Muldaur, Craig Chaquico, Cold Blood, Tommy Castro, Leon Russell, Volker Strifler, Tower Of Power, Terry Hanck, Johnny Winter and most recently, Walter Trout.\n\nBruce has since become an integral part of the BLUES ROCKERS where he happily plays drums and sings to this day.\n\nDonna Proctor Smith\n\nInducted 2015\n\nDonna Proctor Smith is a lifelong musician. At three years old, she demonstrated a fascination for music that was quickly embraced by her father, Vernon Proctor, a distinguished United States Air Force Band commander and later a Sacramento City College adjunct instructor. At age twelve, she began classical training on flute, then at 18, took up her father’s instrument, the bass.\n\nSince the 1970s, Donna has been in demand. Her competent bass playing gained the attention of many headliners, including Blues legend Charles Brown, who offered her a position in his ensemble, Jimmy McCracklin, Floyd Dixon, BB King, Frankie Lee, John Mayall, Ray Charles and country player, Rodney Crowell.

One of her early memories was seeing the local Sunland Blues Band, whom she befriended. She had already begun messing around with the bass guitar and took a few lessons from their bass player, Jerry Eddleman, and later, Andy Samuels. Soon, Liz joined her first band, Quickshake, with Ray “Catfish” Copeland. Charles Baty later joined the band which eventually became Little Charlie and the Nightcats. Liz learned much about Blues from Charlie and still considers him her mentor.\n\nAs the original bass player for Little Charlie and the Nightcats (1976 to ’81), Liz played several Sacramento Blues Festivals, backing Sonny Rhodes, Tiny Powell, Roy Brown, Gatemouth Brown, Big Momma Thornton, and Floyd Dixon. The band toured with Floyd Dixon playing the Eugene, Oregon Blues Festival where (billed as the first female instrumentalist at the festival) she backed Albert Collins, John Lee Hooker, and others. She played with the band at other important blues events like the San Francisco Blues Festival. During those years, the band brought the blues into popular Sacramento Clubs like Maurice’s, Harry’s Bar & Grill, and Tootsies in Old Sacramento. Her solid groove helped put Sacramento on the Blues Map, and she had a unique presence as a woman bass player.\n\nLiz missed the opportunity to record with Little Charlie, leaving the band to complete her education and work a day job. But, she continued to play blues and eventually recorded with Catfish & the Crawdaddies, the Midtown Creepers, and Kenny “Blue” Ray. Over the years, Liz has played gigs with many notable local blues bands and artists such as Johnny “Guitar” Knox, the Hucklebucks, and others. Currently, she plays with the Midtown Creepers most frequently at the prized Torch Club.\n\nMichael Andrews\n\n(?? – 2016)\n\nInducted 2015\n\nIn 1965, young Sacramento musicians heard the call of the blues. Albums released by John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band seem to say “you don’t have to be black to sing and play the blues.” One of the first to heed the call was singer and harp player Michael Andrews, who put together The Parish Hall Blues Band with fellow students from Encina High School. The timing couldn’t have been better, as the group gained management and ended up playing at a number of major rock concerts with the Doors, the Yardbirds, Them (led by Van Morrison), the Grateful Dead, the Youngbloods and Quicksilver Messenger Service. Drummer John Roina remembers being on stage and looking to his right, “There was Jerry Garcia smiling and bopping to the music. He gave me a thumbs up.”.Andrews has been playing the blues ever since. In the 1970s, he played the blues at The Stony Inn in North Sacramento as Andrews & Friends on a regular basis. He was a featured guest artist with Mick Martin & the Blues Rockers in the 1980s at the Sacramento Blues Festival. As with his contemporary, Nate Shiner, he is a true pioneer in Sacramento blues.\n\nRobert Sidwell\n\nInducted 2015\n\nRobert Sidwell’s career as a blues musician began in 1993 as a founding member of the Chrome Addicts along with Tommy Young, Ben Thompson and Brad Cross. In 1995 Robert was a founding member of the Hucklebucks along with Doug Crumpacker. (the band worked 200+ shows a year in nor-cal until 2001). From 2006-08 Robert worked with The Rusty Zinn Band.

He has also composed some fine instrumental pieces as well.\n\nAaron King\n\nInducted 2014\n\nA true product of the Sacramento blues scene, guitarist Aaron King has been an ambassador for Sacramento blues around the world showcasing a style that owes as much to jazz guitarists like Herb Ellis and country guitarists like Hank Garland as it does to blues guitarists like Albert King and Albert Collins. Born and raised in Sacramento, King got his first lessons in blues from Sacramento Blues Hall of Famer Johnny “Guitar” Knox. He continued his blues guitar education under the mentorship of another Sacramento Blues Hall of Famer, Little Charle Baty, developing a style that would combine blues, jazz, and country guitar. From there he spent his formative years playing guitar for and recording with the late, great pianist Omar Shariff.\n\nPlaying with renowned Sacramento jump blues band The Chrome Addicts, King went on to win several Sacramento Area Music Awards (Sammies) including a Critic’s Choice Award for Outstanding Guitarist. After several national and international tours with the Chrome Addicts, he left the band to start his own group, Aaron King and the Imperials. In addition to playing with the Imperials he also toured with world-renowned boogie-woogie pianist Mitch Woods playing such prestigious festivals as the Montreal Jazz Festival and Umbria Jazz Festival.\n\nIn recent years, King has broadened his musical horizons through his association with highly respected Sacramento jazz bassist Harley White, Jr., blurring the lines between blues, jazz, funk, and even hip-hop in an effort to continue pushing the music forward in ways his predecessors did decades earlier with the electrification of blues- a radical notion at the time.\n\nDerek Washington\n\nInducted 2014\n\nDerek’s interest in music began at the age of four or five years as a radio kid who heard Bill Monroe and the Texas Playboys, Leadbelly, and Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup doing their hits of the day. At age seven he wanted to be a musician and began listening to music differently than before. He played drums and slide trombone in high school and played the ‘bone in both the marching band and concert band in undergraduate school. He was also listening hard and regularly to the blues on WLAC in Nashville, TN. Playing in school and listening to the blues on radio and at many blues gigs in his former home town sealed his blues fate. Along the way, he added variety – following Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Jimmy Smith, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, lots of great Rhythm & Blues artists and countless other musicians.\n\nDerek came to Sacramento in 1972 and his musical interest was strengthened when he joined forces with the founding group of the Sacramento Blues Society. He then served as President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Parliamentarian. He often was the Master of Ceremonies at SBS functions and states he has “provided my meager skills as a musician for a number of Blues Society benefits to aid in the advancement and presentation of the blues”.\n\nDerek began a side career as a radio broadcaster in 1988, with strong emphasis on blues programming with a little jazz added. He spent 12 years at KUOP-FM at the University of the Pacific, in Stockton, hosting “Trackin’ the Blues” and regularly advising the listeners of Blues Society events and featured artists around town. He continued seven years more after the station was absorbed by Capitol Public Radio at KXJZ-FM in Sacramento, but lost his ability to promote the Blues Society and local musicians and shows while there. Derek moved his “Trackin’ the Blues to KVMR-FM in Nevada City, CA seven years ago.\n\nJoe Lev\n\nInducted 2014\n\nMusic has been the unifying thread in Joe’s life. It has been his full time career as an adult. And blues has been right at the center of it all.\n\nHis first blues memory is, from the age of 10 or 12, when his folk-singing parents brought home copy of a record on Folkways called “Blues with Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGee”. It featured the three bluesmen being interviewed by the incomparable Studs Terkel and songs from all of them. He remembers Big Bill said “blues is something you live” and Studs said “Charlie Parker said if you don’t live it, it won’t come out of your horn.” Joe didn’t know what “it” was but he wanted “it”, wanted to live “it.” Since then he has strived to be a real one, and says it’s up to his peers and listeners to determine if he has fulfilled his mission.\n\nSince age 12, Joe had a long succession of teenage bands, first were surf bands with progressions just like blues. Joe says the Rolling Stones pointed his way to real blues. He was in his first “good band”, Buckwheat, right out of high school. It was definitely blues based, everything from Muddy Waters to Mose Allison.\n\nThe next 15 years found Joe playing in a succession of funk, rock and country cover bands and Nevada style show bands. In 1984 he got off the road and started playing with anyone that would allow him. This culminated in a nine year relationship with the newly formed Beer Dawgs with Bob Pearce.\n\nJoe left the Beer Dawgs in 1995 and his blues pursuit began in earnest. He booked two ongoing blues jam house band gigs; two a week at the old Torch Club with Mr. Johnny Nugget and one a week in Nevada City with B.B. and the Blue Jays. Soon he was getting the blues repertoire under his belt. All this lead to a tour with the great Frankie Lee among many other blues gigs. He still plays full time, all sorts of American roots music, but with a strong emphasis on the blues.\n\nHe has shared stages and studios with many local and a few national blues stars, and have been teaching bass and guitar for 15 years. The past five years Joe has been passing on his love of the blues to the many students involved in our Blues in the Schools program through performances and workshops. He also serves as an artist in residence at Rosemont and West Campus High Schools, passing his skills and love of the blues on to another generation.\n\nJan Kelley\n\nInducted 2014\n\nJan moved to Sacramento from Portland, OR in March, 1984 and worked for a law firm where one of the lawyers was a singer in a Blues band. He told her about the Sacramento Blues Festival in the fall and invited her to attend. She did and became a huge fan of the Blues.\n\nThe following year, Jan contacted Phil Givant and became one of his devoted volunteers, continuing to volunteer at the Blues Festival each year until its end in 1993. Charles Washington was leading the volunteers at the time and explained to Jan about the Sacramento Blues Society; she joined the Society and continued her volunteering for many of its events thru the years. She expanded her knowledge and love of the Blues, going to other shows and volunteering, and becoming acquainted with the local Blues bands and clubs.\n\nJan started contributing reviews of Blues festivals and other Blues shows for the SBS newsletter “Blue Notes” in 1994, later adding calendar information for events in the region. She has contributed many articles to it over time. In 2010, Jan became co-editor and continues in that function – working tirelessly to produce a blues newsletter the SBS can showcase.\n\nShe first became a SBS Board member in 2000 and 2001 as Secretary, all while undergoing treatments for Breast Cancer! At the time, there were only 4 Board members and no other volunteers. Jan then became President, starting weekly jams at a local club with all local bands, giving away cassettes/CDs to newly joining members, and with the good graces of Willie Brown, built up the membership and interest level for the SBS.\n\nMike Balma had been producing Blues shows that Jan attended, and when he started the series of Heritage Festival concerts, she joined his staff & continued to volunteer at most of his events for several years. She was one of the volunteer coordinators for Mike at his shows in the Camp Pollack area.\n\nWhen Jan left the SBS Board in 2003, she learned that the Sierra Blues Society, which encompassed a large area in the foothills around Sacramento, was in need of Board members to keep it a viable organization. She stayed on their Board for three years, but gravitated back to the Sacramento Blues Society to help them, becoming a Board member once again in 2011 as Parliamentarian, leading to Vice President and eventually President in 2013. During this time, she also solicited and arranged raffle prizes at events (which contribute to the general fund for SBS), served on various committees and volunteered in different capacities.\n\nJan has given the Blues Community the gift of her leadership skills, knowledge of Blues history, friendly relationships with well-known blues artists, charm, skill, and friendliness.\n\nMarshal Wilkerson\n\nInducted 2014\n\nMarshal began his singing career at an early age, singing for cookies in Shreveport, LA at the local market where his mother shopped. At about age 3, he learned “When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano” from the radio, and sang it over and over as his mother shopped. The shopkeeper was delighted in this small child singing about Capistrano and rewarded him with a cookie. As he requested a cookie every time he went into the shop, the shopkeeper would gather the shoppers and have Marshall sing before he got the cookie. At about 15, he set his sights on a classical career and took vocal lessons to compete in contests.\n\nSomewhere along the way, he discovered the blues, and the classical dreams no longer existed. He also began playing the guitar. Enlisting in the Air Force at 18, he sang with The Continentals which performed in the “Tops in Blue” show. After his service, he formed a duo and sang in the Los Angeles area.\n\nMarshall relocated from the Los Angeles area to Sacramento in the late 1980’s, and got involved in the local music scene while employed by the State of California. Although he had a “day job” his evenings were filled with music. In 1999, he formed the group Marshal Law. This was a very popular local band that represented the Sacramento Blues Society at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, TN in 2000.\n\nMarshal retired from his day job in 2001 and added more music to his life by attending jams and taking invitations to be a guest vocalist. In 2004 he joined, and is still with, the Sacramento Blues Review. When the band Marshal Law disbanded in 2005 he formed a new band, Smoked Sugar. Two years later he formed a blues trio called Mixed Drinks. The Sacramento Blues Revue was nominated for the SAMMIES in the Blues category in 2008, and they brought home the award. Marshall is proud of his vocal participation with the group and of this local recognition.\n\nPatrick Balcom aka ‘Ratatat’ Pat\n\nInducted 2013\n\nBorn and raised in Sacramento, California, Patrick started out with pots and pans but eventually got a snare drum and learned to read music from Mike Lawson. Pat’s father’s radio station job gave him access to the vinyl record vaults at KRAK and KCTC, so Pat began listening to every kind of music under the sun down at the radio stations and would take home recordings to learn on the drums. This allowed him to play with any style band due to his repertoire. In his teen years Pat wrote and played original music with The Azari Project (w/Leo Bootz), Blind Man’s Treat (w/Paul Relvas), Landfall and The Jinx.\n\nPat was in The Rhythm Method (w/Dave Garity) a 50’s and 60’s band in the late 1980’s, which took him to Sam’s Hof Brau that had blues seven nights a week. This is where Pat saw for the first time Johnny Heartsman, Arbess Williams, Johnny “Guitar” Knox, Gene Chambers, Lena Mosley, Big John Evans, Jimmy Smith, Mark Hummel, Rick Estrin and Omar (Sharriff) The Magnificent. Many of these musicians are in the SBS’ Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1991 Arbess started her own band with Pat as her drummer. She loved his drumming but couldn’t remember his name, so someone said it’s Pat, like Ratatat, and that’s how he’s been known since. ‘Ratatat’ Pat began working with and recording albums with his mentors Arbess Williams, Johnny Heartsman, Omar Sharriff and Johnny “Guitar” Knox.\n\n‘Ratatat’ is also well known in the Rock and Roll world; a life-long study of New Orleans roots music keeps this “Bluesman” playing Jazz, Cajon, Zydeco, Rock, Country and the Blues all around Northern California. Pat has played and recorded with a plethora of well-known blues musicians, always keeping the rhythm going. He can be seen in many blues bands in this area.\n\nLew Fratis\n\nInducted 2013\n\nBorn in Sacramento and raised in West Sacramento, Lew started playing professionally at an early age and by age 22 was on his own. In the mid-seventies, he did some stints in Los Angeles and then returned to Sacramento. Around 1989, Pat Balcom and Lew formed the Luminators and started playing at Sam’s Hof Brau and the Torch Club. Around the same time, they became Arbess Williams’ (HOF Inductee) back-up band and recorded her first CD. They also recorded with Omar Sharriff (HOF inductee) and contributed to the Sacramento Blues CDs.\n\nLew and Pat soon became one of the most popular bands in town and were able to record CDs of their own material. The Sacramento News and Review nominated the CD “Bright Idea” for Best CD of 1993. That same year, Lew was nominated for a Sammie for Best Blues Guitarist and The Luminators won for Best Blues Band. In 2009, he and his good friend Jimmy Pailer were selected to represent the Sacramento Blues Society in Memphis at the International Blues Competition. For the past several years, they both have been instructor/lecturer for the SBS’ Blues In The Schools program. Lew has played weekly at the Torch Club for 20 years and continues to entertain there.\n\nJim Monroe\n\nInducted 2013\n\nCalifornia born and raised, James Monroe learned to play piano by listening to such stalwarts as Johnnie Johnson (Chuck Berry’s piano player), the great Otis Spann, Floyd Dixon, Professor Longhair and others who would influence his playing. Although Jim has taken some music lessons over the years, he is primarily self-taught.\n\nThe Nate Shiner Blues Band was one of the leading blues groups in town in the late 60’s, early 70’s and Jim would play with Nate’s band for many years. He also learned quite a bit about playing the blues from Steve Samuels (HOF Inductee), performing in Steve’s band during the late seventies. Jim was an original member of Little Charlie and the Night Cats in the mid-seventies; during the early eighties Jim started his own group, the Bluescasters.\n\nThroughout Jim’s musical career he has backed some big name blues artists: Big Mama Thornton, Charlie Musselwhite, Luther Tucker, Lowell Fulson, Norton Buffalo and others at festivals and clubs. Jim also toured with the great blues pianist Floyd Dixon in the late seventies, as his bass player. Jim was also on tracks for the two blues CDs that recorded local performers in the Sacramento area. In 1991, he performed for a couple of years with Mark Hummel, then joined the Craig Horton band around 2003, playing in his band for years, followed by a tour with Joe Louis Walker in 2007.\n\nJim continues to play with Craig Horton at festivals as well as with local bands, such as Ray ‘Catfish’ Copeland (HOF inductee) and his band The Crawdaddies.\n\nJimmy Pailer\n\nInducted 2013\n\nHailing from St. Louis, Missouri, Jimmy played the Reno circuit between St. Louis and Reno before coming to Sacramento in 1989. His musical style is deeply rooted from Delta Blues, International Blues, and Rock and Roll, but as most blues musicians feel, Jimmy says blues is always incorporated into all his music.\n\nJimmy has played in a variety of local groups such as Funkengruven, and with Lew Fratis, Bruce Spencer, Stacie Eakes, Mick Martin, Arbess Williams, and many others. He went on to form his own group known as Jimmy Pailer and The Bad Boys, later forming The Prophets. Jimmy has had the opportunity to work with many musical greats such as Walter Trout, Tommy Castro, Chuck Berry, Bobby Vega, Leon Russell, Rare Earth, and Richie Hayward.\n\nIn 2009, he and Lew Fratis were selected to represent the Sacramento Blues Society in Memphis at the International Blues Competition.

In 1968, the group was asked to open for a touring blues act. The act was the legendary Muddy Waters Blues Band. This event led Nate to a life-long love of the blues and the nickname “Snakeboy” after Muddy’s guitarist Luther “Georgia Boy” “Snake” Johnson.\n\nIn the late 1970’s, the NSBB became the Sunland Blues Band; many of these players became HOF inductees. For ten years, Nate worked for Phil Givant (HOF inductee) and the Sacramento Blues Festival performing with his own band or backing others. He also produced videos of the festival using the equipment of Sacramento Public Access television.\n\nNate and a partner also opened The Grinding Stone (now Luna’s) on 16th Street and featured Steve Samuels, Johnny Knox and Mike Andrews as some of the acts who played there. The Grinding Stone featured some of the best artists in Sacramento at its monthly art shows and musicians from the Fifth String came in for Thursday night jam sessions. Nate also found time to do a blues radio show for KYDS public radio, started by the founders of KVMR in Nevada City. Rick Estrin, among others, played live at the station.\n\nIn 1984, Nate joined forces with vocalist/guitarist G.G. Amos and for the next ten years they toured as a duo and sometimes with a full band. After ten years, the duo split and GG formed GG and the Magic Band, touring extensively in the U.S. Nate joined as vocalist and played harmonica, lap slide guitar and keyboards. Nate and GG also coproduced the CD “Gots Ta Go”. Nate has an impressive discography too numerous to mention here.\n\nAfter five years, Nate returned to his blues roots with his group The Straight Ahead Blues Trio with drummer and long-time friend Tony Montanino and bassist Nick Doud, whose mother, Cathy “Detroit” Rae he soon fell in love with and married. Nate and Cathy currently reside in Texas and perform as the Snakeboy Shiners, with Cathy on drums and percussion.\n\nAl Arnett\n\n(1929 – 2012)\n\nInducted 2012\n\nFor more than 40 years, Al Arnett was the bass player of choice and an important part of the rhythm section which built the Sacramento blues scene.\n\nBorn in Georgia and raised in Cleveland, Al started playing guitar professionally in 1947, wearing a fake beard and mustache to disguise his age. In 1960, he switched to bass guitar and, as an Air Force serviceman, played in bands composed of the best military musicians. During his overseas tours, he worked bases in France and Japan, often playing 6-7 nights a week. In Japan, he met and worked with guitarist Gene Chambers (later to become a Sacramento resident and Sacramento Blues Hall of Famer) and they backed visiting stars, including Lou Rawls and Sam and Dave.\n\nIn 1972, he moved to Sacramento and, along with Gene Chambers and drummer Marshall “Soulman” Jones formed the core rhythm section for multiple Sacramento bands. Al typically worked in two or thee bands at a time for many years, some which endured for more than 20 years. Al played with the Dave Bonds Rhythm & Blues Band (considered for several years the top Sacramento band), the Blues Express, Blues Ambassadors, Soul of the Blues (Glenn Lane’s band), Nate Shiner Big Blues Revue, Bits and Pieces and many others.

Their Guitarist Steve Samuels helped Ray get going with some blues ba-sics.\n\nIn 1976, Ray formed a band called Quick-shake, where he met blues harmonica ace and guitarist Little Charlie Baty, who taught Ray all the correct chord forms for backing Charlie’s harmonica. Charles joined the band and the name soon changed to Little Charlie and the Nightcats. During the late 70´s Ray played with The Nate Shiner Blues Band and then got an opportunity through local blues promoter Phil Givant to go on tour with blues piano legend Floyd Dixon, followed by a short stint as guitar player for Mark St. Mary. In 1980 Ray was introduced to musician Johnny “Guitar” Knox (Hall of Fame inductee) and the band called The Blue Flames was formed. The Blue Flames performed in the area until 1999, even though Ray had left in 1985. During the next 10 years Ray managed a Tower Re-cords store in Sacramento and played occasionally at the Sacramento Blues Festival and a few local es-tablishments. Ray has performed on stage with blues notables Big Momma Thornton, Luther Tucker, Elvin Bishop, William Clark, Rod Piazza, Little Joe Blue, Buddy Ace, Johnny Heartsman, Little Charlie Baty, Rick Estrin, (Hall of Fame Inductees) Kenny “Blue” Ray and many other great musicians.\n\nCatfish and the Crawdaddies formed in 1995 and play a wide range of blues including Chicago, Texas, New Orleans, and West Coast styles, in addition to some old school Rock´n´Roll. They have been a popular attraction at the Sacramento Jazz Jubilee for the last 15 years and played several years at the world famous “Saloon” in San Francisco. Catfish and the Crawdaddies have released three self-produced recordings, for which they have received high reviews and numerous awards.\n\nMarshall “Soulman” Jones\n\nInducted 2012\n\nFor more than 30 years, Marshall Jones was the drummer of choice and an important part of the rhythm section which built the Sacramento blues scene. Born in Natchitoches, Louisiana, Marshall started drumming to accompany the country music he heard as a kid. After moving to Oakland in 1995, he met Johnny Heartsman (HOF inductee), his next door neighbor, and started playing blues. He began his professional career in 1959-60 with Johnny’s band and developed his skills in Bay Area nightclubs, backing visiting national artists and jamming.\n\nIn the ‘70s, he moved to Sacramento and met harmonica player Johnny Ayers, who introduced him to Dave Bonds, Al Arnett and Gene Chambers (HOF inductee). Together, they first formed the Dave Bonds Rhythm & Blues Band, which was the most popular Sacramento band at the time. They played the Sacramento Blues Festival and backed many visiting musicians, including Little Milton. After Bonds found religion and moved to Los Angeles, Al, Gene and Marshall stuck together and formed the core rhythm section for multiple Sacramento blues bands that have endured for more than 20years. He was the leader of The Blues Express and The Blues Ambassadors throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s and played with many other local bands such as Nate Shiner’s Big Blues Revue.\n\nMarshall played most of the Sacramento Blues Festivals and many of the Sacramento Heritage Festivals. He also recorded with the Blues Ambassadors and Glenn Lane.\n\nSteve Samuels\n\n(1946 – 2014)\n\nInducted 2012\n\nKnown as one of Sacramento’s best blues guitarists/ v o c a l i s t s , St e v e Samuels was an important contributor to Sacramento’s reputation as a blues town. Born without a left hand, his arm ended just below the elbow. Nevertheless, he utilized it like a one fingered wrist and picked a right hander’s guitar by holding it upside down and backwards.\n\nSteve grew up in Sacramento, started playing guitar at 17, discovered B.B.King and the blues at 19 and was a professional by age 20. In the late.60’s, Steve played guitar for Sacramento’s legendary blues band of exceptional local players, The Sunland Blues Band. In 1969, he sat in with The Muddy Waters’ Band for a gig in Berkeley and was invited back for Muddy’s gigs the next two days. In 1970, he started his own band, The Steve Samuels Blues Revue, and played regularly at many Sacramento area clubs, including Tootsie’s, Vangari’s, Melarkey’s and the Torch Club. He played nearly all of the Sacramento Blues Festivals as either a leader or sideman and his band was featured seven times from 1979-1989.\n\nSteve has released two excellent LPs. In 1985, he recorded On The Corner Of Blues And Swing, backed by former members of the Mighty Flyers Band, along with William Clarke, pianist David Fraser, his brother Andrew Samuels (of Sacramento country-rock band Redwing) and special guest, Sacramento vocalist Bobby “Blues” Ray. He wrote two of the cuts. In 1994, he recorded Saturday Night Blues, which also included David Fraser and William Clarke. He also backed Bobby “Blues” Ray on “Your Friends” which appears on the Sacramento Blues compilation CD.\n\nTorch Club / Texeira Family\n\nInducted 2012\n\nThe Torch Club was one of the first bars in Sacra-mento, established in 1934, the year prohibi-tion ended. Frank Texeira bought it in 1969, when it was origi-nally called The Tumble Inn. It had an upstairs sporting bar where pa-trons would place their bets on horse racing and the fights, and “ladies of the evening” were waiting for those who won. When the “fallen doves” didn’t have any busi-ness, they would come downstairs & sing torch songs at the piano located there. Thus it became known as “The Torch” although it is not known when the name officially changed.\n\nThere were also live jazz and lingerie shows held there, as well as a competitive art show that became so popular it was televised on the local TV stations. Frank was a gam-bler and fight manager who died in 1980 in Del Mar, where he had gone to retire. The slogan “known from Maine to Spain” became recognized in association with the Torch Club, which is attributed to the late Frank Texeira.\n\nLooking at the display cases and pictures on the walls at the Torch, one can realize the sense of what was past. Ron moved the club in1982 from its original location at 8th & L Street forsaking the last “watering hole for politicians” who took an easy stroll from dinner at Frank Fat’s to drinks at the Torch Club. It was at this time people came to the Torch Club partly for the jukebox that was known for its 45 records in addition to the socializing over drinks. Over the years, music was gradually added, first by a live DJ, and eventually bands, notably The Beer Dawgs, by Ronnie Texeira, Ron’s son. That’s when Sam’s Hof Brau on J Street closed and there weren’t any other blues clubs around.\n\nMarina Texeira, daughter of Ron, soon joined her father and brother and was instrumental in bringing in nationally known blues acts every day of the week. Their dad Ron passed away in May 2009. Since then, Marina has hosted various musical events for non-profit organizations and benefits at the Torch Club, always caring for the Blues Family at large. This club has continued to keep its jovial charm but has evolved into more than just a bar but also a community treasure. It is now going into its 12th year at the current location on 15th Street between I and J Streets.\n\nLena Mosley\n\nInducted 2011\n\nRaised in Alabama, Lena grew up singing gospel in her grandmother’s church. She moved to Sacramento with her family in 1966. In 1976, Gene Chambers heard Lena sing and encouraged her to sing the blues, taking her around town and introducing her to such influences as Johnny Heartsman, Arbess Williams, Johnny Knox and Mick Martin.\n\nLena performed regularly for many years with local bands before forming her own band, Lena Mosley and The Badd Shoes Blues Band,” When Mike Balma decided to record a CD entitled “The Sacramento Blues,” it featured 10 local blues bands that included Lena’s. All the groups on the recording then toured from Sacramento to Tahoe, San Francisco, Redding, stopping at many of the surrounding cities. The Rhythm and Blues Magazine interviewed and featured an article on Lena’s participation in the tour and the CD.\n\nLena’s performance with the Sacramento Blues Society events span many years, performing at Christmas parties, fund raisers, jam sessions and the Blues In The School program. Lena also brought the “Blues” to the CSUS Student Body, and her band regularly performed at the Sacramento Blues Festival during the many years that Phil Givant was the producer, leading to being asked by the Jazz Jubilee to perform on subsequent occasions.\n\nIn 2006, Lena joined “The Sacramento Blues Revue,” an eight person band, as the only female vocalist. Recently the group received a SAMMIE (Sacramento Area Music Award) for the “Best Blues Band,” recognizing the band as a prominent local act.\n\n“Big Mike” Balma\n\nInducted 2011\n\nFor more than 20 years, Mike Balma has contributed to Sacramento blues as a promoter and producer of blues festivals, concerts and shows and as an owner and producer of recordings by Sacramento blues musicians.\n\nMike volunteered for the Sacramento Blues Festival beginning in the 1980’s, eventually becoming a member of the executive staff, then went on to become President of the Sacramento Blues Society in 1992. Under his leadership with the SBS, there were 5 Blues in the Park concert series as well as the release of Sacramento Blues, a compilation CD of 16 Sacramento blues artists.\n\nMike is perhaps best known as the co-director of the Sacramento Heritage Festival, which was produced from 1994 to 2002 and sometimes drew over 10,000 attendees and featured many genres of music as an art form. From 1997 to 2011, Mike presented over 50 shows of multiple-themed acts in various venues, primarily the Sacramento Horsemen’s Association.\n\nSeveral benefit concerts were held to generate funds for musicians and their families and thousands of dollars-worth of musical instruments were donated to a variety of Sacramento area school music programs.\n\nDuring the past 20 years, Mike also produced blues programming for other Sacramento area musical programs, including the Rocklin Jubilee, Rainbow Festival, several SPCA Festivals, the Sacramento Downtown Concert Series and the Sacramento SAMMIES.\n\nOmar Sharriff “aka” David Alexander Elam\n\n(1938 – 2012)\n\nInducted 2011\n\nOmar was born David Alexander Elam in Shreveport, Louisiana and was raised in Marshall, Texas migrating to California in 1957 and settling in the Bay Area in the mid-60s. He recorded 3 LPs in 1968, 1972-73 and in 1975 he was rated the 3rd best piano player in the world by Contemporary Keyboard magazine (behind Ray Charles and Mose Allison).\n\nAfter the rise of disco and changing to his Muslim name, Omar saw his gigs limited and he sank into obscurity. He relocated to the Fresno area during the 1980’s and despite his distant location, Omar frequently gigged in Sacramento throughout the 80’s at Melarkeys, the Torch Club and the Palms Playhouse in Davis and was the house band for extended stays at Sam’s Hof Brau. In 1992, he moved to Sacramento and for the next 20 years had numerous appearances at Fulton’s Prime Rib and Jazzman’s in Old Sacramento.\n\nOmar appeared at all the major national blues festivals, including many times at San Francisco. He appeared at every Sacramento Blues Festival from 1976-1993 and every Sacramento Heritage Festival held from 1994-2005. Omar also toured nationally and internationally.\n\nOmar’s repertoire includes over 5000 songs and dozens of outstanding, edgy original compositions, many of which involve uncomfortable subjects and brutally honest lyrics. While in Sacramento, Omar recorded 3 CDs for the Have Mercy Label and his songs also appear on both Sacramento Blues compilation CDs. In 1993, his song “House Built By The Blues” was nominated for a Handy award and Sacramento Bee music critic David Barton called it “one of the best songs of any kind to come from a local songwriter” and Omar “one of the country’s best songwriters.”\n\nIn 2011, Omar returned to live as a honored musician in his hometown of Marshall, Texas at the request of the mayor, who declared the town “The Boogie Woogie Capital” upon Omar’s return.\n\nCharlie Baty\n\n(1953 – 2020)\n\nInducted 2010\n\nCharlie Baty was born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1953 and started playing harmonica during his high school days in Millbrae, California. While attending UC Berkeley in the early 1970’s, he picked up some harp pointers from Rick Estrin, who was already a veteran on the Bay Area Blues scene. After graduation, Charlie moved to Sacramento to land a job in state government. On the side, he formed Little Charlie and the Nightcats in 1975, named in deference to Little Walter’s first band. Charlie held down the harp position and began to explore the guitar.\n\nIn May 1976, Rick asked Charlie for work and moved to Sacramento. For about two years, their double harp attack was prominent but Charlie continued to woodshed, studying Christian recordings and honing his skills. He quickly became a guitar wizard and left the harp licks to Rick.\n\nCharlie is known for his acrobatic finger picking prowess and mastery of many musical styles, including jump, swing, surf, rockabilly, jazz and slow, gutbucket blues. He is considered among the very few best blues guitarists in the modern era and has been the namesake of the band that made Sacramento famous in the blues world.\n\nRick Estrin\n\nInducted 2010\n\nRick Estrin grew up in San Francisco and started playing harmonica in 1965 at age 16. After dropping out of high school, he roamed the streets near clubs in black neighborhoods soaking up the sounds inside and practicing his harp. His first professional job was opening, as sort of a white novelty act in a black band, at a Hunter’s Point bar. Soon he met bluesman Rodger Collins, who influenced him to develop an energetic stage routine.\n\nIn 1976, he moved to Sacramento and hooked up with Charlie Baty and his band, “Little Charlie & the Nightcats.” For a decade they gigged all over the Sacramento and Bay Area, playing clubs like Melarkey’s, Tootsie’s, Vangari’s and the Sacramento Blues Festival. In 1986, the band sent a tape to Alligator Records which immediately launched them into a non-stop touring routine that was to last 30 years. They released nine CDs and became Sacramento’s best-known contribution to the blues world, headlining festivals all over the world. Rick’s witty original tune, “My Next Ex-Wife” won the 1993 Blues Music Award for Song of the Year. After Charlie’s retirement, Rick formed Rick Estrin and the Nightcats, which continues to tour regularly, issue exciting music and represent Sacramento.\n\nIn the blues world, Rick is famous for his sharpdressed man look, his wry and thoughtful original songwriting, his unique harp tone reminiscent of the masters, and his soulful vocals.\n\nPhil Givant\n\n(?? – 2002)\n\nInducted 2010\n\nPHIL GIVANT was one of the seminal figures in Sacramento blues history and over a lifetime earned a national reputation as a blues expert. He was a mathematics professor at American River College for 41 years and a “blues professor” for nearly that long, teaching countless numbers of blues fans through his radio shows and festival productions from the mid-1970’s until his passing in 2002.\n\nPhil was a co-founder of the Sacramento Blues Society in 1979. It is said the first meeting was in the living room of his Carmichael home. Phil cofounded the Sacramento Blues Festival in 1976, one of the few major blues festivals in the nation at that time. He produced the annual festivals from 1976 to 1993.\n\nJohnny “GUITAR” Knox\n\n(1950 – 2016)\n\nInducted 2010\n\nBorn in Oakland, California in 1950, Johnny was the oldest child in a family led by Jack Knox, a local guitarist and former radio personality who had broadcast from his home as a teenager in the 1 9 4 0 ’ s . His dad encouraged him to learn music and he got his first guitar at the age of 14. Johnny moved to Sacramento to play the blues and while watching and playing with Little Charlie Baty and Rick Estrin, he started honing his skills in harmonica accompaniment. This prompted them to head down to Moon Studio to record their new 45’s. With Little Charlie and the Nightcats backing him in the studio, Johnny recorded the Muddy Waters classic “Honey Bee”, as well as Freddie King’s “Tore Down”, which Johnny re-released as a CD in 2010. Like many of his peers from that era, Johnny was no stranger to substance abuse issues, and went through a long spell where he would hit the streets daily with his guitar for his daily hustle. Through local musician Ray “Catfish” Copeland, Johnny met Mike Balma, local blues promoter/producer, at the Chicago Blues Fest ‘91, who soon booked studio time for a record. With a mix of solo tracks as well as additional tracks with backing by upright bassist Greg Roberts, Rick Estrin on harmonica, and Copeland on guitar, the record was released as “Johnny Guitar Knox, Hoboin’,” and won an award in Denmark!\n\nLocal guitarist Kenny Marchese sums it up nicely when he says “Johnny gave his help and support to the Sacramento blues scene by teaching and encouraging the younger players, and Sacramento has returned the favor by helping Johnny recover what he had tossed.”\n\nMick Martin\n\nInducted 2010\n\nMICK MARTIN has played blues harmonica professionally since 1968 and, since 1983, led “Mick Martin and the Blues Rockers.” Mick was an original co-founder of the Sacramento Blues Society, but had to rescind his presence due to conflicts of interest. He performed at Carnegie Hall for the nationally-broadcast “Blues in Jazz” concert with mentor Jimmy Smith, Jimmy Witherspoon, Grover Washington Jr., Carrie Smith and Mark Whitfield in 1994.\n\nMick shared the “Best West Coast Blues Harmonica Player” nod with Mark Hummel in 2001.

He is instantly recognizable by the way he used the volume control on his guitar to make his trademark moan. Born in San Fernando, California in 1937, Johnny started making records when he was 16 years old for Bob Geddins in Oakland in the 1950’s.\n\nJohnny played many instruments: the cello (his first instrument in high school), guitar, bass, piano and keyboards, organ, and blues flute. He was well respected while he toured in Europe and Japan.\n\nHe wrote, published, and recorded mostly his own music. His first hit was “Johnny’s House Party parts 1 and 2” in 1957. He has worked with Lowell Fulson, Tiny Powell, Al King, Joe Simon, Etta James, Jimmy McCracklin and many others. He received the Big Bill Broonzy award from the Academy of Jazz in France in 1990 for his album “Sacramento” which he recorded in Germany for CrossCut Records. Other albums (cds) include “Music of My Heart“, “The Touch” recorded at Alligator Records, and “Shine On” and “Still Shinin” recorded for Big Mike Balma in Sacramento. He also recorded albums with a group in Germany called Blues Company. He has influenced other musicians like Robert Cray and Joe Louis Walker. Johnny continued to be a versatile performer up to his death in Sacramento, CA in 1996.\n\nGene Chambers\n\n(1936 – 2008)\n\nInducted 2008\n\nGene Chambers was a longtime Sacramento blues musician, teacher and mentor had always cared deeply about the blues scene and blues musicians around our area.\n\nHe was born in September 1936 in a small town called Coffeyville, Kansas. He started playing blues with his first guitar in the Air Force while being stationed in Japan. From that time on, his love for playing the blues never ceased. He was in the off-duty legendry band called The House Rockers and the Sensations throughout his duty in Japan, traveling to many Airforce bases and entertaining servicemen and their families. After almost a decade stay in Japan, he returned to the US to Austin, Texas. Here he played with locally well known Joe Valentines Band until his retirement from the USAF. After settling in Sacramento, he formed The Bits and Pieces Band where he continued playing the blues. He truly enjoyed playing the blues while sharing his talents and expertise with young blues musicians in Sacramento area and helping to promote the Sacramento Blues Society.\n\nGene passed away in January, 2008 but his deep love of blues echoes today as seen in the Gene Chambers Musicians Crisis Fund which was established to help continue his deep concern and love for fellow blues musicians in a time of need.\n\nArbess Williams\n\nInducted 2008\n\nArbess has been singing since she was 15 years old and is still singing the blues today to inspire people from every way of life. Arbess started singing in her church in San Diego in her childhood, and then went on to singing the blues which she calls “deep down thing”. She sang at Tahoe while she had a barber job and also sang with Johnny Heartsman for quite a while “learning a lot” from him. Together they recorded, “I Just Want to Party All Night” for Mercy Me! Records. Her backup band for many years was a group from Sacramento known as The Luminators (Lew Fratis, Dave Garrity & Pat Balcom).\n\nToday “blues diva” Arbess is continuing to sing and “make a connection with people of all ages and backgrounds. Arbess states, “Blues was created here. It’s real American music —it’s spiritual and I like to sing to a mixture of people. Blues music is a universal language, and I like to have a little bit for everybody. (By Kimiko Chambers From Living Blues Magazine, No. 114, April 1994)"
