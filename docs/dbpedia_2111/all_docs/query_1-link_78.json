LONDON BUENS OATES & WASHBOURNE LTD. 28 ORCHARD ST., W. 1 8-10 PATERNOSTER ROW, E.C.4. A.ND AT MANCHESTER, BIRMINGHAM, AND GLASGOW 1921 7) PrmO PROOEMIUM TOTA admiratur tragicos tres terra poetas, Quos, Sophocles, inter sceptra secunda geris. Non tribus unus honos : fallit nisi fama, videtur Qui natus, idem laudis et esse gradus. Ingentes sculpit statuas pater Aeschylus : illis 5 Religio et priscus terror in ore sedet. Vix homo vix homini concessa hie audet, et ausus Arguitur coepto non minor ipse suo. Primum itaque, at non ut sit idoneus incola nostris Aedibus, obtinuit, dignior aede, locum. 10 Cui fama ignota est Euripidis ? Haud tamen una Huic auri species continuusve color. Omnibus, hie, titulis opus admirabile, Bacchas (Hujus et Hippolytus laus liber, hujus Ion) Scripsit : at ipse idem non pauca poemata panxit, 15 Quorum haud judicium fit nisi lege sua, Centum equidem versus ubi vix centusse liceri Vel re spectata vel ratione velim. Dexteritas certe sermonisque Atticus usus Ante oculos. At quid talia sola queunt ? 20 Sed tamen— idque inter rerum miracula pono— Vi propria quadam fabula tota valet. Fabula tota valet : securus judicat orbis, Tertiaque huic pleno jure corona cadit. Jure igitur, Sophocles (pia nee te lusit imago), 25 Jussisti indecorem sic sine flore chorum Ire tuum, ut dixit tibi nuntius advena : \" Vates Occidit, heu, Macedo, qui modo noster erat.\" Te tamen, o carum caput, o venerabile, quali Barbaricae cumulem munere laudis ego, 30 Cui pietas suadet coner, pater inclite, paucis Pandere sit musae gloria quanta tuae ? Sim brevis. Arctis ipse minus sic finibus errem, Sintque tibi a dictis damna minora meis. vi SOPHOCLEAN FRAGMENTS Haud in dramaticis vicibus decus est tibi primum, 35 Nee bene morata est fabula summus honos, Antigona Electraque licet stent pignora famae, Pinxeris et caecum, pinxeris, Oedipoda. Ordine res agitur. Nos te praeeunte timemus ? Et decet et legi est subditus ipse metus. 40 Compatimur ? Non cura caret ratione, potestque, Auctus eat quamvis, sobrius ire dolor. Saepe cies ventos, miris sed es usque serenus Ipse modis : salva proelia pace moves. Quidquid et humani scit tangere corda virorum 45 Non tantum in vita est : est et in arte tua. Ars immo vincit— modo fas sit dicere— vitam ; Ars dat enim cultum quod rude vita dabat. Haec inter venerum fastigia, magne, tuarum. Unus in his tecum par sociusque Maro. 50 Matronae rupta ceu circum colla catena Tota smaragdineo flumine fulget humus : Accurrunt pueri dispersaque gaudia cogunt Et filo nectunt ordine quodque suo : Sic tibi, sed pretiosa magis, fragmenta monili 55 Majori studium restituisse meum est. Arduus ille labos. Male si disjuncta rejungo (In peccata patent nam mihi mille viae), Ignoscas, pater alme : haec in discrimina tanta Et tuus— haud spernes— egit et artis amor. 60 PREFACE My Eurividean Fragments and Observaciones acerca de los ERRATA On p. vi, 1. 24, for \" peccata \" read \"peccanda.\" On p. 36, 1. 23, and on p. 37, 1. 4, for MsveXsco read MsvsXew, and on p. 37, 1. 13, for MsveXeto read MevsXsw. I suggest however that in Attic proper the nominative MsvsXeooc (standing, by metathesis, for MeveX-yjfoc;) must have had a genitive MsvsXeco (standing, by metathesis, for MevsXyj^bu) and a dative MsveXsw (standing, by correption, not by metathesis, for MevsXqfco). On p. 119, 1. 27, for 7i;pcoT(ovy)0' read 7rpcoTovy)0'. Sophoclean Fragments. Jebb's brilliance is the admiration of scholars and his services to learning are incontestable ; but, for all that, I cannot— it may be my misfortune— quite say of him, as Henry the Eighth, in his happier days, said of Colet : \" This is the doctor for me ! \" Neither, indeed, do I follow Nauck blindly ; but my detestation of the pseudo-science of Germany is a reasoned detestation, extending in no way to the splendid achievement of such giants as Dindorf , as Meineke, or (though he be of lesser stature) as Nauck himself. viii SOPHOCLEAN FRAGMENTS The emendation of the Fragments of Sophocles differs not a little from the emendation of the Fragments of Aeschylus and Euripides. Those two authors, however divergent otherwise, agree at least in this : they both write, though in separate styles, with extreme straight- forwardness and simplicity. As a consequence, in a highly corrupt Fragment— and the Fragments of all three tragedians are far more corrupt, as a rule, than are their extant plays— the kind of language that has been replaced by some distortion can usually (at any rate if that dis- tortion extend but to the space of a word or two) be inferred with adequate security from the undisturbed context, and, the metre being known, the ductus liter arum serves sufficiently to show which of only a few probable ways of saying the same predictable thing was, as a matter of fact, preferred and employed by the poet. Now I do not mean to say that this is not, in large measure, true of Sophocles' Fragments also : were it not. the scientific emendation of them would be a matter of sheer impossibility. But there exists a vast difference of degree. Sophocles constantly introduces what I can best describe as colour : precisely what he says— not merely how he says it— in the middle of a sentence is by no means always securely ascertainable either from the beginning and end of that sentence or from the more extended context. He is almost as likely as not to throw in colons gratia some touch or other without either previous preparation or subsequent allusion. His employ- ment of ye, in particular, is frequently of this character, while his practice includes many ramifications of a nature far less simple. In cases of Sophoclean corruption the corrector's one safe course is to pay the minutest attention —in the spirit, often, rather than in the letter— to the usage of the poet himself. If he do this, he will find from time to time that a restoration conceived, not in virtue of any reliance on the light of nature, but as a result of a study of Sophocles' especial predilections, will accord so closely — though by no means entirely — with the indications of the ductus that, having got thus far, he is able both to modify it, without undue violence, into a reading in full agreement with those indications and pari passu to produce a result that has every appearance of PREFACE ix authenticity. More he cannot do : to do even that is extremely difficult. Fortunately there remain over a multitude of passages that, usually as a consequence of the ductus being conclusive, present none but easy problems. As in my Euripidean Fragments, so here also I adopt a quadripartite division into \" Papers,\" the first three ' Papers \" in this case corresponding to the volumes of Pearson's work.

We should probably here adopt the ms. reading : aocpol Tupavvot, tv) aocptov fxsTouaia. Of two other ms. readings, one, viz. <ro<poi Tupavvot, tcov ao<pcov auvouo-ia, is, it would seem, to be assigned to Euripides, and, in particular, to the first edition of his Archelaus. I discuss the matter in my Macedonian Tetralogy (pp. 123, 124). Fr. 15. See my Macedonian Tetralogy (p. 124). Fr. 16. Unemended text : xal re£a xal <popjjuxTa.

Though elsewhere the adjective tc^o? and the adverb to£9j are used of diction which, while unmusical, is at the same time, it would seem, metrical, nevertheless to speak of hymns as pedestrian would (inasmuch as, even if unaccom- panied by the lyre, they are sung, not said) be far more violent. I incline, though with hesitation, to suppose that it is the pan-pipe that is being contrasted with the lyre and to read : xafrcsfrc xal cpopinxTa, goat-foot songs and songs to the music of the lyre. For an adjective afrcs^o? compare, on the one hand, abroXo?, as also the aX- compounds in the Ichneutae, and, on the other, dbYuP6TOto and stefo. If this suggestion happens to be sound, there are possibly other passages to which it may have an application. But it must be understood that I am here myself speaking with extreme tentative- ness. Aegeus. Fr. 20. In 1. 2 follow Liddell and Scott in reading ^Xotas, and adopt Casaubon's uaicov.

In 1. 3 I imagine A— IX 3 that 7rpcoTa, Ssu-spav was written simply as afi. For Ssuxepav vojj.<ov (as second share) perhaps Seuxspov vsjxwv would be possible : but I hesitate to assign to ve[ag<; a meaning other than that of glade or the like, and, besides, a feminine Seuxcpav is, in view of x6v avxwrXsupov xtjtcov, desirable for the sake of clarity : this latter considera- tion militates equally against my suggesting an other- wise acceptable Seuxspov vopicov. I wonder, by the way, whether the distinction between voixoc, and vojxo? is anything better than a grammatical figment. Principle seems to demand v6fxo<; equally in both cases. I would observe that on the Alexandrian system v6\\xoc, admitted of being written either as vo\\xoc, or as vo^o? (barytone, not oxytone) : it may be this vofio?, adopted by way of graphic distinction, but not as indicating a difference of pronunciation, that has given rise to our vo\\xoc„ vo(j.ou. Similarly, I suggest that the traditional, but impossible, Xpv)ax(ov, of debtors, is merely a depravation of ^pyjoxcov (=^py](7Tcov), so written in order to distinguish it graphi- cally, but graphically only, from ^pyjcxaiv, of good men. In many medieval manuscripts no attempt whatever is normally made to differentiate, in writing, the acute and the grave accent. In 1. 6 the apparently correct spelling, Zxtpoovo?, seems first to have been proposed by Nauck. Aegisthus. I have no comment to offer, except that it seems to me that the Aegisthus sive Clytemnestra, the Electra, and the Erigone must surely constitute a connected trilogy very similar to Aeschylus' Orestia (see my remarks under the headings Erigone and Clytemnestra). Aethiopes. Fr. 29. In 1. 2 read, with Dindorf, xsXatvoppivs<; for xeXaavopivec. Aechmalotides . See my edition of the Ichneutae (especially p. 513 ; but correct, in the light of my note on Fr. 44 below, the emendation which I there propose). I am more than inclined to think that Hartung is right in identifying Fr. 38 with Fr. 730 : if so, it follows, as he sees, that b2 4 SOPHOCLEAN FRAGMENTS Aechmalotides and Chryses are only two names for one play. The language of the Frr. of the Chryses resembles that of the Frr. of the Aechmalotides. Fr. 35. The ^iXiySoc; of the mss. is right. A mould is often made in two halves, that are put together ; and a half-mould, rather than a mould as a whole, resem- bles a shield. Moreover, it is only in the case of a mould in two halves that holes would be required : into a mould in one piece (which could only be used once) liquid wax would have to be poured, whereas into a mould in halves semi-solid wax would be introduced, the super-plus of which, when the two halves were pressed together, would require apertures through which to be forced out. Fr. 38. Unemended text : xal pwfnatov sajnxpa? Xa(3cov. Read : xal ^oofxiaZov lcryjxpa<; Xaf^v Xa(3cov. Compare Biblical references to the horn of the altar. Hartung, I rather think rightly, identifies this Fr. with Fr. 730 (from the Chryses : that the two plays are one and the same seems— see above— probable). Fr. 40. Unemended text : tocuttjv syw, KiXXav ts xal Xpu(JY)v. Read : Taor/jv lyw KiXXav iz xal Xpuerqv tayj. Fr. 42. Unemended text : garciaa (3aia<; xuXixo? cdctts Ssufspa.

A very simple emendation (which I have weighed carefully in my mind) would be : 7iaT7]p 8' sypT) 'aSv? afzcpt&etv a xpouicaXa. It is, in my opinion, ruled out of court by the consideration that syp-yj could scarcely pass into sypu. Though ■/) and simple u acquired an identical pronunciation, yet in the later vernacular proper, as written, it would seem that the letter u was but seldom— if indeed ever— employed except as the second element of a diphthong (with an entire change of pronun- ciation : au= Italian af or av ; su= Italian ef or ev ; ou, contrariwise, = Italian u, not Italian of nor ov). being normally replaced, in all other cases, by i, •/]. et, or oi. Consequently it is only with the utmost rarity that u figures by way of corruption in our classical texts, except when it so figures as the second element of a diphthong. I therefore read : toxttjp 8s 8pu<; Su^, dfxcpiXyjva xpou7raXa. A— IX 5 And the sire having put on his woodens, the clogs that he wore about the vat. xpoure&u or xpouracXa were wooden clogs, used inter alia for treading olives. Hence a^iXvjva [used about the vat) is fully appropriate. Spu? is simply a poetical substitute for £uXa, which may be employed to connote any, or almost any, articles made of wood. Campbell actually (but together with other and wrong alterations) proposed afxcpiXvjva, though in the sense wool- enwreathed (an impossible sense : Xyjvo?, wool, is a neuter substantive of the third declension and would yield a^iA^vfe, not a[x<piX7)vo<;). Formerly I myself, but erroneously, suggested Xpucrout; for ^pucjSuc. Fr. 47. On the evidence the ms. cdyj^zxoc, seems correct. In the Etymologicum Magnum (41, 3) read atx(i.68sTo<; for cdr/jxokzxoq.

The slight shifting, rather in environment than in sense proper, of the Homeric alcra appears to me so Sophoclean that I propose this emendation with some confidence. It exhibits the kind of consideration that an emend er of Sophocles has con- stantly to keep before his eyes : the mental criticism involved is delicate and often difficult. Fr. 88.

The expression ic, xs xdptpaxa xal izpoc, y* ^ a(3axa seems to me typical of the almost meticulous precision which, attained by means of a minimum of verbal mechanism, it is characteristic of Sophocles to affect : translate not only into all accessible places, but also to the verge, at least, of some that are beyond the possibility of access. Gdxotcrtv in 1. 3 is an apparently certain conjecture of Ellendt's : why it has not been currently accepted I am at a loss to understand. For the spelling crootSs? (as against croooSs? or crow 8s?) in 1. 9 see my edition of the Ichneutae (pp. 141, 142, 144, 145). The substitution of 9osxat (1. 4) and 90VXS?

See my edition of the Ichneuiae (pp. 611, 612), but subject to a highly important correction. I am now sufficiently convinced that Sophocles— many Greeks were decent men— would not have dreamed of writing the outrageous stuff which is currently supposed to have formed the staple of this play. Chiron then can have had nothing to do with it. When the Satyrs fell in love with Achilles was ivhen he was disguised as a woman. The action may have been unsavoury (though, in view of the Ichneutae, I doubt even that), but there is no ground for thinking that it was worse. The known characters fit in with this view, and Fr. 153 does not make against it (some scholiasts will imagine any beastliness) : Fr. 156 makes strongly in its favour. Quite possibly the hound (see Fr. 154) was brought to scent its master out. Fr. 149.

Editors have dealt with 11. 6 and 7 on the assumption that boys, when snow-balling, find after a while the snow-balls freezing hard to their hands, so that they have difficulty in dropping them ! Were editors never boys themselves ? On this basis, which, to speak plainly, is ridiculous, they build for themselves a simultaneity of opposite tendencies, such as to justify the Spav xal to [at] Spav of the last line : but the simultaneity is non-existent, and, if Sophocles ex- pressed himself intelligibly, he wrote Spav xaxa y.ri Spav.

Fr. 207. In spite of the second hand's touti (1. 4) in correction of the first hand's touto, this papyrus Fr. is, I think, rightly assigned to the Eurypylus, and does not belong, as has been suggested, to the Ichneutae. Lines 5-7 are in a much shorter metre than 11. 1-4. At no place in the Ichneutae, where either demonstrably or probably such a change of metre occurs, will the remains of the seven lines of the Fr. fit in : so comparatively well preserved a Fr. can scarcely come from the lost portion of that play. Hunt evidently inclines to fear that somehow or other the Frr. of the two dramas have been mixed up together : on the evidence, such as it is, of their contents I am disposed to think the}7 have not been mixed up. But in the Eurypylus the second hand would not substitute toutE for touto, unless he had come fairly fresh from the correction of a Satyric drama : in other words the Ichneutae preceded the Eurypylus. This con- sideration strengthens my contention (see p. 172 of my edition of the Ichneutae) that the papyrus title of the Ichneutae was the Efipeau; Aupa?, with or without the addition y) 'I^eutou.

Scholars have gone singularly astray in their attempts to combine Plutarch and the papyrus.

I have no remarks to offer. A— IX 15 Hercules. See my edition of the Ichneutae (pp. 608, 609), where, inter alia, I agree with Wagner and Dindorf that no Heracleiscus, but only the Hercules (i.q. Epitaenarii), ever existed, and that consequently the two quotations (Frr. 228, 229) from the alleged former should be assigned to the latter. Fr. 230.

I take it almost for granted that the Clyiemnestra (identical with the Aegisthus), the Electra, and the Erigone (dealing with the trial of Orestes) constituted a connected trilogy : it would be more than rash to infer from Dioscorides' epitaph on Sophocles (Anth. Pal. vii. 37) that the appurtenant fourth play of the SiSacrxocXta was strictly Satyric, or that Electra was a character in it. Fr. 236. Erotian's text represents this Fr. as occurring Iv o-^piyovv) of Sophocles. I can hardly read this otherwise than as ev 'OfxTjpixtov •/)', in the eighth of the Homeric plays. In the Fr. itself I find confirmation. The unemended text runs : vov 8' stp-yj O7ro<ppo<; s£ ocutcov etoi; | aTTcoXscev ts xocuto? e^arccoXsTo.

This couplet is in thought and language a conflation of three passages in the Odyssey (it can have nothing to do with Sophocles' Erigone), viz. xii. 1. 194 (cxppucrt vsucrra^cov), xii. 11. 245, 246 (Tocppa Se (xot, SxuXXtj xoiXt)<; ex v-qbc, sTaipou? | s£ !Xs0'), and xxiii. 11. 67, 68 (auTap 'OSutTtrsix; | coXscis ttjXou v6<7tov ' AyjxdBoq, coXsto o° ixuxoq). For uTcocppog and unoLcppoc, (both, I take it, corruptions of uTcotppuc;) see Pearson's note. The misapplication of the 6<ppucu veuaTa^cov incident and the allegation that Ulysses himself 16 SOPHOCLEAN FRAGMENTS perished— clearly shortly after passing Scylla— show that a garbled version of the facts is being intentionally put by Sophocles in the mouth of some relater : that the relater is not one of the crew is sufficiently proved by the auxwv of e^ aurcov. I can only imagine that Tele- gonus, or perhaps one of his companions, is the speaker, and that when Telegonus landed in Ithaca he was under the impression that his father, Ulysses, had not survived his voyage from Circe's island. If so, he must, it would seem, have obtained his false, but in detail not unin- formed, version of the facts from Circe herself, who in her turn received it, I suggest (for no other fallible eyewitnesses appear possible), either from Scylla in person or from the more benign Crataeis. Be that as it may, I attribute the couplet with confidence to the Ulysses Acanthoplex. As to Sophocles' Homerica, see my remarks on that play and on the Nausicaa. Thamyras. Fr. 238, 1. 1.

Pearson says : \"A tragedy by Sophocles entitled Iocasta is of course incredible.\" I agree to the extent of denying the moral possibility that Sophocles can have written any tragedy reasonably patient of a title Jocasta in addition to the Oedipus Tyrannus : that tragedy indeed might perhaps be referred to under the name in question ; but in any case the quotation is not from the Oedipus Tyrannus. What, however, of a Satyric drama ? I am disposed to suggest that, rather than without evidence assume corruption, we ought to interpret the Lexicon Messanense as intending by Sophocles' Jocasta Sophocles' Satyric Cnops (see later under the heading Cnops).

Now oiovsi, exempli gratia (even in classical times the si in such expressions is beginning to lose its conditional force), yields excellent sense in the context. Musurus emended lovt to \"Iom ; Dindorf proposed OivsT and M. Schmidt Zivgm, both of these latter suggestions involving a misunderstanding of oiovst.

We thus arrive at ai& vyj.

I take it that the ' Spider \" is the Sphinx. In addition to meaning spider (for which sense see Dindorf 's Stephanus rather than Liddell and Scott), xvco^ is said to mean blind. I wonder whether this alleged sense arises from a misapprehension on the part of some student, with the root of xve9<x<; in his mind and aware of the position of this drama in the tetralogy relating to the blind Oedipus, but not aware of much else about it. On the other hand there is doubtless a possibility that the Kvdoi{> of the title really means The Blind Man, not The Spider. It by no means necessarily follows from Dioscorides' epitaph on Sophocles (.4 nth. Pal. vn. 37) that Antigone— impossible in connexion with the Sphinx— was a character in the play. I would go a long way to avoid the necessity of dis- cussing the topic which I here approach. Though I am about to clench the argument, as to the tetralogy, con- tained in my edition of the Ichneutae, yet I am about to do so at a risk which I am far from relishing. The cursory reader— nay, if there be such a thing, the cursory re- viewer—will, I fear, set me down as a sort of \" Baconian \" bedlamite.

This acrostic is mutilated indeed, but not to such an extent as to render it unintelligible. It runs, mutilations included, and with- out any attempt at emendation, thus (iota diphthongs evidently rank as single letters) : C. O, O, 0, EI. T, A, EI, n, EI, H, T, A, A, Q, A, 01, Q, II, O, E, II, T, A, K, N, O, Y. In the pre-Euclidean spelling (as regards vowels) this would be : C, O, $, O, EI, T, A, EI, II, EI, E, T, A, O, A, 01, O, n, O, E, II, T, A, K, N, O, Y. That is to say : SocpostrXsi (clearly a distortion of SoqjoxXsi) 7T£iy)Ta (similarly a distortion of noirfia.) oaoio (see what I have to say later) iza (doubtless, in view of the following context, the last two letters of OiSforto) \"Etttoc KvcovJ;. Such, as it stands, uncorrected and incomplete, is the single acrostic. A few slight corrections are all that is m— X 25 needed to restore it in its completeness. But, as one effects these alterations, one becomes aware of the exist- ence of a second — this time a terminal — acrostic : in other words, a double acrostic is revealed.

Translate : \" Composed by Sophocles, aetat. 81, the two Oedipi, the Seven, the Spider.\" Both before and after the numerical expression the acrostician, not unnaturally, dispenses with elision. How much cutting about of the original text was necessary for the interpolation of this acrostic we cannot determine. It seems, however, on the evidence, fairly clear that 1. 46 was inserted bodily. Personally. I hold that 1. 40 was similarly inserted and that consequently in 1. 39 xi 8', & is original. Sophocles probably wrote : tl 8', <i> ToeXou/ppov, el t<x8' ev toutoi^, eyco ; The alterations may conceivably be very extensive, seeing that it is not impossible (so, at least, it would appear) for the first upright, at any rate, to have been worked in as early as the fourth century B.C., when doubtless there still existed persons capable of producing a colourable imitation of the Sophoclean style.

Heraclides Ponticus took the ascription on trust and in an original composition of his own quoted certain statements in the book as the evidence of Sophocles. Dionysius, observing this, communicated the real facts to Heraclides. He however took up an attitude of negation and incredulity, whereupon Dionysius wrote telling him to look at the IQ— X 27 acrostic-upright My flame is Pancalus : now Pancalus was a favourite of Dionysius'. Heraclides being still incredulous and maintaining the possibility of the presence of the upright being due to fortuitous coincidence, Dio- nysius sent him in reply yet a third letter, saying ' You will find in addition For the old ape the trap is set in vain : Nay, but wait long enough, and ev'n tti old ape is ta'en, and furthermore To Heraclides letters be unknowe.' Heraclides subsided in confusion.\" Diogenes does not make it plain whether those who substituted Spintharus for Dionysius substituted him only as author of the Parthenopaeus or throughout the whole episode : I suppose the latter is what he really means. From what we know of Heraclides Ponticus, a pupil of Plato, of Speusippus, and of Aristotle, it is not inconceivable that he may have lived on even to some such date as 305 B.C. It is equally conceivable that at or before that date Dionysius 6 [A£Ta6sfi.s:voc, a pupil of Heraclides Ponticus himself (so it is said), of Alexinus, of Menedemus, and of Zeno, may already have been of competent age, not merely to attend lectures, but also to compose a tragedy. The possible margin of time is small, but still there is a possible margin. Spintharus is ridiculed in Aristophanes' Aves : neither is he, chronologically, out of the question, though he cannot have lived to see Heraclides a really old man (it is doubtful what stress should be laid on the yspcov of yspwv 7u6y]xoc;). I am myself inclined to accept the account as true of Dionysius, and to suppose that by some Spintharus' name was substituted partly because of the patent — though, perhaps, not even serious — difficulty presented by the conjunction of representatives of two different periods and partly because, Dionysius once out of the way, Heraclides' fellow-Heracliot, Spintharus, was the most obvious person to put in his place. In any case the tragic KapaaTt/tSe? in question seem to date back to the fourth century B.C. The only other fully relevant use of the 7capaorixC? known to me is its em- ployment by, or by the copyists of, Ennius : Cicero tells us (De Divinatione n. 112) that the words Q. Ennius fecit were presented in quibusdam Ennianis. Plautine Arguments are not quite analogous. For a single acrostic— unconcerned with authorship or tetralogical 28 SOPHOCLEAN FRAGMENTS content— interpolated in Euripides' Ion see the end of Paper IV. A serious complication arises from the fact that we have not now the acrostical lines in their first acrostical form. The acrostic was once a single acrostic only. The final upright exhibits a different, and quite obviously later, method of treating compound vowel-signs. With it I will now deal. It runs, disregarding iotas \" subscript \" entirely and in the case of diphthongs taking in the last element only, thus : N, A, I, A, O, N, E, E, N, I, C, I, C, A, I, C, O, C, I, C, N, A, N, N, E, A, N. This means: Naia* cb vs7]vt,<;. loot.' icrtoen?. vav vsav. Observe that here also the vocalisation is pre-Euclidean : axonti, with its impure diphthong, is twice treated as EKOIIE. The scansion clearly is: Na\"* <i> j v£7)|vi<;. la'' j iaoi\\cn<;. vav vsav | . On this, as translation is hardly indicated, I would take occasion to remark that Nai-dc or Nai' is manifestly the vocative of Naidc?, and that phrases can easily be imagined (such as W lax, yev/jTai ) in which laa could fairly be equated with fowct?. But it is more necessary to direct attention to the extreme difficulty of framing in Greek any kind of final acrostic. The letters permitted by the rules of the language to end words are far from sufficient to render the composition of final acrostics even tolerably easy. This consideration— and it is most important— weighs greatly in the direction of inducing me to believe that this particular final acrostic is not factitious. But, given the final acrostic, it must clearly be con- nected in some way or other with the initial acrostic. That means, seeing that neither Nat.dc, laa., nor vav occurs in the extant Oedipodean trilogy (eE7TTa obviously ='Avtl- yov7)),that they must have been all three presented in the Cnops Satyrica. Hence the following three Fragments : Fr. 335b. Nock*. Fr. 335c. laa.. Fr. 335d. vav (mss. vvv). To these, as coming from the Cnops, should apparently be added a fourth Fragment, namely Fr. 733 (q.v., to- gether with my remarks thereon, in its numerical order later in this book), and possibly also a fifth Fragment, IQ-X 29 namely Fr. 297, which (under the heading Iobates) I have already discussed.

Whether itsfjuptJ\" means smoke (from the skin) as Galen, though with doubt on his own part, seems to have thought, is gravely questionable. Galen, one of the sanest of thinkers and a scholar— in addition to his other qualifications —of no mean merit, is an authority of most excep- tional weight ; but, still, something like radiance appears a more natural signification in the almost certain context.

To emend, with Pearson, utojxvu? to £7ro[xvu<; (I agree that u7iofxvu? is, apart from the matter of the aorist infinitive, next door to impossible) is to ignore the consideration that in the orthography of the copyists the letter u, except in diphthongs, is, to use Mendelian language, a recessive factor.

One of my own private maxims, in the case of a recalcitrant corruption, is to consider whether the original had not a u in it, which has been changed into some other letter. Fr. 342.

The forms fxaTa^stv and acpaS^stv are, at least in Attic, impossible : one must choose between [i,aTou£siv and CT9a8ou£siv, from jxaxat^siv, crcpaSat^Eiv, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, [ioltolCziv and c<pa8a£siv, without i, and therefore without contraction ; {xairat^siv and a<pa8a- t£siv would yield, not jjt.aTa£siv, a<pa8a£av, but [xaTyj^eiv, crcpa$7&sivl With these two verbs we ought doubtless to group the \" pure \" xepai^av. Similarly— I suggest— we ought to employ, instead of Ttfxa?, ti[aSc, the spelling Ttfxat?, Ttfjiat : here the reason why we do not have tiy^q, Tifxyj, as also an infinitive Tipjv, etc., is that the a suffered ante- vocalic correption before contraction took place ; when ultimately Tifxaetv (with impure diphthong) etc. became rtjxav etc., the Attic law of etacism had already ceased to operate. Yet, as late Greek, Tt,[i.a<; and Ttjza cannot be impugned : the late Greek pronunciation of a and of a is that of (Italian) a, whereas, on the same system, at has the sound of (Italian) e. iPW and tne handful of similar verbs present a complication. In these cases the yj seems to be strictly original. I take the inherited present indicative to have been : (a) xpvjfco, xpvjw, XP™, XP&, (b) xri/*K, XPfaCi XPTfo (c) XPhfai XPfa, XP% (d) XPVeTov, xp-yjSTOv, in— x 31 Xp5]TOV, (e) xpvjfofxev, xpeco^v, (/) xpfy^e, XPW£, MWei (9') Xp-hFwzi, XP^wvTt, xpswcjt, (/*) XP^fo^ai, xpew[xai, (i) xp^n, XPWh XP% XP7)> (&) XP^\"6™1, XP?)£™, XP^ai, (?) xp-/)f£cr0ov, Xp7)£-T0ov, xpvjaOov, (m) xp^fofjisOa, xpsw[xs6a, (rc) xp^feaOs, Xp7]£C70£, xP^^s, (o) xP^Fovxat, xpstovTou. Now the forms exhibiting Attic metathesis as a result of the combination -7]Fo- (wz. xP\">>fA£v, ypioiai, xp£W[xai, xpsw^Qa, xpswvrai) are — c/. paaiXTJfb?, pacnXsw? — pre-eminently patient of synizesis, but are not, by law, capable of contraction. But is this perhaps a purely graphic point ? Did the ordinary Athenian pronounce (SaaiXeox; as (3amXo5<;, and was the spelling (3a<riXeco^ kept alive by a merely literary tradition ? If so, one need not wonder at xpw(j.sv, yp&ai, Xpwfxoa, xpw[xe0a, xP&vxou : no grammarian o/ ^4^tc times could possibly have fathomed the historical origin of the forms. Cf. Fr. 848. Creusa. Fr. 353.

I therefore infer that Sophocles equipped two IQ.—X 35 distinct dramas with a Chorus of Lemnian women. To use the word Tzpotipcac,, Stephanus must have had some acquaintance, direct or indirect, with the Sophoclean didascaliae : that is a fact to be in this place noted only ; but it has its own bearings.

See my edition of the Ichneutae, p. 615, but in the light of what I here add under the heading Frr. 419-423 b. Frr. 419-423. Hesychius attributes these five Frr. as follows : Fr. 419, fj.totj.tov &<; 2ocpoxX9j<; (Soping emends to <x>c, Eo<po>cX%M<o(i<j>), Fr. 420, SocpoxXTJ^Mtofj-tp, Fr. 421, SocpoxXYJ? fj.tofj.to (note the accent, which may be either a true circumflex or else a mark of contraction), Fr. 422, SocpoxXr]^ xtofj-to (Joseph Hill emended to Mto(j.to), and Fr. 423 (which consists apparently of the one word aTOxoAous), SocpoxXvj? Mtofxtp. But, as regards Fr. 423, we read in Bekker's Anecdota (435. 25) : SocpoxXyjc; 8s to dbtoxoXous sv MsvsXatp (see also my note, below, on Fr. 423 b). I infer that fj.tofj.tp and fj.tofj.to (as also fj.tofj.tov dx;, a mistake for fj.tofj.tovto) are contracted ways of writing MsvsXatp (or MsvsXstp) Msfi.ovcofj.svoi, \" in the Deserted Menelaus .\" Late Greek by no means rejected the duplication of identical contractions that did not stand for identical uncontracted words : cf. the established schismatical symbol $ (a double cp), which means Ocotio? 6 cpomCtov, Photius the Illuminator. For the existence — in which I disbelieve— of a Sophoclean play called the Momus there is no other evidence. For Frr. 421 and 423 see also my edition of the Ichneutae (p. 615). Fr. 423 B. A character in this Sophoclean play seems to have been an Achaean soldier ('A^aio*;), who appears to have spoken the prologue. A misunderstanding of the record has resulted in the modern invention of a Momus by Achaeus the tragedian and in the cataloguing as Fr. 29 of Achaeus of a passage which, as Fr. 390 B, I here restore to Sophocles. In Aristophanes' Vespae (1. 1081) we find : suOeox; yap £x8pafi.6vTS<; auv Sopl ouv ao-mSi. Similarly in his Pax (1. 357) we find : he, Auxaov xax Auxstou auv Sopl ouv aa7u8i. Now Choeroboscus IQ— X 37 remarks (In Theodos. p. 376, 18) : to guv Sopsi cruv dcrmSi, oTcep 'ApioTocpavT)? 7rapE[xcpoav£t (Nauck rightly alters to 7rapevu9atvei.) ev Eipyjvy], lv Maijxw (read McoMco, i.e. MevsXaoi — or MeveXeco — Mefxovcofxsvw) SocpoxXsou^ 7ipox£ifX£vov co<; cto tou Sopoc; ecmv. This is plain enough, and Choeroboscus is an authority of some importance : incidentally we learn that the true reading is cruv Sopst, cruv dcrmSt, not— as might be suggested— £uv Sopl £uv dcnuSi, which would violate Hilberg's canon. But two scholia have led editors astray. The one, on the passage from the Vespae, runs : to tou 'Ayouou a (above this a is written a t) Mcojjiou Spd[j.aTo^. We should read : to too ' Ayatou, a Mco (i.e. MeveXeco) Mou Bpd.y.<xxoQ. In the light of Choeroboscus (and the natural meaning of to tou 'A^aiou supports me) I without hesitation translate \" the words of the Achaean, line one of the play Men. Mem.'''' : the Sophoclean play is meant. Editors however read : to tou 'A^aiou d7r6 Mtojxou SpdqjiaTOc;. They understand this as \" the expression of Achaeus, taken from the play Momus \" : there was, they conjecture, a Momus by Achaeus. The other— and fuller — scholium, on the pas- sage from the Pax, runs : to Se cruv Sopl cruv acnuSt. 'A/aiou ECTUV EX MtO[J!.OU. OuSsV Se X£^P0V oX6xX7]pOV GsLVOa TO tafxpslov, oTcsp outco<; sx£I-' \"^P7]? ° XflaTTjc; cruv Sopl cruv acnriSi. From this, by itself, one might reasonably infer a Momus of Achaeus' : but it does not stand by itself. Am I wrong ? I urgently invite criticism, though not the sort of criticism (which I have encountered) that states, without data, that I contradict known facts. Fr. 424. This Fr. has been in modern times attributed by conjecture to the alleged Momus. I in this book assign it to the Helenes Gamos and number it Fr. 181 B. The entry (in Bekker's Anecdota) which presents it now runs : ap7ryjv Spsraxvov. 2oq>oxX9)<; v6[xco craTupixto. The word v6[xq> may well stand for Tqxcp. See my edition of the Ichneutae (p. 615).

For such datives as 7rpufxv7]T7)c7t.v see my remarks on Fr. 555 : the dual -n-sptcpEpsi, in the last line of all. is the proper contraction of -rcspicpspee. I rather think this resonant passage is from in— X 39 the Satyric Pyrcaeus (see on Fr. 431). Is it not a little too quasi-Aeschylean for a tragedy by Sophocles ? I doubt e£ hoc, 8sxa (out of a single ten) in any tragedy, and with the almost certain aricppoc I would compare the similarly almost certain o-Ttcppoofj-a of the Ichneutae (1. 06). I commend this Fr. to the specially minute study of any scholar who may think it worth his while to gain an insight into various matters that, at least in my own deliberate judgement, lie at the very root of the science and art of sound textual criticism.

The subject-matter of the Nausicaa may appear slight for a tragedy ; one might urge that the real tragedy must have lain in the connected trilogy, taken as a whole. But no connected trilogy seems available, and therefore I lay some stress on the (apparently) alternative title, \" the Phaeaces.'''' Fr. 440. The recently discovered additions to Photius are, as regards the determination of the context of Sophocles' previously known dvappoipSsi, a mere mare's nest. The relevant passage consists of two entries, not, as has been imagined, of one entry only.

I have no remarks to offer. Xoanephori. Correct what I say in my edition of the IcJmeutae, pp. 612, 613. The play is, I now suggest, the third of a tetralogy consisting of the Pandora, the Inachus, itself, and the Cedalion. See under the heading Cedalion. *© Ulysses Acanthoplex and Niptra. These two plays were distinct. The only difficulty as to the plot of the Acanthoplex arises from the relation in that drama of some at least of the previous history of Ulysses ; the reason for such a relation becomes apparent from what I have said (see Fr. 236) with regard to Telegonus' ignorance that his father had survived the voyage in which he encountered Scylla. Both the plays are Homerica. The Sophoclean play (why I italicise the word will appear in a moment) called the Niptra, the existence of which is certified by the ascription of Fr. 459, must necessarily deal with the washing of Ulysses by Euryclia and the consequent anagnorisis by means of the scar. This means that Cicero [Tusc. Disp. n. 48), when, speaking of the Niptra of Pacuvius, he contrasts the lamentations, in Pacuvius and Sophocles respectively, uttered by Ulysses over his wound, is referring, not to the wound inflicted on him by Telegonus, but to the ouXy]v, ty]v 7tot£ [jxv aoc, T^XacfE Xsuxw oSovti. But in that case we have, not merely a play called the Niptra, but a trilogy— or tetralogy— on the subject, doubt- less passing under the same name. The name of the first play, which treated of the dealing of the wound, we do not know (the Traumatias is certainly identical with the Acanthoplex) : I will provisionally style it the Ule (OuXyj). The third play is the Niptra proper. The tragic element is thus diffuse, the tetralogy constituting in effect one drama : perhaps such a method charac- terises other tetralogies, the data of which might resist a more normal treatment. The second play is not far to seek : it must be the Ptochia mentioned by Aristotle [Poet. 1459 a, 30) in his list of ten tragedies based on the in-x 41 Little Iliad (in none of the ten cases is the name of the author mentioned, and all ten plays seem to be by one or other of the three great tragedians), and Helen must —compare the ordinary statues of St. Roque in rags— have recognised Ulysses in rags by the scar upon his thigh. Such at least appear to be the conclusions that flow most naturally from the extant evidence. The placing of the Ulysses Acanthoplex is another matter. But even here we are not wholly without guidance. If I have rightly read Eratosthenes with regard to Fr. 236, the Acanthoplex is the eighth of Sophocles' Homerica. The subject-matter of the play is not dealt with in either the Iliad, the Odyssey, or the Hymns, but in both the Nosti (see Eustathius, p. 1796, 53) and the Telegony. As the Telegony, by Eugamon, or Eugammon, of Cyrene, cannot well have been regarded as \"Homeric,\" I take it that the Nosti was, or at least was assumed to be, the source of the drama. That the Nosti passed as, in the wider sense, ' Homeric ' is sufficiently indicated by Eustathius. who (I.e.), though there were those that ascribed it to Agias of Troezen, speaks of \" the author of the Nosti, a Colophonian \" : this is only a \"high- brow\" way of saying that the legend which made Homer a Colophonian (\" Smyrna, Chios, Colophon \" etc.) recognised it as his work. Similarly the Cypria was variously attributed to Stasinus, to Hegesias (or Hegesinus). and to Homer, and the Little Iliad to Lesches, to Thestorides, to Cinaethon, to Diodorus, and to Homer : in all such cases we may be sure that popular sentiment favoured the Homeric attribution. We thus get a clue as to the approximate range of the term Homerica. Now as more than thirty (I speak vaguely because of various uncertainties) of Sophocles' Homerica are known to us by name, and as over 120 (I again speak vaguely) of his total output of 140 plays are likewise known to us by name, it stands to reason that at the most the names of only a handful of his Homerica can have perished. The list in fact is fairly complete. It follows that the Ulysses Acanthoplex can scarcely have been the eighth of them in alphabetical order. If it were styled 'AxocvOottXt^ simply, it could not well come so late in the series, if '0&uacreu<; 'Axav0o7tAY)£ or 'OSuctctsui; 42 SOPHOCLEAN FRAGMENTS Tpocufxa-ua^ it would necessarily come far later, or if Tpaupt,aTL<x<; simply, very much later still. We seem thus to be thrown back on the chronological order. Nor is this a matter for wonder. Eratosthenes is our authority ; and Eratosthenes— and, so far as my reading goes, he alone among later writers— contrived somehow or other to get behind the veil of camouflage with which a corrupt tradition had, subsequently to the days of Aristophanes the Grammarian, shrouded from profane view the real facts as to Sophocles : from him only do we learn— this has a profound bearing on the Electra— that Sophocles composed a Clytemnestra (the title Aegisthus, known to us aliunde, is far less suggestive). In whatever library he worked, it is not unnatural that he at least should have had access to a chronologically arranged volume of the Homer ica, a volume, that is, based directly on the tetra- logical evidence of the didascaliae. But a chronologically eighth Homericum spells, in all probability, the last play of a second tetralogia Homerica. We are ex hypothesi, seeing that we are only at the eighth play of a long series, still at a date when Sophocles (and everyone else) wrote connected trilogies only. In this period— later it was other- wise— one Homericum must have meant a trilogy of Homerica. True, the fourth play of the tetralogy need not, even then, have been a Homericum : if I am right (see my edition of the Ichneutae, pp. 608, 609), when Sophocles in his old age reverted to the practice of writing connected tetralogies, he appended to a trilogia Homerica, consisting of the Syndipni, the Philoctetes Lemni, and the Philoctetes Trojae, a non-Homeric Satyricum, the Epitaenarii. But it is obvious that, in the case of the great majority of trilogiae Homericae, an Homeric Satyricum, such as the actually known Achilleos Erastae, Crisis, and Helenes Gamos, would form both a more suitable and (in view of the characters) a more convenient pendant. The chances, then, are in favour of the Acanthoplex having formed the fourth play of Sophocles' second tetralogia Homerica. But, if so, it throws great light on Euripides' Alcestis. It is, except for catalogue purposes, not a satyricum : it is a quasi satyricum, even, only in the same broad sense as is the Alcestis. Yet that in this sense it was quasi-Satyric is indicated by the extraordinary ia-X 43 finale— a finale from which Sophocles can scarcely have ventured to depart— presented by the Nosti, which work rounds off the situation with a double marriage, splicing (save the mark !) not only Telemachus and Circe, but also Telegonus and Penelope. Moreover Fr. 453, as I shall argue, shows traces of Satyric language. But Hercules— this is important — does not figure . On the whole I incline to consider that this play, with its second wounding of Ulysses, is the quasi-Satyric fourth drama appurtenant to the Niptra trilogy. If in it Circe comes in person— as seems to me probable— on the stage, her anagnorisis of Ulysses, alive or dead, would doubtless be based upon the scar of the old wound. Frr. 453, 454.

Schmidt and Wecklein both tried, without much success, to combine the two Frr. They clearly form part of a narrative by Ulysses : hence the indirect interrogation. It is most improbable, in view of the merely incidental mention of the episode, that the passage should have been spun out to the extent of presenting two separate lines with &{jlqic, in the first foot of each of them : therefore I agree with those who favour combination. Though Fr. 454 is, in its entirety, presented twice, and each time with cplpwv, not cpepco, yet the second presentation— by Eustathius— is not inde- pendent (witness his <pacri).
