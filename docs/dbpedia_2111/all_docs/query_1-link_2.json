        "text": "I apologize if this has been mentioned before.\n\nI noticed a strange newspaper lying around in Dante's trailer, towards the beginning of the game...\n\nThe newspaper is surely enough titled: Limbo City Chronicle\n\nThe headline proclaims: KYLE RYDER SAVES BANKING SYSTEM\n\nBelow, is very obviously a picture of Mundus.\n\nEven though we're close to the games release and we'll find out anyway, I'd like to hear your opinions.\n\nCrap, sorry if I came off as snarky in my first post. That was totally unintended.\n\nIf you check out the DMC fanwiki (I know, wikis are crappy sources) page on DmC!Mundus, it mentions the 'Kyle Ryder' bit in the trivia section.\n\nIt's cool. ^_^\n\nAs for the wiki, I haven't really checked it in awhile so I could avoid potential spoilers.\n\nI'm assuming we see Mundus rise in power through cutscenes in between missions.\n\nIn the opening of the game, it shows Mundus threatning the President for some kind of deal and he gets away with it. So I'd say that was the big moment for Mundus getting power.\n\nThere is a fault in his plan though. If he wanted to rule Limbo city for centuries, he couldn't keep being Kyle Ryder. People would wonder how this guy was livinng for so long. He'd have to fake his own death and reinvent himself every 50 years or so.\n\nI apologize if this has been mentioned before.\n\nI noticed a strange newspaper lying around in Dante's trailer, towards the beginning of the game...\n\nThe newspaper is surely enough titled: Limbo City Chronicle\n\nThe headline proclaims: KYLE RYDER SAVES BANKING SYSTEM\n\nBelow, is very obviously a picture of Mundus.\n\nEven though we're close to the games release and we'll find out anyway, I'd like to hear your opinions.\n\nI don't know if you saw the french comics translations I did but Kyle Ryder was mentionned in it. I really thought it could be Mundus since in the comis they say he's the leader of [I dont remember] thing and he also organise that free Virility give out. So yeah, Thanks to confirm this anyway\n\nThe President was somehow \"helped\" by Mundus, who saved the banking system\n\nI think Mundus caused the financial problem just so he could seem like he was saving people. There is mention of a huge sum of money suddenly going missing. I bet he did it.\n\nThen he saves the economy just a little to make himself look good to the public, but still leaves a little financial crisis to blackmail the President.\n\nThere is a fault in his plan though. If he wanted to rule Limbo city for centuries, he couldn't keep being Kyle Ryder. People would wonder how this guy was livinng for so long. He'd have to fake his own death and reinvent himself every 50 years or so.\n\nDoesnt he control more than Limbo City? Im not sure but a lot people think the body he uses is a host so if thats true it will die of old age on its own and if thats not true he could just fake his death once and then rule everything from the behind the scenes since its probably easy for him to cover it up since he controls pretty much everything.\n\nI thought Limbo city was more like a place to test his ideas for controling humans before he moved on to total world domination (which it seems he has if what Lilith says is anything to go by). >_<\n\nIn the comic, it shows he is still trying to perfect Virility for controlling the masses. I assumed once he was able to dope humans up successfully, he could do what he wanted."
