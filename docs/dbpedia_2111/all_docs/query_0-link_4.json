        "text": "If you could sum up 2021 in a mixtape…would it even be worth the effort?\n\nIt’s a question I’ve gone back and forth on for a while now. Most of the time, 2021 felt like a continuation of all the badness that was 2020, and didn’t feel like it had any personality or character of its own. There was no country-changing election, no notable genre trends, and no parent-requested playlists to help fill out our track list. Even the pandemic, now on its third variant, feels like a remix of an existing song, bringing in a guest star for a verse or two to send it back up the metaphorical Hot 100 of our consciousness. If 2020 was an album, 2021 is just the deluxe version, with a couple of new tracks tossed in to justify charging twice the price for it.\n\nStill, as 2021 winds down, it’s important to remember that this year did not happen in a vacuum. We may be in the same spot that we were last year, but we are here by choice, or rather by the many choices that people have made to disregard the well-being of others, to spread misinformation and disregard the truth, or simply to turn their back on the entire situation and prematurely return to whatever “normal” was in 2019. As a result, our society remains divided, the election remains contested, the reckoning with police brutality and racial inequities was deferred, and the pandemic death toll now exceeds 820,000 in the United States. It’s been said that “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,” and 2021 is what happens when we actively and willfully try to ignore both past and reality as a whole. If we’ve already forgotten 2020, we need to do all we can to remember 2021 and the misery that result, in hopes that this will spur us all to make better decisions going forward so that we never end up at this crossroads again.\n\nThe only rule for this list is that there are no other rules. Songs are not restricted by genre, artist, original year of release, or anything else (in fact, given how surreal and absurd this year felt sometimes, weirdness may actually strengthen a song’s case for inclusion). All that matters is whether or not a song can be tied back to 2021 in some shape or form.\n\nFor better and sometimes for worse, this is the official Kyle’s Korner playlist for the continuing tire fire that was 2021.\n\nAdele, “Easy On Me”\n\nThis song hit the musical world like a tidal wave back in October, and has spent seven weeks atop the Hot 100 so far (and may well get there again after the holiday season), so it will likely end up on a lot of end-of-year lists. However, I put the song in the “good, not great” category and found it to be a step down from her last leadoff single “Hello,” so why does it lead off my pandemic playlist?\n\nThe song is billed as a message from Adele to her young son, asking him not to judge her too harshly about ending the relationship with his father. From a historical perspective, however, I think this is the sort of plea that we’ll be making to future generations, because we’ve screwed up a lot of things over the last few years and decades: Our weak pandemic response, our weak climate change response, our weak response to the call for racial justice…heck, just the fact that our infrastructure (and even entire areas of the country) have been left to rot. Maybe some of theses issues predate us, but the truth is that we’ve had ample opportunity to impact these issues for the better, and we’ve just left the bat on our shoulder and watched our pitches go by. We’re going to be asking our children and grandchildren for forgiveness and understanding in years to come, but whether or not we get it (or even deserve it) is an open question.\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus, “Burn Down The Trailer Park”\n\nSo what’s a long-forgotten single from 2001 doing this early on the list? It’s because a bunch of angry morons tried to burn down the country just six days into the new year, storming the U.S. Capitol to disrupt the counting of electoral votes for the presidency. Just like Cyrus’s narrator here, these people were so blinded by rage, grievances, and stupidity that they decided to score an own goal and destroy everything around them, not realizing the damage they were doing to themselves (and everyone else) in the process. It’s kind of scary how well this parallels the lead-up to January 6th: The consumption of new-ish media (satellite TV in the song, the Internet and social media in 2021) led to a noticeable change in someone’s attitude and behavior, the way the narrator references being “paranoid and scared to death,” and how the response to the other’s person behavior is to simply destroy everything instead of, you know, confronting them and talking about it? Despite what idiots like Tucker Carlson would have you believe, what happened that day was neither patriotic nor brave. The storming of the Capitol was dumb, it was dangerous, and it was deadly, and we need to remember it for what it was to ensure that it never, never, never happens again.\n\nWard Davis, “Black Cats And Crows”\n\nI tend to be late to the party on material that doesn’t make it on my review list in a given year, and that was the case with Davis’s incredible 2020 album Black Cats And Crows. The title track earns a spot here because if depression were a song, it would be this one, and it travels to the sort of dark places that I think this year sent a lot of people to, especially as new coronavirus variants emerged and the promise of a “hot vax summer” and a “normal” school year crumbled into dust. This was supposed to be the year that we put the pandemic behind us and started working on the issues that it had laid bare, but instead America ended up losing more lives to COVID-19 in 2021 than in 2020, despite all of the knowledge we had gained and the tools we now had at our disposal. The coronavirus took what seemed like our best shot and came back with a devastating one-two combination of its own, sending us sprawling to the canvas and spiraling into despair. Because of this, everyone was carrying around an extra weight this year, wondering if anything they did even mattered (more on this later) because it seemed that “every day is just another day to die.” No song captures these feelings quite as poignantly as Davis’s does, so it deserves a prominent spot on this list.\n\nWillie Jones, “American Dream”\n\nChapel Hart wasn’t the only musical act that was overlooked for my best-of-2021 list—Jones dropped “American Dream” back in January, and honestly this would have probably been my #1 song of the year had I gotten around to review it. If I had one issue with “I Will Follow,” it was that the song never went beyond a declaration that they would never give up, and all of its hard edges had been sanded down to make the song more palatable to a wider audience. This song makes no such concession: The sound and beats are in-your-face, Jones is direct and determined in his delivery, and the lyrics get straight to the heart of the matter: Life in America is very different depending on your skin color, and while progress had been made over the years, we’ve still got a long way to go before true equality is achieved. It’s a reminder that the calls for change made last year still haven’t been meaningfully addressed (see: the Morgan Wallen situation), and that reminder makes it a must-have for this year’s list.\n\nLinkin Park, “In The End”\n\nThis song is for those of you who’ve tried to stay on Santa’s nice list this year. You’ve been diligent about following the pandemic best practices I’ve been shouting about for nearly two years. You were fully vaccinated, and even gotten a booster shot. You barely leave the house, you wear your mask indoors and outdoors, and you’ve even confronted an apathetic family member and convinced them to get the vaccine. You’ve done everything that’s been asked of you since the pandemic started, and then some. You “tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn’t even matter.” You’re probably feeling angry right now: Angry for all the time you’ve lost, angry for how little of a difference you think you’ve made, and most of all you’re angry as the people who didn’t do the right thing, who didn’t protect themselves and allowed the pandemic to linger and eventually rise again. I understand you’re anger, and these three and a half minutes are for you to vent your frustration and wonder if it was all worth it.\n\n…Feel better? Okay, now let me be the first to say that what you’ve done is admirable, and that it was worth the sacrifice. Without folks like you, this pandemic could have been much worse, and tens or hundreds of thousands of additional people could have died. You helped flatten the curve in the early days of 2020, and you kept the delta surge from being as bad as it could have been. You controlled what you can control, and we’re all grateful for it.\n\nNow spare a moment to think about the unvaccinated people around you. They may be selfish and misinformed, and you’re free (and even justified) to be mad at them, but never forget that they are still human beings, and keep that in mind even as you rail against their behavior. Like it or not, we’re still all in this together, and we’ve got to control what we can control, even if we can’t control other people. We have tried so hard and have gotten so far, and in the end, it did matter, even if it doesn’t always feel like it.\n\n(If you’re one of the people who are still unvaccinated, my message for you is this: There’s still time to make a difference. The vaccines are safe, effective, and will help protect both you and the people you care about. The ultimate decision may be yours, but know that we would all be greatly appreciative if you got the shot.)\n\nBlake Shelton, “Come Back As A Country Boy”\n\nSadly, if a song aggravates me enough to match the all-time low score ever handed out on the blog, it made enough of an impact to make it onto this list. This song represents the anger and closed-mindedness exhibited by many in our community, the raw emotions that lead people to draw hard lines between “us” and “them,” and vilify anyone who’s not on the “country” side of the line. “The Worst Country Song Of All Time” may have explicitly listed the “undesirable” characteristics of “non-country” folks, but this one drew my ire the most because it took the hostility an extra step too far, declaring that anyone who wasn’t part of the “country” crowd might as well be dead, but their life wasn’t worth living.\n\nFor the life of me, I can’t figure out why so many are so dedicated to this small-tent mindset, casting out people for severe transgressions like preferring soft drinks to liquor and driving a hatchback instead of pickup. (I also can’t see why people insist on trying to tell us how awesome their life is by telling us how not awesome it is, as Shelton does in great detail here.) Country music is better as a big tent where people are free to try different sounds and songs to see how things come together. I may not always like the results (abrasive drum machines rarely have the warm, textured feel I’m looking for), but I’m glad that people have the leeway to experiment and express themselves the way they want to.\n\nWhen I die, I don’t care if I come back as a country boy or not, but I’d like to think that I’ll be able to listen to country music and appreciate all the ways that people have make it special.\n\nWalker Hayes, “Fancy Like”\n\nI was going to include “The Worst Country Song Of All Time” on this list, but ended up leaving it out because a) this should be a list that people want to hear, and b) “Fancy Like” wound up as one of the worst songs and biggest hits of the year, and if my list was truly going to represent 2021, it would have to be included somewhere. Chalk this one up as a victory for the Internet: The song was poorly produced, poorly written, and poorly performed, but it found a spark through a little social media virality and exploded to the point where Applebee’s had to put Oreo shakes back on the menu.\n\n“Fancy Like” is the latest example of how being popular and being good are two very different things when it comes to music. From a critical standpoint, there’s basically nothing redeeming about this song; however, if you can write something that resonates with people and hit the marketing jackpot with enough silly dancing and the right brand tie-ins (a lot of review traffic I got came from a Reddit dedicated to commercials), you might just wind up with one of the biggest songs of the year. For the world’s sake, however, let’s hope the novelty wears off before it winds up in the gold rotations…\n\nRonnie Milsap, “Money (That’s What I Want)”\n\nThis song is here for two reasons:\n\nAs the world moves on towards different forms of media (and eventually to a media-less future thanks to digital downloads), I’ve inherited several collections of CDs, cassette tapes, and vinyl records from people trying to downsize or who no longer have the means to play them anymore. Sitting around at home so much has finally given me the time and motivation to start going through and cataloging all of the items, and while there have been some surprises amongst the items (who knew people purchased so many Christmas cassettes?), there have also been some real gems buried deep in the pile, and a high-quality copy of Milsap’s retro 1986 album Lost In The Fifties Tonight is one of them. This song represents all of the media of yesteryear still sitting in closets and basements around the world, and if you’ve still got a stash somewhere, you should take a moment to revisit it sometime.\n\n“Happy, Happy Birthday Baby” is the best song on this album, so why is the closing Barrett Strong cover here instead? It’s because money is what everyone wants these days, and right now we seem to stuck in this spot where there’s too much money and not enough money in the system at the same time. Corporate profits are surging and billionaires are launching themselves into space, all while many people are still dealing with job losses and food insecurity. Wages have seen some real growth this year, but so has inflation, and while I think I think things will eventually get better, it’s hard to say when that might actually happen.\n\nKing Curtis, “Da-Duh-Dah”\n\nThere’s an interesting story behind this one: While walking through the supermarket one day, I heard an old 80s pop song that I remembered from long ago, but I didn’t know the title or any of the lyrics. Instead, all I remembered was the “duh duh da-da da da dadadada” vocal break between choruses. It wasn’t much of a search query, but I dutifully typed it into the YouTube search bar hoping that the algorithm would provide me with some answers. Instead, it brought me to the 1960 leadoff track from The New Scene of King Curtis, and introduced me to the famed saxophonist “King” Curtis Ousley. Curtis is best known for playing on hits such as Aretha Franklin’s “Respect” and The Coasters’s “Yakety Yak,” but he produced some singles and albums of his own, and by sheer luck I stumbled onto this exquisite jazz instrumental performed by an all-star cast. (Seriously, when you can even feature the drummer on an extended solo, you’ve got one heck of a band.)\n\nThis find may have been serendipity, but I hope it encourages folks to try step outside their comfort one and check out types of music that they may never have considered before. Our preferences tend to solidify as we get older, so every so often you should go off on a musical tangent and see what you discover. I’ll bet there’s a lot more music like this out there to find and enjoy.\n\nLena Raine & 2 Mello, “Mirror Temple (Mirror Magic Mix)”\n\nSo after spending almost two years doing nothing but watching YouTube videos, I decided to take another shot at making videos myself. I had a short ‘Kyle Vs.’ series back in 2017 after getting laid off from a job in Texas, but over the last few years the channel had gone dormant, with only a few musical posts here and there getting posted. This year, despite being busier than ever, I decided to jump back into the video content grind, and Celeste, a game that took a recommendation from a fellow gamer and a 75% off sale to convince me to buy it, was the game I used to re-launch it.\n\nAfter three-and-a-half months of messing around with YouTube, I’ve learned that putting this stuff together is fun, but it’s really time-consuming and much harder than tossing together my blog posts. (Also, no one actually watches my longer videos, which tells me I should’ve restarted this thing on TikTok instead.) Still, it’s pushed me to do some things I didn’t think were possible, starting with completing these dastardly C-Side levels that are waiting for you at the end of Celeste. Chapter 5 was the the one that left the biggest impression on me (I was hearing this blasted song in my dreams for two days after beating the level), so its C-Side remix makes my year-end list.\n\nWhere will the channel go in 2022? I’m not sure yet, but I’m going to keep working on it alongside the blog until my brain explodes, and when that happens…well, hopefully it’ll at least make for good content.\n\nLefty Frizzell, “Cigarettes And Coffee Blues”\n\nMy retro music kick from last year continued into 2021 (albeit at a reduced pace), and one of the main focuses this year was Frizzell, a country music legend that going into the year I knew next to nothing about. I found a couple cassettes, bought a compilation CD, and started digging into Frizzell’s surprisingly-large discography. (Ironically, 1958’s “Cigarettes And Coffee Blues” was not included on the CD I got, so I had to listen to it through YouTube, and it was so darn catchy that I wound up choosing it for the playlist.) Frizzell’s superpower seems to be the combination of a distinct voice and an easy, effortless charisma that makes him both believable and enjoyable regardless of if the song is serious (“The Long Black Veil”) or silly (“If You’ve Got The Money (I’ve Got The Time)”). He excels as a storyteller (see: “Saginaw, Michigan”), and he’s got this sort of understated, plainspoken delivery that reminds me a lot of Randy Travis (which makes sense, given that Travis cites Frizzell as one of his major influences). In other words, I’d say Frizzell deserves his spot in the country music pantheon.\n\nAs for which artist will get this slot next year? It’s hard to say…but if I had to put a name down, I’d really like to get into Jerry Reed’s back catalog one of these days.\n\nRandy Travis, “Ain’t No Use”\n\nSpeaking of Travis, a.k.a. the G.O.A.T of country music, his debut album Storms Of Life turned 35 this year, and Warner Bros. marked the occasion with a remastered release of the album that included three new old songs recorded as part of those sessions, of which “Ain’t No Use” was the best of the bunch. While I’m not thrilled with the practice of labels sitting on recorded material and releasing it years later, I’m glad to see Travis getting his due as a titan of the genre (honestly, it seems like he’s been more visible in the last few years than in the previous ten). Country music has a habit of not giving people their due until they’re dead, but in a sick and twisted way Travis’s 2013 stroke and slow recovery has made country music decide “close enough” and give him the accolades he deserves.\n\nIf Travis is never able to perform in, we can at least take solace in the fact that Storms Of Life and twenty-five-plus years worth of recordings exist, and that we still have the chance to experience Travis’s amazing baritone and are able to show people who never heard him live the reasons that he was so good. In a weird way, that’s part of the reason I started writing blog posts and recording songs: If a bus were to smear me across the highway tomorrow, these makeshift horcruxes would live on, and I could be remembered through my rants about Dustin Lynch and Celeste-induced screams of agony. There’s nothing like a global pandemic to make you think about your “legacy,” and while you may never be as famous as Travis, there’s someone (perhaps a future generation of your family) that might be curious about who you were and what you stood for someday, and preserving your thoughts/sounds/pixels means that you’ll be more than a name on a stone to them after you’re gone.\n\nSpeaking of death…\n\nChris Janson, “Bye Mom”\n\nThis one is for all the premature goodbyes we’ve had to say to parents, grandparents, siblings, children, friends, and acquaintances over the last year. 2021 was supposed to be the year we left the pandemic in the dust, and instead we’ve lost more people in the U.S to the coronavirus than we did in 2020. With many people forced to say goodbye remotely or through a maze of tubes and machines, I think there’s been a real a lack of closure for the nation, and Janson’s song is an attempt to resolve this, giving voice to those who have been unable to find or deliver the words to describe their feelings.\n\nWhen all this is finally, I’d like to see a monument go up somewhere to honor and remember all the people that have died from COVID-19. The deaths have been numbers rather than names for a while now, and I’d like us to have a physical reminder that these were all people with lives and families, a place like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial where we can go to remember and pay tribute to those we’ve lost. For now, however, we can only keep the memory of those we’ve lost as close as we can, and vow never to forget them.\n\nJohnny Paycheck, “Take This Job And Shove It”\n\nCody Johnson released “‘Til You Can’t” back in October and implored the world to stop wasting time and do the things you want to before you aren’t able to, but by this point a lot of people had already taken that advice. Instead, millions of people were singing along to Paycheck’s 1977 anthem as they joined in “The Great Resignation,” leaving their jobs and striking out in a new direction for better pay, a better work/life balance, or to follow their passion and try to turn it into a career. In the face of massive loss and the potential risks of returning of work, millions of us turned a critical eye towards our lives and decided to do something to prioritize the things we really cared about. (Perhaps that’s where my sudden return to YouTube came from…)\n\nPower has swung from employers to employees in a big way this year, and it’s a trend I’d like to see continue in the next twelve months. People feel empowered to take back control of their lives and jobs right now, and I feel like this will put everyone in a better position in the long run.\n\nBrothers Osborne, “I’m Not For Everyone”\n\nThis list has mostly been a downer up to this point, so let’s try to wrap things up on a high note. There isn’t much that I can say that I haven’t said already, but I think this captures exactly what I’d like country music to be going forward: An inclusive genre where different sorts of sounds and people can gather freely, all united by the bonds of experience and life lessons. “Country,” like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, and while we all may not agree on songs (see: Hayes’s abomination above), if we keep our doors and our minds open to different ideas and sounds, I believe the genre will ultimately be a better place for it. (Note that this is why “Fancy Like,” for all its flaws, still ended up ranked above exclusionary garbage like “Old School’s In,” “The Worst Country Song Of All Time,” and “Come Back As A Country Boy” on my year-end list.)\n\nWe drew a lot of lines between people in 2021. For 2022, let’s try reaching across them instead.\n\nChapel Hart, “I Will Follow”\n\nI don’t do album reviews on the blog anymore, mostly because I don’t subscribe to any streaming services and rarely buy full albums anymore. I bought The Girls Are Back In Town, however, and I regret nothing: It was a strong album from start to finish, and even the more-generic and attitude-laden stuff that you might find on anyone’s album worked here thanks to the stellar performances of Danica Hart, Devynn Hart, and Trea Swindle. These three have solid deliveries, effortless charisma, and incredible harmony, and when packaged with classical-leaning instrumentation and some truly amazing material (“4 Mississippi,” “Jacqui’s Song,” “You can Have Him Jolene,” “Tailgate Trophy,” and of course “I Will Follow”), this is an album that will probably end up on a few year-end lists for all the right reasons. “I Will Follow” is my #1 single release of the year and thus is the group’s official representative on this list, but you could pick pretty much anything from this album and not go wrong.\n\nThe failure of radio to pick up on this trio in 2021 is astounding, and I sincerely hope the genre rectifies this in 2022. This trio deserves to be heard.\n\nWillie Nelson, “Still Not Dead”\n\nLet’s give Willie Nelson the last word for this year, and this 2017 song from God’s Problem Child gives us a hopeful starting point for next year. If you’re reading this, then at the very least you’re “still not dead again today,” and like Ebeneezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, you’ve still got a chance to make a difference. There’s a lot of doom and gloom in the world and admittedly little to look forward to right now, but if have to start somewhere, let’s start here: We’ve got a single day to do our part to make things better, and with any luck we’ll get another day to do it again tomorrow. At an ageless 88 years old, Nelson may look immortal to the outside world (you could imagine him playing chess against Queen Elizabeth II in the year 2100), but he’s acutely aware of his mortality, and he’s doing everything he can to live a full and meaningful life right up the day he passes away. We should all be so lucky, and we should all be looking to him as an example.\n\nTo paraphrase another Nelson composition: It is funny how time slips away, and we shouldn’t let it get away so easily. You’ve still got today and we’ve all still got 2022 (hopefully), so let’s make the best of it, and make the 2021 the year that we decided that enough was enough.\n\nHappy New Year, folks. At the risk of having to eat my words again, here’s hoping it’s better than the last one.\n\nWelcome to 2021: The year that should’ve been but never was.\n\nIn my 2020 list, I called out country music for three issues:\n\nEverybody looks the same (the genre is dominated by white men, and women and artists of color are mostly ignored by the radio).\n\nEverything sounds the same (every song features the same three or four instruments and does nothing interesting with them).\n\nEveryone talks about the same thing (there’s a list of 10-20 words that every song has to include, and you’re either drinking because you’re happy, drinking because you’re sad, or drinking because you don’t feel like doing anything else).\n\n2021 was supposed to be different. We had seen all the rot behind the curtain, and we were going to finally do something about it.\n\nSpoiler alert: We didn’t.\n\nFor all the optimism that the year started with, we find ourselves at the end of this year in pretty much the same spot we did last year: Bitterly divided, starkly unequal, and mostly drunk. In short, 2021 was a major disappointment, leading most of us to not put the same faith in 2022.\n\nHowever, for all the bland sameness permeating the airwaves, there were a few artists who dared to throw away the mold, ignore the headwinds, and walk the road less traveled. These artists shook up the mainstream formula, whether it be with different tales, different sounds, or by simply standing up and being themselves, and while they weren’t always rewarded by radio for doing so by radio, giving them the recognition they deserve here is the least that I can do.\n\nI present to you my ten favorite songs from 2021.\n\nLast Year’s Winner: Mickey Guyton, “Black Like Me”\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\n#10: Midland, “Sunrise Tells The Story” (final score: 7/10)\n\nBecause it’s not a Top Ten list on this blog without these guys, right? You might think that Midland, whose star has fallen precipitously since the days of “Drinkin’ Problem,” had simply missed their moment, but I’d argue that they never got a moment to begin with: The brief turn back towards a classic country sound around 2016-2017 turned out to be a mere head-fake, and when we plunged headfirst into the Boyfriend and Cobronavirus eras, there isn’t much wiggle room for a throwback band like this one. Still, I give the trio credit for sticking to their guns and making the sort of music they want to make, and I still think they’ve got a lot going for them: A textured sound that still stands out on the radio, a charismatic lead in Mark Wystrach and solid vocal harmonies from Cameron Duddy and Jess Carson, and while their material has trended a bit more towards the ephemeral side over time, there’s still a thoughtful storytelling quality to songs like this one. While I fear their downward trend will continue into next year Midland will always have their incredible run of dominance here on the blog.\n\n#9: Cody Johnson, “‘Til You Can’t” (7/10)\n\nCody Johnson hit the mainstream scene at about the same time as Midland, and until “‘Til You Can’t” arrived, he’d seen a similar lack of success too. This song has really taken off on the radio, however, and I think it’s because it not only fits the mid-pandemic moment well, but also because it takes a more active approach to delivering its message. On the surface, this is simple, straightforward, and generally obvious: Don’t put off until tomorrow what you could do today, because tomorrow may never come. (As someone who’s been really sick all week, I certainly feel this one as the Friday post deadline approaches.) What sets this song apart is how the song forgoes the usual ‘woe is me’ attitude, and instead pushes the listener hard to act before it’s too late. There’s an urgency and an energy to both the production and Johnson’s vocals—he’s practically screaming at the user to do the right thing, and it’s surprisingly motivating (is it too late to sign this guy up as a vaccine spokesperson?). A lot of people are reevaluating their lives right now and thinking about what they really want to do, and Johnson’s call to action feels like just the sort of thing both the genre and the nation needs right now.\n\n#8: Miranda Lambert, “If I Was A Cowboy” (7/10)\n\nI honestly thought that Lambert was washed up not too long ago, and that she needed to get away from the genre for a while to recharge her creative batteries. 2020’s “Settling Down,” however, signaled that Lambert wasn’t ready to step off stage just yet (even if that’s sort of what that song was about), and “If I Was A Cowboy” is another step in the right direction. The production here is suitably atmospheric (it brings to mind scenes of the Old West with its guitar arrangement), and the song accomplishes two impressive goals: It allows Lambert to indulge in a classic outlaw fantasy (something her public persona is uniquely suited for), while also subtly exploring the gender implications of the trope, noting that men are often given the latitude for being “outlaw” while women usually aren’t. Lambert dials back her trademark in-your-face, devil-may-care attitude here, but she balances the freedom and isolation of the cowboy lifestyle perfectly in her performance, giving the listener a complete picture of just what such a life would seem like. I’m not sure how long this second wind will last, but I’m going to enjoy it while it lasts.\n\n#7: Carly Pearce & Ashley McBryde, “Never Wanted To Be That Girl” (8/10)\n\n“How does one end up caught in a cheating relationship?” It’s a question you ponder more than you should when you listen to as many cheating songs as I have, and this song provides as deep and as thorough an answer as we’ve ever gotten. I’ve given a lot of people static for throwing two random artists together on a song that doesn’t need it, but getting both the wife’s and the lover’s perspective on the event is what makes the song so insightful, and both Carly Pearce and Ashley McBryde play their roles perfectly. A lot of songs like this focus on who’s right and who’s wrong, but the truth is often more complicated than this, and this track present the entire scene without judgement, framing both women as reasonable, rational creatures whose behavior is completely understandable and giving the audience a sense of just how big the gray areas are in a situation like this. Throw in understated production that leans on a dobro to differentiate it from its peers, and you’ve got a recipe for a song that deserves a spot on this list.\n\n#6: Dillon Carmichael, “Hot Beer” (8/10)\n\nThis, on the other hand, seems like a recipe for how not to end up on this list. So how does a song this booze-soaked and cliché-filled end up this high on my year-end list? First of all, you justify your behavior by telling us all the ways the other person has wronged you and showing us that they’re the clear villain in the story. Second, you play an Uno reverse card and use your “country” checklist to talk about all the things you’d rather not do to make the listener feel just how over the relationship is (not fish, not hunt, and of course “drink a hot beer”). Third, bring an affable-yet-over-the-top delivery to the table as Carmichael does, and have enough everyman charisma to let the audience “bask in the schadenfreude” and not feel guilty about such a guilty pleasure. Finally, drop a surprisingly-neotraditional mix on top of the whole thing, and rely on your rough-edged guitars and plentiful fiddle to let people know exactly what song they’re listening to. Carmichael hasn’t yet been able to find traction on the radio yet, but if he keeps bringing songs like this to the table, the genre won’t be able to ignore him for much longer.\n\n#5: Lainey Wilson, “Things A Man Oughta Know” (8/10)\n\nSongs from male artists have gotten noticeably more shallow lately: They seem to force themselves onto people the moment they meet them, and then they get incredibly whiny when they don’t get their way. In response, Wilson puts masculinity under a microscope here, and makes a strong case that emotional maturity should be just as big a part of the concept as using guns and changing tires. Her narrator has the sort of hard-worn edge that indicates she’s been on the wrong end of a immature man before making them both a believable and sympathetic character. The writing does a nice job moving from the classic staples of “being a man” to the relationship wisdom that they’re advocating for, and the production does just enough (i.e., it works in a mandolin) to give it a standout sound while making sure it stays in the background and doesn’t overwhelm the song’s message. It’s a stark departure from Wilson’s uncaring, unlikable persona on “Dirty Looks,” and while I’m only lukewarm on her new duet with Cole Swindell, I’m interested to see where this new and improved version of Wilson goes in the future.\n\n#4: Chris Janson, “Bye Mom” (8/10)\n\nWhen I first put together my list, I thought that this one was way too cheesy to be ranked this high, so I listened to it again…and after having to stop the song twice to gather myself, I remembered why it was here (and for the record, my mother still’s happily alive!). The song makes me think of Randy Travis’s classic “He Walked On Water” because it’s one of those tracks you don’t appreciate when you’re younger, and as you get older and stare down death from different angles, you really start to appreciate what you have and how fragile it all really is. We’ve lost over 810,000 people in the U.S. to the coronavirus to date, and that’s a lot of unexpected, premature goodbyes we’ve had to say to a parent as a country. The production does a good job balancing reverence and melancholy with its sound, and with his earnest, relatable performance, Janson continues to be the most confounding artist in the genre (how is the “Fix A Drink” and “Good Vibes” guy also the “Drunk Girl” and “Bye Mom” guy?). There’s a certain timelessness to this song, and if the genre ever sobers up and moves back towards deeper material, Janson stands to be one if the biggest beneficiaries.\n\n#3: Taylor Swift, “No Body, No Crime” (9/10)\n\nSwift is the first artist to wind up on my best and worst lists in a year simultaneously: Where “I Bet You Think About Me” felt petulant and over-assuming, “No Body, No Crime” might be the best story song the genre has heard since “Whiskey Lullaby.” Swift uses a firm, matter-of-fact tone to get her point across (something had to be done, and she was just the person to do it), and the other characters are unsavory enough to make what sounds like a gruesome murder at least feel understandable (whether it was justified or not is another matter, but that’s a high bar to clear). The details we get are plentiful and immaculate, allowing us to see the whole scenario from every perspective, and the production sets a dark, businesslike tone that complements the story without distracting from it. Murder ballads are tricky and it’s really hard to get them right, but through Swift’s outstanding songwriting talents and some inspired production choices, she does enough to earn a spot on my list and almost forgive her for “I Bet You Think About Me.” (Almost.)\n\n#2: Brothers Osborne, “I’m Not For Everyone” (10/10)\n\nDevil’s Advocate Kyle, the floor is yours.\n\nThanks, Flip-Flopping Kyle. *ahem* Putting this song at #2 on this list is completely unjustifiable, and is nothing more than liberal signaling. You’re a documented Brothers Osborne hater that has labeled them a one-hit wonder, and then you’re conveniently on board the duo’s hype train the moment T.J. Osborne comes out as gay and the pair becomes one of those underrepresented artists you like to tout so much. You’re so transparent that it’s pathetic.\n\nFirst of all, I don’t recall you raising a fuss when I “flip-flopped” on Miranda Lambert earlier on this list. Second of all, even if you set the sexuality issue aside, this song has a lot of the things I’m looking for from the genre right now: A distinct, textured sound (mostly thanks to John Osborne’s guitar work and the chorus accordion) that sets a hopeful, positive vibe, an inclusive message that declares that country music is a big tent for all types of people, and both brothers do a nice job of selling their story (and their position just outside the genre’s mainstream—there’s a reason I called them a one-hit wonder—lends credence to their claim that they’re an acquired taste.\n\nWhile I’ll admit that T.J.’s sexuality does play a role in the song being where it is on my list, it’s because it adds another layer of complexity and a hint of darkness to what would otherwise be a kinda-sorta generic track. Consider what I said in my review back in June:\n\n“Put this song alongside TJ Osborne coming out of the closet, however, and it takes on a whole new meaning, becoming a call for understanding and acceptance of the LGBTQIA+ community. When the narrator says ‘Some people are just like me, I hope y’all forgive ’em,’ they’re asking the genre and its audience (which are not typically known for their inclusivity) for tolerance of Osborne and others like him. ‘I’m a bad joke at the wrong time’ suddenly flips from a reference to the narrator’s poor sense of humor to a calling out of the slurs and derogatory terms (which are often couched in terms of bad-faith humor) that members of this community have had to endure. The description of a bar that’s always open and welcoming becomes a vision of the world the narrator wishes to see, where people can gather without pretense or prejudice and revel in their common humanity.”\n\nIn this context, the song is both a firm statement that the narrator can’t change who they are and a plea for the greater country community (and the country as a whole, to be honest) to open their minds, set aside their biases, and judge people like T.J. as whole, complete individuals, rather than as just some token who’s defined solely by who they’re attracted to.\n\nYou want to know why this song is at #2? It’s because it deserves to be.\n\n#1: Chapel Hart, “I Will Follow” (10/10)\n\nSo now that we’re done patting ourselves on the back, let’s ask a tougher question: Chapel Hart released three official singles in 2021 (in addition to “I Will Follow,” there was “You Can Have Him Jolene” and “Grown Ass Woman”). So why did I only cover one of these releases for this list?\n\nThere’s no excuse for this, but there’s at least an explanation, and it gets right to the heart of country radio’s issues: Reviews here at the Korner are primarily dictated by our weekly Pulse posts (I try to have a score for every song on the list, even if it’s only preliminary), which in turn is dictated by the contents of the weekly Mediabase charts, which is based on the weekly spin counts from reporting country radio stations. By way of the transitive property, this means that our reviews are essentially driven by the radio status quo, which means that artists that don’t get airplay also have a harder time getting on our lists. Essentially, these reviews and lists are helping perpetuate the problems we spend so much time railing against, and someone gets screwed over nearly every year because of it (Chapel Hart in 2021, Mickey Guyton in 2020, Kacey Musgraves and Jason Isbell in 2018, etc.).\n\nAll of this is part of the reason I’m thinking about changing up my post/review strategy in 2022 (of course, I’ve been saying this for over a year now), but for the moment, let’s address the song in front of us and give it the credit it deserves. “I Will Follow” is similar to “I’m Not For Everyone” is a lot of ways: A simple, straightforward message that projects pride in oneself, a complementary sound that creates an upbeat and optimistic atmosphere that envelops the listener without getting in the way of the lyrics (heck, even the electric guitar sounds a bit like John Osborne’s signature axe), and an extra layer of meaning added by the artists themselves (Black artists have historically faced a number of barriers in the genre due to prejudice and racism, and continue to do so today—you’re telling me this trio can’t even get a hint of airplay, but Morgan Wallen is back in the Top Ten only ten months after being caught using the N-word?). What elevates this song to #1 is its sheer energy, which pushes it past mere declaration territory and into the realm of empowerment and inspiration. The quicker tempo, the organic feel of the production (even the clap track feels natural and fits seamlessly into the mix), the incredible vocal and harmony work that project determination and confidence (I’ve been hyping Midland for years, but Chapel Hart is even better)…this song has it all, and that’s why this is the #1 country single of 2021.\n\nLast year, I closed my best-of list with the following statement:\n\n“If there’s one takeaway I hope we all get from 2020, it’s this: We’re all in this together, so we’d better start caring about one another and work towards making life better for everyone.”\n\nSo yeah, that didn’t happen. Instead, 2021 was an example of what happens when everyone decides they’re not all in this together, and acts only in their own perceived self-interest and tells the rest of the world to jump in a lake. From corporations raking in massive profits on the backs of exploited workers to politicians using misinformation and outright lies to further their own careers to people putting their community’s health at risk by refusing a safe and effective vaccine, nobody was interested in hearing anyone else’s sob story—they were free to do whatever the heck they wanted, regardless of what their behavior did to other people.\n\nWe need to get back to caring about other people again, and country music can play a vital role in all of this. Artists can start as Chapel Hart and Brothers Osborne did and tell us their own stories, and then move on to Eric Church’s call from last year and tell us about the struggles that other people are facing. With increased awareness, we can take action to help those in need (whether on a personal or policymaking level), and show that having happy, healthy, and vibrant communities are truly in the self-interest of us all.\n\nThere’s a reason that Merle Haggard, “The Poet Of The Common Man,” was a country artist. It’s because country music was a place to show the world the burdens that someone carried, a place where you can stand in someone else’s shoes for three minutes and see what their life was really like. Country music doesn’t feel like that place right now, but there’s no reason why it can’t be that place again, and it’s a good bet that artists who drop songs that try to make that happen will wind up on this list next year.\n\n2020 was a call to action, and 2021 showed us the consequences of ignoring it. My only hope for 2022 is that we don’t make that same mistake twice."
