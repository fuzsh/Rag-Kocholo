        "text": "A man wanted for burglarizing the Superior home where an Iraqi war veteran shot his pregnant wife, his daughter and himself was in court Wednesday accused of another burglary and of fleeing police.\n\nTravis Lee Sherman, 22, was charged in St. Louis County Court in Virginia with third-degree burglary and fleeing a peace officer in a motor vehicle, both felonies, in connection with an incident Sunday.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Sherman had driven a vehicle that was found to have 81 catalytic converters stolen from Holmes Recycling in Iron early Sunday.\n\nAbout 3 a.m., a St. Louis County sheriff's deputy was dispatched to Holmes Recycling on a report of a vehicle on the grounds of the business. The deputy found the moving vehicle and activated his overhead lights, but the suspect driver accelerated east on Highway 37 toward Highway 53. The suspect couldn't negotiate a turn at excessive speed and went into a ditch, striking a tree.\n\nThe driver, later identified as Sherman, ran into the woods. A passenger complied with the deputy's orders and got on the ground. Sherman was soon apprehended.\n\nThe passenger in the vehicle told the deputy the driver of the vehicle was a Travis Hewitt. A receipt from O'Reilly Auto Parts in the name of Travis Hewitt was located in the vehicle. The sheriff's office learned from Douglas County authorities that a Travis Hewitt has an alias of Kyle Gillette. A St. Louis County investigator obtained a booking photograph of a Kyle Gillette from the Superior Police Department. That photo matched the man identified as Sherman, who was captured on a surveillance video obtained from Holmes Recycling.\n\nSherman was being held Wednesday night in the St. Louis County Jail on $7,500 bail. His next court appearance is scheduled for Monday.\n\nSherman is accused of breaking into a Superior home at 2011 N. 22nd St. days after the August 2010 deaths of Matthew Magdzas, 23; April Oles-Magdzas, 26; and their 1-year-old daughter, Lila, in the home. Another man accused of taking part in the crime was convicted of burglary.\n\nSherman didn't show up for a March hearing in the Superior case. According to records posted Wednesday on the Wisconsin Court System website, the Superior case against Sherman remains open and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest on March 7."
