        "text": "Dexter – Thanksgiving with the Trinity Killer\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis report will explore the huge televisual impact that is produced in the scene Dexter Morgan joins the violent Trinity Killer for Thanksgiving.\n\nTo explore the televisual impact on the chosen scene, analyses on human emotion, expression, motive and belief will be conducted as these all add up to the character that is presented on screen.\n\nAims /Objectives:\n\nTo analyse the facial expressions around the Mitchell table and conclusively uncover what characters feel and why.\n\nTo explain why there is such an impact in this scene and mention how it correlates with the rest of the season.\n\nReview the scene and bring to light any expressions that signify an intention.\n\nTo analyse what we see, what had been done was the clip was played repeatedly for unseen signs and representations. Sound was played without the visual, and vise-versa. The clip was also played at different speeds to capture micro-expressions (through on-screen camera software and playback tools).\n\nTo get into the mind-frame of a character, you need to have the ability to identify emotion and understand most (if not, all) of the reasons for the emotion that a character is displaying.\n\nPaul Ekman is an American psychologist in the study of emotions and their relation to facial expressions. The reason for him being referred to, in this report is a lot of his techniques into how to identify human emotion were implemented into this study. Now, there is a weakness when applying his research into emotion in a film context. What if a character leaked an unwanted emotion that the actor is feeling instead – well that is called bad acting. Thankfully, the acting in this scene is superb and Michael C. Hall and John Lithgow pull off great serial killers.\n\nBasic Story\n\nDexter Morgan is a blood spatter analyst from Miami Metro P.D. who leads a secret life as a vigilante serial killer (The Bay Harbor Butcher). After witnessing his mother’s murder, Dexter has an un-suppressed need to kill. Dexter’s need (his Dark Passenger) has put him in a situation in which he is hunting the infamous Trinity Killer, under the fake alias of Kyle Butler.\n\nDexter believes he can learn how to balance his double life from Trinity (Arthur Mitchell) as Trinity is a fellow serial killer, who has been killing a circulation of people for over 30 years. The reason for Dexter’s interest is, as well as Trinity being a savage killer; he is also seen as a popular family man. Dexter is determined to find his secret, for the sake of his own domestic life.\n\nThe Analyses\n\nTo what might look like an uneventful Thanksgiving dinner, really isn’t. In fact, this could not be further from the truth. At first, the only instability in the scene is Trinity’s short temper, due to an event in an earlier scene. Trinity is angry with his son, Jonah for trashing his car and is giving aggressive gestures towards him. Dexter comes to the realization that Trinity doesn’t sustain a normal family life and his family live in fear of him. Dexter is surrounded by a table of controlled smiles, and is growing uncomfortable looking at the masks, which each of them are wearing.\n\nTrinity is an old- fashioned man. He stands by a ritual, or a code. “We have a little family tradition, Kyle”. He and Dexter share the value of routine in their family lives and through their nocturnal activities. Trinity kills on a rule of three; he kills a woman in a bathtub, threatens a mother to jump of a building and then he bludgeons a man to death.\n\nThis rule of three has repeated itself for years and the method of each death is identical to those of Arthur’s childhood family. Arthur’s sister, Vera, died in a bathtub, which was followed by his mother committing suicide from jumping from a building. This left Arthur with only his violent and aggressive Father, of whom he deeply despised. Arthur later bludgeons his Father to death. The ironic thing is Arthur murdered his Father because he hated him and now he has an identical relationship with Jonah. ‘Like Father like son’ much?\n\nDexter is also a man of routine, living by his Father’s code. For each murder Dexter commits, he coats his Kill Room in plastic and wraps his victim to a table and cuts their cheek for a blood sample. He later stores the blood in a blood slide box and keeps it behind his air-conditioning unit at home. Dexter owns a sense of pride in his kills as his box is kept as if it were a secret trophy case. Now although Dexter believes he is nothing like Trinity, there are specific elements they share.\n\nWhat if Arthur’s relationship with the Mitchell’s is just an escalation of Dexter’s relationship with his own family and what Dexter sees at the table, is what his family is destined to mirror, in the future?\n\nNow back to the scene, if you were to look at Jonah’s facial expressions at the table, he shows signs of predominately fear. The evidence of Jonah’s fear is that he is quiet about Arthur spraining his fingers. Later in the scene, Jonah shows signs of disgust and contempt.\n\nThe absence of general conversation makes the room seem very hostile as everyone is watching what they say, in case of a bad reaction from Arthur. Due to the fear in the family, their words seem unconnected and influent. This is a controlled dialogue attempting to keep Arthur calm and is in no way the truth. This means they do not believe a word they have said. An example of this is when Sally Mitchell says, “I am so blessed”. A hint of the non-belief is that her vocal pitch had become a lot higher and there was a small treble, present in her voice.\n\nIt is obvious it is hard to survive with the Trinity Killer at the head of the table and everyone excluding Dexter looks very tense at Arthur. An example of someone with a tense expression is Becca, who flickers her eyes from Arthur to the carving knives and back as Arthur reaches, ready to carve the turkey. This proves Becca at least has her suspicions toward Arthur being a violent man, but not that she knows he’s a serial killer.\n\nJonah also looks anxious when Arthur carves the turkey, but he knows his Father is the violent and psychopathic Trinity Killer. It is only until he stands up to Arthur, does he mention the homicidal tendencies Arthur undertakes.\n\nWhen Sally Mitchell says what she is thankful for, she states “And for my beautiful daughter, who’s growing up so quickly”. Becca gives Dexter a smile, which signifies that she wants him to take her away, not because she likes Dexter (Kyle) but because domestic life is just so terrifying for her, and she will pretty much do anything to get away. Dexter acknowledges Becca’s intentions and feels startled. He then makes a small gulp and avoids eye contact.\n\nAs Arthur’s horrid looks toward Jonah become overly unconcealed, the homely environment is becoming antagonistic and the family’s fear is now much more obvious. Becca, still wearing her controlled smile, begins to look at everyone in the reaction of Arthur’s now, far more conspicuous anger. She is hoping for some comfort from a subtle expression. But no one gives a sign of safety, as no one is sure what Arthur is going to do next.\n\nTrinity begins to vigorously carve the turkey, demonstrating his fierce and uncontrollable anger and his dialogue is now sounding much more threatening. Sally is getting more and more afraid of Arthur, but she is attempting not to look afraid in front of Dexter, in case he insinuates domestic abuse. Becca, also afraid, is trying to conceal it whilst Jonah contemplates to finally take a stand against his animalistic Father.\n\nIt is getting obvious that Jonah is growing a hatred for Arthur through the long term fear and anger. As he is the only man of the abuse Arthur rains, he feels responsible for looking after his mother and sister; making him feel responsible for standing up to the Trinity Killer.\n\nTension rises when Arthur says “No one said they were thankful for me”, and his family’s smiles are removed from existence. Arthur begins to carve the turkey again, the knives actions are becoming a lot faster; signifying a faster heart rate due to anger (for Arthur/ perhaps Jonah too) and fear (Sally and Becca). It is questionable whether at this point; Arthur’s Dark Passenger took the wheel.\n\nThis is when Jonah’s feelings become overt and he makes a stand against Trinity. Jonah’s actions from this point can be seen as reckless but admirable. After an outburst of Arthur’s language towards Sally, spectators would get confirmation that this was no ordinary dinner.\n\nJonah says he is not thankful for Arthur, but avoids eye contact because he still fears his Father. It is possible that the reason for Jonah’s sudden bravery is because he feels more secure with Dexter next to him, because he trusts him. Jonah would also feel Arthur is less likely to break in front of a guest. How Jonah was so wrong, but he still had the guts to stand for what was right.\n\nJonah shows disgust when he confronts Trinity, saying his life is a lie and throws Vera’s urn at the wall. The contempt reveals itself in a more subtle gesture. It shows in Jonah’s face as he confronts his Father, and the anger that is hidden in the contempt overcomes his fear, giving Jonah the confidence he has ached to acquire for so long.\n\nNon-diegetic music begins to play and the homely ambience evaporates. Arthur asks Dexter (as Kyle) to leave after he verbally abuses his wife but Dexter is adamant to stay, knowing the Mitchell’s would be at risk of harm if he had left. Unlike everyone else, Dexter does not fear Trinity but only despises him for how he treats his family.\n\nJonah’s contempt, now consumed by rage has given him the ability to look in his Father’s eyes and tell him that he is a killer. Arthur makes a violent twitch and moves toward Jonah with a psychopathic urge.\n\nTrinity reveals his monster and tries to choke Jonah. Dexter intervenes by choking Arthur with his belt and dragging him away as if he were a wild dog. Dexter broke at this point due to having sensitivity when it comes to attacking children. (Reference to S1, EP1: Dexter)\n\nThere is an unforgettable climax when The Trinity Killer and The Bay Harbor Butcher reveal their demons in front of each other. What added to the climax was that Dexter would normally have a clean and controlled monster but in front of Trinity, he broke and his Dark Passenger took control. This is rare in the programme and Dexter shows true human emotion despite repeatedly stating he is not human, in other episodes.\n\nYou may or may not wonder why Becca was repeating “No Dad, no Daddy, no” as Arthur was being dragged away by Dexter and why it wasn’t “No Kyle, don’t.” The reason for this was she felt Dexter was in more danger than Arthur as he doesn’t know Dexter is a killer and she now knows her Father is one. So, although Dexter currently has the leverage in the situation, any hesitation from him would see probably see Arthur breaking Dexter’s neck.\n\nDexter’s Dark Passenger proved to Arthur of Dexter’s intentions, making the final kill that much harder in the end of the series as Trinity is now suspicious of the identity of Kyle Butler.\n\nDue to Sally and Becca walking in to what would have been a crime scene; Dexter projected all his rage after leaving the house. Harry makes the associations between Trinity’s domestic life Dexter’s future one. Due to the severe hatred Dexter has for Arthur, he infuriately replies he is nothing like him. But despite his reply, you might wonder as Harry’s dialogue is only a fragment of Dexter’s imagination, he is sub-consciously making the links himself and what Harry is saying, is only what Dexter believes he would say if he were still alive. Dexter then tries to calm himself by deep exhalation to erase any impulsive visual and emotional links between Arthur and himself, and puts on his wedding ring. This is symbolism of Kyle Butler to Dexter Morgan or even The Dark Passenger to Dexter Morgan.\n\nConducted Research\n\nThree people who have never watched Dexter were asked to watch the scene as their facial expressions were monitored. After the viewing, they were asked to express their opinions of the scene.\n\nThe look of surprise was on each face when Arthur swore at Sally. They said they believed it looked like ‘an uncomfortable, traditional dinner’ until Arthur’s outburst, which they referred to as ‘a horrid turn of events’. Although the scene had become a whole lot more contentious, they believed it to be far more engaging.\n\nAnother hint of it being a very impactful scene is, after the viewing, the spectators were curious about the show and felt compelled to watch it.\n\nThe Conclusions\n\nThe televisual impact in this scene is just massive. You have the unstoppable force versus the immovable object scenario; a classic kind of omnipotence paradox. There are two extremes that battle together, psychologically and physically. In some ways (ethics) Dexter and Arthur are completely incompatible but in other ways (value of routine) they are identical. What really differentiates them is their values towards family.\n\nAlthough they had both experienced death at a young age, Dexter found hope when he was taken in by The Morgan’s and Arthur had no hope as he was soon left to his abusive Father who he later, murders. Dexter says Rita and the kids are more to him than cover for The Bay Harbour Butcher, and they are practically his life. Arthur’s family is just cover, which is later proven as he leaves them when the police are on to him.\n\nWhether Dexter’s family is just cover or not is an argument by itself but only time can tell the overall similarities and differences between Arthur Mitchell and Dexter Morgan.\n\nThe analyses that were taken are questionable, perhaps even controversial that a psychologist’s theories were taken into a fictional medium. Whether this is a reliable analysis into deep emotion, is entirely reliant on the actors’ ability to pull off their character. The acting was fantastic in this scene and all the emotions you would expect in this domesticated but violent environment were met.\n\nIf the acting was bad or if a subtle expression of joy (for example) was implemented from the actor and not the character, this emotion would be classified as an anomaly and be cast out as it wouldn’t correlate with all the other depressive emotions being expressed. If two contradicting emotions were embedded in a character, to determine which the anomaly is, you will have to analyse the character and their intentions and cast out the one emotion that doesn’t have a clear cause.\n\nThe aims above have all been met. Together, we have analysed each character’s facial expressions and established a predominant emotion they are feeling. After the establishment, we were able to figure out subtle intentions each character gives off in facial expressions and vocal projection (how the dialogue was said).\n\nWe have discovered the power of the scene and the mountains of dangerous consequences that follow the Mitchell’s, Dexter and maybe even the Morgan’s; if Trinity were to ever unearth the identity of Dexter Morgan; blood spatter analyst for Miami Metro Police Department.\n\nUnfortunately for Dexter, the outcome of revealing his Dark Passenger in front of the Trinity Killer resulted in the murder of his wife, Rita of whom is left in a bathtub full of blood and Dexter’s son, Harrison is sat in Rita’s blood, crying. Dexter is worried that his son will turn like him as Dexter’s first memory was incredibly similar to the scene.\n\nOverall, this analysis went very well and the results were as predicted.\n\nBibliography\n\nBaum, S. 2009 ‘Lie To Me’ (TV Series) FOX, USA.\n\nDarwin, C. 1872 ‘The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals’ John Murray, London.\n\nEkman, P.
