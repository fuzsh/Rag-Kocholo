        "text": "If you scan the top 10 singles on Billboard Magazine's Hot 100 Singles chart this week, three of the songs you will find are \"A Whole New World,\" the theme song from \"Aladdin,\" \"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang,\" the rap song by Dr. Dre, and Bon Jovi's rock hit \"Bed of Roses.\" The chances of hearing all three songs on the same radio station, however, are growing slimmer every day.\n\nThe reason is the rapid decline of Top 40, the hit-radio format that for more than three decades was the music industry's most important medium for promoting pop records. Almost overnight, Top 40 has become a dinosaur, a victim of upheavals in radio and pop music that have deeply shaken the symbiotic relationship between the music industry and the medium that it has traditionally counted on to sell its wares.\n\nAmong the chief causes for this upheaval are fragmentation of the public's musical tastes, a wider variety of pop styles and the rise of music video and other new technologies -- including the Walkman -- as well as significant changes in the business and programming practices of radio.\n\nThree decades ago, pop music comprised three basic categories: pop, rhythm-and-blues and country. Now it has splintered into literally dozens of genres and even sub-genres, from rap to world music to new-age music, each with its own discrete audience. Seeking Specific Styles\n\n\"There are a tremendous number of styles being rocketed into the marketplace that everyone except the consumer is having a hard time digesting,\" said Bob Krasnow of Elektra Records. \"Radio is having a hard time dealing with it, too. Look at the proliferation of Billboard charts. There's one on every other page. It's a necessity born of this new generation of musicians. It means that people are tuning to radio stations that have the specific sounds they want to hear.\"\n\nThe Top 40 format, which plays the best-selling hits in a wide cross section of styles, does not conform to this new cultural climate of specialized tastes.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
