        "text": "This is a list of all of Kyle Broflovski's alter egos and other costumes.\n\nMain Alter Egos[]\n\nThese are alter egos that have appeared in more than one episode.\n\nHuman Kite[]\n\nMain article: Human Kite\n\nHuman Kite is Kyle Broflovski's superhero alter ego, first appearing in \"Coon 2: Hindsight\".\n\nHuman Kite was seen first as a member of Coon and Friends. After The Coon attacked Mosquito and Mintberry Crunch, he, along with the rest of the group, decided to kick him out. He later works with Mysterion and the rest of the Coon and Friends to help the people in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nHe appears again in \"Franchise Prequel\", where he helped the rest of the Coon and Friends stop Professor Chaos from spreading fake news on the Internet. When the group splits, Kyle chooses to remain in Coon and Friends.\n\nHuman Kite is also a playable character in South Park: The Fractured But Whole. He remains a member of Coon and Friends and rivals the Freedom Pals in making their own cinematic universe. He, along with the rest of the Coon and Friends, investigate the strange disappearance of the town's cats and later fights with The Coon and Mitch Conner.\n\nHuman Kite is also a playable card in South Park: Phone Destroyer. He is a 4-Cost Epic Ranged unit of the Superheroes theme. He is a flyer and his Charge skill makes all allies in a temporary area invincible.\n\nPaladin Kyle[]\n\nPaladin Kyle is an alter ego that appears in \"The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers\".\n\nPaladin Kyle, Grand Wizard Cartman, and Ranger Stan deliver a copy of The Lord of the Rings to Butters' house. Instead, they end up giving Butters a copy of Back Door Sluts 9, which causes him to become crazed. They are found by Randy and Sharon, who have realized they gave the boys the wrong DVD and ask them to bring it back to them. The boys decide to go on a quest to return the DVD to the Two Towers Video Store after realizing how much power it had over the adults and Butters. They are then chased by Butters, The 6th Graders, and their parents who all seek to obtain the DVD.\n\nPaladin Kyle makes a return in the \"Black Friday\" trilogy with an updated design. He is a member of the group planning to get Xbox Ones on Black Friday.
