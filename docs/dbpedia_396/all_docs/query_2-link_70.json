        "text": "The Disney production celebrates its 50th anniversary. Released as a preview over Christmas 1968, then in wide release in Spring 1969, the cast includes Michele Lee, Dean Jones, Buddy Hackett, David Tomlinson, and of course, our favorite pearl-colored, 1963 Volkswagen Beatle with a mind of his own, Herbie.\n\n“The Love Bug” was the last live-action movie that Walt Disney approved, was a top-grossing film at its release, and lives on in the hearts of adults and children worldwide. Happy Anniversary!"
