        "text": "Decades before Pixar’s Cars, there was Herbie the Love Bug! Herbie, a lovable VW Beetle with a mind of its own, teams up with a friendly race car driver (Dean Jones) to win one competition after another. The driver thinks the hot streak is due to his skill until he realizes Herbie’s worth—just as a sneaky rival plots to steal Herbie for himself. This delightful classic was the start of a phenomenon that resulted in six feature films (most recently in 2005 with Lindsey Lohan and Michael Keaton), a TV series, several videogames, and countless lunch boxes and other merchandise. With Michele Lee and Buddy Hackett. Come back for more family-friendly films and free activities during the 2019 Zoom: Family Film Festival, Dec 6–8. (108 mins., DCP)"
