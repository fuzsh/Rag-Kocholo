        "text": "Wanted to re-watch this again deciding i'd give it another chance in HD or even a better quality of it (the last time I watched it the quality was terrible).\n\nI found on youtube someone posted an apparently \"better quality\" upload and its a terrible VHS quality at best, I looked everywhere and ended up finding a TV rip from \"disney kahaa\" which is in Russia. The quality is by far the best but it annoyingly had a russian dub over top of the audio.\n\nI synched the english audio to match this TV rip so everything fits perfectly. Only thing that sucks is there is an annoying watermark at the bottom left as well as a few tv channel banners that pop up at the bottom of the screen, but its well worth it to live with just for the better picture quality. I'd say this is now a decent-good VHS quality or shit 480P DVD quality now!\n\nAlso I color corrected a few scenes and applied a my custom filter to it which looks a lot better than the untouched TV rip, now it has more color and is more vibrant\n\nI tweaked the intro to the movie to zoom in slightly to cover the watermark and the age rating water mark of 12+ at the top left just because it seemed to be the most painfully obvious here and since the english version had this part zoomed in a small box (like a film projector) it made sense to just crop it a bit to get rid of the watermark"
