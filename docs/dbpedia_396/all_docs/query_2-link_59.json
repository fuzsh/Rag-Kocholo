        "text": "Volkswagens, Beetles, and Herbie the Love Bug\n\nMy affliction with VW Beetle fever.\n\nIn 1969, Disney released the movie The Love Bug, featuring Herbie, a sentient 1963 Volkswagen Beetle with the racing style number “53” labeling his pearl-white body. In the film, race car driver Jim Douglas (played by Dean Jones) teams up with the VW Bug, which has a mind of its own. Douglas doesn’t realize the car’s value until a sneaky rival plots to steal him.\n\nFast forward to 1985.\n\nAfter I separated from the United States Air Force, my wife and I moved to Scott Air Force Base in Illinois, where she would conclude her enlistment. I returned to college and started a new hobby, restoring a 1964 VW Beetle.\n\nThe old car had rusty fenders, holes in the floorboard, no back seat, a pushbutton in place of an ignition switch, and a hole in the dashboard, but its engine ran well. It had potential.\n\nI devoured copies of Hot VWs and VW Trends magazines to learn how to restore and repair the machines. Most magazine photo spreads featured bikini-clad models showing off souped-up Beetles and Buses."
