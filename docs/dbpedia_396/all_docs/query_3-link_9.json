        "text": "Surprisingly winning, Robert Stevenson's \"The Love Bug\" shrugs off much of the hollow comedy and narrative laziness of that wracked Disney's live-action product of the era and lands as both a spry sports comedy and a good-natured fantasy. Starring an impishly charming Dean Jones, the film revolves around Jones' Jim Douglas and the beetle that sets Douglas on the path of put-upon racing glory, Herbie. Supported by Michelle Lee and Buddy Hackett, Jones communicates a likable everyman; and Herbie is sweetly lovable. Stevenson happily manages to blend to the speed of racing with wit, romance, and effective physical comedy. It all results in an appealing assembled and solidly satisfying piece of work.\n\nThis review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.\n\num, this movie is clinically insane. dealing with human rights of a car? Dean cheats on Herbie? they seek to torture a car? a car becomes suicidal? Dean calls Herbie \"baby\" on a regular basis to stop it from murdering thorndyke but it ends up eating him anyway, and Dean gets three-way married with Michele and Herbie. I don't know how I feel.\n\ncouldn't have said it better than sam, \"herbie is both the love interest & the dog in this movie, it's true\"\n\nA car with a mind of it's own is both treated like and acts like the family pet. It's slightly amusing at times, kinda cute sometimes, and incredibly funny on occasion. Those incredibly funny moments here are timeless and classic, something my great-grandfather thought was absolutely a riot. While much of the feature is a bit dated and super far-fetched, it still has plenty of charm without being too hoaky. It may after all be a love story, but at least there's enough of a classic comedy here to really not be ashamed to really like this one. After all, my great-grandfather did really like this one, so it can't be the worst comedy of it's time.\n\n\"Hey!

For one, the premise on paper is so stupid. I mean, come on, a VW beetle that comes to life, has its own personality, and a race car??? Come on, this could have been Disney going bottom of the barrel and not caring anymore! But the more you get into this interesting Disney comedy, the more I found myself really enjoying and actually loving this. Sure this is a product of 1968, with outrageous fashions, hippies,…"
