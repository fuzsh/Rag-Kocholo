        "text": "Genre: Disney/Slapstick/Childrens' entertainment\n\nThe cast: Dean Jones plays washed up race driver Jim Douglas, Buddy Hackett is his trusty mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz and Michele Lee plays Jim's petrol-head love interest Carole. David Tomlinson plays evil European car importer and racing cheat Thorndyke, while Benson Fong plays the enigmatic Mr Wu.\n\nThe cars: Thorndike drives a 1963 Apollo 3500 GT which heads up an impressive field of vintage racers; these include a 1965 Bizzarrini GT5300 Strada, a 1965 Chevrolet Corvette SCCA Production Roadster and a 1956 Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta. Of course, the star of this show is Herbie, a1963 Volkswagen Beetle deluxe ragtop sedan painted in Volkswagen L87 pearl white.\n\nThe plot: Jim Douglas, a racing driver who's down on his luck, wanders into a snooty car showroom in search of a new vehicle. He is quickly shown the door by its snob of an owner, Mr Thorndyke, but not before he sticks up for a 1963 VW Beetle which has appeared on the showroom floor as if by magic. The car follows Jim home and through a series of events too ridiculous to recount, Douglas becomes its owner. Named Herbie by Jim's mechanic Tennessee, the car helps Jim to a succession of race wins, and in the process attracts the attention of the nefarious Thorndyke...\n\nIn a nutshell: While it probably deserves its status as a bona fide childrens' classic, The Love Bug is something of a mixed bag for anyone over the age of its target demographic. The fact is, it hasn't aged as well as some of the other titles in Walt Disney's back catalogue; indeed it's neither as awe-inspiring as the animated classics, nor does it boast the generational cross-over appeal of recent releases such as Lilo & Stitch or Bolt. That having been said, children under the age of 10 are pretty much powerless to resist the film's charms and even the most cynical viewers may be susceptible to being sucked in. The reason for this is The Love Bug is one of the most blatantly manipulative films that has ever been released.\n\nIts secret weapon is of course, Herbie, the disarmingly adorable 1963 VW Beetle whose antics are the very heart and soul of the film. That the film-makers are able to use a machine to tug on the audience's heart-strings so effectively is a testament to the car's sheer force of personality. After all, we don't often confer human emotions on vehicles, now matter how prominently they feature in the films reviewed in this column. Thanks to the Beetle's engaging style - as well as the film's cunning editing, cute musical score and witty set-pieces - Herbie comes across as a fully realized character, with considerably more appeal than most of the human cast.\n\nThe rest of the film hasn't aged nearly as well, however; the special effects look dated, the plot is thuddingly obvious and the screenplay is hokey and riddled with groan-worthy jokes. The cast is enjoyable if mostly very dull - two notable exceptions being Buddy Hackett and David Tomlinson who are both so completely over the top they pretty much defy criticism. Michele Lee is the real gem of the bunch and its largely down to her superb work that Carole sidesteps becoming a standard love-interest cliche and comes across as smart, independent and enchanting.\n\nA box-office smash when it was released (decmiating such high-brow classics such as Midnight Cowboy and Butch & Sundance) The Love Bug was one of the highest grossing films of 1968. It also went on to spawn three sequels, none of which are as charming, or indeed as good as the original. It may lack the depth to entice anyone outside its core audience but it's solid family entertainment... as long as the children in the family aren't teenagers.\n\nBest bit: Well, Herbie, obviously.\n\nWorst bit: Herbie's suicide attempt which made us feel incredibly sorry for the poor little car. And then we felt incredibly stupid for feeling sorry for a car.\n\nRandom fact: Herbie had to audition for his part in the film. The VW Beetle model was picked out from a lineup of cars from a variety of manufacturers including Volvo and Toyota.\n\nShould appeal to: The VW Beetle fan club, families plonked in front of the TV on Bank Holiday Monday and children of the sixties who are in the mood for nostalgia."
