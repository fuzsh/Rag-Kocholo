        "text": "Disney Family Film, Disney Family Movie, Disney Live Action\n\nThe Love Bug 1968 7+ out of 10 (Disney Family Film # 29) (Herbie Films #1)\n\nThe Love Bug 1968 7+ out of 10\n\nThe Love Bug stars Disney regular Dean Jones as Jim Douglas and Buddy Hackett as his goofy pal Tennessee. Jim is a down on his luck race car driver that stands up for a cute little VW Bug in a car showroom when the showroom owner kicks the car. The car in question is the legendary Herbie the Love Bug. Herbie is an anthropomorphic car with personality and heart that decides to befriends Jim. The little car drives himself to Jim’s house.\n\nThey call Herbie The Love Bug because he has a habit of being a matchmaker for his human owner. Herbie drives Jim and a woman he meets at the car dealer on a romantic drive. Herbie becomes Jim’s car after a series of events and Jim begins to enter him in races against the villainous car showroom owner Peter Thorndike (played by Disney Veteran David Tomlinson from Mary Poppins). They race in a series of races across California. The race scenes are fun and silly. Herbie’s theme music is an infectious 1960’s song that adds to the fun and charm of the film. The Love Bug is a nice and enjoyable ride of a film in the spirit of many Disney films from this era. They were really able to give this cute little car a personality the makes him a star. The film can currently be found on Disney+\n\nThe Herbie Franchise:\n\nThere would end up being 4 Herbie films in the franchise that started in 1968 with The Love Bug and ended in 1980 with Herbie Goes Bananas.\n\nA Disney channel movie soft reboot would air in the 1990’s featuring Evil Dead actor Bruce Campbell followed by Herbie’s return to the big screen in Herbie: Full Throttle starring Lindsay Lohan. I’ll be covering all 6 films in a series of blog posts over the next month or so.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
