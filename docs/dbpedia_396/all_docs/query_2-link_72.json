        "text": "Who's ready for some good old fashioned Disney fun from the late 60s? Well I hope so gang otherwise this review isn't for you, cause we're going to review the first movie of a little Disney franchise that could, one that I watched last week with my dad just to relive some fun memories involving a Volkswagon named Herbie. Yep, let's get started.\n\nThe Love Bug is a 1968 sports adventure comedy film directed by Robert Stevenson from a screenplay by Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi who based it on the original script \"Car, Boy, Girl\" by Gordon Buford. Once again we see Dean Jones in the lead, this time as struggling race car driver Jim Douglass which is probably his most popular role and for good reason. The movie also stars Michele Lee as the love interest Carole Bennett, David Tomlinson as the snobbish villain of the movie Peter Thorndyke and finally the always funny Buddy Hackett as good old Tennessee Steinmetz. There's also Joe Flynn of McHale's Navy fame who's shown up in other old Disney movies I've reviewed, and even Gary Owens the voice of Space Ghost shows up in this movie as an announcer (awesome). The movie was the final live action film produced by Disney that had the personal involvement of Walt Disney himself, and it was very successful as it earned 51.2 million on a budget of 5 million. It was the second highest grossing film of 1969 and it got mostly positive reviews. Yep, our favorite Volkswagon Herbie started off really strong indeed, as come on who doesn't love Herbie?\n\nOkay who hasn't seen this classic Disney movie? If you haven't for whatever reason I suggest you go watch it before reading my reviews if you don't want anything spoiled, and if you do watch it just know that it's rated G and fun for everyone. Here's a YouTube link to the trailer of the movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZEMj8HEen0\n\nSo, what's The Love Bug about? Let's get right into it gang, here's the IMDb description:\n\n\"Meet Jim Douglas, a down-on-his-luck race car driver who lives in an old run-down fire house in San Francisco with his friend Tennessee Steinmetz, a occasional drunk mechanic. One day, Jim goes to a luxury car dealer and sees a strange Volkswagen Beetle with a unusual problem: it tends to drive on its own, as if it were sentient. The little Bug follows Jim home but Jim believes that the owner of the car dealership, Peter Thorndyke, is playing a trick on him. Jim decides to try out the car, and experiences its magical nature, fahrvergn√ºgen, if you will, for himself. Jim repairs the little car and Tennessee names the him \"Herbie\". Behind the wheel of Herbie, Jim becomes more successful in racing. Thorndyke wants Herbie back, but Jim refuses and Thorndyke decides to race against him. Thorndyke sabotages Herbie before a big race known as the \"El Dorado\" - an obvious parody of the then-new \"Baja 1000\" race in Mexico. Jim and Tennessee along with Thorndyke's former assistant (and ex-girlfriend) Carol Bennett, repair Herbie before the El Dorado. The trio are determined to beat Thorndyke who will stop at nothing in order to gain a victory - and Herbie\".\n\nWell, that's the movie, according to IMDb anyway. I've reviewed two other Dean Jones movies before this one, those being Million Dollar Duck and Snowball Express. I've also reviewed various old Disney movies from the 60s and 70s such as The Barefoot Executive, No Deposit No Return, Follow Me Boys and The Sign of Zorro which technically counts. This is also my third review involving racing, as the first was the strait to video animated movie Hot Wheels: World Race and of course the old Hanna Barbera animated series Speed Buggy which also involved a sentient car come to think of it. Enough of all that though, what trivia can we find out about this specific movie?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier this was the final live action film from Disney to involve Walt Disney himself before his passing in 1966. Dean Jones mentions this as a reason for the movie's success, and I yeah I can't really blame him. Originally Dean Jones tried pitching Walt Disney on the idea of a serious movie concerning the first sports car ever brought to the US, Walt instead wanted to do something more comedic and lighthearted story for Dean Jones that was based on the 1961 story \"Car, Boy, Girl\" by Gordon Buford.\n\nNy the way, \"The Love Bug\" wasn't the original title of the movie. They briefly considered other titles such as \"Car, Boy, Girl; The Magic Volksy\", \"The Runaway Wagen\"; \"Beetlebomb\", \"Wonderbeetle\", \"Bugboom\" and finally \"Thunderbug\". Yeah I'm definitely glad they settled on \"The Love Bug\".\n\nStock footage from the 1966 movie Fireball 500 was used for the beginning racing scenes, which were also used in a 1966 promotional Chevorlet film. There's a few deleted scenes included on the special features of the DVD release although I didn't watch them, plus there are also scenes that wound up not being filmed such as Jim Douglass going to a used car lot before going to Mr. Thorndyke's shop and an extended ending where Herbie was playing with children.\n\nGary Owens apparently appears as himself in the movie when he's one of the announders for the El Dorado race in Mexico, as does Chick Hearn who was an announcer for the Los Angeles Lakers at the time. Andy Granatelli appeared as himself as the racing association president, and at the time he was known for his presence at the Indianapolis 500 and for being a spokeman for the STP company. Veteran stunt man Carey Loftin helped to choreograph the various drivers in the movie in the racing scenes that weren't stock footage, and yeah there were quite a bit of drivers in this movie.\n\nHerbie himself was a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle, painted in Volkswagen L87 pearl white according to IMDb. They also say that the interior was painted gray as not to reflect the cameras, otherwise it would have also been white inside the car. Herbie wasn't automatically a Volkswagon however, as when production started there was a casting call of dozens of cars for the production to examine on their breaks whenever they had the time. Other cars included were a few Toyotas, a TVR sports car, a Volvo and of course the soon to be famous Volkswagon. The reason Herbie became a Volkswagon was apparently the fact that it was the only car that made the production reach out and pet it, as if it were a cute little animal or something.\n\nIt should be noted that the Volkswagen brand name wasn't anywhere in the movie, as the company didn't want Disney to use it for whatever reason. In the script the car was referred to only as \"the bug\" or \"beetle\" or simply \"Herbie\" as not to upset the Volkswagen company. The later sequels would however feature the Volkswagen brand, as sales on the cars were down and the company thought the sequels to the famous Disney movie would help their sales. Honestly I don't blame them for changing their mind, as Herbie is the first thing I think of when I think of Volkwagens because come on Herbie is fun and lovable who doesn't love good on Herbie?\n\nSpeaking of which why is Herbie called Herbie? Well that goes back to a series of old skits that Buddy Hacket would do involving a German ski instructor named Klaus who would later introduce other ski instructors named Hans, Fritz, Wilhelm, and Sandor. At the end of his skits he would say, \"If you ain't got a Herbie I ain't going.\" Yeah I did find the routine on YouTube but due to some language and suggestive material I'd rather not share it, just take my word for it this is apparently where the name Herbie came from.\n\nWhat about the number 53, why is that the number Herbie has? The number 53 was chosen by producer Bill Walsh as it was the jersey number of baseball player Don Drysdale, who at the time played for the Los Angeles Dodgers which Bill Walsh was a fan of. Don Drysdale spent his entire 14 year career with the Dodgers, originally in Brooklyn before they moved to Los Angeles in 1958. He made his major league debut in 1956, and even made cameos in Leave it to Beaver, The Brady Bunch, The Beverly Hillbillies and other TV shows. His number 53 was retired in 1984, yet it lives on as a decal for good old Herbie.\n\nWalsh also came up for the more patriotic looking racing stripes on Herbie, as well as the funny gags where Herbie squirts oil on Mr. Thorndyke. Also worth noting is the fact that Herbie got his own cast billing in the credits of the movie although this was the only Herbie movie where that happened, and somewhat sad to note is that only a few of the cars used for Herbie still exist. Car # 10 was recovered from a warehouse in Pennsylvania and was thankfully preserved, still looking like the Herbie we all know and love.\n\nAs you may well know Herbie eventually became a franchise for Disney, giving them five other movies and one short lived TV series that I've personally never seen. First there was Herbie Rides Again in 1974, then Herbie goes to Monte Carlo in 1977, followed by Herbie Goes Bananas in 1980, then we got five episodes of the TV series Herbie, the Love Bug in 1982, then fifteen years later we'd get the 1997 movie also called The Love Bug which originally aired as a part of The Wonderful World of Disney (I even remember watching this on TV). Then finally we'd get Herbie: Fully Loaded, a 2005 theatrical movie which is so far to my knowledge the last time we'd see anything Herbie related.\n\nHere's something random, did you know that Herbie showed up in animated form within the old House of Mouse cartoon that used to air on Disney's 1 Saturday Morning? And yeah I have proof, here's a YouTube link to that very episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQVuLTpbU4 Herbie doesn't play a big role in it but he's still in it, so good for him.\n\nThat's probably enough trivia for now, so let's focus on the critical response of the movie. IMDb gives the movie a 6.5 out of ten, and Rotten Tomatoes gives the movie a 78% fresh critical rating along with a 66% critical score. It has 14 fresh reviews and 4 rotten reviews, and ordinary I'd read a few of them but I kind of went overboard on the trivia so I think I need to move along. I will say this though, those critics that didn't like it really sound like snobs.\n\nNow let's talk about the music, special effects, story and characters of the movie. The music was done by George Bruns and yeah it sounds great. Here's an example of the classic Herbie theme, it's actually from Herbie goes to Monte Carlo I beleive but it's pretty much the same: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElVEKDXYnYs\n\nThe effects are really fun, and keep in mind that this is 1968 so it's not like the kind of stuff we'd have today. Even with that said the effects are fun for what this is, and a movie doesn't always need to be crammed with special effects. They had exactly what they needed for the movie and it looked pretty good, I'm definitely a fan.\n\nNow for the story, how to best sum up The Love Bug? Well it's basically a fun lighthearted love story with elements of fantasy due to Herbie being a living car with a personality of his own. I asked my dad as we watched the movie what he believed the message of the movie was, its fundamental theme, and he told me that he saw that it was about loyalty and sticking with your friends. We've also got that optimistic Disney feel to this movie, and the fact that Walt Disney himself had an involvement with this movie shows that it has that magic quality to it. We see this need to keep going even when the odds are stacked against us, when people like Thorndyke bend the rules to their own favor. It's basically a movie with heart, that's what I like best about it.\n\nCharacter wise we got a lot of great performances from various old TV and movie actors, and they're clearly having a lot of fun with what they're doing. Dean Jones gives us another great performance in a Disney movie and Buddy Hacket is great as Tennessee, plus David Tomlinson was a good villain in the form of Mr. Thorndyke and naturally Michelle Lee did a good job too. The real star of course was Herbie and yeah they wound up making a great character, which is really saying a lot considering Herbie doesn't really talk like we do. They still made a fun innocent character that's really appealing, it's no wonder he goe several other movies. I like the first one the best of course, this was a really fun movie.\n\nNow to rate this movie on a scale of one to ten, where one is the worst and ten is the best. I'm giving it a 10, I really enjoyed this movie, it might sound silly to admit but yeah I really do. It's a great example of how much fun older Disney movies were, I definitely recommend the movie to anyone who appreciates older, innocent movies that let you have fun.\n\nWell, that's my review of The Love Bug from 1968, hope you liked it. As usual I'm interested in hearing your own thoughts on it so long as you keep it clean (No cursing or name calling), and I'd love to hear your suggestions for future AC Reviews notes. I mostly review movies but I do review other things too, if I've seen it or read it or played it or experienced it in some way I'll probably review it. Thanks for reading.\n\n!!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug3byGAvWms\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVC-8o8sRfA"
