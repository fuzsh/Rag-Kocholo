        "text": "1Exposure in its double meaning lies at the heart of the cinematographic experience: without lighting, there could be no “moving images”: if nothing were exposed to our gaze as moviegoers, and if we were not exposed to images, there would be no viewing at all. In contrast to this structural reality of exposure, overexposure is immediately perceived as an anomaly in filmic enunciation, and is thus immediately “significant.” When realistically motivated, it simultaneously functions as a metaphor for intense forms of exposure and revelation: used “objectively”, it connotes the other in terms of the magical, the transcendent, the other-worldly; used “subjectively”, it connotes altered states of consciousness (dreams, coma, madness). At its most extreme, it consists in exposing both the characters and the viewers to light as an actual source of, and metaphorical expression for, searing pain. If such films deliberately make gazing unbearable, sustained overexposure in contemporary film can also function on a more metafilmic level, drawing our attention to the blind spot within our gaze. In a contemporary spin on the baroque allegory of life-as-dream and of life-as-stage, and in a play on the mise en abyme of illusion, overexposure thus simultaneously reveals illusion and blinds us to it, perhaps pointing to the core of the moviegoer’s desire.\n\n3Christopher Nolan’s Insomnia (2002), for instance, opens on a literal flight into overexposure: the view from an airplane above the ice fields of Alaska. The opening credits force viewers to connect the glare coming off the icebergs with disturbing images of bright-red blood falling on the stark white fibers of a piece of clothing. The glare of the ice, the whiteness of the fabric, and the overexposure of the credits that appear too brightly only to erase themselves in fadeout can immediately be connected to the title, and to the insomnia caused by the relentless midnight sun. Although we are conditioned from the very start to think of overexposure as literal and visual, and although the plot does revolve around a sleepless detective, cruelly named Dormer, who fears being exposed in an internal investigation while he himself tracks a perverse killer, overexposure is in fact displaced metonymically and symbolically within the film. Metonymically, from sight to sound, in the police station scenes, where the nauseating over-amplification of sounds as well as the dizzying camera movements suggest Dormer’s exhaustion and his rawness as he increasingly feels (en)trapped. It is this other, symbolic, meaning of “exposure” that director Christopher Nolan brings to the fore, by showing that nothing — not even light — is what it seems: when Dormer feels so tormented by the midnight sun that he piles up pillows against the blinds on his window, feeling that light is still spilling into his room, we are as shocked as he is when the hotel manager switches on the electric light and suddenly forces us to squint, belatedly making it obvious that what we took to be the white glare of the midnight sun was merely the ghostly projection of the detective’s haunted conscience, and that the room was in fact dark enough.\n\n5The double-bind the film does not manage to resolve is that, while the systematic use of overexposure rapidly becomes too predictable, the long-delayed discovery of the extra-terrestrials’ silhouettes in hazy backlighting in the last scene of the film is something of a disappointment too: suddenly they seem too defined, too naïvely present, and even François Truffaut’s awed gaze cannot quite create the mimetic desire Spielberg undoubtedly expected. In the later extraterrestrial fable E.T (1982), Spielberg more successfully limits “magical” overexposure to E.T.’s luminous finger, which evokes both the twinkling stars he has come from, and the wands of fairy tales (it is, indeed, endowed with miraculous powers).\n\n6This is also a tongue-in-cheek reflexive image of the magic touch Spielberg brings to science-fiction films in his deliberate recasting of the extraterrestrial Other as a diminutive — literally, and symbolically, in the initials “E.T.” — and lovable being, against a history of Hollywood’s casting the alien as hostile — a tradition Ridley Scott’s 1979 instant classic of the same name was about to breathe new life into. In both Close Encounters and E.T., overexposure functions as a sign that the extraterrestrial presence brings humanity a form of illumination; and while, in the eponymous film, E.T. goes home on his own, in Close Encounters, much as in the recent ecological-apocalyptic thriller The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008), a “chosen” human leaves life on Earth for a better place — in what may be space travel, but also echoes popular language’s euphemisms for death.\n\nDeath and Ghosting\n\nVisions of Catastrophe\n\nDeranged Vision\n\n15A case in point is the subjective representation of schizophrenia in Ron Howard’s A Beautiful Mind (2001), which, as its title indicates, blurs the boundaries between genius and madness. Focalization through the mathematician, whom we take to be cracking secret codes that he sees emerging from a matrix of numbers, make us believe that overexposure is used as the literal translation of brilliance; viewers familiar with Jodie Foster’s Little Man Tate (1991), in which the child genius similarly sees overexposed numbers as he performs incredibly complex mental calculations, will automatically read the scene this way.\n\n16When we later discover that these were in fact hallucinations, overexposure returns in a brutal boomerang effect under the form of electric shock treatment, prescribed to rid the genius, played by Russell Crowe, of his visions. Because this medical torture victimizes a character we identify with, exposure to the treatment is made painful for us too: when the doctor directs his flashlight into the hero’s eyes, it shines in ours, and overexposure precludes the sadistic gaze. When the image is blurred and jogged as the character played by Russell Crowe writhes in pain under the shocks, this empathetic vision suggests that we should feel shaken too. To highlight the obscenity of what we are witnessing, a countershot has the hero’s loving wife turn her head away from the windowpane, while we continue to see the shock treatment, through the pane, and the pain of excessive lighting.\n\nFrom Dream Vision to Trauma\n\n17In contrast with these aesthetics of exposure and overexposure, that simultaneously show and screen the obscene, Darren Aronofsky’s Requiem for A Dream (2000) hinges on a form of reflexive overexposure to trauma, in what can variously be received as a pornography of pain or as a political response to the violence society daily inflicts on the marginalized, whether they be junkies, convicts, prostitutes, or the elderly insane. The plot revolves around Sara, a Brooklyn widow who becomes hooked on speed pills when she goes on a crash diet, and her son Harry, a heroin addict who dreams of another life with his lover Marion. In the initial dream vision, when the camera moves through a window in the tenement, exploding the frame, luminously opening out onto the jetty and the horizon, overexposure signifies love, freedom, and endless possibility in an overexposed and clean — as opposed to drugged — landscape. At the end of the film, the same sequence is repeated but this time, the dream ends on Marion’s absence, and Harry’s fall through space and darkness into the overexposed reality of shattered dreams and the hospital bed where he lies, amputated of an arm gangrened from drug use. What the film depicts between these two versions of the dream (its birth and its death) is the spiral of addiction and degradation.\n\n18Each time, drug-taking scenes are portrayed through what Darren Aronofsky has called “hip-hop montage” (Stark 2000): a sequence of fast cut images in accelerated motion with both amplified visuals (using macro lenses) and amplified sound effects for normally inaudible realities — for instance, the “gasp” of the drug entering the blood stream. These combined techniques contribute to accelerate our own pulse, make our gaze feel invaded and our senses exposed, as if we were taking a visual “hit” and taking in the drug through our gaze. In the oft-repeated sequence, images flash seductively: the pristine whiteness of the drug, the dollar bill used to snort it, the red blood cells, and most of all, the beautiful eye of the drug-user, dilating at the end of the short, but breath-taking sequence. All the images are aesthetically perfect and, at the start of the story, the sequence always ends on the overexposed fade-to-white of the addict’s subjective vision, as both sound and image are snowed out into a blissfully white screen.\n\n19Even the scene in which Marion stands dejectedly before a mirror, nude but for a tank top, after taking the drug, blurs the boundaries of the obscene and the pure, for as she raises her arms in ecstasy while the drug takes effect, the overexposure in fade-to-white seems to play on the multiple meanings of pure as it applies both to the drug and to the young woman, in her beauty and her aspirations, despite the sordid context in which she is filmed. Ambiguously exposed and overexposed in this image is what will unfold: Marion will sell her body for drugs later on, something her exposed genitals, and the phallic presence of the vertical neon light already herald; just as her blurred self-image signals alienation, and its vanishing into whiteness, the ghosting of her youthful beauty.\n\n21Overexposure not only takes the form of luminescence, but also, that of extreme close-ups when Harry and Marion lie face to face after a fix, and speak words of love to each other. The split frame and the discrepancy in scale between the two shots within the same frame — one in close-up, the other not — seem to deny the possibility of togetherness even as the dialogue expresses intimacy (“You are beautiful; the most beautiful girl in the world; my dream”, 46’45):\n\n22Similarly, distorted wide-angle views of the characters, as if we were watching them through a peephole, recur at various moments of the film. While this makes them seem particularly vulnerable, it also suggests that viewers are voyeurs, where non-pornographic movie viewing usually requires this to be repressed (this is probably the reason Christian Metz uses the term “scopophile” rather than “voyeur” for the ordinary moviegoer in most of his work).\n\n23In this specific instance, it is impossible not to experience viewing as sadistic, masochistic, and yet, sublimated, in overexposure, into a shared form of martyrdom, as all of the subplots converge in a horrific crescendo towards the requiem sequence proper: the shattering of each of the characters’ dreams, and bodily integrity. As the film crosscuts from one vision of horror to another — Sara undergoes shock treatment; Harry’s arm turns gangrenous and is amputated; Marion performs sexually for an audience of voyeurs — it unites them under the sign of overexposure. We share their subjective vision of the overhead lights in the hospital, of the flashlights marking them out as prey, and we are forced to endure the spikes of electric shock, the whir of the bone-saw, and the gaze of the inset voyeurs. The entire requiem sequence is introduced by two images suggesting that to watch is literally to consume: the first is of a peephole, as Marion stands outside a closed apartment door, waiting to be buzzed in; this shot lasts a few seconds, so that we feel exposed to/by the peephole too long. When the pornographic master of ceremonies opens the door, his mouth fills the entire screen in an extreme close-up as he announces “Showtime!” in a second image connecting obscenity and devouring. The close-ups on the antagonists, whether they be the doctors who amputate Harry or the men in business suits whose gaze rapes Marion, reinforce our identification with the victims, but the shots that expose the victims’ bodies to us, as they are violated and broken, and the construction of this climactic scene as explicitly sexual, against the voyeurs’ background chant (“come, come, come!”) make it obscene as a representation and as an enactment of trauma. Overexposure finally returns as a merciful blanking-out, as all three victims lose consciousness, and the horror is suspended for us too.\n\n24Within Requiem’s dialectics of the exposure of obscenity and the obscenity of exposure, overexposure thus seems to be stripped of its initial magic: if it is first connected to the dream and ethereal bliss, and a wishful sublimation of the sordid, it turns to the unbearable glare of trauma. (The DVD packaging of the film takes this logic one step further: the jacket is a bloodshot eye and its dilated pupil; and the disk itself is held by a central peg which “pierces” the pupil; the connection between seeing and being blinded is thus literalized.) We are thus reminded of the “tactile” nature of “looking,” as Laura Marks puts it — Marks’ assertion that techniques like overexposure “discourage the viewer from distinguishing objects and encourage a relationship to the screen as a whole” (Marks 2000, 172) highlights precisely why traumatic overexposure feels so overwhelming as to be physically painful. The only release, at the end of Requiem, is into the milky-white — subliminally maternal? or blank? — screen; the film ends on all four main characters curling up in fetal position, some in explicit memories of childhood, all seeking refuge in sleep.\n\nReflexive Artifice\n\n27This onscreen rape of the eye is only one aspect of the rape of the gaze at work in the film. Indeed, Lincoln comes to find out that all of the clones are ultimately bred for organ harvesting should their human “original” fall sick; that the island is an illusion; and that those whose turn has come to go are, quite simply, slaughtered. In a scene in which Michael Crichton’s 1976 thriller Coma meets The Matrix, Lincoln discovers the thousands of suspended clones being brainwashed as he was, by a nonstop flow of televisual images that alternate shots of the island, and textual cues (“obedience”) to ensure that the clones learn docility. This rape of the clones’ gaze through force-fed film of course calls to mind Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange (1971) and the infamous Ludovico technique (in which the protagonist’s eyes are forcibly kept open to violent images while he receives painful stimuli, in a form of extreme aversion therapy).\n\n28While the staging of the eye as forcibly exposed to a screen necessarily makes our own position as onlookers even more vulnerable, in a mise-en-abyme of exposure, it also suggests that, as we gaze onto this scene of revelation, we are perhaps still being hypnotized by illusion. Despite the hint that we should open our eyes wider, not to absorb new illusion, but to distance ourselves from the power of images, the film proves that this is impossible: as Lincoln flees from the factory, having seen outdoor images only of the sea and of an immense offshore platform, we, like he, necessarily assume that the factory is this offshore construction surrounded by water. As Lincoln runs towards the light at the end of the tunnel, the image of revelation functions reflexively for us too: for a desert, not the sea, lies all around. The puns on “sea” (see) and “Island” — Eye-land, I-land — thus apply to the viewer too: the eye is blind to what it sees, and hungry for projection of the I’s fantasies: the marvelous arch through which we initially entered the film is exposed for what it was: just a dream, no more. Because the film is targeted to a teenage audience, the last pictures nevertheless grant us the wish-fulfillment of a happy end: the heroes reach the magnificent island of the opening credits, in a return to the idea that all images have a real-life reference, beyond the screen.\n\n30In a visual pun on life as film, his entire life as we have seen it flashes before his eyes, in extremely rapid montage as he free-falls. Then whiteness fills the screen. Just as we think he may be dead, an off-screen voice speaks the words: “Relax, David, open your eyes”; his eye, seen in extreme close-up, opens; and the movie ends.\n\n31As a final shot, it exposes the desire in our gaze, which is to see more, to open our eyes, to open them wider to the artifice, but only to be blinded again. Given that “open your eyes” was the first cue of the film itself, the loop is complete: the life-as-dream-and-film continuum is only interrupted, but never ends. Ending the film on a startling extreme close-up of David’s open gaze comes as a shock — for even as we find ourselves “disclosed” by this eye in its disquieting intimacy, almost expecting to see ourselves reflected in it — and even as we hear the injunction to leave the cinema, and to get a life — we simultaneously feel the desire to discern, on this glazed surface, precisely in the spot made starry by overexposure, what it is that this eye sees.\n\n32In an echo of Slavoj Žižek’s Lacanian reading of Hollywood film in Enjoy Your Symptom! (1992), I will conclude that if overexposure seems an almost embarrassingly obvious symbol of cinematographic desire, in its mirroring of the screen itself, of the light that both reveals and blinds, and as an image of discontinuity and of excess, it heightens, rather than shatters the illusion, even as we are made aware of it as artifice. Because it is never merely an artifice to us, since we experience it in the reality of our senses, and since it is almost always metaphorically motivated, associated to the dialectics of the “Other,” either in the fantastic, or in the dynamics of traumatic revelation; in nightmares of disaster or madness, or dreams of time travel and of reunion with those we have lost. The ultimate form of overexposure, the brilliant white screen, can signify the glare of the Apocalypse — Revelation in its double meaning — or a window that opens onto endless horizons and new beginnings, because it is the ultimate representation of the movie screen, and of film itself. It is, if I may borrow Jacques Rancière’s terms, a form of visibility that resists becoming an image (“du visible qui ne fait pas image”, Rancière, 15), and the sum of all images, in their invisibility — the Alpha and the Omega of film, and an infinite promise of more dreams to open our eyes wide/r to."
