        "text": "The Box Office Champion of 1969 wasnt the X-rated Best Picture Winner Midnight Cowboy or the lavish Barbra Streisand musical Hello Dolly! No, it was Herbie, the Volkswagen racing car (No. 53) , the title character of the Disney classic The Love Bug. I saw it that year (in a drive-in) and today, almost 35 years later, its still one wild and joyous ride. Propelled by the ingenious fantasy of a car with a mind and heart of its own, this movie deftly mixes comedy, sentiment, and special effects to produce a story that represents Disney at its very best.\n\nEverything clicks in this movie. The entire cast seems to be having a ball throughout; Dean Jones and Michelle Lee lend just the right amount of charm and spice to their romance; David Tomlinson and Joe Flynn bumble their way through various attempts to foil the little Bug; and Buddy Hackett is hilarious as the sidekick who digs Herbie right from the start.\n\nMost importantly, Herbie emerges as a real character, not just a bunch of clever feats pulled off by the Special Effects team. Midway through the film, when the little Bug feels abandoned by his owner (played by Dean Jones), he weaves aimlessly through the streets of San Francisco, his horn making pitiful sounds. He stops at the Golden Gate Bridge, determined to jump; at the last moment he is rescued by Jones, who has come to realize how much the little car means to him. In print, this sounds corny, but on film it works. We care very much what happens to Herbie and to all his friends which makes the cross country finale all the more fun.\n\nHerbie appeared again in three movie sequels--Herbie Rides Again, Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo and Herbie Goes Bananas--- in a short-lived 1980s TV comedy series, and in a 1990s TV remake, but, not surprisingly, none of them capture the winning combination of the original. Its success and popularity are well deserved, with one added benefit for Disney fans. The profit Herbie made in 1969 enabled the studio to finally greenlight a project theyd been sitting on for years Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Thanks, Herbie.\n\n-Joe Linden"
