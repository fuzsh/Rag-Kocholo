Is this true? Or has it not been announced yet?\n\nThanks for any help with this!\n\nJeff Ulmer\n\nJoined\n\nAug 23, 1998\n\nMessages\n\n5,582\n\nWelcome to the forum.\n\nIt is scheduled for 2003. If the current Vault Disney titles are any indication, it will be well worth the wait.\n\nBarryR\n\nSupporting Actor\n\nJoined\n\nJul 30, 2000\n\nMessages\n\n751\n\nLocation\n\nEarth\n\nReal Name\n\nBARRY RIVADUE\n\nI can only hope THE ABSENT MINDED PROFESSOR/SON OF FLUBBER are in the works too, not to mention THE SHAGGY DOG. And how about THAT DARN CAT?\n\nJeff Ulmer\n\nJoined\n\nAug 23, 1998\n\nMessages\n\n5,582\n\nConsidering how involved Hayley Mills has been with the first Vault titles, I'm sure they are doing something with That Darn Cat, though how and when they'll release it is another matter.\n\nSarah S\n\nSecond Unit\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 6, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n333\n\nI think I saw The Shaggy Dog in the same list as The Love Bug ; to be released next year as part of the Vault series. I'm waiting for both, myself.\n\nI hope Disney also starts looking at Toby Tyler, or Ten Weeks With the Circus & the original Escape to Witch Mountain."
