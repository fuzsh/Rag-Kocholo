        "text": "WALT DISNEY'S \"The Love Bug,\" which opened yesterday at Radio City Music Hall, is such a vulnerable movie that if it were a little less sappy, one might feel compelled to protect it, as if it were someone under 7 or over 65—that portion of the public for which it is intended.The movie is a long, sentimental Volkswagen commercial about a small car—never specifically identified but still as unmistakable as a Doyle Dane Bernbach ad—that adopts a has been race car driver (Dean Jones) and drives him to victory. Robert Stevenson (\"Mary Poppins\") directed the film, which has the form of fantasy-comedy, lots of not-very-special effects and no real humor.The supporting cast includes Buddy Hackett, who pops his slightly crossed eyes in moments of stress; David Tomlinson, the British comedian you apparently hire when Terry-Thomas is busy, and, in a bit role, Iris Adrian, who played so many movie hoofers and hookers starting in the early thirties. Here she plays what must be California's most elderly carhop. Her blonde hair may no longer be all her own, but the voice still has the appealing abrasiveness of ground-up beer bottles.It must be some kind of definition of our time that the Disney organization would make a movie endowing the mass-produced Volkswagen with all the heart of Black Beauty, or even of the little train that climbed impossible grades, puffing: \"I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.\"On the Music Hall stage is the annual pageant \"Glory of Easter,\" and a variety bill that includes a trained horse and a flock of pigeons, a pair of acrobats who make much of the genteel goose, the Rockettes and Judy Kassouf and her two flaming batons. My heart always goes out to the balancing acts, the high-kickers and the baton-twirlers, who have to work so long and hard and well for such small, peculiar celebrity.\n\nTHE LOVE BUG, screenplay by Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, based on a story by Gordon Buford; directed by Robert Stevenson and produced by Bill Walsh; presented by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution Company, Inc.
