Disney’s “The Love Bug” will conclude Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College’s free family movie nights on Thursday, Feb. 14.

The movie is about a race car driver who becomes a champion with a Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of its own.

As part of its 50th anniversary observance this school year, the college hosted a series of free family movie nights featuring films that were released in or are about 1968, the year OCtech opened its doors to students. Other titles in the series included “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” and CNN’s “1968: The Year That Changed America.”

“The Love Bug” begins at 6:30 p.m. on campus in Roquemore Auditorium. Free popcorn and bottled water will be served.
