        "text": "I was lying on my couch one afternoon in the late nineteen-eighties, trying to come up with an idea for a screenplay, and I began thinking about drag. Why is a guy in a gown, I wondered, funnier than a woman in a three-piece suit? I tried to imagine a disguise or transformation that might be more fun for a female star, and my thoughts turned to nuns. Nuns can be dictatorial, sexually repressed, and scary—and, therefore, entertaining. I pictured a lower-rung showgirl who witnesses a gangland hit. To protect her, the Feds hide her in a convent, and, because it’s a comedy, she’s forced to wear a habit. I was inspired by such gender-swapping classics as “Some Like It Hot,” and by Barbara Stanwyck as a burlesque queen invading a houseful of clueless college professors in “Ball of Fire.” But I wanted nuns, so I called my notion “Sister Act.”\n\nI brought “Sister Act” to the producer Scott Rudin, and we agreed that the leading role was a natural fit for Bette Midler, the dependably rowdy star of “Ruthless People” and “Outrageous Fortune.” Midler’s production company was based at Disney, so Scott set up a meeting in New York with a studio chieftain. I pitched “Sister Act,” and a deal was struck. I was stunned at how quickly the project came together, but then the Lord works in mysterious ways. He may even work for Disney.\n\nI wrote a treatment, which is a studio term for “Summarize the story in less than two pages so that an executive’s assistant can boil it down to one paragraph on a Post-it, and please refer to all characters by the names of the stars who should play them but never will.” The treatment, like any activity in the studio sector, is designed to make the project appear surefire. It’s an iron-clad guarantee, assuring every staff member that his or her job, home, second home, spouse, and vehicle upgrades are in the bag.\n\nThis process was still new to me, so my treatment was a bit offbeat. I wanted “Sister Act” to be a satire of sugary family perennials like “The Sound of Music,” “The Singing Nun,” “The Flying Nun,” and such parochial-school romps as “The Trouble with Angels” and its sequel, “Where Angels Go . . . Trouble Follows.” These mainstream nun movies were full of sage, older nuns who, after offering their wisdom, would die serenely off camera; with younger guitar-strumming “rebel” nuns, sometimes riding Vespas; and with feisty novices, who either had to be broken, via missionary work, or farmed out to the von Trapp compound. My favorite nun saga is “The Song of Bernadette,” a bio-pic about a French peasant girl who experiences visions of the Virgin, as portrayed by an immaculately brunet Linda Darnell. A healing spring bursts forth at the site of Bernadette’s epiphany, and it ultimately becomes the millions-served holy shrine of Lourdes.\n\nMy plan was for “Sister Act” to subvert this sort of prissy uplift. I wanted our heroine, Terri Van Cartier, to embody raunch, sex, and the unstoppable gospel of cheap showbiz. It would be pop versus Pope; and pop, in a barrage of sequins, wisecracks, and Marlboro Lights, would win. That’s how addled or innocent I was, because I actually believed that Disney would make a movie that tried to subvert the Catholic Church.\n\nTreatment in hand, I was flown to Los Angeles for a meeting blitz. The Disney headquarters, like everything else Disney, was enchanting and disturbing. There was a topiary clipped into an eerily threatening boxwood Mickey, and street signs bearing the names Goofy Avenue and Dopey Drive. Carved above the entrance to an office tower was a monumental nineteen-foot-high concrete relief of the seven dwarves with their arms raised, as if they were hoisting the upper floors. This effect was both adorable and grotesque: if the figures are that tall, they’re not dwarves anymore, plus they’re corporate slaves. During this period, Disney’s hands-on management style justified the studio’s nickname, Mousechwitz.\n\nThe first meeting took place in the sleek office of an ebullient vice-president. All the Disney executives at that time wore unconstructed black or navy suits by Armani or Comme des Garçons, for a Rodeo Drive ninja feeling. The studio was about to release what would become its blockbuster animated musical “The Little Mermaid,” and the V.P. was holding what looked like a bright-colored cardboard purse.\n\n“Paul, look!” he exclaimed, tilting the purse this way and that. “It’s the Little Mermaid Happy Meal!” I noticed a framed photo of a softball team on the ledge behind him. “That’s from our company picnic,” he explained. “It was so much fun!” I asked about the other grinning, sunburned people in the picture, all wearing “Team Disney” sweatshirts and Mousketeer ears. After looking at the picture and thinking for a minute, the V.P. said that most of them had been fired.\n\nAnother, equally gung-ho executive appeared, carrying, in his palm, a three-inch-high plastic figurine of the Little Mermaid herself, with her chunky cascade of red hair and her skimpy seashell bra.\n\n“Look at her!” the exec said. “Isn’t she hot? I’d do her!” Other staffers convened for the meeting, and they all agreed that the figurine was indeed hot and doable. As in all decent studio meetings, everyone was “totally stoked” about “Sister Act” and eager to “fast-track” the property. Most of the executives’ notes were about shaping the material for Bette Midler and about how much they all loved nuns.\n\n“Nuns!” I declared. “I’d do ’em!” Everyone cheered.\n\nI returned to New York and completed a first draft. I handed it in, and there were questions. With Midler considering the role, the movie could now become an all-out musical, so what should she sing? Original material or Motown standards? Since Terri, the showgirl, chafes at convent life, could she smuggle some of the nuns, with a few stashed in the trunk, out to a drive-in movie? To a whorehouse? To McDonald’s, for product placement? Could the nuns get high? What about sex? I felt that enforced chastity would be a logical source of comedy: wouldn’t Terri get itchy? What if there was a male character who felt turned on yet was terrified by his hankering for a nun?\n\nI flew out for more meetings. Midler and her staff were present this time, and she was becoming uneasy. She fretted about her image: did she dare play a nun? As she put it, “My fans don’t want to see me in a wimple.”\n\nMonths passed, and I produced draft after draft. One morning, I found myself seated before a borrowed typewriter in a tower suite at the Chateau Marmont, in Los Angeles. The room had open windows on two sides, looking out on the valley, the hills, and a Diet Coke billboard. As I worked, a breeze came up, and the stacks of pages flew around my head. I couldn’t decide whether I felt like one of those beleaguered, soon-to-be-hard-drinking screenwriters depicted in any number of black-and-white movies, or a sparkling Disney princess being visited by a mob of helpful, twittering bluebirds.\n\nAbout a year in, Team Disney, Team Midler, Scott Rudin, and I sat in a meeting discussing Catholic teachings on vows of silence, poverty, and chastity, and the specifics of the Franciscan versus the Benedictine order. Glancing around, I realized that I was analyzing papal dogma with a roomful of Jews. Finally, someone suggested that, for some hands-on research, I should be sent to a convent.\n\n“Yes!” cried Midler, a firm believer in continuing education. “Paul, you really need to go to a convent!”\n\nSo I was shipped, by bus, to the Abbey of Regina Laudis, in rural Bethlehem, Connecticut. I’d read that this convent was the home of the actress Dolores Hart, who, as an ingénue, had appeared as a spring-break coed in “Where the Boys Are” and had played opposite Elvis Presley in “King Creole.” Hart had left Hollywood to become a nun, taking her final vows in 1970. She told an interviewer, “There is a promise given in a vocation that is beyond anything in your wildest dreams. There’s a gift the Lord offers and He is a gentleman.” She also said, “Elvis is a young man with an enormous capacity of love . . . but I don’t think he has found his happiness. I think he is terribly lonely.”\n\nI couldn’t wait to meet this ponytailed starlet turned sister. I arrived at the convent, a series of rambling clapboard buildings set amid woods and pastures, and was assigned a bed in a gender-appropriate bunkhouse. Regina Laudis was a cloistered order, so it wasn’t the ecclesiastical petting zoo that I’d hoped for. The nuns weren’t readily available for conversation. Since they received no funding from the Vatican, they supported themselves by running a farm, a dairy, and a pottery studio; they were too busy to talk to anyone except their husband, Jesus.\n\nAlone in my bunk, I went over my research. Convents in America, I found, had something in common with charm schools: enrollment was way down. In the years before feminism, a young woman was expected to get married, and her employment options were limited, so becoming a nun could actually be a route to independence. But lately, if you ask your average teen-ager to abandon boys, fluffy duvets, and downloads of her favorite bands, it’s a tough sell. Convents and monasteries were closing everywhere, their land sold off and the buildings bulldozed. The few remaining abbeys often echoed with teetering seventy-year-old nuns tending to ailing ninety-eight-year-old nuns. Vatican II had caused additional attrition. Once nuns were permitted to wear street clothes and to work in the community, many potential novices decided, why not just become a teacher or a social worker with a livelier Saturday night? I worried that “Sister Act” might be the final crude iron nail in the Sisterhood’s simple pine coffin.\n\nI decided to stalk Dolores Hart. I had been hoping that there was a papal dispensation that allowed her to pray in capris, with a pert, highlighted flip. I skulked around and wandered into a cottage that turned out to be the convent’s gift shop. The stock was skimpy, mostly ceramics, organic skin creams, and greeting cards. (They now also sell a “Women in Chant” CD titled “Virgin Martyrs.”) At first, I didn’t notice a tiny, gnarled creature perched on a stool behind the cash register, like a bat or a long-fossilized chimp.\n\n“I hate this!” the chimp yipped, and I saw that she was trying to watch a soap opera on a black-and-white portable mini-TV, the perfect accessory for a nun. “The G-D reception keeps going out!” she cried. “I can’t see my show!”\n\nI hoped this wasn’t what remained of Dolores Hart, so I instantly turned myself into an accomplished investigative journalist.\n\n“Good afternoon, Sister,” I began.\n\n“What?” she croaked.\n\n“I said, Good afternoon. I’m visiting. So, is this the gift shop?”\n\n“What does it look like?”\n\nI detected an unspoken “asshole” at the end of her remark, and I was taken aback.\n\n“It’s so lovely out here,” I ventured.\n\n“We’re not ‘out here.’ We’re inside. And it’s cold. What’s wrong with this thing?” She pounded the set with her knuckles, as if she were boxing its ears.\n\n“So, how long have you been a nun?” As I asked this, it felt as if I were hitting on her, and that we both should be holding long-necked beer bottles and scanning the room for someone hotter.\n\n“Since before you were born, boy,” she answered. “What would you know about it?”\n\nMaybe her harsh personality had got her exiled to the gift shop, to heal herself through selling bookmarks and rosaries. I decided to reach out.\n\n“Is it a hard life?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah, it’s a hard life. I’m a nun. It’s supposed to be a hard life. What are you?”\n\n“I’m a writer,” I said.\n\n“What?”\n\n“I’m a writer.”\n\nShe laughed, because, of course, every nun’s a critic. “That’s good,” she said, still sniggering. “A writer! I like that.”\n\n“So, why did you become a nun?”\n\n“Why? I was sixteen. I had eight brothers and sisters. I liked to pray, I believed in God, I had a calling. End of story.”\n\nI was running out of probing topics. “So, do you ever wish that you’d chosen a different life?” I asked.\n\nShe stared at me in disgust. “Only when my G-D TV doesn’t work!” A final swat caused a grainy image to reappear, and she turned away, absorbed in a studly young doctor’s flirtation with a heavily mascaraed nurse.\n\nAt six-fifteen the next morning, I attended a prayer service, held in a rough wooden chapel that reminded me of a finished basement or a cedary humidor. As the nuns bowed their heads, I did what I do at any religious service: I looked at the floor and mumbled gibberish, except for the word “amen.” I’m a lapsed suburban New Jersey Jew; for my bar mitzvah, I learned the Hebrew portion phonetically, from a recording. Catholicism always seemed more exotic, the way your friends’ parents can seem more interesting than your own; your friends’ parents also have no power over you.\n\nThe service was heartfelt, unadorned, and a little boring. (The nuns, I learned, pray constantly when alone and attend eight services a day.) The room was dim and freezing, lacking any vivid stained glass or theatrical velvet. This is why I’m not a nun, I thought.\n\nThat afternoon, I was allowed a brief audience with a sister who was, if not the Mother Superior, someone highly placed in the nun command. Speaking through a shadowy grille in a central parlor, she was kind and helpful, although she didn’t waste time.\n\n“Welcome to Regina Laudis,” she said. “What are you doing here?”\n\nI paused, and then I told the nun that I was researching a novel about a woman seeking a more prayerful life within convent walls. I suspected that replying “I’m writing a Disney farce about a tramp in a habit” wasn’t the correct response. I asked the sister about the convent’s history, and she supplied basic, informative answers. She was accustomed to ignorant outsiders.\n\nAt first, I decided that deliberately lying to a nun would finally guarantee my passage to Hell. I thought again, and realized that I was being entirely self-absorbed. The nun probably couldn’t care less. She didn’t want any of the things I wanted. She wouldn’t pray for an unlimited supply of chocolate-covered pretzels or brawnier shoulders or the ability to fly. She and I worshipped entirely different Madonnas. I wanted to tempt her with a Snickers bar or a copy of Us magazine, just to see if she’d crack.\n\nAfter two days at the convent, as I prepared to board the bus for home, I caught sight of an older woman carrying a pail of milk from a convent barn. She was wearing mud-spattered rubber boots and a down vest over her habit. She was smiling, and she looked as if she could be Dolores Hart. I decided not to approach her, since she was working hard and probably didn’t need to be asked any more questions about Elvis. She’d done something unheard of for an American: she’d been offered the life of a celebrity and, quietly and politely, she’d said no.\n\nOn my ride back to New York, I read a book called “Lesbian Nuns: Breaking the Silence.” I learned that for gay women, especially those in earlier generations, the cloister had often been a true sanctuary, although the higher-ups would separate lesbian couples, citing a ban on “particular friendships,” which struck me as just plain mean.\n\nAt my next meeting with the Disney people in Los Angeles, I shared all my discoveries, and the information about the lesbian nuns was deemed especially not useful. After still more drafts, my contract expired and wasn’t renewed. Midler had finally abandoned the role, and “Sister Act” was dead, but then, as with Bernadette on that bleak French crag—a miracle!\n\nWhoopi Goldberg was suddenly eager to play the part of Terri, although she asked that the character’s name be changed to Deloris, because, I was told, she’d always wanted to play someone named Deloris. Disney asked me to return to the project, and, despite the prospect of more meetings and more notes and, most likely, a discussion of whether to include a sparkly Day-Glo strawberry-scented Communion wafer in the “Sister Act” Happy Meal, I said yes.\n\nI flew out and was introduced to the director whom the studio had just hired for the movie, Emile Ardolino, a sweet-natured, silver-haired man, who had developed a superb camera technique for capturing ballet for the PBS series “Dance in America,” and who had worked with Scott Rudin on his Oscar-winning documentary about Jacques d’Amboise, “He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin’.” Hollywood had found all of this suspiciously highbrow, so Emile had fought his way to directing the hit Catskills romance “Dirty Dancing.” It was time to begin casting the supporting nuns in “Sister Act,” and I was included in the process.\n\nThe script called for actresses of all shapes and ages, although the Disney executives still squabbled over which nuns should be “fuckable.” Deloris would be supervising the convent choir, so the women auditioning were asked to prepare a song. The film’s musical director was Marc Shaiman, who had worked with Midler for years and was admired for his many film scores; later, he wrote the score for “Hairspray.” To audition for the many singing-nun roles, Marc brought in dozens of veteran Broadway, cabaret, and recording artists. Marc, Scott, Emile, and I were all intravenous users of original-cast CDs, so in that room Ethel Merman was Spider-Man.\n\nThe auditions resembled nothing so much as a Gay Jeopardy Tournament of Champions. Susan Johnson would enter, and we’d all rush to compliment her on her work in “The Most Happy Fella,” a show that opened before most of our panelists were born. We saw Mary Wickes, who had performed opposite Bing Crosby in “White Christmas.” Then an actress appeared, and Emile, his eyes shining, gushed, “I loved you in ‘Donnybrook!’” I bowed to Emile, because I’d never even heard of “Donnybrook!”\n\nMy rewrites were less rewarding. The studio notes poured down: “Deloris needs to be more sympathetic.” “Deloris needs to teach the nuns, but she needs to learn something, too.” “The movie isn’t about nuns, it’s about friends.” “Could Deloris help a needy child?” “Does Deloris need a dog?” “Can we have a montage where Deloris and the nuns bond while painting a colorful anti-drug mural?” The Disney notes were always phrased in the most positive, gee-wouldn’t-it-be-great-if tone, and that was the problem. It was like being trampled to death by cheerleaders.\n\nThe studio deadlocked over casting Whoopi’s love interest. All the insinuated sexual content of the early drafts was long gone, but there was still a by-the-book police officer who supervised Deloris’s transfer to the convent, while developing the most tame, Disneyfied crush. The question was, should the officer be Caucasian or African-American? The studio was in a dither of political correctness mixed with business concerns. Was interracial love a brave step forward, or would black audiences object? What about the white Southern demographic? How could the studio keep every moviegoer happy? Finally, a honcho burst into a meeting, burbling with excitement. “I’ve got it! I’ve got the guy!” he said. “I know exactly who Whoopi’s boyfriend should be—Edward James Olmos!”\n\nI stared at him. Finally, I said, “Excuse me, but do you think that if a black person and a white person have a baby it’s a Hispanic?”\n\n“Yes!” he shouted triumphantly, and to this day I’m not sure if he was kidding. Either way, I couldn’t take the process and the notes and the prospect of all of those nuns hugging, so I quit.\n\nAfter I left, ‘‘Sister Act” was rewritten by half of Southern California. Even as shooting began, writers came and went, and working on the film became a form of jury duty. I’d get occasional updates, from friends and gossip columns, as the star, the studio, and the script erupted. Whoopi, one newspaper reported, had shipped one of the executives a hatchet to bury, and he had sent her a boxed set of heavy brass balls.\n\nBecause I was still a beginner, I desperately wanted to avoid Whining Screenwriter Syndrome. I’d signed a contract and cashed the checks, which were underwriting my work on a new play. It hadn’t occurred to me that, at some point, “Sister Act” would actually be released.\n\nOne day, late in 1991, I was FedExed a final draft of the script. Good or bad, it was no longer my work, so I asked to have my name removed from the credits. The studio was unhappy with that, and I got a series of urgent calls offering me a videocassette of the final cut and asking me to watch it and reconsider. I refused, because, even if the movie was terrific, it wasn’t my script. An executive suggested, “Paul, don’t watch the movie alone. Get a bunch of your friends and have them all come over and make popcorn and watch it together. You’ll have a blast!” I answered, “You know, I could invite my friends over and bring out a dead puppy. And we could toss it around the room, but we really couldn’t say it was flying.”\n\nAfter that exchange, Disney agreed that I could use a pseudonym, pending its approval. I first suggested R. Chasuble, after Reverend Chasuble, the priest in Oscar Wilde’s “The Importance of Being Earnest.” The Disney executive was skeptical. I came up with “Screenplay by Goofy.” He wasn’t amused. So I joined the first name of a character from a story I’d written to my brother’s middle name and arrived at the blandly inoffensive “Joseph Howard.” This was rubber-stamped by the studio, even though it sounds like the name of someone who helped found the Mormon Church.\n\n“Sister Act” opened in May, 1992, and was, improbably, a great success. It hadn’t been an expensive production, so everyone made money, including me. I had nothing to do with the sequel, “Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit,” but there’s a credit line that reads “Based on characters created by Joseph Howard.” A stage version is currently running in London. In interviews, Bette Midler has expressed regret at not appearing in the film. A year after it opened, I ran into one of the original executives on the project, and he said, “Paul, you know, you should really write something for Bette.”\n\n“I did,” I told him.\n\n“What?”\n\n“ ‘Sister Act.’ ”\n\n“Oh, that’s right!” he replied, laughing.\n\nI can’t vouch for the original film, for one reason. “Sister Act” may very well be just fine, but I’ve never been able to watch it.\n\nAs for Dolores Hart, I read recently that she is now the Prioress of Regina Laudis. Also, throughout her decades in the convent, she has kept up her membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She apparently loves being sent DVDs of all the latest movies. As far as I know, she’s the only nun who’s allowed to vote for the Oscars. ♦"
