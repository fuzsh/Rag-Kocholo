Minimal crews were used and every precaution was taken to insure the safety of all participants.\n\nFunny and affecting…it is difficult to take your eyes away – San Francisco Chronicle\n\nExtraordinary cast…it’s going to be difficult to top the theatrical electricity that Coastal Elites generates – CNN\n\nProvocative…funny and heartbreaking…full of clever insight – The Daily Beast"
