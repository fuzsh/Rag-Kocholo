Rudnick, who writes for The New Yorker and has written the screenplays for the films In and Out, Sister Act, and Addams Family Values, shares his hilarious observations on life in New York City and New Jersey, the perils of show business, and dealing with one's family, however crazy they may be. As David Sedaris says, \"There's no book wiser or half as funny as I Shudder.\"",
