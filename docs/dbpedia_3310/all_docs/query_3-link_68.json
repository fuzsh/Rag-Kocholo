Popular for his wickedly funny novels, including I'll Take It and Social Disease, comic screenplays like In & Out and Addams Family Values, and the Augusten Burroughs-like memoir I Shudder, Rudnick remains best known for his cerebral but side-splitting theatrical writing. With echoes of Neil Simon, Thornton Wilder, and Noel Coward, Rudnick plays like I Hate Hamlet, Jeffrey, and The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told are outstanding fixtures of America's comedic canon.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\n\"Paul Rudnick is a champion of truth (and love and great wicked humor) whom we ignore at our peril.\" --David Sedaris, author of Naked, Me Talk Pretty One Day, and Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk\n\nThis definitive collection of Paul Rudnick's plays presents the pinnacle of theatrical hilarity from one of America's great humorists. Popular for his wickedly funny novels, including I'll Take It and Social Disease, comic screenplays like In & Out and Addams Family Values, and the Augusten Burroughs-like memoir I Shudder, Rudnick remains best known for his cerebral but side-splitting theatrical writing. With echoes of Neil Simon, Thornton Wilder, and Noel Coward, Rudnick plays like I Hate Hamlet, Jeffrey, and The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told are outstanding fixtures of America's comedic canon.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nThe definitive collection of theatrical hilarity by one of America's preeminent playwrights and humorists\n\nThe New York Times has proclaimed that \"line by line, Mr. Rudnick may be the funniest writer for the stage in the United States today.\" Now, this collection of his plays will remind readers far and wide of the great influence that Paul Rudnick's comic genius has had on the world of American theater.\n\nHere are I Hate Hamlet, the play that marked Rudnick's Broadway debut; Jeffrey, the long-running off-Broadway smash about gay life during the AIDS crisis of the early '90s; as well as five other onstage gems enlivened by Rudnick's signature rapier wit.\n\nThe Collected Plays of Paul Rudnick is a must-have item for any fan of this theatrical master--and a necessary addition to all courses in dramatic literature."
