        "text": "Poop mouth\n\nChris Parnell is a veteran comedic actor who honed his skills in The Groundlings and on Saturday Night Live, before moving to films like Anchorman and Hot Rod. Lately, he’s appeared in 21 Jump Street, The Five-Year Engagement and he’s a regular cast member on the sitcoms Suburgatory and Archer. Those two shows had already finished for the season when Parnell popped up on the season finale of Saturday Night Live (Kristen Wiig’s final episode) in the sequel to one of the great viral videos of all time, Lazy Sunday 2.\n\nHere’s Chris Parnell on what he looks for in a screenplay, citing scripts for 30 Rock, Anchorman, Archer and Miss Guided, and I also ask him about doing table reads:\n\nChris Parnell on writing his own screenplays, surprising me when he cites confidence issues as the main reason he hasn’t written anything since Saturday Night Live.\n\nHere’s Lazy Sunday 2 (NBC.com):\n\nI have to post the original Lazy Sunday SNL digital short. Like the Dave Chappelle Show’s “Rick James, Bitch!” sketch, it’s still just as brilliant today as it was when it debuted.\n\nThanks to Chris Parnell for his time, and look for more interviews this week on the blog.\n\nGood Luck and Happy Writing,\n\nDan"
