        "text": "We've written before about inventors who lived to regret their own inventions, as well as authors who grew to despise their own work and TV writers who didn't like their own storylines. But what about writers who wish the movies they wrote — or the movies which were inspired by their writing — came out differently, even when critics approved? Here are 15 examples...\n\n1. Truman Capote, author of the novella Breakfast at Tiffany's, hated the film because he wished they'd replaced Audrey Hepburn with Marilyn Monroe (alongside, er, himself).\n\n2. Anthony Burgess, who wrote the book A Clockwork Orange, seemed less-than-enthusiastic about what director Stanley Kubrick turned his novel into.\n\n3. Speaking of Stanley Kubrick haters (okay, maybe that's unfair), Stephen King seems to think the director misunderstood his book, The Shining, when he turned it into a movie.\n\n4. Paul Rudnick, who had previously been known for writing plays and novels, was trying something new when he wrote Sister Act. By the time it came out, he asked for his name to be removed from the project.\n\n5. Michael Ende, the author of the novel The Neverending Story's film is based on, called the movie a \"humungous melodrama of kitsch, commerce, plush, and plastic.\" He held a full-on press conference denouncing and disowning the film he advised on.\n\n6. P.L. Travers, who wrote the book Mary Poppins, despised the film.\n\n7. Ken Kesey, author of the book One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, didn't like the celebrated movie his novel became — despite supposedly having never seen it.\n\n8. Alan Moore, who wrote the comic book V For Vendetta, said \"I've read the screenplay. It's rubbish.\"\n\n9. Roald Dahl, who wrote Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, didn't like the movie it became — despite the film being nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe.\n\n10. Tarantino wrote the script for Natural Born Killers but sold it off. He disliked the end product so much, he begged people not to watch it.\n\n11. Bret Easton Ellis thought his novel, American Psycho, was \"unadaptable,\" calling the film adaptation \"fine.\"\n\n12. Peter Benchley, who authored the Jaws novel, disliked how the movie made people feel about sharks.\n\n13. Alan Moore (from the V For Vendetta entry earier) also wrote the Watchmen comics and said of the movie, \"curse this wretched film and everything connected with it.\"\n\n14. Tom Clancy, who wrote the book Patriot Games is based on, didn't even want his name on the poster because he disliked it so much.\n\n15. Richard Matheson, who wrote the book on which I Am Legend is based, said \"I don't know why Hollywood is fascinated by my book when they never care to film it as I wrote it.\"\n\nDo you have any more to add, or just have thoughts on the above? And do you think any of these writers were right to hate the movie? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nShare This Article"
