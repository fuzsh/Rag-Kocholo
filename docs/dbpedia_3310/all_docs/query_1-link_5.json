        "text": "\"Daniel Henning narrates this story of a decades-long love affair in an over-the-top theatrical manner that is well suited to the dramatic vibe of the story. He depicts a world that is bizarre, glamorous, and tastefully opulent. The writing is witty, explosive, and life affirming. Henning's Farrell is a Midwestern version of an Evelyn Waugh hero; he is clearly gay and very comfortable with who he is. Henning performs the raw, raunchy scenes with the same panache as the tender moments, which are vitally important to the plot. He elicits both tears and laughs as listeners follow Farrell from Yale to his death in his mid-60s.\"\n\nâ Winner of an AudioFile Earphones Award, AudioFile Magazine"
