        "text": "Musicals for spring? Groundbreaking. Pop star Elton John and Playwright Paul Rudnick are teaming up to create a Broadway musical adaption of The Devil Wears Prada.\n\nProducer Kevin McCollum announced the collaboration on Thursday, which is a significant step for the project that has been in the works for two years so far. John will compose the music and Rudnick will write the lyrics and story.\n\nJohn voiced his excitement for the project in a statement. \"I'm a huge fan of both the book and the feature film, and a huge aficionado of the fashion world. I can't wait to sink my musical teeth into this hunk of popular culture.\"\n\nBoth artists have an impressive musical resume under their belts. John has written scores for international smash hit The Lion King, the Tony-winner Billy Elliot and Disney's Aida.\n\nRudnick has written plays Jeffrey and I Hate Hamlet, as well as screenplays Addams Family Values and In & Out, and is a regular contributor to The New Yorker.\n\nThe musical will be taking inspiration from the 2006 film, and 2003 novel by Lauren Weisberger. Released more than 10 years ago, the film starred Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep and grossed $326 million worldwide.\n\nThe story follows Andy Sachs, a bright but naive aspiring journalist who has no idea what she has gotten herself into when she takes a job as the assistant of the legendary and highly demanding editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, Miranda Priestly. She is thrust into the cutthroat and glamourous world of high fashion, and somehow despite all odds manages to succeed.\n\nThe casting and production timeline is yet to be announced."
