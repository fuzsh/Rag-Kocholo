        "text": "“I love sex. It’s just one of the truly great ideas,” the\n\nhero of “Jeffrey” tells us in the film’s opening moments. And for a\n\ngay man like Jeffrey, there was the brief moment of sexual liberation to enjoy,\n\nbefore the specter of AIDS closed down the party. Now Jeffrey (Steven Weber)\n\nfinds his sex life so frightening that he decides to swear off – to become celibate,\n\nand find other interests. It’s not so much that he fears becoming HIV-positive\n\nhimself, although he does; it’s that he fears falling in love with someone who\n\nwill die.\n\nWell,\n\neverybody dies sooner or later, but Jeffrey is protective and can’t see setting\n\nhimself up for a loss.\n\nThat’s\n\nwhy it’s inconvenient one day when he’s working out at the gym, and Steve\n\n(Michael T. Weiss) makes a pass, and the earth shakes. He’s powerfully\n\nattracted to Steve, but fights to suppress his feelings.\n\nJeffrey’s\n\ndilemma was the subject of an Off-Broadway play by Paul Rudnick (a.k.a. Libby\n\nGelman-Waxner, the chatty film columnist for Premiere magazine). Now it’s been\n\nadapted for the screen, again with revue devices, like speeches directly to the\n\naudience, cameo comedy roles and even a walk-on for Mother Teresa.\n\nSeeing\n\nthe saintly Mother, another of Jeffrey’s friends makes a snap judgment:\n\n“She’s had work.” The line comes from the movie’s most sharply drawn\n\nand entertaining character, Sterling (Patrick Stewart, of “Star Trek: The\n\nNext Generation”), whose lover, Darius (Bryan Batt) is a dancer who is\n\nHIV-positive. Sterling is a meticulously maintained middle-age man with a\n\nbarbed tongue, quick intelligence and the belief that love is so rare that when\n\nit comes, you have to accept it on its own terms, even if that means (as it\n\ndoes in Darius’ case) that HIV comes along with it.\n\nJeffrey\n\ncan’t see it that way, and goes through a series of rather unconvincing denials\n\nof love before finally caving in to Steve’s charm and technique. And that’s\n\nbasically what the movie is about – love, risk and loss – apart from the\n\nvignettes, which include Sigourney Weaver as a TV-style self-help guru, and\n\nOlympia Dukakis as the mom of a man who intends to become not merely a woman\n\nbut a lesbian.\n\n“Jeffrey”\n\nis not without its moments, but the movie never really convinced me it knew\n\nwhat it was doing. It’s more a series of sketches and momentary inspirations\n\nthan a story that grows interesting – and to guard against our growing too\n\ninvolved, there are intertitles and other self-conscious devices, including a\n\nsequence where after two men kiss on the screen, the film cuts to two teenage\n\ncouples in an imaginary movie audience who find the kiss hard to deal with.\n\nThis sequence contains the idea for an interesting short film, but as a scene\n\nin this one, it’s all wrong.\n\nAnother\n\nmelancholy problem is illustrated by the movie itself. Although\n\n“death” has long been a code word in poetry for the moment of climax,\n\nthe linking of sex and death by AIDS has made it difficult to tell gay male\n\nlove stories that don’t have at least the possibility of a macabre subtext. One\n\nsolution is to deal with the situation in true drama, as “Longtime\n\nCompanion” and “Philadelphia” did. Another may be to set the\n\nstory back to the years before AIDS."
