        "text": "Whoopi Goldberg has given an update on plans for the third film in the Sister Act series - and has openly begged for Dame Maggie Smith to join her on screen once again.\n\nThe 67-year-old American actress plays Deloris Van Cartier in the 1992 film series - a singer who is placed into witness protection after witnessing a murder and lives under cover as Sister Mary Clarence.\n\nThe film and its 1993 sequel, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, co-stars Kathy Najimy as Sister Mary Patrick, Wendy Makkena – Sister Mary Robert and Dame Maggie as the Reverend Mother.\n\nThree decades on from the last time the ladies donned their habits, a third film in the franchise is in development - and Whoopi is gagging to have 88-year-old Dame Maggie back on board too.\n\nAppearing on Loose Women on Friday, Whoopi said she is willing to film scenes in the UK in order to secure the Downton Abbey star’s return.\n\nShe said: “One of the things I want to make sure I do while I’m here is . . . I want to let Maggie Smith know that I’m holding the part of Mother Superior for you.\n\n“Because I just can’t do it with anybody but you. So if you need me to come over here and shoot and do whatever we have to do, we will do whatever you want us to do.”\n\nShe added: “I’m liking the script. You know we’re all going to do whatever we have to do. I’m trying to secure a director.”\n\nDame Maggie reflected on her time playing the Mother Superior when Sister Act celebrated it’s 25th anniversary in 2017.\n\nShe gushed during an appearance on The View: “I can’t believe this is happening and it was 25 years ago. I would like to say hello to all of the nuns. I feel I must be the oldest nun left.\n\n“Every single nun was wonderful.\n\n“I have such fond memories of when we did those crazy, crazy films. And we laughed and laughed. I can’t believe it’s been 25 years. I send you lots of love and I wish I were with you.”\n\nDisney officially greenlit a third film in the franchise in December 2020 and the movie has been in production since.\n\nWhoopi said at the time: “People may want to see it. So, we’re working diligently to try to figure out how to get the gang together and come back.”\n\nThe film is to be directed by Tim Federle - with Madhuri Shekar on duty as screenwriter.\n\nWhile 65-year-old Sister Mary Patrick actress Kathy said that getting back into costume would be one of the easiest challenges for her in her acting career.\n\nShe said in January 2021: “I like that. No hair, no makeup, no spanks … comfortable shoes. It’s a win-win for me.”\n\nMeanwhile, iconic actress Bette Midler and American triple threat singer, actress and TV host Keke Palmer are both rumoured to be involved in the threequel.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook."
