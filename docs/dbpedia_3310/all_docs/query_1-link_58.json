Mortimer is the normal one of the eccentric Brewster family. Not only does he have a brother who believes himself to be Teddy Roosevelt, Mortimer’s world is rocked when he discovers that his aunts have been poisoning lonely old men for years. In the midst of the mayhem, his other brother, a psychopathic gangster, shows up unexpectedly to add more hysterical complications to the mix. This uproarious farce ran over three years on Broadway during WWII and has become one of the most produced American plays of all time.\n\n​\n\nAll performances 8:00pm, except: *Matinee performance 2:00pm | **Evening performances 7:30pm\n\nSUBSCRIBE TODAY!\n\nDon't miss all the action!

Over the course of six months, filled with laughter, hilarious misadventures, and the occasional liquid refreshment, these middle-aged women successfully bond and find the confidence to jumpstart their new lives.\n\n​\n\nAll performances 8:00pm, except: *Matinee performance 2:00pm | **Evening performances 7:30pm\n\nSilent Sky\n\nBy Lauren Gunderson\n\n​\n\nJanuary 11, 12, 17**, 18, 19, 20*, 24**, 25, 26, 27*, 2019\n\n​\n\nAstonishing discoveries await Henrietta Leavitt as she maps distant stars in galaxies beyond our own.

In this blend of science, history, family ties, and fragile love, a passionate young woman must map her own passage through a society determined to keep a woman in her place. This true story of Henrietta and other early 20th century female “computers” at Harvard Observatory details their extraordinary work and highlights the enormous impact they had on the advancement of science.\n\n​\n\nAll performances 8:00pm, except: *Matinee performance 2:00pm | **Evening performances 7:30pm\n\nOld Love\n\nBy Norm Foster\n\n​\n\nMarch 1, 2, 7**, 8, 9, 10*, 14**, 15, 16, 17*, 2019\n\n​\n\nA story of courtship, rekindled romance and the indomitability of hope, Old Love spans three decades, and half-a-dozen meetings between Bud, a salesman, and Molly, his boss's wife. One of them is smitten from the very first meeting - the other - less so. Straightforward, easy and funny, Canada's pre-eminent comic playwright Norm Foster has another hit with this clever and witty heartwarming journey celebrating the never-ending pursuit of love.\n\n​\n\nAll performances 8:00pm, except: *Matinee performance 2:00pm | **Evening performances 7:30pm\n\nI Hate Hamlet\n\nBy Paul Rudnick\n\n​\n\nApril 19, 20, 25**, 26, 27, 28*, May 2**, 3, 4, 5*, 2019\n\n​\n\nAndrew Rally seems to have it all: celebrity and acclaim form his starring role in a hit television series; a beautiful girlfriend; the perfect New York apartment; and the chance to play Hamlet in Central Park.
