        "text": "A new, much-hyped YA fantasy Queen of the Tearling hits book store shelves tomorrow, and Emma Watson is preparing to assume the role of Kelsea.\n\nQueen of the Tearling by debut author Erika Johansen follows Kelsea as she’s thrust into her mother’s former kingdom to become ruler. She becomes disgusted with some of her mother’s actions and looks to fix her mistakes once and for all, but naturally there are consequences to such big decisions.\n\nThe book-to-film rights have been picked up by Warner Bros., and Harry Potter producer David Heyman is set to produce this new series. In addition, Hermione Granger actress Emma Watson is already attached to star.\n\nQueen of the Tearling publisher Harper-Collins confirms today that Mark L. Smith is writing the screenplay. His previous screenwriting credits include 2007’s Vacancy and 2009’s The Hole. According to The Daily Mail, Smith will be turning his screenplay over to Heyman later this month.\n\nSmith just finished work on The Revenant, which will star Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy.\n\nAlso in The Daily Mail’s report we learn that Watson will be going through lots of training for the role of Kelsea. The actress will “learn to ride a horse, bulk up (not too much), and do weeks of combat training (including knife work and swordsmanship). She’ll also be taught how to snare rabbits and practice climbing trees.”\n\nFilming may begin as early as next year, but The Daily Mail says that they’re hoping to line up a big name director who can be available at the same time as Watson.\n\nArticle Continues Below\n\nWill you pick up ‘Queen of the Tearling’ tomorrow?\n\nYou can order it now via Amazon.\n\nQueen of the Tearling is the first in a series of three books. In a new Q&A provided to us by the publisher, Johansen teases what’s to come in books two and three.\n\n“In Book 2, the reader will watch Mortmesne invade the Tearling, and see Kelsea’s situation grow bleaker by the day as the Mort draw closer to the city,” the author says. “The reader will also see events that led up to the Crossing, and why humanity took such a desperate gamble. In Book 3, by contrast, the reader will get to see what happened after the Crossing: how the Tearling was formed and how it degenerated. Meanwhile, Kelsea and the Red Queen will form an uneasy alliance against a greater adversary.”"
