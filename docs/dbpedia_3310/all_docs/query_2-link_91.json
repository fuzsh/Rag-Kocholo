        "text": "In May 29 1992, was released one classic movie of the 90’s, ‘Sister Act’. The movie is about a a nightclub singer who is forced to take refuge from the mob in a convent, where she ends up turning the convent choir into a soulful chorus complete with a Motown repertoire, until the sudden celebrity of the choir jeopardizes her identity.\n\nStars: Whoopi Goldberg, Maggie Smith, Kathy Najimy\n\nDirector: Emile Ardolino\n\nTo celebrate the 30th anniversary, here are some of the curiosities about this movie.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg hired Carrie Fisher to re-write her dialogue, which led to many arguments with Disney executives. Fisher later told Goldberg, “You’re getting into a pissing contest with people who have actual dicks.”\n\nBecause many scenes were shot in Reno, the cast members would often stay in their nun outfits and wander off the set to pull some pranks at the casinos, bars, clubs, and strip clubs. Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena tell a story that they once ordered wine and fries to their hotel room and answered the door in their nun outfits while loud porn was playing on the television just to mess with the hotel staff.\n\nThe Rolling Stone Magazine cover shown during the closing credits is real.\n\nThis movie was later turned into a stage musical. Whoopi Goldberg appeared in a limited run of the London performance, this time playing Mother Superior.\n\nThe church in which Whoopi Goldberg takes refuge is St. Paul’s Catholic Church located at 221 Valley Street (near Church Street) in San Francisco’s Noe Valley district.\n\nOne of the neighborhood teenage girls was played by Desreta Jackson, who played the young version of Celie, Whoopi Goldberg’s character in The Color Purple (1985).\n\nDeloris’ girl group is named the Ronelles, a combination of the names of two other girl groups from the 1960s, the Ronettes and the Shirelles.\n\nScreenwriter Paul Rudnick wrote the original script back in 1987 and Bette Midler was supposed to be cast for the role of Deloris. After Midler had left the project, the script underwent several re-writes by screenwriters Carrie Fisher, Eleanor Bergstein, Nancy Meyers, Jim Cash, Jack Epps, Jr., and Robert Harling.\n\nPedro Almodóvar turned down an offer to direct the movie.\n\nDeloris, like Whoopi Goldberg, has no eyebrows throughout the film."
