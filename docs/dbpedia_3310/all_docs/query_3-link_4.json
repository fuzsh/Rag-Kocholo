        "text": "Letâs be honest, there are not many writers â gay or straight â of books, plays or screenplays, who are as hysterically funny as Paul Rudnick. In plays including âJeffreyâ and âThe Most Fabulous Story Ever Told,â movies such as âSister Act,â âAddams Family Valuesâ and âIn & Out,â as well as the novels âSocial Diseaseâ and âIâll Take Itâ (my personal favorite), Rudnick has kept us in stitches from start to finish. Combining wit and wisdom, Rudnick also gives us much to think about while we are laughing. His new novel, “Playing The Palace” (Berkley/Jove, 2021), is no exception, and it couldnât be more timely. Nice, gay, Jewish, New Jersey guy Carter has an unexpected encounter with nice, gay, British royal Prince Edgar and a regal love affair is launched, presented in true rom-com fashion. Rudnick was kind enough to answer a few questions shortly before the May 2021 publication of the book.\n\nThe publication of your new novel âPlaying The Palaceâ is especially timely with all the recent increased interest in the Royals due to Harry and Meganâs departure. What do you think the Royals would think of âPlaying The Palace?â\n\nIâd hope that Meghan and Harry would enjoy âPlaying The Palace,â especially because the book celebrates a romance between an American and a royal. No one knows for sure if the royals watch âThe Crown,â but Iâd like to picture copies of âPlaying The Palaceâ on a few royal nightstands and tucked into royal tote bags!\n\nThere is an abundance of âroyalty jokes,â as they are called on page 75. Are these the kinds of things youâve been curating over the years or were they written specifically for the book?\n\nHereâs something Iâve always wondered, which inspired âPlaying The Palaceâ: if a commoner falls in love with a royal, what are the rules? Wearing a crown and waving from a balcony can be both glorious and bizarre: are royals allowed to talk about this? A sense of humor is essential for romance, so in âPlaying The Palace,â NYC event planner Carter Ogden and Prince Edgar love to exchange wisecracks, some of which Iâve hoarded over the years, but most of which popped up as I wrote the book. Iâve always wanted to know: if someoneâs involved with a prince, is it okay to say, âItâs your turn to unload the dishwasher, Your Highness?â\n\nIHOP figures prominently in the book. Are you a pancake patron?\n\nIâm a HUGE fan of IHOP. I grew up in New Jersey, where a trip to a local IHOP was always a treat. One of the reasons I fell in love with my partner was our mutual addiction to IHOP (one of our first dates was at a Philadelphia IHOP.) IHOPs represent a great American innovation: breakfast all day.\n\nWhatâs your favorite syrup in the IHOP syrup tray?\n\nIâm partial to the maple flavored syrup but I enjoy looking at all the varieties in the syrup caddy. My partner and I recently visited a socially distanced IHOP and it felt wonderful.\n\nAnother recurring theme in the book is the presence of Carterâs spirit guide, the late SCOTUS justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg. How do you think she would feel about being a character in âPlaying The Palace?â\n\nIâd hope that Justice Ginsberg would have a great time with âPlaying The Palace,â in which she appears as an icon of justice, hard work and equality. She had a great sense of humor and was a passionate fan of the arts (especially opera and the theater.) Carter Ogden reveres Ruth, as a down-to-earth hero, and he confides in a treasured photograph of her. I picture Justice Ginsberg in heaven, laughing and passing around her copy of “Playing The Palace!”\n\nEveryone is funny, especially James and Queen Catherine. How do you decide who gets the funniest lines when you are writing?\n\nAs a comic writer, I like all of my characters to be funny. James and Queen Catherine are both fiendishly smart, and use humor for joy and balance, while other characters, who take themselves a bit too seriously, become funny in their own ways. Carter and Edgar share a sense of humor, which is a great basis for their love â Carterâs more extravagantly funny, while Edgarâs stealthy, so they make an ideal team.\n\nIn chapters 13 and 16 you demonstrate an admirably tasteful way of writing scenes of sexual intimacy. What are the challenges and rewards of writing sex scenes?\n\nWriting sex scenes can be tricky and can easily turn clunky. I wanted the sex in âPlaying The Palaceâ to be passionate and lighthearted, as an extension of Carterâs and Edgarâs feelings for each other. While leaving certain aspects to the readerâs imagination, I wanted to make sure that Carter and Edgar had a great time, whether in Carterâs tiny NYC apartment bedroom or onboard the royal jet.\n\nLate in the book, there is a chapter that turns serious and provides a kind of historical perspective. Please say something about your decision to include that.\n\nThere have been many wonderful books about coming out, but I wanted âPlaying The Palaceâ to be a celebration of exuberantly open and empowered gay lives. On the other hand, I needed an awareness of how recently such lives have become possible. Throughout history, there have always been LGBTQ people, whoâve often faced overwhelming prejudice. There have also been valiant LGBTQ heroes, whoâve fought tirelessly for equality. Carter and Edgar recognize their privilege, and they honor their forebears.\n\nOn the whole, the tone of the novel is such that it could appeal to younger readers. What would it mean to you to reach that prized YA readership?\n\nI welcome any and all readers. I especially love presenting the possibility of joyous queer romance to younger readers. Iâve written YA and found these readers to be open, curious and wildly smart, so Iâd be thrilled if they shared âPlaying The Palaceâ with every possible generation.\n\nGiven your history in cinema, who would you like to see portray Carter and Edgar in a movie version of âPlaying The Palace?â\n\nIf âPlaying The Palaceâ ever became a movie, there are so many wonderful actors â including more and more out actors â who could play the leads. Iâm too superstitious to make predictions, but I will say that the fantastically talented Michael Urie has just done an amazing job of recording the audio version of âPlaying The Palace.â\n\nI keep picturing Dame Judi Dench as Queen Catherine. Is she the actress you would choose for that role?\n\nLike every writer alive, Iâd be delighted to have Judi Dench play any role sheâd like. Dame Judi is regal, a little scary and hilarious, all qualities which she shares with Queen Catherine.\n\nDo you foresee more books with Carter and Edgar?\n\nIn âPlaying The Palaceâ Carter and Edgar are at the beginning of their life together, which promises to be an epic adventure. Iâd love to chart their progress, so who knows?\n\nHave you started thinking about your next book, movie or stage project?\n\nIâm in the middle of writing a new novel and Iâve got a play that will premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse in California next year. There are TV and movie projects in the works as well, but as Iâve said, Iâm too superstitious to go into details just yet. I did write a monologue which was just performed by the superb Nathan Lane at a Broadway theater, before a socially distanced audience of healthcare and theater workers, as part of the NY PopsUp Festival, a series of events devoted to welcoming people back to live performances. Onwards!"
