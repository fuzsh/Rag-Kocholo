        "text": "Live theatre is often described as the ultimate collaborative art form. The actors must work together to bring the plot to life while the technicians and musicians behind the scenes must also coordinate with the stage talent to create a seamless experience. Just as important is the collaboration between the company and the audience. An engaged, receptive audience feeds the creative energy of the cast and crew, which in turn helps to create a more rich experience for everyone. From amateur and professional community theatre companies to outstanding university performing arts programs, here in Cenla, we are blessed with many opportunities for participating in the theatre—on stage, behind the scenes, in the orchestra pit and in the audience!\n\nCelebrating 80 seasons in 2018, City Park Players was founded as the “Alexandria Little Theatre” in 1938 as a nonprofit organization. CPP produced live theatre for the local community sporadically during the World War II years. By fall of 1948, CPP began regularly scheduling a stellar lineup of comedies and dramas for local residents.\n\nCity Park Players is pleased to kick off their 80th Season with a poignant comedy/drama by Norm Foster, entitled “Kiss the Moon, Kiss the Sun”. Directed by Elizabeth Hilgerson and Halli Watson, this touching comedy features local actors Mike White as Robert, Meghan Smith as Holly, Melissa Savage as Claire, Travis Paul as Simon, and Dave Strong as the Doctor. Playwright Norm Foster creates an emotionally-charged atmosphere that explores the relationship between a disabled man and a young pregnant woman. The show will run February 22nd through March 4th.\n\nCPP continues its season with Neil Simon’s classic “Barefoot in the Park”, April 12th through 22nd, under the direction of Jim Leggett and Michael Dalme. “An Audition for a Murder” by Lee Mueller, directed by Alana Pate, will be performed June 7th through 17th. “Proof” by David Auburn, directed by Jared Guillory, will be presented August 2nd through 12th. The season rounds out with “I Hate Hamlet” by Paul Rudnick, featured October 11th through 21st, directed by Jim Weinzettle and Dave Strong.\n\nPerformance times are Thursdays through Saturdays at 7:30pm with Sunday matinees at 2:30pm at the Hearn Stage in Downtown Alexandria. Tickets are on sale now at www.cpptheatre.com and will be available 30 minutes before each performance in the lobby of the theatre. Auditions for each show will be held approximately two months in advance of performance dates and will be posted at cpptheatre.com and on CPP’s Facebook page at facebook.com/pg/cpptheatre. For reservations and more, please e-mail [email protected] or call (318) 484-4478.\n\nIn 2018, Lagniappe Theatre Company marks a decade in Cenla. From a simple idea written on a notebook while founders Karen and Ross Schexnayder were on tour with the “Smoke on the Mountain” show in the mountains of North Carolina, Lagniappe has evolved to become one of Central Louisiana’s premier theatre companies, offering six productions a year, seen by over 15,000 patrons annually. In addition, Lagniappe teaches nearly 300 students per school semester while serving 4,000 students at local schools with educational outreach productions. Through their educational efforts, local talent has gone on to Broadway and lucrative film careers, giving residents not only a high quality theatrical experience, but also a place where parents and children can appear on the stage together in a positive and uplifting environment.\n\nLagniappe Theatre holds to the philosophy that the theatre should be an inclusive place where all are welcome, and strives to build a team atmosphere. There are no stars at Lagniappe Theatre. Every actor, every volunteer, every person is part of a giant family that cannot work without its other parts. While the mentality of many in the world is to only focus on making productions, Lagniappe Theatre wishes to create great experiences that lead to great productions. Lagniappe Theatre is a rarity in being a for-profit theatre company. Nearly all regional and community theatres in the country are non-profit organizations. So, without government aid, grants, or financial donations, how does Lagniappe Theatre make the business of theatre happen? The people of Central Louisiana are the answer. People are looking for a place where their values are honored, and their entertainment dollar is well spent. Lagniappe Theatre has made it its mission to serve this community with entertainment that speaks to the residents and patrons.\n\nSince its inception, Lagniappe has presented audience favorites like the “Smoke on the Mountain” trilogy, giant musicals such as “Shrek the Musical” (which broke all box office sale records for Coughlin-Saunders Performing Arts Center, seeing a whopping 6,000 patrons during its run), “Sister Act”, “The Wizard of Oz”, and the locally flavored Christmas show, the “Cenla Christmas Spectacular”.

With an emphasis on acting, and using simple stage settings, Empty Space Players has produced quality productions, from contemporary to classic plays and musicals, to ancient Greek and classic Shakespeare tragedies and comedies. Offering a major production each semester, ESP draws its talent from LSUA students, faculty and staff, and community participants. All are invited to become involved, whether onstage or backstage, as ESP strives to offer quality educational theatre to audiences in Central Louisiana.\n\nEmpty Space Players was started by Clay Kirkland in the Fall semester of 1990 as a student club. His goal simply was to start a Theatre Arts program at the university with student-produced shows, eventually building a Theatre curriculum. The first ESP production was in Fall 1990—a double-bill of two one-act plays, “Suppressed Desires” and “Impromptu”. This was followed in Spring 1991 with two full-length plays: “The Rainmaker” in March and “Talking With” in April. Early productions were performed in the Student Center using make-shift lighting. After years of producing shows in any available space or on any available stage in Cenla, ESP finally produced its first production in 2011 on its own stage in the newly constructed Mulder Hall on the LSUA campus. The Black Box Theatre, later renamed the Richard Gwartney Theatre, became the home of ESP. Since its 1990 start, Empty Space Players has been led by professors Clay Kirkland, Jim Stacy, Richard Gwartney, Rhonda Shook, and, presently, Robert Harper.\n\nThe Empty Space Players 2017-2018 season concludes with the free-to-all “Un-Valentine’s Day Open Mic/Poetry Night” on February 13th, and a production of Yasmina Reza’s biting comedy “Life X 3”, from April 5th through 15th.

Under the direction of Laine Berry Miller, who holds a BFA in Musical Theatre from the highly acclaimed University of Cincinnati’s College-Conservatory of Music and is a member of Actors Equity Association, LBM Productions is dedicated to discovering and developing talent in Central Louisiana through training, productions and a Broadway connection. Staying connected with Broadway’s best is important to LBM Productions’ mission. LBM strives to bring Broadway performers to Cenla for performances and workshops, while also providing opportunities for talented local musical theatre students—Louisiana Broadway Magic—to perform and train in professional venues such as Disneyworld and the national Junior Theater Festival in Atlanta. This past January, Louisiana Broadway Magic brought back the trophy for “Excellence in Acting” with their performance of “XANADU, Jr.”\n\nLBM’s 2018 Season starts out with “ANNIE, Jr.” Join performers ages 7 through 18 who will bring to life the story of Annie, Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan and all the colorful characters with familiar songs, including “Hard Knock Life,” “Little Girls,” and everyone’s favorite: “Tomorrow”.

The three-week “Musical Theatre Intensive” camp for ages 8 through 18 runs June 4th through 24th and culminates in a full production of “Pirates of Penzance, Jr.” Camps will be held at the Alexandria Mall, and the final production will be presented at LSUA’s Richard Gwartney Theatre.

Tammy and a few others felt that Central Louisiana needed a performing group, primarily made up of women, to do cutting edge theater. They did several edgy performances, including a wonderful production of “Vagina Monologues” at the former site of Spirits. In the same spirit, they decided to solicit original scripts, written by local authors, to be produced in Alexandria. These world premieres began in 2004 with the first SSP Ten-Minute Play Festival.\n\nWith Tammy’s departure from Central Louisiana, the board changed to include more playwrights, as well as individuals interested in directing, acting and pursuing the goal of development theater (creation and production of original works). The Ten-Minute Play Festival has continued now for 14 years. Outside judges were solicited to provide some professional objectivity to the choice of manuscripts. The result has been a steady increase in the quality of the writing over the years. An adventurous public has returned again and again to see just what is hitting the stage, sometimes far different in theme and content than other theater productions. This year’s Festival theme is “Coming Home” and the production is set for May 17th through 21st.\n\nAlthough some authors have submitted manuscripts year after year for decades, there has been a constant influx of neophyte writers, some of whom have gone on to become very accomplished. The SSP organization has always remained a 501(c)3 in good standing and has requested and received numerous DAF grants over the years. While some board members have come and gone, the goal has always been to “keep the drama on the stage.”\n\nThe whole concept of developmental theater, while not unique, is generally found only in large metropolitan areas, not smaller communities without major academic institutions. SSP has nurtured writers, directors and actors, who have all started in the modest format of a ten-minute play, but have gone on to perform full length productions with other regional theaters. Some of the plays have also gone on to readings and productions outside of Louisiana. A collection of plays has also been featured in a self-published anthology, “Disparate Voices,” compiled and edited by Dr. Holcombe and available on Amazon.\n\nIn addition to the ten-minute plays, there has been an annual production of four one-act plays for the last five years. This more challenging format has also attracted seasoned and novice writers who have produced compelling works for the stage.

This beloved classic is about a con man, Harold Hill, who travels from town to town selling the idea of the need for a boy’s band to keep the kids out of trouble. “Professor” Harold Hill poses as a band organizer and leader. His fast-talking charm deceives many of the citizens of River City, Iowa into buying instruments and band uniforms for their sons. His plans to skip town with the cash are foiled when he falls for Marian, the librarian and town music teacher, who transforms him into a respectable citizen.\n\nThe public is welcomed and encouraged to be a part of the tlc family as a spectator, performer or patron.
