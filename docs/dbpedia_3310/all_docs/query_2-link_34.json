        "text": "FADE IN:\n\nINT. ST. ANNE'S ACADEMY - AKRON, OHIO - CLASSROOM\n\nWe are in a parochial school classroom, in the late\n\nSixties. The children all wear uniforms and sit at little\n\ndesks. SISTER IMMACULATA stands at the front of the room;\n\nshe is a middle-aged nun, very severe. The children are\n\nall terrified of her.\n\nSISTER IMMACULATA\n\nWho can name all the Apostles? Yes?\n\nANGLE ON CHRISTINE CARTER\n\nA thirteen-year-old girl sitting at a desk. She raises\n\nher hand.\n\nSISTER IMMACULATA\n\nChristine?\n\nCHRISTINE:\n\nSister, may I be excused?\n\nSISTER IMMACULATA\n\nChristine...\n\nCHRISTINE:\n\nIt's an emergency. Real bad.\n\nSister Immaculata nods, pursing her lips. Christine\n\nstands and heads for the door.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. GIRLS ROOM\n\nChristine is now in the deserted St. Anne's girls room.\n\nShe is standing on tiptoes, looking in the mirror. She has\n\ntaken her hair out of its neat barrettes; she is combing it\n\nout. She applies lipstick.\n\nChristine reaches into her schoolbag; she pulls out a\n\nstack of glittery bracelets and slips them on. She\n\nunbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse.\n\nShe sprays herself with dime store cologne.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HALLWAY\n\nChristine opens the girls' room door; she looks both ways.\n\nNo one is around; she saunters down the hall.\n\nPage 2.\n\nANGLE ON A DOOR MARKED BROOM CLOSET\n\nChristine opens this door. She looks into the closet.\n\nThere is a very nervous thirteen-year-old BOY waiting for\n\nher inside.\n\nCHRISTINE:\n\nHi, Jimmy.\n\nChristine slips inside the closet and closes the door\n\nbehind her.\n\nANGLE ON SISTER IMMACULATA\n\nStriding down the hall, with a bloodthirsty look in her\n\neye, and a nasty-looking wooden ruler in her hand. She\n\nflings open the broom closet door,\n\nANGLE ON CHRISTINE AND JIMMY\n\nin the broom closet. Jimmy's face is covered with\n\nlipstick. Christine's hair is awry. The couple has\n\nclearly been making out.\n\nSISTER IMMACULATA\n\n(outraged)\n\nMiss Christine Carter! Again! Don't\n\nyou know what happens to girls like you?\n\nDon't you know what they become?\n\nINT. CHRISTY'S APARTMENT - ANGLE ON A LARGE, TATTERED\n\nPOSTER-NIGHT (TODAY)\n\nTaped over a crack on a wall. The poster shows a\n\nglittering CHRISTY VAN CARTIER: singing star of a fifth-\n\nrate Vegas lounge. Christy wears tight spangles and a\n\nmajor wig on the poster. She has clearly lived up, or\n\ndown, to all of Sister Immaculata's expectations.\n\nThe CAMERA PANS through the dark bedroom in which the\n\nposter hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window,\n\ncasting a red and blue haze over the premises. A dressing\n\nroom table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail\n\npolish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry\n\nare scattered everywhere.\n\nWe hear the movement of BED SPRINGS as someone sits up in\n\nthe dark.\n\nCHRISTY'S VOICE\n\nCome on, Vince -- hold me a minute.\n\nVINCE'S VOICE\n\nI'd love to. babe -- but I've got to go.\n\nIt was great. Like usual.\n\nCHRISTY'S VOICE\n\nIt was twenty minutes. Like usual.\n\nPage 3.\n\nVINCE'S VOICE\n\nThe best.\n\nVINCE LAROCCA stands at the mirror, adjusting his clothing\n\nand checking his hair. Vince is a powerful, charismatic\n\nman who rules an organized crime empire with personal\n\nmagnetism and threat. Vince's hold over Christy is\n\nobvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous\n\none minute, ruthless and dangerous the next.\n\nVINCE:\n\n(half to Christy, half\n\nto the mirror)\n\nYou are something else.\n\nChristy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette.\n\nCHRISTY:\n\nCome on -- stay. Just a little. We can\n\ntalk, I'll get a pizza. Pizza in bed,\n\nwe'll have fun. And you still haven't\n\ntold me what happened. What did she say?\n\nVINCE:\n\nWhat did who say?\n\nCHRISTY:\n\nWho? The other woman. Your wife.\n\nVince turns to face Christy, turning on the charm.\n\nVINCE:\n\nYou are so damn sexy.\n\nCHRISTY:\n\nVince...\n\nVINCE:\n\nHow did I get so lucky? What is it now,\n\nfive years we've been together? Who do I\n\nthank?\n\nCHRISTY:\n\n(not buying it)\n\nToday was the deadline, Vince.\n\nVince sits on the bed. He takes Christy's hand, and\n\nkisses it.\n\nVINCE:\n\nI want us to be together. Like people.\n\nHonest, decent people. In the eyes of\n\nGod. Babe, today... I went to\n\nconfession.\n\nCHRISTY:\n\nYou did what?\n\nPage 4.\n\nVINCE:\n\nFor the first time in I don't know how\n\nlong. I wanted everything done right.\n\nOpen and above board. I told Father\n\nAntonelli I was in love. I told him it\n\nwas a special love, for all the ages.\n\nCHRISTY:\n\n(starting to fall for\n\nit)\n\nYou said that? And what did he say?\n\nDid he say you could leave her? Did he\n\nsay we'd be happy?\n\nVINCE:\n\n(looking deep into her\n\neyes)\n\nHe said that if I got a divorce I'd burn\n\nin Hell. For all eternity.\n\nVince kisses Christy's hands again and drops turns away\n\nand starts putting on his shoes.\n\nCHRISTY:\n\nWhat?\n\n(outraged)\n\nVINCE:\n\nYou want me to go against a priest? Get\n\nexcommunicated? You think I'm nuts?\n\nCHRISTY:\n\nYou bastard!"
