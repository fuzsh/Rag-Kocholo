        "text": "The ad in the Times real-estate listings said “medieval duplex,” which was intriguing, unless “medieval” referred to the plumbing. It was 1987 and I was apartment hunting, so I arranged to meet the broker at a brownstone just off Washington Square. The apartment was four steep flights up, and the walls of the final landing were a rough stucco, with an odd-shaped niche high in the wall for a candle or a skull, just outside a rounded, rough-hewn door with elaborate ornamental hinges.\n\nThe apartment in question consisted of the full, narrow top floor, and I was smitten. The theatrical plasterwork continued throughout, and there was a bay window with a window seat, flanked by portholes of thick, leaded Mediterranean-blue stained glass, all overlooking the leafy corner of Washington Square Park where fanatics play chess. There was a micro-kitchen, one tiny closet, and a cramped, nineteen-seventies-vintage Pepto-Bismol-pink tiled bathroom, but none of this mattered, thanks to a vaulted skylight, a fireplace, assorted archways, and a hidden, winding staircase. The stairs led to the roof, where I found a large deck. A sun-bleached oak ship’s wheel, six feet in diameter, leaned against the outer wall of a hobbit-scale cottage-—one room, with a beamed ceiling. The broker was chatty, and she mentioned that the apartment had once been the home of John Barrymore.\n\nHere’s how long ago this was: I didn’t snap up the place that very minute but told the broker that I’d phone her the next morning. That night, I called my agent, Helen Merrill, a German woman whose accent had only deepened with her decades in New York. When I told her about the apartment, she remarked, “Perhaps you vill find my hairpins.” It seemed that Helen, thirty years earlier, had conducted an affair on the premises with Barrymore’s son-in-law, an erstwhile actor married to the troubled Diana Barrymore, whose mother was a poetess aptly named Michael Strange. Helen recalled the apartment, if not the son-in-law, in fond detail, and the karma became overwhelming. The next day, I met with Winston Kulok, the affable owner of the town house, who with his family occupied the first two floors, and the lease on the Barrymore place was mine.\n\nAs I settled in, I researched my new home. Barrymore had taken up residence in 1917, just before he began performing his legendary Hamlet uptown. His film career at that point was limited to locally shot silent movies, including an early take on “Moby-Dick,” which may have been the source of the ship’s wheel. Barrymore had remodelled the apartment as a Gothic retreat, christening it the Alchemist’s Corner. He had installed all the false beams, monastery-inspired ironwork, and stained glass, which made his lair resemble a stage set for an Agatha Christie whodunnit in summer stock. The rooftop had been his masterpiece, and had at one time included a garden, with cedar trees, a slate walkway, and a reflecting pool. Tons of soil had to be hoisted up by pulley, and eventually caused a collapse into the rooms below. Of Barrymore’s vision only the cottage remained; he’d likened it to a roost overlooking the spires of Paris.\n\nI read up on Barrymore’s life—particularly in his entertainingly fraudulent and entirely ghostwritten autobiography and in “Good Night, Sweet Prince,” an equally fanciful work, devised, soon after the star’s death, by his close friend Gene Fowler. There was a story that, following Barrymore’s demise, his buddies snatched his body from the morgue and propped it upright in a chair as a gag.\n\nBarrymore was born into an illustrious family of American performers, which included his sister Ethel and his brother Lionel, and John had been nicknamed the Great Profile for his beauty and acclaimed as a classical actor of extraordinary personal magnetism and range. He was later drawn to Hollywood, appearing as Katharine Hepburn’s wayward father in “A Bill of Divorcement,” a mature Mercutio in an all-star “Romeo and Juliet,” and, most uproariously, a bulging-eyed, fire-breathing producer, opposite Carole Lombard, in the screwball gem “Twentieth Century.” Perhaps his signature role was that of a handsome, dissolute jewel thief, redeemed by his brief, ethereal passion for Greta Garbo in the sumptuous M-G-M melodrama “Grand Hotel.” The film exemplified the public perception of Barrymore as a gifted, doomed wastrel.\n\nThe more I absorbed, and the more months I spent under Barrymore’s bastard Jacobean roof, the more I felt moved to write something set at the address. Someone or something had led me to these quarters and would not be denied. I began a novel about a character named Andrew Rally, the young star of “L.A. Medical,” a fatuous network gold mine. Andrew moves into the Barrymore apartment just as he’s about to play Hamlet at Shakespeare in the Park. He gets apprehensive about returning to the stage, and he’s ready to flee to Los Angeles when the ghost of Barrymore appears. I soon realized that the material would make a better play than a novel, as it took place primarily in a single location and was overrun with theatrical types. I surrendered, to God or Satan or the will of Barrymore, and completed a draft of a two-act comedy called “I Hate Hamlet.”\n\nFollowing a successful out-of-town workshop in Saratoga, a group of producers decided to bring the play to Broadway. The characters by then included Deirdre, Andrew’s love interest and an ardent twenty-nine-year-old virgin; Gary Peter Lefkowitz, Andrew’s pal and writer-producer-director, who is given to remarks like “You don’t do art, you buy it”; Felicia, a gregarious real-estate broker; and Andrew’s agent, Lillian, a flinty but softhearted German émigrée, a tribute to Helen Merrill. In an early scene, Lillian asks her companions if she might smoke, and Deirdre implores her not to because it’s such an unhealthy addiction. Lillian replies, “I know, I really must stop.” Deirdre asks, “Smoking?” and Lillian says, “No—asking.”\n\nMost of the cast were New York stage actors, including Evan Handler as Andrew and the whiskey-voiced Caroline Aaron as Felicia. Lillian was to be played by Celeste Holm, who was practically the sole surviving cast member of “All About Eve.” Adam Arkin would be Gary. Our great challenge was in casting the role of John Barrymore—ghost, thespian, and lecher. If you’ve written a star, you need a star. From Fanny Brice to Ray Charles, the impersonator must reignite the legend. The audience needed to believe that whoever played Barrymore, from the instant he stepped onstage, was an Olympian Hamlet, a devastating seducer, and everyone’s favorite scoundrel. “I Hate Hamlet” was a romantic comedy by an unknown playwright, being directed by the very young Michael Engler, so it wasn’t easy to find, persuade, and sign a Barrymore.\n\nThe search finally arrived at Nicol Williamson, a Scotsman who’d achieved fame several decades earlier on the London stage, as a self-loathing solicitor in John Osborne’s “Inadmissible Evidence.” Nicol had played a savage Hamlet in England and New York, and he’d become a reliable character presence in such films as “Robin and Marian” and “Excalibur”; in the latter, he’d been a memorably baroque Merlin. Onstage, Nicol was notorious. At a curtain call during the Broadway run of the musical “Rex,” in which Nicol was Henry VIII, he’d slapped a fellow-actor, who Nicol felt was drawing focus. Our casting director had heard countless tales of similar misbehavior and advised us to acquire Nicol’s services “only over my dead body.” We didn’t listen.\n\nNicol accepted the role, and an introductory lunch at a midtown restaurant was arranged between our Barrymore, the producing team, the director, and me. Like any decent star, Nicol arrived last. He was a tall, shambling man, with a bald pate bookended by buttresses of reddish curls. His eyes were doleful and piercing, as if he’d seen far too much, enjoyed most of it, and had somehow managed to avoid arrest. His basso voice was gorgeously Shakespearean.\n\n“Hallo, mates!” he boomed, and we all grinned and exchanged delighted glances, because Nicol was, if nothing else, everything an American wants a reprobate, Continental stage personality to be. He beguiled everyone with tales of beautiful women, show business, and air travel. He was an incipient tyrant, an Amin or an Evita, caught at an early stage, where charm was of the essence in crafting a grateful, adoring cult. Clearly, here was Barrymore. After many hours, as the group departed, Nicol slung a long arm over my shoulders and said, “Dear fellow, I know you’ve heard tattle, but don’t believe a word. I’m in top, fighting form. And I haven’t touched a drop in over a year.”\n\nI chose to believe it, despite a quick backward glance at the table, which held a brandy snifter, a wine bottle, and a beer mug, all of which had been recently emptied into Nicol.\n\nThe early rehearsal period was, as early rehearsal periods often are, a promising Eden. Nicol embraced every company member, and everyone seemed happy with the play. Celeste provided delectable anecdotes. In 1949, she was co-starring with Loretta Young in the uplifting film “Come to the Stable,” in which the pair appeared as radiant, tennis-playing nuns, founding a children’s hospital in Bethlehem, Connecticut. In reality, years earlier, Loretta had secretly given birth to Clark Gable’s illegitimate daughter. For publicity purposes, she’d then contrived to remain virginal by adopting her own child. All of this subterfuge had made Loretta an even more devout Catholic, and during the filming, whenever anyone used profanity, she had the person drop a nickel into a cuss box, with the proceeds shipped to Vatican-related charities. One afternoon, Ethel Merman visited the set and was told of the cuss box. She yanked a bill from her wallet, located Celeste’s co-star, and brayed, “Here’s ten bucks, Loretta. Go fuck yourself.”\n\nIn our second week, Nicol invited me to his small, bare Hell’s Kitchen pied-à-terre, where he hunched over a Hohner organ and played and bleated a song cycle that he’d composed, based on his divorce. Each number was devoted to a militant, obscene hatred of his ex-wife and assorted female members of her family. After each ditty excoriating another ungrateful bitch, Nicol would turn to me eagerly for an opinion. “Wow,” I kept repeating. “She sounds awful.”\n\n“Yes!” Nicol thundered each time. “That’s exactly right!”\n\nEarly in the play, the real-estate agent suggests that Andrew hold a séance to make contact with the ghost of Barrymore. An attempt is made, which, though apparently unsuccessful, later results in the great man’s return to earth. “Am I dead?” the ghost inquires. “Or just incredibly drunk?” To prepare for this scene, the cast decided to stage an actual séance in my apartment. We hired a psychic, a frazzled woman with a matching perm who, I suspected, owned more than one cat and far more than one scented candle.\n\nIn my apartment, everyone gathered around a massive oak library table. I’d furnished the place in the Barrymore manner, with burnished leather couches, heavily carved and gilded thrones, the sort of antiqued coats of arms found in any suburban steak house, and a tarnished, tilting brass candelabra. I served reasonably priced wine, microwave popcorn, and Pepperidge Farm Milanos.\n\nThe meter was running, so I encouraged the psychic to aim for a direct hit on Barrymore. We all clasped hands, and she shut her eyes, clanged her finger cymbals, and began a rhythmic moaning that was either a trance state or a belated Kaddish for my grandmother. She directed us to concentrate our spiritual energy on the door that opened on the stairs to the rooftop. Nicol, who’d cornered the reasonably priced wine, staggered to his feet and, in a sepulchral wail worthy of any character on a “Simpsons” Halloween special, bellowed, “Come!”\n\nNothing. We all sat up straighter and glared even more aggressively at the door. “COME!” Nicol bellowed again, raising his arms in Dionysian welcome.\n\nStill nothing. We were all quivering with ecstatic, ectoplasmic yearning, and Nicol howled “COOOME!!!” with such ferocity that I feared for his sexual partners.\n\nThe door moved a fraction of an inch. It didn’t swing open, and Nicol had certainly been producing some Hindenburg-quality hot air, but who knows? I’ve often wondered if everything that followed was the result of that séance, if just maybe we’d actually unleashed some cackling, chaos-seeking, heedless Barrymore imp.\n\nI continued to rewrite the play, but with each passing week Nicol grew more paranoid. His complaint was essentially that he was being asked to appear onstage with other people. He took to calling me at 3 A.M., always opening with a solicitous “I didn’t wake you, did I?” He’d had a brainstorm: what would I think if Evan left the show and Nicol played the parts of both Andrew and Barrymore simultaneously? I couldn’t even begin to formulate a response, since not only was Evan first-rate but the characters had many scenes together, including a ripsnorting duel that climaxed the first act. As I sputtered, Nicol jumped in: “Oh, I know just what you’re thinking. Of course I could play both parts easily, but Andrew is intended to be what, twenty-six years old? And you’re wondering, Will the audience accept me as twenty-six? It might be a concern, but it’s not a film—from the stage, there’d be no problem at all!” Nicol was then fifty-two.\n\nOur preview performances began. The set, by Tony Straiges, was a grander approximation of my apartment, resembling the great hall of some fantasy castle, with tapestries, a large oil portrait of Nicol as Barrymore, and, on a wooden stand, an enormous parchment-covered globe that, in the early moments of Act II, opened to reveal a wet bar.\n\nNicol was sensational. In a luxuriant wig and sculpted black tunic and tights, he was utterly persuasive as a dashing, brutally comic Barrymore. He commanded the stage, and seemed to be having the time of his life. He was possessed by Barrymore, both in the play’s more burlesque moments and in his speeches from “Hamlet,” which he delivered with eloquence and simplicity, as a lesson for Andrew and the rest of us. It was too good to last.\n\nAfter the first few shows, Nicol embarked on a self-destructive binge. He repeatedly propositioned the stage manager, and when she resisted his groping advances he called the management and demanded that she be fired. This didn’t happen, but the atmosphere backstage became poisonous. The cast posed for a raft of promotional photographs, and Nicol tried to block the release of any pictures in which he appeared with another actor. Then he began murmuring directions, while onstage, to other cast members: “Is that what you’re doing?,” “God, that’s awful,” and worse. During scenes in which the script called for him to hover, as a ghost, and eavesdrop on the action, he would leave the stage. He gradually and deliberately alienated almost everyone, until the production became a war zone. One night, I stopped by his dressing room to make a final attempt to repair our relationship. When I entered, he took a wobbly swing at me, aimed at my head and connecting with my shoulder. I was more surprised than hurt; it was like being assaulted by a sleeping bag. Further revisions to the script became impossible.\n\nDuring the opening-night performance, at the Walter Kerr Theatre, I sat crouched on the carpeted steps at the rear of the balcony. Like any opening-night crowd, the audience was appreciative and vocal. As I watched, I thought, My play is opening tonight on Broadway. This was a glorious and yet conventional dream, and that was the problem. Conventional dreams, such as Broadway openings, weddings, and elections, aren’t about joy; they’re about expectations, pressure, and blind panic.\n\nThe cast party was at Tavern on the Green. Everyone’s friends and family were in attendance, and Nicol ruled the night. He still wasn’t speaking to many of the others, but there he was, in a white dinner jacket, grabbing the microphone and forcing the band to back him on assorted Tom Jones hits. It was like attending the coronation of a sadistic, self-proclaimed emperor, with toasts encouraged by armed guards. I longed for Nicol to be a caddish yet magnetic rogue and to win everyone back. But he couldn’t. Owing to drink and bitterness and rage, he needed to be loathed by friends and adored by strangers.\n\nThe reviews were mixed. “Mixed reviews” is a phrase like “creative differences” or “of unknown origin”; it’s what the government tells the widow. Nicol was accused of genius, slumming, and everything in between. Reports of his bad behavior had been rampant, so his notices were like bulletins from the front, hoping to make sense of a battle still in progress.\n\nNow that we had opened, the fun truly began. During the first act, Barrymore’s ghost arrives to coax and browbeat Andrew into playing Hamlet. Andrew is ambivalent and wary. While he hates playing opposite a hand puppet, in his lucrative ads for Trailburst Nuggets breakfast cereal, he’s terrified of the stage, the tights, and the Bard. His friend Gary backs him up: “I mean, it’s not even dinner theatre. They sell whole-wheat brownies and little bags of nuts and raisins. It’s snack theatre. It’s Shakespeare for squirrels.”\n\nBarrymore scoffs, asking Andrew, “Can you possibly believe that every prospective Hamlet did not tremble and pale and bolt? Hamlet will change you, Andrew, make no mistake. What are you to be—artist, or lunchbox?”\n\n“Get out!” Andrew wails.\n\n“En garde!” cries Barrymore, now brandishing a gleaming sword.\n\nI wasn’t there on the Thursday night, a month or so after the opening, when Nicol went for broke. I had gone to see another show, and at a restaurant afterward a friend rushed over to my table, asking, “Oh my God! Have you heard anything? Is he really hurt? Is he O.K.?”\n\n“Who? What are you talking about?” I asked.\n\n“Tonight! At your play! Nicol Williamson stabbed Evan Handler!”\n\nDuring the swordplay scene, Nicol, it seemed, had actually struck his co-star. Evan, quite wisely, had left the stage, the performance, and, ultimately, the production. His understudy had finished the show that night.\n\nLater, another friend came running up to me. “Oh my God,” he said. “It’s so tragic!”\n\n“Nicol?” I asked. “And my play?”\n\n“No! Jerzy Kosinski! He’s dead!” Kosinski had committed suicide in his bathtub. The next day, Kosinski’s grisly end shared billing with the “I Hate Hamlet” fracas on the front page of the Times. In the Post’s weekend edition, a photograph of the duel filled the entire front page, under the headline “‘HAMLET’ ACTOR STORMS OFF STAGE AFTER CO-STAR WHACKS HIM IN BUTT.” There was coverage all over the world, and TV news crews stood outside the theatre every night. I learned to say “No comment” in many languages.\n\nEvan Handler wanted to bring Nicol and the production up on charges. A meeting was called, and the producers and I tried to determine a course of action. Should we fire Nicol? We realized that he had been brilliantly, maliciously sly: because of all the publicity, he now was the show, and no other star in his right mind would step into his role. The situation was impossible. At an earlier meeting, two of our producers, the gentlest and most well-intentioned men, became so frustrated that a fistfight broke out. The brawl ended within seconds, with instant apologies all around. Even when he wasn’t in the room, Nicol was winning.\n\nEvan’s understudy took over, and the show wobbled along for a few more weeks. Nicol was in clover. He began leading the audiences in sing-alongs of “Happy Days Are Here Again,” and, at the curtain calls, he liked to instruct the crowd to “Head home and enjoy a nice juicy slice of sexual intercourse!” The Tony Award nominations were announced around this time, and while Adam Arkin received a nod Nicol did not. He was livid, and took to haranguing the nominating committee from the stage.\n\nI attended the closing-night performance, and afterward I went backstage. On a small table outside Nicol’s dressing room there was a bottle containing his blood-pressure medication. I considered replacing the pills with—what? Arsenic? Rat poison? What could possibly kill him?\n\nI had never spent time around a world-class, drain-the-keg loon before. Nicol belonged to a boisterous, selfish, élite cadre of mostly British actors, the Angry Young Men of the nineteen-fifties and sixties. They were the working-class blokes who’d banished the decorum of Gielgud and Olivier—brawlers who went for birds and lager and, at least onstage, a grittier realism. This reckless brotherhood included Richard Burton, Richard Harris, and Peter O’Toole, all of whom binged their way to the top. But Nicol had been denied the screen stardom, and the eventual knighthood, that his peers had won, and this can’t have pleased him.\n\nNicol believed, I think, that if he could just get to the theatre, if he could only step onstage, he’d be fine. Some nights, he’d saunter in at five, even ten minutes after eight, knowing that we’d hold the curtain. But there was one performance when he’d overslept, or passed out in his apartment, and his understudy had gone on. Although we hadn’t spoken in weeks, the next day Nicol called me, assuring me that everything was fine, and that he’d be on that evening. Then he abruptly hung up. For the first time, he’d sounded shaken.\n\nAfter the final performance, I had no intention of talking to Nicol. I was still too angry. As I was heading upstairs, to bid farewell to the more lucid actors, the door to Nicol’s dressing room swung open. He stood there, a soused, lunatic, fifty-two-year-old Hamlet. We stared at each other. Nicol finally spoke, and his tone was both kind and accusing. He said, “You knew this was going to happen.” And then he smiled and shut the door. ♦"
