        "text": "Primary Stages is committed to supporting playwrights at all stages of their careers and providing an artistic home where they can hone their craft and develop their latest works.\n\nAn integral part of this initiative is our Dorothy Strelsin New American Writers Group, which has been fostering the creation of new works by emerging playwrights for 28 years. Throughout its history, the Group has helped launch the careers of over 60 writers and supported the creation of over 165 new plays. The last five years have seen 27 productions of plays developed in the Group. Notable titles include The Seven Year Disappear by Jordan Seavey, Hatef*ck by Rehana Lew Mirza, We The Invisibles by Susan Soon He Stanton, Eden Prairie by Mat Smart, God Said This by Leah Nanako Winkler, Amerikin and Proof of Love by Chisa Hutchinson, and Queen of Basel by Hillary Bettis.\n\nLed by our artistic staff, the Group is composed of eight up-and-coming writers who participate in the program for a three-year cycle. This multi-year commitment provides writers with the security of an artistic home and enables our staff to form intimate relationships with these artists and give them the personal attention they need to advance their work. The Group meets on a weekly basis from September through April, giving writers the opportunity to discuss their current projects and offer each other constructive feedback in a supportive environment. The goal for each writer is to complete a new play by the end of the spring session, which is then given a public reading in our Fresh Ink Reading Series. The group members also receive a week-long retreat at Bennington College. Our 2023/24 Group members include Benjamin Benne, Oscar A. L. Cabrera, Fedna Jacquet, Eric Micha Holmes, Jonathan Norton, Madhuri Shekar, and Calamity West.\n\nPrimary Stages continues to support our Dorothy Strelsin New American Writers Group alumni in their future as artists. Alumni collaborations include commissions of Rehana Lew Mirza's A People's Guide to History in the Time of Here and Now and Susan Soon He Stanton's 2021 Living Room Commission. In 2019, Primary Stages produced Leah Nanako Winkler's God Said This, which was began in DSNAWG and then went to on to feature in the Actors Theater of Louisville's Humana Festival and received the 2018 Yale Drama Prize.\n\nOur 2024 Fresh Ink Reading Series will be held from April 3-12 at 59E59 Theaters.\n\nAll readings are free and open to the public.
