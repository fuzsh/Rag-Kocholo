        "text": "EVEN after throwing his back out, the playwright-turned-film-director Kenneth Lonergan can come up with more snappy rejoinders than most people can on a good day. Sitting gingerly several weeks ago in the Greenwich Village apartment he shares with his wife, the actress J. Smith-Cameron, Mr. Lonergan brightened when asked why, after writing two successful off-Broadway plays and several Hollywood scripts (including the 1999 hit ''Analyze This''), he had decided to write and direct his own independent film, ''You Can Count on Me.''\n\n''I didn't want to take any chances that this particular script would be taken away from me or rewritten,'' he replied. ''That's an experience that you submit to as a screenwriter, and you're willing to cut your emotional ties the minute they say, 'Gee, I think you should make the main character a gorilla trainer rather than a rocket scientist.' This is the first movie I ever wrote just for me, as they say on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show.' ''\n\nMr. Lonergan's resolve paid off: ''You Can Count on Me,'' his directorial debut, won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award and shared the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in January. The film, which opened on Friday, is a moving but unsentimental look at the thorny bond between a grown brother and sister who were orphaned as children. The sister, Sammy (Laura Linney), is a responsible young mother who lives in a small town and has an 8-year-old son (Rory Culkin). The brother, Terry (Mark Ruffalo), is a charming but lost drifter who comes home to visit her when he needs money.\n\nAs a writer, Mr. Lonergan is known for the veracity of both his dialogue and his characters. ''Kenny is regarded as an extraordinary writer in the theater community,'' said Mark Brokaw, who directed Mr. Lonergan's 1996 Off-Broadway play ''This Is Our Youth.'' ''He's all about language, and yet his work is not about spectacle or showy plots. His characters feel real because he has such compassion for the people he writes about.''\n\nThough the 38-year-old Mr. Lonergan likes to cultivate a curmudgeonly aura (''my friends think I'm crabby,'' he says with relish), he is warm and informal: everyone calls him ''Kenny.'' But he also has a quiet toughness that sustained him through years of struggling to get his plays and scripts produced. ''People say that Kenny is shy, but don't let it fool you,'' said Matthew Broderick, a close friend since high school, who also stars in ''You Can Count on Me.'' ''He was never really intimidated by anyone in power.''\n\nThat's come in handy as Mr. Lonergan has managed to carve a niche for himself in both the film and the theater worlds, a balancing act he shares with several playwrights these days who also write film scripts, like Paul Rudnick and Wendy Wasserstein. There is also, however, a smaller but ever-growing number of playwrights who are, with Mr. Lonergan, crossing over to become film directors -- from such well-established figures as David Mamet and Mike Leigh to the up-and-comers Tim Blake Nelson and Conor McPherson.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
