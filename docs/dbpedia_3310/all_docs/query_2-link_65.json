        "text": "What is a Movie or TV Show Logline?\n\nA logline is more than a quick overview of a story. It is what will engage the target audience in the first place. It’s the premise in its simplest form. Ultimately, it’s a sum-up of the story so that the audience, whoever they are, will get it immediately. And there are many famous logline examples that serve to show how loglines can brilliantly summarize the movie or TV series at hand.\n\nThis is the power of a great logline. It’s the ability to encapsulate the idea in a pithy, easily translatable manner. Therefore, a logline has to be short and succinct, ideally no more than one sentence.\n\nThe most important part of a logline though is to have an idea of what the story is about in no uncertain terms. There will be elements of mystery as to where the plot will go, of course. But the logline must get across the key, distinctive elements.\n\nThe main purpose of a logline is to hook the audience in. That audience may be those scrolling through Netflix. Or it might be a studio executive working their way through a pile of scripts. Thusly, the importance of the logline is clear. It’s how to hook someone into wanting to know more.\n\nHow Do You Create a Great Logline?\n\nA logline is a concise and striking summary of your screenplay in one or two sentences. It describes the main purpose of your story. Moreover, it makes perfectly clear what the goal of the protagonist is and the stakes of reaching that goal.\n\nThe three key ingredients of the perfect logline are:\n\nThe Protagonist\n\nThe Goal\n\nThe Antagonist Force\n\nWith these three elements you must set up the protagonist within the context of the story world, the stakes and the catalyst for change. In simple terms, you’re telling the audience the story’s setting and its main drive. But the three above elements make sure that your logline is functioning in conveying the story at hand.\n\nThe logline must generate intrigue and grab the attention of the reader. But truly, the most important value of a good logline is its ability to help you diagnose the quality of your story.\n\nIt’s very simple: If after trying it many times you cannot write a good logline for your story, there’s something missing in your original idea.\n\nWriting a logline forces you to answer questions like:\n\nWho is my protagonist?\n\nWhat do they want?\n\nWho/What is against my protagonist?\n\nWhy is vital for my protagonist to achieve their goal?\n\nIn this article, we’re going to look at how famous logline examples illustrate the power and purpose of loglines. But for more depth on how to write the perfect logline, check out our ultimate loglines guide.\n\nFamous Logline Examples and What They Teach\n\nThe best, most famous loglines illustrate the strength of the idea in question and the power of a great logline.\n\nFamous loglines are able to teach a great deal about what a logline can do so effectively. This is because we know the story at hand. In addition, they typically demonstrate how loglines can and should convey great ideas.\n\nSo what’s the use of looking at famous logline examples for a screenwriter? Well, sometimes in the thick of writing, the complexity of the story can overwhelm. Seeing how great films and TV series boil down to their most fundamental essence is a vital tool for screenwriters.\n\nOne might know these films and TV series intimately. But in seeing their simple story pitch, one can see their essential mechanical elements. This isn’t just about seeing how these stories were pitched, it’s about seeing the core ingredients that make them strong ideas.\n\nSo let’s look at 105 famous loglines. Referring to this list when constructing your own logline will help deconstruct the purpose of a logline overall. Moreover, it will allow you to bask in the glory of some great famous loglines and the ideas they convey.\n\n105 Famous Logline Examples\n\nFamous Logline Examples in Film\n\nFamous Logline Examples in Film – Drama\n\n1.
