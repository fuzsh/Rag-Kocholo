As she prepares to host a Christmas Eve party for her friends, she recalls from her own perspective that fated night when she first met the Grinch, and the strange turn of events her life has taken for the past 40 years. Lombardo’s hysterically funny, wildly irreverent, and heartfelt parody is an absolute must-see for adult theatre-goers this holiday season!\n\nThe Tony Award winning design team includes David Gallo (sets) Ken Billington (lighting) and Jess Goldstein (costumes). Sound design will be Bart Fasbender and wigs will be designed by Charles LaPointe.\n\nJennifer Simard, who was recently announced to join the cast of Hello Dolly in the spring, is a Tony Award nominated actress who has been making New York audiences laugh for over twenty years.

Off-Broadway credits include the original casts of Forbidden Broadway SVU, The Thing About Men, and I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change. In addition to being one of Broadway and Off-Broadway's best loved actresses, Jennifer has also been seen on both the large and small screen.

On television, she has enjoyed roles on \"The Good Wife,\" \"Law & Order,\" \"Law & Order SVU,\" \"The King Of Queens,\" and will soon appear in an upcoming episode of \"Younger\" starring Sutton Foster.\n\nPlaywright Matthew Lombardo has a history of writing strong leading roles for women having penned the plays Tea at Five for Kate Mulgrew, Looped for Valerie Harper (which garnered her a Tony Award nomination) and High for Kathleen Turner. Director Carl Andress is mostly known for directing Charles Busch plays including The Divine Sister, Die! Mommy Die! and The Third Story.\n\nWHO’S HOLIDAY! is being produced by R.
