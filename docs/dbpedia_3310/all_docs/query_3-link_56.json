        "text": "âTugs at the heartâ¦ Rudnick delivers [a] multiple-laughs-per-paragraph pace.â âThe New York Times\n\nâReaders rejoice! In Rudnickâs exuberant novel, style is unlimited.â âBooklist (starred review)\n\nâA hot contender for best banter in a beach readâ¦Prepare to be delighted.ââThe Washington Post\n\n\"I loved Farrell Covington and the Limits of Style. Just ate up every word; it will make a Rudnick fan out of every reader. No funnier, wiser or more charming book will come out this year, I guarantee. So what are you waiting for? Get it!â âAndrew Sean Greer, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Less and Less Is Lost\n\nâThis is precisely the novel Iâve been dying for this year, a case study in elegant, honest tragicomedy. And itâs also by the genuinely hilarious Paul Rudnick, so you know at least every other sentence is going to lay you out on your side, gasping for air, or at least another martini.â âGary Shteyngart, New York Times bestselling author of Our Country Friends\n\nâRudnick writes with such engaging wit, side-eyed perceptiveness, and barbed elan, with such irrepressible life, that before you quite notice the shadings of loss, mortality and poignant retrospection in his new novel, they have already touched you with their power.â âMichael Chabon\n\nâIf you believe that there should be more pleasure, more style (high and low) and more genuine wit in this world, then read Farrell Covington and the Limits of Style. If you don't, I am sorry for you and if anyone cares for you, even a little, they will run out and get you this joyful and snarky, life-affirming, love-celebrating novel.â âAmy Bloom, New York Times bestselling author of In Love\n\nâA gay love story for the ages from one of the great comic voices of his generationâ¦Is it a spoiler to say there are no limits? At least not to Rudnickâs ability to brilliantly elegize and entertain.â âKirkus (starred review)\n\nâRudnick has long been one of New Yorkâs most puckish wits, but now he shows how wisdom can back it up.â âAirmail"
