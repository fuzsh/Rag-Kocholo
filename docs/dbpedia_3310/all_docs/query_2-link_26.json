        "text": "It was an emotional day at The View as Whoopi Goldberg reunited with the cast of Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit.\n\nThe Oscar-winning star broke down in tears as she reunited with stars like Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, and Sheryl Lee Ralph, as well as crew members from the 1993 comedy. A recreation of the “Joyful, Joyful” choir scene had everyone in their feelings.\n\nTanya Trotter took over the solo performance in Lauryn Hill’s absence. Goldberg appeared in her nun outfit, joining the choir. Ryan Toby, who played Ahmal in the film, performed with Goldberg’s daughter. The performers were joined by students from the LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts.\n\nFollowing the performance, Goldberg was overwhelmed with emotions and Ralph reached out to embrace her.\n\nSister Act 2: Back in the Habit was directed by Bill Duke and released in 1993. The film was a follow-up to 1992’s Sister Act and was loosely based on the life of Crenshaw High School choir instructor Iris Stevenson.\n\nThe sequel follows Deloris Van Cartier (Goldberg) who has become a famous performer in Las Vegas since her time posing as a nun to hide from the mob, presenting an entire dinner show based on her experience. Deloris is reunited with her friends Sisters Mary Patrick, Mary Robert, and Mary Lazarus, who have come to her to ask for her help in saving their school.\n\nCheck out the photo gallery of the Sister Act 2 reunion below."
