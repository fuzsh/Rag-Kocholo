        "text": "RUDNICK\n\nTo me, one of the signs of a great writer is whether he or she can hold my interest while writing about a topic I really have no innate interest in.\n\nIf someone can write about sports without resorting to clichés, jargon and catch phrases, I’m happy to read his or her work. John McPhee can write about almost anything — geology, oranges, freight transportation — and it’s entertaining. Ditto for New Yorker essayist and author Susan Orlean and best-selling author Mary Roach, who imbues everything she writes about, from corpses to astronauts, with her trademark humor.\n\nAdd New York Times food writer Kim Severson to the list.\n\nI’m not someone who peruses recipes and can recite the names of famous chefs and their restaurants. I don’t trust recipes; even if I follow them step-by-step, I don’t have faith the dish will turn out the way it’s supposed to.\n\nBut I always look for Ms. Severson’s byline in the New York Times’ weekly Dining section, because her stories are always so interesting. Yes, they’re about food, but they’re also about people. They’re human interest stories. She wrote about film critic Roger Ebert, who, because he had surgery to remove most of his jaw, can no longer eat but still cooks. She wrote about returning to Italy to track the evolution of her Italian grandmother’s recipe for red sauce. Then there was the article about how she and fellow food-writer Julia Moskin had a cooking contest:\n\nCreate a dinner party for six, spending only $50. Co-worker Frank Bruni, the famed New York Times restaurant critic, attended both dinners and critiqued them.\n\nSo I made a point of reading her recently published book, “Spoon Fed: How Eight Cooks Saved My Life.” It’s a mix of memoir, coming-out story and cook profiles, with a dash of recipes for good measure. g\n\nShe writes about leaving the Anchorage Daily News to be a food writer for the a San Francisco Chronicle, then leaving the S Chronicle to be a food writer at the New C York Times — an enviable career path. Y\n\nHer life story, and the lessons she\n\nlearned, are told through the prism of l\n\neight women in the food world: e\n\nMarion Cunningham, Alice Waters,\n\nMRL Ruth Reichl, Marcella Hazan, Edna Lewis, Leah Chase, Rachael Ray and Ms. Severson’s mother, Anne-Marie\n\nMZhs Zappa Severson. These women teach her patience and self-confidence, to stay true to herself, and that she can\n\nalways start over. (Each letter of the a\n\nbook’s title on the cover reflects a\n\nbr recipe shared by the various women, ranging from waffles to gumbo z’herbes to matzo brei to her mother’s spaghetti and meatballs.)\n\nMs. Severson is honest about her faults, writing about her insecurities in and out of the newsroom. And while she talks about her struggles with selfacceptance and alcoholism, she’s not lurid. One of the more moving chapters deals with prayer and faith — in life and in the kitchen.\n\nThese women sound like women I’d like to hang out with.\n\n“The women in this book shined the\n\nen light on what was ahead for me when I couldn’t find the way,” Ms. Severson writes. “They showed me that food is the best antidote for anything life throws at you. They became my tour guide, helping me figure out what I really believed in, how to re-make my life and re-create a family, and, finally, how to face death.”\n\nOne of the funnier stories she shares is about doing an article on Alice Waters, an advocate and leader for fresh and locally grown food. The two shop at a farmers market for ingredients and then go back to Ms. Severson’s Brooklyn home so Ms. Waters can cook a meal. But in the excitement of doing the story and being with a food icon such as Ms. Waters, Ms. Severson neglected to call her partner, Katia Hetter, who’s home pregnant with their daughter, to let her know they were on their way. So she arrives home only to discover her partner’s in the tub, and chicken nuggets and frozen French fries are in the toaster oven.\n\n“Spoon Fed” is not like any other memoir I’ve read. While revelatory, it’s far from sensationalistic. It’s warm and friendly, like hanging out in the kitchen hearing stories from a friend.\n\nAnd, thank God, Ms. Severson’s also doing the cooking.\n\nJersey boy\n\nPaul Rudnick’s style of humor could perhaps be described as flamboyantly observational.\n\n“Isn’t life absurd?” he seems to ask. “Look at this — and this.”\n\nMr. Rudnik is known for his plays “I Hate Hamlet” and “Jeffrey,” which was also made into a movie, and for his screenplays for “In & Out,” “Addams Family Values” and “Sister Act.” (The last movie went through so many rewrites he had his name removed from the credits, not thinking it would become such a success.)\n\nHis book, “I Shudder and Other Reactions to Life, Death, and New Jersey,” is as good as watching one of his plays or movies. There’s an essay about the early days of William Ivey Long, before he won five Tony Awards for costuming Broadway shows, and essays about Mr. Rudnick’s early days, too. (His Aunt Hilda was the person to sit next to during a Passover seder, he writes, “because she’d murmur, ‘Oh, come on already, get those Jews out of Egypt. Let’s eat!’”)\n\nWe get to read about his inspiration for writing “I Hate Hamlet” and then about the problems created by an egomaniacal actor with a drinking problem who disrupted the show on-stage and off. He writes about staying at a convent while writing the script for “Sister Act,” and about writing and filming “Addams Family Values” and “In & Out.”\n\nInterspersed throughout are “I Shudder” essays, written by Mr. Rudnick’s alter ego, Elyot Vionnet, who rails against overuse of cell phones, people who steal your taxi ride and hipsters celebrating Christmas.\n\nWhile some may treasure “Good Enough to Eat” (his essay on junk food that inspired the cover of “I Shudder” showing four connected Peeps so yellow they’re almost radioactive), I enjoyed “Life and Death and New Jersey.” In that one essay, he manages to talk about being a teen in Jersey, losing friends to AIDS, having to take his driving test six times, and his father’s death.\n\nEven while Mr. Rudnick is yanking on your heartstrings, he’s tickling your funny bone.\n\nTake, for example, this sentence: “Here’s what I know about death and grieving: None of it makes any sense, although I will always cherish the words of a woman who spoke at a friend’s memorial and began her affectionate remarks by saying, ‘God knows, Ed was cheap.’”\n\nThis Jersey boy makes me laugh.\n\nWith Mr. Rudnick on the planet, the word is a much funnier, more fanciful place. ¦\n\nKim Severson on Florida:\n\n“I just never imagined that one of my kitchen heroes, one of the women who helped teach me to cook… would end up in a Florida condo, forced to shop at a grocery store with tomatoes as pale as pink carnations and hybrid artichokes as big as a baby’s head.\n\n“Aside from me, a couple of people working the registers and a younger man helping his mother shop, most everyone moving through the wide aisles were well on their way to 70 or beyond. A big display of inflatable alligators and lobsters — beach toys for the grandkids — hung over the entrance, serenaded by what must be the last working Muzak tape in the country.\n\n“To shop here, Marcella had to make her way past a thousand items that one would never find in the markets of Bologna and Venice, where she used to shop and where in my fantasy she would be living out her days. There were jars of sticky-looking bruschetta topping and bags of pre-shredded ‘Italian blend’ cheese. All the meat had been cut into uniform sizes and laid to rest on white foam trays. There was not a butcher in sight.”\n\nKim Severson on food:\n\n“Can the cold facts of the natural world explain that magic moment that comes when everyone at the table has just settled in to eat? Or the one that comes just when the delicious rush of sharing a good meal has ended? We sit around like grinning, milk-drunk babies who’ve just pulled away from the breast. Laughing comes easy. People glow. Out of nowhere, you have compassion for the jerk who was bugging you before dinner, so you ask if he’d like seconds on the braised artichokes. You belong to everyone else at the table and they belong to you.\n\n“You can’t create that kind of communion alone, and you can’t create it without food.”\n\nPaul Rudnick on Florida:\n\n“John drove our rental car out to Heritage Acres, the retirement community where the couple was living. My mother and Hilda had been down for a few visits, and while Hilda had been polite, the place was my mother’s worst nightmare. ‘It’s like a warehouse for old people,’ she’d told me, ‘where all they do, all day long, is play golf and compare their diseases. I love my sister, but if I had to live there, I’d cut my throat.’\n\n“John and I drove through the gates, and we saw hundreds of identical, single story bungalows, lined up in neat rows beside narrow canals. The sun was merciless, and there weren’t many trees. Everything seemed to be covered with stucco and painted the color of a faded Band-Aid. Heritage Acres was like a well-tended terrorist training camp, filled with 85-year-old women in roomy, quilted floral housecoats, and pot-bellied, cigar-smoking men in Sansabelt slacks.”\n\nPaul Rudnick on food:"
