Is it an accurate portrayal of convent life? Do nuns really have this much fun?\n\nAnyway, the show has lots of praise for this frankly delightful nun comedy. Obviously Whoopi is a megastar here, but how wonderful is Maggie Smith? Honestly, all of these nuns are terrific, they should star in remakes of other movies. Like, wouldn’t it be great to see Nuns in Wonderland, or The Nuns and the Chocolate Factory, or Nun Transformers: Age of Extinction?\n\nPrayers up for Laci and Matt, who we haven’t heard from since all that unpleasantness in Reno.\n\nTime stamps:\n\n00:03:02 — Our histories with Sister Act\n\n00:06:40 — Pre-movie predictions\n\n00:10:07 — History segment: Development of Sister Act, from original conception by screenwriter Paul Rudnick to the casting of Bette Midler; career overview of star Whoopi Goldberg\n\n00:30:56 — In-depth movie discussion\n\n01:24:47 — Final thoughts and star ratings\n\nArtwork by Laci Roth.\n\nMusic by Rural Route Nine.
