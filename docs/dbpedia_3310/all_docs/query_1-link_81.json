        "text": "Tony and Emmy Award winner Kristin Chenoweth will soon be heading to Disney+ to star in a brand new comedy.\n\nAccording to Deadline, actress Kristin Chenoweth has signed on to star in the brand new Disney+ series, The Biggest Star In Appleton.\n\nBilled as a half-hour, single camera comedy, the series focuses on Carol Dannhauser — a wife, mother, and waitress residing in Wisconsin who couldn’t be more devoted to her family.\n\nAs much as she loves them though, she “finds her deepest satisfaction in small town stardom at the local community theater.”\n\nCarol may be the town’s biggest star on the stage, but she’ll soon find herself up against some stiff competition in the form of Tara Hubley — a struggling New York chorus girl who winds up having to move back home and could soon threaten Carol’s status as Appleton’s star performer.\n\nThe upcoming series is created and written by playwright and screenwriter Paul Rudnick, whose previous credits include penning hits like Sister Act and Addams Family Values.\n\nProducing on the project is Dan Jinks (American Beauty) who previously worked with Rudnick on TV Land’s I Shudder.\n\nJinks, of course, also produced ABC’s short-lived but well beloved series, Pushing Daisies, which also co-starred Chenoweth.\n\nArticle Continues Below\n\nFor her part, Kristin Chenoweth will star as Carol in addition to serving as a producer on the project alongside Jinks. There’s currently no word on who will join Chenoweth on the show and star opposite her as Tara Hubley.\n\nIn addition, it’s still unclear as to when we can expect The Biggest Star In Appleton to premiere via Disney+."
