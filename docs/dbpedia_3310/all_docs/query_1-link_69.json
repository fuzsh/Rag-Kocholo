        "text": "May 27, 2023\n\nRemember Playing the Palace? The book with the lovely pink cover we all wanted to be the next Red White and Royal Blue? The book we either loved or hated? Paul Rudnick, the author of Playing the Palace, wrote a new book, a love story spanning decades.\n\nWhereas Playing the Palace was hilarious and over the top, and for some people simply too much, Farrell Covington and the Limits of Style is raw and genuine, an ode to life, while still harboring the same insane ‘a hundred-word sentences’ with dozens of commas, and the faster than fast pacing.\n\nIt’s 1973 when Nate, a Jewish gay boy from the New Jersey suburbs, meets Farrell, an insanely rich, flamboyant, and handsome guy, at Yale. I smiled at their first conversations, and soon my chest started to glow for Farrell. He’s the kind of person who ignites a fire. He’s the kind of person who seems to have it all. He’s the kind of person we secretly all want to be. But don’t try to look under the surface because, at the same time, Farrell is only a shadow of himself when he’s with his family.\n\nThe story is written from Nate’s POV, and when he meets Farrell, he can’t do anything but surrender and fall in love. His admiration for Farrell is tangible throughout the novel. Nate is simply in awe and has to pinch himself to be sure that Farrell is anything but a dream and his boyfriend.\n\nI liked Playing the Palace, but I fell head over heels in love with Farrell Covington and the Limits of Style. The first one-third of this book shows us Nate’s and Farrell’s college years, and the rest of the story takes us on a journey of being inseparable, of being apart, of forbidden love, of exploring gay life, of revenge, and of true love. My mouth pulled up so many times in a smile, and my heartbeat fastened, depending on the speed of the novel. Lumps closed off my throat, and when I finished the book, tears escaped my eyes.\n\nI know Playing the Palace was not for everyone, but I urge you to read Farrell’s and Nate’s story! This book is pure love that splashes off the pages!\n\nI received an ARC from Atria Books and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.\n\nFollow me on Instagram\n\nAugust 22, 2023\n\nBeen sitting on this review for more than a month— mostly because of my personal connection to the time period and the resemblance of Farrell to the beloved brother I lost.\n\nCute, charming and sweet to start, this story didn’t stay lighthearted for very long. And once the storyline deepened, so did my angst as I realized where this love story that spanned the pre- and post-AIDS epidemic years might be headed.\n\nDespite the sadness of those years (and reminders of my family’s loss), I pretty much loved the journey of this coming of age story.\n\nUnbelievable at times? Sure. Overdramatic and over-the-top? Yup. But that’s exactly what made this occasionally raw tale worth reading. And one of the finest examples of fictional poetic justice (IMHO) was a truly glorious moment for this reader who loves a comeuppance!!\n\nI loved you Farrell (you too Nate) and I thoroughly loved this bigger than life story!!\n\nAnd I appreciated that this story gave me some much needed, wonderful moments when I was totally engrossed by my own memories.\n\nViva love in all its divine forms!! 🌈 ❤️🌈\n\nMay 23, 2023\n\nI read this book in one sitting! 🥳 I almost turned this book away because of the title alone. I originally was like, ok this title is a bit too long winded for my liking, but I enjoyed Paul Rudnick’s Playing the Palace (albeit a bit too PG for me), so I wanted to give it a try. FARRELL COVINGTON AND THE LIMITS OF STYLE is not only going to be on my top reads of the year, but it’s also one of my favorite gay fiction novels of all time. And the purpose of the title will all make sense by the time you finish reading.\n\nThe story is centered around a white gay man, Nate, and his relationship with the eccentric and beautiful Farrell Covington. Taking place in the 1970s, Nate’s unorthodox journey with Farrell spans decades as the two fall head over heels in love with each other under the most, let’s say, dangerous of circumstances. I will try not to invoke any spoilers with this book, because it really helped me enjoy the story when I didn’t know what was going to happen, but after wrapping this up, it felt like a love letter or speech from Nate basically being read to readers about his journey with Farrell (you’ll know what I mean). Spanning 1970s Manhattan into Hollywood, through the 1980s and finally into the 2000s—use your imagination on specific events during those times and just know that Nate and Farrell experienced it too.\n\nThis book is steamy AF 🥵, heartbreaking, beautiful, and authentically gay. The author makes sure to note that the journeys Nate and Farrell experience come from a place of cisgender white men with financial security, which I thought was important to add here as their journey is different than those who don’t have that privilege. I literally cried when reading this book, and I never cry with books, so just know that this book had me fully immersed in the story. I can’t imagine this book not being in my top reads of the year!\n\nOctober 2, 2023\n\nFarrell Covington and the Limits of Style is quite possibly the gayest book I will ever read in my life, and that's one of the main reasons I love it.\n\nUnapologetically gayer than gay, darlings! Campy at times; ironic, sarcastic, and bitchy in the most profound drawing room comedy manner. Rudnick's tale is also deliciously and thunderously passionate about actresses, clothing, art, Broadway, and architecture forever.\n\nOne throughline in Farrell and Nate's tale is not being afraid to fight back against toxic family members (as well as small-minded film executives) who keep asking gay people to slow down and stop telling their stories. The joy of Nate and Farrell's life together is how wonderful it can be to surround oneself with a chosen family who have your back, who love you, but who are also unafraid to tell you (to your face) if and when you choose a truly unfortunate sweater.\n\nPaul Rudnick writes so many delightful quips and asides in this book. Yes, it's uneven at times. Yes, I did almost put down the book when I was afraid it would turn maudlin AIDS movie of the week (but it did NOT)! And I definitely considered rolling my eyes into Adele's deep over a close up viewing of the Twin Towers terrorist attack, but Rudnick knows how to write-- and how to keep the gay flag flying, even when real life tragedies will throw serious shallow endeavors off kilter.\n\nTwo examples of delicious asides (neither of which spoil any plot twists)?\n\nIt was a voice that could only be classified as Mid-Atlantic. That invented MGM mode of sounding unplaceably fancy-- as if the person was forever flinging open the double doors to a well-appointed drawing room. The voice was maddeningly--but somehow naturally--effective. As if the person had been raised by a bottle of good whiskey and a crystal chandelier.\n\nAnd later in Farrell & Nate's tale:\n\nI'm grateful we no longer have to keep up with everything. We can pretend we're senile. When Sten asked me about gender Marxism and its intersectionality with climate change, I squinted sagely and said \"spatula.\"\n\nAnd gay men, straight women, lesbians, and non-binary youths keep soldiering on. Even when horrifyingly racist, bigoted, and homophobic politicians in Florida want to demonize the LGBTQIA crowd. But where was I? Did I go all Lord Byron, in a gay frenzy of digression, on you? Tra la la.\n\nAh, yes, the pleasures of reading an unapologetically gay, gay, gay, gay, gay book. Style has no limits, but style can benefit from an editorial eye or a good line editor.\n\nMy rating: 4.5/5 rounded up to a 5. It's not perfect, but it's SO.DAMN.GAY. that it earns a top-off, darling.\n\nJanuary 15, 2023\n\nI love Paul Rudnick and I wanted to love this book. It has his usual wit and excellence of character, and I usually LOVE a gay story that spans decades, but while I felt this book started strong, it doesn’t keep its momentum.\n\nThe main problem I found is that the author and thus the main character is so in love with Farrell Covington that it’s literally all the story is about. They meet, they fall in love, they stay in love, complicating circumstances rise and are met and over and over and over again characters gather to talk about how handsome and witty and talented Farrell is. He walks around the scenes dispensing witticisms and everyone fawns on him. Next scene, more witticisms, more fawning. There are parts of the book where the cast is literally reminiscing about earlier parts of the books and WASNT FARRELL SO GORGEOUS AND FUNNY ?! Doesn’t he have the most impeccable taste? We all love him so much!! It got really boring and by the end of the book I was skimming (because I already knew he was handsome and funny and had a big dick).\n\nI think one’s enjoyment of the book will be based on how much you love Farrell and want to hear about how much others love him too!!\n\nJuly 23, 2023\n\n4.25/5\n\nFarrell Covington and the Limits of Style by Paul Rudnick is funny, sad, lighthearted, steamy, informative, and heartwarming all at the same time, and I loved getting to know Farrell and Nate. While the story is told completely through Nate's viewpoint, I thought the author did an excellent job of giving a lot of depth to Farrell as well, and both of these men really jumped off the page for me. I was laughing in the very first chapter, so I knew I was going to enjoy this one and I really, really did. I hadn't realized until now that I actually read another book by the author quite a while ago, and this was definitely a far cry from being the same sort of storyline as It's All Your Fault. This is a sweeping tale of love set against the backdrop of many decades starting in the 1970s, and it was pretty dang steamy as well!\n\nThe audiobook is narrated by Daniel Henning who just so happens to be the same person that narrates T.J. Klune's novels, and to say he was perfect is an understatement. He brought these characters to life in a way I don't think anyone else could have done, and he made me love them even more than I already did. I highly recommend the audio for this reason, and Henning added even more to the story for me. It has a long title, but let me tell you, it is so fitting to the book, and I think the cover is as well. Rudnick is such a clever writer, and I couldn't help but be in tears at the end of this book. It is a heavy hitter while being funny at the same time, and the only thing I didn't like was some parts felt a bit rushed. Other than that, I adored Farrell Covington and the Limits of Style and its characters, and if you are looking for a terrific LGBTQ fiction read, you will find it here.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\n\nHoly hell what an absolute treat of a book. Hilarious, wicked smart, deeply touching. I loved it.\n\nJune 8, 2023\n\ndon’t be fooled by the cover - sure this is funny and sweet, but HORNY. like smut level sex scenes (which was a pleasant surprise)\n\nwe follow Farrell and Nate from the time they meet in college in the ‘70s through the span of a few decades. I had fun with this for the most part but Farrell’s quirkiness can get a bit annoying after awhile and i do feel like the book went on a little too long, but overall a really refreshing piece of queer fiction. it has a romcom-ish tone without being a romcom story\n\nJune 25, 2023\n\nI'm only in chapter 5, bit so far this is the most joyously gay book since Chse! Book 1: #Hockey. Happy Pride, y'all.\n\n***\n\nEach section has a different mood and reflects social changes through the life stages of the narrarator, Nathan Reminger. The fictional Reminger borrows Rudnick's biography while the plot revolves around Covington. The result is a cohesion and through line that real lives lack, without the awkwardness\n\nof \"unvarnished truth.\"\n\nA lovely book that values everything with passionate commitment, without apology.\n\nLibrary copy\n\nJuly 30, 2024\n\nI loved every second of this book..such witty writing, no notes.\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\nI don't want to have to check off spoilers, so this is going to be vague. First off I loved Farrell Covington and the Limits of Style. Have been a fan of author Paul Rudnick for years. His sense of humor never fails to make me laugh and laugh. So I approached his new novel thinking it would be time for more fun. And it was. But it was so much more. It turned out to be this epic gay story of the lives of two men in love. Starting in the 1970's, Farrell and Nate meet, fall in love and here's where I stop explaining. I loved how the story kept on going. The beginning, middle, and end so satisfying. A huge success. Dare I say Farrell might be my favorite of Paul's writing? Yes, I dare. Wow.\n\nJuly 21, 2023\n\nReally funny until it's sad and beautiful. Loved it.\n\nJune 12, 2023\n\nI’m really torn with this book - parts were great and unapologetically gay. (I’ve never highlighted so many whole paragraphs) But other parts didn’t quite work for me. There are some great reviews for it, so maybe it’ll resonate with you more?\n\n𝙁𝙖𝙧𝙧𝙚𝙡𝙡 𝘾𝙤𝙫𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙩𝙤𝙣 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙇𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙩𝙨 ���𝙛 𝙎𝙩𝙮𝙡𝙚 by Paul Rudnick (2023) ★★★☆☆\n\nFirst, this is almost a fictionalized semi-autobiographical novel from Paul Rudnick - screenwriter and playwright who’s accomplished some amazing works - 𝘚𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘈𝘤𝘵, 𝘐𝘯 & 𝘖𝘶𝘵, 𝘑𝘦𝘧𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘺. So cool things - Nate is clearly a fictionalized version of Rudnick. So let’s get to the story.\n\nNate Reminger, aspiring Jewish aspiring writer, meets and falls for Farrell Covington, drop-dead handsome & ridiculously wealthy, while they are in college. They fall hard, but this is only the start of the story.\n\nThis novel takes place over 50 years, and tells the story of Nate and Farrell across the decades together, and the decades apart. Moving from Yale to NYC, LA, and around the world - while experiencing the societal issues and changes from disco, AIDS, 9/11, career successes, and family issues.\n\nIt’s told almost like a retelling by Nate, an autobiography if you will.\n\nIt’s an ambitious plot, which also was its downfall for me - there were just parts of the story that were boring IMO.\n\nHowever, there were many great parts - the writing was on-point, funny, and insightfully gay! Both Nate and Farrell were great, if not ridiculous characters.\n\nIt’s worth a read, but maybe don’t prioritize it to the top of your TBR. 🤷‍♂️\n\nThanks to Atria Books and NetGalley for a chance to early review this story in exchange for an honest review.\n\nJuly 17, 2023\n\nTW:this is a very LGBTQIA book. If that bothers you - bye! This is a love story between two men that spans decades.\n\nJuly 9, 2023\n\n3.5 stars, rounding up.\n\nA few caveats:\n\nI listened to this as an audiobook and the performer was over the top, which at times was fun and added to the experience, and at others was distracting and cartoonish. I think I would've preferred to read it myself to keep it more realistic, though maybe the point is that Farrell Covington IS over the top and should be experienced that way?\n\nThere are some VERY NC-17 (smutty?!) sex scenes in this book. In fact, if you've ever been curious about what happens at a gay sex club or, say, how a swing can be a sex prop, you're going to get an education. The frank descriptions of sex that leave little to the imagination make it clear this is an unapologetically gay book. It doesn't mean others can't or won't enjoy or appreciate the story – it's just not centered around your experience.\n\nThat said, I enjoyed this book. I'd largely characterize it as a fun/funny romp, which is a feat in itself, considering it tells the story of two men in love – one from a conservative ultra-rich family – before it was socially acceptable to do so. Spanning the 70s to present day, and from NYC to Wichita to LA, it gives a good look at what it has meant to be gay in America.\n\nFebruary 10, 2024\n\nIt is a rare treat when you receive a recommendation(thanks Rachel) and discover a book that captures and delights your heart right from the first page! The characters, the story, the way of life that imitates musical theater…the joy in being different… not accepting social norms…a story that grabs your senses and you can’t wait to find out how it all unfolds… I loved every minute!\n\nJuly 30, 2023\n\nReally enjoyed this one! The writer is super witty and crafted two well-defined characters in Nate and Farrell. The story follows them through a decades-long relationship starting in the disco era and moving towards present time. That obviously moves through some dark times for gay men so know going into it that there are some sections that are hard to read.\n\nNovember 6, 2023\n\nA different sort of read for me. Contemporary story of two guys who meet at Yale during the '70s, are almost instantly attracted to each other, and form a relationship that lasts for the next fifty years. More than just a gay romance, the novel is about a generation of people (gay and straight) that grew up and lived during those decades and how they reacted to events, especially AIDS, political and social upheaval, 9/11, etc. The author juggles a large cast well and moves the story at a decent pace. There's plenty of wit and humor here, as well as seriousness over family dynamics, career building, love, relationships, etc. It's entertaining, funny, sad, and if you were alive during those decades from the '70s on, much in the way of nostalgia.\n\nEntertaining and interesting read.\n\nOctober 3, 2023\n\nJAIL TIME. PAUL RUDNICK DESERVES JAIL TIME. IMMEDIATELY. IMMEDIATELY.\n\nDecember 16, 2023\n\nLoved this book and didn't want it to end. The audiobook version was brilliantly read.\n\nNovember 17, 2023\n\nI am f*cking weeping. Weeping!\n\nTo understand, you must know that immediately before I started this book, I finished the Less series by Andrew Sean Greer, for which he won a Pullitzer. And it was an extraordinary journey. I felt more emotionally intelligent reading Less and Less is Lost. In contrast, what Paul Rudnick does in Farrell Covington and the Limits of Style is to create an epic love story of two characters who just happen to be extraordinarily gay in just the way the world needs at this moment -what I needed at this moment. This book took that emotional intelligence I gained from Less and ran through it, wringing out my emotions like juice from a juicer.\n\nThis retrospective, which has just enough of the author's own life to make it feel real enough to touch and feel, takes us through all the tropes of gay life we grew up watching - gay liberation, conservative families, bath houses, Bette Midler, Fire Island, Broadway, and the gay plague. Then he adds a new one that so many of us didn't get to grow up watching - what it means to grow old and achieve your dreams whilst being unapologetically gay. While Less showed us a journey around the world, Farrell Covington and the Limits of Style takes us on a journey through time and delivers us to the present and the future for all of us lucky enough to make it this far. We don't all have the limitless bank accounts of Covington, but hopefully we all do have dreams to make the difference we can. We all have the prospect to be of use.\n\nBoth were wonderful works, and neither asked to be compared with one another, but that's just the way life works sometimes. I loved both and will carry both with me like a treasure I found at a Barney's warehouse sale.\n\nF*ck you Paul Rudnick for making such a beautiful and poignant work that I wept from the sheer beauty of it. Thank you, also.\n\nJuly 30, 2023\n\nYou would think a novel written by the funny witty satirical Paul Rudnick would be witty, funny and satirical. In the beginning it is ... a little bit. Then? It isn't. This is as maudlin and insufferable as a grocery store checkout cliche Romance paperback.\n\nJune 9, 2023\n\n“𝑳𝒊𝒇𝒆 𝒊𝒔 𝒆𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒉𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒆𝒏𝒔 𝒕𝒐 𝒚𝒐𝒖, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒌𝒏𝒐𝒄𝒌𝒔 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒇𝒍𝒂𝒕, 𝒐𝒓 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒏𝒕 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒔𝒕𝒖𝒅𝒚 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒆𝒅𝒊𝒕.

𝑰’𝒗𝒆 𝒃𝒆𝒆𝒏 𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒚𝒐𝒖.”\n\nAnother “Dennis (@ScaredStraightReads) made me do it” read - a raving review had me so excited to pick up Paul Rudnick’s newest release.\n\nBased on the title and cover, I wasn’t completely sure what to expect, but this book is a lot of things. It’s humorous. It’s tragic. It’s beautiful. It’s unapologetically gay. It’s a love letter describing the journey of Nate and Farrell, told from their first meeting at university to old age with family interfering, successes, failures, and everything in between. Rudnick doesn’t shy away from the good, the bad and the STEAMY with Nate and Farrell, while creating a loveable group of friends that support them throughout the years (I particularly loved Sally and Jackson). Nate and Farrell’s love is tested, as they are often expected to reinterpret themselves, separate, and kept hidden away. There are moments of campy fun, and moments of heart wrenching sadness; the AIDS crisis of the Eighties was especially well written, hitting the right tone with lines such as: “𝑰𝒕’𝒔 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖’𝒓𝒆 𝒃𝒆𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒐𝒍𝒅 𝒚𝒐𝒖’𝒍𝒍 𝒃𝒆 𝒆𝒙𝒆𝒄𝒖𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒅𝒂𝒚. 𝑺𝒐 𝒄𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒓 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒔𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒅𝒖𝒍𝒆 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒌𝒆𝒆𝒑 𝒊𝒏 𝒕𝒐𝒖𝒄𝒉.” I did think that the book could’ve been a little shorter and tightened up in a few spots, and Farrell can be a bit much at times, but that didn’t stop me from treasuring this book.\n\nFarrell Covington and the Limits of Style is a story of being gay, going against expectations, finding your group of people, fighting back against prejudice, triumph, and ultimately real love. Thank you to Simon & Schuster Canada, Atria Books and NetGalley for the ARC!\n\nAugust 19, 2023\n\nBook #21 of 2023\n\nMy dear friend and fellow reader David recommended this tres gay and delightful summer read about an average Jewish young man from Jersey with Broadway playwright and Manhattan-living aspirations and a stunningly beautiful, Wichita Catholic, trust fund Adonis from one of the wealthiest and most conservative families in the country. The two meet at Yale at age 18, fall madly in love and spend decades together - and years apart - secure in their love for one another.\n\nTheir story traverses NYC, Fire Island, Hollywood and all corners of Europe as they and their loyal and quirky friends grow old together experiencing the Studio 54 era, the AIDS epidemic, 9/11, etc.\n\nMy favorite line from the book, and the secret 😉 to my own love affair of 21.5 years and counting, is:\n\n“The most crucial prerequisite for any couple’s longevity is to have both partners unequivocally accept, as a baseline, that the person they love is insane and has no morals.”\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\n\nI really wish I liked this more. The first two pages were fun and then it became grating fast and didn't let up.\n\nToo many details, the way a bad liar tells too much and ruins their lie. There are these constant explanatory, \"insider-esque\" asides and explanations and every time I'm like according to whom? It reads like you're stuck listening to a loud gay fabulist whose schtick you can’t not see through. It's like the entire book is someone practicing to share their life's story on daytime TV. It's all too affected and bombastic, and the final act's attempt to (I think?) wrestle with the question of style's limits is entirely unsatisfying.\n\nSomething that weightless and unchallenging out to be a quick read and yet it took me forever because I never wanted to pick it up. I did wonder if I'd like this better as a baby gay or maybe still closeted? I don't know.\n\nAugust 18, 2023\n\nVery grateful to have received an ARC from Goodreads!!\n\nYeah, the characters are campy and over the top, but the heart is real. It took me a little bit to get into this, although it didn't take long for things to get interesting. There's a lot of gay history, mostly from the 70s through the 90s although there are bits that touch on earlier history and a little bit into modern day. Overall- very funny with some pretty emotional moments. I'm glad I read this.\n\nAugust 7, 2023\n\nWhile not entirely the most original novel ever written, it was endlessly funny, witty, sexy, and even tragic. An unabashedly gay romp spanning over decades.\n\nJune 15, 2023\n\nA Whimsical Journey\n\nStep into the delightful world of fashion, flamboyance, and fabulousness with Paul Rudnick’s spellbinding novel, “Farrell Covington and the Limits of Style.” This whimsical tale takes readers on an exhilarating rollercoaster ride through the glamorous universe of fashion, sprinkled with a healthy dose of camp and a wink of self-awareness.\n\nRudnick’s mastery of witty dialogue and razor-sharp humor is on full display as he introduces us to the unforgettable character of Farrell Covington.

Fortunately I was able to grab a copy in print and ended up adoring and really cherishing almost all of it.\n\nNate and Farrell meet at Yale, as 18-year olds in the 1970s. Both are virgins but that’s about the only thing they have in common. Nate is a nice Jewish boy from New Jersey, an average looking guy trying to find himself. Farrell is impossibly gorgeous, confident and rich. The two almost immediately fall madly in love and their story then spans the next 50 years.\n\nAs the characters (and the author) are about 5ish years older than me, I loved reliving the decades with them. Having loved my share of gay men, so much of it was nostalgic and familiar. Some of it was incredibly raw, for those of us who like our sex scenes closed door, there is going to be parts that leave us a little uncomfortable. The author and his characters are unapologetically gay. The scenes from the 80s and early 90s when the world was first finding out about and then dealing with HIV and AIDS were hard to read and made me think of people I loved and lost to the disease, and the loneliness I know they must have felt. I really loved the honesty and tenderness and it made me think about how far we’ve come as a society, gone are the days where people had to keep their sexuality hidden in the closet. Most of all I really loved the characters, especially the hilarious Nate and the irresistibly charming Farrell but also their friends who are a fleshed out supporting cast. The ending had me in tears, so tender and beautifully written. There were parts in the middle that dragged a little - and there were parts in the beginning spoiled by the over the top narrator in the audiobook - for now I would rate this book 4.5 stars. I’d like to reread it again one day, there’s a lot of hilarious razor sharp one-liners that I’m sure I missed on this first go round. I have a feeling Nate and Farrell are going to stick with me for awhile, the true test of a really well written novel."
