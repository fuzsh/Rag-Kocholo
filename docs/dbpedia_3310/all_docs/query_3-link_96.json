        "text": "Paul Rudnick rates as a gay pioneer with groundbreaking hit movies and Broadway shows.\n\nBut with “Playing the Palace,” he wrestled with where his romance between Carter, a 20-something event planner, and Prince Edgar, a (fictitious) English heir to the throne — should be told.\n\n“I had the idea years ago,” Rudnick, 63, began, “but couldn’t decide if it should be a play or a movie or a book.\n\n“That’s always the best challenge. It’s something I’ve only learned through the worst trial and error as to what will, especially when you’re doing comic writing, work on the page — and what might be better before a live audience.\n\n“A book made sense because I love having a first-person narrator and being able to travel all over the world in an instant.”\n\nA self-described royals obsessive, Rudnick has “always been fixated with them. I remember Diana had a major resonance for the gay community because that was during the peak of the AIDS crisis.\n\n“She was one of the first celebrities of that magnitude who actually went into an AIDS ward and embraced people with AIDS, held infants with AIDS and really used her glamour for the greater good.\n\n“I felt somehow devoted to her. Beyond that I’ve always loved watching Queen Elizabeth, to see what she’s wearing and how well behaved she is.\n\n“I just think, imagine lasting that long in that job — and never disgracing yourself! They’re not our royals but they’re the equivalent of movie stars. They allow us to fantasize about their wealth and their wardrobes and romantic ups and downs.\n\n“That’s why I loved writing about them. It was the most wonderful non-guilty pleasure. I thought, ‘Yes, this is probably more fun than actually talking to them.’ ”\n\nAfter hit movies (“In & Out,” “Addams Family Values”) and a recent HBO pandemic special, “Coast Elites” with Bette Midler and Issa Rae, Rudnick is co-writing the book for Broadway’s upcoming Elton John musical version of “The Devil Wears Prada.”\n\n“There’s going to be a tryout in Chicago next summer (2022). Elton has been supplying the most amazing score with Shaina Taub, a superb new lyricist.\n\n“What’s interesting is when I started, one of the producers said, ‘This is going to be at least seven years’ — and my brain thought, ‘You’re kidding.’\n\n“But you want to get it right. Especially because it’s such an iconic property and so beloved. You don’t want to mess it up.\n\n“I think the production team has been smart about taking their time.”\n\n“Playing the Palace” by Paul Rudnick, Berkley, $16."
