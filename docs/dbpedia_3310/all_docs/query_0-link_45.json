When lounge singer Delores Van Cartier witnesses a mob murder, she’s stashed by the feds in a convent where she revitalizes the group’s flagging choir and brings out the best in the bunch, including herself. Riotously funny, endearing, and toe-tapping, this comedy classic is more than just nunsense and a sweet treat to share with the whole family, or your best group of girlfriends!"
