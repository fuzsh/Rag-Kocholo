Shell-shocked, Bethany finds solace in her secret hobby – penning gay erotic fiction. When her playful fantasies of lover pirates, star-crossed congressmen and clowns with marital issues become hugely popular online, she’s given a new outlook on life. But as her fame grows, will the risks of being a “slash fic” author lead to danger, happiness or the very best combination of both? Our own Christopher Ashley (Diana, Come From Away) directs this laugh-out-loud new comedy from Paul Rudnick (the upcoming The Devil Wears Prada musical, Jeffrey) about finding your calling in your guilty pleasure."
