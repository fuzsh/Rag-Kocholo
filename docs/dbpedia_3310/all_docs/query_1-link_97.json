        "text": "It's been an exciting few months for musical fans (and if you're not a musical fan, you probably have a heart of stone). First came the news that Broadway smash Hamilton would be making its way across the Atlantic to London's West End, then we learnt that Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! would be getting the theatrical treatment it's always deserved. La La Land has had us tap-dancing out of the cinema, and Tina Fey has finally confirmed that the Mean Girls musical will be arriving - as we'd hoped - on October 3rd.\n\nNow, we have further reason to crack out some celebratory jazz hands: the hit novel and film The Devil Wears Prada is being adapted into a stage musical by none other than Sir Elton John.\n\nElton is teaming up with Sister Act's Paul Rudnick to bring the story of aspiring journalist Andy and ice queen fashion editor Miranda Priestley to Broadway, writing a script and songs that will be based on both the book and the film (take that, TDWP purists...)\n\n'Reimagining The Devil Wears Prada for the musical theatre is super exciting,' Elton said. 'I'm a huge fan of both the book and the feature film and a huge aficionado of the fashion world. I can't wait to sink my musical teeth into this hunk of popular culture.'\n\nThe legendary singer and composer is of course a musical veteran, having previously worked on The Lion King and West End favourite Billy Elliot.\n\nAs yet, details of a release date are vague, and we aren't yet sure whether the production will eventually come to the West End (though given its constituent parts, we can hazard a guess that it will be pretty successful).\n\nAs for casting? Given that the 2006 film's three leads have all since gone on to prove their vocal talents in screen musicals - Anne Hathaway in Les Miserables, Meryl Streep in Mamma Mia and Into The Woods and Emily Blunt in the latter film - would a reunion production be nice? Meryl, that Tony Award has your name on it...\n\nTake a look back at Miranda's iciest slights in the video below:\n\nREAD MORE: Meryl's Devil Wears Prada Inspiration Will Surprise You"
