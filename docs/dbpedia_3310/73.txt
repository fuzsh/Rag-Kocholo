QUOTE OF THE DAY

Paul Rudnick may be best known for writing the screenplays for movies like Sister Act and Addams Family Values. But subscribers to The New Yorker also know him as a contributor to its humorous “Shouts & Murmurs” column.

One of Rudnick’s most entertaining pieces was “How to Write a TV Police Procedural in Thirteen Easy Steps.” Here are two satirical tips from it.

“1. The main character in most procedurals is a troubled male detective whose marriage has crumbled because he works too hard and cares too much. …

“2. The male detective will always wear a jacket and tie, unless the procedural is set in Scandinavia, in which case he’ll wear a nubbly sweater (also known as a Swedish tuxedo). He will sport facial scruff and bark commands at younger staff members, a group required by law to include a person of color, a peppy young gay guy, and the only blond person on the show. Crime is no place for blondes, except as victims, meaning as actresses who appear as corpses covered with leaves.”
