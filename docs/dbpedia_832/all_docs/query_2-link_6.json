        "text": "Spring 2024 schedules on Commuter Rail will take effect on May 20; ferry schedules to take effect in April and May.\n\nThe MBTA is implementing a series of service enhancements across all modes this spring season. These improvements are designed to provide riders with more frequent, reliable, and convenient transportation options across the MBTA’s service areas.\n\nCommuter Rail\n\nSpring service changes go into effect on Commuter Rail lines on May 20 with schedules available soon at mbta.com/CommuterRail.\n\nFairmount Line Frequency Increase: With a commitment to improving equity and access in traditionally underserved communities across the Fairmount Line service area, the MBTA will increase the frequency of Fairmount Line trains to every 30 minutes on weekdays and weekends, a significant improvement from the previous 45-minute intervals. The Readville lower platform will also reopen to riders, offering more transfer options for the Franklin, Foxboro, Providence, Stoughton, and Fairmount Lines.\n\nReintroduction of Worcester Express Train: Through collaboration with the City of Worcester, the MBTA will reintroduce a weekday morning express train from Worcester, arriving at South Station in downtown Boston at 8:45 AM. The trip will also include stops at Framingham and Lansdowne.\n\nResumed Service at South Attleboro Station: The MBTA will resume train service to and from South Attleboro with three morning inbound and three evening outbound trips. Commuter Rail service at South Attleboro was suspended in February 2021 due to significant deterioration of the pedestrian overpass, which passes over the station’s tracks. In October 2023, construction crews demolished the pedestrian overpass and surrounding infrastructure.\n\n2024 CapeFLYER Service: The popular CapeFLYER, offering round-trip service between Boston and Cape Cod, will return for the season on Memorial Day weekend. The service runs on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until Labor Day with some additional service during holiday weekends.\n\nOther Commuter Rail Service Updates: Various schedule adjustments and trip time reductions will be implemented on the Newburyport/Rockport, Lowell, Fitchburg, Haverhill, Franklin, and Providence Lines to improve performance, accommodate Amtrak schedule changes, and align with other service improvements.\n\nSubway\n\nSpring service changes went into effect on subway lines on April 7 with more information available at mbta.com/ServiceChanges.\n\nRed Line: Weekday morning and evening peak period frequency has improved by about 30 seconds between Alewife and JFK/UMass and by one minute on the Ashmont and Braintree Branches due to faster travel times from improved track conditions, resulting in 24 additional daily trips.\n\nOrange Line: The weekday morning and evening peak period frequency has improved by about 30 seconds due to the addition of new trains available for service, resulting in 18 additional daily trips.\n\nBlue Line: Weekday evening frequency between 8 PM and 11:30 PM will improve from every 12-13 minutes to every 8-10 minutes due to increased demand, resulting in 22 additional daily trips.\n\nGreen Line: Weekday morning and evening peak period service frequency on all branches. Riders can expect to see improvements of 30 seconds to one minute due to successful hiring of additional Green Line operators and MBTA training school expansion. These changes will result in 82 additional daily trips, providing riders with more options to get to where they need to go; restore frequency decreases that took effect in fall 2022 and some early morning westbound/outbound D Branch service on weekdays and Saturdays; and improve Sunday frequency and weekend capacity on various branches due to more two-car trains in operation.\n\nBus\n\nSpring service changes went into effect on bus routes on April 7 with more information available at mbta.com/ServiceChanges.\n\nFrequency Improvements: Due to historic increases in bus operator hiring, the frequency between buses will improve on Routes 7, 9, 21, 32, 47, 57, 111, 501, SL1, and SL3 during certain times on weekdays and weekends with increased Sunday service on Route 1.\n\nSchedule Adjustments: Routes 34 and 121 schedules have been updated to improve reliability and more accurately reflect the service that is operating so that riders can rely on published bus schedules. Overall service hours are largely the same, but some frequency has been reduced to offset longer travel times. The Route 116 Sunday morning trip has been replaced with a restructured Route 117 for better consistency, improved schedule legibility, and a better service pattern so that the very early morning trips (before the Blue Line begins operating) will be similar on weekdays and weekends. Departure times were adjusted for 59 bus routes to improve the time between buses and schedule reliability.\n\nRouting Changes: Routes 83 and 91 were adjusted due to construction in the Central Square area. Route 120 was adjusted to better align with the last Blue Line trains of the day. The MBTA continues its aggressive hiring effort for more bus operators and plans to assign operators to areas experiencing high crowding.\n\nFerry\n\nAs previously announced, spring service changes go into effect on ferry routes in April and May. Ferry schedules are available now at mbta.com/Ferry."
