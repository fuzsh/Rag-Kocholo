        "text": "LOWELL — The MBTA’s Lowell Line was closed Wednesday afternoon as police and firefighters responded to an accident in which a man was struck and killed by a train.\n\nEmergency crews were called to Rumford and Crystal streets in Lowell about noon, and police who arrived on the scene reported a person was trapped under the train. Police requested detectives come to the scene, and that dispatchers have trains on the Lowell line stopped.\n\nTransit Police Superintendent Richard Sullivan said in an email that it appears a man intentionally stepped into the path of the Commuter Train, and that he was pronounced dead at the scene. Sullivan declined to release additional information.\n\nMeghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for District Attorney Marian Ryan, said only that a man was struck by a train near the Lowell and Tewksbury town line, and that the man was pronounced dead. Kelly said an investigation into the death remains ongoing.\n\nOne train on the Lowell line was canceled due to police activity on the tracks, and subsequent trains were stopped at the North Billerica station, with buses taking passengers the rest of the way north to Lowell, according to tweets from the MBTA’s official account. Southbound trains originated in North Billerica, and anyone travelling south from Lowell was shuttled there via bus."
