For over a century, Bostonians had avoided the congested streets below by riding trains carried on huge steel tracks overhead. When the El was built in 1901, people were thrilled to pay the five-cent fare to travel in mahogany-paneled cars …",

The two were the last to drive over the elevated Central Artery before that structure was closed and the southbound Interstate 93 Big Dig tunnel opened last December. \"Sunlight will caress the asphalt of Causeway Street once again.\" The new underground route for that portion of the Green Line is part of a $325 million project designed to replace the deteriorating elevated tracks by the Fleet Center and unite the Orange and Green lines for a smoother transfer to North Station commuter rail. The new tracks underneath the Fleet Center are completed, and a new underground station for the Green Line at North Station, shared with the Orange Line, is set to open Monday.\n\n…The old elevated tracks which date back to Fenway Park's creation in 1912 and are the last piece of elevated infrastructure left in Boston, after the demolition of the Central Artery and the relocation of the Orange Line down Washington Street,will be dismantled over the course of [next] year, said Joe Pesaturo, spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.\n\n… The half-mile stretch of elevated Green Line tracks, winding from the corner of Causeway and Canal streets to Martha Road beside the Thomas P. O'Neil Federal Building, is the last major piece of elevated transportation infrastructure in the city…\n\nBoston Globe, June 26, 2004."
