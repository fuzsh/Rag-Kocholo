        "text": "February is going to be a shuttle bus kind of month for the tens of thousands of strap-hangers who use the MBTA’s subway and commuter rail services to get around Greater Boston.\n\nOn Friday, the public transit agency announced a slew of repair work and service interruptions for its Red, Orange, and Green lines, along with the Fitchburg and Lowell commuter rail lines.\n\nThe Red Line will go first on Feb. 5, with work on the other subway and commuter rail lines continuing throughout the month, the agency said in a statement. The newly announced work, which is intended “to improve service reliability across the system,” comes on top of repair work that started earlier this month.\n\n“The MBTA apologizes for the inconvenience of these scheduled service changes and appreciates the understanding and patience of riders as this critical and necessary work to maintain, upgrade, and modernize the system takes place,” the agency said in its statement.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of where the work is happening, when it will start, and your commuting alternatives.\n\nOn the Red Line:\n\nAs the agency had previously announced, service on the Red Line will be suspended between Alewife and Harvard stations all day from start to end of service for 10 days from Feb. 5-14.\n\nBeginning at approximately 8:45 p.m. through the end of service every day during the same period from Feb. 5-14, this Red Line service suspension will be extended to Park Street. That means that evening service will be suspended between Alewife and Park Street, the agency said in its statement.\n\nFree shuttle bus service will make all the stops between those stations. You can find more information here.\n\nFree commuter rail service will run between Porter Square and North Station. Riders will be on the hook for regular fares beyond Porter Square, the agency said in its statement. Riders should also plan for longer wait times.\n\nRed Line service also will be suspended between the Harvard and Broadway stations all day from start to end of service during the weekend of Feb. 24-25, according to the MBTA. Shuttle buses will make all stops between the Harvard and Broadway stations, the agency said,\n\nThere also will be free fares at Harvard and Broadway stations with the fare gates open.\n\nThe Commuter Rail will be fare-free between Porter Square and North Station. Once again, regular fares should be purchased beyond Porter Square.\n\n“This service change is in place to allow crews to perform necessary inspections of Red Line tunnel infrastructure,” according to the MBTA. “Crews will also maximize the unencumbered access to the work area by performing power and signal work along the Red Line in the work area as well as station amenity upgrades like new lighting, painting, tiling, and power washing.”\n\nOn the Orange Line:\n\nOrange Line service will be suspended between Forest Hills and Ruggles stations all day from start to end of service during the weekend of Feb. 17-18. Free shuttle buses will make all stops between those stations, the agency said.\n\nThe Commuter Rail will be free between Forest Hills, Ruggles, Back Bay, and South Station, but riders will have to pay for stops beyond Forest Hills.\n\n“This service change is in place for crews to perform critical signal improvement work,” the MBTA said in its statement.\n\nOn the Green Line:\n\nAs the agency has previously announced, Green Line service on the B branch between Copley and Babcock Street, on the C branch between Copley and Cleveland Circle, and the D branch between Copley and Brookline Hills will be suspended all day from start to end of service for 18 days from Feb. 20 through March 8, according to the MBTA. You can find more information here.\n\nHere’s a more detailed breakdown:\n\nB Branch: The MBTA said it will run free shuttle buses between Babcock Street and Copley stations. Outbound B branch riders won’t be charged a fare at Babcock Street. There also will be free fares at Copley Station, with the fare gates open. Riders can also hop on free Route 57 bus service for travel between Kenmore and Babcock Street.\n\nC Branch: Free shuttle buses will make stops between the Cleveland Circle and Copley stations. There will be free fares at Copley Station, with the fare gates open.\n\nD Branch: Free shuttle buses will run between the Brookline Hills and Copley stations. Outbound D branch riders won’t be charged a fare at Brookline Hills. There also will be free fares at Copley Station.\n\nThe Commuter Rail will be free between South Station, Back Bay, and Lansdowne stations during this Green Line service change. But riders will be on the hook for regular fares beyond Lansdowne, according to the MBTA.\n\nOn the Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line:\n\nFitchburg Commuter Rail Line service will be suspended between Littleton/Route 495 and Alewife stations from start to end of service during the weekend of Feb. 3-4, according to the MBTA.\n\nA dedicated diversion schedule will be in effect and available on mbta.com soon.\n\nFree shuttle buses will replace service between Littleton/Route 495 and Alewife. Local shuttle buses will make all stops between Littleton/Route 495 and Alewife. Express shuttle buses will also make stops at Littleton/Route 495 and South Acton, and will then operate express to Alewife, the MBTA said.\n\nThere will be no service at Kendal Green. Strap-hangers are being encouraged to local bus routes at Brandeis/Roberts. Passengers also will be asked to purchase a regular subway fare and/or a Commuter Rail interzone fare, the agency said.\n\n“This service change allows crews to perform Automatic Train Control (ATC) work. ATC is a federally mandated safety system that sends signals to trains about potentially unsafe conditions, automatically slowing and stopping a train if needed,” the agency said in its statement.\n\nOn the Lowell Commuter Rail Line:\n\nLowell Commuter Rail Line service will be suspended between Lowell and North Station from the start to end of service during the weekend of Feb. 10-11. Free shuttle buses will run between Lowell and North Station. A dedicated diversion schedule will be in effect and available on mbta.com soon.\n\n“This service change allows crews to perform Automatic Train Control (ATC) work. ATC is a federally mandated safety system that sends signals to trains about potentially unsafe conditions, automatically slowing and stopping a train if needed,” the agency said.\n\nKnow More:\n\nRiders can also find more information on service changes through in-station signs, in-station public announcements, and at mbta.com/alerts.\n\n“Transit Ambassadors and MBTA staff will be available on-site to offer information and assistance during these service changes,” the MBTA said in its statement. “Riders are further being encouraged to subscribe to T-Alerts or to follow the MBTA on X (the site formerly known as Twitter) @MBTA, @MBTA_CR, and @MBTA_CR_Alerts for up-to-date service information.”"
