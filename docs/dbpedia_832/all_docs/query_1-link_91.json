So instead it was built on the campus of\n\n> the University of Masachusetts at Boston near Columbia (now JFK/UMass)\n\n> station.\n\nAlso, though I don't know its present state, there was a tunnel extending\n\nwest from Bowdoin Station to a portal in the middle of Cambridge Street.\n\nIn \"recent\" years, this was used by the \"East Boston Tunnel\" trains to\n\nreach the servicing facility that you mention near Harvard Square.\n\nThe East Boston Tunnel existed as a heavy rapid transit line running between\n\nBowdoin and Maverick from the time it was converted from a streetcar tunnel\n\n(1923?) until it was extended to Orient Heights (1953?). Someone with a better\n\nmemory than I may correct the dates by a year or two, but that's approximately\n\ncorrect. While in this configuration, the line had loops at both ends, but\n\nno servicing yard. Where they stored cars overnight I do not know, as until\n\nabout 1953, \"Owl\" service was operated between Maverick and Scollay Under (now\n\nGovernment Center - the \"Blue Line\" station was unaffected by the changes at\n\nthe \"Green Line\" level). I think the trains in \"Owl\" service ran through w/o\n\npassengers to Bowdoin to go around the loop (though I'm not certain of that),\n\nso I don't know where they could have stored extra cars. Was there a storage\n\ntrack at Maverick - I think maybe there was. In any case, the \"East Boston\n\nTunnel\" line was the only one of the three heavy rapid lines that ran 24 hours\n\na day. Until the line was extended to Orient Heights and the present yard and\n\nshops were built there (on the site of the former narrow gauge shops), the\n\n\"East Boston Tunnel\" cars (this was years before the lines were \"colorized\")\n\nwere maintained at the Harvard (Eliot) shops. They had trolley poles that\n\nwere used ONLY for the trip to Harvard. The track ran out the portal into\n\nCambridge Street, through Charles Street Circle (I forget the exact track\n\nlayout here), and onto the Longfellow Bridge, which then was paved with\n\ncobblestones. In the middle (approximately) of the bridge, the track joined\n\nthe \"Cambridge Subway\" track. I believe you can still see the breaks in the\n\nfence where the line used to cut in. Trolley poles were used in the section\n\nwhere the track was in the street.\n\nThe afore-mentioned conversion of \"Scollay Square\" to \"Government Center\" and\n\nall the construction that went along with that caused extensive rebuilding\n\nof the \"Central Subway\" tunnels between Scollay and Haymarket. The former\n\n\"Brattle\" and \"Adams\" stations were discontinued, along with the loops that\n\nhad been used by the cars from Charlestown (the \"Brattle Loop\", which was\n\nroughly in the same spot as the present seldom-used north-facing loop at\n\nGovernment Center) and the smaller tighter loop that the Eastern Mass.\n\ntrolleys used to use at Adams Square. \"Adams\" was a northbound stop only,\n\nas there were two completely separate tunnels. The northbound tunnel ran\n\nunder Cornhill and Washington Streets and contained the Adams Square Station\n\nunderneath Adams Square, while the southbound tunnel ran under Sudbury Street.\n\nNeither Cornhill Street nor Sudbury Street (as it was then) exist today - the\n\npresent \"New Sudbury Street\" is on a different alignment.\n\nSomebody mentioned the tunnel that goes south under Tremont Street from\n\nBoylston Street Station. The original Subway had two southward-facing\n\nentrances or portals. The \"Pleasant Street\" entrance was located at the\n\nintersection of Tremont Street, Shawmut Avenue and Pleasant Street. \"Pleasant\n\nStreet\" is the present \"Broadway\" (part of which is now \"Charles Street South\"\n\non a slightly changed alignment). The other portal came out in Boylston Street\n\nin the block where the Colonial Theatre is. The \"Public Garden Entrance\", that\n\nwas used by Huntington Avenue cars until the Huntington Avenue Subway opened\n\nin 1940, was built when the tunnel was extended to Governors Square (Kenmore\n\nSquare) later. (There may have been an intervening extension part way - I\n\ncan't remember off the top of my head, and of course all my books on the\n\nsubject are at home.) I think that was about 1910. The original plan for\n\nthe Tremont Street Subway called for cars from lines to the south to loop at\n\nPark Street, and cars from lines to the north to loop at Brattle Street. There\n\nwere also through tracks as at present. However, from something like 1901 to\n\n1904 (again, dates are at home), the through tracks were used by the \"Main Line\n\nElevated\" trains only, and I assume they had a third rail although I suppose it\n\nis possible that the early \"El\" trains also were equipped with trolley poles? I\n\ndon't know if that use of the subway was part of the original plan or an after-\n\nthought, but I suspect the former. In any case, it was always intended to be\n\n\"temporary\", and unlike the \"temporary\" terminal at Everett that lasted until\n\n197x, this one really was.\n\nThe \"Main Line Elevated\" opened in 1901 between Sullivan Square and Dudley\n\nStreet. Enormous and elaborate terminals for connecting streetcar lines were\n\nbuilt at both ends. Both survived essentially untouched though of course no\n\nlonger used for streetcars until the El was torn down. This \"Main Line\n\nElevated\" was the \"Orange Line\" as we knew it until the 1970s, except of course\n\nthat it had long since been extended at both ends. When they designed the \"Main\n\nLine\", they realized that the hardest and longest part of the construction would\n\nbe the planned tunnel under Washington Street in the center of Boston, so they\n\nplanned for \"temporary\" operation of the Elevated trains through the Tremont\n\nStreet Subway. I think the connection at the north end was built alongside\n\nCanal Street essentially where the \"Green Line\" cars to Lechmere climb to the\n\n(soon to be torn down) elevated structure today. I know that the south end\n\nconnection was made from the Pleasant Street entrance by running alongside\n\nShawmut Avenue and up a ramp to a short elevated structure over (or possibly\n\nbeside but I don't think so) Castle Street, then curving onto the \"permanent\"\n\nstructure over Washington Street. Castle Street no longer exists. It was\n\ndestroyed in the extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike. It was about where\n\nHerald Street is now.\n\nThrough trains were operated between Sullivan and Dudley through the Tremont\n\nStreet Subway for about 3 years until the Washington Street Subway was\n\ncompleted, at which time the connections were removed, and the Tremont Street\n\nSubway became simply a streetcar subway as it is now. The \"Atlantic Avenue\n\nElevated\" was opened at the same time as the \"Main Line\". It ran from Keany\n\nSquare (the junction of Causeway, North Washington and Commercial Streets and\n\nthe Charlestown High Bridge) over Commercial Street and Atlantic Avenue.\n\nStations were (if I remember correctly) at \"Battery\" (near the foot of Hanover\n\nStreet), \"State Street\" (the present Aquarium site), \"Rowes Wharf\" (connection\n\nto the narrow gauge ferries to East Boston), \"South Station\" (at Dewey Square,\n\nthe reason that the present \"Red Line\" station was always called \"South Station\n\nUnder\"). It passed by South Station over Atlantic Avenue, then curved over\n\nBeach Street and I think Harrison Avenue to roughly where the Turnpike is now,\n\nthen over one of the short streets there (I forget which one) to join the\n\n\"Main Line Elevated\" over Washington Street. Signal towers were located at\n\nboth junctions, and both remained until very recent times. I think there was\n\nanother station somewhere in Chinatown, but I'd have to look it up to be sure.\n\nThe original plan called for through service over both routes between Sullivan\n\nand Dudley, and that was operated for many years. However, there was more\n\ndemand for service on the south end than on the north, so they also operated\n\na sort of loop service that went from Dudley northward through the Washington\n\nStreet Subway (I don't know if this service was started while they were still\n\nrunning through the Tremont Street subway) and then returning over Atlantic\n\nAvenue to Dudley. This \"loop\" service operated in both directions. In later\n\nyears, as ridership fell off on the Atlantic Avenue line, service between the\n\nsouth connection with the \"Main Line\" and South Station was discontinued, and\n\nthe Atlantic Avenue line was reduced to a shuttle running between North and\n\nSouth Stations. (This shuttle service may also have operated at times earlier.\n\nI'd have to look it up. I know there was a layup track with platform that it\n\nused above Causeway Street sort of between the railroad station and the main\n\n\"Main Line Elevated\" platforms. There was no layover facility at South Station,\n\nonly a crossover.) This service ended and the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was\n\ntorn down in I believe 1940. I think that the portion south of South Station\n\nhad been torn down earlier, but again I'd have to look it up. Certainly it\n\nwasn't used in revenue service after somewhere around 1930.\n\nI can remember the tower and some obvious elongated support structures where the\n\nsouth connection was. I even better remember the tower at Keany Square, and\n\na short piece of El structure that was left over Commercial Street at this point\n\nas a place to store spare or disabled cars and occasionally to turn back trains\n\nwhen there were problems with the Charlestown High Bridge draw. The tower was\n\npreserved and I believe is now at Seashore Trolley Museum.\n\nWriting this has made me realize that there are a lot of things about Boston's\n\ntransit history that I do not know, and I should re-read some of my books. Like\n\ndid streetcars from Cambridge ever operate into the tunnel on Cambridge Street\n\nor was that built when they converted the East Boston line to \"heavy rail\"?\n\nLike when did the south end of the Atlantic Avenue line stop running and exactly\n\nwhen was it torn down?\n\nThere's a good deal more I DO know, though, and if anyone has specific questions\n\nI'll try to answer them. Maybe a question would stimulate me to look up some\n\nfact I don't remember! But we've gotten a long ways away from the subject of\n\nabandoned subway tunnels, so I think this is enough for the present.\n\nLen Bachelder m00...@mbvms.mitre.org\n\n[ I'm going to delete some of the quoted text to appease my mailer which\n\nwill reject a message with more quoted than new text.]\n\n>> Also, though I don't know its present state, there was a tunnel extending\n\n>> west from Bowdoin Station to a portal in the middle of Cambridge Street.\n\n>\n\n> If the Blue Line is ever extended to Charles Street to connect to\n\n> the Red Line, this tunnel will see service once again.\n\n>\n\nWhen pigs fly?\n\n>\n\n>>[The Blue Line cars] had trolley poles that\n\n>>were used ONLY for the trip to Harvard.

I don't\n\nknow without looking it up when that tunnel was built, that is if it was built\n\nat the time of the conversion of the present \"Blue Line\" from streetcar to\n\n\"heavy rapid\" operation. IF it is older than that date, which I think was\n\n1923, then it MAY have been used at some time prior to the opening of the\n\nCambridge Subway (1913 I think) to bring cars from Cambridge into the Central\n\n(Tremont Street) Subway. I know that at one time cars from Cambridge did go\n\ninto the Central Subway, but without looking it up which I haven't had time to\n\ndo, I can't say how they got there. If I were to guess, I'd guess it was more\n\nlikely that they came over the Charles River Dam Bridge from Lechmere and\n\nentered the Subway at Canal and Causeway Streets.\n\n>>The former\n\n>>\"Brattle\" and \"Adams\" stations were discontinued, along with the loops that\n\n>>had been used by the cars from Charlestown (the \"Brattle Loop\", which was\n\n>>roughly in the same spot as the present seldom-used north-facing loop at\n\n>>Government Center) and the smaller tighter loop that the Eastern Mass.\n\n>>trolleys used to use at Adams Square.\n\n>\n\n> What was the Eastern Mass. trolley system, and what routes did their\n\n> cars serve?\n\n>\n\nThe Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway was formed circa 1920 as the\n\nreorganization of the bankrupt Bay State Street Railway system. That system\n\nin turn was essentially the amalgamation of the Boston and Northern Street\n\nRailway and the Old Colony Street Railway. Prior to the bankruptcy, they\n\nwere controlled by the Massachusetts Electric Power companies. The Boston\n\nand Northern and the Old Colony were large systems operating virtually all\n\nthe trolley lines north and south of Boston respectively outside the areas\n\nserved by the Boston Elevated. They had grown up over the years through\n\nthe acquisition by the power company and subsequent merger of scores of\n\nindependently built small trolley companies in the various cities and towns.\n\nThe Eastern Mass. was created as a private corporation but was assisted and\n\nat first (until it became solidly profitable) heavily regulated by the State.\n\nSort of an early \"Conrail\". In particular, it was allowed to abandon many\n\nof the marginal and unprofitable lines that the Bay State had been operating.\n\nThese were mostly rural operations, but did include a few whole Divisions,\n\nsuch as Nashua NH, Gloucester and Newport RI. The Eastern Mass. eventually\n\nsettled down to an operation consisting of eleven Divisions:\n\nHaverhill\n\nLawrence\n\nLowell\n\nMelrose-Woburn\n\nSalem\n\nLynn\n\nQuincy\n\nBrockton\n\nTaunton\n\nFall River\n\nNorwood\n\nTwo other Divisions - Hyde Park and Chelsea/Everett - were sold to the Boston\n\nElevated circa 1930 and became part of that company's system. The Eastern\n\nMassachusetts never operated any passenger service THROUGH Boston, though\n\ncars of several of its Divisions entered the City to reach Boston Elevated\n\nRapid Transit terminals at such places as Fields Corner, Ashmont, Mattapan,\n\nDudley (discontinued fairly early), Forest Hills, Sullivan and Everett.\n\nThey also operated freight trolley service (using box motors mostly if not\n\nexclusively) to a terminal on Harrison Avenue in the South End near Dover\n\nStreet (now East Berkeley Street). This building still stands. It was\n\nused by Bay State/Eastern Mass. freight trolleys as well as by the Boston and\n\nWorcester and possibly other lines as well. (The Eastern Mass. never owned\n\nlines running WEST from Boston - these were the property of the Boston and\n\nWorcester and the Middlesex and Boston systems.)\n\nBeginning in the 20s and continuing aggressively through the 1930s, the\n\nEastern Mass. converted its trolley routes to bus operation. After 1937,\n\nthe only trolley routes left were:\n\nSullivan Square Station - Stoneham\n\nThis line operated over Boston Elevated tracks in Mystic Avenue and in\n\ncenter reservation in the Fellsway (Route 28) to Elm Street in Medford\n\nwhich is the present terminus of MBTA bus route 100. From there, it\n\ncontinued on private right of way through the Middlesex Fells\n\nReservation roughly paralleling the present Interstate 93 to the north\n\nend of the Reservation, where it returned to the street, Main Street\n\nin Stoneham (Route 28) at the intersection of North Border Road (the\n\ncorner where Friendly's Ice Cream Shop is today). Much of the right\n\nof way is still visible, including a couple of stone arch bridges,\n\none of which you can see from Route 93. From there it ran\n\nin the street to the Boston and Maine Stoneham Branch crossing at\n\nFarm Hill station. About 1940, it was cut back from Farm Hill to\n\nStoneham Square. The cars were stored at the Elevated's Salem Street\n\nCarhouse in Medford. Elevated men operated the cars to a meeting\n\npoint in the Reservation known as the \"Sheepfold\", where Eastern Mass.\n\noperators took over. At least in non-rush hours, and I think at all\n\ntimes, the cars ran in local service on the El tracks. The Elevated\n\noperated additional trolleys (Type 5s are what I remember) just\n\nbetween Sulllivan and Elm Street. The Stoneham service lasted until\n\n1946. After that, the Elevated (and later the MTA) ran to Elm Street\n\nonly until the early 50s. This was, I believe, the last streetcar\n\nline operated by the MTA except for the Cambridge lines and the ones\n\ninto the Subway. The last car to Stoneham was number 4387, which is\n\nnow at Seashore Trolley Musuem. I remember this line very well, as\n\nwe were living in Roxbury for a couple of years when I was a small\n\nchild, and since the Elevated fare was good to \"Spot Pond\", the\n\npoint where the cars emerged from the Reservation, one could cheaply\n\ntravel that far for a day's outing in the Park or to the Stone Zoo.\n\nI don't recall ever riding to Stoneham. We wouldn't have been able to\n\nafford the extra fare to ride just for the fun of it. I do remember\n\nwhen riding in other people's automobiles seeing the cars in Stoneham\n\nSquare.\n\nFields Corner to Quincy, Houghs Neck and Quincy Point\n\nThis route operated from the Elevated's Fields Corner Station along\n\nNeponset Avenue in Dorchester and Hancock Street in Quincy to Quincy\n\nSquare, from which point it branched. One branch went all the way out\n\nSea Street to Houghs Neck. It did not go to Germantown as the present\n\nbus does. I believe there was a short stretch of private right of way\n\nnear the end of the line. The other branch went to Quincy Point and\n\nthe Fore River Shipyard. I think it ran on Washington Street but I'm\n\nnot sure. Needless to say it was a very busy line during the War.\n\nThe cars were housed at the Eastern Mass. carhouse in Quincy. Most\n\nof the facility had been converted into a bus garage, but enough rail\n\nstorage was left for these remaining cars. I believe the last of the\n\nold buildings there has finally been torn down, but the site is still\n\nused as a bus garage by the MBTA. This route was the most heavily\n\nused route on the entire Eastern Mass. system, and presumably that is\n\nthe reason that it remained rail for so long. Service in the rush\n\nhours was every 5 minutes or better, and the cars ran 24 hours a day.\n\nThe Elevated had an off-street loop at Neponset Circle, and operated\n\nlocal service between Fields Corner and Neponset; the Eastern Mass.\n\ncars ran express to Neponset Circle at least in the rush hours.\n\nThis line lasted until 1948. I remember seeing the cars in Fields\n\nCorner Station, but I don't think I ever rode it. In the 1946-8\n\nperiod, numerous fantrips were run on this line, at least one of which\n\nfeatured operation of a Boston Elevated PCC streetcar to the Shipyard.\n\nThere was a loop at the Shipyard but not at Houghs Neck.\n\nThe Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway continued to operate its eleven\n\nDivision bus system for many years after the last two rail lines had been\n\nconverted to bus. In my school age years, when we lived in Beverly (even\n\nduring the war), they sold a \"Ride all Day for $1.00\" ticket. I persuaded my\n\nmother on as many occasions as I could to use this cheap ticket (kids could\n\nget one for 50 cents) to ride as many bus lines as possible. In this way I\n\nmanaged by the time I was 12 years old to ride all Eastern Mass. bus lines\n\nexcept the Fall River Division. The only place in modern times where they\n\nleft Massachusetts was a line from Taunton to Providence along Route 44.\n\nAlso, summer only special service from Lawrence to Canobie Lake Park in\n\nSalem NH. Gradually of course especially after 1960, the ridership and\n\nservice followed the usual pattern of reductions. The Haverhill, Taunton\n\nand Fall River Divisions were sold off; Norwood (which had only one line)\n\nwas combined with Brockton, and Melrose with Lynn. The most heavily used line\n\nremained the route between Fields Corner and Quincy Square. In a very\n\ncontroversial decision (allegedly at the insistence of the MTA operators'\n\nunions), the Eastern Mass. was denied the right to operate busses on the\n\nSoutheast Expressway into Downtown Boston when the Expressway opened,\n\nalthough a short-lived temporary operation was run when the rail service on\n\nthe New Haven Railroad to the South Shore was abandoned in 1959 (?). When\n\nthe State and the MTA began to talk seriously about building the Rapid\n\nTransit (now the \"Red Line\") to Quincy and Braintree, the Eastern Mass.\n\nstrenuously objected as it would kill their heaviest and most profitable route.\n\nWhen all the dust settled and all the politicians had had their \"innings\", etc.,\n\nthe \"solution\" was the creation of the MBTA (which coincidentally happened just\n\na few months before the Boston and Maine was allowed to discontinue almost all\n\nits passenger service), and the State purchase of the Eastern Mass. system.\n\nThe MBTA operated all its routes for about a year allowing time for the cities\n\ninvolved to get their act together and establish Regional Transit Authorities\n\nin Lowell, Lawrence and Brockton to take over. The remaining Eastern Mass.\n\nroutes, within the statutory MBTA district, are still operated by the MBTA,\n\nwith some contraction, some expansion and some integration with previous\n\nBoston Elevated / MTA services. I was at one time going to write a history\n\nof the Eastern Mass., but I've not yet had time to do so. Maybe one day I will!\n\nNow in all of the above discussion I have been answering the general question of\n\n\"what was the Eastern Mass.\", and have not mentioned their operation into the\n\nSubway. I do not know for sure if this operation was part of the original\n\nSubway plans, but I suspect it was. Certainly it was begun very early if not\n\nat the actual beginning of the Subway. The only Eastern Mass. (and Bay State\n\nbefore it - and I believe it even dates from the days of the Boston and Northern\n\nand probably the original Lynn and Boston Street Railway) routes ever to enter\n\nDOWNTOWN Boston were the lines from Lynn and Salem. They all converged on\n\nWestern Avenue (Route 107) in Lynn, passing the carhouse at the site of the\n\npresent MBTA West Lynn bus garage (that is the \"modern\" carhouse - in the\n\nearliest years there were several carhouses in Lynn), and then running along\n\nBroadway through Revere and Chelsea over the OLD Mystic River Bridge into\n\nCharlestown and then over the Charlestown High Bridge (and I think Warren\n\nAvenue - at least the Boston Elevated trolleys that I remember running to\n\nCharlestown used Warren Avenue inbound and the High Bridge outbound) and into\n\nthe Subway at Causeway and Canal Streets. They had their own loop just south\n\nof Haymarket Station, in the subway tunnel. Cars ran into the subway at least\n\nfrom Lynn and Salem and I suspect from most North Shore communities. This\n\nservice lasted until the Sumner Tunnel was opened in 1936. At that time, an\n\noff-street bus terminal was built at Haymarket Square (Honk if you remember\n\nhow Haymarket Square looked before the Central Artery), and busses were put\n\nin service at first only between Haymarket and Chelsea where they connected with\n\nthe cars for Lynn and Salem. This lasted I think less than a year. The\n\nEastern Mass. sold their Chelsea Division (including some cars that stayed\n\nin service until the lines were converted to trolley coach in 1953) to the\n\nElevated (but kept their main shops which were located in Chelsea until after\n\nthe war when all heavy bus repair operations were consolidated at Campello Shop)\n\nand began running busses on the McLellan Highway and through Sumner Tunnel.\n\nOperation of Eastern Mass. busses over the General Edwards Bridge (Route 1A) did\n\nnot begin until after the narrow gauge quit in 1940. The lineal descendant\n\ntoday of the Eastern Mass. trolley operation into the Subway is MBTA bus routes\n\n440, 441, 442, 450 and 455 (I think I have the numbers right). These busses\n\nnow are NOT restricted from carrying passengers between Boston and points in\n\nRevere as the Eastern Mass. busses always were (except for along Route 1A\n\nbeyond Revere Street). And of course a large number of passengers transfer\n\nto the Blue Line at Wonderland Station rather than riding the bus all the way\n\nto Haymarket especially in the rush hour.\n\n>>Somebody mentioned the tunnel that goes south under Tremont Street from\n\n>>Boylston Street Station. The original Subway had two southward-facing\n\n>>entrances or portals. The \"Pleasant Street\" entrance was located at the\n\n>>intersection of Tremont Street, Shawmut Avenue and Pleasant Street.\n\n>\n\n> Did the tracks from here run down Broadway to South Boston, down Tremont\n\n> to Egleston, or divide here and serve both routes? I thought there\n\n> were at some point two separate portals for these routes.\n\n>\n\nYes. The tracks went down both Broadway and Tremont Streets, and yes, there\n\nwere two separate portals although they were right side-by-each, and the tracks\n\njoined as soon as they entered the tunnel. I don't know without looking it up\n\nwhen it was rebuilt in this fashion, but I know that originally there was only\n\na single portal. The line to City Point was discontinued about 1950. The line\n\nto Egleston was cut back to a former carhouse that had been retained by the MTA\n\nas a \"junk storage area\" at Tremont and Lenox Streets just south of\n\nMassachusetts Avenue in the South End at roughly the same time. The track to\n\nEgleston Square and thence under the El along Washington Street to the Arborway\n\nCarhouse was retained for barn access. When they closed the Lenox Street line\n\ncirca 1962, a shuttle service was operated for a while, using the ex-Dallas\n\ndouble-ended PCC cars, between Boylston Street Station and the Broadway and\n\nTremont Street portal. As I recall, this shuttle service only used one car and\n\none track, but I forget which one it was.\n\n>>The \"Public Garden Entrance\", that\n\n>>was used by Huntington Avenue cars until the Huntington Avenue Subway opened\n\n>>in 1940, was built when the tunnel was extended to Governors Square (Kenmore\n\n>>Square) later.

What was\n\nrunning circa 1940, which is my personal earliest memory was:\n\nNorth Station - City Point via Broadway\n\nNorth Station - Egleston via Tremont Street\n\nPark Street - Arborway via Huntington Avenue, with \"short turn\"\n\nservice to Heath Street, Francis Street (now Brigham Circle)\n\nand Opera Place (now Northeastern University)\n\nLechmere - Reservoir (Cleveland Circle) via Beacon Street\n\nLechmere - Lake Street (Boston College) via Commonwealth Avenue\n\nPark Street - Watertown via Brighton Center and Newton Corner\n\nwith \"short turn\" service to Oak Square\n\nBrattle Loop - Sullivan via Bunker Hill Street\n\nBrattle Loop - Sullivan via Main Street\n\nObviously, the Riverside line did not exist then. For those who may not\n\nknow it, that line was converted to \"light rail\" from a steam and for a few\n\nyears Diesel powered commuter rail line of the Boston and Albany Railroad\n\nin 1959. (July 4 as I recall was the opening day.) At the time, this was\n\nloudly proclaimed to be the first conversion of a \"railroad\" line to transit\n\nuse. That of course wasn't true. Not even in Boston. The present \"Red Line\"\n\nfrom Andrew Square to Mattapan was a branch of the New Haven Railroad until\n\n1928, and I would not be so bold as to claim that even that was a \"first\"\n\nwithout doing a lot of research!\n\nWhat I would guess would be the most recently discontinued operation prior\n\nto 1940 was operation to Chestnut Hill along Boylston Street (Route 9)\n\nin Brookline, which was discontinued when the afore-mentioned Kenmore Square\n\nstation and busway was built, and opened with great promotion and ceremony.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't recall the date - it would have been I think in the\n\nmiddle 30s. Another interesting operation that lasted until something like\n\n1950 was the operation of \"Owl\" cars from several destinations in Dorchester,\n\nRoxbury, Hyde Park and West Roxbury into the Central Subway. The Elevated\n\nalways (at least in \"modern\" times - 1920 or later) had a completely separate\n\nset of routes that they operated between approximately 1 A.M. and 5 A.M. They\n\nissued a little booklet of \"Owl Schedules\", that listed these routes and the\n\nschedules in excruciating detail. Remember that until about 1948 there were\n\nno such things as published schedules for the public for the \"normal\" service.\n\nAll you had was the system map, which on the reverse side had a list of the\n\nroutes with the first and last times listed for each one, but no other\n\nschedule information. Anyway, these \"Owl\" routes in most cases bore little\n\nresemblance to daytime routings. In particular, the present \"Red Line\" and\n\n\"Orange Line\" (or to be correct, the contemporary versions of those lines)\n\ndid not run. The present \"Blue Line\", as I said, existed only between\n\nBowdoin and Maverick in those days. It was operated all night, but Bowdoin\n\nStation was not open. Most of the system was served by streetcars that\n\neventually found their ways from outlying points into the \"Central Subway\".\n\nThe exceptions generally were lines that had been converted to bus (not many\n\n\"important\" lines had been converterd by 1940!) or trackless trolley - these\n\nfew that did operate in \"Owl\" hours fed some streetcar line. (For example, in\n\n\"Owl\" service, trackless trolleys that in normal hours ran from Lebanon Street\n\nin Malden to the end of the Main Line Elevated at Everett Station were extended\n\nin \"Owl\" hours to connect at Sullivan Square Station with streetcars coming in\n\nfrom Broadway in Somerville.) All the street-car routes that went into the\n\nSubway were listed in the timetable as terminating at Scollay or Brattle.\n\nEverything was timed to make reasonable connections at Scollay/Brattle. Of\n\ncourse, then there was no south-facing loop at Scollay (as there is today at\n\nGovernment Center), so the cars actually ran to Canal Street loop. Even though\n\nmost of them would have been Type 5s that of course were double-ended, it would\n\nhave been an operational nightmare to have cars reversing ends at Scollay Square\n\nStation. Anyway, several of the routes from the south converged on the Dudley\n\nStreet terminal, and then ran up Washington Street under the El, then onto Dover\n\nStreet, to Tremont Street and thence into the Subway. This \"Owl\" operation was\n\nthe only revenue operation in that era over tracks along Washington from\n\nNorthampton to Dover and along Dover from Washington to Tremont.\n\nWell, I've already written about ten times as much as I intended to, so\n\nI'll sign off for now.\n\n> --\n\n> Ron Newman MIT Media Laboratory\n\n> rne...@media.mit.edu\n\nLen Bachelder m00...@mbvms.mitre.org"
