        "text": "The MBTA released their construction schedule for the month of May, which includes infrastructure changes affecting the Red, Orange, and Green lines.\n\nYes, you guessed it. More construction is hitting the tracks of the MBTA this May.\n\nThe MBTA announced in a press release this week that the planned work will “improve reliability across the system.” The changes will impact the Red, Orange, Green, and commuter rail lines.\n\nRed Line\n\nRed Line service will be suspended between Park Street and JFK/UMass from Wednesday, May 1 through Thursday, May 9. During the same time, evening Red Line trains will not operate after 8:30 p.m. between Park Street and Ashmont.\n\nLater in the month, Red Line service will change during the weekends of May 11-12 and 18-19. Service will be suspended between Broadway and Braintree, in part for work involved with the Dorchester Avenue Bridge replacement project. The bridge is slated to be demolished this spring and replaced by late 2024.\n\nFor all of these changes, free shuttle buses will replace service between suspended stations.\n\nGreen Line\n\nGreen Line service will bypass Magoun Square on the Medford/Tufts branch all day on Saturday, May 4. Passengers are encouraged to take the 80 or 88 bus instead, which operates from Magoun Square to Lechmere.\n\nOrange Line\n\nThe Orange Line will stop service between Wellington and North Station starting around 8:45 p.m. on Friday, May 17 and continuing through the weekend (May 18-19). On Monday, May 20, service will stop again from 8:45 p.m. through Friday, May 24. Shuttle buses will replace service between Wellington and North Station.\n\nFrom May 28 to June 6, service will be suspended between Wellington and Back Bay all day, every day. Shuttle buses will be available only between Wellington and North Station, after which passengers can use parallel green line service from North Station to Copley.\n\nCommuter rail\n\nSeveral lines of the commuter rail are going to be affected by the spring construction. The Kingston, Middleborough, and Greenbush lines will not run between South Station and Braintree on the weekends of May 11-12 and 18-19.\n\nFrom Saturday, April 27 to Sunday, May 5, service will be suspended on the Middleborough/Lakeville line from Middleborough/Lakeville to Bridgewater, which are adjacent stations.\n\nThe Fairmount line service will be suspended between Readville and South Station during the weekend of May 4-5.\n\nDuring the weekend of May 18-19, service will be suspended between North Station and Swampscott on the Newburyport/Rockport line and between Ballardvale and North Station on the Haverhill line."
