Use of the trail is not permitted until construction is complete. Trail opening is expected in June 2025 – please stay tuned for updates. Thank you for your patience as this greatly anticipated trail is built.\n\nThe Bruce Freeman Rail Trail (BFRT) will be a 25-mile rail trail between Lowell and Framingham, along the former Lowell Secondary Track right-of-way of the Old Colony Railroad (Full BFRT Corridor Map and Status). In Sudbury, the rail corridor extends through the center of Town, approximately 4.4 miles from South Sudbury near Route 20, north to the Sudbury/Concord Town line (Sudbury BFRT Project in Design Map). The BFRT will be constructed with State and Federal support. The project remains on schedule to commence construction later in 2022 or early 2023.\n\nThe project is on the 2021-2025 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) of the Boston Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) committing construction funding during Federal Fiscal Year 2022. This means the project has been awarded approximately $12 million dollars for construction of the 4.4-mile rail trail.\n\n**************************************************************************\n\nThe Planning & Community Development Department intends to post periodic project updates to this page on the Town’s website. Additionally, the Planning & Community Development Department has created a Bruce Freeman Rail Trail Project Updates email list where periodic updates will be pushed out to interested parties.

The project involves construction of a 5.1-mile trail, from Powder Mill Road in Concord to Station Road in Sudbury. The trail will be a 10-foot wide paved shared-use path, which is consistent with the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail in Concord and Acton. The work on the project will include improvements to two structures as well as upgrades to several at-grade crossings including Route 117 (North Road), Pantry Road, and Route 27 (Hudson Road).\n\nMessage from Friends of the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail:\n\nJoin us on Saturday May 20th at the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail Phase 2D “groundbreaking event” in Sudbury from 10am – 11:30am (rain or shine).\n\nMassDOT has scheduled this official ceremony for residents to celebrate the start of 5.5 miles of construction for this fantastic community facility. The event program will feature several speakers, including Secretary of Transportation Gina Fiandaca; plus, light refreshments will be served.

It is simply too dangerous and, at a minimum, we do not want people traversing an active construction site and getting in the way of the workers and/or their machinery. As such, we ask that people avoid walking on or crossing the rail corridor until the rail trail construction project is completed.\n\nSecond, railroad rail removal throughout the entire corridor will be continuing for the next 3-4 weeks. As many of you probably have seen, the stacks of old rails near the Hudson Road/Peakham Road intersection are being/have been removed this week. During the week of April 3, 2023, the installation of erosion controls will commence along with ongoing tree clearing throughout the corridor.\n\nMarch 20, 2023 Update:\n\nPhotos of Phase 2D Bruce Freeman Rail Trail construction work during the week of March 10, 2023.\n\nMarch 9, 2023 Update:\n\nThis is a friendly reminder that since we are now into active construction on the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail, people should NOT be accessing the rail corridor or actively using it.

Preliminary vegetation clearing and invasive species removal has been mostly completed in the southern portion of the corridor from its intersection with Haynes Road down to the Station Road area. Rail removal will commence during the week of February 13, 2023. This work will start in the area where the corridor intersects with Hudson Road and head northward. Rails will be cut and removed in sections, and immediately followed by the installation of erosion control measures to allow additional vegetation and tie removal, and grading to get underway. Additionally, Town staff is working to coordinate with MassDOT on a groundbreaking event for the project, likely in late March of 2023.\n\nJanuary 31, 2023 Update:\n\nPhotos of Phase 2D Bruce Freeman Rail Trail construction work during the week of January 31, 2023.\n\nJanuary 23, 2023 Update:\n\nPhotos of Phase 2D Bruce Freeman Rail Trail construction work during the week of January 23, 2023.\n\nJanuary 20, 2023 Update:\n\nWe are happy to announce that on Monday, January 23, 2023, A.A. Will Corporation and their subcontractor, Stanley Tree Service, will commence active vegetation clearing in the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail Phase 2D corridor.

The early stages of this work will include vegetation clearing, including invasive species removal, and chipping within the project’s limit of work in the corridor. This activity will be followed by the installation of erosion control measures, and then the removal of rails and ties in the coming weeks. Grading of the limits of work will begin afterward.\n\nField Inspection Reports:\n\nField Inspection Report #19, July 19, 2024\n\nField Inspection Report #18, June 21, 2024\n\nField Inspection Report #17, May 14, 2024\n\nField Inspection Report #16, April 10, 2024\n\nField Inspection Report #15, March 11, 2024\n\nField Inspection Report #14, February 6, 2024\n\nField Inspection Report #13, December 22, 2023\n\nField Inspection Report #12, November 22, 2023\n\nField Inspection Report #11, October 12, 2023\n\nField Inspection Report #10, September 12, 2023\n\nField Inspection Report #9, August 23, 2023\n\nField Inspection Report #8, July 21, 2023\n\nField Inspection Report #7, July 11, 2023\n\nField Inspection Report #6, June 22, 2023\n\nField Inspection Report #5, May 18, 2023\n\nField Inspection Report #4, April 19, 2023\n\nField Inspection Report #3, March 31, 2023\n\nField Inspection Report #2, February 16, 2023\n\nField Inspection Report #1, January 18, 2023\n\nNovember 30, 2022 Update:\n\nThe submission deadline for construction bids to MassDOT for the project was on September 7, 2022 and A.A.
