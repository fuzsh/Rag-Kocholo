        "text": "Background on Boston and Albany Railroad\n\nThe Boston and Albany Railroad was formed by a series of mergers beginning in 1867 that subsumed both the first commercial line in New England, the Boston and Worcester Railroad (chartered 1831) and the Western Railroad (1833), the most important line in Western Massachusetts. The expansionist Boston and Albany began extending lines eastward and westward at the same time, absorbing the Castleton and West Stockbridge Railroad (incorporated in 1834 and renamed the Albany and West Stockbridge two years later) and the Hudson and Berkshire Railroad, creating a powerful corporation that established the first continuous rail line across the Commonwealth.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century, the Boston and Albany prospered, absorbing a number of branch lines and extending its reach both northward and southward. By the 1880s, it claimed the distinction of operating one of the most efficient commuter operations, connecting Boston through Brookline and Newton Highlands to Riverside, eventually extending commuter service to Worcester. The line was noted, too, for Director Charles Sprague Sargent's initiative to beautify rail travel, hiring the architect Henry Hobson Richardson to design aesthetically pleasing stations.\n\nScope of collection\n\nThe nineteen atlases comprising this collection include detailed plans documenting the location and ownership of rights of way, land-takings, and other land transfers to or from the railroad company. Dating from the early years of operation for the corporation to just after the turn of the century, the atlases include maps of predecessor lines (Boston and Worcester Railroad Corporation and Western Rail-Road), as well as the Grand Junction Railway Company (Charlestown, Somerville, Everett, and Chelsea), the Ware River Railroad, and the Chester and Becket Railroad.\n\nThe collection includes frequent citations of legislation, references to actions with respect to county commissioners, boards of selectman, registries of deeds and deed books, and to the state Board of Railroad Commissioners (later Public Service Commission). Plans regularly specify location of subject properties in relation to the properties of identified abutters.\n\nInventory\n\nGrand Junction Railroad: Plan of locations of the several railroads connecting the East Boston freight railroad\n\n19 maps\n\nVol. 1\n\nAlso includes Charlestown Branch Railroad (1837) and Fitchburg and Lowell Railroad.\n\nBoston and Albany Railroad: Location of the Grand Junction Branch in Charlestown, Everett, Somerville, Chelsea\n\n10 maps\n\nVol. 2\n\nBoston and Albany Railroad: Scrap book no. 2: Back Bay Park, Brighton\n\nVol. 3\n\nIncludes Old Colony and Newport Railway Co.; Boston Terminal Co.; Boston, Revere Beach, and Lynn RR; Boston and Providence RR; and Boston Elevated Railway Co.\n\nBoston and Worcester Railroad: Brookline\n\n30p.\n\nVol. 4\n\nIncludes Roxbury, Faneuil to Riverside.\n\nBoston and Albany Railroad: Plan of locations of the several railroads connecting the East Boston freight railroad\n\n36p.\n\nVol. 5\n\nIncludes maps of Newton, West Newton, Newtonville, Auburndale, Riverside; Charlestown Branch Railroad (1837), Grand Junction RR (1949), Chelsea Branch RR, and Eastern RR.\n\nBoston and Albany Railroad: Wellesley, Newton, Natick\n\n36p.\n\nVol. 6\n\nBoston and Albany Railroad: Plan of new locations of the Boston and Albany Railroad in the town of Wellesley and County of Norfolk\n\n15p.\n\nVol. 7\n\nBoston and Albany Railroad: Additional land taken for railroad purposes in the county of Norfolk\n\n10p.\n\nVol. 8\n\nAlternate title: Plan of a new location of the Boston and Albany Railroad in the town of Wellesley and County of Norfolk, Mass.\n\nBoston and Albany Railroad: Plan of a new location of the Boston and Albany Railroad in the town of Natick and County of Middlesex\n\n4p.\n\nVol. 9\n\nWestern Railroad: Route from Worcester to Springfield\n\n72p.\n\nVol. 10\n\nIncludes maps of Worcester, Brookfield, Palmer, Warren, Chicopee, Springfield.
