The Track Improvement Program will replace tracks and ties to alleviate speed restrictions along the line while crews maximize the outage by performing signal work and station amenity upgrades, including new lighting, painting, tiling, power washing and more.\n\nOrange Line\n\nOrange Line service will be suspended between Wellington and Back Bay during the weekends of Aug. 3–4 and Aug. 17–18.\n\nFree and accessible shuttle buses will make all stops between Wellington and North Station.For service through the downtown area near Back Bay, riders are encouraged to utilize parallel Green Line service between North Station and Copley.\n\nThere will be free fares with the fare gates open at Wellington, North Station, Back Bay, and on the inbound side of Copley for riders making connections to the Green Line.\n\nRiders are encouraged to consider the Haverhill Commuter Rail Line for fare-free service between Oak Grove, Malden Center, and North Station.\n\nThese weekend service changes are in place to accommodate critical signal work in this area of the Orange Line.\n\nMattapan Line\n\nMattapan Line service will be suspended between Mattapan and Ashmont beginning at approximately 8:45 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 16, and through the weekend of Aug. 17–18.\n\nFree and accessible shuttle buses will make all stops between Mattapan and Ashmont.\n\nThis service change is in place to perform track work along the line and switch work within the Mattapan car yard.\n\nRed Line\n\nRed Line service will be suspended between JFK/UMass and Kendall/MIT every day for seven days from Aug. 19 – 25.\n\nFree and accessible shuttle bus service will make stops between JFK/UMass and Kendall/MIT with the exception of Park Street and Downtown Crossing.\n\nRiders heading southbound should instead disembark at Otis Street @ Summer Street and use the Winter Street concourse to travel between Downtown Crossing and Park Street.\n\nRiders heading northbound should instead disembark at Federal Street @ Franklin Street and use the Winter Street concourse to travel between Downtown Crossing and Park Street.\n\nShuttle buses will also serve State (on the Orange and Blue lines) and Haymarket (on the Orange and Green lines) for easier connections to other subway lines.\n\nThere will be free fares with the fare gates open at JFK/UMass and Kendall/MIT.\n\nRiders are encouraged to consider fare-free Commuter Rail service between Braintree and South Station as well as between Porter and North Station.\n\nRiders can find complete information soon at mbta.com/RedLine.\n\nThis service change is in place to perform necessary work as part of the Track Improvement Program.

The Construction Schedule is available at mbta.com.\n\nDuring this time, mid-day inbound trains will operate express between Ballardvale and North Station.\n\nFor service to Boston, passengers are encouraged to consider a free connection with Bus Route 137, which operates parallel service.\n\nPassengers may also consider connecting with Lowell and Haverhill Line train service at Anderson/Woburn station.\n\nAs previously announced, Haverhill Station is temporarily closed to passengers through summer 2025.\n\nPassengers are asked to instead board and disembark at Bradford. Bradford is about a half mile from Haverhill (about a two-minute drive or a 10-minute walk), features a parking lot with over 300 spaces, and includes outdoor bike storage racks.\n\nAn accessible van is operating between Bradford and Haverhill, making connections with trains at Bradford in both directions from the first train to the last train seven days a week. The van's schedule is available at mbta.com.\n\nThis service change is in place to accommodate the replacement of the South Elm Bridge, which carries the Haverhill Commuter Rail Line over South Elm Street between Bradford and Haverhill. Using accelerated bridge construction techniques to reduce customer and traffic impacts, the MBTA will replace the nearly-120-year-old bridge with a modern single-span structure with a useful life of 75 years. When construction is complete, Haverhill Line passengers will be provided with a safer, more resilient, and more reliable ride with fewer service disruptions related to the old bridge.\n\nT officials say they \"understands how these service changes affect riders' daily travels during this period,\" but they're \"committed to improving your travels long term with more reliable, timely, and safe service.\"\n\nRiders can find more information on service changes through in-station signage, installation- public announcements and at mbta.com, according to the T.\n\nMore MBTA news"
