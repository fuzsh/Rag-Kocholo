Some preparations provided sedation, analgesia, and of course there was some placebo effects. Patent medicines soon were to be found everywhere claiming to cure everything. Lowell later became a major center for patent medicine production, but this was not yet the “Golden Age” (in quotes) of patent medicines.\n\nDruggists and apothecaries during this period compounded physician’s prescriptions and sold patent medicines. Patent medicines were available elsewhere as well. I have included four ads from the Lowell Directory and Business Key of 1849 for illustration."
