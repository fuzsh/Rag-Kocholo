        "text": "Granite Railway, first chartered railroad in the United States (March 4, 1826). It was designed and built by Gridley Bryant, an engineer, and began operations on Oct. 7, 1826, running three miles from Quincy, Mass., to the Neponset River. The wooden rails were plated with iron and were laid 5 feet (1.5 metres) apart. Horse-drawn wagons with wheels 6 feet (2 m) in diameter hauled blocks of granite along these rails to the river, from where they were taken by barge to Charlestown in Boston, Mass., for use in the construction of the Bunker Hill Monument. In winter the cars were equipped with a kind of snowplow. The Granite Railway later became part of the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad."
