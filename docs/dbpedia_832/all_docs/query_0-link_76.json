        "text": "Looking for abandoned railroad tracks near you? Here's our map of abandoned and out-of-service railroad lines, where hopefully you can discover some history hiding in plain sight! It is most accurate in North America, but we are adding new lines across the world almost every day. As a crowdsourced endeavor, this map is incomplete, and will almost certainly remain incomplete. Please provide your knowledge! Know of some lines we don't have? Help us out and Submit a line to the map!\n\nIf you find this resource valuable, consider leaving a one-time, monthly or yearly contribution to support this website. Your generous donations help sustain the memory and visibility of this and other maps. As always, nothing is expected, all is appreciated!\n\nThe abandoned railroad map is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about the history of transportation. The map shows the location of abandoned railroads all over the world, and it provides information and links about the history of each railroad line, to the best of our ability. This is a crowd-sourced, and thus continuously updated map, of abandoned railroad lines across the world, in addition to unbuilt and unfinished railroads in various states of completion.\n\nThe map is a great way to learn about the development of transportation over time. It shows how railroads were once the primary means of long-distance overland travel, and it shows how they have been replaced by other modes of transportation, such as cars and airplanes.\n\nThe map is also a great way to find abandoned railroads to explore. Many abandoned railroads have been converted into hiking and biking trails, and they offer a unique opportunity to experience the history of transportation firsthand. This map is most accurate in North America, and as a crowd-sourced project, remains incomplete across the world.\n\nFor the purposes of this map; the legal descriptions of railroad property, i.e: rail-banked, out of service, disused, mothballed and abandoned are ignored. An out-of-service line that is still owned by a railroad company would still appear on this map, as the point of the map is to show were trains no longer run, not its current legal status. Looking for operating Heritage and Tourist Trains? Here's a link to that map!\n\nThis map is owned and maintained by Forgotten Lands, Places and Transit, any data gathered from this map should provide a link to the map, as well as a citation.
