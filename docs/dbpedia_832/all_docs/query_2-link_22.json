        "text": "Are the challenges claimed by http://www.bahnausbau-nordostbayern.de (run by DB, after all) something you’ve seen often in your research?\n\nNamely they say that due to frequent situations where a tunnel follows a bridge immediately and the tunnels not having enough height clearance to allow for catenary and the bridge not being able to be lowered, they’ll need expensive construction to achieve the required clearances?\n\nAlso, shouldn’t there be a cost trend to a certain extent that points upward as the most “lucrative” lines are done first (ceteris paribus) and only later those that are more marginal or more difficult to construct. So that as electrification reaches 100% the benefit cost ratio is “squeezed” on both ends with lines under consideration becoming more marginal and difficulties tending to become greater as the lower hanging fruits were picked earlier…\n\nNow thankfully this is partially mitigated by the benefits of electrifying 100% vs 95% but not always fully…\n\nBy the way, the cake for “most difficult electrification still done anyway” is probably taken by the Furka Bergstrecke… Every year (from 1942 to 1981). Eventually the Swiss realized that “tunneling under the snow” was cheaper and abandoned the line… Only for volunteers to take up the job later except for the electrification. (The only justification for steam from an economic standpoint these days is the “ticket revenue” side of the ledger as many railways that run steam as well as diesel actually get away with charging more for steam)… They have an entire bridge that’s removed every year and put back in every year… And the US thinks routine maintenance of sea level lines in temperate climate is a onerous task…\n\nhttps://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffenbachbr%C3%BCcke\n\nOn an unrelated issue, apparently there is increasing debate in Andorra about a rail link. Andorra never had a railway and is pretty mountainous. It has a population size of ~77k which would make it the biggest city without rail service if it were a German city and still one of the larger ones in Spain or France. Unfortunately much of the discussion is in Catalan only, including Wikipedia. https://ca.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_per_ferrocarril_d%27Andorra I don’t speak Catalan but I had Latin in school and speak Spanish so I can sorta make out the general idea…\n\nI think a rail link to Andorra should certainly be investigated but maybe a gondola lift would be the better option given the terrain and the fact that Andorra is famous for skiing.\n\nIronically despite its otherwise close cultural ties to Catalonia, the closest town with rail service is on the French side (albeit a Catalan place in many aspects) at L’Hospitalet https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorre-L%27Hospitalet_station\n\nA more ambitious version of an “Andorra railway” (which would then certainly be outside the budget of Andorra alone) would include a link to https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Seu_d%27Urgell seat of one of the two “co-princes” (The bishop) and site of an airport with “Andorra” in the namehttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra%E2%80%93La_Seu_d%27Urgell_Airport which is however of very limited use and would ironically be of even more limited use if a (high speed) rail link to Barcelona and/or Madrid became available…\n\nRE: freight clearances, “freight welfare”, etc. in Greater Boston. . .\n\nThere aren’t many such considerations that would have a tangible effect on electrification budgets. Legacy agreements do bind a few line segments to protecting set clearances, but the cost of doing the trackbed undercuts or bridge mods is so far lower than any potential “GO AWAY” payouts to the freights for sunsetting residual agreements that that isn’t worth worrying about.\n\nThe state gained control of the entire northside passenger system via a mass asset buy from then-bankrupt Boston & Maine in 1976…hundreds of miles of right-of-way (including all passenger territory), all passenger facilities and equipment, and a horde of landbanked abandoned lines. All at pennies on the dollar with near-total control going to the state. The only things B&M asked for in return for its settlement with the federal bankruptcy court was:\n\n(1) lifetime free trackage rights to B&M and its successors in any of the sold passenger territory;\n\n(2) lifetime dispatch control to B&M and its successors over any passenger-overlap sections of their northern “Freight Main”, which comprises the outermost Fitchburg Line west of Willows Jct. in Ayer and outermost Haverhill Line north of Lowell Jct. in Andover;\n\n(3) lifetime protected freight clearances to B&M and its successors over the Freight Main overlap and on one route–the Lowell Line–to Boston. Currently those clearances are Autorack (19’6″) on the Fitchburg Line overlap, Plate F (17′) on the Lowell and outer Haverhill lines. Lowell ended up being fresh-cleared for Plate F’s with a state-funded undercutting project in 1979 explicitly so the B&M could consolidate routes, thus giving up clearance claims on the other two Boston thru routes (inner Fitchburg + inner Haverhill/Reading) and the Eastern Route.\n\nPan Am inherited those legal indemnifications from the ’76 sale when it bought B&M, and they are set to pass on to CSX if the feds approve their ongoing buyout of Pan Am. This means that 25 kV electrification must provision for +2.5 ft. of safe wire clearance over the incumbent clearance routes as a cost of doing business.\n\n— The outer Fitchburg Line has only 8 total overhead structures, most of them fairly new and overprovisioned because of a line-wide upgrade blitz in the last 15 years. The few that might need any addressing can all be easily accomplished with trackbed undercuts during weekend outages. Should not add tangible cost.\n\n— The Lowell Line has a total large count of overhead structures, but because of the extensive 1979 clearance project and further provisioning work done in Somerville/Medford for the co-running Green Line Extension project not very many of those structures are problematic. Some incidental cost adds, but nothing that should resemble a blowout.\n\n— The outer Haverhill Line has some particularly tricky ones under the Downtown Lawrence street grid and under the I-495 Merrimack River ramps in North Andover which will add some design complexity (and thus may lengthen out implementation schedules a little), but shouldn’t be blockers. If CSX aims to uprate the Ayer-Portland corridor from Plate F (17′) to double-stack (20’6″) after acquiring Pan Am–as they’ve stated is their intention–they’re going to have to pay up because the ’76 agreement only protects incumbent clearances not future ones. If anything, time is of the essence because the T gets a much more favorable deal the faster they act on total northside electrification. If they can beat CSX to the punch with design standards for running under Haverhill Line wires they’ll net bigger freight $$$ contributions for any future clearance work.\n\nOn the southside. . .\n\n— The Worcester Line is no longer any concern. Thanks to the big 2008 line buy from CSX and relocation of major freight yards away from Boston, the Plate F (17′) route from Framingham to Allston was legally sunset in 2019 to total T control and the Autorack (19’6″) route from Westborough to Framingham was legally downgraded to Plate F (17′) in 2012. Both those sunsettings automatically serve up all of the +2.5 ft. of extra 25 kV clearance needed, so zero structural mods are necessary on a majority of the line. The only bridges known to need thorny modding work are both in Downtown Boston in the Mass Pike cut where freights never ran. In double-stack (20’6″) territory from Westborough to Worcester there’s only 6 overhead structures total, some of which are already tall enough for double-stacks under wires. Any that aren’t ready-made are quickie undercuts that should not add cost. CSX retains no booby-trap legalese giving them any say on whether or not the T can electrify…only indemnification that their stacks can continue running to Westborough in the end.\n\n— As part of the 2008 megadeal with CSX, an L-shaped Framingham-Walpole-Readville route was designated for Plate F (17′) protection so there was still at least one way on the southside to get high-and-wides into Boston. This encompasses the inner Franklin Line between Walpole Jct. and Readville Jct., 4 overhead bridges and a short Downtown Walpole tunnel. The Walpole tunnel might be a mildly difficult mod because of its 140-year age and Historic Register designation, but at least half of the bridges are over-provisioned newer structures so the rest of the corridor may get off scot free.\n\n— A zigzagging Framingham-Mansfield-Attleboro-Taunton route has Plate F clearances grandfathered from when the T bought a bunch of southside assets from Penn Central’s bankruptcy liquidation in 1973 (similar in function to the ’76 B&M northside deal). The only passenger territory included here is the Foxboro spur with only 1 overhead bridge, plus the already-electrified Mansfield-Attleboro NEC segment where Amtrak cleared everything accordingly 25 years ago. Probably zero costs here.\n\nIn all cases the “welfare” came from long-ago sale agreements that were *heavily* stacked in the state’s favor, and thus whatever incidental costs get accrued for bridge mods are in no way/shape/form going to add up to the kind of proposition where paying CSX or Pan Am a wad of “GO AWAY” money to sunset any more of the legacy provisions is going to make a lick of sense. It’s a way thornier proposition if you ever wanted to electrify the presently CSX-owned Inland Route from Worcester to Springfield, much less the entire corridor through the Berkshires to Albany. There’s 35 overhead structures between WOR-SPG, many of which were maxed out when CSX cleared the line to double-stack a decade ago…countless more through the Berkshires…and CSX will ask the moon from the public because it’s the incumbent owner. But that’s strictly an Inland intercity consideration. All of MBTA territory is largely sitting pretty."
