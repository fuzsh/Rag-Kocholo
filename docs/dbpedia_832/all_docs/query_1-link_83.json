        "text": "Does anyone know the exact nature of the rights and responsibilities of the MBTA and the ex B&M to operate on each other's tracks? What maintenance minimums does each owe the other? Who has the legal right of dispatching?\n\nCSX's rights were conveyed via B&M's 1976 asset sale agreement with the MBTA. B&M's successors pay $0 in trackage rights fees to use MBTA territory, but are responsible for maintenance on all non-MBTA used tracks within MBTA territory (examples: NH Main from Lowell Station to state line, Peabody Branch, Billerica Shops cluster, Greenville Branch). They retained dispatching authority over the Freight Main territory (Freight Main = Fitchburg Line west of Willows Jct. in Ayer, Haverhill Line north of Lowell Jct. in Andover), on a small Lowell Line overlap between Lowell Station and the former Lowell freight yards next to the Concord River, and anywhere the T doesn't run (though if T service were to resume the North Chelmsford-Lowell overlap on the NH Main would get re-grouped under the Freight Main's authority). The overlap east of Lowell Station to the former yards is supposed to go away if/when the MBTA ever gets around to reconfiguring the interlockings at Bleachery; they agreed to that during the 2008 GLX land swaps, but handover hasn't been implemented yet as the freight traffic is so sparse it hasn't been anyone's priority. That dispatching authority is also required to be staffed in-state (presently at the T's/Pan Am's joint Billerica operations center); it's booby-trapped from CSX ever moving those jobs out-of-state. The Freight Main was declared a protected high-and-wide clearance route by the '76 sale agreement, and so were the Wildcat Branch and Lowell Lines (done as a trade-in for the Fitchburg Cutoff so the Red Line could claim it); all are listed as such in the T's Commuter Rail design guide. The T can levy no restrictions on quantity of freight trains run by B&M's successors over any MBTA territory; the trackage rights are infinitely permissive on scheduling, subject only to common-courtesy dispatching priority of passenger trains where the T is dispatcher. However, years of Pan Am being Pan Am has whittled down the traffic to bare minimums and CSX's adherence to \"Precision Scheduling Railroading\" practices (i.e. running fewer trains longer and farther) doesn't figure to increase quantity of trains on the schedule even if they greatly increase carload business...so there'll never be a scenario where as many freight trains end up roaming the system as there was in 1976 when the agreement was crafted.\n\nB&M's successors retain right of first refusal to resumed freight service on any abandoned/landbanked lines should they be reactivated for service. Danvers Branch, Topsfield Branch, Stoneham Branch, North Reading Branch, and the like (East Boston Branch is considered out-of-service/non-abandoned, so rights are \"active\" there). Also included in the right-of-first-refusal is any renewed freight on the active Newburyport and Rockport Branches. Guilford/Pan Am filed freight (but obviously not passenger) abandonment north of Beverly Depot in 1984 to force discontinuance of service on the last few active freight customers north of Salem, so their trackage rights are currently considered extinguished there. So should any lines be reactivated or any new freight customers come calling on the upper Eastern Route...CSX would have to be offered as a courtesy, but if they don't want it the T can solicit other carriers (not that there'd really be any others).\n\nEDIT: As for maintenance minimums...B&M's successors are certainly obligated to pay for switches only they use, like freight customer switches and freight-only turnouts. And they are almost certainly obligated to pay in for interlocking maintenance on signalized switches they--and not passenger trains--primarily use (Salem Jct., the Yard 21 leads, Lawrence Yard switches, Billerica Shops interlocking, Everett Jct., Anderson RTC passing track, some crossovers). Standard railroad insurance would apply for property damage, such as derailing on passenger tracks or smacking a platform edge. But beyond that there's probably not much they're obligated to pay for. And Pan Am made a career out of ducking every possible expense, even when it worked against them. Even basic Freight Main maintenance in the T district post-'76 like cycled rail replacement has largely come through combo state and federal grants.\n\nCSX's rights were conveyed via B&M's 1976 asset sale agreement with the MBTA.

Does CSX now \"owe\" the T a certain level of maintenance if they ever decide to operate there?\n\nHow about Fitchburg west of Gardner?\n\nThey don't have trackage rights west of Westminster layover, so anything like the Northern Tier Passenger Rail Study would be subject to fresh negotiations.\n\nThe only 'foreign' territory where the T has trackage rights are:\n\nPan Am Southern, Fitchburg-Westminster\n\nCSX NH Mainline, state line to Concord (unused)\n\nCSX Worcester Branch, Worcester-Ayer (seldom used for non-revenue contingency moves)\n\nCSX Stony Brook Branch, Willows Jct. in Ayer to North Chelmsford Jct. (unused)\n\nCSX Lowell Branch, Lowell Station to Lowell Jct. in Andover (unused)\n\nCSX Western Route Mainline, state line to Plaistow @ end of double-track (unused...was intended for Haverhill-Plaistow extension until NH turfed that)\n\nThe T doesn't contribute to maintenance on the non-revenue and unused ex-Pan Am trackage. Per the 2008 PAR agreement those are considered \"Level 1\" trackage rights, with freights getting absolute scheduling priority and as-is maintenance. Fitchburg-Westminster is considered \"Level 2\", with passenger trains getting scheduling priority and the T contributing maint premiums. \"Level 1\" rights can be converted into \"Level 2\" rights (e.g. New Hampshire) with a passenger feasibility study that's advanced to build. It's a permissive deal that benefits the T overall, but came at the cost of the T forever waiving a per-carload fee on the ex-B&M that dates back to the '76 deal (pretty much the only maint contribution PAR was still obligated to pay for running on the shared mainlines). But that's just PAR being PAR...they'd give the shirt off their backs to avoid ever having to pay anyone anything for any reason."
