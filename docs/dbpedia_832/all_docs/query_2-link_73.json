        "text": "Did not know where to post this.\n\nIt appears that the long vacant decaying former Pawtucket and Central Falls Depot that sits above three tracks used by Amtrak, MBTA Commuter Rail, and the Providence & Worcester Railroad (freight) appears headed toward demolition. It was built after the tracks had been moved a bit west of downtown Pawtucket and sunk to avoid road crossings. The over 30,000 square foot brick and granite beaux-arts style structure opened in 1916. It had two levels; the upper level housed the 96’ by 64’ waiting room along with a barber shop, restaurant, ticket office, and baggage areas. The lower level had the outdoor track area with two island platforms providing access to all four tracks. Some 140 trains a day once stopped at the new station with an average of seventy thousand passenger departures a month. The station however began to decline in time as less people used the train for transportation with the rise of the auto and it was closed in 1959. It has mostly sat empty since then further deteriorating with time. Its location on a bend in the tracks no longer meets station site codes. That along with prohibitive renovation costs necessitated building the new station which opened in January-2023 just a bit to its southwest.\n\nDemolition will be a costly and very involved process as the large station sits over three very active tracks with two of them electrified. Furthermore, there is a new MBTA Commuter Rail station just to its south which requires commuter trains to reduce approach speeds in this stretch for stops.\n\nAll signs point toward demolition of old train station\n\nPAWTUCKET/CENTRAL FALLS – In the end, a viable future for the old Pawtucket/Central Falls Commuter Rail Station on the line between the two cities might not be viable after all,\n\nDistressing news: there is now a funded effort to abandon the freight line in Falmouth in favor of a rail-trail:\n\n\"State and local officials this week expressed confidence that train tracks leading to Joint Base Cape Cod can be removed to make way for the proposed bike path extension from North Falmouth to the Cape Cod Canal, something these same officials have said would never happen.\n\nThe change of heart stems from negotiations with base officials regarding relocation of the rail line now leading to the military base.\n\nAdditionally, the Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority said it can make $20 million in federal funding available to the project. Transit authority administrator Thomas S. Cahir said the federal dollars could cover the cost of the project “and cut 30 years off” getting the bike path extension done.\"\n\nYouTuber South Coast Rail Videos has a good summary here about how this abandonment would increase truck trips to and from the Cape and squander a grant that the railroad's customer Cassova received just a year ago.\n\nI was optimistic about the future of freight rail in Massachusetts with the CSX merger and ongoing IRAP grants. But between this and the Peabody abandonment, it seems like things are still in a phase of retrenchment. Not to mention the fact that this only digs the hole deeper against any future efforts to reestablish passenger service to Woods Hole for the ferry connection.\n\nWrit-large, this is yet another case that is making me hostile to rail trails. I used to think that the trail-rail conflict was manageable, for instance through a rail-with-trail like you see along the GLX in Somerville. But in this case, a rail-with-trail option is on the table and there is nonetheless a push for abandonment because it is a much cheaper way of getting the trail. It's hard not be hostile to rail-trails as a concept when there are cases like this.\n\nDistressing news: there is now a funded effort to abandon the freight line in Falmouth in favor of a rail-trail:\n\nYouTuber South Coast Rail Videos has a good summary here about how this abandonment would increase truck trips to and from the Cape and squander a grant that the railroad's customer Cassova received just a year ago.\n\nI was optimistic about the future of freight rail in Massachusetts with the CSX merger and ongoing IRAP grants.

It's hard not be hostile to rail-trails as a concept when there are cases like this.\n\nThe \"rail line relocation\" plan is pretty much garbage. A 2-mile spur off the Cape Main near Bourne rotary that dead-ends by the Bourne landfill, a full 8 miles from Cassova and 5 miles from the Joint Base. It's a more than useless trade-in, and Mass Coastal is digging in hard to oppose it. They've already sabre-rattled in public meetings and to the press that they'll defend their territorial rights to the Falmouth Secondary in front of the Surface Transportation Board, and contractually with MassDOT (they were recently renewed for another decade as the freight rail operator for the Cape).\n\nI'm not sure who in MassDOT is listening to the bike lobby, but they should know better. The trail plan will get slapped away in an instant in front of the STB if Mass Coastal and Cassova file an adverse abandonment injunction. It literally has almost no chance given the caselaw precedent. And the next step after handing the state a loss in front of the STB would be for Mass Coastal to seek breach-of-contract damages from MassDOT in a lawsuit over those recently renewed trackage rights and all those targeted track work grants. MassDOT lawyers are probably telling those officials \"Shut up shut up shut up!\" for giving this whole scheme a cloak of legitimacy (however uncoordinated), because MC ain't fucking around with its legal threats or the confidence they have that the feds will uphold precedent.\n\nYes...depressing nonetheless that we still have divide-and-conquer weaponization to this degree. There was a real rail-with-trail study done here, and while it was an expensive prospect it was at least an earnest attempt to placate everybody. The bike lobby didn't even feign interest in that; they've been full-on from Day 1 for the earth-salting. As you said, they pay for it immediately in truck traffic, and Cape Cod Central gets deprived of some of its most scenic route for the dinner train (which, if the state invested in a wye leg at Cape Jct., could ping all the way from Hyannis to North Falmouth encompasing the entire Lower Cape).\n\nOff Facebook...You can see how bold the bike path group is getting...\n\nBen Converse discussion on Facebook\n\nOur notorious friend, Kenneth Cheitlin, is making some serious moves and getting community support to remove more rail mileage on Cape Cod. He has support from local elected officials as well as CCRTA's Tom Cahir, who now seems to feel that the Falmouth Secondary should be eliminated.\n\nFor those who feel that the removal of this branch will be impossible, please consider the following:\n\nMr. Cheitlin announced that his group is planning to disrupt Mass Coastal's contract renewal next year, and is preparing a case to present to the state that the railroad is bad for the community. While it sounds far fetched, their success so far in convincing state officials is notable.\n\nMr. Cheitlin admitted that his group has submitted FOIA requests for Mass Coastal's financial records in an attempt to prove that the railroad is \"making no money\". This is an aggressive escalation on their part.\n\nMr. Cheitlin also suggested that the state has revenue thresholds that the railroad will not meet, per their FOIA requests for financial records, therefore justifying abandonment.\n\nThe group has been successful in convincing elected officials that rail does not \"benefit the community\", an absurd and provincial argument.\n\nFor those of us who live on Cape Cod, I really think it's time to get serious about challenging this effort. I know many of us have been reticent to do so - we are a group of railfans, and this is a thorny issue. But if we want to prevent more rail mileage from being destroyed, I think we'll have to fight for this one.\n\nI am planning on writing an op-ed for the Enterprise. A meeting with Senator Moran (for those of us who are her constituents) may also be worthwhile. Stating the obvious, but Mass Coastal may need to have a defensive legal strategy lined up. These people will not quit, and they have money to burn on their effort."
