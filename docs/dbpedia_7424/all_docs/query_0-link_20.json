        "text": "Background\n\nThe Illusions Gaming Company was a game development studio launched by Darren Bartlett and James Coliz, former Virgin Interactive employees. The company primarily produced point-and-click adventure games. Illusion went defunct in 1999 under unknown circumstances.\n\n1st Logo (August 8, 1993-September 1995)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, the grey word \"illusions\" is present. Different animations occur for each letter; the dot in the \"i\" drops down into the stem before popping back up, an electrical current travels up between the \"ll\"s, drips occur inside the \"u\", the \"s\" rotates counterclockwise, the second \"i\" is upside down and swaying, the dot in the \"o\" shifts around simulating eye movement and the left leg of the \"n\" moves upward in a hammer-like fashion, striking the \"s\" next to it. A spotlight shines on the text, rendering it still and white, while the text \"an illusions gaming company creation\" is seen below.\n\nVariants: On Super Caesar's Palace, the end product is smoother, and the bottom text appears sooner.\n\nTechnique: Simple 2D animation.\n\nAudio: None or the opening theme of the game.\n\nAudio Variant: On the SEGA Genesis port of Super Caesar's Palace, there is a bit-crunched thumping noise, done in tune to the animation.\n\nAvailability: Appeared on Super Caesar's Palace and the SEGA Genesis version of Scooby-Doo Mystery.\n\n2nd Logo (October 31, 1996-March 7, 1999)\n\nVisuals: A boy is hiding under his bed with his dog, everything being surrounded by three shadowy monsters, briefly illuminated by a lighting flash. The boy stands on his bed and shines his flashlight, revealing the big purple word \"illusions\". The flashlight's bulb bursts, as the boy shakes it the monsters close in on him and everything is engulfed in darkness as the boy is eaten.\n\nVariant: When the logo debuted, the last second of the logo is cut out.\n\nTechnique: Cartoony sprite animation.\n\nAudio: An ominous fanfare with a thunderclap, segueing into a more intense theme, along with sounds corresponding to the actions.\n\nAudio Variant: On its debut, a slightly different arrangement is heard and the sound effects are absent."
