        "text": "1\n\nMember_the_game\n\nOther than Fifa the only other EA game I'd have the slightest bit of interest in is Need for speed\n\n2\n\nozwally\n\nI can honestly say the CEO Andrew Wilson is probably doing a great job for investors, earning them increased profits, however his customer relations is abysmal and strategy for the company leave a lot to be desired\n\n3\n\nLemmy_the_Koopa\n\nGonna be honest, I am not missing EA, thevlqst title I enjoyed was Dead Space 2 and did not bother with part 3, once they shoehorned multiplayer and microtransactions into the series...\n\n4\n\nTrikeboy\n\n\"We are absolutely looking at more Switch games in our portfolio\"\n\nDo you know that scene in the movie Airplane! where Leslie Nielsen's nose grows longer as he lies? This is what I'm imagining as I read those comments from EA.\n\nI want Star Wars games on my Switch, start with Rogue Squadron Trilogy by partnering with Factor 5 and Epic Games please.\n\n5\n\nglaemay\n\nEA games are made without the work of any game designer. Their gameplay is standardized and is lacking any kind of creativity. Even worse. The gameplay of games like Fifa are made to be frustrative on purpose to push the player to buy microtransactions. EA isn't the worst videogame company for the big profits it makes. It's the worst for completely denying the creativity and the art of game design. Everytime you buy a EA product you're funding people who do everything they can to kill the uniqueness of the videogame medium.\n\n6\n\nZyph\n\nI prefer EA to just continue \"looking\" to be perfectly honest. I mean, how many times did they said this already ffs?\n\n7\n\nDaftbomb\n\nremembers EA stopped making decent games post gamecube\n\nPls... no\n\n8\n\nBenAV\n\nMakes zero difference to me which games they do and don't decide to bring to the Switch as I won't be buying a single one of them regardless.\n\n9\n\nPorllM\n\nKinda strange that Madden has never happened\n\n10\n\nSillyG\n\nBull. Absolute bull.\n\nAll EA have given us so far are FIFA 18, 19, Fe, and Unraveled Two.\n\nThat's it.\n\nAnd FIFA 20 will be a \"legacy edition\", which basically means that they're about to give up on the platform entirely.\n\nAs for their other brands, I used to love The Sims, but EA has destroyed the franchise beyond recognition. They proudly displayed the \"100 Million Sold\" stickers on The Sims 2 products back in the day, but due to their idiocy and greed they will never see those numbers again.\n\nI wish EA would just die so that their licences and brands can be placed in safer hands.\n\n11\n\nBlackenedHalo\n\nnobody cares about filthy EA's games\n\n12\n\nNotTelevision\n\nI guess it’s a “wait and see” if Jedi Fallen Order is any good, but what new games are they releasing... A handful of sports games and a new Battlefield somewhere down the line?\n\nI’ll pass.\n\n13\n\nFazermint\n\nProud owner of zero EA Switch games.\n\n14\n\nGrailUK\n\nDigital business practice these days is offer your app free to everybody and appeal to their ego/vanity for a small (disproportionate) fee, or play on their anxiety by taking away the convenience if they don't subscribe to a service. Erm...does anyone actually give a flying fig that that's how drug dealers operate? Loot boxes, surprise mechanics, grinding. I don't want such nefarious activities coercing kids to spend money. It's morally corrupt. Releasing the same games every year is creatively bankrupt.\n\nYou have a lot of work to do EA to garner trust with this community. However, this community values effort and honesty. It's not impossible...but you will forgive us for thinking it's not going to happen.\n\nBloody surprise mechanics. Lol.\n\n15\n\nkopaka\n\nSo, more EA Sports then\n\n16\n\nUncle_Franklin\n\nGive us full FIFA or go to hell.\n\n17\n\nsanderev\n\nPlease Nintendolife, report on actual games coming to the Switch. Reading for the 100th time that EA is looking to bring over games actually helps nobody except the ad-clicks.\n\n18\n\nnkarafo\n\nI would like Burnout Paradise at 60 fps please and Crysis games and a Star Wars new title, exclusive only to Nintendo Switch as Rogue Squadron etc.\n\n19\n\nWaluigifan\n\nPlease make a new Tiger Woods PGA Tour. k thx bye\n\n20\n\nsanderev\n\n@Silly_G The Sims 4 is still a decent game by EA's standards. The Sims 4 is absolutely the ONLY EA game I would consider buying on the Switch.\n\n21\n\nOld-Red\n\n\"All hope is not lost.\" EA are gross, no thanks. The switch is better off without their disgusting predatory practices.\n\n22\n\ncarlos82\n\nNo thanks EA, you have literally no games of any interest and you think its perfectly acceptable to sell and in game hammer for £150 so you can just **** ***\n\nI do find it funny that Nintendolife chose a picture of the footballing equivalent of EA for the article\n\n23\n\nnhSnork\n\nInsert traditional fan rant about EA demons, bla bla bla. As for a serious comment, I'm still not really interested in FIFA, I still have Fe and Unraveled 2 on my wishlist and I still welcome as many EA ports as Switch will ever get. With a bias for stuff like NFS and Dragon Age (EA Replay might be neat as well). Happy to help \"destroy the industry\", my dudes.\n\n24\n\nOnkel_Laser\n\nF**k off, EA. You screwed up Fifa on Switch big time.\n\n25\n\nCarterDucote\n\nAll the games they bring over will be legacy editions 😂\n\n26\n\nMoon\n\nPlants Vs Zombies is all I want from them. Maybe Dead Space.\n\n27\n\nBunkerneath\n\nI’m sure they said that they weren’t looking into switch.\n\nNow they can’t wait to bring really cut down games and micro transactions to the switch to rip off all Nintendo players\n\n28\n\nItachi2099\n\nThis is just bull PR talk, I’d understand with something like Battlefield and NFS maybe, they’re bigger games and they’re much harder to port to a handheld, but they’re ignoring the Switch even with their smaller scale games which would surely do better than their mediocre Fifa ports.\n\nBurnout Paradise Remaster? No Switch version.\n\nThe Sims 4? No Switch version.\n\nThe new Plants vs Zombiez Garden Warfare game? NO SWITCH VERSION.\n\n29\n\nTimppis\n\nYeah.\n\nYou can translate that quite easily. It's \"Nope\".\n\n30\n\nAnti-Matter\n\n\"Less than a month ago, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said Switch owners chose to play the company's games on other platforms when asked about the possibility of The Sims coming to Nintendo's system.\"\n\nOh, Please EA.... !!!\n\nThe Sims 4 for Nintendo Switch...!!!\n\n#TeamTheSims4ForNintendoSwitch\n\n31\n\nJUDAH-LYON\n\nI would like to see Medal of Honor 2010, Medal of Honor Warfighter, BF3, Army of two the devil's cartel, Crysis Trilogy, mass effect Trilogy, plants vs zombies, syndicate and NFS. I would pay for those asap.\n\n32\n\nspirit_flame\n\nTimes must be tough at EA. It's honestly been so long that they might as well be Atari to me.\n\n33\n\nLegendofCreed\n\nSo which is it EA? Is the Switch worth developing for or not? I dont think I've seen a company more averse to make actual profit.\n\n34\n\nSlain\n\nI can't think of any EA games I want on Switch. They just don't make any games that appeal to me.\n\n35\n\nConanLives\n\nI'd love madden or the NHL games to come to switch. NHL is even already on an older engine then madden and FIFA so might be an easier port.\n\nEA were inevitably going to change tack as the install base grew and it became apparent the switch was a success, its what made the comments the other month seem so odd. I'm personally really excited for potentially more sports and fps games on the console, not sure which of ea's fps games would be the easiest to port but of the current line up I'd imagine they must be looking at Apex Legends.\n\n36\n\nKryptoniteKrunch\n\nLmao, nice flip flopping, EA. 🙄\n\nCan't say I care too much about modern EA...Seems like every non-sports game they put out anymore is just disappointment after disappointment.\n\n37\n\nechoplex\n\nShe just said EA was acknowledging the Switch’s existence in PR tongue, just so Switch users stop feeling alienated by EA after that CEO’s abysmally stupid comment, and there’s nothing to ‘hope’ (we’re talking about EA games) for beyond that.\n\n38\n\nZuljaras\n\nI detest EA. I do not care about their modern games.\n\n39\n\neltomo\n\nMadden, not even bothered if it's a dumbed down version.\n\n40\n\nVolmun\n\nwe dont want to do stuff for Switch as were still but hurt over not being aloud to have 100% control over the WiiUs e shop sees switch selling well We have always been big fans of Nintendo and everything thay do!\n\nGod dame slimy gits... get lost alredy\n\n41\n\nxHHHx\n\nI thought EA was not interested in the Platform since it was the weakest spec. wise from the others, maybe now they can support it better (although I doubt that) instead of their miserable failures such as ME Andromeda and Anthem, maybe they could re-release Dead Space Trilogy, Mass Effect Trilogy or Dragon Age since they are one of their decent titles\n\n42\n\nJonasty198460\n\nGive me burnout Paradise, and maybe ill open my wallet after a long time for EA\n\n43\n\nStocksy\n\nMadden, NHL, Burnout, anything Star Wars and need for speed.... mass effect.. please... nba jam.\n\n44\n\nAmbermoon\n\n@Trikeboy\n\nWhy lying?\n\nThey maybe are really looking at more Switch games in their portfolio, just not releasing them. 😉\n\n45\n\nDarknyht\n\nI liked some games EA produced, but short of NHL or a heavily discounted Mass Effect Trilogy I am not that interested. They missed their opportunity and I’ve found other games to play and enjoy. Wouldn’t even care about Hockey if another 2K edition released.\n\n46\n\nantster1983\n\nI bet he didn't say that with a straight face.\n\n47\n\nTantani\n\nThank you but no thank you\n\nI hope FIFA 20 will fail on the switch as those a$$holes give us a freaking legacy addition and cheated us 2 years in a row with bad versions\n\nI didn’t buy fifa for Switch and will never do\n\nI don’t buy any EA game at all now because they all become so bad in the last few years\n\n48\n\nMjJmediablogger\n\nEA are loathed in the US - a company that are lazy programmers with profit only on their minds. I stay away from their lazy programming now.\n\n49\n\nZHATLIDS\n\nIf EA reads these comments 😬 The correct answers are NHL, Madden, and Apex\n\n50\n\nthenikdavies\n\nSuch non-news. A big company like EA looks at EVERY platform let alone one of the big three.\n\n51\n\nhadrian\n\nThey should do a compilation of their older stuff, they did one for PSP but I dunno if it was well done or not but people would eat up the Strike games, Road Rash, retro sports titles, older Need For Speed and maybe do \"remastered\" Medal of Honour titles.\n\nThere is a lot of untapped potential for when EA were making great games.\n\n52\n\nHolyGeez03\n\nBring back the BIG series... those games are better suited for Switch and its audience.\n\n53\n\nemhardesty\n\nThe last game under EA I ever cared for was Dragon Age: Origins and that was forever ago. They're never going to remaster it so meh...\n\n54\n\nArnold-Kage\n\nSorry but not buying this. Just last month or so the switch was not good enough ,and now they want to bring more of their successful franchises.\n\nWell nobody wants sports games with watered down features like fifa for 60 bucks. So they can keep their franchises to themselves. If their willing to actually give switch owners the same features as they do on other consoles I may rethink my position on them\n\n55\n\ncontrarian\n\n@Lemmy_the_Koopa\n\nAnd the team at visceral had such great ideas for part 3 and the coop multiplayer.\n\n56\n\nCupidStunt\n\nThey can keep to other consoles. I never but their games. They make games for the masses, not for gamers, and try to milk as much money out of people with unethical practices.\n\n57\n\nMountain_Man\n\nI'll take Madden and whatever the latest golf game is, please.\n\n58\n\nlocky-mavo\n\nThey don’t even need to put new games on the Switch, ports older games like Dead Space, BF: Bad Company, Mass Effect Trilogy, Crisis, Dragon Age.\n\nBut mostly I just want Star Wars games on Switch. Why did Disney go and make that idiotic deal with EA? Give us Bounty Hunter, Commandos, Rogue Squadron, KotoR, Jedi Knight and Battlefront.\n\nSadly, no matter what they say in supporting the Switch, none of it will happen, even with the Switch literally outpacing the PS4 and XB1 in the same timeframe. It’s their loss I suppose.\n\n59\n\nOnkel_Laser\n\n@Tantani Nah it won't fail. Information asymmetry is too high. Parents who have no clue, will buy this legacy crap for their 9year old kids.\n\n60\n\nMinish-Cap\n\nIt has been since Madden 2013, that Madden has been on a Nintendo console. It has been too long... I have had many consoles since then, I haven't been happy with them, Sony and Microsoft don't have as many great games unless you want to play something rated M. I grew up Nintendo, I know great games do not have to be rated M. Shooting games don't interest me much, except Splatoon and Star Wars. All this said, Madden already came out, NHL isn't planned for the Switch. Would they release them late?\n\n61\n\nStarrebirth\n\nFor the Switch Pro? Because current gen Madden, NBA Live, Battlefield, Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, etc. won’t run good (or at all) on the current Switch. They need to invest in ports of classic games or new Indies for Switch.\n\n62\n\nUboaNoticedYou\n\nI'm not interested in anything they've published past 2016, tbh. I'd love ports of some of their legacy sofware, like Bad Company 2, Mirror's Edge, Burnout Paradise, Skate 3, etc. But unless they're porting over Titanfall 2 or Battlefield 1, their modern output does nothing for me.\n\n63\n\nLoveGiant\n\nI find this hilarious after not 18 days ago EA was in another headline that stated \"Electronic Arts Says Its Customers Just Aren't That Interested In Switch Versions\". Now 18 days later I wonder what changed. Oh right, money.\n\n64\n\nrosenband\n\nGive us Star Wars\n\n65\n\nZeraki\n\nOther than the Mass Effect trilogy they have nothing I would want.\n\n66\n\nThesharkfromjaws\n\nI know everyone hates sports games but if they released an NHL game on the Switch I'd be all over it. I'm kinda shocked they haven't.\n\n67\n\nParasolStars\n\nGW2, Sims 4, Madden, and the new Need for Speed make sense on Switch in my book.\n\n68\n\nOrshudei\n\nWhat would you like to see it publish on Switch?\n\nAh ha ha ha! 🤣 Oh, you were serious...\n\n69\n\nDman10\n\nNHL please, I don't care if it is an inferior version, I just want NHL on Switch. Also, Mass Effect Trilogy and some of the Dragon's Age games.\n\n70\n\nModdedInkling\n\nLooks like EA is trying to clean up the mess they caused weeks ago when they said that all Switch owners apparently have other consoles to play EA's games.\n\n71\n\nCosats\n\nWARNING: This comment contains product placement\n\nEA's chief studios officer, Laura Miele, will bring the next big EA game to Switch called, \"Miele, Anything Else Is a Compromise - Kitchen Simulation\".\n\n72\n\nMathieu_B\n\nEA has successful games?\n\n73\n\nChayshirin\n\nThanks, but no thanks.\n\n74\n\nantster1983\n\nIf I were to get any EA games that could potentially come to the Switch, they would probably be PGA Tour (if they choose to revive the series), Grand Slam Tennis, SSX, NBA Street (or NBA Jam), Need for Speed or Dead Space.\n\n75\n\nJohn_Deacon\n\nThanks. Next developer, please\n\n76\n\nnintendoPLAYROOM\n\nScrew off EA...\n\nThey obviously have no plan whatsoever with their games. If there was a detailed plan then surely upper management would be playing “he said, she said”. That is one company I would absolutely love to see take a nosedive.\n\n77\n\nToneDeath\n\n@glaemay What's sad is that EA is supposed to stand for \"Electronic Arts\" and early on their MO was to put the designers and programmers at the front and center of the work (I mean actual names on the front of the box!).\n\nAnyhoo, Road Rash II would be nice on the Switch. M2 have done most of the work for them already in emulating it for the Mega Drive/Genesis Mini.\n\n78\n\nStocksy\n\nAnybody just bashing EA and saying all their games are rubbish are trying too hard to be cool and edgy... EA have published some amazing games\n\n@antster1983 yes! Some I forgot - dead space and SSX.... any of the street games would be good.\n\n79\n\ndimi\n\nIts been near 3 years the Switch is out.It already got bigger install base in Japan than PS4. And the greedy fellas of EA are still looking if they want to invest or not? I liked some EA games when i was a kid, but not they are all loot boxes and money farming. They are the ones left out.\n\n80\n\nZach\n\nThe time for looking has passed!! Now is the time for action!!\n\n81\n\nLow\n\nEA is a blight. Yes they’ve made some good games and it’d be nice to see them on Switch but I can pass on the basis that they are horrible to their developers and gamers as a whole.\n\n82\n\nLow\n\nStill amazed they were responsible for Henry Hatsworth, still one of the best DS games of all time.\n\n83\n\nEdu23XWiiU\n\nBack on the GC era, EA made the best games: 007 Everything or Nothing, 007 From Russia with Love, The Lord of the Rings, Time Splitters, Def Jam: Fight for New York, Batman Begins, Marvel Nemesis, even FIFA was awesome back then, FIFA Street was great fun! Back then, they would have done the best Star Wars games!\n\n84\n\nRyu_Niiyama\n\nThe funny thing is aside from their sports games now is the time to port legacy content as there are gaps they can fill using last gen games. Port ME and DA (not a fan of either franchise anymore but well aware that is free money for EA) we can’t get a snowboard game so port ssx, port need for speed, and don’t they have a shooter they can toss on the system as well? Never seen on Nintendo ports are selling and it’s still an untapped market and porting older games should keep investors happy as it is less investment. (Although I think they should put together a Switch dev team in house. Leearn the system and port the games.)\n\nWhatever EA gonna EA.\n\n85\n\nAnti-Matter\n\nSigh...\n\nPeoples keep bashing EA. 🙄\n\nYo, let's support THE SIMS 4 for Nintendo Switch !!\n\n86\n\nAvaloner\n\nJust bring Skate 3 and SSX to the Switch. A new IP would also be nice.\n\n87\n\nCaPPa\n\nIts always the same story with EA. They'll mock Nintendo customers and then when they realize they are missing out on money they do an about turn.\n\nI haven't cared about their games since they made fun of Wii U owners. Call me an idiot and a loser then expect me to buy your trash? I dont think so EA.\n\n88\n\nBornInNorway81\n\nEA, I am proud to be an individual that hasn’t spent money on a game from you since Sim City 4. For all the studios you have absorbed and closed, and the game series you’ve ruined with greedy monetisation, just keep “looking”, please.\n\n89\n\nDahn_\n\nThanks but no thanks.\n\nBy the way, if you're going to say you have ''invested'', make sure that was actually true.\n\n90\n\nidrawrobots\n\nOh, like NFS Heat, Star Wars Jedi, Apex Legends, Sims 4, and Anthem?\n\nOr a Madden built on last generation engine with missing features?\n\n91\n\nBornInNorway81\n\n@Stocksy\n\n“Anybody just bashing EA and saying all their games are rubbish are trying too hard to be cool and edgy... EA have published some amazing games”\n\nSo, I am trying to be cool and edgy? I didn’t know. I guess I do learn something new every day.\n\nPraising EA for a couple good games amongst hundreds of decisions showing how much they loathe their customers, is perhaps like saying “I heard Hitler was a good father”.\n\n92\n\nconstrux\n\nYou deliberately killed FIFA on the Switch, liars!\n\nAnd since it's extremely plagued by the built-in cheating system on other consoles, 19 was the last FIFA I bought.\n\nThere!\n\nYou're looking at the Switch??\n\nI guess then you should look much, much, much harder!\n\n93\n\nNINtendo242\n\nOh really? Well, most likely only their latest cash grab mini update games like Sims and Fifa.\n\nI wouldn't mind a Dead Space collection, especially since they killed the franchise anyway. But even if not, than at least the first game. Should be an easy port.\n\nOther games coming in my mind are Crysis but I dont see those being playable on Switch. Would be a funny selling point though if they released the first Crysis on it. But can it run Crysis? Yes, yes it can.\n\nAlso American McGees Alice and Alice Madness Returns would be great games on Switch.\n\n94\n\nAnti-Matter\n\n@NINtendo242\n\nThe Sims 4 on Nintendo Switch and i will die in happiness.\n\n95\n\nlink3710\n\nIf they want to give us ports of Dragon Age (trilogy?) Or Mass Effect Trilogy, I'd be in. Or any EA Originals. But any of their modern stuff...?\n\n96\n\nAozz101x\n\nEA: \"We have no plans to bring our games to Switch\"\n\nEA: \"Er, actually... We change our minds! We are bringing our games to Switch. ^-^' \"\n\n97\n\nLoveGiant\n\n@Anti-Matter You'd pay another 600 bucks to get all of The Sims 4 just on Switch?\n\n98\n\nAgramonte\n\nJust do things like Sea of Solitude and The Sims. And give SIMS Cross Save with PC (like CIV6) for Switch LITE users.\n\nPeople who are fans of Sports, Online Shooters and Racing games already have (or want) a Home Console/PC and will keep buying them there.\n\nIf they can't make the same game on Switch (obvious at this point) they will not jump over anyway.\n\n99\n\nAnti-Matter\n\n@LoveGiant\n\nWhy not ?\n\nI love The Sims 4. 😍😘\n\nI know the DLC are kinda pricey but not all the DLC and Expansion packs are expensive.\n\nThere are some cheap bundles (3 contents in 1) just for $25 for the cheapest or $50 for 3 contents in 1 (Usually 1 Expansion Pack + 2 Add On stuffs)\n\nI know I have to spend more money for All DLC and Expansion packs but those contents deliver satisfaction for me to enjoy The Sims 4 in designing beautiful houses, creating some handsome six pack guys, designing my own stores / shops from Getting to Work expansion pack, etc.\n\n100\n\nmunstahunta\n\nBring NHL and all canadian switch owner will buy it.\n\n101\n\nKissMyFlapjack\n\n\"Good Success\" equates to the dreaded FIFA \"Legacy Edition\" in just the third year.\n\nWhile I would certainly welcome a Madden (Switch doesn't have a single american football game on it yet!) or a Dead Space, only a braindead company wouldn't realize the possibility of profits in porting The Sims, Peggle, Plants vs. Zombies and others to the Switch.\n\n102\n\nJasonmd\n\nIs that a threat EA?\n\n103\n\nantster1983\n\n@Edu23XWiiU Free Radical made TimeSplitters, EA only published the third game. THQ Nordic now hold the rights to TimeSplitters.\n\n@flapjack-ashley There's Mutant Football League, but that isn't a pure American Football game like the Madden games. I forgot about all the Popcap IPs as well like Plants vs. Zombies and Peggle!\n\n104\n\nIllusion\n\nDragon Age Trilogy and Desert Strike would be nice. Otherwise EA makes a lot of meh games.\n\n105\n\nGrailUK\n\n@Ryu_Niiyama You make far too much sense We prefer games to services, so they certainly need to 'go back' to their games instead of crowbarring their services into our culture.\n\n106\n\nSpicyBurrito16\n\nThe only EA games I want to see on the Switch are Burnout 3 or Paradise, Need For Speed Heat, the NHL series, and some kind of Sim City game. Oh, and i’ll throw in The Sims 4 or a Sims 3 remaster because I’m a geek for simulation games.\n\n107\n\nStocksy\n\n@BornInNorway81 your reply just backs up my point.\n\nEA is just like hitler yes.\n\nEA make some terrible terrible decisions but that doesn’t make all their games terrible. My comment was that anyone claiming all their games are terrible are trying too hard to hate.\n\nEspecially as so many publishers are just as bad as EA. Let’s boycott gaming.\n\nAs you were pal.\n\n108\n\nfahdriyami\n\nThe same people here demanding \"full FIFA\" on Switch will also complain when EA releases it and it runs like a PowerPoint presentation.\n\nPeople forget that the Switch is running on mobile hardware. iOS is far more popular than the Switch yet you dont see full FIFA on it either. That's for a reason.\n\n109\n\nAnnoyingFrenzy\n\nMass Effect trilogy please\n\n110\n\nYagaMaki\n\nThese are empty words. First release a decent amount of games that weren't watered down and then I'll take you seriously!\n\n111\n\nAnti-Matter\n\n@SpicyBurrito16\n\nYo, we are in the same team for The Sims 4 on Nintendo Switch. 😉\n\n#TeamTheSims4ForNintendoSwitch 🤟\n\n112\n\nArnold-Kage\n\n@locky-mavo\n\nSimole EA gave them the biggest bag of money. Still because of EA we did get an Disney that is at the moment only trusting the best studios with exception to Ea A because of the licence deal in regards to SW.\n\nDoes anyone know when that deal expires anyway?\n\n113\n\nManah\n\nYou really believe \"we're looking at [x]\" means anything other than \"if we outright say no it's bad for business\"?\n\n114\n\nKing_Bowser\n\nI honestly hope that they will give back the rights of American Mcgee’s Alice and Alice Madness to American.. they didn’t want to release a 3rd game or even to remaster the first game.\n\nThey can release the HP games, I would buy..\n\n115\n\nsuikoden\n\nJust seems to me.he opened his mouth without all the facts and then he suddenly found out how well the switch is selling and back peddled to make the board of directors happy\n\n116\n\nncb1397\n\n@ozwally\n\n\"I can honestly say the CEO Andrew Wilson is probably doing a great job for investors, earning them increased profits,\"\n\nlol, not at all....\n\n\"Electronic Arts (EA) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.02 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.01. This compares to earnings of $0.26 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\"\n\n117\n\nsuikoden\n\n@Anti-Matter\n\nIt supposedly doesn't run that great on ps4 and Xbox so hate to see how it runs on the switch it it's true\n\n118\n\nSmileMan64\n\nEA? Ew.\n\nOnly game I may buy from them would be a Mass Effect Trilogy with all DLC. Apart from that, nothing else.\n\n119\n\nJoeynator3000\n\n....So I guess the new Plants vs. Zombies game is very likely, then....we'll see how that game turns out, then. Still extremely skeptical, though....it's still EA. >_>\n\n120\n\nWoosh193\n\n@AnnoyingFrenzy\n\nLol. , Never !!!!!!!!\n\n121\n\nAnti-Matter\n\n@suikoden\n\nI played the Sims 4 PS4 version and it was pretty good.\n\nI could navigate the pointer with just PS4 controller.\n\nDespite lack of Custom Contents for The Sims (Possibly it will ruin the game since i want to play it normally without any 18+ mods) i'm already content with The Sims 4 console version.\n\n122\n\nTOUGHDUDE94\n\ni did buy unravaled 2 and re and why dose it need a contact with the game.and you could not put 1 out also thanks EA you make me hate you more if a need for speed game on the switch is online online only i will not buy\n\n123\n\nDoofenshmirtz\n\nNo, stay away, begone\n\n124\n\nDoofenshmirtz\n\n@Kainbrightside well I mean EA itself has no warmth or soul so\n\n125\n\nEVIL-C\n\nThat is total and utter bullshit. Ha, EA your hypocracy is showing.\n\n126\n\nRyu_Niiyama\n\n@GrailUK I am just trying to think of reasonable ways that everyone wins. I get that Frostbyte is a one way street but they already made a fork/custom solution with fifa. Since Switch has a few more years and the twins are winding down why not pull together a Switch team (they shut down teams all the time. Give those folks jobs) put them on port duty for the easy sellers and try to figure out if they can keep modifying the custom. No game engine should be obsolete in two years. Unless the suits are calling the shots. (My company did something similar with our accounting software recently which made more useless work for my department and now they are rolling it back which is more work because nobody bothered to talk to my boss. ) At this point EA needs good will. Not every mutiplaform gamer is gonna give EA a free pass. These are products... I don’t care if they actually hate Nintendo, you want my money you need to put games on my favorite system.\n\n127\n\nozwally\n\n@ncb1397 haha nice to see justice be done, EA’s practices deserve that result\n\n128\n\nGrailUK\n\n@Ryu_Niiyama You get my vote for CEO\n\n129\n\nNintendoByNature\n\nHaven't cared for an ea game in years any way. I know some do, but they just don't appeal to me anymore. I did buy fifa a couple years back and before that was Madden maybe (16 Or 17). And that was only because my wife went out and got it for me unknowingly. Not that I'm not unthankful, but I had no intentions of getting the same game every year. They've milked enough money out of me year after year of Madden\n\n130\n\nJoeyboots80\n\nSims 4 or GTFO EA.\n\n131\n\nbratzdoll\n\nMass Effect Trilogy, Dragon Age, The Sims... I would like to see it.\n\n132\n\ndiablo2\n\nThis is where you're wrong, NintendoLife:\n\n\"this didn't go down well with owners of hybrid device. In an attempt to improve relations....\"\n\nThey're looking to improve relations with the investors that pushed back last month, not with the gamers.\n\n133\n\nmousieone\n\nNope, you didn’t want us before; you don’t get us now.\n\n134\n\nSakuraHaruka\n\nWell, as I had said on other occasions on the same topic (EA and Nintendo), for me, the only franchises I've kept following from EA are Need For Speed, Sim City, My Sims / The Sims and Burnout, and obviously, I expect some new game from them on the Switch, but we have to accept it, EA expects 2 things, that the games sell as if they were FIFA and their investors see with \"good\" eyes the performance of EA games on Switch (yes, more money) and Well, that, well, they make it look complicated, but I better not extend my comments, I just hope that if it is true the ?? time they say there will be EA games on a Nintendo system since the last ones that have come out on Wii U (No, I don´t include FIFA), that really that will be true!\n\n135\n\nN00BiSH\n\nIsn't EA Nintendose-Intolerant?\n\n136\n\nGlitterChubb\n\nSea of Solitude needs to be on Switch.\n\n137\n\npopey1980\n\nAbsolute BS from a horrid company. (sorry for the nearly swear on your website NL, but that company really is the worst).\n\n138\n\nRazer\n\nNo thanks.\n\nDon't want EA dirt on here.\n\n139\n\nLord\n\nNo thanks it's bad enough we have ubisoft soiling the console.\n\n140\n\nMchi5\n\nProbably will never happen but just give us a Madden on the Switch. If it can run on a PS Vita surely it can on the switch\n\n141\n\nRiasGremory\n\nscrew EA they can keep their games switch doesnt need them.\n\n142\n\nSupadav03\n\nI’ll believe it when it happens. EA is one of the biggest in the industry yet has 2-3 games on Switch. It’s ridiculous. And time & time again we hear how the “love” the Switch and want to support it more & more. Nothing but lip service.\n\n143\n\nZulzar\n\nEA hasn't made a legitimate game since the 90's. They can keep their cash ins, paywalls and lame sports titles.\n\n144\n\nEdu23XWiiU\n\n@antster1983 I know, but EA still had Time Splitters under their belt, also, AKI corporation developed Fight for NY, the best fighting game that ever existed, after the excellent WCW Vs nWo: Revenge.\n\n145\n\nPlayedNSlayed\n\nGive us the original Mass Effect trilogy EA, then you can leave and never come back\n\n146\n\nTheCoolMan350\n\nI would love to see Burnout Paradise Remastered and The Sims 4!\n\n147\n\nZerocritic\n\nI just want madden on the switch\n\n148\n\nGravitron\n\nI like NFL a whole lot but they managed to ruin Madden so I'm good without EA games\n\n149\n\nmichellelynn0976\n\nAfter 2 years you want to take the Switch serious now EA? No EA, take your microtransaction riddled games and sucker casual PS4 fans who will buy anything you make. Nooo thank you.\n\n150\n\neaglebob345\n\nMass Effect Trilogy would be a good start, imo. Dragon Age Trilogy and Dead Space Trilogy would be cool, too. Also, Apex Legends and Titanfall 1+2 would be nice.\n\n151\n\nMjekuMati\n\nWhoever works at EA isn’t aware of what they have that would do well on switch. That seems to be the problem here.\n\nPlants vs Zombies Garden Warfare anybody? Why is this game not on switch? It’s literally the one EA game I would buy! I can’t honestly think of any other games they made that I want. And I’ve wanted that one for like 3 years!\n\n152\n\nHeavyarms55\n\nThe only EA property I would give them any money for would be full port of the Mass Effect Trilogy. No changes. No added \"surprise mechanics\" that is their code for microtransactions and loot boxes.\n\nOn a less critical note, all EA has to do, to have their games sell well on Switch, is to release games on Switch at the same production quality as elsewhere. Stop releasing shoddy, inferior ports missing features. You can scale down the graphics and focus on the game running well, EA is a massive and wealthy company - they easily have the resources they would need for that.\n\n153\n\nHalBailman\n\nOther than the occasional FIFA, I can't recall playing any EA games in the past 20 years. I only want them to stop abusing the Star Wars licence so Switch can some Rogue Squadron games, including the Wii one that never got released. With the Starfighter series, you have a bonefide classics collection there of 7 games, and then add an 8th game that would be all new and cover events from the current series.\n\n154\n\nWexter\n\nThe only two EA games I want right now is NHL20 because I'm one of those weirdos and Dragon Age 4. But, EA based on reports is crushing Bioware's creative spark on the game to make it more like Anthem... and make is a game as service. I miss the days where EA actually took risks to create new IPs and good games rather than just shovelling out games to chase a trend.\n\nSo to be honest I have close to zero interest of buying any new EA games let alone on my Switch.\n\n155\n\ndaveh30\n\nNHL or GTFO, EA.\n\n156\n\n_exalt\n\nThe only thing I'd want from them is the original Star Wars Battlefront 2.\n\n157\n\nNullPointerExcep\n\nEA do has games other than FIFA and The Sims\n\nPersonally I'm a fan of Mirrors' Edge and McGee's Alice\n\nAlso they own Criterion which is my favorite racing game developer (Burnout series + Hot Pursuit 2010)\n\nProbably they've started the micro transaction craze after 2013 when the EA Sports' VP was appointed CEO\n\nI for sure condemn shady business practices from nowadays' but also do dislike people trying to erase their history\n\n158\n\nZebetite\n\nTo quote the office...\n\nNOOOOOO GOD! NO GOD PLEASE NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOO-\n\n159\n\nAnnoyingFrenzy\n\n@Woosh193 NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!\n\n160\n\nSachmoJoe\n\n\"A platform we're looking at for some of our more successful games\" seems like ports of older titles to me. Which suits me fine because I will absolutely play through the Mass Effect trilogy on the Switch if they'll let me. Wouldn't mind some Dragon Age either.\n\n161\n\njoey302\n\nIf they had a bunch of franchises on the Wii then the Switch is nooooo excuse!!\n\n162\n\nIPrino\n\n@JUDAH-LYON yep i would like to see Mass Effect 1-3 and Madden on Switch. I really dont think it is going to happen tho.\n\n163\n\nthaantman\n\nI would love a new need for speed or a remake of an older title. Same with the SSX games.\n\n164\n\nSKTTR\n\nThe last EA games I bought were The Godfather - Blackhand Edition, Dead Space Extraction, and don't laugh, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, 10 years ago on Wii. Those 3 were really good games, even that particular Harry Potter game was surprisingly well done! And they all were complete and polished day one. No updates, no microtransactions.\n\n165\n\nCmuk\n\nPEGGLE! 10/10 game, absolutely perfect for Switch.\n\n166\n\nZimon\n\nNoooo. No more 'surprise mechanics' aimed at kids and people with addictive personalities.\n\nEA should rot off.\n\n167\n\nwestman98\n\nI am genuinely interested in where EA would be without FIFA/FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden/Madden Ultimate Team.\n\n> Bioware is in disarray after Mass Effect Andromeda + Anthem's poor critical & commercial reception (Dragon Age 4 looks to be \"Anthem with Dragons\")\n\n> DICE is in a pickle after Battlefront 2 + Battlefield V's underwhelming critical & commercial performance\n\n> Need for Speed has collapsed critically & commercially, despite 2 reboots in the last 5 years, with titles like Forza and The Crew providing stiff competition\n\n> Visceral games was shuttered because the studio was in disarray and didn't make games filled with lootboxes\n\n> Titanfall 2 sold poorly being an excellent sequel, forcing Respawn to abandon it in favor of Battle Royale (which has fortunately worked in their favor)\n\nBut none of that actually matters too much for EA. What they probably are really concerned about is the increasingly likely possibility that lootboxes in FIFA/Madden Ultimate Team may actually be regulated by the government in the distant future, which would legitimately threaten the company's stock value and perception among shareholders, as Ultimate Team is by far EA's most profitable business.\n\n168\n\nTheDubstepDoge\n\nI really want Madden on the switch.\n\n169\n\nThe-Chosen-one\n\nA bit late to \"look at\"\n\n170\n\nDenDen\n\nF off with your games.\n\nWe dont need them we dont want them\n\nTOXIC\n\n171\n\nmajkti\n\n@TheIronChimp the problem is not EA but NFL & NHL itself, they have a deal with EA for the desired platform (for example NHL is XBOX & PS only, not even in PC) - this is due to player association deals or whatever. They don't even port it to iOS platforms and that is a shame as I love hockey!\n\n172\n\nsanderev\n\nI'm very much anti EA, but it really hurts me to see that people even wouldn't want EA games on the Switch. Any publisher should be allowed to publish on the platform.\n\nYou can always choose not to buy their games.\n\n173\n\nRhaoulos\n\nNice, more games to avoid but this will grow the switch console base so it's definitely a win for existing Switch owners.\n\n174\n\nsandman89\n\nBeetle adventure 2?\n\n175\n\nboneyard\n\nOf course they are looking at the Switch. They are just not sure exactly how to monetize it in the worst possible way yet.\n\n176\n\nSkippy_B_Coyote\n\nI was going to say, \"They should probably just keep them.\" but then I realized that EA published the Dead Space series, and I never got around to playing Dead Space 2 back when I had an Xbox 360. I could go for a Dead Space Trilogy on the Switch. =)\n\n177\n\nKarateLuigi\n\nThe only thing I'd LOVE to have there would be Sims since I adore that franchise but just aren't a PC gamer. I'd happily take Sims 2 or 3 given it's an actual, full-blown port and not whatever loosely based games they've released on Nintendo platforms in the past.\n\n... And given they don't release every single expansion pack as paid DLC or something. But this is becoming a tall order, isn't it.\n\n178\n\nJaxonH\n\nHogwash.\n\nIt's been 3 years, Switch is nearly halfway to catching PS4 for goodness sakes, and they're just \"looking into it\"? Please.\n\nThis is just PR to save face and deflect questions for another 12 months. They've made it perfectly clear they're anti-Nintendo. All the other big publishers are doing more than they are.\n\n179\n\nReigestugatensho\n\n@Moon Garden Warfare is the only EA game I want. Maybe even with Cross-Play Multiplayer.\n\n180\n\nKBuckley27\n\njust give the Switch the Sims and we will be satisfied\n\n181\n\nBlizzia\n\nEh, hope they just keep looking. EA stopped making quality games ages ago, and they're not coming back by the look of things.\n\n182\n\nbrambalk\n\nYESSS! Finally! Can't WAIT to see what those odds of those EA loot boxes are, when Nintendo finally releases them publicly.\n\nI'm not buying the games, though. I hate gambling.\n\n183\n\nFLEEBS\n\nEA is \"absolutely\" a company I do not want to support on Switch.\n\n184\n\nPark_Triolo\n\nI'm absolutely NOT interested in anything from EA!!! Gimme PES, instead!!!\n\n185\n\nrockodoodle\n\nOddly enough, I really loved the second screen for Madden on the Wii U. I would love even a gimped version for the Switch.\n\n186\n\nRyu_Niiyama\n\n@JaxonH It is kinda bad when a direct competitor (MS) supports a system better than a game dev/publisher.\n\n187\n\nMariskis\n\nAbout effing time. We have a snooker game. A semi truck racing game. Cricket. But no Madden? Wtf? I am no longer an online player but the ability to play head 2 head with buddy's on the spot makes all competitive games that much for fun. I've played countless matches on fifa at work with managers walking into the breakroom and cheering us on. We need madden. America needs madden.\n\n188\n\nGrailUK\n\nI sincerely hope EA change their tact with their games. Spewing out the same time / money sinks year after year is rancid (sorry...they call them services don't they). Now, I hate to say it, but the Switch is perfect for these types of game mechanisms. Which is why we may not know it, but I consider us blessed they don't support the platform. I only hope Nintendo want to tether these practices and offer some resistance to EA bringing them to Switch.\n\n189\n\nLoveGiant\n\n@Anti-Matter I guess, Sims 4 is the least beef I have with EA. Although having DLC for DLC seems kinda greedy but alright. Plus the hefty 590$ for the complete game seems like a turn off.\n\nAll the other games have some sort of \"surprise mechanic\", as they like to call it, hidden in their games somewhere. Not surprised they wanna have FIFA Ultimate Team on more devices, that is their highest money maker."
