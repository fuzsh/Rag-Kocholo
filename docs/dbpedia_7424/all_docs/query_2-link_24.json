Building the Future of Games | Over the past decade, games have radically transformed from packaged entertainment to social network-like online services that scale like consumer technology companies. Todayâ€™s games also drive innovation across the entire consumer ecosystem through new methods of engagement, retention, and monetization. We believe that games will play a pivotal role in defining how we socialize, play, and work over the next century.",

        "text": "after many months of cross-country flights, zoom calls, and late night deck revisions... whew... I'm glad to finally be able to share what I've been up to for the past bit: yes, that's right-- A16Z GAMES FUND TWO :) I'm super proud of the team for putting this all together. Huge team effort. This is an all-new, next generation fund that is dedicated to the intersection of TECH x GAMES. It's equally sized to our debut fund that we raised in 2022, and we are excited to invest this new fund across many stages and sectors, from inception to Series A/B. And from AI/infra, web3 games, VR/AR, 3D tooling, gamified apps, game studios, and much more. The fund targets a $300B+ industry that has spawned incredible companies over the past decade, and it's great to be able to build! With this new fund, nothing is too early for us to get involved. We have a new accelerator, SPEEDRUN, where we fund $750k per startup, and plan to invest in several dozen companies each cycle. (In fact, if you have a relevant idea, apply now!) http://sr.a16z.com -- note the May 2024 deadline At later stages, we plan to continue investing in seed, Series A and B, and even later, for startups that have traction or a compelling product built. For Series A/B, the new fund will allow us to work with exceptional teams that have built and launched products, and want to scale their growth. As we've done in the past, we will partner deeply, take board seats, investing tens of millions of dollars, and support companies through their entire journey. This is classic venture capital, and we're excited use these well-worn strategies to build this industry. of course, putting together GAMES FUND TWO was a big collaboration across the firm. We are lucky to be able to work with our wonderful colleagues across American Dynamism, Apps, Infra, and Growth, and within the larger a16z platform to put together this raise. It was a long time in the making, both myself and my fellow Games fund GP Jonathan Lai divided and conquered on behalf of our vertical. Our cofounder Ben Horowitz writes about the broader fundraise here, which I encourage you to read: https://lnkd.in/g-j7JngE And his post: https://lnkd.in/g-iKKT9Z These new a16z funds are being raised just as a new tidal wave has emerged -- generative AI -- that will transform many product categories, but in particular, games and interactive entertainment. This shouldn't be a surprise, as gaming has been the driver of new killer apps for emerging computing platforms. A final note. Thank you to all of the our founders. Thanks to our LPs for supporting us, particularly the new folks who have joined us for Fund 2. Thank you to the amazing team at a16z -- we're so grateful to be part of the broader family. And for me personally, thanks to the entire Games team that we've brought together over the past two years to build this new fund at a16z.\n\nWeâ€™re thrilled to announce A16Z GAMES investment in Kaedim ðŸš€ðŸš€ As costs soar and studios seek solutions, Kaedim's approach stands out. By empowering an internal art team with AI, Kaedim meets studios' high requirements, reduces costs, and generates valuable data in the process. Games have a cost problem. Today, >70% of games are unprofitable and it's getting worse. Since the pandemic, studio costs rose 15%-20% but end consumer game spend increased only 1%. 3D production is a major cost driver. Each AAA game requires 1000s of high-quality 3D art pieces, each of which can take days or weeks to complete. To understand the scale, The Last of Us: Part II had 2,335 people credited for the game, of which only 2% were engineers. Against this backdrop, Generative AI is poised to democratize a complex 3D creation process. However, game studios have stringent requirements around topology, performance, and control that pure AI generation isn't ready to meet... yet. One stringent requirement is topology, which is the constellation of polygons that form a 3d mesh. Studios require their assets to have optimized, flowing topology to ensure performant, artifact-free animation. Today, generative 3D struggles with topology due to architectural limitations. Most models use score-distillation-sampling (SDS) or its derivatives. SDS leverages neural rendering not surface geometry. Extracting clean meshes from NeRFs remains an open research problem. Data limitations also impact generative 3D. Models often rely on 2D priors supplemented with 3D assets. 3D datasets like Objaverse (10M assets) are relatively small, and unfortunately creative efforts like IRL object capture face the NeRF to geometry problem again. While Gen 3D can't meet all studio needs yet, it is a disruptive innovation: >100x faster & cheaper than humans, but with worse topology. As it improves, it will unlock new use cases & grow the pie. A classic case of Christensen's disruption theory. But nothing bridges the gap for today's burning market need, except Kaedim. With a human-in-the-loop, Kaedim generates clean topology. Simultaneously, they are well positioned for Gen 3D's disruption as they are being paid (rather than paying) for a data moat. Kaedim's AI-powered tools turn 3D artists into super-humans. A 3D asset that would otherwise take an artist hours and hundreds of dollars to complete can be done with Kaedim in 20 minutes for $20. Studios who use Kaedim often report 80% speed ups in their production process. This has led to rapid adoption. Kaedim has >250 studio customers and >7 figures in revenue. They are working with the largest AAA studios, film production companies, and e-commerce platforms. We're excited to support Konstantina Psoma and Kaedim on their mission to revolutionize 3D production. Together, we'll empower artists, enable studios, and unlock new possibilities for immersive content! Read more about our investment here: https://lnkd.in/eCkqJfPx cc: Jonathan Lai"
