Say, making 100 games in 5 years? This talk highlights 10 lessons (and a few tricks) gained from exactly that. With some deep-rooted adages that persisted, some that evolved throughout the challenge, and a few fresh ones gleaned at the end, this 100 game tapestry holds plenty of game-making material to draw from.\n\nOver the past 5 years, James Earl Cox III worked towards a goal: make 100 games. As of June 2017, the challenge was complete; a half-decade journey that led around the world, landed him in Forbes 30 Under 30, produced award-winning games, and caused and remedied burnout. All the positive and negative aspects of this experience offer a lot to sort through. Here, we’ll condense 5 years of game-making effort into 10 compact lessons.\n\nInclusivity and diversity create an explosion of creativity and content. Unexpected, stunning, mesmerizing works of imagery can be found in this year's Gaming for Everyone Exhibit. The power of the image to communicate and entrance has long been at the center of human expression, and the power of feedback and procedural response enable games to harness that power in new and stunning ways. Presented by Intel, come experience an exhibit of games that surprise with their look, that use image to reach us in new and unusual ways, and that reinforce how crucial diversity is to art.\n\nGames Included:\n\nCardamom\n\nEli\n\nGhosts of Miami\n\nMind Field\n\nPenny Blue Finds a Clue\n\nSomewhere in the South\n\nFound\n\nProject IOTA\n\nExplore the innovation and artistry of creators across the globe in\n\nthe Nominee Exhibit.

Our games manage to inspire and intrinsically motivate players to learn and practice.\n\nAmong the results are for instance the video game ‘Underground’, a video game on the Nintendo Wii U that trains anyone anywhere in the basic skills for laparoscopy. Or ’Gryphon Rider’, a rehabilitation game for children with acquired brain damage that allows patients to do rehabilitation in a fun and entertaining manner. All of these projects are the perfect marriage between academic insights and commercial application. Capturing movement are at their hearts, whether it be the movement of a surgeon’s arms during surgery or the patients physique during rehabilitation.\n\nI've been making games for 20 years. Going from AAA development to indie development helped me grow and mature my skills in making games. This presentation will discuss how transitioning from a specialist to a generalist attitude was a valuable sequence of events leading to a broader understanding of what we do to make games for our audiences."
