At the right side of it is the word \"GAMES\", also in red text.\n\n2003–2013[]\n\n2003–2007[]\n\nDesigner: Unknown\n\nTypography: Deftone Stylus\n\nLaunched: 2003\n\nIn 2003, the logo was metallicized, its background was changed from yellow to light blue, and the word \"GAMES\" was moved to the circle. The circle in this logo was also used in the 2007 logo from July 2007 to January 12, 2021.\n\n2007–2013[]\n\nDesigner: Mark Simonson\n\nTypography: Deftone Stylus (modified)\n\nLaunched: July 2007\n\nIn July 2007, the longest-lived logo of the company was introduced where the \"PopCap\" wordmark or text was modified. The cursive line of an \"O\" connecting to the second \"P\" is between them instead of within the \"O\", above portion of the first \"P\" is straight, letters are now rounded and the word \"GAMES\" was removed from the logo, leaving the \"PopCap\" text behind. From July 2007 to January 2016, it used a metallicized round circle with a light blue background from the 2003–2007 logo. Like with the previous logos, this logo is used on its games and is notably used on Plants vs. Zombies franchise since its start or inception on April 1, 2009 upon the release of \"Zombies on Your Lawn\" music video on YouTube.\n\n2011–present[]\n\nDesigner: Unknown\n\nTypography: Deftone Stylus (modified)\n\nLaunched: April 2011\n\nIn April 2011, the logo became horizontal and the circle was permanently removed. It was concurrently used with the 2007 logo until June 2013.\n\n[]\n\nOfficial website\n\nV • T • E\n\nPopCap Games\n\nPart of Electronic Arts\n\nAmazing Adventures:\n\nAmazing Adventures: Around the World | Amazing Adventures: The Caribbean Secret | Amazing Adventures: The Forgotten Dynasty | Amazing Adventures: The Forgotten Ruins | Amazing Adventures: The Lost Tomb | Amazing Adventures: Riddle of the Two Knights\n\nV • T • E\n\nA Electronic Arts and PopCap Games franchise\n\nMain Series: Bejeweled (Mobile) | Bejeweled 2 | Bejeweled 3 (Classic · LIVE)\n\nSpin-off Series: Bejeweled Twist | Bejeweled Blitz (LIVE) | Bejeweled 3D | Bejeweled Legend | Bejeweled Stars | Bejeweled Champions\n\nUpcoming: Bejeweled 4\n\nBookworm:\n\nBookworm | Bookworm Adventures | Bookworm Adventures: Volume 2 | Bookworm Mobile\n\nChuzzle:\n\nChuzzle | Chuzzle Mobile\n\nEscape:\n\nEscape the Emerald Star | Escape Rosecliff Island | Escape Whisper Valley\n\nFeeding Frenzy:\n\nFeeding Frenzy | Feeding Frenzy 2 | Feeding Frenzy 2: Shipwreck Showdown\n\nMahjong Escape:\n\nMahjong Escape: Ancient China | Mahjong Escape: Ancient Japan\n\nMystery P.I.:\n\nMystery P.I.: The Curious Case of Counterfeit Cove | Mystery P.I.: The London Caper | Mystery P.I.: Lost in Los Angeles | Mystery P.I.: The Lottery Ticket | Mystery P.I.: The New York Fortune | Mystery P.I.: Portrait of a Thief | Mystery P.I.: Stolen in San Francisco | Mystery P.I.: The Vegas Heist\n\nPeggle:\n\nPeggle | Peggle Mobile | Peggle Nights | Peggle 2 | Peggle Blast\n\nPlants vs. Zombies:\n\nPlants vs. Zombies | Plants vs. Zombies HD | Plants vs. Zombies Adventures | Plants vs. Zombies 2 | Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare | Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 | Plants vs. Zombies Heroes | Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville | Plants vs. Zombies 3\n\nNon PopCap: Plants vs. Zombies Match\n\nVacation Quest:\n\nVacation Quest: Australia | Vacation Quest: The Hawaiian Islands\n\nZuma:\n\nZuma | Zuma Mobile | Zuma's Revenge! | Zuma Blitz\n\nOther:\n\nAlchemy | Allied Star Police | AstroPop | Atomica | Banana Bugs | Big Money! | Bonnie's Bookstore | Candy Train | Cosmic Bugs | Dynomite! | Gyromancer | Hammer Heads | Heavy Weapon | Hidden Identity: Chicago Blackout | Iggle Pop! | Insaniquarium | Lucky Gem Casino | Mars Needs Cows | Mystery Solitaire | Mummy Maze | NingPo MahJong | Noah's Ark | Pixelus | Pizza Frenzy | Rocket Mania! | Seven Seas | Solitaire Blitz | Talismania | TipTop | Typer Shark! | Unpleasant Horse | Venice | Water Bugs | Wizard's Pen | Word Harmony"
