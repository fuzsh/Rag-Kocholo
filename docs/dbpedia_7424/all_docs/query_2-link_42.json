        "text": "A proven design. A game-changing transformation.\n\nFor over 70 years, Richards has remained dedicated to manufacturing high-quality, innovative products for electrical distribution systems. The Cold Shrink Hammerhead epitomizes this legacy by introducing a truly unique, robust solution for terminating and splicing medium voltage power cable. We’ve taken our industry-leading 600/900A Deadbreak Elbow design and given it a cutting-edge transformation.\n\nAll-In-One Solution: The CSH is range-taking and includes an integral jacket seal, providing a complete solution in a simple package. Three separate components have been elegantly combined into a single design.\n\n100% EPDM: Richards Cold Shrink Products are molded from 100% EPDM, a proven material in underground electrical applications for decades. This proprietary formulation of Cold Shrink EPDM is produced in-house. To achieve maximum durability in underground environments, the CSH features a fully-integrated, oil-resistant EPDM jacket that provides outstanding mechanical impact/tear resistance.\n\nEasy Installation: We’ve optimized our design to minimize installation time, complexity, and overall cost. No more cable adapter and no more separate jacket seal kit. The cold shrink Cable Entrance eliminates problems that arise when sliding traditional interference-fit Deadbreak elbows into position. This ergonomic improvement substantially simplifies positioning/aligning the lug in the CSH housing.\n\nDesigned, Molded & Tested in the USA: Our team is intimately involved in everything from material development, product and mold design, and production. This allows us to control every aspect of the design, down to the smallest detail."
