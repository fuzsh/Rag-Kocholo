        "text": "After discussing the maps of the two Garden Warfare games I ruminated over that discussion and then after playing the first game in addition to GW2 recently I wanted to run down my opinion on the maps here so others could see them all here together and get the community’s thoughts. I do this kind of thing mostly to get the community involved in the franchise’s future and so the devs can see what people like and dislike and want to see in the next game.\n\nFirst I’ll list them out, separated by game:\n\nGW1 Maps:\n\nWall-Nut Hills\n\nMain Street\n\nCactus Canyon\n\nDriftwood Shores\n\nZomboss Estate\n\nGarden Center\n\nSuburban Flats\n\nJewel Junction\n\nSharkbite Shores\n\nCrash Course\n\nPort Scallywag\n\nChomp Town\n\nGW2 maps:\n\nGreat White North\n\nSeeds of Time\n\nZomburbia\n\nZombopolis\n\nMoonbase Z\n\nZ-Tech Factory\n\nLunar Landing\n\nTime Park\n\nFrontline Flats\n\nFrosty Creek\n\nColizeum\n\nSandy Sands\n\nAqua Center\n\nZen Peak\n\nBoney Island\n\nI put the TT maps first in both lists; followed by the smaller general use maps and I didn’t count the night versions separately. The first thing I noticed was that GW1 has 12 maps and GW2 has 15. Now like many people I think the overall average of how much I the maps is a bit higher in GW1 but I personally don’t dislike any maps, the closest is Time Park in multiplayer matches due to its nature with the cool but choke point inspiring portals and even then I don’t actually dislike it, just find it less than ideal for most matches there although fine for Ops.\n\nI think part of the issue some have based on the FB group and posters here have with the new vs. the old maps is that the themes of many of the new ones don’t fit in as well. Most of the maps in GW1 felt like suburbs and urban areas, places zombies would appear at and attack due to the population density, whereas in GW2 we fight over several different maps that are part of a theme park, zombie controlled cityscapes, a frozen logging camp, and the moon. The first game had a couple of outliers like Port Scallywag and Sharkbite shores but they weren’t that far off the main theme and were the minority. The maps felt connected without being directly so like Seeds of Time is with Time Park, Colizeum, Sandy Sands, Zen Peak, and Boney Island. So many areas that felt like they were part of the theme park and the general ambivalence and downright dislike of the theme park areas have certainly been seen among the players.\n\nFor myself I don’t mind the theme park areas at all and some are quite good tactically. The main issue is the 2 G&G maps in GW2 just don’t have the same feel as the original 4 G&G maps and the 3 herbal assault maps just seem to play better (once some adjusted were made) than the new G&G maps. While the ruining of the graduation party at Zomburbia lacks the threat of the tactical cuke in Main Street from GW1, it played well and I love that map. Zombopolis is a visual delight and Moonbase Z’s end game is one of my favorites to date and both Zombopolis and Moonbase Z have an existential threat to the plants so much better incentive than the zombies taking Rose’s castle.\n\nThat being said I don’t want to see the creativity in this series getting hit by a ‘reality hammer’ as I think the complaints that GW2 is ‘too silly’ compared to GW1 seem odd when even in the first game we were stealing tacos and absconding with them into a UFO (I still love Taco Bandits to this day), pushing a giant golf ball into a secret lab under a minigolf course, and sneaking zombies into Dave’s house. PvZ has always been lighthearted and fun and we don’t want to lose that. With the idea of time travel from the gnomes and PvZ2 which I play consistently on my phone, we can have a mix of suburbia and zomburbia in the maps for the new game. The last map added to GW2; Frontline Flats is one of the best from either game and it really reminds me of GW1 while fitting the ascendant zombie theme of GW2 well.\n\nSo while I personally want to see all the old maps make a return in GW3 or whatever the new PvZ shoter turns out to be (throw us a bone here Popcap!), and they can use the gnomiverse or other time travel aspects from games like PvZ2 to justify them all, what do you guys here all think about the maps? Got any favorites or ones you really dislike? Do you miss the old haunts like Port Scallywag and Main Street? Or are you set on Moonbase Z and Frosty Creek?\n\nWhile it’s obvious that Popcap already have a great map team, I came up with a couple I wanted to share with the community and mayhap spark some creative discussion among the devs if they catch this thread.\n\nThe Great Brain Robbery: This name is from an old game by a company whose name I won’t post but it fits this game so well. Thanks to PvZ2 and the Gnomiverse the idea of time travel in PvZ has become standard fare so why not a Wild West train map?\n\nThis would be an Herbal Assault map. The plants have to fight through a zombie perimeter, train station, and then a train yard to board a large moving train packed with brains the zombies are taking to Zomboss. The train(s) would be large to avoid the map being too restricted but you fight up the caboose to the diner car and finally battle over the engine and coal car where the zombies have to shovel coal to get to the objective while the plants have to stop this before time runs out.\n\nAlternatively the train could be driven by the plants who are trying to get the brains away from the zombies while the zombies are trying hard to get those brains, making it a Gardens and Graveyards map instead of Herbal Assault but the basic mechanics would be the same.\n\n20,000 Leaves under the sea: (play on leagues under the sea :D ): This map is under water so you will see fish, whales, coral, mollusks, and possibly other sea life as the plants have to fight their way inside the zombie base where Zomboss plans to release a dangerous defoliant into the world’s water supply (very bad for plants!). The plants would arrive via submarine and the battle would start in the open water near the base and then fight inside various parts of the base before they reach the defoliant pumping station.\n\nThe underwater points would involve slower than normal movement thanks to being underwater which adds a new dynamic and requires players to plan for this. All abilities should still work but would also be affected by being submerged and it would have a heavy 3d element to the fight.\n\nAt that final point the plants have to replace the various defoliant tanks with fertilizer tanks. This would be similar to planting the Z4 at the tactical cuke at the end of Main Street in GW1 but could be tweaked to maintain the flavor while being a bit different.\n\nAt the outside of the base the sea life may interfere with the battle; I’m thinking 2 or 3 points outside the base before the remaining points are inside by attacking or otherwise involving themselves in the battle. As a semi-random event a large whale or shark could damage the base at a point, flooding it so the underwater effect returns.\n\nHope people like these 2 ideas! I’ll post any others that pop into my head! :D"
