They tend to be the more agile of the Carcharions and often take home in vast expanses of coral. Player character Hammerhead Carcharion have the features detailed opposite in addition to the ones they get from being Carcharion.\n\nHammerhead Carcharions around the Azure Sea\n\nUsed as advanced scouts by Carcharion hunting parties due to their excellent all-round vision and perception skills, Hammerhead Carcharion tend to be more widely accepted in other cultures (though still rare in land-based cultures), perhaps because of their slightly humorous appearance. They should not be underestimated however, as they are quick and agile.\n\nHammerhead Carcharion by Video1313\n\nHammerhead Carcharion\n\nAbility Score Increase +1 Dex\n\nSize Medium\n\nSpeed 25 ft., swim 35 ft.\n\nHeadbutt.
