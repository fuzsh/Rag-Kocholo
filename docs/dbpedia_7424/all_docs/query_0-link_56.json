Embracing this as my full-time profession in 2015 gave me the freedom to experiment with educational philosophies beyond traditional boundaries.Many people misunderstand our structure. It's not a class, meetup, or simulated job. Instead, participants collaborate on remote teams making freeware games, meeting with me periodically for personalized lessons tailored around the projects and tasks they choose. My training specializations are in gameplay programming, small team production (planning, scheduling, coordinating), and general gameplay design, although members can also schedule help sessions with our specialists in other domains (audio, 2D and 3D art, UI, UX, level design).Here are some excerpts that have influenced my unconventional training format:\n\nWhy instead of giving lectures I have students choose their projects and tasks, then meet with them up to every week or two\"In the newer universities in England and America there is a regrettable tendency to insist upon attendance at innumerable lectures... When I was an undergraduate, my feeling, and that of most of my friends, was that lectures were a pure waste of time. No doubt we exaggerated, but not much. The real reason for lectures is that they are obvious work, and therefore businessmen are willing to pay for them. If university teachers adopted the best methods, businessmen would think them idle, and insist upon cutting down the staff. He should see the pupils individually when they have done their papers. About once a week or once a fortnight, he should see such as care to come in the evening, and have desultory conversation about matters more or less connected with their work. All this is not very different from the practice at the older universities. If a pupil chooses to set himself a paper, different from that of the teacher but equally difficult, he shall be at liberty to do so.\"-Bertrand Russell\n\nEducation and the Good LifeWhy instead of exercises or quizzes I emphasize solving problems in the context of real team projects\"In a word, learning is decontextualized. We break ideas down into tiny pieces that bear no relation to the whole. We give students a brick of information, followed by another brick, followed by another brick, until they are graduated, at which point we assume they have a house. What they have is a pile of bricks, and they don't have it for longâ¦ More and more teachers are coming to recognize that excellence is most likely to result from well functioning teams, in which resources are shared, skills and knowledge are exchanged, and each participant is encouraged and helped to do their best.\"-Alfie Kohn\n\nTwo parts from Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, Praise and Other BribesWhy my approach to education focuses on peer community and hands-on practical learning\"...Expense of getting an education would in a great measure vanish... Those conveniences which the student requires at Cambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great a sacrifice of life... Those things for which the most money is demanded are never the things which the student most wants. Tuition, for instance, is an important item in the term bill, while for the far more valuable education which he gets by associating with the most cultivated of his contemporaries no charge is made...\"\"...Says one, 'you do not mean that the students should go to work with their hands instead of their heads?' I do not mean that exactly, but I mean something which he might think a good deal like that... Which would have advanced the most at the end of a month--the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for this--or the boy who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the meanwhile, and had received a Rodgers' penknife from his father? Which would be most likely to cut his fingers?\"-Henry David Thoreau\n\nWaldenWhy I structure training as sustainable weekly practice, rather than packing it into a shorter, high intensity full-time class\"Learning is deeper and more durable when itâs effortful... Periodic practice arrests forgetting, strengthens retrieval routes, and is essential for hanging onto the knowledge you want to gain. When you space out practice at a task and get a little rusty between sessions, or you interleave the practice of two or more subjects, retrieval is harder and feels less productive, but the effort produces longer lasting learning and enables more versatile application of it in later settings.\"-Henry L. Roediger III and Mark A. McDaniel\n\nCognitive scientists, from Make It Stick, written with Peter BrownWhy I do not offer grading or contests, instead encouraging students to pursue what most interests and challenges them\"To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards or punishments. To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. She has to develop the ability to find enjoyment and purpose regardless of external circumstancesâ¦ The best moments usually occur when a personâs body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhileâ¦ When we act freely, for the sake of the action rather than for ulterior motives, we learn to become more than what we were.\"-Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n\nFlow: The Psychology of Optimal ExperienceWhy I use computer game development to teach people about programming, creativity, planning, teamwork, group speaking, etc.\"Not amusement nor distraction, but the desire to effect some cherished purpose is the strongest motive that can move the learner.\"-John William Adamson\n\nIn his introduction for The Educational Writings of John Locke\n\nI see the purpose of my work as to use the skills, experience and connections I gained to help others who haven't had the head start and opportunities I did, especially people who found existing options (ex. jams, university, static online resources) didn't fit their needs well.I work on continually improving how well my business helps people in the following ways:"
