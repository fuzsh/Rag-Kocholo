        "text": "Plants vs. Zombies The first entry to the series First released on May 5, 2009\n\nPlants vs. Zombies (abbreviated as PvZ) is a tower defense video game developed and originally published by PopCap Games and it is the first installment in the Plants vs. Zombies series. The game involves homeowners who use a variety of different plants to prevent waves of zombies from entering their houses and \"eating their brains\".\n\nIt was first going to release on October 28, 2008, back when it was titled Bloom & Doom, but as an early version, and it got delayed. It was first released on May 5, 2009, and it originally (and initially) was made available on Steam for Microsoft Windows and macOS. An iPhone version for iOS was released on February 15, 2010, and an HD version for the iPad was released on March 31, 2010. Furthermore, both the original Windows and Mac version of the game have been re-released with additional content in the Game of the Year Edition on July 11, 2010. An extended Xbox Live Arcade version introducing new gameplay modes and features was released on September 8, 2010. PopCap released a Nintendo DS version on January 18, 2011 with content unique to the platform. The PlayStation 3 version was released in February 8, 2011 also with added new co-op and versus modes found in the Xbox 360 version. An Android version of the game was released on May 31, 2011 on the Amazon Appstore, while it was also released to the Android Market (now Google Play) on December 14, 2011. On February 16, 2012, a version was released for BlackBerry PlayBook. Later, a BlackBerry smartphone version of the game was released on January 2013 following the launch of BlackBerry 10. In November 13, 2014, a free ad-supported version of the game was released for iOS and Android.\n\nThe game received a positive response from critics and was nominated for multiple Interactive Achievement Awards, alongside receiving praise for its musical score. The game is followed by a sequel, Plants vs. Zombies 2, which was released on July 9, 2013, in Australia and New Zealand, then it was released worldwide on August 15, 2013.\n\nGame icons\n\nPC icon\n\n1st iPhone/iPod Touch icon\n\n2nd iPhone/iPod Touch icon\n\n3rd iPhone/iPod Touch icon\n\n4th iPhone/iPod Touch icon\n\n1st iPad icon\n\n2nd iPad icon\n\n3rd iPad icon\n\nAndroid icon\n\n1st Plants vs. Zombies FREE icon\n\n2nd Plants vs. Zombies FREE icon (note the PvZ2 appearance)\n\n3rd Plants vs. Zombies FREE icon\n\n4th Plants vs Zombies FREE icon\n\nDescription of the Game\n\nAn all-new action-strategy game from PopCap, makers of Bejeweled and Peggle!\n\nZombies are invading your home, and the only defense is your arsenal of plants!

A mob of fun-loving zombies is about to invade your home, and your only defense is an arsenal of 49 zombie-zapping plants. Use peashooters, wall-nuts, cherry bombs and more to mulchify 26 types of zombies before they can reach your front door. Each zombie has its own special skills, so you’ll need to think fast and plant faster to combat them all. But be careful how you use your limited supply of greens and seeds… as you battle the fun-dead, obstacles like a setting sun, creeping fog and a swimming pool add to the challenge. And with five game modes to dig into, the fun never dies!\n\nPlay five game modes: Adventure, Mini-Games, Puzzle, Survival, plus the stress-free Zen Garden\n\nConquer all 50 levels of Adventure mode — through day, night, and fog, in a swimming pool and on the rooftop\n\nBattle 26 types of zombies including pole-vaulters, snorkelers and “Zomboni” drivers\n\nEarn 49 powerful perennials and collect coins to buy a pet snail, power-ups and more!\n\nOpen the Almanac to see all the plants and zombies, plus amusing “facts” and quotes\n\nBrowse Crazy Dave’s shop for special plants and tools to stem any zombie assault\n\nAmazing graphics and soundtrack, plus a bonus music video\n\nInfinite replayability: the game is never the same experience twice!\n\nGameplay\n\nIn Plants vs. Zombies, players place different types of plants and fungi, each with their own unique offensive or defensive capabilities, around a house, in order to stop a horde of zombies from reaching their house. The playing field is divided into 5 to 6 horizontal lanes, and with rare exceptions, a zombie will only move towards the player's house along one lane (the main exception is if it has bitten a garlic, causing it to move to another lane). Planting costs \"sun\", which can be gathered for free (a bit slowly) during daytime levels and by planting certain plants or fungi. Most plants can only attack or defend against zombies in the lane they are planted in. In later levels, players can purchase upgrades with different offensive and defensive abilities.\n\nThe game uses several different level types and layouts. The game starts out in a front yard and progresses to nighttime levels, where the gameplay is more challenging without any replenishing sun unless specific plants are used. Other levels feature the backyard, with a pool added. The next levels are nighttime pool levels (where fog fills the right half of the screen except when specific plants are used), a lightning storm level in pitch black (except when illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning), and rooftop levels (on the final level, the player must face a huge robot operated by a mad scientist zombie known as Dr. Zomboss). At set points throughout the game, the player is either warned through a letter by zombies or addressed by Crazy Dave to prepare for an ambush, where the game takes on a bowling style, using Wall-nuts to bowl down zombies, or a modified version of regular levels, where random plant types come upon a small selection, and the player can use the plants without spending sun.\n\nThe player starts with a limited number of seed pack types and seed pack slots that they can use during most levels. The number of slots can be increased through purchases with in-game money. At the start of a level, the player is shown the various types of zombies to expect and given the opportunity to select which seed packs to take into the level. Several plants are nocturnal, such as mushrooms, having a lower sunlight cost, and are ideal for nighttime levels. Certain plants are highly effective against specific types of zombies, such as the Magnet-shroom, which can remove metallic items from a zombie, such as helmets, buckets, ladders, and pogo sticks.\n\nThe zombies also come in a number of types that have different attributes, in particular, speed, damage tolerance, and abilities. Zombies include those wearing makeshift armor, those who can jump or fly over plants, and a dancing zombie able to summon other zombies from the ground. At various points, the player will be inundated with a huge wave of zombies.\n\nIf a zombie reaches the end of a lane, a lawnmower will shoot forward and destroy all the zombies in that lane. However, if a zombie reaches the end of that same lane for a second time, it will reach the player's house. When this happens, the music changes and the other plants and zombies stop moving while that zombie enters the house. Crunching sounds will be heard, accompanied by a scream and a message saying \"The zombies ate your brains!\" The game will then end and display the Game Over dialog box along with an option to return to the main menu at the upper-right side of the screen.\n\nGame modes\n\nMain article: Game modes (PvZ)\n\nThe primary game mode is Adventure Mode in which the player can earn money to spend at an in-game store to buy new seed packets and other bonuses. There are also Mini games and puzzles. In the Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Nintendo DS versions, there is also a co-op mode, as well as 2 player Mini games and a Versus mode (but not in the Nintendo DS version).\n\nAdventure mode\n\nMain article: Adventure Mode\n\nThe adventure mode consists of 6 different areas and 50 different area levels (each area contains 10 levels, except Roof where nine of the levels are set in daytime (5-1 to 5-9) while Level 5-10 is Night Roof). They are shown with the area number first, followed by the level number (i.e 1-10) in the game. Each level in this mode has a certain amount of flags and one final wave. The adventure mode is the first game mode and is also the main mode. Mini games are unlocked from here.\n\nMini games\n\nMain article: Mini-games\n\nMini games are unlocked during the adventure mode and are mostly for fun. Some of the minigames are inspired by earlier PopCap games.\n\nPuzzles\n\nMain article: Puzzle Mode\n\nPuzzles consist of 18 levels from 2 different \"modes\", Vasebreaker, where you break vases that either contains a plant seed or a zombie or some sun for cherry bombs, and I, Zombie, where you create zombies to destroy cardboard cutouts of plants.\n\nSurvival\n\nMain article: Survival Mode\n\nSurvival Mode is the second largest game mode in Plants vs. Zombies. It involves two difficulties as hard and normal and also has different areas. Each normal round has 5 flags and each hard round has 10 flags. It also has an endless streak level as the final level. Survival is the last game mode in the game itself.\n\nThere is also a page of canceled mini-games called the Limbo Page which can be accessed using Cheat Engine.\n\nZen Garden\n\nMain article: Zen Garden (PvZ)\n\nThe game also features a Zen Garden, where players can care for plants they previously purchased from Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies. Players can also buy other Zen Garden areas for different plants. Fertilizer, water, and bug spray are necessary for a plant to grow. Plants will only grow when the game has been running for enough time.\n\nDevelopment\n\nConcept\n\nPlants vs. Zombies director George Fan intended on balancing the game between a \"gritty\" game and a \"sickeningly cute\" game. Strong strategic elements were included to appeal to more experienced gamers, while keeping it simple to appeal to casual gamers, without many tutorials. He was inspired to make it a tower defense game after thinking both of a more defense-oriented version of a previous title of his, Insaniquarium, and playing some Warcraft III tower defense mods. While he was looking at the towers in Warcraft III, he felt that plants would make good towers. He wanted to bring something new to the genre with Plants vs. Zombies, and he found common tower defense gameplay elements such as mazing and juggling to be too awkward, causing him to use the five- and six-lane set-ups that were used in the final version. The game was initially going to be called Weedlings, but as the tower defense concept took off and the personality of the game as a whole evolved, the title was later changed.\n\nGeorge Fan included elements from the trading card game, Magic: The Gathering, which he had played with his girlfriend Laura Shigihara. Showing her how to customize their card decks inspired him to design Plants vs. Zombies with seed packets rather than his original idea of using a conveyor belt that produced randomly selected plants, due to the greater complexity of the seed packet method. Another influence on Plants vs. Zombies besides Warcraft III and Insaniquarium was Tapper, crediting the use of five lanes to this game. Various members of PopCap Games contributed to the development of Plants vs. Zombies through an internal forum where they gave feedback.\n\nSome of the characteristics that defined Insaniquarium influenced the development of Plants vs. Zombies. Players advance in a similar pace by receiving new plants. Also, the way plants are chosen at the beginning of each level was derived from the way pets are chosen in Insaniquarium. Other inspiration for the game's mechanics came from the film Swiss Family Robinson, especially where the family defends against pirates. This was the inspiration for the Potato Mine; Fan stated that it was satisfying to watch a zombie step on the mine, being defeated and covered in mashed potatoes.\n\nDesign\n\nThe team wanted to bring back the aliens from Insaniquarium, but in the end, they were changed to zombies, which players could react to more easily because of how slowly they moved. Fan's favorite zombie was the Pole Vaulting Zombie, due to the hilarity involved when a player encounters it for the first time, using a specific example where a player tries to block it with the Wall-nut, only to have the zombie jump over it.\n\nDuring development, it was discovered that newcomers to the genre of real-time strategy may have a hard time learning the concept behind sun collection. So, the price of the income generating Sunflowers was dropped from 100 to 50 to encourage players to buy them over the attacking Peashooter. As a result, the balance between plants and zombies had to be restructured—a move that Fan said was definitely worth the effort. Programmers focused on Adventure mode for much of the first year of development. Upon finishing some items ahead of schedule, one of the programmers, Tod Semple, began working on ideas that would later be used for the minigame section. Some ideas for the puzzle mode section would later be tweaked and moved into adventure mode; \"Vasebreaker\" and \"I, Zombie\", for example, came from single-level minigame concepts. During testing, Fan found that minigame and puzzle modes seemed to detract from the focus on Adventure mode, so some of the additional modes and minigames were locked requiring advancement within adventure mode to become unlocked.\n\nGeorge Fan stated that every game he worked on had only him designing the prototype, adding that he used to draw a lot before he made games, where he made pixel art. The final designs of the zombies and the first plants are similar to how they were initially. After searching for an artist, they discovered Rich Werner, who Fan thought clicked with what he intended for the design. He attributed the intrigue of the design to its animation scheme; Tod Semple suggested that they animate it in Flash and export it into the game. Fan worried that this would look like it was cut out from paper, and would resemble South Park too much, but was satisfied in the end, attributing this to Semple and Werner's talents.\n\nGeorge Fan was most proud of the Tall-nut, Torchwood, and Cob Cannon plants. He explained that the Tall-nut has character, citing its \"determined gaze\" and how it sheds a single tear when hurt. Laura Shigihara could not stand to see this and protected it with a protective plant called a Pumpkin, which can protect plants inside it. He felt that the Torchwood – which gives Peashooters flaming ammunition – required players to think of how plants interacted with each other. Another favorite plant of Fan's was the Squash, due to how its name suggested its purpose; to squash things. A plant was proposed that is similar to the defensive item Umbrella Leaf, which would be planted above other plants to protect them from bungee zombies and catapult zombies. However, it was difficult to visualize their positions.\n\nCultural references\n\nPlants vs. Zombies uses many cultural references in its names of stages and others. The gravestones' inscriptions (\"Expired\", \"Ceased to Exist\", \"Just Resting\", etc.) were taken from Monty Python's Dead Parrot Sketch. Four of the mini-games—\"Zombiquarium\", \"Beghouled\", \"Beghouled Twist\", and \"Whack a Zombie\"—are a reference from four other PopCap games: Insaniquarium, Bejeweled, Bejeweled Twist, and Hammer Heads Deluxe respectively. Two levels in \"Vasebreaker\" puzzles, \"Scary Potter\" and \"Ace of Vase\", take their names from Harry Potter and Ace of Base. Similarly, the \"I, Zombie\" (a reference to Isaac Asimov's I, Robot) puzzles have levels called \"Dead Zeppelin\" (resembling Led Zeppelin) and \"All your brainz r belong to us\" (a play on the gaming meme \"All your base are belong to us\"). The name of the Torchwood plant is a reference to Doctor Who and its spin-off show Torchwood. Originally, the dancing zombie resembled Michael Jackson from the short film Thriller. Though the Jackson-inspired zombie was present in the game before Jackson's death, the estate of Michael Jackson objected to its inclusion more than a year after his death; PopCap agreed to remove the Jackson-inspired zombie and replaced it with a more generic disco-dancing one for all future patches and releases of the game. A \"disclaimer\" in the game's almanac states \"Any resemblance between Dancing Zombie and any persons living or dead is purely coincidental.\" Some Plants vs. Zombies advertisements parody controversial Evony ads, showing a drooling zombie instead of a voluptuous woman.\n\nA planned name was Lawn of the Dead, a pun on the title of the George A. Romero zombie film Dawn of the Dead. The development team created a video that was sent to Romero to ask permission to use the name, but Romero would not give it. It was then that the development team came up with the name Plants vs. Zombies. It spent three years in development and was released for the PC on May 5, 2009. Since it was released, it has been announced for multiple platforms, including PlayStation 3's PlayStation Network, Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade digital distribution service, Nintendo DS, Android, and iOS.\n\nPlants vs. Zombies itself was referenced in \"The Passing\" campaign of Valve's fellow zombie game Left 4 Dead 2, in which the player can stumble upon in-game graffiti attributed to the character of Crazy Dave. A five-level quest chain culminating in a quest entitled \"Lawn of the Dead\" in the massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is based on Plants vs. Zombies, using Warcraft elements to recreate the gameplay. Blizzard Entertainment had contacted PopCap about the inclusion, and Laura Shigihara was able to record some new music for the Warcraft version of the game.\n\nCharacters\n\nWe need more gems and sprouts.\n\nThis section is currently under construction. You can help expand it; it's your choice.\n\nCrazy Dave\n\nMain article: Crazy Dave\n\nDavid Blazing, known within the game as \"Crazy Dave\", serves as a narrator and an instructor during Adventure Mode, introducing the player to certain levels and explaining some of the mini-games and bonus levels. He is later abducted by a Bungee Zombie on level 5–10 right before he can tell the player Dr. Zomboss' weaknesses, and reappears during Sunflower's rendition of \"Zombies on your Lawn\" after Dr. Zomboss's defeat at the end of the game. He has a shop known as \"Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies\" that he runs from the back of his car once the player finds his car keys after Level 3–4. He sells several plant upgrades, extra defenses, and Zen Garden items. Crazy Dave's notable features include a rugged beard and a pot always worn on his head, as well as his signature babbling speech.\n\nDr. Zomboss\n\nMain article: Dr. Zomboss\n\nDr. Edgar George Zomboss is the main antagonist and the leader of the zombies in Plants vs. Zombies, and reappears in the sequel, Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time. He is battled on the Night Roof during Level 5–10 as the final boss in Plants vs. Zombies. The name \"Zomboss\" is a portmanteau of the words \"Zombie\" and \"Boss\", meaning \"Zombie Boss\", while the Zombot, the machine used by Dr. Zomboss in the game, is the portmanteau of the words \"Zombie\" and \"Robot\", meaning \"Zombie Robot\". According to an interview with George Fan, Dr. Zomboss' middle name \"George\" was not intended to be named after him, and was only accepted since \"it sounded like a great middle name for a zombie overlord boss character.\"\n\nSoundtrack\n\nMain article: Plants vs. Zombies Original Soundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack for Plants vs. Zombies was composed by Laura Shigihara. It borrows elements from the pop music genre, as well as console chiptunes. Before the inception of Plants vs. Zombies, Director George Fan asked Laura if she would like to compose the music for his next title after following her for some years. She accepted, owing to his creativity. Shigihara described the music as \"macabre, yet goofy\". Using the night stage as an example, she used a combination of \"Big Band\" and swing beats with \"several haunting and serious melodies\". The songs \"Loonboon\" and \"Brainiac Maniac\" were written towards the end of production. The song \"Ultimate Battle\" also appears in the game Melolune. She stated that these were reactionary songs that she wrote to fit the feel of the game after having played through it twice. She tried to make the game have a Danny Elfman feel to it while mixing in melodic tunes and funky beats. She describes a song early in the game, which uses marching band percussion and swing beats. She described another one which used techno beats with organic sounds. Shigihara also composed and performed the music video shown during the credits of the game, titled \"Zombies on Your Lawn\".\n\nReception\n\nWe need more gems and sprouts.\n\nThis section is currently under construction. You can help expand it; it's your choice.\n\nPlants vs. Zombies has received a positive reception from critics, garnering an aggregate score of 87/100 from Metacritic and an 88% from GameRankings.\n\nIGN editor Andy J Kolozsy commented that it featured a lot more content than other games in the genre, as well as praising its addictive nature. However, the DS version was criticized for its lower quality graphics and expensive price point. GameSpot editor Chris Watters praised the design of the plants and zombies, as well as the visuals and its overall value. However, he found fault in the learning curve. 1UP.com editor Alice Liang found the game enjoyable, commenting that the lawnmowers that protect the left side of the screen strikes a good balance between ease-of-use and in-depth gameplay. Edge's review praised PopCap Games for adding an imaginative touch to every little detail of the game. He also credited them for taking the tower defense genre and making it their own.\n\nLaura Shigihara's music video also received praise, with Hatfield attributing his interest in the game to the video. Liang also praised the song, asking how anyone could not want Plants vs. Zombies after seeing the video.\n\nTo date, Plants vs. Zombies is the fastest-selling video game created by PopCap Games. Plants vs. Zombies director George Fan estimated that half of the game's sales are from hardcore gamers. According to PopCap, the iOS release of Plants vs. Zombies sold more than 300,000 copies in the first nine days it was available on the App Store, generating more than $1M in gross sales, and considered it \"the top-grossing iPhone launch\".\n\nAwards\n\nPlants vs. Zombies has been nominated for the \"Casual Game of the Year\" and \"Outstanding Achievement in Game Design\" Interactive Achievement Awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. The game received nominations in \"Best Game Design\", \"Innovation\", and \"Best Download Game\" for the Game Developers Choice Awards. Plants vs Zombies was picked by Gamezebo as one of the 'Best games of 2009'.\n\nLegacy\n\nA version of the game was added in patch 4.0.3a of World of Warcraft which used similar mechanics as an homage to the popularity of the game. A reward of a non-combat pet singing sunflower is given to those who can beat the minigame. The success of the game has led to the creation of Plants vs. Zombies lottery tickets. Since the game was partially inspired by the Magic: The Gathering card game, a Magic card called Grave Bramble has been released in the Innistrad expansion. It is a Plant with the Protection from Zombies ability. Zen Pinball 2 for Wii U, PlayStation 3 and PS Vita and Pinball FX 2 on Xbox 360 feature a Plants vs. Zombies pinball table.\n\nGame Information\n\nPremise\n\nA mob of fun-loving zombies are trying to invade the player's house and eat their brains, and all the player has to do is defend themselves with plants using their skills.\n\nList of sub-versions\n\nMain article: Game versions of Plants vs. Zombies\n\nDue to its big popularity, this game has been ported to various consoles and some Chinese variants had been created.

First, the zombies start invading the player's house from the front lawn (mainly with Zombies and Conehead Zombies). The player needs to use their plants to defend against them such as Peashooters, Sunflowers, and Wall-nuts. After each level, a new plant is obtained. After fending off four Zombie invasion attempts, Crazy Dave is introduced and challenges the player to a game of Wall-nut Bowling. After bowling over zombie heads, a new zombie is introduced, and on every second level, (excluding bonus levels) another is introduced. After another new zombie and eight plants, the zombies perform an \"all-out-attack\" in an attempt to overwhelm the player's plants. After the zombies lost, they retreat and plot to attack again.\n\nThe next stage, Night, is different. There are graves on the player's lawn and nocturnal mushrooms are introduced. In exchange for sleeping in the day, these plants are cheaper than most plants. After level 2-4, the player is awarded the Suburban Almanac, which contains technical information and humorous notes on every plant and zombie in the game. After this level, it can be reached from the main menu. Both plant and zombie databases increase as the player continues the adventure mode and encounters new ones. In the bonus level, Crazy Dave lets the player play a game of Whack a Zombie using (mainly) a mallet to kill zombies rather than plants. After another all-out attack, the zombies regroup and plot other intentions.\n\nAfter the night, the zombies try to attack the player's backyard. Here, the lanes are expanded from the normal five to six, two of these being full of water where aquatic plants can be placed, but most other regular plants require assistance from Lily Pads to be used. During 3-2, a present is dropped containing mini-games. At the end of level 3-4, the last zombie drops Crazy Dave's Car Key, which opens Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies and the purchase of upgrades is allowed. In the bonus level, Crazy Dave tells the player smaller zombies are invading the lawn.\n\nAfter the Pool is Fog. The zombies are still entering through the backyard, but it's at night, so again no sun is falling from the sky. Also, fog covers most of the screen, making it unable to see where the zombies are coming. As the player progresses through the levels, the fog moves closer and closer to their house. The player is given Planterns and Blovers to make the fog go away. The player unlocks Puzzle Mode in level 4-6. The player then learns how to play Vasebreaker, breaking vases with plants or zombies inside them. On the final fog level, the whole screen is dark with only a few short intervals of light. The zombies encountered carry exploding jack-in-the-boxes, fly over the player's defenses on balloons, dig to overwhelm defenses in the back and can hop over all of the player's plants with a pogo stick.\n\nThe final part of Adventure Mode is the Roof. Here, all of the player's plants will have to be planted on Flower Pots. The roof's slanted angle means that the player will most likely only use lobbed shot plants to hit zombies. On the roof, the player encounters zombies that have bungee cords, ladders, and basketball catapults. The player even encounters the super-strong Gargantuar and his friend. In the bonus level, Crazy Dave tells the player that the \"annoying\" Bungee Zombies plan to send zombies to get to the house quicker. Finally, the player encounters zombie mastermind Dr. Edgar George Zomboss in Adventure Mode's finale, where he places zombies on the Night Roof in his Zombot. When the player beats him, the player obtains the Silver Sunflower Trophy, the credits roll, and Zombies on Your Lawn plays.\n\nAfter beating Adventure Mode the first time, the player can play over and over again, where Crazy Dave gives the player three seed packets along with the rest that he or she chooses. When playing Level 4-10 again, the player gets to encounter the mysterious Zombie Yeti which gives diamonds when killed. Once the player beats Dr. Zomboss again, he or she are rewarded with three diamonds.\n\nAfter Adventure Mode\n\nThe player can also play other modes. Once the player beats Adventure Mode, they can play all mini-games, which are just like Adventure Mode but with some very special variation. For example, the player can bowl different types of Wall-nuts at zombies in Wall-nut Bowling, fight zombie-plant hybrids in ZomBotany, beat Invisible Zombies in Invisi-ghoul, meet little Zombies again in Big Trouble Little Zombie, try to complete some hard mini-games such as Column Like You See 'Em and Bobsled Bonanza, or face Dr. Zomboss again in his new-and-improved Zombot. Once the player completes all the mini-games, he or she can play them again and again.\n\nAnother game mode is Puzzle Mode. This is an extremely strategic and logic mode. In I, Zombie, the player gets to control zombies and chew cardboard plants to eat brains. The player can also play Vasebreaker as they could in level 4-5 of Adventure Mode. On the iOS versions of Plants vs. Zombies, the player can play Last Stand, a remix of the mini-game where they get a certain amount of sun to go five straight flags without collecting any. The player can also test their real skill in the Endless modes of these.\n\nIn Survival Mode, the player gets to face extremely large hordes of zombies that last up to ten flags. Taking place in each area, the player can see how good at Plants vs. Zombies they really are and use their top strategies to go for a long time in each area. The player can also change their plants as they complete a flag or two. Once the player completes all ten Survival levels, the player can play Survival: Endless and not only break their old records, but earn a lot of money and kill a lot of zombies.\n\nThe player can also grow plants in the Zen Garden. The player can water, fertilize, and play music for their plants, make them happy, and earn a lot of money. The player can also grow a Tree of Wisdom, where they can learn some strategy hints and tips the more the tree is fed. The player can also learn about some codes that change the game.\n\nThere are many other things the player can do in the game as well. When the player enters Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies, they can go on a shopping spree and buy extra seed slots, upgrade plants, and accessories for their Zen Garden. The player can earn money by getting trophies and killing zombies. In the multiplayer modes on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS versions of Plants vs. Zombies, the player can play with a friend. Versus Mode allows the player to face a friend, plants versus zombies, and see who prevails in the final end. In Co-op Mode, the player can beat waves of zombies with a friend on their side. The player can also replay their favorite Adventure Mode levels in Quick Play, or try to complete all the achievements. The player can view the Suburban Almanac, which shows descriptions of plants and zombies, along with a comedic comment about the plant or zombie in question. The player can even create their own Flag Zombie in Zombatar.\n\nPlants\n\nMain article: Plants (PvZ)\n\nDay plants\n\nPeashooter\n\nSunflower\n\nCherry Bomb\n\nWall-nut\n\nPotato Mine\n\nSnow Pea\n\nChomper\n\nRepeater\n\nNight plants\n\nPuff-shroom\n\nSun-shroom\n\nFume-shroom\n\nGrave Buster\n\nHypno-shroom\n\nScaredy-shroom\n\nIce-shroom\n\nDoom-shroom\n\nPool plants\n\nLily Pad\n\nSquash\n\nThreepeater\n\nTangle Kelp\n\nJalapeno\n\nSpikeweed\n\nTorchwood\n\nTall-nut\n\nFog plants\n\nSea-shroom\n\nPlantern\n\nCactus\n\nBlover\n\nSplit Pea\n\nStarfruit\n\nPumpkin\n\nMagnet-shroom\n\nRoof plants\n\nCabbage-pult\n\nFlower Pot\n\nKernel-pult\n\nCoffee Bean\n\nGarlic\n\nUmbrella Leaf\n\nMarigold\n\nMelon-pult\n\nUpgrade plants\n\nGatling Pea\n\nTwin Sunflower\n\nGloom-shroom\n\nCattail\n\nWinter Melon\n\nGold Magnet\n\nSpikerock\n\nCob Cannon\n\nSpecial plants\n\nImitater\n\nExplode-o-nut\n\nGiant Wall-nut (except Nook)\n\nGiant Sunflower (PC only)\n\nGiant Marigold (PC only)\n\nReverse Repeater (Vasebreaker only)\n\nZombies\n\nMain article: Zombies (PvZ)\n\nDay zombies\n\nZombie\n\nFlag Zombie\n\nConehead Zombie\n\nPole Vaulting Zombie\n\nBuckethead Zombie\n\nNight zombies\n\nNewspaper Zombie\n\nScreen Door Zombie\n\nFootball Zombie\n\nDancing Zombie\n\nBackup Dancer\n\nPool zombies\n\nDucky Tube Zombie\n\nSnorkel Zombie\n\nZomboni\n\nZombie Bobsled Team\n\nDolphin Rider Zombie\n\nDolphin\n\nFog zombies\n\nJack-in-the-Box Zombie\n\nBalloon Zombie\n\nDigger Zombie\n\nPogo Zombie\n\nZombie Yeti\n\nRoof zombies\n\nBungee Zombie\n\nLadder Zombie\n\nCatapult Zombie\n\nGargantuar\n\nImp\n\nDr. Zomboss\n\nEndless mode zombies\n\nGiga-gargantuar (versions with Survival: Endless, Co-op Endless or Last Stand: Endless only)\n\nGiga-Football Zombie (web version only)\n\nZombotany zombies\n\nPeashooter Zombie (except Nook)\n\nWall-nut Zombie (except Nook)\n\nGatling Pea Zombie (except Nook)\n\nTall-nut Zombie (except Nook)\n\nJalapeno Zombie (except Nook)\n\nSquash Zombie (except Nook)\n\nVersion-exclusive zombies\n\nTrash Can Zombie (DS and console versions only)\n\nTarget Zombie (DS and console versions only)\n\nBaseball Zombie (DS only)\n\nCatapult Baseball Zombie (DS only)\n\nDecorative & promotional zombies\n\nChinese zombies (except Original PC version)\n\nZombie Worm (except Original PC version)\n\nSunflower Zombie (console versions only)\n\nGallery\n\nPlants vs. Zombies Wiki has a gallery for Plants vs. Zombies.\n\nSound Description https://plantsvszombies.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Plants_vs_Zombies_Main_Menu_Soundtrack.ogg The game's main menu soundtrack https://plantsvszombies.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Buttonclick.ogg The game's button click\n\nIn other languages\n\nPlease note that only official translations are used.\n\nLanguage Name Description English Plants vs. Zombies Simplified Chinese 植物大战僵尸 Traditional Chinese 植物大戰殭屍 French Plantes contre Zombies German Pflanzen gegen Zombies Italian Piante contro zombi Japanese プラント vs. ゾンビ Spanish Plantas contra Zombis\n\nOfficial website\n\nOfficial Facebook page"
