        "text": "HAMMER PERFORMANCE is the joint venture of a couple of die-hard Harley/Buell Racers, \"HAMMER Dan\" Norlin and Aaron Wilson. We started this company to bring you the best Harley performance products out there, whether they're products of our own making or somebody else's. Years of racing experience between the two of us has resulted in a huge knowledge base of what works, and more importantly, what doesn't, and when you buy from Hammer Performance you get the benefit of all that experience.\n\nHAMMER Dan has primarily made his mark in AHDRA drag racing, with numerous wins in the highly competitive \"Hot Street\" heads-up class on his Buell S1W. Dan is also an AHDRA National Champion in SEP, and has won the High Stakes Shootout twice and been runner up twice. Dan has been porting heads for years, providing all of the head porting services for a well-known major shop, using his own CNC machine and other equipment. Years of hard work preparing race and street heads has resulted in Dan's ability to turn out a perfect set of heads every time.\n\nAaron's passion is land speed racing at the Bonneville Salt Flats. Bikes prepared by Aaron currently hold a total of 16 records at the flats, at speeds up to 213 miles per hour. Aaron's bikes have also won the award for \"Fastest U.S. V-Twin\" at the International Speed Trials by Bub in 4 out of the 7 years the event has been running. Can you say \"domination\"? Horsepower is the name of the game at Bonneville and Dan prepares all of the heads that go on Aaron's engines, and has for several years. Aaron also manufactures the CNC billet pieces you'll find on our web site, and developed the CNC programs we use for head porting.\n\nAs of January 2024, Aaron is officially retired. \"Hammer Dan\" Norlin is now the sole owner and operator of HAMMER PERFORMANCE."
