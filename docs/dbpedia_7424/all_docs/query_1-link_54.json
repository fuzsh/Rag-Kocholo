        "text": "Well, by far and away your biggest question should be: is my game going to be commercial? If so, then you will have to obtain a Source engine license, which is going to be (in most cases) substantially more costly than other engines, especially options like Unity. From the jist of your post I assume you aren't going to be commercial, though.\n\nIf your game is not going to be commercial, you can use the Source engine for free, but then you will have limited access to the engine and be at the mercy of the SDK tools. Valve has not done a great job (I am putting this lightly) at maintaining the SDK lately and the tools remain in a near-broken state.\n\nPersonally, speaking as someone who has worked on multiple Source SDK mods since 2005, I would stay as far away from source as possible. The tools are simply far too outdated and unkempt at this point. They have literally gotten worse as time has passed; for example the demo smoother tool (used to edit the camera movement in a demo to get good footage for movies such as trailers), has actually become harder to use from the Episode 1 SDK to the Orange Box SDK. It has more bugs and more crashes. The other tools can have the same said of them, OBSDK's Hammer (the level editing tool) now has multiple render bugs that did not exist in previous SDK versions, etc... it simply feels as if they do not care about their free tools anymore. It's a shame, as mods are a huge part of why Valve is what they are today. I do not know if their commercial tools fare the same (I would hope not!), but given what I have experienced with the free SDK there is no way I would ever consider purchasing/using the source engine for a commercial game.\n\nAs for other free engines, Ogre3D and Irrlicht are worth looking into as well. Also the Torque engine from Garage Games has just recently re-launched with a much lower price, $100 for their 3D engine, down from what used to be around $2000 iirc.\n\nThe Source Engine is an interesting toolset. It is not for everyone. Mostly it is for the mod crowd, and for those that wish to make a commercially released game. The interface hasn't changed much in years. That could be looked at as a good or a bad thing, depending on the user. Compared to UDK, it is a breath of fresh air. It is half way between UDK, CryEngine, and Unity. UDK has a convoluted import process that is un-necessarily complicated. If you don't want to deal with programming in Unity, you have to purchase quite a few plugins to get to the level of a AAA quality game. Source is not as dependant on programming. CryEngine has a propietary format, and currently only provides support for Maya, and 3DS Max. If you do not use those packages, you will hit a brick wall in your development. To see what progress has been made with this issue visit http://www.crydev.net/newspage.php?news=89611\n\nFor all of you that want an all inclusive package that does it all, Source is a viable alternative. Source doesn't have those strange import issues. There are tools for artificial intelligence, spawn points, hurt zones, heads up display creation, skyboxes with parallax effects, audio zones, ragdoll physics, vehicle physics, rope effects, cloth dynamics, facial animation, body animation, particles, and destructible objects. Source is also compatible with many 3D content applications, not just the most popular packages.\n\nA powerful combination is the Source Engine, and Blender. Blender can be downloaded at http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/\n\nThe source engine is more a professionnal engine, I would recommend to use it if you have a project within a company, but if you are doing something \"through\" the help of internet, my answer is that you can't beat open source: its use is more widespread and their usage is more commonly \"standard\" in its design, while professionnal engines usually have been made with a goal in mind, which were half life 2 and all other mods alike, and thus, those requirements with their deadlines made it more difficult to use, even if the result is awesome.\n\nIt really depends how do you work and what do you want to do; I'm not much experience, but as I see it, even an indie would use open source rather than pro engines.\n\nOpen source softwares always have to shine in ease of use, whatever is the result, because that's the only thing that makes a software better than another: OSS and internet are brothers for life, but they can't beat the voodoo magics of proprietary top-notch last-generation software."
