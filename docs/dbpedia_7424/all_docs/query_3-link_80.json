        "text": "Here we are, once again, to rank a pile of absolutely sensational video games.\n\nFor anyone who did not see the previous list, there was a version of it in 2019, and that sparked a lot of conversation with friends and colleagues at the time that I really enjoyed. Hopefully more of you will shout at me from afar championing iconic exclusions like Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid or World of Warcraft once again. I like hearing why you think I’m wrong! I do, admittedly, prefer it when you think I’m right, or at least find a game that I love but you have never heard of. This list is meant to be a celebration of great games, so I hope each of you will find something here that you want to go out and play for yourselves.\n\nThis was difficult to do again, and especially hard to call the Top 10. Like before I had a few ground rules.\n\nRule #1 - Games that I have worked on are ineligible for the list. So, nothing by Popcap or DIGIT Games Studios. Maybe I’ll write an article on these games in the future if I can.\n\nRule #2 - Only one game from each series/franchise is allowed. So, only one game from the Halo series or the Resident Evil series, etc. This is mainly so that the list doesn’t become a sequel-fest. I’d rather have a diverse and interesting list, than have all the same things for piles of this list. In the individual entries where I think multiple games are fantastic, I’ll mention them, briefly.\n\nRule #3 - If I haven’t finished the game in question, it needs to wait for a future list. Not many games fall into this category, but there are a few I’m part-way through over the last few months that may eventually be finished and turn out to be Top 75 material. But for now, adding unfinished games just seems unfair.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nOn to the games…\n\nJet Set Radio came along a few years after the Tony Hawk craze was at its fullest, and I see it as Sega’s attempt to take that skate-score genre into a new direction. What they ended up with was way more than the sum of its parts. They were super smart with how they went about presenting this title. The gorgeous cel-shaded graphics were a precursor to the style used by so many other games later. They offered the chance for players to create their own graffiti tags and use them in-game, which was a level of customisation unheard of in console gaming in the day. I wonder how many dicks people made on day one. The controls around tagging were also pretty fun, often using the rotation of the analog stick in a particular direction a certain number of degrees in a specified time, which felt curiously like you were holding the spray paint cans.\n\nJet Set Radio had a killer soundtrack and fantastic level design, and as a package the whole thing was incredibly original. There was a sequel on Xbox called Jet Set Radio Future, which was also excellent and well worth a try. This is one of the best Sega titles and one worthy of a modern sequel some day.\n\nThe Walking Dead’s plot was basically the entire game. Gameplay was walking about waiting for events to happen, such as a zombie breaking through a door and chasing you, and dealing with it. On the surface, it’s a very simple game and owes a lot to the old LucasArts games of the 80s and 90s. Where Telltale innovated was in the narrative itself, the choices they forced you to make and how they made so many of those choices feel like they mattered like a life and death situation. In reality, a lot of the choices only impacted the story in a minor way, but the experience of going along that journey was captivating and every step felt like a leap into the unknown.\n\nOf course, Telltale made such a hit with this game that they went on to clone it dozens of times over with other stories, and not once did they match the impact of The Walking Dead. The moment that stands out most to me involves choosing to use a breezeblock. Anyone who played the game will know what I’m referring to. It’s a grim setting and it had a great ending. It was something that was not afraid to make you agonise over a decision, and then proudly displayed your main choices at the end of each chapter, comparing them to the rest of the game audience who played through before you.\n\nIf you haven’t played this, or any other Telltale games, it’s absolutely worth picking it up, even on your phone these days, and playing through for the narrative experience.\n\n#61 The Turing Test\n\n(previously #74)\n\nThe Turing Test is one of many Portal-esque first-person puzzlers that came out in the 2010s. This time, your voiceless protagonist is stuck in a space station with only a computer AI for company. Doesn’t that sound familiar? Don’t let the comparisons put you off. There’s a lot to like in this one.\n\nSome of the gameplay additions in The Turing Test feel so obvious and clever that it’s a wonder why Valve didn’t think of them back in the day. The whole thing with connectors and wires is one that immediately seems laborious, but how the team behind this game use them is amazing. Every multi-room puzzle you find yourself in feels like an escape room, because that’s essentially what you’re doing.\n\nThe story that drags its heels along behind you in The Turing Test is mostly filler, but it does add a sense of purpose as we find your way through the labyrinth of twisted scenarios before you. If you had any fun with Portal, this one will probably appeal to you too. I loved it.\n\n#56 Mini Metro\n\n(previously #98)\n\nIf you like puzzle games, this is one that you have to try. I originally found Mini Metro on PC, but have since downloaded the mobile version and I think the touch screen controls make it that bit better. It’s a total bargain on mobile, so pick it up for your commute or lunch break right now if you’ve not done that already.\n\nThe minimalist look to this fairly abstracted game makes it seem simple, but this game is amazingly deep for what it shows you at first glance. Your task is to draw coloured lines between different shapes. These shapes are train stations, and the lines are your tracks. Passengers will spawn at stations, matching the shape of other stations, which is where they want to go.\n\nMore and more stations (and with them passengers) will appear, and some tracks will require tunnels or multiple carriages to make the demands on your network feasible to meet. Like all good puzzlers before it, Mini-Metro earns its stripes by starting you off lightly, almost to the point of luring you into a false sense of security, before speeding up and multiplying at a rate that challenges you that bit more with each passing minute.\n\nThe game comes with multiple cities to tackle, all of which are a slight variation on the previous one, but you will likely find one that is your favourite and stick with it, score attack style, edging your best efforts over and over again.\n\n#54 Bioshock\n\n(previously #35)\n\nBioshock is the one of the most impressive works of art direction in video game history. Rapture, the under-the-ocean utopian dream turned nightmare, is an aesthetic and atmospheric wonderland. It becomes the perfect setting for this creepy and tragic story of how one man’s dream quickly derailed into a sandbox for the worst of human nature.\n\nThe original Bioshock is by far my favourite in the series. Bioshock 2 felt like a weaker re-thread to me, and while Bioshock Infinite was interesting, it couldn’t match the underwater setting and Big Daddy encounters of the first one.\n\nBioshock is more than your average FPS game. A lot of your success will come from how you use the ADAM material that allows you to upgrade your skills. Another key aspect of how this all comes together relies on your interactions with the absolutely creepy Little Sisters, seemingly helpless girls who are loaded with ADAM material for you to harvest, if you choose to go down that route.\n\nThis game has a captivating story that is heavily reliant on not knowing the outcome. There’s a beautiful use of wordplay in the dialogue that will provide an “Aha!” moment for everyone playing. I won’t spoil it here. But Bruce Willis is a ghost. Check out Bioshock if you haven’t played it before. You can usually get it in a bundle with the others, but if you ask me, the first one is the only essential play of the lot.\n\n#47 Apex Legends / Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds\n\n(previously #43)\n\nIt’s pretty tough to separate PUBG and the 2019 challenger to its crown, Apex Legends. On any given day, either of these could take the slot over the other. Recently, it’s Apex Legends that has the edge for me. I enjoy the visual style of the game, the running and sliding about, and the jump-pad / launchers dotted around the levels. The sci-fi aesthetic is my jam too. PUBG’s advantages are in the weapons, the more flexibility with hiding in plain sight, and vehicles.\n\nBoth games are Battle Royale shooters. You can play solo or in teams, always going for glory by being the last one standing against a total of 100 players who are all literally dropped into a huge island level.\n\nThe games both feature a circle of death on the map which slowly (then rapidly) begins to close towards a single point. If you’re outside this circle, your health starts to drop until your dead. This brilliant piece of design started with PUBG (I believe!) and has been adopted by many others in the genre. What it does is it forces players to converge as more and more of them are eliminated, creating a tense and more restrictive area of control for each player/team and keeps them fighting throughout the session.\n\nPUBG and Apex Legends are both massively popular online shooters that have taken the world be storm in recent years. If you ever want to squad up, I’m not the best player in the world, but chances are I’m always up for a game of either.\n\nDuelyst’s charms are in its game mechanisms and how they blend so well together. Placing your units is done by paying for cards in your hand, which are drawn from a deck. They are placed relative to your Hero, who is both your best unit in battle and what your opponent needs to defeat in order to win. The game board is also very chess-like in size, but rather than being all about toppling a weak piece like the King, it’s a showdown between high-powered Queens.\n\nHere, the deck building is very streamlined and straightforward at first, and the developers are careful not to overburden you with too many options right off the bat. You can complete single player campaigns with various heroes to unlock more cards and even full decks to mix up your possibilities. When you have a style of play that you like, it becomes a bit like taking a main in a competitive fighting or shooting game and running with them in online play.\n\nOf all the games on this list, Duelyst is probably the one I wish I had the time to soak into it again, largely because it was discontinued by the developer/publisher a couple of years ago. However, a fan-reboot is currently in Beta, and looks to restore the game completely. I will be eagerly awaiting the official relaunch this year! If you like card games, particularly CCGs, or board games in general, Duelyst is one of the best hybrid games you’ll ever play, so I hope you’ll join me in game when the time comes.\n\n#43 Grandia 2\n\n(previously #60)\n\nWeirdly, this game has risen in the ranks without me having played it in years. I think that’s partly due to lots of other older games falling off, but this one remains one that I know I’ll enjoy again to this day.\n\nGrandia 2 is one of the best JRPGs ever made. It wipes the floor with Final Fantasy for me, and when it comes to the action-queue style turn-based combat, it’s the smartest and most exciting game in the genre.\n\nOn the surface, Grandia 2 (which is actually significantly different from the original) looks like your typical anime inspired JRPG, but what you’re actually getting when you explore the first few hours of this title are a whole heap of surprises. Most of these come from the characters you meet and recruit to your cause along the journey. Your primary character is Ryudo, a Geohound (kinda like a mercenary or bodyguard) who has been hired to protect a young lady who is of utmost importance in the battle between good and evil. The story seems pretty bog-standard, right? Well, let’s just say that shit gets real pretty soon after.\n\nDishonored is kind of unlike anything else out there. It’s a stealth game. It’s also a bit like you’re a wizard wearing a mask in an alternate industrial revolution era city. It’s also about shooting and stabbing things in creative and terrifying ways.\n\nFirst and foremost, Dishonored is a murder mystery, where you’ve been framed for the murder. You’re also discovering that the laws of physics are your plaything in many regards and that in order to unravel the mystery, that initial murder certainly will not be the last.\n\nI’m terrible at stealth in games. A good friend of mine watched me play a small portion of Dishonored at lunch-time in work and couldn’t stop laughing at how much of a bumbling buffoon I was, even when cast as the nimble-footed shadow character who almost can’t fail at staying out of sight. So for me, Dishonored may have ended up being more of an action-adventure than it will be for you. It’s feasible to play it that way (as I can attest to first hand!) but I’ve seen skilled players master levels without being seen and that was way more impressive that anything I could do myself behind the controls. I played Dishonored again during the pandemic and am gearing up to play Death of the Outsider and Dishonored 2 in the coming months. One or both of those entries in the series could be superior, but for now, I highly recommend the original.\n\nYour first encounter with a Colossus is with a giant who wields a huge club. Its body is covered with hair and stone, which you quickly realise is your target destination. In order to topple this guy, you’re going to need to distract it, climb on top of its head, and jam your sword through a weakpoint in its skull. This is massively daunting at first, and when you start to climb, every moment feels like the most dangerous thing you’ve ever done.\n\nBy the time you’ve found your way through the adventure, you’ll have taken down a Colossus that can fly (which is my favourite one by far!) and used all kinds of environment manipulating tricks to topple and defeat others. One Colossus that stands out in my memory is another giant, this time wielding an enormous (like apartment building sized) sword, which you need to intimidate into trying to hit you with it, so you can climb onto the weapon and use it as a ramp to the creature’s weakpoints.\n\nNow, lets address something that is apparent, even with the PS4 remake of the game - the controls. This game does not have good controls. This is a big reason why it has fallen a bit since the last list, and while they’re not bad exactly, they are cumbersone and a bit clumsy, which for me is that bit harder than it used to be. By no means a deal-breaker, but something to be aware of going in - if you’re going to try SotC in 2022, be ready to take a bit of time getting used to the rhythm of this game’s controls. I promise you, it will be worth it.\n\n#37 Forager\n\n(new entry)\n\nWow. This game.\n\nThis is a fucking incredible game.\n\nForager is the game that has the biggest gap between how much I thought I would would like it initially, and how much I loved it by the time I was done. Ever. I thought it looked like dumb retro shit, and then I played it for 50+ hours in less than two weeks and restarted it because I was sad it was over.\n\nYou start off as a little guy with a basic weapon on a tiny island. You can break rocks to get raw materials and fight basic enemies to get other useful things. Then you go on adventure after adventure while slowly building a little engine of generators, tools and bots that snowball your relative power constantly in a way that is immensely addictive and satisfying.\n\nForager is a goddamn masterclass in game design. Its progression pacing, it’s sense of achievement, its ability to signpost the way and seamlessly integrate its UX with your chosen path through the research tree and temples is… exceptional. Truly exceptional. It’s a game that has a vast array of systems, but never feels complex. It’s a shoe that fits every foot, because it’s built with teaching itself in mind first, and rewarding your efforts at perfectly timed intervals along the way.\n\n#31 Destiny 2\n\n(new entry)\n\nDestiny 2 is definitely a lifestyle game - the kind of game that you could very easily get hooked on and ignore all other video games for years on end and just play this. It’s partly down this the fact that the game is essentially never-ending that is what keeps it out of my Top 30. I love it, I go through intense weeks of just playing Destiny 2, and then I realise how little time I have for games compared to the amount I want to play, and I begrudgingly take a step back from it. But I always come back, and each stay with the game gets longer than the one before.\n\nBungie really smashed it with this game. I’ve always liked their Halo games, and Destiny feels like a natural evolution of that original Halo vision. The idea of slowly but surely improving your gear and armor and stuff is obviously born from MMO DNA, but I have exclusively played Destiny 2 as a single player experience, only dipping into multiplayer co-op with randomers whenever it was a requirement to progress a section or part of the story. I’m probably missing some of the best bits of the experience by not playing with a friend group, but frankly I just don’t enjoy trying to coordinate real-life schedules to do that. Just give me the shooty guns whenever I want to have them, thanks. Massively Me Offline is the MMO for me.\n\n#25 Super Mario Bros. 3 / Super Mario Maker 2\n\n(previously #24)\n\nHere he is. The Italian plumber. Choosing Super Mario Bros. 3 over Super Mario Bros. was tough. They’re both pretty freakin’ amazing, especially when you consider how old they are now, and how well they hold up to this day. Whether you like platform games or not, chances are you’ve probably played one or both of these. They’re iconic for a reason. That reason is that they’re absolutely fucking incredible.\n\nAnd adding Super Mario Maker 2 to this entry is my way of covering my ass, as with Maker 2, you effectively have all of the 2D Mario games at your disposal, plus infinitely more levels, and the ability to make more of your own design. It’s brilliant!\n\nWhat makes Mario 3 my favourite of the series is mainly the range of power ups you can get. The levels are more varied too. Mario can get into a giant shoe. Or dress like a frog. It makes him a nightmare to control on land, but he swims amazingly when wearing it. The best power up though, of course, is the tanooki suit. Mario gets some racoon ears and a tail and if he runs fast enough, he can take off and fly for a limited time.\n\n#21 Elden Ring\n\n(new entry)\n\nElden Ring is, unquestionably, the most flawed masterpiece on this entire list. It’s cumbersome, outrageously frustrating in places, fails utterly to explain anything about how to progress or play it, and forces you to feel inconsequential and stupid regularly… before you feel like a fucking legend for figuring it out.\n\nElden Ring is maddening. It really is. I hate how almost imperceptible it can be at times. But it’s also beautiful, and feral, and insane. you are thrown into this world that has fallen apart, is rotting from within, and holds countless secrets and mysteries. Unravelling parts of those is one thing, but mounting a challenge to the many wild terrors and monstrosities in its world is another. Mountain-sized dragons, lightning quick warriors, horrific abominations… all sorts are here to kill you. And that’s just the mid-range bosses. The true challenges, like Radahn, the Starscourge, an encounter so outrageously grand in scale and dififculty that it has a whole region of the map all to itself, are initially outright hard pass impossibilities, and then slowly but sure become elements of your own story that you can tell, how you took down this epic creature, or how you slowly but surely ground out a win after countless tries. Every person’s Elden Ring journey shares the same beats, but has its own tale.\n\nElden Ring’s locations are spellbinding. The underground river, the heights above the elevators into the clouds, the many castles, palaces, cathedrals, throne rooms, libraries and fallen cities… They’re all a sight to behold. I love Elden Ring. It is incredible. I also wish it would just do a little bit more to help you out, show you what to do, maybe not be so punishing so often. That’s partly me, I get that. But it’s also notoriously tough in places. The sense of gratification you have when you progress through those tough set pieces is part of the appeal, and it is immensely cool when you get by the latest hurdle… But for me, Elden Ring is at its best when it is an expansive world of opportunity, not a hard wall that blocks you entirely. Exploring, discovering and overcoming adversity, it has those things in spades. It’s also - however - difficult to recommend, unless you’re ready to work for your good time, and feel really, truly beaten, at times. Getting to the end is grueling, and ultimately, totally worth the hardship. I think we’ll be talking about Elden Ring for decades to come.\n\nAs the Empire come to conquer Edge’s homeland, he decides to use the dragon to defend it, and in turn chase down Craymen and get his revenge. All the while, Azel, atop her gargantuan dragon Atolm (which makes your dragon look like a hatchling by comparison) it hunting you down.\n\nGameplay in PD Saga is split between three phases. You have the usual RPG thing of wandering around on foot talking to NPCs, getting quests, buying resources and getting deeper into the story. You also have exploring atop your dragon in freeform open world style exploration, with certain areas locked off based on what your dragon can and cannot do. Then third is combat. This is where Panzer Dragoon Saga shines. Whenever a battle occurs in PD Saga, the first thing you will notice is a radar on the bottom of the screen. This is not to show you which enemies are approaching. It’s to gauge your relative position to the target you’re fighting. Key to your success in this turn-based battle is your position. Some enemies are stronger from the front, the back or the side, and all have a weakpoint, or some combination of attacks you use in certain ways that weaken them. Learning how to exploit the relative positioning is what makes PD Saga so engaging.\n\nTo play PDS these days, you likely need a stable Saturn emulator and a ROM, but acquiring these things is far easier now than it has been in the past. It’s absolutely worth it, especially if you are willing to take on a retro game that almost laughs in the face of modern control scheme innovations. It hasn’t aged well in that regard, but the depth of tactical gameplay and immersion is there, even now, and Panzer Dragoon Saga is somehow timeless even in its aging state!\n\nRE4 invented the \"shoulder cam\" for the series and took the claustrophobic fixed camera away, meaning that it had fewer visual tricks available to hide the horrors at first, but as you progress, it uses that freedom you weren't used to in older games against you. Allowing you to edge the camera around a corner makes you more cautious, upping the tension, and when it was justified, scaring the shit out of you.\n\nThe hair-raising sounds of a Devastator breathing… The unforgettable first time that chainsaw revving reveals that it's someone coming for you… These moments are unlike anything else in games. The controls and pace of Resident Evil 4 feel a little dated now, but like older entries in the series, that actually feels like part of what makes it fun. The tank-turning Leon is a hero, but definitely not a superhero, and as an extension of yourself in this horror, is a clumsy joy to direct about. Resident Evil is a classic gaming series. By all means, insert your favourite one here. Mine is RE4.\n\nThere is a full on remake of RE4 coming in the near future, and even though I’m a total horror-game wimp these days, I may put my heart and nerves on standby for another trip through this nightmare.\n\n#15 Forza Motorsport series / Forza Horizon series\n\n(Forza Motorsport 7 was previously #20)\n\nWe’re getting into a lot of best-in-genre games now, and without question, Forza Motorsport is the best racing series of all time. Forza Horizon, too, is the best arcade racer of all time. As far as ludicrous racing shenanigans go, Forza Horizon 5 is Game of the Year standard stuff. My slight preference is with the sim racer side of Forza, but really you have to lob Horizon into the mix as they’re just so damn fun as well.\n\nForza Motorsport is the epitome of racing simulation greatness and a must play game for anyone interested in cars or motor racing. I chose Forza 7 here because it’s basically a content upgrade over the other recent games in the series. The Forza that I have poured the most time into though, and by a long margin, is Forza Motorsport 3. I must have left 1000 hours behind the wheel of that game. I also dropped 100s of hours into Forza 2, for much the same reason. The series has taken small evolutionary jumps along the way and F7 has reached a point where they pretty much can’t do anything more to improve it. Yet, come the 8th entry, I’m sure I’ll be proven wrong.\n\nForza’s car handling is based on a physics engine that takes into account actual tire wear (which is probably the largest differentiator in racing) and other key aspects like brake temperature and long/short gear ratios. It does so in a way that feels more natural than other big racing game series. At its heart, Forza should be played as a massively long career mode, where you need to grind your way through the ranks, starting with a hatchback and work your way to Prototype racing or single-seaters. If you don’t have the patience for that, or don’t need another lifestyle game to lose your free time into, there’s plenty of alternative in the Forza 7 package. Online racing is a big part of Forza’s jump-in-and-play best. If you’re willing to pay huge penalties for small mistakes, it’s a riveting gaming experience. If you think Dark Souls is razor thin on margins of success or failure, you’re in for a shock if you ever take to competitive Forza Motorsport.\n\nRegardin Horizon, it somehow makes an open-world, go at your own pace, racing game both a silly adrenaline-fest and serious RPG at the same time. Like, how is that possible? And why is it so enthralling? It’s all about mixing things up, as opposed to Forza Motorsport’s edging lap times by a thousandth of a second style perfectionism. If you’re the kind of person who’d rather drive over a ramp at maximum speed, Horizon is the Forza for you. For me, they’re both excellent, but the racing purist in me adores what Turn 10 have been able to achieve with FM7. Get behind the wheel and enjoy your favourite flavour of Forza.\n\nValhalla also had a contrasting pair of key locations, in hard ice and blizzard ridden Scandinavia, and the green pastures of England. Dropping a nordic warrior into Britain brought with it the potential for interesting historical storylines that harken back to AC’s roots. It’s a formula that has been getting more refined over each entry, and I feel has gotten to its peak with the latest game.\n\nI’d be remiss if I failed to mention the mighty dice game Orlog that was designed by my good friend Dave Glennon, and team, and contributed many hours to my Valhalla play time. This little beauty is a mini-game that you can play in Valhalla as part of quests or to gain money. Often, I replayed against opponents just for the fun of the game itself. I’m hoping for a multiplayer version some day.\n\nI’ve got two or three meaty expansion packs to dive into in the near future that I’ve been saving for a special occasion. AC games have grown bloated and gigantic in recent incarnations, and Valhalla is right up there with the other recent ones in terms of size, with easily 80-120 hours of gameplay in the base game for completionists to scour over. I fell somewhere in the middle, and am excited to explore Paris and my homeland of Ireland in the expansions soon.\n\nI find the Titan combat in this game to actually be the weakest part of it. The mechs themselves are fantastic. The way they move, the HUD you have when piloting one, the movement, the tangible sense of heavyweight control you have when inside one… It’s all pretty satisfying. But for me, Titanfall 2 is all about being the pilot, outside the mech, wall-running, jumping and twisting, sniping, taking cover, sliding… the list goes on. The sense of freedom you have at the feet of the pilot is unmatched in video games. I’ve never controlled a character in a game and felt like I could do exactly what I wanted to do like I do when playing Titanfall 2. It often feels like the game is telepathically linked to my mind and my fingers on the controller are just there for show.\n\nTitanfall 2 has a multiplayer mode that I haven’t really played. I have other games for that. This is all about the campaign for me. If you’ve played this game before, you probably know off the bat the three levels that I’m thinking of when I blurt out: Easily the best levels in any game ever. This is not hyperbole. I refuse to spoil this game with too many details. For fans, Effect and Cause is one of them, of course, and The Ark is one of the most nerve-wracking levels I’ve ever played, but my favourite is actually The Beacon. If you know it, you know it. If you don’t - what the hell are you waiting for? Play Titanfall 2.\n\n#12 Half-Life 2\n\n(previously #12)\n\nOh, boy. Half-Life 2. It’s actually shocking to me that this game couldn’t find a place in the Top 10. That’s just how it goes, I guess.\n\nHalf-Life was a masterpiece on the PC. It felt like a video game could compete with smart science fiction TV and movies. It was designed and written as a narrative experience. It also had some of the best FPS gameplay ever. Then the sequel arrived and smashed it. Half-Life 2 is one of those generational games that comes along and completely rewrites the rules of what a game can be. The first thing that you notice in Half-Life 2 is the physics engine. Havok’s work with Valve to bring this game engine to life cannot be underestimated. Little things like picking up objects to move them about seemed like a little piece of polish on top when you’re first striding through the checkpoint in City 17. When you realise how important this feature will be later, it kinda blows your mind.\n\nThen of course, there’s the Gravity Gun. This is my favourite weapon in any game ever. The power to grab (almost) anything to you and then hurtle it at speed in any direction… It unlocked a plethora of possibilities and emergent opportunities within the game space. It also provided the designers at Valve with a type of level design tool that had never previously been possible.\n\nTrue to its origins, Half-Life 2 had a brilliant story, bringing back the mute Gordon Freeman as the protagonist. You team up with others along the way, most notably Alyx, a survivor of the Combine’s occupation, who is with you on your mission to take them down.\n\nMy absolute favourite moment in Half-Life 2 is when you find yourself in Ravenholm, a town district that has been turned upside down by the rampaging hordes of monsters that have been dragged through to our world from another dimension. Ravenholm is the land of sharp edges. Circular saw blades, arm-mounted swing-blades and other implements of decapitation are littered about the area, giving you all manner of ideas of how to use your Gravity Gun.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a must play game for just about anyone interested in games. The follow-up episodic chapters are also great, but the main game itself is where the best stuff happens. The possibility of a Half-Life 3 has been an internet meme for years, and the recently announced Alyx VR game seems like some kind of step towards it. I’m happy to dive into HL2 every few years regardless and remember that experience for the special thing it is each time.\n\nFire Emblem: Three Houses hits a bullseye multiple times throughout the game with emotional dilemmas and heartbreaks. Your power to make these decisions, or at times powerlessness to do anything about them, is what makes this 70+ hour campaign so riveting.\n\nAlong with the strong story, the gameplay is a strategist's dream. Your units, each of which you'll learn to understand as a personality as much as a tool for war, have their own skills and abilities. They also grow stronger as they learn to work with each other. This relationship system is key to getting the best out of your personell. As they work better together, by healing one another, defeating an enemy together, surviving together, they give one another a bonus in the field.\n\nFire Emblem TH doesn't reinvent the genre or perfect the turns-based tactical game. But what it is is the best JRPG for about 20 years. I've played through one of four story campaigns and loved every minute of it. Over the next few years, I'm sure I'll revisit it and get the other sides of the story.\n\nGTAV’s narrative is unapologetically obscene, once again portraying the game’s protagonists as the scum of the Earth, and justifiably so. Trevor, as a character, is a complete lunatic. There are some scenes in this game where I think they went too far with him, and the line on the edge of dark humour started getting crossed. That’s fine if you sign up for it, and with GTAV you know the stakes when you boot up the game. You’re agreeing to suspend your disbelief and do things no human being would ever do in the real world. That’s most of the fun of the game, at the end of the day. I think most players have saved their progress at one point, just to go off the rails and push their wanted level to extremes, causing murder and mayhem at every corner to taunt the police into asking the FBI for help, then the army… then everything at once to take you down.\n\nGrand Theft Auto, as a series, has been a critical and commercial blockbuster. It’s easy to see why. The freedom to act as you please is alluring, and the toy box filled with helicopters, airplanes, rocket launchers, tanks and all other kinds of boundary expanding vehicles gives you the opportunity to “do some mad shit” whenever you want. I love it as a cohesive campaign with optional rounds of madness. It seems that 110 million+ others feel the same way...\n\n#9 Halo Infinite\n\n(Halo 3 was previously #8)\n\nHalo Infinite is the best Halo.\n\nThe rest of the series as a whole can probably take this spot, at least from Combat Evolved through to Halo: Reach. Each one is a landmark Xbox title, bigger and brighter than the last. For me, Halo 3, the first one on X360 had the best of everything. The best controls, the best campaign, the best multiplayer. It was the game that sat inside my X360 drive uninterrupted for months and months on arrival. I remember buying Crackdown just to get the beta access and playing that Zanzibar online level non-stop for a week.\n\nHalo Infinite then came along in 2021 and somehow made the Halo campaign experience feel fresh and exciting for the first time in a decade. The open world map (gated cleverly by various things you are not even aware of while playing through at first) is key to this reinvigorated adventure. Unlocking areas, freeing captured soldiers, destroying propaganda towers and defensive fortifications… All of it is fun and engaging, while feeling rewarding.\n\nHalo gets so much right. Aesthetically, it's beautiful. The radiant hues and the bright sci-fi lights are mushed into nature in a way that shouldn't work, but does so well. The characters and story, though a little pretentious and pushing the limits of consumable hard-sci-fi are entertaining, if sometimes a little hard to digest. Vehicles. Halo absolutely nails vehicles, whether that's the three-person Warthog land rover, the crazy heavy Scorpion tank, the chaotic Ghost hover bike or the mighty flying Banshee, every one of them is a marvel to take control of.\n\nHalo Infinite also absolutely nails the concept of the Boss Fight. If I was hard pressed to pick a game with teh best bosses ever, I can’t argue against halo Infinite in that regard. These encounters are creative, use the environments to the fullest, and are both satisfying to complete and exhilarating to survive.\n\n#8 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\n\n(previously #5)\n\nBioware are one of my favourite developers and the thought of them working with the Star Wars license was really exciting. I’ve loved Star Wars since I was a kid, and I knew that with their fingerprints on the IP, something special was going to arrive. And something truly wonderful appeared on the Xbox in 2003.\n\nKOTOR is a mash-up of real-time gameplay and (during combat) a game-pausing turns-based system for queueing up attacks, Jedi powers and other actions. At first, your customisable character can pick some attributes that distinguish him/her from others, giving you a chance to mold your experience to the type of play you want to focus on. Do you want to rely heavily on force powers? What about hacking, security and laying traps? Or projectile weapons? If this is starting to sound a bit like Star Wars: Dungeons and Dragons, that’s because that’s essentially the basis of this design. Bioware’s previous games were based on D&D and they were hand-picked to develop this game based on that track record.\n\nSoon after starting your adventure, you meet a bunch of allies, primarily Jedi Bastilla Shan, Mercenary Carth Onasi, Zaalbaar (a Wookiee) and Mission Vao (a bratty Twi’lek who likes to find trouble.) As expected, the dark side gets involved, and as it’s set thousands of years before the movies, this is not the Empire, but rather the Sith at the height of their power. Darth Malak makes his blockbuster appearance missing his lower jaw, wielding an iconic red lightsaber and demanding information. What happened to his master, Darth Revan, the most powerful Sith Lord ever?\n\nAs you’ve been wrapped up in this madman’s seemingly fruitless quest, you find yourself being chased across the galaxy, working with the Jedi Council to train your fledgling Jedi focus. You’ll meet new and unlikely allies, fight recognisable Star Wars monsters and races, all the while, wonder what exactly is going on with your friends, who have been cagey with you since the first visit to Dantooine.\n\nAs you level up and invest ability points in various skills (pro-tip, Force Lightning and its upgrades are pretty powerful) you give yourself more options to queue up in the game’s beautifully designed battle system. This game actually got a mobile port a few years ago and it works staggeringly well, with the game-pausing system suited well to a phone or tablet. It also holds up remarkably well on PC and Xbox for a game that’s over 15 years old. Lightsabers and blaster bolts still look and sound fantastic in game.\n\nBut the real party piece of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is its story. I can state with no exaggeration that it is a better Star Wars than most of the movies, and has the greatest scene of any Star Wars media that I’ve ever consumed. The shock factor that hits you like a sledgehammer about two-thirds of the way through this game is a strike of narrative genius unlike anything before. It takes all the best elements of Star Wars and puts you right in the middle of it all.\n\nIt is worth mentioning the sequel, Obsidian developed KOTOR 2, which hits on a lot of the same beats, but lacks the killer blow of the astonishing storyline of the original. Also, even if you’re not an MMO fan (like myself) I can highly recommend that you dive into the cinematics that were created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, which Bioware developed a few years later. If you like Star Wars, they’re a must-see. Likewise, if you haven’t experienced the awe and wonder of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, what are you waiting for? It’s incredible.\n\nNo game this decade has had the cultural impact of Minecraft. Kids love it. YouTube is filled to the brim with people streaming it, constantly. It’s a phenomenon. It’s also one of the most fun video games I’ve ever played. I constantly refer to it as “Lego for video gamers” and I think that’s about as good a description you can get for it.\n\nMinecraft is a survival game, where you must learn how to craft items from the things you find lying about (or that you’ve punched/chopped/broken from blocks) and eventually either pursue the mysterious endgame scenarios, or if you’re like me, build pretty towers, glass domes and gigantic bridges with no objective other than doing something cool. Again, Lego for video games. I’ve actually never finished the campaign of Minecraft, mainly because I don’t want it to ever end. For me, it’s like a toy box filled with infinite pieces, limited only by my imagination.\n\nIf you've never heard of Minecraft, embrace that ignorance and go play it blind. I wish I could do that again. It’s such a fun game to land into without knowing too much about.\n\nI adore this game, alone or as part of a server with friends, and I always drift back to it every few months to pick up where I left off. It’s original and genius.\n\nTeam Sonic / Camelot, who developed SFIII decided to split the game into three parts, and it was largely due to the fact that the Dreamcast was kicking off and the Saturn’s lack of popularity in the west, that only the first game made it to the USA and Europe. Scenario 1, as it turned out, was only one third of the game. I had played through it (no joke) over twenty times over the next couple of years. I was desperate to play Scenarios 2 and 3. It looked like that would never happen. Not unless I wanted to learn Japanese and find the extremely rare discs online. Then, lo-and-behold, a few years ago, a fan driven translation project was initiated, driving the development of a Saturn emulator, and more than 10 years after giving up hope of ever finding out what happens at the end of the story, Shining Force 3 was back. I played Scenario 2 breathlessly over one joyful week, and Scenario 3 over the following fortnight. Playing them and seeing all the sides of the story, using characters from one faction who I had fought so many times before in the first part… It didn’t matter that the game was a couple of generations old by now, it was the best gaming experience I’d ever had. It took my love of this game and multiplied it.\n\nEvery single battle in Shining Force III is built to be a challenge and offer something new. Sometimes that was with puzzle-bosses that require a special action, item or attack to weaken before you could beat them. Other times it was environmental obstacles, like running railway carriages, giant Golems hurling boulders down a narrow walkway that you must traverse, or a hidden game clock in the form of refugees that are being targeted by enemies and you need to save them. This game often gave you a key element of your next impending success somewhat earlier. Whether that’s the recruitment of characters who could fly, or magic users with a necessary spell, or just information you might need to navigate a labyrinth, everything you need is right in front of you, just waiting to be deciphered.\n\nWalking around towns in full 3D, shopping with the blacksmith, opening treasure chests, all of it - never felt so damn exciting and satisfying as it did as Synbios or Medion in Shining Force III. Every betrayal was a stab in the back. Every new weapon found, forged or bought brought with it exciting new special attacks. Every little thing you did, or explored, rewarded you to the fullest, every single time. Shining Force III simply nailed it. It’s a shamefully forgotten masterpiece of RPG design. I think it’s time to boot up that emulator again.\n\nMass Effect 2 essentially forces you to start everything from scratch. All your buddies from the first game - nowhere to be seen, at least not right away. You need to get a new crew together, stronger, faster and better than the last one, and do the bidding of The Illusive Man, at least enough to keep him appeased, while you figure out what’s actually happening out there.\n\nGameplay in ME2 (and ME3, which to be completely honest, is actually just as good a game as this one) is a twist on the cover-based squad shooter, really. It’s a sci-fi RPG under the skin, but the bulk of your actions will be coordinating your trio of units through firefights, keeping safe and taking down the enemy.\n\nThe Mass Effect games are Bioware’s spiritual follow-up to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, with many elements shared between the two. You can pause and queue up actions, those less pronounced than in KOTOR. ME is much more about real-time and reflex action than slow methodical planning. Much like KOTOR, Mass Effect’s story is the primary draw. If you’ve somehow gone the last ten years without trying Mass Effect, I’d urge you to give it a try. Dive in with Mass Effect 2 if you like. The first one, while very different, has some story elements you’d want to catch up on first, but is otherwise fairly skippable. ME2 is a cinematic achievement and an all-time classic video game.\n\nStarting Link’s journey and learning the ropes is made seamless and effortless by Nintendo. They drop you right in, give you a literal stick to use as a weapon, and send you on your way. Soon, you’re earning your glider, you’re literally diving head first into the world at large, and this open playground full of wonders is before you. You will never experience anything like this again. Savour every moment.\n\nBreath of the Wild has so many things that it does to perfection. Let’s start with its progression. The game leans on your comfort zone constantly, teasing you with a soft-barrier that you don't know how to cross, but has already left you little hints and clues nearby to figure it out at your own pace. A beautiful example early on is the presence of a shrine that you can enter to earn Orbs (which can be spent on stamina or health upgrades) which is atop a hill you can't reach. There's snow all around the hill and going too far in will start to do freeze damage to you. You don't have a special item or armor to counter this. But… Maybe… just maybe if I swing this stick at the bokoblin campfire, it might catch alight. Sure enough, it does. You carry the heat with you, hike up the hill and access the shrine.\n\nThere are hundreds of tiny touches like this throughout the game that all feel subtly genius and impossibly rewarding.\n\nThree years ago, I compiled my list of the Top 100 Games that I have ever played. It was a fun exercise and reminded me of so many classics that had almost faded from memory.\n\nIn the time since, I’ve had the opportunity to revisit many of them, and play a lot of new titles too. Video games remain a huge part of my life. My livelihood is in Game Design itself, and I spend hours each week engrossed in some kind of game, be it the latest hotness, or a retro classic, or something in between. So, I figured I would do it all again. So, here we are.\n\nIn my effort to compile an updated version of my Top 100, a couple of things occurred to me - things that I hope will make this list more useful than the previous incarnation. First of all, 100 is too few, but also too many. I want to encourage all of you to find these games and enjoy them as I have, so while I have completed a ranked list, it did start to get a little meaningless after #75. So, instead of 76-100, and 25 games that are all roughly as good as one another, I’ve chosen to replace it with this large list of honourable mentions. You’ll find them listed below in alphabetical order. These games are all massively worthy of your time. Seek them out and cherish them, if you can.\n\nSecondly, you will find that my new rankings tend to feature much newer titles than before. Part of this is down to my own realisation that I myself have become spoiled by modern quality-of-life advancements in gaming. The list below of honourable mentions skews towards older titles, partially because I have gone back and tried them again during the pandemic, but they did not hold my attention as well as they had originally. This is 100% my failing, and not that of these fine games. You will still find games from 30+ years ago on the Top 75, but you will probably notice that many of the older games chosen in the 2019 list have ended up in this post below instead, this time. Games like Soul Calibur, Duke Nukem 3D or NiGHTS into dreams… are great examples of games that were revolutionary in their day, games that held my attention for countless hours each, would probably at one point each have been my absolute favourite… but when I play today, I am unable to play for more than a few minutes. Games, it seems, are not timeless. Not all of them, anyway.\n\nSo, why recommend them to you, reader, if I would not play them much today myself? Well - the games below, these honourable mentions - are all wonderful titles. Especially if they are new to you. So please, seek them out and explore them for yourselves, and please do tell me that I’m wrong and that the ones you like from those below should be on the main list. I’d love to hear why.\n\nOthers in this section are also very close calls that almost made the ranked list. Some are games that I have played quite recently, and may in the future, merit higher placement. Only time will tell.\n\nThe Top 75 will drop in a single post very soon. Until then, enjoy these close calls, golden oldies, and faded masterpieces…\n\nShining Force III, at face value, looks like a typical anime-inspired Japanese RPG. Underneath, what we have here is the game that perfected the turns-based tactical game, added layer after layer of heart and character, and filled the gaps with secrets and things to discover. Building on the foundations of the original and its incredible sequel, Shining Force III took the series into 3D, added new elements of lore and gave the two warring factions in the game real stakes. Then it filled the story with intrigue, betrayal and mystery. Sure, the translation from Japanese was a little ropey. But the whole thing worked.\n\nTeam Sonic / Camelot, who developed SFIII decided to split the game into three parts, and it was largely due to the fact that the Dreamcast was kicking off and the Saturn’s lack of popularity in the west, that only the first game made it to the USA and Europe. Scenario 1, as it turned out, was only one third of the game. I had played through it (no joke) over twenty times over the next couple of years. I was desperate to play Scenarios 2 and 3.

But what it is is the best JRPG for about 20 years. I've played through one of four story campaigns and loved every minute of it. Over the next few years, I'm sure I'll revisit it and get the other sides of the story.\n\nI love playing this game as Lucio. Providing a speed boost or a heal power to the people around me depending on the situation is one thing, but blasting opponents away and then loading on them with his standard rapid fire attack… it’s so much fun. Working as a team is crucial to Overwatch success. Each team usually needs at least one support character like Lucio, a bunch of heavy damage dealers, and some kind of defensive unit, like a tank character to take the brunt of the enemy assault. With those basics covered, it then becomes an act of coordination and skill to get the win.\n\nOverwatch is a bloody nightmare to play in Competitive mode. The community is toxic, very hostile towards new players and without any tolerance for variety in tactics or creative play. Avoid it like the plague. What you want is the fun version, where people are not so uptight and there for a good time. Quick Play. It’s the only way to play. Overwatch is one of my favourite FPS games, and certainly the one I go to for multiplayer fun. If you ever want a game, let me know!\n\nWhat can I say about Civilization that hasn’t been gushed from the words of countless nerds over the last few decades already? It’s the ultimate video game of a board game. Grow a nation from its stone age bare essentials right up through the ages and into the future, conquering the world, or achieving one of the other methods of victory, before the others.\n\nCivilization games usually take a dozen or more hours each, which means that it’s a pretty big ask to arrange one with friends. They usually require multiple sessions or long gaps in between games, but even then, it’s a load of fun. I spend most of my Civ 6 game time in single-player, happily taking a new faction through the eras of time, crushing enemies or seducing them with my valuable commodities or flat out lies.\n\nCivilization is addictive. It’s also not for everyone. Despite having a solid tutorial, there is a lot to take in and learn. It goes layers deep. There are certainly much more complex alternatives out there (No thanks, I’m grand! Crusader Kings, Stellaris etc., you’re all going too far!)\n\nCiv 6 was one of the first games I thought of when it came to making this list, and it’s one I’m sure I’ll keep playing for many years to come.\n\nPanzer Dragoon Saga is very possibly the best game nobody played. It’s one of the most beautiful game designs I’ve ever experienced. It also managed to achieve everything it did on the Sega Saturn in 1998. To think that Team Andromeda, who developed this title, never made a game together again fills my soul will sadness. This game deserves to be unearthed from the shadows of time. It’s too good to go on forgotten.\n\nIn PD Saga, you play as Edge, a wrong-place wrong-time mining contractor who ends up falling into a chasm, where he finds the impossible, a real-life dragon. As it turns out, his employer, Craymen, wasn’t interested in mining for resources at all, and was actually searching for the buried tomb of the mysterious Azel, a girl of unknown origin. Azel was foretold to be the key to discovering the last dragon, and as it turns out, the Empire got their prophecy wrong. There are actually two dragons. One is piloted by Azel, under the influence of Craymen. The other is you.\n\nAs the Empire come to conquer Edge’s homeland, he decides to use the dragon to defend it, and in turn chase down Craymen and get his revenge. All the while, Azel, atop her gargantuan dragon Atolm (which makes your dragon look like a hatchling by comparison) it hunting you down.\n\nOh, boy. Half-Life 2. It’s actually shocking to me that this game couldn’t find a place in the Top 10. That’s just how it goes, I guess.\n\nHalf-Life was a masterpiece on the PC. It felt like a video game could compete with smart science fiction TV and movies. It was designed and written as a narrative experience. It also had some of the best FPS gameplay ever. Then the sequel arrived and smashed it. Half-Life 2 is one of those generational games that comes along and completely rewrites the rules of what a game can be. The first thing that you notice in Half-Life 2 is the physics engine. Havok’s work with Valve to bring this game engine to life cannot be underestimated. Little things like picking up objects to move them about seemed like a little piece of polish on top when you’re first striding through the checkpoint in City 17. When you realise how important this feature will be later, it kinda blows your mind.\n\nThen of course, there’s the Gravity Gun. This is my favourite weapon in any game ever. The power to grab (almost) anything to you and then hurtle it at speed in any direction… It unlocked a plethora of possibilities and emergent opportunities within the game space. It also provided the designers at Valve with a type of level design tool that had never previously been possible.\n\nTrue to its origins, Half-Life 2 had a brilliant story, bringing back the mute Gordon Freeman as the protagonist. You team up with others along the way, most notably Alyx, a survivor of the Combine’s occupation, who is with you on your mission to take them down.\n\nMy absolute favourite moment in Half-Life 2 is when you find yourself in Ravenholm, a town district that has been turned upside down by the rampaging hordes of monsters that have been dragged through to our world from another dimension. Ravenholm is the land of sharp edges. Circular saw blades, arm-mounted swing-blades and other implements of decapitation are littered about the area, giving you all manner of ideas of how to use your Gravity Gun.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a must play game for just about anyone interested in games. The follow-up episodic chapters are also great, but the main game itself is where the best stuff happens. The possibility of a Half-Life 3 has been an internet meme for years, and the recently announced Alyx VR game seems like some kind of step towards it. I’m happy to dive into HL2 every few years regardless and remember that experience for the special thing it is each time.\n\nGTAV’s narrative is unapologetically obscene, once again portraying the game’s protagonists as the scum of the Earth, and justifiably so. Trevor, as a character, is a complete lunatic. There are some scenes in this game where I think they went too far with him, and the line on the edge of dark humour started getting crossed. That’s fine if you sign up for it, and with GTAV you know the stakes when you boot up the game. You’re agreeing to suspend your disbelief and do things no human being would ever do in the real world. That’s most of the fun of the game, at the end of the day. I think most players have saved their progress at one point, just to go off the rails and push their wanted level to extremes, causing murder and mayhem at every corner to taunt the police into asking the FBI for help, then the army… then everything at once to take you down.\n\nGrand Theft Auto, as a series, has been a critical and commercial blockbuster. It’s easy to see why. The freedom to act as you please is alluring, and the toy box filled with helicopters, airplanes, rocket launchers, tanks and all other kinds of boundary expanding vehicles gives you the opportunity to “do some mad shit” whenever you want. I love it as a cohesive campaign with optional rounds of madness. It seems that 110 million+ others feel the same way...\n\nThe Dreamcast had so many games that were blindingly original and massively under-appreciated. Jet Set Radio is about street graffiti gangs and pirate radio stations. Your role as a skater in this crew is to “tag” your art all over the town in place of rival tags, who will try to knock your ass out in retaliation.\n\nJet Set Radio came along a few years after the Tony Hawk craze was at its fullest, and I see it as Sega’s attempt to take that skate-score genre into a new direction. What they ended up with was way more than the sum of its parts. They were super smart with how they went about presenting this title. The gorgeous cel-shaded graphics were a pre-cursor to the style used by so many other games later. They offered the chance for players to create their own graffiti tags and use them in-game, which was a level of customisation unheard of in console gaming in the day. I wonder how many dicks people made on day one. The controls around tagging were also pretty fun, often using the rotation of the analog stick in a particular direction a certain number of degrees in a specified time, which felt curiously like you were holding the spray paint cans.\n\nInto the Breach is one of the tightest tactical games there is. If you want a puzzle to figure out and for every single move you make to matter, this is one of the most incredible games to offer that.\n\nThe whole game takes place on a small game board, with your three units placed strategically at the beginning, and a wave of enemies to defeat in order to advance to the next stage. Into the Breach is rogue-like, giving you only limited resources and with death meaning that you lose the entire campaign, leaving you back to square one (with the exception of the new squads you unlock throughout the game) to try to save the Earth all over again. The game’s loose narrative is wrapped around time-travel incursions, with everything rolling around the knowledge that the planet will be destroyed by invading aliens. It’s your job to get it right, and that will definitely be after you get it wrong over and over again initially.\n\nThis masterpiece will appeal most to strategy gamers and people who like board games. The difficulty curve can be punishing but it is also the kind of game that you learn to improve at as you play. Using combinations of different troop moves and boosting up units with special upgrades creates a huge number of possible ways to play each run through the campaign. Beating Into the Breach feels like you’ve tackled ten other games’ worth of completions, with all of the brain-burn you’ll use up doing it. Every minute is worth it.\n\nDuelyst’s charms are in its game mechanisms and how they blend so well together. Placing your units is done by paying for cards in your hand, which are drawn from a deck. They are placed relative to your Hero, who is both your best unit in battle and what your opponent needs to defeat in order to win. The game board is also very chess-like in size, but rather than being all about toppling a weak piece like the King, it’s a showdown between high-powered Queens.\n\nHere, the deck building is very streamlined and straightforward at first, and the developers are careful not to overburden you with too many options right off the bat. You can complete single player campaigns with various heroes to unlock more cards and even full decks to mix up your possibilities. When you have a style of play that you like, it becomes a bit like taking a main in a competitive fighting or shooting game and running with them in online play.\n\nI haven’t played Duelyst for a while now, mainly because it was becoming so addictive (at a time when I didn’t have the time to devote to it) that I had to make a clean break from it. Of all the games on this list, Duelyst is probably the one I wish I had the time to soak into it again. If you like card games, particularly CCGs, or board games in general, Duelyst is one of the best hybrid games you’ll ever play.\n\nThe year is 2006 and the game store doesn’t have a shopping bag big enough to cover the ridiculous plastic guitar I’ve just bought. I’m walking home with it under my arm, a mixture of slightly embarrassed and ridiculously excited. Guitar Hero 2 has come out and it has a bunch of songs I actually enjoy, plus it’s the first game in the series available on the Xbox 360.\n\nMoments after plugging the guitar controller into the console, I was already addicted. The game is absolutely not in any way reflective of musical ability, other than rhythm, and initially on the normal difficulty, it felt like you’re only playing a tiny section of the music that is playing before you and an entirely manageable number of buttons are required to hit. Meh.\n\nTurn Guitar Hero 2 up to Expert difficulty, and you’re finally playing the game. Normally I am as far from an elite gamer as you can get. I have no qualms about playing a game on Easy if it means I can actually experience it from start to finish. Guitar Hero 2 is different. To get the most out of it you have to be running your fingers ragged, laughing at the insanely difficult Through the Fire and Flames and hoping to one day survive it.\n\nThese games became hugely over-saturated on the market soon after and the bubble burst faster than the fad spread. For the brief time when Guitar Hero 2 was around, it was among the most fun pass-and-play gaming you could get.\n\nThe best mobile game series ever is The Room series. Hands down. Not only did this game come along and blow everything else away in the visuals, UX and interface areas at the time, it consistently iterated on its proven logic puzzle box formula and got it cleaner and smarter with each new title.\n\nThe premise of The Room is that you’re manipulating pieces of the titular room you find yourself in, unlocking and revealing new pieces that gives clues and tools to progress from section to section, unravelling the mysterious diary entries of the force responsible for placing you in this temporary prison, all the while forming a kind of Rube Goldberg machine that comes to ahead towards the end, with immensely satisfying results.\n\nIf you ever wanted to feel like a detective in a psychological horror setting (seek professional help) then this is one for you. It should be available on iOS and Android. You can also play them in any order without missing much.\n\nThe best Quake, in my opinion, is the only entry in the main series that had no single-player campaign. That’s kind of strange for me. I usually like a good story. I guess the substitute for that in Q3A was the level design. These maps were second to none.\n\nWhile most Q3A players probably played this one on PC, I didn’t have one that could run it, and played it religiously on Dreamcast in split-screen mode. Rocket-jumping your way from one section of the level to another was a novelty that proved essential to get right, and grasping a precious Quad Damage at the right time gave you one of the rarest of feelings in multiplayer gaming: the sense of absolute power. It was like nothing else in FPS gaming at the time.\n\nQuake 3 Arena’s railgun was my favourite thing about it. If you managed a solid long-range hit with the Railgun to your opponent’s head, it was because you earned it. Take your victories and your achievements unlocked, I’ll have that Railgun headshot any day.\n\nNiGHTS had wonderful boss stages, each of which involved using some version of your character’s standard skills but in a new way. Some required you to loop-the-loop around them, causing them to damage themselves, or grab and toss them through sections of the walls.\n\nOne other strangely compelling aspect of this game’s charm was the score ribbon. It was a limited time special power where NiGHTS would leave a bright yellow trail behind him as he flew, and you scored points based on the more intricate patterns and loops you could make while it was active. If ever there was a gaming version of yoga, or ice skating, it was NiGHTS into dreams…\n\nThere’s nothing like this game. It’s also very much an acquired taste, heavily grounded in the 1990s attitude of replaying levels over and over again to edge your best times and scores. There was a recent remaster for the Xbox 360 that did a fine job of capturing the spirit of the original, and if you feel like trying one of the weirdest games ever made, give this a shot.\n\nThe Talos Principle is like, the exact opposite of WarioWare. It’s a very thinky, involved and slow-paced puzzle game. You need your brain firing on all cylinders to even begin to get your wits about you in this game. Right from the off, when you start the first elegant puzzle thrown at you in Talos Principle, you realise that this is going to give you some serious brain-burn.\n\nOf all the video games I’ve ever played and completed, not one single game was as satisfying to finish as Talos Principle. Every meticulous detail that the designers went into to make these puzzles a joy to figure out was rewarded. Every time I found my way through an area, it felt like I was the absolute smartest person in the world. It almost made up for every attempt I ever made at playing a Real Time Strategy game.\n\nTalos Principle is probably the best Portal game not called Portal. That should tell you everything you need to know about it.\n\nAlright, Geometry Wars 2. Twin-stick shooters became a thing a few years ago, utilising the control scheme that one analog stick moved you around and the other was the direction you fired in. The original Geometry Wars (which was actually a hidden game inside Bizarre Creations’ PGR racing game, and not released on its own at first) was the pioneer of this genre. It was the best, hands down. A rogue-like, one shot-you’re-dead style rampage in a confined space with more enemies than you could ever count… It was glorious. Then the sequel came out.\n\nGeometry Wars is all about movement. You’re constantly at the brink of death. Enemies, large and small surround you and are magnetically attracted to flying right into you. One touch, you’re gone. Game over. And that’s incredible all by itself. The thing that elevates this game to new heights of genius is the black hole system. At timed intervals throughout your run, little circles will appear at specific points on the rectangular map. Usually they’re in the corners. As soon as you mis-fire and hit one (or, strategically shoot one on purpose, you crazy bastard!) these things ignite and start a swirling vortex of destruction, sucking in enemies and your ship with aggressive force. You must tackle this and use this to your advantage in different ways, depending on the enemies swarming you at any one time.\n\nAlso, you’d better watch out when there are more than one black hole igniting at once.\n\nGeometry Wars 2 is one of those perfect storms of a very simple core loop that was executed with lavish but minimalistic flare, and that hyper addictive “one more go” tendency. It’s a masterpiece.\n\nThis game caught me completely by surprise as a Humble Monthly title (I think?) that landed in my Steam library. Initially I thought it looked like some kind of cheap Minecraft rip-off, but oh man was I wrong. Get past the initial impression of the visuals and dig a little deeper. This game is incredible.\n\nThe whole concept of Infinifactory is that you are creating an automated machine unit that will complete its cycle of actions based on your inputs. These inputs are defined by the blocks you use and in what combination you line them up. The first bunch of puzzles are pretty easy, involving moving a crate from one place to another with a conveyor belt. It’s very satisfying when you get these right. You feel very smart.\n\nThen the game starts asking you to do multiple things at once, such as glue pieces together in a particular order, cut pieces into a certain shape, and do some while moving down a hill or over obstacles. It gets very tricky. Then you figure those puzzles out, and you feel like a goddamn genius.\n\nInfinifactory is absolutely brilliant. You can play it at your own pace, often mulling over puzzles for hours at a time, using trial and error or crazy concepts to achieve your goals and it becomes a joyful time sink from start to maddening-but-worth-it end.\n\nIf you played Vagrant Story on the PS1, well done. You’re probably the only person you know who has. I only heard about it because I had a friend who was a die-hard Square fan at the time, who was hyped for it (somehow!?) prior to release. This game was leagues ahead of the competition at the time in terms of narrative, and holds up pretty well today.\n\nVagrant Story is by the same development group that was responsible for Final Fantasy and it came out when that same cousin series was a global phenomenon, so missed out on the much deserved praise it should have gotten on release. This game is beautiful.\n\nMy favourite thing about Vagrant story is that the turn-based combat is reliant on your character’s skills in combat, down to the level of which part of the enemy you wish to target. Knock a guy’s arm with a blow and you’ll make certain attacks weaker. Target other areas for other effects, based on the attack type and the enemy itself. It’s a system that I haven’t seen used quite the same way since and made the battles seem a lot more dangerous than in other games.\n\nIf you have a few dozen hours to spare, consider getting a hold of Vagrant Story and experiencing it for yourself.\n\nThe thing most people remember about Braid is the ending. It’s divisive, but in my opinion, utterly brilliant. I don’t want to spoil it, even if the game is a decade old, so do yourself a favour and play this game right now and come back to me.\n\nYou’re back? Good. Wasn’t that a journey?\n\nBraid’s gameplay is multi-faceted and while the surface level is an apparently simple 2D platformer, it quickly begins to show its true colours. Puzzles that involve reversing time, using your own shadow as a teammate to do two-part puzzles… So much more…\n\nI’d rather not say too much more about Braid for fear of ruining one of the smartest puzzle games ever made. Jonathan Blow’s other game, The Witness, didn’t make the Top 100. That game is clever too, but very obtuse and while not bad, definitely not one of the best games I’ve ever played. Braid though, give that your time. It’s great.\n\nQUBE 2 is one of the most improved sequels to anything I’ve ever played. The first QUBE is immediately forgettable and pretty uninspiring. This game, on the other hand is a worthy distant cousin of Portal. It has the same snappy puzzle design and sci-fi gadgetry thing going on in spades.\n\nThe game has a long narrative exposition through it that loosely describes an alien planet and human colonisation. This does start to get interesting towards the end, but is very much just set dressing for what is ultimately an abstract puzzler. QUBE 2 does a lot of things with logic and spatial relations more so than timing, which is a nice change compared to some of the other first-person puzzle games. It also has a visual aesthetic that doesn’t stray too far from Portal’s established straight-line charms, but likes to add flourishes of nature and colour where rival games tended to stray from the beaten track.\n\nQUBE 2 went by fairly unnoticed on release, and I ended up finding it through a game pack of some kind and giving it a try. I was not disappointed. Check it out.\n\nShake it, baby! Duke Nukem 3D was the first FPS I played where you could look up and down. We take that as a given these days, but back in the 1990s, things tended to operate on two planes at most. Duke changed things up a lot.\n\nWhen 3D Realms dropped Duke Nukem 3D with an 18 age rating, it was pretty frustrating for the many goofy nerds who didn’t care about the strippers pole-dancing in bars or the bad language. We wanted to shoot the aliens that were flying around with jetpacks, or battle boss creatures on an American Football field with twin rocket launchers called Devastators.\n\nDuke 3D also had some great level design to go with its clever gameplay mechanisms. You weren’t just shooting guns, but equipping special items to help you navigate otherwise impossible locations, and every time you went through a portal, anything could happen.\n\nSure, this game looks awful today and can’t hold its own in a straight fight against more modern brethren, but if you were there when this game originally came out, the speed of the gameplay and the sheer scale of the levels was like nothing we’d ever seen.\n\nThe less said about Duke Nukem Forever, the better.\n\nI sunk a lot of time into Crazy Taxi on the Dreamcast. I remember it had a bunch of modes where you had a preset time limit, but they were for chumps. Arcade mode, where you started out with about 90 seconds, was where it was at. You could combo up cab fares in a way that you would extend that timer a little more each time you executed a perfect run, giving yourself more and more time to explore the city. This game had only two levels, but they were huge, and the appeal of playing Crazy Taxi for me was pushing that time limit further and further each time, just so I could get further from the start point than before.\n\nThe gameplay wasn’t anything like Euro Truck Simulator or other similar dry sim games. Crazy Taxi was rapid-paced and encouraged you to take ramps off the road, into the air and show your fare a fun time. It came with a soundtrack of pop-punk tracks that is forever ingrained in my mind. I loved this game, and its sequel, and if you ever end up in a holiday resort that has a dilapidated arcade scene, see if they have that eyesore-yellow upright arcade cabinet and give it a try.\n\nThis must be the section of the list where all the abstract puzzle games live. The Turing Test is another Portal-esque first-person puzzler, this time stuck in a space station with only a computer AI for company. Doesn’t that sound familiar? Don’t let the comparisons put you off. There’s a lot to like in this one.\n\nSome of the gameplay additions in The Turing Test feel so obvious and clever that it’s a wonder why Valve didn’t think of them back in the day. The whole thing with connectors and wires is one that immediately seems laborious, but how the team behind this game use them is amazing. Every multi-room puzzle you find yourself in feels like an escape room, because that’s essentially what you’re doing.\n\nThe story that drags its heels along behind you in The Turing Test is mostly filler, but it does add a sense of purpose as we find your way through the labyrinth of twisted scenarios before you. If you had any fun with Portal, this one will probably appeal to you too. I loved it.\n\nHope you like hordes of disease-ridden rats?\n\nDishonored is kind of unlike anything else out there. It’s a stealth game. It’s also a bit like you’re a wizard wearing a mask in an alternate industrial revolution era city. It’s also about shooting and stabbing things in creative and terrifying ways.\n\nFirst and foremost, Dishonored is a murder mystery, where you’ve been framed for the murder. You’re also discovering that the laws of physics are your plaything in many regards and that in order to unravel the mystery, that initial murder certainly will not be the last.\n\nI’m terrible at stealth in games. A good friend of mine watched me play a small portion of Dishonored at lunch-time in work and couldn’t stop laughing at how much of a bumbling buffoon I was, even when cast as the nimble-footed shadow character who almost can’t fail at staying out of sight. So for me, Dishonored may have ended up being more of an action-adventure than it will be for you. It’s feasible to play it that way (as I can attest to first hand!) but I’ve seen skilled players master levels without being seen and that was way more impressive that anything I could do myself behind the controls. I haven’t played the sequel, which I am assured is also excellent, and highly encourage you all to play them both.\n\nI just mentioned how bad I am at stealth in games. That is true. What is even more true, is how absolutely horrible I am at Real Time Strategy games. That is a big reason why you won’t see many on this list. I just can’t multitask that well.\n\nBack in my day, when this genre was being invented, RTS games were a lot less reliant on quick actions and clicking a million things really fast in hundreds of places. They were often a slow build up of hordes of units, resulting in a slow rumbling avalanche over the enemy base, resulting in a guaranteed victory for even the most incompetant RTS gamer (example: me.) That’s why my favourite RTS is the original Command & Conquer. I understand that this is perhaps objectively the worst game in the series to pick, and that even C&C: Red Alert might be a better pick, but something about this one, along with the fact that I could actually play it semi-coherently, just felt like a lot of fun to me.\n\nI loved the cheesy acting in the cut-scenes between levels. The soundtrack was amazing. The sound effects. The little tiny pixel men art.\n\nI also recall building a whole squad of flamethrower units, sending them off to attack a tank, and the guys at the back of my squad roasting the whole army in front of them alive. That was as hilarious as it was devastating. It’s also a pretty vivid look at my skills in this genre.\n\nFeel free to insert your favourite C&C, Starcraft or otherwise here. You definitely know better than I do in this regard.\n\nEight. That’s my favourite one. To be completely honest, I haven’t played that many Final Fantasy games through to the end. VII and VIII are the only ones, and I marginally prefer VIII. I like the characters of VII, like Cloud and Barrett, but FFVIII as a complete game was a more enjoyable experience for me. Squall with his gunblade, the weird setting, the story line, and in-game card game Triple Triad all bump this entry to the top in this series for me.\n\nI quite like the JRPG genre anyway and when FFVIII released, I was very deeply invested in a different epic RPG, so missed it originally. I went back to it ages later and really liked it. The familiar turns-based combat system I’d played in FFVII was there, slightly tweaked. The visuals were beautiful (at the time) and the soundtrack was incredible.\n\nI imagine everyone reading this is aware of Final Fantasy in its many forms, and each of you will surely have your own favourite. Let me know in the comments which is your favourite one and why!\n\nMobile gaming is my world. I work for a game studio that specialises in making mobile strategy games. The industry has taken a pretty huge upsurge in both popularity and quality over recent years, and my mainstay title in the free-to-play space for the longest time was Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes.\n\nThe game’s mechanisms are around turns-based combat between squads of familiar Star Wars characters. You start out with a bunch of no-namers and Chewbacca and slowly earn shards of all the characters you would expect from Star Wars, like Han Solo, Rey, Darth Vader etc. The game’s tight economy on both resources (getting upgrade items for your characters etc.) and energy (how many fights you can do per day) is generous enough to allow you to play for free or speed up your unlocks of characters with some small investments.\n\nThe real joy in this game is putting together a team of characters that works well together. My favourite team is a bunch of Jedi that focus on healing, mixed with a couple that do huge damage. The range of possibilities is pretty wide, and the game has added a lot of new content over the last couple of years. Where I stopped playing was when they introduced ship combat, which felt like a whole extra game added on and the time commitment was insane. I’ve gone back to play this a few times and have enjoyed it each time. It’s a great game to lose yourself in for a while and enjoy the synergies and character powers. There’s a Marvel themed clone of it as well, which is basically identical but with Iron Man and the crew instead of the Star Wars characters if that is more to your liking. Well worth a play, especially if you like long-term progression in your games, especially on-the-go.\n\nRobot dinosaurs vs. a girl with a bow and arrow. It’s the kind of elevator pitch I would expect my 3-year-old son to come up with. How Guerrilla Games managed to make one of the most emotionally captivating narratives in recent years out of that is testament to their incredible vision for this project.\n\nAside from the excellent story, and the endearing main character Aloy, Horizon hit so many beats with its progression of game mechanisms and slow ramp up of challenges that you wanted to keep playing constantly. The beautiful natural settings are breathtaking to behold, and then when populated with the mechanical monsters that are the heart of this game, things become mesmerising to watch.\n\nAloy’s AR headset that allows her to track the patrol patterns of the robo-dinosaurs is a cool little game gimmick way of explaining and incorporating the game’s UI into the lore, and coupled with the surprise origins of her character and how civilization got this this state, really tie the world building together nicely. Horizon’s combat is satisfying every time you sneak about and take down a robo-raptor or climb atop a larger target and rip its circuits out. Traps are great fun to place and lure your targets towards. Aloy’s skillset grows as you progress, with each enhancement feeling useful as the game throws curveball challenges at you, reinventing itself as it goes. There are a few more open-world games ahead of Horizon on this list (and many of them are much further up) but I was genuinely surprised and delighted by this game and consider it one of the best PS4 exclusives.\n\nStreets of Rage was bundled on the same cartridge as Golden Axe and Revenge of Shinobi on the Sega MegaDrive (or Genesis to my American friends) and was by far the most-played of the three games for me. Ask any fan of Streets of Rage which one is the best, and most will probably say the second one, but the sheer number of hours I put in to the first one makes me remember it more fondly.\n\nThis game is as simple as it gets. Walk from the left side of the screen to the right, punching and kicking the living snot out of anything in your way, and get to the end of the stage. Repeat.\n\nEach level brings with it a bunch of unique enemies types to figure out, and the most exciting part: a police car special power (that you can only use once) that fires some kind of massive missile, barrage of hundreds of bullets, or a massively flamethrower at your enemies, killing everything on screen, except you, of course. Much like the Eagles in Lord of the Rings, I often wonder why Axel, Blaze and Adam weren’t just driving that squad car through the levels, removing all chance of their own mortal peril.\n\nStreets of Rage is still a bit of fun today, best played as a two-player game, and had something that a lot of cooperative games of the time didn’t have: you could hurt your friends by accident. “Accidents” happened fairly regularly for me and my brother as we threw knives and launched huge diving kicks across the screen, often leading to a brawl between us rather than the thugs of whatever city the game was set in.\n\nDark Souls is difficult. Ikaruga is insane. You pilot a ship in a traditional top-down style shooter, but with the incredible design twist of colour shifting thrown in on top. If you are orientated as the white side of your ship, you’re immune to white projectiles. If you are black, you’re immune to black. At first, this is very simple as enemies only fire one colour bullet at you, but things get absolutely crazy once the screen fills with enemies and the firing patterns start to resemble geometric works of art that are almost a shame to disrupt as you blast the enemies away.\n\nIkaruga was a Dreamcast game originally, but only available in Japan (I think!) but revered as one of the best shooters ever made. It dropped on Xbox Live Arcade for the X360 about ten years ago and did not disappoint. Most of my time with Ikaruga was in 2-player mode, trying desperately to get to the end. I’m not ashamed to admit that I never completed the game with a standard number of continues. It was only possible for me once we unlocked infinite continues at some point. This game is tough.\n\nI’m not sure what it is about the two-colour system that makes Ikaruga so much more fun to play than other games in the genre, but it just works. It’s by far and away my favourite game of this type and one that I challenge any of you losers to beat one day.\n\nYou can take your pick of the Advance Wars titles and sub it in here. They’re all quite similar and all very, very good. The original is my favourite, mainly for its elegant simplicity. You control an army of troops of various types and square off against an opposing force for control of the map, taking strategic positions that give you more resources to deploy extra units and hopefully, win the war.\n\nWhat I like about this game is the whole board-gamey-ness of it. It feels like a computerised version of a tactical strategy board game. Everything is about positioning pieces, managing your resources and striking at the opportune moments.\n\nThere have been a lot of variations on this formula, but Advance Wars is one of the best. A recent game called Wargroove feels very like AW in a lot of ways and would also be a great stand-in today if you can’t get hold of a Game Boy Advance.\n\nIntelligent Systems, the team behind this game, will be appearing again, much, much higher on this list.\n\nBomberman was a huge hit in the early 90s, primarily on the SNES with Super Bomberman. The superior and therefore best game in the series is the Sega Saturn version, imaginatively named, Saturn Bomberman. For anyone too young to know what Bomberman is, the game is a real-time action puzzler, where you time the placement of bombs in a grid map, destroying walls and hopefully, your opponents before they do to you.\n\nWhat made the Saturn version so good was that it improved every single aspect of the series and bundled it all into one game. The controls were sharper, and with accuracy so key to success in this game, that was huge. The single player campaign was beautifully designed, levels-wise and thematically. The different coloured dinosaurs had special abilities that all felt unique and useful. The multiplayer had the best levels in the series, improved on things like the conveyor belts, and added up to 10-player simultaneous play. This required 10 controllers and two multi-tap adaptors, so it was very rare to ever even see that many Saturn peripherals in one place, but it ran incredibly well and was great fun.\n\nYou can pretty easily find a bunch of Bomberman games these days, but since Saturn Bomberman, they’ve all been a step back in quality. Mega Bomberman and Super Bomberman are the closest you’ll find to a decent alternative, but the Saturn version is incredible and well worth tracking down on an emulator (or the console itself if you can find one.) A classic.\n\nBananas! The original Donkey Kong (not on this list!) is very different to this amazing SNES platformer that came many years later. Donkey Kong Country, at the time, was visually the most impressive video game in the world. What Rare achieved with the SNES still boggles the mind.\n\nDonkey Kong Country was so good because it knew how to have fun. The addition of a tag-along sidekick, Diddy Kong, was the first major design decision that made this game feel fresh and exciting. Rather than die as soon as an enemy hit you, Diddy Kong would take the hit, leaving you to fight another day. DK himself was only really good for jumping and pounding along, hopping into barrels and launching himself across the screen. The true masterpiece of design in DK Country was the level design itself. Hidden areas loaded with precious bananas were one thing, but introducing mine carts and other tricks were immensely exciting at the time.\n\nDKC had a few really tough levels along the way too, with precision timing and complex jumps often leading to frustration, but with enough care and patience, every advancement felt momentous.\n\nThis game has spawned a whole load of fantastic sequels. Right now, if I was to pick one to recommend you play, other than the original, I’d say give Tropical Freeze a go. It’s readily available on the Switch and is a lot of fun.\n\nNintendo are the masters of turning a beloved franchise of yesteryear into a revolutionary 3D masterpiece years later. They did it with Super Mario (we’ll get to him later) with possibly the biggest splash of technological-leaping in video game history in Super Mario 64, and on the Gamecube they unleashed the jaw-dropping Metroid Prime.\n\nWhen this game landed in 2002, it truly felt like Nintendo could do no wrong. They took something that was iconic, adored and genre defining (ever hear of the Metroid-vania genre?) and turned it completely on its head, took it into 3D - and here’s the crazy part - improved it in almost every way.\n\nIn 2002 Samus was a joy to control on Gamecube. Looking back on it today, the control scheme hasn’t aged terribly well, with some adjustment needed for those of us spoiled by the precision afforded to us by the modern FPS titles. Once you get used to it, and start to unlock some of the cool “ball” abilities, Metroid Prime becomes a work of art to get lost within. The boss battles were cripplingly hard at times, and the only knock I have on this game, but I remember locking myself away with this game for weeks on end, and feeling that its Game of the Year status was wholly justified. I’m in two minds about whether or not this is a great one to recommend to people to play fresh today. Playing Metroid Prime Trilogy may be the way to go about it now. Or see if Metroid Prime 4 ever makes its appearance and go from there...\n\nHello, fellow nerds. This is my Top 100 Video Games.\n\nPreviously, I listed some honourable mentions that just missed this list. If you haven’t checked that out, I’d suggest you start there. I give my reasons for compiling this list there, and hope to infuriate some of you by picking your favourite games for the almost-made-it pile. The Deus Ex mention has already sparked a few interesting messages…\n\nThere’s one stipulation regarding the list that I want to point out. Only one game from each series made the list. I didn’t want the whole list being comprised of the same games over and over again, so for example, only one Halo or Half-Life or Mario Kart etc. made it in. It makes for more variety and a better overall list. Whenever a series has a whole host of excellent title, I drop the names in there too where it feels right.\n\nAlso - there are some games from this last year or two that I have either not played or not played enough of yet to qualify, such as The Outer Wilds (the cool time-loop exploration game, not the Obsidian RPG) God of War, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Control and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. So they won’t be showing up here, sadly.\n\nAnother thing that should hopefully go without saying: I haven’t included any games that I myself have designed or worked on. Star Trek: Fleet Command and anything by Popcap is basically excluded as a result. Please go and play all of those :)\n\nEnough rules. Let’s get to the best games...\n\nOvercooked is a party game for up to 4 players. Ideally you will want the full 4, and preferably with local play and lots of communication. The Nintendo Switch version is where I get most of my use out of this one. The premise is simple: you run a restaurant or kitchen, and you have orders to fulfill. Usually there is some absurd situation like that it’s on a tall ship traversing rough seas, or is on two trucks that are driving at different speeds. Things are chaotic, everything is moving, not least of all your characters, as you scramble to find the right ingredients, prepare them, cook them, mix them together, serve them, clean up and avoid the whole place going on fire at the same time.\n\nOvercooked creates a flow state as you play, often providing a sense of telepathy between players as they do everything they can to cooperate and succeed before the timer reaches zero. Often players will naturally fall into roles, such as “plates guy” or “chopper” who ends up coordinating a section of the production line. As orders come in and get gradually more complex, it becomes a game of managing your character but also what you say to one another.\n\nOften the best part of Overcooked is when something goes terribly wrong. Trying to juggle too many pots of soup at once, for example, might lead to a fire, a fire extinguisher mishap, or just absolute chaos. Sometimes you’ll laugh the most when that carefully prepared dish is placed straight into the garbage instead of onto the counter for the waiters to deliver. All of this is done through a control stick and two buttons, of which the context adjusts based on what you’re facing. This beautiful user experience decision is what took a potentially over-complicated game and simplified it to its base level and allows anyone (and I mean anyone) to participate in the gameplay.\n\nOvercooked’s difficulty ramps up pretty high later on, but it’s never impossible. You may also find yourself shouting at your friends as much as you are shouting to them, but that’s all part of this little monster’s charms.\n\nThis game is pretty old now, and you’d be forgiven for asking me why it took a spot on the list while newer games like Planet Coaster didn’t, and the answer is that Theme Park is actually still pretty fun to play, even now.\n\nAs the owner of the titular Theme Park, you get to create a land of joy and wonder for patrons to visit, or if you’re like most players, a horrific nightmare zone of endless walkways for people to get lost in, or a literal prison where people must get on the rollercoaster because the path to the exit no longer exists.\n\nIf you want to play Theme Park properly, there are things like food stalls, waste management, hiring staff and managing the bills to contend with, and that is a satisfying distraction for a while. Ultimately, Theme Park is pretty easy to manage and won’t challenge you if you’re a gamer who likes more complex strategy games. But if you’re creative, you can make something for yourself that is almost zen-like, but with the occasional vomit bucket clean up for your janitor staff to worry about later.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, this is one that you have to try. I originally found Mini Metro on PC, but have since downloaded the mobile version and I th"
