        "text": "Hammerhead Production information Manufacturer Manufacturing Plant SFF-IT1[1] Production Year 3146 Model Standard Class Medium Cost 7,927,440 C-bills Technical specifications 'Mech type Clan BattleMech Mass 45 tons Chassis SFAM endo steel Armor Double-Forged ZX20 Hardened Engine Firebox 270 XL Communications System Comset 1 Targeting Tracking System Dtrac Suite 4 Heat Sinks 10 double Speed 86.4 km/h Armament\n\n1x Large pulse laser\n\n1x ER medium laser\n\n1x Streak SRM-6\n\nBV (1.0) N/A BV (2.0) 1,686\n\nDescription[edit]\n\nThe Hammerhead is a medium Clan BattleMech designed as a skirmisher by Clan Sea Fox. Designed to loosely resemble a hammerhead shark, the design is intended to be aggressive with its opponents, yet also built around the concept of never getting knocked off its feet. Despite its merely adequate weapons array, the Hammerhead has achieved great success as a shock trooper, wading though enemy formations to brawl with opponents twice its size at close range.[1] [2]\n\nBecoming somewhat of a signature 'Mech for Clan Sea Fox and its touman in amazingly quick fashion, the Hammerhead is also sold and exported to any interested Clan buyers,[2] with Clan Ghost Bear greatly enamored of its strength and unyielding qualities. The escalating conflict between Clans Jade Falcon and Wolf in the lead-up to the ilClan era would result in heavy orders from both sides as they faced the opposing Hammerhead in increasing numbers.[1]\n\nThe only issue of note with the Hammerhead is complaints from nonâ€“Sea Fox MechWarriors of occasional glitches in various systems in exported production models. The Sea Foxes attribute this to the divergent and conflicting software requirements of so many different buyers and the problems are minor enough not to have significantly impacted sales of the 'Mech.[1]\n\nWeapons and Equipment[edit]\n\nIntended for close-in combat, the Hammerhead has 15 tons of hardened armor to help resist damage. Unlike most Clan Mechs, this one is intended to allow inexperienced pilots to survive their first engagements and learn from the experience. With the assistance of leg-mounted actuator enhancement systems, the 'Mech's heavy armor helps its pilot keep the 'Mech standing, further assisting newer MechWarriors.[1][2]\n\nNot heavily armed, the Mech's arsenal consists of medium and close range weapons. The main gun is a Series 44h large pulse laser, while a Series 2b ER medium laser and Type VI Streak SRM-6 allow the Mech to handle an opponent once the Hammerhead closes in to short range.[1][2]\n\nThe 'Mech is built on a SFAM endo steel skeleton and is powered by a Firebox 270 XL extralight engine, which gives the it enough power to support the weight of its hardened armor and still move at a top speed of 86.4 km/h.[1][2]\n\nDesign Quirks[edit]\n\nThe Hammerhead is subject to the following Design Quirk:\n\nBattlefists\n\nRelated BattleMechs[edit]\n\nAmarok - This 100-ton Clan Wolf assault 'Mech was inspired by the Hammerhead's hulking arms, so closely, in fact, that the Sea Foxes waged a series of ultimately unsuccessful Trials over design element theft.[1]\n\nGallery[edit]\n\nHammerhead from RG:ilClan v5\n\nPetr Kalasa's Hammerhead Akitla from BT:Legends\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nBibliography[edit]"
