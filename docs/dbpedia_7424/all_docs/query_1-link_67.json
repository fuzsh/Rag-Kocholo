        "text": "A dramatic-looking shark holds its breath for about 17 minutes to stay warm during hunting dives in cold water, scientists have found.\n\nScalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) are found in warm, near-surface ocean waters around the world, particularly coastlines, and can reach up to around a dozen feet in length. But these sharks do venture into deep, chilly water to hunt. That’s potentially problematic because scalloped hammerheads, like most sharks, are cold-blooded, which means their body temperature matches that of their immediate environment. “When you go into cold water, if your body cools down, you can’t hunt as effectively,” says Mark Royer, a shark biologist at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology. “In order to be an effective hunter, it’s important to keep yourself warm as much as possible.”\n\nSome fish such as bluefin tuna, great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and swordfish have special muscles and blood vessels that allow them to keep their brain, eyes and swimming muscles warm even in cold waters—but scalloped hammerheads don’t. Yet as Royer and his colleagues analyzed 106 deep dives made by six individual scalloped hammerhead sharks, they saw that the animals stayed mysteriously warm long into these excursions, according to sensors that recorded the sharks’ muscle temperatures, orientations, and diving depths and the ambient temperatures of the water around them.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

There’s something much more complex.”\n\nThe researchers found that the sharks were making steep, fast descents to spend a few minutes feasting in deep waters, then speeding most of the way back to the surface. The animals stayed warm until the point where their ascent slowed—on average, 17 minutes, Royer says. The team’s findings were published on May 11 in Science.\n\nThe researchers think the mystery lies in the sharks’ gills. These organs act as lungs, pulling oxygen from seawater. But gills come with a downside because vast quantities of water pass through them. “Gills are like giant radiators strapped to your head,” Royer says. “Whenever a shark or a fish goes into colder water, it’s going to very quickly lose its body heat through its gills because the gills have all that large surface area.”\n\nThe team couldn’t monitor the sharks’ gills directly, although Royer says that in the future, he’d like to equip sharks with pectoral-fin cameras pointing toward the gills. But for now, the scientists think that the sharks are closing their gills—holding their breath, essentially—during their daring dives. (Royer notes that other researchers have footage of one scalloped hammerhead diving with its gills shut.)\n\n“It’s definitely something that hasn’t, as far as I know, been put forward for an ectothermal [cold-blooded] fish yet that I think is going to create really cool avenues for future research,” says Ashley Stoehr, a marine biologist at Sacred Heart University, who specializes in fishes and wasn’t involved in the new research."
