        "text": "In South Lombok (Belongas Bay area) we are extremely fortunate to have incredible hammerhead sightings – in fact we are the pioneers of diving in this area and would love for you to join us for adrenaline pumping hammerhead dives in South Lombok!!\n\nBut how much do you know about this distinctive looking species of shark? Did you know that there are different types of hammerheads? Did you know that in Lombok we see two different species?\n\nAt the iconic dive site called The Magent we see both Great Hammerheads and Scalloped Hammerheads.\n\nUsually our sightings of Great Hammerheads are around the 35 meters depth and they tend to be individual sightings or small groups of the 3 to 5 individuals\n\nThe schooling hammerheads that we see are actually the Scalloped Hammerhead species, and we see them at shallower depths on the open ocean side of the site. These incredible schools are a phenomenal highlight of diving in this unique area.\n\nIf you want to know more about the schooling Scalloped Hammerheads of South Lombok then read on!\n\nBig Fish Special Offer\n\nAre you intending to travel this year? To celebrate these Big Fish diving we have two Big Fish Discounts – add on a second location and get a 10% diving discount AND get a 10% discount on our PADI Advanced Open Water courses!! Click here for full offer details.\n\nThe Schooling Scalloped Hammerheads\n\nThe Scalloped Hammerhead is also known as the ‘Bronze Hammerhead’ and the ‘Kidney Headed Shark’,\n\nScalloped hammerheads are relatively easy to distinguish from other hammerhead shark species by virtue of the central indentation on the front margin of their broad heads.\n\nScalloped hammerheads range in colour from brownish grey to bronze on top with pale white or yellowy undersides and juveniles have dark second dorsal and pectoral fins.\n\nFully mature males reach up to around 1.8 meters and females can be up to 2.5 meters. Yes – the females are larger than the males!\n\nThe scalloped hammerhead is a semi oceanic species of shark which is commonly found around insular shelves which are adjacent to deep waters. The Magnet is actually a feeding ground for these hammerheads due to the seasonal schools of mobula rays which provide make easy prey for them in large numbers.\n\nBy day they tend to stay closer to shore whilst at night they head further offshore in search of prey – they have been seen from the surface down to depths of up to 275 meters!\n\nAdults are seen individually, in pairs and in small schools but young scalloped hammerheads live in large schools, new borns and infants live in coastal nurseries. For this reason we believe that the Magnet could also be a nursery area.\n\nThe scalloped hammerheads diet is extremely varied and includes reef fish such as parrot fishes, surgeons, wrasses and damsel fish, pelagics such as barracuda, Spanish mackerel, other sharks and rays such as black tip reef sharks and sting rays and they are also known to feed on invertebrates including squid, octopus, shrimps, crabs and lobsters.\n\nFemale scalloped hammerheads move inshore to shallow water to pup and they give birth to live young following a 9 – 10 month gestation period. Litters are large and can range from 12 – 38 pups which are just 15 to 18 inches long at birth. After pupping females leave the young and return to deeper water.\n\nHammerhead pups living in coastal nurseries are extremely vulnerable to fishing, pollution, habitat destruction and they are prey to other larger shark species. As mature adults the scalloped hammerhead has no major predators. Despite having large litters though only a small proportion of the pups will reach sexual maturity but for those that do, life expectancy is estimated at 30 years plus.\n\nThe IUCN has listed the scalloped hammerhead as ‘near threatened’ and globally its numbers are in decline. Both game fishing and commercial fishing have had an impact on the species and they are also vulnerable to long lines, trawls and they are often by-catch in drift net fishing. As with all shark species today they are sadly also caught for their fins for the black market shark fin industry. We are extremely fortunate to have such a thriving and healthy population visiting us year after year!\n\nPlease note that the best time to dive with hammerheads in South Lombok is from end-June until end-Oct.\n\nDo you want more information about Belongas Bay in South Lombok?
