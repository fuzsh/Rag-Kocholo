        "text": "Background\n\nIrem (also known as Irem Software Engineering) is a video game developing corporation founded in 1974 that published arcade games. It was acquired by Eizo in 1980 and began developing video games in 1997 when its former parent company, Irem Software Engineering, moved to making coin-operated slot machine games. It was famous for game series like the R-Type series, as well as other games including Moon Patrol and Kung Fu Master. However, the 2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan disrupted the company's work flow, and as a result, numerous video game projects were axed and the company moved to slot machine and coin-operated games. Some of the company staff, including producer Kazuma Kojo, left the corporation to found a new video game corporation, Granzella.\n\n1st Logo (April 28, 1989-October 12, 2000)\n\nVisuals: On a white or black background, there is the text \"irem\" in a blocky font, with the dot on the \"i\" colored blue.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere are several custom variants.\n\nSometimes, \"IREM CORPORATION\" is below.\n\nTechnique: A still digital graphic.\n\nAudio: None or the opening theme of the game.\n\nAvailability: Seen on any Irem game from the era. [Examples?]\n\n2nd Logo (September 21, 2000)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, there is the Irem logo off-center. Everything except the blue box blurs out and turns into a floating and spinning cube with some sparkles, which later shatters into gold cubes. The cubes fly away into a white light, which expands and clears the screen.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A dreamy theme.\n\nAvailability: Seen only on Carton-kun for PlayStation.\n\n3rd Logo (May 10, 2001-February 7, 2013)\n\nVisuals: On a white or black background is the text \"irem\", with the dot on the \"i\" colored blue. The \"r\" has a jumbly effect.\n\nTechnique: A still digital graphic.\n\nAudio: None or the opening theme of the game."
