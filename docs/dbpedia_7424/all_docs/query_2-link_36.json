        "text": "Good day all,\n\nI have a noob question I am trying to get my head around to understand and hope you all can support.\n\nI keep seeing speed level design/scene design being made in Blender/Maya etc online and also in game engines.\n\nWhen it is in game engines, they basically put all assets and place them in the scene. The assets are all made in the 3d engine and imported in. I know how to do all this and have assets and going to move to a 3d game engine soon however my question is this…\n\nWhy dont i just make my level/scene fully in blender and then export it fully over to the game engine? Blender can hold large scenes in blender anyway and i see that you can export a level from a game engine to blender in full anyway (example is synty studio maps).\n\nWhy are designers creating the assets in a 3d model programme and then modular them, only to export them all and put them back in a game engine. Isnt that wasting time? Why not just create it all in the 3d programme then export it all to the game engine to then move onto the next steps that the game engine does.\n\nI am trying to get the answer and cant seem to find it online and just see speed level videos in both the 3d programme and the game engine, but the game engine they import the assets.\n\nI hope this question makes sense?\n\nSecond question what takes more memory…a Brush made in the game engine, example a floor tile or a brush made in the 3d engine as example a floor tile. I am trying to save on work flow and be good to know if i make the floor/walls in the 3d engine or the 3d programme and what is better optimisation.\n\nKind regards\n\nAdam\n\nOne word:\n\nModularity.\n\nIf you wanna change something ( for example the rotation or size of a single tree ) you have to go back to the 3D app…\n\nAlso the modellers are often not the level designer… there are in fact level optimizer who add details to the scene to hide problematic areas and even modfiy the blockout for a beter game play…\n\nOften this is also an intertive process and changes in the game engine editor are by far simpler handled as in blender… also because you instantly can check the game experience (expect if you use one of the blender game engine derivates…).\n\nSomeone experienced enough might not need this… but you know… most of the geniuses in this world… are simple overestimating their capabilities…\n\nBrush…\n\nYou may have to elaborate this to get a more suited answer.\n\nAs far as this means “texture image”… doesn’t matter ?\n\nHi,\n\nBut you can still edit it in the game engine. Creators could create the level in the 3d editor, then export it as already laid out into the game engine, then after testing it they can move around the assets, as the models will still be separated anyway.\n\nI am confused why creators aren’t making it in the 3d engine like a street with a building/path/road and assets around it for detail in the 3d editor, then exporting it as a whole to the game engine, still seperated models but scene and assets already pre placed, then in the editor they can of course still edit and move around. Wouldnt this save on workflow? I see speed level designs being made in both blender in full and in a game engine but the game engine imports in all the assets. That is my question I am trying to understand.\n\nIn regards to my other question. In a game engine you can create a plane/cube and make into a wall/floor etc. Is it better to bring in the floor/wall from the 3d programme or create in game engine. Are they the same in terms of optimisation or better to bring it in from 3d programme.\n\nAlso all, to be clear with my question…\n\nI don’t mean it would be one model. It would still be many different objects and for a solo developer, indie dev. So I’m creating a game on my own. I might eventually of course need people to support here and there to hire on some parts of course. So what is the difference of me creating my level in blender. There will be many different objects, then I export them all together in place on the 3d programme like a town for example into unity and then in unity I do the game design part. (Scripting, atmosphere, lighting etc etc).\n\nI keep seeing people creating levels in unity and unreal but they are exporting it all from a 3d programme like maya or blender etc etc. Why are they not making it all in the 3d programme then exporting it all together when done? What is the benefit of having to create a wall, door, floor in blender then exporting it to just have to put them back together again, when they could have them (separate models still) placed all in the 3d model programme…then when they have created the town in the 3d model programme, then move them over to the game engine instead of having to then re do it again in the game engine with repositioning them again…as in the 3d programme they can edit the model right there with detail and change if they want with positioning, editng of model etc etc\n\nHi,\n\nI am listening and apologies i forgot a question mark. I know i can do what i want but im seeking answers from professionals on here to ask the Why? Why is it that solo devs or small teams not create all the assets and a level in the 3d programme together as a scene, then highlight them all and then export them over to the game engine as an already created scene? I am sure there is a rational and experienced answer to this. I’m learning so be good to know the best workflow.\n\nI see speed designs of whole scenes done in blender and in unity/unreal. Only difference is I see unreal and unity they are making in blender or maya then exporting all assets over and having to re position them. Where in blender they are moved around and placed all ready and edited in the same 3d editor. So im simply asking why not create it all, move and edit it all in the 3d programme to then export it all over when ready, then in the game engine do the game engine part?\n\nI am sure there is an answer as of course i believe all do it the game engine way for a reason…i just want to know that answer or if anyone has thought of that question.\n\nThanks for feedback also.\n\nSometimes in life there are just no answers… mostly because of the context… so the “standard answer”: it depends does fit most of the time…\n\nThey do it because:\n\ndo not know better\n\nnever thought of it\n\nare better used to the game engine editor than any 3D app\n\nwatched only one tutorial\n\nthink that it better, smarter or whatever (and for whatever reason)\n\nSo… just because some people do something like they do it doesn’t mean it’s the best way for any other project…\n\n…this said: on the other hand it may be useful to a certain extend…\n\n…but… it depends… one multipe things…\n\nOne reason might be the modularity i mentioned… or experience in this or that tool… or any feature of one. Sso all in all this was the foundation why i said you question is futile ( ← maybe this came across wrongly… maybe because i’m no english native speaker… IDK )…\n\nYou may also have look at this thread (or some similar…)\n\nThanks alot and apologies. All is good. Thanks for your answer and by no means do i mean to annoy or anything.\n\nIm creating a game and i have my character model. From there i want to create my game. In the past i have experience in Hammer, quadrant (medal of honour and half life) game engines. Then i realised that now i am doing modelling and creating the buildings, props floors, roads etc all in the 3d programme like all designers do…why dont i just set it all up blender, then when i have it how i want, then export them all over (all individual models of course). You can animate in blender also of course and basically do it all…so when i export it, then i can work on the scripting, lighting, atmosphere in the game engine. Just wondered if it would be faster workflow instead of going back and forth from engine to engine. Wondered why so many dont do it this way and there must be a reason for it that im not getting and i am being a Noob about.\n\nIll check out the thread you linked. Thanks very much for your answers. I completely get your thoughts.\n\nIn a team setting, it’s because the job of the modeler and the job of the level designer are not one and the same- as a solo dev, they can be, you can do whatever in Blender or a game engine, but in a team setting, the level designer does no modeling. They just arrange the models someone else made in the game engine. Why? Because the game engine has the mechanics of the game- a level is not just about aesthetics, it needs to be playable. You can’t do play testing in Blender. You can’t interact with your models like the player will, so all you can do is hope it’s functional and fun. By having a separation, the modeler doesn’t have to worry about that- they just model and let the level designer worry about it.\n\nLevel design is so much more than just arranging assets. It’s a highly challenging field where you have to balance a huge range of skill issues with fun and functionality, you have to get the difficulty perfect without being too hard or to easy, you have to make it fun while still making it pretty, you have to anticipate every possible player interaction and plan ahead for that. It’s a highly complex science. Trained level designers don’t have time to worry about modeling.\n\nIt’s not at all dissimilar to how in most agency settings, one person (a graphic designer) designs a mock-up of a website for a client and then a developer actually makes the site. The developer absolutely could design it themselves, but it’s not an efficient use of resources. By having the designer focus on getting client approval, the developer can focus on making it happen.\n\nIt boils down to the fact that Game Engines are not geared towards modeling ( BGE the exception)…they have but rudimentary functions like adding basic geometric shapes… so Modeling needs to be in External software…they do on the other hand are great in the creation of landscapes, and utilizing assets imported into them. There are great functions like simulations that outshine Blender physics and sims, but you can not import a complete scene if things require physics they tend to work better on the assets. That does not mean you couldn’t model a complete scene in Blender and then import that as a group of assets into the Game engine. In the studio therefore the process is broken down to the individual level which has specialties such as Textureing, Rigging, asset creation, character creation, etc. One person would be hard-pressed to do all the needed work and do it well and in a timely fashion, compared to a team that each takes a given part and works solely on that part, and then the assets are joined into a completed game.\n\nModular assets save a huge amount of time when changes are needed, even a complete character overhaul that does not affect the rest of the assets and can continue to be worked on in the Game.\n\nThere is no difference in asset creation and exporting full scenes but there is time wasted if not carefully thought out as you would not want to create a complete forest as a scene and have many duplicates that would be exported when a set of tree assets would be more efficient.\n\nThere are always exceptions and differing views on the individual level, but not at the industry level where there is a set of procedures that are always followed in a team environment."
