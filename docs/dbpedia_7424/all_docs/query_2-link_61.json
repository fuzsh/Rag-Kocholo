I don't understand how everything works and where ever i go(in forums) to ask and understand, more and more programs, languages,developers kits, OpenGL, Visual Studios, things like compiling, debugging, IDE are being mentioned and i start looking for them,but even more are mentioned. It's like an endless cycle trying to learn what everything is and where is it used and it's driving me insane!Well no, but after i graduate i would like to go to college to learn advanced programming and i am pretty sure that requires knowing C++ on a much higher level than mine as well as other diverse technologies.Well no, but after i graduate i would like to go to college to learn advanced programming and i am pretty sure that requires knowing C++ on a much higher level than mine as well as other diverse technologiesIf you need to know anything at the time you're sitting down for your very first class, it's probably a bad school.Yes, but if let's say they mention for example \"loops\" i should know or at least have and idea what that is right?"
