        "text": "David Neumann\n\nUnited States\n\nWhitefish Bay\n\nWisconsin\n\nIn life you have to do a lot of things you don't f*cking want to do. Many times, that's what the f*ck life is... one vile f*cking task after another.\n\nApp News\n\nWarning: This post is painfully bereft of 7 Wonders news, which makes 65 days since the beta was announced. Just thought I'd help you out.\n\nEisenhorn: Xenos Gets a Trailer\n\nFor those of you familiar with the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Eisenhorn and the Imperial Inquisition might not be completely unfamiliar terms for you. For the rest of us, it's like trying to read Etruscan. Apparently the Inquisition--which nobody expects--is a secret organization that tries to root out baddies in the Warhammer universe. So, they're kind of like Warhammer's answer to Mystery, Inc. Eisenhorn happens to be an Inquisitor, and Eisenhorn: Xenos happens to be about him.\n\nUnlike all the Warhammer games on mobile that I can think of, Eisenhorn is a third-person action game, similar to the Batman: Arkham games from Rocksteady Studios. Today, developer Pixel Hero Games released the first trailer for Eisenhorn and it looks really, really good.\n\nWe shouldn't have long to wait until we can see for ourselves. Eisenhorn: Xenos is planned for a 2015 release on both iOS and Android.\n\nSolitairica Coming to iOS in Early 2016\n\nOne of my favorite, and most played, games of 2015 is the solitaire-like dungeon crawler, Card Crawl. Something about cards being abstracted into a dungeon crawl trips my trigger, so to speak. Lucky for me (us?) we have another solitaire dungeon crawler on the way, this one from an ex-PopCap Games art director, Clint Jorgenson and his new company, Righteous Hammer Games.\n\nSolitairica uses a more traditional solitaire layout than Card Crawl, but adds things like five different class decks and leveling up as you play cards to defeat an endless wave of monsters. It sounds fun, and it looks really great. The art in this one is pretty fantastic.\n\nYesterday, Righteous Hammer released the first trailer for Solitairica. Look for it to his the App Store in early 2016.\n\nChesh is Chess Turned Up to Eleven\n\nWhat if, every time you sat down to play Chess, you had no idea what the pieces were or how they moved? Okay, for some of us, this is a reality with a regular chess set, but play along with me here. Chesh is an upcoming game from developer Damian Sommer and aims to find out.\n\nIn Chesh, you will be unaware of what the pieces you have can do every game. That is, you'll have different pieces with different ways to move them each time you load up a game. It's not like you'll have the same 16 pieces that just move differently, the game actually has 530+ different pieces, so you'll never know what the hell is going on until you can figure out what your pieces do each game. That's not the only mix-up from regular chess. You can also change the board's size or how many pieces each player has each game as well.\n\nChesh is coming to iOS on October 8th and will feature both solo play against AI and multiplayer via pass-and-play or online. There are also three different modes of playing, bullet Chesh, infinite Chesh, and blitz Chesh.\n\n[+] Dice rolls"
