        "text": "Ryan and I are back to take a look at Purdue’s sixth game of the season against Ryan Walters’ former squad. There’s a bit of an added zing to this rivalry ever since Walters was hired by the Boilermakers. I think part of it stems from the fact that Walters brought along a number of coaches and players from Illinois with him and, as a fan who just saw Brohm leave and do the same, I completely get it. However, the difference I’ll point out is that Brohm was our head coach while Walters was just a coordinator.\n\nAll that preamble out of the way, Ryan provides us a lot of good info as to the issues that Illinois might face this season on both sides of the football. They are losing a number of playmakers from a team that didn’t make a bowl game last season, sound familiar? So, if they weren’t a world beater last year and are now losing their best playmakers, what’s going to happen?\n\nSounds to me like it’s a game that Purdue could win! Agree? Let me know if the comments."
