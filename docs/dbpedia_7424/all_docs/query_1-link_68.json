        "text": "There is no doubt DOOM 64 is the most advanced DOOM game in the 90's. When all other consoles had to do compromises and simplifications with their ports, the N64 got completely new levels that were even more complex and detailed then the PC originals. And on top of that, the game runs smoother than any other console DOOM and also boasts numerous visual improvements with the lighting and colors.\n\nSo how come the N64 handles this game so well? I'm not an expert but i would bet it's the CPU. The N64 has a very impressive CPU for the time, clocked at 94mhz as opposed to the PS1/Saturn that are clocked at 33 Mhz or less. This is important because DOOM was made before 3D took over and it's mostly a CPU bound game that doesn't make use of 3D hardware as much. I'm not saying the console ports don't make use of 3D hardware, the PS1 does and that's why it manages to run smooth enough (since the CPU is too slow), unlike the Saturn version. And surely DOOM 64 also does make some use of it for all it's extra effects. But it's still a DOOM engine game and i think it benefits a lot more from the N64's powerful CPU and not as much from it's 3D capabilities.\n\nThe same should also apply to Duke Nukem 3D, another game before 3D acceleration took over. Not the case with Duke Nukem 64 though. It seems like the N64 version uses a new 3D engine instead of build, making it your average looking/performing N64 3D game. But why? I can see why the Saturn version uses a new engine (Slave) since it's slow CPUs couldn't handle build in any way. And the developers managed to make an extremely good 3D engine for it, while the engine on the N64 port is pretty average.\n\nSo why didn't they make a similar game to DOOM 64, using the original build engine? I'm sure the N64 CPU could easily handle it. Why make a 3D engine instead? Did they afraid it would look out of date because you can't look up/down without distorting the image? Personally, i would take a smooth 30fps port of Duke Nukem 3D with similar enchantments to DOOM 64 over a \"true\" 3D version that doesn't run as well even on a smaller window.\n\nTLDR: The N64 has a powerful CPU and a not so powerful 3D hardware. DOOM and Duke Nukem 3D are CPU bound games so they could benefit from this. DOOM 64 does because it uses the DOOM engine and it looks/runs amazingly but Duke Nukem 64 goes for the 3D hardware and the port isn't as great.\n\nWell, Duke Nukem 64 and Duke Nukem Zero Hour both use BUILD and I have no idea where you got the idea they weren’t. DN64 has 3D models for explosions and the final boss, but it is still made with BUILD. It has been 100% confirmed that DNZH is using the BUILD engine. So I’d say, absolutely the N64 could handle the BUILD engine. DN64 has a lot of weapons that are similar to ones found in Shadow Warrior, so I imagine both SW and Blood could’ve been ported to the system in some way.\n\nDN64 may have been censored, but it wasn’t like the levels themselves were cut short or anything. If anything many of the levels were added onto, not taken away from. It also runs much smoother than the PS1 version.\n\nAlso, DN64 doesn’t have music because the developers simply didn’t bother, not due to any technical limitations.\n\nEdited September 21, 2023 by CAM-7EA"
