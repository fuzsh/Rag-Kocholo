I also think i changed the speed a bit, don't really remember. Not much of a mod but hey, first try.\n\nAttachments\n\nHAMMERHEAD.rar\n\nJun 29, 2012\n\n#2\n\nthis mod is great, is there a way to add more hammerheads to the game so there easier to find as well?\n\nAug 27, 2012\n\n#3\n\nwould love to hear that sound on the keystone, reaper and bootlegger\n\nSep 1, 2012\n\n#4\n\nI have always felt the same way. The cop car sound is perfect for the bootlegger. Thanks."
