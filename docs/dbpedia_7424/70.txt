Personally i feel the Hammerhead feels and sounds like crap by default so all i did was change the engine sound to the one of the police car which is way better. I also think i changed the speed a bit, don't really remember. Not much of a mod but hey, first try.

this mod is great, is there a way to add more hammerheads to the game so there easier to find as well?

I have always felt the same way. The cop car sound is perfect for the bootlegger. Thanks.
