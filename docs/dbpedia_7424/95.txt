“I contacted Hammerhead before I made my purchase. I had few questions about the GTS 150. Within 24 hours I had a response from Garrett Laves. He answered all of my questions that I had, In which led me to purchase the Hammerhead GTS 150. When it comes to customer service, I am a big stickler when it comes to it. He met my expectations above and beyond. Support is huge!!“
