        "text": "The old Norwegian farm | Finding Ole Johan Nyaas and his barn\n\nWith this old photograph in my hand I have set myself a task: how much information can I find in Norwegian online archives based on what the photo tells me?\n\nNorwegian railway history | The pioneer era 1851-1868\n\nWith the birth of Norway as a modern-day national state in 1814 came big ideas. One of them was to establish better inland transportation systems.\n\nQueen Maud of Norway | Where did she come from?\n\nHer Royal Highness Princess Maud Charlotte Mary Victoria of Wales was born on the 26 November 1869, at Marlborough House in London, UK.\n\nAre Santa Claus’s reindeer all female?\n\nSanta’s reindeer have a full set of antlers at Christmas and may all be female. The bull normally loses his after the mating season in late autumn.\n\nThe old Norwegian farm | Memories from Værøy in Lofoten\n\nThe wild ocean world of Værøy in Lofoten, Norway, was the birthplace of Mimmi Benjaminsen – born in 1894. Here are some of her childhood memories.\n\nQueen Maud of Norway | A young lady on the Isle of Wight\n\nOn 26 August 1909, a Norwegian newspaper retold a charming story from Cassell’s Saturday Journal, concerning a certain young lady on the Isle of Wight.\n\nThe Sami | The Sami flag days calendar\n\nThe Sami calendar consists of 12 flag days, the most prominent of them being the Sami National Day on 6 February.\n\nThe Norwegian cheese slicer | Ostehøvel\n\nThere are many types of cheese slicers, but Norwegian furniture-maker Thor Bjørklund invented the Norwegian version in 1925."
