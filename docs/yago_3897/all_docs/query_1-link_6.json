        "text": "On 22nd July 1896, Princess Maud, daughter of Prince Albert Edward, later King Edward VII and granddaughter of Queen Victoria, married Prince Carl of Denmark in the Private Chapel at Buckingham Palace.\n\n“A cooler day. Not very bright. — Lenchen & Thora breakfasted with me in the garden, under the trees close to the house, where it was very pleasant. — Sat out for a short while & then went in to dress, going downstairs at ½ p. 12, to the Bow Room, where all the family were assembled. I wore a black satin dress with embroideries & jet, a lace veil of old point, & diamond diadem & ornaments. After a few minutes, I was rolled through the Hall, Dining room, &c, to the vestibule of the Chapel, Christle & little Arthur going with me, & Louisa Buccleuch, Louisa A., Harriet Phipps, & the Ld Chamberlain in attendance. Here I got out of my chair & was met by the Great Officers of State, & all my Household. A procession was formed & I went into the Chapel assisted by Christle, & was conducted to my seat. […]\n\n[…] The Chapel was very prettily decorated with wreaths of red & white roses twined round the pillars. Above the altar was a large cross of white roses, & palms & white flowers on either side. All the Princes & Princesses bowed to me as they came in preceded by Heralds, &c. Dear Alix, looking so young & lovely in a pale grey dress & many diamonds came in last with her brother Freddy. She sat on my left, & Freddy & Louise of Denmark on my right. Next came the Bridegroom, in Danish naval uniform supported by his brothers Christian & Harold, & very soon after followed the dear Bride, led by Bertie & supported by Georgie. She had 8 Bridesmaids: Victoria, Ingeborg & Thyra of Denmark, Thora, Daisy & Patsy, Alice, & little Alix Duff. Dear Maud looked very pretty in her white satin dress with a very long train bordered with orange blossoms, on her head, her mother’s wedding veil, & a wreath of orange blossoms. The Arch Bishop of Canterbury performed the ceremony, assisted by the Bishops of London & Winchester, other Clergy being also present. The Arch Bishop delivered a short & good address. After the Benediction, Maud came forward to her Parents & then to Me & I kissed both her & the Bridegroom. The Processions reformed in reverse order, & passed to the sounds of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March, as in coming, through the covered Gallery which had been arranged on the Terrace. I returned privately as I came & rejoined all the family in the 44 Room, where the Register was signed. When this was over I went upstairs to my room, & lunched quietly with Harriet P., whilst the wedding breakfast was going on below. My thoughts were dwelling sadly on my darling Beatrice who will be spending tomorrow the first sad lovely anniversary of her wedding day, & the contrast of her shattered happy married life, with the one begun today is most piteous. – After luncheon Maud & Charles came to wish me goodbye & I saw them from the window drive away up Constitution Hill. I then took leave of Freddy & Louise of Denmark & their nice daughters. They were full of kind expressions & she said she would do all she could for Maud. – Had some tea & at ¼ p. 6 left with Thora, returning to Windsor. The evening was fine & the crowds were most enthusiastic, which was very gratifying. – Louise Buccleuch, Louisa A., Sir J. Mc Neill & Fritz Ponsonby dined with us 2. -“\n\nhttp://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/\n\n© Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2012 © Bodleian Libraries © ProQuest"
