        "text": "Princess Maud Charlotte Mary Victoria was the third daughter and youngest surviving child of the Prince and Princess of Wales, later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of Denmark, the daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel.\n\nPrincess Maud was born at Marlborough House on 26 November 1869. She was baptised by John Jackson, Bishop of London at Marlborough House on 24 December 1869.\n\nMaud had two older brothers Albert Victor Christian Edward, Duke of Clarence and Avondale and Prince George Frederick Ernest Albert of Wales, later King George V. She also had two sisters, Louise, Princess Royal (Louise Victoria Alexandra Dagmar) and Victoria Alexandra Olga Mary. Her third brother, Prince Alexander John of Wales died within 24 hours of his birth.\n\nA lively child she earned the nickname ‘Harry’ among her family and friends.\n\nMaud enjoyed the country life, taking part in the typical country pursuits especially riding. She also shared a common interest in art, photography and music with her mother and sister and was a keen lover of dogs.\n\nShe joined her family in their frequent visits to Denmark, and later she accompanied her mother and sister Princess Victoria on cruises to the Mediterranean and Norway.\n\nPrincess Maud married her first cousin, Prince Carl of Denmark on 22 July 1896. Prince Carl was the second son of Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark, Queen Alexandra’s older brother, and Princess Louise of Sweden.\n\nThe wedding took place in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace.\n\nHer father, the then Prince of Wales, gifted her Appleton House, which is located at the Sandringham Estate to use for a country residence during her visits to England.\n\nHer only child, Prince Alexander was born on 2 July 1903 at Appleton House.\n\nHer husband, Prince Carl, an officer in the Danish Navy lived mainly in Denmark until he was elected King of Norway in 1905. Prince Carl became Haakon VII, whilst his son took the name of Crown Prince Olav.\n\nKing Haakon and Queen Maud were crowned on 22 June 1906 at Trondheim.\n\nMaud loved England, but she adapted to her new country and duties. She was a strong supporter of charities that focussed on children and animals as well as music and the arts.\n\nMaud visited England for the last time in October 1938. She first stayed at Sandringham, later moving into a hotel in the West End of London.\n\nAfter falling ill, she was admitted to a nursing home to undergo an abdominal operation on 16 November 1938.\n\nAlthough she withstood having surgery, she succumbed to heart failure at Appleton House on 20 November, a mere six days before her sixty-ninth birthday.\n\nHer body was returned to Norway where she is buried in the Royal Mausoleum at Akershus Castle in Oslo.\n\nFollowing the death of her husband, King Haakon in September 1957, Maud’s son the Crown Prince of Norway succeeded as King Olav V. He married Princess Märtha of Sweden in 1929. The couple had three children, Princess Ragnhild Alexandra, Princess Astrid Maud Ingeborg and Harald V who is the present King of Norway.\n\nPhoto credits: Peder O.
