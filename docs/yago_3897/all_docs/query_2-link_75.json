The third daughter and fifth child of the then Prince of Wales and Princess Alexandra of Denmark, she was born during the reign of her grandmother, Queen Victoria, and spent her childhood between Marlborough House in London and Sandringham in Norfolk. In 1896, she married her first cousin, Prince Carl of Denmark. The couple had one son, and in 1905, Prince Carl was elected to the Throne of an independent Norway, taking the regnal name of King Haakon VII, and their son taking the name of Olav. Very popular in Norway, Queen Maud made frequent visits to Britain, often staying at Appleton House on the Sandringham Estate, a wedding gift from her father, where she died of heart failure on this day in 1938.\n\nQueen Alexandra’s Diamond Circlet | Queen Maud’s Pearl Tiara | Diamond Tiara | Vifte Tiara | Queen Alexandra’s Turquoise Circlet | Diamond Chandelier Earrings | Seed Pearl Choker | Diamond and Pearl Brooch | Drapers’ Company Brooch | Aquamarine Brooch | Diamond Brooch | Pearl Bow Brooch | The Jewels of Queen Maud of Norway\n\nClick on the highlighted links/images below to see the article on each piece!\n\nQueen Alexandra’s Diamond Circlet\n\nQueen Maud’s Pearl Tiara\n\nQueen Maud’s Diamond Tiara\n\nQueen Alexandra’s Turquoise Circlet\n\nVifte Tiara\n\nRuby Aigrette Tiara\n\nQueen Maud’s Drapers’ Company Brooch\n\nQueen Alexandra’s Diamond and Pearl Brooch\n\nQueen Maud’s Diamond Brooch\n\nQueen Maud’s Pearl Bow Brooch\n\nQueen Maud’s Aquamarine Brooch\n\nQueen Maud’s Seed Pearl Choker\n\nQueen Alexandra’s Diamond Link Choker\n\nShare this:"
