Numerous extracts from these works have been incorporated, although it has proved difficult to identify all Welsh persons who are named, particularly for the later years. The Annales Cambriæ, said to have been compiled originally in 954, represents the oldest register of events in Wales . The version of the 12th century \"Brut y Tywysogion\" (Chronicle of the Princes of Wales), published with English translation in the Rolls Series in 1860 by John Williams, was incorporated into the Red Book of Hergest, a manuscript compilation of numerous 6th to 15th century literary works written in the Welsh language . The so-called \"Gwentian Chronicle\" represents another version of the Chronicle of the Princes/Brut y Tywysogion, allegedly arranged by Caradoc of Llancarvan, with major differences in the text and particular emphasis on southern Wales . However, there is some difficulty associated with the Gwentian Chronicle. It appears to have been first published in the late 18th century by Edward Williams (also known as \"Iolo Morganwg\") who was \"considered an authority on Welsh literature and folklore at the time, but was revealed as a forger in the twentieth century\" . The extent of the fabrication of the Gwentian Chronicle is not known: clearly it includes some reliable information as many of the statements coincide with what appears in the Annales Cambriæ and the Chronicle of the Princes. The problems related to the authenticity of the Gwentian Chronicle were discussed by Thomas Stephens in the mid-19th century and more recently G. J. Williams . After analysing the possible origin of the so-called Gwentian Chronicle in several other earlier manuscripts, and discussing the problems in detail, Stephens concludes that \"that it abounds in mistakes, conjectures and unauthorised additions several anachronisms\" but that \"it has many parallelisms with Brut Ieuan Brechva\", suggesting that \"both the Book of Aberpergwm and the so-called Book of Caradoc are documents of the sixteenth century\" . Extracts from the Gwentian Chronicle are included in square brackets in the present document to highlight the potential difficulty. As will be seen, without these extracts many parts of the reconstruction of the families of the Welsh princes and kings would be sparse.\n\nAnother view concerning the difficulty of accurately reconstructing Welsh royal genealogies is given by Bridgeman in the introduction to his History of the Princes of South Wales. He states that The chief difficulty which meets the student of Welsh medieval history is the scarcity of official deeds. The writings of the early chroniclers, though singularly faithful on the whole, cannot always be implicitly trusted, and it is not often that the facts they record can be authenticated by contemporary documentation, and emphasises in particular the lack of reliability of Heraldic Pedigrees...drawn up from the first with palpable inaccuracies and without any regard for dates . Some of the areas of difficulty which he highlights are discussed below in the present document.\n\nDating of early medieval Welsh history is a particular problem as the three main sources referred to above rarely coincide in the dates which they attribute to the events recorded.\n\nChapter 1. KINGS of CEREDIGION\n\n1. LLYWARCH Llwyd . King of Ceredigion. m ---. Llywarch & his wife had two children:\n\na) MORYDD (-8 Dec 830). [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Morydd son of Llywarch Llwyd, king of Ceredigion\" died 8 Dec 830 on the same day as a solar eclipse .]\n\nb) MEURUG . [His parentage is confirmed by the Gwentian Chronicle which names his son \"Gwgan son of Morydd son of Llywarch Llwyd, king of Ceredigion\" when recording his death .] King of Ceredigion. m ---. The name of Meurug´s wife is not known. Meurug & his wife had [two] children:\n\ni) GWGAWN (-drowned river Llychwr, Gower [870/71]). King of Ceredigion. The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that \"Gwgawn son of Meurug king of Ceredigion was drowned\" in 871 . [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Gwgan son of Morydd son of Llywarch Llwyd, king of Ceredigion was drowned in crossing the river Llychwr in Gower, to drive the black pagans out of that country\" in 870 .]\n\nii) [ANGHARAD . Angharad´s parentage and marriage are recorded in a manuscript now at Jesus College . m RHODRI ap Merfyn \"Mawr/the Great\", son of MERFYN \"Frych/the Freckled\" ap Gwriad King of Gwynedd & his wife Nest of Powys (-killed Anglesey 878).]\n\n2. GRUFFYDD . m ---. The name of Gruffydd´s wife is not known. Gruffydd & his wife had one child:\n\na) OWAIN (-killed 933). [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Owain son of Gruffyd was killed by the men of Ceredigion\" in 933 .]\n\nChapter 2. KINGS of DYFED\n\n1. MAREDUDD (-[Rhuddlan] [796/800]). King of Dyfed. The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records the death in 796 of \"Maredudd king of Dyved\" . The Gwentian Chronicle records \"the action of Rhuddlan where Meredydd king of Dyved and Caradawc son of Gwyn, son of Collwyn king of Gwynedd were killed\" in 796 . The Annales Menevensis record that \"Maredud rex Demetorum\" died in 798 . It should be noted that the Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that \"the Saxons killed Caradog king of Gwynedd\" in 800 . It is not therefore known whether Maredudd and Caradog died in the same battle or in two separate incidents.\n\n2. RHYDDERCH [Rein] (-[804/08]). King of Dyfed. [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Arthen king of the Ceredigiawn, Rhydderch king of Dyved, and Cadell king of Teyrnllwg now called Powys\" died in 804 .] The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records the death in 808 of \"Rein king of Dyved\" , which presumably refers to the same person. m ---. The name of Rhydderch´s wife is not known. Rhydderch & his wife had one child:\n\na) TRYFFIN (-815). The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records the death in 815 of \"Tryffin son of Rein\" .\n\n3. LLYWARCH ap Hyfaidd (-904). King of Dyfed. m ---. The name of Llywarch´s wife is not known. Llywarch & his wife had one child:\n\na) ELEN of Dyfed, daughter and heiress of (-[943]) . The primary source which confirms her parentage has not yet been identified. [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Elen wife of Hywel the Good\" died in 943 .] m HYWEL ap Cadell \"Dda/the Black\", son of CADELL & his wife --- (-[948/50]).\n\n4. RHYDDERCH (-executed 905). King of Dyfed.\n\nChapter 3. KINGS of GWENT\n\n1. IDWAL (-killed in battle 848). King of Gwent. The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records the death in 848 of \"Ithel king of Gwent slain by the men of Breicheiniog\" .\n\nChapter 4. KINGS of GWYNEDD\n\nA. KINGS of GWYNEDD, descendants of CADWALLON \"Lawhir\"\n\n1. IAGO ap Beli (-613) . He succeeded his father in 599 as King of Gwynedd. The Annales Cambriæ record the death of \"Iacob filii Beli\" in 613 .\n\n1. CADWALLON ap Cadfan (-killed in battle Denisesburn [635]) . King of Gwynedd. The Annales Cambriæ record the siege of \"Catguollaun regis\" in 629 in \"insula Glannauc\" . Bede records that \"Caedualla rex Brettonum\", helped by \"Penda de region genere Merciorum\", rebelled against Eadwine King of Northumbria who was killed in battle \"IV Id Oct\" in 633 at \"Haethfelth\", adding that the rebels continued to govern the country with varying success for 22 years . Bede records that \"rex Brettonum Ceadualla\" killed \"Osricum\" [King of Deira] in [634], and ruled \"provinciæ Nordanhymbrorum\" for a year before also killing \"Eanfridum\" [King of Bernicia] who had visited Cadwallon to sue for peace . Bede records that \"Osualdi\", after the death of \"fratris [eius] Eanfridi\", defeated and killed \"Bretonnici regis tyrannidem\" (referring to \"rex Brettonum Ceadualla\") at \"Denisesburgna, id est riuus Denisi\" . [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Cadwallawn son of Cadvan king of the Britons\" died in 660 (dating seriously awry) and was succeeded by \"his son Cadwalader the Blessed\" .] m --- of Mercia, daughter of [PYBBA of Mercia --- & his wife ---]. Roger of Wendover records that the mother of \"rex Britonum Cadwallo Cadwaladrus filius eius juvenem\" was \"soror Pendæ regis Merciorum\" whom Cadwallon married after his alliance with King Penda . However, the passage in this source is confused as it also records the death of King Cadwallon senior in 676. Cadwallon & his wife had one child:\n\na) CADWALADR ap Cadwallon \"Fendigard/the Blessed\" (-killed in battle 682). [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Cadwallawn son of Cadvan king of the Britons\" died in 660 (dating seriously awry) and was succeeded by \"his son Cadwalader the Blessed\" .] After his father's death, the throne of Gwynedd was usurped by Cadafael ap Cynfedw, who was deposed in 654 by Cadwaladr who then succeeded as King of Gwynedd. The Annales Cambriæ record the death of \"Catgualart filius Catguolaum\" in 682, killed in battle . m ---. The name of Cadwaladr´s wife is not known. Cadwaladr & his wife had [one child]:\n\ni) [IVOR (-[Rome 20 May 689]). The Annales Menevensis record that \"Cadwalladrus rex Britanniæ\" sent \"Ivor filium suum\" with 12 ships \"ad regendas Britonum reliquias\" in 689, and that he died in Rome \"XII Kal Mai\" in 689 . The dating of this event, if it did take place, is inconsistent with the date of King Cadwaladr´s death as recorded in the Annales Cambriæ (see above).]\n\n1. IDWAL ap Cadwaladr \"Iwrch\" (-after 734). The chronology appears stretched for Idwal ap Cadwaladr to have been the son of Cadwaladr ap Cadwallon. King of Gwynedd. The Annales Cambriæ name \"Ivor filius Cadwallader\" in 734 .\n\n2. RHODRI \"Molwynog\" (-[750/54], bur Caerleon). King of Gwynedd. The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records the victory of \"Rhodri Molwynog\" in \"the battle of Heilin in Cornwall\" in 721 . [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Rhodri Molwynawc was made king over the Britons\" in 720 and that \"a great war arose between him and the Saxons, during which the Britons won two battles honourably\" .] The Annales Cambriæ record the death in 754 of \"Rotri rex Brittonum\" . The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records the death in 754 of \"Rhodri Molwynog king of the Britons\" . The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Rhodri Molwynawc\" died in 750 after reigning for 30 years and \"was buried at Caerleon on the Usk the last of the race of the kings of the island of Britain who was buried there\" .\n\n3. [CYNAN Dindaethwy (-after 754). [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Cynan Tindaethwy [was] made king of all Wales by the consent of all the kings and lords\" in 754 .] King of Gwynedd. The same source records the death \"of Cynan Tindaethwy king of all Wales\" in 814 \"a short time after\" he had expelled his brother from Anglesey . The wide elapse of time suggests that the king whose death is reported in 814 could not have been the same person as the one whose accession is reported in 754, or else the earlier report is misdated.]\n\n4. COLLWYN . King of Gwynedd. m ---. The name of Collwyn´s wife is not known. Collwyn & his wife had one child:\n\na) GWYN . m ---. The name of Collwyn´s wife is not known. Collwyn & his wife had one child:\n\ni) CARADOG (-killed in battle Rhuddlan [796/800]). King of Gwynedd. The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that \"the Saxons killed Caradog king of Gwynedd\" in 800 . [The Gwentian Chronicle records \"the action of Rhuddlan where Meredydd king of Dyved and Caradawc son of Gwyn, son of Collwyn king of Gwynedd were killed\" in 796 .]\n\nTwo brothers:\n\n1. HYWEL (-825). King of Gwynedd. [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"the kingdom of Mona and the kingdom of Dyved [were] impoverished on account of the war between Hywel Vychan and his brother Cynan, in which Hywel conquered Mona\" in 810 .] The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that \"Howel subdued the isle of Mona and expelled his brother Cynan\" in 815 but \"was a second time driven from Mona\" in 817 . The Gwentian Chronicle records \"war a second time between Hywel and his brother Cynan upon which Cynan attacked his brother Hywel and drove him from Mona to Man\" in 814 . The Annales Cambriæ record the death in 825 of \"Higuel\" . The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records the death in 825 of \"Howel king of Man\" .\n\n2. CYNAN (-[816/17]). King of Anglesey [Mona]. [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"the kingdom of Mona and the kingdom of Dyved [were] impoverished on account of the war between Hywel Vychan and his brother Cynan, in which Hywel conquered Mona\" in 810 .] The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that \"Howel subdued the isle of Mona and expelled his brother Cynan\" in 815 . [The Gwentian Chronicle records \"war a second time between Hywel and his brother Cynan upon which Cynan attacked his brother Hywel and drove him from Mona to Man\" in 814 .] The Annales Cambriæ record the death in 816 of \"Cinan rex\" . The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records the death in 817 of \"Cynon king of Gwynedd\" . [The Gwentian Chronicle records the death \"of Cynan Tindaethwy king of all Wales\" in 814 \"a short time after\" he had expelled his brother from Anglesey . The same source records the succession of \"Cynan Tindaethwy\" in 754. The wide elapse of time suggests that the king whose death is reported in 814 could not have been the same person or the earlier report is misdated.] m ---. The name of Cynan´s wife is not known. Cynan & his wife had [three] children:\n\na) [GRUFFYDD (-[814]). [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Gruffydd son of Cynan died through the treachery of his brother Elisse\" in 814 .] It should be noted that the Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that \"Griffri son of Cyngen son of Cadell\" was killed in 815 \"through the treachery of his brother Elisse\" . It is not therefore known whether Gruffydd and Elisse were sons of Cynan King of Anglesey/Gwynedd or grandsons of Cadel King of Powys. The chronology appears to favour the former interpretation, but the uncertainty of the chronology of all these early sources is recognised.]\n\nb) [ELISSE (-[814/16]). [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Gruffydd son of Cynan died through the treachery of his brother Elisse\" in 814 .] It should be noted that the Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that \"Griffri son of Cyngen son of Cadell\" was killed in 815 \"through the treachery of his brother Elisse\" . It is not therefore known whether Gruffydd and Elisse were sons of Cynan King of Anglesey/Gwynedd or grandsons of Cadel King of Powys. The chronology appears to favour the former interpretation, but the uncertainty of the chronology of all these early sources is recognised. If Elisse was the son of Cynan, he must have predeceased his father whose daughter is recorded as his heir (see below).]\n\nc) ETHYLL (-after [814/16]) . While the surviving sources are consistent regarding the parentage of Ethyll, they are contradictory regarding the identity of her husband. The mid-10th century Harleian Manuscript genealogy names the ancestors of Rhodri \"Mawr/the Great\": \" Rotri map Mermin map Etthil merch Cinnan \" . The name of her husband, recorded in the 13th century History of Gruffydd ap Cynan which names \"Rodri Mawr son of Mervyn Vrych son of Gwryat \", is consistent with this version . [The Gwentian Chronicle provides a different version of events when it records that \"[the] daughter [of Cynan Tindaethwy king of all Wales] who was his heir married a chieftain of the name of Mervyn the Freckled\", a later passage adding that \"Mervyn the Freckled and Essyllt his wife began to reign over Gwynedd and Powys\" in 818 .] It is impossible to judge which version is preferable. Indeed, it is possible that Ethyll was not a historical figure at all but was invented to legitimise the dynastic change in the eyes of successor generations of kings of Gwynedd and their supporters. m either: GWRIAD a Manx chieftain, son of ---, or: MERFYN ap Gwriad \"Frych/the Freckled\" King of Gwynedd, son of GWRIAD & his wife --- (-844).\n\nB. KINGS of GWYNEDD, descendants of GWRIAD\n\nGWRIAD, son of --- . The 13th century History of Gruffydd ap Cynan names \"Rodri Mawr son of Mervyn Vrych son of Gwryat \", and traces Gwriad´s alleged ancestry back to Llywarch Hen, a supposed 6th century British prince, and further back through biblical times to Adam . The point at which legend becomes fact in this descent is not known. A Manx chieftain.\n\nm [ETHYLL of Gwynedd, daughter and heiress of CYNAN [King of Gwynedd] & his wife ---.

It is impossible to judge which version is preferable. Indeed, it is possible that Ethyll was not a historical figure at all but was invented to legitimise the dynastic change in the eyes of successor generations of kings and their supporters.]\n\nGwriad & his wife had one child:\n\n1. MERFYN ap Gwriad \"Frych/the Freckled\" (-844) . The 13th century History of Gruffydd ap Cynan names \"Rodri Mawr son of Mervyn Vrych son of Gwryat \" . King of Gwynedd. The Annales Cambriæ record the death in 844 of \"Mermin\" . The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records the death in 844 of \"Mervyn the Freckled\" . m [either: ETHYLL of Gwynedd, daughter and heiress of CYNAN [King of Gwynedd] & his wife ---, or: NEST of Powys, daughter of CADELL ap Brochwell King of Powys & his wife ---. [The Gwentian Chronicle records that the mother of \"Mervyn the Freckled\" was \"Nest daughter of Cadell of Derrnllwg, son of Brochwel Ysgithrog\", after recording that \"[the] daughter [of Cynan Tindaethwy king of all Wales] who was his heir married a chieftain of the name of Mervyn the Freckled\" .] The alternative marriage to Nest of Powys is now recorded in manuscripts dated no earlier than the later 14th century, although possibly copied from earlier texts . It is impossible to judge which version is preferable. Indeed, it is possible that both Ethyll and Nest were not historical figures at all but were invented to legitimise claims to Gwynedd and Powys, respectively, in the eyes of successor generations of kings and their supporters.] Merfyn & his wife had [two] children:\n\na) RHODRI ap Merfyn \"Mawr/the Great\" (-killed Anglesey 878) .

With these contradictory sources, it is uncertain whether Gwriad was the brother or son of Rhodri, although the later passage quoted below which names Gwriad´s son suggests that he was Rhodri´s son.]\n\nRHODRI ap Merfyn \"Mawr/the Great\", son of MERFYN \"Frych/the Freckled\" ap Gwriad King of Gwynedd & his wife Nest of Powys (-killed Anglesey 878) . [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Rhodri the Great, son of Mervyn the Freckled began to reign over the Welsh\" in 843 .] King of Gwynedd. [The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Rhodri the Great opposed [Berthwrd king of Mercia] with the assistance of Meuryg son of Hywel king of Glamorgan\" in 843, adding that Meuryg was killed in the battle and was succeeded by \"Ithel son of Hywel\" who was killed by \"the men of Brecknockshire\" on his way to assist Rhodri .] He succeeded his maternal uncle Cyngen ap Cadell as King of Powys in 855. He succeeded in 872 as King of Seisyllwg. The Annals of Ulster record that \"Rhodri son of Merfyn king of the Britons came in flight from the dark foreigners to Ireland\" in 877 .

[The Gwentian Chronicle records the division of territories effected by \"Rhodri the Great\" and that \"Gwynedd he conferred upon his son Anarawd and his palace was at Aberffraw in Mona\" .] King of Gwynedd. The Gwentian Chronicle is contradicted by Gerald of Wales´s Descriptio Kambriæ which records that Rothericus magnus, qui Britannice Rotheri Maur dicebatur had tres filios...Mervinum, Anaraut et Cadelh who divided Wales between them, Mervino...Nortwallia, Anaraut Powisia, Cadelh...Sudwallia .

It appears that Idwal \"Foel/the Bald\" was a different person from Idwal, son of King Rhodri, who became King of Gwynedd (see below). This is apparent from the passage in the Gwentian Chronicle which records that \"the Welsh gained their freedom through the bravery and wisdom of Eidwal the Bald and his brother Elisseu and Idwal son of Rhodri the Great\" in 940 .

The chronology is stretched for Idwal to have been the son of King Rhodri \"Mawr/the Great\".

There is no record of Idwal having been provided for with territories by King Rhodri unlike his three surviving legitimate sons who are named above. If Idwal was Rhodri´s son, he must have been illegitimate, born late in his father´s life.

Her parentage, betrothals and two marriages are confirmed by the following documents. Pope Innocent III, by letter dated 24 Nov 1199, requested an enquiry after R. princeps Norwaliæ requested permission to marry filiam...prinicipis Insularum notwithstanding that patruo eius eadem infra nubiles annos exstitit desponsata, in particular investigating whether she was still under 7 years old [youngest canonical age for marriage at the time] when a nepote, vel patruo desponsata .

Remfry notes that Dwnns Visitation incorrectly names Rhunallt, the daughter of the king of Man as wife of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (see below) and suggests that this may represent confusion with the first/second wife of Llywelyn .

Remfry notes that Dwnns Visitation incorrectly names Rhunallt, the daughter of the king of Man as wife of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (see below) and suggests that this may represent confusion with the first/second wife of Llywelyn . Remfry also suggests that Gruffydd was the son of his fathers first wife, declared illegitimate when his parents marriage was annulled, citing a contemporary poet who records Owain Goch, oldest son of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, as of the lineage of the kings of Man .\n\nm secondly/thirdly (after 16 Apr 1205) JOAN [of England], illegitimate daughter of JOHN King of England & his mistress Clementia Pinel (-30 Mar 1237). King John confirmed \"castrum de Ellesmara\" to \"Lewelino principi Norwallie in maritagium cum Johanna filia nostra\" by charter dated 16 Apr 1205 . Her husband sent her to make peace with the king her father in 1211 when the latter was attacking North Wales. She was legitimated in 1226: Pope Honorius III gave dispensation to Joan wife of Leuwelin prince of North Wales, daughter of king John declaring her legitimate, but without prejudice to the king or realm of England, dated 29 Apr 1226 . She and her son David did homage to King Henry III in 1229 . The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that \"William Bruse was hanged by Llywelyn son of Iorewerth, having been caught in the chamber of the prince with the princess Jannet, daughter of King John and wife of the prince\" in 1230 . The Annales Cambriæ record the death in 1237 of \"domina Johanna filia regis Angliæ et uxor Lewilini principis Walliæ\" and her burial \"apud Haber\" . The Annals of Tewkesbury record the death III Kal Apr in 1236 of domina Johanna Walliæ, uxor Lewelini, filia regis Johannis et reginæ Clemenciæ . The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that \"Dame Joan daughter of king John and the wife of Llywelyn son of Iorwerth\" died in Feb 1237 \"at the court of Aber and was buried in a new cemetery on the side of the strand which Howel bishop of Llanelwy had consecrated\" .\n\nm thirdly/fourthly (1239) EVA, daughter of FULK FitzWarin [IV] & his [second] wife Constance de Tosny. The Annales Cestrienses record in 1239 that Lewelinus princeps Wallie married filiam Fulconis filii Warini . The Legend of Fulk Fitz Warin records that \"Lowis le prince de Walys\" married \"sire Fouke Eve sa file\" after the death of his first wife \"dame Johane que fust la file le roi Henre de Engleterre\" .\n\nMistress (1): [TANGWYSTL, daughter of LLYWARCH Goch [the Red] of Rhos & his wife ---. Lloyds early 20th century History of Wales names Tangwystl, daughter of Llywarch the Red of Rhos, as mother of Llywelyns son Gruffydd . Lloyd cites Dwnns Heraldic Visitation of Wales which names Llywelyns children Grufydd a Gwladus as the children of Tanglwyst verch gôch or Rhos, ag i Lowardh Holdwrch . Remfry, however, suggests that Tangwystl seems only to have been created in the 17th century , although he also cites a survey of Denbighshire dated [1336] which records that Prince Llywelyn had earlier donated land (Dyncadvel in Llannefydd) to cuidam amice sue nomine Tanguestel Goch who sold it : the word amice [variant of amicæ], dative singular of amica, could be a euphemism to describe Llywelyns mistress. Remfry, suggesting that Llywelyns first/second wife (the princess of Man) was Gruffydds mother, cites a contemporary poet who records Owain Goch (Gruffydds oldest son) as of the lineage of the kings of Man . The suggestion seems chronologically possible, given the likely birthdate of Llywelyns first/second wife, if Gruffydd was born in the late 1190s. Given these apparently conflicting indications, certainty about the identity of Gruffydds mother is difficult.]\n\nMistresses (2): - (7): ---. The names of the other mistresses of Prince Llywelyn are not known.\n\nPrince Llywelyn & his second/third wife had three children:\n\n1. DAFYDD ([1208]-25 Feb 1246, bur Aberconway) . Son of Llywelyn according to Matthew Paris . The Annales Cambriæ name \"David filius eius [Lewelini] de Johanna filia Johannis regis Angliæ\" . Henry III King of England granted protection to \"nepotem nostrum David filium L. principis Norwallie\" dated [May] 1229 . Henry III King of England granted safe passage to \"David filium L. principis Norwallier in veniendo ad regem ad faciendum ei homagium suum, et sororem ipsius David\" dated 5 Sep 1229 . He succeeded his father in 1240 as DAFYDD II Prince of Wales. The Annales Cambriæ record the death in 1246 of \"David filius Lewelini apud Aber\" and his burial \"apud Aberconuy\" . The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that \"David son of Llywelyn died at Aber in the month of March and was buried with his father at Aberconway\" in 1246 . The Annales Cestrienses record the death V Kal Mar 1246 of David fil. Lewelini princeps Wallie and his burial apud Abercon juxta patrem suum . m (1230) ISABEL de Briouse, daughter of WILLIAM de Briouse & his wife Eva Marshal of the Earls of Pembroke (-1248). A letter from \"L. princeps de Aberfrau, dominus Snauedoniæ\" to \"E. de Braus\", dated [May] 1230, enquires whether she wishes the proposed marriage between \"David filium nostrum et I. filiam vestram\" to take place . A manuscript which narrates the descents of the founders of Lanthony Abbey names Isabella, Matildis, Eva et Alianora as the four daughters of Willielmus de Brews quartus and his wife Evam filiam domini Willielmi Mareschalli, adding that Isabel married David filio Lewelini principis Walliæ . The Annals of Dunstable record that Willelmus de Brause filiam suam married Leulino filio, with as her dowry castello de Boet, which reverted to her family after her husband died .\n\n2. HELEN (-1253 before 24 Oct) . The Annales Cestrienses record in 1222 that Johannes filius comitis David married filiam Lewelini in accordance with the agreement between him and comitem Cestrie . The Annals of Dunstable record that Johannes comes Cestriæ died in 1237 and eius uxor filia Lewelini married Roberto [de Quinci] against her father´s wishes . The primary source which confirms her name has not yet been identified. Matthew Paris records that it was suspected that his wife \"filia Leolini\" poisoned John the Scot . A writ after the death of \"Eleanor, sometime the wife of John Earl of Chester\", dated \"the eve of St Martin 38 Hen III\", records the \"partition of her lands between Si J. de Bayllol, Robert de Brus, and Henry de Hasting, the heirs of the said earl\" . m firstly ([1222]) JOHN \"the Scot\" Earl of Huntingdon, son of JOHN of Scotland Earl of Huntingdon & his wife Matilda of Chester ([1207]-Darnal [5/7] Jun 1237, bur Chester St Werburg). He was created Earl of Chester 21 Nov 1232. m secondly (1237 before 5 Dec) ROBERT de Quincy, son of SAHER Earl of Winchester & his wife Margaret of Leicester (-Aug 1257).\n\n3. SUSANNA ([1216/21]-after 24 Nov 1228). Henry III King of England granted the upbringing of \"L. princeps Norwallie et Johanna uxor sua et soror nostra Susannam filiam suam\" to \"Nicholao de Verdun et Clementie uxori sue\" by order dated 24 Nov 1228 . Her birth date is estimated on the assumption that Susanna was under marriageable age, but older than an infant, at the time.\n\nPrince Llywelyn had one [illegitimate] son by his [first/second wife/Mistress (1)]:\n\n4.GRUFFYDD (before 1205-Tower of London 1 Mar 1244) . Called \"frater primogenitus\" of David by Matthew Paris, when he records that Gruffydd consented to his brother's succession on the death of their father . Dwnns Heraldic Visitation of Wales names Llywelyns children Grufydd a Gwladus as the children of Tanglwyst verch gôch or Rhos, ag i Lowardh Holdwrch . As discussed above, Remfry suggests that Gruffydd was the son of his fathers first wife, declared illegitimate when his parents marriage was nullified: he cites a contemporary poet who records Owain Goch, oldest son of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, as of the lineage of the kings of Man . Lord of Lleyn. He was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London, dying in an escape attempt .\n\n- see below.\n\nPrince Llywelyn had one illegitimate child by [Mistress (1) or (2)]:\n\n5.GWLADUS Ddu (\"the Black\") (-Windsor 1251) . Dwnns Heraldic Visitation of Wales names Llywelyns children Grufydd a Gwladus as the children of Tanglwyst verch gôch or Rhos, ag i Lowardh Holdwrch . The accuracy of this passage is unknown as no earlier source has been found which names Gwladuss mother, bearing in mind also the doubt relating to Tanglwyst which is discussed above. The Annals of Dunstable record that Reginaldus frater eius (referring to Ægidius Herefordensis episcopus) married Leulini Regis Walliæ filiam in 1216 . Henry III King of England granted protection to \"Gwladosa filia [L.] principis [Norwallie] que fuit uxor Reginaldi de Brausa\" dated [May] 1229, issued at the same time as letters of protection to her brother David . Henry III King of England granted safe passage to \"David filium L. principis Norwallier in veniendo ad regem ad faciendum ei homagium suum, et sororem ipsius David\" dated 5 Sep 1229 . It is likely that this unnamed sister of David was Gwladus, coming to England with her brother before her second marriage.

John of Fordun´s Scotichronicon (Continuator) records the death in 1228 of \"Malcolmus comes de Fyfe\" and the succession of \"Malcolmus nepos eius, filius fratris eius\", adding that the latter later married \"filiam Leulini regis Walliæ\" . The Chronicle of Melrose records the death in 1230 of \"Malcolm earl of Fife\" and the succession of \"his nephew Malcolm, the son of his brother\", adding that the latter \"afterwards married the daughter of Leulin\" . The Chronicle of Lanercost records the death in 1229 of \"comes de Fif, Malcolmus\", the succession of \"nepos eiusdem Malcolmus\", adding that the latter married \"filia Leulini senioris domini Walliæ\" . The last source is the only one of the three which does not state that the new earl´s marriage was later than his succession. Her birth date is estimated on her having given birth to her known son in [1244/46], which suggests that the couple married at least ten years after Malcolm became earl. It is assumed that she was illegitimate. If she had been her father´s legitimate daughter, the absence in the sources of any reference to her descent from John King of England would be surprising. The second marriage of the widow of Malcolm Earl of Fife is confirmed by the documents under which \"Elenæ comitissæ de Marre\" accounted for payment of \"xl s pro parte dotis suæ\" in the accounts of lands formerly belonging to Duncan Earl of Fife 20 Nov 1293 and 16 Feb 1294 . However, it is not certain that this widow of Earl Malcolm was the same person as his wife who was the daughter of Prince Llywelyn. The birth of Earl Malcolm´s son Colban is estimated to [1244/46]. However, Earl Malcolm´s widow had four known children by her second husband. This would mean that she gave birth to children over an approximately thirty year span, which although not impossible would be unusual. In addition, it seems unlikely that Earl Donald would have married, as his first marriage, a woman who would have been more than 35 years old. m [firstly] [as his first wife,] MALCOLM Earl of Fife, son of DUNCAN Macduff of Fife & his wife Alice Corbet (-1266).

As discussed above, Remfry suggests that Gruffydd was the son of his fathers first wife, declared illegitimate when his parents marriage was nullified: he cites a contemporary poet who records Owain Goch, oldest son of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, as of the lineage of the kings of Man . As noted above under Tangwystl, certainty about the identity of Gruffydds mother is difficult considering the conflicting indications. Lord of Lleyn.

Dwnns Heraldic Visitation of Wales names Rannullt verch ag aeres Reinallt brenin Manaw as mother of Gruffydds children .
