        "text": "Was anyone’s waist really that tiny? When I see photographs of Victorian-era celebrities with “impossibly” tiny corseted waists, I usually assume — and can sometimes tell — that the photos have been doctored. (Yes, vintage movie studio glamour photos are often visibly altered, too, if you know where to look. Instead of using a computer, photographers used paint.)\n\nBut one night this week I happened on two YouTube videos which showed many, many photographs of the English Princess Maud of Wales, later Queen Maud of Norway. She was the daughter of King Edward VII and his beautiful wife, Queen Alexandra, whom she resembles. The videos show many photos of Maud’s exceptionally tiny waist.\n\nHere is Princess Maud with her husband Carl, later King Haakon.\n\nIt’s tempting to think the photograph has been altered, but . . . .\n\nThis video shows them riding bicycles; she seems to be wearing the same jacket. (If the video goes too fast for you to see the outfit, you can pause it and back it up.)\n\nHere, they are riding horseback.\n\nThe link will continue to the end of the video, but I recommend starting at the beginning of the five minute video photo compilation by Lost Splendour , which is my favorite, showing a wonderful range of fashions; Princess Maude was born in 1869, so she was a teen in the 1880’s, married in the 1890’s, became a mother in 1903, and remained chic and up-to-date in middle age. And there are too many images to deny that her corseted waist really was that small.\n\nMaude lived till 1938; I wonder whether she felt annoyance or relief at the fashions of the 1920’s? Here she is in the 1920’s. (There is a second picture of her, a few seconds later, in a striped twenties dress, with her dog on her lap.)"
