The British Princess who married a Danish Prince and became the first Queen of an independent Kingdom of Norway, Queen Maud possessed a spectacular Jewellery Collection composed of magnificent Heirlooms and spectacular Wedding Gifts!\n\nIn 1938, Queen Maud brought her jewels with her to England while she was having an operation, and where she passed away of heart failure. Queen Maud’s jewels remained in England, throughout the Norwegian Royal Family’s exile during the Second World War, and were only reclaimed during a visit for the Queen’s Coronation in 1953. Soon afterwards, her daughter-in-law, Crown Princess Martha passed away, and the Jewels remained in the vaults for years until the Norwegian Royal jewellery collection was divided up following the Wedding of then Crown Prince Harald in 1968.\n\nClick on the highlighted links/images below to see the article on each piece!\n\nQueen Alexandra’s Diamond Circlet\n\nOrigin: Inherited from Queen Alexandra in 1925\n\nNotable Appearances: King Haakon VII’s Silver Jubilee Gala in 1930 and The Coronation of King George VI in 1937\n\nCurrent Location: Now worn by Queen Sonja\n\nQueen Maud’s Pearl Tiara\n\nOrigin: A Wedding Gift from her parents, King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1896\n\nNotable Appearances: Official Portraits\n\nCurrent Location: Now worn by Queen Sonja\n\nQueen Maud’s Diamond Tiara\n\nOrigin: A Wedding Gift from ‘Lady and Gentlemen Friends’ in 1896\n\nNotable Appearances: The Coronation of King Edward VII in 1902\n\nCurrent Location: Worn by Princess Ragnhild and now returned to King Harald V and Queen Sonja\n\nQueen Alexandra’s Turquoise Circlet\n\nOrigin: Inherited from Queen Alexandra in 1925\n\nNotable Appearances: The Wedding Gala of Crown Prince Olav of Norway and Princess Martha of Sweden in 1929\n\nCurrent Location: Now worn by Princess Astrid\n\nVifte Tiara\n\nOrigin: A Wedding Gift from Alfred, Leopold, and Marie de Rothschild in 1896\n\nNotable Appearances: The State Opening of Parliament in 1901 and King Haakon VII’s Silver Jubilee Gala in 1930\n\nCurrent Location: Now worn by Crown Princess Mette-Marit\n\nRuby Aigrette Tiara\n\nOrigin: A Wedding Gift from ‘Lady and Gentlemen Friends’ in 1896\n\nNotable Appearances: Not worn in public images\n\nCurrent Location: Now worn by Princess Astrid\n\nQueen Maud’s Drapers’ Company Brooch\n\nOrigin: A Wedding Gift from the Draper’s Company in 1896\n\nNotable Appearances: The Devonshire House Ball in 1897, The State Opening of Parliament in 1901 and The Coronation of King Edward VII in 1902\n\nCurrent Location: Now worn by Queen Sonja\n\nQueen Alexandra’s Diamond and Pearl Brooch\n\nOrigin: Inherited from Queen Alexandra in 1925\n\nNotable Appearances: King Haakon VII’s Silver Jubilee in 1930\n\nCurrent Location: Now worn by Queen Sonja\n\nQueen Maud’s Diamond Brooch\n\nOrigin: A Wedding Gift from Prince Charles of Denmark in 1896\n\nNotable Appearances: Official Portraits in 1913\n\nCurrent Location: Inherited by Crown Princess Martha and now with Princess Astrid\n\nQueen Maud’s Pearl Bow Brooch\n\nOrigin: A Wedding Gift from the Lord and Lady Rothschild in 1896\n\nNotable Appearances: The State Opening of Parliament in 1901 and The Coronation of King Haakon VII of Norway in 1906\n\nCurrent Location: Now belonging to Princess Astrid\n\nQueen Maud’s Aquamarine Brooch\n\nOrigin: Unknown\n\nNotable Appearances: The Christening of King Harald V of Norway in 1937\n\nCurrent Location: Now worn by Crown Princess Mette-Marit\n\nQueen Maud’s Seed Pearl Choker\n\nOrigin: Unknown\n\nNotable Appearances: Official Portraits\n\nCurrent Location: With either Queen Sonja or Princess Astrid\n\nQueen Alexandra’s Diamond Link Choker\n\nOrigin: Inherited from Queen Alexandra in 1925\n\nNotable Appearances: Not worn in public images\n\nCurrent Location: Now worn by Queen Sonja\n\nShare this:"
