DEADSTRING BROTHERS

The Deadstring Brothers’ heart beats with pure rock and roll. Simple and shor ’nuff. Built on a the unshakable foundations of blues, rock country and soul, DSB manages to create something at once totally fresh but totally recognizable. It’s all ragtops and cold beer, seeds and stems, gatefold LPs and foxy girlfriends with tight, flared jeans. You can imagine them walking as a gang down Carnaby street in London in the late 60’s, or tearing up the stage at Cobo Hall in De-troit Rock City or sweating buckets at a Muscle Shoals recording session in the 70’s.

If mainstream radio played music like the Deadstring Brothers, they wouldn’t have to call it classic rock anymore, they’d just call it rock. It’s still here, and it sounds as good as ever.

Fronted by guitarist/vocalist and studio magician Kurt Marschke, the Brothers pound out a sound that, in comparison to so much lo-fi indie rock, is full and rich and sounds GREAT blasting out your car window. Joining Kurt in the band are longtime drummer and fellow Detroiter Travis Harrett, and the brothers Cullum—Spencer (guitar, pedal steel and slide guitar) and Jeff (bass). The Cullums, a couple of London lads, came into the Deadstring fold during a UK tour in 2006. Both were mainstays in the burgeoning Heavy Load scene built around a communal love of all things Stones, Crowes and Allmans. It was love at first jam and the boys joined up and bridged the waters between London and Detroit in time to record their 2nd album Silver Mountain.
