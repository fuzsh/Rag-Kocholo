        "text": "The Deadstring Brothers’ heart beats with pure rock and roll. Simple and shor ’nuff. Built on a the unshakable foundations of blues, rock country and soul, DSB manages to create something at once totally fresh but totally recognizable. It’s all ragtops and cold beer, seeds and stems, gatefold LPs and foxy girlfriends with tight, flared jeans. You can imagine them walking as a gang down Carnaby street in London in the late 60’s, or tearing up the stage at Cobo Hall in De-troit Rock City or sweating buckets at a Muscle Shoals recording session in the 70’s.\n\nIf mainstream radio played music like the Deadstring Brothers, they wouldn’t have to call it classic rock anymore, they’d just call it rock. It’s still here, and it sounds as good as ever.\n\nFronted by guitarist/vocalist and studio magician Kurt Marschke, the Brothers pound out a sound that, in comparison to so much lo-fi indie rock, is full and rich and sounds GREAT blasting out your car window. Joining Kurt in the band are longtime drummer and fellow Detroiter Travis Harrett, and the brothers Cullum—Spencer (guitar, pedal steel and slide guitar) and Jeff (bass). The Cullums, a couple of London lads, came into the Deadstring fold during a UK tour in 2006. Both were mainstays in the burgeoning Heavy Load scene built around a communal love of all things Stones, Crowes and Allmans. It was love at first jam and the boys joined up and bridged the waters between London and Detroit in time to record their 2nd album Silver Mountain.\n\n“Had Johnny Cash and Bonnie Raitt shared DNA, the result would be Sarah Potenza.”-Kansas City Blues Society\n\nSpecializing in original country/blues, Sarah & The Tall Boys is a Chicago-based Americana band that has been selling out venues across the country. Fronted by lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and lyricist, Sarah Potenza-Crossman, the band has been together for 4 years. It includes, bass player, Ian Crossman, lead guitarist, Dan Allen, and drummer, Jason Smart. Dynamic guitarist Dan Allen has been with Sarah since 2006, with her original group, The Sarah Potenza Band. Previous to that, Potenza-Crossman was featured on “Acoustic Chicago”, a compilation of the best singer/songwrittters in the windy city. In 2008, Sarah & The Tall Boys released their debut album, “Shiny & New”, a powerful collection of original songs, that drew attention from venues and festival producers nationwide. Within that year, the band was performing at festivals with acts like Joss Stone and the legendary Stevie Wonder. They have since participated in festivals which featured Bonnie Raitt and Alejandro Escovedo. Regulars at The Honky Tink BBQ in the heart of Chicago, the band began playing in premier hot spots throughout the city. In 2010, Sarah & The tall Boys released its second full-length album, “A Lifetime Worth of Sin”. A collection of Americana music, derived from blues, bluegrass, and alternative-country, all songs were written and produced by Sarah and the band, with the exception of one cover of Lucinda Williams. This CD features a talented list of notable guest musicians from such groups as The Hen House Prowlers, The Hoyle Brothers, and The Congregation. To capture a warmer and more authentic sound, the entire album was recorded on two inch analogue tape with a Studer track tape machine at Strobe Recording Studio in Humbolt Park, Chicago. Since the release of “A Lifetime Worth of Sin”, the album has reached #17 on the Freeform American Roots Radio Charts. Sarah & The Tall Boys have been touring nationally, playing an average of over 175 shows a year. Nate Dow, of the Boston Herald, remarks, “It has been said that Lucina Williams can blow the chrome off her streamline trailer. If that’s true, Potenza can blow the trailer right out of the lot.” Sarah & The Tall Boys have played for inmates at both the Cook Country Department of Corrections and the Dwight Women’s Correctional Facility. In 2011 the group was invited to perform on the main stage at the annual Rhythm & Roots Festival at Ninnigret Park in Charlestown, RI. It was there they shared stages with world-renowned musicians Steve Earle and Richard Thompson. In 2012 the group will be touring coast to coast including a another performance at the Rhythm & Roots Festival as well as a spot on the main stage at the Strawberry Music Festival in California. The Strawberry Music Festival also features performances by Allison Krauss, Jerry Douglas and Robert Earl Keen.\n\nThe Webbs are the blood of the motor city pumping through a country heart. Just as a spider web is a network of fine threads constructed to catch its prey, the Webbs weave a sound that will capture your soul. The band members have been honing their craft for over 20 years and have come together to create an old country/bluegrass sound with a dark side.\n\nThe Webbs’ vocalists croon sweet melodies backed by strong musicianship. The band consists of Andie Webb, Tracy Webb, Fredric Scott Leman, and Robert Rasmussen. The band members merge their unique influences to create something beyond your basic bluegrass. Andie”Twila Lark” is an experienced singer in the Honky Tonk blues tradition. Tracy is a music aficionado with strong southern roots. Fredric “Scotty Karate” is a proto-punk/alt-country legend that plays pure, soulful hillbilly rock music. Robert R on the guitar is a versatile sideman that adds sonic soundscapes and atmospheric backdrops.\n\nThe band’s relationship runs deep and is as strong as a river current. You can feel this closeness in the group’s chemistry and you can hear it in their music. Andie and Tracy are a married musical duo that have been collaborating for more that a decade. Scotty is a long time friend of the couple having known Tracy for nearly two decades. Robert has played music with Andie and Tracy for years. The Webbs lives are woven together – they have had trials and triumphs, which lead to a musical collaboration that will bring you to your feet in celebration, hold your heart as you feel emotion, and make you smile with delight."
