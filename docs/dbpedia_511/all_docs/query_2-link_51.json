Their music embodies the spirit of the human story with a nod to punk, the heart of folk, flavor of Polka, and bounce of swing, “turn[ing] out a style that might be what alt-country would be like today if it had been born in Green Bay instead of St. Louis....sassy horns and Meredith’s fiddle in gypsy-mode to comment on how truth and integrity have become quaint ideas in America (Twangville Music)”\n\nTheir debut record, More Than a Little (2016) was produced and guested by Mark Robertson, JD Wilkes (Legendary Shackshakers), Fats Kaplin (Jack White), Paul Niehaus (Calexico, Justin Townes Earle, Iron & Wine), selling 2500+ copies out the back of their 1994 carpeted Chevy Van, named “Martha.”\n\nTheir 2021 follow-up, Bad For Business, included the same cast from the last album and continued their “elements of klezmer, power pop, ska, New Orleans swing and a touch of blues rock just for good measure…with enthusiasm and oodles of charm…includes romantic joys and dramas, the vagaries of getting old and the theft of a keishka. Have fun with this one! (Paste Magazine)”\n\nIn the Fall of 2022, Adrian+Meredith went to Dial Back Records in Oxford MS to record a new EP, with the help of members from Squirrel Nut Zippers, Drive-By-Truckers, and Jimbo Mathus, while they continue to tour as a raucous four or five piece, with pedal-steel and/or horn section.\n\nThey’ve showcased at Folk Alliance International (2021, 2022, 2023), and selected by Daniel Lanois for his Uprise.FM streaming platform (2017). Festivals including Wheatland Music (MI), Portlands Folk Fest (OR), Mile of Music Festival (WI), Levitt AMP Pavillions, Waterfront Marquette Fest (WI), The Summit (NY), Blissfest Street Series (MI), Ahlen Fest (DE), Jazz paa Fejoe (DK). Touring along side acts like Legendary Shackshakers (US & UK), Jimbo Mathus, Cicada Rhythm, Pokey LaFarge, and Nathan Kalish (Deadstring Brothers). Come see what No Depression aptly calls “A barn-burner of Roots Rock Perfection!”\n\nSchedule\n\nFriday, August 30, 2024 @ 7:30 PM 08/30/2024 07:30 PM 08/30/2024 10:30 PM 15 Adrian and Meredith https://www.levittsteelstacks.org/event/16131/adrian-and-meredith/ Levitt Pavilion SteelStacks false\n\nVenue Information\n\nLevitt Pavilion SteelStacks\n\n645 E.
