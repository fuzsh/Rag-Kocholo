        "text": "It's virtually impossible to not like the Deadstring Brothers -- born in Detroit, with a British pedal-steel player and bassist, and based as of late in Nashville.\n\nThey ooze an \"Exile on Main Street\" Rolling Stones-meets-The Band-meets-rootsy-blues-somewhere-in-Music City approach which is at once infectious, country-hued, organic and downright lovable.\n\nA near-capacity crowd of about 150 learned that up close and personal Monday night when the band rolled into the snug and comfy confines of Grand Rapids' One Trick Pony for the latest installation of WYCE-FM's Hat Trick Concert Series.\n\nUnfurling material from their latest album, \"Sao Paulo,\" as well as songs from earlier recordings, the scruffy-but-charming outfit -- fronted by lead vocalist Kurt Marschke -- produced a pleasingly loud (for the One Trick) two-hour show that even raised more than $400 in pass-the-hat donations for a local charity, Carol's Ferals.\n\nIf you missed the show, don't fret: After a tour stop in Nashville, the band returns to Michigan for shows Sunday in East Lansing and April 16 in Detroit. (Details online at myspace.com/deadstringbrothers.)\n\nAnd Marschke told me during a break that the band hopes to start recording a new album in Michigan in the next few weeks, and certainly hopes to make another Grand Rapids tour stop down the road."
