The band, led by primary songwriter and vocalist Will Rideoutt, has been together for over five years, and has opened for the likes of Tab Benoit, Smokin’ Joe Kubek and B’nois King, the Deadstring Brothers and Larry McCray. Big Willy has performed at festivals around the state, as well as at local events like Festival on the Grand and the Old Town Blues Festival.

Michigan Ave, Lansing, 21 and over, 9:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.\n\nBlues punk & country rock\n\nThe Claudettes is a newly formed Chicago-based piano-blues band that not only echoes Ray Charles, but also the edgier sounds of the Minutemen and the SST-era Meat Puppets. The band, which plays Mac’s on Friday, features Johnny “Ig” Iguana, best known for his piano work in Oh My God, an organ-driven pop-rock band that stops in Lansing each tour. Ig has also toured/played with the likes of Van Morrison, Otis Rush, Junior Wells and Buddy Guy. Fans of alt-blues acts like Black Diamond Heavies and the Black Keys might want to check out The Claudettes.\n\nOpening the show is Flatfoot, a local alt-country fixture (think Flying Burrito Brothers, not Mumford & Sons). The band will play some old fan favorites, along with a few new tunes. Also sharing the bill is another Lansing-based alt-rock-country outfit, the Gentleman's Club. The band, which formed in January, features vocalist Norman Bates (formerly of Disinfect, a 1980s punk-rock band) and guitarist Fred Beldin (formerly of Lansing punk bands The Clutters and El Smasho). Gentleman's Club also features guitarist Matt Bour, and drummer John Olson.\n\nFriday Dec. 16 @ Mac’s Bar, 2700 E.

Fans of the Black Crowes, Journey, or Buck Cherry might dig this band.\n\nAlso making some noise at Uli’s are Ghost of August, Sevin and Citizen Zero. Hollow Drive will perform an acoustic set. For more information, visit www.waylandtheband.com.\n\nFriday, Dec. 16 @ Uli’s Haus of Rock, 4519 S. Martin Luther King Blvd., Lansing. 18 and over, $5 at the door, 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.\n\nDrinking Mercury, crappy endings at Mac's\n\nDrinking Mercury is one of the many bands on GTG Records, a local label known for churning out a stack of indie releases each year. While the band formed approximately a decade ago, “Orcades” is Drinking Mercury’s first legit album. The band features a line-up of veteran Lansing rock dudes, including guitarist Tommy McCord (also operates GTG Records), bassist Timmy \"Corncob\" Rodriguez, drummer Kevin Adams and vocalist Michael Boyes, who also plays guitar and ukulele. Warming up the stage is Forget the Times (Kalamazoo-based experimental rock) and Crappy Endings, a new Lansing-based punk band similar to classic acts like the Adverts, Undertones and the Buzzcocks. The band features vocalist/guitarist Travis McDonnell (formerly of X Offender), bassist Andrew “Lord Vapid” Lucas and drummer Scott Terrian (who’s also a member of Kalamazoo-based Legendary Wings). This will mark the local debut of Crappy Endings.\n\nSaturday, Dec. 17 @ Mac’s Bar, 2700 E. Michigan Ave., Lansing, 18 and over. $5, 9 p.m.\n\nRoadrunner Records rockers at Loft\n\nThe Parlor Mob has been busy touring from coast to coast since signing with Roadrunner Records back in 2007. The melodic hard-rock band is promoting its sophomore album, “Dogs,” a follow-up to 2008’s “And You Were a Crow.” The Jersey boys recently released a new single titled “Into the Sun.” On Saturday, the band plays The Loft, along with Ladynamite, The Rival, and Redbird. The all-ages show, hosted by Fusion Shows, also serves as the 94.1-FM The Edge Holiday Party. The Parlor Mob first began making a name for itself seven years ago under the name What About Frank? In 2007 the band changed its name to The Parlor Mob in order to “have a name that’s less hokey and more representative of our music,” said drummer Sam Bey in a New York Times interview.
