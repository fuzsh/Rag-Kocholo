Im spinning the Bros new album Sao Paulo right this second; what Im hearing is a band well-versed in denim-clad classic rock. Were talking vintage boogie laced with piano, organ and slide guitar. There are also touches of pedal steel and heartfelt choruses steeped in gospel, blues and whiskey. These last two elements do lend the music a countryish flavor. But its not as if rock-and-roll tradition has no claim on them. If Sao Paulo really is alt-country, then so are Exile on Main St., the Black Crowes, a lot of Aerosmiths early jams and hell, even Cinderellas Heartbreak Station. With Betsy Olson, Lizzie Huffman & Her Brother Band. JUSTIN F. FARRAR\n\nThu., June 3, 9 p.m., 2010"
