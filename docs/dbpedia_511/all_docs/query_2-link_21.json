        "text": "â€” There are bands doing tribute shows to The Rolling Stones, trying their best to sound like aging English geezers as they perform the Stones' classic rock. Then there are bands such as The Deadstring Brothers who can sound like the Stones without apparently even trying that hard. And the group can somehow sound like a particular era of Stones' music that some of us would contend was easily the best in the band's 40-some-odd-year career.\n\nIt's the Stones' classic album, Exile on Main Street, that many a fan and critic have alluded to when discussing The Deadstring Brothers, who actually have a pair of brothers in the band, along with something the Stones never had in their lineup, at least, officially: a woman.\n\nMasha Marjieh, who sings and plays percussion, has been in the group, not since its founding, but almost that long. Her unusual name is a combination of Jordanian and Russian names, but she is neither, she says.\n\n\"Half of us are from Detroit and the other three are from London, England,\" she says. Her Motor City cohorts areKurt Marschke, who handles vocals and guitar and most of the songwriting, and Travis Harrett on drums. The Brits are Spencer Cullum on pedal steel and guitar; his brother, Jeff Cullum, on bass; and Patrick Kenneally on piano and organ.\n\n\"I was sort of on the first record in 2002, but only as a backing vocalist. We did most of our touring in England, Scotland, Ireland and Holland for almost two years before heading to the States. All those countries are pretty small, geographically, and easier to getaround in.\"\n\nAfter the band's debut independent release, Bloodshot Records in Chicago took notice of the band and signed them, releasing Starving Winter Report in 2006 and Silver Mountain onOct. 9. The group has also been compared to The Band, The Faces and Gram Parsons.\n\nSongwriter Marschke's early influences were Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings, Marjieh says, and the band members were especially thrilled to have Nelson's longtime harmonicaplayer, Mickey Raphael, drop by to play on two songs on Silver Mountain.\n\n\"A friend of ours came and saw the band and said she had a friend, Mickey, and we said, 'Right, sure, whatever,'\" Marjieh recalls, \"but she got him to a show and he was so graciousand awesome, a funny guy. He did it because he believes in what we're doing. Or maybe he's just bored. It's always nice to see him, anyway.\"\n\nThe Deadstring Brothers mostly tend to their own original compositions, but both their Bloodshot releases have featured cover songs, with the latest one containing a Leon Russell composition (\"You Look Like the Devil,\" recorded notably by Nelson) and the 2005 album containing a version of The Band's \"Get Up Jake.\" And while the group's live shows might also contain a cover or two, don't count on hearing any Rolling Stones songs.\n\n\"We tried that once, with their song, 'Silver Train,'\" Marjieh says, laughing. \"It was fun in rehearsal, but we moved on. We've been resting 'Get Up Jake,' but we do 'The Shape I'm In,' another really groovy Band song, and the Allmans' 'Ramblin' Man' and Willie's 'Good-Hearted Woman.'\"\n\nBut the comparisons to the band of rich and aging Englishmen has yet to grow old for the Deadstring Brothers, she says.\n\n\"We don't get tired of hearing that, no. People need to hear comparisons, and it's not a lie. They're a great band to be compared with.\"The Deadstring Brothers 9 p.m. Saturday, Sticky Fingerz Chicken Shack, 107 Commerce St., Little Rock Opening act: Joecephus & the George Jonestown Massacre Admission: $7 (501) 372-7707"
