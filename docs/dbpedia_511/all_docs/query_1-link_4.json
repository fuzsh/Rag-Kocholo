        "text": "Born in suburban Detroit, the Deadstring Brothers have never followed the \"expected\" path of a Motor City rock band. Their roots lie in muddy country-blues and the twangy side of the Rolling Stones. But they have a Detroit heart: In their own way, they're every bit as punky as The Stooges, with the swagger of Iggy Pop and the MC5, the grittiness of Mitch Ryder, the soulfulness of Smokey Robinson and the garagey-ness of The White Stripes, even if their sound doesn't much resemble these other products of The D.\n\nOn its third album, \"Sao Paulo,\" the band continues its dusky journey into sin and redemption, the earthiness of life and the inevitability of death, with frontman/singer Kurt Marschke (a 1990 graduate of Mount Clemens High School) embracing the same kind of raggedness -- and passion -- that drove Mick Jagger and the Stones early in their careers. \"Sound Check\" today is featuring the subdued, countryish ballad, \"Always a Friend of Mine,\" which also features vocals by Masha Marjieh.\n\nOn Monday, the revised touring version of the band -- Marschke, Jason Lucia, Paul Hatchett and England's Spencer and Jeff Cullum -- plays One Trick Pony, 136 E. Fulton St. (an unusually intimate spot for this outfit) as part of the Hat Trick Concert Series sponsored by WYCE-FM (88.1). As usual, admission to the show is free but a hat will be passed to support a local charity: Carol's Ferals.\n\nLearn more about the show at wyce.org and more about the band at myspace.com/deadstringbrothers. And return to \"Sound Check\" Tuesday for a brief rundown and video from Monday's show."
