        "text": "With an ethos rooted in exploration, STS9 has been a sonic pioneer for two decades. Using electronic and acoustic means, the instrumental five-piece—comprised of Hunter Brown (guitar/keys), Jeffree Lerner (percussion), David Phipps (keyboards), Zach Velmer (drums), and Alana Rocklin (bass)—channels the primordial and celestial, producing a cutting edge sound that has forged a path for multiple generations of electronic dance music.\n\nSTS9’s innate sense of innovation is grounded by the group’s desire to forge universal connections. Seamlessly integrating their exploratory and improvisation-based music with a fully immersive light show, each performance is a transcendent celebration of humanity. The group continues to find ways to build community, consistently spearheading charitable efforts and founding its own independent record label, 1320 Records.\n\nHaving released twelve albums in the last twenty years, STS9’s legacy unfolds into the future. The group has been honored with induction into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame and earns headlining slots at countless music festivals across the country. With the help of the group’s dedicated fanbase, STS9 has performed countless shows nationwide and consistently sells out legendary venues like Red Rocks Amphitheatre.\n\nAfter over a decade of relentless touring and recording in all but complete obscurity, the Texas-bred quasi-collective suddenly found itself held up by the press and public as one of the major figures in the jazz world. But as the category names for all five of the band’s Grammy awards would indicate (Best R&B Performance in 2014, Best Contemporary Instrumental Album in 2016, 2017, 2021, and 2023), Snarky Puppy isn’t exactly a jazz band. It’s not a fusion band, and it’s definitely not a jam band. It’s probably best to take Nate Chinen of the New York Times’ advice, as stated in an online discussion about the group, to “take them for what they are, rather than judge them for what they’re not.”\n\nSnarky Puppy is a collective of sorts with as many as 20 members in regular rotation. At its core, the band represents the convergence of both black and white American music culture with various accents from around the world. Japan, Argentina, Canada and the United Kingdom all have representation in the group’s membership. But more than the cultural diversity of the individual players, the defining characteristic of Snarky Puppy’s music is the joy of performing together in the perpetual push to grow creatively.\n\nTheir latest Grammy winning album – Empire Central – was released in September 2022. Its sound is big and bold, chill and laid back, rooted in its native culture while reaching outward, forward bound. With 16 new compositions, the group looks fondly at where it’s come from, confident in the polished power from which its members continue to build the unique Snarky Puppy sound.\n\nTheir sound now rises like a skyscraper from a 21st century orchestra comprising three guitarists, four keyboardists, two brass, two reeds, a violinist, multiple percussionists and drummers and the accomplished, yet modest, Michael League keeping it all together with his bass.\n\n“Our soundscape has expanded dramatically over the years” says League. “When the band started, we were jazzier, brainy and music oriented. Moving into the Dallas scene we became groovier, more emotional, deeper in a sense. We focused more on communicating a clear message, understandable to a listener without dumbing things down”.\n\nAlways evolving in its musical output, each new record brings a new vision and progressive direction, “Snarky Puppy has always been a band that prioritizes the sound of music, our rule is that it can’t sound like it sounded before” comments League, he continues, “the music has to feel like it’s moving somewhere”.\n\nAnd moving somewhere it most definitely has. The Empire Central World Tour, which started in the USA in April 2022, has taken the band to 30 US States and 33 countries around the world. It’s incredible, although not at all surprising, how far Snarky Puppy have come since ten friends got together at the University of North Texas in 2004. It also raises the question – where will Snarky Puppy go next? For Snarky Puppy fans, the answer to this question is a very exciting prospect.\n\nTwenty-five years into their genre-defying electronic music career, Thievery Corporation’s founding principles of D.I.Y. and inclusion have become key themes in mainstream social conversation. After a dozen highly acclaimed full-length albums, remix LPs, concert recordings, and over two decades of incendiary live performances that have thrilled audiences worldwide, Thievery Corporation’s music and message is more relevant and important now than ever.\n\nThat lack of filter enabled Garza and Hilton to mine their musical inspirations and create one of the most unique bodies of work in electronic music, respectfully incorporating tastes of international cultural styles, without ever falling into the trap of cultural appropriation. “We always wondered: with so much incredible music in the world, why would anyone limit themselves to one genre? Well, we found out — it’s far easier to stay in one lane than to genre hop!” laughs Hilton. Garza elaborates: “When we started, we were influenced by music from all over the world, flipping through bins in second hand record stores for LP’s from Brazil, India, Iran, Jamaica, jazz records… we wanted to make music where you didn’t know whether it was recorded today or a decade ago.” Thievery Corporation’s music has always looked toward the future while paying homage to the past, starting with their groundbreaking debut LP, 1996’s “Sounds From The Thievery Hi-Fi,” which both introduced the world to Garza and Hilton as producers and set their course as pioneers of song-based electronic music with wildly diverse vocalists.\n\nThe band’s legendary D.C. headquarters, the Eighteenth Street Lounge, became an epicenter for a diverse group of people and staff from all over the world, which in turn had a profound influence on their musical output. “D.C. was very cosmopolitan, lots of places to see international live music and jazz,” says Garza. “We’d run into people from all over the world and invite them to play with us — so Thievery became an extension of that, both on our records and in our live performances.” Indeed, Hilton and Garza’s “Outernational” approach created a world reflected by the artist’s ideals of diversity and acceptance. “25 years after we started, it seems like the world is catching up,” Garza opines. “Social consciousness is more mainstream, awareness of the importance of inclusivity…it’s so encouraging to see so many people working towards these goals in America.” Hilton agrees. “Thievery is a reflection of who we are, it evolved from our musical tastes. Artists who were for the people, like The Clash, Fela Kuti, Manu Chao were so important to us, and engaging in social ideas has always been a part of what we’ve tried to do.” People don’t refer to Thievery Corporation as “World Music,” but it’s safe to say that their music and ethos is global in its scope and ahead of its time at every turn.\n\nIn a live setting, Thievery Corporation avoids any electronic dance music tropes. Yes, you’ll dance, sweat and put your hands in the air… but their concerts are true performances, with a killer band of players and an array of vocalists from diverse global cultures. No two shows feel the same. “Our shows are VERY live, lots of energy, the combination of multiple instruments and singers that take you on a musical journey,” says Garza. “We have a sitar player, songs are in different languages — it’s a multicultural experience, people connect to the band and to each other, it’s beautiful.” With a world cautiously beginning to emerge from isolation and towards communal events, Garza is eager to return Thievery Corporation to live performance. “I feel like people have been waiting to celebrate together after being forced apart for too long. We’re all craving that.”\n\nHistory doesn’t stand still. It impacts, influences, and inspires the ebb and flow of the future by informing the present. Galactic draw on 25 years together in order to progress with each performance and subsequent record. After 10 albums, over 2,000 gigs, and tens of millions of streams, the proud New Orleans, LA quintet—Ben Ellman [saxophone, harmonica], Robert Mercurio [bass], Stanton Moore [drums, percussion], Jeffrey Raines [guitar], and Richard Vogal [keyboards]—have kept the torch burning through five U.S. presidential regimes, the turn-of-the-century, Hurricane Katrina, a Global Pandemic, and a much-anticipated recovery. They’re the rare collective who can support Juvenile on Jimmy Kimmel LIVE!, contribute music to a blockbuster soundtrack such as Now You See Me, and light up the stages of Coachella, Bonnaroo, and New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (a staggering 22 times).\n\nJoined by vocal powerhouse Anjelika “Jelly” Joseph, they continue to forge ahead.\n\n“Jelly came to Fuji Rock in Japan with us to sing background with Macy Gray,” recalls Stanton. “We needed someone to sing one of our Galactic originals, and she stepped up. Since there was no time for rehearsal or soundcheck, she showed up prepared, knew the tune completely, and rocked it. When it came time to find someone new to sing with us, she was our first choice. She has such effortless stage presence and a very comfortable rapport with audiences. She also brings an element of unbridled fun!” That fun came across loud and clear on the 2020 single “Float.” Uplifted by Jelly’s powerhouse pipes, it hinted at the potential of their collective chemistry.\n\nThey laid the groundwork for this future upon coming together in 1994. Two years later, the guys dropped their full-length debut, Coolin’ Off, and hopped in a Ford Econoline van (with trailer in tow) for their very first official tour. Along the way, they released seminal albums such as 2007’s From the Corner to the Block, boasting collabs with the likes of Chali 2na, Juvenile, Trombone Shorty, DJ Z-Trip, and Boots Riley. During 2015, Into The Deep marked their first debut in the Top 25 of the Billboard Top 200 and second straight #1 bow on the Billboard Top Contemporary Jazz Albums Chart. Not to mention, it boasted the title track “Into The Deep” [feat. Macy Gray], racking up nearly 20 million streams and counting. Along the way, they performed alongside the likes of Dave Matthews Band, The Roots, Jack Johnson, Talib Kweli, the Allman Brothers Band, Widespread Panic, B.B. King, Counting Crows, James Brown, and many more. They’ve also recorded and performed with the likes of Allen Toussaint [“Bacchus”] and Big Freedia “Double It”]. Most recently, 2019’s Already Ready Already garnered acclaim from New York Times, NPR Weekend Edition, Exclaim!, and many more, while they’ve appeared on the covers of Downbeat and Relix Magazine.\n\nKDTU has electrified audiences around the world for over 25 years from the fields of Naeba in Japan at the infamous Fuji Rock Festival to the hallowed stage of Madison Square Garden where they previously joined the Dave Matthews Band and The Godfather of Soul, James Brown. From performing as Sexual Chocolate (Karl was in the original band in the movie Coming To America and its sequel) at the Outside Lands Music festival in San Francisco, to being the first late night act at the inaugural Bonnaroo festival, KDTU have been a dominating force in music for the past 25 years.\n\nAll-night, sold-out concerts during Jazzfest in New Orleans have featured sit ins by everyone from Lenny Kravitz & Steve Winwood (with whom Karl has recorded and toured) to avant garde luminaries Marc Ribot & Boyfriend. Chuck Leavell and Bernard Fowler (Karl’s bandmates in The Rolling Stones where Karl replaced the great Bobby Keys as saxophonist in 2014) have joined onstage and on record, as have Lukas Nelson, John Oates, Michael Franti, Warren Haynes, Ivan Neville, Anders Osborne, Big Daddy Kane, Roy Hargrove, Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, Joshua Redman, Marcus King, and Bernie Worrell, among others.\n\nTouring the country with the Allman Brothers, My Morning Jacket, D’Angelo, The Roots, Public Enemy, Bob Weir of The Grateful Dead, Parliament Funkadelic, Slightly Stoopid, Widespread Panic, very few concert goers have been untouched by the Tiny Universe live. In addition to KDTU, Karl Denson aka “Diesel” is a founding member of the seminal groove act The Greyboy Allstars.\n\nLETTUCE is (a) the prime ingredient in a salad, (b) a slang for cash, (c) a green herb that can be smoked, (d) a genre-busting six-member musical collective formed in 1992 by four alumni of the prestigious Berklee College Of Music, or (e) all of the above. If you answered “e,” then you’re in on the sheer magic of a band that both feeds the rich history of funk music and combines it with strains of hip-hop, rock, psychedelia, jazz, soul, jam, go-go, and the avant-garde.\n\nThe GRAMMY Award-nominated six-piece is comprised of Adam Deitch [drums, percussion], Adam “Shmeeans” Smirnoff [guitar], Erick “Jesus” Coomes [bass], Ryan Zoidis [alto, baritone, tenor sax, Korg X-911], Eric “Benny” Bloom [trumpet, horns], and Nigel Hall [vocals, Hammond B-3, Rhodes, clavinet, keyboards]. To date, their discography includes Outta Here [2002], Rage! [2008], Fly [2012], Crush [2015], the EP Mt. Crushmore [2016], the live album Witches Stew [2017], Elevate [2019], Resonate [2020], Unify [2022], and now VIBE – a single 48 minute continuous session of pure, free-flowing improvisation, available digitally for the first time.\n\nWith VIBE, Lettuce cement their status as boundary-pushing innovators over three decades into their lauded career, blurring lines and smashing up jazz chords, psychedelic passages, big horns, strains of soul and go-go, hip-hop elements for an uplifting, improvisational sound all their own. Ryan Zoidis explains, “we got into a vibe and hit record. 48 minutes went by like a blink of an eye. This is our first purely improvised recording. Nothing planned, nothing edited or overdubbed. This is a true spontaneous musical expression captured in its entirety.”\n\nAll together now… Lett us VIBE.\n\nLP Giobbi is a multi-talented DJ, producer, jazz-trained pianist and activist who is quickly rising to superstar status. Since emerging in the dance scene in 2018, she has performed her “one-woman jam band” DJ sets blending her decks with her live piano plus sampler at high-profile festivals including Coachella, Playing in the Sand, Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, Tomorrowland and more. She played a string of sold out afterparties for Dead & Company’s final tour across New Orleans, Chicago, Philly, New York City, Boston, Boulder and San Francisco. She’s also supported iconic artists like Diplo, DJ Tennis, Sofi Tukker and Pete Tong (opening up for him two nights at London’s O2 Arena and then sitting in with the Ibiza Classics orchestra on a grand piano to play a song she wrote with them). LP Giobbi’s music has amassed over 150M streams across platforms and is hotly tipped as DJ Mag’s Best Producer of the Year, Spotify’s EQUAL Ambassador, Spotify RADAR’s Artist to Watch, Amazon’s Artists to Watch and TIDAL’s Artist to Watch 2023.\n\nAs Giobbi’s profile continues to rise, she continues to grow and explore, improvising her way towards her own musical ideal. She began remixing Jerry Garcia and Grateful Dead music in her sets and after seeing how much of her young fanbase gravitated towards it, she knew there was something there that she could do to bring in a younger generation to this music and culture. “I love the jam band ethos,” says Giobbi, the daughter of two devoted Deadheads, who often appears onstage in one of an arsenal of Dead t-shirts. The Garcia Family caught wind of what she was doing, and was asked to do an official remix album for Jerry Garcia’s first solo album, Garcia, for its 50th anniversary, “I wanted to show this beautiful world to my community”. Garcia (Remixed) has received incredible love from the existing community, electronic community and this younger generation.\n\nWanting to change the statistic that only 2% of producers are women, she has provided thousands of female and gender-expansive individuals access to production workshops, online courses, and scholarship programs for LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC creators through her nonprofit FEMME HOUSE. They have also done stage takeovers at EDC and Hulaween Music Festival, as well as a Femme House Tour in partnership with Ableton that included in-person workshops during the day and booking all female/gender expansive lineups at night all across the US in 2022.\n\nLP Giobbi’s debut album, Light Places, released on May 12, 2023 on Ninja Tune’s imprint Counter Records stands as a comprehensive declaration to who she is as an artist. Here, she brings an organic freedom found in improvised music (from long-standing inspirations Bill Evans and The Grateful Dead) and spontaneous collaboration to incorporate core principles of simplicity to often intricate structures of dance music, making for a set of songs that simply feel good. The process of creating complementary tracks coincidentally widened LP Giobbi’s artistic lens to expand her production abilities beyond the confines of crafting standalone singles. This broadened space gave LP Giobbi room to peel back multiple meanings contained in a simple phrase (“If Love is A Skill (feat. Sofi Tukker)”), wield dynamic tom fills and distorted bass with intent (“Georgia”) and harness the never-ending power of love from friends and family (“All I Need”). By the end, the album feels like something greater than itself and will leave anyone who comes across it feeling like anything is possible.\n\nIf you ever wondered what “seizing the moment” sounds like personified, look no further than Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, the four-piece musical powerhouse known for their head-turning high-energy psychedelic funk shows. Infectious energy is an understatement.\n\nThe Maryland quartet — “Scrambled Greg” Ormont [vocals, guitar], Jeremy Schon [guitar, vocals], Ben [bass, vocals], and Alex “Gator” Petropulos [drums, vocals]—not only squeezes the juice out of every second, but they harness life’s energy within their hypnotic hybrid of funk, rock and psychedelic groove.\n\n“This album is a snapshot of our band as a group and as individuals,” notes Greg. “The title serves as a reminder that life moves fast, so we better make the most of each day, make each second count. 15 years as a band have flown by. We started in college and now we’re all growing up, most of us have even become dads recently, so we’re evolving both personally and musically, and we’re happily embracing those changes. That said, we still feel like kids when we’re getting wild on stage and know we always will.”\n\nThis forward motion has only accelerated over the years for Pigeons Playing Ping Pong. Renowned as a live tour de force, PPPP has tallied tens of millions of streams and performed to impassioned crowds everywhere from Red Rocks Amphitheatre and The Capitol Theatre to festivals such as Bonnaroo, Electric Forest, Jam Cruise, and more. Most recently, they earned widespread acclaim for 2022’s Perspective, a 12-track “funk-filled odyssey” as described by Relix. However, Day In Time saw them realize another level of cohesion in the studio.\n\n“This album is the most cohesive group of songs we’ve ever had in the studio,” says Jeremy. “On our previous albums, there were usually older songs mixed in with our newer material. However, all the tracks on ‘Day In Time’ really represent our current writing style and where we are as a band today.”\n\nA bevy of friends also joined the party. On the boisterous “Let The Boogie Out,” Here Come The Mummies’ horn section added healthy doses of funk and “truly decided to let the boogie out,” according to Jeremy. Ben “Smiley” Silverstein (The Main Squeeze; Smile High) shines on the titular “Day In Time” with a raucous keyboard solo, while keyboardists Joey Porter (The Motet) and Alric “A.C.” Carter (Tauk) join forces on the soulful “Overtime.” Carter also adds rich depth with keys on “Beneath The Surface,” while Jon O’Hallaron (Chalk Dinosaur) infuses rhythmic keys and electronic flavor on the instrumental standout, “Skinner.” Another first, all four members of Pigeons Playing Ping Pong take inspired solos on the same record.\n\n“With this being our seventh full-length album, we’re more comfortable in the studio than ever, which has given us the freedom to take some bigger swings reminiscent of our live shows.” notes Greg.\n\nIn the end, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong are certainly making the most of the moment, and they might just inspire you to do the same.\n\nAndy Frasco & The U.N. have long been the high-flying DIY renegades of the touring scene known and loved for their kaleidoscopic musical fusion and one-of-a-kind onstage audacity. Now celebrating their longevity, the band is shaking things up with L’Optimist (Fun Machine Records/Soundly), as its title suggests, Frasco’s most hopeful and enthusiastic collection thus far. A testament to Frasco’s wide-ranging influences and boundless energy, his band’s sixth released studio album sees the magnetic frontman continuing to chart his path of self-exploration and personal discovery through increasingly introspective lyricism and musical adventure. Songs like “Everything Bagel (Feat. Artikal Sound System)” and the deeply moving “Iowa Moon” touch on matters of the heart and mental health, emotional struggle and the sheer vulnerability of the human experience, all relayed through a wildly eclectic approach navigating funk, jazz, surf rock, blues, swing, gospel, reggae, exotica, and more with horn-blasted positivity and soulful power.\n\n“I fight depression every single day,” Frasco says, “and the only way to fight depression is through optimism. I try to write optimistic songs because optimism keeps me going. As humans, I don’t think we’re all that much different. Everyone needs a little optimism to keep going.”\n\nL’Optimist sees Frasco continuing to develop as a songwriter, band leader, and human being, his restless spirit giving way to something more firmly grounded yet no less adventurous. Having built a still-expanding career on forward motion, Andy Frasco remains positive in his determination to keep on keeping on, pushing himself and his music to grow and improve with every passing day.\n\nALO stands for Animal Liberation Orchestra—because music liberates the inner animal, of course. As liberated as they come, Zach Gill, Dan “Lebo” Lebowitz, and Steve Adams have certainly been at this a long time. The trio met while still pre-teens in Saratoga, California, where they quickly connected through their love of music and sound.\n\nIn junior high, they got the idea to put together a band for the eighth-grade talent show. Zach recounts the struggle of the emerging artist thusly:“It’s hard to get all the pieces right, you know, you’re chasing a dream and an abstract vision, and you’re going through puberty. It’s kind of a lot.” Lebo elaborates,“We met at a time in our lives where we were coming of age and craving identity. Music, and more specifically, our band, gave us a vessel with which we could “set sail” on the ocean of life”.\n\nAnd the rest is history, but history is always a crooked path. You end up where you belong, but the journey is never quite what you expected when you took the first step. 25 years in, Gill (keyboards, vocals), Lebo (guitar, vocals), Adams (bass, vocals) and “new-guy”- Bay Area drum legend-in-training Ezra Lipp (drums, vocals) have recorded their greatest work to date. Quite simply, this is what happens when the band doesn’t break up–the culmination of a lifetime of shared effort and camaraderie. Four master collaborators at the peak of their craft individually and collectively with nothing left to prove–near-telepathic cohesion.\n\nThese guys have played with everybody. From royalty like Phil Lesh and members of the Grateful Dead to SoCal surf-troubadour Jack Johnson, if the show happened in California, you’ll almost always find one of them in the corner of the shot and, sometimes, even in the center.\n\nBut you don’t really hear it all until you hear them together. And it urges repeat listening, because it’s a rich stew that only fully reveals itself with time, attention, a few tears, and a lot of love.\n\nALO call their music “jam-pop,”and the description is apt.Meticulously crafted, hooky and accessible compositions laced with improvisational departures in which they function as a single organism at once voice and consciousness. They’re always exploring, but never wandering. There is always intention, momentum, and a patience and confidence that can only be wrought from a quarter century of collaboration and water under the bridge.\n\nThe band’s new full-length album “Silver Saturdays” is a celebration of that crooked path, of having lived through a turbulent phase of human history, and of the winding road still to come.\n\nDragon Smoke formed in 2003 as a “Superjam” – part of the New Orleans Jazz Fest tradition of putting together a band of musician who don’t normally play together and just see what happens. With the dual vocals of Neville and Lindell, matched with the Galactic rhythm section, the band quickly realized, “We are on to something!”. The band has played during every Jazz Fest since its inception. This inception took place at the tiny smokey Dragon’s Den Bar, hence the name – Dragon Smoke.\n\nThe music centers around Lindell’s blue eyed soul, Neville’s funk and R&B, and Galactic’s groove. Besides annual trips to the West Coast the past 10 years, and a 2013 trip to the East Coast, this band has been strictly playing around New Orleans. With everyone in the band being a leader in their own, it is rare to get this band together. And when it does, it shows that these guys are really having FUN! From the interplay and communication between the members, you would think that Dragon Smoke has been touring for years.\n\nDragon Smoke is looking towards the future, with plans to write and record an album and to do more touring outside of New Orleans. So be on the lookout for the Smoke — IF YOU SEE SMOKE, YOU KNOW YOU WILL SEE FIRE!\n\nEric Lindell: Vocals/Guitar\n\nIvan Neville: Vocals/Keyboards\n\nStanton Moore: Drums\n\nRobert Mercurio: Bass\n\nThe sandy shores of Asbury Park, New Jersey are hallowed ground in the northeast; the rolling waves have ushered generations of venerated musicians to worldwide acclaim. Dogs in a Pile, an eclectic quintet, has emerged as the heir apparent to the town’s rich musical legacy. Merging funk, jazz, and rock and roll with psychedelia, the quintet presents a completely original vibe built on kaleidoscopic soundscapes eerily reminiscent of the days of yesteryear.\n\nThe Dogs employ a unified approach to performance and songwriting, crafting aural mosaics through adept instrumentation and humble precocity. As avid storytellers, they draw inspiration from personal experiences, balancing life’s foibles with ever-present youthful sanguinity.\n\nDogs began when Philadelphia University of the Arts guitar gun-slinger Jimmy Law began playing with young Joe Babick (drums), a student at the Count Basie Theater program in Red Bank, NJ. Lightning struck when they were introduced to Berklee School of Music student and bass player Sam Lucid, who immediately suggested fellow Berklee student and keyboard player Jeremy Kaplan. The addition of fellow Berklee student Brian Murray (guitar) in 2019 made for the quintessential final piece in the Dogs’ puzzle.\n\nA string of successful local shows drove the development of a massive northeast fan base, affectionately known as the Dog Pound. The band’s astronomical growth culminated in an epic, sold-out performance at the legendary Stone Pony in Asbury Park during the summer of 2021. Armed with a fresh batch of new material, Dogs in a Pile is taking its perpetually evolving testament to the Great American Songbook on tour in 2022, visiting plenty of new cities and spreading good music and good energy to good people along the way.\n\non a mission to share the light. Formed during an impromptu late-night jam at Jazz Fest 2012 in New Orleans, the relentlessly funky and soulful band believes in music as a higher power tapping into an energy that is simultaneously sexy and spiritual, with songs that will inspire audiences to dance, groove, make love or just stand there with goosebumps.\n\nThe trio hails from diverse musical backgrounds, races, and creeds. Female powerhouse Nikki Glaspie was Beyonce’s world-touring drummer for five years before she joined Ivan Neville’s New Orleans funk outfit, Dumpstaphunk. Bassist Nate Edgar of Groovechild and John Brown’s Body perfectly complements singer and guitarist Nick Cassarino who came from the Jennifer Hartswick Band and toured with Big Daddy Kane.\n\n“It’s my dream team,” said Glaspie, “each of us is a songwriter, so when we get together, everything becomes much stronger.” Beyond raw skill, Glaspie cites a deep spiritual connection as the glue that binds them together. “Music is what brought us together, but it’s the spiritual bond that makes us play so in touch with each other,” she explained. And at the core of their vibe is a deviously simple concept the healing power of love.\n\nAlthough the band members are based across the East Coast, they maintain New Orleans as their spiritual home, and the celebratory essence of that city’s music culture is audible in each performance.\n\nSimply put, something pretty magical is happening in this band, and they’re only just getting started. “We’re going as far as you can go on the planet Earth and playing music,” explains Glaspie, “I don’t know how many times we’ve said it we are so blessed.”\n\nTogether, The Nth Power wants to change lives through a message of musical love and understanding.\n\nSouthern Avenue, the high-voltage, roots-infused powerhouse hailing from the legendary musical haven of Memphis, Tennessee, has been setting stages ablaze since their explosive Stax Records debut in 2017. Boasting a magnetic energy and a soul-stirring repertoire, this dynamic ensemble has mesmerized audiences worldwide with their heart-pounding performances and emotionally charged compositions.\n\nTheir meteoric rise in the music industry is underscored by a coveted GRAMMY Award nomination for “Best Contemporary Blues Album” and multiple nods at the Blues Music Awards, where they are currently in the running for “Band of the Year” in the 2024 edition. In 2018, they clinched the title of “Best Emerging Artist,” solidifying their rapid trajectory to stardom.\n\nThe band, consisting of lead vocalist Tierinii Jackson, guitarist Ori Naftaly, keyboardist Jeremy Powell, drummer Tikyra Jackson, and the versatile Ava Jackson on vocals, percussion, and violin, forms a musical juggernaut. The harmonious blend of Tierinii, Tikyra, and Ava’s voices creates an unparalleled sound that resonates deeply with audiences, adding an extra layer of soulfulness to their performances.

Circling about bassist/composer Mike Rivard and drummer Dean Johnston, each Club d’Elf performance features a different line-up, drawn from a constellation of some of the most creative improvisers from the jazz, DJ, rock & world music scenes of Boston, NYC and beyond. The band’s music draws from a startlingly wide spectrum of styles, including jazz, hip hop, electronica, avant-garde, prog-rock and dub. Under the tutelage of member Brahim Fribgane (who hails from Casablanca), the band has absorbed Moroccan trance music which is now an essential part of the mix. Diverse audiences are drawn to Fribgane’s mesmerizing oud stylings, and Rivard’s commanding playing of the Moroccan sintir. Trance forms the central core of the Club d’Elf aesthetic, weaving together the band’s various influences.\n\nIn April 2022, the band released its latest album, ‘You Never Know’, which rose to #2 on the Relix chart. The record unfurls upon kaleidoscopic clouds of spiced smoke, shifting from chopped dub-jazz through trance epics that reimagine Boston as a city of bazaars. Club d’Elf pays tribute to the music and musicians who have been primary influences, with half the album being covers of Gnawa, Miles Davis, Joe Zawinul, Moroccan band Nass el-Ghiwane, and Frank Zappa. The other half consists of original music inspired by Rivard’s personal journey into darkness following a near death experience in the remote jungle of the Peruvian Amazon.\n\nPerhaps the only thing tighter than the three-part harmonies and masterful arrangements from Chris Brouwers (trumpet), Greg Sanderson (tenor saxophone), and Josh Schwartz (baritone saxophone), is the chemistry between The Horn Section.\n\nTogether for more than a decade, this trio brings a palpable energy to the live music scene. Whether performing at renowned festivals such as Bonnaroo and Peach Fest, or legendary venues along the likes of Red Rocks Amphitheater and The Fillmore, The Horn Section commands the stage and adds that ‘je ne sais quoi’ to each and every artist they join.\n\nAt their origin, The Horn Section were founding members of Turkuaz, a nine-piece funk outfit that released five studio albums and toured internationally during their tenure. It was during that time Josh, Greg and Chris honed their skills and built the teamwork and cooperation they became known for. As a horn section, they have performed across a wide range of musical genres, with artists such as Zac Brown Band, Umphrey’s McGee, Greensky Bluegrass, Big Gigantic, Galactic, Mike Gordon, and many more.\n\nThe Horn Section performs live and in-studio, including sit-ins, artist-at-large billings, custom horn arrangements, and anywhere else horns are needed. Call out a song onstage, or work with them to craft the perfect horn arrangement – they can handle either with poise and prowess. These three have a camaraderie that translates beyond their music, and they’re just getting started.\n\nSammi Garett is often recognized as the pink-donned prominent member of the Brooklyn, NY-based Power-Funk band Turkuaz (2012-2021). Her dynamic stage presence and powerful vocals were a major part of the band’s live shows and recordings. She contributed to many of the band’s albums, including “Digitonium,” “Life In The City,” and “Kuadrochrome.” The group headlined all over the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia, playing festivals like Bonnaroo, Bottlerock, Lockn’, Jam Cruise and Jazz Aspen Snowmass and stages such as Red Rocks, Terminal 5, The Fillmore and The Capitol Theatre.\n\nSammi is a graduate of Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts where she majored in Vocal Performance. She graduated from Berklee cum laude, an achievement that reflects her strong academic performance and commitment to excellence.\n\nAfter graduating, she continued to pursue her passion for music and established herself as a talented and versatile musician, collaborating with a wide range of artists. In addition to her musical pursuits, Sammi has also studied improv and sketch comedy at the Upright Citizens Brigade in New York City. A renowned comedy theater and school that has trained many of the top comedians and actors in the industry.\n\nCurrently, Sammi is on tour with her band Cool Cool Cool. A septet that formed in 2022 after performing together with the international touring act Turkuaz over the last 10+ years. Cool Cool Cool blends the best of Pop, Funk, House, Disco, and R&B to create a sound that is truly unique. With dynamic female-led vocals, a horn section that is tight and precise, animated synths that add texture and depth, and a rhythm section that lays down a wicked groove, this band knows how to deliver an electrifying performance.\n\nThanks to their strong connection and collaborative spirit, Cool Cool Cool delivers a truly unforgettable experience and sound. Cool Cool Cool will be touring the U.S. both as a headlining act as well as the supporting band for Talking Heads member Jerry Harrison of the Talking Heads and Adrian Belew (David Bowie, King Crimson) on their “Remain In Light” tour.\n\nAlthough currently a New Yorker, Grammy nominated guitarist Will Bernard’s unique voice was formed fro the most part from the rich cultural roots of the San Francisco Bay Area. Along the way he studied classical music, jazz, played in basements and coliseums, and absorbed the Bay Area Multi-Kultii, the New York downtown edge, and the loose funk of New Orleans. He has performed or recorded with Charlie Hunter, Stanton Moore, Robert Walter, John Medeski, Dr Lonnie Smith, Ben Sidran, Peter Apfelbaum, Jai Uttal, Tom Waits, Bill Laswell, Dr. John and a lot of other known and unknowns. Will can be seen working in a chameleon-like way to fit into his current habitat. His 2007 CD “Party Hats” as well as his 1997 collaborative project T.J. Kirk’s If Four Was One were both nominated for Grammys, and he is nominated yearly in Downbeat Magazine’s Critics Poll for “Best Rising Star” Guitar Player. Will is a regular fixture at New Orleans Jazz fest, Jam Cruise and other similar events, and has toured extensively in the US and Europe. Currently, Will performs with John Medeski’s Mad Skillet, Peter Apfelbaum’s Sparkler, Frequinox with Stanton Moore and Robert Walter, Club D’Elf, Brian Charette’s Mighty Grinders, Club Foot Orchestra, TJ Kirk spinoff Damn Skippy and the Will Bernard ’s Freelance Subversives and Pond Life. Will’s 11th record as a leader was released in 2022 on Dreck to Disk records and was on many best of 2022 lists. In 2023 Will released a duo record with SF clarinetist Beth Custer.\n\nTo watch Allie Kral perform is to witness a passionate mixture of musical styles, from J. S. Bach to Pink Floyd. Allie has a classical background of violin playing that began in 1988 when she was just 5 years old. Controversial to Allie’s roots, her true passion is rocking out and improvising. In 2000, Allie went to University of Illinois for violin performance, and found a new love for bluegrass music while frequenting The Canopy Club. A 2-year stint with band Green Mountain Grass took her to stage with improvised solos, touring the country and never looking back. A decade with Chicago-based bluegrass jam band, Cornmeal, taught Allie to solo with ears open, with endlessly changing musical styles and a team-player attitude.\n\nAllie’s excitement for music was nothing short of contagious and her passionate energy never-ending as she joined Colorado jamgrass pioneers, Yonder Mountain String Band, from 2014- 2022. Embracing her aural skills and heart-forward demeanor, Allie has now recorded on dozens of albums, and has played live with the most well-known bluegrass players out there and just about every jam band on the scene, including Widespread Panic, The Dead, String Cheese Incident, Moe, Umphrey’s McGee, Government Mule, Billy Strings, Dark Star Orchestra, Melvin Seals, Greensky Bluegrass, Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Glenn Tilbrook, Big Head Todd, G. Love, The Travelin’ McCourys, Leftover Salmon, Railroad Earth, The Infamous Stringdusters, Peter Rowan, Bela Fleck, Sierra Hull, Molly Tuttle, Jerry Douglas and Sam Bush. While moving her entire body with her playing, Allie’s mastered the ability to use her instrument as a voice. She sings melodies with her bow, mimicking an electric guitar with distortion and delay, and utilizes the space in her solos – claiming to be what she calls the sexiest part of playing music. No matter which genre Allie is playing, she continues to innovate ways to blend her violin seamlessly. Allie Kral is indeed a thrill to witness!\n\nSoul provider Nigel Hall is an artist who needs no introduction. Throughout his career, he’s built a mighty foundation of funk, onstage and in the studio, proving himself to be a true student of the music. His unique sound, built upon pages torn out of the golden-ages of R&B, funk and soul, have made him the musician he is today; an accomplished vocalist, keyboardist, studio musician, disc jockey, and member of the GRAMMY-nominated funk-jazz-soul-hip-hop-psychedelic-jam-experimental titans Lettuce. Legions of fans are already well in the know about Hall’s copious keyboard chops and powerful vocal style.\n\nNigel Hall grew up in Washington, D.C., in a highly musical family. His fingers touched the keys before he was even five years old and his ears were always wide open. “I grew up with records,” he said. “That’s why I’m obsessed. My father had a vast collection. I’d be in third grade with my Walkman and everyone’s listening to Ace of Base, and I’m listening to Return to Forever, Chick Corea’s fusion project with Stanley Clarke.\n\nSince relocating to New Orleans in late 2013, Nigel Hall has quickly made a name for himself among the city’s world-class music community. Offbeat enthusiastically welcomed Hall as “a perfect fit” for the vibrant city and its singular culture. The Times-Picayune’s review of his solo debut at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival the same year crowned him with a comparison to Southern funk godfather Art Neville.\n\n“It’s the best decision I ever made for myself in my life and musically,” Hall said of the move. “I’m surrounded by the most amazing, incredible musicians in the world at all times. The big picture, the sincerity is very present here at all times. It’s a breath of fresh air. Everybody’s in the vibe. Everybody’s feeling something.”\n\n“I like to sing songs that reflect my being and who I am as a person,” he said.\n\nOriginally from Bristol, RI, Eric Bloom has become one of the most diverse trumpet players in the country.\n\nHe has attended William Paterson University(1999), New England Conservatory of Music(2001), and City College of New York(2004). Throughout his professional career, Eric has toured in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and Asia with various artists. He has also appeared on many T.V. shows, including the Craig Ferguson Show, the Carson Daly Show, Jimmy Kimmel Show, the Today Show, the David Letterman Show, and the Conan O’Brien Show.\n\nIn 2011 Eric joined “Lettuce”, one of the most critically-acclaimed funk bands in the world today. Their last album “Crush”, released in 2015 was widely received amongst musicians and fans alike. In 2014, EBB moved to New Orleans and quickly made a name for himself in the Crescent City. In 2016, he played trumpet on Aaron Neville’s newest album, “Apache” and also won a Grammy for playing trumpet on Jon Cleary’s latest album, “Go-Go Juice”. When Eric is not on the road with “Lettuce”, he can be seen performing around New Orleans with a number of artists ranging from the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra, Preservation Hall, Stanton Moore Trio, or his own groups Sonic Bloom and Eric Benny Bloom & The Melodies.\n\nSome of the artists Bloom has played & recorded with are: Redman, Method Man, Chad Hugo, Schoolboy Q, RZA, Dave Matthews Band, Dr. John, Pharohe Monch, Meshell Ndegeocello, Talib Kweli, Questlove, Mark Whitfield, Ledisi, Solange Knowles, Ghostface Killa, David Hidalgo, Thievery Corporation, Booker T, Maceo Parker, Jimmy Herring, Warren Haynes, James Poyser, Derek Trucks, Diane Birch, Christian McBride, Lonnie Smith, Karl Denson, Butch Trucks, Taj Mahal, Galactic, Avishai Cohen, Bill Evans, Bernie Worrell, Fred Wesley, Alan Bernstein, John Medeski, Charles Bradley, Billy Martin, Slightly Stoopid, Doyle Bramhall II, Chaka Kahn, James Gadson, Willie Weeks, Jon Cleary, Gary Clark Jr., Jeff Bradshaw, Bob Weir, Skrillex, Griz, John Scofield, Govt Mule, Bill Kreutzman, G.

As a teen, he attended the prestigious Berklee College of Music five-week summer program after junior year in High School, and returned the following summer where he connected with the guys who would go on to form the band Lettuce. After a year at Berklee, he joined rising Portland band, Rustic Overtones with whom he toured extensively. Soon after, they signed with the iconic Clive Davis at Arista Records, and made a record with longtime David Bowie collaborator Tony Visconti, with two songs contributed by Bowie and another by British singer Imogen Heap.\n\nIn 2002, Lettuce released their debut full length LP Outta Here, followed by the live record Live in Tokyo in 2004. The realities of the music industry’s digital revolution then motivated Zoidis to seek different challenges, so he moved to NYC and began touring with organ trio Soulive (featuring Lettuce co-founder Eric Krasno). In addition to recording on Krasno’s record Blood from a Stone, Zoidis gigged with Soulive in various combos for several years, having the opportunity to perform with Stevie Wonder, Chaka Kahn, and dozens of other legendary artists. Meanwhile, Zoidis appeared on New Orleans’ pianist Jon Cleary’s Grammy Award-winning LP Go Go Juice, as well as critically acclaimed releases from the likes of J-Live, Aaron Neville, Talib Kweli, and The New Mastersounds. Zoidis continued to sporadically record and tour with Rustic Overtones and did session work out of New York City – including recording and mixing Royal Hammer’s My Bubble.\n\nZoidis’ focus then returned to Lettuce as they prepared their sophomore LP RAGE, released in 2008, on which Zoidis plays a Korg synth in addition to the saxophone. On the heels of that album’s success, Lettuce hit the road in support of RAGE, and haven’t looked back. The GRAMMY Award-nominated six-piece is comprised of Adam Deitch [drums, percussion], Adam “Shmeeans” Smirnoff [guitar], Erick “Jesus” Coomes [bass], Ryan Zoidis [alto, baritone, tenor sax, Korg X-911], Eric “Benny” Bloom [trumpet, horns], and Nigel Hall [vocals, Hammond B-3, Rhodes, clavinet, keyboards]. To date, their discography includes Outta Here [2002], Rage! [2008], Fly [2012], Crush [2015], the EP Mt. Crushmore [2016], the live album Witches Stew [2017], Elevate [2019], Resonate [2020], Unify [2022], and VIBE [2023]– a single 48 minute continuous session of pure, free-flowing improvisation. As an engineer and producer, Zoidis also has credits for mixing Resonate, Unify, and Live in Amsterdam by Lettuce. As the saxophonist of Lettuce bandmate Adam Deitch’s Quartet side project, 2019’s Egyptian Secrets and 2023’s Roll The Tape round out his recorded catalog.\n\nCliff Porter started as and still is a drummer.
