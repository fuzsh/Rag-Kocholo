        "text": "Chicago is not just one of the biggest cities in America, it's been home to some of the best independent record labels over the last half-century. From 1950s start-ups like Chess, Vee Jay and Mercury to more recent marques like Drag City and Thrill Jockey, Windy City labels are always reliably setting trends in various genres. High Noon Saloon on Saturday, August 22.\n\nEven though Madison is one of the smallest cities on the tour, label co-founder Rob Miller says it was a natural choice. \"Madison was the first city outside of Chicago to ever pay attention to Bloodshot,\" he explains. \"The Old 97s found an early audience there. Spent many a night on I-90 driving back at 5 a.m. from wildly successful shows. All our bands would play there. Unlike my college town of Ann Arbor, there is still a strong indie retail component, great radio and music savvy fans who support weirdo labels like us.\"\n\nBloodshot fans are likely preparing to make a day of it at the birthday party on August 22; doors open at 3 p.m., with music beginning at 4 p.m. and continuing all night long. It's also a recession-beating special free show, giving listeners a chance to check out some bands they might have missed in the past and some favorites who haven't hit town in awhile. If you haven't already picked up a ticket or signed up for the guest list, though, you could be in trouble; the RSVP list is already at capacity.\n\n\"We have to call it sold out,\" said Miller on Wednesday. \"If people want to come, I am sure there will an ebb and flow of people all afternoon and night, so there may be times when they are below capacity and will let more in.\"\n\nVisual art by Bloodshot musicians will also be a part of the Madison Beer-B-Q. A traveling show coordinated by at 4 p.m.: A new collaboration between Deano Schlabowske (of Dollar Store and the Waco Brothers) and members of the Meat Purveyors. You can hear a sample of their efforts right now for free at Deano's website; hopefully this album will see a proper release sometime soon, because it's an excellent slice of sometimes hazy, yet always pointed country sounds.\n\nat 7:45 p.m.: Hey, guess what -- the Bottle Rockets also have a brand new record out, making 2009 a better year already. The band has been around just a bit longer than Bloodshot, releasing their first album on long-gone East Side Digital in 2003. The band is also one of the few still-active originators of the alt-country movement, an amazing feat when considering their backstory of bad luck with record labels during their first decade. Thankfully, it appears they have found a steady home at Bloodshot. The new album Lean Forward reunites them with producer Eric Ambel, and finds the band's ability at chronicling the people and places of working class America in top form.\n\nThe Deadstring Brothers at 9 p.m.: Sonically of a combination of early-'70s Rolling Stones and a more rural slant, the band features players with Detroit and London roots.\n\nWaco Brothers at 10:15 p.m.: Originally formed by Mekons member Jon Langford to more directly explore his interest in country music, the Waco Brothers has since taken on a life of its own through a series of straight-talking albums and legendary live shows. It's a rare opportunity these days to see them without driving down to Chicagoland.\n\nJustin Townes Earle at 11:30 p.m.: Those still standing post-Wacos will be treated to the effortless-sounding swing and smoky ballads of the talented offspring of Nashville rebel Steve Earle. J.T. Earle also recently released his second album, \"Midnight at the Movies,\" and its' blues-inflected Americana gradually works its way into your head.\n\nWith the rapid rise of digital formats and transmission models leading to reduced sales of physical media, the modern recording industry has transformed rapidly into an unpredictable frontier. Combined with the shaky economy, that's led to trouble for even major indies like Touch & Go, which dropped its manufacturing/distribution deals with other labels earlier this year. Miller says he can't make any clear predictions about where Bloodshot is headed in the future.\n\n\"I am no closer to being able to answer that question than the first time it was posed during our five-year anniversary,\" he explains. \"I want to be able to walk into the office and not be embarrassed by our catalog. I want to continue to put out music that I find entertaining and interesting and compelling. Why else do it? There are 6,000 easier ways to make a living. I hope, beyond our survival, our culture will decide that music -- and writing and photography and films -- have value. Right now, I am not so sure.\""
