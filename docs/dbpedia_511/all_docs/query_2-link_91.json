        "text": "Last week the current King of Americana Music Jason Isbell got fans jazzed by releasing a 30-second teaser video (see below) for his upcoming, but still-unannounced Dave Cobb-produced album that promises to feature a bit more of a rock vibe than previous efforts. Though we have no hard release date or title yet, we have both for a live studio album.\n\nA recent study by ICM Unlimited says that many of the people who purchase vinyl records actually have no intention of ever listening to them. Some of these consumers never use their turntables, and some don’t even have turntables at all. It’s more about simply owning the physical product, supporting their favorite artists, or perhaps even an element of fashion to own vinyl that’s driving the market.\n\nAs an offering for Record Store Day’s upcoming Black Friday releases, Johanna and Klara Söderberg have covered Simon & Garfunkel’s iconic tune “America,” written by Paul Simon. A master work of the American songbook, the song peerlessly encapsulates the forlorn beauty of youthful restlessness and underlying abject fear that are an indelible part of the American experience.\n\nAfter decades of overall downsizing in the vinyl industry, the current largest vinyl manufacturer in the United Sates called United Record Pressing based in Nashville, TN has announced they are expanding to a second location, and spending $5.5 million to acquire the new space. It will add 16 new presses to the country’s vinyl manufacturing infrastructure.\n\nThe simple fact is that Record Store Day is failing in many respects, and has been doing so for a number of years. As with so many things in independent music, Record Store Day started with an excellent, virtuous, and brilliant idea that was so good, it sparked an international event transpiring on an annual basis. But like so many of these great ideas, it was quickly co-opted by corporations.\n\nalarming accounts are coming in from witnesses and police all across the country as Record Store Day 2014 turns violent in many of the independent record stores the day is meant to promote. In multiple instances, vehement vinyl listeners are resulting to violence in order to obtain their favorite sought-after Record Store Day rarities.\n\nOriginally cut in Nashville in 1996 and sitting on the shelf ever since, Old 97’s & Waylon Jennings is a remarkable little gem unearthed these many years later, offering a window into a time right before Waylon’s health began to fail him, and right as the Old 97’s were rising in the alt-country tide alongside bands like Wilco and Whiskeytown.\n\nThis Saturday, April 20th is the 2013 installment of Record Store Day. 2013 has some juicy releases, including some super rare Willie Nelson demo sessions, a split with Waylon Jennings and the Old 97’s, some cool live albums from Gram Parsons and Sarah Jarosz, and a re-issue of Justin Townes Earle’s first album, the Yuma EP.\n\nThis Saturday, April 21st with be the 2012 installment of Record Store Day, the annual event started in 2007 to help the struggling independent record store. 2012 will go down as the year when country came busting through the Record Store Day scene with full representation, with so many projects being released taking stock of it all can be dizzying. So here is your 2012 Country Music Record Store Day Field Guide.\n\nI’m not one to chase every single limited-release 45 rpm put out by my favorite bands–that can get expensive quite quickly–but since we are nearing Record Store Day where the 7″ limited-release reigns supreme, and this little gem was thrown in my lap, I thought I would tell you about it’s virtues, and by proxy, the virtues of the single-sized vinyl format for those still perplexed why technology has regressed to move forward.\n\nCountry music might ignore Record Store Day (RSD) this Saturday (April 16th), the worldwide event that has become an international holiday for audiofiles, but Saving Country Music won’t. Neither will Bloodshot Records, who has a number of releases and events planned for the day meant to prop up the ailing mom and pop record store.\n\nCountry has been the very last of the major genres to embrace the revitalization of vinyl, with one exception: Hank Williams III, who has been releasing his records on vinyl for years, and has his full catalog available in the format. In conjunction with Record Store Day this year, 700 limited-edition colored vinyl copies of his albums…\n\nFirst: On Friday I got my much belated, but much anticipated Metal Farm Magazine in the mail! Now I knew there was going to be pictures of Hank III done by Keith Neltner and Reinstate Hank Williams content, BUT NOBODY TOLD ME ABOUT THE HOT CHICKS!!! Dude, there are hot women in their skivies in […]"
