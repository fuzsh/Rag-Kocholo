        "text": "A new city (from Detroit to Nashville) and a new lineup sees Deadstring Brothers’ Kurt Marschke moving into the songwriting limelight, stepping back a bit into that dusty and cool world created by classic, but still modern, blues and folk-steeped rockers, The Band and the Rolling Stones.\n\nMarschke spoke of his rolling back to the rootsier side of things to No Depression recently in light of Deadstring Brothers’ most recent release, Cannery Row [Bloodshot Records]. ” I definitely knew that the record was going to be based more around acoustic instruments because that’s what I was playing. I was writing on my National Resonator and my old Martin flattop. I really was interested in slowing the pace of the record, and I didn’t feel a need to make a rock and roll record. I was just focused on making songs.”\n\nThe more easygoing and classic appeal that Cannery Row has has likewise appealed to the band’s fans. The Alternate Root writes, ““Long Lonely Ride” puts the top down to let its Stones style Alt Country blare, “Lucille’s Honky Tonk” sits for about thirty seconds on the front porch before heading down to the road house and “Oh Me Oh My” wraps its Americana with Hammond organ arms to hold you and Sneaky Pete style pedal steel to lift you off the ground.”"
