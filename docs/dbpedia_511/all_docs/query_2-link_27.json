        "text": "The sound of the Deadstring Brothers regularly draws comparisons to “Exile on Main Street.” Somehow, that isn’t quite right, though.\n\nAlthough the “Exile” album certainly reeks of America, The Rolling Stones came from England. To describe the thoroughly American milieu of the Deadstring Brothers in terms of a British rock band must surely be off the mark.\n\nThe group operates within the general field of “Americana,” which has come to mean a blend of rock and country, with shades of bluegrass, blues and gospel.\n\nThe Deadstring Brothers perform Friday at The Livery in Benton Harbor. Don’t expect many fancy chords.\n\n“If you complicate that music, then it’s just not that music anymore,” Kurtis Marschke says by phone as the group prepares to leave Cleveland for a gig in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Deadstring Brothers’ singer, guitarist and songwriter, Marschke has established a reputation in the Americana scene for his steadfast dedication to the music’s history, as well as for his willingness to make new contributions to it.\n\n“If you’re writing in a traditional form, there has to be something that you’re adding to it, so that it doesn’t sound completely dead,” he says. “There’s always somebody who’s able to put a bend on something, and add that personality.”\n\nThe band fits right in with the tone of its label, Bloodshot Records, whose releases by artists such as the Bottle Rockets and Wayne Hancock tend to come with plenty of whiskey-soaked drawl.\n\nThe newest Deadstring Brothers album is titled “Cannery Row,” but it’s not a reference to the John Steinbeck novel about life amid the fisheries in Monterey. Instead, it was inspired by the Cannery Row neighborhood in Nashville, Tenn., where Marschke lives during the rare times the band is not on tour.\n\nHe says that in the years he has been living on Cannery Row, he has seen the city encroaching on the old neighborhood’s traditions. In this case, the threat is not that the area will become a ghetto but rather that prosperity comes with its own drawbacks.\n\n“Money is pouring into that part of town,” Marschke says. “For the past two years, they’ve been building this massive convention center (adjacent to Cannery Row.)”\n\nWhen he moved in, Marschke found the place to be largely unchanged by time, but he now sees the area undergoing a fundamental upheaval. “Cannery Row” is not a concept album as such, but its major themes involve memories, traditions and change.\n\nThe band’s work has been consistent and focused since its inception in 2003, with no experiments in any field outside pure American sounds and images.\n\n“We’re doing something that has merit, and there’s a culture behind it,” Marschke says. “I’m not interested in doing some crazy art project.”\n\nWhen the group delves into gospel, the effect on the audience can be powerful, turning a gig at a honky-tonk into a kind of secular liturgy. The Deadstring Brothers’ arrangement of “Unclouded Day” has become a frequent feature at the end of concerts. The song, generally attributed to an itinerant preacher named J.K. Alwood, is a blissful, almost apocalyptic vision of heaven.\n\n“It’s one of those songs that, when it’s performed properly, everyone responds to it on some level,” Marschke says.\n\nHe notes that he’s observed that many of the Deadstring Brothers’ fans are former devotees of indie-rock. Marschke surmises that people reach a certain age and begin to embrace the straightforward storytelling of roots music. He’s seen the pattern over and over.\n\n“As soon as people discover the Carter Family, it’s usually all over,” Marschke says. “They’re done. Hooked. They’re on the path.”"
