He was exposed to all types of roots and rock music while growing up in Mississippi and understood early on that music exerts a strong gravitational pull.\n\nArmed with a degree in marketing, he moved to Charlotte, NC, scouring the landscape for a music business position that would allow him to work with, and for artists in a meaningful way. He found that at Intrepid Artists. “I took on a lot of responsibility very quickly, handling booking for a large roster of artists in the northeast United States and Canada. Ultimately he became steeped in every aspect of the business. Nashville’s burgeoning music scene dictated Stewart’s move from Charlotte and makes Music City the perfect home for Stewart Entertainment, LLC. “I see a tremendous opportunity today for artists who have trustworthy human resources in place.”\n\nList of Artists Brad has worked with:"
