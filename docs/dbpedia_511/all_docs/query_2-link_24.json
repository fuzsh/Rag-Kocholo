        "text": "Hailing from Detroit, Michigan, Deadstring Brothers are forging their own imprint far removed from anything remotely close to what we've been conditioned to expect from the Motor City. While their hometown counterparts follow Iggy Pop's footsteps so closely they're practically ripping the skin off his heels, Deadstring Brothers style embraces a sound from somewhere far beyond the Wayne County line.\n\nStarving Winter Report,\n\nDeadstring Brothers debut Bloodshot release, pulses with exuberant arrangements painted with the nostalgic call of the Rhodes piano, Stax-worthy horns and lonesome-prairie pedal steel. Frontman Kurt Maschke's warm and rolling lyrics and rock chanteuse Masha Marijieh's sultry vocals are the spine of the band; sustaining vocal harmonies so sweet and inseverable a\n\ncrowbar couldn't pry them loose. It's an album with an undeniable flair that cries out for some big speakers, a Detroit rag top with a case of Stroh's in the trunk, and a reason to get good and GONE.\n\nDeadstring Brothers have toured just about every pocket in the UK and have tackled the Midwest scene here in the states,\n\nsharing bills with big wigs like the Sadies, My Morning Jacket, Cat Power, Jesse Sykes, and Drive By Truckers.\n\nFor more information and mp3's, go to: http://www.bloodshotrecords.com/album/deadstringbrothers/198\n\nEvent submitted by Eventful.com on behalf of BSHQ."
