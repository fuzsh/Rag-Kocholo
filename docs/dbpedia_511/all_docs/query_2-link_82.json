        "text": "Different Folk Records is proud to announce the release of Sioux Falls/SD duo Sun Daze's debut album \"Deserted\" on Friday December 3rd. \"Deserted\" will be available on all digital platforms and vinyl (pre-order here.)\n\nWes Eisenhauer and Brandon Phrommany comprise Sun Daze. Eisenhauer hails from the rap & electronic groups Soulcrate Music & Later Babes, and Phrommany performs solo as Juke the Tiger and with Tenenbaums.\n\nSun Daze emerged as a joint project between Eisenhauer and Phrommany in early 2020. Recorded entirely on Eisenhauer's Macbook, the duo worked together to write and record the album at Eisenhauer’s studio which is home to his production company - Kickturn Studio.\n\n\"It was a really fun process to collaborate with Brandon on this project. We started passing ideas back and forth via email while we were all stuck at home in March of 2020, but when we eventually got in a room together and really started working the songs just flowed out of us effortlessly. We're both really proud of this album we created together.\"\n\n“Deserted” was mixed and mastered by Eisenhauer’s long time collaborator Corey Gerlach.\n\nFollow Sun Daze on Instagram, Facebook, and Spotify.\n\nThe track “Sitting Quietly Doing Nothing” came from harmonic ideas I had been working and practicing for some time -- nothing profound or amazing, just colors I liked. Then I freely used those ideas to see what happened. The tracks on Side B of the vinyl all came from this sort of process. Lots of sketches are still around of ideas that didn’t totally grab me -- I wasn’t sure these ideas would work either -- but the band has a way of making the tunes what they are.\n\nOriginally I had no intention of there being a theme or story for Side A of the record. But one day as I was getting my mail I heard a really distinct bird call. Which is the opening interval of the record, a minor third. It was so loud and resonant and beautiful in my head that I immediately went into my studio and started using it to meditate and improvise on. The weird thing is I had never heard that call before, nor since, and I can’t find an answer to what bird that may have been. I must’ve been hearing things, but it was loud and clear in that moment!\n\nThe first and fifth tracks are inspired by that call -- “Bird Ritual Interrupted” is supposed to represent two birds calling and courting each other. Underneath you hear the “Hawk” enter the scene, and at the end he attacks, killing the male. Track two is a representation of that hawk. In our neighborhood we get hawks, I’ve seen them go after birds and rabbits and other animals, sometimes they are successful. It’s amazing to watch!\n\nAfter seeing the artwork that Anna Youngers did of the European Starling that we used for the cover, I was all in for the bird theme on Side A. The next thing I visualized were a group of crows, witnessing the event that took place between the two birds and the hawk. I imagined those crows in the old Disney movie “Dumbo,” watching and commenting on what’s happening. Each member of JAS Quintet is a different crow. Silly perhaps, but I found it kind of fun thinking that way.\n\nThe last full song on Side A is “Sparrow”, a lament coming from the female bird character to her lost love. Jami Lynn wrote the lyrics to the song and sang them. It turned out even better than I could have ever expected, and Jami’s always incredible.\n\nAll of this being said, I wouldn’t want to force any notion on anyone to listen a certain way. If you imagine what I imagine and it works and it is enjoyable that’s awesome. If you just listen and don’t imagine anything but still enjoy it, that’s great as well. I just hope you enjoy the album. Thanks for listening.”"
