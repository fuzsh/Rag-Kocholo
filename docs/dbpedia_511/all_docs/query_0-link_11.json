        "text": "(review by guy salvador)\n\nBarfly does the usual of advertising a 7 o’clock opening time, you turn up at half past & it’s not open yet! Not much of a problem as you get to go over the road to the “Rummer Tavern” for a couple of swift brews to start the evening. Incredibly quiet in town tonight, maybe because it’s the first day back to work after a long bank holiday weekend? Rolled into Barfly just before 8.30, in time to see “Christopher Rees” take stage. First time Chris has played in Wales for a while, with recent tours to New Zealand & Canada in the bag. The lone bluesman is obviously keen to get back onstage. Also, tonight being a special gig for him on his birthday (23rd I think) so, lots of his mates turn up to add atmosphere to a fairly quiet Tuesday night Barfly. If you weren’t there you missed a real treat. Chris Rees is a quality singer / songwriter & no mean guitarist. Changing between, Acoustic & Semis throughout the set he has great control over the sound, providing rhythm & harmonics concurrently, to accompany his ever improving vocal. If you are familiar with Chris’s recorded work the vocal improvement between his first & second album is recognisable, a trend that he seem’s to be continuing judging by his live work, will be interesting to hear his next recorded work. Tonight’s set was, a mixed bag of blues & country, all delivered with a great sense of humour, even the most tragic blues are sung with a seeming tongue in cheek. I was familiar with the majority of material played with definitely one new song thrown in for good luck. A relatively short support set eagerly appreciated by tonight’s audience & myself. To end…. I suppose you have figured I like Chris Rees work & wish him all the best on his adventure!"
