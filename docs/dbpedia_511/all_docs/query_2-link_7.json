        "text": "GRAND RAPIDS -- With its Rolling Stones-inflected, bluesy country rock, The Deadstring Brothers have destroyed the stereotype of bands born in Detroit. Led by singer and guitarist Kurt Marschke (and featuring British pedal steel guitarist Spencer Cullum), the band plays One Trick Pony, 136 E. Fulton St., at 7:30 p.m. Monday, as part of WYCE-FM's Hat Trick Concert Series.\n\nThe band is touring behind its latest album, \"Sao Paulo.\" Admission is free, but a hat will be passed to raise money for Carol's Ferals, which offers trap-neuter-return services for feral cats at discounted rates. Details online at wyce.org."
