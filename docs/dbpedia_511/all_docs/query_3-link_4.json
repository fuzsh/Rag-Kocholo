        "text": "Hailing from Detroit, Mich., these guys are more like Motor City alt/country rockers, described by many critics as producing a sound reminiscent of the Exile on Main Street period Rolling Stones. Fronted by guitarist/vocalist and studio wizard Kurt Marschke, the rest of the Brothers include fellow Detroit native and longtime drummer Travis Harrett, and real life brothers Spencer (guitar, pedal steel, slide guitar) and Jeff Cullum (bass), who happen to call London home. The band started with a vision by Marschke in 2003 and evolved ever more toward the roots of country and blues until he now states, “It’s all in there somewhere” concerning his and the band’s version of what Gram Parsons called “Cosmic American Music.” After three releases on Chicago’s independent roots label, Bloodshot Records, Marschke played some on his own as a one-man band. Now all the Brothers are back making music like only they can do, slashing and crashing through an amazing American amalgam of country, rock, blues and soul.\n\nDeadstring Brothers\n\nTuesday, Feb. 5, 8pm\n\nOld 36 Inn, Riverton"
