        "text": "Category: Vinyl Video\n\nYip Deceiver x Vinyl Video\n\nSitting in The World Famous in downtown Athens on my lunch break (that’s a lot of prepositions), talking to Yip Deceiver about their current tour and all the stuff you talk about during interviews, I hold back from mentioning all of the times I’ve seen and recognized them around town (hi, I’m a creep). Though they’re a…\n\nConcord America + Vinyl Mag\n\nConcord America – not only the “best band name ever” but also the coolest dudes ever. If you’re anywhere around Atlanta, you may know them from their killer performance at The Stuffing (they were personally asked to play the Manchester Orchestra-hosted event by Andy Hull himself…no big deal). Or if you’re a long-time Vinyl Mag…\n\nSirah + Vinyl Mag\n\nI have a Christmas present for everyone. By now, if you’re a regular Vinyl Mag reader, you know we have a pretty big thing for Sirah. We’ve already interviewed her TWICE in 2013 (it’s not our fault she’s so dang awesome…not to mention dang interesting), and now here’s our third. Watch us get to know…\n\nThe Wild Feathers + Vinyl Mag\n\nThe Wild Feathers decided to grace Athens with their presence, so I scooped up the opportunity to grab an interview with them at the beloved 40 Watt. You should know this band. Their song “The Ceiling” recently won the SiriusXM Best of 2013 Listener Poll for The Spectrum Best Song Discovery. They have already toured with Willie…\n\nBlack Taxi + Vinyl Mag\n\nSo Black Taxi. These guys are the best. Recently hooked up (professionally) with this NYC-based (self-described) “grit-pop” band at a lil ole bar in Milledgeville, Georgia (random? yes. Unexpectedly awesome? you bet – ended up in a giant warehouse/studio with BT watching our lovely waitress – shout out – blow glass beads for all of…\n\nOn the Bus with Less Than Jake\n\nOh you know. Just hanging out on the tour bus with Roger Manganelli of Less Than Jake. I really don’t hate my job. Watch us talk about their new album See The Light, tour, and upcoming plans! Enjoy. And don’t you dare forget to check out their new album See The Light, out now!\n\nDeadstring Brothers Back With Vinyl Mag\n\nLook who we caught up with for a second interview! We got to follow up with these guys just a few months after our first interview to talk about what they’ve been up to, touring, recording a new album, and what’s next for the band. We love these guys. When effortless and interesting conversation is…\n\nBackstage with Blitzen Trapper\n\nSo I got to hang out backstage at the 40 Watt with Portland, OR-based band Blitzen Trapper, because my job is awesome. They are touring the US in support of their recent release, VII, which came out September 30, 2013. Go ahead and watch our interview (below) so you can feel like you were hanging…\n\nOn the Lawn with pacificUV\n\nWe met up with pacificUV before their show at the 40 Watt in Athens, GA. Looking for a quiet place to interview, we ended up crashing the lawn of a frat house to talk about their new album, The Album Leaf remix, and upcoming tour. Enjoy!"
