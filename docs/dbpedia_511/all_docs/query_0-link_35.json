        "text": "Jon Kenworthy is a recreational bass player who arrived in the Chicago area from North Texas a few decades back. For years he hoped to find a musical group to play with, maybe one day perform with. He dropped in on open jams at the Lake County Folk Club near where he lived. He took music classes at the College of DuPage and other area schools. He came across plenty of musicians in his new home, a metro area of almost ten million people, with deep roots in blues, jazz and gospel, all styles Kenworthy digs and which benefit from the rhythmic backdrop of a bass guitar. But his unsuccessful search wasn’t so much a result of opportunity, but of logistics. A married special-education teacher raising two kids, Kenworthy had limited time available. Meeting others and then coordinating practice and rehearsals proved difficult. Nothing was working. So instead, at home in his basement, he would set up his bass and amplifiers and play through GarageBand or in time with recordings online.\n\n“It gets stale sitting in your basement playing along with YouTube videos,” he told me this past fall.\n\nThen last year, through a friend, Kenworthy learned of a program in Chicago that stages pop-up bands. For eight weeks, they rehearse just once a week on the same day at the same time. They cover everything from classic rock to rockabilly, jug band to bossa nova. Kenworthy was intrigued: consistent and predictable suits the working dad.\n\nStill, he wondered, “Am I good enough to play in one?” At the end of each eight-week session, the bands put on a thirty-to-forty-minute set, open to the public. Kenworthy traveled to the city to watch his friend’s punk-rock group. He saw a range of musicians, from capable amateurs to straight fire. He signed up shortly after and has been playing in these bands ever since.\n\nKenworthy is one of a few hundred amateur musicians participating in the adult ensemble program at the Old Town School of Folk Music. Like Kenworthy, many are working professionals in another field—teachers, engineers, therapists, bartenders, social workers, administrators. Some have been in bands before. Many haven’t.\n\n“Ensembles give students an opportunity to be part of a band. For some, people who in a million years would have never thought they’d be in a band,” Jacob Sweet, a teacher in the program whose ensembles include “Rockabilly” and “Modern Country,” tells me.\n\nAnywhere from forty to sixty ensembles launch each eight-week session. In an ensemble, students learn, rehearse and perform a short set of popular or traditional tunes. The ensembles function as cover bands, like ones you’d happen upon at a Chicago block party. (A songwriting ensemble for original student tunes is in the works.)\n\nIn one respect, the program’s value-proposition is to prompt and animate a group music-making experience while handling the administrative side of being in a band.\n\n“Some students don’t want to go through the hassle of organizing bands and looking for gigs,” says Jimmy Tomasello. Tomasello managed the ensemble program for twenty years before his 2021 retirement. “[In the ensemble program] ’I know every Tuesday I can come in here with my gear, play and then have a show at the end.’”\n\nFor about the cost of a night out at a four-star restaurant, the Old Town School assembles a collection of amateur musicians, who are all, in theory, on a similar musical wavelength, and provides the space and time of an eighty-minute rehearsal each week. (Aid is available through the school for those in financial need. Volunteering at the school also translates into ensemble class credit.) The school makes available drum kits and keyboards; guitarists and other stringed instrumentalists are expected to bring their own. The school supplies a band leader—an Old Town School teacher who is also often a working musician—who plays, runs rehearsals and retains veto power over the creative direction of the band, as needed (no Wilson/Love power struggles here). Finally, the school schedules a concert at the end of the term.\n\nShows may take place at one of the Old Town School’s three concert spaces, auditoriums which range from 150- to 425-seat capacity, host to national touring acts such as Andrew Bird, Patti Smith, Joan Baez, Robyn Hitchcock, the Jayhawks and Esperanza Spalding. Kenworthy tells me his most memorable ensemble experience was performing on the same stage where Emily Saliers and Steve Earle had once played.\n\nOr shows may take place at clubs around the city, based on partnerships formed by the Old Town School community. For years, blues ensembles have had a standing date at term’s end at Rosa’s Lounge, one of Chicago’s best blues clubs. Its owner, Tony Mangiullo, has seen a lot of accomplished acts come through his doors in the forty-plus years his club has been open, musicians like Pinetop Perkins, Sugar Blue and Lurrie Bell. Of the Old Town School ensembles, he says: “To my surprise, with these students, the amount of effort—and I’m not even concerned with the ultimate result of talent, which also I’m surprised too, there are some great players—what I really admire in them is the amount of effort and passion and results. I’m actually impressed! At the same time, I’m inspired.”\n\nWhile the performance is, unmistakably, the climax of the ensemble term and experience, it is not necessarily what makes it tick. That’s the other element the program offers—community. The Old Town School is the largest non-profit community arts school in the country, made up of more than 250 teaching artists and 10,000 students. It is a music hub, a tradition, a “third place” for social gathering in Chicago, as Second City is for comedy and the Poetry Center is for letters.\n\nEric Singh, who was hired as program manager following Tomasello’s retirement, says the ensembles aim to provide the “best classroom experience while also encouraging engagement with the broader Old Town School community.”\n\nSeven days a week, forty-eight weeks a year, students from all over the city and Chicago area come together in Lincoln Square, where the bulk of Old Town School classes have been held since the late nineties, or the 909 West Armitage location, in Lincoln Park. Richelle “Rich” Gordon, a journalism professor who has been an ensemble student for two decades, drives from Evanston to take part in two to three ensembles each term. She tells me finding the Old Town School shortly after moving to the area from Florida in the early 2000s was a “life-changing experience” for her.\n\n“Through the Old Town School I discovered nothing brings me more joy than making music with other people.”\n\nRichard Pettengill, who has taught British Invasion and Woodstock ensembles at the school, says, “The ensembles generate community, which is born from a mutual passion the students have for the music. It bonds them as friends and musicians… People take ensembles year after year. ‘I’m part of this community and I don’t want it to stop.’”\n\nThe Old Town School may have emerged from the folk revival of the mid-twentieth century, but the scope of music coming from its halls today is manifold, as demonstrated by the ensemble program. Ensembles have covered one-hit wonders, the riot grrrl movement, MTV, the Blues Brothers and pop divas. Ensembles, too, spotlight particular bands and artists, like the Black Keys and David Bowie. And they take on entire genres and styles, such as bluegrass, disco, reggae, hot club-style jazz, punk, blues and soul. Furthering the Old Town School’s embrace of global sounds are Irish session music, Latin music and Brazilian ensembles. Some ensembles do time periods and decades—the “’90s” ensemble is particularly popular today.\n\nEnsembles are as creative as the Old Town School teachers that lead them, reflecting their interests and tastes—but also requiring a calculus of whether an audience exists for that given theme. Ensembles that don’t meet the minimum threshold of four students will not likely run that term. The “low-hanging fruit” ensembles, as Tomasello referred to them—think enduring bands like the Beatles—have no such enrollment problems. If not already, most will eventually outlast the band or artist they pay tribute to. It’s the experimental or niche offerings, perhaps an ensemble focusing on a record label, which may need nurturing. Another reason an ensemble might not run is when vital instruments aren’t filled. Rhythm sections in the adult ensembles are in short supply. Which is why you will find almost all Old Town School adult ensemble teachers are competent drummers. (Conversely, but not shockingly, drums are among the easiest instruments to fill in the Teen Rock Band ensemble.)\n\nOne of the newer ensembles is Great Lakes, which sources its songs from the states and provinces bordering the lakes, music from “the giants of Motown and Chicago blues to rock icons like Devo, the Violent Femmes and Jack White, to contemporary singer-songwriters from both sides of the northern border.” This is where I met Kenworthy, Gordon and other seasoned ensemble players last fall. My original intent had been to observe an Old Town School ensemble in process. This being the Old Town School, however, I was invited to sit in on guitar. Then, even more.\n\nGreat Lakes met on Sunday afternoons in the school’s 4544 North Lincoln location, formerly home to the Chicago Public Library’s regional branch (now found at Sulzer down the street). The building is honeycombed with classrooms and studios and performance spaces which are routinely abuzz with music throughout the day—the experience of taking classes at the Old Town School, beyond instruction and community, is to be steeped in a musical ecstasy. Being around so much music as it is created, rather than the product packaged for consumption, heightens the senses, lifts the spirit. It is easy to lose yourself, especially if you are like me, coming from a daily funhouse soundscape of Microsoft 365 pings and chimes, battle-tested ergonomic chairs and unmuted Internet ads.\n\nUnder such spells it is easy to forget about the static and dissonance at the school, and not the artful kind. The issues have been well documented, including in Newcity: the proposed sale of the 909 West Armitage building; labor strife; ongoing mistrust between arts and administration. In recent years, the Armitage sale was abandoned (Richelle Gordon, the ensemble student, took a lead role in mobilizing students as part of the overall resistance effort), Old Town School teachers voted to unionize and the new board chair is a former Old Town School student. But as with any large organization, legacy issues persist, and new ones come with the times. In our classroom rehearsal space, signs on the wall managed to convey a certain politesse that I still associate with the Old Town School. Please keep the thermostat at 70 degrees. Please leave the drum kit always setup. Thanks. Despite the discord at times, the idea, or “hunch” about a demand for folk instruction as it occurred to co-founder Win Stracke, did develop out of an Oak Park living room in the 1950s, after all.”\n\nIn our classroom, there was a drum kit and a Yamaha keyboard. Large PA speakers were positioned on stands in adjacent corners and two smaller ones mounted to the wall. In the minutes leading up to class, students connected the PA to the microphones, plugged their guitars and bass into amps, and set up music stands. Then we positioned ourselves in a circle in the Old Town School class style.\n\n“Hi, I’m Shelley,” the drummer began. “I’m loosely in charge of this situation.”\n\nGreat Lakes is led by the musician and Old Town School teacher Shelley Miller. Originally from California, Miller came to Chicago in the late nineties with an interest in music and songwriting. They have released numerous albums and performed in and around Chicago while teaching at the school for more than twenty years. Miller says they see themselves as the “louder, weirder end of the folk school.” They say, “One of the cool things as a teacher is to see what’s not being offered and offering that. I like to think I’m opening up a new little corner of the school for folks.” Singh, the adult ensemble program manager, says Miller is always bringing fresh ideas to him. Earlier this year, Miller pioneered the school’s first ensemble focusing on LGBTQ+ artists. Recently, they have offered an Introduction to Ensembles ensemble, where a beginner like me (I have taken classes in the school’s core guitar program, but this was my first ensemble), learns how to set up gear and equipment and is coached through the group music-making process.\n\nRob Weisbach, an options trader, was the lead guitarist in Great Lakes. He played a Fender Stratocaster plugged into an amp bedecked with stickers for Riot Fest, the Cubs and Joshua Tree National Park, among many others. He had never been in a band before joining the Old Town School ensembles. A woman named Anna was on keyboards and guitar; a Great Lakes ensemble student several times over. The rhythm guitarist to my right in the circle, Karen Singer, a school social worker, told us she was in the first-ever Old Town School rock ensemble: a Bob Dylan group offered by Jimmy Tomasello in the nineties. Ages in Great Lakes, I gathered, fell somewhere between “Blood on the Tracks”-era Dylan and “Modern Times.”\n\nIn front of each of us, music stands held the school’s lead sheets, which set out the essential elements of the songs we would learn. Miller had tabbed the songs, as Old Town School teachers do for classes, notating chords above the lyrics, supplying fret and string positions for licks and melodies as needed. This session we would learn songs by Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, the apropos Great Lake Swimmers, the Deadstring Brothers and Wilco, among others. Great Lakes lives within a multi-genre ensemble format. Different ensemble formats will spur their own kinds of innovations. Where an ensemble devoted to a single band or artist may lead students to nerd out, say, on a songwriter’s penchant for using Drop D tuning, a genre ensemble may be more about discovery. Miller pulled the greater share of the song set from student nominations. Kenworthy says he thought he knew music and bands until he got exposed to student tastes in the Great Lakes ensemble. Weisbach, who has taken ensembles in punk and grunge genres, tells me, “My favorite part about the ensembles is that I get to continually learn new songs, and I have been introduced to so many great musicians through the years.”\n\nWe opened with “People Get Ready,” a smooth mid-sixties gospel song by the Chicago group The Impressions. Gordon synced her phone to the room’s PA system. She brought up the song on Apple Music, allowing everyone to consider the rhythm, pace, chord changes and overall flow. A class discussion ensued on approaches to the key change from C# to D that occurs midway through the song. Then the topic of vocals came up. I had nominated “People Get Ready,” which is sung in Curtis Mayfield’s singular falsetto. Lacking foresight and accounting only for taste, I had nominated songs I liked, not songs I was prepared to sing in front of others. As the class waited for a volunteer, I avoided eye contact, pretending to be especially interested in what was going on with the thermostat. Please keep the thermostat at 70 degrees.\n\nGordon gamely volunteered, moving a mic in front of her. I ran through some major chord shapes on my guitar, a Blueridge acoustic I’d bought at the school’s Different Strummer music shop after my first Old Town School class years earlier. From behind the drums Miller counted off. We nodded and tapped our feet in time. We were off.\n\nThe Old Town School adult ensemble program evolved from a belief that the school’s core instrument instruction was not providing students the opportunity to mature as musicians. Michael Miles is credited with both diagnosis and remedy.\n\nMiles has filled many roles over his decades-long affiliation with the school, including program director from the mid-1980s through the late 1990s. (He is also a faculty celebrity; folk legend Pete Seeger had once said about Miles’ banjo playing, “It is enough to make me want to learn the banjo all over again.”) When Miles entered the position, the school was experiencing low enrollment and struggling financially. Disco. New wave. He was given an opportunity by the school’s executive director to try new things.\n\nMiles told me during a phone conversation, “I looked at the skills of players who had completed the guitar program and didn’t think all were necessarily advanced. It just meant they had gone through the program.”\n\nHis remedy involved activating the techniques students were learning in class and making performance more of an objective—listening to others, participating with a purpose in the musical dialogue taking place. This redirected focus led to an offering at the Old Town School called the Blues School. The program leveraged the world-famous Chicago blues scene as a source of instruction and inspiration for students. In the Blues School, teachers would listen to students on the first night of class, assess their skill level then place them in a band with their peers. Each band would rehearse a set of songs leading to a concert at the end of the term. Though the Blues School is no longer a program at the Old Town School, it offered a template for the adult ensembles that followed—and the school still does offer blues ensembles under the heading “Blues Band – Live!” that retain class placement as a feature.\n\nIn other adult ensembles, students do not audition. The Old Town School recommends as a baseline that prospective students be at an intermediate level on their instrument. On guitar, for example, this means chord shapes are no sweat and you have familiarity with arpeggios, fingerpicking and barre chords. Nonetheless, you won’t be turned away if you yearn to stand on stage with kaleidoscope eyes and play “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” in the Beatles ensemble but can’t do much beyond strum a few chords. That goes against the culture of the Old Town School.\n\nMiles, who recently co-taught an ensemble that paid tribute to the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band’s record “Will the Circle be Unbroken,” said, “The challenge is to find a way for everyone who signed up to participate on some level.”\n\nIn Great Lakes, Miller worked to locate spaces in songs for each student to their ability. They used Wilco’s “Via Chicago” as a vehicle for creativity. The song runs on a recurring chord structure, with intervals for jamming and exploration after each verse. Miller encouraged us to discover what we could bring to those intervals. Weisbach, who is proficient in scales, soloed. Others added individual flourishes where they could. Or on the key change in “People Get Ready,” Weisbach, a more advanced musician, could go from C# to D by moving his fingers up the guitar neck. Others relied on a capo, a clamping device that substitutes for a finger, repositioning it one fret up at the key change.\n\nRockabilly and Modern Country ensemble teacher Jacob Sweet, who studied jazz and classical music at DePaul, describes the Old Town School approach this way: “The Old Town School is not conservatory style. What I’ve seen is the goal is to get people who exist in a wide range of ability levels to play music together and feel like they are making music together.” He adds, “One of the things Old Town School faculty is masterful at doing is putting the different abilities together. It’s why the Old Town School has persevered all these years. It’s a very specific teaching skill to put all these different skill levels together. And it’s part of the whole folk ethos that informs the teaching at the school. If you’ve ever been to a traditional Irish jam session, hootenanny or folk jam, it’s not like you get grilled at the door for what you can play. You sit down, start playing and make it work.”\n\nPeople you meet at the Old Town School, teachers and students alike, are of the mind, even if they know nothing about you, have never heard you pluck a single chord, that your contribution adds something valuable to the sound. When I dropped by Sweet’s Modern Country ensemble last fall to watch and listen, one of his students asked me, did I play and want to sit in? He motioned to a spare guitar in the room.\n\nThis goes for singing, too. Guitar balances the books—there are 1,352 guitar pickers at the Old Town School (plus some). But singing is cherished. Sweet said, “When you see an adult go up and sing in front of a group of people for the first time in their life, the Old Town School is so welcoming.”\n\nCore guitar classes at the school typically function as a group singalong led by the teacher, whereas ensembles often feature solo student vocals. Gordon tells me when she was starting out, she had no idea she could sing but was encouraged to do so by another ensemble member.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was content to stay quiet all term in Great Lakes, in the third week of class Gordon invited me to sing a verse on “Seeds and Stems (Again),” by Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen.\n\nFor the beginning ensemble student who is new to all this, this really is the existential question: to sing or not to sing. Because guitar players and most other instrumentalists, if they don’t take any lead parts, and a fair number don’t, the sounds of their misshapes, misfires and lapses can have a minor effect on the full ensemble sound. They are mostly masked by the larger group, though teachers with their rarefied ears may say otherwise. I was rusty and falling behind on my chord changes throughout Great Lakes, yet felt unexposed.\n\nBut to sing, and not be in a chorus or with the ironic buffer of a karaoke machine nearby, falling back on no prior training or performance—except the audience space between your own ears—this I began to see was another critical dimension of the ensemble experience. In spite of all the rational behaviors and defense mechanisms one spends a lifetime building up to shield themselves from humiliating public displays, I agreed to sing.\n\nThere are dozens of teachers in the Old Town School adult ensemble program. In my conversations with teachers and students and administrators, no name came up more often than Steve Levitt’s. He has taught, or “sherpa’d” as he is prone to calling what he does, the longest-running, most popular adult ensembles at the Old Town School. His affiliation with the school dates back to the early sixties as a student. Decades later, in the early nineties, he came back as a teacher. Social communities and artistic networks have built up around two of his ensembles, Grateful Dead and Beatles. (He has since passed on the Beatles torch to another teacher.) Last summer Levitt co-organized a staged reading, in the Old Town School’s Szold Hall, of a play about a séance for Jerry Garcia, the devoutly idolized member of the Grateful Dead, written by a playwright who is in the Grateful Dead ensemble, co-starring Pettengill, a Shakespeare professor who formerly taught at the Old Town School. One of Levitt’s students based a chapter of her PhD dissertation on his Beatles ensemble. (The dissertation itself focused on the Old Town School at large; it is the most comprehensive look at the school that exists.) Gordon tells me she joined the Dead ensemble not because she is a Deadhead but because of Levitt.\n\nHaving taken guitar with Levitt years back, I texted him last fall asking if I might stop by a session of the Grateful Dead ensemble. He wrote back, “bring an instrument…”\n\nI showed up with my Blueridge, discovering a mellower version of the Dead ensemble than the force of nature I had once encountered across the hall from a core guitar class I was in. Along with Gordon and me on our acoustic rhythms, there were two other guitarists and a bassist. No percussion. Levitt, his graying hair ponytailed, sat in a folding chair with his legs stretched out, hands folded over his belly, a faint smile on his face. He appeared to be in no hurry to start class. His guitar sat next to him. Boxes of vintage candy—Boston Baked Beans and wax soda pop bottles—were scattered across a table in the middle of the class circle. I recognized one of the students as the playwright from over the summer.\n\nLevitt handed me a packet of songs for the term. We opened the night with “The Wheel,” a space-rock song from Garcia’s 1972 solo debut. Levitt introduced it as “familiar shapes in unfamiliar places.” He is known for his peculiar diction and turns of phrase, what Tomasello termed the “Levitt lexicon.” After the song “Dire Wolf” on which Gordon sang, by way of instruction Levitt brought up Gordon’s “jealous strum” on the guitar.\n\n“Down, down, up, up, down,” he said. “You have a jealous strum.”\n\nGordon appeared puzzled. Levitt explained, “It wants to kick out all the other strum patterns you know and have you for itself.”\n\nTo this Gordon’s face softened. It had started to sink in. Sort of.\n\n“A lot of humans can only do the same strum pattern when singing,” he continued. “I’d rather you selected your strums, rather than the other way around.”\n\nThe evening called to mind a campfire jam with friends. During the session Tomasello even dropped in, a close friend of Levitt’s (and, as it happens, the Grateful Dead ensemble founder—he passed it onto Levitt years ago). He was in town from Amsterdam, where he and his wife had relocated after his retirement from the Old Town School. Levitt invited him to grab a guitar. Tomasello declined but pulled up a chair. Gordon threw him a beer. For the remainder of class we jammed through a set of classic Dead songs as Tomasello kept time on his leg, belting out every song with gusto, never once needing to consult a song packet for lyrics, never once appearing as if there were any other place in the world he’d rather be.\n\nInto October, Great Lakes added several new songs to round out our setlist for the performance scheduled days before Halloween. One was “Teenage Anarchist,” a pop punk anthem by the Gainesville, Florida, band Against Me! (whose lead singer, Laura Jane Grace, now lives in Chicago). Another was “Little Red Corvette” by Prince, on which Singer assumed vocals. Her strong, soulful voice held the song together as we skidded through its second half each week. When I spoke to Miller midway through the term, they thought Great Lakes was going well. “Little Red Corvette” aside, they said, “I don’t think we’ve had a lot of things that fell apart when we were playing. We’re gelling as a group, people are participating and cooperating in class.”\n\nI heard stories from teachers and students about what can go wrong in an ensemble: Teachers singling students out for screwing up a song, students arguing over songs, dominating personalities. Those occurrences I understood to be rarities and B-sides. I witnessed nothing like that in Great Lakes. Miller says their ensembles have been clicking in recent years. They are one of the teachers who enjoys a devoted student following and familiar faces often turn up each session. Weisbach, for instance, has taken more than twenty ensembles at the Old Town School, all but one with Miller. “I think Shelley allows for a very relaxed and fun playing environment,” he tells me, “and that is why I continue to take classes with them.”\n\nMiller knew every student (except me) from prior ensembles they’d led. And students in Great Lakes had all made music with at least one other member in a past Miller ensemble. This provides a built-in chemistry, which addresses one of the central complications for a quickly assembled, short-lived group music project.\n\nBut this familiarity may also result in both real and perceived barriers to students new to the ensemble program. A friend of mine who signed up for his first ensemble several years ago, led by another teacher, tells me his experience was that of an outsider among regulars. The ensemble had ten to fifteen students in it, many with shared Old Town School histories. He experienced nothing problematic during the term, just no connection.\n\nGreat Lakes, in my experience, benefited from being on the smaller side. With a total of six students, this presented plenty of opportunities for meaningful interactions among all members. Gordon was especially outgoing, from sharing tips on marking up my lead sheets to counseling me on how to get the most out of my voice—which had begun affecting a twang either to match the pedal steel guitar and Commander Cody’s vocal drawl of “Seeds and Stems (Again),” or because of my own insecurities.\n\n“That’s the only thing that matters: That you are not afraid to do it,” she said. “Sing like you mean it.”\n\nIt’s always about the group dynamic at the Old Town School. Peer learning is foundational, going back to co-founder Frank Hamilton’s teaching method. Michael Miles explains it this way: “Frank would say, ‘I gotta step out of the class. Be right back in a minute. Check and see if the person next to you is having any trouble with this tune.’ He would stand in the hallway and wait. This got people who may keep to themselves or who may not interact with each other, now they are talking to each other. This social fabric nourished the music created.”\n\nFrom class interactions, friendships form; marriages even. Sometimes bands. Together with students she’d met in a past ensemble, Gordon formed a group called Twangdogs. They played covers like those learned in the ensemble program. Twangdogs gigged around Chicago but traveled as far as Scotland to take part in the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. In the past few years, Twangdogs has spun off into another band, Steel String Highway, which Gordon is in now. She was scheduled to appear with them at the Ninth Street Pub in La Salle, Illinois, the night after our Old Town School show.\n\nThe adult ensembles fall within the purview of Eric Singh, who took over as program manager in December 2021 for the recently retired Tomasello. Singh came to the position with both academic and practical experience. He holds a Doctor of Music degree from Northwestern and has teaching experience both at the university and nonprofit levels. He taught for several years at the People’s Music School in Uptown, a free school for children.\n\nAt the Old Town School, Singh manages adult group offerings in guitar, bass, ensembles, songwriting and theory. He oversees more than 150 classes. He gave credit to Tomasello for the program he inherited, confessing that succeeding a figure with as much tenure and admiration as Tomasello was a humbling experience.\n\nOn his responsibility in the role, Singh says it is “ushering in a new generation of students into the Old Town School, looking at the catalog and making sure we are offering the Old Town School community courses that are attractive and they want to be a part of.”\n\nThe ensemble program, through my experience and based on conversations with other students, does trend older. At forty-four, I was in the younger half of Great Lakes. One way Singh expects to continue attracting new-generation students is to stay current with contemporary artists. This April, the school offered a guitar course called “Taylor Swift for Beginners.” If it finds favor with students, which he expects it will, based on feedback and the wider music discourse, he anticipates a Taylor Swift ensemble soon.\n\nWhen I raise one of the complaints I heard multiple times, about overcrowding in ensembles, where you’ll have seven rhythm guitarists and four leads, Singh acknowledges this can be a problem. He hopes to see ensemble offerings continue to grow, but not at the expense of the interactions and creativity that larger groups can foster (contrary to my friend’s experience).\n\n“The purpose of the ensembles is not to have small clubs, but to provide an enriching experience with the school community.” Larger ensembles can provide students with opportunities to work out on new instruments, he adds. Another friend of mine, who plays lead guitar in a band, also noted this as a benefit of the program. He says he would love to experiment at one of his shows as the drummer, but in a traditional band setup where the stakes and expectations are different, this isn’t as easily done. Jacob Sweet tells me both the bassist and drummer in his Rockabilly ensemble came in as guitarists.\n\nI ask Singh, as I did others, about local or national comparisons to the school’s ensembles program. Swallow Hill Music, a Denver nonprofit music school founded in 1979, came up as the closest. An online folk publication writes, “What the Old Town School of Folk Music is for the Midwest is exactly what Swallow Hill is for the West.” Swallow Hill offers ensembles in a similar vein—alt-country, classic soul, newgrass, Americana—though on a smaller scale and lacking the more inventive groupings. The other organization named was School of Rock, the for-profit music school started out of Philadelphia in the late 1990s. In part due to franchising opportunities, its reach is astonishing. Along with its three Chicago locations, School of Rock is found in more than thirty states and spans the globe, from Australia to Brazil.\n\nCurious as to what a performance put on by another institution looks like, I visited the Subterranean on a Saturday in January to watch School of Rock graduations. One was a blues band, the other punk. Admittedly, I went in biased, inclined to root for the nonprofit and local favorite in the imaginary battle of the bands playing out in my head. I discovered once I got there, however, the sides I’d pitted against each other were unbalanced. The musicians on stage were teenagers; the adults in the room were in the audience and taking selfies.\n\nLater I learned, feeling foolish, School of Rock is geared toward younger people—which tracked why the Old Town School Teen Rock ensemble teacher Jose Murillo had cited it multiple times in our conversation; though it’s worth stating, a few adult bands are offered. But I must admit the music was impressive, those kids were sharp and looked to be having themselves a time on stage at a cool club in Wicker Park.\n\nAt the 909 West Armitage stage in late October, Great Lakes’ set was part of a supersized Saturday night quadruple bill featuring Miller’s three ensembles that term—Alt-Country, Great Lakes and Punk—with an added appearance by the Here and Now ensemble. Forty-five minutes to showtime, students and audience members were trickling in. Ensemble shows on Old Town School stages and at city clubs are free and open to the public. Mainly it’s friends and family who show up. Crowd sizes won’t transform club owners’ eyeballs into dollar signs, but the turnout is fair. Billy Helmkamp, co-owner of the Whistler and Sleeping Village, tells me about forty to forty-five people (this includes the musicians) came to a two-ensemble showcase staged at the Whistler on a Sunday night right before the pandemic.\n\nPotluck snacks and treats were on a table near the door, drinks BYOB. The stage was a hive of activity as Alt-Country organized and connected their gear. Over the PA I heard the Silver Jews and Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, indie rock bands I used to faithfully go to see at the Metro and Double Door. Nostalgia came over me. I wondered what Thax Douglas was up to.\n\nWith Halloween a few days away, our showcase was costume-optional. Miller arrived dressed as a zombie in a sport coat. “Brains,” said Gordon, as part of sound check (both Gordon and Singer were also in Alt-Country). Gordon, costumed as Laura Jane Grace, was in a flowing black wig and black t-shirt that read “GENDER IS OVER! IF YOU WANT IT.” Punk’s drummer wore the orange spotted tunic and blue tie of Fred Flintstone. Another student had a beanie hat in the form of an eagle’s face, with feathers ornamenting their guitar strap. Kenworthy sported a Santa cap.\n\nAfter the term, Lenny Marsh, who teaches in Blues Band – Live!, described getting on stage to me: “You can play a song or some songs, or you can get up on stage and perform. A performance means you get up out of yourself. You can’t get up on stage and perform for your audience as a lawyer or a nurse. You have to get out of yourself.” His point wasn’t about dressing up, it cut much deeper than that, but I thought the costumes added in their own way to the spectacle and shift taking place.\n\nAlt-Country ran through songs by The Secret Sisters, Kacey Musgraves and Wilco. With the nerve required of the amateur vocalist, Alt-Country’s keyboardist delivered a showstopping rendition of a song called “Frank to Valentino.” As happened with nearly all the songs I heard that night, I later found the source recording online flat by comparison.\n\nThen Great Lakes was up. I took a spot in the second row behind Gordon, Singer and Weisbach. I looked out at the audience. From beneath the stage lights, the faces were darkened. Miller counted off. “People Get Ready,” “Little Red Corvette,” “Via Chicago,” “Teenage Anarchist,” “Sacred Heart,” the songs we had spent the past eight weeks slowing down, speeding up, trying this way and that, searching for where they lived in our collective consciousness, swept forward in an instant. I remember Weisbach shouldering the tricky guitar parts and nailing the solos, Singer’s voice sounding great with the auditorium’s acoustics, Gordon’s entertaining commentary between songs, Kenworthy’s basslines jumping, Miller keeping the beat.\n\nWhen it came time for “Seeds and Stems (Again),” I moved to the front row to be near one of the microphones. This is supposed to be fun, I reminded myself. I stepped up and crushed it, in key, in time, impeccable. Or at least that’s how it sounded to me on stage. My wife took a video if I wanted to know how it really sounded. But I didn’t. That’s the thing about performing music. It’s all in the moment.\n\nPunk followed our set with “People Who Died,” a devastating, electrifying selection in light of the past few dark COVID years. Gordon was dancing near the soundboard in back. “If you decide this is fun,” Miller said in between songs, “then you are correct.”\n\nHere and Now closed out the showcase, highlighted by “Midnight in Harlem” by Tedeschi Trucks Band. The lights came on in the auditorium. The last instruments were soon packed up. Those remaining poured out into the Chicago night. Monday morning, or whenever, we would all be back at work, but tonight we were musicians. With all the great shows happening across town, from Kingston Mines to Jazz Showcase to the Aragon and beyond, I wondered where ours registered, if it registered at all. Did we contribute something to the sound of the city that night? I’d say more than how to play a guitar or play in a band, the answer to this question is what I’ve most come to learn over my time at the Old Town School: We did."
