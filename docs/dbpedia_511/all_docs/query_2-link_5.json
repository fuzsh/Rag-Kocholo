        "text": "The Deadstring Brothers’ heart beats with pure rock and roll. Simple and shor ’nuff. Built on a the unshakable foundations of blues, rock country and soul, DSB manages to create something at once totally fresh but totally recognizable. It’s all ragtops and cold beer, seeds and stems, gatefold LPs and foxy girlfriends with tight, flared jeans. You can imagine them walking as a gang down Carnaby street in London in the late 60’s, or tearing up the stage at Cobo Hall in De-troit Rock City or sweating buckets at a Muscle Shoals recording session in the 70’s.\n\nIf mainstream radio played music like the Deadstring Brothers, they wouldn’t have to call it classic rock anymore, they’d just call it rock. It’s still here, and it sounds as good as ever.\n\nFronted by guitarist/vocalist and studio magician Kurt Marschke, the Brothers pound out a sound that, in comparison to so much lo-fi indie rock, is full and rich and sounds GREAT blasting out your car window. Joining Kurt in the band are longtime drummer and fellow Detroiter Travis Harrett, and the brothers Cullum—Spencer (guitar, pedal steel and slide guitar) and Jeff (bass). The Cullums, a couple of London lads, came into the Deadstring fold during a UK tour in 2006. Both were mainstays in the burgeoning Heavy Load scene built around a communal love of all things Stones, Crowes and Allmans. It was love at first jam and the boys joined up and bridged the waters between London and Detroit in time to record their 2nd album Silver Mountain.\n\nCorbin Marsh has been stomping out country blues across the United States for only the better half of a decade, but at just 26 years old, he has the voice and playing style one would expect from a seasoned veteran. Channeling legends like Son House, Lightnin’ Hopkins and contemporary inspirations like Justin Townes Earle and Lucinda Williams, Marsh pens timeless ballads of death, deception and barroom laments of love lost.\n\nIn November of 2010, Corbin joined blues guitar veteran Mike Flynn and longtime collaborator Chris Lee on drums to form Corbin Marsh Band. Joined later by Jeff Stritholdt of Makebelieves’ fame on bass, the group brought explosive and dynamic energy to Marsh’s tunes. The group also breathes new life to century old traditionals and blues songs by Robert Johnson, Elizabeth Cotten and others. In July of 2012, they released their first official EP, “Wheel Spinning ‘Round.”\n\nA long time ago in a record industry far, far away… Dean III had his debut album, “Liberty”, released by Waterdog Records. It was billed as Dean Goldstein & Coin but the players on the disc were assembled by the producer, Bad Examples leader Ralph Covert. Then musicians around Chicago heard the songs, became fans, and a real band was born. And played. And what started out as a singer-songwriter project morphed into rockin’ Americana-with more than a nod and a wink to the Faces and the Stones. Coin was courted by the big guys and even commissioned for some movie music (and therein lies a tale for another time).\n\nConcurrently he built his own log cabin in rural Illinois and promptly filled it with triplets. Parenting precluded performing until recently. The superb songwriting never stopped and now with a little help from his friends, Dean’s back, ready to rock live. He’s got a new rhythm section called The Wagers and they’re just starting to bring “Dirty Souls” to the soon-to-be-devoted fans in the Midwest."
