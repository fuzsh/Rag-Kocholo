        "text": "Deadstring Brothers\n\nRed Eyed Fly, Saturday, March 17\n\nAccording to Rob Miller, head of their label, Bloodshot Records, the Deadstring Brothers can't get arrested in their hometown of Detroit. As evidenced by the young sextet's reception Saturday night, there are plenty of other places, including Austin, where fists in the air are ready to greet them. These Brothers play a brand of country rock that recalls the heady days 10 or so years ago when country rock was taking over the universe. Besides their ripping guitar hooks and slinky beats, the Deadstrings possess a swagger straight out of early-Seventies Stones, with a dash of Dylan's wordiness thrown in for effect. It's all topped by the sympathetic harmonies of Kurt Marschke and Masha Marjieh, who seem especially raw and passionate. A male/female vocalist pairing hasn't been this intriguing since Whiskeytown. The band closing with a driving \"Sacred Heart\" left the crowd members sated but hopeful that the DBs will visit their hometown soon."
