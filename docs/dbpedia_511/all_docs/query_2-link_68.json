        "text": "“The California based folk artist got his start as more of a rock ‘n’ roll kid, but through influences like John Prine and Bob Dylan, landed on a softer, more old-fashioned sound in his solo career. That career has led to a decade of cross-country tours and several albums – all presented with a palpable level of sincerity. Foster isn’t reinventing the folk-music wheel but adding layers of his own observations and lived experiences to the rich mythologies of blue-collar heroes and rural history.” - Sandpoint Reader\n\nAuthentic roots music for the ears of old souls, award-winning songwriter Jonathan Foster is a recording artist and touring musician from Cranberry Lake, New York (hometown) and Redding, California (current city). Over the past dozen years he has released six independent studio albums, two live albums, and his latest LP Roadside Attraction. He has performed several U.S. tours spanning the country, playing over 700 shows with a sound referenced as Folk-Americana, featuring strong vocals woven with imaginative lyrics, acoustic guitar, harmonica, and engaging songs. Whether he’s in the mountains, the plains or on a city stage you’ll find this songbird singing. Jonathan enjoys sharing his music and stories from his travels at an intimate level mixing in observations of the people, places, and wonders of the world. Join Jonathan Foster as he explores and smiles his way through his musical journey and take his songs down the highway, water, or trail with you.\n\n\"Foster is original in his songwriting and his ability to tell stories through his music. If you mixed John Denver, Gordon Lightfoot, and Blaze Foley all together you would get Foster.” - Americana Highways\n\n“Foster’s new single, “The Mountain Echo,” with its warmly sung lyrics and gently rolling music, falls solidly in the folk tradition.” - The Advocate\n\nHis new album Roadside Attraction, is a snapshot of imagery presented through music and lyrics, primarily inspired by his years of touring solo across the continental United States. Accessible songs with in-focus hooks include the upbeat The Mountain Echo (reflection on primary school) and Lander Spring (the west), to thought provoking The Anchor (self-doubt) and The Warm Light (near death experience), to the laid back Cottonwood Vines (wine), the reckless Americana Insomnia (road tales), to the moody When You Leave (southwest), The Change (climate disruption), Roadside Table (season’s greetings) and his frame on traditional tune The Cuckoo (Appalachian). Take the exit, peak through the viewfinder, hear the depth of field, and enjoy the new long-player Roadside Attraction by Jonathan Foster.\n\n\"A breezy songwriting style, alternating between lyrical introspection and worldly observation, takes listeners on the road with him across America, admiring the beauty of rivers and forests while appreciating individuality along the way.\" - The Canton Rep"
