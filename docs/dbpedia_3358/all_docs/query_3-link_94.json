Please visit our Disclosure and Privacy Policy pages for further explanation.\n\nWhile exploring and writing about our travels here, we have uncovered some interesting and fun facts about North Carolina.\n\nAnd if you’ve lived here for a while or think you know this state pretty well, I guarantee you there are a few things here that are going to come as a surprise.\n\nThese North Carolina facts relate to the state’s history, geography, what North Carolina is known for today, and what makes it unique. So let’s take a break from ticking off our NC Bucket Lists and go over some things you should know about North Carolina but probably don’t.\n\nIf you’re searching for specific North Carolina tidbits, here’s how we’ve organized this guide:\n\nBasic Facts About North Carolina\n\nFacts About North Carolina’s Geography (Physical and Political)\n\nMore Natural Facts About North Carolina\n\nFacts About North Carolina History\n\nFacts About North Carolina Today\n\nBusinesses Started in North Carolina\n\nFamous People from North Carolina\n\nFamous Athletes\n\nNote: The sections from “Facts about Native Americans in North Carolina” through “Post-WWII Facts About North Carolina” are chronologically organized.\n\nBasic Facts About North Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina is commonly referred to as “Carolina” (sorry, South Carolina) and goes by two nicknames: The Tar Heel State and Old North State.\n\nAs of 2020, the population of North Carolina is 10.4 million.\n\nRaleigh is the capital of North Carolina today, but it wasn’t the first. Bath served as the first nominal capital and New Bern was established in 1766 as the first permanent capital. The government assembled in multiple other spots until 1792 when Raleigh was finally established as the permanent capital once and for all.\n\nOur state motto is “Esse Quam Videri,” which translates in English to “To Be Rather Than To Seem.”\n\nNorth Carolina’s unofficial State Slogan is “First in Flight; First in Freedom.”\n\nThe State Song is “The Old North State.”\n\nLike many states, North Carolina has even more inanimate and living insignia. Here they are in ABC order by category:\n\nState Beverage: Milk\n\nState Bird: Cardinal\n\nState Butterfly: Eastern tiger swallowtail\n\nState Colors: Red and blue\n\nState Dance: Shag\n\nState Fish: Red drum\n\nState Flower: Flowering dogwood\n\nState Food: Scuppernong grape and sweet potato\n\nState Fossil: Megalodon teeth\n\nState Gemstone: Emerald\n\nState Insect: Western honey bee\n\nState Mammal: Eastern gray squirrel\n\nState Marsupial: Virginia oppossum\n\nState Mineral: Gold\n\nState Reptile: Eastern box turtle\n\nState Rock: Granite\n\nState Shell: Scotch Bonnet\n\nState Tree: Pine\n\nRead More: The Karen Beasley Sea Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation Center (History + How to Visit)\n\nFacts About North Carolina’s Geography (Physical and Political)\n\nWith a total area of 53,819 square miles (139,391 sq km), North Carolina is the 28th largest state in the US.\n\nThere are 100 counties within North Carolina’s borders. The oldest county was Albermarle in Northeastern North Carolina, established in 1668 and abolished in 1739. In its place are Chowan County, Currituck County, Perquimans County, and Pasquotank County. The newest counties are Avery and Hoke, both established in 1911. Avery County was formed from parts of Caldwell County, Mitchell County, and Watauga County. Hoke County came from Cumberland County and Robeson County.\n\nNorth Carolina is typically broken down into three sections from west to east: the Mountains, the Piedmont, and the Coastal Plain.\n\nOur regions can be even more specifically broken down to include any of the following from west to east:\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains\n\nThe Great Smoky Mountains (Smokies)\n\nThe Blue Ridge Mountains\n\nThe High Country\n\nThe Foothills\n\nThe Piedmont\n\nThe Sandhills\n\nThe Coast\n\nThe Outer Banks\n\nThe Crystal Coast\n\nWestern North Carolina is home to the highest mountains in the Eastern US.\n\nAt 6,684 feet, Mount Mitchell in Yancey County is North Carolina’s highest peak and the highest peak east of the Mississippi River.\n\nAccording to archaeological evidence, the Uwharries are viewed as the oldest mountains in North America.\n\nMany diverse social and ecological systems are found in our mountains, and UNESCO recognized one of them (Grandfather Mountain) as an International Biosphere Reserve.\n\nThere are also a large number of waterfalls in Western North Carolina (near Asheville and in the High Country). Many of them are kid-friendly, too!\n\nOver in Jackson County, you’ll find Whitewater Falls, the highest waterfall in the eastern US, falling more than 800 feet.\n\nThe lowest point in North Carolina is where it meets the Atlantic Ocean (sea level) for 322 miles along our shoreline.\n\nThat includes the Outer Banks, which is so historically rough for sailors that it’s long been referred to as the “Graveyard of the Atlantic.”\n\nDid you know that the Fall Line (fall zone) divides Eastern and Central North Carolina? It’s a long line of erosion that runs along the east coast, where harder rocks change into softer, erosion-sensitive rocks.\n\nRead More: The NC Tripping North Carolina Travel Map\n\nMore Natural Facts About North Carolina\n\nThe Venus Flytrap is native to the eastern part of both Carolinas. However, its first written description was recorded in a 1759 letter from North Carolina’s then-colonial Governor Arthur Dobbs to botanist Peter Collinson.\n\nAnother native plant to North Carolina is the Muscadine. It’s typically used for wines, jellies, and juices today.\n\nOn today’s Roanoke Island, the oldest cultivated grapevine (Mothervine) continues to produce antioxidant-rich juices and health formulas. We created a map of farms where you can pick muscadine grapes in NC, in case you’re interested.\n\nRead More: The Best Waterfalls near Brevard\n\nFacts About North Carolina History\n\nThis section of North Carolina trivia is dedicated to NC history, which includes Native Americans and post-colonization through today.\n\nFacts About North Carolina’s Native Americans\n\nColonial Era North Carolina\n\nRevolutionary War Facts\n\nPost-Revolution Facts\n\n19th Century Facts\n\nPost-Civil War Facts\n\n20th Century Facts\n\nPost-WWII Facts\n\nRead More: The NC Museum of History in Raleigh (+7 Things We Love About It!)\n\nFacts About North Carolina’s Native Americans\n\nNative Americans had lived on this land for thousands of years before European arrival. Archaeologists have traced their presence back as far as 12,000 years ago to be more exact.\n\nWhen Europeans first arrived in the mid-1500s, estimates say 35,000 to 50,000 Tuscarora, Catawba, and Cherokee lived here.\n\nA series of trade networks thrived throughout this area, predating many of today’s industries with similar crafts and practices.\n\nFor example, many people know about the Seagrove Potters who live in today’s Randolph County. However, evidence shows that Native Americans had been making and firing items from clay as late as 3,000 years ago.\n\nClay was not the only material that was used by Native Americans in North Carolina. Evidence indicates that Mica was mined heavily in the Marion area and used as currency about 2,000 years ago. Mica is still abundant in the area, which is a big factor behind Marion‘s nickname “Mica Town.”\n\nDisease, violence, and forced removal by the American government led to a sharp decline in population, especially of the Catawba and Tuscarora people.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, the Cherokee sided with the British in the hopes that they’d receive protection from further settlement. Unfortunately, for the Cherokee, the British lost the war. Thus, any hope of favorable treatment by the new American government was gone, too.\n\nMany Cherokee people were eventually forced to leave during the tragic “Trail of Tears.” Some stayed behind and either fought for their land or evaded removal efforts. These Cherokee joined the Oconaluftee Cherokee who were allowed to stay in North Carolina. Today, the reservation known as the “Qualla Boundary” is where large numbers of Cherokee descendants live.\n\nIn total, 100,000 Native Americans still live in North Carolina. This is the eighth largest in the US and you won’t find any state east of the Mississippi River with a larger population.\n\nToday, the state recognizes eight tribes. They include the following:\n\nCoharie\n\nEastern Band of Cherokee\n\nHaliwa-Saponi\n\nLumbee\n\nMeherrin\n\nOccaneechi Band of Saponi Nation\n\nSappony\n\nWaccamaw-Siouan\n\nRead More: Colorful Fall Hikes in North Carolina (+ 20 Beautiful Places to Explore!)\n\nColonial Era NC Facts (16th Century to the Revolutionary War)\n\nBefore the English came to North Carolina, the area had already seen Europeans. Evidence shows that Spanish explorers spent time in Western North Carolina while searching for gold. Juan Pardo and his men even constructed the outposts of Cuenca and Fort San Juan near modern-day Morganton in Burke County.\n\nRoanoke Island is the location of the first attempted English Colony. In 1587, Virginia Dare was the first English child born in the colony. Sadly and mysteriously, the colony and all its inhabitants disappeared not long after arriving. Today, it’s the historic town of Manteo, the first of many Outer Banks towns you should explore upon arrival.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina were both one colony (Carolina), named by King Charles II in honor of his father Charles I.\n\nThe Carolina settlement was divided into two separate proprietary colonies in 1712 by the Lord’s Proprietors.\n\nRead More: 25+ Amazing Restaurants in Morganton and Nearby! (Map Included!)\n\nDuring its time as a proprietary colony, North Carolina was regarded as more dangerous than its neighbors. Pirates (including Blackbeard, aka Edward Teach) hid behind barrier islands and terrorized ships that crossed their paths.\n\nNorth Carolina officials were unable to control pirate activity and outside help came in. In November 1718, the Governor of Virginia (Alexander Spotswood) sent a detachment of soldiers to combat the pirates. They found Blackbeard and his men and engaged, killing the famous buccaneer and capturing many of his men and ships.\n\nIn 1729, North Carolina became a royal colony when it was sold to King George II by its proprietors.\n\nFrom then, North Carolina grew in population and attracted more and more settlers.\n\nMany of these settlers either brought enslaved Africans or purchased them to work and live in bondage. In 1712, there were about 800 enslaved people in North Carolina, and by 1767, about 41,000.\n\nAnother notable arrival came in 1753 when members of the Moravian Church arrived in Central North Carolina. In 1766, they began work on a town. Five additional communities surrounded Salem in the Wachovia tract and it was a powerful and profitable religious and economic center for many years.\n\nAt the same time, tensions were brewing between the English, its enemies, and its settlers.\n\nEurope’s Seven Year War traveled across the Atlantic and erupted into the French and Indian War between 1754-1763. Cherokee began attacking settlers in retaliation for the violence that occurred in Virginia. One major battle during this war occurred at Fort Dobbs in modern-day Statesville. Cherokee attacked the fort in February 1760 and provincial soldiers turned them back, killing more than 10 and suffering two losses.\n\nThe flames of discontent continued to burn, but this time, it was the settlers fighting against colonial officials. From 1765-1771, there were a series of skirmishes and battles known as the Regulator Movement (or War of the Regulation). Colonial forces won the Battle of Alamance in May 1771 and forced the Regulators they could find to sign loyalty oaths.\n\nRead More: 30+ Awesome Things to Do in Statesville\n\nRevolutionary War Facts about North Carolina\n\nOf course, the fighting only stopped for a short time. Many North Carolinians would become involved in a series of skirmishes known as the Revolutionary War. It might be incorrect to say we “joined” the war effort because North Carolina led the pack in declaring independence.\n\nIn 1774, Penelope Barker organized a group of women in Edenton to protest the 1773 Tea Act. It was the first recorded political demonstration by women in America.\n\nThe controversial Mecklenburg Declaration of Freedom was allegedly produced on May 20, 1775, in Charlotte. Its legitimacy is contentious at best. That’s because a copy wasn’t made publicly available until 1819.\n\nMany folks know our “First in Flight” license plates but there’s also “First in Freedom.” That’s partly because of the Mecklenburg Declaration of 1775, which made us the first state to declare independence.\n\nWhether or not you believe in the Meck Dec, the Halifax Resolves in April 1776 officially declared North Carolina’s independence months before the July 4 declaration by the Continental Congress.\n\nThe Halifax Resolves took place two months after the Battle of Moore’s Creek Bridge in Eastern North Carolina. Patriot troops defeated a Loyalist force there in one of the American Revolution’s earliest battles.\n\nAdditional Revolutionary War battles fought in North Carolina include:\n\nThe Battle of Ramsour’s Mill (June 20, 1780)\n\nThe Battle of Charlotte (September 26, 1780)\n\nBattle of Cowan’s Ford (February 1, 1781)\n\nThe Battle of Guilford Courthouse (March 15, 1781)\n\nThe Battle of Rockfish (August 2, 1781)\n\nBattle of Elizabethtown (August 27, 1781)\n\nRead More: National Parks Sites in North Carolina\n\nPost-Revolution Facts About North Carolina\n\nFayetteville may have lost out to Raleigh as the permanent capital of North Carolina (see below), but it wins the title of “First Place in North America Named for Marquis de Lafayette.” Today, numerous cities, counties, streets, and other places bear his name.\n\nAs one of our country’s 13 original states, North Carolina was the 12th to ratify the constitution.\n\nNorth Carolina was admitted to the union on November 21, 1789.\n\nAs we mentioned, Raleigh became the official capital of North Carolina in 1792.\n\nThe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is one of three institutions (along with the University of Georgia and the College of William and Mary) to claim the title of the nation’s oldest public university.\n\nOne fact that is not up for debate is that UNC was the first to hold classes (1795) and graduate students (1798).\n\n19th-Century Facts About North Carolina\n\nAnother North Carolina first is the Carolina Gold Rush, which officially started in 1799. Until its end in 1828, there were multiple gold-producing areas in North Carolina, and you can learn about them at the Reed Gold Mine in Cabarrus County.\n\nToday, you can even pan for gold there, as well as in various places, including Marion in McDowell County.\n\nHiram Rhodes Revels was born in Fayetteville (1822) and among other accomplishments, was the first African-American member of the United States Congress, representing Mississippi.\n\nIn 1853, the first North Carolina State Fair was held in Raleigh. The NC State Fairgrounds have hosted the event since 1928.\n\nCivil War Facts about North Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina’s place in the Civil War is well-known, too. Memorable battles fought here include:\n\nBattle of Goldsboro Bridge (1862)\n\nThe First and Second Battles of Fort Fisher (1864 and 1865)\n\nThe Battle of Bentonville (1865)\n\nAlso, did you know that Bennett Place in now-Durham is the site of the last and largest surrender of a major Confederate army? It took a couple of meetings but on April 26, 1865, General Johnston surrendered to General Sherman and the Union.\n\nRead More: 17 Amazing Eno River State Park Trails (+ Bonus Hikes)\n\nPost-Civil War Facts About North Carolina\n\nIf you’re familiar with Edgecombe County, then this might be one of the most obvious facts about North Carolina to you. Originally known as Freedom Hill, Princeville is the oldest town incorporated (1885) by African-Americans.\n\nPeople would not be happy with us for leaving out Biltmore Estate in this post about North Carolina facts. And how could we leave out America’s largest privately-owned house? The home officially opened in 1895 (on Christmas Eve) and is still owned by George Vanderbilt’s descendants.\n\nBefore the end of the 19th century, one of North Carolina’s darkest events took place. On November 10, 1898, white supremacists carried out a riot and insurrection in Wilmington. This resulted in the killing of 60 to 300-plus people, destruction of Black-owned property throughout the city, and the expulsion of opposition White and Black politicians from Wilmington.\n\n20th Century Facts About North Carolina\n\nThe first major event of the 20th century was a pretty big one.\n\nThe Wright Brothers (Orville and Wilbur) successfully flew the first self-propelled aircraft near Kitty Hawk on December 17, 1903. Each December, the Wright Brothers National Memorial celebrates its “First Flight” with fun throughout the entire day.\n\nThe Wright Brothers National Memorial is one of 12 national parks sites in North Carolina.\n\nYou might remember Salem from our “Colonial” section, and don’t worry. It’s still with us, just in hyphen form. In 1913, Salem joined the adjacent town of Winston to become our state’s best-known dash city of Winston-Salem.\n\nAnd Fayetteville has another contribution to the “First” fun. There, you’ll find a historical marker that commemorates Babe Ruth hitting his first professional home run there in 1914.\n\nIn 1915, Mount Mitchell and surrounding lands were established as North Carolina’s first state park.
