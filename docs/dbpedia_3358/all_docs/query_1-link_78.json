        "text": "Last month former GOP congressman J.D. Hayworth, who is challenging Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) in the Arizona Republican primary for U.S. Senate, saddled up with the far right “birthers,” who inaccurately believe President Obama was not born in the U.S. “Well, gosh, we all had to bring our birth certificates” in order “to play football,” he said, adding that “the President should come forward with the information, that’s all.” Last night on CNN, when host Campbell Brown asked if he really believes Obama is foreign-born, Hayworth dodged but later explained his comments from last month as raising from “identity theft” issues:\n\nHAYWORTH: All I said was this, and I’m responding to what constituents write me about. And they’re looking prospectively at every office, from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to city council.\n\nFor example, in Scottsdale, we had a situation where we had somebody running for the council under an assumed name who was a fugitive from justice. All I’m saying is, for every race across the country, especially with identity theft in the news, it would be great that people can confirm who they say they are.\n\nPressed again by Brown, Hayworth simply said he has “no qualms about who he is or who he says he is.” Watch it:"
