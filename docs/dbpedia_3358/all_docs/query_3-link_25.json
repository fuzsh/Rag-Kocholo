        "text": "Rev. Edgar Tufts 1870 – 1923\n\nThough he’s best known as the founder of Lees McRae College, Tufts also stands out as an innovative character\n\nwho found solutions for Banner Elk’s turn-of-the-century needs, including a hospital, a home for children, and even hydroelectric power.\n\nIsaac Dickson 1831 – 1918\n\nA former slave, this business leader was the first African American to serve on the Asheville School Committee, where he facilitated greater access for black children, and cast the deciding vote to found the city’s public school system.\n\nOwen Meredith Ballou 1766 – 1847\n\nEntrepreneur Owen Meredith Ballou made significant contributions to the industrialization and development of Ashe County. With iron as one of the foundations of the Industrial Revolution, Ballou established several forges, which acted as catalysts for the county’s economic growth.\n\nGertrude Dills McKee 1885 – 1948\n\nIn 1930, McKee of Sylva became the first woman elected to the North Carolina Senate. Known for her oratory skills, she drew upon her teaching background to scold senators she thought were dragging their feet on legislation, including funding for Western Carolina College (later University).\n\nCol. Robert Love 1760 – 1845\n\nAfter serving in the Revolutionary War, Love retired from the military, was awarded local land grants for his service, and moved to present-day Haywood County. One of the area’s early land speculators, he is regarded as the father of Waynesville for donating much of the property for the town’s square and municipal buildings. His political career included representing the state as it ratified the U.S. Constitution and working to finalize North Carolina’s western border—a move that created the state of Tennessee.\n\nMaggie Axe Wachacha 1892 – 1993\n\nWachacha learned the skills that would carry her through life at a very young age. Her father taught her to write in the Cherokee syllabary at the age of seven. Her aunt and grandmother began passing on the skills of midwifery and healing by the time she was 10. As an adult, Wachacha served more than 40 years as the clerk for the Cherokee Tribal Council, often walking more than 50 miles from her home in Graham County to town to record the meeting minutes. As a midwife and healer, she is said to have assisted with more than 3,000 births and helped countless others in need of her curative skills. In the mid-80s, Wachacha was named a Beloved Woman by the tribe, a title usually reserved for the widow of the Principal Chief.\n\nYonaguska approx. 1759 – 1839\n\nA peacetime Cherokee chief, Yonaguska prevented the federal government from moving his people to Western reservations while the head of the tribe. He also became an outspoken force for temperance among his tribesmen after breaking his own addiction to alcohol.\n\nTench Coxe 1755 – 1824\n\nIf your home is on land between Rutherford County and Asheville, chances are your property was once owned by Coxe, the region’s biggest land speculator. After the Revolutionary War, what was largely Cherokee territory—protected by the king of England—opened up to investors. Coxe, a famed industrialist (known for encouraging the development of cotton as a cash crop of the South), columnist, and politician, bought roughly 400,000 acres of Appalachia for about nine cents per acre.\n\nJohn Andrews Rice 1888 – 1968\n\nDuring the early ‘30s, Rice left his job at Florida’s Rollins College to start an institution of his own—one that would redefine the rules of higher learning. He created Black Mountain College, an institute equally known for letting students create their own courses of study, as well as attracting some of the greatest minds of the time to serve as faculty, including composer John Cage, inventor Buckminster Fuller, and artist Josef Albers. Though the college only operated from 1933 to 1956, it remains revered as one of America’s great experiments in higher education.\n\nJoyce Dugan b. 1948\n\nA teacher and leader, Joyce Dugan was the only woman to serve as Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (’95-’99). A reformer, she decentralized the chief’s power and created a division of the government to address cultural issues.\n\nDavid Lowry Swain 1801 – 1868\n\nThis Buncombe County politician served in the state’s House of Commons, where he pushed for the creation of more western counties, and at 31 he served as the state’s youngest governor. Swain eventually left politics to sit on the board of UNC, where he attempted to keep the college open during the Civil War. A Unionist, he helped negotiate the surrender of Raleigh to northern General William Tecumseh Sherman, sparing the city’s destruction in the process.\n\nWill West Long 1870 – 1947\n\nLong served as a Cherokee interpreter and expert resource for anthropologists studying the tribe during the early 20th century. He amassed collections of the tribe’s syllabary in an effort to preserve the language, served as a council member, and represented the Cherokee at regional festivals during a time of increased tourism throughout Western North Carolina."
