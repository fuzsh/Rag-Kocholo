The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:57 p.m., in room B-318, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Jim McCrery (Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding. [The advisory announcing the hearing follows:] ADVISORY FROM THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS SUBCOMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SECURITY CONTACT: (202) 225-9263 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE May 17, 2005 No. SS-1 McCrery Announces First in a Series of Subcommittee Hearings on Protecting and Strengthening Social Security Congressman Jim McCrery (R-LA), Chairman, Subcommittee on Social Security of the Committee on Ways and Means, today announced that the Subcommittee will hold the first in a series of hearings on protecting and strengthening Social Security. This hearing will examine the evolution of the Social Security safety net and its importance to vulnerable populations. The hearing will take place on Tuesday, May 17, 2005, in room B-318 Rayburn House Office Building, beginning at 2:00 p.m. In view of the limited time available to hear witnesses, oral testimony at this hearing will be from invited witnesses only. However, any individual or organization not scheduled for an oral appearance may submit a written statement for consideration by the Committee and for inclusion in the printed record of the hearing. BACKGROUND: The Social Security Act (P.L. 74-271) was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 14, 1935. Initially, Social Security was focused on the income needs of retired workers age 65 and older. Soon thereafter, protections for other vulnerable populations were added. The Social Security Act Amendments of 1939 (P.L. 76-379) expanded the scope of Social Security beyond protection of the individual worker to protection of the family by authorizing payments to the spouse and minor children of a retired worker or the survivor of the deceased worker. The Social Security Act Amendments of 1956 (P.L. 84-880) created the Social Security Disability Insurance program to provide protection against financial insecurity resulting from a disabled worker's loss of earnings. Social Security continues to play a key role in preserving the economic security of Americans. About one-in-six Americans receives a Social Security benefit. For one-third of the elderly, Social Security is virtually their only source of income. Poverty rates among the elderly fell from 35.2 percent in 1959, to only 10.2 percent in 2003--a reduction of more than two-thirds during the last 44 years. Younger workers and their families receive valuable disability and survivors' insurance protection. In fact, about one-in-three Social Security beneficiaries is not a retired worker. Although Social Security provides an essential safety net for workers and their families, roughly 2 million retirees who paid into Social Security throughout their working lives are collecting benefits that leave them below the poverty line. Moreover, the basic program was designed with circa World War II families in mind--in which the family breadwinner was usually the husband, the wife worked in the home, and marriages were less likely to end in divorce. However, women's workforce participation has more than doubled since the program's inception, and there are more two-earner and single-parent households. Social Security needs to evolve to meet the needs of our ever-changing society. In announcing the hearing, Chairman McCrery stated: ``Over the decades, Social Security has provided a vital income safety net for women, children, individuals with disabilities, and those with low earnings. As the Subcommittee begins its examination of ways to protect and strengthen Social Security, I am pleased to focus first on the history of Social Security's essential safety net, and its importance to those who are most vulnerable.'' FOCUS OF THE HEARING: The Subcommittee will examine the evolution of Social Security and its importance and effectiveness in meeting the needs of vulnerable populations.

Chairman MCCRERY. The meeting will come to order. Good afternoon everyone. I am pleased to chair this first in a series of Subcommittee hearings on protecting and strengthening Social Security. The goal of the hearings is to examine ways to protect Social Security to ensure seniors and near seniors will receive exactly what they have been promised, while strengthening Social Security for younger workers. Thanks to the leadership of President Bush and President Clinton before him, Americans understand Social Security faces financial challenges that must be addressed. The question before this Subcommittee is, of course, how do we address those challenges? Social Security has a long history of providing benefits for families in distress. Only 4 years after Social Security retirement benefits were enacted in 1935, the Congress passed amendments extending benefits to surviving widows and children. In the decades since then, Congress further expanded Social Security's coverage for at-risk Americans, establishing benefits for divorced spouses, adopted children, and those with disabilities. Turning to our topic for today's hearing, how Social Security has evolved over the decades and its importance for the most vulnerable in our society, it is most appropriate that we have Jo Anne Barnhart, the Commissioner of Social Security, as our first witness. The Commissioner has been working on issues involving women, children, and the elderly, not only at the Social Security Administration (SSA), but throughout her career in public service. We also will hear from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and other expert witnesses about how Social Security is especially important to low-wage earners, women, and those with disabilities, and how Social Security has not kept up with changes in society and in the American family. Social Security affects the lives of nearly every American, and the deliberation regarding its future is far too important for partisan politics. I will look forward to working with all my Subcommittee colleagues on this historic opportunity to thoughtfully and carefully consider all options to strengthen and update this essential program. I would ask the Ranking Member, Mr. Levin, if he has any opening remarks? Mr. LEVIN. I do, and thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are pleased that we are having this hearing, and your approach to witnesses means that we should be able to have a meaningful range of views on these issues. As you said, a major focus of the hearing is going to be the impact of Social Security on some of our most vulnerable populations, elderly, widows, children, disabled workers, and the poor. Let me make three points on these matters. First, Social Security has been a major resource for millions to move out of poverty and for millions of others to keep their earlier middle class standard of living, to maintain the independence, to keep living their lives as they had done in earlier years. I assume we are going to hear this from our distinguished Commissioner and others. The facts briefly, 4 in 10 elderly widows rely on Social Security for 90 percent of their income or more; 12 million seniors would fall into poverty without Social Security; 6.4 million children live in households with Social Security income, and over a third of them would be poor without Social Security; and nearly 7 million disabled workers and their families receive Social Security benefits, and more than half would fall into poverty without them. Those groups depend on Social Security's guaranteed benefits. They know they can't outlive it. They know it will keep up with inflation and allow them to maintain their standard of living. It will be there even if they retire or become disabled at a time when the stock market is down. It will protect their families too, even if they haven't had time to accumulate enough funds in an account to cover multiple people over a long period of time. So, Social Security provides dignity as well as income. In all cases the benefits being provided to vulnerable populations were earned, earned by the worker herself or by a spouse or parent. Second, because both the dignity and the independence are so important for vulnerable populations, we have been very concerned about what would be the impact of the President's privatization proposals on these populations. The dangers are clear, even though the Administration has attempted to minimize them with varying statements. Last week, for example, Allan Hubbard, one of the President's top advisers on Social Security, confirmed what we had intuited, the President's plan would apply the middle class benefit cut, which would cut benefits up to 40 percent for future middle class workers, to widows and children too. Also, survivors would be subject to the benefit cut if the wage earner had earned more than $20,000 while working, even if the family was quite poor after his or her passing. Shortly after that, a White House spokesperson cast a long shadow on earlier statements by the President that disabled workers would not face benefit cuts, saying the details would need to be, and I quote, ``worked out through the legislative process,'' end of quote, and refusing to say benefits would not be cut. It is not surprising that the White House plans to cut benefits for everyone, not just retirees, since without these benefit cuts they can't offset the new shortfall created by their private accounts. Both the proposal that the President initially called, in quotes, ``a good blueprint,'' and the sliding scale benefit cuts he endorsed a few weeks ago, propose to cut disability and survivor benefits. The President's privatization proposals to date would dramatically reduce the guaranteed Social Security benefit for over 70 percent of all future beneficiaries, and would increase it little if any for those not being cut. If individuals opted for private accounts, they would be subject to a second cut in their guaranteed benefit, even if those accounts did poorly. When these two benefit cuts are combined, most people would be left with only a tiny fraction of their currently scheduled guaranteed Social Security benefit, and no guarantee that their account will beat the odds and do well. The change would negatively impact all Americans, but reducing guaranteed benefits would be particularly harmful to women, disabled workers, children, and those with modest earnings. Third and last, some will argue that Social Security does not always strike a perfect balance between protecting the vulnerable and paying people benefits based on their contributions. We will hear about some of these issues today, and we should. It would be contradictory to use the Social Security's failure to be perfect in every part of its design as an excuse to replace it with a system that would undermine or destroy its numerous basic strengths, and replace it with many provisions that could create far greater problems of equity and adequacy. It has not been an easy struggle to bring about the improvements already in place in Social Security. For example, when the creation of the Disability Insurance Program was first proposed, all 10 Ways and Means Republicans opposed its creation. Democrats look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to continue perfecting Social Security. We stand firmly that no set of benefit changes to Social Security's guaranteed benefits, however worthy, could offset the harm of beginning to phase out that guaranteed benefit, and replacing a guaranteed benefit with private accounts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman MCCRERY. Thank you, Mr. Levin. Indeed, this is the legislative process that we are engaged in now and I hope that we will listen to the witnesses today and get the facts, and then discuss those facts on both sides of the aisle and try to improve the Social Security program together. Mr. LEVIN. All for it. Chairman MCCRERY. Thank you for your comments. Our first witness today is the Commissioner of the SSA, the Honorable Jo Anne Barnhart. Commissioner Barnhart? STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE JO ANNE B. BARNHART, COMMISSIONER, SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Commissioner BARNHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I am very happy to be here today to testify about how Social Security has evolved since its inception in 1935. Today, Social Security pays over $493 billion in monthly cash benefits to over 47 million workers and their families to replace, in part, the loss of income due to retirement, disability, or death. By providing these benefits, Social Security helps ensure economic security for millions of Americans. Social Security is the major source of income for most of the elderly population. In fact, over 90 percent of individuals age 65 and over receive Social Security benefits. About two-thirds of these beneficiaries receive most of their income from Social Security, and for over one-fifth of them, Social Security is their only source of income. Throughout its 70-year history, Social Security has undergone numerous changes. Having begun as a retirement program for a limited segment of the working population, today it affords economic protection to the entire family, and at all stages in life. Social Security plays a key role keeping millions of our most vulnerable citizens, the elderly, the disabled and children out of poverty. My written testimony includes an extensive discussion of the changes that have occurred since Social Security began. These changes show that the history of the Social Security program is one of change, but in the interest of time this afternoon I am only going to make a few general observations. From adding family protections, to expanding the program and addressing financial issues, Congress over the years has taken action to strengthen and to preserve Social Security. Today the program is facing new challenges, challenges that are driven by demographics. Baby Boomers are rapidly approaching retirement, families are having fewer children, and people are living longer. As a result, it will not be possible to pay scheduled benefits without making additional changes to our current pay-as-you-go Social Security program. While we are in sound fiscal health in the near term, I believe, as do my fellow trustees, that the future projected shortfalls should be addressed in a timely manner to allow for a gradual phasing in for the necessary changes. The sooner adjustments are made, the less abrupt they will have to be to achieve sustainable solvency. As you know, a sustainable reform of the system requires actuarial balance over the 75-year projection period and stable or rising trust funds at the end of that 75-year period. I again want to thank the Chairman for holding today's hearing. As President Bush said, ``This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other Presidents and other generations. We will confront them with focus and clarity and courage.'' With the President's leadership and that of this Committee, I am certain that we will be able to address the needs of our changing society and provide for a Social Security program that our citizens can count on. I would like to take this opportunity to make clear that current and near retirees can be assured that their scheduled benefits are secure and will be paid. As we look to the future, our actions must signal to younger generations of Americans that we are committed to strengthening the program that protected our parents, our grandparents, and our great grandparents. By doing so, we restore their faith and confidence in the most successful domestic program in our Nation's history. As a nation, we have a proud history of grappling with difficult issues, and we have done this best when we worked together. As the discussions on strengthening the program continue, the SSA will be available to provide assistance to Congress and the analysis of any proposed changes, and of course, we will continue to faithfully serve the American people to the best of our ability. At this time I would like to thank you again for inviting me to testify, and I would be happy to try to answer any questions that any of you may have. [The prepared statement of Commissioner Barnhart follows:] Statement of The Honorable Jo Anne B. Barnhart, Commissioner, Social Security Administration Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. It gives me great pleasure to be invited here today to testify about how Social Security has developed and evolved over time. Since its inception in 1935, Social Security has developed into one of the most successful domestic program in our Nation's history. Let me begin by telling you about what we do and how we do it. Last year, Social Security paid over $493 billion in monthly cash benefits to over 47 million workers and their families to replace, in part, the loss of income due to retirement, disability, or death. By providing these benefits, Social Security helps ensure economic security for millions of Americans. Social Security is the major source of income for most of the elderly population. In fact, over 90 percent of individuals age 65 and over receive Social Security benefits. About two--thirds of these beneficiaries receive most of their income from Social Security. For over one-fifth of them, Social Security is their only source of income. As you know, Social Security involves more than paying cash benefits. In this fiscal year, SSA will: Process almost 6 million claims for benefits; Take applications, secure and evaluate evidence for, and issue 18 million new and replacement Social Security number (SSN) cards; Process 267 million earnings items to maintain workers' lifelong earnings records; Handle approximately 52 million phone calls to our 800- number; and Issue 136 million Social Security Statements. SSA does all this while keeping administrative expenses under 2 percent of total outlays of Social Security and SSI benefits. You can see that Social Security plays a key role keeping millions of our most vulnerable citizens, the elderly and children, out of poverty. We take very seriously our commitment to giving the American people the service they deserve; improving program integrity through sound financial stewardship, ensuring the program's solvency for future generations, and maintaining the quality of staff the Agency needs to provide a high level of service and stewardship. Now I would like to provide some background as to how Social Security began and how it has continued to develop and evolve over time. The Creation of Social Security The Social Security Act 1935 was a response to the economic crisis resulting from the Great Depression. At the height of the Great Depression, many older Americans were living in poverty. The Committee on Economic Security was appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt to confront the crisis. The Committee recommended that the federal government create a national system of unemployment and old-age benefits. Acting on those recommendations, and behind the driving force of President Roosevelt, Congress enacted the Social Security Act, which was signed into law on August 14, 1935. The Act established a federal social insurance program for the aged financed through payroll taxes paid by employees and their employers (2 percent on the first $3,000 in earnings divided equally between employee and employer). The financing was based on the concept of ``pay-as-you-go'' or PAYGO. Under the PAYGO system, Social Security contributions of current workers fund the Social Security benefits of current beneficiaries. Congress selected this method of financing because of the great number of older Americans who were living in poverty at the time of the Great Depression. With the severity of the economic situation at the time, and because most of them would not have been able to find employment and then contribute to the system long enough to be eligible for benefits, Congress decided that this generation of older persons should receive Social Security benefits, despite not having contributed to the system. Thus, most of the first generation of Social Security recipients contributed either very little or not at all to Social Security. The original old-age insurance system created by Title II of the Act provided retirement benefits to insured worker at age 65. The benefit was based on total wages, but a weighted formula was used to provide a greater return on payroll taxes paid in to low-wage earners. At that time, no benefits were provided for spouses and children. If a worker attained age 65 but was ineligible for benefits or died before reaching the age of 65, Social Security provided a lump sum payment to the worker or his/her estate. Collection of payroll taxes began in 1937 and benefit payments were scheduled to commence in 1942. This provided time to buildup the Social Security Trust Fund. Any surplus funds collected were to be invested in U.S. government securities. The Amendments 1930s/1940s: Family Protections Added In 1939, Congress amended the Social Security program to shift its focus from protection of the individual worker to protection of the family. The new legislation provided benefits to aged wives/widows, young children of a retired or deceased worker, young widows caring for a child, and dependent parents of a retired or deceased worker. In addition, in response to public pressure, the amendments allowed initial benefits to be paid beginning in 1940 instead 1942, as originally scheduled. Following the implementation of the 1939 amendments, the system remained essentially unchanged throughout the 1940s. 1950s: Expansion of the Program The 1950 amendments made substantial changes to the scope of the program. This legislation broadened the program to cover many jobs that previously had been excluded, such as farm and domestic workers and, on a voluntary basis, State and local government employees not under a pension plan. This legislation also greatly increased benefit levels. Wage credits were also provided to those in military service. To finance these improvements, the amendments created a revised schedule for gradually increasing tax rates for employers, employees and the self-employed and increased the contribution and benefit base (the maximum amount of earnings subject to payroll tax and used in benefit computations). Four years later, in 1954, another expansion in worker coverage took place. Social Security coverage was extended to farm self-employed workers and to professional self-employed workers (except lawyers, doctors, dentists and other medical groups). In addition, coverage was extended to State and local government employees covered under a pension plan (except firemen and policemen), on a voluntary basis. By the mid-1950s, 20 years after the enactment of Social Security, almost 90 percent of workers were given protection under the program. In addition to this expansion, the 1954 amendments increased benefit levels and raised the contribution and benefit base. In the early 1950s there was a growing recognition that the dangers of economic insecurity due to disability needed to be addressed. As a result, the 1954 amendments began the process of protecting workers from income loss due to disability. Congress enacted a disability ``freeze'' provision on a disabled worker's earnings record. While no cash benefits were payable under the provision, workers who were permanently disabled and met the insured status test at the time they became disabled could have their Social Security eligibility preserved by excluding periods of disability when computing subsequent retirement or survivors' benefits. This provision prevented loss of retirement and survivors' benefits due to disability. Social Security disability cash benefits were authorized under the amendments 1956. The program established a cash program beginning in 1957 for totally disabled workers between the ages of 50-65. The program established the Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund and was financed by an increase in the employee/employer payroll tax. The amendments also provided benefits to a dependent child, over the age of 18, of a retired or deceased worker if the child became disabled before the age of 18. In addition, benefits to female workers and wives were made available at age 62 instead of age 65, but at a reduced level to take into account the longer collection period. At age 62, widows and dependent parents could receive benefits at an unreduced rate. In 1958, the program extended benefits to spouses and children of disabled workers. 1960s: Disability Program Expanded & Medicare Began By the mid-1960s, the OASDI program was essentially the program that exists today. Coverage was nearly universal so that almost all individuals retiring in the years following would be eligible for benefits. Two amendments were passed in the early 1960s. In 1960, the age requirement for disability, which was originally limited to those who were at least 50, was abandoned. In 1961, all retirees were now allowed to collect reduced benefits at age 62 instead of 65. Concerned over the cost of health care for the elderly population, Congress passed ``Medicare'' legislation in 1965. The legislation consisted of two major components. part A was hospital insurance that provided basic protection against hospital costs and other related care. This portion would be financed by an additional payroll tax on employers, employees and the self-employed. part B was supplementary medical insurance that provided coverage for physicians' services and other health care. Enrollment in part B was voluntary and was funded through general revenues and premiums paid by enrollees. Separate trust funds were created for each part of the program. In addition to the Medicare Program, the amendments included an increase in benefits and as well as an increase in the earnings base. Throughout the remainder of the decade, benefit levels continued to increase, as did the earnings base. In addition, in 1967, Social Security began providing monthly cash benefits for disabled widows and disabled dependent widowers; these benefits were available as early as age 50. 1970s/1980s: COLAs Introduced & Long-Term Financing Addressed Throughout the program's history, Congress has maintained the value of Social Security benefits by periodically enacting across-the-board increases in benefits. However, in 1972, Congress decided to link benefits directly to changes in the Consumer price Index (CPI). The first automatic COLA adjustment took effect in June 1975. Prior to this time, Congress voted for increases in benefits directly. In addition, the legislation increased the contribution and benefit base and provided for automatic adjustments in this ceiling. Based on economic projections in the mid-1970's, it was then estimated that initial benefits as a percent of pre-retirement earnings (replacement rates) would increase significantly for future retirees. Initial benefits were rising faster than either wages or prices. In 1977, Congress raised the payroll tax rates and increased the contribution and benefit base. Congress also corrected the most serious flaw in the method for computing the initial benefit level. Congress modified the benefit formula in order to provide that, from generation to generation, comparable workers would receive comparable replacement rates. Unfortunately, constant replacement rates for initial benefits become unsustainable when the worker to beneficiary ratio deteriorates. Today, we know that the ratio is about 3 workers for every beneficiary and is expected to fall to unsustainable levels (about 2:1) around 2030. In the late 1970s and early 1980's, high inflation rates caused a serious and immediate financing crisis for the program. President Ronald Reagan appointed a blue-ribbon panel known as the Greenspan Commission to study the financing issues and recommend legislative changes. As a result of the Commission's findings, Congress made significant changes in the program in April 1983. The major provisions included: Gradual increase in the normal retirement age from age 65 to age 66 by 2009 and 67 by 2027. Expanded coverage to newly hired federal civilian employees and those working in non-profit organizations. Acceleration of scheduled tax increases for employers and employees. Permanent increases in self-employment tax rates. Inclusion of up to half of Social Security benefits in the taxable income of higher income beneficiaries (this money would then be transferred to the Social Security trust funds). The 1983 amendments were designed to achieve solvency for the 75 year projection period by initially building large Trust Fund reserves which could be used to cover costs in the future. As designed, it was clear that near the end of the 75 year period, the trust funds would run cash flow deficits prior to its exhaustion. A sustainable reform of the system requires actuarial balance over the 75 year projection period and stable or rising Trust Fund balances at the end of that period. 1990s and Beyond While a number of amendments have been legislated since 1983, many of these, such as the Social Security Administrative Reform Act 1994 that established the Social Security Administration as an independent agency, have impacted more or how Social Security operates as an agency. There have been few programmatic changes. The 1993 amendments made up to 85 percent of Social Security benefits subject to income tax for individuals whose income, plus one-half of their benefits, exceed $34,000 (single) and $44,000 (couple), with the additional revenue credited to the Health Insurance (HI) trust fund. And in April 2000, legislation was enacted to eliminate the retirement earnings test at the full-benefit retirement age, giving today's retirees the opportunity to supplement their incomes and to continue to contribute to society through work, if they choose, without reducing their Social Security benefits. However, while the actions taken in the 1980's resolved the immediate short-range financing crisis, the issue of long-range solvency arose again in the 1990's. These issues were addressed directly by the bipartisan 1994-96 Advisory Council on Social Security and have been the center of a continuing national debate since then. Throughout this debate, the importance of preserving Social Security for those members of our society who depend upon it--the elderly, women, minorities, and people with disabilities--has always been of primary concern to policymakers. As I stated earlier, Social Security quickly evolved from a program for retired workers to one affording economic protection to the entire family. Over one-third of today's Social Security beneficiaries are not retirees. The program has since developed into one that provides a large measure of economic well-being for millions of Americans. Today, Social Security provides not only retirement benefits but valuable survivorship and disability insurance for workers and their families. As you well know, the Social Security program is gender and race neutral. We treat individuals with identical earnings histories the same in terms of benefits. However, due to demographic trends, certain groups--like women--benefit from various features of the Social Security program. These features include a progressive benefit formula, automatic cost-of-living adjustments and guaranteed benefits for dependants and survivors. Women--who on average live longer, make less money and spend more time out of the workforce raising children than men--find these elements of the program's benefit structure particularly helpful. Social Security has provided a solid floor of financial protection that has allowed the great majority of Americans to retire with the dignity that comes from financial independence, without fear of poverty or reliance on others for nearly 70 years. In addition, it has developed into the most important program to prevent families from falling into poverty upon the sudden and often unexpected loss of income due to the worker's disability or death. As my testimony illustrates, the history of the Social Security program is a history of change. And Social Security will need modifications in the future to address the challenges the program is currently facing. Today, the country's demographics are working against us: Baby Boomers are rapidly approaching retirement, families are having fewer children, and people are living longer. As America ages, it will become more and more difficult to pay promised benefits without making changes. While we are in sound fiscal health in the near term, I believe--as do my fellow trustees--that the future projected shortfalls should be addressed in a timely manner to allow for a gradual phasing in of the necessary changes. The sooner adjustments are made, the smaller and less abrupt they will have to be. Payroll taxes coming into Social Security will cover all currently promised benefits until 2017. In that year, Social Security will need to use the interest earned on the bonds to help pay benefits and then begin redeeming the bonds themselves. These bonds--backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government--will be gone by 2041. Unless changes are made there will only be enough money coming into the system to pay 74% of promised benefits at that time. Ask yourself how your personal life would be affected if all of a sudden you learned that your salary was being cut by 26 percent. For most Americans this sort of reduction would be difficult--if not impossible--to absorb. For the two-thirds of Americans receiving benefits from Social Security who depend on our checks for the majority of their income, it is a drastic measure that we must avoid. Our parents and grandparents could feel assured about the promise of a secure future. I believe that we have an obligation to ensure that Social Security's safety net is also there for our children and grandchildren. As a nation, we have a proud history of grappling with difficult issues, and we have done this best when we work together. Social Security is no exception. Since 1935, Congress has legislated changes as necessary to meet the changing needs of the American people and to ensure that the program was adequately funded to provide for these changes. I am confident that we will do so again. I want to again thank the Chairman for holding today's hearing. As President George W. Bush said, ``This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other presidents, and other generations. We will confront them with focus and clarity and courage.'' With the President's leadership and that of this Committee, I am certain that we will address the needs of our changing society and provide for a Social Security program that our citizens can count on to be there for them. Let me take this opportunity to make clear that current and near-beneficiaries can be assured that their scheduled benefits are secure and will be paid. Our actions must signal to younger generations of Americans that we are committed to strengthening Social Security. By doing so, we restore their faith and confidence in the most successful domestic program in our Nation's history. As the discussions on strengthening the program continues, the Social Security Administration will be available to provide assistance to the Congress in the analysis of any proposed changes and we will continue to faithfully serve the American people to the best of our ability. I want to thank you again for inviting me to testify. I would be happy to answer any of your questions. Chairman MCCRERY. Thank you, Commissioner Barnhart. You stated in your written testimony that if Congress fails to act to strengthen Social Security the trust funds will become exhausted, and at that point there would only be sufficient money coming in through the payroll tax to pay about 74 percent of benefits. Is that according to the Social Security actuaries? Commissioner BARNHART. It is. It is according to our independent Social Security actuary, and as published in the Trustees' Report most recently issued, the one in March of this year. Chairman MCCRERY. Obviously, if a worker faced a 26-percent cut in his salary, that would be a pretty dramatic consequence for him and his family. So, that would be something that we would, I hope, try to avert as a cliff at some date, whether it is 2041 or 2042, or even 2052, as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says. We would like to avert that cliff from occurring. Whenever that date is--and your actuaries say 2041 now, I believe--doesn't that reduction in benefits get worse following that year? Commissioner BARNHART. In fact, the reduction benefit moves from 26 percent to 32 percent over time. Yes, I think that is the point the Chairman is making. Chairman MCCRERY. Yes, ma'am. Commissioner BARNHART. That 26 percent is the initial reduction that is required in 2041, but over time, as ever increasing numbers of boomers are collecting benefits and people are coming in after them, eventually it would require a 32-percent reduction in benefits by the end of the 75-year period. Chairman MCCRERY. So, initially, there is a 26-percent cut in benefits, but it does not just stay there. So, the system wouldn't be capable of paying 74 percent of the currently promised benefits forever? Commissioner BARNHART. No. Absent any changes, that is absolutely correct, Mr. Chairman. Chairman MCCRERY. Which brings up the question, I think, of how we fund a plan like this. The pay-as-you-go system, while it worked well when we had a lot of workers for every retiree, has changed dramatically because of the demographic changes that you have spoken about, and now we have approximately 3.3 workers for every retiree, and that is going down. In your opinion, and I know you have looked at this in your capacity as Commissioner and in other public service, does it make sense for us to examine perhaps prefunding some of the out-year obligations, and investing that prefunding in real assets to get a higher rate of return and help us with those obligations in the out-years? Commissioner BARNHART. Let me say a couple of things, if I may. The Chairman has made a number of important points. The first is that it is really important that whatever we do, we take action sooner as opposed to later. The fact of the matter is, the sooner action is taken, the greater the range of choices, the longer time people have to adjust to the changes, and the changes can be gradual and phased in, not unlike what happened with the 1983 legislation in terms of increasing the retirement age. In terms of the point about the prefunding, I think clearly this whole situation is due to demographics. We have seen the number of workers to retirees shrink over time, and it is going to go down even further. We are at 3.3 workers per retiree today; eventually, it will go down to two, and then below two. That is the problem as we look ahead at the promised level of benefits. There is no question that if you engage in some sort of prefunding, one of the things you do is reduce the potential burden on future taxpayers. There is no question about that. As you look out over time, many private pension plans rely on prefunding to some degree, not necessarily in total, but most plans do have prefunding to some degree. Chairman MCCRERY. In fact, the government requires it, don't we? Commissioner BARNHART. Yes, in fact, we do. Chairman MCCRERY. Yes. So, it would seem that if it made sense for private pension plans, it might make sense for our pension plan for the Social Security system. As far as I know, there are only two ways to do that, direct government investment into real assets of the Social Security Trust Fund, or personal accounts. Can you think of another way that we could prefund the system? Commissioner BARNHART. Right at this very moment I am at a loss to come up with another way. There may be people who work in the field of insurance and investment that could come up with something, but, no, I can't come up with others at this point. Chairman MCCRERY. Lastly, let us talk about this issue of disability benefits because a lot has been said about--well, the President's plan would not only reduce retirement benefits but would reduce disability benefits. To your knowledge, has the Administration proposed any plan that would cut disability benefits? Commissioner BARNHART. It is my understanding that it is the President's intent that disability and survivors' benefits remain intact, and that the issue really is--whatever the ultimate plan ends up being-looking at the transition from disability into retirement. Chairman MCCRERY. So, you don't know of any Administration plan that would specifically cut disability benefits? Commissioner BARNHART. I don't know of any plan like that, no. Chairman MCCRERY. As the Commissioner of the SSA, don't you think you would know if there were such a plan? Commissioner BARNHART. I think the President has made clear in the statements that he has made publicly that his intent from the very beginning was that the disability and survivor programs must be preserved--that was one of his original six principles. Since then, there have been a number of opportunities and public appearances to address that issue, and it is my understanding that the intent is that the disability and survivors programs be protected. Chairman MCCRERY. Thank you very much. Mr. Levin? Mr. LEVIN. You said disability and survivors? Commissioner BARNHART. Yes. Mr. LEVIN. Do you know what was in Plan Two of the Social Security Commission appointed by the President? Commissioner BARNHART. I am generally familiar with it. I couldn't speak to every single detail, but yes, I am generally familiar. Mr. LEVIN. Do you know that under that plan both survivors and disability benefits would be cut? Commissioner BARNHART. I am aware of that, but as I also recall, if I may say, Mr. Levin, is that the Commission stated in their report that that should not be considered a recommendation on their part to take that action as far as disability. Mr. LEVIN. It was in the Commission Two Plan, was it not? Commissioner BARNHART. It was in the plan, but they did make that point. Mr. LEVIN. That plan was called a good blueprint by the President. I know you are an appointee of the President, but I do think it is important that the record be straight. He called that a good blueprint. Tell me where the Administration has officially said that there would be no cut in survivors' benefits? For example, what the President suggested, the middle class benefit cuts, would that not apply to disability benefits? Commissioner BARNHART. I think that my--again, I can only say what my understanding is, Mr. Levin, and my understanding is that the disability---- Mr. LEVIN. I am talking about survivors. Commissioner BARNHART. My understanding was that it was the intent to protect those programs and those benefits. Mr. LEVIN. I think you are wrong. I think the survivor portion, when the President proposed it, was not taken out from those cuts. Isn't it true if you would exempt both disability and survivor benefit cuts, you would have to have even more cuts for retirees in order to address solvency? Commissioner BARNHART. I think, obviously, it would depend on how one chose to approach---- Mr. LEVIN. Right. If you immunize those portions, it affects the retirement programs, doesn't it? Commissioner BARNHART. Well, depending on how one goes about financing the reforms that one puts in place. Mr. LEVIN. The more you exempt people from those cuts, the more you have to look elsewhere, right? Commissioner BARNHART. Well, I think it is true that in terms of looking at what the total solvency shortfall is, if you look at protecting certain categories of people who are receiving benefits today--and I think that is what you are saying--then you do have to look at making up the difference in the shortfall in other places. However, it would depend on how the Congress and the President ultimately decided to approach the whole solvency issue. Mr. LEVIN. Does Mr. Hubbard work for the President? Commissioner BARNHART. To the best of my knowledge he does, yes. Mr. LEVIN. Did he not say recently that the middle class benefit approach, benefit cut approach put forth by the President would apply to survivors? Commissioner BARNHART. To be honest, Mr. Levin, I couldn't speak to what every single person has---- Mr. LEVIN. He is not a single person. He is an adviser on Social Security. Commissioner BARNHART. I understand, but there are many people that are speaking on the issue around the country, and obviously, I do my best to keep up with what everyone is saying, but I am really not in a position to speak to what every person allegedly said in a particular setting. I apologize, but I am just really not in that position to do so today. Mr. LEVIN. The 26-percent cut that you mentioned, that would be a cut from what was scheduled under wage indexing, correct? So, with the 26-percent cut people would still be receiving more in real dollar terms then than a recipient is receiving now? Commissioner BARNHART. Just to clarify---- Mr. LEVIN. The answer is yes, right? Commissioner BARNHART. I want to make sure I understand what you are saying. The current benefit is waged indexed, and the 26 percent reflects a cut in that wage indexed benefit. So, what you are asking me is, is that more or less than--I just want to make sure I understand. Mr. LEVIN. Than someone today is receiving. In real dollar terms it would be a cut from the projected increase, the scheduled increase under wage indexing, but that amount would be higher than a beneficiary is now receiving. Commissioner BARNHART. My understanding is that all benefits, whether it is price indexing or wage indexing, the benefit still goes up as compared to today. Mr. LEVIN. It goes up much more under wage---- Commissioner BARNHART. In real dollars. Obviously, it goes up much more. Mr. LEVIN. I think the answer to my question is yes. We just---- Commissioner BARNHART. Well, I guess I would say though that depending on how one does the price indexing---- Mr. LEVIN. No. I am talking about right now, wage indexing is there. I am saying if it is not modified, somebody would be receiving more today with this 26 percent cut. It would be a 26 percent cut from the wage indexed benefit, right? Commissioner BARNHART. That is right. That is what the 26 percent cut would be. Mr. LEVIN. Okay. I just wanted to finish by saying we can hear today from everybody about strengthening Social Security. In our judgment you don't strengthen it by replacing it. Thank you. Chairman MCCRERY. Mr. Shaw? Mr. SHAW. Mr. Chairman, I think the questions I had thought to ask are all out the window now that Mr. Levin has completed his comments. As I understand Mr. Levin, in answering his own question, said that the benefits would be a better deal with a 20 some percent cut, which for some reason goes over my head. I don't really understand that, because I think that the workers are---- Mr. LEVIN. I didn't say that. Mr. SHAW. I didn't interrupt you. This would be a severe cut. It would be--it would throw literally tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of our senior citizens into below the poverty line. This is what we have to avert. Mr. Levin also commented in saying that the President said that the second plan that was in the Commission report was a good blueprint. That is in error. The President said that the Commission report was a good blueprint, and there were many plans in there. There were three of them and one of them actually is an add-on. I would like to comment too on what Mr. Levin said in setting out his blueprint, much of which I agree with. He said no decrease in benefits. I don't think we have to decrease benefits, and I am going to work hard to pass a plan that doesn't decrease benefits, and I am not talking about the 27 percent cut not being a cut in benefits, because I certainly do understand that it is. In fact, if you look at H.R. 750, the ``Social Security Guarantee Plus Act of 2005,'' it maintains the existing level of benefits. Mr. Levin also said we must retain the guarantees under Social Security. If you look at H.R. 750, it does guarantee. In fact, the name of the bill is the Social Security Guarantee Plus Plan. Then we have to go back and say, well, how do you maintain these guarantees? Do you maintain them through a promise to borrow? Do you maintain them by increasing taxes, or do you maintain them by now starting to prefund Social Security for younger workers? Commissioner Barnhart, do you understand that those are the choices if we are going to maintain benefits, or can you think of anything to add to---- Commissioner BARNHART. In terms of the---- Mr. SHAW. That I have just given? Commissioner BARNHART. The array of choices that we have? Mr. SHAW. Yes. Commissioner BARNHART. Traditionally, as you look back over time, Congress has made changes in the program and the funding issue has been dealt with through tax increases, changes to benefits, increasing the retirement age, which ultimately is a change in benefits to some extent because it affects when you get them and how much you get at different ages. So, I think generally it is agreed that the options that lie before us as we move ahead to try to deal with the financing shortfall pretty much come down to three areas: to increase taxes, to adjust benefits, or to increase the rate of return that we get on the money going into the system. Mr. SHAW. In your comments you talked about many changes at Social Security, and they have been for the better. The one change that isn't for the better is the demographics, and the question is how many workers are paying into the system now for every retiree? Back in 1935 it was over 40 workers per retiree. The system worked very well. Life expectancy was less than 65. I think it was 62, and the benefits didn't really start until 65, so, the program was very, very solvent. There was no problem. The pay-as-you-go system was a good plan. Now, we are down though to three, a little over three workers per retiree, and we are headed, because of the fact we are living longer and having fewer kids, toward a situation where we are going to have two workers per retiree. That would simply mean in plain terms that if we are going to guarantee the benefits, that means two workers have to care for one beneficiary under Social Security. That is just too heavy a load, particularly for people that go from paycheck the paycheck. Also, the alternative of borrowing, we are looking at a $26 trillion cash shortfall. Now we can talk about it in terms of present dollars, but the actual cash shortfall over the next 75 years is $26 trillion. Our economy cannot sustain that. So, obviously, right now you would never devise a program today for Social Security that is identical to the one that we have currently. You would add something to it. You wouldn't provide for a program where the surpluses are going into the General Fund. You would retain them and invest them in something for the American workers. That is how I see the future of Social Security if we are going to care for the next generation and quit worrying about the next election. That is more important. Saving Social Security is much more important than anybody's reelection in this U.S. Congress. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman MCCRERY. Thank you, Mr. Shaw. Mr. Pomeroy. Mr. POMEROY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, I think we have heard a new one today, prefunding. This is an effort that has an ideological objective, privatizing Social Security. It is an objective in search of rationale. So, initially we heard you were not getting enough return on your Social Security, only now to have the President propose a lower return as they change from wage to price index. We heard that the system was in crisis, had to privatize Social Security, it was in crisis, until people looked at the thing being able to pay benefits as scheduled for the next 37 years, and figure we had a little time to work on this. So, that one didn't work. So, now it is prefund, we are going to prefund. Well, that all sounds fine and good too until you realize that prefund means dollars in an account, benefit guarantees reduced, benefit stability reduced. Commissioner, I find your testimony very interesting. I have at times previously extolled your administration of Social Security because I think you are doing a terrific job. Commissioner BARNHART. Thank you. Mr. POMEROY. We have not had a chance to talk about really the philosophical design, and I understand that is really not your core responsibility. You have got to make the trains run on time, get the checks out over there, make the system work. Is that correct? Commissioner BARNHART. That is correct. Mr. POMEROY. Do you view yourself as a premier architect or participant in the great Social Security privatization debate? Commissioner BARNHART. I view myself as a person making sure Social Security is a place where you, all the Members of this Subcommittee, all the Members of Congress, and the President and Members of the Administration can come to to get the facts about the program, to get the facts of the---- Mr. POMEROY. I think you have given us some important facts today. Two-thirds of those who receive a Social Security check, that is most of their income, 20 percent, it is all their income. I heard about a figure of something like one-third, it is 90 percent or better of their income. Would that be about right? Commissioner BARNHART. That is about right, yes, it is. Mr. POMEROY. What is the average Social Security check? Commissioner BARNHART. The average Social Security check right now is somewhere around $955 a month. Mr. POMEROY. In my State, as of last year, I believe you and I spoke about a check that averaged about $834 a month. Commissioner BARNHART. That is for an individual, and for a couple it is somewhere around $1,600, and it goes up, obviously, if you have a couple. Mr. POMEROY. For an individual, the $834, is that right? Commissioner BARNHART. I believe $834 is the disability payment, Mr. Pomeroy, the average disability payment. Mr. POMEROY. A year ago the disability payment was I think $700 and some. Commissioner BARNHART. For '04, the average benefit for a disabled worker is $894, a retired worker is $955. Mr. POMEROY. North Dakota or national? Commissioner BARNHART. That is national. North Dakota may be different, that is very possible. Mr. POMEROY. It is lower, based on the lower---- Commissioner BARNHART. Yes, that is very possible because of the lower earnings perhaps. Mr. POMEROY. --lower statistics. I am just looking at it from the perspective I have. Costs are higher in other places, which offset the higher check. Ms. BARNHART. Right. Mr. POMEROY. I think that if you have people--in fact, it is a high possibility that those depending on Social Security for all their check have a lower than average check because they would have had a lower than average earning history, reflecting their inability to save or have other retirement. That is why they are so dependent upon Social Security. So, as I think about the North Dakota check in the mid to low 800s, I am thinking, if you add volatility to this, with this thing bouncing around depending on where the stock market goes, or if you change the wage replacement value because you no longer have a wage index, you have a price index if you make over $20,000 a year, you definitely raise questions about whether a person will be able to live on that Social Security check. It is my view that volatility or benefit cuts off of the average check raise real questions about the ability of people to live independently, for that some significant portion, about one-third of all recipients, that depend on it for 90 percent or more of their check. Would you agree with that? Commissioner BARNHART. I understand what you are saying, and I think the point that you are making, as I am hearing it, is that Social Security is even more important for the most vulnerable people who are the people in the lowest quintile, or lowest one-third, of earners in the country, because they rely on it for a higher percentage if not all of their income and retirement, correct? Mr. POMEROY. Yes. Commissioner BARNHART. Yes. Mr. POMEROY. That check, if it is either subject to stock market volatility or reduced because you change the index and it no longer accrues at its wage index value, you raise real questions in terms--if that amount, which is averaging in the 800 to $900 range now, is essentially lower for a future generation because we change the formula now, it will be harder for people to live on that independently; is that correct? Commissioner BARNHART. I understand what you are saying, and let me say I agree, that is a view. Let me just add one thing, if I may, and not to be confrontational, but simply to say it in the interest of trying to explore these issues and look at them from all sides of the coin. One of the concerns that I have, as we move forward in discussing the solvency debate and the level of benefits and those kinds of things, is that we make sure that what we are measuring against, in terms of looking at the different ideas, is what the actual payable benefits are today and not the scheduled benefits. Because, as the Chairman pointed out, the payable benefit right now looks like--and as Mr. Levin discussed--is somewhere around 74 percent of what the scheduled benefit is. So, one of my concerns--and when I look at this whole notion of risk, Mr. Pomeroy, one of the things I think we need to take into consideration is that the program today, absent any changes, is not risk free because you can pretty much be guaranteed, based on what our actuaries say, that you are going to have a 26-percent reduction. Mr. POMEROY. I don't think anyone is suggesting we don't do anything, that we take--you talk yourself about how the program has been changed several times in history. Commissioner BARNHART. It has, right, it has. Mr. POMEROY. With 37 years out, we have time to change it. Chairman MCCRERY. Thank the gentleman. Mr. POMEROY. I yield back. [Laughter.] Chairman MCCRERY. Thank you very much, very generous. In fact, we hope to be talking about some ways to avert the 26- percent-cut in benefits, and in fact we have actually proposed concrete things to do that. We are still waiting for you all to do that. Maybe you have something better than prefunding. We would love to hear it. Mr. Hayworth? Mr. HAYWORTH. I thank the Chairman. I listened with interest to the testimony of the Commissioner and the evaluation offered by the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, and most recently by my friend from North Dakota. Mr. Chairman, my colleagues, I must say that I am, well, not completely astonished because we know that politics and policy are intermingled, but to hear such disparaging of even the exploration of prefunding, especially--and not to case personal aspersions, but knowing that my good friend from North Dakota, the former insurance commissioner, knowing that indeed this entire system was proposed by President Franklin Roosevelt, not only as old-age pensions, but a form of social insurance, if you will, knowing that a dynamic of insurance is prefunding in the real world, knowing that payroll taxes, although we have devolved into a pay-as-you-go system, knowing that in 1935 when you had 40 plus workers for every retiree, one of the basic perceptions of the program is, in fact, prefunding. I was a little curious to hear such venom utilized for the term, but that of course, is politics. We have to work on policy. My friend from Michigan said, as if it was a terrible, evil, devious plan, this observation from a Member of the Administration, quote, ``Details would need to be worked out through the legislative process,'' close quote. My colleagues, that is what we are engaged in, the legislative process to determine what is the best course of action. Good people can disagree, but to suggest that somehow a legitimate observation that, quite frankly, I believe all of us learned in civics class, that the legislative process comes up with an ultimate product that the President can either sign into law or veto, to somehow suggest that that is an assault on survivor's benefits or to at least leave that impression, is disingenuous at best. Again, just for the record, because from time to time there tends to be smoke and mirrors rather than straight chronicling of what in fact has been said, our President has laid out goals for Congress in developing legislation to strengthen this program. Any attempt to quantify the financial effects reflects the views and assumptions of authors and commentators, not those of the President. In the final analysis, it will be this Committee and this Congress that must work together to save and strengthen Social Security. So, enough of the politics. Let us get again to the policy itself. Madam Commissioner, in your testimony you discussed the changes enacted in 1983 to achieve solvency over 75 years. Those changes enacted included raising the retirement age, taxing Social Security benefits, and some other modifications. By design it achieved solvency by building up the Social Security Trust Funds with full knowledge that the program would start running deficits much sooner. In the end, the amendments 1983 simply kicked the can down the road rather than providing a lasting--and by that, in Washington parlance-- three-quarters of a century solution. Would you agree that a durable solution must do more than buildup bigger balances of Treasury IOUs in the trust fund; it must bring Social Security's income and costs in line with each other in the long run? Commissioner BARNHART. I do think you make a really important point about this whole notion of how we look at solvency, and traditionally it has been looked at over a 75- year time period, and the Social Security Commission, I think it was in 1983, the Greenspan Commission, they defined sustainable solvency the way I did in my testimony, which was at the end of the 75-year period you have a situation where the trust funds are stable or rising. I think as we look ahead to the younger generations of Americans aging, we need to keep in mind, in my view, that we owe it to them to try to fix it permanently, to make sure that we are not, as you say, kicking the can down the road every so many years or every so many decades, and having to make adjustments to fix it. One of the reasons I think that is so important is because the younger people in this country. If you talk to them--and I have a 16 and a half year--old, and his friends are over at the house all the time--and I talk to my friends, in their 20s who are just starting to work, and they really have lost confidence in the system. I think it is critically important that we restore confidence in the system. I was reading a long article in one of the national news magazines just the other day, and it was pointing out how Social Security had been important to generations of families over a lifetime, but the most recent generation, the newest generation, the 20-somethings that are working in department stores now, are basically saying, I don't have any faith at all that it will be there when I retire. I think that is the issue that we want to address through sustainable solvency. Mr. HAYWORTH. Thank you, Commissioner Barnhart. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman MCCRERY. Thank you, Mr. Hayworth. Mr. Becerra? Mr. BECERRA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Commissioner, always good to see you. Thank you very much for trying to answer the questions. Obviously, sometimes it is difficult because this is an issue that is important to everyone. We don't yet have all the concrete details of any particular plan out there to really work off of, so, I know that sometimes when we ask you questions, we are asking you to project. Commissioner BARNHART. I understand. Mr. BECERRA. So, thank you for every attempt that you make to try to answer as best you can. I would like to go back for a second and ask about the trust fund. As the Commissioner it is your responsibility to safeguard the Social Security system which includes the trust fund. Commissioner BARNHART. Right. Mr. BECERRA. Let me just ask you straight out: does the trust fund exist? Commissioner BARNHART. In my view, the trust fund absolutely does exist, because as required by law, when the payroll taxes come in every month, what we don't use to pay benefits in a given month is posted to the trust funds, credited, and then used to purchase government securities. That is required by law. We don't have an option but to do that. Mr. BECERRA. So, we have Treasury certificates that are banked away that reflect the amount of money that is in that trust fund? Commissioner BARNHART. In fact, in the past we have had to cash in those bonds on a number of occasions, and the government has made good. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the government, and that has always been the case. In fact, my understanding is the U.S. Government is one of a few Nations that has never defaulted. Mr. BECERRA. Excellent. That was my impression. So, then what are we to make of President Bush's visit to the place where you held so many of these Treasury certificates? Was it grandstanding to say it is just Monopoly money, or should Americans believe that in fact in 20 years when those trust fund dollars are being redeemed, that they can count on that money being there? Commissioner BARNHART. I think my recollection was that the President referred to them as IOUs, as---- Mr. BECERRA. I said Monopoly money, he said IOUs. Commissioner BARNHART. That is what I remember. [Laughter.] Commissioner BARNHART. I can't remember everything everybody says, but I remember that one. Mr. BECERRA. He did try to leave the impression that these are IOUs that may not be paid? Commissioner BARNHART. I think that---- Mr. BECERRA. Did that not concern you as the Commissioner of Social Security? Commissioner BARNHART. Well, he did call them IOUs. I remember that. Mr. BECERRA. So, is it your sense that that means that he, like every other American who puts money through Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes into the Social Security system and the trust fund, believes that they will be paid? Commissioner BARNHART. I assumed the point that he was trying to make was that in order to pay those bonds when they come due, that it is going to have to be taken out of other parts of the Federal budget. Mr. BECERRA. In other words, we are taking money from the trust fund, using it for other purposes, but at the end, in the future, when we have a call on those securities, those Treasury certificates, the government will have to pay, but just has to find other sources to pay for that? Commissioner BARNHART. In essence we are paying ourselves, yes, right. Mr. BECERRA. So, today, this day, May 17th, the Administration is going to use $400 million in Social Security Trust Fund dollars and spend them on things that have nothing to do with Social Security. At the end of the year, when you total up the year, it will total up to what, about $170 billion in those trust fund dollars, Social Security Trust Fund dollars that the President will have spent on things other than Social Security. If there is some chance that these so-called IOUs will not be paid, wouldn't it be incumbent upon the President to today stop spending at the rate of $400 million a day those Social Security Trust Fund dollars that he is using for non- Social Security purposes? Commissioner BARNHART. Well, again, not to be confrontational, Mr. Becerra, but I do feel compelled to point out that the funds get spent also by the Congress and by programs that--the budget gets approved by the Congress. The appropriation comes from Congress. Mr. BECERRA. Very good point. Commissioner BARNHART. So, I would like to make that point. Let me say, I think that is an important point to make, because there is nothing strange about that. That is the way the system has always worked. It is an issue that comes up all the time when I am interviewed, when I am doing call-in radio shows with people across America. They talk about the fact that Congress and the President are misusing the Social Security money---- Mr. BECERRA. Raiding the trust funds. Commissioner BARNHART. Right, raiding trust funds, and in fact, that was the way the system was designed, and I explain that. Mr. BECERRA. So, one of the things that we all should do is if we are talking about Social Security in trouble, there is a crisis, one of the first things we stop doing is spending Social Security moneys on non Social Security purposes, because the day of reckoning will come when we will need those trust fund dollars, and whether we have the trust fund moneys available or not, we are not going to shortchange Social Security recipients when they retire. So, I think to have an honest debate, you have to be honest in saying that today the Administration is spending $400 million a day in Social Security dollars on non Social Security purposes. Let me ask you this. As the President talks about privatizing Social Security, we just heard recently, last week, that United Airlines has decided that it cannot pay on its pension benefits for its employees to the tune of some $10 billion that now, guess who, the taxpayers will be responsible for, and at the same time those United pensioners in the future will only get some pennies on their dollars. Who knows how much they are going to get. That was because those private pension dollars, those personal accounts that those United employees had in United pension plans, 401(k)s, are no longer there because United gambled with that money. Whether it is United--and we hear that Delta Airlines may be right around the corner, and Northwest Airlines may be around the corner, or we could talk about Enron, which did the same thing to its employees, thousands of employees with these 401(k) plans, or we can talk about the city of San Diego, my State of California, which is on the verge--and Mr. Chairman, I will close with this comment--is on the verge of declaring bankruptcy because it too fiddled with its government employee moneys in these pension 401(k) accounts. Why would you--I don't want to say you--why would anyone want to put our guaranteed Social Security moneys in a plan that could be a gamble, and wouldn't a Commissioner be out there saying, ``Don't you dare touch those moneys that are guaranteed, and have been guaranteed for 70 years?'' Commissioner BARNHART. Well, I think, one of the points that is important to make is that there would be a lot to be worked out in legislation as we move forward, and I think that is one of the reasons when people have talked about personal accounts, they have used the Thrift Savings Plan as an example, because there are certain safeguards built into that. I think, obviously- Mr. BECERRA. Talk to the San Diego employees who today are not guaranteed their benefits. Chairman MCCRERY. The gentleman's time has expired. Commissioner BARNHART. I think the situation you describe obviously didn't have the kind of safeguards that people would, obviously, be interested in having. Chairman MCCRERY. However, on my time, I would like to ask Mr. Becerra a question. Mr. BECERRA. Yes, sir. Chairman MCCRERY. You made the point that we should stop spending those surpluses, and you used a figure that was incorrect. In this year, the cash surplus that is available for us to spend, is about $69 billion. You said we ought to stop spending that. If we were to stop spending that, what would you do with it? Mr. BECERRA. You could pay down the interest on the national debt or the principal on the national debt, which would reduce our payments into the future. You could---- Chairman MCCRERY. How would it reduce our payments into the future? Mr. BECERRA. Well, today we are paying, what is it, over $150 billion in interest simply on the national debt. If you reduce the principal that we owe, that reduces the amount of interest that you have to pay on the Nation's debt, which cumulatively will add up to billions and billions of dollars into the future. Actually, what I am proposing is nothing different from what President Bush first proposed when he came into office when he said he wouldn't have to touch Social Security when he enacted his tax cuts, but instead we find because of the deficits and so forth that he has had to, in essence, use all of the Social Security surplus to pay for the tax cuts. Chairman MCCRERY. So, you are saying we could pay down debt and that would save us interest, wouldn't it? We wouldn't have to pay that interest. Mr. BECERRA. It would. Chairman MCCRERY. The same thing would apply to the trust fund, wouldn't it? If we don't have to pay that interest inside the trust fund it would be easier to make good on those obligations. Mr. BECERRA. Well, the beauty of the Social Security system is that today the system runs a massive surplus so that the reason we have this surplus is because we are collecting more today than we need to pay out, so, there is a pot, a treasure pot that every worker in America is paying today into Social Security, that he and she believes will be there in the future for them. If we were smart, we would use that money wisely to try to reduce our obligations into the future so that way, we have the opportunity and the ability to pay those same American workers who contributed money today come time when they retire. So, Mr. Chairman, I think---- Chairman MCCRERY. I agree with you. President Clinton, in fact, suggested that we save that money, not spend it, and invest it in the stock market, direct government investment, didn't he? Mr. BECERRA. Well, that was part of his proposal to try to shore up Social Security into the long term, right. Chairman MCCRERY. Right. So, that is another thing you could do if we didn't spend it, we could invest in the stock market and try to get interest, compound interest, working for the trust fund instead of against the trust fund, which it is now doing. Mr. BECERRA. Right. The peculiar feature about President Clinton's proposal, which makes it a safeguard, is that rather than let 47 million Americans try to invest that money wisely, you would have one entity, so that when there are good days and you make a good investment, everyone benefits, and when there are bad days, everyone shares the loss, versus having 48 million Americans each trying to figure out if they had a good day or a bad day. Chairman MCCRERY. That is a debatable proposition, and it is one debate that we would love to have. Mr. Hulshof? Mr. HULSHOF. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Am I correct, to my friend from California, that you joined this August body in 1993 after a '92 election? Is it not a fact that in 1993 and in 1994 and in 1995 and '96 and '97, while the gentleman was in the majority during those years, that---- Mr. BECERRA. You have given me about three or 4 years of extra majority that I would have loved to have had. [Laughter.] Mr. HULSHOF. The point is that Congress, during those initial years that the gentleman joined this body, Social Security was borrowed from, was it not; the excess payroll taxes were spent on other government programs, isn't that a fact? Mr. BECERRA. The gentlemen is correct, that in those years President Clinton inherited what was then the largest budget deficit in the history of this Nation, of about $230 billion, and in order to come up with the money, President Clinton did use the Social Security moneys, and Congress allowed him to use those Social Security moneys. When President Bush took office, he came in with the largest budget surpluses in the Nation's history, and he still is using the Social Security surplus moneys as well. That is the difference. Mr. HULSHOF. Commissioner Barnhart, let me confirm this. I think it is in your testimony. The actual disability portion of Social Security, disability, cash benefits were authorized under the amendments 1956, is that true, and the actual cash program began in 1957? Commissioner BARNHART. That is correct, yes. Mr. HULSHOF. The Ranking Member, in his opening statement, made a point--and I am trying to determine the relevance of the point--that at the time the disability insurance program was created, that all 10 Members, Republican Members, voted against the disability insurance program. I have done a quick survey here, Mr. Levin. Not one Member on the Republican side presently serving on the Committee was here in Congress then. Is the gentleman suggesting that somehow those of us on this side of the aisle, as it relates to the disability portion of Social Security, that somehow we don't believe that it should be held in high esteem? Is that the point? The Ranking Member's statement, I am trying to determine the relevance of bringing up the fact that prior Congresses or other parties--would the gentleman wish me to talk about the civil rights debate of the '60s and the prominent Democrats that attempted to filibuster? What is the relevance of what happened in 1957 as it relates to the challenges that we are here to address with Commissioner Barnhart? Mr. LEVIN. Will you yield? Mr. HULSHOF. I will yield, yes, sir. Mr. LEVIN. First of all--and I urge that you go back and look at the history not only in the '50s, the '60s, and that is, the voting records are clear when it came to creation of disability and to other improvements in Social Security after that. Mr. HULSHOF. Let me---- Mr. LEVIN. Let me just finish. Mr. HULSHOF. Okay. Mr. LEVIN. The Democrats overwhelmingly favored, and Republicans in the majority disapproved of those improvements, number one. Number two, we have never proposed to diverting Social Security moneys into private accounts which could well have the impact of affecting disability payments, because if you look--what happens if you have private accounts---- Mr. HULSHOF. Well, I am going to reclaim my time, Mr. Levin. You have had your time and you have made your point. Mr. LEVIN. I surely have made my point. Mr. HULSHOF. The point is--I would say to the gentleman, and, Mr. Chairman, my disappointment runs deeply because when I was first allowed to serve on this Committee under then Chairman Jim Bunning, then under the gentleman from Florida, and had the opportunity to work with Ranking Members Coyne and Canelli and Matsui, as far as the disability program was concerned--and this Member particularly, as it relates to the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act (P.L. 106- 170), where we expanded, Republicans led the effort to expand the disability program, to remove obstacles in the workforce so that people with disabilities can continue, as far as vocational rehabilitation services, as far as maintaining Medicaid or Medicare, health care services. So, again, the point is, here we are today, and you are watching this tennis match, Commissioner, and that is unfortunate because the challenges are real. I would say to my good friend from North ``by gosh'' Dakota, the gentleman shared a stage with me in 1998 in Kansas City, Missouri, and the word ``crisis,'' the first time I recall a prominent occupant of the Oval Office mentioning the word or using the word ``crisis'' as it relates to the demographic challenges of Social Security was when the gentleman and I, along with Senator Santorum and then Senator Bob Kerrey and President Bill Clinton, in the first ever great debate when he announced that there was a crisis facing Social Security, which again I thought was very useful at least to--and we are having the same discussions today as we did in 1998 about the demographic challenges. So, I would, again, Mr. Chairman, I would take the tact that you have taken, and I tip my hat to the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Wexler, and while I am not necessarily in support of his idea, at least now there is an idea on the table about addressing these shortfalls, and I am disappointed that, as the gentleman from Arizona has said, sometimes I think the politics overruns the policy. Thanks for the time. Chairman MCCRERY. Thank you, Mr. Hulshof. Ms. Tubbs Jones? Ms. TUBBS JONES. Good afternoon. How are you? Commissioner BARNHART. Good afternoon, thank you. Fine. Ms. TUBBS JONES. It is so interesting that it is politics when you are talking about the other party and it is policy when you are talking about your own, but we all are political. That is why we've got political parties operating here on the Hill. I am just so pleased to have you back, Commissioner Barnhart. Let us talk about women for a moment since we are so well represented on this Committee. [Laughter.] Chairman MCCRERY. I will second that. Ms. TUBBS JONES. Oh, thank you very much. We are agreeing on something. The fact is that in its inception, Social Security was intended to kind of help out--not in its inception, as it moved along--the woman who was working in the home, not working outside the home, and the payments for that work, was actually through the spouse's earnings. Then as time moved along, some considerations were given to working women. A lot of women to this day say that sometimes their benefit might have been better under their own ticket than under their spouse's ticket, and are--I don't want to say anger--but disappointed that they are not receiving the bigger dollar. Commissioner BARNHART. I think the issue you are pointing out is a really important one, but I believe--just to clarify, if I may. Ms. TUBBS JONES. Please. Commissioner BARNHART. The situation you are describing is that typically with a lower-earning spouse, and generally it is the wife, because women make less than men generally, the couple is entitled to, in the case of a one-earner couple, the male's Social Security and then half as much for the spouse. What happens if you have a two-earner couple, because again, women's salaries are often lower than men, is that even though Social Security is gender neutral and we do calculate the same benefit for a woman as for a man, often her benefit in her own right ends up being less than 50 percent of the higher-earning spouse's benefit. So, therefore, the woman feels like hers didn't really count. Ms. TUBBS JONES. Right. The other thing that we don't have a lot of discussion about, but the fact is that a non-working spouse at a younger age, under a disability or survivor program, is likely to get a greater benefit under the program should her spouse become--with minor children, should her spouse become disabled or die. Commissioner BARNHART. That is because of the total family benefit, you are absolutely correct, when you add up all the-- -- Ms. TUBBS JONES. Right. For many low-income families, the ability to purchase that type of insurance, they don't have the ability to purchase the kind of insurance that Social Security provides either under disability or survivor. Commissioner BARNHART. That is why I think it is important for people to remember that Social Security is not just about retirement. It is disability. It is survivors, and in fact, a little known fact that most people don't focus on, one in three of our people who are receiving benefits are not retirees. Ms. TUBBS JONES. The fact is that the debate about whether or not African-Americans should be--there should be some discussion about increasing the benefit for African-Americans as they retire, really does not take into consideration-- because they die early, does not take in consideration the benefits that they receive under either a disability or survivor program, or their families receive. Commissioner BARNHART. Well, I think it depends on how you look at it, quite frankly--one can say that if you take someone who is in a similar situation but who happened to live 10 or 15 years longer than the particular African American you are talking about, they would have reaped more benefits from the system than the individual you describe by moving on to receive more retirement benefits. Ms. TUBBS JONES. The fact is that an African American family, low-income African American family could not purchase the disability or survivor benefits with dollars that they receive under Social Security. Commissioner BARNHART. I think it would be difficult for anyone to do that, frankly. Ms. TUBBS JONES. Right. What is--let me strike that question and go back. I kind of lost my thought for a moment there. As we move along down this path of discussion of Social Security, it is your position that we should strengthen Social Security. Is that correct? Commissioner BARNHART. I believe we should strengthen Social Security for future generations, make sure that it is there and there is sustainable solvency for the future. Ms. TUBBS JONES. Well, the commercial I like most is where the plumber comes into the lady's house and he says I'm there to fix the sink. Commissioner BARNHART. I have seen it. Ms. TUBBS JONES. He says I have to tear down the house, and the response is, Don't do Social Security like that. If you only need to fix the sink, don't tear down the house to do it. Would you agree with that? Commissioner BARNHART. Well, I have seen that commercial, so, I---- Ms. TUBBS JONES. It is kind of funny, isn't it? Commissioner BARNHART. I know the one that you are talking about. I don't know, those commercials strike a little close to home for me, so, I can't seem to laugh when I see them, particularly with my husband and son sitting there watching them sometimes, and saying, ``Mom, what are you going to do about that?'' So, let me say that I understand the point that you are making. I guess I would say this: I do think that as we consider changes and as we help you consider the changes and what you are going to do as we move forward, hopefully, together and in a bipartisan fashion, I think it is important to make sure that what we are creating and ensuring is a program that is going to be safe and secure in the future. Ms. TUBBS JONES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman MCCRERY. Thank you, Ms. Tubbs Jones. Mr. Lewis? Mr. LEWIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have seen that commercial, by the way, and I remember reading some scripture that says if you build your house on the sand, when the wind and rain and the storms come, that house will be blown away. You build it on a rock, and it will stand. I think the foundation at Social Security---- Ms. TUBBS JONES. God is not going to let us legislate that in Congress. Mr. LEWIS. Excuse me. I think it is my time. If you look at what Social Security has been built on, the demographics just don't work. When you had 40 people paying in to Social Security and one person on retirement, that was wonderful. Now we are down to three and eventually down to two. So, I think we have built it on the sand. It has been a great program. I have an 88-year-old father that depends on Social Security. I also have a daughter and a son that 1 day will have to depend on Social Security, maybe. I keep hearing the full faith and credit of the United States Government and that they will--the full faith and credit of the United States Government will stand behind the Social Security system and will pay the IOUs. Well, IOUs aren't a lot of comfort for my kids. Just saying that the full faith and credit of the United States Government is going to make sure that it is going to be there, when they know and I know that the government will be them, the taxpayer, future generations. My grandkids will have to pay for my children's retirement, their Social Security. So, isn't it correct that the government, the full faith and credit of the government will be the future generation that will have to pay for the Social Security on a pay-as-you-go system? Commissioner BARNHART. That is true. I think that there is an important point that may be getting lost, or maybe not-- maybe it is just being lost for me. That is, when we look at where the trust fund balances are now, they are at about $1.7 trillion. Our actuaries project that if you look at it over the 75-year period, even assuming that the trust fund money is all there and piled on this table today or in a bank and earning interest--and it is earning interest, in fact, in the bonds--we still need an additional $4 trillion today in the bank and earning interest. One of the great misconceptions that exists, and I say this from, again, my public appearances and taking calls from average Americans across the country and going out and talking to them, is that somehow the trust funds alone are enough to do the trick. They simply are not. That is a point that can't be lost in all of this, that it is not a question of only full faith and credit backing the $1.7 trillion in the trust fund, it is that it is over 75 years there is a $4 trillion shortfall, and using the infinite horizon measure, it goes up to $11 trillion. Mr. LEWIS. Yes, we just had testimony a few weeks ago from David Walker, the Controller General of the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), and when you look at our overall unfunded liabilities and debt facing the country, our kids and grandkids have a tremendous burden to face if we don't start trying to solve some of these problems now. Social Security is one that we must start to tackle now. As you just mentioned, it is going to add up to trillions and trillions of dollars that we just can't stick in the sand and play politics and, as Clay Shaw said a little while ago, we cannot afford to play politics with this. We have to bring every idea to the table that we can possibly bring, and try to solve it now. The Wizard of Oz isn't going to be out there cranking out dollars to take care of these problems sometime in the near future. David Walker said that by the year 2041, that the money coming into the Federal treasury will only be enough to take care of the interest on the debt. There goes all the entitlements. So, it is time we all get real about these real, real serious problems. Thank you. Chairman MCCRERY. Thank you, Mr. Lewis. Mr. Neal? Mr. NEAL. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. One of the points I just want to touch upon that Mr. Lewis raised about his children and IOUs in the future. If he had minor children and something happened to him today, there is no doubt as to how the Social Security Trust Fund would react, right? Commissioner BARNHART. It would pay survivors' benefits. Mr. NEAL. It would pay survivors' benefits. Incidentally, Commissioner, I know something about survivor benefits and so do my sisters. Very important consideration. I heard a few minutes ago, with astonishment, one of the Members of this Committee say that it was unfair to bring up the history of this program or to bring up the history of actions by Members of Congress. There isn't a Member of this Subcommittee who has not used the words, actions or votes of their opponents during campaigns to make a point about why they should be elected to replace that person. Here is the nub of the problem, Commissioner. When I came to Congress 17 years ago, the Minority Leader, or the Republican leader in the Senate and the Republican leader in the House had both voted against the establishment of Medicare. Recall that Roosevelt's in"
