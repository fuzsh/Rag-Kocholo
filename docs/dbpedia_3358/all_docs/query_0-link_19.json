        "text": "J.D. Hayworth John D. \"J.D.\" Hayworth Jr. (born July 12, 1958) is an American politician who has been a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives since 1995, representing the 5th District of Arizona (map). He was born in High Point, North Carolina, was educated at North Carolina State University, and was a television and radio journalist before entering the House. Before running for office, he was familiar to Phoenix-area residents as the sports anchor of KSAZ-TV's news report from 1987 until 1994. Before that he worked for WFBC-TV (now WYFF-TV), the NBC station in Greenville, SC from 1981 to 1986 as a sportscaster.\n\nHayworth had considered a candidacy for governor of Arizona in the 2006 elections, but in March 2005, announced that he preferred to stay in Congress.\n\nHayworth is generally known as one of the most conservative members of congress. He does not support President Bush's Guest-Worker Amnesty for Mexican immigrants. Despite this, the 5th District, centered mainly in Democratic-leaning Tempe and the northeastern suburbs of Phoenix are quite moderate, although leaning Republican. John Kerry won 45f the vote in Hayworth's district, three percent more than Al Gore won in the 6th district represented by Hayworth before redistricting."
