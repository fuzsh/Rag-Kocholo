        "text": "In a new web video, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) paints his primary challenger J.D. Hayworth as a birth-certificate-searching, horse-marriage-fearing, Dracula-believing whackadoo.\n\nHayworth, a former congressman, is mounting a challenge from the right and attacking McCain as overly moderate. Although Hayworth is still lagging in the polls, he could give McCain a serious run for his money.\n\nThe video, using clips from the Lion King and Mars Attacks, says Hayworth considers the “most pressing challenges” to be President Obama’s birthplace, interspecies marriage and whether Dracula is real. Also, martians.\n\nWatch:\n\nThe Dracula thing, if you’re wondering, is a reference to Hayworth’s reaction when the former Arizona attorney general said, “Someone needs to drive a wooden stake through this guy’s heart.”\n\nHayworth responded humorlessly: “This cavalier death threat that he issued is over the top.”\n\nWhatever you think of McCain, the spot is surely a challenge to Carly Fiorina’s Demon Sheep for web video of the year."
