He was best known for starring in the television series Topper (1953–1955).[1]\n\nIn 1960, Sterling was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the television industry.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nSterling was born William Sterling Hart in New Castle, Pennsylvania, 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Pittsburgh.
