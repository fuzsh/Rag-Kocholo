        "text": "Anne Jeffreys, the sophisticated blond actress and singer who played a glamorous ghost in the 1950s television series “Topper,” died on Wednesday at her home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. She was 94.\n\nHer death was confirmed by her son Jeff Sterling.\n\n“Topper,” seen on CBS from 1953 to 1955, was based on the 1937 film of the same name starring Cary Grant and Constance Bennett as a young couple, George and Marion Kerby, who die in an accident and come back to haunt their old house, now occupied by a stodgy banker, just for fun.\n\nMs. Jeffreys starred opposite her dapper real-life husband, Robert Sterling. The banker, Cosmo Topper (played in the movie and its sequels by Roland Young), was played by Leo G. Carroll.\n\nMs. Jeffreys’s television fame was preceded by a few busy years of moviemaking. She was in the musicals “I Married an Angel” (1942), with Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, and “Step Lively” (1944), with Frank Sinatra. She played the virtuous Tess Trueheart in “Dick Tracy” (1945) and its 1946 sequel; the lady in red who led a criminal to his death in “Dillinger” (1945); and the newcomer Robert Mitchum’s girlfriend in “Nevada” (1944).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
