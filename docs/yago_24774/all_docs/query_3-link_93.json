        "text": "The most recent issue of the Fairy Investigation Society newsletter (issue 17) included an article by Morgan Daimler on faery/ human marriages. She takes a broad approach in her discussion, considering examples from Ireland, Denmark, Germany and France as well as Britain. As regular visitors to the blog will know, I tend to be a bit more chauvinistic here on the British Fairies pages, and the piece set me thinking about the uniquely British aspects of the subject.\n\nIn recalling the cases of marriage I had read about, what immediately struck me was how they tended to be distributed to the west and north of Britain, with very few in the south-east- in other words in England. The story of Wild Edric comes from Shropshire- that is, the north-west Midlands- but the most of the recorded stories relate to over the border, in Wales, or much further north in the Highlands and the northern isles. I’m not sure what this tells us about the attractiveness of English males to fairy women; probably it’s not wholly flattering.\n\nCornwall is another blank, largely, which may be surprising in that the prevalence of Welsh and Highland cases might incline us to speculate that faery marriage is a feature of ‘Celtic’ regions. The Cornish stories of Cherry of Zennor, Jenny Permuen and of the ‘Fairy Master’ all have undertones of sex and marriage; all three human females are nubile girls who are employed by older widowers to act as carers for their orphaned children. The happily-ever-after outcome you might anticipate in a typical fairy tale is that she marries her employer and starts a new family with him. This doesn’t happen in the Cornish examples though. Love is also in the air in the Cornish tale of Ann Jefferies, but the affection one faery shows for her ends up causing dissension, for which she’s blamed and is ejected from faeryland. Cornish girls seem to have major problems settling down with supernatural suitors.\n\nPondering this, another thought struck me. In Wales (and, predominantly, in North Wales- Sir Caernarfon and Lleyn) the bulk of the ‘faery marriage’ cases concern the so-called gwragedd annwn, generally called ‘lake maidens’ in English and widely accepted as being faeries. In fact, the name more literally might be translated as ‘hell women’ or ‘underworld wives,’ and their exact status is somewhat anomalous when compared to the tylwyth teg proper. In origin and in nature the gwragedd might better be considered alongside some of the lake spirits and fae women of Arthurian myth- the Lady of the Lake and Morgan le Fay. In the case of the latter, of course, the ‘fay’ element of her name denotes magical powers rather than faery nature.\n\nThe singular of the Welsh word, gwraig, means woman or wife. Closely related is another word, gwrach, which has the sense of hag, crone or witch. In Cornish, gwrah is more simply just ‘witch’- as in the west Penwith place-name Crows an Wra, the witch’s cross. The little settlement itself, on the main road to the grimness that is the Land’s End visitor centre, is almost entirely devoid of magical or mysterious qualities, but it sits in an ancient and ritual landscape. Just to the north-west is the hill of Carn Brea, topped by two burial chambers; to the north is Bartinney, with its cairns and Bartine hillfort; to the north-east is Carn Euny ancient settlement and holy well; to the east Boscawen-Un stone circle. A little further north is the setting for William Bottrell’s story of Uter Bosence and the Piskey, in which a man was piskey led and ended up being terrorised by a gang of spriggans led by a pixie goat. The pobel vean have been sighted dancing at nearby Sennen and Trevescan. My point here is that the ‘witch’ of the hamlet of Crows inhabited a hallowed environment which was separated from the supernatural world by the thinnest of veils. Her witchiness may have been as much a matter of her contacts and associations as anything innate. This may indicate some of the connotations of the Welsh gwraig as well.\n\nAnyway, returning to North Wales, several families were reported by Professor John Rhys to trace their descent from one of the lake women- amongst them the Pellings of the area around Llanberis and Caernarfon and the Symachaid of Llyn Corwrion. One of the offspring of the former, William Williams of Llandegai, claimed ancestry from a woman called Penelope and declared “The best blood in my own veins is this fairy’s.” Penelope’s name was given to her children, who in time came to be called the ‘Pellings,’ but one suspects some sort of educated intrusion into this story, as her name is Greek, the most famous bearers being Odysseus’ wife and a dryad of Mount Kyllene in Arcadia, mother of Pan by Hermes. William Williams may have called her a fairy, but this lass (and all of her kind) were no ordinary representatives of the tylwyth teg. It may be for this reason that one folklorist who examined these ‘fairy brides’ called the Welsh accounts a “unique sub-group” of this class of story of human-fae marriage and talked advisedly about the gwragedd as ‘human’ and as ‘supernatural women’ (Juliette Wood, ‘The Fairy Bride Legend in Wales,’ in Folklore, vol.103, 1992, 58, 60 & 66).\n\nWe could say much the same about the exceptionalism of many other human marriages with supernatural partners. In Wales, and even more so in Scotland, Orkney and Shetland, relationships are recorded with merfolk and with selkies. I have written about these in some detail in my book, Beyond Faery, but- as the title implies- they aren’t strictly faeries either. If these cases are subtracted from the total number of British examples, you’re actually left with quite a reduced roster of life partnerships between humans and members of the sith, tylwyth teg and faeries. A good example of such a union comes from North Wales:\n\n“At Dolgellau a faery woman bathed in a pool every summer night and most locals would avoid the spot out of respect for her privacy. A young man called Hugh Evans couldn’t resist spying on a naked faery girl and, when he did, was so taken with her that he asked her to marry him. She consented on condition that she should be allowed to go off on her own at night and that he should never interfere in this, nor ask her any questions. One night Hugh’s curiosity got the better of him (yet again) and he tried to follow her out of their bedroom window, but he fell and broke his leg. She nursed him until he was well again- and then left him forever.”\n\nThis story epitomises some of the general features of human/faery marriage that Morgan Daimler notes in her article. The partnerships often involve a measure of coercion (from both sides) such as capture or abduction. Even in the more voluntary cases, as we might classify this one, persuasion to submit over a period of time might be required (remember the fussiness of the gwragedd annwn over the bread they’re offered by suitors?) and the human’s commitment might be tested with conditions, prohibitions and taboos. Violation of these apparently cannot be forgiven and the relationship has to be terminated. With the lake maidens, striking the fae wife, most particularly with iron, must be avoided. When- ultimately- this rule is breached, the spouse departs, taking with her all property she brought to the match (as Morgan also notes).\n\nThe dowry brought with her by the gwraig in so many of the Welsh accounts is a feature worth dwelling upon. She contributes material wealth (usually cattle, rarely money) and, hence, prosperity, to the marriage. She adds to this with offspring and with the skills that she transmits to them. When she departs, after the taboo that she has imposed has been broken, the husband and his farm cease to prosper. These brides very obviously have economic, and therefore, social power; this influence, notably, isn’t diminished by the fact that she’s coming into a unfamiliar world. The wife retains her autonomy and influence- which, I think, tells us something about faery society: that it is largely matriarchal and operates under the rule of a faery queen.\n\nAnother key feature- and a testament to the bonds of love and attachment that can develop- is the fact that one party normally has to cross the dimensions from Faery to middle earth, or vice versa. The Dolgellau faery tries to have the best of both worlds, it seems, with her nights spent (I presume) with her own kind. In the story of the mermaid of Zennor, though, her chosen partner, local boy Mathey Trewella, went to live with her under the sea. These arrangements rarely seem to work out well, though, as if the pull of home is stronger than any familial affection. The Orkney story of Johnny Croy describes how he managed to secure a mermaid wife by snatching her precious golden comb. To win it back, she struck a bargain with him- that she would live with him on his farm for seven years and that he would then go with her to visit her family under the sea. During the first part of their marriage, they had seven children. When the time came to go under the waves, Johnny’s mother branded her youngest grandchild on its buttock with a red-hot cross. This brutal measure prevented the mermaid taking her baby with her- but the rest of the family disappeared forever beneath the sea. A similar sort of story is told about the Caernarfonshire mermaid called Nefyn. She eventually consented to be a man’s wife after he had trapped her on dry land, but the match was plainly less than wholly voluntary, and she also had to surrender to her husband her magic swimming cap. The couple became well off and had ten sets of twins together, but it transpired that the reason for Nefyn’s self-sacrifice was to learn a song that she had heard her husband singing. Once she had acquired the tune, she returned to her merfolk family. Her husband went with her for a while, but eventually returned home, where their children had remained.\n\nOne way or another, most faery-human marriages seem to be starkly transactional- one side submits for reasons of material gain- and they also involve a degree of coercion that’s barely concealed by any subsequent ‘success’ arising from the match, in terms of children or prosperity.\n\nAnn Jeffries was the daughter of a poor labouring man, who lived in the parish of St Teath in North Cornwall, between Wadebridge and Tintagel. She was born in 1626, and is supposed to have died in 1698. The first written references to Ann appeared in March 1647, very soon after her faery experiences in 1645, and she was still alive in 1696 when Moses Pitt wrote about her (see later).\n\nOur main account of her life is found in Hunt’s Popular Romances of the West of England (pages 127-9) from which the following passages are adapted.\n\nWhen she was nineteen years old, Ann, who was said to be a remarkably sharp and clever girl, went to live as a servant with the Pitt family. She was said to have been unusually bold and would do things which even boys feared to attempt. In those days everyone in Cornwall believed in fairies (the little folk or pobel vean in Cornish) and everybody feared them. They were the constant subject of gossip and rumour and this talk particularly captured Ann’s imagination and set her longing anxiously to meet with some of them. As a result, she was often out and about after sunset, turning up the fern leaves and looking into the bells of the foxglove to find a fairy, singing all the time this charm:\n\n“Fairy fair and fairy bright;\n\nCome and be my chosen sprite.”\n\nEqually, she never allowed a moonlit night to pass without going down into the nearby valley and, walking beside the stream, she would sing another charm:\n\n“Moon shines bright, waters run clear,\n\nI am here, but where’s my fairy dear?”\n\nThe fairies spent a long time testing the poor girl; for, as they told her afterwards, they heard her perfectly well and never lost sight of her; but there they would be, looking on when she was seeking them, and they would run from frond to frond of the ferns, always just ahead of her when she was turning them up its her anxious search. [NB- ferns are closely associated with faeries and with invisibility.]\n\nOne day Ann, having finished her morning’s work, was sitting knitting in the arbour in her master’s garden, when she fancied she heard some one moving aside the branches, as though endeavouring to look in upon her; and she thought it must be her sweetheart, so she resolved to take no notice. Ann went on steadily with her work and no sound was heard but the regular clicking of her knitting-needles. Presently she heard a suppressed laugh, and then again a rustle amidst the branches. The back of the arbour was towards the lane, and to enter the garden it was necessary to walk down the lane to the gate, which was, however, not many yards off.\n\nAt last Ann began to feel vexed that the intruder did not show himself, and she said peevishly, half out loud —\n\n“You may stay there till the kueney (or cuney: moss, or mildew) grows on the gate, ere I’ll come to ‘ee.”\n\nThere was immediately peculiarly ringing and very musical laughter. Ann knew this wasn’t her lover’s laugh, and she felt afraid. Nonetheless, it was bright day, and she assured herself that no one would do her any mischief, as she knew herself to be a general favourite in the parish. Presently Ann felt sure that she’d heard the garden gate carefully opened and closed, so she waited anxiously. In a few moments she saw, standing at the entrance to the arbour, six little men, all clothed in green. They were beautiful little figures, and had very charming faces, and such bright eyes. The grandest of these visitors, who wore a red feather in his cap, advanced in front the others, and, making a most polite bow to Ann, addressed her familiarly in the kindest words. [Needless to observe, perhaps, the red and green clothes are very typical fairy garb.]\n\nThis gentleman looked so sweetly on Ann that she was charmed beyond measure, and she put down her hand as if shake hands with him, but instead he jumped into her palm and she lifted him into her lap. He then, without any more ado, he clambered upon her bosom and neck, and began kissing her. Ann never felt so delighted in her life as while this one little gentleman was playing with her; but presently he called his companion and they all clambered up by her dress as best they could, and kissed her neck, her lips, and her eyes. One of them ran his fingers over her eyes, and she felt as if they had been pricked with a pin. Suddenly Ann became blind, and she felt herself whirled through the air at a great rate. By and by, one of her little companions said something which sounded like “Tear away,” and Ann had her sight at once restored.\n\nAnn found that she was in one of the most beautiful places- temples and palaces of gold and silver; trees laden with fruits and flowers; lakes full of gold and silver fish and the air full of birds of the sweetest song, and the more brilliant colours. Hundreds of ladies and gentlemen were walking about; hundreds more were idling in the most luxurious bowers, the fragrance of the flowers oppressing them with sense of delicious repose. Hundreds were also dancing or engaged in games of various kinds. Ann was, however, surprised to find that these happy people were no longer the small people she’d previously seen. There was now no more than the difference usually seen in a crowd, between their height and her own. Ann found herself arrayed in the most highly-decorated clothes. So grand, indeed, did she appear, that she doubted her identity.\n\n[Ann’s fairyland is very similar to several others that I have described on the blog. The cottage and garden where Cherry of Zennor lives bears some similarities, but Ann’s palatial surroundings are much closer to some of the medieval descriptions I’ve discussed.]\n\nAnn was constantly attended by her six friends; but the finest gentleman, who had been the first to address her, continued her as her favourite, at which the others appeared to be very jealous. Eventually Ann and her favourite contrived to separate themselves, and they retired into some most lovely gardens, where they were hidden by the luxuriance of the flowers. They passed their time lovingly, and Ann wished this could continue forever. However, just when they were happiest, there was a great noise, and the five other fairies appeared at the head of a great crowd, all in a violent rage. Her lover drew his sword to defend her, but this was soon beaten down, and he lay wounded at her feet. Then the fairy who had blinded her again placed his hands upon her eyes, and all was dark. She heard strange noises, and felt herself whirled about and about, and as if a thousand flies were buzzing around her.\n\nAt length her eyes were opened, and Ann found herself on the ground in the arbour where she had been sitting in the morning, and many anxious faces were around her, all conceiving that she was recovering from a fit. As a result of her faery experience, Ann found that she was endowed with clairvoyance and healing powers. The first person she cured was her mistress, but her fame soon circulated within Cornwall and beyond.\n\nAnn had been given ointment by the fairies to cure “all distempers, sicknesses and sores” (such as the falling sickness and broken bones) and she was also granted the power to make herself invisible at will (perhaps the same ointment). When she was later arrested, it was alleged that these fairies were in fact her imps or familiars. She denied this, saying rather that they had quoted holy scripture to her. Ann never returned to Faery, but the Little Folk stayed near her, at least for the next few years.\n\nWe also have a first-hand account of some aspects of Ann’s story recounted by the son of the family for whom she worked as servant. This was published in the form of a letter from Moses Pitt to the Right Reverend Father in God, Dr. Edward Fowler, Lord Bishop of Gloucester:\n\nMOSES PITT’S LETTER RESPECTING ANNE JEFFERIES.\n\n“An account of Anne Jefferies, now living in the county of Cornwall, who was fed for six months by a small sort of airy people, called fairies; and of the strange and wonderful cures she performed with salves and medicines she received from them, for which she never took one penny of her patients.”\n\nAnne Jefferies, who was afterwards married to a farm labourer William Warren, was born in the parish of St Teath in December 1626, “and she is still living, 1696, being now in the 70th year of her age.” From the published narrative, we learn that Mr Humphrey Martin was asked by Moses Pitt to visit and examine Anne in 1693. Mr Martin writes, “As for Anne Jefferies, I have been with her the greater part of one day, and did read to her all that you wrote to me; but she would not own anything of it, as concerning the fairies, neither of any of the cures that she did. She answered, that if her own father were now alive, she would not discover to him those things which did happen then to her. I asked her the reason why she would not do it; she replied, that if she should discover it to you, that you would make books or ballads of it; and she said, that she would not have her name spread about the country in books or ballads of such things, if she might have five hundred pounds for it.” [As well as fear for her own reputation, you wonder if there was some fear of disclosing faery secrets as well.]\n\nMr Pitt’s correspondent went on to say that Anne was so frightened by the visitors she had in the arbour “that she fell into a kind of convulsion fit. But when they found her in this condition they took her into the house and put her to bed, and took great care of her. As soon as she recovered out of her fit, she cried out, ‘They are just gone out of the window- they are just gone out of the window. Do you not see them?'” Anne recovered, and “as soon as she recovered a little strength, she constantly went to church… She took mighty delight in devotion, and in hearing the Word of God read and preached, although she herself could not read.”\n\nAnn eventually told some portions of her story and cured numerous diseases amongst the people, by means of the powers she had derived from the fairy world. “People of all distempers, sicknesses, sores, and ages, came not only so far off as the Land’s End, but also from London, and were cured by her. She took no moneys of them, nor any reward that ever I knew or heard of, yet had she moneys at all times sufficient to supply her wants [This implies that she is receiving gifts of coins from the faeries]. She neither made nor bought any medicines or salves that ever I saw or heard of, yet wanted them not as she had occasion. She forsook eating our victuals, and was fed by these fairies from that harvest time to the next Christmas day; upon which day she came to our table and said, because it was that day, she would eat some roast beef with us, the which she did- I myself being then at the table.”\n\nThe fairies constantly attended upon Ann and they appear to have vied with each other to win her favour. They fed her, as we have been already told and the writer says that on one occasion site she “gave me a piece of her bread, which I did eat, and I think it was the most delicious bread that ever I did eat, either before or since.” Ann could render herself invisible, apparently at will. The fairies would come and dance with her in the orchard. She had a silver cup, given to her by the fairies, which she in turn gave to a local girl called Mary Martyn when she was about four years of age.\n\nAt last, “one John Tregeagle, Esq., who was steward to John Earl of Radnor, being a justice of peace in Cornwall, sent his warrant for Anne, and sent her to Bodmin jail, and there kept her a long time.” Her offence was, apparently, not so much her claims of faery acquaintance (although that was certainly enough to get you into trouble in those days- and, in Scotland, to get you burnt at the stake). More of a problem for Ann, however, was the fact that she was a staunch Church of England Royalist during the Civil War. As we have seen, she was very devout, but she insisted on High Church services, which didn’t go down well with the increasingly powerful Puritans. Possibly even worse than that was the fact that her prophecies for the future all foretold the victory of the King and the triumph of the bishops.\n\nThe fairies had previously given Ann a warning that she would be apprehended. When they did this, “she asked them if she should hide herself. They answered no; she should fear nothing, but go with the constable. So she went with the constable to the justice, and he sent her to Bodmin jail, and ordered the prison keeper that she should be kept without victuals, and she was so kept, and yet she lived, and that without complaining. But poor Ann lay in jail for a considerable time after; and also Justice Tregeagle, who was her great prosecutor, kept her in his house some time as a prisoner, and that without victuals.” Apparently, after a year or so in Bodmin’s jail, she was released to a sort of house arrest in the home of the Mayor of Bodmin. She held out, though, and eventually had to be released without charge, after which she took up a position with Moses Pitt’s widowed aunt in Padstow.\n\nIn the course of this account, we have a curious example of the fairies quoting Scripture; I’m not aware of another instance of this. On one occasion Ann, when seated with the family, was called three times. “Of all these three calls of the fairies, none heard them but Ann. After she had been in her chamber some time, she came to us again, with a Bible in her hand, and told us that when she came to the fairies, they said to her, ‘What ! has there been some magistrates and ministers with you, and dissuaded you from coming anymore to us, saying, we are evil spirits, and that it was all a delusion of the devil? Pray, desire them to read that place of Scripture, in the First Epistle of St. John, chap. iv. ver. I, ‘Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are of God;’ and this place of Scripture was turned down so in the said Bible. I told your lordship before, Anne could not read.”\n\nFinally:\n\n“And now, my lord, if your lordship expects that I should give you an account when, and upon what occasion, these fairies forsook our Anne, I must tell your lordship I am ignorant of that. She herself can best tell, if she would be prevailed upon to do so; and the history of it, and the rest of the passages of her life, would be very acceptable and useful to the most curious and inquisitive part of mankind.” (from An Historical Survey of the County of Cornwall, C. S. Gilbert 1817)."
