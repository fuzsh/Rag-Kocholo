[CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY KCET PUBLIC TELEVISION] Huell: WELL, HELLO, EVERYBODY.\n\nI'M HUELL HOWSER.\n\nGET READY FOR AN ADVENTURE.\n\nAND IF I HAD MORE TIME, I'D SET THIS WHOLE THING UP, BUT I'M RUNNING A FEW MINUTES FOR MY LUNCH DATE.\n\nSHE LIVES HERE IN BEVERLY HILLS.\n\nAND I GOT TO HER HOUSE, SHE GAVE ME GREAT DIRECTIONS, AND SHE WAS WAITING RIGHT OUT IN FRONT FOR ME TO PICK HER UP.\n\nANN, YOU GIVE GREAT DIRECTIONS.\n\n>> WELL, I HAVE TO.\n\nMY LITTLE STREET IS ONLY ONE BLOCK LONG.\n\nONE END OF IT BUTTONS INTO SUNSET, THE OTHER END COMES AROUND TO WHITTIER.\n\nBUT YOU MISS IT ON WHITTIER UNLESS YOU DO AS I SAID, AND YOU DID, STAY IN THE RIGHT-HAND LANE WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR LEFT TURN.\n\nHuell: BOY, DOES SHE GIVE GREAT DIRECTIONS.\n\nAND YOU ALSO SAID, LOOK FOR THE HOUSE--THE 2-STORY WHITE HOUSE WITH THE BLUE DOOR.\n\n>> THAT'S RIGHT.\n\nIT'S A HANDICAP BLUE COLOR.\n\nI DIDN'T REALIZE THAT UNTIL AFTER I'D CHOSEN IT.\n\nAND WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR WITH MY HANDICAP SIGN IN MY HAND, I THOUGHT, [GASPS], I'VE SEEN THAT-- Huell: IT MATCHES THE DOOR.\n\n>> IT MATCHES THE DOOR, YES.\n\nHuell: AND YOU SAID THERE WAS A CHAIR ON THE FRONT PORCH.\n\n>> THERE WERE 2 CHAIRS.\n\nSOMEONE ELSE LIKED THE OTHER ONE BETTER THAN I DID.\n\nHuell: IN BEVERLY HILLS, SOMEBODY-- >> IN BEVERLY HILLS, YES.\n\nI'VE ARRANGED TO PUT A LITTLE WHITE CHAIN ON THIS.\n\nHuell: OK. >> AND THEY'LL COME BACK WITH THEM.\n\nHuell: THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.\n\nHOW LONG--THIS IS TRADITIONAL OLD BEVERLY HILLS.\n\nHOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED IN THIS HOUSE?\n\n>> SINCE 1943.\n\nHuell: YOU'RE KIDDING.\n\nIN THE SAME HOUSE.\n\n>> I KID YOU NOT.\n\nIN THE SAME HOUSE.\n\nI KNOW THE SOUND OF EVERY DOOR CLOSING.\n\nI KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS HOUSE.\n\nHuell: MM-HMM.\n\nIT'S GOT GOOD BONES.\n\nIT'S GOT GOOD-- >> OH, IT HAS GOOD BONES.\n\nHuell: KARMA.\n\n>> GOOD--OH, HONEY, IT...IT LIVES A WONDERFUL LIFE.\n\nIT DID HAVE 2 MAGNOLIA TREES.\n\nHuell: WELL, HERE'S ONE RIGHT HERE.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER ONE?\n\n>> WELL, IT WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR.\n\nYOU CAN STILL SEE THE NAILS WHERE IT WAS HOLDING IT IN.\n\nAND MY HUSBAND SURPRISED ME WHILE I WAS OUT OF TOWN BY HAVING THE DRIVEWAY RESURFACED.\n\nAND IT DIDN'T DAWN ON HIM TO SAY, \"DON'T GO NEAR THAT LUMP IN THE DRIVEWAY.\n\nJUST PILE OVER IT.\"\n\nHuell: SO THEY TOOK THE-- >> THEY CUT IT.\n\nTHEY--THEY KILLED IT.\n\nHuell: WELL, YOU'VE STILL GOT A BEAUTIFUL YARD, A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE, A BEAUTIFUL DOOR.\n\nYOU'RE DRESSED FIT TO KILL.\n\n>> NO.\n\nHuell: I SAID THIS WAS GONNA BE INFORMAL, LOW-KEY.\n\n>> IT'S A SHIRT AND PANTS AND A WHITE COTTON BLOUSE.\n\nHuell: OK. OK. >> ALL RIGHT.\n\nHuell: I'VE COME TO PICK YOU UP.\n\nTAKE MY ARM.\n\n'CAUSE LISTEN, WHEN I PICK YOU UP FOR LUNCH, WHEN I INVITE YOU TO LUNCH, I PICK YOU UP AT THE FRONT DOOR.\n\n>> YOU ARE A CLASS ACT.\n\nHuell: AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO, THERE'S THE CAR RIGHT OVER THERE.\n\nYOU DON'T MIND RIDING IN MY LITTLE FORD, DO YOU?\n\n>> I HOPE IT'S A FORD.\n\nHuell: IT'S AN AMERICAN CAR.\n\n>> YOU

BIG, BEAUTIFUL TREE.\n\nHuell: RIGHT OVER HERE?\n\n>> YES.\n\nOHH.\n\nHuell: WELL.\n\n>> THAT'S THE HARDEST-- Huell: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL STREET, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.\n\nWE'RE HERE AT THE CAR, WE'RE LOADING UP, AND WE'RE HEADING TO LUNCH.\n\nGIVE THE CAMERA A WAVE, ANN.\n\nWE'RE OFF TO LUNCH.\n\n>> SEE YOU LATER.\n\nHuell: HERE WE GO.\n\nSTOP NUMBER 2.\n\nBECAUSE NOW I CAN REVEAL THE FACT THAT I DON'T HAVE A LUNCH DATE WITH ONE ANN, I HAVE A LUNCH DATE WITH 2 ANNS, RIGHT?\n\n>> BUT ONE HAS AN \"E\" ON THE NAME AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T.\n\nHuell: YOU'VE GOT THE \"E.\" >> I'VE GOT THE \"E.\" Huell: THE OTHER ANN TOLD ME YOU HAD AN \"E.\" >> SHE GOT CHEATED.\n\nSHE WAS CHEATED.\n\nHuell: SHE SAID YOU HAD A DANGLING \"E.\" AN EXTRA \"E\" THAT WASN'T NECESSARY.\n\n>> BUT IT'S PART OF THE NAME.\n\nHuell: ABSOLUTELY.\n\nTHAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT AT LUNCH.\n\nTHIS IS AMAZING.\n\nYOU DON'T LIVE THAT FAR FROM THE OTHER ANN.\n\nAND YOUR DOOR'S RED, HERS IS BLUE.\n\n>> WELL, WE NEED SOME WHITE IN THERE, DON'T WE?\n\nHuell: YEAH.\n\nWELL, YOU'VE GOT THE WHITE.\n\nRED, WHITE, AND BLUE.\n\nNOW, THIS IS WHO?\n\nWHO'S THIS FELLA?\n\n>> THIS IS MY SON DANA.\n\nHuell: NICE TO MEET YOU.\n\n>> NICE TO MEET YOU.\n\nPLEASURE.\n\nHuell: DID YOU COME OUT JUST TO MAKE SURE YOUR MOM WAS NOT JUST GOING OFF WITH ANYBODY FOR LUNCH TODAY?\n\n>> I ALWAYS CHECK UP ON HER TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE'S GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\n\nHuell: DOES HE REALLY KEEP A PRETTY GOOD EYE ON YOU?\n\n>> OH, YES.\n\nYES, HE DOES.\n\nHE REALLY SQUASHES A LOT OF MY SOCIAL LIFE THAT WAY.\n\nHuell: WELL, THANK YOU FOR LETTING HER GO OFF WITH ME TODAY.\n\n>> WELL, IT'S MY PLEASURE.\n\nTHANK YOU.\n\nHuell: 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE WITH THE OTHER ANN, AND SHE'S KIND OF A WILD ONE.\n\n>> I KNOW SHE IS.\n\nSHE CLAIMS THAT SHE CAME IN ON THE \"MAYFLOWER.\"\n\nAND SHE CLAIMS THAT SHE CAME IN ON THE FIRST WAGON TRAIN GOING WEST.\n\nSO BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM, I THINK YOU'RE IN FOR A REAL TROUBLE.\n\nHuell: I THINK WE ARE.\n\nAND YOU KNOW WHAT, WE WERE STANDING OUT HERE WAITING FOR JUST A SECOND, AND YOU STARTED TALKING ABOUT THAT TREE.\n\nYOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT A TREE IN YOUR YARD, TOO.\n\n>> CAN YOU SEE THE FRUIT ON IT?\n\nHuell: YEAH, THEY'RE--WHAT ARE THOSE?\n\n>> THEY'RE CALLED LOQUATS.\n\nHuell: LOQUATS?\n\n>> LOQUAT, YEAH.\n\nHuell: AND WAS THAT TREE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE?\n\n>> NO.\n\nIF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE STREET, THERE'S A TREE THERE JUST LOADED WITH THE FRUIT.\n\nAND SOME TIME, I DON'T KNOW, A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, I GUESS A LITTLE BIRD CAME OVER AND DROPPED A SEED.\n\nHuell: SO YOU GOT A LOQUAT IN YOUR YARD.\n\n>> IT JUST GROWED.\n\nHuell: AND YOU'VE LIVED IN YOUR HOUSE A LONG TIME AS WELL.\n\n>> YES.\n\nI THINK ABOUT 54 YEARS, MAYBE

BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.\n\nIT'S A BEAUTIFUL FRONT DOOR.\n\nIT'S A BEAUTIFUL TREE IN YOUR YARD.\n\nI GOT TO MEET YOUR SON.\n\n>> MY PLEASURE.\n\nHuell: THIS IS--NOW, WE'LL HAVE HER BACK-- >> SYNCHRONIZING WATCHES.\n\nHuell: YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE BEFORE NOON.\n\nI'LL HAVE THEM BACK BY 3:00.\n\n>> FANTASTIC.\n\nHuell: IS THAT OK?\n\n>> THAT'LL BE WONDERFUL.\n\nHuell: UNLESS--WHO KNOWS?\n\nWE MIGHT GET DIVERTED.\n\nI'M NOT SURE WHERE WE'RE GONNA END UP.\n\n>> WELL, THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY.\n\nALL YOU NEED TO DO IS CALL MY CELL PHONE.\n\nHuell: WE'LL LET YOU KNOW IF WE'RE RUNNING LATE.\n\n>> BUT WITH THE 2 ANNS, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.\n\nHuell: BOY, THAT'S THE TRUTH.\n\nWE GOT ONE ANN OVER HERE.\n\nCOME ON AND GET MY ARM.\n\nAND I'M PUTTING THE OTHER ANNE IN THE BACKSEAT.\n\n>> Y'ALL HAVE A GREAT TIME.\n\n>> THANK YOU.\n\nHuell: THE DOG'S OUT?\n\n>> NO, MY CAT, BLACKY.\n\nHuell: CAT'S OUT.\n\n>> DOGS ARE IN THE YARD AND THE CAT'S OUT.\n\nTHAT'S ANOTHER ONE OF MY DUTIES.\n\nHuell: ALL RIGHT, WE'RE OFF.\n\n>> HAVE FUN, Y'ALL.\n\nHuell: WE'LL BE BACK IN A LITTLE WHILE.\n\n>> TAKE CARE.\n\nHuell: WE'RE OFF TO LUNCH WITH THE 2 ANNS.\n\n>>

THE \"E.\" >> ABSOLUTELY.\n\nHuell: OK, NOW, WE ARE COMING TO LUNCH AT A PLACE THAT ANN NUMBER ONE SAID SHE WANTED TO COME TO.\n\nSHE SAW THE PROGRAM I DID ON THIS PLACE ON TELEVISION AND WANTED TO COME SEE IT FOR HERSELF.\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK AT FIRST GLANCE, ANN?\n\n>> IT IS DELIGHTFUL.\n\nHuell: ISN'T THIS BEAUTIFUL?\n\n>> OH.\n\n>> OH, IT'S A GARDEN.\n\nHuell: IT'S THE FRENCH GARDEN.\n\n>>

BEVERLY HILLS.\n\nHuell: HA HA!\n\nTHIS IS WHAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THIS PLACE IS THAT IT'S KIND OF HIDDEN HERE IN THE INDUSTRIAL PART OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES.\n\n>> YOU THINK WE'D EVER BE ABLE TO FIND IT AGAIN?\n\nHuell: ANN WOULD, WOULDN'T YOU?\n\n>> UH?\n\nHuell: FIND IT AGAIN.\n\n>> OH, I'LL FIND IT.\n\nI'LL STUDY MY MAP AND-- Huell: WE'RE OVER HERE.\n\nLET'S GO GET SEATED.\n\n>> THERE'S OUR MENU.\n\nHuell: THERE'S THE MENU.\n\nBENOIT IS GONNA BE HERE IN A MINUTE TO GREET US, BUT WE'LL GO OVER HERE.\n\nWE'VE GOT THE TABLE RESERVED OVER HERE.\n\n>> ALL RIGHT.\n\n>> WELL, I AM ABSOLUTELY STUNNED.\n\nHuell: WE'RE HEADING OVER TO OUR TABLE IN THE FRENCH GARDEN.\n\nWE'RE READY TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE LUNCH, BUT WE'RE GONNA TALK FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WE EAT.\n\nAND HERE HE COMES.\n\nHERE IS THE OWNER, BENOIT.\n\n>> WELCOME TO THE FRENCH GARDEN.\n\n>> BLESS YOUR HEART.\n\nHOW NICE TO MEET YOU.\n\n>> IT'S AN HONOR.\n\nIT'S AN HONOR.\n\nNICE TO MEET YOU.\n\nHuell: SHE SAW THIS ON TELEVISION.\n\nSHE SAW THE PROGRAM WE DID ABOUT IT.\n\n>> THANK YOU FOR COMING.\n\nWELCOME.\n\nIT'S A GREAT DAY TODAY.\n\n>> I'M ENCHANTED WITH WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.\n\n>> IT WASN'T TOO HARD TO FIND IT?\n\n>> OH, SHE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW TO GET HERE.\n\n>> NO, SHE DOESN'T.\n\nSHE'LL GO HOME AND CHECK WITH HER MAP.\n\n>> I'LL FIND IT.\n\n>> I'M SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY.\n\nHuell: THANK YOU

BEFORE HERE.\n\nYOU ALL ARE VERY SPECIAL.\n\n>> CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK TO START?\n\nHuell: WELL, BENOIT TOOK OUR DRINK ORDERS.\n\nAND THEN, BEFORE WE ORDERED OUR LUNCH, IT WAS TIME TO SETTLE IN AND TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE LIVES OF THESE 2 REMARKABLE LADIES.\n\nOK, NOW WE'RE KIND OF ADJUSTED HERE.\n\nWE'RE DOWN AT THE TABLE.\n\nWE'RE GETTING READY TO HAVE OUR DISCUSSION.\n\nFIRST OF ALL, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE MET, WHICH WAS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IN PALM DESERT.\n\nWE WERE ALL ATTENDING A FUNDRAISING DINNER FOR THE LIVING DESERT, RIGHT.\n\n>> RIGHT.\n\nHuell: WE WERE ALL AT THE SAME TABLE.\n\n>> YES.\n\nHuell: BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW EACH OTHER AT THE TIME.\n\n>> NO.\n\nI KNEW ANNE.\n\nANNE KNEW ME.\n\nTHE OTHER PEOPLE WERE TOTAL STRANGERS.\n\nAND AS I SAT DOWN AND PUT MY NAPKIN ON MY LAP, I LOOKED UP AND RIGHT ACROSS FROM ME I SAW A FACE I RECOGNIZED.\n\nAND ACCUSINGLY, I SAID, \"YOU'RE HUELL HOWSER!\"\n\nAND HE VERY POLITELY NODDED, SAID, \"YES, I AM.\"\n\nWITH THAT, I, WITHOUT HESITATION, TURNED TO A TOTAL STRANGER--I MUST HAVE BEEN OUT OF MY MIND--ON MY LEFT AND SAID, \"SIR, WOULD YOU MIND CHANGING PLACES WITH ME MR.
