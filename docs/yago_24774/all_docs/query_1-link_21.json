        "text": "In the early 1950s, while the film industry was blaming the sharp decline in cinema attendance on the proliferation of television throughout the US, many film actors welcomed the one-eyed monster that boosted several fading careers. One such figure to benefit from the new medium was Robert Sterling, who has died aged 88.\n\nHe had been in films since 1939, playing bland second leads or heroes in B-movies, when he was cast in Topper. This was a comedy-fantasy TV series based on the novels of Thorne Smith and the 1937 film of the same name, starring Cary Grant and Constance Bennett.\n\nSterling and his real-life wife, Anne Jeffreys, played George and Marion Kerby, a ghostly couple recently killed in an avalanche while skiing, who return to their home, with their brandy-loving St Bernard dog, to haunt the stuffy new owner, banker Cosmo Topper (Leo G Carrol). The fact that the phantom trio is only seen by Topper, causes his wife, maid and boss to think he is mad. As each episode was a variation on this one joke and depended on the ghosts appearing and disappearing, walking through walls and moving objects about - it was one of the first TV shows to use special effects - it is a tribute to the performers, especially Sterling, that the show ran from 1953 to 1956, with constant repeats.\n\nThe son of a professional baseball player, the actor was born in Pennsylvania as William Sterling Hart. At the start of his film career, he became Robert Sterling to avoid confusion with William S Hart, although the silent screen cowboy star had long retired.\n\nAfter attending the University of Pittsburgh, and a few years as a clothes salesman, the soft-featured, dark-haired Sterling, aged 22, gained a contract with Columbia Studios. There, he had bit parts in as many as 16 films in 1939 alone. The following year, at 20th Century Fox, he graduated to leads in three B-movies, one of which was as a stiff lawman in The Gay Caballero, in the Cisco Kid western series.\n\nBut it was at MGM, at its peak in the 1940s, that he had high hopes of stardom. However, after nine films in two years, Sterling had made little impact, frequently losing both a good part and the girl to the bigger star. He unsuccessfully vied for Lana Turner with Clark Gable in Somewhere I'll Find You (1941) and with Robert Taylor in Johnny Eager (1942), but did get the chance to dance with Greta Garbo in her last film, Two-Faced Woman (1941), before she ends up with Melvyn Douglas.\n\nIn Ringside Maisie (1941), one of the 10 films starring Ann Southen as the irrepressible showgirl, Sterling plays an up-and-coming boxer, who confides in Maisie that he is terrified and wants out. Nevertheless, he takes one more fight in which he is blinded. Off screen, Sterling married Southen in 1943. (Their daughter Tisha Sterling became an actor, playing opposite Clint Eastwood in Coogan's Buff, among other movies.)\n\nAfter the second world war, during which he served as an US army air force flight instructor stationed in London, Sterling made two good westerns, Roughshod (1949) and The Sundowners (1950), and was back at MGM briefly for Showboat (1951). In the latter, he plays an actor who marries leading lady Julie Dozier (Ava Gardner). When the couple are forced to leave the boat after Julie is exposed as having white and black parentage, he drinks a drop of her blood to prove that he has black blood in him.\n\nIn 1951, now divorced from Southen, Sterling was appearing in The Gramercy Ghost on Broadway when he met Anne Jeffreys, who was starring in Kiss Me, Kate at the theatre opposite. They were married a few months later and, after Topper had made them household names, devoted most of the rest of their careers to television.\n\nBetween appearing in TV series such as Wagon Train, Fantasy Island, Hotel and Murder, She Wrote, Sterling made inferior pictures such as Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea, Return To Peyton Place (both 1961) and A Global Affair (1962). While his wife continued to act (most famously as David Haselhoff's mother in Bay Watch), he became a businessman in a company that implemented the software for one of the first supermarket barcoding and computer inventory systems. He later launched Sterling and Sons, a Santa Monica manufacturer of golf clubs.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, their three sons and Tisha Sterling, the daughter of his first marriage."
