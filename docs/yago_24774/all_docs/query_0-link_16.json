        "text": "Anne Jeffreys\n\nIn memory of actress and Walk of Famer Anne Jeffreys, flowers were placed on her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday, September 28, 2017, at 12 p.m. PDT. The star in category of Television is located at 1501 Vine Street. “Rest in peace beautiful Anne.” Ana Martinez, Producer of the Hollywood Walk of Fame signed the card on behalf of the Hollywood Historic Trust and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAnne Jeffreys is an American actress and singer.\n\nBorn Anne Carmichael in Goldsboro, North Carolina, Jeffreys entered the entertainment field at a young age; her initial training was in voice, but she decided as a teenager to sign with the John Robert Powers agency as a junior model.\n\nHer plans for an operatic career were sidelined when she was cast in a staged musical review, Fun for the Money. Her appearance in that revue led to her being cast in her first movie role, in I Married an Angel, starring Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. She was under contract to both RKO and Republic Studios during the 1940s, including several appearances as Tess Trueheart in the Dick Tracy series, and the 1944 Frank Sinatra musical Step Lively. She also appeared in the horror comedy Zombies on Broadway with Wally Brown and Alan Carney in 1945.\n\nWhen her career faltered, she instead focused on her stage career, playing lead roles on Broadway in productions such as the 1947 opera Street Scene, the 1948 Cole Porter musical Kiss Me, Kate and the 1952 musical Three Wishes for Jamie. With long-term husband Robert Sterling, who was first married to Ann Sothern, she appeared in the CBS sitcom Topper, in which she was billed in a voiceover as “the ghostess with the mostest”.\n\namzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";amzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"hwof05-20\";amzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"search\";amzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";amzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";amzn_assoc_region = \"US\";amzn_assoc_default_search_phrase = \"Anne Jeffreys\";amzn_assoc_default_category = \"All\";amzn_assoc_linkid = \"55eff95a50b66e89ff63cd2b2fd4e0af\";amzn_assoc_search_bar = \"false\";amzn_assoc_title = \"Shop Anne Jeffreys\";"
