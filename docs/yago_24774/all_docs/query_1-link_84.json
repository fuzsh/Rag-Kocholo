        "text": "From a young age, Anne Jeffreys had a flair for entertainment. Born in North Carolina in 1923, she was singing at Carnegie Hall by her teens. Initially, she set her sights on modeling or singing, but successful stage acting performances led her to a role in the musical movie \"I Married an Angel\" (1942). From there, she was in dozens of movies throughout the 1940s, most notably in \"Dillinger\" (1945) and \"Dick Tracy vs. Cue Ball\" (1945). By the end of the '40s, her film career stalled, so Jeffreys returned to the stage, which led to her meeting her second husband, actor Robert Sterling. The pair appeared on the sitcom \"Topper\" (CBS 1953-55). After \"Topper,\" Jeffreys semi-retired from acting to focus on being a wife and mother to her eventual three children. By the 1970s, she was back in the thick of it, though, returning to notoriety with her Golden Globe-nominated turn in the mini-series \"The Delphi Bureau\" (ABC 1972). After a slew of guest appearances in shows and films, she had a leading role on the short-lived Aaron Spelling drama \"Finder of Lost Loves\" (ABC 1984-85). Around the same time, Jeffreys started her most enduring role of Amanda Barrington on the soap opera \"General Hospital\" (ABC 1963- ), continuing to play the character for 20 years, including appearances on spin-off \"Port Charles\" (ABC 1997-2003). Her last on-screen appearance was in an episode of \"Getting On\" (HBO 2013-15), a comedy drama set in a hospital ward. Anne Jeffreys died on September 27, 2017 at the age of 94."
