Law,\" and \"Murder, She Wrote.\"\n\nShe also played David Hasselhoff's mother on \"Baywatch.\"\n\nJeffreys was nominated for a Golden Globe in 1972 for the film \"The Delphi Bureau\" and holds the honor of being the last person to dance with Fred Astaire on screen in an episode of the original \"Battlestar Galactica\" series.\n\nMore recently, Jeffreys is known for her work on \"General Hospital\" and in \"Port Charles\" as Amanda Barrington.
