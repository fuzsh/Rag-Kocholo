Countries such as Japan, China, and South Korea have a traditional significance of fish in their diet, and hence, the high demand for fish in these countries has aided the growth of the seafood market. Other emerging economies in the region, such as India, are also interested in canned and frozen seafood products. This is expected to aid the growth of the seafood market in the region over the forecast period\n\nFrozen seafood products are freeze-processed, which aids in preventing bacterial formation on the food products and increases the shelf life of the food products. Similarly, canned fish are processed and preserved in sealed airtight containers such as aluminum or tin can. Canned fish usually has a shelf life of one to five years. Canned seafood products are gaining immense traction among consumers, owing to the rising demand for convenience foods. The escalating consumer preference toward convenience foods indirectly favors canned seafood products such as canned tuna, canned salmon, and canned mackerel. They require less time and effort as compared to cooking fresh seafood. Moreover, the rising disposable income in various developing countries is another factor that significantly influences the demand for frozen and canned seafood products.\n\nSeafood Market: Segmental Overview\n\nBased on type, the seafood market is segmented into fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and others. The fish segment accounted for the largest share of the market in 2020. They are widely consumed and available worldwide. The crustaceans segment is expected to witness significant growth over the forecast period.

Disruptions in supply chains have restricted the movement of goods, which, in turn, is hindering the distribution and manufacturing of various products. Seafood importing countries and companies are struggling financially, as many businesses closed down during the pandemic. Hence, many importers canceled, postponed, or reduced their orders during the beginning of the pandemic. Trade was also affected as many borders were closed due to the global travel bans imposed by countries in Europe, Asia, and North America. This also affected business collaborations and partnerships opportunities. All these factors have negatively affected the seafood market. However, improving vaccination rates and the return of many major economies to normalcy are expected to aid the recovery of the seafood market.\n\nAbout Us:\n\nThe Insight Partners is a one stop industry research provider of actionable intelligence.
