Based on our analysis, the market had exhibited a growth of 12.34% in 2020 as compared to 2019.\n\nThe market is experiencing rapid growth owing to the rising per capita consumption, increasing disposable income, and growing consumer inclination toward pescetarianism across the globe.\n\nOver the years, a drastic shift has been observed in the consumption pattern of individuals toward a healthy diet, influencing the changes in consumer preferences. The seafood market share in the food industry is expected to increase in the upcoming years, as individuals mainly prefer seafood-based products over poultry and beef due to the equivalent amount of protein with lower calories. Such shifting consumption patterns will fuel market growth.\n\nThe seafood industry is reaching new heights in every part of the world in terms of production, supply, and consumption. The consumption of fish and other products is rapidly growing due to rising awareness about the importance of seafood-based products and changing lifestyle patterns. Since most countries experienced the lockdown effects, a shortage was observed in the production capacity due to the closure of production plants and reduced purchasing power of the consumers. However, the market found its pace in the latter half of the year 2020 as the consumers focused on seeking convenient and nutritionally rich products in their day-to-day diet more than ever. Moreover, increase in home cooking in the pandemic phase facilitated the incorporation of such products in various cuisines, which further improved the growth potential.\n\nSeafood Market Trends\n\nMarket Value to Rise Due to Increase in Purchase of Premium Products\n\nIn recent years, the rising trend for premium and luxury products is gaining prominence owing to the growing health benefits, rising healthy eating habits of consumers, and escalated income earnings. The industry has faced numerous challenges in order to sustain their position in the market and thus, the products with strong nutritional score and lowest climate impact should be highly promoted for consumption. Besides this, advancements in the packaging technologies such as active food packaging, vacuum packaging and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), also plays an important role in sustaining the quality attributes of the products. Such techniques further helps in preserving and controlling the growth of food pathogens in the fishery products and others. Moreover, in order to fulfill the rising demand of variety of seafoods, the countries are intensively working towards producing sufficient amount of products across the market.

Owing to rapid urbanization and busy lifestyles of consumers, the demand for products with longer shelf life has increased. The trend of easy-to-cook products has significantly increased over the years due to the advancements in processing techniques, well-equipped cold storage chains, as well as drastic changes in the food habits. In addition, the growing innovations in the product development such as frozen, canned, and smoked seafood offer lucrative opportunities for convenient cooking amid the busy schedules of individuals.\n\nMarket Growth to be Driven by Rising Inclination Toward Adoption of Pescetarianism\n\nSeafood consumption in the world has consistently increased over the past years. The improvement of living standards in developing countries, such as China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, and the health consciousness of some developed countries have contributed to this increase in consumption.

Various consumers worldwide follow a pescetarian lifestyle, where they consume fish along with a vegetarian diet owing to health-related factors. Fish, particularly salmon, herring, and trout, provide health benefits in addition to nutritional value and are concentrated with omega-3 fatty acids.

Moreover, vegan or plant-based meat is gaining popularity as celebrities have started to endorse and promote veganism. For instance, in February 2022, Blue Tribe Foods announced Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma as investors and brand ambassadors for their meat-alternatives products.
