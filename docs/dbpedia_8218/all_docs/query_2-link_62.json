        "text": "The latest report by IMARC Group, titled \"Organic Seafood Market Report by Product Type (Fishes, Crustaceans, Molluscs, and Others), Product Form (Fresh, Frozen, Canned, Chilled, and Others), Distribution Channel (Supermarkets and Hypermarkets, Convenience Stores, Online Stores, and Others), and Region 2024-2032,\" finds that the global organic seafood market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% during 2024-2032. Organic seafood refers to a wide range of food items obtained through aquaculture and cultivated using organic farming methods, excluding artificial chemicals, antibiotics, feed activities, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Organic aquaculture involves raising aquatic animals in humane and sanitary conditions that are sustainable and pollution-free. These seafood variations are healthier and have better nutritional value than their traditional counterparts. Since it helps lower blood pressure and reduces the chance of developing cardiovascular diseases, organic seafood is gaining immense traction among the masses across the globe.\n\nGlobal Organic Seafood Market Trends:\n\nThe significant expansion of the organic aquaculture sector represents the primary factor driving the market growth. Moreover, the surging adoption of organic farming by aquaculture farmers to improve resource productivity and the nutritional content of products is positively influencing market growth. Additionally, the shifting consumer inclination toward organic seafood due to the rising instances of food-borne illnesses caused by pathogens, including salmonella, calicivirus, and hepatitis A virus found in conventionally cultured seafood, has augmented the product demand. Besides this, there has been a substantial shift from high-calorie foods toward protein-rich diets owing to the surging awareness regarding its health benefits. In line with this, the increasing focus on sustainable development and inflating consumer disposable incomes are contributing to market growth. Furthermore, governments of numerous countries are taking favorable initiatives to promote organic fish farming practices among farmers. For instance, the launch of campaigns to educate farmers regarding the benefits of organic farming and the provision of attractive incentives are propelling the market growth. Other factors, including the growing health consciousness among consumers, easy availability of organic seafood via online and offline retail channels, elevating sales of frozen seafood products, and rapid growth in the food industry, are also anticipated to create a favorable market outlook.\n\nMarket Summary:\n\nThe market has been segmented based on the product type into fishes (salmon, pollock, tuna, and others), crustaceans (crabs, shrimps, prawns, and others), mollusks (scallops, oysters, and others), and others.\n\nOn the basis of the product form, the market has been classified into frozen, canned, fresh, chilled, and others.\n\nThe market has been divided based on the distribution channel into convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets, online stores, and others.\n\nOn the geographical front, the market has been segregated into North America (the United States and Canada), Europe (Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, Italy, and others), Asia Pacific (China, Japan, India, South Korea, Australia, Indonesia, and others), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, and others), and the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe competitive landscape of the market has also been analyzed, with some of the key players being Anova Seafood B.V., Artisanfish LLC, Dom International Limited, Glenarm Organic Salmon Ltd., Mowi ASA, Mseafood Corporation, Nueva Pescanova S.L.
