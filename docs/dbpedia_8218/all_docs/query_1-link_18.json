        "text": "Tuesday, March 12, 2.40 p.m. EST\n\nMediterranean bass prices rising again\n\nThe Mediterranean seabass market is seeing an upswing, with 35 percent higher prices compared to the end of last year.\n\nFish of 400-600 grams are fetching prices of €5.80 ($7.51) in Greece, Sinan Kiziltan, vice president of the executive board at Turkish producer Kilic told IntraFish.\n\nThe value of the fish “drastically dropped” by the end of 2012, due to “cash flow problems of Greek companies,” he said.\n\nThe market is healthier, and prices are expected to remain stable until this summer.\n\nArticle continues below the advert\n\nNevertheless, consolidation is a must to bring more stability into the sector, he said.\n\n“Somebody will have to take the action,”Kiziltan said, speculating Dias and Selonda could be at the forefront of the movement – with private equity firm Linnaeus playing a major role.\n\n-- Elisabeth Fischer\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 2.30 p.m. EST\n\nFriosur: ‘We want to play an active role in Chile’s consolidation’\n\nChilean salmon farmer Friosur, which recently acquired several Chilean production licenses from Leroy AS in Aysen, Chile, will look into further mergers and acquisitions in the future.\n\n“The industry needs to go through this process,” Joachim Wessel, general manager at the company, told IntraFish. “We want to be an active player.”\n\nWessel wouldn’t share any specific details but said there are several interesting developments in the sector the company is closely following.\n\n-- Elisabeth Fischer\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 2:10 p.m. EST\n\n‘US needs organic aqua standards’\n\nEcuadorian shrimp farmer Langosmar wants to work more in the United States -- but the organic producer said without organic aquaculture standards, it’s difficult.\n\nThe 30-year-old family-owned farmer became organic certified in 2005, but exports mainly to Europe because the United States lack of standards, Maria Jose Aguayo told IntraFish. US buyers’ unwillingness to pay a bit more for organic is a challenge, too.\n\n“It’s a little more expensive because it is harder to grow,” Aguayo said. “People are more price aware than quality aware here.”\n\n--Avani Nadkarni\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 2:05 p.m. EST\n\nEcuador company predicts even better 2013\n\nEcuadorian shrimp saw an excellent year in 2013, as the amount imported to the United States rose due to the crisis at Asia’s farms—and one shrimp farmer thinks this year will be better.\n\n“2012 was a good year but I think 2013 will be better,” Quirola’s Cesar Estupinian told IntraFish. The company has several farms in Ecuador and sells into the United States and Europe.\n\n--Avani Nadkarni\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 2 p.m. EST\n\nOne Ecuadorian company selling much less to US\n\nWhile other Ecuadorian companies are selling more to the United States of late, Corinto has drastically reduced its exports.\n\nAs opposed to the farmed shrimp most Ecuadorians export, Corinto exports mostly wild-caught fish and squid and much of it is HGT. The company used to export 80 percent to the United States and 20 percent to the rest of the world and now they export only 15 percent to the US, Sales Director Mauricio Trujillo told IntraFish.\n\n“It maybe has to do with the types of products we process,” he said. “People in the states are used to having fillets.”\n\n--Avani Nadkarni\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 12.30 p.m. EST\n\nFOS: We grow 30% every year\n\nIn the past two years Friend of the Sea has grown its certified fisheries and aquaculture producers by 30 percent annually, Paolo Bray, its director told IntraFish.\n\n“We get around one application a day, about 300 per year,” said Antonio D’Agnelli, FOS’ customer relationship manager.\n\nAbout 100 out of all applications are passing the audit every year, he said.\n\n-- Elisabeth Fischer\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 12:10 p.m. EST\n\nSysco launches fresh fish line\n\nSysco is at the show again with its own booth. The reason? The distribution behemoth is introducing a fresh fish program under its corporate Portico line.\n\nThe company will also be doing some direct processing of seafood through its affiliate companies.\n\n-- John Fiorillo\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 12:00 p.m. EST\n\nTrident features spicy shrimp\n\nTrident Seafoods is featuring its Pubhouse Beer-Battered Seafood line at the show. The line includes all the usual species -- cod, haddock, pollock -- but has one interesting addition -- shrimp, the company's first ever shrimp product.\n\nThe craft beer-battered shrimp was served up at the show with a spicy buffalo-style hot sauce that has plenty of kick.\n\n-- John Fiorillo\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 11.30 a.m. EST\n\nThe year of the retailers\n\nVerlasso had a massive year in 2012 and this year is going to be the same, said director Scott Nichols.\n\n''Last year was the year of the distributors,'' Nichols told IntraFish. ''This year is going to be the year of the retailers. We want our salmon to be available to people.''\n\nRight now, the salmon on the market is split about 50/50 with distributors and retailers, he said. He's also continuing to work with chefs, who he said ''have the most cutting-edge ideas about food.\"\n\n-- Avani Nadkarni\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 11.20 a.m. EST\n\nYemenese company looks to Americas\n\nFirst-time IBSS exhibitor Burum Seafood, based in Yemen, said although Europe and Asia are their main markets currently, they are now looking to the Americas.\n\n“We've gotten to know some markets that we didn't know before,” Managing Director Ali Al-Habashi told IntraFish, adding that his $25 million company provides fresh and frozen lobster, kettlefish, pelagics, grouper, among other species.\n\n-- Avani Nadkarni\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 11.a.m. EST\n\nIcelandic salted cod eyeing bigger Canadian market share\n\nCanada will prove to be a strong market for Icelandic fishery products, Hlynur Guojonsson, Trade Commissioner at the Consulate General of Iceland, told IntraFish when we stopped by the Icelandic booth.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2012, sales to Canada increased by 100 percent, he said. Salted cod in particular proved to be a top seller, with 5,000 metric tons going to Canadian consumers last year.\n\nThe focus is on growth, Guojonsson said, especially because salted cod is seeing lower volumes consumed in southern Europe due to the financial crisis there.\n\nHaddock and herring will be other key export products.\n\nIceland’s plan is supported by improved logistical settings, Guojonsson said, with the first direct freight flight having gone out from Iceland to Toronto on March 8.\n\nThis will be expanded further when in October 2013 the Open Sky Agreement comes into force.\n\n“This will open up the market for fresh fish,” Guojonsson said.\n\n-- Elisabeth Fischer\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 10.38 a.m. EST\n\nFrozen supplier to tap into growing Brazilian, Argentinian markets\n\nUS food company Quirch is eyeing the growing Brazilian and Argentinian markets with its Panamei frozen seafood brand.\n\n“We’re trying to develop relationships there,” said Jorge Roza, marketing manager at Quirch, “but we’re not there yet.”\n\nThe company, which established the Panamei brand six years ago, has good connections to Peru, with a sales office there, and sees Latin America as a growing and expanding market for frozen seafood.\n\n-- Elisabeth Fischer\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 8:16 a.m. EST\n\nGood luck for the baby…\n\nCanadian seafood company Ocean Choice is venturing into China with the latest addition to its range: sea cucumber.\n\n“We’ve introduced them this year and they are a big thing in China,” one spokesperson said, when IntraFish visited the company’s booth at the Boston show.\n\nWhile the product is not very nice to look at, it’s a delicacy in China, he said -- especially among pregnant women, said to bring god luck for the unborn child.\n\nThe sea cucumbers are harvested in Canada and while the company wasn’t able to share any specific volumes, the spokesperson said the numbers shipped to China this year are going to be “significant.”\n\nWhen asked if he had tried the product, he said “not yet.”\n\n-- Elisabeth Fischer\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 08.14. a.m. EST\n\nPanga exporter ventures into US wholesale market\n\nVietnamese exporter Navico is eyeing wholesale contracts in the United States due to the “high potential” for pangasius and catfish in the market.\n\nThe company -- a first-time attender at the show -- recently opened a sales office in LA, California, Phuong Doan, vice director of Navico USA, said, with plans capture more market share.\n\n-- Elisabeth Fischer\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, March 12, 7:30 a.m. EST\n\nBrand-new label selling to Whole Foods, Wegman's\n\nJust one year ago, Elevation Brands CEO Chuck Marble had just launched seafood brand Blue Horizon Wild -- now he is selling to top US retailers such as Whole Foods and Wegman's.\n\nThe brand is \"value-added, sustainable, all-natural, convenient,\" Marble told IntraFish.\n\nThe company launched new ready-to-heat seafood items such as seafood cannelloni, which has crab, scallops, shrimp, lobster and pollock in it.\n\n\"We're here to learn more about the supply chain,\" said Marble.\n\nMuch of Blue Horizon's fish comes from Alaska.\n\n--Avani Nadkarni\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 5:10 p.m. EST\n\nKorean companies eye US market\n\nEight Korean companies showed up to IBSS, eager to jump into the American market.\n\nSouth Korea-based Hosan was presenting a brand new product for sale into the United States: Dried seaweed for salads. The crunchy product takes just a five minute soak in water to be ready-to-serve, a representative told IntraFish. Hosan was searching for buyers.\n\n\"We want to have a good distributor in the US.\"\n\n--Avani Nadkarni\n\n----------------------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 4:51 p.m. EST\n\nSalmon's market strength poised to grow\n\nThere’s no reason why the growth of the salmon market should come to an end, Martin Ovrebo, deputy CEO at Coast Seafood, told IntraFish.\n\n“The industry has developed and become cleverer with their marketing -- everybody wants salmon,” he said. \"Consumers like it at the moment.\"\n\nSalmon has become more and more available, he said, but at the same time Ovrebo criticized current developments with lower slaughter volumes and higher prices.\n\n“It’s always the same cycle,” he said. A growth rate of 5 to 10 percent would be ideal, “not 31 percent in one year and nothing in the next.”\n\n-- Elisabeth Fischer\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 4:45 p.m. EST\n\nOrganic certification backbone for mussels’ success\n\nHopes are high for Newfoundland blue mussels producers to boost demand – and with it prices – after its recent organic certification, Juan Roberts, president at Iceberg Select said.\n\n“It should give us more backbone in the United States,” he said.\n\nNewfoundland mussel producers currently supply 50 percent of their produce to the United States, the rest goes into the domestic market.\n\n-- Elisabeth Fischer\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 3:40 p.m. EST\n\nPebble Mine: 'We're going to protect our fisheries'\n\nAlaska Governor Sean Parnell on the Pebble Mine issue: If the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) doesn't prevent it, \"as a state, we're going to protect our fisheries and we're not going to promote one resource over another.\"\n\n--Avani Nadkarni\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 3:39 p.m. EST\n\nAlaska governor: 'We want to sell MSC and RFM'\n\n“Alaska, along with other states and countries, does a good job maintaining our stock,” Alaska Governor Sean Parnell said in a meeting at the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute (ASMI ) booth. “That’s why we have pursued an RFM (FAO-based Responsible Fisheries Management) strategy.”\n\nAlaska wants to be able to sell Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and RFM seafood, he added. As for not having certification at all, “I think certain segments of our industry [look] for certification.”\n\n--Avani Nadkarni\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 3:09 p.m. EST\n\nIn Mexico, wild and farmed both struggle\n\nShrimp supplier Ocean Garden, like every other supplier on the US market, is riding the wave of a chaotic shrimp market.\n\nThe company, known for its expertise in Mexican shrimp, has had to step away from its roots over the past several years, with the country’s shrimp aquaculture sector being hit by white spot, and the wild sector being hit by low volumes last year.\n\nCelso Lopez, Ocean Garden CFO, said that while there is a premium for Mexican shrimp in the US market, right now the upward pressure is on every species with the shrimp shortage out of Thailand.\n\nThe Mexican farmed shrimp sector won’t recover to the 2007-2008 levels, Lopez said, but he expects to see the industry expand at a steady pace over time.\n\n“It should ramp up,” Lopez said. “There’s land, there’s potential, but the fact is that farmers have been hard hit by white spot, and that makes it difficult to get investments.”\n\nThe wild shrimp season that just ended Mar. 8 was not a great one. Lopez is hopeful that the upcoming wild shrimp season – which starts next September – will be better.\n\nOcean Garden National Sales Manager Jim Charters said he hasn’t seen prices rise so quickly in a long, long time.\n\n“The rapid increase in prices has been remarkable,” said Charters. “Americans are used to paying so little for shrimp. We’ll see how it plays out.”\n\n--Drew Cherry\n\n--------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 3:00 p.m. EST\n\nFish on a stick\n\nInterest has been very strong at the Harvest Select booth for Alaskan Fsh ‘n Sticks, produced by Chang International and sold in the US through Harvest Select.\n\nThe lightly battered, hand-filleted Alaska cod and pollock on a stick is drawing lots of attention from quick-service and other restaurant chain buyers, as well as deli and convenience store operators.\n\nThe product can be deep-fried – bamboo skewer and all – and is a natural fit on kid’s menus.\n\nThe product is made in Chang International’s plants in China.\n\n-- John Fiorillo\n\n------------------------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 2:35 p.m. EST\n\nShining Ocean launches newsurimi product\n\nSeattle-area surimi company Shining Ocean launched a new salmon tempura surimi product, president Robert Bleu told IntraFish.\n\nThe product is made with ground Alaska pollock, salmon and whiting.\n\n--Avani Nadkarni\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 2:13 p.m. EST\n\nMPEDA: India's not giving subsidies\n\nIndia's Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) Chairman Leena Nair told IntraFish the country is not giving subsidies to the industry.\n\nThe country is named as one of seven under investigation from the US Deparment of Commerce (DOC) and International Trade Commission (ITC), but Nair said \"the kind of money we pay to the industry is very, very miniscule.\" The farms are \"tiny,\" she said, and are \"affected by all the vagracies of nature.\"\n\n\"It's no subsidies, its deferring something like 10 percent of the small farmers' costs\" if they lose business due to events like natural disasters, she said.\n\n--Avani Nadkarni\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 2:02 p.m. EST\n\nHigh scallop prices don't scare us\n\nAtlantic scallop prices are likely to jump this year but that doesn’t scare Wade Wiestling, vice president of culinary development for the Oceanaire Seafood Room restaurant chain.\n\nScallops were the restaurant chain’s top seller by volume last year, and Wiestling is confident sales will remain steady even in the face of rising prices.\n\n“People like to eat scallops in restaurants; they are less likely to cook them at home,” he said.\n\nThe chain only uses fresh scallops and has a good network of suppliers, said Wiestling.\n\nAnd if you’re wondering what the #2 and #3 sellers are at the chain: seafood mixed grill (combination of fish, shrimp and scallops) and halibut.\n\nThe Landry’s owned chain operates 10 restaurants across the United States.\n\n-- John Fiorillo\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 1.29 p.m. EST\n\nPescanova's crisis pulling down turbot prices\n\nStruggling company Pescanova is threatening other companies in the sector, pulling down turbot prices, Ruth Sedofeito, commercial director at Spanish producer Stolt Sea Farm, told IntraFish.\n\n“When Pescanova entered the sector, the market had to revise prices downward,” she said.

The country is making real progress.\n\n“The first step is to recognize there is something to improve, then analyze the scale,” said Tuomo Poutiainen, program manager for the ILO.\n\nThe Thai government will meet with industry members Tuesday to give an update on labor issues in the seafood sector; ILO will be there to give its feedback.\n\n“This can’t be done by the ILO alone – we need the industry to participate,” he said.\n\nThe ILO is in constant dialogue with major retail and foodservice buyers, all of who have “a corporate risk” in purchasing from a country with potential labor issues.\n\nThe United States State Department currently ranks Thailand as a Tier 2 “watch” country, which means there are a multitude of issues that need addressing. The US State Department issues a new report at the end of the year, and shrimp suppliers fear that if Thailand is dropped down to Tier 3, the major buyers will be forced to back away.\n\nWhile there are very real problems in Thailand, Poutiainen said it’s important that the Thai seafood industry not be singled out as the only country of concern; other countries and industries have plenty of issues as well.\n\n“Have you looked at the report?” he asked rhetorically. “There are a lot of countries in the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions that need a lot of work.”\n\nThailand’s focus on improving will hopefully help lift the standards of neighboring countries, he said.\n\n--Drew Cherry\n\n------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 7:36 a.m. EST\n\nLet's go SIRFing now\n\nYou can never have too much research – especially in the seafood industry.

Research supported by SIRF covers a wide range of topics including studies related to: the health effects of eating fish and seafood; fisheries resource management; developments in aquaculture and acceptance of aquaculture products; Food safety; and new harvesting, farming, freezing, packaging, and processing technologies.\n\nThe fund does not engage in political or legislative lobbying, and is affiliated with, but not a part of, the National Fisheries Institute.\n\nFor more information contact SIRF at: admin@SIRFonline.org.\n\n-- John Fiorillo\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 7:30 a.m. EST\n\nSecure your salmon supplies\n\nWith prices still climbing in the US market, it’s safe to say that Chilean salmon is back – at least on the demand side.\n\n“All we are hearing from our customers is, ‘salmon’s selling fast,’” Camanchaca USA President Bert Bachmann said. “Whether it’s restaurant or retail, the feedback is that consumers perceive it as a value.”\n\nUnlike other years, Bachmann said contracts are being put in place for longer periods of time, and earlier than usual.\n\n“There is a sense that ‘I better secure fish,’” Bachmann said. “For once, price is not the main issue.”\n\nCamanchaca does around 85-90 percent of its business on contracts; currently 75 percent of its contracts are for a period of three months or more.\n\nCustomers are for the most part understanding of the price increases, Bachmann said.\n\n“The really respected restaurant and retail buyers want stability,” Bachmann said. “They don’t want to see prices hit below production costs.”\n\n--Drew Cherry\n\n---------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 7:00 a.m. EST\n\nNot jerking around\n\nBrooklyn, New York-based Acme Smoked Foods has extended its King salmon jerky line, and is setting its sights on an entirely new area of sales: sporting goods and convenience stores.\n\n“It’s a huge new learning curve for us,” Gabriel Viteri, vice president of strategy and business development. “We are hitting new channels we have had no experience with, and dealing with distributors we have never heard of.”\n\nThe new market puts Acme head-to-head with an American icon: beef jerky.\n\nViteri is convinced salmon jerky can find a place in sporting goods stores with its flavor and health profile, which fits in with an active lifestyle. Samples have been sent to sporting goods chain Dick’s, and several others are being targeted.\n\nThe company recently developed a new flavor for the jerky, orange ginger, and in addition to its 1.25 ounce packs is offering a .6 ounce jerky strip to hit a $2.99 price point, which will help it snap into beef jerky’s territory.\n\n--Drew Cherry\n\n---------------\n\nMonday, March 11, 6.58 a.m. EST\n\nLUF riding the healthy wave\n\nBanking on the growing trend for healthy foods, Thai surimi producer Lucky Union Foods (LUF) is introducing a Japanese style surimi tempura, which can be prepared in the oven instead of using pan and oil.\n\n“It’s a Japanese concept but it’s for our US consumers,” said Nattakhom Anantawuttikul, head of oversea marketing and sales at the company.\n\n“Simply put it into the oven -- the crispyness is the same,”he said.\n\nThe US market is the “number one” market for LUF, he told IntraFish.

So far this year, prices are in the 10.50 range, he said, but a better understanding of where the market is headed will be known in April, when sales activity picks up.\n\n“How high can prices go? asks Melanson. “When does the market say I got to go back to eating chicken rather than $25 scallops.”\n\nNorthern Wind is working hard to get its developing line of value-added products into US retail outlets.\n\nThe company has its Bon Cuisine line in Supervalu, Roundy's and other retail chains, but the push is on in 2013 to ramp up sales of the line, said Melanson.\n\nThe company recently hired George Kouri as its new COO and opened its third processing facility as part of its strategic growth initiatives, said Melanson.\n\n-- John Fiorillo\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nSunday, March 10, 12:20 PM EST\n\nFish out of water\n\nSunday, March 10, 12:09 p.m. EST\n\nReserve your sockeye early\n\nWhile US processor Orca Bay’s wild salmon purchases are three-quarters Alaskan fish, the company continues to build its business with Russian salmon.\n\n“The volume is growing every year,” President Ryan Mackey said.\n\nMackey noted that since most of the Russian product is beach-seined, the product quality is excellent. Wild salmon demand for both fillets and portions continues to climb in general, which is putting upward pressure on sockeye in particular.\n\n“It’s going to be an interesting year for sockeye,” Mackey said. “Last year, the farmed salmon prices sank, and sockeye prices held up, even with the pressure on the market.\"\n\nPrices will likely creep up, but “I don’t think it will be crazy,” Mackey said.\n\nWhat will happen is that sockeye buyers will need to commit earlier to secure product. And that means some risk and uncertainty.\n\n“The only way to get your spec cut is to take a leap of faith,” Mackey said.\n\n--Drew Cherry\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nSunday, March 10, 11:50 a.m. EST\n\nSymphony of Seafood contest in jeopardy?\n\nCould we have just seen the last Symphony of Seafood, the leading new products competition for Alaska seafood?\n\nThe Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation (AFDF), which runs the Symphony, is fighting for its financial life, Jim Browning said at the Boston seafood show on Sunday.\n\nThe symphony is in its second decade, and has served as a showcase for new value-added products that feature Alaska seafood.\n\nAFDF, which was started in 1978 as a research and development arm for the Alaska seafood industry, had long relied on federal funding through the Saltonstall-Kennedy program. Those funds largely disappeared in 2005, and AFDF has been living on state and other grants since then.\n\nThe group was the client for the Marine Stewarship Council (MSC) salmon certification until last year, when leading salmon companies puled out of the program, but it remains the client for Alaska’s Pacific cod fishery.\n\nBrowning is matter of fact about his group’s current predicament, but remains hopelful a way will be found for the group to continue its work, which ranges from species research to harvesting and processing research.\n\nBrowning is preparing a letter he will send to industry to ask for its further support. If no solution is found, Alaska’s largest new products competition will likely fade away.\n\n-- John Fiorillo\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nSunday, March 10, 11:35 a.m. EST\n\nCrab, to-go\n\nPhillips is busy rolling out several new products at the show this year, including it’s to-go line of products like crab cakes and crab cake minis.\n\n“The concept is that it’s actually from our restaurants,” Phillips Vice President of Marketing Caroline Tippett told IntraFish. “It looks like it’s a to-go box.”\n\nThe company also rolled out a culinary crab product, which they have been working on for a couple of years, Tippett said. It’s jumbo lump crab meat shaped from smaller crab pieces, which holds together well -- “it’s not going to break apart -- and is cheaper than market price.\n\nOther new items include an albacore tuna line for foodservice and new products to Phillips’ Seafood Skillets line.\n\n--Avani Nadkarni\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSunday, March 10, 11:30 a.m. EST\n\nFDA CO treatment ban could hurt Harbor\n\nHarbor Seafood has rolled out a new line of mahi mahi which is CO treated, and the company’s Greg Davis told IntraFish the possible Food and Drug Administration ban on the treatment would be a hindrance to industry.\n\n“There’s no health challenge, no allergen challenge,” Davis told IntraFish. “The issue is misuse, [people] trying to hide low-grade products.”\n\n--Avani Nadkarni\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nSunday, March 10, 11.20 a.m. EST\n\nSame crab, more meat\n\nNorth Carolina-based Shure Foods has a new solution for getting more meat out of crabs.\n\nThe company’s Kevin Hartigan said it’s “never been done before,” and Shure Foods’ cold structured crab allows chefs to have already-cooked crab meat rings, sheets and stuffed crab to cook with.\n\n“Traditional hand-picking gets 40 percent of the meat out of the crab, ours gets 90 percent,” Hartigan told IntraFish.\n\n-- Avani Nadkarni\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSunday, March 10, 11.18 a.m. EST\n\nShrimp: Retail going down\n\nJapanese Kowasho Foods-owned Geisha -- which operates as World Wide Food Products in the United States -- is having a hard time boosting sales in retail.\n\nThe company is therefore putting greater focus on foodservice in 2013, Richard Aro (pictured left), vice president at the company told IntraFish.\n\n“Consumers are not spending as much money in supermarkets,” he said.\n\nGeisha recently introduced pasteurised crab to its product line, and is hoping to expand it in restaurants all over the United States this year.\n\n“Hopefully that’s going to boost sales,” Aro said. Value-added products (VAP) on the other hand have lost “a lot” of market share, he said.\n\n-- Elisabeth Fischer\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSunday, March 10, 10.58 a.m. EST\n\nPescanova: ‘Business as usual'\n\nIntraFish was surprised to see struggling Pescanova’s massive booth at the Boston Seafood Show.\n\nWhen asked about their thoughts on the company’s future, one person at the stand, who didn’t want to be named, said it’s just “business as usual.”\n\n“We’re waiting for the banks to solve the situation,” IntraFish was told. “We have no other comments to make.”\n\n-- Elisabeth Fischer\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday, March 9, 6:30 p.m. EST\n\nFirst fish off the farm\n\nCooke Aquaculture will be in Boston with the first salmon produced at its new St. Marys Bay site.\n\nThe company on Thursday began harvesting the first batch of fish ever produced at the site.\n\nCooke planted about 700,000 fish in the pens at two sites in St. Marys in July 2011. Today, the fish weigh an average of 10 pounds, reports the Herald newspaper.\n\nThe 700,000 fish represent about seven million pounds of salmon to be harvested.\n\n-- John Fiorillo\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday, March 9, 7:20 a.m. EST\n\nBoston vs. Brussels\n\nWhen it comes to the world’s most recognized and largest seafood trade shows, the International Boston Seafood Show and the European Seafood Exposition in Brussels top the list.
