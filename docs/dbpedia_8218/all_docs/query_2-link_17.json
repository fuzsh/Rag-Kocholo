        "text": "Seafood Market Size 2024-2028\n\nThe Seafood Market size is projected to increase by USD 150.04 billion, at a CAGR of 13.55% between 2023 and 2028. The market is influenced by rising consumer awareness of healthy nutrition and the increasing popularity of seafood among the aging population. This demographic trend underscores a growing preference for nutritious and sustainable food options. Additionally, the prominence of land-based fish farming is gaining traction as a viable method to meet the rising demand for seafood while addressing environmental concerns associated with traditional fishing practices. These factors collectively shape the seafood market, driving innovation and sustainability efforts across the industry. As consumer preferences evolve towards healthier eating habits and sustainable food sources, the seafood market continues to adapt, offering diverse products and solutions to meet the needs of a discerning consumer base.\n\nMarket Overview\n\nThe Market shows an accelerated CAGR during the forecast period.\n\nTo get additional information about the market, Download Free Sample\n\nMarket Dynamics\n\nThe industry is evolving with a focus on protein-rich, nutritious sources like shrimps, salmon, tuna, cod, and tilapia. As consumer demand for sustainable and ethical seafood grows, aquaculture techniques and certifications from organizations like the Aquaculture Stewardship Council and Marine Stewardship Council play a crucial role. Culinary experimentation and product innovation drive the market, exploring 3D printing technology for personalized seafood products. Alternative protein sources and seafood substitutes cater to diverse dietary preferences while addressing environmental impacts and ethical concerns. Seafood's lean protein content, rich in minerals, supports a balanced diet and is valued in tourism, hospitality, and culinary applications worldwide. With a focus on texture, flavor, and appearance, value-added fish products continue to meet evolving consumer expectations for quality and sustainability in the market.\n\nKey Market Drivers\n\nThe increasing prominence of land-based fish farming is notably driving the market growth. Another driver that can positively influence the growth of the global market is the increasing prominence of land-based aquaculture. Even though it is more expensive than marine aquaculture, it causes fewer environmental problems than the ones associated with sea cage aquaculture. The demand for aquaculture in the global market is increasing and is expected to surpass the demand for commercial fishing during the forecast period. Aquaculture is the fastest-growing global food production process. It has overshadowed all other food-sourcing methods such as traditional agricultural practices and wild fish harvesting. Thus, the increasing prominence of land-based fish farming is expected to drive market growth and trends during the forecast period.\n\nMajor Market Trends\n\nExtensive scope through organized retailing is a major market trends. The retail chain is the major distribution partner for fresh fish and seafood, which accounts for the highest sales. The current shift in the retail industry toward an organized format from the traditional format has accelerated the growth of the retail industry. Convenience and value have become important for consumers because of their hectic lifestyles and work schedules. Organized retailers provide a large number of products under the same roof, which enables consumers to save time and allows them a variety of choices.\n\nFurther increasing the importance of organized retailers for vendors.

Thus, the extensive scope of organized retailing is expected to positively affect the growth of the global market during the forecast period.\n\nSignificant Market Challenge\n\nThe growing popularity of vegan seafood is a significant challenge hindering market growth. The rising consumer awareness about the health benefits of vegan diets has led to an increasing number of people adopting vegan lifestyles. Vegan diets provide more fibre, antioxidants, and beneficial plant compounds. They are also rich in potassium, magnesium, folate, and vitamins A, C, and E. Vegan diets help improve kidney function and lower blood sugar levels. They also help in lowering the risk of heart disease significantly. Such health benefits of vegan diets have led people to opt for palatable fish substitutes.\n\nFurthermore, the rising demand for plant-based fish products in the region has attracted large international companies to expand their product offerings in the region. Hence, the growing popularity of vegan is expected to hamper the growth of the global market during the forecast period.\n\nMarket Segmentation by Distribution Channel\n\nThe offline distribution channel generates revenue from the sales of products through hypermarkets, supermarkets, clubhouse stores, department stores, and wet/open markets retailers. Revenue generation has been declining in the offline segment as consumers are gradually shifting to online shopping. Companies can increase their sales and cater to each consumer category through expansions in geographies such as APAC and MEA. With the growth of retail channels in cities and regions, customers have become familiar with different variants. This is expected to increase sales during the forecast period. Although the offline segment is losing its global market share and popularity to the online segment, innovative marketing strategies will propel sales through the offline channel at a steady rate, thereby driving the global market during the forecast period.\n\nMarket Segmentation by Type\n\nThe market share growth by the fish segment will be significant during the forecast period. The expansion of fish as a high-protein meat substitute is responsible for the growth of the global market.\n\nThe fish segment was the largest and was valued at USD 94.09 billion in 2018\n\nFor a detailed summary of the market segments Download Free Samples\n\nIn addition, the number of meat eaters is increasing, and people are becoming more aware of the health advantages of eating fish, as fish is filled with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins such as D and B2 (riboflavin).

Thus, fish is highly preferred among other types, which, in turn, is expected to drive the growth of the fish segment, thereby driving the global market during the forecast period.\n\nMarket Segmentation by Regions\n\nAPAC is estimated to contribute 38% to the growth of the global market during the forecast period\n\nGet a glance at the market share of various regions Download the Free Sample\n\nTechnavio’s analysts have elaborately explained the regional market growth and market trends and analysis that shape the market during the forecast period.
