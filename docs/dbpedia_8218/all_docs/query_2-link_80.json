        "text": "The North America seafood market is expected to reach US$ 29,629.37 million by 2027 from US$ 22,526.38 million in 2019; it is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 3.6% during 2020–2027.\n\nAs per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), seafood encompasses all commercially obtained saltwater and freshwater fish, molluscan shellfish, and crustaceans. The demand for seafood is anticipated to witness a dramatic growth across North America owing to its health benefits. Rising per capita consumption accompanied by the demand from U.S and Canada for imported seafood products is considered to strengthen the market further. The demand for seafood products across specialty restaurants is growing at a robust pace in recent times. A large population of consumers prefers to eat seafood over other cuisines, and this is major factor that propels the market expansion. Moreover, coastal regions are implementing concerted efforts to develop advanced supply chains for the export and supply of seafood. Also, the growth of the seafood market highly depends on the ease of procuring seafood from coastal regions. Furthermore, the improvement in economic condition and progression in disposable income levels also helped the market growth. Mexico is witnessing strong urbanization trend and it resulted in the increase in disposable income among the middle-income groups, subsequently adding to the middle-class population. The medium as well as high-income consumers in urban areas are changing their consumption trend from essential to premium food products. This trend favors seafood companies and suppliers to improve their product and service line in the seafood segment.\n\nThe U.S contributed to the largest share in the North America seafood market. The United States is one of the significant countries dominating the seafood market in North America. The U.S. is the primary market for seafood in North America, followed by Canada. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), fishing and seafood consumption in the U.S increased in 2017, with landings and value of U.S. fisheries continuing a significant, positive trend. In 2018, on average, Americans consumed 16.1 pounds of seafood, as per the 'Fisheries of the United States' report released by NOAA. Factors such as increased import of edible seafood, high per capita consumption, robust penetration of organized retail and foodservice industry, growing consumer expenditure on several seafood dishes like sushi are some of the significant factors that fuel the growth of the market.\n\nNorth America Seafood Market\n\nMarket Insights\n\nHealth Benefits Associated With Seafood Attracts Health Conscious Consumers\n\nSeafood provides numerous health benefits to consumers. This is the primary factor that drives seafood consumption among consumers. Health consciousness among consumers is increasing tremendously, which further helps in market expansion. Seafood is a high-protein food, which is low in calories, total fat, and saturated fat. It consists of enough of the essential amino acids to ensure healthy growth and optimal fetal development. A 3-ounce serving of most shellfish and fish provides more than 30-40% of the average daily recommended amount of protein. The protein in seafood is more comfortable to digest as seafood has less connective tissue than red meats and poultry. Seafood is rich in vitamins and minerals and offers a wide array of health advantages to the consumer. For instance, recent studies have shown that seafood consumption can reduce the risk of heart attack, obesity, stroke, and hypertension. Seafood also provides vital nutrients for developing infants and children. Further, seafood is commonly considered a low-calorie protein source. Low-fat species of fish, such as flounder, cod, and sole, contain less than 100 calories per 3-ounce cooked portion. Fattier fish such as salmon, mackerel, and herring have about 200 calories per serving. Moreover, fish is packed with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins such as B2 (riboflavin) and D. These indispensable components keep the heart and brain healthy, attracting consumer traction. Two omega-3 fatty acids present in fish are DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid). Scientific studies show that the marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of heart disease and contribute to vision and brain development in infants. The American Heart Association advises 1000 milligrams of EPA/DHA per day for patients with coronary heart disease and two oily fish meals per week for patients without heart disease. The human body doesn't produce omega-3 fatty acids in needed amounts, so they must be consumed through the diet. Salmon, sardines, trout, herring, canned mackerel, canned light tuna, and oysters contain a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids help to maintain a healthy heart by reducing blood pressure and reducing the risk of sudden death, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attack, and strokes. Also, fish contains an ample amount of phosphorus and calcium and a great source of minerals, such as zinc, iodine, iron, magnesium, and potassium.\n\nType Market Insights\n\nThe North America seafood market is segmented on the basis of type into fish, crustaceans, mollusca and others.

Consumers are heavily employing seafood such as tuna, salmon, and many others to prepare pasta, burgers, salads, tartar sauce, and other dishes that are consumed as a part of the daily diet.
