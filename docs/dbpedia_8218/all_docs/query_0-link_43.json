        "text": "The Global Aquaculture Alliance was founded by shrimp farmers and aquafeed and seafood companies responding to criticism about mangrove deforestation (Pictured: Susan and George Chamberlain outside the first professional GAA office in St. Louis, Mo., USA. The original office was the Chamberlains' home.)\n\nPublished “Guiding Principles for Responsible Aquaculture” and “Mangrove Code of Practice”\n\nAlso: Published the first issue of Global Aquaculture Advocate magazine as an eight-page black-and-white newsletter; a full-color magazine would follow in 1999 and continue bimonthly until 2015 when it would shift online\n\nThe qualitative predecessor to Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) standards, “Codes of Practice for Responsible Shrimp Farming,” is published\n\nThe first GSOL (Global Shrimp Outlook for Leadership) conference – which would be rebranded as GOAL (Global Outlook for Aquaculture Leadership) in 2008 – is held in Singapore\n\nBAP certification standards for shrimp farms are finalized; auditors were trained in 2003 and the first-ever shrimp farm earns BAP certification (Belize) in 2004\n\nBAP is endorsed by retail leader Walmart and Darden Restaurants, operator of the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain\n\nGAA offices are opened in Florida, Washington and New Hampshire, but ultimately consolidated in Portsmouth, N.H., USA (Pictured: The current GSA office, which opened in 2018)\n\nThe Standards Oversight Committee is established (Pictured: The SOC at the 2015 SOC meeting in Vancouver)\n\nGAA funds the formation of the Responsible Aquaculture Foundation (now The Center for Responsible Seafood, or TCRS), a charitable organization dedicated to research, education and collaboration\n\niBAP, a precursor to full BAP certification, is launched\n\nAlso: BAP-certified processing plants are officially prohibited from outsourcing shrimp processing work to third-party entities to combat labor abuse\n\nBAP became the first third-party aquaculture certification program to be benchmarked by the Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative (GSSI)\n\nAlso: BAP became the first program to achieve 3Gs status (GFSI, the Global Food Safety Initiative, GSSI and GSCP, the Global Social Compliance Program)"
