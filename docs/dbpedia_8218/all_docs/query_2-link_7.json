        "text": "SFP’s partnerships are vital to our ongoing mission of building a more sustainable global seafood industry.\n\nOur partners share our interest in long-term seafood sustainability and are committed to the continuous improvement of fisheries and fish farms.\n\nSFP’s partners actively drive change in fisheries and aquaculture by using their leverage to mobilize improvements within their existing supply chains.\n\nThis is different from programs by other NGOs that promote sustainability by asking companies to just buy certified and green-rated products, or those from existing fishery or aquaculture improvement projects.\n\nInstead, our partners require their supply chains – from suppliers down to fishers and fish farmers – to both initiate and participate in fishery and aquaculture improvement projects (FIPs and AIPs). They also ask their suppliers to join Supply Chain Roundtables (SRs) and other pre-competitive efforts to amplify change across sectors, countries, and regions, and to be leaders in improving fisheries globally.\n\nJoin Us\n\nSFP provides its partners with resources to support their commitments. These include our proprietary Seafood Metrics system to assess supply chain risks and track sustainability progress, as well as partner-only briefings, webinars, forums, and opportunities to network with industry thought leaders.\n\nIn addition to partner-only options, SFP also has a suite of innovative tools and services that are open to all companies. We invite all industry leaders who share our concerns about long-term seafood sustainability to work with us on seafood sustainability, to demonstrate your commitment to the continuous improvement of the fisheries and fish farms used to source your products."
