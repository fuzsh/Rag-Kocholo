We do this to protect and conserve the environment we have dedicated our lives to but also to strengthen the company’s long-term sustainability and trajectory.\n\nWe are nothing without fish and so we have chartered the following routes:\n\nWe believe and use the science-based management of all the marine resources we harvest making our fish stocks sustainable for future generations.\n\nThe Sea Harvest Corporation realised the same goes for the company ethos. We got the likes of WWF-SA, Bird Life South Africa, and other industry players all on board to form The Responsible Fishing Alliance, a body that promotes and monitors sustainable fishing practices.\n\nEvery year, our commitment to Sustainability swells with new projects across all sectors that contribute to protecting our environment. It’s not just about business but community participation."
