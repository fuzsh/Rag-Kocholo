        "text": "Personally I have not dealt directly with the Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) standard but, as seafood commodities are over 90% of globally traded foodstuffs and BAP is GFSI benchmarked, I felt it prudent to bring it up on IFSQN. Perhaps this will foster a forum that IFSQN has done extraordinarily well with the other food safety standards and best practices ideas.\n\nLast year I was at an aquaculture conference in the US. It was addressing food aquaculture developments in the Americas but was indeed an international crowd. Ranging in all species, on all continents, off-shore/marine and land-based development, feed, nutrition, water quality, veterinary, environmental, marketing, food safety, regulatory, you name it; both technical and general as well as addressing the global impact.\n\nSome details on where aquaculture food is and where it is heading:\n\nWith this growth in aquaculture food production, there has been a continued concern with its food safety (anti-biotic, growth hormone, chemical), processing, environmental and social impact. For a GSFI benchmark standard, SQF has recently attempted to capture these with add-ons or \"modules\". However, strictly for aquaculture, in 1997, executives from the shrimp industry formed Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA) in response to growing anti-aquaculture pressure. In 2003, it established a code for Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) and in 2010 it was GFSI benchmarked. As feed was a concern (anti-biotic, growth hormone, chemical use) in 2006, standards for aquaculture feed mills and extend coverage to fish. It is now perceived as a sustainability Eco-label standard covering environmental as well as food safety and social labor concerns.\n\nI know, social labor concerns are not a food safety issue but are a food traceability concern. If you caught The Guardian article exposing human trafficking in the Thai shrimp industry this year, it did not only apply to the aquaculture shrimp possessors but to the sourcing of their feed in the shrimp supply chain. Large retailers selling Thai shrimp were raked over the coals on this issue.\n\nIn the last FAO Fisheries & Aquaculture publication, wild captured seafood is maintaining and even level and seemed to have reached its limitations, however, aquaculture production has recently eclipsed wild captured seafood harvest levels. In the US and Canada, with the expected exponential global growth in aquaculture, the majority of top food retailers are now only accepting aquaculture products that are certified. I have personally witnessed tremendous growth in BAP certification in the Americas alone in the last 3 years. In 2013 BAP identifies a 31% increase in the number of facilities certified, a 29 per cent increase in the volume of product originating from BAP-certified processing plants and an impressive 57 per cent increase in the volume of product originating from BAP-certified farms; no doubt these numbers have increased in 2014. With the development of RAS (Recirculating Aquaculture Systems), one is now seeing vertically integrated aquaculture processors in continental interiors entirely independent of oceans, lakes and streams. In addition, this year National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported about the completion of formal study, led by scientists at National Ocean Service’s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS), evaluated the environmental effects of finfish aquaculture, including interactions with water quality, benthic habitats, and marine life across various farming practices and habitat types. They concluded that US coastal ocean aquaculture can be environmentally sustainable; a sanction, if you will, for the aquaculture industry.\n\nBAP (Best Aquaculture Practices) is a unique standard promoted as an audit covering “Community, Environment, Animal Welfare, Food Safety and Traceability”. BAP is strictly an aquaculture Food Safety, Sustainability and Sourcing audit standard.\n\nA brief histoy:\n\n1997, executives from the shrimp industry formed Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA) in response to growing anti-aquaculture pressure.\n\n2003, established a code for Best Aquaculture Practices.\n\n2006, standards for aquaculture feed mills and extend coverage to fish.\n\n2010, seafood processing plant standards were benchmarked against GFSI Guidance Document Fifth Edition.\n\n2013, now perceived as a sustainability Eco-label standard covering environmental as well as food safety and social labor concerns.\n\nWith the concern of Sustainability Certifications, Traceability & product Chain-of-Custody Sustainability/Sourcing standard are battling it out for dominance but are NOT concerned with food safety as a GFSI benchmark. However BAP is both.\n\nAs of mid-2013, who wants BAP audits?\n\n2013 Top US & Canadian Retail Chains Selling Food & Groceries\n\nWal-Mart & Sam's Club\n\nKroger\n\nCostco\n\nTarget\n\nSafeway\n\nSupervalu Inc.\n\nPublix Super Markets, Inc.\n\nRoyal Ahold USA\n\nDelhaize\n\n(Food Lion, Hannaford, Sweetbay)\n\nH-E-B\n\nSobeys\n\nMeijer\n\nWakefern Food Corp\n\n(ShopRite, PriceRite)\n\nMetro\n\nOther Retail Chains Selling Food & Groceries\n\nSysco\n\nHigh Liner Foods Inc\n\n(Viking/Fisher Boy, Icelandic Seafood, FPI)\n\nDarden\n\nAsda\n\nBJ's Wholesale Club\n\nChicken of the Sea\n\n(Thai Union Group)\n\nEastern Fish Company\n\nEmpress International\n\nExpack International\n\nGorton’s\n\nH&N Seafood\n\nLong John Silver’s\n\nMazetta Company\n\nNational Fish & Seafood Co.\n\nPescanova USA\n\nRed Chamber\n\nRich Products Corporation\n\nSodexo\n\nTampa Bay Fisheries\n\nWegman’s\n\nWinn-Dixie\n\nWhole Foods\n\nTrader Joe’s\n\nIt is clear BAP certification has already become widely mandated. If there are any members out there dealing with or handling BAP audits it would be great to hear your comments, concerns and frustrations."
