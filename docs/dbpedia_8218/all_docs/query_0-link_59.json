Pescetarianism means being vegetarian while still consuming seafood in the diet and does not include any meat such as pork, beef, poultry, and others. There has been a drastic shift in consumers’ preference towards healthy diet pattern, as meat and meat products often include harmful chemicals and pesticides. Thus, this factor has surged the demand for seafood among the consumers over the coming years. Furthermore, growing consumer awareness related to the living conditions of the cattle in farms has further changed the preference of non-vegetarians to pescetarianism; thus fuelling the growth of the seafood market.\n\nSome other factors surging the growth of the market include innovations and variations in seafood dishes and rising demand for fat-free proteinaceous food around the world.

These factors are propelling the growth of the seafood market.
