Shareholders of Pescanova SA , the Spanish fishing company thatâ€™s restructuring more than 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) of previously undisclosed debt, are asking creditors to accept losses of as much as 73 percent, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Negotiations with creditors cover a range of losses from 63 percent to 73 percent, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. A consortium chosen by Pescanova to restructure the company, including shareholders Spanish brewer Damm SA and Luxempart SA as well as KKR & Co. and Ergon Capital Partners SA, asked lenders in December to accept losses of as much as 90 percent.
