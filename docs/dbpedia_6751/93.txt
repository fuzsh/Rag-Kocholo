‘In the Name of the Father’ shows unusual relationships within a Brazilian family. It was directed by Thiago Venco.

It is interesting that on the Internet you can find information that it was directed by Júlio Maria Pessoa, which implies that it is probably the same person. The film does not provide a particularly significant experience because it was obviously made with modest equipment, but it is interesting to watch.

The film is part of the collection ‘Straight Men & the Men Who Love Them’ published in 2005, which explores the relationship between gay and straight people and consists of seven short films that we will try to find and present.

The collection includes Espacio Dos (Spain) In the Name of the Father (Brazil), My Straight Boyfriend (US), Truth or Consequences (Brazil), Coffee Date (US), Popcorn & Coke (UK), and Uninhibited.
