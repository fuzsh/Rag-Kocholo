        "text": "The film IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER tells the story of Irish teenager Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) who goes to London in the 1960’s to live in a hippie commune to enjoy free love and dope. He sees his father as lacking the courage to rise above his working class station. While Gerry visits his family in Belfast, the police raid the commune and take members in for questioning about a bombing. His friend names Gerry as the leader, and, after days of interrogation, Gerry signs a false confession. When his father comes to London to get an attorney for his son, he is arrested, too. Both receive life sentences. A young attorney, Ms. Pierce, takes an interest in them, and, when she discovers suppressed evidence, she moves to have the case re-tried. During the fifteen years Gerry and his father share a cell, Gerry learns how strong his father’s faith is.\n\nThis is an absorbing, dramatic presentation about an innocent man’s struggle to make sense of a seemingly unjust system. Although the film makes a strong statement about the roots of prejudice, the ultimate triumph of justice and the strength of a quiet faith, the dialogue is filled with obscenity and profanity, the interrogation is intense and physical abuse and male nudity is shown. Unfortunately, it has too many negative aspects in telling a positive story."
