        "text": "Travel\n\nPhoto books about travel are some of our favorites to name. The places you go can so easily supply you with inspiration, from incorporating a phrase in the local language (think: \"Aloha\") to simply calling a spade a spade by naming it after the city. The cover title can go a long way to prime your reader for the adventure that lies inside.\n\nThought-starter: What made this trip unique? Was it the modes of transportation, your first time with a passport, the lack of a solid plan? Think through what made it most memorable to encapsulate that quality in a few words.\n\nTravel Photo Album Title Ideas\n\nThe Road Best Traveled\n\nBy the Seaside\n\nA Summer Spent Seaside\n\nAdventures With Mia\n\nThe Wild Places\n\nWherever We Go\n\nOn the Road\n\nSee the World\n\nLessons From a Passport\n\nA Weekend in Colorado\n\nAlong the Wayâ¦\n\nHere & There\n\nFavorite Adventures\n\nMountain Majesty\n\nWithout a Map\n\n(Last Name) Family Vacation 2024\n\nOur Iceland Honeymoon\n\nAdventure, Found\n\nIn the Sun\n\nFamily\n\nWe see these albums ranging from annual recaps of immediate family members to album titles for bonding moments with extended family or friends. An easy and common route for photo book title ideas involves any variation of your family's last name and the year(s) pictured within. But for a more expressive cover, we recommend going a step further to convey the binding connection that your book represents!\n\nThought-starter: What relationships are featured throughout your book? Does it cover a broad span of time (e.g., a generation, a decade) or does it hold smaller, everyday moments that defined a single season? Family albums might be among the ones pulled out and paged through the most, so choose a title that reflects that same timelessness.\n\nFamily Photo Album Title Ideas\n\nBetter Together\n\nGenerations\n\nDays Together\n\nMoment By Moment\n\nGather Together\n\nHome is with you\n\nFamily is Forever\n\nDays at Home\n\nTogether as Family\n\nA Love Like Ours\n\nThe (Last Name) Family\n\n2024 with the Wolfes\n\nThis Is Us\n\nDays with Dad\n\nMoments with Mom\n\nCelebrating Sisterhood\n\nSiblings & Forever Friends\n\nMy Brother and Me\n\nTwo of a Kind (great for siblings)\n\nTies That Bind\n\nAdventures with (Pet Name)\n\nWedding\n\nYour wedding album is one that'll bring joy (and maybe a tear to your eye!) for decades to come. There are so many defining qualities of a relationship and all that goes into a wedding that it can be hard to summarize it in just a few words. That's why we tend to lean toward traditional, enduring phrases that signify the start of something equal parts strong and sentimental.\n\nThought-starter: This is a perfect place to incorporate a key phrase from your vows, or maybe even the title of the song played during your first dance. While the ideas below skew more conventional, there are many other ways to customize yours to feel more abstract or uniquely you.\n\nWedding Album Title Ideas\n\nOn This Day\n\nTo Have and to Hold\n\nWhere We Begin\n\nOur Best Day\n\nEstablished 2021\n\nFrom This Day Forward\n\nBound to Be\n\n(First Name) & (First Name)\n\n(First Name) & (First Name) (Last Name)\n\nThe Story of Us\n\nYou and I\n\nWe Do\n\nBeginning Our Forever\n\nThe (Last Names) â Est. 2023\n\nOur Love\n\nFrom Now Until Forever\n\nAnniversary\n\nAnniversary photo albums are a timepiece through which we can admire all that a couple has endured, created, and explored together. It could be after one year of marriage, or maybe 50, but what these all have in common is a retrospective and appreciative lens to view their experiences. That's why we suggest a title evoking reflection and a special connection.\n\nThought-starter: What type of photos will compose this book â a wide-ranging chronological timeline or a recap of recent years? One simple way to give the album a personalized feel with an all-encompassing title is to include the number of years celebrated together.\n\nAnniversary Photo Book Title Ideas\n\nOur Time Together\n\nLooking Back on Love\n\nTen Years Together\n\nOur Story So Far\n\nA Love Like Ours\n\nGrowing Old\n\nOver the Years\n\nSide by Side\n\nJust the Two of Us\n\nP.S. I love you\n\nA Love Story\n\nThrough the Years\n\nLove, Our Legacy\n\nOur First Five Years\n\nTo Infinity...\n\nSo Far\n\nBaby\n\nPhotos of our little ones are never hard to come by â in fact, they fill most parents' camera rolls. But finding a perfect title for your baby's photo album may be more of a task. There are so many stories and family structures a child may be brought into, so use yours as a springboard for ideation!\n\nThought-starter: Is this baby number one â or two or three? Is adoption part of your parenting journey? It's these key details that lend themselves to a title most fitting for your family.\n\nBaby Photo Book Title Ideas\n\nWhen We Met You\n\nYour First Years\n\nWelcome to the World\n\nBaby Luca (First Name)\n\nOur Little to Love\n\nWhen We Became Three\n\nBecoming a Big Brother\n\nFrom Three to Four\n\nA Year of Firsts\n\nOur Bundle of Joy\n\nWorth the Wait\n\nOur Adoption Story\n\nThe Greatest Gift\n\nWelcome Home\n\nYear-in-Review and Beyond\n\nWe might be biased, but photo books are the easiest and most tangible way to recollect a period of time and experiences shared. Whether it's on an annual basis or whenever-you-can basis, your titles can be both descriptive and even serial in nature.\n\nThought-starter: Think through the time frame your album covers â is it a single season, a year, or a broader assortment? Base the book's name around that period to give readers an idea of the contents inside.\n\nMemory Book Title Ideas\n\nDays Well Spent\n\nA Year to Remember\n\nOur Best Times Together\n\nRemember When\n\nLittle Joys in Life\n\nA Trip Around the Sun\n\n2023: Our Year in Review\n\nA Year for the Books\n\nEasy Living\n\nSimplicity in Springtime\n\nIn Bloom\n\nA Look Back\n\nCelebrating the Everyday\n\nTwo Thousand Twenty\n\nBest of Times\n\nMaking the Most of It\n\nA New Chapter\n\nFavorite Moments of (Year)"
