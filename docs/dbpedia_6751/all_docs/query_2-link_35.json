        "text": "The Irish American Heritage Museum hosts Film Club: In the Name of the Father on Monday, April 24 at 6:00 PM.\n\nIn the Name of the Father is a 1993 biographical crime drama co-written and directed by Jim Sheridan. Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Gerry Conlon, an unemployed young Irishman who gets by as a petty thief in Belfast in the 1970s. When local IRA leaders get fed up with him, he flees to England and meets up with his friend Paul Hill (John Lynch). The friends get kicked out of their communal digs and are forced to sleep in a park on the same night that the IRA bombs a nearby pub. Gerry returns to Belfast, but is arrested as the prime suspect in the bombing and imprisoned, where he spends 15 years trying to clear his name."
