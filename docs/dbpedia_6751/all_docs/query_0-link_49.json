        "text": "Last week I featured Steve Martin’s traditional white house from Father of the Bride, so today I thought it would be fun to take a look at how it changed for the sequel, Father of the Bride Part II.\n\nIn this movie, the camera spent more time lavishing attention on the house and giving us a better look into some of the rooms, like the kitchen.\n\nOh, and the baby’s nursery was a wonderful addition — literally.\n\nTake a look!\n\nThe House from “Father of the Bride Part II”\n\nIn the movie the Banks live at 24 Maple Drive in San Marino.\n\nThe real house is located at 843 South El Molino Avenue in Pasadena.\n\nAccording to Zillow, it last sold for $950,000 in 1999. It’s reportedly worth $3 million today.\n\nAnnie and her mom are both hugely pregnant in the sequel.\n\nIn one scene they both looked like they had beach balls under their shirts and Steve Martin narrates that they were only in their second trimester. Yikes. Those are big babies!\n\nNina’s (Diane Keaton’s) pregnancy was a little hard to believe.\n\nShe was 50 at the time and reportedly refused to play pregnant after reading the screenplay. She thought it was a little too ridiculous.\n\nNancy Meyers (who co-wrote the script with Charles Shyer) and Keaton’s co-stars had to talk her into it.\n\nThe Dining Room:\n\nGeorge & Nina’s Bedroom:\n\nThe Kitchen:\n\nWe didn’t get to see nearly enough of the kitchen in the original film.\n\nMore time was spent in it this time around, and I was able to get all sorts of angles.\n\nI noticed the main thing that changed from the last movie to this one is the tile backsplash. It’s now neutral and beige.\n\nRemember how it looked before?\n\nThis is the only (blurry) shot I could get of the back stairs off the kitchen,\n\nbut I was excited to catch a glimpse of it:\n\nFrom what I’ve heard, the interiors were all sets built on a\n\nseparate soundstage. These aren’t the rooms inside the real house.\n\nGeorge says his house is the “Leave It to Beaver house that everybody wants.” Truth!\n\nHere they are, saying a weepy farewell to “this run-down old shack,” as George calls it.\n\nThey pan up, the music soars, and the place looks as gorgeous as ever. There’s even a rainbow!\n\nThen he walks back by it a few days later and sees this:\n\nGeorge stops the wrecking ball and pays to get his house back.\n\nThey move back in and start building an addition for the baby’s room.\n\nI’m not sure why they were so short on space that they needed an entirely new wing for one little baby (couldn’t they use Annie’s old room?), but let’s just go with it.\n\nFranck (Martin Short) greets George when he walks in the door and says the nursery is ready for the Big Reveal:\n\nThe set design on these two films is pretty impressive when you consider this was the early 1990s (the first movie premiered in 1991 and the second in 1995).\n\nThe movie was actually filmed at two houses.\n\nThe other one, located at 500 N. Almansor Street in Alhambra, was used for some of the scenes:"
