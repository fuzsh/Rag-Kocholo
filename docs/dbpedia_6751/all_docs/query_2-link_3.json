As his father, Patrick, prepares to be ordained a deacon, the family must come to terms with what could be Patrick's complicity in the cover-up of these heinous crimes. Meanwhile, Gabriel desires most to come out and be his authentic self along with the significant other he's kept hidden from his family."
