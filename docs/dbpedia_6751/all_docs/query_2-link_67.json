        "text": "No, it's not in the Meet the Parents film series. As per Wikipedia, it is\n\nloosely based on [actor Sebastian Maniscalco]'s life and his relationship with his father, played by Robert De Niro.\n\nThe only similarities, as you've noted, are the French title and the presence of De Niro as a father figure.\n\nTo explain why this may be the case, there is a known phenomenon - especially with comedy movies - which TV Tropes calls Translation Matchmaking, in which a film is renamed for a specific market in order to suggest a non-existent connection with a previous film. Airplane was extremely prone to this, with subsequent films starring Leslie Nielsen or created by ZAZ often being retitled in foreign countries to make the Airplane connection obvious.\n\nI cannot prove it, but my suspicion is that About My Father's French title is an example of this phenomenon, and was chosen to imply a connection with De Niro's earlier film that isn't actually there."
