        "text": "Call Me By Your Name is a 2017 coming-of-age drama exploring themes of love, desire, and identity. I strongly believe the film’s profound depiction of familial love, particularly through Elio’s father’s monologue is why you should watch it. Also, Elio’s mother is nothing but a sweetheart!\n\nWhat captivated me was the speech / monologue delivered by Mr. Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) near the end of the film offers a touching lesson in fatherly love, acceptance, and wisdom.\n\nThe Monologue\n\nElio’s heartbreak over his brief but intense relationship with Oliver becomes too much to bear. He is torn about his love for Oliver. Elio’s father, sensing his son’s pain and sadness, sits down with him and delivers a heartfelt monologue, resonating with audience.\n\nThe Lesson in Acceptance & Fatherly Love\n\nMr. Perlman addresses Elio’s inner turmoil. He never judges!\n\nThe essence of his speech lies in his acceptance of his son’s emotions. Mr. Perlman validates Elio’s emotions. He acknowledges the relationship :\n\n“You had a beautiful friendship. Maybe even more than a friendship.\n\nThis acknowledgement is life giving. Every child wants to be loved and give love to. Every child wants acceptance.\n\nHe reminds Elio that the intensity of his emotions, even if painful, is a beautiful part of life.\n\nHe says,\n\n“If there is pain, nurse it.\n\n“We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new.”\n\nWe often see pain as trouble or negatively. Any pain for that matter, we try to avoid. Pain is real. Pain is what makes life beautiful. Pain gives us meaning!\n\nMy Favorite Line\n\nWhat resonates most with me is this :\n\nHow you live your life is your business, just remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once.\n\nAnd before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it.\n\nRight now, there’s sorrow, pain. Don’t kill it and with it the joy you’ve felt.”\n\nBrutal Honesty! How I wish someone told me this! Not that I didn’t discover it on my own, but how nice would it have been!\n\nHow I live my life is my own business. So true. Life makes more sense when you stop pleasing everyone or living for others. Live for you. Experience things on your own. Don’t care who judges you!\n\nWords like this for sure can be the cure to many chronic pain & mental illnesses. Maybe, who knows? Words do matter!\n\nAny parent who is brave and honest enough to tell you all this are the best parents ever! “ Is it better to speak or to die?”\n\nOur bodies may grow old and falter but what’s important is we experience life, joy, sorrow, pain and never run from it.\n\nWhat Parents Can Learn : The Importance of Open Communication\n\nThis speech serves as a powerful reminder to parents. Let your child experience their emotions. Their emotions are valid. Let them make mistakes and find their path! Teach them to love unconditionally!\n\nWhat I love is open communication. An honest relationship! Imagine parents so open minded like Elio’s parents. They discuss literature, music, and art and life itself.\n\nParents must know : open dialogue strengthens bond with their children and they will not hesitate to seek advise or guidance from you! Even when they are unsure!"
