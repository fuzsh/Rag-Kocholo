While blessings contain roots in ancient history, they still serve a very purposeful role in our world and even in your life. In biblical times, there was nothing more monumental than receiving a blessing from your father, so it’s worth taking a closer look at the Blessing. This resource is designed to help us all understand the power of a Blessing and how it can radically transform us. Whether you have or have not received or given a blessing before, there’s something here for you. When used together, the movie and this Discussion Guide can help you personally experience the power of a Blessing.\n\nDownload Guide (PDF)\n\nDiscussion Guide\n\nFathers play an oversized role in our lives. In fact, it’s impossible to truly understand the meaning of life and the truth of Christianity without understanding that the center of the whole story of reality is one of eternal love and glory between a Father and His only Son Jesus Christ. That’s why it’s no coincidence that each one of us has a story regarding our father, and it is often one of great joy or unfortunate pain. This resource will guide you through the various themes, elements, and important topics from the film. These questions will prompt personal reflection and discussion with your family and friends and provide application to help you better understand your own father story and see God as your perfect Father.\n\nDownload Guide (PDF)"
