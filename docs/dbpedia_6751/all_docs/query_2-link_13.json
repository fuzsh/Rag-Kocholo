At Ardmore studios outside Dublin, Daniel Day-Lewis, playing Gerry Conlon, eats his final supper surrounded by family.\n\nTucked in a corner, not far from backdrops depicting Belfast, is a jail cell. Empty and unfinished, painted a distinctly unpleasant pink and brown, the set punctures any sense of domestic well-being enacted just a few feet away.\n\nIn the next scene of \"In the Name of the Father,\" Jim Sheridan's film account of the ordeal of the so-called Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon is arrested on charges of terrorism that will lead to a life sentence for a crime he didn't commit. Then his father, Guiseppe Conlon (played by Pete Postlethwaite), will travel to England, despite being ill with tuberculosis, to help him find a lawyer. Guiseppe, too, will be accused of complicity in terrorism and be incarcerated in the same jail as his son. He will die in prison, protesting his innocence until the last.\n\n\"In the Name of the Father,\" to be released by Universal in December, is an attempt by all concerned to grapple with one of the murkier moments in recent British history.\n\n\"This is a father-son story about the transition of one man from lost youth into a strong character,\" says the director. \"Along the way he learns that his father, who he thought was a mundane, boring, pathetic character, was probably the strongest human being he ever met.\n\n\"The film's title,\" Mr. Sheridan continues, \"is a cry, like 'in the name of God.' It's the start of a prayer. More than anything, this film is being made in the name of Guiseppe Conlon, the ultimate victim.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
