        "text": "John David is the oldest child and is following in the footsteps of his father with notable acting credits to his name. While he was always interested in an acting career (he made a cameo alongside his dad in 1992’s Malcolm X when director Spike Lee needed a kid at the last minute), football was also a prominent part of his life for a long time. In fact, he was once signed to the St. Louis Rams on their practice squad for two seasons. The burgeoning actor would then go on to have professional stints in the United Football League with the Rhein Fire (2007) and Sacramento Mountains (2009 to 2012) before deciding to go full force on his acting career. In 2015, John landed the role of Ricky Jerret in the HBO drama series Ballers.\n\nWhat’s more, the young actor had apparently kept the auditioning process a secret from his famous father, telling Esquire in 2020: “He kept asking questions,” he explained adding, “He was like, ‘For HBO? Like Home Box Office Entertainment? Who? Really? But what’s it called? The Rock?’ He just kept asking questions like ‘Is this real?’ I guess he had to check it with his agents to make sure it was real, and he was happy for me, and then he said exactly what I was going to do anyway, but [he told me] ‘As soon as this is over, you gotta go learn. You gotta go learn how to do this.'”"
