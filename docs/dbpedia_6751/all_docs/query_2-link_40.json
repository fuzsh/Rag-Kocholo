But playing a father-and-son duo on screen takes the relationship to a whole new level.\n\nDonald Sutherland, who died on June 20, worked with his son Kiefer on the Western film \"Forsaken.\" Kiefer played an outlaw trying to change his ways, while his father played a stern reverend.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\n\"Working with him is something I have wanted to do for 30 years,\" Kiefer told People in 2016. Donald, in turn, called Kiefer a \"wonderful actor.\"\n\nHere are some of Hollywood's most famous fathers and sons who also played father and son on-screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonald and Kiefer Sutherland starred in 2016's \"Forsaken\" as father and son.\n\nIn \"Forsaken,\" Kiefer Sutherland played a retired criminal and quick-draw killer John Henry Clayton in the late 1800s. After abandoning his old ways, he returns home to try and repair his relationship with his estranged father, Reverend Samuel Clayton, played by Kiefer's real father, Donald.\n\n\"As much as I planned as an actor that this is what I want to do with the character, I was not expecting how powerful it was going to be when I looked into my father's eyes,\" Kiefer told the Los Angeles Times in 2016.\n\nThey appeared in other movies together, including 1996's \"A Time to Kill,\" although they did not play father and son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDominic West joined the cast of \"The Crown\" for season five as Prince Charles. West's real son, Senan West, played Prince William.\n\nDominic replaced Josh O'Connor as Prince Charles in seasons five and six of Netflix's royal drama \"The Crown,\" which concluded its run in 2023.\n\nCharles, of course, has two sons: Prince William and Prince Harry. And there was no more perfect person to play Prince William than Dominic's real-life son Senan, 14, who was in three episodes of season five, according to IMDb.\n\n\"It was very moving actually, he'd never acted before because COVID stopped any school plays or anything so I'd never seen him act,\" Dominic told Yahoo UK in November 2022 of working with his son. \"He had this amazing innocence to him that was extraordinary to watch as well as the fact that obviously he's my boy. It's very difficult when you act with children to have a physical intimacy, but with him that's obviously not a question which made it much easier.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom and Colin Hanks played father and son in \"The Great Buck Howard\" in 2008.\n\n\"The Great Buck Howard\" follows John Malkovich as Buck Howard, a mentalist who is at the tail end of his career. His assistant, Troy, is played by Colin, who goes against the wishes of his father, Mr. Gable (played by Tom), who wants him to become a lawyer.\n\n\"He has always been really supportive of everything that I've done,\" Colin told NPR's Terry Gross of his father in 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill and Jaden Smith have played father and son twice. First, in 2006's \"The Pursuit of Happyness.\"\n\nIn \"The Pursuit of Happyness,\" a true story, Smith starred as Chris Gardner, a homeless medical salesman turned wildly successful stockbroker. His son, Jaden, played Gardner's son, Christopher Gardner Jr.\n\n\"Little Jaden is a chip off the old block, uncommonly at ease before the cameras. Their real-life bond is an inestimable asset to the onscreen characters' relationship,\" wrote Steve Persall of the St. Petersburg Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey teamed up again seven years later in \"After Earth.\"\n\n\"After Earth\" takes place in a future in which humans had to evacuate Earth after a cataclysmic event — 1,000 years later, Kitai and his father, Cypher, are marooned on the planet after their spaceship collapses. When Cypher's legs are broken, he instructs his teenage son on how to contact their home planet and get them home via a communicator while Kitai journeys through the now-perilous Earth.\n\nThe movie got disastrous reviews, and the elder Smith has discussed how \"After Earth\" strained his relationship with his son.\n\n\"'After Earth' was an abysmal box office and critical failure,\" Smith wrote in his 2021 memoir, \"Will.\" \"And what was worse was that Jaden took the hit. Fans and the press were absolutely vicious; they said and printed things about Jaden that I refuse to repeat. Jaden had faithfully done everything that I'd instructed him to do, and I had coached him into the worst public mauling he'd ever experienced.\"\n\n\"He felt misled, and he lost his trust in my leadership,\" Smith wrote. \"At 15 years old, when Jaden asked about being an emancipated minor, my heart shattered. He ultimately decided against it, but it sucks to feel like you've hurt your kids,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEugene and Dan Levy played father and son Johnny and David Rose on \"Schitt's Creek\" for six seasons from 2015 to 2020.\n\nThe Levys also co-created \"Schitt's Creek,\" so it was a no-brainer that they would play two of the leads: patriarch Johnny, a former video store tycoon, and his spoiled (yet lovable) son, David.\n\nBy the end of the series' six seasons, both Levys would take home Emmys for their acting and for producing, as the show won outstanding comedy series — they became the first father-son duo to win Emmys in the same year, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"I think what I learned from [my dad], just from a comedy standpoint, is that … there's so much generosity, I think, to great comedy,\" Levy told the \"Today\" show in 2021. \"You have to just give people space. There's just such a joy in knowing that you have each other's back.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJerry and Ben Stiller played father and son in 2007's \"The Heartbreak Kid.\"\n\nThe Stillers are one of the most legendary father-and-son duos in Hollywood. They acted together quite a bit before Jerry's death in 2020, although they didn't always play relatives.\n\nIn the 2007 remake of \"The Heartbreak Kid,\" Ben played a commitment-phobic man named Eddie who decides to propose to a woman he barely knows to get her to stay in the US. Jerry played his father, Doc.\n\n\"My dad is so funny. Like, I've never, ever thought I was funny like my dad. Or as funny as my dad. I've never really felt a competition, because I would lose, hands down,\" Stiller told The New Yorker after his father's death in May 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwenty years earlier, they also played father and son in 1987's \"Hot Pursuit.\"\n\nIn \"Hot Pursuit,\" they played Victor and Chris Honeywell, two side characters in the film.\n\nThe Stillers also both appeared in \"Zoolander\" and \"Heavyweights,\" though not as father and son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKirk Douglas, his son Michael, and his grandson Cameron all appeared in \"It Runs in the Family\" as three generations of the Gromberg family in 2003.\n\nIn \"It Runs in the Family,\" each generation of Gromberg men is dealing with their own issues — Kirk's character, Mitchell, is struggling with health complications after a stroke; his son Michael's character, Alex, is trying to manage marital issues and career doubts; and his son Cameron's character, Asher, is feeling lost while away at college.\n\nTo add even more Douglas genes to the film, Michael's mother and Kirk's ex-wife, Diana, also appeared in the film as Mitchell's wife, Evelyn.\n\nDiana died in 2015, while Kirk died in 2021. After his father's death, Michael posted a tribute on Instagram, \"To the world he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years, a humanitarian whose commitment to justice and the causes he believed in set a standard for all of us to aspire to.\"\n\n\"But to me and my brothers Joel and Peter he was simply Dad, to Catherine, a wonderful father-in-law, to his grandchildren and great grandchild their loving grandfather, and to his wife Anne, a wonderful husband,\" he continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian Gleeson plays the teenage son of his father Brendan's character in the 2006 film \"The Tiger's Tail.\"\n\nThe Gleesons have acted together multiple times in various permutations — for example, Brian played the younger version of his father Brendan's character in \"Assassin's Creed.\"\n\nBut in \"The Tiger's Tail,\" Brian plays the son of his father Brendan's character Liam, as Liam deals with his life heading in a downward spiral.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrendan also plays Brian's dad in a sitcom Brian co-created with his real-life brother Domnhall: \"Frank of Ireland\" in 2021.\n\nBoth of Brendan's sons appear in \"Frank of Ireland,\" though they do not play brothers — so, when Brendan shows up, he's only the father of Brian's character, Frank.\n\n\"Dad was amazing and brought an incredible energy on set,\" Domhnall told What to Watch. \"He was so up for it and so willing to be stupid. It was brilliant!\"\n\nDomnhall and Brendan also starred in the \"Harry Potter\" films, albeit not as relatives (Domnhall played the eldest son of the Weasley family, Bill, while Brendan played the legendary auror Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmilio Estevez played the deceased son of his father Martin Sheen's character in \"The Way\" in 2010.\n\nSince Estevez wrote and directed the film, of course he'd make it a family affair by casting his Emmy-winning father.\n\nIn the film, Sheen's character, Thomas, grieves the death of his son, Daniel, played by Estevez, in flashbacks and at the beginning of the film by continuing Daniel's journey of walking the Camino de Santiago (or The Way) in Europe.\n\n\"I had to keep reminding [my dad] that his character was not a friendly man, that he was suspicious of people, because that is not his nature,\" Estevez told The New York Times in 2011 when describing what it was like to work with his father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartin has acted with another of his sons, Charlie, too. In 1987's \"Wall Street,\" Charlie played Bud Fox, while his dad played Carl Fox.\n\nIn one of the biggest roles of Charlie's early career, he played stockbroker-in-training Bud Fox, who idolizes the sleazy (yet powerful) Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas. But his actual father in the film is played by his real dad.\n\nMartin Sheen played Carl Fox, an airline employee and union leader.\n\n\"I adore him,\" Martin Sheen said of his son in 2021, according to People. \"I've always, always adored him. His recovery and his life is a miracle and he's an extraordinary man.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartin and Charlie also played father and son in 1998 crime thriller \"No Code of Conduct.\"\n\nIn \"No Code of Conduct,\" the Sheens played Bill and Jake Peterson, a father-and-son duo who are both police officers. They uncover a huge drug-running operation from Mexico into Arizona while investigating the death of their coworker.\n\nThe two also acted together in \"Hot Shots! Part Deux,\" but not as father and son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott and James Caan played father and son in 1995's \"A Boy Called Hate.\"\n\nScott is the star of \"A Boy Called Hate,\" in which he plays teenager Steve, who renames himself Hate.
