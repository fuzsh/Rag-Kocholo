        "text": "In the midst of what has already been a rough campaign, things got testy and a little physical between Reps. Brad Sherman and Howard Berman at a debate Thursday at Pierce College.\n\nDuring a heated exchange between the two over a federal immigration bill, Sherman got up close to Berman’s face, threw his arm roughly around his shoulders and challenged “You want to get into this?”\n\nThe rowdy crowd started cheering and shouting, as a sheriff’s deputy and a debate organizer stepped in between them to prevent an escalation.\n\nBerman’s campaign immediately seized on the incident, sending out a 22-second YouTube snippet and a press release headlined “Brad Sherman attempts to start fight at college debate.”\n\n“There was not a question in my mind, he was challenging him to a fight,” said Berman campaign manager Brandon Hall in a phone interview.\n\n“Howard’s kind of a small guy and Brad was right in his face grabbing him.”\n\n“(Berman) was taken back for sure, but he handled it very coolly,” Hall added. “He tried to calm the crowd, he tried to back away from Brad and joke about it, but yes he was shaken by this.”\n\nSherman campaign consultant Parke Skelton said Sherman regrets the incident, but said the contention that he was challenging Berman to a fight is “ridiculous.” Skelton added that Berman initiated the exchange by stepping toward Sherman first.\n\n“Brad regrets his role in the process by which the whole thing got too heated,” Skelton said. “Brad regrets that for sure. But again I think it was a mutual losing of cool there, and it’s one of those things that happens in a campaign sometimes.”\n\nThe two incumbent San Fernando Valley congressmen have been pitted against each other this year in the 30th Congressional District by the redistricting process. What started out as a polite campaign has grown increasingly hostile as the general election approaches.\n\nRight before the exchange, the two were arguing over whether Berman deserved credit for authoring the Dream Act, which would provide citizenship for a limited number of undocumented immigrants who arrived in this country as minors.\n\nBerman referred to Sherman as “delusional” as the crowd started cheering. Sherman stood up and started yelling and pointing to refute Berman’s claim that he authored the bill, referring to official records of Congress that he said dispute Berman’s contentions.\n\nBerman took a step toward Sherman as a debate moderator began speaking to the two.\n\n“Don’t you dare stand up here in the West San Fernando Valley and get in my face!” Sherman shouted.\n\nBerman began repeating “You are wrong, you are wrong.”\n\nThat was when Sherman grabbed him and the two went face to face for few seconds before Berman stepped back and the sheriff’s deputy intervened.\n\nAfterward, they resumed the debate without further incident.\n\nharrison.sheppard@dailynews.com\n\n818-713-3729"
