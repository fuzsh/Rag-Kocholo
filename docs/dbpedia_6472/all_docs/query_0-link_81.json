        "text": "Incumbent Rep. Brad Sherman, a high-profile critic of President Donald Trump, was cruising to a primary victory in early voting in Congressional District 30, snagging more than 56 percent of the ballots cast in results posted early Wednesday.\n\nRepublican Mark S. Reed was second, trailing by a 2-1 margin. Democratic Party challengers Courtney “CJ” Berina, Raji Rab and Brian T. Carrol fell further behind.\n\nThese are semi-final results for the March 3 Primary Election. Because of delays at polling places, voting continued until late Tuesday night and many ballots of all types remain uncounted. The results could fluctuate as the registrar counts outstanding ballots, which includes provisional ballots and vote-by-mail votes that will continue to arrive by Friday. The next update is set for between 1 and 4 p.m. Wednesday. Results won’t be official until the registrar certifies the election.\n\nThe district includes Chatsworth, Northridge, Granada Hills, Tarzana, Sherman Oaks, Studio City and Woodland Hills.\n\nLatest election results here (after 8 pm)\n\nLike his L.A. County congressional counterparts — Ted Lieu, Maxine Waters and Adam Schiff — the incumbent Democrat has been an intense Trump critic.\n\nSherman was among the early drafters of impeachment articles.\n\nCheck out latest election news\n\nBut after serving in Congress since 1997, he’s got his share of challengers, from the right and the left.\n\nRepublican businessman Mark S. Reed is running on a platform to restore fiscal discipline, stemming the flow of illegal immigration and common-sense environment policy, which he said includes abolishing the Department of Energy.\n\nLike the presidential race on the Democratic side of the aisle, there’s a diversity of candidates who span the left end of the political spectrum, including progressives.\n\nA trio of San Fernando Valley Democrats are also challenging Sherman on the ballot: They include businessperson Courtney “CJ” Berina, a San Fernando Valley native who’s keen on free public college, ending wars and abloshing ICE; aviator Raji Rab, who pledges to provide relief for residents dealing with environmental issues in the Porter Ranch arae and who live near the Santa Susana Field Laboratory while also dealing with poverty; and Neighborhood Councilman Brian T. Carrol, a progressive whose platform includes dealing with homelessness and affordable housing, building a stronger transportation infrastructure and worker and women’s rights.\n\nSherman has been a favorite to be re-elected, with strong fundraising that outpaces his challengers."
