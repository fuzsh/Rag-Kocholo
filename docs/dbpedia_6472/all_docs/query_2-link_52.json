        "text": "Orono - Eric Paul Sherman, age 50, passed away peacefully at home on January 6, 2024, after being diagnosed with glioblastoma in June 2022. He was born on April 1, 1973, in Houlton, ME, the son of Roger L. and Patricia A. (Folsom) Sherman.\n\nEric graduated from Hodgdon High School in 1991 and went on to attend the University of Maine. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Resource Management and Environmental Policy in 1998. Eric met his wife, Amy, while attending college and they remained in Orono to work and raise their family. They celebrated 21 years of marriage in July 2023. Eric spent his career working as a sales representative where he was highly respected. Eric was known for his quick wit and sense of humor. He had a gift when talking with people and many of his long time customers and coworkers became dear friends. Eric was a devoted and loving husband and father. He enjoyed spending time with his family hiking, skiing, walking the dogs through the woods and attending his childrens' various activities. Eric loved music and shared this love with his children. He brought joy to all those around him.\n\nEric is survived by his wife, Amy; sons, Ethan and Adam; daughter, Emily; parents, Roger and Patricia Sherman; brother, Brad and his wife, Brenda; brother, Greg and his wife, Angela; sister, Michelle and her husband, Phil; as well as numerous beloved aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews.\n\nA service will be held on January 20, 2024, at 11 a.m. at Brookings-Smith, 133 Center Street, Bangor, ME, with Chaplain David Gardiner officiating. The family invites friends and relatives to celebrate Eric's life by sharing conversation and refreshments at the Family Reception Center of Brookings-Smith, 163 Center Street, Bangor, following the service.\n\nEric's legacy includes participating in a clinical trial through Penn Medicine, where he received treatment over the past year, which has the potential to improve treatment options for those diagnosed with glioblastoma in the future.
