        "text": "American football player (born 1988)\n\nThis article is about the American football player. For other people named Richard Sherman, see Richard Sherman.\n\nAmerican football player\n\nRichard Kevin Sherman[1] (born March 30, 1988) is an American former football cornerback who played 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). Sherman played college football for the Stanford Cardinal, beginning his career as a wide receiver before moving to cornerback as a junior.[2] He was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the fifth round of the 2011 NFL draft. He was selected to the Pro Bowl five times and voted All-Pro five times, including three times to the first team, and led the NFL in interceptions in 2013, when he also helped the Seahawks win their first Super Bowl. Sherman is regarded as one of the greatest cornerbacks of all time.[3][4]\n\nDuring his time as a member of the Seahawks, Sherman was part of the \"Legion of Boom\" defense, the secondary that led the NFL in pass defense in 2013 and 2014. This unit helped the Seahawks win Super Bowl XLVIII; their 43–8 win over the Denver Broncos matched the third-largest margin of victory in the history of the Super Bowl.[5] The Seahawks made it to Super Bowl XLIX the following season, losing in a close game against the New England Patriots. During his time with the Seahawks, they led the league in scoring defense for four straight years between 2012 and 2015, making them the first team to do so since the 1950s Cleveland Browns.[6][7][8][9] After playing with the Seahawks, he played for the San Francisco 49ers for three seasons, where he made his third Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl LIV, and spent one season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nSherman attended Dominguez High School in Compton, California. He graduated in 2006, when his classmates voted him the \"Male student most likely to succeed\".[10] A scholar-athlete, he was salutatorian (ranked second) in his high school class.[11] He graduated from high school with a 4.2 GPA.[10]\n\nSherman is a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity[12][13] and graduated from Stanford University in 2010 with an undergraduate degree in communications.[14] He began work towards his master's degree when he returned for a fifth year during his final year of eligibility.[15]\n\nSherman was born in Los Angeles, California, and he attended Dominguez High School, starring in football and track and field.[16] As a senior in 2005, he accounted for 1,030 all-purpose yards, including 870 yards on 28 catches and three punt returns for touchdowns. He also recorded 45 tackles, eight pass breakups and one interception as a cornerback, and helped Dominguez to a CIF Southern Section Division III title with a 41–14 victory over Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High School in the championship game.\n\nAs a member of the school's track team, Sherman was named a USA Today All-American after winning the California state title in the triple jump, with a mark of 15.44 meters, and was the 7th ranked triple jumper in California in 2005.[17] He made it to the finals of the state meet in the 110-meter hurdles, placing third with a time of 13.99 seconds, and also finished sixth in the long jump, with a mark of 7.25 meters.[18] He was also timed at 10.77 seconds in the 100 meters.[19]\n\nRecruiting\n\nUS college sports recruiting information for high school athletes Name Hometown High school / college Height Weight 40‡ Commit date Richard Sherman\n\nAthlete Compton, California Dominguez High School 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) 167 lb (76 kg) 4.64 Jan 15, 2006 Recruiting star ratings: Scout: Rivals: 247Sports: N/A Overall recruiting rankings: Scout: 61 (WR) Rivals: – National, 65 (CB), 93 (Cal)\n\n‡ Refers to 40 yard dash\n\nNote: In many cases, Scout, Rivals, 247Sports, and ESPN may conflict in their listings of height, weight and 40 time.\n\nIn these cases, the average was taken.

Sherman was added as a late replacement after Curtis Marsh Jr. sustained a hamstring injury on the first day of practice.[30] His Senior Bowl performance was well received and was expected to raise his draft stock.[31][32] Sherman attended the NFL Scouting Combine and completed all of the combine and positional drills.\n\nExternal videos Richard Sherman's NFL Combine Workout Richard Sherman's 40-yard dash\n\nOn March 17, 2011, Sherman participated at Stanford's pro day and attempted to improve on his combine performance. He performed the 40-yard dash (4.53), 20-yard dash (2.56s), 10-yard dash (1.58s), vertical jump (37\"), broad jump (11'0\"), short shuttle (4.29s), and three-cone drill (6.72s). At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Sherman was projected to be selected anywhere from the fourth to sixth rounds by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. The Sporting News projected Sherman to be a second round pick and Fox Sports' Peter Schrager projected Sherman to be a fifth round pick.[33][34] He was ranked as the fourth best cornerback in the draft by The Sporting News, was ranked the 22nd best cornerback by USA Today, was ranked the 24th cornerback prospect by DraftScout.com, and was ranked the 30th best cornerback by Pro Football Weekly.[35][36]\n\nPre-draft measurables Height Weight Arm length Hand span 40-yard dash 10-yard split 20-yard split 20-yard shuttle Three-cone drill Vertical jump Broad jump Bench press Wonderlic 6 ft 2+5⁄8 in\n\n(1.90 m) 195 lb\n\n(88 kg) 32 in\n\n(0.81 m) 9+3⁄4 in\n\n(0.25 m) 4.53 s 1.58 s 2.56 s 4.29 s 6.72 s 38 in\n\n(0.97 m) 11 ft 0 in\n\n(3.35 m) 16 reps 24 All values from NFL Combine/Pro Day[37][38]\n\nSeattle Seahawks\n\n[edit]\n\n2011 season\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks selected Sherman in the fifth round (154th overall) of the 2011 NFL draft.[39] Sherman was the 25th cornerback drafted in 2011.[40] While watching the draft with his family at home, Sherman was \"livid\" about players he perceived as inferior getting drafted before him.[41]\n\nOn July 22, 2011, the Seattle Seahawks signed Sherman to a four-year, $2.22 million contract that included a signing bonus of $182,424.[42][43]\n\nThroughout training camp, Sherman competed to be a starting cornerback against Walter Thurmond, Kelly Jennings, Byron Maxwell, Brandon Browner, and Kennard Cox.[44] Head coach Pete Carroll named Sherman the fourth cornerback on the depth chart to begin the regular season, behind Marcus Trufant, Brandon Browner, and Walter Thurmond.[45]\n\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Seattle Seahawks' season-opening 33–17 loss at the San Francisco 49ers. In Week 4, Sherman made his first career solo tackle during a 13-yard punt return by wide receiver Eric Weems as the Seahawks lost 30–28 to the Atlanta Falcons.[46] On October 30, 2011, Sherman earned his first career start after Marcus Trufant and Walter Thurmond were both placed on injured reserve for the remainder of the season.[47][48] He finished the Seahawks' 34–12 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals with five combined tackles, a season-high three pass deflections, and made his first career interception.

Head coach Pete Carroll named Sherman and Brandon Browner the starting cornerbacks to begin the regular season.[56]\n\nHe started in the Seattle Seahawks' season opener at the Arizona Cardinals and made four solo tackles, two pass deflections, and intercepted a pass by John Skelton in their 20–16 loss.[57] On October 14, 2012, Sherman made three solo tackles, three pass deflections, and an interception during a 24–23 win against the New England Patriots.[58] After the game, Sherman taunted quarterback Tom Brady and posted a photo of himself yelling at Brady with \"U mad bro?\" superimposed on it on his Twitter account. He later removed the post.[58] Prior to Week 8 against Detroit, Sherman nicknamed himself Optimus Prime, an action intended to send out the message that he would shut down Detroit's wide receiver, Calvin Johnson, known by his nickname Megatron.[59] He collected a season-high eight combined tackles and held Calvin Johnson to three catches for 46-yards as the Seahawks lost 28–24 at the Detroit Lions.[60] On November 11, 2012, Sherman recorded three combined tackles, three pass deflections, an interception, and made his first career sack during a 28–7 win against the New York Jets.

Sherman intercepted a pass by quarterback Matt Schaub, that was intended for tight end Owen Daniels, and returned it for a 58-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter to tie the game 20–20 which sent it into overtime.[76] He earned NFC Defensive Player of the Month for September.[77] In Week 15, he made two combined tackles, a season-high three pass deflections, and intercepted two passes by quarterback Eli Manning in a 23–0 win at the New York Giants.[78] He earned NFC Defensive Player of the Week for his game against the Giants.[79] The following week, he recorded a season-high eight combined tackles, deflected two passes, and intercepted two passes by quarterback Carson Palmer during a 17–10 loss to the Arizona Cardinals in Week 16.[80] On December 27, 2013, it was announced that Sherman was voted to the 2014 Pro Bowl, marking the first Pro Bowl selection of his career.[81] He finished the season with 48 combined tackles (38 solo), 16 pass deflections, eight interceptions, and a touchdown in 16 games and 16 starts.[82] He was voted to the Associated Press NFL All-Pro First Team for the second consecutive season.[83] Sherman received an overall grade of 87.8 from Pro Football Focus in 2013.[55]\n\nThe Legion of Boom allowed the fewest passing yards in the league and the Seahawks had the top ranked defense in 2013.[84][85] The Seattle Seahawks finished first in the NFC West with a 13–3 record and earned a first round bye.[86] The Seahawks reached the NFC Championship after defeating the New Orleans Saints 23–15 in the NFC Divisional Round.[87] On January 19, 2014, Sherman made two combined tackles and a pass deflection as the Seahawks defeated the San Francisco 49ers 23–17 in the NFC Championship Game. He played a critical role and deflected a pass by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, that was intended for Michael Crabtree, which was caught by teammate Malcolm Smith to seal the Seahawks' 23–17 victory.[88][89][90][91]\n\nThe play was later dubbed \"the Immaculate Deflection\" (as an homage to the Immaculate Reception), and would later be voted by Seahawks fans to be the most significant play in franchise history.[92] After the play, Sherman ran over to Crabtree and offered a handshake with Crabtree responding by shoving Sherman in his facemask. Sherman proceeded to make a choke sign towards Kaepernick and was immediately penalized by the officials for unsportsmanlike conduct.[91] The NFL went on to fine Sherman $7,875 for his taunting directed towards Kaepernick.[91]\n\n\"Well, I'm the best corner in the game! When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's the result you gonna get! Don't you ever talk about me! Don't you open your mouth about the best, or y'know I'm gonna shut it for you real quick! L.O.B.!\"\n\n— Sherman speaking about Michael Crabtree during a post-game interview on Fox Sports with Erin Andrews after the Seahawks' victory in the NFC Championship Game[93]\n\nSherman's rant was the subject of scrutiny by fans and the media, some of whom deemed him a \"thug\". He later blamed Crabtree's shove for fueling his post-game rant, though he also said he regretted his attack and was dismayed by the negative response from the public. In response to the word \"thug\" being widely used to criticize Sherman following the incident, Sherman said \"The reason it bothers me is because it seems like it's an accepted way of calling somebody the N-word now.\"[94]\n\nOn February 2, 2014, Sherman started in Super Bowl XLVIII and made three combined tackles and a pass deflection as the Seahawks defeated the Denver Broncos 43–8. He held wide receiver Eric Decker to one reception for a total of six-yards during the game.[95]\n\n2014 season\n\n[edit]\n\nOn May 7, 2014, the Seattle Seahawks signed Sherman to a four-year, $56 million contract extension with $40 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $11 million.[96] The agreement made him the highest paid cornerback in league history.[97] On June 6, 2014, Sherman was announced as the cover athlete for Madden 15.[98]\n\nDefensive coordinator Dan Quinn retained Sherman as the Seahawks' No. 1 starting cornerback alongside Byron Maxwell.[99] In Week 6, he collected a season-high eight combined tackles during a 30–23 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. On November 27, 2014, Sherman made two solo tackles, two pass deflections, and intercepted two passes by Colin Kaepernick during the Seahawks' 19–3 win at San Francisco during the Thanksgiving Day game. His performance earned him the NFC Defensive Player of Week award.[100] Sherman started all 16 games in 2014 and made 57 combined tackles (45 solo), eight passes defensed, and four interceptions.[101] Pro Football Focus gave Sherman an overall grade of 89.9 in 2014.[55] He was named to the Pro Bowl and earned First Team All-Pro honors.[102][103]\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks finished first in the NFC West with a 12–4 record and earned the No. 1 seed in the NFC.[104] On January 10, 2015, Sherman recorded three combined tackles, two pass deflections, and intercepted Cam Newton during the Seahawks' 31–17 victory against the Carolina Panthers in the NFC Divisional Round.[105] The following week, Sherman made four combined tackles, a pass deflection, and intercepted Aaron Rodgers during a 28–22 overtime victory against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship.[106] On February 1, 2015, Sherman started in Super Bowl XLIX and made three combined tackles as the Seahawks lost 28–24 to the New England Patriots.[107] The following day, it was announced that Sherman would need Tommy John surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left elbow.[108] Following the conclusion of the NFL season, the Pro Football Writers Association selected Sherman to win the PFWA Good Guy Award for his willingness to work with and provide insightful information to the media. He was the second consecutive Seahawk to win the award, as quarterback Russell Wilson was the previous recipient.[109] Sherman was awarded NFC Defensive Player of the Year honors by the Kansas City Committee.[110] He was ranked 11th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.[111]\n\n2015 season\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks' new defensive coordinator Kris Richard retained Sherman as the No. 1 starting cornerback on the depth chart in 2015, along with Cary Williams.[112] Sherman was voted to the 2016 Pro Bowl, marking his third consecutive selection.[113] He started all 16 games in 2015 and recorded 50 combined tackles (33 solo), 14 pass deflections, and two interceptions.[114] Pro Football Focus gave Sherman an overall grade of 86.7 in 2015. The Seattle Seahawks finished second in the NFC West with a 10–6 record and earned a Wild Card berth.[115] They reached the NFC Divisional Round before losing 31–24 at the Carolina Panthers.[116] He was ranked 20th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[117]\n\n2016 season\n\n[edit]\n\nHead coach Pete Carroll named Sherman and Jeremy Lane the starting cornerbacks to begin the regular season.[118] On October 2, 2016, Sherman recorded five combined tackles, deflected two passes, and intercepted two passes by Jets' quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick during a 27–17 victory at the New York Jets.[119] In Week 8, he collected a season-high eight combined tackles during a 25–20 loss at the New Orleans Saints. On December 20, 2016, Sherman was voted to the 2017 Pro Bowl.[120] He started all 16 games in 2016 and made 58 combined tackles (38 solo), 13 pass deflections, and four interceptions.[121] He was also ranked 21st by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[122] Pro Football Focus gave Sherman an overall grade of 84.6, which ranked 13th among all qualifying cornerbacks in 2016.[123]\n\nAfter the season, it was revealed that Sherman was battling a sprained MCL in his right knee, an injury that hampered him during the second half of the year. The Seahawks were suspected to have failed to disclose this injury, which prompted the NFL to investigate. If the injury was not disclosed in time, the Seahawks could have faced a heavy fine as well as a forfeiting a second-round pick in the 2017 Draft. Ultimately, the Seahawks were not penalized.[124]\n\n2017 season\n\n[edit]\n\nSherman and Jeremy Lane returned as the starting cornerbacks for the Seahawks in 2017.[125] Sherman was bothered in 2017 by his Achilles, which he initially injured in Week 5 during a 16–10 win against the Los Angeles Rams.[126] In the following weeks, he tried to avoid making any severe cuts.[127] On October 29, 2017, Sherman made four combined tackles, two pass deflections, and intercepted two passes by quarterback Deshaun Watson during a 41–38 victory against the Houston Texans.[128] During Week 10 in a 22–16 win at the Arizona Cardinals, he left the game in the third quarter after rupturing his Achilles, and was ruled out for the season.[126][129] It would be his final game as a Seahawk, as he was released the following offseason. He finished the season with 35 combined tackles (25 solo), seven pass deflections, and two interceptions in ten games and ten starts.[130] His injury ended his streak of 106 consecutive game appearances and 100 consecutive starts.

During the game, Sherman recorded two tackles and recovered a fumble forced by teammate Fred Warner on Dalvin Cook in the 24–16 loss.[136] In week 8 against the Arizona Cardinals, Sherman recorded a season-high 7 tackles and sacked rookie quarterback Josh Rosen once during the 18–15 loss.[137]\n\nDuring Week 16 against the Chicago Bears, Sherman was ejected from the game after throwing punches at Bears' wide receivers Josh Bellamy and Anthony Miller, who were also ejected. The incident was triggered after 49ers' safety Marcell Harris made a late hit on Bears' quarterback Mitchell Trubisky.[138] On December 29, Sherman was fined $10,026.[139] Sherman finished his first season with the 49ers with 37 tackles, one sack, four passes defended, and a fumble recovery in 14 games played.[140]\n\n2019 season\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Week 1 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Sherman intercepted a pass thrown by Jameis Winston and returned it 37 yards for a touchdown in the 31–17 win.

sealed a 37–20 win and a trip to Super Bowl LIV.[146]\n\nIn Super Bowl LIV against the Kansas City Chiefs, Sherman's quest for a second Lombardi Trophy failed as the 49ers were defeated 31–20 in a game in which Sherman was criticized for a poor performance during the Chiefs' game-winning drive, as he gave up a 38-yard reception to wide receiver Sammy Watkins and then missed an important goal-line tackle on running back Damien Williams, allowing him to score the touchdown that gave the Chiefs a 24–20 lead with under three minutes to play.[147][148] He was ranked 28th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[149] He was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame All-2010s Team.[150]\n\n2020 season\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 16, 2020, Sherman was placed on injured

Defensive Backs Coach Kevin Ross being ineligible due to COVID-19 protocols.[156] During pregame warm-ups before the Week 10 game against the Washington Football Team, Sherman suffered a calf injury which caused him to miss the game and to be placed on injured reserve three days later.[157] He was activated on December 10 in time for the team's Week 14 game against the Buffalo Bills, where Sherman recorded his only interception of the season off a pass thrown by Josh Allen in the Buccaneers' 33–27 overtime win.[158] He was placed back on injured reserve on January 11, 2022, with an Achilles injury, ending his season.[159] He finished the season playing in just five games with three starts, recording 11 tackles, a pass deflection, and one interception.[160]\n\nNFL career

national attention with a post-game interview made immediately after his tipped pass ensured the Seahawks a victory over the San Francisco 49ers in the 2013 NFC Championship game, in which he labeled
