        "text": "Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Sherman Oaks, is getting an election fight from several challengers from both sides of the political spectrum this year.\n\nThe congressman, first elected in 1997, is up against four Democratic and two Republican opponents for a seat representing the newly formed 32nd Congressional District in the June 7 primary election.\n\nThe district includes Bel Air, Bell Canyon, Beverly Glen, Brentwood, Canoga Park, Chatsworth, Encino, Malibu, North Hills, Northridge, Pacific Palisades, Reseda, Sherman Oaks, Studio City, Tarzana, Topanga, West Hills, Winnetka, and Woodland Hills.\n\nSherman’s Democratic opponents are Shervin Aazami, a non-profit legislative director; Jason Potell, a consultant/community organizer; Raji Rab, an aviator, educator and entrepreneur; and Aarika Samone Rhodes, a teacher.\n\nRepublican opponents are business owner Lucie Lapointe Volotzky and Melissa Toomim, a writer.\n\nThe top two vote-getters on June 7 move through to the general election in November.\n\nSherman, whose campaign war chest as of March 31 was $1,780,000, is endorsed by political notables like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, the California Democratic Party and Planned Parenthood.\n\nBut his eager challengers believe it’s time for him to be replaced.\n\nVolotzky is among them, hoping to defeat the odds and unseat Sherman in a highly Democratic district and against a longtime incumbent.\n\nA Republic businesswoman from Chatsworth, she has not held an elected position.\n\nShe believes that besides addressing obvious growing homelessness and resolving issues related to the SoCalGas leak in Aliso Canyon, food and gas prices are top priorities to tackle.\n\nShe wants to see accountable regulations in the public sector because their “abuse of power and poor performance continues unabated.”\n\nVolotzky immigrated from Canada in 1984, got married and started a business at a local flea market, which grew into a multi-store company. She believes small business is under attack and bureaucracy has grown tenfold. Her campaign receipts as of March 31 total $14,500.\n\nShe says this race is critical.\n\n“I’m hoping voters see that it is time for a change,” Volotzky said. “Same party, same people have not even produced status quo, but a deterioration of our communities and the quality of life for the people of our great state.”\n\nBut the challenge to Sherman is not just coming from the right.\n\nAn opening line on Aazami’s campaign website reflects he is not bashful about his challenge from Sherman’s left.\n\n“For too long, our seat in Congress has been occupied by a corporate, Wall Street Democrat who refuses to fight for economic justice and racial equity,” it reads, accompanied by a slew of local progressive grassroots organization endorsements.\n\n“As a former legislative director working on Capitol Hill, I (ushered through) more bills in two years as an advocate than the incumbent has in 26 years as a legislator,” said Aazami, a Democrat. “These include canceling copays and deductibles for veteran populations, securing long-term funding for community health centers and delivering over $10 billion to frontline communities for COVID-19 response, maternal health, and drug overdose prevention.”\n\nAazami has not held an elected position but touts his grasp of the legislation process.\n\nHe said he has a progressive vision, which includes policies like single-payer Medicare for all, the Green New Deal, universal childcare benefits and the elimination of medical and student loan debt.\n\nAazami is a father, immigrant and anti-war activist who grew up in the San Fernando Valley and whose Iranian parents were granted asylum after fleeing religious persecution.\n\n“I’m running because the economic challenges facing working and middle class Angelenos are only growing more dire and we’re not going to solve them by continuing the same status quo politics,” said Aazami who reported $186,000 in total campaign receipts as of March 31.\n\nSherman stands by his record.\n\nWhile in Congress, he supports strong environmental standards, federal aid to education, healthcare reform and the protection of Society Security and Medicare. And he supports policies to expand U.S. exports, prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and promote “a just” U.S. foreign policy.\n\n“These national issues are so intense,” Sherman said. “I don’t have to tell you politics is intense, partisanship is intense but everything from the Ukraine, January 6, to tax proposals, the national issues are certainly on people’s minds.”\n\nSherman is mindful that this year’s midterms could be a referendum on President Joe Biden and his policies, a prospect that doesn’t bode well for Democrats across the country in danger of losing their slim majorities in Congress.\n\nSherman said that tension is showing up in his race, too.\n\n“Our polling showed it was a two-way race early and it continues to be, and my record best epitomizes what the district wants, but people are saying this is going to be a good Republican year,” he said. “Those people who don’t like what (President Joe) Biden is doing, that helps Volotzky.”\n\nRab, a Democrat and an entrepreneur, has never held an elected office, but he hasn’t shied away from trying to get there.\n\nWhen he ran for L.A. City Council three years ago, he told the Daily News his life’s passion is to understand and tackle the “bread and butter” issues facing the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThat has fueled his challenges against Sherman in 2016, 2018 and 2020. And it’s fueling him now, when he cites homelessness, the Aliso Canyon gas leaks, Santa Susana Field Lab contamination cleanup, and increased cost of gas and groceries as pressing issues facing district voters.\n\nThe West Hills resident and immigrant calls himself a problem-solver with leadership qualities necessary to get the job done. He was a flight instructor, a chief pilot and owned and operated a flight school, an airline and now a computer infrastructure facility and is on the warpath against corruption.\n\n“(The) incumbent has failed the people for years,” Rab said. “I am the only serious option to unseat the incumbent and to bring good change that is so much overdue.”\n\nDemocratic candidate Rhodes says her fight is to support the unhoused, fix public education, bolster small businesses and reform the criminal justice system. She supports Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and a Universal basic income.\n\nShe hasn’t held an elected position and is a first-time congressional candidate. Her campaign total receipts as of March 31 was $296,000.\n\n“I didn’t decide to run for Congress just to replace the current incumbent Brad Sherman,” said Las Vegas-born Rhodes, who graduated from Cal State Northridge with a graduate degree. “I’m running to make a difference in our community and to work hard to pass meaningful legislation that will solve the increase in homelessness, improve our education system and fix our foster care system.”\n\nPotell, a Democrat and a consultant and community organizer with a Master’s degree in economics, was born and raised in the district and comes from a Mexican Catholic and European Jewish family.\n\nHis campaign receipts total as of March 31 was $50,600 of which he personally donated $33,700.\n\nPotell is focused on immigration, refugees and border security along with homelessness, jobs, the economy, climate change, the Green New Deal, water supplies, innovation and cryptocurrency.\n\nHe says he’s always been community-service minded, a trait reinforced in his college years on a “life-changing” trip to Nicaragua, his voter outreach work in East Harlem, which taught him the “positive impact of people fighting for their friends and neighbors, especially the most vulnerable,” according to his website.\n\nMelissa Toomim, a writer and Republican candidate, had $22,000 in campaign receipts as of March 31. Her platform includes securing the southern border to stem the tide of illegal immigration and trafficking, and she wants industry jobs returned. She also supports Israel.\n\nBut, she adds, her policies are anchored by a devotion to the First Amendment, which she says “political correctness” and “cancel culture” are eroding.\n\nHer appeal to bring back entertainment industry jobs to the region, she said, is rooted in free speech.\n\n“We must strengthen our creative environment by breaking free from ‘correct’ thought,” she says on her campaign website. “Liberty is not a jingoistic term. It is the fundamental value that drives American ingenuity. Free speech is critical for our entertainment industry to flourish.”\n\nThe race at a glance:\n\nThe Race: U.S. Congressional District 32\n\nThe District: Includes Bel Air, Bell Canyon, Beverly Glen, Brentwood, Canoga Park, Chatsworth, Encino, Malibu, North Hills, Northridge, Pacific Palisades, Reseda, Sherman Oaks, Studio City, Tarzana, Topanga, West Hills, Winnetka, and Woodland Hills.\n\nCandidates:\n\nShervin Aazami, a Democratic and a non-profit legislative director endorsed by Progressive Democrats of America\n\nJason Potell, a Democratic and a consultant/community organizer\n\nRaji Rab, a Democratic and an aviator, educator and entrepreneur\n\nAarika Samone Rhodes, a Democratic and an elementary teacher endorsed by Los Angeles African American Women Political Action Committee\n\nBrad Sherman, the Democratic incumbent, endorsed by Planned Parenthood\n\nLucie Lapointe Volotzky, a Republican and business owner, endorsed by former LA County Supervisor Michael Antonovich\n\nMelissa Toomim, a Republican and a writer\n\nThe issues: Shutting down Aliso Canyon, cleaning up Santa Susana Field Laboratory, a congested Sepulveda Pass, increased jet noise in flight paths, growing homelessness, the proposed homeless housing project at the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center and the ripple effect of national issues.\n\nOne thing to know about this race: Odds are the incumbent, Brad Sherman, could win but not without a fight from fellow Democrats and a pair of Republicans. His challengers believe Sherman has been in Congress too long, that it’s time for a fresh face. Given the rising tide of Republican political wins expected this upcoming election season nationwide, if a Democrat wins, conventional wisdom is that they may end up in the minority party in Congress."
