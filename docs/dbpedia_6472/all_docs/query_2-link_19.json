        "text": "Brad Sherman is a Professor of Law at The University of Queensland. Professor Sherman's previous academic positions include posts at Griffith University, the London School of Economics, and the University of Cambridge. His research expertise encompasses many aspects of intellectual property law, with a particular emphasis on its historical, doctrinal and conceptual development. In 2015 Professor Sherman was awarded a highly prestigious Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship. His laureate project Harnessing Intellectual Property to Build Food Security looks at the role of intellectual property in relation to food security. The research will help to maximise the benefits while minimising the costs of using IP protection to improve agricultural productivity and food security in Australia and the Asia Pacific."
