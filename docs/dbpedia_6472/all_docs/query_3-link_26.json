He is a member of the U.S. House, representing California's 32nd Congressional District and has served as Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.\n\nSherman began serving in the House of Representatives in 1997. He has worked as a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee. From 2019 to 2023, Sherman served as Chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets.\n\nWhile in Congress, Sherman developed a reputation as a strong advocate for the interests of working families. He also supported policies to expand U.S. exports, prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and promote a just and effective U.S. foreign policy. In 1997, while still serving on the House Budget Committee, Congressman Sherman authored an amendment to the annual Budget Resolution providing an additional $700 million for the acquisition of environmentally important lands in FY ‘98.\n\nWe promote concerts on a monthly basis, and use Bookingagentinfo.com to have quick access to the booking agents for different artists.
