        "text": "SHERMAN SECURES OVER $500,000 FOR VALLEY JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAMS WASHINGTON – Congressman Brad Sherman announced that Congress today approved over half a million dollars in federal appropriations funding for juvenile justice related programs serving the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThe funding was included as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009 which will be signed by the President soon.\n\nThe funds Sherman secured are for three specific projects: Phoenix Academy in Lake View Terrace, New Directions for Youth in Van Nuys, and the Court Appointed Special Advocates program serving the San Fernando Valley.\n\nPhoenix Academy’s Access to Treatment Initiative – $250,000 Phoenix Academy of Lakeview Terrace is the only facility in Los Angeles County that provides long-term residential treatment for teenagers with drug and alcohol problems. It also provides vital services to youth and families struggling with substance abuse and mental health problems.\n\nThis funding will be used to increase the number of adolescents who are able to receive treatment – treatment these adolescents would otherwise be unable to afford – and to provide additional outreach services to the community. Sherman was joined by Rep. Jane Harman in requesting money for this project.\n\n“Thanks to Congressman Sherman, Phoenix Academy is able to help hundreds of Los Angeles’ most needy youth and their families each year,” said Elizabeth Stanley-Salazar, managing director of Phoenix Academy in Lake View Terrace. “Phoenix Academy is dedicated to helping troubled teens get their lives back on track and Congressman Sherman’s support will give us the opportunity to help even more teens.”\n\nPhoenix Academy is part of a network of 29 drug-treatment facilities throughout California and others across the country. The academy’s one-year residential substance abuse treatment program is followed by a year of aftercare for adolescents with drug, alcohol, and behavioral issues. The substance-abuse treatment is combined with a course of academic study coordinated with the resident’s home school and directed by experienced, state-licensed teachers.\n\nNew Directions for Youth, Gang and Delinquency Prevention Program – $150,000 New Directions for Youth seeks to provide comprehensive and individualized programs that assist at-risk youth to become productive, self-sufficient, healthy young adults and that create supportive, safe family environments.\n\nThe primary goal of the Gang and Delinquency Prevention Program is to prevent youth involvement in gangs among 13-18 year olds in the San Fernando Valley, specifically targeting a number of local high schools.\n\n“We’re excited and appreciative for all of Congressman Sherman’s work,” said Executive Director of New Directions for Youth, Monica Austin-Jackson. “Our program helps stitch together some of the more tattered sections of the fabric of our community. The Congressman has been and continues to be a friend to New Directions for Youth and we applaud his dedication to Valley families.”\n\nCourt Appointed Special Advocates of Los Angeles County – $110,000\n\nThis funding will provide the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) of Los Angeles County program with the resources required to recruit, train and supervise community volunteers to advocate for abused and neglected San Fernando Valley children in the foster care system. CASA volunteers maintain regular visits with the children they serve, getting to know the child as an individual, not just a case.\n\n“These funds reflect Congressman Sherman’s appreciation for children in our community and for their need to have a compassionate and considerate court system. We are thankful that the Congressman went to bat for our program,” said CASA of Los Angeles County Executive Director David Melendez.\n\nSHERMAN SECURES $475,000 FOR ZERO EMISSIONS BUSES\n\nWASHINGTON – Congressman Brad Sherman announced that Congress approved nearly a half million dollars in federal appropriations funding for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s Zero Emissions Bus Project.\n\nThe $475,000 in strategically targeted federal investments that Sherman secured is included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009, which passed the Senate today, and now heads to the White House for President Obama’s signature.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) will receive $475,000 in federal funds to demonstrate the latest zero emission technologies in heavily urbanized operating environments such as the San Fernando Valley. This funding will be used to help demonstrate the commercial and operational viability of current generation fuel cell-powered buses. The Zero Emissions Bus Project will be the first zero emission demonstration project in the Los Angeles basin.\n\n“We are very pleased that Congressman Sherman successfully secured funding for Metro’s zero emission bus project,” remarked Metro Chief Executive Officer Roger Snoble. “Metro transit services currently reduce air pollution in Los Angeles County by over 1,100 metric tons each day. With the funding made available through Congressman Sherman’s efforts, we look forward to further enhancing our clean air fleet,” Snoble added.\n\n“Given the drastic effects of climate change, we have a responsibility to act quickly to reduce harmful emissions of greenhouse gases,” said Congressman Sherman. “I am glad that the Congress is recognizing the need to employ environmentally-friendly technologies as part of our efforts to improve mass transit systems.”\n\nSHERMAN SECURES $237,500 FOR RAPE TREATMENT PROGRAM AT NORTHRIDGE HOSPITAL\n\nWASHINGTON – Congressman Brad Sherman announced that the Congress has approved nearly a quarter of a million dollars in federal appropriations funding for the Northridge Hospital Foundation Family Justice Center in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThe $237,500 in funding was included as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009, which was approved by the Senate today. The legislation now heads to President Obama for his signature.\n\nThese funds will be used to redesign the Northridge Hospital Foundation Family Justice Center to serve the victims of sexual assault, bring social, legal and medical service professionals together under one roof, and streamline a victim’s search for help and justice.\n\n“We are very appreciative to Congressman Brad Sherman for his support in securing federal funds to assist in the development of the San Fernando Valley Family Justice Center. This Center has been a dream of Northridge Hospital for the past four years and by enabling public and private agencies to co-locate into one facility, we can more effectively serve victims of sexual and domestic abuse,” said Michael Wall, President and CEO of Northridge Hospital Medical Center.\n\nCongressman Sherman said, “I applaud the Northridge Hospital Foundation’s Family Justice Center for seeking to minimize the obstacles that assault victims must confront as they cope with trauma.”\n\nSHERMAN SECURES $621,000 FOR STUDYING AND IMPROVING VALLEY ECOSYSTEM\n\nWASHINGTON – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman announced that Congress approved $621,000 in federal appropriations funding for ecological studies in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThe $618,000 in federal funding was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009, which passed the Senate today, and is heading to the White House for President Obama’s signature.\n\n“The Army Corps of Engineers’ studies are the first step toward revitalizing and restoring the Sun Valley Watershed and the Los Angeles River,” said Congressman Sherman. “I am thankful that my colleagues share my concern for the Valley’s watersheds and waterways.”\n\nThe Los Angeles River Revitalization Study, which was awarded $478,000, will build upon an existing study by the Army Corps of Engineers. This study will explore alternatives for ecosystem restoration in and along the river and incorporate input from the City of Los Angeles’ Master Plan for the Los Angeles River.\n\nThe Sun Valley Watershed Feasibility Study will receive $143,000. The Sun Valley Watershed is a 2,800 acre (4.4 square mile) urban watershed tributary to the Los Angeles River, located approximately 14 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. The urban Sun Valley community suffers from a lack of both recreational opportunities and wildlife habitat. The community has also experienced severe, chronic flooding for over 40 years.\n\nThese federal funds will be used by the Army Corps of Engineers to study whether it is feasible to pursue environmental restoration, water quality improvement, and flood mitigation projects, among others, in the Sun Valley Watershed. The Los Angeles County Flood Control District, represented by the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works, will work with others to provide the required local match for the development of this study. Congressman Howard Berman also supported this request.\n\nSHERMAN SECURES $570,000 FOR CSUN PROGRAMS\n\nWASHINGTON – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman announced that Congress has approved $570,000 in federal appropriations funding for two programs at California State University, Northridge (CSUN) – one to train teaching professionals in new techniques and the other to introduce children to the performing arts.\n\nThe funding is included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009, which passed the Senate today and now heads to President Obama for his signature.\n\n“These funds are critical to our efforts at California State University, Northridge to break new educational ground and provide rich educational opportunities that reflect and incorporate the diversity of our surrounding community. We thank Congressman Sherman for his dedicated service to the Valley and to our mission,” said Cal State Northridge President Jolene Koester.\n\nCSUN has become a leader nationally in developing new approaches in teaching teachers. The TLC (Teaching, Learning, Counseling) Model will receive $285,000 for a one-year demonstration project to develop and implement a new clinical training model to assist new teachers. This program promotes a “transdisciplinary” model, combining teaching, learning and counseling. The TLC model is expected to prepare better teachers and school counselors to work collaboratively and support the needs of those children who are at risk of being left behind.\n\nThe K-12 Arts Education Program also received funding, in the amount of $285,000. These funds will be used to provide live performance experiences and performing arts instructional programs in dance, symphony, popular music, theatre, and opera, for promising students enrolled in Title I public and charter schools in the San Fernando Valley. The program will be administered by California State University, Northridge, under the joint auspices of staff assigned to its new Center for the Performing Arts, the College of Education, and the College of Arts Media and Communication.\n\n“These funds demonstrate the Congress’s continued commitment to ensuring that the next generation of Valley school children have opportunities to learn and grow,” said Congressman Sherman. “Our communities need more and better qualified teachers, and they benefit from a curriculum that exposes students to creative and artistic expression.”\n\nSHERMAN SECURES $333,000 IN FEDERAL AID FOR EL PROYECTO DEL BARRIO CLINIC\n\nWASHINGTON – Congressman Brad Sherman announced that Congress today approved $333,000 in federal appropriations funding for El Proyecto del Barrio, a San Fernando Valley non-profit organization which operates a health clinic and provides free services to those who qualify.\n\nIn 2007, El Proyecto del Barrio’s health clinic saw close to 80,000 patients in the San Fernando Valley. The funds El Proyecto del Barrio will receive will be used to purchase an electronic medical records system. This new system will improve the accuracy, accessibility and quality of patient care.\n\nThe funding was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009, which passed the Senate today and now heads to the White House for President Obama’s signature.\n\nThe President and Chief Executive Officer of El Proyecto del Barrio, Corinne Sanchez, said, “It is hard to find words to highlight the importance of good organization and record management to the quality of the services we provide. In addition to providing accurate medical case histories, moving to an electronic management system should free up staff time that can be directed to providing services to the community. On behalf of the tens of thousands of patients who are served by our clinic, we thank Congressman Sherman.”\n\nThis project was also supported by Congressman Howard Berman and then-Congresswoman Hilda Solis, who is now the Secretary of the Department of Labor in the Obama Administration.\n\nSHERMAN SECURES $85,000 FOR PIERCE COLLEGE\n\nWASHINGTON – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman announced that Congress has approved $85,000 in federal appropriations funding for Los Angeles Pierce College in Woodland Hills.\n\nThe funding is included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009, which passed the Senate today and now heads to President Obama for his signature.\n\nThe $85,000 in federal funds that Congressman Sherman secured for Pierce College will aid in the acquisition of new meteorological equipment for their on-campus weather station.\n\n“We are delighted that Congressman Sherman succeeded in obtaining these funds,” said Pierce College President Robert Garber. “We appreciate Congressman Sherman’s advocacy for our school. Our Weather Station will see tremendous improvements thanks to this congressional appropriation.”\n\nThe Pierce College Weather Station enables students, community members, and the news media to compare recent weather indicators with those extending back to 1949. Upgrades to the Pierce College Weather Station will enhance its data collection and reporting usefulness to multiple audiences, including the National Weather Service, local, national, and international weather reporters and researchers, Pierce College Meteorology and Geography students, and K-12 science students, not to mention the general community in the college’s service area."
