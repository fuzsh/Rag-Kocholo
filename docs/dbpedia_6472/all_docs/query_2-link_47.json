        "text": "David was elected to the Board in May of 2023. He and his wife Whitney are both graduates of Sherman High School (2005 and 2010). Together, they have three young children that are the future of SISD. As a lifelong resident of Sherman and the son of a former educator, David has strong roots in SISD.\n\nAfter earning his certification as an audio engineer and touring the country with several different bands, David started his business here in Sherman in 2009. In 2018, he and his sister Kate (Class of 2003) merged their companies together under the name Cadence Studios. Together with their parents, they provide audio-visual services throughout the Texoma region, including Sherman’s Hot Summer Nights and Lights on the Lake concert series.\n\nDavid is an Eagle Scout, former captain of the SHS drumline, former foster parent, soccer coach, former board member of Downtown Sherman Now, and was named to the Herald Democrat’s Top 40 Under 40 list. He has also served on several SISD committees and the PTAs at Sory and Dillingham. He and his family are active members of Post Oak Fellowship Church, where David serves on the worship team and as a Lifegroup leader alongside his wife."
