        "text": "Biography\n\nCongressman Brad Sherman is one of UCLA Debate Union’s most remarkable alumni. A long-term Congressman, he’s served the San Fernando Valley district of California in the United States House of Representatives since 1997. Passionate about environmental issues, civil liberties, employee rights, transportation, animal rights and fiscal responsibility, he has been an exceedingly popular Congressman, endorsed by everyone from Governor Jerry Brown to former President Bill Clinton.\n\nBorn in Monterey Park on October 24th, 1954 Brad grew up in Southern California, graduating from UCLA in 1974 Summa Cum Laude. As an undergraduate, Sherman devoted his time to the Debate Union where he strengthened his speaking skills and developed the powers of persuasion that he would later use in his illustrious career.\n\nBrad later earned his law degree from Harvard University, graduating Magna Cum Laude. He subsequently worked on the staff at a large CPA firm, developing his passion for consumer advocacy. While working at the CPA firm he counseled entrepreneurs and small businesses, and later represented the Philippines government under President Aquino in their seizure of former President Marcos’ assets.\n\nUpon being elected to Congress, Sherman quickly focused his efforts on the budget, and consumer protections. He pushed for the formation of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, and made it a priority to protect families’ retirement funds and savings. He has been an outspoken critic of corporate greed and irresponsibility.\n\nOne of Sherman’s trademark issues has been fiscal responsibility. He has long advocated for balancing the federal budget, and frequently introduces legislation to protect the financial wellbeing of low-income citizens and older Americans.\n\nAs a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for over 20 years Sherman has long advocated for the strongest US-Israel relationship possible. He has led efforts to combat the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement, and introduced the Combatting BDS Act of 2017 to allow local governments to divest from entities who engage in BDS activities.\n\nSherman has further distinguished himself for his dedication to environmental conservancy. As a member of the House Budget Committee he wrote an amendment to dedicate funds towards acquiring environmentally important lands.\n\nBeyond being an accomplished Congressman and advocate, Sherman is also a devoted husband and father. He lives in Sherman Oaks with his wife Lisa, and three daughters Molly, Naomi and Lucy."
