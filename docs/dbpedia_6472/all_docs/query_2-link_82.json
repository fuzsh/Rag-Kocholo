        "text": "“The times, they are a-changin” goes the Bob Dylan song, and they most definitely are for the congenial and always smiling Brad Sherman. I first met Brad more than 15 years ago when he played in the band Area 51, but he’s since become quite the restaurateur, as owner of both Aldo’s on State Street and the Blue Agave on the restaurant row of East Cota Street.\n\nThe latter has been serving upscale Mexican food for many years, but it will reopen today as Nectar Eatery and Lounge, with a focus on shareable dishes with international flair. New menu items include dates with goat cheese, prosciutto, and balsamic; yellow beet salad endive with lemon curd yogurt and pistachios; lemongrass shrimp-garlic-chili-lime butter toast; and black cod harissa with roasted spiced cauliflower. There’s a brand new regional wine list to pair with these items plus refurbished cocktail selections as well.\n\nAnd that’s not the only big change in Brad’s life: he recently married private chef Aparna Sherman, and they make for a beautiful couple.\n\nThe ever-evolving Brad answers the Proust Questionnaire.\n\nWhat is your current state of mind? Fired up. Ready to serve.\n\nWhat do you like most about your job? I like the challenge of operating two restaurants and am particularly excited to open Nectar. Being in the restaurant industry involves heart-opening interactions with customers and, in some instances, off-the-couch psychological therapy!\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession? Memories, of my daughter’s birth, of my recent wedding.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest achievement? Successfully raising my daughter Geneva who just turned 23 and is graduating from Chapman University in December.\n\nWhat is your idea of perfect happiness?\n\nCasually meandering down streets in countries that are new to me and snorkling in clean clear water.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nLosing those I love too soon.\n\nWho do you most admire?\n\nMy wife Aparna. For her wisdom, intelligence, and kindness. A wicked combo.\n\nWhat is your greatest extravagance?\n\nThai Massage and dining in unique locations.\n\nWhat is the quality you most like in people? Kindness and humility.\n\nWhat is the quality you most dislike in people? Mean-spirited and self-absorbed people. I’m saddened that new forms of media vehicles give their ignorant and hateful opinions a voice\n\nWhat do you most value in friends? Loyalty in friendships, where I can let down my guard and truly be myself.\n\nWhat is your most marked characteristic? I am empathic and care about others.\n\nWhich words or phrases do you most overuse? Phenomenal and fantastic. Friends and family enjoy mimicking my overuse.\n\nWhich talent would you most like to have? Being a multi-instrumentalist songwriter.\n\nIf you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?\n\nBeing a professional musician for many years and now owning an establishment that closes at 2 a.m. has left deeply ingrained late-night patterns. I’m working on being an earlier riser. Where would you most like to live? For culture, I am most attracted to England or Iceland. For retirement, Mexico or Hawaii. Who makes you laugh the most? I’ve been a big fan of stand up comedy for years. Brian Regan and Jim Gaffigan.\n\nWhat is your motto? “Do it right the first time.”\n\nWhich historical figure do you most identify with? George Carlin. Though many times crude, his satirical rants were loud, clear, and hit a little too close to home.\n\nOn what occasion do you lie?\n\nOn occasion I withhold information in order to protect someone else’s feelings. And it has backfired — 100 percent of the time!"
