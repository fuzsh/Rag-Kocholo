Occupation Accountant, lawyer Religion Judaism Sherman’s public service career includes serving on the California State Board of Equalization from 1991 to 1996. He was Chairman of the Board from 1991 to 1995.[7] It was reported that the campaign for the Board of Equalization involved numerous attacks. Claude Parrish, Sherman's opponent, said that an attorney general candidate declined to endorse Sherman due to a post on the state's elected tax appeals board. Sherman replied, calling it \"one of the most outrageous hit pieces in contemporary California political history.\"[8] U.S. House of Representatives (1997– Present) Elections In 1994, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Anthony C. Beilenson of California's 24th congressional district barely survived the Republican Revolution, winning re-election by just a two-point margin,[9] by far the worst election performance of his career. In 1996, Beilenson decided to retire. Sherman decided to run and won the 7-candidate Democratic primary with 54% of the vote.[9] In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Rich Sybert (also 1994 nominee) 49%–44%.[10] In 1998, he won re-election with 57% of the vote.[11] After that, he has won re-election every two years with at least 62%.[12] 2012 Redistricting following the 2010 census left Sherman and fellow Democratic U.S. Congressman Howard Berman in the same district.[13][14] Brad Sherman represented more of the new congressional district, with about 60% of voters California’s new 30th district coming from Congressman Sherman’s old district, and about 20 percent of voters from Berman's.[15][16] On June 5, 2012 Brad Sherman faced Howard Berman in the primary for California’s new 30th Congressional district. Sherman received more votes than Berman by a margin of 42% to 32%.[17] However, due to the new election system in California, which put the two candidates who received the most votes in the primary against each other regardless of party, the two congressmen again faced each other in the general election.[18] Neither candidate received an official endorsement from the state Democratic party.[19] Berman was the establishment candidate. He was endorsed by over 20 congressmen, including party leaders Steny Hoyer and Xavier Becerra. In addition, he was endorsed by sitting Governor Jerry Brown, sitting Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and both of the state's two U.S. Senators: Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein.[20] He was also endorsed by ten Republican congressmen from California: David Dreier, Wally Herger, Dan Lungren, Elton Gallegly, Buck McKeon, Ed Royce, Jerry Lewis, Ken Calvert, Mary Bono Mack, and Darrell Issa.[21] He was also endorsed by two Republican U.S. Senators: John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC). He was also endorsed by Independent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman.[22][23] Sherman was endorsed by Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, former President Bill Clinton, and former Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis.[24] Brad Sherman - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Sherman 2 of 10 3/5/2017 6:10 PM\n\n3.

[31][32] Sherman was an original co-sponsor of The Employee Free Choice Act when it was introduced at the start of 2007, and again when it was re-introduced in 2009.[33] Sherman introduced legislation, in 2008 and 2010, to eliminate so-called state \"Right to Work\" laws nationwide.,[34] and he supports a single national standard that protects labor rights.

Congressman Sherman \"led the House revolt\" against the original $700 billion bailout plan, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).[40] Sherman introduced the \"Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act\", with regard to large financial entities.[41] Financial crisis During the debate over the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, (commonly referred to as \"the bailout of the U.S. financial system\"), Sherman was an early and outspoken critic of the proposal, leading the House revolt against the bailout bill, a move which made him \"spectacularly unpopular with both the Republican and Democratic leaderships, not to mention K Street\".[42] Sherman argued that Bush and his advisors had created a panic atmosphere in an effort to get lawmakers to rubber-stamp the bill.[43] Social Security and health care Sherman has said he is \"opposed to creating a voucher system for Medicare\". He wants to avoid \"turn[ing] Social Security into a welfare program\", instead keeping it \"for people who contribute to it\".[44] For his voting record and efforts in Congress, Sherman has consistently earned a 100% rating from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and from the AARP (American Association of Retired Persons).[32] Sherman supported the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Sherman helped secure funds to develop a new women and children's patient wing at El Proyecto del Barrio’s Family Health Care Clinic in Winnetka.[45] Housing Sherman introduced the Preserving Equal Access to Mortgage Finance Programs Act (HR 1754), which raises the conforming loan limit for FHA loans in high-cost areas such as Sherman's district.[46][47] Sherman frequently holds seminars for Valley residents in his district to address issues of home purchasing, home refinancing, and foreclosure avoidance.[48][49] Civil liberties Sherman's legislative record received a 100% rating from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in 2011, a 100% from the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 2007-2008, a 100% from the Human Rights Campaign in 2009-2010, and a 98% rating from the NAACP in 2009-2010.[50] Sherman co-sponsored the Due Process Guarantee Act,[51] which amends the Non-Detention Act of 1971 to provide that a Congressional authorization for the use of military force does not authorize the indefinite detention - without charge or trial - of U.S. citizens. In 2011, Sherman voted against the re-authorization of the Patriot Act[52] because of concerns that it would infringe on certain civil liberties, including the \"library provision\" that allows the FBI to acquire records about what books a person checks out from the library. Foreign relations In August 2010, Sherman introduced legislation aimed at rescinding China's Most Favored Nation status as long as there was not \"a more level playing field between our two nations\".[53] He said that \"the U.S.-China trade relationship is horrendously lopsided\".[53] Sherman has introduced or co-sponsored more than 20 bills in the 111th and 112th Congresses that he says, \"enact Brad Sherman - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Sherman 4 of 10 3/5/2017 6:10 PM\n\n5. tougher sanctions to isolate Iran economically and diplomatically\".[54] His efforts have included legislation designed to close loopholes for U.S. companies with subsidiaries operating in Iran, and to curtail U.S. funding of international organizations providing loans to Iran.[55] Sherman has been a strong supporter and advocate of the U.S-Israel relationship, consistently supporting aid to Israel.[56] In 2004, Brad Sherman first introduced the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act.[57] It provides grant money to joint ventures between American and Israeli academics and private sector companies that conduct research and develop energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies. On July 9, 2014, Sherman appeared as a guest commentator on the Al-Jazeera America’s network. During his appearance, Sherman went after the Qatar-based owners of Al-Jazeera, criticizing the owners for funding Hamas. Sherman said, \"Every one of those rockets [fired by Hamas into Israeli cities] is a war crime, almost every one. Of course it's a war crime committed by Hamas. And of course the owners of this TV network help fund Hamas.\" Sherman emphasized that Hamas often aims attacks at civilian targets.[58] The owners of Al-Jazeera that Sherman mentioned is the government of Qatar.[59] In December 2014, Sherman and Congressman Pete Roskam (R-IL) requested new sanctions on Qatar in a letter to Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew. They also asked for a detailed accounting of public and private financing from within Qatar for Hamas, Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, and the al-Nusra Front.[60] Sherman introduced legislation to exclusively allow Israel to be part of the visa waiver program, which would permit nationals from Israel to enter the US as temporary visitors for tourism or business for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa, without the conditions of reciprocity required for other nations. This led to criticism from some quarters that Sherman is insufficiently concerned with the rights of American citizens, in contrast to those of Israeli citizens.[61] As a senior member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Sherman has focused on Congressional recognition of the Armenian Genocide, as well as increasing funding to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.[62][63][64] Religion Sherman and his wife, who are Jewish, have been members of Valley Beth Shalom - a conservative synagogue in Encino, California - for many years.

Trump win the Electoral College. Sherman said, \"The fact is that in the campaign Trump said things that would have hurt him just a little bit with American voters, but helped him with the Electoral College votes that are controlled in Moscow. And Moscow returned the favor. The fact that — I would assume they didn’t do a secret meeting or secret found call doesn’t change that.\"[97] Personal life On December 3, 2006, Sherman married Lisa Nicola Kaplan, a foreign affairs officer for the U.S. State Department.[98] The couple’s first child, Molly Hannah Sherman, was born on January 14, 2009.[99] Their second child, Naomi Claire Sherman, was born on February 6, 2010.[100] Their third child, Lucy Rayna Sherman, was born on August 8, 2011.[101] References \"1.
