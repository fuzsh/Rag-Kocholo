Box 997410\n\nSacramento, CA 95899-7410\n\n(916) 445-2684\n\nInternet: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/Pages/Vital-Records.aspx\n\nAvailability of California records (all counties):\n\nBirths and deaths July 1905 to present (15 business days to process).\n\nMarriages 1998-1999 and 2010 to present (1 month to process).\n\nFor marriages that took place 1949-1986 it can take longer than 6 months to process, so it is recommended you request these records from Los Angeles county (see below).\n\nThe CDPH no longer processes requests for marriages that took place 1905-1948, 1987-1997, and 2000-2009 (you must go to Los Angeles county for these).\n\nDivorces 1962-June 1984, but this is only a limited abstract of the divorce, and it can take over 6 months to process (it is recommended you also go to Los Angeles county for these).\n\nAll records you get from CDPH are considered “Certified,” but you can choose between an “Authorized” copy and an “Informational” copy (they contain the same information, but Authorized has restrictions on who can obtain one; Informational is easier if you don’t need the record for official purposes)\n\nGet as much information as you can find from the following resources before you make your request:\n\nThe California Birth Records index 1905-1995 is available online at:\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org:443/search/collection/2001879?collectionNameFilter=false\n\nSome indexing on deaths prior to 1905 is available online at:\n\nhttps://www.rootsweb.com/~cabf1905/counties.htm\n\nThe California Death Records index 1905-1939 is available online at:\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org:443/search/collection/1932433?collectionNameFilter=false\n\nThe index number you’ll find here will apply to the Sacramento collection of records (not county-level)\n\nThe California Death Records index 1940-1997 is available online at:\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org:443/search/collection/2015582?collectionNameFilter=false\n\nThe California Divorce index 1966-1984 is available online at:\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org:443/search/collection/2015584?collectionNameFilter=false\n\nFamilySearch.org\n\nThe Family History Library has been digitizing vital records, and they have several for Los Angeles County available for free online. Here, for example, is how you can find a death certificate:\n\nGet the death place and date information from an index first (see resources above for this)\n\nFrom the www.familysearch.org home page, click:\n\nSearch >\n\nBrowse All Published Collections >\n\nUnited States of America >\n\nCalifornia >\n\nCalifornia, County Birth and Death Records, 1800-1994 >\n\nscroll to the bottom and click “Browse through ____ images.”\n\nDO NOT PUT YOUR PERSON’S NAME IN THE SEARCH BLANK!\n\nChoose your county or city (“Los Angeles” for L.A. county; “Los Angeles, Los Angeles” for the city of L.A.).\n\nScroll to the bottom of this big list of birth and death certificates to find the INDEX for your time frame and open it.\n\nFind your person alphabetically, and then note his/her index number.\n\nClick back to get to the main list of all the birth and death certificates and choose the year and index range for your person, and click. You will be able to find your person by the INDEX NUMBER.\n\nThe index number you may find in the state-level California Death Index will not correspond with these death certificates because these are county-level; you need to use the index number found in this data set.\n\nAncestry.com\n\nFor persons you find in the California Birth Index and California Death Index 1940-1997, you can order a copy of the death certificate via ancestry.com for a fee. Just go to Ancestry.com and find your person by using keywords (name) and other info you have. Then click “Order Original Document from VitalChek” on the left side of the record.\n\nLos Angeles Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk\n\n12400 Imperial Highway\n\nNorwalk, CA 90650\n\n(562) 462-2137 or (800) 201-8999\n\nInternet: https://www.lavote.net/home/records\n\nAvailability of Los Angeles County records:\n\nBirths 1866 to present\n\nDeaths 1877 to present\n\nMarriage 1852 to present\n\nIn 1971, confidential marriages became an option in addition to conventional marriages.
