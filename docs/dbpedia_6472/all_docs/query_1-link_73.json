        "text": "Younger siblings are used to hand-me-down clothes and furniture.\n\nRep. Brad Sherman’s youngest daughter is getting secondhand jokes, too.\n\nThe California Democrat and his wife, Lisa, didn’t head back to the West Coast during recess because they were expecting their third child.\n\nOn Aug. 8, Lucy Rayna Sherman was born in Washington — “but she’s really a Valley Girl,” a birth announcement noted. (Sherman, like, totally represents the San Fernando Valley.)\n\nThe announcement also noted that “Mother and baby are doing fine. … And the father is expected to recover.”\n\nThat’s cute. It’s also totally borrowed from the birth announcement for Lucy’s older sister, Naomi.\n\nAccording to a Feb. 8, 2010, article in the Los Angeles Daily News, the Shermans used those same two jokes word for word in the birth announcement for their second daughter.\n\nGet used to it, kid. You’re the youngest of three.\n\nIn all seriousness, HOH wishes congrats to the happy family. (And for those keeping tabs at home: Lucy came in at 7 pounds, 9 ounces and measured 20 inches in length.)"
