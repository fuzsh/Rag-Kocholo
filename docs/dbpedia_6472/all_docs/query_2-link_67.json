        "text": "Click here to view the funeral service for Minnie Sherman via livestream.\n\nMinnie Faye Sherman, beloved wife, mother, grandmother, and sister was born on July 12, 1932, in Powell (Boone Hollow), Missouri. She peacefully passed away on June 9, 2024, at the age of 91.\n\nIn 1968, Minnie and her husband Paul Sherman moved from Joplin, MO, and made their home in Pryor, Oklahoma, where they established the Foremost Milk Distributorship and later built, owned, and operated the Sirloin Express Restaurant. Together, they created a beautiful life full of family, faith, and friendship.\n\nMinnie was preceded in death by her loving husband Paul Sherman, her parents Robert James and Stella Cooper, her sons Mike Sherman and Brad Sherman, her daughter-in-law Rosetta Sherman, her grandson Corey Sherman, and her sister Geraldine Daniels. Their legacy lives on in the hearts and memories of those who knew and loved them.\n\nShe is survived by her son Robert Laverne Sherman and his wife Sharon of Haslet, Texas, her daughter Paula Sherman of Pryor, her son Ray Sherman and his wife Sue of Pryor, her daughter-in-law Loretta Sherman of Pryor, her brother Bobby Cooper and wife Nancy of Carthage, MO, her sister-in-law Loretta Sherman Watson and husband Joe of Mission, Texas, and her grandchildren Chad Morris, Aubrey Marshall, Jill Sherman, Tracy Curtsinger, Claire Young, Kami Martin, Carrie Raymond, Beth Stutzman, Grant Sherman, and Garrett Sherman. She also leaves behind a cherished legacy of 25 great-grandchildren.\n\nMinnie will be remembered for her honesty, her spunk, her hard work, and her dedication to her family. She loved to play the piano, sing, and play a mean game of Pitch. She will be deeply missed and forever remembered for the impact she made on the lives of those around her.\n\nThe visitation will be at Shipman Funeral Home on Saturday, June 15th from 6:00-8:00 PM. Funeral services will be held at 3:00 PM on Sunday, June 16th, at Creekside Church in Pryor. There will be a family graveside interment the following day."
