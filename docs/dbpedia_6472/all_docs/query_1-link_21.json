        "text": "Earmarks\n\nSherman proposed $44 million in earmarks for fiscal year 2024, including:\n\n$4 million to Los Angeles Unified School District for “Los Angeles Unified School District Field Improvements”\n\n$3.8 million to City of Los Angeles for “City of Los Angeles - Alabama Court Renovations”\n\n$3.6 million to Los Angeles City Council for “San Fernando Valley Traffic Safety Improvements”\n\nView all requests and justifications on Sherman’s website »\n\nView analysis and download spreadsheet from Demand Progress Education Fund »\n\nThese are earmark requests which may or may not survive the legislative process to becoming law. Most representatives from both parties requested earmarks for fiscal year 2024. Across representatives who requested earmarks, the median total amount requested for this fiscal year was $39 million.\n\nEarmarks are federal expenditures, tax benefits, or tariff benefits requested by a legislator for a specific entity. Rather than being distributed through a formula or competitive process administered by the executive branch, earmarks may direct spending where it is most needed for the legislator's district. All earmark requests in the House of Representatives are published online for the public to review. We don’t have earmark requests for senators. The fiscal year begins on October 1 of the prior calendar year. Source: Appropriations.house.gov. Background: Earmark Disclosure Rules in the House\n\nEnacted Legislation\n\nSherman was the primary sponsor of 7 bills that were enacted:\n\nH.R. 4616 (117th): Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021\n\nH.R. 7440 (116th): Hong Kong Autonomy Act\n\nH.R. 7083 (116th): Hong Kong Autonomy Act\n\nH.R. 7000 (116th): Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act\n\nH.R. 4646 (109th): To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 7320 Reseda Boulevard in Reseda, California, as the “Coach John Wooden Post Office Building”.\n\nH.R. 5340 (107th): To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 5805 White Oak Avenue in Encino, California, as the “Francis Dayle ‘Chick’ Hearn Post Office”.\n\nH.R. 1794 (105th): For the relief of Mai Hoa “Jasmine” Salehi.\n\nView All »\n\nDoes 7 not sound like a lot? Very few bills are ever enacted — most legislators sponsor only a handful that are signed into law. But there are other legislative activities that we don’t track that are also important, including offering amendments, committee work and oversight of the other branches, and constituent services.\n\nWe consider a bill enacted if one of the following is true: a) it is enacted itself, b) it has a companion bill in the other chamber (as identified by Congress) which was enacted, or c) if at least about half of its provisions were incorporated into bills that were enacted (as determined by an automated text analysis, applicable beginning with bills in the 110th Congress)."
