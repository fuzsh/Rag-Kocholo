Forteen voted \"present\" and six didn't vote.[2]\n\nRepresentative Brad Sherman voted \"Nay\".[3]\n\nPopulist Caucus\n\nThe Populist Caucus was founded on February 11, 2009 in the United States House of Representatives by Democrat Bruce Braley of Iowa. The caucus originally included 26 other Democrats in the House. Brad Sherman joined some time afterwards.[4]\n\nVoted against cutting funding for ACORN\n\nIn September 2009, following the lead of their Senate colleagues, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to cut off funds to ACORN. the vote was 345-75. All of the 75 were Democrats, and included Brad Sherman. [5]\n\nParke Skelton support\n\nParke Skelton is one of California’s preeminent political campaign consultants. His firm, SG&A Campaigns, has run campaigns for scores of progressive Democratic candidates including Controller John Chiang, Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones, Secretary of State Debra Bowen, Congressmembers Karen Bass, Julia Brownley, Judy Chu, Alan Lowenthal, Adam Schiff, Brad Sherman and Hilda Solis, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and District Attorney Jackie Lacey.[6]\n\nCongressional Asian Pacific American Caucus\n\nIn May 2013, Brad Sherman was listed as an associate member the of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.[7]\n\n2012 election\n\nIn the 2012 election to Congress, Sherman faced fellow incumbent Howard Berman in the general election. The incumbent battle was the result of prior redistricting maps. Their race was characterized by intense campaigning and large sums of outside money.\n\nSherman defeated Berman by more than 20 points in the election.[8]\n\nIn 2013 Progressive Democrats of America assigned activists to deliver their material to almost every US Congressman and Senator, Russell Greene, was assigned as the contact for Rep. Sherman. In June it was Michael Goldman.[9]\n\nCongressional Letter for Neutrality, 2014 Salvadoran Elections\n\nOn Monday December 16, 2014 Reps. Juan Vargas (D-CA), Mike Honda (D-CA) and Mark Pocan (D-WI) sent a letter to Sec. of State John Kerry – signed by 51 Members of Congress – calling for a public statement of neutrality by the State Department before the first round of El Salvador’s presidential elections on February 2, 2014.\n\nThe letter, , highlighted several “important steps” that the current government has taken to “strengthen its democratic system and expand the right to vote to all citizens,” including those living outside of the country, who will be voting by absentee ballot for the first time in February. Since the election of Mauricio Funes, the first President from the Marxist Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) party, the government has increased the number of polling places four-fold to increase accessibility, especially in rural areas.\n\n“We’re glad to see so many Members of Congress expressing respect for the right of the Salvadoran people to determine their own future. That’s an attitude that’s sorely lacking in much of the US’ policy in Central America, especially with regard to economic policy,” said Alexis Stoumbelis, Executive Director for the pro-communist Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES), in Washington, DC, which has observed every post-war election in El Salvador, starting in 1994.\n\nSignatories included Rep.

July 30, 2019 ·\n\nOn Thursday July 25th, ICHRP-US and the Malaya Movement joined Congressman Brad Sherman and the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, The Pacific and Nonproliferation for a Hearing featuring the Philippines.\n\nSherman rightfully called the human rights situation in the Philippines “appalling.” Thank you Congressman Sherman for your leadership on this important issue! Thank you to all those in ICHRP-US, the Malaya Movement, Amnesty International and Ecumenical Advocacy Network for the Philippines for raising your voices to make this hear happen!\n\nOn Thursday, July 25, members of the Malaya Movement and ICHRP-US joined Chairman Brad Sherman and the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation for a hearing on Human Rights in South East Asia, featuring the Philippines.\n\nWhile Duterte’s administration has been vocal in its feedback to foreign governments who criticize his regime, Chairman Brad Sherman was blunt in his opening remarks, calling the human rights situation in the Philippines “appalling.”\n\n“This hearing is an important first step in the road to accountability over the human rights crisis in the Philippines,” states Drew Elizarde-Miller of ICHRP-US. “Our advocacy towards ensuring not a single US tax dollar is spent towards any form of human rights abuse in the Philippines does not end here. We will continue to advocate our lawmakers to stand with the Filipino people, especially the tens of thousands of victims of these abuses under the Duterte government and their families. This is just a beginning, there is more work to be done.”\n\nAt the hearing, Congressman Sherman recognized Beverly Longid, Chairperson of the Indigenous People's Movement for Self-Determination and Liberation. Longid, one of the activists listed on Duterte’s terror list that vilified human rights defenders, explained the human rights situation in the Philippines in an interview prior to the hearing: “One killing is one killing too many, especially if it’s done in the context of violating due process of law . . . it speaks of the danger human rights defenders or activists or anyone critical of the Philippine government face, where you can find yourself in a situation where you are arrested, incarcerated or probably dead.”\n\nFrancisco Bencosme, the Asia Pacific Advocacy Manager at Amnesty International, testified at the hearing. Bencosme’s testimony highlighted the recent killing of a three year old, Myka Ulpina, in the war on drugs, as well as the regime’s attacks on human rights defenders, including death threats on Cristina Palabay and other Karapatan human rights workers. Bencosme shared, “There is an urgent need, particularly in the context of extrajudicial killings and other human rights violations, to make this a priority.”\n\nAnn Wagner, Congresswoman from Missouri, raised the problem of threats on indigenous people. Wagner stated, “I am especially concerned about the plight of indigenous people in the Philippines. In Mindanao, which has been under Martial law since May of 2017, the Duterte Administration has committed these extrajudicial, illegal killings, illegal arrests, and attacks on indigenous schools set up in partnership with NGO’s.”\n\nBencosme elaborated on government attacks on the indigenous people and human rights defenders: “The way the Philippines government acts is it red-tags them — legitimate organizations — or it brands them as communist fronts, which has led to an increase in harassment or attacks by unknown individuals against them.”\n\nDuring an interview, Longid further explained the impact on indigenous people: “The attacks have been relentless because we have been facing intensified intrusion into our ancestral lands because of the government’s ‘Build Build Build’ policy that would bring in destructive projects like mining, corporate energy projects and plantations. Alongside the ‘Build Build Build’ policy is Duterte’s ‘kill kill kill’ policy against people who are resisting, dissenting, or critical to his policy or programs.”\n\nDeemed a “a major non-NATO ally” by Congressman Sherman, the United States maintains strong economic and military interests in the region, sending 193.5 million dollars in aid to the Philippine military and police in 2018 alone. Even this amount is just one aspect of military aid to the Philippines — this number does not include arms sales, donated equipment of unreported worth, nor the costs of annual joint trainings like the Balikatan exercises. In a statement, Ecumenical Advocacy Network on the Philippines, made recommendations on how to deal with U.S. support of Philippine military and police.\n\nCongressman Gerry Connolly of Virginia noted the importance of U.S. opposition to Duterte’s crimes, saying, “by not speaking out, he [President Trump] has, in fact, sadly encouraged Duterte and his vigilantes to persist, if not expand, their gross violations of human rights.”\n\n“Now that US lawmakers have posed their questions, it’s time to investigate what is happening on the ground to get the answers,” states Yves Nibungco of Malaya Movement. “A US Congressional investigation on how exactly US aid to the Philippines, particularly to the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police, is spent should be conducted, in order to make certain such aid is uplifting the lives of the Filipino people and safeguarding human rights and democracy. Until then we call on US aid to the Philippine be withheld or for a temporary moratorium pending such an investigation.”[12]\n\nAnnounced Hearing on the Philippines\n\nMalaya Movement July 19, 2019 ·\n\nFilipino-Americans, Advocates Welcome Announcement of US Congressional Hearing Examining Human Rights Situation in the Philippines.\n\nJoint Statement of the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines-U.S. and the Malaya Movement.\n\nOn Thursday July 18, Congressman Brad Sherman, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation announced the committee will hold a hearing featuring the Philippines on Thursday, July 25th. The hearing will cover three other countries in Southeast Asia in addition to the Philippines-- Vietnam, Cambodia, and Rohingya.\n\nThe announcement of the hearing comes a week after the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution calling for a comprehensive investigation into the human rights situation in the Philippines. Since his election in 2016 and the most recent midterm election this past May, which was wrought with massive cheating and fraud to ensure Duterte candidates control the Philippine Senate, Duterte’s near 30,000 killings have earned the attention of international and governmental bodies including the UN, International Criminal Court, and now members of Congress.\n\nAlong with Duterte’s infamous war on drugs, Duterte’s regime has committed widespread attacks against human rights defenders, trade unionists, women, church people, farmers and indigenous people -- Duterte’ repression is nationwide. Recent examples include the murder of a three year old Myca Ulpina, in a police drug operation, the massacre of 14 farmers in Negros in a joint operation between military and police, and the recent government shut down of 55 schools serving indigenous children in the hinterlands.\n\n“The Philippines can feel so far from the San Fernando Valley, but when friends and family become victims of Duterte’s human rights abuses, it hits close to home,” said Dominico Vega, member of Malaya Movement in Southern California and a constituent of Representative Sherman. Vega’s close friends, two Filipino Long Beach-based journalists, Eric Tandoc and Hiyas Saturay, experienced Duterte’s repression directly when arrested while filming a workers strike in the Philippines.\n\nVega is one of many Filipinos in the Malaya movement who have been drawing congressional attention to human rights violations under the Duterte administration and advocating for a hearing alongside advocacy groups such as the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines, the Ecumenical Advocacy Network on the Philippines, and Amnesty International. In April, over 400 rights advocates gathered in Washington D.C. and lobbied 100 offices to call for a congressional hearing, restrictions on aid to the Philippine military and police, and support for House Resolution 233 and Senate Resolution 142 to free Amnesty International prisoner of conscience Senator Leila de Lima, an outspoken critic of Philippine President Duterte.\n\n“We applaud Congressman Brad Sherman for initiating a hearing that will cover the human rights situation in the Philippines. As people in the United States who advocate for peace and justice here, in the Philippines, and around the world, we oppose any form of aid that supports Duterte’s attacks on the people in the Philippines,” said Pam Tau Lee, Chairperson of ICHRP-US.[13]\n\nBrandon Lee connection\n\nICHRP US International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines is with Tinay Palabay, Malaya Movement, Ann Wagner, Brad Sherman, August 8 2019·\n\nThe attacks in the Philippines, most recently against Brandon Lee, continue despite the advocacy of Congressman Brad Sherman and all those who have worked for congressional action on the human rights situation in the Philippines. We uphold our call: End U.S. Support of the Duterte Regime!\n\nMeeting with ICHRP\n\nICHRP US International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines· July 3 2019·\n\nThank you, Congressman Brad Sherman!\n\nPalabay meeting\n\nOn Tuesday, March 19, 2019 over 100 people gathered near Historic Filipinotown to hear renowned human rights advocate, Tinay Palabay, the Secretary General of leading human rights alliance in the Philippines, Karapatan, speak about the rising deaths and human rights abuses orchestrated by the Duterte regime and urge Filipinos and allies to demand the U.S. Congress and President Trump immediately cut military aid and political support for Duterte.\n\nPalabay concluded her U.S. speaking tour this week with a meeting with the office of Congressman Brad Sherman (CA-30), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Palabay’s speaking tour organized by International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines (ICHRP) and Amnesty International. Her Los Angeles stop was in partnership with the MALAYA Movement.\n\nThe following is from Tinay Palabay, Secretary General of Karapatan:\n\n“The American people are in a unique position to act, to end these human rights violations by the Philippine government. In 2007, former Senator Barbara Boxer conducted a hearing on the human rights situation in the Philippines, where it was resolved that the U.S. should cut its military aid to deter the human rights abuses. It’s high time to mobilize the most number of people to demand your senators and congress members to initiate those hearings again and cut military aid to the Philippines.\n\n“But the more important thing is the solidarity and organizing we can muster against not only people like Duterte, because we should move from politics that look only at personalities and presidents. It’s high time we look deeper into the root causes of why extrajudicial killings persist, why our people are still poor, why 5,000 Filipinos leave the country daily, and why the system has enabled people like Duterte to rise in power. In that journey of unpacking the reasons why, we should move forward through various forms of resistance.”\n\nThe following is from Giselle Tongi, National Convener of the MALAYA Movement:\n\n“There are so many things to say about President Duterte, his foul mouth, his machismo-fascism, but it is the number of deaths already under his regime that has made his name internationally infamous. More than 29,000 people have been killed for even just being a suspect in his notorious Drug War. He is a dictator.\n\n“People ask me, why should people in the U.S. care? Filipinos back home are under siege, and with four million Filipinos in the United states, we actually have the power to fight alongside them. The People Power movement took down the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. We as MALAYA are asking our fellow kababayan and allies to join the growing movement against Duterte's fascist regime and be part of fighting for genuine democracy and peace in the Philippines.”\n\nEarlier this year, President Trump signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, S.2736 and the House version H.B. 6888, which authorizes $1.5 billion in military funding to the region, including the Philippines, over the next five years. As U.S. tax-funded aid to the AFP and PNP has been heavily associated with rampant human rights violations and killings in Philippines, human rights groups are calling for a congressional hearing to ensure that the additional funding under this bill does not contribute to increased killings and other violations of human rights of Filipinos. In 2018 alone, Congress approved $184.5 million in aid that goes straight to the current regime’s police and military. The MALAYA Movement plans to host a national Summit for Human Rights and Democracy in the Philippines this upcoming April 6th-8th, 2018 in Washington D.C. to continue lobbying efforts to advocate for the end of US military and police aid to the Duterte regime.[14]\n\nH.Res.233\n\nCondemning the Government of the Philippines for its continued detention of Senator Leila De Lima, calling for her immediate release, and for other purposes.\n\nWhereas extrajudicial killings perpetrated by the Government of the Philippines as part of a Government-directed antidrug campaign present the foremost human rights challenge in the Philippines;\n\nWhereas the Department of State’s 2017 Human Rights Report notes numerous human rights concerns, including the persecution of human rights defenders and the detention of political prisoners in the Philippines, stating, “The most significant human rights issues included: killings by security forces, vigilantes and others allegedly connected to the government, and by insurgents; torture and abuse of prisoners and detainees by security forces; often harsh and life threatening prison conditions; warrantless arrests by security forces and cases of apparent government disregard for legal rights and due process; political prisoners; killings of and threats against journalists; official corruption and abuse of power; threats of violence against human rights activists; violence against women; and forced labor.”;\n\nSponsor: Rep.

Among other things, the bill calls for serious, urgent diplomatic engagement in pursuit of a binding peace agreement constituting a formal end to the Korean War.\n\nIn 1953, the parties to the Korean War signed an Armistice Agreement that pledged an end to “all acts of armed force in Korea until a final peaceful settlement is achieved.” Common sense tells us that this conflict ended in July 1953. But in fact, we only signed an armistice. Therefore, we technically remain in a state of war with North Korea. This situation does not serve anyone’s interest.\n\nThe Peace on the Korean Peninsula Act also expresses the sense of Congress that given such commitments made at Panmunjom and Singapore, the Secretary of State should seek to enter into negotiations with North Korea to establish liaison offices of the DPRK and the United States in the respective capitals of each such country.\n\nOne major consequence of the continuation of the Korean War is that the United States does not have formal relations with North Korea. The current restrictions barring United States nationals from traveling to North Korea have had profound effects on Americans with relatives living in North Korea. The Peace on the Korean Peninsula Act requires the Secretary of State to conduct a full review of the restrictions in place conditioning the travel of Americans to North Korea, and to submit a report to Congress detailing such a review. The review shall examine:\n\nthe nature of travel to North Korea that qualifies as ‘‘in the national interest’’ of the United States;\n\nthe ‘‘compelling humanitarian considerations’’ that qualify a United States national for travel to North Korea; and,\n\nwhether travel to North Korea for the purposes of attending to or witnessing funerals, burials, or other religious and family commemorations of relatives of United States nationals does or should qualify as ‘‘compelling humanitarian considerations’’ meriting issuance of Special Validation Passports to such individuals.\n\n“The continued state of war on the Korean Peninsula does not serve the interests of the United States nor our constituents with relations in North and South Korea,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “Serious, urgent diplomatic engagement is needed to achieve peace between North and South Korea. Many do not realize that there are approximately 100,000 Americans with relatives living in North Korea. A comprehensive review of our restrictions on travel to North Korea is necessary so that Korean Americans can attend major family events, such as funerals, burials, or other religious and family commemorations in North Korea.”\n\nCongressman Sherman is pleased to be joined his colleagues Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA), Representative Andy Kim (D-NJ), and Representative Grace Meng (D-NY) in introducing the Peace on the Korean Peninsula Act.[16]\n\nSpeakers\n\nKorean American Public Action Committee speakers July 2021.\n\nYoungsun Park Minister of Small Business ROK\n\nKC Choi President Korean American Public Action Committee\n\nTaehwan Kwak Former President of Korea Institute for National Unification\n\nRep.

Song Young-gil, the head of a task force on Korean Peninsula issues, is leading a three-member DP delegation on a six-day trip to Washington this week to meet with U.S. officials as well as congressmen and policy experts close to Biden.\n\n“In order for the denuclearization of North Korea, currently facing a triple handicap, prompt humanitarian aid, the easing of sanctions on the condition of a snapback clause and a phased solution is the only realistic solution,” Song's office quoted him as telling Rep. Sherman of California, during the talks at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington.\n\nSherman was quoted by Song’s office as replying that it is important to prevent a provocation by North Korea in the first 100 days of the new U.S. administration.\n\nThe Biden administration will “boldly take realistic measures to progress North Korea’s denuclearization after spring next year,” he was quoted as saying.\n\nHe also conveyed that he would like to see North-U.S. parliamentary talks, if Pyongyang consents, as the two sides discussed realistic ways to revive denuclearization negotiations.\n\nSherman has publicly supported the continuation of the denuclearization of North Korea over the years, and in a recent Korean American Public Action Committee (KAPAC) forum said that he backed a declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War as well as the installation of a Pyongyang-Washington liaison office.\n\nSong, a human rights lawyer and five-term lawmaker, previously served as Incheon major from 2010 to 2014. The Korean delegation also includes DP Reps. Kim Han-jung and Youn Kun-young.\n\nThe DP lawmakers also met with Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat of New Jersey, who was recently re-elected to a second term. The Korean-American congressman previously served in the U.S. State Department and as a National Security Council official under the Barack Obama administration.\n\nKim likewise relayed to the lawmakers that he would gladly convey any message to President-elect Joe Biden, according to Song’s office, indicating he is willing to play a liaison role between the Blue House and White House.\n\nThe Korean Peninsula task force has been using parliamentary diplomacy to reach out to figures close to President-elect Biden on the heels of the U.S. election earlier this month. They have stressed the importance of continuing denuclearization negotiations with North Korea to enable permanent peace on the peninsula.\n\nThey planned to meet with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, who doubles as special representative for North Korea, on Tuesday in Washington.[18]\n\nKAPAC delegation\n\nKAPAC 2020 Korea Peace Forum\n\nPanellists Son Young-Gil, Brad Sherman, Kim Kyung-Hyup, Andy Kim.\n\nKorean Parliamentary delegation\n\nCongressman Brad Sherman May 22, 2019 ·\n\nI met with members of the South Korean National Assembly yesterday, including Sye-kyun Chung, Byoung Gug Choung, Jin-Pyo Kim, Woo-Taik Chung, and Soo-Hyuck Lee.

The historic vote represents the first time that Congress has taken a stand on the need to end the nearly 70-year-old Korean War.\n\nThis amendment, led by Representatives Khanna and Sherman, recognizes that diplomacy is essential for navigating a realistic path forward on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and that a formal end to the Korean War plays a critical role toward that goal\n\n“This vote is a game changer,” said Christine Ahn, Executive Director of Women Cross DMZ. “It’s a clear sign that the American people want an end to the oldest U.S. conflict, and that ending decades of hostilities with a peace agreement is the only way to resolve the nuclear crisis.”\n\n“A peace agreement to end the Korean War offers a clear path, if not the only path, for real progress towards the goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula,” said Paul Kawika Martin, senior director for policy and political affairs at Peace Action.\n\n“Diplomacy is the only way to achieve peace on the Korean peninsula and begin the process of phasing out North Korea’s nuclear weapons program,” said Win Without War Advocacy Director Erica Fein.\n\n“We applaud the passage of this historic vote, which recognizes that ending the Korean War is essential for addressing the challenge of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. It is clearly in the national security interests of the United States and our South Korean ally to expand diplomacy and pursue a changed relationship with North Korea,” said Ploughshares Fund’s Senior Program Officer John Carl Baker and Roger Hale Fellow Catherine Killough.\n\n“The Korean War is often called the “Forgotten War” in the US, but it is a daily reality for the Korean people. This vote is a commendable step by Congress to address the root causes of conflict and end a 70-year-old war; a step that certainly moves us along the right path toward a more peaceful, prosperous Korean Peninsula,” said Daniel Jasper, the Asia Advocacy Coordinator for the American Friends Service Committee.[19]\n\nKAPAC connection\n\nRep. Brad Sherman April 26, 2019.\n\nToday, the President of KAPAC, KC Choi, and the Executive Director of the Korean American Forum of California, Phyllis Kim, met with me and my foreign affairs advisor, John Brodtke, to discuss recent developments in the peace process on the Korean Peninsula. #KAPAC\n\nNorth Korea resolution\n\nAs of Oct. 23, 2020 the number of US congressmen who support a resolution calling for the official end of the Korean War and the adoption of a peace treaty with North Korea increased to 51. Al Green, a Democrat from Texas, and Katie Porter, a Democrat from California, became the 50th and 51st members of congress to sign the resolution.\n\nBrad Sherman, a Democrat from California; Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from Texas; and GregMeeks, a Democrat from New York, the nominees for the next chair of the US Committee on Foreign Affairs, have all voiced support for the resolution. That makes it more likely that the resolution will be a major agenda item for the committee, no matter which of the three ends up as its chair.\n\n“While North Korea and the US aren’t currently engaged in dialogue, this kind of progress speaks volumes. It’s notable that more and more people want North Korea-US issues to be tackled through peace and diplomacy rather than through tension and pressure,” said Hyun Lee, US national organizer for Women Cross DMZ.[20]\n\nSherman's website with the House of Representatives"
