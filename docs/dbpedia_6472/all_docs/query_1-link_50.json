As of November 8th, he was elected to be our congressman.\n\nBrad knows of Bel-Air's opposition to Metro's poorly thought out consideration of building a mind boggling expensive and potentially dangerous subway under our community. Brad is hitting the ground running in his representation of our community as evidenced by the attached letter he sent to Metro this week.\n\nThe Bel-Air Association looks forward to working closely with our new congressman, Brad Sherman!\n\nBest,\n\nJamie Meyer, President Bel-Air Association"
