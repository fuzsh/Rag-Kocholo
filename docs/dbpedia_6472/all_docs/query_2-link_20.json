Signed/Enacted/Adopted HR117 A resolution recognizing and congratulating University of Northern Iowa A Resolution recognizing and congratulating University of Northern Iowa (UNI) wrestler Parker Keckeisen for his outstanding wrestling accomplishments. Signed/Enacted/Adopted HF2243 A bill for an act relating to the adoption tax credit available against the individual income tax, and including effective date and retroactive applicability provisions.(See HF 2637.) This bill relates to the adoption tax credit available against the individual income tax. Currently, the tax credit equals up to $5,000 of qualified adoption expenses per adoption. The bill increases the tax credit to equal up to $20,000 of qualified adoption expenses per adoption. Any credit in excess of the tax liability is refundable. “Qualified adoption expenses” means unreimbursed expenses paid or incurred in connection with the adoption of a child, including medical and hospital expenses of the biological mother which are incident to the child’s birth, welfare agency fees, legal fees, and all other fees and costs which relate to the adoption of a child. “Child” means an individual under 18 years of age. Current law in Code section 422.12A(4) determines the tax year when qualified adoption expenses are allowed. The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, for adoptions finalized on or after that date. Dead HF2255 A bill for an act relating to parental authorization for minors to create accounts on social media platforms, providing civil penalties, and including applicability provisions.(See HF 2523.) This bill relates to parental authorization for minors to create accounts on social media platforms. The bill requires a social media company (company) to obtain parental authorization before permitting a minor to create an account on the company’s platform, and, upon request, to allow a parent or guardian to revoke or rescind the grant of parental authorization at any time. “Social media company”, “parental authorization”, “minor”, and “social media platform” are defined in the bill. The bill prohibits the collection, transfer, transmission, imaging, or retention of data related to a minor by a company if the company has not received parental authorization, and prohibits a company from allowing a minor to create or use an account on the social media platform if the minor is prohibited from doing so by any other provision of state or federal law. The bill requires a company to provide a parent or guardian who has granted parental authorization with a password or other means to access the account of the minor to allow the parent or guardian to view all posts created by the minor, view all messages and responses sent or received by the minor, control the privacy and account settings of the minor’s account, and monitor and limit the amount of time the minor may spend using the social media platform. The bill permits the attorney general to bring a civil action for a violation of the bill and the court to assess a civil penalty against a company of up to $1,000 per violation. A person harmed by a company’s violation of the bill may bring a civil action in district court and, upon a finding that a company violated the bill, a district court may order damages in an amount equal to the greater of either $10,000 for each violation, or the amount of actual damages for any financial, physical, and emotional harm to the person if the court determines that the company’s violation was the direct cause of the harm. The court may also order punitive damages, reasonable attorney fees, and court costs. The attorney general shall adopt rules to administer the bill, including but not limited to rules to establish the processes or means by which a company can comply with the parental authorization requirements, acceptable forms or methods of parental authorization, and the processes to confirm that a company has received parental authorization for each minor that has created an account on the platform. The bill applies to a company operating in the state on or after the effective date of the bill. Dead HF2330 A bill for an act relating to education, including by modifying provisions related to the social studies instruction provided to students enrolled in grades one through twelve and the educational programs provided by the institutions of higher education under the control of the state board of regents.(See HF 2544.) This bill relates to education by modifying provisions related to the social studies instruction provided to students enrolled in grades 1 through 12 and the educational programs provided by the institutions of higher education under the control of the state board of regents. The bill provides that the social studies curriculum provided to students enrolled in grades one through six in school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, charter schools, and innovation zone schools shall include instruction related to the workings of the federal, state, and local levels of government; the rights and responsibilities of citizens of the United States and the state of Iowa; the history of the secular and religious ideals and institutions of liberty; exemplary figures in western civilization, the United States, and the state of Iowa; the cultural heritage of western civilization, the United States, and the state of Iowa; the geography of the United States and the state of Iowa; the history and meaning of the United States flag and the national anthem, and certain specified admirable Americans. The bill makes similar changes to the social studies curriculum provided to students enrolled in grades 7 through 12, but adds instructional requirements related to the study of prominent persons and prominent writings. The bill also provides that the social studies curriculum provided in grades seven and eight is to include at least one semester of instruction, or the trimester or quarter equivalent, in civics, United States history, the history of western civilization, Iowa history, and economics. The bill establishes what such instruction is to include. Current law requires school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and charter schools to offer and teach five units of social studies in grades 9 through 12, which includes a minimum of one-half unit of United States government and one unit of United States history. The bill requires all students to complete a minimum of one-half unit of United States government, one unit of civics, two units of United States history, and one unit of western civilization. The bill establishes prohibitions and requirements related to this instruction, including required examinations and topics of instruction and prohibitions related to including forms of political activism in civics instruction. The bill provides that the social studies curriculum is required to incorporate the study of certain specified documents that are important to the history of the United States. The bill provides that these changes shall not affect the graduation requirements applicable to a student enrolled in grades 9 through 12 as of the effective date of the bill. The bill requires the state board of regents to direct the institutions of higher education under its control to adopt policies that require all students admitted to the baccalaureate degree program provided by the institution to take a civic literacy examination. The bill provides that, if a student does not pass the examination, the institution shall require the student to take a remedial civics course that contains a culminating civic literacy examination. If the student fails to pass this examination as well, the bill provides that the student may retake the examination, but the student will not be allowed to graduate from the institution, or progress to more advanced civics courses, until the student passes the examination. The bill requires the state board of regents to prohibit the institutions of higher education under its control from awarding students any semester hours of credit for courses that require action civics or political activism. The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a school district from complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore, school districts are required to comply with any state mandate included in the bill. Dead HF2031 A bill for an act incorporating provisions related to pregnancy and fetal development into the human growth and development and health curriculum provided by school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, charter schools, and innovation zone schools to students enrolled in grades one through twelve.(See HF 2617.) This bill incorporates provisions related to pregnancy and fetal development into the human growth and development and health curriculum provided by school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, charter schools, and innovation zone schools to students enrolled in grades 1 through 12. The bill requires that the human growth and development curriculum provided by school districts, nonpublic schools, charter schools, and innovation zone schools in grades 1 through 8, and the health curriculum in grades 9 through 12, include instruction regarding human biology related to pregnancy and human development inside the womb. The bill also requires that such curriculum include a video, at least three minutes in duration, showing the development of the brain, heart, sex organs, and other vital organs in early fetal development, and a rendering or animation, comparable to the meet baby Olivia video developed by live action, showing the process of fertilization and every stage of human development inside the uterus, noting significant markers in cell growth and organ development for every significant marker of pregnancy until birth. Dead HF2199 A bill for an act relating to health care employment agencies, including the statewide maximum allowable charges schedule applicable to nursing services provided by health care employment agency workers, providing penalties, and including effective date and retroactive applicability provisions.(See HF 2391.) This bill relates to health care employment agencies (agency), including the maximum allowable charges an agency may charge a health care entity for nursing services provided by a health care employment agency worker (agency worker). The bill defines terms used in the bill, including “health care employment agency” which includes a “health care technology platform” as defined in the bill; “individual agency worker category” which includes specified health professionals who are agency workers, and “nursing services professionals” which includes the same specified health professionals who are not agency workers but are instead employed directly by, or contract directly with, a health care entity. The bill requires the department of health and human services (HHS) to annually establish and publish by September 30, a statewide maximum allowable charges schedule (charges schedule) applicable January 1 of the following calendar year to nursing services provided by agency workers. The amounts established in the charges schedule must be no greater than 150 percent of the statewide average wage paid in the most recently preceding cost report year by a specific type of health care entity to a nursing services professional, within a specific nursing services professional category, and within the applicable core-based statistical area of the state; and must be inclusive of the hourly rate, administrative fees, contract fees, transportation or travel stipends, per diems, and any other costs an agency is authorized to include in the charge to a health care entity for nursing services provided by an agency worker within an individual agency worker category. The bill requires each separate location of an agency registered in the state to utilize and comply with the charges schedule established under the bill. The bill directs HHS in cooperation with the department of inspections, appeals, and licensing (DIAL) to adopt administrative rules to administer these provisions of the bill. The bill prohibits an agency from using the establishment of, or the required applicability of, the charges schedule as a basis for prohibiting or otherwise interfering with a wage increase for any agency worker. The bill amends current penalties under Code chapter 135Q and includes new penalties for violations of provisions included in the bill. The bill provides that an agency that violates Code section 135Q.2(1) (relating to required registration and the prohibition against contracting with a health care entity in the state if the agency is not registered), or Code section 135Q.2(4) (relating to submitting quarterly reports to DIAL), is subject to an initial monetary penalty of $5,000 and shall be provided notification and given a 30-day grace period in which to comply. If the agency fails to comply following the notification and within the 30-day grace period, the agency shall be subject to a monetary penalty of $25,000. If the agency continues the noncompliance, the agency shall be subject to an additional monetary penalty of $25,000, revocation of registration, and denial of subsequent registration for up to three years. The bill also provides that an agency that violates Code section 135Q.2(2) (relating to certain prohibited restrictions on agency workers or health care entities and contracting prohibitions), or that knowingly provides an agency worker who has an illegally or fraudulently obtained or issued diploma, registration, license, certification, or background check to a health care entity is subject to a monetary penalty of $5,000 for each violation, and to immediate revocation of registration. If the agency commits a second or subsequent violation within any three-year period, the health care employment agency shall be subject to immediate revocation of registration. Under the bill, an agency that violates Code section 135Q.2(3) (relating to contracting with agency workers and health care entities) is subject to a monetary penalty of $25,000 for a first offense, and to immediate revocation of registration and denial of registration for the three-year period following revocation for a second or subsequent violation. An agency that violates Code section 135Q.3 (relating to requirements regarding the statewide allowable charges schedule), shall be subject to a monetary penalty of $5,000 for the first violation and a monetary penalty of $25,000 for each subsequent violation. The bill also provides that the managing entity of an agency for which registration has been denied or revoked shall not be eligible to apply for or be granted registration for another agency during the three-year period following the date of the denial or revocation; and DIAL shall not approve a new registration or renew an existing registration for any agency for which the managing entity is also the managing entity of an agency for which registration has been denied or revoked during the three-year period in which registration of the violating agency is denied or revoked. The bill provides that any monetary penalties collected shall be retained by DIAL as repayment receipts as defined in Code section 8.2. The bill requires DIAL to submit an annual report to the general assembly by January 15, for the immediately preceding fiscal year, that includes a summary of the number of registrations issued and the amount of registration fees collected, the violations of the chapter, the amount of monetary penalties collected, the number of health care employment agencies and managing entities for whom a registration was revoked or denied, the charges schedule, and any recommendations for changes to the Code chapter. The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to any contract between a health care employment agency and an agency worker or health care entity referred to under the bill that was entered into or executed on or after January 1, 2019.

Dead HF2256 A bill for an act relating to the treatment of an unborn child for the purposes of damages for wrongful death, the defense of compulsion, homicide and related crimes, and assault, making penalties applicable, and including effective date and applicability provisions. This bill relates to the treatment of an unborn child for purposes of damages for wrongful death, certain crimes, and certain defenses. The bill provides the purposes of the bill. The bill amends Code section 633.336 (damages for wrongful death) to provide that damages for wrongful death of a child shall include the wrongful death of an unborn child, as defined in the bill to mean an individual organism of the species homo sapiens from fertilization to fetal death or live birth. The bill amends Code section 704.10 (compulsion) to provide that an act, other than an act by which one intentionally or recklessly causes physical injury to another, is not a public offense if the person so acting, including a pregnant woman acting relative to her unborn child under Code chapter 707 (homicide or related crimes) or 708 (assault), is compelled to do so by another’s threat or menace of serious injury, provided that the person reasonably believes that such injury is imminent and can be averted only by the person doing such act. The bill creates new Code section 707.1A (homicide and related crimes —— unborn child victim) that provides that for the purpose of Code chapter 707 (homicide and related crimes), “person” includes an unborn child when the person is the victim of the crime. The new Code section provides that prosecution of a crime under Code chapter 707, when the victim is an unborn child, is subject to the same presumptions, defenses, justifications, immunities, clemencies, and other due process protections that would apply if the victim were a person following a live birth. The Code section shall not apply to the unintentional death of an unborn child resulting from the performance of life-saving procedures to save the life of a pregnant woman when accompanied by reasonable steps, if available, to save the life of the unborn child; or to a miscarriage. If a provision of law conflicts with the new Code section, the new Code section prevails. The bill also creates new Code section 708.1A (assault on an unborn child). The new Code section provides that for the purpose of Code chapter 708 (assault), “person” includes an unborn child when the person is the victim of the crime. The new Code section provides that prosecution of a crime under Code chapter 708, when the victim is an unborn child, is subject to the same presumptions, defenses, justifications, immunities, clemencies, and other due process protections that would apply if the victim were a person following a live birth. The Code section shall not apply to the unintentional death of or harm to an unborn child resulting from the performance of life-saving procedures to save the life of a pregnant woman when accompanied by reasonable steps, if available, to save the life of the unborn child; or to a miscarriage. If a provision of law conflicts with the new Code section, the new Code section prevails. The bill takes effect upon enactment. The bill applies only to conduct or an act occurring on or after the effective date of the bill. Dead HF2122 A bill for an act relating to certification requirements for the provision of abortion-inducing drugs, providing penalties, and providing effective date provisions. This bill relates to certification requirements relating to the provision of abortion-inducing drugs. The bill provides definitions used in the bill and creates a new Code chapter that applies to any physician, health care provider, manufacturer, distributor, pharmacy, or other person providing abortion-inducing drugs within the state. The bill provides that the board of pharmacy shall create an abortion-inducing drug certification program to provide oversight and to regulate the provision of abortion-inducing drugs in the state. Abortion-inducing drugs shall be transported and provided in the state at wholesale only by certified manufacturers or distributors; abortion-inducing drugs shall only be provided to patients by certified physicians; and abortion-inducing drugs shall not be provided directly to a patient outside of the program including through the mail. The bill directs the board of pharmacy to establish a certification system with certain minimum measures relating to manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and physicians who provide abortion-inducing drugs in the state. The bill specifies requirements of manufacturers, distributors, physicians, and pharmacists who provide abortion-inducing drugs in the state under the state certification program. The bill requires that a physician certified under the bill either shall maintain hospital admitting privileges at one or more hospitals in the county or a contiguous county where the abortion-inducing drug is provided by the physician or enter into a written agreement with an associated physician who has such privileges. The bill specifies the requirements for such written agreement. The bill requires the board of pharmacy to create an electronically based reporting system for physicians certified under the bill to report annually certain information regarding the provision of abortion-inducing drugs. The bill also requires emergency department physicians and other physicians who treat abortion complications or adverse events to report these instances to the reporting system. The bill requires certified physicians to report to the board of pharmacy, as well as the MedWatch reporting system of the United States food and drug administration, any abortion complication or adverse event as defined by the United States food and drug administration in the MedWatch reporting system. The bill requires certified physicians to report to the board of pharmacy any death of a pregnant woman associated with abortion-inducing drugs. The reporting requirements under the bill are in addition to any other reporting requirements applicable to a physician under the bill or any other required conditions for performing abortions in the state. The bill requires the board of pharmacy to develop a system of reporting abortion complications and adverse events resulting from the use of abortion-inducing drugs in the state. Physicians certified to provide abortion-inducing drugs, emergency department physicians, and any physicians licensed in the state who treat women with adverse abortion complications or adverse effects, and other persons as determined by the board of pharmacy shall report abortion complications and adverse events to the system. A person required to do so shall also report adverse events and patient deaths to the United States food and drug administration. The bill provides penalties and remedies for violations of the bill. A manufacturer, distributor, physician, or pharmacist who intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly violates the bill is guilty of a class “D” felony. A class “D” felony is punishable by confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least $1,025 but not more than $10,245. A manufacturer, distributor, physician, or pharmacist who intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly violates the bill by fraudulent use of an abortion-inducing drug, with or without the knowledge of the pregnant woman, is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor. An aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than two years and a fine of at least $855 but not more than $8,540. In addition to any other remedies available under common or state law, failure to comply with the requirements of the bill provides a basis for a civil malpractice action for actual and punitive damages; a basis for a professional disciplinary action by the appropriate licensing board or other entity; and a basis for recovery following a pregnant woman’s death for the woman’s survivors pursuant to a wrongful death action. A civil or criminal penalty shall not be assessed against a pregnant woman upon whom a drug-induced abortion is attempted, induced, or performed. The bill requires the board of pharmacy to enforce the provisions of the bill by specified means. The bill directs the board of pharmacy to develop a complaint portal on its internet site for patients, pharmacies, health care providers, and the public to submit information about potential violations of the bill at no cost. The bill is not to be construed as creating or recognizing a right to abortion or to make lawful an abortion that is otherwise unlawful, and does not repeal, replace, or otherwise invalidate existing federal or state laws, regulations, or policies. The bill provides that the attorney general may bring an action to enforce compliance with the bill or intervene as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality of the bill is challenged. The bill includes a severability clause. The bill takes effect upon enactment.

Dead HF11 A bill for an act relating to the responsibilities of the state board of regents and the institutions of higher education governed by the state board of regents, including requiring the board to publish certain information related to the average income and student debt of institution graduates and requiring the institutions to provide career services to undergraduates.(See HF 135.) This bill relates to the responsibilities of the state board of regents and the institutions of higher education governed by the state board of regents, including requiring the board to publish information related to the average income and student debt of students who have completed a baccalaureate program and requiring the institutions to provide the board with information about such students and adopt procedures designed to connect students with career planning services. The bill requires the board to develop and publish on the board’s internet site a report related to students who have completed a baccalaureate degree program at an institution that is sortable by graduating class, academic major, and institution. The bill requires this report to include information related to the percentage of students who have completed a master’s or doctorate degree program after completing the baccalaureate degree program; the median annual income of students after completing the baccalaureate degree program; the median student loan debt of students who have completed the baccalaureate degree program; the ratio of the student loan debt of students who have completed the baccalaureate degree program to the annual gross income of such students; and an estimate of the amount of student loan payment students who have completed the baccalaureate degree program are required to make each month and the amount, expressed as a percentage, of such payments related to the students’ monthly gross income. The bill also requires the board to direct the institutions to provide the board with the information necessary to complete and annually update the report and publish a link to the report on the institution’s internet site. The bill requires the institutions to adopt procedures, subject to the approval of the board, that connect students who are in the process of completing the first year of a baccalaureate degree program with career planning services, career coaching services, and related services. The bill provides that these procedures shall prohibit a student from registering for classes in the student’s second year of the baccalaureate degree program until the student registers with the institution’s career center; the student completes a career readiness training module; the institution’s career center provides the student with a link to the report; and the student provides a written notice to the institution indicating that the student has been provided with the link to the report and, if the student has declared an academic major, the student understands the employment and wage prospects associated with the student’s academic major. Dead HF3 A bill for an act relating to public assistance program integrity, making appropriations, and including effective date provisions.(See HF 613.) This bill relates to various public assistance programs. DIVISION I. This division requires that prior to the department of health and human services (HHS) awarding public assistance benefits to an applicant, the applicant shall complete a computerized identity authentication process to confirm the identity of the applicant through the use of a knowledge-based questionnaire consisting of financial and personal questions tailored to assist persons without a bank account or those who have poor access to financial and banking services or who do not have an established credit history. The identity authentication process and questionnaire may be submitted online, in person, or via telephone by the applicant or a person authorized by the applicant. The bill also requires HHS to conduct an asset test on all members of the household of an applicant for supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) benefits. The bill specifies the minimum information, federal, state, and other data sources, and public records that HHS must access prior to determining eligibility for an applicant’s SNAP benefits. The bill requires HHS to enter into a memorandum of understanding with any department or subunit of a department to obtain the information specified. The bill’s provisions do not apply if every member of the applicant’s household receives supplemental security income. The bill authorizes HHS to adopt administrative rules to administer the bill and requires HHS to submit an annual report to the governor and the general assembly to assess the impact of the bill. DIVISION II. This division relates to SNAP and Medicaid program integrity by requiring HHS to, within specified time frames, receive and review state and federal information from various entities concerning individuals or individuals in households enrolled in the SNAP or the Medicaid program that indicates a change in circumstances that may affect eligibility. The information relates to death, employment, residency, incarceration, tax, and unemployment information and involves the provision of such information to HHS by the departments of workforce development, corrections, and revenue, and information identified by out-of-state electronic benefit transfer transactions. Additionally, the bill requires HHS to, on at least a monthly basis, cross-check information relating to individuals in households enrolled in SNAP or the Medicaid program, as applicable, with specified federal databases maintained by the United States social security administration, the United States department of health and human services, the United States department of housing and urban development, and the United States federal bureau of investigation. With regard to the Medicaid program only, the bill also requires that prior to determining eligibility for the Medicaid program, HHS shall access information for every member of an applicant’s household from the data sources outlined in the bill and conduct a review of nationwide public records data sources of physical asset ownership. The data sources may include but are not limited to records of real property and automobiles, watercraft, aircraft, luxury vehicles, and any other vehicles owned by the applicant. An applicant for Medicaid must also provide proof of residency. The bill also requires an applicant for SNAP benefits to cooperate with the child support recovery unit as a condition of eligibility as specified under federal law. The bill also directs HHS to request federal approval for a Medicaid section 1115 demonstration waiver to suspend requirements to use prepopulated eligibility renewal forms and to renew eligibility automatically based on available information. DIVISION III. This division requires HHS to seek federal approval of an amendment to the section 1115 demonstration waiver for the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide both of the following: (1) that an Iowa health and wellness plan member who is not otherwise exempt from payment of a monthly contribution, who is subject to payment of a monthly contribution as the result of failure to complete required healthy behaviors, and whose eligibility for the program is terminated due to nonpayment of monthly contributions shall be allowed to subsequently reenroll in the program without first paying any outstanding monthly contributions, if the member has not been terminated from the program previously for nonpayment of monthly contributions, and (2) following an initial termination from the Iowa health and wellness plan, if an Iowa health and wellness plan member is subsequently terminated from the program for nonpayment of monthly contributions, the member shall be subject to payment of any outstanding monthly contributions accrued since the subsequent termination and not to exceed program limits prior to reenrollment in the program. The bill does not apply to an Iowa health and wellness plan member who is deemed to be in substantial compliance with the requirement to complete a wellness examination by providing proof of a scheduled examination appointment if the appointment is scheduled no later than 90 days beyond the end of the applicable enrollment period. DIVISION IV. This division requires HHS to submit a request for federal approval by July 1, 2023, and annually by July 1, thereafter until federal approval is received, for a waiver to require that as a condition of eligibility, Iowa health and wellness plan members participate in community engagement activities. The bill specifies the types of community engagement activities to be required under the waiver submitted and provides exceptions to required participation in community engagement activities. The bill directs HHS to implement the waiver upon receipt of federal approval and to adopt administrative rules to administer the waiver provisions. DIVISION V. This division requires HHS to request a waiver from the United States department of agriculture, food and nutrition service, to provide that the eligible foods under the state administration of SNAP only include those items defined as supplemental foods in the most current Iowa special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC) approved food list. The department is directed to implement the waiver upon receipt of approval of the waiver. The division also relates to the double up food bucks program by making a supplemental appropriation from the general fund of the state to the department of agriculture and land stewardship for fiscal year 2023-2024, in addition to any other funding appropriated for such purpose for the same fiscal year, to provide grants to support the double up food bucks program administered by the Iowa healthiest state initiative to make fresh fruits and vegetables sold at farmers markets, grocery stores, and other participating locations accessible to individuals and families who reside in this state and receive assistance through SNAP. The division requires a double up food bucks program grant recipient to provide at least a dollar-for-dollar match of the grant assistance. Moneys appropriated under the division do not revert at the close of the fiscal year but remain available for the purposes of the double up food bucks program. The supplemental appropriation for the double up food bucks program takes effect on the date HHS receives federal approval of the SNAP waiver, if the waiver is approved. DIVISION VI. This division provides implementation provisions for the bill. The bill requires HHS to request federal approval including for any state plan amendment or waiver necessary to administer the bill. If HHS determines that any provision of the bill would result in the denial of funds or services from the federal government that would otherwise be available or would be inconsistent with the requirements of federal law or regulation, such provision shall be suspended, but only to the extent necessary to eliminate the inconsistency with federal requirements. Unless otherwise provided in a division of the bill, HHS shall implement the provisions of the bill in an incremental fashion, beginning July 1, 2023, with a goal of full implementation no later than June 30, 2025, to minimize duplication of efforts and to maximize coordination with the implementation time frames of other departmental resource enhancements. The provisions of the bill requiring federal approval shall be implemented upon receipt of federal approval. The provisions of the bill not requiring federal approval shall be implemented as specified in the bill, and if it not specified in the bill, then not later than June 30, 2025. Dead HF510 A bill for an act relating to the Iowa human life protection Act, providing for civil actions and civil penalties, and including effective date provisions. This bill creates the Iowa human life protection Act in new Code chapter 146E, and provides for civil actions and civil penalties. The bill includes findings relating to human life and abortion. New Code section 146E.2 provides definitions used in the new Code chapter including “abortion fund”, “abortion-inducing drug”, “abortion provider”, “affiliate”, “aiding or abetting”, “attempt” or “attempts”, “elective abortion”, “fertilization”, “governmental entity”, “information content provider”, “interactive computer service”, “major bodily function”, “medical emergency”, “medically indicated separation procedure”, “perform”, “performance”, “performed”, “performs”, or “performing” relative to an elective abortion, “person”, “policy”, “political subdivision”, “pregnant”, “taxpayer resource transaction”, “unborn child”, and “woman” or “women”. New Code section 146E.3 prohibits a person from knowingly using, employing, or administering any drug, instrument, device, means, or procedure upon a pregnant woman with the specific intent to cause an elective abortion, or from aiding or abetting such conduct. The prohibition applies if any portion of the prohibited conduct or elective abortion occurs in the state or within the jurisdiction of the state. The requirements of new Code section 146E.3 shall be enforced exclusively through the qui tam actions described in the bill; direct or indirect enforcement shall not be taken or threatened; and a violation of the Code section shall not be used to justify or trigger the enforcement of any other law or any type of adverse consequence under any other law, except as provided in the provisions of the bill relating to qui tam actions. However, the Code section does not preclude or limit the enforcement of any other law or regulation against conduct that is independently prohibited by such other law or regulation and that would remain prohibited by such other law or regulation. The prohibition does not apply to speech or conduct protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States; conduct the state is forbidden to regulate under federal law or the Constitution of the United States; the provision of basic public services by a governmental entity or a common carrier to an abortion provider, an abortion fund, or an affiliate of an abortion provider or abortion fund in the same manner those services are provided to the general public; or conduct taken at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if a prohibition on that conduct would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental immunity. New Code section 146E.4 provides for liability for wrongful death and personal injuries related to an elective abortion. The Code section provides that a person who violates new Code section 146E.3 shall be subject to joint and several liability for the wrongful death of an unborn child who dies from the elective abortion; and strict, and joint and several liability for the wrongful death of a pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman who dies from the elective abortion and any personal injuries suffered by an unborn child or pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman from the elective abortion. A surviving parent of an unborn child who was aborted in violation of the bill may maintain an action for wrongful death against a person who knowingly violated the bill resulting in the wrongful death of the unborn child. The bill prohibits a lawsuit under new Code section 146E.4 against and by certain people including: against a pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman who aborted or attempted to abort the pregnant woman’s unborn child; against a person that acted at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if the imposition of liability would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental immunity; by a person who through an act of sexual assault or incest impregnated the pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman; and against a provider or user of an interactive computer service if such a lawsuit would be preempted by federal law. A prevailing plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and punitive damages of not less than $100,000. Under new Code section 146E.4, if a plaintiff brings suit in response to a drug-induced abortion and is unable to identify the specific manufacturer of the abortion-inducing drug that caused the death or injury, liability is apportioned among all manufacturers of abortion-inducing drugs in proportion to each manufacturer’s share of the market for abortion-inducing drugs. A person may bring an action no later than six years from the date the cause of action accrues. Waiver of the right to sue is void as against public policy and shall not be enforceable in any court. The Code section shall not be construed to impose liability on constitutionally protected speech or conduct. New Code section 146E.5 relates to prohibitions related to abortion-inducing drugs and qui tam enforcement. The Code section provides that it is unlawful for a person to manufacture, possess, or distribute abortion-inducing drugs in the state; mail, transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing drugs in any manner to or from a person or location in the state; or engage in any conduct that constitutes aiding and abetting the manufacture, possession, distribution, mailing, transporting, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing drugs. The bill does not prohibit constitutionally protected speech or conduct; conduct that the state is forbidden to regulate under federal law or the Constitution of the United States; conduct taken at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if a prohibition on that conduct would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental immunity; conduct taken by a pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman who aborts or seeks to abort the woman’s unborn child; the manufacture, possession, distribution, mailing, transporting, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing drugs for a purpose that does not include termination of a pregnancy; the possession of abortion-inducing drugs related to an effort to entrap persons that violate the Code section; or any of the conduct described under the section of the bill relating to interactive computer services. New Code section 146E.5 shall only be enforced as a qui tam action as provided under the bill and direct or indirect enforcement of the Code section shall not be taken or threatened. However, the Code section does not preclude or limit the enforcement of any other law or regulation against conduct that is independently prohibited by such other law or regulation, and that would remain prohibited by such other law or regulation. New Code section 146E.6 relates to liability for wrongful death and personal injuries related to the manufacture, mailing, distribution, transportation, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing drugs. The Code section provides that a person who manufactures, mails, distributes, transports, delivers, or provides abortion-inducing drugs; or who aids or abets the manufacture, mailing, distribution, transportation, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing drugs shall be strictly, and jointly and severally liable for the wrongful death of an unborn child or pregnant woman who dies from the use of abortion-inducing drugs, and for any personal injuries suffered by an unborn child or pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman from the use of abortion-inducing drugs. The surviving parents of an unborn child who was aborted in violation of the Code section of the bill relating to elective abortion prohibitions may maintain an action for wrongful death against a person who knowingly violated the Code section resulting in the wrongful death of the unborn child. New Code section 146E.6 prohibits a lawsuit from being brought against a pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman who used or sought to obtain abortion-inducing drugs to abort or attempt to abort her unborn child; against a person that acted at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if the imposition of liability would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental immunity; by a person who, through an act of sexual assault or incest, impregnated the woman who used abortion-inducing drugs; or against a provider or user of an interactive computer service if such a lawsuit would be preempted by federal law. A prevailing plaintiff under new Code section 146E.6 is entitled to recover compensatory damages, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and punitive damages of not less than $100,000. If a plaintiff brings suit in response to a drug-induced abortion and is unable to identify the specific manufacturer of the abortion-inducing drug that caused the death or injury, liability shall be apportioned among all manufacturers of abortion-inducing drugs in proportion to each manufacturer’s share of the market for abortion-inducing drugs. A person may bring an action no later than six years from the date the cause of action accrues. Waiver of the right to sue is void as against public policy and shall not be enforceable in any court. It is an affirmative defense if a person sued under this Code section was unaware that the person was engaged in the conduct described in this Code section, and took every reasonable precaution to ensure that the person would not manufacture, mail, distribute, transport, deliver, provide, or aid or abet the manufacture, mailing, distribution, transportation, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing drugs. The defendant has the burden of proving an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The Code section shall not be construed to impose liability on constitutionally protected speech or conduct. New Code section 146E.7 provides for qui tam enforcement for certain violations under the bill. A person, other than a governmental entity or an officer or employee of a governmental entity, has standing to bring and may bring a qui tam action against any person that violates any provision of new Code section 146E.3 (elective abortion prohibitions), 146E.4 (abortion-inducing drugs prohibitions), or 146E.14 (government contractors and grant recipients); or any person who intends to violate any provision of those Code sections. A civil action shall not be brought under the Code section against the pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman upon whom an elective abortion was performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced or against a pregnant woman who intends or who seeks an elective abortion in violation of the new Code chapter; against any person that performs, aids or abets, or attempts to perform or aid or abet an elective abortion at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if a prohibition on that elective abortion would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental immunity; against a common carrier that transports a pregnant woman to an abortion provider, if the common carrier is unaware that the pregnant woman intends to abort the pregnant woman’s unborn child; against a provider or user of an interactive computer service if such a lawsuit would be preempted by federal law; or by a person who, through an act of sexual assault or incest, impregnated a woman who is seeking an elective abortion or a person who acts in concert or participation with the person who impregnated the woman. An action shall be brought in the name of the person and of the state. A plaintiff who prevails in an action under this Code section shall be awarded injunctive relief, nominal and compensatory damages if the plaintiff has suffered injury or harm from the defendant’s conduct, civil penalties of not less than $10,000 for each violation, and court costs and reasonable attorney fees. A person may bring an action no later than six years from the date the cause of action accrues. It is an affirmative defense if a person sued was unaware that the person was engaged in the specified conduct and took every reasonable precaution to ensure that the person would not be in violation of the specified provisions of the bill. The Code section shall not be construed to impose liability on constitutionally protected speech or conduct. A court shall not award court costs or reasonable attorney fees to a defendant. A person bringing an action is entitled to receive 25 percent of the civil penalties recovered, with the remaining civil penalties paid to the state. The state is not liable for expenses that a person incurs in bringing an action. New Code section 146E.8 provides for qui tam enforcement for violations relating to interactive computer services. The Code section provides that a person, other than a governmental entity or an officer or employee of a governmental entity, has standing to bring and may bring a qui tam action against a person that provides or maintains an interactive computer service that allows Iowa residents to access information or material that assists or facilitates efforts to obtain elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs; provides or maintains a platform for downloading any application or software for use on a computer or electronic device that is designed to assist or facilitate efforts to obtain elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs; or provides or maintains a platform that allows or enables those who provide or aid or abet elective abortions, or those who manufacture, mail, distribute, transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing drugs, to collect money, digital currency, resources, or any other thing of value in exchange for such services. An action under new Code section 146E.8 shall be brought in the name of the person and the state. A prevailing plaintiff shall only be awarded declaratory and injunctive relief, not damages. Relief shall not be awarded if the action is brought in response to the exercise of state or federal constitutional rights that belong personally to the defendant; conduct taken at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if the relief would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental immunity; or conduct taken by a pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman who aborted or attempted to abort such woman’s unborn child, if such woman is the named defendant in the civil action. Under new Code section 146E.8, it is an affirmative defense if a person who sued was unaware that the person’s interactive computer service or platform was being used to assist or facilitate efforts to obtain elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs; and upon discovering that the person’s interactive computer service or platform was being used to assist or facilitate such efforts, the person took prompt action to block access to any information, material, application, or software and to block those who provide or aid or abet elective abortions and those who manufacture, mail, distribute, transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing drugs, from collecting money, digital currency, resources, or any other thing of value in exchange for such services through its interactive computer service or platform. The defendant has the burden of proving an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. A person who engages in the violative conduct shall not be held vicariously liable for any nominal, statutory, or compensatory damages incurred by another information content provider; held liable or legally responsible for the conduct of any publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider; or treated as the speaker or publisher of any information provided by another information content provider under any provision of state law. New Code section 146E.8 shall be enforced exclusively through the qui tam action and direct or indirect enforcement of this Code section shall not be taken or threatened. However, the Code section does not preclude or limit the enforcement of any other law or regulation against conduct that is independently prohibited by such other law or regulation, and that would remain prohibited by such other law or regulation in the absence of the Code section. Under new Code section 146E.8, a provider or user of an interactive computer service shall have absolute and nonwaivable immunity from liability or suit on account of an action taken to restrict access to or availability of information or material that assists or facilitates access to elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs, whether or not such information or material is constitutionally protected; an action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to information or material described in the Code section; or a denial of service to those who provide or aid or abet elective abortions, or those who manufacture, mail, distribute, transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing drugs. The state is not liable for expenses that a person incurs in bringing an action under the Code section. New Code section 146E.9 provides affirmative defenses for a defendant against whom an action is brought under new Code section 146E.6 (liability for wrongful death and personal injury —— abortion-inducing drugs), 146E.7 (qui tam enforcement for certain violations), or 146E.8 (qui tam enforcement —— interactive computer services). The defendant must prove the affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The Code section does not limit or preclude a defendant from asserting the unconstitutionality of any provision or application of state law as a defense or from asserting any other defense that might be available under any other source of law. A court shall not apply the law of another state or jurisdiction to any civil action brought under the specified Code sections, unless otherwise required by law. New Code section 146E.10 specifies the defenses that are not applicable to an action brought under Code section 146E.4 (liability for wrongful death and personal injury —— elective abortion), 146E.6, or 146E.7. New Code section 146E.11 includes venue provisions and provides that if an action is brought under new Code section 146E.6, 146E.7, or 146E.8, the action shall not be transferred to a different venue without the written consent of all parties. New Code section 146E.12 includes provisions relating to personal jurisdiction, choice of law, and class action lawsuits. The Code section provides that the courts of this state shall have personal jurisdiction over any defendant sued under Code section 146E.4, 146E.6, 146E.7, or 146E.8; Iowa law shall apply to these actions, and such civil actions shall not be litigated on behalf of a plaintiff class or a defendant class, and a court shall not certify a class in any civil action brought under these Code sections. New Code section 146E.13 provides protection from counter lawsuits by providing that when a lawsuit has been brought or a judgment entered against a person in any state or federal court in which the lawsuit or liability in whole or in part is based on that person’s decision or threat to bring an action under Code section 146E.6, 146E.7, or 146E.8, that person may recover damages from any party that brought the action, obtained the judgment, or sought to enforce the judgment. Recoverable damages include compensatory damages; court costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney fees incurred in bringing an action to recover the costs; and additional statutory damages in an amount of not less than $100,000. New Code section 146E.14 relates to government contractors and grant recipients and qui tam libability. The Code section provides that a person that enters into a contract with a governmental entity or a subcontract with a contractor of a governmental entity, or that receives any grant or funding from a governmental entity shall not pay for, reimburse, or subsidize in any way the costs associated with an elective abortion including by providing coverage of elective abortions as an employee benefit; paying for, reimbursing, or subsidizing the travel costs associated with obtaining an elective abortion, or covering those costs as an employee benefit; donating or lending money, digital currency, resources, or any other thing of value to an abortion provider, abortion fund, or an affiliate of an abortion provider, either directly or by laundering the donation or loan through an intermediary; offering, providing, or lending money, digital currency, resources, or any other thing of value with the knowledge that the thing of value will be used to pay for, offset, or reimburse the costs of an elective abortion or the costs associated with procuring an elective abortion; performing or providing any type of work or service for an abortion provider, abortion fund, or an affiliate of an abortion provider, regardless of whether such work or service is done on a paid, contract, or volunteer basis, except for the provision of basic public services in the same manner as the governmental entity or common carrier provides the services to the general public; paying, offering to pay, or providing insurance that covers legal expenses, court judgments, or settlements of those who violate the abortion laws of the United States, or the abortion laws of any state, local, or foreign jurisdiction; or engaging in any conduct that would constitute aiding and abetting an elective abortion. Additionally, a person shall not enter into the specified contracts or receive any grant or funding from a governmental entity, unless the person certifies in writing that the person complies with the requirements. A person who violates this Code section is subject to qui tam liability as provided in new Code section 146E.7. New Code section 146E.15 relates to internet service providers. The Code section provides that an internet service provider that provides service in the state shall make all reasonable and technologically feasible efforts to block access to child pornography as defined in federal law and information or material that is intended to assist or facilitate efforts to obtain elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs. A person who becomes aware that information or material described is accessible through internet service provided by an entity that provides internet service in the state may notify that internet service provider and request that the internet service provider block access to the information or material through any means specified in the bill. While direct or indirect enforcement shall not be taken or threatened by a governmental entity or by any officer or employee of a governmental entity, the state, its political subdivisions, and officers and employees of the state and its political subdivisions may ask or encourage internet service providers to comply with the provisions of the Code section. An internet service provider shall have absolute and nonwaivable immunity from liability or suit on account of an action taken to comply with the requirements of the Code section, or to restrict access to or availability of any of the information or material described in the Code section; an action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to information or material described in the Code section; or a denial of service to those who use or seek to use the internet to make available information or material described in the Code section. If a lawsuit is brought or a judgment entered against an internet service provider in any state or federal court based on the internet service provider’s compliance with the Code section, the internet service provider may recover costs related to the action as well as compensatory damages and statutory damages of not less than $100,000. New Code section 146E.16 relates to internet service in publicly owned buildings, public libraries, school district locations, and institutions of higher education relative to access to certain information. A publicly owned building in the state that provides internet service shall be equipped to operate a technology protection measure with respect to each of the computers with internet access in the publicly owned building that protects against access through those computers to child pornography as defined in federal law and information or material that is intended to assist or facilitate efforts to obtain elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs, including through interactive computer services. A person who becomes aware that information or material described in the Code section is accessible through internet service provided by a government-owned building, public library, school district location, or location of an institution of higher education governed by the state board of regents may notify an authority with control over the building and request that the authority block access to that information or material. The authority may disable a technology protection measure that blocks the information specified under subsection 1 to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes. New Code section 146E.17 relates to governmental entities and political subdivisions and prohibitions relating to elective abortion and taxpayer resource transactions.
