        "text": "Francisco Moya currently represents the 21st Council District – encompassing East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, LeFrak City, and his native Corona. Prior to his 2017 election to the Council, Moya was elected to the 39th Assembly District in 2010, making him the first Ecuadorian-American elected to public office in the United States.\n\nA lifelong resident of Corona, Queens, Francisco began organizing in his community at the age of 15, when he and a group of concerned neighbors started the Corona Gardens Neighborhood Association, organizing members of the community and working to improve quality of life. Francisco went on to graduate from St. John’s University. He graduated with an MPA from Baruch College’s Urban Fellow program. Subsequently worked for two members of Congress, Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez and Congressman Brad Sherman, in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 2003, Francisco was named Secretary to the Senate for Senate Minority Leader David A. Paterson, and became the highest-ranking Latino in state government.\n\nThroughout his years in the Assembly, Francisco has been a champion for working-class families, fighting to pass legislation that would preserve union rights, improve workplace safety and strengthen worker protections. He successfully passed legislation to stop employment agencies from robbing low-income families of hundreds in unfulfilled finder’s fees.\n\n…"
