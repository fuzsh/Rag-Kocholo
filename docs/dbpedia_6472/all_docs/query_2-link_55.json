        "text": "Bradley A. Sherman\n\nBradley A. Sherman did the big law thing for 23 years. He started his career with the most successful labor and employment practice in the State of Ohio. When that practice, Duvin, Cahn & Hutton, merged with Littler Mendelson in 2007, Bradley leveraged his training and hard work to represent employers of all shapes and sizes – from the Fortune 100 to small business, public and private sector. For his last five years, he served as the Office Managing Shareholder, leading its Cleveland office – one of the five largest in the firm.\n\nIn the Fall of 2017, Bradley made a decision to abandon big law firm life and, with his close friend and co-worker Allen Boseman, start a different kind of practice. A firm that emulates the values of the community in which they live:\n\nHard Work;\n\nDiversity;\n\nService; and\n\nPersonal Relationships.\n\nThe Sherman Boseman Legal Group was born.\n\nBradley focuses his practice on managing, defending and resolving complex multi-faceted litigation and negotiations and has successfully resolved disputes in a wide variety of labor and employment and commercial areas. He appears in state and federal courts and before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the State Employment Relations Board, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, and the Pennsylvania Human Rights Commission.\n\nBradley has a broad base of labor and employment related expertise and concentrates on multi-plaintiff and class and collective action litigation in the context of wage and hour and discrimination. In more than a dozen reported decisions, his experience includes more than 100 class or collective actions and multiple-plaintiff cases, and trial exposure in discrimination, tort, contract, wrongful discharge and constitutional law.\n\nAdditionally, he provides counseling and strategic guidance on compliance and all other manner of employment-related issues.\n\nBradley is a frequent speaker on a variety of subjects concerning employers, including internet and email privacy issues, harassment prevention, handling investigations and discipline effectively, wage and hour issues and employment litigation trial strategies. He also is a member of the faculty of the National Institute for Trial Advocacy.\n\nEducation\n\nJ.D., Case Western Reserve University School of Law, 1994, cum laude\n\nB.A., Northwestern University, 1991\n\nBar Admissions\n\nOhio\n\nCourts\n\nU.S. District Court, Northern District of Ohio\n\nU.S. District Court, Southern District of Ohio\n\nU.S. District Court, Western District of Michigan\n\nU.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan\n\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\n\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\n\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\n\nRecognition"
