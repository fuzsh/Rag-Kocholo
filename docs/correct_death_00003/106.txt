John Lennon has inspired a number of memorial tributes since his untimely death on December 8, 1980.

The circumstances around Lennon’s death understandly was a shock to the world. The former Beatle was murdered outside of The Dakota, the luxury apartment building where he lived on New York City’s Upper West Side. In a time before the internet and social media, many Americans found out about his tragic death from Howard Cosell on Monday Night Football.

“Remember: This is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses,” began Cosell during the live broadcast. “An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City. John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the west side of New York City, the most famous perhaps of all of The Beatles, shot twice in the back. Rushed to Roosevelt Hospital. Dead on arrival.”

A piece from ESPN on the 30th anniversary of Lennon’s death detailed the behind-the-scenes goings-on of Cosell’s now-infamous announcement. At first, the legendary sportscaster almost didn’t deliver the earth-shattering news. The piece features off-the-air audio of Cosell and announcer Frank Gifford discussing whether or not to break the news during the game. While Cosell was on the fence about breaking the news, Gifford tells him, “You’ve got to. If we know it, we’ve got to do it…Don’t hang on it. It’s a tragic moment and this is going to shake up the whole world.”

Gifford, sadly, was correct. Lennon’s murder is still considered one of rock history’s biggest and most senseless tragedies. Fans to this day mark the loss of Lennon in some way. One of the ways includes visiting one of the many memorials that have been erected in his honor.

From Liverpool to New York City to Cuba, here are nine different memorial tributes to Lennon from around the world.
