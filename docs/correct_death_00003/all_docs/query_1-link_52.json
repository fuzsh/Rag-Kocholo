        "text": "John Lennon might be famous for living at The Dakota on the Upper West Side, but The Beatles frontman first lived in SoHo with girlfriend Yoko Ono. Lennon bought a two-story building at 496 Broome Street in 1971 shortly after the breakup of The Beatles, and the couple lived there for two years until moving to The Dakota in 1973.\n\nOno, an avant-garde artist and peace activist, retained ownership of the building, and she and her son, Sean Ono Lennon, also a musician, recently listed it for $5.5 million with Paul Smadbeck of JLL. This is the first time in 53 years the building is for sale. The façade features brick, bluestone and terra cotta, including decorative checkered glass, and was first built in 1885. The two-story building spans 3,832 square feet and has soaring ceilings more than 14 feet high.\n\nThe first floor features the open-plan kitchen, complete with an eat-in kitchen island and stainless steel appliances, and also offers access to a lofted bedroom and full bathroom. There’s also an ample living area. Meanwhile, the second floor features another living space and a former recording studio Lennon and Ono would use.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the home’s deed was transferred to Sekhmet Productions, once owned by Ono’s former boyfriend, but is now controlled by Ono and her son. Over the years, the property was used as a meeting space, art storage and a place for press interviews. It’s also being sold with 4,600 square feet of air rights, meaning the future buyer can add up to three additional floors.\n\nThough it’s been updated over the years, the next owner could easily transform this into a beautiful single-family residence, office or even a gallery, retail space or restaurant. No matter what, the building certainly has A-list pedigree—especially for fans of Lennon and Ono. The loft-style home is just a short walk from some of New York’s most fabulous restaurants and upscale shopping and is located in one of the city’s trendiest neighborhoods. After moving from this Broome Street apartment, Ono has called The Dakota in New York’s Upper West Side home for the last 50 years—the same location of Lennon’s death after he was shot outside the high-profile residential building in The Dakota’s archway. She still owns the couple’s multi-unit property, though it’s uncertain whether she will ever return there full time.\n\nThe sale of this Broome Street property comes a few years after Ono, who is 91 years old, moved to a rural upstate New York farm that she and Lennon purchased in 1978. It’s said that the couple purchased the 600-acre farm near Franklin, New York to raise Holstein cows and used it as an escape from the city. According to author Philip Norman’s book “John Lennon: The Life,” the singer bought 122 cows and 10 bulls to roam the farm. The population of Franklin is under 400 people and features undulating countryside, quaint eateries, charming shops and farmers’ markets. According to Daily Mail, Ono moved to the farm full-time during the pandemic."
