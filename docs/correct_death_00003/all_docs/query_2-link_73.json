        "text": "Mike Oliver is an opinion columnist for AL.com. Read his blog about music and dementia awareness at myvinylcountdown.com\n\n.On this date, Dec. 8, 1980, 39-years ago today, John Lennon was shot to death outside his condo in New York City. It seems like only yesterday.\n\nI was a student at Auburn University, and my hometown paper, the Athens (Ga.) Banner Herald, published a column from some pundit wondering why this was news.\n\nI was moved to write a letter-to-the-editor which was published. I was outraged, outraged I say (well, sort of) that someone would have this sentiment.\n\nI don’t have the letter now, but I’m sure it was a passionate defense of the positives brought forth by my favorite member of my favorite band.\n\nLennon represented the place an artist can be in our world. Using song and lyrics, Lennon and the Beatles unified millions in a young, increasingly aware, demographic, and then used the power his popularity gave him to try and change the world. He was smart, funny and gifted. Some, like the columnist and those of a different generation, didn’t get it.\n\nTo critics, Lennon was an unkempt, drug-using, naïve hippie; Arguably all true. But Albert Einstein walked around with bedhead all day as well. After the Beatles spent the 1960’s changing everything about rock music, the band fell apart. Their parting song, if you will, was Let it Be, a simple piano-driven song with repeating stanzas, including: When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me, speaking words of wisdom, Let it Be.\n\nThen John Lennon put out an album that is naked in its pain, difficult to listen to and brilliant in every way:\n\nIt was simply entitled John Lennon Plastic Ono Band. Former Beatles Ringo Starr sat in on drums.\n\nThe album opened with ‘Mother:’\n\nMother, you had me, but I never had you.\n\nHis mother was struck and killed by a car when John was a young boy. His father had left the family earlier and was not part of John’s life.\n\nLennon ends the song with screams he had learned to do in something called primal scream therapy which supposes it is helpful to rid oneself of life’s emotional baggage in a physical way -- by screaming – let it all out. It is demonstrated on “Mother” and the song “Well Well Well” and sets the tone to say the least.\n\nAnother song on the album is called 'God.\" It’s a song that represented Lennon’s frustrations, the turmoil and contradictions of fame, expectations, and love.\n\nThe song opens like this:\n\nGod is a concept, By which we measure our pain\n\nI’ll say it again\n\nGod is a concept\n\nBy which we measure our pain\n\nFrom there he goes through a list of I-don’t-believe-ins.\n\nI don’t believe in magic\n\nI don’t believe in I-Ching\n\nI don’t believe in Bible\n\nI don’t believe in tarot\n\nI don’t believe in Hitler\n\nI don’t believe in Jesus\n\nI don’t believe in Kennedys\n\nI don’t believe in Buddha\n\nI don’t believe in mantra\n\nThere’s more on the list – including ‘I don’t believe in Beatles where the song pauses for a moment of silence. Then Lennon finishes in a world-weary voice with piano and drums keeping a rolling slow pace:I just believe in me. Yoko and me. That’s reality.\n\nLast line of the song: The dream is over.\n\nIt’s a powerful song.\n\nA song about having looked for truth and justice and an end to war. The song sounds like a man one step away from giving up. But years later, Lennon had moved out of that pit of despair.\n\nHe and Yoko were a seen-about-town couple in NYC, walking in the park, laughing and in love. What a tragedy as we entered the 1980s Mark David Chapman, a mentally ill man took the artist away from us.\n\nOn the steps of John and Yoko’s condo, 39 years ago today, John was shot, twice in the back. He was DOA at the hospital.\n\nHe and Yoko had just released an album: “Starting Over.’’\n\nDuring one of his last interviews Lennon said: “I’m not afraid of death because I don’t believe in it. It’s just getting out of one car, and into another.”\n\nI believe had John lived he might have written a sequel to “God,” that song/snapshot of search and failure. I’m no John Lennon, but on this anniversary of his death, I’m going to offer an updated flipped over version of God. Call it God Part 2. I’ll dedicate it to the cranky columnist that spurred me to write something for the newspaper, something I’ve spent doing most of my 60-year-old life.\n\nWithout further ado, here’s God Pt. 2.\n\nWe are a concept\n\nBy which God measures love\n\nI’ll say it again\n\nWe are a concept\n\nBy which God measures love\n\nI believe there’s God\n\nI believe there’s Jesus\n\nI believe there’s Buddha\n\nMohammad too\n\nI believe in Beatles\n\nThe chords of Love Love Me Do\n\nDon’t know much about I-Ching\n\nBut I believe there is truth\n\nAnd I believe there’s justice\n\nI believe in Mandela,\n\nI believe in Gandhi and MLK\n\nI believe Mother Teresa when she talked of spirit and poverty\n\nI believe in breaking through\n\nI believe in the seasons,\n\nSummer, fall, and spring\n\nWinter too,\n\nPlanets in motion they’re keeping time\n\nPart of a bigger thing\n\nI believe the lies sometimes\n\nBut it helps me see what’s true\n\nI believe in Death\n\nIt’s life’s partner in crime\n\nI believe in the goodness of people\n\nAll we got is the time\n\nThe dream is not over, it’s plain to see\n\nI hope you will join us and Imagine what the world could be, free\n\nNow that’s reality.\n\n***"
