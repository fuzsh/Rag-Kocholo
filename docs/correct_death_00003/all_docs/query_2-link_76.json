        "text": "The sun would not be up for hours, but I was wide awake in the pre-dawn hours of Dec. 9, 1980.\n\nI was a college intern, working under John Deegan, a colorful newsman of four decades who was the morning anchor at Channel 40, which had changed its call letters almost a year earlier from WHYN to WGGB.\n\nMy weekday routine was set in stone. I would spend three hours in the newsroom, clearing the teletype of wire service bulletins that had accumulated after 11 p.m., assembling regional news briefs and rewriting stories from The Morning Union for Deegan to read during his morning newscast and again in the “Good Morning America” news breaks. After 8 a.m., I would rush to classes at Springfield Technical Community College and, later, go to work at Belmont Records at Baystate West.\n\nWhen I headed downstairs to the kitchen that Tuesday morning there was a note on the counter left by my father. He had been watching the New England Patriots lose to the Miami Dolphins on “Monday Night Football” hours earlier. Late in the broadcast, Howard Cosell had informed viewers that former Beatle John Lennon had been shot and killed outside his New York City home.\n\nMy dad knew what this meant to me. The music of the Beatles was then – and remains – a massive part of my life. Having bought up all their iconic albums, I would frequent Backroom Records, located in the rear of an Amherst barbershop, to buy bootleg recordings of their failed Decca audition tapes or many BBC radio appearances.\n\nI felt a chill as I read my dad’s note and soon drove my 1973 Plymouth Scamp through the Liberty Heights neighborhood to Channel 40. A bit stunned, I kept turning the knob on the static-filled AM radio for word that there had been a horrible mistake.\n\nInside Channel 40, I made my way to the two clattering teletypes. I read each news bulletin item printed in black, uppercase letters on yellow paper. The details slowly emerged: Lennon had been shot four times in the back outside his Central Park West home; a suspect had been taken into custody; and crowds had gathered around the musician’s apartment house.\n\nI clipped each one reverentially and put them aside. For reasons I can’t fully explain, I have kept them for 40 years.\n\nWhen Deegan arrived I bit my lip and politely listened as the 60-ish anchor lectured me that Lennon had the “morals of an alley cat,” but his murder was obviously big news. I kept checking the teletype for any explanation as to why the suspect would have traveled to New York City to kill someone he had never met.\n\nWith my Channel 40 shift behind me, I headed to STCC, where planning was underway for our student-run weekly TV newscast. Classmates Doug Rossi and Joe Tetrault were among those who put together a moving video tribute to Lennon set to his solo hit “Imagine.”\n\nWhen you’re known as the resident Beatles freak, people come up to you at a time like that to share their thoughts. It was all anyone talked about between classes. Topics ranged from favorite songs to whether tougher gun control laws would be passed.\n\nSome college friends were going to take part in a vigil in New York City. Did I want to come along? Frankly, I am not the kind of guy who holds a candle and sings songs – and besides, I had obligations at school and work.\n\nNothing could have prepared me for the commotion I found when I arrived for work at Belmont Records. It was like Christmas shopping without the joy and merriment.\n\nLennon’s recent comeback album, “Double Fantasy,” which had not been selling particularly well, was sold out.\n\nPeople were snatching up anything Beatles-related: albums; 45s; cassette tapes; even 25-year-old interview discs. Some customers were openly crying, realizing that a part of their youth had been taken away.\n\nA large “Double Fantasy” display in a storefront window facing Vernon Street, now Boland Way, was ordered removed by Belmont Records' owner for fear someone might smash the glass to steal the 4-foot square poster of the album cover. Longtime manager Loretta Dutton had us remove the Lennon display and replace it with one that would cheerily push holiday-themed albums.\n\nThe public outpouring of grief lingered for days. Lennon’s recent album about his finding contentment in marriage and fatherhood would become a bona fide hit.\n\n“Double Fantasy” reached the No. 1 spot on the album charts in both the U.S. and Great Britain. It would be honored as Album of the Year at the 24th annual Grammy Awards and be ranked by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s.\n\nYears later, I would meet Roger Farrington, one of the photographers hired by Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, to chronicle the start of the “Double Fantasy” recording sessions. I had bought a print from him of a smiling Lennon performing the first take for the single “Starting Over,” which hangs in my home office.\n\nFarrington, who hails from Boston, had met up with Lennon and Ono at the Hit Factory on 48th Street in Manhattan on Aug. 7, 1980.\n\nHe recalled Lennon was dressed in black, wearing a Western-style shirt, wide-brimmed hat and singing as he made his way toward Farrington. He carried a briefcase filled with sheet music.\n\n“He was really, really great,” Farrington told me. “He was energized, witty and looked fit and tan. He had been sailing to Bermuda, and, with the long hair he looked every bit a rock star.”\n\nBecause of this remarkable job, I have had the good fortune over the years to talk not only with Farrington but with those closest to Lennon: Ono; bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr; producer George Martin; and the Beatles' long-time road manager, Neil Aspinall.\n\nThe recollections of Lennon I’ve heard are the same: remarkably talented, complex and taken away much, much too soon."
