        "text": "A makeshift peace sign of flowers lies on top John Lennon's \"Strawberry Fields\" memorial in New York's Central Park, Wednesday Dec. 7, 2005. The memorial is near the Dakota building where Lennon, a former member of the Beatles, lived with his wife Yoko Ono and son Sean when he was murdered outside the building. Thursday is the 25th anniversary of his death. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nFor all of the classic Christmas celebrations in New York City each year, for many music fans it’s also a sorrowful time as we recount the tragic death of John Lennon on December 8, 1980. That said, this month we’d like to use the space to remember the groundbreaking artist and some of the more memorable New York City landmarks that he touched.\n\nSt. Regis Hotel – 2 East 55th Street\n\nThis was the first New York residence for John Lennon and Yoko Ono. In October 1971, this is also where Lennon recorded the first acoustic guitar demo of his now famous holiday anthem, Happy Xmas (War is Over).\n\n105 Bank Street\n\nJohn Lennon lived here with his wife Yoko Ono from 1971 to 1973. It was in Greenwich Village where Lennon began to immerse himself in the city’s art and political culture.\n\n156 Prince Street – Greenwich Village\n\nThis was the apartment where Yippie leaders Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin would often meet. Lennon would join them here to powwow in the early 1970s.\n\nThe Record Plant – 321 West 44th Street – (former location)\n\nThis is where famed record producer Phil Spector put together musicians to help Lennon record Happy Xmas (War is Over) in the fall of 1971. On the second day of recording, the Harlem Community Choir, which was comprised of about 30 children ranging from ages 4 to 12, were brought into the studio to record backing vocals for the song.\n\n434 52nd St. apartment\n\nThis is where John Lennon lived briefly in 1973 and 1974 with his girlfriend May Pang after Lennon had separated from Yoko. It was on the roof of this building were photographer Bob Gruen took the famous photos of Lennon wearing a now-iconic New York City T-shirt.\n\nThe Hit Factory – 421 West 54th Street -(former location)\n\nThis is where recording studio New York is where Lennon recorded his final album Double Fantasy.\n\nCafé La Fortuna – 69 West 71st Street\n\nLocated just around the corner from the Dakota, this was one of Lennons favorite neighborhood haunts to go have coffee. The business has since closed.\n\nCharivari – 18 West 57th Street\n\nThis former fashion boutique was where Lennon purchased the parka he was wearing the day he passed away.\n\nThe Dakota\n\nThe Lennons moved to this famed Gothic apartment complex in the mid-1970s from their address on Bank Street.\n\nStrawberry Fields\n\nLocated across the street from the Dakota, Strawberry Fields is the living memorial created in honor of John Lennon after his death.\n\nPrevious Article\n\nIan McLagan: 1945-2014 – In Remembrance\n\nPublished on 2014/12/05\n\nI first saw Ian McLagan, fittingly seated behind a keyboard, with the Rolling Stones in 1981.
