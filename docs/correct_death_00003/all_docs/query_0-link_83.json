        "text": "Kiefer Sutherland has been tapped to narrate a three-part docuseries for Apple TV+ about the tragic death of John Lennon, the legendary singer-songwriter shot and killed in 1980 by confessed killer Mark David Chapman at the entrance to the building where he lived in New York City.\n\nJohn Lennon: Murder Without a Trial will look at the investigation and conviction of Chapman, who stalked the famed Beatles bandmember before gunning him down, and promises exclusive eyewitness interviews and previously unseen crime scene photos.\n\nSutherland is best known for his TV credits like the long-running 24 and Designated Survivor series, but also has film credits ranging from Stand by Me and The Lost Boys to A Few Good Men and A Time to Kill. He most recently starred in the series Rabbit Hole for Paramount+.\n\nJohn Lennon: Murder Without a Trial will also present new materials following Freedom of Information Act requests from the New York City Police Department, the board of parole and the district attorney’s office, as well as interviews with Chapman’s defense lawyers, psychiatrists, detectives and prosecutors, along with those who knew Lennon before his death at the age of 40.\n\nThe series is produced for Apple TV+ by 72 Films, and is directed by Nick Holt and Rob Coldstream. David Glover, Mark Raphael, Simon Bunney and Louis Lee Ray will executive produce.\n\nThe docuseries comes more than 50 years after The Beatles broke up, and 43 years after Lennon was fatally shot as he and his wife, Yoko Ono, returned to their home in the Dakota building overlooking New York’s Central Park. Chapman confessed to murdering Lennon and remains imprisoned in New York State after repeatedly being denied parole."
