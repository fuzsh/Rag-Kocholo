        "text": "O n December 8th, 1980, John Lennon was murdered outside of his New York City apartment building. Three days prior to the tragic event, he spoke with Rolling Stone for nine hours. He was famously photographed by Annie Leibovitz for that story, naked and curling up in a fetal position next to a fully-clothed Yoko Ono. “This is it,” he told the photographer. “This is our relationship.” The image would become the cover of our January 22nd, 1981 issue, a heartbreaking tribute to the legend whom RS founder Jann Wenner called the magazine’s “North Star.”\n\nAll these years later, Rolling Stone has continued honoring Lennon’s legacy, publishing that final interview in full and a new remembrance by Ono in 2010. We also unearthed a moving essay by Scott Spencer from our 1981 issue, now published online for the first time. In 2020, we spoke to Sean Ono Lennon, who produced Gimme Some Truth. The Ultimate Mixes, a comprehensive box set containing remixed versions of his father’s solo catalogue to commemorate what would have been his 80th birthday.\n\n“Part of what has been interesting in looking at this release is coming to terms with the reality that we’ve got to make an effort to make sure that kids have an opportunity to be exposed to his music and his message,” Sean said. “We’re living in an age where enough time has passed. No one bothers to make sure that the younger generations have an opportunity to be exposed to it. I just always assumed the Beatles and John Lennon — no one is going to forget those stories. I don’t think my dad would have been satisfied with just being somebody that you have to discover through your own research.”\n\nNotes from a Tragedy\n\nJohn Lennon: The Last Interview\n\nThree days before he died on December 8th, John Lennon talked with Rolling Stone for nine hours.
