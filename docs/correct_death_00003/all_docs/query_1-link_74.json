        "text": "A place of pilgrimage for Beatles fans the world over, Strawberry Fields – named after the famous song – is a deliberately informal and often crowded section of Central Park. It is located right opposite the Dakota apartment building where John Lennon lived and where he was murdered in 1980.\n\nDedicated in 1985 on the 45th birth anniversary of John Lennon, it provides a bit of solace to all who visit. On a normal day, you will see people placing flowers and candles, guitarists singing Beatles tracks, with most everyone singing and joining in, or simply taking a moment to reflect.\n\nThe site's prominent feature is an intricately designed – though rather subtle/unassuming – black and white mosaic given as a gift by the city of Naples, that bears the word of Lennon's song: \"Imagine\". The memorial is shaded by stately American elms and lined with benches. Go early if you want good pictures.\n\nIn warmer months, flowers bloom all around the area, turning it into a favorite spot for picnickers. Along a path, there's also a plaque listing all countries that endorse Strawberry Fields as a \"Garden of Peace\".\n\nOn Lennon's birthday, October 9th, and on the anniversary of his death, December 8th, expect to find a huge crowd of Beatles fans who gather to sing songs in his memory late into the night.\n\nTip:\n\nThe Dakota Building where John Lennon lived and was later murdered is just outside the park entrance nearest the memorial (at 72nd Street), so you can pass there, too.\n\nGeorge Washington's New York\n\nWhile not really a New York fan himself, George Washington held the city in high esteem, calling it “a post of infinite importance,” and is even credited with coining the term “New Yorker”. The scene of some of Washington’s greatest military trials and political triumphs, NYC is a home to several important sites associated with his life and career, such as Fraunces Tavern, Bowling Green,... view more\n\nTour Duration: 1 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 1.6 Km or 1 Miles\n\nNYC's Chinatown and Little Italy Walking Tour\n\nNew York's Little Italy and Chinatown were places that attracted Italian and Chinese immigrants in the late 1800s, with densely packed ethnic communities having grown around them, as they brought their customs, food and language. In the 1960s, however, right around the time that Italians stopped coming to the city in large numbers, Chinese immigrants did the opposite, hence why Little Italy... view more\n\nTour Duration: 1 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 1.6 Km or 1 Miles\n\nBest of Lower Manhattan Walking Tour\n\nEvery part of Manhattan is terrific, but if you are looking for one that showcases the best overview of New York City’s history and architectural styles, it’s Lower Manhattan. This is where it all started, where New Amsterdam was founded, where Canal Street used to be a canal, and where Wall Street used to be a wall marking the end of town. It’s also where the city has seen the most tragedy,... view more\n\nTour Duration: 2 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 3.1 Km or 1.9 Miles"
