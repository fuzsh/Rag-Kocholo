        "text": "John Lennon was an English musician who gained worldwide fame as a member of the Beatles, for his subsequent solo career, and for his political activism and pacifism. On the evening of Monday, 8 December 1980, Lennon was shot dead by Mark David Chapman in the archway of the Dakota, his residence in New York City. Lennon had just returned from Record Plant Studio with his wife, Yoko Ono.\n\nAfter sustaining four major gunshot wounds, Lennon was pronounced dead on arrival at St. Luke's – Roosevelt Hospital. There, personnel stated that nobody could have lived longer than a few minutes after sustaining such injuries. Shortly after local news stations reported Lennon's death, crowds gathered at St. Luke's – Roosevelt Hospital and in front of the Dakota. Lennon was cremated at the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York two days after his death; the ashes were given to Ono, who chose not to hold a funeral for him.\n\nMount Sinai St. Luke's, 1111 Amsterdam Avenue, Manhattan. Incorporated on May 12, 1848, opened as St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in 1856 and originally housed in the Church of the Holy Communion at Sixth Avenue and 20th Street in Manhattan, moved to Fifth Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets on May 13, 1858, moved to its current location in 1896, merged with Roosevelt Hospital to form St. Luke's – Roosevelt Hospital in 1979, acquired by Mount Sinai Hospital in 2013 and renamed Mount Sinai St. Luke's on January 22, 2014."
