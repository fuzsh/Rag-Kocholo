        "text": "As the Beatles once sang, \"She's leaving home.\" The Daily Mail recently reported that the artist Yoko Ono is moving out of the Dakota, an iconic New York City co-op building, and spending the rest of her life on a 600-acre farm in Franklin, New York. For some, this might be a real-estate move they did not see coming. Ono has become almost synonymous with the luxurious apartment complex for the past 50 years—for better or for worse. (John Lennon, Ono's former partner, was killed on the steps of the Dakota in 1980.) But the move isn't actually that shocking, considering Ono and Lennon purchased the sprawling farm back in 1978. Her change of residence will be a full-circle moment.\n\nCurious to learn more about Ono's departure from the Dakota? We're answering all of your biggest questions below. (If you can't get enough of the Beatles' real-estate-mania, be sure to check back here for updates.)\n\nWhen did Yoko Ono Move Into the Dakota?\n\nThough it feels like Ono always lived in the Dakota, which was built in 1884, she and Lennon actually moved into the residential building in 1973. Located on the Upper West Side—a stone throw's away from the city's famed Central Park—the 65-unit building was notoriously strict about its residents. Legend has it, the building's co-op board rejected a slew of high-profile celebrities like Madonna, Billy Joel, and Cher. (However, stars like Judy Garland and Lauren Bacall were granted access.) The Dakota was all about preserving its peaceful-yet-private atmosphere—something that felt particularly on-brand for Lennon.\n\nWhat Did Yoko Ono's Dakota Apartment Like?\n\nWhy have one apartment when you can have a few? According to the Cheat Sheet, Ono and Lennon had multiple units within the Dakota: their primary residence, two units for storage, one used as a studio, and two guests apartment.s (You know, just in case Paul, George, or Ringo wanted to stop by.) In a biography titled , author Philip Norman says that the couple's seventh-floor residence had four bedrooms, and sweeping views of Central Park's treetops. Architecturally speaking, the unit boasts a sit-down elevator, brass details, and plenty of wooden paneling.\n\nHas Yoko Ono Listed Her Unit in the Dakota?\n\nThough Ono reportedly has yet to list her beloved unit—and not much is known about their additional spaces within the Dakota—she could sell it for a steep profit. Local real-estate platform StreetEasy shows that there are currently four listings at the Dakota, ranging from $4.5 million to a whopping $20 million. That's quite a markup considering when the Dakota first opened as a residential unit, tenants reportedly spent $1,500 to $5,000 per year.\n\nWhere is Yoko Ono Living Now?\n\nAfter 50 years living in New York City, Ono is embracing the quiet country life. According to the Daily Mail, she is currently residing on her 600-acre farm in Franklin, New York, an upstate community with a population of 280 people. Lennon and Ono initially purchased this retreat in 1978, with hopes to raise Holstein dairy cows. (In fact, it's widely reported that Lennon once purchased a herd of 122 cows and 10 bulls for the farm.) Ono originally moved out to the farm during the Covid-19 pandemic, and has since decided that she will not return to her New York abode. Srawberry fields forever."
