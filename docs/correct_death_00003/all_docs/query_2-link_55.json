        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIt is the 42nd anniversary of John Lennon's assassination. Lennon was killed in December 1980 in New York.\n\nJohn Lennon of Beatles was shot dead outside his Dakota house in New York City on December 8, 1980. Mark David Chapman, a Beatles fan, disapproved of Lennon's lifestyle and remarks from 1966, in which he stated that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus.\n\nHow did Chapman kill Lennon?\n\nChapman shot Lennon at the Dakota house on December 8 evening. Earlier that day, Lennon autographed a copy of the album Double Fantasy while meeting Chapman. Lennon later left for a recording session and came back in the evening with his wife, Yoko Ono, to his house in Dakota. As the couple walked towards their building's entry gate, Chapman fired five rounds from a “.38” special revolver, four of which hit Lennon in the back. Chapman stayed at the scene.\n\nLennon's assassination\n\nIt has been 42 years since John Lennon was brutally killed. The assassination of John Lennon sparked global outrage. Even decades after his departure as a significant innovator in the field of rock music, he is still remembered. The Beatles were the only band to significantly impact music during the 1960s, notably in the West, where they developed a sound that elevated rock music and \"young culture\" to levels attained never before.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhere is Mark Chapman?\n\nMark Chapman is being held at New York's Green Haven Correctional Facility. The time for his subsequent parole hearing will be in February 2024.\n\nWhat is the most well-known solo song by John Lennon?\n\nLennon's best-known solo song is Imagine (1971), which was influenced by a collection of poems by Yoko Ono.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by an external agency.
