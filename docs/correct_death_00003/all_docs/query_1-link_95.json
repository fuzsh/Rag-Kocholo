        "text": "For music lovers visiting New York, the Imagine mosaic in Central Park is a must. A tribute to John Lennon, who was killed nearby outside the Dakota building where he lived with his wife Yoko Ono in 1980. She donated $1 million dollars to remodel her husband's favorite corner of Central Park and rename it Strawberry Fields in honor of one of his most famous songs. Artists from Naples were commissioned to make this mosaic, which holds a hopeful message of world piece. 120 countries are mentioned on a nearby bronze plaque for their donations to this area, known around the world as the Garden of Peace.\n\nThe U.S. loves to recognize their famous dead, whatever kind of famous they are. Lennon spent years in Manhattan while married to Yoko Ono. They lived in the Dakota building near Central Park, and Lennon was murdered while out on the streets. This is a tribute to his memory, and we saw a lady singing a Beatles song. It was very emotional. I recommend it.\n\nThe Strawberry Fields Memorial is found in Central Park in New York, dedicated to the famous musician and songwriter John Lennon. This corner is a spot where Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono loved to walk. After his assassination, it was named after The Beatles' famous song. On 8 December each year, many fans come here to pay homage.\n\nWe walked through Central Park for hours, and finally stopped at Strawberry Fields Memorial, the famous monument dedicated to the memory of the singer-songwriter John Lennon. There was a bouquet of flowers, photos and plenty of Beatles memorabilia. It's never quiet here, as there are always hordes of tourists taking photos."
