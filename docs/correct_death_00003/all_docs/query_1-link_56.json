        "text": "John Lennon was the centerpiece of New York's Central Park celebration after fans gathered to celebrate 43 years of the rockstar's death. John Lennon was murdered on the night of December 8, 1980, outside the Dakota Building, by a fan named Mark Chapman, where his widow, Yoko Ono, still lives.\n\nJohn Lennon fans paid homage to their heroe\n\nHis fans installed offerings in his memory with flowers, apples after the record label he helped found during his time with The Beatles, as well as a gas lamp with the message \"flames of hope\", right on the mosaic placed in Central Park, with the word 'Imagine', about his iconic piece that has become an anthem of peace and where every December 8, thousands of fans come to honor his memory.\n\nThe area known as 'Strawberry Fields', in memory of one of his most iconic compositions\n\nThe most emblematic songs of Lennon's career, both as a Beatles and as a soloist, were played at this point of the Park, several of them performed by street artists: 'Imagine', 'Strawberry Fields Forever', 'Give Peace a Chance' and other pieces that he did not compose such as 'Let it be' and 'Hey Jude', which are the work of Paul McCartney.\n\nLennon lived very close to the place where the mosaic was placed and Yoko is often seen walking in this area of the Park.\n\nSince that day, Chapman shot the musician for no apparent reason with a revolver 43 years ago and remains in prison despite having applied for parole on several occasions, partly due to the influence of Yoko Ono, who has pressured the authorities to keep him in prison.\n\nFans from all over the world come to visit John Lennon's memorial site\n\nLocal chronicles speak of tourists from all over the world, including a Russian citizen, named Oleg, who arrived at the tribute site to play the drums, dressed in the iconic pink suit worn by Ringo Starr on the cover of the 'Sgt. Peppers' album."
