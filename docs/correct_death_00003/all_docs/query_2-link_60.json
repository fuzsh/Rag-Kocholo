        "text": "I grew up six short blocks from the Dakota.\n\nI would like to share my memories of going to the ten-minute silent prayer vigil in Central Park's Bandshell for\n\nJohn Lennon on December 14th, 1980.\n\nI grew up near the Bandshell so I was definitely going to go when it was announced. Lennon was shot at 10:50pm, people started an impromptu vigil\n\noutside the Dakota almost immediately.\n\nAt the time, I was living in an NYU dorm, so I didn’t rush out to the Dakota - which I regretted.\n\nI ran out to buy all his solo albums the next morning as my way of showing respect.\n\nOn Dec 14th, My friend Perry came to my house and we walked to the Bandshell. When we arrived, Beatles music and Lennon’s solo music was playing. The Bandshell had very minimal decorations - a large Christmas wreath in the center and an easel with a black and white photo of John wearing his New York City shirt with two bouquets of flowers on either side.\n\nBefore the ten-minute vigil was scheduled to start, an announcer asked for “everyone’s cooperation for our great friend John Lennon - we expect complete silence. Please get comfortable turn off your radios, anyone who is selling needs to stop and find a comfortable position.”\n\nWhat I distinctly remember about the ten minutes was the fact that no one made any noise at all. It was totally quite for the whole ten minutes. Perry, however, remembers a little differently; there were many people sobbing.\n\nWhen the ten minutes was over, “Imagine” began to play.\n\nIt had started out as a dreary, overcast day, but as people left the park the sun came out, as if on cue.\n\nI grew up with a view of central park and my mother, Ruth Orkin, took the two photos below.\n\nThe two photos are the people entering Central Park and the second one is people exiting the park.\n\nI would love any feedback on this.\n\nPlease tell me if you were at the vigil on December 14th."
