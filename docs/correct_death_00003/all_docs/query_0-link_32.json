        "text": "Brooklyn detectives are looking for a suspect who sprayed a man with bullets in front of a neighborhood grocery store last week.\n\nLaw enforcement sources said the incident occurred on Wednesday, July 10, at approximately 9:30 p.m. in front of Kingston Fruit and Vegetables, located at 265 Kingston Ave. in Crown Heights.\n\nOfficers from the 77th Precinct, in responding to a 911 call of a male shot, found the 33-year-old victim shot multiple times throughout his body. EMS responded and rushed the man to NYC Health and Hospitals/Kings County in stable condition.\n\nMeanwhile, the suspect — described as a male — fled on foot heading westbound on Saint John’s Place before officers arrived on scene.\n\nPolice could not confirm a motive for the shooting or whether any weapons or casings were found at the crime scene. But on Sunday, they released video footage of the suspect, which shows him wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and white COVID-style mask.\n\nSo far, no arrests have been made, but the investigation remains ongoing.\n\nAccording to the latest police data, felony assaults in the 77th Precinct are down 22% year-to-date compared to 2023. However, murder is up 100% during the same time period, from three three homicides in 2023 to six in 2024."
