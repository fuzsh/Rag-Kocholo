It happened outside the Dakota in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City. Chapman lived in Hawaii and had travelled to New York to kill Lennon. Chapman said he was annoyed at how lazy Lennon's lifestyle was and was also annoyed about that Lennon had said The Beatles were \"more popular than Jesus\".[1][2]\n\nChapman was arrested soon after the shooting and was charged with murder. Chapman pleaded guilty to Lennon's murder and was sentenced to 20-years-to-life in prison. Chapman could have had parole ten times since 2000, but was never accepted. He is still in prison today.[3]"
