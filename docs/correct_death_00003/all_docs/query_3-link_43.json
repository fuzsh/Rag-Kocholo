        "text": "John Lennon, one of The Beatles, was shot to death on Dec. 8, 1980, outside of the Dakota apartment building in New York City where he lived with his wife, Yoko Ono.\n\nThe Beatles, an English rock band that also included Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, started in 1960 and disbanded in 1970. Lennon then pursued a solo career.\n\nLennon, 40, was shot in the back four times by Mark David Chapman. Lennon died in the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital.\n\nOno scattered Lennon's ashes in Central Park where the Strawberry Fields memorial was later created.\n\nChapman pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. He remains in Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, N.Y., and has been denied parole nine times, most recently in 2016.\n\nThe next time he can be considered for parole is August 2018."
