        "text": "Mark David Chapman (born May 10, 1955, Fort Worth, Texas, U.S.) is an American criminal who fatally shot John Lennon on December 8, 1980. He received a sentence of 20 years to life and was repeatedly denied parole.\n\nChapman grew up in Decatur, Georgia, and as a teenager he developed an obsession with the Beatles, especially Lennon. While in high school, he became a born-again Christian, and after graduation, he worked for the YMCA and was a counselor for Vietnamese refugees in Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. In 1977 Chapman moved to Hawaii, where he attempted suicide and was taken to a hospital. Later that year he began working at the facility, first in maintenance and then in its print shop.\n\nIn 1979 Chapman married and became a security guard. Over the ensuing year, he grew increasingly unstable and homicidal. He became fixated on J.D. Salinger’s novel The Catcher in the Rye and began identifying with the disillusioned main character, Holden Caulfield. Chapman also created a list of people he wanted to kill, and it included Johnny Carson, Elizabeth Taylor, and Lennon. He eventually decided on the former Beatle, whom he had come to think of as a “phony.” In addition, Chapman believed that the murder would make him famous, transforming him into “something other than a nobody.”\n\nIn October 1980 Chapman quit his job and shortly thereafter purchased a gun. Later that month he flew to New York City but changed his mind about killing Lennon and returned to Hawaii in November. However, he went back to New York on December 6. Two days later he waited outside Lennon’s residence at the Dakota apartment building. In the early evening, he met Lennon, who autographed a copy of the album Double Fantasy. That night Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, returned home, and Chapman fatally shot him in the back. Chapman remained at the crime scene, reading The Catcher in the Rye until he was arrested."
