A woman gave birth in a courtyard of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina after suddenly going into labour at the holy site, the Saudi Red Crescent Authority's (SCRA) director General for the region said on Friday.

The woman was assisted by a SCRA volunteer team working at the holy site, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.

Finding that the woman's contractions had already begun, the team assisted with the delivery at the site. After the delivery, the mother and baby were transferred to the Bab Jebreel Health Centre.

SCRA regional Director General Ahmed al-Zahrani praised the team's efforts, saying that their ability to provide rapid assistance was testament to the training given to volunteers.

The Prophet's Mosque is considered Islam's second holiest site after the Grand Mosque of Mecca.

The mosque is built on the compound of the Prophet Muhammad's home, where he settled after migrating to the western city of Medina from Mecca.

The mosque is a pilgrimage site for millions of Muslims from around the world.
