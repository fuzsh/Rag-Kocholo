[1]\n\n2. Saudi Arabia: Path to Evolution\n\nIn 1924, King Abdulaziz (Ibn Sa’ud)—the founder and first King of Saudi Arabia (1932-1953)—took control of the Hijaz (the western region of Saudi Arabia), ending a long series of battles to consolidate and unite a vast but fragmented territory. Abdulaziz had his mind set on implementing a nation-building process that would respond to the needs and aspirations of the people in a manner consistent with the best interests of all. [2] He realized that Islam provided the only way to realize this long-sought future, reflecting on its profound influence on the culture and history of the Arabian Peninsula and the perceptions of its inhabitants. National unity was achieved because Abdulaziz applied the doctrine of Islam to public policy, justice and all other spheres of life. He succeeded not only in unifying the country but also in proving the credibility of the Islamic solution and demonstrating its current and eternal validity.\n\nAbdulaziz progressively transformed a simple administrative structure into a series of well-defined and well-organized institutions which administered and assisted the executive authority in managing the affairs of an expanding territory. Focusing on the needs of his people, Abdulaziz took the first steps toward the establishment of a system of governance based on the Islamic principle of consultation, as advocated by the Qur’an (Islam’s Holy Book) and the authentic Sunnah (Traditions of the Prophet). [3]\n\n2.1. Constitutional Evolution\n\nIn 1924, the National Council (Al–Majlis al-Ahli), a consultative council introduced by Abdulaziz, began to exercise certain powers except in foreign and military affairs which were the prerogative of the King. In August 1925, the Makkah Consultative Council, with more extensive powers, was formed. This new council was responsible for overseeing communications, trade, education, the courts system, internal security and municipal affairs. It was also the precursor of the General Consultative Council, which played a significant role in the creation of the Council of Ministers. In August 1926, Abdulaziz approved a comprehensive constitution that was called the “Basic Directives ( Al-Ta’limat al-Asasiah) for the Hijaz region.” The document was in line with the constitutions of many modern States and may also be regarded as the precursor for future ones. The “Hijaz Constitution” consisted of nine sections and 79 articles addressing core constitutional issues such as the system of government, administrative responsibility, the affairs of the Kingdom of the Hijaz, the Accounting Department, the Inspectorate General, the Kingdom’s civil service, the general municipal councils and the municipal administrative committees. Most importantly, the fourth article of that document established several governmental bodies which included the Consultative Council, administrative councils, district councils and village and tribal councils. [4]\n\nIn 1927, the Commission on Inspection and Reform, which was tasked with reviewing the administrative system, was formed by order of Abdulaziz. Recommending courses of action for administrative reform, the Commission proposed a new law for the Consultative Council which was approved by Abdulaziz in July 1927. This new Consultative Council was responsible for informing the Government of any errors in the application of laws and statutes. Its functions also extended to other areas, including budgets, construction project awards and licenses, expropriation of private property, employment of foreign nationals and the drafting of laws and statutes.[5]\n\nIn light of the complexities of the modern era, Abdulaziz approved the Commission on Inspection and Reform’s recommendations and the Council of Deputies (Majlis al-Wukala) was created in January 1932. The Council of Deputies functioned for 23 years, acting as a small council of ministers for the Hijaz until the creation in 1953 of the Council of Ministers with jurisdiction over all the provinces of the Kingdom. [6] In September 1932, the country was united as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This major step brought all Saudi Arabian citizens under the umbrella of a unified constitutional and administrative system and facilitated the establishment of new national structures.\n\nThe discovery of oil in the Eastern Province in the 1930s, coupled with the increasing complexity of governmental affairs, rendered the earlier type of administration inadequate.[7] To ensure a more effective administrative organization, several ministries were created, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1930), the Ministry of Finance (1932), the Ministry of Defence (1944), the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Communications (1953). The new State successfully established foreign relations based on diplomatic representation, for which ambassadors were appointed. [8] In addition, a number of centralized departments were set up which eventually paved the way for the establishment of the Council of Ministers. [9]\n\nIn October 1953, King Abdulaziz announced the establishment of the Council of Ministers. In furtherance of his father’s efforts, King Sa’ud bin Abdulaziz (1953-1964) inaugurated the first session of the Council of Ministers in March 1954. At the time of its establishment, the Council of Ministers served as an advisory body to the King. In 1958, Faisal bin Abdulaziz, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, transformed the Council of Ministers into a legislative, executive and administrative body with decision-making powers. Most of the Kingdom’s basic constitutional principles were embodied in the Law of the Council of Ministers. Between 1959 and 1960, Faisal made an earnest attempt to introduce modern constitutionalism into the Kingdom, but his endeavours did not go beyond the proposal phase. However, many of the country’s government ministries, agencies and welfare administrations were developed during King Faisal’s reign (1964-1975); the Ministry of Justice is a case in point, having been established by King Faisal in 1970. [10]\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Council of Ministers formulated the Kingdom’s policies on domestic as well as foreign affairs. It also played a leading role in the implementation of policies relating to the national economy, education, social welfare and most public affairs. Focusing on the needs of Saudi citizens, the government agencies were considerably expanded during the 1980s. After the establishment of the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs in 1975, the Municipal and Rural Affairs Law was promulgated under the terms of which municipal councils were formed to promote the shift towards decentralization. [11] During the reign of King Khalid bin Abdulaziz (1975-1982), a Royal Order was issued for the formation of a high-level committee of experts and senior officials to draft the Basic Law, the Law of the Shura Council and the Law of the Provinces. That distinguished committee, chaired by H.R.H. Prince Naïf bin Abdulaziz (1934- 2012), put a tremendous amount of effort into the drafting of those legislative enactments. [12]\n\nThrough consultation and a constant awareness of the people’s needs and aspirations, King Fahd bin Abdulaziz (1982–2005) initiated the evolution of Saudi Arabia’s Constitution. On 1 March 1992, he promulgated three fundamental enactments under Royal Decrees Nos. A/90-92 which transformed the domestic political environment:\n\nThe Basic Law of Governance (hereinafter referred to as the Basic Law);\n\nThe Law of the Shura (Consultative) Council; and,\n\nThe Law of the Provinces. [13]\n\nThe political reforms of the 1990s expanded the scope of Saudi Arabian democratic values into the areas of decision making and checks and balances. Several Royal Orders have been issued amending those constitutional documents, including the Law of the Council of Ministers, in keeping with Saudi Arabia’s constitutional evolution. [14] Those fundamental enactments and their amendments enhanced participation by citizens in the conduct of public affairs and recognized the role played by civil and political rights in governance. [15]\n\n2.2. Succession Process\n\nThe legitimacy of the Al-Sa’ud monarchy did not emerge solely from its adherence to the constitutional and Islamic principle of consultation; it also derives from the relatively smooth transitions in kingship which stemmed from King Abdulaziz’s truly significant decision to apply the concept of allegiance (bay’ah) established by the Shari’ah and sanctioned by tradition. The Basic Law confirms that the system of government is monarchical and reserves the right to rule to the children and grandchildren of King Abdulaziz bin Abdurrahman bin Faisal Al-Saud. [16] Prior to 1992, the throne had passed to one of the sons of King Abdulaziz on the basis of seniority and family consensus. This allowed a smooth transfer of power over six decades, covering four accessions to the throne .[17] The Basic Law of 1992 introduced provisions regulating the succession process. [18] It established two precedents: an acknowledgement that the grandsons of King Abdulaziz were legitimate candidates for the throne, and a royal prerogative to appoint and to remove the Crown Prince.\n\nArticle 5 (b) of the Basic Law introduced changes in the rules of succession by allowing the selection of a King or Crown Prince from among the grandchildren of the founding King, Abdulaziz bin Abdurrahman bin Faisal Al-Sa’ud, on the basis of “suitability” and “the most upright among them,”[19] rather than seniority. The most upright among them is to be pledged allegiance in accordance with the principles of the Holy Qur’an and the Traditions of the Venerable Prophet.[20] Before its amendment, article 5 (c) of the Basic Law gave the reigning monarch absolute authority to appoint and dismiss his heir apparent, thereby circumventing the traditional role of the family in this decision. [21] Article 5 (d) of the Basic Law further stipulates that: “The Crown Prince shall devote himself exclusively to the functions of his office and shall perform any other duties assigned to him by the King.” [22] The Basic Law of Governance indicates that, upon the death of the King, the Crown Prince shall assume the royal powers until a pledge of allegiance is given. Under the terms of article 5 (e) of the Basic Law: “The Crown Prince shall assume the powers of the King upon his death until the pledge of allegiance is given.”[23] Article 6 of the same Law requires citizens to pledge allegiance to the King in accordance with the Qur’an and the traditions of the Prophet, in submission and obedience, in times of ease and difficulty, fortune and adversity. [24]\n\nOn 19 October 2006, King Abdullah issued a Royal Decree establishing the Pledge of Allegiance Commission, which is the body responsible for determining future succession to the throne of Saudi Arabia, with a view to further stabilizing the country and institutionalizing the process of succession.[25] The Decree approved the Law of the Pledge of Allegiance Commission which comprises 25 articles regulating matters of governance, including allegiance to the King and the selection of the Crown Prince, in order to prevent the development of a constitutional vacuum or political chaos. [26] The Commission was formed by King Abdullah on 7 December 2007. This landmark law was a major development in terms of constitutional and legal reform, indicating the scope of the Kingdom’s democratization and modernization. [27]\n\nOn the same day, a Royal Order amended article 5 (c) of the Basic Law, which previously empowered the King to choose and remove his Crown Prince, in a manner consistent with the new Law. The amendment states that “the pledge of allegiance to the King and the selection of his Crown Prince should be effected in accordance with the provisions of the Law of the Pledge of Allegiance Commission.” [28] Article 7 of the aforementioned Law defines the way in which the Crown Prince is to be selected. It states as follows:\n\n(a) After receiving the pledge of allegiance and after consultation with members of the Commission, the King shall choose one, two or three persons whom he deems fit to be Crown Prince. His choice shall be submitted the Commission, which shall endeavour to agree on one nominee to be named Crown Prince. If the Commission does not nominate any of them, it shall nominate another person whom it deems fit to be Crown Prince.\n\n(b) The King may at any time request the Commission to nominate a person whom it deems fit to be Crown Prince. If the King disapproves of the Commission’s nominee in accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this article, the Commission shall vote on its nominee and another chosen by the King and the one with the majority of votes shall be appointed Crown Prince.[29]\n\nThe Law of the Pledge of Allegiance Commission also makes provision for the possibility of the King becoming incapacitated. In the event of the King permanently losing his ability to exercise his powers, the Commission would declare the Crown Prince as King. [30] If both the King and the Crown Prince were to become permanently incapacitated, the Commission would form a five-member Transitional Ruling Council to temporarily assume the administration of the Kingdom. The Commission would also select a new King within seven days.[31]\n\nIn 2014, the Commission endorsed King Abdullah’s decision to create the position of “Wali Wali al-‘Ahd” (Deputy Crown Prince),[32] who would become Crown Prince only if the position of Crown Prince were vacant and who could become King in one single eventuality: vacancy of the positions of both King and Crown Prince at the same time. While the Deputy Prime Minister used to automatically become Crown Prince, the creation of the position of Deputy Crown Prince, in accordance with Royal Decree A/86 issued in March 2014, is optional. As a consequence, a Crown Prince could be selected directly by the Pledge of Allegiance Commission in future. [33]\n\nThe smooth transition of power from King Fahd to King Abdullah and subsequently to King Salman is generally considered the most important factor in the Kingdom’s and the region’s stability, and an indication that the Kingdom will continue to prosper, as it has since the founding of the modern State. The Royal Family has always shown wisdom in handling affairs and has always manifested solidarity in times of crisis. Nevertheless, stability is a fragile concept in the Middle East. Fortunately, in a Middle East that is increasingly characterized by instability, the Saudi Royal Family has moved swiftly and resolutely to project an image of certainty for the benefit of both domestic and international stability.\n\nOn 21 June 2017, King Salman issued Royal Order No. A/256 amending article 5 of the Basic Law by adding a sentence to the end of paragraph (b) stating that “There shall be, after the sons of the founding King, no King and Crown Prince belonging to the same branch of the founding King’s descendants.” [34] This latest amendment means that the sons of King Abdulaziz, including King Salman, have the right to name the Crown Prince from their offspring. Each of the sons of King Abdulaziz heads a branch of his descendants that includes his sons and grandchildren, and so on. But “sons of children,” that is, the grandchildren of the founder, when they assume the throne, are not entitled to appoint a Crown Prince from the same branch to which they belong.\n\nOn the same date of this amendment, King Salman issued Royal Decree No. A/255 naming H.R.H. Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. [35] With the investiture of H.R.H. Prince Muhammed bin Salman as Crown Prince, the effective transition of rule in Saudi Arabia from the generation of the founder’s sons to the generation of his grandchildren has begun. The above Royal Order provided for a smooth transfer of power and revealed the intention of King Salman to pump young blood into the Kingdom’s succession process and local government. [36]\n\n2.3. Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030\n\nIn 2016, H.R.H. Prince Mohammed bin Salman unveiled an ambitious and wide-ranging plan to bring economic and social change to the Kingdom and end its dependence on oil. The Saudi Vision 2030 was adopted by Council of Ministers resolution No. 308, dated 18/7/1437 A.H. (corresponding to 25/04/2016), as a methodology which defines public policies, programmes and initiatives and mobilizes the country’s capabilities and natural resources. The Vision 2030 is built on three pillars that draw on the Kingdom’s intrinsic strengths: a dynamic society, a thriving economy and an ambitious nation. These three pillars, which are integrated to achieve the Kingdom’s objectives, draw on the Kingdom’s intrinsic strengths as the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds, the investment powerhouse and the hub connecting three continents. [37]\n\nVision 2030 comprises 96 strategic objectives, based on a clear methodology to enable effective implementation and governed by key performance indicators, which will be achieved through a number of initiatives jointly developed and executed by various governmental entities alongside private and non-profit organizations within the respective ecosystems. The Council of Economic and Development Affairs has set up an effective and integrated governance model with the aim of translating “Vision 2030” into multiple VRPs working in parallel to achieve the strategic objectives and realize the vision. At its session held on 24 April 2017, the Council of Economic and Development Affairs identified a list of 12 programmes to achieve the vision including: the Diouf Al-Rahman [Pilgrimage] Programme, the National Transformation Programme, the Public Investment Fund, the National Industrial Development and Logistic Programme, the Financial Sector Development Programme, the Lifestyle Improvement Programme, the National Entrepreneurship Programme, the Strategic Partnership Programme, the Housing Programme, the Privatization Programme, the Saudi Personal Enhancement Programme and the Fiscal Balance Programme (See Chart 1). [38]\n\nChart 1: Programmes to Achieve the Kingdom’s Vision 2030\n\nIn order to build the institutional capacity and capabilities needed to achieve the ambitious goals of Saudi Arabia’s “Vision 2030,” the National Transformation Programme 2020 was launched across government agencies. The programme’s strategic objectives are linked to interim targets for the year 2020. The National Transformation Programme consists of eight themes, comprising 37 strategic objectives, with key performance indicators and a number of initiatives (See Chart 2).\n\nChart 2: The National Transformation Programme themes\n\nThe National Transformation Programme seeks to achieve governmental operational excellence, improve economic enablers and enhance living standards by: (1) accelerating the implementation of primary and digital infrastructure; (2) involving stakeholders in identifying challenges, co-creating solutions and contributing to the implementation of the programme’s initiatives. [39] In short, in keeping with the amendment to article 5 (b) of the Basic Law, the Saudi Vision 2030 will provide the younger generations with a stable and reliable future. For more information on these programmes, please visit the Saudi Vision 2030 website.\n\n2.4. Participation in Decision Making\n\nThe Executive Branch has developed various opportunities for citizens to participate directly in decision making. Candidates for most executive positions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are chosen through elections, whereby citizens can participate effectively in the decision-making process. This is considered significant in the Kingdom’s progress towards building a participation-based society. For example, municipal council elections allow citizens to participate in the decision-making process by voting for competent and experienced candidates who will manage local affairs and municipal services. Municipal councils draw their significance from the contribution of citizens to the management of services in the government agencies. [40] This contribution helps to support government decision making at all levels in the public interest. Moreover, this contribution allows citizens to share responsibility with government agencies, thereby increasing their awareness and spirit of initiative. [41]\n\nAccording to article 12 of the Municipal Councils Law of 2014, the Municipal Council should have no more than 30 members, two thirds of whom should be elected and one third appointed by decision of the Minister. [42] The Municipal Council serves for a term of four financial years beginning on the date of the start of the State’s fiscal year. [43] The Municipal Councils Law grants women equal rights with men to vote and stand for election.\n\nOn 12 December 2015, municipal council elections were held in Saudi Arabia for two thirds of the seats on 284 municipal councils, with both male and female candidates and voters. As many as 20 female candidates were elected to the approximately 2,100 municipal council seats being contested. [44] In addition, in order to ensure women’s participation in the decision-making process, Royal Order No. A/44 of 11 January 2013 amended article 3 of the Law of the Shura Council to set women’s representation in the Council at not less than 20 per cent of the total number of members, their rights, obligations and functions being determined by Royal Order. [45] Accordingly, King Abdullah, and after him King Salman, appointed 30 women to the previously all-male Shura (Consultative) Council, marking a historic achievement in the push for reforms in the Kingdom (See Chart 4). [46]\n\nOther forms of citizen participation include election of the councils of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry through direct ballot by members; selection of a distinguished and efficient head lends chambers the momentum to push forwards. University students use elections to select the presidents of student clubs, choosing the person they regard as the representative best able to realize their desires and objectives. Engineers select representatives to be assigned leadership positions on the Saudi Council of Engineers; these representatives organize and manage the affairs and requirements of all engineers in Saudi Arabia. The board of the Saudi Council of Journalists is constituted through election in which all members participate. The board members of cooperative societies working in Saudi Arabia, some 162 societies in all, are selected by election. Board members of Saudi sports clubs are also chosen by election. Workers have the right to choose members of the labour committees which are established in any corporation employing more than 100 persons. Members of cultural associations (literary clubs, culture and arts associations, etc.) select their representatives through general assemblies. [47]\n\nIn addition, by stressing the need for women and young adults to claim their place in decision-making, the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 manifested its commitment to ensure their rapid and large-scale empowerment. Today, the empowerment of women and young adults is illustrated by the appointment of many of them in prominent decision-making positions. The Kingdom’s major accomplishment in enacting the Protection from Abuse Law of 2013, [48] the Child Protection Law of 2014[49] and subsequently the Juveniles Law of 2018, [50] the Anti-Harassment Law of 2018[51] and the amendment to the Traffic Law giving women the right to drive marked the beginning of real change.\n\nWith a view to supporting the targets of the Kingdom’s ambitious Vision 2030, Council of Ministers decision No. 684 of 27 July 2019 approved the amendment of the Travel Documents Law, the Civil Status Law and their by-laws affecting Saudi women’s freedom of movement, thereby allowing women over 21 to travel abroad freely and obtain passports without permission from their male guardian. Mothers who have primary custody of their children can now also apply for passports and grant travel permission for their children. [52]\n\nIn addition to the amendments to the Travel Documents Law and its by-law, other amendments to the Civil Status Law and its by-law were enacted with the aim of improving the legal status of Saudi women. For instance, the residential address of Saudi women is no longer limited to their husband’s address. The amendments also permit women to report the birth of their new born children to the authorities in order to receive a birth certificate.[53]\n\nGround-breaking reforms to allow women greater economic opportunities were also enacted in 2019. Legal amendments now protect women from discrimination in employment, including job advertisements and recruitment, and prohibit employers from dismissing a woman during her pregnancy and maternity leave. Saudi Arabia also standardized the retirement age for both women and men at 60 years, thereby extending women’s working lives, earnings and contributions.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s record number of reforms earned the country a place in the top 10 global business climate improvers according to the World Bank Group’s Doing Business 2020 Report. The country saw its biggest improvement in the index since 2017, increasing by 38.8 points. These reforms were spurred by a realization that women play an important role in moving Saudi Arabia closer to its Vision 2030 (See Chart 3). [54]\n\nChart 3: Saudi Arabia’s Progress in the World Bank Group’s Doing Business 2020 Report\n\n3. The Basic Law of Governance\n\nThe Basic Law is the most important of the three fundamental constitutional enactments promulgated in 1992, being equivalent to the constitution in other countries . It specifically states that the Qur’an and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad represent the Kingdom’s Constitution. [55] Article 7 of the Basic Law confirms the Shari’ah (Islamic religious law) as the bedrock of the Kingdom, stipulating that the Government derives its authority from the Qur’an and the Sunnah which are the principal sources of all the State’s administrative regulations. [56] It emphasizes that the State’s role and objective is to protect the principles of Islam and enforce the Shari’ah.[57] The document is guided by Islamic law when defining the nature, objectives and responsibilities of the State and the relationship between the ruler and the ruled based on brotherhood, consultation, friendship and cooperation.[58]\n\nThe Basic Law’s significance emerges when considering its similarity to the constitutions of other countries in terms of content. The Basic Law contains nine chapters: General Principles; Law of Governance; Saudi Social Values; Economic Principles; Rights and Obligations; State Authorities; Financial Affairs; and Audit Institutions. It confirms the monarchical system of the land[59] and reaffirms the following principles of governance: justice, consultation and the equality of citizens under the Islamic Shari’ah. [60] It emphasizes the basic features of the Saudi family and the importance of Islamic values, justice and family cohesion. [61] In addition, the Basic Law’s articles on economic principles, rights and obligations emphasize that the State must protect human rights in conformity with the Islamic Shari’ah,[62] safeguard the Kingdom’s public funds,[63] ensure the inviolability of private homes and private communications, [64] and guarantee the protection of private property [65] and individual freedom from arbitrary arrest and punishment, except in conformity with due process of law.[66] It places the State under an obligation to provide health care for all citizens, support those “in situations of emergency, sickness and old age” [67] and enact laws to protect workers and employers. [68]\n\nChart 4: Saudi Arabia’s Constitutional Evolution\n\nClick image to enlarge\n\n4. State Authorities\n\nThe Basic Law gives a detailed definition of each State authority, including the judicial authority, the executive authority and the legislative authority. It also addresses their interrelationships. [69] However, there is no separation of powers, especially between the legislative and the executive branches.[70]\n\n4.1. The Executive Branch\n\nThe Kingdom’s executive branch consists of the King, the Council of Ministers (also known as Cabinet), local governments, branches of ministries and other independent and quasi-independent public agencies.\n\nThe King exercises ultimate authority over the executive branch, being the focal point of all authority; [71] he is also commander-in-chief of all the military forces. [72] In accordance with article 55 of the Basic Law, the King conducts national policy in conformity with the provisions of Islam. He oversees the implementation of the Islamic Shari’ah and of Saudi Arabian statutory laws, regulations and resolutions, as well as the nation’s system of government and the State’s general policies.[73] In times of emergency, the King is granted extraordinary powers which allow him to take urgent measures and enforce the regulations deemed necessary to deal with a national crisis. [74] In addition, the King exercises functions similar to those of a Prime Minister, [75] with the power to appoint and dismiss ministers. [76] He supervises the Council of Ministers, the ministries and the government agencies. He also directs overall State policy, provides guidance for the various government agencies and ensures the ongoing harmony and unity of the Council of Ministers.[77]\n\nThe Council of Ministers was established by King Abdulaziz in 1953. It consists of the King, who is the Prime Minister, the Crown Prince, who is the Deputy Prime Minister, and Cabinet ministers . It is the Kingdom’s direct executive authority, empowered to determine the nation’s domestic, external, financial, economic, educational and defence policies, and plays the same supervisory role in regard to the conduct of the State’s general affairs. It has final authority over the executive and administrative affairs of all ministries and other government agencies.[78] It also has the authority to monitor the implementation of laws, regulations and resolutions, establish and organize public institutions and follow up on the implementation of general development plans. [79] Article 30 of the Law of the Council of Ministers was amended to include the Council’s Chairmanship, General Secretariat and Bureau of Experts among its administrative organs.[80]\n\nIn the context of continuous development and the provision of services to the population at large, and after the promulgation of the Law of the Council of Ministers by Royal Order No. A/13 on 21 August 1993, several Royal Orders were issued changing the composition of the Council. On 2 August 1995, King Fahd issued a Royal Decree dissolving the Council of Ministers and announcing the names of ministers in the new Cabinet under his chairmanship. On 16 June 1999, Royal Orders made changes to the Cabinet and created a 22nd ministry, the Ministry of Civil Service. On 16 July 2001, the Council of Ministers resolved to divide the Ministry of Agriculture and Water and create a 23rd ministry; the new minister was named on 16 September 2002 and the Ministry of Water came into existence on that date. On 30 April 2003, King Fahd issued a Royal Order renaming a number of ministries and dissolving two of them with effect from 3 May 2003, namely: the Ministry of Public Works and Housing, the functions of which were transferred to the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and to some government agencies; and the Ministry of Industry and Electricity, the electricity section of which was transferred to the Ministry of Water, renamed as the Ministry of Water and Electricity, while its industrial section was transferred to the Ministry of Commerce, renamed as the Ministry of Trade and Industry. On 23 December 2003, he appointed a sixth minister of state with special responsibilities for the affairs of the Consultative Council (Majlis Al-Shura). On 22 March 2004, the Ministry of Labour and Social Services was split into two. Hence, there are now 22 ministers with portfolio. On 24 July 2005, a new minister of state was appointed with special responsibilities for foreign affairs. On 25 March 2011, King Abdullah issued a Royal Order establishing the Ministry of Housing.\n\nOn 7 May 2016, the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources was renamed as the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources; the Ministry of Trade and Industry was renamed as the Ministry of Commerce and Investment; the Ministry of Hajj was renamed as the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah; the Ministry of Water and Electricity was dissolved and a new Ministry of Water, Environment and Agriculture was formed; the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Endowment, Da’wah and Guidance was renamed as the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Da’wah and Guidance; and the Ministries of Labour and Social Affairs were integrated into the Ministry of Labour and Social Development. The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education were merged into one ministry under the name of the Ministry of Education. [81]\n\nA series of Royal Decrees issued on 25 February 2020 formed three new ministries and merged two others. A Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development was established by merging the Ministry of Civil Service with the Ministry of Labour and Social Development. The General Investment Authority was transformed into a Ministry of Investment and the General Authority for Sports was transformed into a Ministry of Sports. Another Royal Order transformed the General Authority for Tourism and National Heritage into a Ministry of Tourism. [82] The Council of Ministers now includes 11 ministers of state and the following 23 ministries:\n\nMinistry of Defence\n\nMinistry of Energy\n\nMinistry of Interior\n\nMinistry of National Guard\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\n\nMinistry of Culture\n\nMinistry of Islamic Affairs, Da’wah and Guidance\n\nMinistry of Justice\n\nMinistry of Media\n\nMinistry of Commerce\n\nMinistry of Investment\n\nMinistry of Health\n\nMinistry of Municipal and Rural Affairs\n\nMinistry of Environment, Water and Agriculture\n\nMinistry of Housing\n\nMinistry of Hajj and Umrah\n\nMinistry of Finance\n\nMinistry of Communications and Information Technology\n\nMinistry of Transport\n\nMinistry of Economy and Planning\n\nMinistry of Human Resources and Social Development\n\nMinistry of Industry and Mineral Resources\n\nMinistry of Tourism\n\nMinistry of Education\n\nMinistry of Sports[83]\n\nRecent changes to the Cabinet are consistent with the general push in the Kingdom towards the achievement of Vision 2030. Some of the reforms clearly address and rationalize instances of duplication or overlapping of governmental authority. It is also clear that the economic and social transformation agenda continues to be a major priority. [84]\n\nLocal governments, branches of ministries and other public agencies in the Kingdom’s various regions are considered to be parts of the executive branch. The Law of the Provinces divides the country into several provinces which are subordinate to the central government and accountable to the Minister of Interior.[85] The Law of the Provinces states that the purpose of dividing the country into several provinces is to improve the level of administrative efficiency and development, maintain security and order and safeguard the rights and freedoms of citizens within the framework of the Islamic Shari’ah. [86] This indicates that the provinces enjoy considerable financial and administrative independence as part of a major effort to decentralize authority in the Kingdom.\n\nIn addition, the Council of Ministers has the power to set up committees to review the conduct of ministries or other government agencies or examine specific cases that might be brought to its attention. [87] Several councils and committees have been established “to address particular issues falling within the Council of Ministers’ function of determining State policy.” The competence and membership of each council or committee and the nature of its decisions are always defined in the decree under which it was established.”[88] Examples of previous established councils and committees include: the Supreme Council for Higher Education, the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, the National Security Council and the Higher Committee for Administrative Reform. Following his accession to the throne on 23 January 2015, King Salman made sweeping changes to office holders and institutions, included abolition of the following councils and commissions:\n\nHigher Committee for Education Policy;\n\nHigher Committee for Administrative Organization;\n\nCivil Service Council;\n\nHigher Commission of King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology;\n\nCouncil for Higher Education and Universities;\n\nSupreme Council for Education;\n\nSupreme Council for Petroleum and Minerals;\n\nSupreme Economic Council;\n\nNational Security Council;\n\nSupreme Council of King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy;\n\nSupreme Council for Islamic Affairs;\n\nSupreme Council for Disabled Affairs.\n\nRoyal Decree No. A/69 of 29 January 2015 established two councils that are administratively linked to the Council of Ministers: the Council of Political and Security Affairs (CPSA) and the Council of Economic and Development Affairs (CEDA). [89] The Council of Political and Security Affairs is composed of several members who are all from the foreign, security and intelligence services: Minister for Foreign Affairs; Minister of Defence; Minister of Interior; Minister of Media; Minister of State for Foreign Affairs; Head of the Intelligence Presidency; Head of the State Security Presidency; National Security Advisor; Minister of the National Guard; Vice-Minister of Defence, and other ministers of State. The Cabinet session of 9 February 2015 approved the organization of the departments of the Council of Ministers and, in particular, the Council of Political and Security Affairs’ responsibility to identify trends, visions and goals in political and security-related fields, to review and coordinate strategies and plans therein and to follow up on their implementation.[90]\n\nThe Council of Economic and Development Affairs is composed of around 22 members,[91] all of whom are appointed by Royal Decree: Minister for Foreign Affairs; Minister of Human Resources and Social Development; Minister of Tourism; Minister of Culture; Minister of Media; Minister of Health; Minister of Education; Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture; Minister of Energy; Minister of Communications and Information Technology; Minister of Housing; Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs; Minister of Finance; Minister of Economy and Planning; Minister of Hajj and Umrah; Minister of Transport; Minister of Justice; Minister of Commerce; Minister of Investment; Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources; Head of the Bureau of Experts; ministers of State and others. The Cabinet session of 9 February 2015 approved the responsibility of the Council of Economic Affairs and Development to identify trends, visions and goals relating to economic affairs and development, to review and coordinate strategies and plans in that regard and to follow up on their implementation. [92]\n\nBoth Councils are currently presided over by H.R.H. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. Each Council has a secretariat attached to the General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers and including a number of advisors and specialists in the areas falling within its field of specialization. Each Council also has a project management office, based in the General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, which is responsible for verifying the commitment of the parties involved in the implementation of strategies, plans, orders, decisions, goals and visions relating to the functions of the Council and monitoring the projects which those parties implement.\n\nVarious independent and quasi-independent administrative agencies have also been established, mainly to address the social, economic and administrative challenges that have been facing the Kingdom since its foundation. These agencies vary widely in their functions, structures and powers, which are defined in the decree under which the agency was established. Most of these agencies are under the direct supervision of the King, in his capacity as Prime Minister, or of the Council of Ministers or particular ministries or government agencies. [93] King Salman has issued a number of Royal Decrees creating several authorities, presidencies, corporations, councils, agencies, funds and centres in order to organize governmental and administrative affairs and cope with the social, economic, financial and security challenges. The previous and recently established government agencies can be classified as:\n\nEconomic Agencies (e.g. General Authority of Civil Aviation, General Authority of Zakat and Tax, Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu, Local Content and Government Procurement Authority, and Saudi Ports Authority);\n\nEducational, Training and Consulting Agencies (e.g. Education Evaluation Commission, Institute of Public Administration, Technical and Vocational Training Corporation and Saudi public universities);\n\nSocial Welfare Agencies (e.g. Public Pension Agency, Saudi Red Crescent Authority and General Organization for Social Insurance);\n\nInvestment and Financial Agencies (e.g. Capital Market Authority, General Real Estate Authority, Saudi Customs Authority, Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank and Saudi Industrial Development Fund);\n\nSecurity Agencies (e.g. Presidency of State Security, General Intelligence Presidency, Saudi Royal Command, National Cybersecurity Authority and National Security Centre);\n\nIslamic Affairs Agencies (e.g. General Presidency of Islamic Research and Ifta, General Presidency of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque and General Presidency of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice);\n\nOversight Agencies (e.g. Control and Anti-Corruption Commission and Human Rights Commission);\n\nCommunication Agencies (e.g. Communications and Information Technology Commission);\n\nIntellectual Agencies (e.g. General Authority for Culture and Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property);\n\nInformation and Information Technology Agencies (e.g. Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority, General Commission for Survey, General Authority for Statistics, Saudi Geological Survey, National Centre for Archives and Records);\n\nDevelopment Agencies (e.g. Economic Cities Authority, Riyadh Royal Authority, Royal Commission for the Governorate of Al-Ula, Makkah Region Development Authority, Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones and Royal Commission for Makkah City and Holy Sites);\n\nSport and Entertainment Agencies (e.g. General Entertainment Authority, Equestrian Club, Falcons Club, and Camel Club);\n\nMedia Agencies (e.g. Saudi Broadcasting Authority and Saudi Press Agency); and\n\nTransport Agencies (e.g. General Authority of Civil Aviation, Public Transport Authority and Saudi Railways Organization). [94]\n\nIn summary, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has taken steady and confident steps towards the future, laying the foundations and constants needed to ensure the country’s growth and prosperity and develop its economy in various state-of-the-art ways that preserve the Kingdom’s achievements as the largest economy in the Middle East region. In this context, and within the framework of Vision 2030, Royal Decrees have been issued establishing a number of new bodies, all of which will work – each in its particular field – to further enhance the country’s financial resources and economic stability, promote promising investment opportunities, attract domestic and foreign investments, address many of the negative aspects observed before their establishment and provide a variety of services to many segments of society .[95]\n\n4.2. The Legislative (Regulatory) Branch\n\nThe Islamic Shari’ah, derived from the Qur’an and the Sunnah, forms the basis of Saudi Arabia’s legal system. The Basic Law uses the term “regulatory authority” to refer to the Kingdom’s legislative authority, which is empowered to enact statutory laws and regulations and approve international treaties, agreements, regulations and concessions. Under the Islamic Shari’ah, God is the sole lawmaker; hence, the word “legislation,” which implies secular law, is not used in the Kingdom. The legislative authority is shared between the King, the Council of Ministers and the Consultative Council (Majlis al-Shura). [96]\n\nThe Basic Law states that the Islamic Shari’ah, divine in origin, is the basis of legislation. In addition to the rules of the Islamic Shari’ah, there is a vast range of statutory laws enacted in criminal, administrative, and commercial areas to keep pace with the Kingdom’s development. The King plays an essential legislative role in support of Shari’ah rule.[97] As the enforcer of divine law, the head of an Islamic State is granted broad discretion over matters of public interest—known as the field of Islamic public policy (al‑siyasah al-shar’iyyah).[98] Public interest ( al-maslahah al-mursalah) is one of the main areas in which Islamic governments such as that of Saudi Arabia deal with the comprehensive development of the country. State regulations are lawful and enforceable as long as they do not contravene divine law. The Saudi Basic Law clearly relies on al-maslahah al-mursalah as a basis for regulation, but only where there is no clear text in Islamic law which could regulate a given issue.[99] The Basic Law stipulates that: “The regulatory authority shall lay down regulations and proposals to further the interests of the State, or remove what might be prejudicial thereto, in conformity with the Islamic Shari’ah. The said authority shall exercise its functions in accordance with this Law and the Laws of the Council of Ministers and the Consultative Council.” [100]\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the King has a major and independent rule-making function. The Basic Law designates the King as the ultimate authority over and above all the State authorities, including the regulatory authority. [101] He is empowered, as Head of State and Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister), to enact, repeal or amend any laws and regulations by Royal Order. [102] In addition, the legislative process, which includes the drafting and enactment of international treaties, agreements, regulations and concessions, is approved or amended by Royal Decrees after first being reviewed by the Kingdom’s legislative bodies (the Council of Ministers and the Shura Council).[103] The King is free to accept or reject proposals from either of those two legislative bodies.\n\n4.2.1. The Council of Ministers\n\nThe Council of Ministers simultaneously undertakes both executive and legislative functions. [104] It shares the legislative function with the King [105] and the Shura Council.[106] Each minister has the right to propose a bill of law or regulation relating to the affairs of his ministry. Any member may propose what he deems worthy of discussion at meetings of the Council of Ministers, subject to approval by the Prime Minister.[107] No meeting of the Council of Ministers is considered valid unless it attains a quorum of at least two thirds of its members. Resolutions are not considered valid without majority approval. In the event of a tied vote, the Prime Minister has a casting vote. In exceptional cases, meetings of the Council of Ministers may be considered valid if only half of the members are present. In such cases, however, resolutions are not considered binding without the approval of at least two thirds of the members present. [108] More significantly, decisions of the Council of Ministers, including those relating to the approval of legislative proposals and amendments, are not considered final until approved by the King. [109]\n\nThe Bureau of Experts is the legislative arm of the Council of Ministers. It consists of a Director, Deputy Director and Assistant Director, a General Panel of Counsellors and several special committees formed as required. The Bureau is entrusted with the following tasks and powers:\n\nReview and study case files referred to it by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister or the Second Deputy Prime Minister, and the Council of Ministers and its sub-committees.\n\nPrepare draft laws and the requisite studies therefor, in cooperation with the agency concerned with each law.\n\nReview and propose amendments to current laws.\n\nStudy agreements and case files establishing general rules or requiring issuance of royal decrees or those which concern more than one government agency.\n\nDraft appropriate forms for Royal Decrees, Prime Ministerial orders and Council of Ministers resolutions.\n\nAssist government agencies in reviewing issues brought before the Supreme Authority, the Council of Ministers or other supreme councils.\n\nThe Bureau has a General Panel of Counsellors consisting of the Director, Deputy Director and Assistant Director as well as counsellors. It convenes to study memorandums and minutes pertaining to bills of law, draft regulations and general rules prepared by members of the Panel and whatever the Chairman decides to bring before the Panel to be put into final format. The chairman and members of the Panel participate in several internal and external committees to review certain issues, take part in quasi-judicial committee meetings and attend conventions and seminars. [110]\n\n4.2.2. The Shura (Consultative) Council\n\nLegislative authority is also shared by the Shura Council, established pursuant to the Basic Law of 1992. In its current form, the Shura Council is an institution intended to exercise oversight functions and allow citizens to participate directly in the administration and planning of national policies and monitor the performance of government agencies, thereby opening up the Saudi decision-making process to greater public scrutiny and accountability. [111] In accordance with the Law of the Shura Council, every four years the King issues a Royal Decree inaugurating a new term of the Council. [112] The Council is composed of a chairman and 150 (previously 120) members. The King chooses the Shura Council members from among scholars and men of learning. [113] Fifty per cent of the Council’s membership must be replaced by newly selected members every four years.[114] Members of the Shura Council may not hold any other governmental or private managerial position unless so permitted by the King. [115]\n\nThe Shura Council submits opinions regarding public policy if so requested by the King, acting in his capacity as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The Council has a broad mandate to comment on State affairs, including: the general economic and social development plan; international laws, charters, treaties, agreements and concessions; the interpretation of State laws; and annual reports submitted by ministries and other governmental bodies.[116] It has specialized committees, staffed by its members, which exercise the powers lying within its jurisdiction. [117] Most importantly, the Shura Council is empowered to propose new bills of law or amendments to existing laws and debate them within the Council. The Speaker of the Council submits its resolutions regarding new or amended laws to the King. [118] Unlike resolutions of the Council of Ministers, two thirds of the Shura Council’s members must approve a legislative proposal or amendment for it to be adopted. Resolutions are not considered valid unless approved by a majority of the Council’s members.[119]\n\nThe opinions of the Shura Council are subject to review by the King, who decides which resolutions will be referred to the Council of Ministers. If the Council of Ministers endorses the views expressed by the Shura Council, the resolutions are issued once the King has granted his approval. Every legislative proposal or amendment which becomes law must be approved by the two Councils and the King. If the views of the two Councils vary, the matter is referred back to the Shura Council which adopts whatever resolution it deems appropriate. The new resolution is then presented to the King, who takes the final decision. [120]\n\nIn the final stages of the enactment of any statutory law, the Council of Ministers considers the resolution adopted by the Shura Council and reviews the minutes that have been prepared by the Bureau of Experts of the Council of Ministers, taking into account any recommendations that might have been made by the General Committee of the Council of Ministers. If the Council of Ministers accepts the Shura Council’s proposal, it endorses the legislation and its secretariat draws up a Royal Decree approving its promulgation. The Royal Decree approving the legislation calls upon the Chairman of the Council of Ministers together with the ministries, within their respective fields of jurisdiction, to implement the Decree in question. The Office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers circulates copies of the Decree to the ministries and departments concerned, including the Shura Council.\n\nIf necessary, the secretariat of the Council of Ministers (Office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers) may issue a letter to the minister concerned laying down rules for the implementation of the regulations contained in the new statutory law. These rules require final approval by the Council of Ministers. The statutory law can then be published in the Official Gazette (Umm al-Qura) and enters into force on the expiration of a period of time (usually specified in the final article of the legislation) following its publication. The original authenticated copy of the enacted legislation is forwarded to the Information and Studies Centre attached to the Office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The National Centre for Documents and Archives, likewise attached to the Council of Ministers, then publishes the new legislation in the Official Gazette (See Chart 5).\n\nChart 5: Legislative Authorities in Saudi Arabia\n\nClick image to enlarge\n\nIt is important to note that, when drafting any legislation, the legislative authority must take care to ensure that the legislation does not conflict with a clear text of the Qur’an or valid Sunnah since they are the Kingdom’s Constitution and take precedence over all other enactments, including the Basic Law. [121] In addition, proposed legislation must comply with the provisions of the fundamental laws (e.g. the Basic Law). Finally, the legislative authority must lay down regulations and proposals to further the interests of the State, and remove what might be prejudicial thereto, in conformity with the Islamic Shari’ah. [122]\n\n4.2.3. Advisory Authorities (The Council of Senior Ulama)\n\nThe Council of Senior Ulama (Religious Scholars) heads the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia. It is an official body, comprising the Kingdom’s most senior scholars, created in 1971 to issue fatwas on questions submitted to it by the Government or otherwise requiring the establishment of general rules. [123] The Basic Law recognizes the need for such a council. It states that: “The source of fatwa (religious legal opinion) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia shall be the Book of God and the Sunnah of His Messenger. The hierarchy and jurisdiction of the Council of Senior Ulama and the Department of Religious Research and Fatwa shall be defined by law.” [124] Although it is not part of the legislative authority, the Council of Senior Ulama has been a participant in the legislative process of enacting statutory laws. In many cases, its participation has been crucial in gaining public support for such laws.[125] In the February 2009 governmental reshuffle, King Abdullah expanded the Council to 21 members and, for the first time in Saudi history, extended membership to representatives from all four schools of Sunni jurisprudence, not solely the Hanbali madhab (school of law). [126] Similar bodies, albeit with a more academic composition and function, exist at the regional level. These include the Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Muslim World League, sponsored by Saudi Arabia and located in Makkah, and the International Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation which has its headquarters in Jeddah.\n\nIn August 2010, King Abdullah issued a Royal Decree stipulating that only officially approved religious scholars associated with the Council of Senior Ulama would be competent to issue fatwas. In the text of the Decree delivered to the Grand Mufti, King Abdullah wrote: “As part of our religious and national duty, we call upon you to ensure that fatwas are issued only by members of the Council of Senior Ulama and other duly authorized persons. Although individual fatwas on matters such as worship and personal relations are exempt from this ruling, they should concern only the questioner. There should be a total ban on any topics involving strange or obsolete views.” The Decree emphasized that it was a violation of Islamic law for unqualified individuals to issue fatwas, since that would undermine the official State institutions and encroach on the State’s jurisdiction. The Decree also instructed the Grand Mufti to designate the scholars qualified to issue fatwas. [127] The Council has established a new Fatwa Committee, affiliated to the Standing Committee, to supervise the issuance of fatwas and prevent unauthorized scholars from interfering therein. The new committee has opened offices throughout the Kingdom and is responsible for appointing approved scholars to evaluate the legitimacy of fatwas. [128] Such restriction was necessary because many individuals had begun to usurp the authority of official religious bodies and were issuing fatwas that gave rise to disputes and dissent among Muslims. [129]\n\n4.3. The Judicial Branch\n\n4.3.1. Introduction\n\nThe previous Saudi judicial system consisted of a Supreme Judicial Council, courts of appeal and courts of first instance (general courts and summary courts). Saudi Arabia also had an administrative judicial body known as the Board of Grievances (an independent administrative judicial system) which functioned in parallel with the court system and reported directly to the King. The Board’s judicial function was exercised through its first instance and appellate courts. Each of these judicial bodies had jurisdiction over cases brought before it in accordance with the law. In addition, the Saudi legal system used to have several administrative committees that adjudicated in civil, commercial, administrative and criminal cases. The judicial jurisdiction of each committee was determined by the decree under which it was constituted.\n\nOn 1 October 2007, King Abdullah issued Royal Decrees approving an overhaul of Saudi Arabia’s judicial system. The Law of the Judiciary established a High Court, which took over the functions of the Supreme Judicial Council as the highest judicial authority in the Kingdom. Another important change was the establishment of appellate courts in each province. The law made provision for specialized labour, commercial, criminal, personal status and civil courts, which are currently being established in areas, regions and centres as needed. Some of these courts are now hearing disputes that had previously been brought before special administrative committees.\n\nThe Law of the Board of Grievances ranks the Board’s hierarchy in the following order: seniority is held by the High Administrative Court, followed by the Administrative Courts of Appeal and, lastly, the Administrative Courts. The High Administrative Court was established to hear objections to rulings of the administrative courts of appeal. The administrative courts have jurisdiction in cases involving administrative decisions, compensation, contracts and disciplinary measures. King Abdullah also approved a functional approach with a view to ensuring a successful transition between the old and new systems.\n\nSince the overhaul of Saudi Arabia’s judicial system has not yet been fully completed, this section presents a brief overview of the previous and current Saudi judicial systems and examines the qualifications, job performance and training of judges together with the safeguards provided to ensure their independence and impartiality.\n\n4.3.2. The Previous Saudi Arabian Court System\n\nIn 1927, a Royal Decree inaugurated a relatively modern and sophisticated system of courts ‑ incorporating, for example, multiple-judge courts and regular appeals — which operated in the cities of Makkah, Madinah and Jeddah. Several Royal Orders were subsequently issued to regulate various aspects of the Shari’ah courts. A Royal Order issued in 1931 included provisions regulating court procedure. [130] In 1938, the Shari’ah Judicial Responsibility Law was promulgated. This Law comprised 282 articles regulating in detail the Shari’ah courts, their types, their jurisdiction and their judgeships. [131] Later, between 1956 and 1960, the jurisdiction of the court system was extended to the entire country, thereby standardizing the national judicial system. More specifically, in 1957, King Sa’ud implemented a judicial reorganization throughout the realm to parallel that found in Makkah, Madinah, and Jeddah. In 1960, he unified the two systems under the Presidency of the Judiciary in Riyadh, which extended the regulations developed for a few cities to the entire country.[132] This was part of the nationwide administrative unification that King Abdulaziz had set in motion when he ordered the creation of the Council of Ministers just before his death on 11 November 1953. In 1970, a Ministry of Justice was created by King Faisal to administer the country’s courts. [133] From 1970 to 1975, a modern administrative system for the courts was created in accordance with the Law of the Judiciary adopted in 1975, which contained several sections covering various aspects of the current judicial system; this will be examined later in the present study. The revitalization of Saudi Arabia’s judicial system reflects the nation’s adaptability to modern developments without compromising its religious and cultural values. [134]\n\nThe Basic Law of Governance requires courts to “…apply the rules of the Islamic Shari’ah in the cases that are brought before them, in accordance with what is prescribed in the Qur’an, the Sunnah and laws and statutes decreed by the Ruler which do not contradict the Book or the Sunnah.” [135] The application of Islamic law in the Saudi Arabian courts is based primarily on the rules of the Islamic Shari’ah as interpreted by the Hanbali school, the fourth orthodox school of law within Sunni Islam. [136] Although Saudi judges generally adhere to the Hanbali school of law, they theoretically enjoy a certain degree of discretion in adjudicating cases and are constrained solely by their own conscience in determining the will of God. [137] A Saudi judge is “guided … not only by the rules of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudential) doctrine but … by his own understanding of the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah that support those rules; he believes that his judgment comes directly from those texts, not from the Hanbali books.” [138] Saudi judges also see themselves as morally guided and “…often appear as concerned with the present moral state of the parties as with their past acts or with legal outcomes.”[139] The judicial decisions of Saudi judges are legally valid and cannot be overruled unless they contradict an evident precept of the Qur’an or Sunnah or disregard interpretations or principles applied by higher courts. Saudi judges apply “ijtihad” [140] to reach decisions in cases not covered by the provisions of the Shari’ah. In such cases, they apply Islamic jurisprudential tools (e.g. analogy) to the sacred sources. In addition to the rules of the Islamic Shari’ah, a vast range of statutory laws have been enacted in criminal, administrative and commercial fields as required by the Kingdom’s development.\n\nThe competence of the previous Saudi judicial system was defined by the Law of the Judiciary, adopted in 1975. It was then reconfirmed in 1992 by the Basic Law of Governance. According to the Law of the Judiciary and the Basic Law of Governance, the courts have jurisdiction in all disputes and offences except those exempted from their jurisdiction by law. [141] However, different laws and regulations have granted jurisdiction in certain claims and offences to either the Board of Grievances or Administrative Committees. [142]\n\n4.3.2.1. The Structure of the Previous Shari’ah (Ordinary) Court System\n\nThe 1975 Law of the Judiciary organized the court system in the following hierarchical order:\n\nSupreme Judicial Council;\n\nCourts of Appeal; and,\n\nCourts of First Instance (General Courts and Summary Courts).\n\nEach of these courts had jurisdiction in cases brought before it in accordance with the law (see Chart 6). [143]\n\nChart 6: Simple Structure of the Previous Shari’ah (Ordinary) Court System\n\n4.3.2.1.1. Supreme Judicial Council\n\nArticle 5 of the Law of the Judiciary of 1975 designated the Supreme Judicial Council as the highest authority in the current judicial system. [144] The Supreme Judicial Council was composed of 11 members. Five full-time members held the rank of Appellate Chief Justice and constituted the Standing Panel of the Council.[145] Five part-time members included an Appellate Chief Justice or his deputy, the Deputy Minister of Justice and three members with the longest record of service as chief judges of the general courts in Makkah, Madinah, Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam and Jazan. All the members constituted the Plenary Panel of the Council, which was presided over by its chairman. [146] The Supreme Judicial Council was convened “as a Standing Panel composed of its full-time members, presided over by its chairman or by a person designated from amongst the most senior members of the judiciary.” [147]\n\nUnder the 1975 Law of the Judiciary, the Supreme Judicial Council exercised several administrative, legislative, consultative and judicial functions. In its administrative function—as defined by article 7 of the Law—the Council played a supervisory role in the court system within the limits laid down by the Law. [148] It was responsible primarily for “supervising the courts, administering the employment-related affairs of all members of the judiciary, such as appointment, promotion, transfer, assignment and secondment, within the limits laid down by the Law, monitoring the proper discharge of their duties and assigning members of the Inspectorate to inspect, discipline and terminate the services of judges.”[149]\n\nIn its judicial function, the Council reviewed judgments in certain types of cases involving qisas (retaliatory punishment), hudud (Qur’anic prescribed punishment) and ta’zir (discretionary punishment) penalties. In its legislative function, the Council’s role was crucial in establishing general principles and judicial precedents that lower courts were required to follow; the Council also looked into Shari’ah questions, referred to it by the Minister of Justice, which required a statement of general Shari’ah principles. In its consultative function, the Council reviewed and provided opinions on matters referred to it by the King or the Minister of Justice. [150] Meetings of the Council’s Standing Panel were governed by certain procedural regulations concerning attendance and voting. [151]\n\n4.3.2.1.2. Courts of Appeal (Courts of Cassation)\n\nThe Saudi Courts of Appeal were the second tier in the previous Saudi Arabian “ordinary judicial system.” A Court of Appeal was composed of a chief justice and a sufficient number of senior judges from the legal community. The Court consisted of several panels with jurisdiction in criminal, personal status and other cases not falling within the other two categories. The Court of Appeal was empowered to establish as many panels as it needed and these panels were presided over by the chief justice or one of his deputies.[152] Previously, there were two Courts of Appeal in Saudi Arabia. One was in Makkah, which heard appeals from the lower courts in the western provinces, while the other was in Riyadh, which heard appeals from the lower courts in the central and eastern provinces. However, in the public interest and on the basis of a decision of the Court’s General Council, some of the panels used to hold all or part of their hearings in another city or establish branches in other cities. [153]\n\nThe Court of Appeal’s ruling was always delivered by a three-judge panel. However, in certain types of cases involving qisas, hudud andta’zir penalties, a five-judge panel delivered the ruling. [154] Panels of the Court of Appeal used to issue contradictory rulings because the Court’s primary concern was to review the general and summary courts’ application of the Shari’ah. The General Council of the Court of Appeal was assigned to settle those conflicts and harmonize the principles applied by the summary courts, the general courts or panels of the Court of Appeal. [155] The General Council of the Court of Appeal consisted only of active judges. [156] It was convened to consider “…organizing and forming the necessary panels and specifying their respective jurisdictions.” [157] It also discussed “…matters which, under the provisions of the Law of the Judiciary of 1975 or other laws, are to be examined by a plenary session of the Court.” [158] More importantly, it decided on whether interpretations or principles should be abandoned. Article 14 of the 1975 Law of the Judiciary stipulated that:\n\nIf one of the Court’s panels, while reviewing a case, deems it necessary to depart from an interpretation adopted by the same or another panel in previous judgments, the case shall be referred to a plenary ( en banc) session of the Court. Permission for such departure shall be given by a decision of the plenary session adopted by a majority vote of not less than two thirds of its members. If the plenary session does not so render its decision, it shall refer the case to the Supreme Judicial Council for a decision. [159]\n\nMeetings of the General Council of the Court of Appeal were governed by certain regulations concerning members’ attendance and voting. [160] In general, the Courts of Appeal monitored the manner in which legal rules and the provisions of regulations were interpreted and applied by the general and summary courts. However, the primary function of the Court of Appeal was to review or hear objections to judgments issued by lower courts, which could be lodged either by the convicted person or the public prosecutor. Objections by convicted persons were permitted within 30 days from the date of the appellant’s receipt of a copy of the judgment, not counting official holidays.[161]\n\nThere were several circumstances in which a judgment warranted an automatic appeal to the Court of Appeal without a party filing an appeal, such as cases involving abduction, burglary or offences punishable by the death penalty. In particular, these circumstances included:\n\nCases in which the convicted person was the administrator of a waqf (religious endowment), a testamentary or legal guardian, a public treasury official or the equivalent thereof or if he was tried in absentia; cases involving abduction, burglary or offences punishable by death or amputation; cases in which the discretionary penalty exceeded forty lashes or ten days’ imprisonment; and cases in which the discretionary penalty involved both flogging and imprisonment. [162]\n\nHowever, the Directives for the Review of Legal Judgments stipulated that judgments were final and not subject to review when the penalty imposed did not exceed—for example—500 riyals (US$ 133) in cash or when the penalty imposed was a ta’zir [163] (discretionary punishment) not exceeding forty lashes or ten days’ imprisonment. [164] The Court of Appeal usually reviewed cases without holding hearings unless they were necessary. [165] Appellants did not appear before the Court unless it decided otherwise. [166] The Court of Appeal had discretionary power to “permit appellants to submit new evidence to support the grounds of their appeal.” [167]\n\nFinally, it is noteworthy that the Court of Appeal did not reverse lower court judgments; it either upheld and finalized such judgments unanimously or by majority vote or referred them back to the lower court trial judge(s) for modification with whatever comments it wished to make. If the judge(s) of the lower court maintained his/their opinion, the Court of Appeal could overrule the original judgment and have another judge or panel of the lower court review the case. [168]\n\n4.3.2.1.3. First-Instance Courts\n\nThere were two types of first-instance courts under the previous Saudi Arabian court system:\n\nSummary Courts; and,\n\nGeneral Courts.\n\nSummary Courts: Summary courts were composed of one or more judges. The composition, jurisdiction and designation of the summary courts were determined by decision of the Minister of Justice on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council.[169] The judgments of these courts were handed down by a single judge. [170] Summary courts used to have jurisdiction in certain hudud [171] (fixed punishment) cases, ta’zir cases (except those excluded by law) and decisions involving monetary damages or compensation that did not exceed one third of the diyah (blood money), [172] corresponding to 20,000 Saudi riyals or US$ 6,000). [173] They had jurisdiction in civil claims for sums amounting to less than 8,000 Saudi riyals (US$ 2,133).[174] There were more than 14 summary courts in Saudi Arabia. [175] A judge from each Shari’ah summary court was designated to hear juvenile cases at a social surveillance centre or welfare institution in accordance with the procedures for the trial of juveniles. [176]\n\nGeneral Courts: The second type of first-instance court was the general court. These were composed of one or more judges. The composition, jurisdiction and designation of the Saudi Shari’ah general courts were determined by decision of the Minister of Justice on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council.[177] In particular, the general courts had jurisdiction to hear offences for which the penalty prescribed was either the death penalty or qisas (retaliatory punishment). [178] They also had jurisdiction in civil claims for sums totalling more than 20,000 Saudi riyals (US$ 6,000). A single judge rendered judgment in a general court, except in cases involved penalties such as death or retaliatory punishment which required a three-judge panel. [179] In such cases, the judges hearing the case decided on the appropriate discretionary punishment or otherwise, as required by the Shari’ah. [180]\n\nGeneral courts were not empowered to impose a death sentence by way of ta’zir, except by unanimous decision of the panel of judges. According to Article 129 of the Law of Criminal Procedure of 2001: “Failing such unanimity, the Minister of Justice shall assign two additional judges who, together with the three already sitting, shall be empowered to impose, either unanimously or by majority vote, a death sentence by way of ta’zir.”[181] There were more than 22 general courts in Saudi Arabia. [182]\n\nThe Law of the Judiciary of 1975 vested the Minister of Justice with power to define the jurisdiction of summary and general courts on the basis of a recommendation by the Supreme Judicial Council. [183] A similar provision gave the Minister of Interior the authority to specify, on the basis of a recommendation by the Director of the Bureau of Investigation and Public Prosecution, acts that constituted major offences warranting detention. [184] In 1976, the Minister of Justice issued an order defining the jurisdiction of the summary courts, as previously mentioned. In 2002, the Minister of Interior likewise issued an order defining acts that could be deemed to constitute major offences.[185] Finally, it is noteworthy that litigation before the Shari’ah courts is governed by the Law of Procedure before Shari’ah Courts adopted in 2000 and the Law of Criminal Procedure adopted in 2001.[186]\n\nSpecial Courts: The Law of the Judiciary permitted the establishment of specialized courts “by Royal Order on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council.” [187] Two types of specialized court where established within the court system: the Courts of Guarantee and Marriage (in Riyadh and Makkah) [188] which exercised jurisdiction in civil suits concerning marriage, divorce and child custody [189] and the Juvenile Court (in Riyadh) which heard cases of juvenile delinquency. [190] In other provinces, juvenile cases were heard by a judge from the court exercising local jurisdiction. In districts or provinces that had juvenile care centres, the summary court used to assign one of its judges to adjudicate such cases in those centres.\n\n4.3.2.2. The Previous Structure of the Board of Grievances System (Administrative Courts)\n\nThe Board of Grievances (Diwan al-Mazalim) is the administrative judicial system of Saudi Arabia. Prior to the creation of the Board of Grievances in 1954, King Abdulaziz, following traditions set by Islamic rulers, personally adjudicated grievances and disputes, including those against government officials. King Abdulaziz made himself accessible daily to any citizen who appeared at his court with a grievance or a concern. Most effectively, he had installed next to the gate of his palace a box to which he alone possessed the key. A notice next to the box encouraged citizens to place therein any complaints that they had against an official, adding that “anyone who refrains from complaining of any injustice that he suffers at the hands of any official, whether senior or low-ranking, has no one to blame but himself.” [191] However, the notice required any complaint to be made in writing and duly signed. Any false complaints would be investigated and punished, while any anonymous or pseudonymous complaints would be ignored. [192] As the Kingdom expanded territorially, King Abdulaziz required all his government officials to be as committed to this concept as he was. [193]\n\nAn increasing number of disputes between government agencies and private contractors led to the creation of the Board of Grievances, which closely resembled the Conseil d’Etat (Council of State) in France, being the Supreme Court for administrative justice. [194] It was first formed as a department of the Council of Ministers pursuant to the latter’s Law. [195] However, in 1955, a Royal Decree declared it an independent board. The Board of Grievances had the authority to receive and investigate complaints, after which it would submit its report on the facts and circumstances surrounding each complaint, together with its recommendations, to the government minister concerned. Within two weeks of his receipt of the report, the minister was required to respond to the Board. If he did not accept the Board’s recommendations, the Board would refer the matter to the King, who had the final decision on the matter. [196] At a later date, the Board was assigned jurisdiction in disputes of a criminal nature such as bribery and commercial fraud, which transformed the Board’s function from administrative and investigative to judicial and adjudicative. [197] In 1967, the King issued a Royal Order according the Board judicial independence from the Shari’ah court system. The Order stipulated that no lawsuit against a government agency should be heard by any Shari’ah court without the King’s consent.[198]\n\nIn 1982, an enactment made significant changes to the nature of the Board of Grievances. The enactment established an independent administrative judicial body called the Board of Grievances that functioned in parallel to the Shari’ah courts, reporting directly to the King and operating outside the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice. [199] The Board of Grievances was composed of a President, one or more Vice-Presidents and a number of Assistant Vice-Presidents and members specialized in Shari’ah and law.[200]\n\nAlthough article 1 stated that the Board was an independent administrative judicial body, it was authorized to hear cases and disputes to which the Administration was not a party. It was empowered to temporarily adjudicate criminal and commercial disputes and had exclusive authority to enforce foreign judgments and foreign arbitration awards. It covered four main categories of disputes:\n\nDisputes to which the Government was a party;\n\nDisputes involving unethical business practices subject to statutory provisions;\n\nDisciplinary actions against civil servants; and,\n\nExecution of foreign judgments.\n\nAccording to article 8 of the Law of the Board of Grievance adopted in 1982, the Board was competent to adjudicate the following administrative disputes:\n\nCases relating to the rights provided for in the Civil Service and Pension Laws;\n\nObjections filed against administrative decisions on grounds of lack of jurisdiction, defect of form, violation or erroneous application or interpretation of laws and regulations or abuse of authority;\n\nCompensation claims filed against the Government and independent public corporate entities in respect of their actions;\n\nCases involving contractual disputes to which the Government or an independent public corporate entity is a party;\n\nDisciplinary cases filed by the Bureau of Control and Investigation;\n\nCriminal proceedings brought against persons suspected of committing legally punishable offences of forgery, offences covered by the Repression of Bribery Law, offences covered by Royal Decree No. 43 of 29/11/1377 A.H. [16 June 1958], offences covered by the Misappropriation of Public Funds Law promulgated by Royal Decree No. 77 of 23/10/1395 A.H. [29 October 1975] and criminal proceedings brought against persons accused of committing legally punishable offences in which an order to hear such cases had been issued to the Board by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers;\n\nRequests for implementation of foreign judgments;\n\nCases falling within the jurisdiction of the Board in accordance with special legal provisions; [201] and,\n\nRequests by foreign courts to carry out precautionary seizure of property or funds inside the Kingdom. [202]\n\nIn addition, the Council of Ministers was authorized, under article 8, paragraph 2, of the 1982 Law of the Board of Grievances, to expand the Board’s jurisdiction. [203] However, the Board of Grievances did not hear requests pertaining to sovereign acts or objections filed by individuals against judgments or decisions delivered by courts or legal panels falling within their jurisdiction. [204]\n\nThe 1982 Law of the Board of Grievances offered limited guidance concerning the Board’s judicial structure, hierarchy and branches. It merely stated that the Board’s headquarters would be in the capital city [205] and that it “…would exercise its powers through circuits the number, formation, subject matter and venue of which would be determined by decision of the President of the Board.”[206] In addition to its headquarters in Riyadh, the Board had three branches, in Jeddah, Dammam and Abha.[207] The Board’s judicial hierarchy consisted of a number of specialized circuits with specific jurisdiction defined by several decisions of the Board’s President.[208] The 1982 Law and the 1989 Law of Procedure of the Board of Grievances defined the hierarchical structure of the Board of Grievances as follows:\n\nBoard of Appeal;\n\nAppellate Circuits; and,\n\nFirst-Instance Circuits (see Chart 7). [209]\n\nChart 7: Simple Structure of the Previous Board of Grievances System\n\n4.3.2.2.1. Board of Appeal Circuits\n\nThe Board of Appeal Circuits was the highest authority in the Board of Grievances’ system. The Board consisted of all the members of the appellate circuits and three members of the first-instance circuits who were selected by the Board’s President. [210] However, unlike the Supreme Judicial Council, which had broad jurisdiction comprising several administrative, legislative, consultative and judicial functions, the Board of Appeal decided only on the abandonment of interpretations or principles. If an appellate panel, when deciding a case, deemed it necessary to depart from an interpretation adopted or upheld by the same or another appellate panel, the matter was referred to the President of the Board, who submitted it to the Board of Appeal. A majority, tallying at least two thirds of the members of the Board of Appeal, was needed to adopt a new principle or precedent.[211]\n\n4.3.2.2.2. Appellate Circuits\n\nThe Board’s appellate hierarchy comprised a number of administrative, criminal and commercial “scrutinizing circuits” (hereinafter “appellate circuits”) that functioned as appellate courts and had the final decision in grievances. Previously, there were three appellate circuits established to carry out the functions of the Board of Grievances, thereby acting as administrative courts. The jurisdiction of these circuits was defined by several decisions of the President of the Board. [212] Appellate circuits were composed of three members appointed by the President of the Board, who designated one of them as the senior member of the panel. The President of the Board had discretionary authority to form an appellate panel consisting of one member to hear appeals in “minor cases” specified by a regulation. [213]\n\nThe 1989Law of Procedure of the Board of Grievances defined the judicial relationship between the appellate and first-instance circuits. Under those rules, an appellate panel either reversed or upheld a judgment. In the event of reversal, it referred the case back to the issuing panel for adjudication. The appellate panel adjudicated cases in which, having been referred back to the panel which originally heard them, the latter panel insisted on its judgment and the appellate panel was not persuaded by the latter’s arguments. If the appellate panel adjudicated the case, its decision was taken only after hearing the statements of the litigants. In such case, the judgment delivered by the appellate panel was final. [214] Judgments upheld by the appellate panel were also final. However, in criminal and disciplinary cases, final judgment was reviewed if new evidence emerged that might lead to acquittal. In such circumstances, the final judgment was reviewed within 30 days of the panel having received knowledge of the new evidence. [215]\n\n4.3.2.2.3. First-Instance Circuits\n\nAt the lower level of this hierarchical system, there were a number of first-instance administrative, criminal, disciplinary, commercial and subsidiary circuits that reflected the diverse jurisdiction of the Board. [216] Due to the Board’s administrative and non-administrative jurisdiction, large numbers of judicial circuits were created to undertake the Board’s caseload. [217] The Board’s first-instance circuits were modified regularly. Over 80 circuits were created, one third of which were devoted to the adjudication of commercial disputes and criminal cases. [218] First-instance circuits were also composed of three members appointed by the President of the Board, who designated one of them as the senior member. The President of the Board had discretionary authority to form first-instance circuits consisting of one member to hear “minor cases” specified by a regulation. [219]\n\nAdministrative proceedings were instituted when a plaintiff filed a complaint with the President of the Board of Grievances or a person designated by him. The President then referred the case to the competent circuit.[220] When a particular circuit received an administrative case, it set a hearing date and informed the plaintiff, the defendant and other administrative bodies in accordance with articles 2 and 3 of the Rules of Procedure of 1989. [221] The hearings were conducted in public unless the circuit decided to hold them in camera in order to safeguard morals or preserve public order. [222] The competent circuit rendered its judgment after examining the case documents and hearing the statements of both parties to the dispute, or their representatives, and confidentially deliberating in session. In circuits consisting of more than one member, judgments were rendered by majority vote.[223] The circuit’s judgment recorded only a substantiated verdict. Any dissenting opinion was noted in the session minutes, which also indicated the majority response to such dissent.[224] A first-instance circuit judgment became final unless the parties decided to exercise their right to appeal the judgment within 30 days from the date of receipt of the judgment notice.[225]\n\n4.3.3. Administrative Committees\n\nSeveral Administrative Committees with judicial powers had been periodically created since the unification of Saudi Arabia in 1932. These committees had jurisdiction in civil, commercial, administrative and criminal cases and disputes arising from the implementation of several laws and provisions. The jurisdiction of each committee was determined by the decree that created it. Examples of administrative committees are:\n\nThe Tax Committees; [226]\n\nThe Committees for the Penalization of Traffic Violations; [227]\n\nThe Mining Disputes Committee; [228]\n\nThe Fraud, Misrepresentation and Speculation Committee; [229]\n\nThe Banking Disputes Settlement Committee; [230] and,\n\nThe Copyright Committee. [231]\n\nThe Basic Law of Governance did not recognize these committees as part of the judicial authority. Although they were established to help to ease the heavy caseload of the Saudi courts and cope with the Kingdom’s social and economic development requirements, they were subject to criticism insofar as they introduced adjudicative action by the “Executive Branch.” [232]\n\nChart 8: Structure of the Previous Judicial System in Saudi Arabia\n\nClick to enlarge image\n\n4.3.4. The Current Judicial System\n\nOn 2 April 2005, a Royal Order was issued approving amendments in principle to the structure of the judicial system. According to the 2005 Royal Order, “Courts specialized in labour, commercial, civil and criminal cases are to have complete jurisdiction in their areas of specialization. The jurisdiction of the new specialized courts and the general courts shall be defined so as to avoid conflict over jurisdiction.” [233] Article 49 of the Basic Law states that “courts [of different types and levels] are empowered to arbitrate in all disputes and crimes.” [234] To pave the way for an effective national judicial system and overcome the obstacles facing judges and litigants, the Government annulled the Law of the Judiciary of 1975 and took the initiative to develop a “New Judicial System” comparable to those of other countries around the world in order to achieve sustainable development. On 1 October 2007, King Abdullah issued a Royal Decree approving a new body of laws regulating the judiciary and the Board of Grievances. The new laws replaced regulations that had been in force for more than 30 years in the case of the judiciary, and about 25 years in the case of the Board of Grievances. The Kingdom allocated a budget of 7 billion riyals (US$ 1.8 billion) to revamp the judicial sector with a view to upgrading the judiciary and developing it in a comprehensive and integrated manner.[235] These funds are being used to renovate and build new courts and train judges. The Saudi judiciary is now passing through a transitional period in which the “New Judicial System” is in the process of being fully implemented.[236] The most important features of the new system are as follows:\n\nMultiplicity of courts of general jurisdiction, and diversity within the Kingdom’s judicial system; the Law of the Judiciary of 2007 reorganizes the courts of general jurisdiction and divides them into three categories: the High Court at the top of the judicial hierarchy and the Courts of Appeal in the middle, followed by the First-Degree Courts at the lowest level.\n\nStandardization of the various court judgments pursuant to the provisions of the Law of the Judiciary of 2007, which stresses the principle of harmonization of the various court judgments in their application of legal and regulatory rules. This can be achieved through the High Court at the top of the judicial hierarchy to oversee the legality of the courts’ application of Shari’ah law and the legal rules and regulations in force in the Kingdom.\n\nAdoption of the judicial appeal system; the new court system applies the principle of two levels of litigation under which any case can be reviewed by a Court of Appeal and the High Court to ensure justice.\n\nImplementation of the principle of specialization in the courts of general jurisdiction and within a single court; application of the principle of specialized courts allows case management, expedites case processing and reduces caseload and time to disposition, thereby increasing trial capacity for more serious offences. In addition, a trial judge with specialized expertise in the subject matter of cases is in a better position to effectively impose and monitor such case management controls; a specialized judge would require less time to research and reflect on the fundamental issues of the case and could offer direction and guidance to the attorneys at an earlier stage of the case than a generalist judge. Moreover, trial judges frequently make case-related determinations extemporaneously with little time or support available to them for research, consultation, reflection or the articulation of positions in carefully drafted opinions.\n\nMultiplicity of the same type of courts throughout the Kingdom to provide easy access to judicial services for all citizens. [237]\n\nIn a further step in the development of the judiciary, Royal Decree No. M/1 of 25 November 2013 enacting a new Law of Procedure before Shari’ah Courts was supplemented by Royal Decree No. M/2 of the same date enacting a new Law of Criminal Procedure. The two Laws focus on the objective rather than the personal aspect from the stage of preliminary litigation to appeal, specify the channels of appeal against court rulings, define the pleading procedures before higher courts and higher administrative courts, guarantee the right of defence for the accused, including the right of access to legal counsel even for persons unable to afford it, secure the right of women to expeditious litigation and appeal procedures, curb procrastination as far as litigation procedures before religious courts are concerned, ensure free-of-charge flexible procedures and shorten the duration of litigation. In compliance with the two Laws, the Council of Ministers adopted resolution No. 142 of 1 January 2015 enacting the Implementing Regulations of the Law of Criminal Procedure, followed by the Minister of Justice’s order No. 39933 of 20 March 2014 enacting the Implementing Regulations of the Law of Procedure before Sharia’h Courts. [238]\n\nIn conclusion, the intention of the Government is to shape the Saudi judicial system so that it can meet a higher judicial standard set by ongoing reforms beginning with the promulgation of the Law of Criminal Procedure and the Law of Procedure before Shari’ah Courts in 2013. The new Laws responded to the social and economic needs of Saudi society and constituted a major step toward meeting the requirements of a modern and thriving economy, while also improving the business environment. The Laws affirm the independent and impartial nature of the Saudi judicial system and will also ensure the highest possible fair trial"
