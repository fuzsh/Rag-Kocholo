According to Saudi news media, half of the marriages in the country end in divorce, and the high number of forced marriages is thought to be the main reason behind the growing divorce rate.

The bill requires the consent of both parents and approval by three doctors and the coroner's office. The measure still needs approval from the watchdog Guardian Council before it can become a law.

An Iranian doctor, Shahram Azam, who is in exile in Canada, said this month that he had examined Ms. Kazemi in Tehran and had seen signs that she had been tortured and raped while in custody. Iran's position is that Ms. Kazemi, 54, died after falling and hitting her head. In Canada, a spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre Pettigrew, denounced Iran's decision, saying it was consistent with its \"pattern of cover-up and lies.\" Nazila Fathi (NYT)\n\nWEST BANK: PALESTINIAN YOUTH WITH PIPE BOMBS HELD Israeli troops seized a 15-year-old Palestinian boy at a major West Bank checkpoint when he tried to detonate one of five pipe bombs hidden in his overcoat, the military said. It said the youth aroused suspicion at the Hawara checkpoint outside Nablus because he was wearing a heavy coat on a day when temperatures were in the 80's. The soldiers pounced on him when he removed one of the pipe bombs and tried to light it, the military said.\n\nGreg Myre (NYT)\n\nAFRICA\n\nSUDAN: DONORS PLEDGE $4.5 BILLION AT OSLO TALKS Leaders from at least 50 nations at a donors' conference in Oslo pledged more than $4.5 billion to rebuild southern Sudan after more than 20 years of civil war, but one official after another warned that continuing violence in the western Darfur region would undermine the peace agreement they were there to support. The promised amount was almost $2 billion more than aid officials had said Sudan needed. The United States pledged from $1 billion to $2 billion; the range is a result of uncertainty over how much Congress will approve. \"This is a time of choosing for Sudan,\" Robert B. Zoellick, the deputy secretary of state, said at the conference. \"The leaders of Sudan must realize that the eyes of the world are on Sudan.\" German and Norwegian officials, among others, echoed the sentiment. Kjell Magne Bondevik, the Norwegian prime minister, said, \"There is no peace in Sudan until the situation in Darfur has been solved.\"\n\nJoel Brinkley (NYT)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
