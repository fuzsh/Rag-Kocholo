        "meta_description": "Makkah, June 10, 2024, SPA -- The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, has issued a royal decree to host 1,000 pilgrims from the families of martyrs and the wounded from the Gaza Strip under the title: “Hosting Initiative for Pilgrims from the Families of Martyrs and the Wounded from the Gaza Strip” to perform Hajj this year.\n    This brings the total number of hosted pilgrims from Palestine to 2,000, within the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques' Guests Program for Hajj, Umrah and Visit, implemented by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah, and Guidance.\n    On this occasion, the Minister of Islamic Affairs, Dawah, and Guidance, who oversees the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques' Guests Program for Hajj, Umrah, and Visit, Sheikh Dr. Abdullatif bin Abdulaziz Al Al-Sheikh, extended his thanks and appreciation to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Crown Prince and Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n    The minister commended them for this noble gesture, which reflects their constant concern and continuous care for the Palestinian people and demonstrates the Kingdom's unwavering support for the Palestinian cause on all levels. He stated that this exceptional hosting alleviates the hardships faced by the Palestinian people in Gaza. He also emphasized that this humanitarian gesture is not unfamiliar to the Kingdom, which has stood alongside the Palestinian people since the era of the late founder King Abdulaziz through to the present era of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and HRH the Crown Prince. This reflects their ongoing concern for the issues of the Islamic nation in general and the Palestinian cause in particular, the minister noted.\n    He further emphasized that this humanitarian gesture from the Kingdom's leadership, enabling the martyrs' families and the injured from Gaza to perform Hajj, is an extension of the Kingdom's efforts and its continuous support for the brothers in Palestine. Moreover, the minister pointed out that since the issuance of the royal decree, the ministry has been preparing to receive the guests of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques from the martyrs' families and the injured in Palestine and has developed a plan for this purpose through several committees tasked with caring for them and enabling them to perform Hajj with ease and convenience. He also prayed that Almighty Allah keeps the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and HRH the Crown Prince safe, blesses their efforts, accepts the Hajj of the pilgrims, and accepts their righteous deeds.\n    -- SPA\n02:50 Local Time 23:50 GMT\n0004",
