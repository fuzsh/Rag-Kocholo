This can severely affect overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services.\n\nExercise caution\n\nMonitor local news and weather reports\n\nFollow the advice of local authorities\n\nSand storms\n\nThe weather is very dry and hot from May to October. Sand storms and dust storms may occur during the summer months.\n\nShamals, sand-laden winds from the northern deserts, occur most frequently in early summer and can blow at significant speeds for days, creating difficult driving conditions. These storms can also cause respiratory problems, which can be fatal for some people.\n\nIf a dust storm is occurring:\n\nstay indoors\n\nkeep windows closed\n\nbe prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip\n\nmonitor local media for up-to-date information on the situation"
