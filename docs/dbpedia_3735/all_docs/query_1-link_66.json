        "text": "Inter-company transactions\n\nReporting for “worldwide activities”- The reporting unit is your company, including all domestic and foreign subsidiaries that are more than 50% owned by your company for financial reporting purposes. All transactions between subdivisions within this reporting unit should be eliminated as inter-company transactions. For reporting purposes, your foreign parent (if you are foreign owned) and any foreign affiliates your company does not own by more than 50%, should not be treated as part of ‘your company’ in your report. Transactions with these units should be treated the same as with any unrelated third parties such as business partners, customers, or suppliers you do not own.\n\nReporting for “domestic operations”- In this survey “domestic operations” refers to your company’s operations located in the 50 United States and District of Columbia. When reporting for your domestic operations, include transactions with foreign subsidiaries. For example, Question 1-13 asks how much of your company’s total sales and revenues were from your company’s domestic operations. All revenue from the domestic operations, including sales to subsidiaries or affiliated companies overseas, should be reported in this question.\n\n1-2 Did another U.S. company own more than 50% of the voting interest in your company during 2023?\n\nQuestion 1-2 asks about the majority of the ownership of the voting interest of the company receiving the survey. Special reporting instructions apply to companies that have been acquired by another company. If your answer is “No”, continue to Question 1-3. If your answer is “Yes”, read the instructions below, enter the name of the parent company, the EIN of the owner, and the date that your parent company purchased your company.\n\nIn general, this survey asks companies to report consolidated data for all companies it owns. However, some companies may own other companies without taking an active role in those other companies' operations and management. In these cases, such as with some holding companies and private equity firms, the owners are unlikely to have the information needed to complete this survey. Therefore, if your company is owned by a holding company, private equity firm, or other party that does not take an active role in your company's management and operations we request that you complete this survey and report for your company and all other companies owned by your company.\n\nREPORTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR U.S.-OWNED COMPANIES:\n\nIf your company was purchased on or after April 1, 2023, report only for the period January 1, 2023 to the date of purchase. If your company was purchased before April 1, 2023, complete question 1-7 and return this form to the Census Bureau – you are not required to complete the rest of this survey.\n\nExample 1: Company A was acquired by Company P (a U.S. company) on Feb. 1, 2023. Because Company A was acquired by a U.S. company prior to April 1, 2023, Company A is not required to complete this survey. Company A will answer Question 1-7 and return the form to the Census Bureau.\n\nExample 2: Company B is acquired by Company P (a U.S. company) on July 1, 2023. Because Company B was acquired by a U.S. company on or after April 1, 2023, Company B must complete the survey, reporting data for the period January 1, 2023 through July 1, 2023.\n\nWhy April 1?\n\nThe Census Bureau has determined that for this survey the benefit of collecting data from a company for a period less than one quarter of a year does not outweigh the burden placed on the company to report the data.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nCompanies are asked this question for three reasons: to eliminate double counting in cases where both parties in a business acquisition receive the survey; to guide foreign-owned companies to special instructions; and to reduce the burden on companies who would otherwise be reporting data for a period less than one quarter of the year.\n\n1-4 Was your company a majority-owned subsidiary of a foreign company in 2023?\n\nQuestion 1-4 asks about the ownership of the company receiving the survey. Special reporting instructions apply to companies that were majority-owned by a foreign company. If your answer is “No”, continue to Question 1-5. If your answer is “Yes”, read the instructions below and enter the name of the parent company then proceed to Question 1-5.\n\nREPORTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR FOREIGN-OWNED COMPANIES:\n\nIf your company is owned by a foreign parent, the reporting unit for the survey is your U.S.- located company, including all your majority-owned subsidiaries and divisions regardless of location. For reporting purposes, your foreign parent, and any foreign affiliates your company does not own should be treated the same as any business partner, customer, or supplier you do not own.\n\nIf you pay your foreign parent for R&D services, those costs should be included in your responses in Section 2 as “costs for purchased R&D services.”\n\nIf your foreign parent pays or reimburses your company for R&D services, the costs for this R&D should be included in your responses in Section 3 as “costs funded, paid for, or reimbursed by others.”\n\nReport your survey data using U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) as recognized by the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB). If your company follows International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), we request that you estimate any adjustments that would be required to conform to U.S. GAAP.\n\nCompanies are instructed to include/consolidate data for their foreign subsidiaries on this survey. The reporting unit is your company, including all domestic and foreign subsidiaries in which your company owns more than 50 percent of the voting interest.\n\nEntities in which your company does not have more than 50% ownership stake should not be included in this report as part of ‘your company’. Transactions with entities in which your company does not have more than 50% ownership stake should be reported as if they were unrelated, third parties.\n\nWhy is this important? This information is needed in order to accurately measure the impact of globalization on R&D and innovation.\n\n1-11 List all applicable business codes in which your company operated worldwide in 2023?\n\nNOTE: These codes will be used to describe both business activities and R&D activities and may differ from industry codes used by other government surveys and reports. Typing in the description field will generate a list of possible matching business codes from which to choose. https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/brds/information/brdshelp/business-codes.html\n\nQuestion 1-11 asks the company receiving the survey to identify all of its worldwide businesses in 2023. Most companies only have one business (such as making engine parts or providing tax preparation services) and so would only report one code for Question 1-11. Larger companies, however, sometimes operate in more than one business. These companies should select the business codes from the list that best match how they define their various businesses.\n\nIf more than one of the company’s businesses falls under one of the listed business codes, the company should group those businesses together on the survey. For example, a company may have an office software business and a video game software business. For the purpose of this survey the company would group those two businesses together and report using the code for “Software publishers (except Internet)” (51120).\n\nIf more than one of the listed business codes applies to one of the company’s businesses, the company should estimate what percentage of its business falls under each applicable code. For example, a company may have a “healthcare” business that includes diagnostic devices and diagnostic substances. For this survey the company should report its healthcare business in two codes: 33451 (Electro-medical, electrotherapeutic, and irradiation apparatus manufacturing) and 32542 (In vitro diagnostic substances manufacturing). If this is not possible, the company may pick the one code that is the closest match or that accounts for the largest share of its business. In either case, company should note what action was taken in the space for \"Remarks\" at the end of the survey.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThis information is needed in order to tabulate more accurate and useful industry-level data.\n\n2-1 What was the worldwide R&D expense (both direct and indirect) for your company in 2023?\n\nQuestion 2-1 requests worldwide R&D expense. The reporting unit is your company, including all domestic and foreign subsidiaries that are more than 50% owned by your company for financial reporting purposes. All transactions between subdivisions within this reporting unit should be eliminated as inter-company transactions. Worldwide R&D expense also includes payments by your company for R&D services performed by (i) unrelated third parties, (ii) affiliates for which your company has less than a 50% ownership stake, and/or (iii) your foreign parent, if your company is foreign-owned.\n\nR&D includes both direct costs such as salaries of researchers as well as administrative and overhead costs clearly associated with the company’s R&D.\n\nScenario 1: Your company is publicly traded. Report worldwide R&D expense as reported on SEC Form 10-K as defined in FASB ASC Topic 730, Research and Development.\n\nScenario 2: Your company is foreign-owned. Report the R&D expense figure of the U.S.-located company and domestic and foreign subsidiaries that are more than 50% owned by your U.S.- located company, if any. Do not include expenses by your foreign parent or by any foreign affiliate your U.S.-located company does not own. For reporting purposes, these entities should be treated the same as any unrelated third party such as a customer or supplier you do not own.\n\nScenario 3: Your company is privately owned. You should follow the same procedures as public companies when reporting R&D expense and follow the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 730, Research and Development. Privately held companies that cannot report on this basis should note reporting principles and difficulties in the space for \"Remarks\" at the end of the survey.\n\nThe following are examples of activities that typically would be excluded from research and development in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 730, Research and Development:\n\na. Engineering follow-through in an early phase of commercial production.\n\nb. Quality control during commercial production including routine testing of products.\n\nc. Trouble-shooting in connection with break-downs during commercial production.\n\nd. Routine, on-going efforts to refine, enrich, or otherwise improve upon the qualities of an existing product.\n\ne. Adaptation of an existing capability to a particular requirement or customer's need as part of a continuing commercial activity.\n\nf. Seasonal or other periodic design changes to existing products.\n\ng. Routine design of tools, jigs, molds, and dies.\n\nh. Activity, including design and construction engineering, related to the construction, relocation, rearrangement, or start-up of facilities or equipment other than (1) pilot plants and (2) facilities or equipment whose sole use is for a particular research and development project.\n\ni. Legal work in connection with patent applications or litigation, and the sale or licensing of patents.\n\nExclude from worldwide R&D expense:\n\nCosts for R&D that were paid for by a third party such as R&D performed under contract.\n\nFor medical products companies, exclude costs for phase IV clinical trials since these trials take place after products have achieved technical and market feasibility.\n\nResearch and development activity in software:\n\nDoes R&D include development of software and Internet applications?\n\nYes, as long as the research and development activities include an element of uncertainty, are intended to close knowledge gaps, and meet scientific and technological needs.\n\nReport in this survey all software R&D as defined here regardless of the eventual user (internal or external).\n\nR&D activity in software INCLUDES:\n\nSoftware development or improvement activities that expand scientific or technological knowledge\n\nConstruction of new theories and algorithms in the field of computer science\n\nR&D activity in software EXCLUDES:\n\nSoftware development that does not depend on a scientific or technological advance, such as:\n\nSupporting or adapting existing systems\n\nAdding functionality to existing application programs, and\n\nRoutine debugging of existing systems and software\n\nCreation of new software based on known methods and applications\n\nConversion or translation of existing software and software languages\n\nAdaptation of a product to a specific client, unless knowledge that significantly improved the base program was added in that process\n\nFor further guidance on accounting for software development costs see FASB Statement No. 86 (Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased); and FASB Interpretation No. 6 (Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Computer Software).\n\n2-7 Of the amount reported in Question 2-4, what costs were incurred by your company in the following locations?\n\nThis question requires the company to report where R&D costs were incurred, even in the case of purchased R&D services where the R&D may be performed in a different location.\n\nThis survey defines the domestic United States as the 50 states and the District of Columbia only. Costs incurred in Puerto Rico, Guam, and other U.S. territories should be reported in the category for “All other countries”.\n\nReport R&D performed in domestic locations, including R&D that is paid for by foreign subsidiaries, in line a (Domestic U.S.).\n\nReport R&D performed in foreign locations, including R&D performed by foreign subsidiaries that is paid for by domestic operations, in line b (All other countries).\n\nScenario: Your company has R&D operations in Washington state and in your subsidiary in Canada. All of the R&D costs (such as salaries of R&D employees) from the Washington R&D operations should be reported in the line for “Domestic U.S.” even if a portion of this R&D is for the benefit of your Canadian subsidiary.\n\n2-8 How much of the (1) domestic, (2) foreign, and (3) worldwide R&D paid for by your company in 2023 was for each of the following types of costs?\n\nQuestion 2-8 asks the company to report its domestic, foreign, and worldwide R&D that it paid for in 2023 broken into the following categories:\n\na. Salaries, wages, and fringe benefits\n\nInclude costs for all compensation and benefits of R&D employees and officers that are included in the R&D paid for by the company.\n\nStock-based compensation should be reported in line b.\n\nInclude payroll taxes such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\nb. Stock-based compensation\n\nInclude the cost of both stock options and stock grants.\n\nc. Leased employees or temporary staffing, including on-site consultants, working on R&D\n\nInclude costs paid to Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs), staffing agencies, and on-site consultants for personnel contributing to R&D.\n\nd. Expensed equipment (not capitalized)\n\nInclude all equipment purchases for R&D that are beneath the company’s capitalization threshold.\n\ne. Materials and supplies\n\nCosts for materials and supplies consumed for R&D\n\nf. Leased facilities and equipment\n\nCosts for leased facilities and equipment used in the company’s R&D\n\ng. Depreciation and amortization on property, plant, equipment and intangible assets\n\nInclude depreciation on tangible R&D assets such as buildings or equipment as well as the amortization of intangible assets such as patents used only for the company’s R&D activities.\n\nInclude depreciation on shared property, plant, equipment, that can be allocated to R&D.\n\nh. Royalties and licensing fees (including payments made to others for the use of patents and other forms of intellectual property used in your company’s R&D)\n\nInclude payments made to others for patents and other intellectual property used in your company’s R&D activities.\n\ni. Collaborative R&D payments (include joint development agreements)\n\nInclude payments made to business partners for collaborative R&D, including milestone payments and payments made under cost-sharing agreements for joint R&D projects.\n\nPayments made to contract research organizations or other parties performing R&D under contract for the company should be reported in line j, “Contract R&D”.\n\nj. Contract R&D (include payments to your company’s foreign parent for R&D)\n\nInclude payments made to contract research organizations or other parties performing R&D under contract for the company.\n\nk. Other purchased services\n\nInclude payments for purchased services that support the company’s R&D, but are not themselves R&D.\n\nExamples of costs to report in this category include hazardous waste disposal services at the company’s R&D lab, payments to patients participating in clinical trials, and purchased computing time to run simulations for the company’s R&D.\n\nl. All other costs (including administrative and overhead costs clearly associated with your company’s R&D)\n\nInclude all other costs supporting the R&D the company paid for.\n\nExamples of costs to report in this category include: travel and training, journal subscriptions, information and telecommunications, utilities, and other administrative and overhead costs associated with R&D.\n\nIndirect costs that are allocated to R&D should be reported in the \"All other costs\" line only if no other category is applicable.\n\no Example. A company maintains an on-site fitness center for all employees. A portion of the costs for this fitness center is allocated to R&D expense. These allocated costs should be reported in line a (salaries, wages, and fringe benefits).\n\no Example. A company's R&D department shares a building with the customer support department. A portion of the depreciation on this building is allocated to R&D expense. These allocated costs should be reported in line g (depreciation and amortization).\n\no Example. A company leases a building that is occupied by its R&D department and the IT department. A portion of the lease on this building is allocated to R&D expense. These allocated costs should be reported in line f (leased facilities and equipment).\n\nThe domestic total should equal Question 2-7, line a, foreign total should equal Question 2-7, line b and worldwide should equal Question 2-4.\n\nComplete if amount reported in Question 2-4 is less than $1 Million\n\n1. Of the total R&D paid for by your company reported in Question 2-4, what costs were incurred by your company in the following locations?\n\nThis question requires the company to report where R&D costs were incurred, even in the case of purchased R&D services where the R&D may be performed in a different location.\n\nInclude all other costs supporting the R&D the company paid for.\n\nExamples of costs to report in this category include: materials and supplies, expensed equipment, depreciation, rent, travel and training, journal subscriptions, royalties or licenses paid for patents or software used in the company’s R&D, office, information and telecommunications, utilities, and other administrative and overhead costs associated with R&D.\n\nThis survey defines the domestic United States as the 50 states and the District of Columbia only. Costs incurred in Puerto Rico, Guam, and other U.S. territories should be reported in the category for “All other countries”.\n\nReport R&D performed in domestic locations, including R&D that is paid for by foreign subsidiaries, in line a (Domestic U.S.).\n\nReport R&D performed in foreign locations, including R&D performed by foreign subsidiaries that is paid for by domestic operations, in line b (All other countries).\n\nScenario: Your company has R&D operations in Washington state and in your subsidiary in Canada. All of the R&D costs (such as salaries of R&D employees) from the Washington R&D operations should be reported in the line for “Domestic U.S.” even if a portion of this R&D is for the benefit of your Canadian subsidiary.\n\n2. How much of the amount reported in Question 1, line a, was for each of the following types of costs?\n\nThis question asks the company to report its domestic, foreign, and worldwide R&D that it paid for in 2023 broken into the following categories:\n\na. Salaries, wages, and fringe benefits\n\nInclude costs for all compensation and benefits of R&D employees and officers that are included in the R&D paid for by the company.\n\nInclude payroll taxes such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\nb. Depreciation and amortization on property, plant, equipment and intangible assets.\n\nInclude depreciation on tangible R&D assets such as buildings or equipment as well as the amortization of intangible assets such as patents used only for the company’s R&D activities.\n\nc. Collaborative R&D payments (include joint development agreement)\n\nInclude payments made to business partners for collaborative R&D, including milestone payments and payments made under cost-sharing agreements for joint R&D projects.\n\nPayments made to contract research organizations or other parties performing R&D under contract for the company should be reported in line d, “Contract R&D”.\n\nd. Contract R&D (include payments to your company’s foreign parent for R&D)\n\nInclude payments made to contract research organizations or other parties performing R&D under contract for the company.\n\ne. All other costs (including administrative and overhead costs clearly associated with your company’s R&D)\n\nInclude all other costs supporting the R&D the company paid for.\n\n3. Add Question 2, lines a, b and e, and enter the result here. This is the domestic R&D paid for and performed by your company in 2023.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThe costs reported in lines c and d of Question 2 represent payments to third parties (outsourcing) for R&D. Because the reporting company is not directly involved in the conduct of this R&D, it may not be able to provide the same amount of information on these costs as it could for the R&D it performs itself. This question allows the survey to address this limitation as well as address an interest in the differences between R&D companies perform themselves versus R&D that is performed by collaborators and contractors.\n\n4. Of the domestic R&D paid for and performed by your company reported in Question 3, how much was for the following categories?\n\nResearch is defined as experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge or understanding of phenomena and observable facts. Research may be either “basic”, where the goal is primarily to acquire new knowledge or understanding of a given topic without a specific commercial application in mind, or “applied”, where the goal is to solve a specific problem or meet a specific commercial objective.\n\nDevelopment is defined as the systematic use of research and practical experience to produce new or improved goods, services, or processes. In simple terms, the intended output of research is ideas and the intended output of development is products.\n\nFor example, a project that aims to investigate the influence of different materials on fuel cell efficiency would be classified as basic research. A project that aims to improve fuel cell efficiency using new materials would be classified as applied research.\n\nSection 3: Costs paid for by others\n\n3-1 What were your company’s worldwide costs (both direct and indirect) in 2023 for the following that were funded, paid for, or reimbursed by others not owned by your company?\n\nCosts should be considered “funded, paid for, or reimbursed by others” if the company has been or expects to be paid for the costs by a customer, business partner, or grant-making organization. R&D includes both direct costs such as salaries of researchers as well as administrative and overhead costs clearly associated with the company’s R&D. Include in this question R&D costs reported as costs of goods or services sold in your company’s financial statements.\n\nNote: Foreign-owned companies should report costs that are funded, paid for, or reimbursed by their foreign parent in this question.\n\nExclude payments in excess of the actual cost of the work performed (such as profits or fees). Also exclude costs that were reported in Question 2-4, as they should not be double counted in this question.\n\nIf your company administers a federally- funded research and development center (FFRDC) for an agency of the federal government, all FFRDC R&D costs should be excluded for reporting to this survey. For a complete list of FFRDCs, see //www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/.\n\nThe categories in this question, listed below, define the survey term, “R&D paid for by others”:\n\na. R&D reimbursed by your company’s foreign parent (if you are owned by a foreign parent)\n\nb. Collaborative R&D reimbursed by business partners, such as through cost- sharing agreements\n\nThese agreements are very common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, but less so in other industries.\n\nc. R&D paid for by grants (government or private foundations)\n\nExamples include Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) grants, Department of Energy demonstration grants, and Gates Foundation research grants.\n\nd. Defense R&D goods or services provided as a prime or as a sub, to the government and/or government contractors\n\nInclude defense R&D performed as a prime contractor and/or as a subcontractor.\n\nThis category most often applies to defense contractors and subcontractors performing tasks such as designing, building, and testing prototypes of new military weapon systems and developing custom software for defense applications.\n\nInclude all defense R&D funded by the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Energy’s weapons programs, the Department of Homeland Security, and other Federal agencies.\n\nR&D funds from DOD include costs for research, development, test, and evaluation activities that are funded through DOD’s 6-1 through 6-6 budget appropriations.\n\nExclude costs for activities that funded through DOD’s 6-7 budget appropriations, Operational Systems Development.\n\nExclude costs for non-experimental work on projects that have achieved technical feasibility, such as low-rate initial production.\n\ne. Medical clinical trial Phase I-III services provided to others not owned by your company (include pass-through costs)\n\nThis category involves the testing of potential medical products in human subjects.\n\nPhase I – III clinical trials must be successfully completed in order for a product to be approved for use in the general population.\n\nInclude pass-through/out-of-pocket costs paid to investigators and patients participating in clinical trials.\n\nExclude costs for Phase IV clinical trials because these trials take place after a product has been approved for sale.\n\nOffices of physicians, dentists, and other health practitioners with employees acting as investigators for clinical trials generally should report 0 (zero) to this item. These companies should only report compensation for sponsored studies if the investigators’ role in the study extends beyond monitoring his/her own patients to the development and management of overall study protocols.\n\nf. Medical R&D services, other than clinical trials, provided to others not owned by your company\n\nNonclinical (also known as preclinical) research and development involves research on potential medical products that does not involve human subjects. This R&D consists of both in vitro studies as well as studies using animal subjects.\n\ng. Nondefense custom software development and/or computer systems designed for others not owned by your company\n\nSee definitions in “Research and development activity in software” under guidance for Question 2-1.\n\nThis category includes the development of new or significantly improved software, both as an end product and for use embedded in other products.\n\nExclude: Software development that does not depend on a scientific or technological advance, such as adding functionality to existing application programs, debugging systems, and adapting existing software.\n\nSoftware development for defense-related applications should be reported in line d.\n\nh. Prototype development, production, and testing for customer’s products prior to their introduction to the market (excluding defense-related prototyping reported in line d)\n\nExclude quality control testing and other testing services for products already on the market. All other R&D services provided to the Federal Government or to others not owned by your company.\n\ni. All other R&D services provided to the Federal Government or to others not owned by your company.\n\n3-3 How much of the (1) domestic, (2) foreign, and (3) total worldwide R&D paid for by others in 2023 was for each of the following types of costs?\n\nQuestion 3-3 asks the company to report its domestic, foreign, and worldwide R&D paid for by others in 2023 in the following categories:\n\na. Salaries, wages, and fringe benefits\n\nInclude costs for all compensation and benefits of R&D employees and officers that are included in the R&D paid for by the company.\n\nStock-based compensation should be reported in line b.\n\nInclude payroll taxes such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\nb. Stock-based compensation\n\nInclude the cost of both stock options and stock grants.\n\nc. Leased employees and temporary staffing, including on-site consultants, working on R&D\n\nInclude costs paid to Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs), staffing agencies, and on-site consultants for personnel contributing to R&D.\n\nd. Expensed equipment (not capitalized)\n\nInclude all equipment purchases for R&D that are beneath the company’s capitalization threshold.\n\ne. Materials and supplies\n\nCosts for materials and supplies consumed for R&D\n\nf. Leased facilities and equipment\n\nCosts for leased facilities and equipment used in the company’s R&D\n\ng. Depreciation and amortization on property, plant, equipment and intangible assets\n\nInclude depreciation on tangible R&D assets such as buildings or equipment as well as the amortization of intangible assets such as patents and capitalized in process R&D used only for the company’s R&D activities.\n\nInclude depreciation on shared property, plant, and equipment that can be allocated to R&D.\n\nh. Royalties and licensing fees (including payments made to others for the use of patents and other forms of intellectual property used in your company’s R&D)\n\nInclude payments made to others for patents and other intellectual property used in your company’s R&D activities.\n\ni. Collaborative R&D payments (include joint development agreements)\n\nInclude payments made to business partners for collaborative R&D, including milestone payments and payments made under cost-sharing agreements for joint R&D projects.\n\nPayments made to contract research organizations or other parties performing R&D under contract for the company should be reported in line j, “Contract R&D”.\n\nj. Contract R&D (include payments to your company’s foreign parent for R&D)\n\nk. Other purchased services\n\nInclude payments for purchased services that support the company’s R&D, but are not themselves R&D.\n\nExamples of costs to report in this category include hazardous waste disposal services at the company’s R&D lab, payments to patients participating in clinical trials, and purchased computing time to run simulations for the company’s R&D.\n\nIf your company is a contract research organization managing clinical trials, include compensation of medical professionals, investigators, and human subjects participating in clinical trials or reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs in this category.\n\nl. All other costs (including administrative and overhead costs clearly associated with your company’s R&D)\n\nInclude all other costs supporting the R&D the company paid for.\n\nExamples of costs to report in this category include: travel and training, journal subscriptions, information and telecommunications, utilities, and other administrative and overhead costs associated with R&D.\n\nIndirect costs that are allocated to R&D should be reported in the \"All other costs\" line only if no other category is applicable.\n\no Example. A company maintains an on-site fitness center for all employees. A portion of the costs for this fitness center is allocated to R&D expense. These allocated costs should be reported in line a (salaries, wages, and fringe benefits).\n\no Example. A company's R&D department shares a building with the customer support department. A portion of the depreciation on this building is allocated to R&D expense. These allocated costs should be reported in line g (depreciation and amortization).\n\no Example. A company leases a building that is occupied by its R&D department and the IT department. A portion of the lease on this building is allocated to R&D expense. These allocated costs should be reported in line f (leased facilities and equipment).\n\nSection 3 Worksheet\n\nComplete if amount reported in Question 3-1, line j is less than $1 Million\n\n1. Of the total R&D paid for by others reported in Question 3-1, line j, what costs were incurred by your company in the following locations?\n\nThis question requires the company to report where R&D costs were incurred, even in the case of purchased R&D services where the R&D may be performed in a different location.\n\nThis survey defines the domestic United States as the 50 states and the District of Columbia only. Costs incurred in Puerto Rico, Guam, and other U.S. territories should be reported in the category for “All other countries”.\n\nReport R&D performed in domestic locations, including R&D that is paid for by foreign subsidiaries, in line a (Domestic U.S.).\n\nReport R&D performed in foreign locations, including R&D performed by foreign subsidiaries that is paid for by domestic operations, in line b (All other countries).\n\nScenario: Your company has R&D operations in Washington state and in your subsidiary in Canada. All of the R&D costs (such as salaries of R&D employees) from the Washington R&D operations should be reported in the line for “Domestic U.S.”\n\n2. How much of the amount reported in Question 1, line a, was for each of the following types of costs?\n\nThis question asks the company to report its domestic, foreign, and worldwide R&D that it paid for in 2023 broken into the following categories:\n\na. Salaries, wages, and fringe benefits\n\nInclude costs for all compensation and benefits of R&D employees and officers that are included in the R&D paid for by the company.\n\nInclude payroll taxes such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\nb. Depreciation and amortization on property, plant, equipment, and intangible assets.\n\nInclude depreciation on tangible R&D assets such as buildings or equipment as well as the amortization of intangible assets such as patents used only for the company's R&D activities.\n\nc. Collaborative R&D payments (include joint development agreement)\n\nInclude payments made to business partners for collaborative R&D, including milestone payments and payments made under cost-sharing agreements for joint R&D projects.\n\nPayments made to contract research organizations or other parties performing R&D under contract for the company should reported in line d, \"Contract R&D\".\n\nd. Contract R&D (include payments to your company's foreign parent for R&D)\n\nInclude payments made to contract research organizations or other parties performing R&D under contract for the company.\n\ne. All other costs (including administrative and overhead costs clearly associated with your company's R&D)\n\nInclude all other costs supporting the R&D the company paid for.\n\n3. Add Question 2, lines a, b and e, and enter the result here. This is the domestic R&D performed by your company.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThe costs reported in lines c and d of Question 2 represent payments to third parties (outsourcing) for R&D. Because the reporting company is not directly involved in the conduct of this R&D, it may not be able to provide the same amount of information on these costs as it could for the R&D it performs itself. This question allows the survey to address this limitation as well as address an interest in the differences between R&D companies perform themselves versus R&D that is performed by collaborators and contractors.\n\n4. How much of the amount reported in Question 3, was paid for by each of the following?\n\nQuestion 3 asks the company to report how much of the domestic R&D performed by your company in 2023 that was paid for by others was paid for by eight specific types of organizations:\n\nExample: Company Sub Inc. performs custom software development for a large defense company as a subcontractor on a contract with the U.S. Dept. of Defense. Even though Sub Inc. is working directly for the defense company, it reports the cost of this development in line d, because the Dept. of Defense was the original source of funds.\n\na. Other companies located inside the United States (Include for-profit hospitals)\n\nb. Your company’s foreign parent (if you are owned by a foreign parent)\n\nc. Other companies located outside the United States\n\nd. U.S. federal government agencies or laboratories\n\ne. U.S. state government agencies or laboratories\n\nf. Foreign government agencies or laboratories\n\ng. Universities, colleges, and academic researchers (including principal investigators) located inside the United States\n\nh. Universities and colleges located outside the United States\n\ni. All other organizations inside the United States\n\nj. All other organizations outside the United States\n\n5. Of the domestic R&D performed by your company that was paid for by others reported in Question 3, how much was for the following categories?\n\nResearch is defined as experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge or understanding of phenomena and observable facts. Research may be either “basic”, where the goal is primarily to acquire new knowledge or understanding of a given topic without a specific commercial application in mind, or “applied”, where the goal is to solve a specific problem or meet a specific commercial objective.\n\nDevelopment is defined as the systematic use of research and practical experience to produce new or improved goods, services, or processes. In simple terms, the intended output of research is ideas and the intended output of development is products.\n\nFor example, a project that aims to investigate the influence of different materials on fuel cell efficiency would be classified as basic research. A project that aims to improve fuel cell efficiency using new materials would be classified as applied research.\n\n5-9 What percentage of the amount reported in Question 5-2 had agricultural applications?\n\nThe intent of this question is to measure the amount of R&D companies are investing in agricultural-related applications.\n\nThis includes R&D into new and significantly improved fertilizers, pesticides, farm equipment, and crop management techniques.\n\nOnly include costs for R&D projects where agriculture was an intended area of application from its inception. Do not include costs for R&D projects where agriculture was not an intended area of application until after the project was completed.\n\nInclude the total cost of an R&D project with agricultural applications in the calculation for this question even if the project has other applications. This means that the percentages reported in Questions 5-5 to 5-9 could sum to more than 100%.\n\nTechnology focus of domestic R&D paid for and performed by your company\n\nNOTE: You may report the same R&D in multiple areas for Question 5-10 to 5-13.\n\n5-12 What percentage of the amount reported in Question 5-2 was for nanotechnology?\n\nNanotechnology is defined as the understandin g of processes and phenomena and the application of science and technology to organisms, organic and inorganic materials, as well as parts, products and models thereof, at the nanometer-scale (but not exclusively below 100 nanometers) in one or more dimensions, where the onset of size-dependent phenomena usually enables novel applications. These applications utilize the properties of nanoscale materials that differ from the properties of individual atoms, molecules, and bulk matter for the production of knowledge, goods and services, like improved materials, devices, and systems that exploit these new properties.\n\nMany technologies related to conventional solid-state semiconductor manufacturing are capable of creating features smaller than 100 nanometers, so R&D involving these technologies should be included in this question.\n\nThe following list provides examples of nanotechnology techniques and applications. The list is not intended to be exhaustive, but it is indicative of the types of activities included in the definition of nanotechnology.\n\nNanomaterial: material with any external dimension in the nanoscale or having internal structure or surface structure in the nanoscale\n\nNanoelectronics: field of science and technology concerned with the development and production of functional electronic devices with nanoscale components.\n\nNanophotonics: branch of photonics concerned with interaction of photons with nanomaterials aiming to design optical or optoelectronic components.\n\nNanomedicine: medical application of nanotechnology (e.g., medical applications of nanomaterials and biological devices, to nanoelectronic biosensors, and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology such as biological machines).\n\nNanomagnetics: the study of the magnetic response of nanomaterials to an applied magnetic field, and their applications.\n\nNanomechanics: a branch of nanoscience studying fundamental mechanical (elastic, thermal and kinetic) properties of physical systems at the nanometer scale.\n\nNanofiltration: a membrane filtration process used for the softening of water and the removal of organic matter; includes nano-membranes.\n\nNanotools: multi-component tools and devices used for manipulation, nanolithography and nanofabrication.\n\nNanoinstruments or –devices: multi-component instruments or devices used for observation, analysis or control of matter at the nanometer scale.\n\nNanomanufacturing: intentional synthesis, generation or control of nanomaterials, or fabrication steps in the nanoscale, for commercial purposes.\n\nNanobiotechnology: application of nanoscience or nanotechnology to biology or biotechnology. This includes the application of nanotechnology to human health and veterinary science.\n\nBionanotechnology: application of biology to nanotechnology, (i.e., the use of biological molecules in nanomaterials, nanoscale devices or nanoscale systems).\n\nCatalysis: the study and application of catalytic process that are based on nanotechnology-enabled components.\n\nSoftware for modelling and simulation: the development and application of software for the modelling and simulation of nanoscale phenomena (i.e., phenomena occurring at a length scale between 1 nm and 100 nm).\n\nInclude the total cost of an R&D project with nanotechnology applications in the calculation for this question, even if the project has other applications. This means that the percentages reported in Questions 5-10 to 5-13 could sum to more than 100%.\n\n5-26 What percentage of the amount reported in Question 5-16 was for nanotechnology?\n\nNanotechnology is defined as the understanding of processes and phenomena and the application of science and technology to organisms, organic and inorganic materials, as well as parts, products and models thereof, at the nanometer-scale (but not exclusively below 100 nanometers) in one or more dimensions, where the onset of size-dependent phenomena usually enables novel applications.

This means that the percentages reported in Questions 5-24 to 5-27 could sum to more than 100%.\n\n6-5 How many of the R&D employees reported in Question 6-1, line a, worked in the occupations listed below?\n\nThe distinction between the different occupation categories is defined primarily by the nature of the employee’s work, not the employee’s level of education. Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems and also in the management of the projects concerned. Include R&D managers in the “Researchers” category.\n\nR&D technicians and equivalent staff are persons whose main tasks require technical knowledge and experience in one or more fields of science or engineering, but who contribute to R&D by performing technical tasks under the supervision of researchers. Biostatisticians supporting clinical trials should be reported in this category even though they may hold PhDs in their field.\n\nThe main distinction between researchers and technicians is that researchers contribute more to the creative aspects of R&D whereas technicians provide technical support. For example, a researcher (scientist or engineer) would design an experiment and a technician would run the experiment and assist in analyzing results.\n\nR&D support staff is not directly involved with the conduct of a research project, but support the researchers and technicians. These employees might include clerical staff, report writers, regulatory experts, quality assurance, safety trainers, and other related employees.\n\nMany Contract Research Organizations provide largely technical, regulatory, and administrative support to their customers for clinical trials. Most of these companies’ R&D employees should be reported as R&D technicians or R&D support staff.\n\n6-10 In addition to the R&D employees reported in Question 6-1, line a, how many leased employees and temporary staff, including on-site consultants, worked in the occupations listed below?\n\nThe distinction between the different occupation categories is defined primarily by the nature of the employee’s work, not the employee’s level of education.
