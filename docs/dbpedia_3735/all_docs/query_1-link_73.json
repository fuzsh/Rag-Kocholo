Edelman leveraged the launch of KFC’s Youth Foundation to get the word out about the company’s charity efforts, but without the stuffy corporate feel. With the founding of the new youth organization, they launched new limited-edition KFC merchandise ranging from enamel pins to chicken-scented surf wax.

Levi has a 20-year naming-rights agreement – Levi’s ® Stadium – with the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers. The relationship has earned the stadium the nickname, “Field of Jeans” after the classic film “Field of Dreams.”\n\nIn November 2018, the company covered the park’s playing surface with 20,000 pairs of jeans donated by the community and 49ers fans over two weeks to the nonprofit Goodwill. It blanketed almost the entire field – leaving only a swath of turf, forming the universal recycling symbol.

They used ‘deep fake’ style technology on Rachel Riley, a much loved UK television celebrity known for her talent in math. A shocking video appeared on Rachel’s social channels where Rachel confessed to being “bad at maths” and having answers fed to her via an earpiece.\n\nA day later, after national outrage, HSBC UK reassured the public that this had been a ‘deep fake’ style video, with Rachel’s mouth movements adapted and her voice dubbed over by an impersonator. Rachel was in on the stunt.

As you can tell, they’ve positioned themselves to service all kinds of brands. But what makes MSL a force to be reckoned with is its core set of practices.\n\nThey offer consumer marketing, crisis and issue management, employee engagement/communications, social purpose and sustainability, financial communications, public affairs, and reputation management and corporate communication. One of MSL’s most notable campaigns was created for Vicks. It was developed to highlight the plight of 29 million orphans in India.\n\nThe ad shares the true story of a girl born with a rare and incurable skin disease called Ichthyosis. The girl narrates her perspective on life and shares that if it wasn’t for the love of her parents who adopted her as an infant, she might never have had the chance to feel loved or live a life filled with hope and dreams. The video ad went viral in 24 hours, generating a total of 323+ media exposures and $700,000 in earned PR. It also pulled 749 million impressions and over 19 million engagements.

Their influence on the world of marketing and advertising is unprecedented. And while Ogilvy has been around since 1948, they are still as relevant as ever.\n\nTake the IKEA “Müpolash” ad. It’s a play on how popular IKEA products are and how much people love sharing their IKEA goods on Instagram. The “Müpolash” is a combination of the four most Instagrammed products from their range; mugs, pots, lamps and shelves. Ogilvy created an ad to poke fun at the nature of social media but also leveraged it. To stand a chance to win one of five limited edition Müpolash units, IKEA Instagram followers had to use the Müpolash AR filter and place their home.\n\nAnd that’s just one example, they also took over media with their “The Restaurant With No Food” campaign for Hellman’s. Food waste is a serious problem, one driven by a lack of inspiration to use ingredients. Ogilvy invited people to bring their unused ingredients to a local restaurant for chefs to transform into 5-star meals. The result? A complete takeover of social media, an endorsement from the UN and even educational talks on food waste held in restaurants.\n\nNotable Clients: Ogilvy has worked with top clients including Coca-Cola, Samsung, Pizza Hut, IKEA, Turkish Airlines, Rolls Royse, Jameson, Milka, Dove, IBM, Milo, Verizon, Hellman’s, Burger King, Corona, Volkswagen, and Zippo.\n\n21.

And in that time, they’ve helped countless brands communicate their very best messages.\n\nPorterNovelli has also produced striking work. To draw attention to the growing threat of child sex trafficking in Atlanta, Georgia, a city the FBI ranks as one of the top cities for child sex trafficking, the firm commissioned 72 school buses with branding to drive through Georgia. Statistics show that as many as 3,600 children are trafficked from Georgia. The campaign was perfectly timed to drive awareness before the Superbowl, a period officials believe increases the probability of children being trafficked.\n\nThe campaign lasted a month and drew attention from major outlets such as Fox, The New York Times, Adweek, USA Today, and over 500 more. It also generated 43 million social media impressions in 48 hours.\n\nPorterNovelli practices in five areas. These are purpose, reputation, health, food and innovation.\n\nNotable Clients: The agency’s top clients include the National Honey Board, ALS Association, Timberland, California Almonds, MacDonald’s, Sony, Roche, Novartis, and more.

As one of Canada’s largest PR firms, they have a broad range of expertise. They provide everything from advocacy and influencer marketing to social acceptability and community relations, sponsorship and sports marketing.\n\nWhen it comes to their work, National has a knack for tackling tough PR challenges. Take vaccine hesitancy. It’s a contentious subject. When Pfizer wanted to remind Canadian parents about the importance of completing a full schedule of recommended infant vaccinations, they turned to National for help. The result was a well-thought-out campaign that lasted over a year.\n\nIt centred around the popular children stories that emphasized the number three (The Three Bears, Three Blind Mice, and The Three Little Pigs) and an important call to action for parents to “Don’t Overlook What’s Missing” as a reminder to complete the vaccination schedules. National helped Pfizer triple app page visits in the first year of the campaign and boost app downloads by 55%.\n\nNotable Clients: The agency’s portfolio consists of leading Canadian brands and organizations including Breakfast Club of Canada, Benny&Co., Scale AI, Les Petits Frères, Cook it, Montreal Holocaust Museum, La Maison Simons, Roche Canada, Pfizer Canada, Halifax Partnership, and CARE Canada.\n\n24.

Similarly, NinjaPromo specializes in fintech, B2B, and crypto industries, making them a perfect fit for companies in those markets.\n\nChoosing an agency with relevant industry expertise ensures they understand the nuances and trends specific to your field, translating to more effective media pitches and overall strategy alignment with your business goals.\n\nMedia Connections and Network\n\nA PR agency’s media connections are vital for securing high-quality coverage. Agencies with strong relationships with journalists, editors, and influencers can more easily get your story published in top-tier publications.\n\nFor example, Channel V Media's extensive media network has helped clients like Meatless Farms secure over 135 press features across top-tier publications, making them a household name in the United States.\n\nComparing agencies' portfolios to see where their clients have been featured can provide insight into their media leverage. Agencies like BPM-PR Firm, known for getting clients featured in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, exemplify the power of robust media connections.\n\nService Offerings and Capabilities\n\nIt’s essential to understand the full range of services a PR agency offers. Beyond basic media relations, look for agencies that provide comprehensive services such as social media management, content creation, event planning, and crisis management.\n\nFor instance, Communications Strategy Group (CSG) offers a wide array of services, including public relations, content marketing, corporate communications, and even influencer marketing and relationships, ensuring a cohesive and integrated approach. Compare this to a more specialized agency like NinjaPromo, which, while providing excellent PR services, focuses primarily on fintech and crypto industries.\n\nAn agency with a broad skill set can deliver more cohesive and integrated campaigns, handling all aspects of your PR needs from strategic planning to execution and measurement.\n\nCost and Value\n\nWhile cost should not be the sole deciding factor, it’s essential to consider your budget and the value the agency offers. Compare the pricing structures of different agencies and assess what you’re getting for your investment.\n\nFor example, Cloutboost's minimum campaign size is $10,000+, while NinjaPromo offers services starting at $50,000+. Some agencies might charge higher fees but provide extensive services and better results, making them a worthwhile investment. It’s important to balance cost with the quality of service and the potential return on investment.\n\nAn agency like NinjaPromo, with a broad global presence and extensive service offerings, might offer a higher value for their higher fees compared to smaller, specialized agencies.\n\nBy considering these four factors, you can select a PR agency that aligns with your business goals and helps build a strong, positive reputation for your brand.\n\nRecent Case Studies: The Tangible Benefits of Partnering with Top PR Agencies\n\nThere's one more factor to consider when choosing a PR agency.
