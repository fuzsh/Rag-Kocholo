        "text": "Tobacco giant Altria has managed to do what rival RJ Reynolds has not: convince the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that authorizing the marketing of menthol-flavored e-cigarettes would protect the public’s health.\n\nIn January, March, and October of 2023, the agency denied RJ Reynolds Vapor Company’s marketing authorization applications for a total of 7 menthol-flavored and 3 fruit-flavored Vuse e-cigarette products. Yet this June, the FDA authorized 4 menthol-flavored e-cigarettes from Altria’s company NJOY, the first e-cigarettes that don’t taste like tobacco to earn that designation.\n\nAlthough it seems counterintuitive when applied to tobacco products such as e-cigarettes, also known as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and vapes, the FDA said NJOY had shown that the public health benefit of menthol-flavored e-cigarettes outweighed their potential harm.\n\nThe benefit? Possibly helping people smoke fewer combustible cigarettes. The harm? Children and adolescents, few of whom smoke combustible cigarettes, find flavored tobacco products more appealing and might be tempted to begin puffing e-cigarettes if menthol products were available.\n\nThe decision “is further reinforcement that authorization of an e-cigarette product is possible when sufficient scientific evidence has been submitted to the agency to justify it,” Brian King, PhD, MPH, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, said in the agency’s announcement.\n\nScientists acknowledge that e-cigarettes don’t release as many toxic compounds as combustible cigarettes and might help some people cut back on or even quit smoking the latter. But researchers also note that e-cigarettes, introduced in the US in 2007, aren’t risk free, starting with the fact that most contain highly addictive nicotine, and they haven’t been available long enough for their long-term effects to be studied.\n\nEven if e-cigarettes help some smokers transition from combustible cigarettes, research findings are mixed about whether sweet- or minty-flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol products, are associated with higher quit rates than tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes. What is clear, though, as the FDA notes in its decision summaries for the NJOY menthol products, is that “there is a known and substantial risk of youth initiation and use” with sweet or minty e-cigarettes compared with those that taste like tobacco.\n\n“Given everything we know about how appealing flavored tobacco products are to children, the American Academy of Pediatrics is profoundly disappointed that the Food and Drug Administration has chosen to authorize several menthol-flavored e-cigarettes,” organization President Benjamin Hoffman, MD, said in a statement. “This decision will have serious health consequences for children and young people.”\n\nMeanwhile, despite the FDA’s marketing authorization denial of Vuse menthol e-cigarette products, they remain on the market. RJ Reynolds Vapor sued the agency over its decision, and the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed with the company and issued a permanent stay of enforcement in February.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act into law in June 2009, it authorized the FDA to regulate only cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and tobacco used by smokers to roll their own cigarettes—not e-cigarettes.\n\nHowever, the act empowered the agency to implement regulations to expand its authority over other products that met the statutory definition of tobacco product. According to the latest definition, “’tobacco product’ means any product made or derived from tobacco, or containing nicotine from any source, that is intended for human consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product.”\n\nIn 2016, the FDA issued a final rule that extended the agency’s authority over e-cigarettes and all other tobacco products that hadn’t been covered by the Tobacco Control Act. When that happened, it immediately became illegal to sell e-cigarettes to anyone younger than 18 years old.\n\nIn 2020, the FDA, which reviews tobacco products on a case-by-case basis, issued a policy prioritizing enforcement against unauthorized flavored e-cigarette products that appeal to children and teens, including fruit and mint. The policy required that companies cease the manufacture, distribution, and sale of unauthorized flavored e-cigarettes within 30 days or risk FDA enforcement actions.\n\nEven so, many unauthorized e-cigarettes with flavors like key lime pie and banana custard are still easy to find online and in stores. “They just haven’t gotten their act together to pull them off the market,” said Eric Lindblom, JD, who directed the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products’ Office of Policy from 2011 through 2016. He said he left the FDA because “I knew we weren’t going to get anything done.”\n\nTobacco- and menthol-flavored products were excluded under the 2020 policy, as were flavored ENDS products other than those that were cartridge-based. In other words, disposable e-cigarettes and those that used tanks instead of cartridges were not an enforcement priority.\n\n“A very, very strong argument could be made that no disposable e-cigarettes should be on the market at all,” noted Lindblom, senior scholar at the Georgetown University Law Center’s O’Neill Institute for National & Global Health Law. “Disposables are cheaper than the other kinds of e-cigarettes…so they have the greatest risk of youth use.”\n\nThe FDA emphasized in a news release about the 2020 policy that it was not banning flavored or cartridge-based e-cigarettes. Manufacturers could seek marketing authorization by submitting an application to the agency and demonstrating that their products were appropriate for the protection of the public’s health, a pathway Congress established in the Tobacco Control Act.\n\nSome e-cigarette manufacturers avoided FDA regulation by using synthetic nicotine, but Congress in 2022 closed that loophole by passing legislation clarifying the FDA’s authority to regulate tobacco products containing nicotine from any source.\n\nAs of this July, the FDA had authorized 34 e-cigarette products and devices, marketed by NJOY, RJ Reynolds Vapor, and Logic Technology Development.\n\nE-cigarettes were the most-used tobacco products among middle and high school students in 2023—as had been the case since 2014—and 9 out of 10 current users in that population vaped flavored products, according to the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey.\n\nAnd a survey of Connecticut high school students in the fall of 2022, the results of which were published this May, found that the use of e-cigarettes with menthol and other cooling flavors was associated with higher e-cigarette dependence.\n\n“Until NJOY, it seemed that they were completely giving preference to reducing risk in youth and younger adults,” Rafael Meza, PhD, distinguished senior scientist in integrative oncology at the British Columbia Cancer Research Institute, said of the FDA.\n\nAlthough the proportion of middle school students reporting current e-cigarette use did not significantly change from 2022 (3.3%) to 2023 (4.6%), it fell among high school students from 14.1% in 2022 to 10% in 2023, the survey found, crediting such factors as ”ongoing efforts at the national, state, and local levels to implement tobacco control strategies,” including the FDA’s regulatory actions.\n\nBut Meza thinks there’s more to it than that. The pandemic might have been a factor, he speculated, given that most students attended school virtually, so they had closer parental supervision and reduced contact with older adolescents who could obtain e-cigarettes for them. But the rates of e-cigarette use continued to fall even after students returned to school, he noted.\n\nE-cigarette or vaping product use–associated lung injury (EVALI) may have also played a role in the decline in e-cigarette use among young people, Meza said. Emergency department visits for EVALI, characterized by shortness of breath and chest pain, have declined since they peaked in 2019, according to the CDC. EVALI’s cause remains unclear, but the most recognized agent associated with it is vitamin E acetate, which was used illegally in multiple cheap counterfeit e-cigarettes containing tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC.\n\n“It did affect perceptions” about e-cigarettes, Meza said of EVALI.\n\nNJOY had provided the FDA with a long list of steps it intended to take to limit the use of its menthol e-cigarettes by youth, according to letters the agency sent to the company to notify it about the marketing authorization of its products. The measures included marketing restrictions such as prohibiting the use of cartoons, fruit or other food-related images, or imagery of any kind designed to appeal to minors and limiting the use of NJOY-owned social media properties to receiving customer service communications. However, as Lindblom pointed out, instead of requiring implementation of all the restrictions proposed by NJOY, the FDA said only that it encouraged the company to do so.\n\nInterestingly, although 1 in 10 high school students reported current use of e-cigarettes in 2023, only 1.6% of middle school and high school students reported current use of combustible cigarettes, the National Youth Tobacco Survey found.\n\n“Youth smoking is gone,” Meza noted. “I think figuring out why would teach us a lot.”\n\nAlthough youth initiation is on the “con” side in the FDA’s calculus, adult smoking cessation is on the “pro” side.\n\n“There is high-certainty evidence that ECs [electronic cigarettes] with nicotine increase quit rates” compared with nicotine replacement therapy, the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group concluded in its systematic review of studies on the use of ECs for smoking cessation, published in January. However, the group noted, the evidence base is imprecise due to the small number of randomized controlled trials.\n\nMore recently, another systematic review published in June concluded that e-cigarettes possibly increase smoking cessation, although the certainty of the evidence ranges from very low to moderate. Plus, the review found, most studies might not have lasted long enough for adverse events attributed to e-cigarettes to emerge.\n\nThe lack of evidence on long-term benefits and harms of e-cigarette use shows the need for more research, wrote the authors, who conducted the review to inform the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care’s e-cigarettes clinical practice guidelines.\n\nIn its latest recommendation statement on tobacco smoking cessation interventions, published in JAMA in January 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that the evidence on the use of e-cigarettes for tobacco smoking cessation in adults was insufficient, so the balance of benefits and harms could not be determined.\n\nFor adults who smoke, switching completely to e-cigarettes may reduce their exposure to toxins, the FDA website states: “Cigarette smoke contains more than 7000 chemicals, about 70 of which are linked to cancer.” E-cigarette aerosol, or vapor, contains fewer and lower levels of toxic chemicals than cigarette smoke, but they still aren’t safe, the agency notes.\n\n“These products deliver harmful chemicals and contain nicotine, which is highly addictive,” the FDA points out, adding that “further high-quality research on both short- and long-term health outcomes is needed.”\n\nFor example, concerns have been raised about pulegone, a constituent of oil extracts from mint plants that is used to flavor some menthol e-cigarettes. The FDA banned synthetic pulegone as a food additive in 2018 because it is a carcinogen when given orally to rodents. A research letter in 2019 in JAMA Internal Medicine suggested that users of mint- and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes are exposed to higher pulegone levels than smokers of combustible menthol cigarettes. As the authors noted, though, whether users of menthol e-cigarettes or combustible cigarettes absorbed and metabolized pulegone quantities associated with a carcinogenic effect wasn’t known.\n\nIf people use e-cigarettes for smoking cessation, “they have to quit e-cigarettes as well,” emphasized Wei Li, MD, MPH, PhD, a postdoctoral associate in psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, where he studies tobacco control and regulatory science.\n\nE-cigarettes may be less toxic than combustible cigarettes, “but the standard of comparison is an incredibly toxic mixture,” Jonathan Samet, MD, MS, told JAMA Medical News. Comparing the toxicity of e-cigarette vapor to cigarette smoke is like comparing polluted air to car exhaust straight from the tailpipe, said Samet, a pulmonologist and epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health and former chair of the FDA’s Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee.\n\nAs the FDA states, adult smokers may benefit if they totally replace combustible cigarettes with e-cigarettes. The problem is that some people add e-cigarettes without subtracting many or any combustible cigarettes, which the FDA has failed to adequately address, Lindblom noted.\n\n“I see it in my patients all the time,” said Michael Fiore, MD, MPH, MBA, explaining that some smokers use e-cigarettes in places where they can’t light up combustible cigarettes.\n\nInstead of helping people to stop smoking combustible cigarettes, this dual use ends up sustaining it, said Fiore, who cofounded the University of Wisconsin Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention in 1992 and served as director until July of this year.\n\nAs global cigarette consumption steadily declines, the tobacco industry’s latest business strategy has been to reinvent itself as a purveyor of harm reduction in the form of nicotine-laden e-cigarettes, Fiore and Howard Koh, MD, MPH, of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, noted in a 2022 JAMA Viewpoint and a 2023 opinion piece in STAT.\n\nAnd yet, Fiore and Koh wrote, the tobacco industry has blocked tobacco control measures that, unlike e-cigarettes, are backed by solid evidence, such as tobacco taxes and graphic warning labels on packages.\n\nSometimes patients who’ve unsuccessfully tried to quit smoking with nicotine replacement therapy or varenicline (Chantix) ask him about e-cigarettes, Fiore said. He advises them to totally replace combustible cigarettes with e-cigarettes and set a deadline for quitting those. “We have no information about the long-term adverse effects of e-cigarettes,” he explained.\n\nFiore emphasized that “I don’t bring up e-cigarettes or recommend them. If my patient says, ‘I want to try it,’ I give them guidance.”\n\nGiven that the FDA hasn’t approved any e-cigarettes to help people quit smoking, physicians don’t have much to guide them.\n\n“If I’m going to look at a therapy for a patient, I’m going to look at a study for a drug,” said Rachel Boykan, MD, a pediatric hospitalist at Stony Brook Children’s Hospital who sometimes fields requests from patients’ parents for help in quitting smoking. But evidence for e-cigarettes as smoking cessation tools stems mainly from observational studies, not clinical trials, she noted. “The available evidence is not there in the form that we physicians are used to looking at.”\n\nSo when parents ask if they should try e-cigarettes to quit smoking, “I say there is no approval for that,” explained Boykan, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Section on Nicotine and Tobacco Prevention and Treatment and an author of the organization’s policy statement on e-cigarettes.\n\nMenthol flavoring in tobacco products has a sordid history because tobacco companies long targeted Black smokers in their menthol cigarette marketing. Menthol cigarettes are “disproportionately killing African Americans,” Fiore noted.\n\nYolanda Lawson, MD, president of the National Medical Association, expressed concern that by authorizing menthol e-cigarettes, the FDA will further increase such disparities.\n\n“The use of menthol in tobacco products has been proven to be a deadly and addictive substance that disproportionately targets Black communities, especially our youth who are at an elevated risk of nicotine addiction,” Lawson said in a statement issued in response to the FDA’s authorization of the NJOY menthol e-cigarettes. “As Black physicians, we are outraged by the FDA's decision and their continued choice to prioritize commerce over public health.”\n\nA 2023 analysis of data from the 1999-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for adult smokers 20 years or older found that in total, about 29% used menthol cigarettes. But non-Hispanic Black smokers had the highest prevalence of menthol cigarette use—73%, or nearly 2½ times that of the total population of smokers.\n\nThe findings “suggest that eliminating menthol cigarette use could strengthen ongoing health equity–related efforts to reduce US smoking prevalence,” according to a summary of the research.\n\nNearly a year before that study was published, the FDA issued a proposed rule that would prohibit menthol cigarettes. In a press release, US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra called the rule “an important step to advance health equity by significantly reducing tobacco-related health disparities.”\n\nThe FDA had set a deadline of August 2023 to publish the final rule. This past April, 9 months after the final rule’s missed deadline, Becerra issued a statement explaining that “It’s clear that there are still more conversations to have, and that will take significantly more time.”\n\nThe Biden administration is concerned that banning menthol cigarettes would alienate Black voters who mistakenly think that such a move would lead to prosecution of menthol cigarette smokers, according to news reports.\n\n“There’s been a lot of cowardice around banning menthol,” Samet said. “The FDA has backed off of that repeatedly. It’s become a politicized issue, sort of racialized.”\n\nBack in 2011, when Samet was chair, the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee concluded that a menthol cigarette ban would be good for public health. “Menthol is the perfect agent to get irritating stuff, including nicotine, deep in the lung,” he recently explained. “It cools and anesthetizes.”\n\nThat appears to be the case with menthol e-cigarettes as well, suggested a 2023 study that compared menthol-flavored with tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes. The researchers found that the menthol-flavored e-cigarettes generated more particles and were associated with worse lung function. More particles means an increase in the mass of e-cigarette aerosols, which contain harmful substances such as nicotine and formaldehyde, delivered to the lung, the authors wrote.\n\nTrying to ban menthol cigarettes but authorizing menthol e-cigarettes might seem like a contradiction.\n\n“What’s troublesome here is the legitimizing of menthol,” Samet pointed out.\n\nAt one time, the FDA’s thinking about menthol e-cigarettes seemed to be “if they’re going to ban menthol in cigarettes, it might be reasonable to have an alternative for those who want to quit smoking,” Meza explained.\n\nBut research findings are mixed on whether menthol-flavored e-cigarettes are more effective than tobacco-flavored cigarettes in helping smokers quit.\n\nNJOY submitted data and analyses from an online, observational longitudinal cohort study, according to 2 FDA decision summaries, each of which covers 2 NJOY menthol e-cigarettes. The study, whose results haven’t been published, assessed rates of complete switching from combustible cigarettes to NJOY’s menthol- or tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes as well as cessation of both combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes.\n\nNJOY’s analyses suggested that its menthol-flavored e-cigarettes were associated with statistically significant higher rates of complete switching than its tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes, according to the FDA’s decision summaries.\n\nHowever, Lindblom pointed out, NJOY compared its menthol e-cigarettes with only its tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes, not with the FDA-approved smoking cessation options, nicotine replacement therapy and varenicline.\n\nOther studies’ findings have been mixed about whether any flavored e-cigarettes are associated with higher cessation rates than unflavored e-cigarettes.\n\nFor example, Li coauthored an article published in June that used the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study, a collaboration between the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA, to identify adults who reported using electronic nicotine device systems to quit smoking. The findings showed that daily e-cigarette use could help smokers abstain from combustible cigarettes, but that flavoring wasn’t a factor in abstinence.\n\nGiven fruit- and minty-flavored e-cigarettes’ appeal to young people without any added benefit over tobacco-flavored products, “I don’t think menthol flavor is a really good way to help smoking cessation,” Li told JAMA Medical News, adding that he was “very surprised” with the FDA’s authorization of NJOY’s menthol e-cigarettes.\n\nBut a study by Meza and colleagues that also used PATH data, presented in March as a poster at the 2024 meeting of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT), found that flavored e-cigarettes were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of smoking cessation, while exclusive use of unflavored or tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes was not.\n\n“Flavored ENDS might help some people who smoke quit,” the researchers concluded. “This should be considered against the risk of ENDS use among youth to inform ENDS policies and regulations.”\n\nUsing a different dataset, Reza and colleagues reported in October 2022 that e-cigarette use in general was positively associated with both attempting to quit and succeeding. But quitting successfully was more likely among smokers who used flavored-e-cigarettes, including menthol.\n\nQuit success wasn’t significantly different between menthol or mint-flavored e-cigarettes and the other nontobacco-flavored e-cigarettes, the authors noted. The finding implies that nontobacco-flavored e-cigarettes that are so appealing to youth could come off the market without diminishing e-cigarettes’ role in helping smokers quit.\n\nTwo weeks before the FDA authorized the NJOY menthol e-cigarettes, the agency rescinded its 2-year-old marketing denial orders for JUUL e-cigarettes.\n\nAt the time of the denial, the FDA said JUUL hadn’t demonstrated that marketing its tobacco- and menthol-flavored products, which contain high nicotine concentrations, would be appropriate for protecting the public’s health. The next day, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit entered a temporary administrative stay of the FDA’s marketing denial orders for the JUUL products. Less than 2 weeks later, the FDA temporarily suspended its JUUL orders because “there are scientific issues…that warrant additional review.”\n\nThe June 2024 move returns JUUL’s applications to pending status, neither denied nor authorized. The agency’s news release cited 2 reasons for rescinding the JUUL marketing denial orders: court decisions that created new case law regarding marketing denial orders for e-cigarettes from other manufacturers and more experience with scientific issues regarding e-cigarettes.\n\nBut Samet, for one, is skeptical that the science will ever show that menthol e-cigarettes have any redeeming value. “Would public health be better off without menthol?” he asked. “I think the answer is ‘Yes.’”\n\nBack to top\n\nArticle Information\n\nPublished Online: August 7, 2024. doi:10.1001/jama.2024.14243"
