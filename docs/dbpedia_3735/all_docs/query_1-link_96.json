        "text": "Critics say Saudi Arabia is ‘sportwashing’ with event\n\n⭐️HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW⭐️\n\nThe Esports World Cup kicked off in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on July 3.\n\nThe event runs until Aug. 25 and includes 1,500 esports players from around the world.\n\nFortnite, League of Legends and Call of Duty are among the featured games.\n\nBut some people are criticizing the event.\n\nKeep on reading to find out why. ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️\n\nGamers far and wide are moving their attention from their consoles to one of the biggest esports events ever.\n\nOn July 2, the first ever Esports World Cup (EWC) began at Boulevard City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, bringing together thousands of the world’s biggest and best esports players.\n\nThe festival, which lasts until Aug. 25, includes more than $60 million US (about $81 million Cdn) in prizes, one of the largest prize pools in esports history.\n\n“The Esports World Cup is a major moment in esports history,” said Ralf Reichert, CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation in a news release.\n\nOrganizers say the world cup is the next big step in the esports global phenomenon, but some critics say the event is Saudi Arabia’s latest attempt at “sportswashing.”\n\nSportswashing is when countries use sporting events to try and “clean up” their image on the world stage.\n\n3 things to know about Faker, League of Legends world champion\n\nGames on deck\n\nThe EWC opening ceremony included streamers like Faker, Tyler1 (loltyler1) and Danny Aarons.\n\nMore than 1,500 esports players from the top esports clubs around the world are participating, according to organizers.\n\nThe eight-week tournament will include 22 competitions in 21 games, including:\n\nApex Legends.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III.\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone.\n\nCounter-Strike 2.\n\nDota 2.\n\nEA Sports FC 24.\n\nFortnite.\n\nFree Fire.\n\nHonor of Kings.\n\nLeague of Legends.\n\nMobile Legends: Bang Bang.\n\nOverwatch 2.\n\nPUBG Battlegrounds.\n\nPUBG Mobile.\n\nESL R1.\n\nRocket League.\n\nStarCraft II.\n\nStreet Fighter 6.\n\nTeamfight Tactics.\n\nTekken 8.\n\nTom Clancy’s Rainbow 6 Siege.\n\nOf the total prize pool, $20 million US (about $27 million Cdn) is reserved for a unique award called the Club Championship.\n\nPOLL — Olympic Esports Series began last week. Which game would you play?\n\nThe championship is awarded to the gaming club with the most overall championships across all games in the tournament.\n\nBut it’s not all about gaming — the EWC has transformed Riyadh into an “epicentre of esports fandom” with a host of events and celebrations throughout the eight weeks.\n\nEvent criticized for sportswashing\n\nNot everyone is celebrating this event.\n\nIn April, esports YouTuber Travis Gafford — who has 213,000 subscribers — published a video saying that he would not be watching or covering the tournament.\n\n“I’m incredibly uncomfortable with esports deciding to partner with a government who has a terrible track record of human rights abuses,” he said.\n\nIndeed, according to Amnesty International, Saudi Arabia has a history of discrimination against women, limiting freedom of speech and detaining political opponents, among other human rights violations.\n\nGafford said he’s heard many people suggest that, in order to survive, the gaming industry can’t afford to pass on opportunities like the one in Saudi Arabia.\n\nGaming expert Geoffrey Lachapelle, who manages the Red Bull Gaming Hub at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU), said teams are in a difficult position when considering whether to participate, but it often comes down to money.\n\n“[Teams] need to continue to operate as a business,” he said.\n\n“There are very few options for them to compete at a world stage level. And this is one of the biggest in terms of prize pool.”\n\nOn June 10, Victor Goossens, CEO of Team Liquid, one of the biggest esports teams, said in a video on X that deciding to participate in the event was not an easy one.\n\nGoossens called out Saudi Arabia’s track record on human rights, and said any team members who didn’t feel comfortable attending had the organization’s support.\n\n“We believe that if Team Liquid does not participate in the largest and most influential events in our space, especially one that lasts a duration of two months, that over time we cannot be a top tier organization within esports.”\n\nEsports school is a dream come true for Montreal teen\n\nAccording to Reuters, Saudi Arabia has denied accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.\n\nIn September 2023, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman addressed the accusations of sportwashing and didn’t deny them.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, he said he doesn’t care about sportswashing and will continue to fund sports if it makes the country richer.\n\nResults already coming in\n\nAnd for the fans, this fun has already started.\n\nAmong some of the notable results, Team Liquid beat Fnatic in League of Legends, “a big win in the classic North America-Europe rivalry in that game,” according to Lachapelle.\n\n“This is something that really connects with people internationally and across every major region of the world and brings a lot of fans together to watch this kind of content,” he said.\n\nHave more questions?
