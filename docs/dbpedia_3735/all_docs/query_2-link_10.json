        "text": "What is the legal framework governing bribery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)?\n\nIn KSA, bribery and corruption are governed by several distinct and overlapping laws. However, the Anti-Bribery Law (promulgated pursuant to Royal Decree M/36 dated 29/12/1412H corresponding to July 1, 1992), is the key piece of legislation that prohibits bribery of public officials in KSA and KSA recently expanded its anti-bribery legislation to the private sector by way of Royal Decree 4 of 1440 in March 2019.\n\nWhat constitutes a bribe?\n\nA bribe is not expressly defined under the Anti-Bribery Law, however, the constituent parts of the bribery offenses under the Anti-Bribery Law broadly indicate that a bribe is a gift, financial or other advantage offered or received directly or indirectly, to induce or reward the improper performance of a person’s professional duty.\n\nWhat are the principal offenses under this legal framework?\n\nPublic officials are deemed to have received a bribe if they accept or receive gifts or the promise of one in order to perform, abstain from performing or violate any of their duties (arts. 1, 2 and 3).\n\nPublic officials are also deemed to have received a bribe if they accept or receive gifts for exercising their influence in order to obtain from a public authority a benefit in the form of a job, act, order, decision, obligation, license, supply agreement, or service (art. 5).\n\nFor the purposes of the KSA Anti-Bribery Law, public official is broadly defined and includes those employed by the government or a public body (whether on a permanent or temporary basis), arbitrators or experts appointed by the government or by any authority with judicial capacity, those assigned to a specific assignment by the Saudi government, those employed by individual companies or institutions which are in charge of managing and operating a public facility or performing a public service, employees, members and boards of directors of civil associations of public interest, employees of international institutions and organizations in connection with the conduct of international business, as well as those employed by joint stock companies or companies to which the government contributes capital or that perform banking activities.\n\nIndividuals who offer, promise, or grant a gift or benefit to another working at a private organization or company, private establishment or professional body, in order to get them to act in breach of their professional duties, commit an offense (art. 9 bis 1 of the Anti-Bribery Law).\n\nIndividuals who work at private organizations, companies, establishments or professional bodies, and request or accept a gift, or a promise of one, in order to act in breach of their professional duties, commit an offense (art. 9 bis 2 of the Anti-Bribery Law).\n\nPersons who incite or knowingly assist in the commission of the bribery offense shall be deemed to be an accomplice (art. 10 of the Anti-Bribery Law).\n\nPersons who have been appointed by the bribed or the briber to receive the bribe and accept this role while knowing the underlying reason (art. 11 of the Anti-Bribery Law).\n\nWhat is the jurisdictional reach of the legal framework?\n\nKSA anti-bribery legislation does not expressly have extra-territorial effect; accordingly, it applies only to crimes committed within the territory of the Kingdom.\n\nWho may be liable for bribery? (public officials, private individuals, legal entities etc.)\n\nThe bribe payer, the bribe recipient, any intermediary and any other person who has taken part in conduct criminalized under the anti-bribery legislation shall be penalized in accordance with the sanctions prescribed in the legislation. Furthermore, any person who has agreed, incited or knowingly assisted in the commission of the crime shall be deemed to be an accomplice and subject to the sanctions as prescribed under KSA antibribery legislation, provided the crime was committed in pursuance of that agreement or incitement. Liability can apply to public officials, private individuals and legal entities.\n\nCan a parent company be liable for its subsidiary’s involvement in bribery?\n\nYes. The circumstances in which this may occur are fact-specific. Some possibilities include:\n\nthe subsidiary is established as a branch in KSA in which the principal parent may be directly liable for the acts of the subsidiary;\n\nthe parent company acts as an intermediary or incites the bribery offense; or\n\nthe parent company benefits from the bribery offense. If the parent company knows or should have known about the bribery offense and benefits from it, it is possible that the parent company would be held liable.\n\nAre facilitation payments (i.e. small payments to speed up routine governmental action) considered bribes?\n\nYes, provided they meet the criteria, facilitation payments are considered bribery, no matter how small the amount.\n\nDoes the legal framework restrict political and charitable contributions?\n\nThere are no express provisions under KSA anti-bribery legislation that restrict charitable contributions.\n\nThere are, however, restrictions under fundraising and charity laws which could apply. Fundraising and the establishment of charities in KSA is highly regulated, in part, to mitigate the risk of terrorism financing and money laundering. Charities are closely scrutinized and regulated and fundraising is only permitted in partnership with locally established charities.\n\nAs KSA is an absolute monarchy, political contributions are not applicable.\n\nDoes the legal framework place restrictions on corporate hospitality?\n\nKSA anti-bribery legislation contains no express provisions with regard to corporate hospitality, and any financial or other advantage given in that context would be assessed by reference to the provisions described in this note.\n\nAre there any defenses for bribery offenses?\n\nThe KSA anti-bribery legislation states that a briber or intermediary shall be exonerated from the principal and accessory offenses if they report to the authorities before the crime is discovered (art. 16).\n\nWhat are the key regulatory or enforcement bodies with regard to bribery?\n\nThe National Anti-Corruption Commission (Nazaha) is a KSA governmental anti-corruption agency. The main objective of Nazaha is to promote integrity and transparency and fight all forms of corruption in the administrative and financial domains.\n\nThe Control and Investigation Board has the authority to investigate reports of criminal activity by government, military or public institutions’ employees that involve corruption, bribery and the misuse of power. The Control and Investigation Board also has the power to prosecute bribery cases before the Board of Grievances (an independent administrative judicial committee), which has jurisdiction over such matters.\n\nPublic Prosecution has the authority to investigate all criminal activity.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency has the power to investigate any suspicious financial transactions that appear to be unlawful.\n\nThe Public Prosecution has the authority to investigate and expose administrative corruption.\n\nThe Capital Market Authority is KSA’s government financial regulatory authority responsible for capital markets in KSA. Its objectives are to create an appropriate investment environment, reinforce transparency and disclosure standards in all listed companies, and to protect investors and dealers from illegal acts in the market.\n\nWhat are the legal consequences of being found guilty of bribery offenses?\n\nPenalty\n\nApplication\n\nFor each offense:\n\nup to ten years’ imprisonment;\n\na fine not exceeding SAR1 million (art.1)); and/or\n\nremoval or being barred from public office (art. 13).\n\nPublic officials who accept or receive a promise or a gift to perform, abstain or violate any of their duties even if the duties are lawful (art. 1, 2, 3,).\n\nPublic officials who accept or receive a promise or a gift for exercising influence in order to obtain a benefit, service, act, job, order, decision, obligation, license, supply agreement from the public authority (art. 5).\n\nFor each offense:\n\nup to five years’ imprisonment; and/or\n\na fine not exceeding SAR500,000 (art. 9 (bis 1) and 9 (bis 2).\n\nIndividuals who offer or promise a gift or benefit to any person working at a private entity or professional body in order to get them to act in breach of their professional duties (art. 9 (bis 1)).\n\nIndividuals working at a private entity or professional body who request or accept a gift or a promise of one in order to act in breach of their professional duties (art. 9 (bis 2)).\n\nUp to two years’ imprisonment and/or a fine not exceeding SAR50,000 (art. 11)\n\nIndividuals who have been appointed by the bribed or the briber to receive a bribe, and who accept to do so while knowing the underlying reason.\n\nUp to ten years’ imprisonment and a fine of up to SAR1 million (art. 9).\n\nIndividuals who offer or promise to offer a bribe, and such a bribe is rejected.\n\nConfiscation of the proceeds of crime, privilege or gift (art. 15).\n\nFor all offenses that are committed in breach of the Anti-Bribery Law.\n\nPunishment of more than the maximum penalty prescribed for the crime but not exceeding double (art. 18).\n\nIndividuals who have already been convicted of a bribery offense under the KSA anti-bribery legislation, and commit bribery again within five years of the previous sentence.\n\nFine up to ten times of the value of the bribe, and barred from entering into procurement contracts, and implementing works and projects (art. 19).\n\nNational and foreign private and institutional companies whose personnel have been convicted of offenses under the KSA Anti-Bribery Law, and were committed to serve the interest of that company or institution.\n\nAre deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) or other similar settlement mechanisms available?\n\nBribery offenses are not currently capable of being settled by way of DPA under KSA anti-bribery legislation.\n\nNo formal settlement mechanisms are available under the Anti-Bribery Law.\n\nOn an informal basis, settlements can be discussed with the regulator at any stage during investigations or prosecution, but no consistent or transparent mechanisms currently exist in KSA for settlement."
