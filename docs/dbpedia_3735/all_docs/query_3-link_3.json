        "text": "Cabinet of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n\nThe Saudi Council of Ministers (Arabic: مجلس الوزراء السعودي Majlis al-Wuzarā' as-Su'ūdī) is the cabinet of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is led by the King. The council consists of the king, the Crown Prince, and cabinet ministers. The Crown Prince is also the Prime minister and Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Since 2015, there are 23 ministers with portfolio and seven ministers of state, two of whom have special responsibilities. All members of the council are appointed by royal decree.[1]\n\nThe Council of Ministers was established by King Abdulaziz in 1953. It is responsible for \"drafting and overseeing the implementation of the internal, external, financial, economic, educational and defense policies, and general affairs of the state.\"[1] It functions in accordance with the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia and is advised by the Consultative Assembly.[2] Legislation must be ratified by a royal decree. It meets every Tuesday and is chaired by the Crown Prince in his capacity as Prime Minister or one of his deputies.[3][4] It is the final authority for financial, executive and administrative matters. Its resolutions are non-binding unless agreed upon by a majority vote. In case of a tie, the Prime Minister casts the tie-breaking vote. The present law governing the form and function of the Council of Ministers was issued by King Fahd in 1993.[1] Among others, it stipulates that every member of the Council must be \"a Saudi national by birth and descent; well-known for righteousness and capability;\" and \"not previously convicted for a crime of immorality or dishonor.\"[1]\n\nIn the early hours of 29 April 2015, King Salman issued 25 royal decrees which included a cabinet reshuffle. This included the removal of his brother Muqrin bin Abdulaziz as Crown Prince and appointment of his nephew Muhammad bin Nayef. The King appointed his son Mohammed bin Salman as Deputy Crown Prince.[5][6]\n\nIn another reshuffle on 21 June 2017, King Salman removed his nephew as Crown Prince and appointed his son, Mohammed bin Salman, as the new Crown Prince.[7][8]\n\nMembers\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of Saudi Ministries\n\nSaudi Council of Ministers[3] Portfolio Minister Since Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman 2022 Minister of Defense Khalid bin Salman 2022 Minister of the National Guard Abdullah bin Bandar Al Saud 2018[9] Minister of Interior Abdulaziz bin Saud Al Saud 2017 Minister of Foreign Affairs Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud 2019 Minister of Islamic Affairs, Dawah, and Guidance Abdullatif bin Abdulaziz Al-Sheikh 2018[10] Minister of Education Yousef al-Benyan [ar] 2022[9] Minister of Justice Walid al-Samaani 2015 Minister of Energy Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud 2019 Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Bandar al-Khorayef 2019[11] Minister of Transport Saleh bin Nasser al-Jasser 2017 Minister of Commerce Majid al-Qasabi 2016[12] Minister of Investment Khalid A.

Amongst a wide range of decrees and in a bid to streamline decision-making and make the government more efficient, the king abolished 12 public bodies – namely, the Higher Committee for Education Policy, Higher Committee for Administrative Organization, Civil Service Council, Higher Commission of King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, Council of Higher Education and Universities, Supreme Council for Education, Supreme Council for Petroleum and Minerals, Supreme Economic Council, National Security Council, Supreme Council of King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy, Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, and the Supreme Council for Disabled Affairs – responsible for drawing up policies in fields ranging from energy to education. To eliminate redundancies, King Salman replaced them with two new councils linked to the Council of Ministers: the Council for Security and Political Affairs (CSPA) headed by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Nayef, and the Council of Economic and Development Affairs (CEDA) headed by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.[17][18][19]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nSaudi Arabia portal\n\nPolitics of Saudi Arabia\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
