The amendments mean that all travellers in the EU/EEA are subject to the same requirements for entry into Sweden. The decision was made due to the increasing spread of infection and based on a request from the Public Health Agency of Sweden. The list of countries with approved vaccine certificates has also been updated. The amendments came into effect on 21 December.\n\nVaccine booster dose for people aged 65 years and older\n\n11 November 2021\n\nRegion Stockholm now offers a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine for people aged 65 years and older, as well as personnel in residential care homes, SÄBO, and in home healthcare and home care services.

The Government has also decided on changes to the effect that travellers who can present a vaccine certificate issued in the US, Guernsey, Isle of Man or Jersey are exempted from the entry ban and test requirement when entering Sweden. The Government’s decision to extend the ban on entry to Sweden is primarily due to the continued uncertainty concerning transmission of COVID-19.

The temporary entry ban entered into force on 19 March 2020 and initially applied for 30 days. It has subsequently been extended on several occasions, and under the latest such decision, the entry ban now applies until 31 October 2021. The entry ban means that a foreign citizen departing from a state other than an EEA State or Switzerland travelling to Sweden will be denied entry into Sweden and turned away. There are a number of exemptions from the ban, but travellers are normally required to present a negative COVID-19 test result even if they are covered by one of the exemptions. Please find the full press release in the link below.\n\nHandling procedures\n\n23 September 2021\n\nThe Protocol Department would like to inform embassies, consulates and international organizations that due to increased workload and lack of staffing, handling times for various services, including residence permits and ID cards, may take longer than usual.

The eHealth Agency will then send the COVID certificate to the address which is registered with the Tax Agency. For most diplomats, this address will be the concerned Embassy’s address. Children over the age of 16 may request a COVID certificate by themselves. If difficulties arise, the eHealth Agency can be reached by email at [email protected] or by telephone at 0771-766 200. If there are any errors in the content of the COVID certificate, the health care provider which has carried out the vaccination should be contacted.

If you apply for a visitor’s residence permit before your visa, your visa-free period or your current residence permit has expired, you have the right to remain in Sweden until the Migration Agency has made a decision. Please note that it is important to apply before the current permit or visa-free period expires.
