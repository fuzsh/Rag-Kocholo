        "text": "In the past week, Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi of Jordan has twice met with senior Iranian officials, including the newly elected Iranian president, in a rare visit to Tehran.\n\n“Jordan informed the Iranian brothers of its message in a clear manner,” Muhannad al-Mubaidin, Jordan’s minister of government communications, said in an interview. “We will not allow for our airspace or land to be used for any purpose. We are not willing to be a battlefield.”\n\nIn April, Jordan helped intercept missiles and drones fired by Iran at Israel after senior Iranian officers were killed in an airstrike on Iran’s embassy complex in Damascus, Syria. The strike was widely attributed to Israel.\n\nThe latest tensions between Israel and Iran have put Jordan in a particularly challenging position. While it maintains a strong relationship with the United States and close security coordination with Israel, Jordan also has millions of citizens of Palestinian origin, including many who fiercely oppose aiding Israel in any form.\n\n“Jordan has to strike a very delicate balance,” said Saud al-Sharafat, a former brigadier general in Jordan’s intelligence service. “It’s like walking on a tightrope.”\n\nLast week, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that avenging Mr. Haniyeh’s death was “our duty” because he had been killed on Iranian soil. He promised to deliver “a severe punishment.”\n\nCountries farther from Israel have also been urging Iran to refrain from escalating regional tensions.\n\nIn a phone call on Monday, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the prime minister of Qatar, told Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, that he had spoken to Ali Bagheri Kani, the Iranian foreign minister, about the need for restraint, according to an official familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.\n\nThe Qatari prime minister also informed Mr. Blinken that Qatar had given a similar message to Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia that has been exchanging fire with Israeli forces along the Lebanon-Israel border, the official said. Hezbollah says it is fighting there in support of Hamas in Gaza. Both groups are backed by Iran.\n\nHours before Mr. Haniyeh’s assassination, Israel killed Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah’s top military official, in response to a deadly strike on a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights days earlier. Israel blamed Hezbollah for that strike, but the group denied responsibility.\n\nEarlier this week, Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech that his group and Iran were “obliged to respond” to the killings of Mr. Shukr and Mr. Haniyeh, “whatever the consequences.”\n\n“What is required is confrontation,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty of Egypt called Mr. Bagheri Kani as a part of his country’s efforts to “contain the escalation in the region,” the Egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nSaudi Arabia on Wednesday expressed sympathy for Iran’s position and sharply criticized Israel during an extraordinary meeting in Saudi Arabia of foreign ministers from countries belonging to the Organization for Islamic Cooperation.\n\nThe Saudi deputy foreign minister, Waleed El Khereiji, said that Mr. Haniyeh’s assassination had been a “blatant violation” of Iran’s “sovereignty, its regional and national security and of international law.” Mr. El Khereiji added that the kingdom called on the international community to force Israel to “bear responsibility for its crimes,” including attacks on Palestinian civilians.\n\nAmid the flurry of calls and meetings, some officials in the Arab world were predicting that Iran would conduct a limited response.\n\nOne adviser for an Arab country whose officials speak frequently with their Iranian counterparts said they saw Iran as “smart and cautious” and that while they did expect a response to Mr. Haniyeh’s assassination, they thought it would be calibrated to avoid further escalation. The adviser spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to disrupt diplomatic channels.\n\nReducing tensions, Jordanian officials said, was important for giving an agreement on a cease-fire in Gaza a chance to be reached.\n\n“It’s not possible to end a war while you’re witnessing an escalation from all the sides,” Mr. Mubaidin, the government communications minister, said.\n\nVivian Yee and Vivian Nereim contributed reporting.\n\n“I thought that after they killed Haniyeh, they had already achieved their goal and that we were closer to the end of the war,” said Nisreen Sabouh, a 37-year-old displaced mother of four.\n\n“But now, with Sinwar taking over, I don’t believe this will bring the negotiations to a better place,” she said, adding that Mr. Sinwar, who remains the head of Hamas in Gaza, “is tough and everyone knows that.”\n\nThe situation in Gaza has continued to worsen as Israeli troops have in recent weeks been returning to parts of Gaza where they said Hamas had regrouped. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, too, has expressed little appetite for compromise, insisting last month on further concessions from Hamas in negotiations.\n\nThe Israeli army ordered the evacuation of parts of the northern town of Beit Hanoun on Wednesday, the latest in a series of recent directives that have forced tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians to relocate yet again amid ongoing airstrikes and shelling.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the change in the leadership of the group that had governed them — often oppressively — was one of the many things some people said they no longer had the luxury to worry about.\n\n“I don’t care who Hamas chooses to lead the movement inside or outside,” said Safaa Oda, a 39-year-old cartoonist from the southern city of Rafah who was displaced to a tent in Khan Younis.\n\n“What we need is a cease-fire,” she said, adding that she believes that Sinwar’s appointment will make the situation in Gaza “worse than ever before.”\n\nMr. Sinwar, who is believed to be hiding out in tunnels deep beneath Gaza, has been widely seen as trying to keep Hamas’s focus more on military power than on running a civilian government. Hamas leaders have said they want to ignite a permanent state of war with Israel on all fronts as a way to revive the Palestinian cause.\n\nHusam al-Khateeb, a 45-year-old technician at a local radio station from Deir al Balah, in central Gaza, described Mr. Sinwar as “the most obstinate man I have ever seen.”\n\nMr. Sinwar was “willing to do anything for the sake of the movement’s survival,” he said. A solution to the conflict and an end to the war would not come from Mr. Sinwar or from inside Gaza, he said, but from Iran and its proxies and the United States.\n\nIbtihal Shurrab, 29, from Khan Younis, noted the widespread thinking that Mr. Haniyeh was more of a figurehead, while Mr. Sinwar “has the first and last word in everything.”\n\n“It is a scary situation that we live in,” she said. “I hope Sinwar can be the one to end the war, the way he was the one who started it.”\n\nAbu Bakr Bashir contributed reporting from London.\n\nAmerican and Israeli officials have accused Hamas of intransigence over the deal, and they say Mr. Sinwar has always had the power to veto any proposal, given his leadership of the group in Gaza. Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, said the announcement on Tuesday would reinforce that role.\n\nThe choice of Mr. Sinwar “only underscores the fact that it is really on him to decide whether to move forward with a cease-fire,” Mr. Blinken said at a news conference in Annapolis, Md., late Tuesday, shortly after the appointment was announced. “He has been and remains the primary decider when it comes to concluding a cease-fire.”\n\nAt the same time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has taken a hard line, saying last week that he wanted to put more military pressure on Hamas to squeeze more concessions from the group. Families of hostages taken to Gaza on Oct. 7 have accused Mr. Netanyahu of doing too little to reach an agreement that would secure their release.\n\nAround 115 of the people seized as hostages on Oct. 7 remain in Gaza. That number includes the bodies of those who have died or been killed in captivity.\n\nHamas named Mr. Sinwar to replace Ismail Haniyeh, the group’s previous political leader and a key liaison in the indirect cease-fire talks with Israel. Mr. Haniyeh, who had been living in Qatar, was killed in an explosion in Iran last week that has been widely attributed to Israel.\n\nMr. Sinwar is a major target of Israel’s military, which has vowed to eliminate him. He has made no public appearances since the start of the war and communicates through intermediaries.\n\nIn effect, the naming of Mr. Sinwar to the position amounts to a new phase in the cease-fire talks because it binds Hamas to the leader most identified with the war, one who has previously adopted an inflexible approach, according to Mkhaimar Abusada, a professor of political science from Gaza City.\n\nHe said Mr. Sinwar was also more closely aligned with Iran than others in the group’s top leadership. Iran backs Hamas and has threatened retaliation for the assassination of Mr. Haniyeh.\n\n“He isn’t going to make any more concessions. He knows more than anyone else that the hostages are the only card he has,” said Mr. Abusada, who is now based in Cairo.\n\nChoosing a new leader for the political wing of Hamas would normally take months, and different segments of the group, including prisoners detained in Israel, would be consulted, according to Ibrahim Dalalsha, founder of the Horizon Center for Political Studies and Media Outreach, a research organization based in the West Bank. But Hamas made the decision quickly in order to send a message, he said.\n\nMr. Dalalsha said Mr. Sinwar cannot effectively oversee Hamas’s entire operation, given that he is in hiding, but the group wanted to signal that it views the war in Gaza, rather than developments in the West Bank, Qatar or elsewhere in the region, as its primary focus. Hamas’s selection of Mr. Sinwar also signals his primacy in the cease-fire talks.\n\n“It tells Israel in a defiant way that they are negotiating with Sinwar, so it’s blunt,” he said.\n\nBut Ehud Yaari, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, argued that while the new role for Mr. Sinwar was symbolically important for Hamas, it would make little difference in the negotiations, which he said have been deadlocked largely over arrangements for policing a strip of land between Gaza and Egypt.\n\nWaiting for Mr. Sinwar’s approval has often slowed cease-fire negotiations. It has sometimes taken a day to get a message to him and another day to receive a response.\n\nMr. Sinwar has sometimes disagreed with Hamas leaders outside Gaza and is seen as less ready to concede ground to the Israeli negotiators, in part because he knows that he is likely to be killed whether or not the war ends, analysts say. The death of Mr. Haniyeh, in an explosion in Tehran last week, lends credence to this perception — as has Israel’s response.\n\nIsraeli officials have vowed to kill Mr. Sinwar in retaliation for his work in planning the Oct. 7 attack, which they say killed about 1,200 people and led to roughly 250 being taken back to Gaza as hostages. The military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, reiterated that stance on Tuesday.\n\n“There is only one place for him, and that is alongside Muhammad Deif and all of the other terrorists who are responsible for Oct. 7,” he said, referring to another Hamas leader, whom Israel says it killed in an airstrike in July. “That is the only place we are preparing for him.”\n\nEphrat Livni contributed reporting.\n\nBut Mr. Kirby added that Mr. Sinwar had “always been the chief decision maker when it comes to negotiations” for a cease-fire. So in that sense, “nothing really changes,” he added.\n\n“And as the chief decision maker, he needs to decide now to take this deal, to get a cease-fire in place, to get some of those hostages home and to get us all an opportunity to get more humanitarian assistance in,” Mr. Kirby said. “He needs to accept the deal.”\n\nMr. Kirby repeated the White House position that the cease-fire talks were “as close as we’ve ever been” to a deal with only select gaps remaining that were “narrow enough that they can be closed.”\n\nHe also put the onus on Israel to accept the deal.\n\n“There is a good proposal before both sides, and they need to both accept that proposal so we can get this in place,” Mr. Kirby said.\n\nHe said that the United States was still “working really, really hard, with intense diplomacy” to avoid an escalation following the assassinations of Mr. Haniyeh in Tehran and a Hezbollah commander in Lebanon. “We certainly don’t want to see any sort of all-out regional war,” he said. “And there’s not a whole lot of indications that other parties here want to see the same thing.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Herzi Halevi, the military’s chief of staff, expressed readiness, telling soldiers after an assessment of the Tel-Nof Air Force Base, near Rehovoth: “I see peak readiness, both in offense and in defense.”\n\n“We will know how to carry out a very rapid offensive anywhere in Lebanon, anywhere in Gaza, anywhere in the Middle East, above ground and below ground,” he added.\n\nThe same day, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited troops at a base near Tel Aviv, welcoming new recruits, according to a video posted on social media. Addressing Israeli citizens broadly, he urged them to remain calm, cool and vigilant. He has said that Israel would “exact a heavy price for any act of aggression.”\n\nHaifa, Tel Aviv and other major cities were seeing an influx of search-and-rescue battalions, sent by the Israeli Home Front Command this week in preparation for any strikes on civilian centers. Residents have been told to stock up on food and water and limit their activities. In northern Israel, near Lebanon, outdoor gatherings are restricted to 30 people, and beaches are closed.\n\nWorld leaders have been urgently exchanging phone calls in an attempt to stave off an escalation. On Wednesday, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to his newly elected Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian, to urge restraint, a message the French leader was sending to everyone in the region, according to a statement from Mr. Macron’s office.\n\nPresident Biden spoke with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani, on Tuesday and with King Abdullah II of Jordan on Monday to convey a similar message.\n\nThe possibility of an escalation has rattled nerves around the region. In Lebanon, the government is stocking up on emergency supplies and preparing for worst-case scenarios. Iranians are watching and waiting.\n\nIran’s government has not issued directives about what citizens should do in the event of Israeli counterstrikes, leaving some Iranians anxious and confused. Iran issued a notice on Wednesday to civilian aviation agencies worldwide warning of military drills for several hours on Wednesday night and into Thursday over parts of the country. The announcement stoked fears of a possibly imminent strike, but the night passed with relative quiet.\n\nFarnaz Fassihi contributed reporting."
