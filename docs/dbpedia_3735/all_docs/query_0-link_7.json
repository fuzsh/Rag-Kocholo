        "text": "RIYADH: One man’s labor of love and passion, Al-Meger Palace nestled in Asir’s Al-Namas governorate, tells the story of history, tradition, and the beauty that is born out of resilience and hardship.\n\nThe museum is home to some of the oldest manuscripts from Islamic history, including 60 volumes from the era of the Prophet Muhammad, and thousands of handwritten manuscripts of the Holy Qur’an.\n\nSpeaking about how he acquired the manuscripts for the museum, Mohammed Al-Meger told Arab News: “People from all around the country, especially the south, sold me historical manuscripts of great significance.”\n\nThe palace is a convergence of world cultures, meticulously curated by Al-Meger. Its interiors bear thousands of Islamic motifs and its walls are saturated with architectural details of Umayyad and Abbasid civilizations.\n\nMy interest sparked when I was in Jerusalem marveling at the amalgamation of different styles of architecture from different periods of time.\n\nMohammed Al-Meger, Museum founder\n\n“The construction of Al-Meger Palace was no small feat, taking a staggering 35 years to complete and costing SR80 million ($21.3 million) to build,” he said.\n\nWith over 2 million stones sourced from the surrounding Asir region, the palace stands as a beacon of local architectural heritage. Al-Meger transformed a barren land populated by wildlife into an exquisite palace perched 2,400 meters above sea level.\n\n“My journey to creating the palace was fueled by a powerful discovery — a supplication manuscript penned by my father before his untimely passing,” he said.\n\nThis poignant relic became the guiding force behind his quest to immortalize his family's legacy through the palace, starting with collecting manuscripts.\n\nOrphaned at a young age, he faced challenges in his education, but Al-Meger persevered, spurred on by the memory of his late parents who were esteemed intellectuals. The palace is now part of the heritage village he built where tourists can stay.\n\n“One of the most striking features of Al-Meger Palace is its astronomical design, which allows the sun to trace a complete circle around the palace through its myriad windows,” he explained. “Sunlight streams into the palace from over 360 windows, facilitating the observation of the sun’s path within the structure.”\n\nThe seven domes that crown it symbolize the continents of the world, a reminder of global unity and interconnectedness. Inside, more than 365 columns stand tall, representing the days in a year and fostering a sense of timelessness.\n\nThe walls of Al-Meger Palace are also steeped in the rich history of the Umayyad and Abbasid civilizations, creating a visual tapestry that weaves together centuries of cultural legacy.\n\nAs visitors roam its hallowed halls, they are enveloped in a world of wonder and discovery, with each artifact being a testament to the enduring spirit of human creativity and ingenuity.\n\n“Tourists can see a collection of ancient Islamic texts covering a range of subjects such as medicine, mathematics, and astronomy,” he noted.\n\nAl-Meger said that scholars and historians have marveled at the architectural ingenuity of the palace, along with its rare manuscripts.\n\nThe museum’s collection includes the oldest manuscript penned by Jamal Al-Din Ibn Tumert Al-Andalusi from 720 AD, indicating that Arabs took up chemistry and physics. “The minister of culture sent a Chinese and French delegation with equipment to document and prove its authenticity,” said Al-Meger.\n\nThe cultural marvel’s success is born out the difficulties Al-Meger faced to achieve academic success.\n\n“I grew up without parents and attended school for three years before being expelled. I chose to care for village animals and relied on their milk for sustenance,” Al-Meger added, noting that he cared for the villagers’ sheep in Al-Namas until visiting his uncle in Tabuk at age 14.\n\nHis parents’ friends influenced him greatly as a child and he was told they were scholarly and intellectual.\n\nAl-Meger said: “I told my uncle that I am willing to attend any school that accepts me and so I left for Nablus, Palestine. I didn’t spend a single penny (on) it as all the people of Nablus honored me and hosted me better than any of their children.”\n\nWhen Al-Meger failed yet again, he moved to Jerusalem and a family took him in and enrolled him in Terra Sancta College. He wanted to become a doctor but failed once more.\n\n“My interest sparked when I was in Jerusalem marveling at the amalgamation of different styles of architecture resembling different periods do time,” he recalled.\n\nBack in Saudi Arabia, he joined the military and gained an interest in learning English and French: “I ranked ninth among 202 students in an officers’ course selection process and King Faisal awarded me my first certificate as a lieutenant after completing my training.”\n\nHe was then sent to the US. “After that, during my travels to Europe, I happened to pass by Spain and Andalusia and (learned about) the Islamic civilization there.\n\n“Then I took a vacation and took a tour from the US to the Philippines and Indonesia, looking for a homeland to live in … I did not mean to return to Saudi Arabia.”\n\nBut fate brought Al-Meger back home and he decided to visit his hometown of Al-Namas once more.\n\nAl-Meger visited the site his palace is now perched upon, describing it as one of the most beautiful sites he had seen in the world.\n\n“I took a trip to India, Pakistan, and the Philippines and found 20 talented builders to bring my vision to life,” he added.\n\nUpon its final opening in 2009, Al-Meger Palace captured the attention of visitors with its unique blend of world cultures, rare manuscripts, and breathtaking Andalusian architecture.\n\nToday, Al-Meger Palace serves as a tangible reminder not just of its historical significance, but also of resilience amid challenges and hardships.\n\nRIYADH: Six female students at Prince Sultan University have developed an accessibility attachment that can help to provide better spatial awareness for the visually impaired.\n\nPercevo was more than just a class project, but resulted from the enthusiasm of the students at the College of Computer and Information Sciences.\n\nRaneem Al-Soby, Aisha Ashworth, Haifa Eddin, Asma Khan, Danna Bakkr, and Dana Elhaj created their innovative device under the guidance of their supervisors, Dr. Anees Ara and Prof. Tanzila Saba.\n\nAl-Soby told Arab News: “Our group was driven by the desire to make a positive change using the skills we’ve developed and the knowledge we’ve gained.”\n\nThe team saw an opportunity to enhance the traditional white cane used by the visually impaired, which has remained largely unchanged since its invention in 1921.\n\nAl-Soby’s personal connection to vision impairment through her sister and a colleague’s visually impaired grandfather further fueled their commitment.\n\nOur group was driven by the desire to make a positive change using the skills we’ve developed and the knowledge we’ve gained.\n\nRaneem Al-Soby, Prince Sultan University student\n\nThe process of designing Percevo was meticulous, the team said. They started off with extensive research on existing technologies and looked at the common challenges faced by visually impaired individuals.\n\nThey created diagrams and built virtual circuits to ensure compatibility of physical components. Understanding the importance of comfort, they designed an ergonomic bent handle for natural wrist movement.\n\nThe entire project, from system design to a working prototype, took about three months to develop.\n\nTheir efforts paid off when Percevo won the first prize at the CCIS Expo at Prince Sultan University and was showcased at LEAP 2024, which Al-Soby said was “a validation of our hard work and dedication.”\n\nAl-Soby added: “We wanted to develop a device that’s not only functional but also accessible and affordable for those who need it the most.”\n\nPercevo uses a discreet camera and sensors to provide spatial awareness, recognizing objects and locations in real time. The camera detects and comprehends objects and conveys the information to the user through voice prompts, creating an experience akin to having a constant companion. It achieves this through the use of a microcomputer and artificial intelligence algorithms for identification.\n\nAl-Soby said: “As we developed Percevo we made sure to incorporate sustainable practices. Using eco-friendly materials and rechargeable batteries was a crucial part of our design philosophy.”\n\nPercevo is also designed as an attachment to the classic white cane, allowing users to upgrade without discarding their existing cane. This approach not only promotes eco-consciousness but also ensures ease of use and cost-effectiveness for users.\n\nThe students plan to expand their dataset for better object detection and will involve end users through surveys and feedback channels.\n\n“We’re dedicated to continuous improvement,” Al-Soby said.\n\nThe students’ development of Percevo showcases the remarkable potential of young innovators in Saudi Arabia, who are committed to making a difference through enhancing lives and promoting inclusivity."
