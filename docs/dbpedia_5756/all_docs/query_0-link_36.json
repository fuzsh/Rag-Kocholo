Messi's honest admission comes when he is the final stretch of his incredible career where it wouldn't be a hyperbole to suggest that he is perhaps the greatest of all time.\n\nMessi, who turned 37 on Monday (Jun 24), is currently competing in Copa America to defend the title Argentina won four years ago in Brazil.\n\n\"It's very clear to me that I was born like this because God chose me. It was a gift he gave me. I tried to take advantage of it, I did everything possible to squeeze the most out of it,\" Messi told Argentina podcaster Juan Pablo Varsky.\n\n\"The truth is, although I did many things, I did nothing to become the player that I already was when I was little,\" he added.\n\nAlso read | 'We shouldn’t...': Lionel Messi on 'confusion' brought by Pep Guardiola's playing style\n\nMessi, born and brought up in Argentina's Rosario, Santa Fe, started playing football at an early age. He joined his home club Newell's Old Boys before moving to Spain to join Barcelona's youth team at the mere age of 13. Messi admitted he was not aware of how just how special he was.\n\n“From what was being said, I was always different. People came to watch me. I didn't realise it, but I began to understand that as I grew older. I don't really know the moment when I realised it,\" said Messi.\n\n\"When I was three or four years old, I was not aware of the World Cup and all the titles that were being played. I simply played because I loved the ball... it was my hobby. I spent all the time kicking [the ball] and looking for someone to play with. I was born with it. I loved soccer, like most Argentines, from a very young age. I always tried to have fun, like I did from day one.”\n\nWatch | Gravitas recall: Football star Messi born on this day in 1987\n\nMessi has won everything there is to win in football, both at the club and international level. His crowing moment arrived in 2022 when La Albiceleste lifted the FIFA World Cup trophy in Qatar, beating France on penalties in the final.\n\nMessi was the point of difference throughout the tournament and carried Argentina over the finish line. Although his legacy had long been cemented prior to the tournament, the trophy added glitter to his already shimmering career."
