        "text": "Brief biography of Lionel Messi: childhood, club and international career, personal life and rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nName: Lionel Messi\n\nDate of birth: June 24, 1987 (age 36)\n\nPlace of birth: Rosario, Argentina\n\nHeight: 169 cm\n\nWeight: 67 kg\n\nMarital status: Married\n\nChildhood and early career\n\nLeo Messi was born on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina. Leo’s father was an ordinary worker at a steel plant, and his mother worked part-time as a cleaner. Leo has two older brothers, Rodrigo and Matias, and a sister Maria Sol. Lionel Messi has Italian and Catalan roots.\n\nMessi started playing football at the age of five at the amateur club Grandoli, where he was brought by his grandmother. No one else in the family supported Leo’s interest in football.\n\nLeo spent two years at Grandoli, where the team’s coach first compared him to Diego Maradona. Messi preferred to decide the outcome alone, ignoring his teammates.\n\nClub career: 18 years at Barça, leaving for PSG and leaving for MLS\n\nNewells Old Boys\n\nAt the age of seven, Messi found himself at Newells Old Boys from his native Rosario. Leo played for the youngster born in 1987 and scored over 500 goals in six years with the team.\n\nAt the age of 10, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. The treatment was expensive – 1,000 pesos a month. Leo’s family struggled to cover the cost of therapy and asked for a loan from Newells Old Boys. The club was only able to repay 400 pesos.\n\nBarcelona\n\nOn September 17, 2000, Leo went to Barcelona for a viewing, which was organized by agents from Rosario – Martin Montero and Fabian Soldini. Messi played at the viewing with young boys 15 years old, although he was 13. Sports director of the club, Carles Reschak, was impressed by the game of the Argentine and convinced the management of “Barça” to pay Lionel treatment and move to Catalonia.\n\nLeo successfully played for the youth teams of Barcelona and together with Gerard Pique and Cesc Fabregas received an offer from Arsenal London. Leo refused, and his partners left for Foggy Albion.\n\nAfter playing for youth teams, Barcelona C and Barcelona B, Messi made his official debut for the main team in 2004 in a match against Espanyol. His first goal in La Liga Leo scored against Albacete at the age of 17 years 10 months and 10 days, becoming the youngest player who distinguished himself in the Spanish championship.\n\nLionel Messi spent 18 years at Barcelona and won many team and individual honors. As part of the blue-granate Messi 10 times won the Spanish championship, seven times – the Spanish Cup, four times won the Champions League and three times – the UEFA Super Cup.\n\nRetirement at Paris Saint-Germain\n\nAugust 10, 2021 Lionel Messi officially moved to the French “PSG”. With the club from Paris, the Argentine won the French championship twice, won the Super Cup of the country-2022 and received the seventh Ballon d’Or.\n\nAt the end of the season-2022/23 forward left the French team. In total, the footballer played 75 matches for PSG, scored 32 goals and made 35 assists.\n\nDeparture to Inter Miami\n\nOn July 15, “Inter Miami” announced the transfer of Messi. The 36-year-old footballer signed a contract with the American club until December 31, 2025. July 16 at the stadium “Drive Pink Stadium” in Florida held a presentation of the world champion-2022.\n\nOn the night of July 22, Messi made his debut for Inter Miami in a League Cup group stage match against Cruz Azul (2:1). The striker appeared on the field in the second half of the meeting. In the fourth added minute of the match Messi scored his first goal for the team from a free kick and brought victory to the team from Florida.\n\nInternational career\n\nBefore playing his first game for Argentina’s youth national team, Messi received an offer to play for Spain’s youth team, but rejected it. As part of the Argentine youth Leo managed to win bronze medals at the Youth Championship of South America.\n\nIn the main national team Messi made his debut on August 4, 2005 in a friendly match with Hungary and was removed two minutes after entering the field.\n\nThe first major tournament for Lionel was the 2006 World Cup. In the first match of the tournament Argentina met with the national team of Serbia and Montenegro. Leo came on the field in the 74th minute, scored a goal and made an assist.\n\nIn the national team of Argentina Leo won the Youth World Cup in 2005, the Olympic Games in 2008, the America’s Cup in 2021 and Finalissima – in 2022. In 2014, the Argentines with Messi stopped one step away from winning the World Cup, losing in extra time to Germany.\n\nAt the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Argentina still won the coveted trophy. Messi took part in all seven matches of his team. On his account 7 goals and 3 assists. In the final of the world championship he made a double and realized a shot in a series of 11-meter kicks. As a result, Messi received the prize for the best football player in the world for the second time in his career – before that he was awarded this award at the 2014 World Cup.\n\nAfter the victory in Qatar, Leo said that he was not going to end his international career.\n\nRivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nLionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are considered the best football players of their generation. Leo has seven Golden Balls to his credit, Ronaldo has five. From 2009 to 2018, Messi and Ronaldo played in the Spanish championship and often met on the field face to face in the El Clasico.\n\nThe rivalry between Messi and Ronaldo goes beyond the football field. Popular clothing, watch and motor oil brands are using the powerful rivalry for promotional purposes.\n\nDespite rumors from the press, Messi and Ronaldo have no hatred for each other. The footballers always greet each other warmly during football matches and other events.\n\nPersonal life\n\nLeo Messi is married to Antonella Rocuzzo, with whom they have known since childhood. The couple has three sons, Tiago, Mateo and Ciro. Leo and Antonella have been in a relationship since 2008, but they did not get married until nine years later – on June 30, 2017.\n\nLionel Messi today\n\nIn 2023, Lionel Messi turned 36 years old. He plays for the American “Inter Miami” and the national team of Argentina, with which he won the World Cup-2022 in Qatar on December 18, 2022."
