        "text": "First Years (2004-2008)\n\nMessi was promoted to the senior squad as a teenager and made his first team debut at only 17 years old, becoming the then youngest player to don the FC Barcelona uniform.Â\n\nMessi played his first official match for the club on October 16, 2004, coming on for Deco in the 82nd minute of a LaLiga fixture against Espanyol. That season, Messi also became the youngest goal scorer in the history of the Spanish top-flight.\n\nâ\n\nA Big Decision: Argentina or Spain?\n\nMessiâs progress at the Catalan outfit caught the eye of the Spanish national team, which tried to convince him to represent its youth teams. Messi, who had been given Spanish citizenship, declined the offer as he remained attached to his Argentine roots.\n\nâ\n\nNightmare International Debut\n\nHaving helped La Albiceleste win the U-20 World Cup, Messi made his senior international debut for Argentina in a friendly match on August 17, 2005âbut nothing went according to plan. Only 43 seconds after coming on in the second half against Hungary, the 18-year-old Messi saw the red card for elbowing a rival in his neck while running towards the goal.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nFirst World Cup (2006)\n\nHowever, Messi managed to leave that behind and went on to be part of the Argentina roster for the 2006 World Cup, where he became the youngest Argentine player to play and score in FIFAâs flagship competition. His first goal in a World Cup came in a 5-0 victory against Serbia and Montenegro in the group stage. Argentina was eliminated by Germany in the quarterfinals, and people still question Jose Pekermanâs decision not to field Messi that day.\n\nâ\n\nOlympic Success (2008)\n\nBut from then on, Messi became a regular starter in the national team. Following a painful defeat in the 2007 Copa America final, the rising Barcelona star led his country to an Olympic gold medal in Beijing 2008. After the Summer Olympics, Messiâs club career reached new heights.\n\nâ\n\nRise To Stardom (2009)\n\nThough Messi was part of the Barcelona roster that won the double in the 2005-06 season and established himself as starter in the next two years, his breakout season came in the 2008-09 campaign. With Ronaldinho gone, Messi emerged as the new superstar of Barcelona.\n\nThat year, Messi took his game to the next level by helping Barcelona secure the first âtrebleâ in club history. That means winning the best three tournaments at stake: UEFA Champions League, LaLiga, and Copa del Rey. The treble-winning team led by Pep Guardiola is widely considered as the best team of all time, and Leo played a pivotal role in its success.\n\nâ\n\nSextuple Year, First Ballon dâOr\n\nWith nine goals in 12 Champions League games (including the game-winner in the final against Manchester United), 23 goals in 31 league matches and six in eight Copa del Rey affairs, Messi made a strong case to win the first Ballon dâOr in his career.Â\n\nOn top of that, Barca ended up securing the first sextuple in soccer history: Champions League, LaLiga, Copa del Rey, FIFA Club World Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and Spanish Super Cup. However, the best was yet to come.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nMaking The History Books (2012)\n\n2012 was a historic, record-breaking year for Messi. After becoming the first player to score five goals in a single Champions League game, Messi surpassed Cesar Rodriguez (232 goals) as Barcelonaâs all-time leading scorer scoring a hat trick against Granada.Â\n\nOn top of that, he also broke Gerd Mullerâs 39-year record of 85 goals in a calendar year (1972), recording 91 goals in 2012. Far from being jealous, Muller said: \"My record stood for 40 yearsâ85 goals in 60 gamesâand now the best player in the world has broken it, and I'm delighted for him. He is an incredible player, gigantic.\"\n\nNeedless to say, that wonderful year earned Messi his fourth consecutive Ballon dâOr award, becoming the first player in history to win the prize on four occasions.\n\nâ\n\nTough Years with the National Team (2010-2018)\n\nWhile Messi enjoyed worldwide recognition for his fantastic performances at FC Barcelona, he didnât get the same kind of love in his home country. Though many Argentine fans admired Leo, his lack of success with the national team while he thrived in Spain made him a subject of criticism by the local media. In addition, he was also constantly compared with Diego Maradona.\n\nTo be fair, no other team could match what Barcelona did under Pep Guardiola. Regardless, Messi was made a scapegoat for Argentinaâs failures in those years. He had blossomed as a Ballon dâOr player at Barcelona, but he couldnât carry his level to the international stage.\n\nâ\n\n2010 World Cup\n\nThe 2010 World Cup in South Africa was the first big blow in Messiâs international career. Not only was Argentina destroyed by Germany in the quarterfinals, but Messi ended the tournament without scoring a single goal. The team didnât arrive to that competition in a good spot, but the expectations around Messi were still much higher.\n\nâ\n\n2011 Copa America\n\nThings only got worse in the 2011 Copa America. Despite being the host country, Argentina left a lot to be desired by losing in the quarterfinals against Uruguay. That tournament was particularly harsh for Messi, who was whistled by the home crowd as he finished the tournament goalless.\n\nâ\n\n2014 World Cup\n\nHis image started to improve on the road to Brazil 2014, getting on the scoresheet from the very first game and putting the team on his back en route to the World Cup final. However, Argentinaâs heartbreaking loss to Germany meant that Messi had yet to silence his haters, even though he won the Golden Ball awardâgiven to the player of the tournament.\n\nâ\n\n2015 Copa America\n\nDespite the progress made in that World Cup, Messi had once again taken many steps back in his relationship with Argentinian fans and media. International glory continued to elude Messi in the 2015 Copa America, when his side lost to Chile in the final. But Messi hit rock bottom the following year.\n\nâ\n\nCopa America Centenario (2016)\n\nHaving shone throughout the Copa America Centenarioâheld in the US in 2016 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the competitionâit looked like Messiâs first piece of silverware with the Argentina national team was inevitable. But once again, Argentina finished runner-up as Chile stood on its way. This time it was even more traumatic for Messi, who missed his spot-kick in the penalty shootout.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nA devastated Messi was seen crying after the loss, as his and Argentinaâs wait for an international success extended. Having reached his lowest point since playing for his country, Messi said postgame he would quit the national team. The haters were still there, and their comments were even louder after that final, but many Argentinians were in shock as they saw their idol at an all-time low.Â\n\nFortunately, Messi changed his mind a few months later. That doesnât mean that things became easier, though.\n\nâ\n\nTroubled Road to Russia 2018\n\nArgentina struggled on their way to the 2018 World Cup. The soccer federation went through significant changes in its hierarchy, while the team had three different coaches throughout the qualifiers. In the end, Argentina clinched a spot in Russia thanks to a hat trick from Messi in the final round.\n\nâ\n\nDisappointing World Cup\n\nArgentina didnât arrive in Russia in high spirits, and it proved costly. Messi missed a penalty in a 1-1 draw against Iceland, which was followed by an ugly loss to Croatia. The Barcelona star helped his side beat Nigeria to avoid a group stage exit, but Argentina then lost to eventual champions France.Â\n\nThis time, the blame didnât fall on Messi, as Jorge Sampaoli did a terrible job as head coach. Still, it was yet another sour World Cup for the best player on Earth. In all those years, Messi had better luck at Barcelonaâbut soon he would experience bad times there as well.\n\nâ\n\nLast Successful Years with Barcelona\n\n2013 was complicated for Messi. The soccer machine spent months on the sidelines with hamstring injuries but found a way to come back stronger, becoming the all-time top scorer in both La Liga and Champions League in 2014.\n\nThe 2014-15 was the last great season for Messi and Barcelona, as the club repeated the treble that year with a powerful offensive trio of striker Luis Suarez, Messi and Neymar. Additionally, the Argentine footballer regained the FIFA Ballon dâOr after losing to Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013 and 2014.Â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nBarcelona Goes Downhill (2018-2020)\n\nBarcelona went through a tough period from 2018 to 2020, suffering humiliating Champions League eliminations in consecutive years. Roma, Liverpool, and Bayern have all handed Barca painful defeats, preventing them from making the final.\n\nOn top of that, the club started to experience financial problems with Josep Maria Bartomeuâs board. All those woes combined almost drove Messi away from Barcelona. The Argentine footballer looked ready to leave in 2020 as a free agent, but it turned out that his contract didnât allow it.Â\n\nâ\n\nBarcelona Farewell (2021)\n\nMessi had no option but to stay for the 2020-21 season, his toughest year at the club. Once again, Leo was one of the few bright spots of the team but it was still a lackluster campaign as Barca was demolished by PSG in the Champions League and finished third in LaLiga.\n\nMessi had entered the final year of his contract, but his mood had changed as Bartomeu left. Joan Laporta won the elections and, even with all the financial problems that struck the club, the outlook was much better. Therefore, though Messi became a free agent at the end of the season, he looked ready to re-sign.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHowever, in a shocking turn of events, the club told Messi he couldnât be registered in LaLiga due to salary cap rules. And just like that, Messi left. Ironically, while he went through the hardest days at Barcelona, Messi finally found happiness with Argentina.\n\nâ\n\nRedemption with Argentina (2019-2022)\n\nIt took a long time, but Messi changed the narrative with the Argentine national team. A mature Leo had emerged as the face of the teamâs reconstruction under Lionel Scaloni after the 2018 World Cup. The team finished third in the 2019 Copa America, and from then on, there was no turning back.\n\nArgentina strengthened itself in South America, getting off to a positive start to the Qualifiers. A new generation of players had come and Messi started to feel more comfortable with them. Eventually, Argentina started to string good results together and it proved a point in the 2021 Copa America.\n\nâ\n\n2021 Copa America Triumph\n\nMessiâs wait for an elusive international title came to an end in epic fashion, with Argentina beating rivals and host country Brazil in the final at the Maracana. La Albiceleste ended a 28-year drought, and Messi achieved his first major success with the senior national team.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nSince then, Messi has received nothing but love from the Argentine community. Besides, he continued to lead the team en route to a Qatar 2022 berth and a memorable Finalissima trophy.Â\n\nâ\n\nQatar 2022: The Wait Comes to an End\n\nAt Qatar 2022, the inevitable finally happened: Lionel Messi got his hands on the coveted FIFA World Cup trophy. In one of the best performances ever seen in tournament history, the 35-year-old broke all kinds of records to emulate Maradona and take Argentina back to the promised land. For many, the GOAT debate should no longer exist: with this title, Messi is widely regarded as the best soccer player ever.\n\nâ\n\nA New Adventure in Paris (2021)\n\nWhile enjoying the best moment in his international career, Messi had to make a big decision: Barcelona was no longer his club, and he had many offers on the table. In the end, Lionel signed a two-year deal with Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2021."
