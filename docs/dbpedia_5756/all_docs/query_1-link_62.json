        "text": "Lionel Agustín Ahumada is only 4 years old, but in his first name, he carries a story of a legend that will accompany him forever.\n\nStaring at his chicken nuggets, with green slime flowing through his hands, a spiky haircut, and wearing an Argentina national team shirt, Lionel listened attentively to his father, who became obsessed with naming his first son after the greatest soccer player of recent times.\n\n“I adore Lionel Messi,” said Mauro Ahumada, a 32-year-old Argentine real estate agent in Dallas who has plans to attend the friendly between FC Dallas and Messi’s team, Inter Miami CF, on Monday at the Cotton Bowl.\n\nRelated:FC Dallas will face Messi and Inter Miami CF in a preseason match at the Cotton Bowl\n\nMessi created great expectations when he appeared at the Toyota Stadium in Frisco in August to play against FC Dallas in the round of 16 of the League Cup with Inter Miami.\n\nThe presence of the legendary “10″ caused ticket prices to reach unusual levels, going for more than $600.\n\nToyota Stadium, with a capacity of 20,500 fans, was too small a venue to satisfy the expectations of fans eager to witness Messi’s first road match in the U.S.\n\nIn that game, Messi had two goals for Miami and scored again in a dramatic penalty shootout for the win.\n\nThe 36-year-old lived his golden era during the 17 seasons he played for Barcelona in Spain before moving to Paris Saint-Germain, France’s top club, where he played from 2021 to 2023.\n\nFor Monday’s game at the Cotton Bowl, ticket prices start at $77, according to vividseats.com.\n\nWhen Mauro found out that his wife was expecting a baby boy, he convinced her to name him Lionel.\n\n“It wasn’t easy, I had to negotiate hard with my wife,” said Mauro, who also has a 2-year-old daughter named Tessa.\n\nMauro convinced his wife to name his son Lionel; in exchange for that, Mauro accepted Agustín as his baby boy’s middle name, the preferred name of his wife.\n\nLionel is a rare name in the Spanish vocabulary because the Castilianized name is Leonel.\n\nIn the case of Messi, the player’s mother told the Argentine newspaper La Capital that she decided to name her son Lionel because when she was pregnant, she became a fan of singer Lionel Richie, who at that time was very popular for the song “Say You, Say Me.”\n\n“I didn’t want to name our son Lionel because I don’t like it when you pronounce it in English,” said Mauro’s wife, Rebekah, 25. “I wanted a name that everyone at my son’s school could pronounce correctly.”\n\nUltimately, Rebekah, born in Dallas, agreed to name her son after the captain of the Argentina national team.\n\n“I knew that naming our son after Messi was something big for my husband, something he wanted badly, so I gave in. After all, Lionel, it’s a nice name,” Rebekah said.\n\nA familiar name\n\nIn Argentina, naming children after Lionel Messi has become common.\n\nAccording to the Civil Registry of the province of Santa Fe, one in 70 babies born in December 2022 was registered with the name Lionel or Lionela (for girls) after Argentina won the World Cup.\n\nThat’s an increase of 700% compared to the previous monthly data available for baby names in the province that encompasses Rosario, the Argentinian city where Messi was born.\n\n“For Argentina, Messi is a hero,” said Matías Mato, an Argentine who lives in Dallas and named his 17-month-old son Lionel Anthony.\n\n“I watched the World Cup matches on television with Lionel in my arms. He was barely 5 months old, but I used to tell him, ‘Look, you are named Lionel because of him’”, said Matias.\n\nMatias, born in 1986, the year Argentina won the World Cup with Deigo Maradona, said that naming his son after Messi is a testament to his fervent admiration for the soccer star.\n\n“For us, soccer is everything, it’s a culture, it’s a religion,” said the dog show trainer, who paid $600 for a ticket when Messi came to play against FC Dallas in the Leagues Cup last summer.\n\n“Messi is the greatest thing that happened to our generation, and that’s why my son is named after him,” Matias said.\n\nIn the United States, an estimated population of 23,017 is named Lionel.\n\nThe race and Hispanic origin distribution of the people with the name Lionel is 60.4% White, 18.8% Hispanic origin, 16.1% Black, 2.2% Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.9% two or more races, and 0.7% American Indian or Alaskan Native, according to MyNameStats.com.\n\nThere are 7.2 people named Lionel for every 100,000 Americans.\n\nLionel has been used in the United States since 1880, with over 31,610 boys given the name in the past 200 years.\n\nFor the Argentinian people, the meaning of the name Lionel goes far beyond statistics.\n\n“When Argentina won the World Cup, I was in shock, I couldn’t believe it. It was an incredible moment of joy I was able to share with Lionel in my arms,” Mauro said with tears in his eyes while remembering the moment.\n\n“I’m a lucky man, I have a wife who supports and shares my passion for soccer and my adoration for Messi.”\n\nTwitter: @abrahamrussek"
