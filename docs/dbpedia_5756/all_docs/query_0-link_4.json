You have to sacrifice and work hard for it.\n\nYou have to show up in the World Cup, and in the World Cup anything can happen.\n\nI always thought I wanted to play professionally, and I always knew that to do that I’d have to make a lot of sacrifices. I made sacrifices by leaving Argentina, leaving my family to start a new life. I changed my friends, my people. Everything. But everything I did, I did for football, to achieve my dream.\n\nI prefer to win titles with the team ahead of individual awards or scoring more goals than anyone else. I’m more worried about being a good person than being the best football player in the world. When all this is over, what are you left with? When I retire, I hope I am remembered for being a decent guy.\n\nWhat I do is play soccer, which is what I like.\n\nI repeat what I always say: I want the best for Argentina in every way. I never try to make trouble for anybody.\n\nThere’s nothing more satisfying than seeing a happy and smiling child. I always help in any way I can, even if it’s just by signing an autograph. A child’s smile is worth more than all the money in the world.\n\nI’m lucky to be part of a team who help to make me look good, and they deserve as much of the credit for my success as I do for the hard work we have all put in on the training ground.\n\nThe day you think there is no improvements to be made is a sad one for any player.\n\nI have fun like a child in the street. When the day comes when I’m not enjoying it, I will leave football.\n\nI want to concentrate on winning things with Barcelona and Argentina. Then if people want to say nice things about me when I have retired, great. Right now, I need to concentrate on being part of a team — not just on me.\n\nI have many years to get better and better, and that has to be my ambition. The day you think there is no improvements to be made is a sad one for any player.\n\nThe truth is my idea has been to always stay at Barcelona and see out the rest of my career here. Like I always say, one doesn’t know what can happen in the future, but if it were up to me to decide, I would stay at Barcelona for the rest of my career.\n\nIt’s scoring goals that’s great, whether against Brazil or anybody else.\n\nBeing named among the best at something is special and beautiful. But if there are no titles, nothing is won.\n\nMoney is not a motivating factor. Money doesn’t thrill me or make me play better because there are benefits to being wealthy. I’m just happy with a ball at my feet. My motivation comes from playing the game I love. If I wasn’t paid to be a professional footballer I would willingly play for nothing.\n\nThe truth is that I don’t have a favourite goal. I remember important goals more than I do favourite goals, like goals in the Champions League where I had the opportunity to have scored in both finals I have played in. Finals in the World Cup or Copa del Rey are the ones that have stayed with me for longer or that I remember more.\n\nIn football as in watchmaking, talent and elegance mean nothing without rigour and precision.\n\nIt seems like people want to blame me for everything. Whenever any issue arises, I’m said to have been involved even if I’ve had nothing to do with it. That’s why I always focus on what I know, which is playing football, and try to be very careful with what I say because people always try and twist things.\n\nLike I’ve said many times before, I’m always more likely to remember goals for their importance rather than if they’re beautiful or not. Goals scored in finals, for example.\n\nYou cannot allow your desire to be a winner to be diminished by achieving success before and I believe there is room for improvement in every sportsman.\n\nI am competitive and I feel bad when we lose. You can see it in me when we’ve lost. I’m in a bad way. I don’t like to talk to anyone.\n\nWhen the year starts the objective is to win it all with the team, personal records are secondary.\n\nFor my part, I try to do my bit to make people’s lives more bearable, in particular children across the globe who are having problems.\n\nI’ve never stopped being Argentine, and I’ve never wanted to. I feel very proud of being Argentine, even though I left there. I’ve been clear about this since I was very young, and I never wanted to change. Barcelona is my home because both the club and the people here have given me everything, but I won’t stop being Argentine.\n\nOn a personal note, I think it won’t be until after I’ve retired that I’m fully aware of what I’ve done or what I’ve gone on to achieve in my career.\n\nI’ve never stopped being Argentine, and I’ve never wanted to. I feel very proud of being Argentine, even though I left there. I’ve been clear about this since I was very young, and I never wanted to change.\n\nI’ve always really just liked football, and I’ve always devoted a lot of time to it. When I was a kid, my friends would call me to go out with them, but I would stay home because I had practice the next day.\n\nWe will not take Arsenal lightly for one minute, as they showed in the two matches against us last season that they can be dangerous opponents if we lose our concentration for a moment.\n\nToday I am the happiest man in the world, my son was born and thanks to God for this gift.\n\nEvery year I try to grow as a player and not get stuck in a rut. I try to improve my game in every way possible. But that trait is not something I’ve worked on, it’s part of me.\n\nI never think about the play or visualize anything. I do what comes to me at that moment. Instinct. It has always been that way.\n\nWhether it’s a friendly match, or for points, or a final, or any game — I play the same. I’m always trying to be my best, first for my team, for myself, for the fans, and to try and win.\n\nNah, I’ve always had a great relationship with my two brothers, I have always had their support in my football and in everything. They’ve been very close to me and we have a great relationship.\n\nIt’s not so easy for us when we play teams who have a different mindset, like Chelsea or Inter Milan, because they have the intention of trying to stop us rather than playing a game that is more attractive for the spectators to enjoy.\n\nI’ve always really just liked football, and I’ve always devoted a lot of time to it. When I was a kid, my friends would call me to go out with them, but I would stay home because I had practice the next day. I like going out, but you have to know when you can and when you can’t."
