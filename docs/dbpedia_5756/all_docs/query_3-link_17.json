        "text": "Lionel Andr√©s Messi is one of the best football players of the modern times. He was born in 1987 in Rosario, Argentina, in a crowded family of amateur football team coach and a social worker. It was Leo's grandma who managed to recognize his talent as a future soccer star, so she brought him to his first training sessions when he was only 5 years old. Later on, however, the boy was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency, so the local youth teams did not want to sign him up. Thus, he tried his chance with Barcelona and managed to obtain a place in its youth team. In his first game for Barcelona youth team, Leo scored 3 goals. He started playing for Argentinean national team when he was only 17 years old, and he showed amazing results. He received his first The Golden Ball Award in 2005, and he became famous for receiving this award for 4 consequent times, from 2009 to 2012. Lionel Messi is the only player who managed to score 5 goals in one game in the Champions League, and the youngest player to score 200 goals in Spanish La Liga. In the early 2020s, he was the captain of Argentinean National Team and FC Barcelona, and in 2023 he continued his career in the USA as a player of Miami Inter. He is married to Antonella Roccuzzo and the couple has two sons, Thiago and Mateo."
