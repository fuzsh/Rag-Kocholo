        "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami debut.\n\nHoracio Gaggioli waited at Barcelona’s El Prat Airport. His business partners in Buenos Aires were on a flight heading his way, along with a 13-year-old boy named Lionel Messi and his father, Jorge.\n\nA year earlier, Gaggioli had been sent a video tape of Lionel playing for the youth teams of Argentinian soccer club Newell’s Old Boys. Today, those grainy highlights have been seen by millions on YouTube but, more than 20 years ago, Messi’s mesmerizing skills as a child were unknown to anybody outside of his home town Rosario.\n\nGaggioli, an Argentinian player agent, was now serving as an intermediary between his partners in Argentina, who had discovered Messi, and FC Barcelona, a reluctant European suitor. It was September of 2000 and Messi had arrived for a two-week trial with the Catalan club.\n\n“When those of us who lived in Barcelona saw Messi’s videos, we were very surprised by what the kid could do,” Gaggioli tells The Athletic from his home in Andorra. “We knew right away that he was a different type of player.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nInside the Lionel Messi to Inter Miami deal — seeing off Saudis, equity offers and Beckham and Co.'s secret trip\n\nBut what Gaggioli saw on video contrasted with his first impressions of Messi in person. Gaggioli knew that Messi had been seen by a pediatric endocrinologist (a glands and hormones specialist) in Argentina. He knew the young Messi had growth issues and that a club willing to sign him would have to pay for his expensive growth hormone treatment.\n\nNonetheless, when Gaggioli saw Messi for the first time at the airport, he thought he had made a terrible mistake.\n\n“I thought I had been duped,” Gaggioli says. “I thought to myself: ‘This small child can’t play football. He’s tiny. His leg looked like a finger. They’re going to break this kid’s legs.’\n\n“But the next day he began to train with Barca’s youth team and he was an absolute footballing machine. He was unstoppable. He was far and away better than the other kids. By a lot.”\n\nWhere did this kid come from? And why had Newell’s Old Boys let him leave Argentina so quickly?\n\nThis is Messi: The Early Years, the first in a special series marking the arrival in the U.S. of probably the greatest soccer player of all time.\n\nDrive through the streets of Rosario, about a four-hour drive north-west of Argentina’s capital Buenos Aires, and you’ll see dozens of murals that honor Messi. He has been immortalized in the city, drawn colorfully as the captain of the national team, or as a child in a Newell’s shirt.\n\nMessi never played professionally for Newell’s. And yet, to this day, he is as revered as one of the club’s historic greats.\n\nLocated in Santa Fe, Rosario is the largest city in the province with a well-established reputation for its focus on arts and education. Rosario is also a major point of interest in Argentina’s national history. It was here, in 1812, where the Argentine flag was flown for the first time before a battalion of soldiers.\n\nIn the modern day, Rosario is a bustling city. Taxis and motorcycle messengers weave through the city’s streets. In Rosario, like so many cities in South America, colonial architecture mingles with contemporary buildings and businesses.\n\nOf course, Rosario is also known for its deeply-rooted history in football. A bitter, hostile rivalry between Newell’s and Rosario Central divides the city’s loyalties.\n\nRosario is also the birthplace of the legendary Marcelo Bielsa, the coach who later discovered Argentine legend Gabriel Batistuta and new Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino. In the 1980s, Bielsa and Jorge Griffa, his mentor, scouted the region for talented players and recruited them to Newell’s.\n\nThey established Newell’s as a hotbed for elite young players. Names such as Abel Balbo, Roberto Sensini, and Gerardo ‘Tata’ Martino would later lead Newell’s to Primera Division titles in 1988, 1990 and again in 1992.\n\nNewell’s supporters boast that their club is like no other. The club’s history can be traced back to 1853 when founder Isaac Newell was born in England. He moved to Rosario as a teenager and later became a teacher and founded a school where the club sits today.\n\n“He taught his students how to play football in the school’s yards. He brought established rules and a leather ball from England to Argentina,” says Nicolas Bloj, a Rosario-based attorney who is as much a fan as he is a Newell’s historian.\n\nIn 1903, a group of Newell’s former students created a sports club and named the institution after their former teacher. Club Atletico Newell’s Old Boys was officially born.\n\n“What we’re most proud of and what makes us different is that our club was founded on the basic fundamentals of education and ethics, which are different values than other clubs in Argentina,” Bloj says. “Newell’s is a way of life. It’s a school for life. And there’s a unique sense of belonging that the players and the fans have with the club.”\n\nBloj enthusiastically recalls when the club was facing relegation in 2012. Martino had a written offer to coach Colombia’s national team, following his success with Paraguay at the 2010 World Cup. Instead, he returned to his hometown, along with a handful of European-based players.\n\nFormer Manchester United, Real Madrid and Argentina national team defender Gabriel Heinze left Roma and ended his career in Europe to play under Martino. Heinze began his playing at Newell’s before he left for Spanish club Valladolid as a 19-year-old. Former Newell’s academy products Ignacio Scocco and Maxi Rodriguez also returned from Saudi Arabia and Liverpool, respectively to help rescue Newell’s.\n\nRodriguez was born in Rosario and made his Newell’s debut as an 18-year-old in 1999. Scocco, like Heinze, first played for Newell’s in Argentina’s Primera Division at age 19. Heinze, Rodriguez and Scocco joined Lucas Bernardi, who had left Newell’s in 2000 for Europe, but returned eight years later after enjoying French football on the pristine shores of Monaco.\n\nThe side staved off relegation that season and were crowned champions a year later. That 2013 Newell’s team became instant legends, their place in Newell’s lore etched in stone. While the Newell’s faithful celebrated that title, Messi, then 26 years old, had already won his fourth consecutive Ballon d’Or with Barcelona.\n\nIn Rosario, his success in Europe, and his rapid progression from the Argentina Under-20 national team to the senior side, made Messi more than just a local hero.\n\n“For Newell’s, Leo is both a point of pride and a symbol of hope,” says Ariel Senosiain, a football commentator for TyC Sports in Buenos Aires. “People at Newell’s are incredibly proud of the fact that Messi was at the club as a small child. There’s hope that someday he’ll return.”\n\nSenosiain is also from Rosario. And, although he remains objective for professional purposes, he’s also a die-hard Newell’s supporter.\n\n“Rosario is a city that prospers on its own,” he says. “It doesn’t need help from Buenos Aires. It’s a beautiful city. It’s a complete city. It’s a passionate city and if we’re talking about football, no city is more passionate.”\n\nSenosiain is the author of Messi El Genio Completo (The Complete Genius), a book published in 2021 that chronicles Messi’s career from childhood to the improbable, when Messi won the Copa America title two summers ago.\n\n“Even though Messi played only for the youth sides and not for the academy, he’s still an important figure at Newell’s,” says Senosiain. “The videos of his goals, with the dribbling skills that he later displayed as a professional, that alone creates an immense sense of pride.”\n\nBefore Messi took that flight to Barcelona, he was a member of the Newell’s football school for children called Malvinas. It’s a young player’s first stop at Newell’s before progressing to the youth academy.\n\nAfter the Falklands War, fought between Argentina and Britain from April to June of 1982, streets and different establishments throughout the country took on the name of the islands. Argentina’s military suffered a reported 650 casualties and ultimately surrendered the islands — known in Argentina as Malvinas.\n\nOne would expect that Messi, who as a child could consistently and quite easily slalom past an entire team of defenders on a dirt pitch, would immediately be compared to Diego Maradona. Messi, of course, would later play with the shadow of Maradona hanging over him, but in Rosario, he was simply an impressive young football player.\n\nIn that sense, Messi and Maradona had more in common at that age than many would’ve thought possible.\n\n“The whole of Argentina didn’t know who Maradona was either when he was playing at that level,” Senosiain says. “There’s that old video of Maradona saying that his dream was to play for the national team. Word began to spread among those who watched Maradona play regularly at the academy level. There was a lot of anticipation that a future star was going to make his debut.\n\n“Messi was much younger,” Senosiain continues. “Those youth divisions always had at least one phenom, but no one knew how good he was going to be. Messi was only 11, 12 years old.”\n\nThat changed as Messi continued to dazzle. Word spread around Rosario about Messi. Newell’s fans who attend academy games to watch the team’s future homegrown players began to watch Messi. They sat alongside the family members of Messi’s teammates and cheered proudly.\n\nThere was no doubting Messi’s incredible skill, but his compact build and skinny legs tempered expectations.\n\nAdrian Coria coached Messi at Malvinas. He would later join Martino’s staff at Barcelona and then Argentina, coaching Messi again with both. In 2020, Coria told TyC Sports that as a child, Messi was already an elite goalscorer and “a winner of clasicos”.\n\n“I met him in 1998 when he was doing what he does with Barcelona, taking the ball from the right-hand side and finishing with his left at the far post,” Coria says. “His skills were brilliant.”\n\n“People were astonished by Messi’s skills, but he was very little,” adds Senosiain. “At that time he had been seen by an endocrinologist, the doctor who began to treat him. His Newell’s teammates remember him as an absolute killer. Messi won games for them and titles, but his exploits ended there. They didn’t go beyond Rosario.”\n\nMessi has two older brothers, Rodrigo and Matias, and a younger sister named Maria Sol. His parents Jorge and Celia Maria still live in Rosario. Before they were world-famous, the Messis were a middle-class family. They lived in a modest two-story home located on the Calle Lavalleja, a simple and traditionally residential part of Rosario near the Parana River. Jorge worked as a supervisor at a steel manufacturing plant and Celia worked at a small shop that specialized in magnetic coils.\n\nToday, the former family home looks like an understated shrine to Messi. The home’s previous gated garage is now littered with small Argentine flags. They flutter in the wind next to street art that depicts Messi as a national hero. The home is listed as a historical landmark.\n\nJorge eventually became his son’s agent, and has been at his son’s side from the beginning. But it’s Messi’s late maternal grandmother Celia who is credited with starting it all. Messi loved football as a child, even before he went to Newell’s, but he tended to play on his own or with neighborhood kids.\n\nTo join a club, as most children do, wasn’t something that Messi was interested in.\n\n“His grandmother motivated him to make that jump,” says Senosiain. “That’s why Messi has celebrated every goal that he has scored in his career, which have been more than 800, by pointing both of his index fingers up to the sky. He dedicates all of his goals to his grandmother.”\n\nThose who knew the young Lionel back then refer to him as a quiet boy with exceptional football skills. He was shy, but as a child, Messi was already very cerebral when he had a ball at his feet. During one game against other children from the neighborhood, Messi played with stones he found on the pitch while the game took place around him.\n\nWhen the ball came near him, however, Messi displayed the same deft touch and pacy dribbling that made him an unplayable star at Barcelona. His personality was reserved but he was a natural between the white lines. Messi’s withdrawn personality continued when he arrived in Barcelona.\n\n“He was very introverted,” Gaggioli says. “I represented two other players on Leo’s Barcelona youth team. They would tell me that Messi would sit in a corner inside the dressing room. He wouldn’t talk. He didn’t say a word, but on the pitch he spoke with his left foot.”\n\nMessi’s parents and siblings moved to Barcelona with him in 2001, but according to Senosiain, his sister didn’t adapt well to life in Spain. Shortly thereafter, the family moved back to Rosario. Messi and his father stayed in Barcelona.\n\nFor his book, Senosiain spoke to Messi’s father. It was a rare interview, as Jorge, like his son Lionel, is reserved, in spite of his standing as a globally influential football agent.\n\n“One may think that there’s a certain ease to being the best player in the world’s agent,” Senosiain says. “But it’s also true that there’s a sense of protection that someone like Lionel needs. He never veered far from that nucleus. Messi, today, is still a normal guy despite the fact that the eyes of the world are watching his every move.”\n\nGaggioli worked with Jorge Messi for two years while the Messi family lived in Barcelona. They traveled together to youth tournaments in Italy and throughout Spain. Messi shined and Gaggioli became a close family confidant. Jorge eventually decided to represent his son on his own.\n\n“He let us know and we felt he had the capacity to represent his son. FIFA allows a parent to do that,” says Gaggioli. “Jorge was transparent with us. I always had a very good relationship with him. Everyone then went on different paths, but I was never bothered by his decision. It was a normal decision.”\n\nMessi had impressed during his two-week trial with Barcelona, but the club was uncertain about signing him. On October 1 of 2000, he returned to Rosario with his father and waited for word from Gaggioli. Messi returned to Newell’s and continued to play on his Malvinas team, never missing a beat. The entire month of October went by, then November.\n\nGaggioli’s partners in Argentina reached out and told him that they wouldn’t wait for Barcelona any longer. “This is where the road ends, they told me. It was the first week of December, so we decided to schedule another tryout for Messi somewhere else,” says Gaggioli.\n\nIn early December, Gaggioli called Barcelona sporting director Carles Rexach for one final push. If Rexach would’ve passed on Messi during that phone call, Gaggioli was prepared to reach out to Real Madrid to schedule a trial.\n\n“I would’ve gone to another big club that could relocate an entire family. A small club couldn’t do that. We considered Real Madrid, but it didn’t get to that point.”\n\nIt came very close, though. Barcelona’s chief decision makers were split on signing Messi. Some club executives were too concerned about his growth issues.\n\n“More than one person at the club said: ‘If this kid is sick, why would we sign him?’” says Gaggioli.\n\nGaggioli and his partners were transparent with Barcelona. They presented Messi’s diagnosis and the treatment that was required. Barcelona would have to pay it, as Newell’s had opted not to.\n\nRexach invited Gaggioli to dinner in Barcelona to make a final decision over Messi. Convinced that Messi was indeed a future star, Rexach grabbed a napkin and wrote the equivalent of a contract between Gaggioli, his Barcelona-based partner Josep Maria Minguella, Barcelona and Lionel Messi.\n\n“In Barcelona, on December 14, 2000, and in the presence of the gentleman Minguella and Horacio, Carles Rexach, technical secretary of FCB, commits under his responsibility, despite the opinion of others who are against signing Lionel Messi, as long as the agreed fees are maintained.”\n\n“It’s a marvellous moment,” Gaggioli says. “That napkin broke the deadlock. My lawyers looked at it. The napkin had everything: my name, his name, the date. It’s notarized. It was a legal document. It’ll be a part of me for the rest of my life. The napkin will always be at my side. I live in Andorra and I’ve kept the napkin in a safe inside a bank. After that, everyone knew who Leo Messi was.”\n\nBarcelona agreed to cover Messi’s treatments, as well. A month later, Barcelona sent a letter to the Messi family. They were expected in Barcelona later that month.\n\n“It was easy to convince the Messi family to move to Europe when Newell’s wouldn’t even pay for his treatments,” Gaggioli says. “They missed out on an incredible diamond.”\n\nMessi is celebrated in Rosario — his image can be seen painted on walls all over town — but his departure from Newell’s is a moment in the club’s history that many in the city wish could be rewritten. Coria, Messi’s youth coach, called it “a blow” when Messi left for Barcelona. It worked out in Messi’s favor, he said, but the club would’ve liked to have seen him make his professional debut in Argentina.\n\nBloj, for his part, says that for decades, Newell’s fans felt indebted to Messi. When he was a boy in Rosario, Messi wasn’t viewed as the symbol of hope that he has become. He was there at the club, then he wasn’t. For Newell’s supporters, their connection to Messi felt more like a long-distance relationship. A childhood sweetheart who ended up with someone else.\n\n“He was a complete unknown. That’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Bloj says. “We didn’t know who he was. We knew there was a kid from Rosario who had gone to Barcelona. And after that, the Newell’s faithful felt very proud of Messi, and we at Newell’s protect our own.”\n\nAnd when the country turned on Messi after the missed opportunities with the national team, or when he couldn’t replicate his Barcelona form with Argentina, Newell’s was there to defend him. Banners and flags honored him and songs sung in support of Messi at The Estadio Marcelo Bielsa, where Newell’s plays. He had never stepped on the pitch, but that ground was his home.\n\nAs Rosario grapples with historically high rates of crime, homicides and narco violence, Messi became a World Cup champion. He keeps a home in an exclusive part of the city. His appearance at Maxi Rodriguez’s testimonial on June 24, the same day Messi celebrated his 36th birthday, was a day that Rosarinos will never forget. It was the closure they needed.\n\n“He’s one of us and we’ll support him no matter what,” Bloj says. “Messi is a kid from Malvinas who conquered the world. It’s a dream for every child in Rosario. It’s not impossible. You can start here and become the best in the world.”\n\n(Graphics: Sam Richardson, Photography: Getty Images, Sam Lee)"
