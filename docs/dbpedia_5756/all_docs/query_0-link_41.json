He is easily the best player in the world. He is better than Kaka and better than Messi. He is streets ahead of them all. His contribution as a goal threat is unbelievable. His stats are incredible. Strikes at goal, attempts on goal, raids into the penalty box, headers. It is all there. Absolutely astounding.\" - Sir Alex Ferguson, July 2009.\n\n\"Messi is my Maradona,\" - said Maradona himself, as the head coach of the Argentine national team.\n\nRecent News\n\nReferences"
