        "text": "LIONEL Messi might be the most popular football player in the world, but he is unlikely to ever have the most popular name in Argentina.\n\nAccording to Mundo Deportivo, a new law prohibits parents in Messi’s hometown of Rosario from naming their kids after him. The city hopes to avoid “mass confusion”.\n\nThe law was passed after a man in the town of Rio Grande successfully appealed to authorities, who then allowed him to name his son Messi Daniel Varela.\n\nWe fully expect the boy to be nicknamed “Messy Daniel Varela” as soon as he’s old enough to not clean his room.\n\nRosario expected other parents and admirers of the FC Barcelona star to try similar moves, and quickly acted to dash any hopes of there being future “Messis” in town.\n\nThere has been no word yet on how the real Messi feels about the legislation. Stay tuned for that one."
