        "text": "Lionel Messi, the football champion from Rosario, Argentina is known worldwide. Yet, few are aware of the thriving cannabis scene in his hometown. Rosario is a city known for its bustling port, thriving commerce, and vibrant agtech sector. It also has a dedicated community of cannabis breeders and cultivators who have championed knowledge sharing, supported caregivers, made significant social impacts, and won numerous cannabis cup awards for their exceptional work.\n\nRosario: Messi's Roots And Global Impact\n\nLionel Messi, born June 24, 1987, in Rosario, grew up in the working-class neighborhood of La Bajada, Rosario - the largest city in Santa Fe province and the third-most populous in Argentina with a population of 1.75 million people.\n\nLocated on the Paraná River, Rosario is a key hub for agricultural trade with one of the busiest ports in the country, which is supported by a robust agtech sector focused on R&D, logistics, and commodity processing. Culturally rich, the city is home to the National Flag Memorial, showcasing diverse architectural styles from neoclassical to Art Deco.\n\nWhen Messi was eight years old, he joined Newell's Old Boys - a Rosario team in Argentina's A league. At 13, he moved to Barcelona, debuting for FC Barcelona's first team at 17 in 2004. He won 10 La Liga, seven Copa del Rey, and four UEFA Champion\n\nLeague titles. In 2021, Messi then moved to Paris Saint-Germain and in 2023, joined Inter Miami, where he revitalized the team and brought international attention to the MLS.\n\nMeet The Champs In Messi’s Hometown\n\nIn Rosario, notable figures like El Pela Cultiva focus on sharing cultivation knowledge and genetics with other caregivers, fostering community engagement without commercializing their passion.\n\nUnlike the mainstream cannabis industry in the U.S., Rosario's growers, breeders, and caregivers operate more like a community network than individual private companies. They are part of a mutually supportive group of cultivators who work together to provide safe medicines for those in need.\n\nShangri-La Genetics, for example, is a seed bank that offers high-quality cannabis seeds, significantly contributing to the local industry. Vasilli, a seasoned cultivator and hydroponics expert, plays a vital role in advising and judging at cannabis expos across South America.\n\nMeanwhile, growers and breeders at Experiencia Natural Grow\n\nhave won several cannabis cups, further cementing Rosario's reputation for producing top-quality cannabis cultivators and breeders.\n\nOther relevant cultivators include Kief Seeds, led by breeder Leandro López Maraver, who specializes in cuttings and seeds, both regular and feminized. Other key figures are Jo Ji, David Algasibiur, Eleven Labs, and Lisandro Rosso, a percussionist, who serves as the secretary at Plan Verde cooperative.\n\nAt the same time, organizations of caregivers, such as AUPAC and Madres que se Plantan advocate for the legal cultivation of cannabis and provide cannabis oils to hundreds of patients in the city.\n\nHowever, these caregivers face significant challenges, including limited market access, which hinders their operations and personalized care. Caregiving costs money and time, often covered by the caregivers themselves. Despite these obstacles, AUPAC emphasizes the cannabis industry's potential to create jobs and boost the local economy in a city with high poverty levels.\n\nCannabis As An Opportunity\n\nRosario faces serious social challenges, including high levels of poverty and violence linked to drug trafficking. Amid these challenges, the cannabis industry offers a beacon of hope.\n\n\"Through provincial regulations, we can find alternatives to produce good quality products based on good local practices, bypassing the costly international practices that dominate the global market,\" Soledad Pedrana from AUPAC told El Planteo. \"The internal market is an immediate solution for organizations. And adult use is the strength we have. It is the true market that will provide us with a good product at a low cost. It is in this internal market where organizations should be strengthened.”\n\nPhoto: AI-Generated Image."
