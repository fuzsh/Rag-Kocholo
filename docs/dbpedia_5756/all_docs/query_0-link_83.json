        "text": "ROSARIO // Security is at the top of everyone’s minds in the Argentinian city of Rosario these days.\n\nOn Friday, football superstar Lionel Messi will be married there to Antonella Roccuzzo at a lavish celebration bringing together some of the world’s best-paid football players, just up the street from one of the port city’s poorest and most dangerous neighbourhoods.\n\nSome 21 members of the hugely popular FC Barcelona team, including Luis Suarez and Neymar, as well as stars like Gerard Pique – accompanied by partner Shakira, perhaps more popular globally than the Catalan defender himself – will be flying into Rosario, 300 kilometres north of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe luxurious City Center casino-hotel complex, where guests will stay and the ceremony is expected to take place, borders a poor neighbourhood known as the birthplace of the bloody drug gang Los Monos.\n\n“Messi’s marriage – like the casino’s presence in the neighbourhood – is a metaphor for inequality,” said provincial official Carlos Del Frade, the author of several books on Rosario’s exploding drug trade.\n\nOn June 17, a mere 400 metres from the bright lights and neon of City Center, two people on a motorcycle opened fire on four women belonging to Los Monos. The attack killed Petrona Cantero, 56, the sister of Los Monos’ historic leader, Ariel Cantero, who is now serving a prison sentence.\n\nDrug gang-linked violence has killed more than 1,000 people in the past five years in this gritty port city, Mr Del Frade said.\n\nLast year, the homicide rate in Rosario was double the national average of seven per 100,000 inhabitants, according to a report from the Ministry of Security of Santa Fe province, where Rosario is located.\n\nIn the Las Flores neighbourhood, just behind the City Center complex, Los Monos holds virtually total power, according to Mr Del Frade, who said the gang amounts to the “de facto government” there.\n\nHistorically, Rosario has long had a strong working class, and today’s violence stems largely from widespread unemployment, political scientists and economists say.\n\nMessi’s father, a metalworker in Rosario in the 1990s, emigrated with his family to Barcelona in 2000, amid the grave economic crisis then facing Argentina.\n\nToday, the government in Rosario says it feels confident the safety of the illustrious visitor and his guests can be assured, regardless of the high crime rate.\n\n“Rosario is prepared for the wedding,” said city administrator Monica Fein. “Lionel chose to come get married here because it is his hometown and he feels comfortable here and we will do everything in our power to make it so.”\n\nFor now, the details of the planned security operation remain closely guarded.\n\nLast week, local officials met with representatives of the Messi family, but no information leaked out, including on the location of the meeting itself, which was changed at the last moment to keep journalists away.\n\nGustavo Leone, a Rosario official, said the wedding was “a private event”.\n\nHe added that if some guests want to visit Messi’s city then a private tour will be arranged, but only under conditions of strict security and confidentiality.\n\nSome local residents, people who know every twist and turn in the city’s streets, cannot understand the decision by the football star – who made some 70 million euros (Dh287.8m) last season, according to the Eurosport sports network – to hold his wedding celebration in such an unsafe area.\n\n“The truth is, I’m surprised they’re doing it here, considering that Messi is one of the best-paid players in the world. I just can’t believe it,” said Micaela Llane, a 24-year-old secretary.\n\nLocals have been following the preparations as if they were all expecting to be invited, so they know all about last-minute changes to the plans.\n\n“The other hotel (the five-star Puerto Norte, where the celebration was to have been held) is in a much prettier area,” said Ariel Vallejo, who works for a private security firm.\n\nAnd everyone dreams of showing off the best parts of the city where the football superstar – a five-time winner of the prestigious Ballon d’Or award – was born.\n\n* Agence France-Presse"
