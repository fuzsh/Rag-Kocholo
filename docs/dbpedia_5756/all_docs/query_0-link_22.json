        "text": "From the moment Messi lifted up the shimmering World Cup trophy, travel companies have been showering us with holiday ideas like so much ticker tape. But none, so far, seem to have twigged that a pilgrimage to honour Argentina’s greatest ever player must include the country’s third most populous city – Rosario.\n\nLionel Andrés Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in the Hospital Italiano Garibaldi in Rosario. He lived in the La Bajada suburb south of the city centre, went to the General Las Heras school and played for the youth team at Newell’s Old Boys before moving to Barcelona in 2000.\n\nNeedless to say, there are murals and graffiti at all these shrines dedicated to the footballing genius – known fondly as La Pulga, or The Flea, because of his diminutive size and tricksy playing style.\n\nRosario is only 190 miles from Buenos Aires, and a decade ago there was talk of a high-speed train to link the cities. Economic woes have seen the project shelved, but there’s still a rail service – no small thing in a country that has mothballed most of its once world-class network.\n\nThe clunky rolling stock that plies the line takes four hours to complete the journey from the capital’s Retiro station to Rosario Norte – plenty of time to take in the views of the humid Pampa; some of the best farmland in the world is in northern Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, the province to which Rosario belongs.\n\nIf that sluggish speed makes you think of Northern Rail, well that’s quite appropriate. For Rosario can be compared to our northern post-industrial cities – especially Manchester, England’s “third” city.\n\nHere too is an industrial centre, railway hub and trading and shipping nexus – though Rosario, on the right bank of the mighty Paraná river (South America’s second longest waterway after the Amazon), had no need of a canal.\n\nHere, too, are memories of political radicalism; Rosario was once dubbed the “Capital of Peronism” for its fervent support of Juan Perón, and was awarded subsidies and state-funded projects by way of thanks. Like Manchester, Rosario is known as a hard-working city – generating the highest GDP per capita in Argentina – contrasted with Buenos Aires, widely regarded as a hedonistic and frivolous spender of national wealth.\n\nIn the Barrio Fisherton – a late 19th-century model neighbourhood designed by the architect Alejandro Bustillo – you might even think you’ve been teleported to Greater Manchester. Here British expats, many of whom were employed on the railways, lived in red-brick and mock Tudor houses and sipped gin and tonics at their local clubs. The Jockey Club is known for its prowess at polo, golf, hockey and rugby.\n\nFootball is dominated by two other top-flight clubs. Rosario Central, founded in 1889 as a railway team, has been national champion three times and was Mario Kempes’ club before he joined Valencia and Ángel di María’s first club as a senior. Its chief rival – Messi’s Newell’s – is named after one Isaac Newell of Strood, Kent, who founded a Church of England school in Rosario and whose son, Claudio, co-founded the club.\n\nIts stadium is named after former player, scout and manager Marcelo Bielsa. I once saw Newell’s Old Boys at home to Boca Juniors – a noisy, combative match – but the local derby is probably the one to see if you happen to be planning a visit.\n\nRosario really is a great place to spend a couple of days, and a clever means of breaking up a long overland journey towards Córdoba, Salta or the Iguazú Falls. The Argentine flag, with its House of Bourbon colours, was first hoisted here by Manuel Belgrano; an imposing memorial complex beside the river houses his remains. A 13-foot statue of Ernesto “Che” Guevara commemorates the city’s most famous son.\n\nLike all Argentine cities, Rosario is a mishmash of architectural styles, but neoclassical, baroque and modern buildings are dotted here and there. There’s an official Modernist/Nouveau self-guided walk. The Beaux-Arts style Palacio Fuentes, built in the Twenties by Juan Fuentes Echeverría – who started as a farmer and dishwasher and rose to become an agri-magnate – is a local masterpiece.\n\nWith more than a dozen theatres, 20-odd museums and a lively local music scene – including punk-ska band Argies, there’s plenty to entertain the 1.5m residents, including a large student population. The Pichincha district is a gastronomic hub sometimes compared to trendy Palermo Viejo in Buenos Aires, with everything from traditional steakhouses to ultra-cool speakeasies.\n\nRosario might be named after a holy virgin – the name means Rosary, as in the prayer – but it became known as “the Argentinian Chicago” because it was the main port for grain exports; it was also known for its Sicilian mobsters. One old grainstore, the Silo Davis, now houses a contemporary art museum. Local patriots would prefer their city to be known as the Cradle of the Flag or Capital of Cereals or even the Argentina Barcelona – in reference to its history of working-class solidarity.\n\nI think it should be twinned with Manchester, for all the above reasons. Should Messi ever come home, though, the religious and footballing traditions will finally be entwined in a single godhead. He’s already referred to as the local export, rather than the hides, frozen meats and wheat that built the city. Rosario de Santa Fe will probably become Rosario de San Leo. They might even remove the Sun of May, and adorn the national colours with his face."
