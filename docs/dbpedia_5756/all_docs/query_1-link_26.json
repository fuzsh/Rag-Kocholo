He made his debut for the Argentina national team during a friendly match in August 2005. With an impressive collection of seven Ballon d’Or trophies and a World Cup victory, Lionel Messi is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of football.\n\nLeo Messi, also known as Lionel Messi, is an Argentine-born football (soccer) player who has won six FIFA world player of the year awards. His full name is Lionel Andrés Messi. He was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario (2009–12, 2015, and 2019).\n\nMessi began playing football when he was a young lad and joined the Newell’s Old Boys juvenile team in 1995 (a Rosario-based top-division football club).

He had 21 goals in 14 games for the youth squad, and he swiftly advanced to higher-level clubs, receiving his first professional contract at the age of 16.\n\nLionel Messi has led Argentina into the semifinals of the FIFA World Cup 2022 which is being held in Qatar.

A month later, following the Barcelona-Espanyol derby, they made their relationship public during a carnival in Sitges. Three sons were born to Messi and Roccuzzo: Thiago (born in 2012), Mateo (born in 2015), and Ciro (born 2018).
