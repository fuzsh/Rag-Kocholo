        "text": "Lionel Messi is considered one of the greatest footballers of all time. The player, who was born in Argentina, has won several records, titles, and trophies, and he has fans all over the world. With so many goals scored, people always expect the best from him. However, Lionel Messi is human, and he also makes mistakes and goes through failure.\n\nDuring his career, Messi experienced various disappointments. Despite being so successful, failure did not spare him. In this post, we will take a look at some of the greatest failures of Lionel Messi.\n\nLionel Messi’s Early Life\n\nLionel Messi was born in Rosario, Santa Fe, on June 24, 1987. His father is Jorge Messi, and his mother is Celia Cuccittini. While his father was the manager of a steel factory, his mother was a worker in a magnet-manufacturing workshop. Messi is not the only child of the couple — the parents had four children in total, with Lionel being the third.\n\nMessi was extremely young when he became interested in football. This was because there were many football lovers in his family. As this passion emerged, little Messi was always seen playing football with his brothers and cousins.\n\nThen, he joined the Grandoli local club when he was only four years old. His father coached him. At the age of six, Messi joined the Rosario Club and supported Newell’s Old Boys. Throughout the years he spent in the club, he was able to score 500 goals.\n\nDespite his success in The Machine of ’87, he was close to giving up on football when he was ten. This is because young Messi got diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. His father was able to help with coverage for the treatment for only two years. The treatment was quite expensive at $1,000 per month.\n\nNewell’s said they would help with the costs but eventually gave up. Then, Messi was scouted by the River Plate club from Buenos Aires. Unfortunately, they also refused to contribute to his treatment payments and the family had to do it alone.\n\nSigning with Barcelona\n\nThen, in September 2000, the family looked to schedule a trial with Barcelona. Although Messi was accepted by Charly Rexach (the team director), the board of directors was not so eager to sign him. This was mainly because Messi was very young and a foreigner.\n\nBarcelona then received an ultimatum to prove that they were committed. Rexach ended up making a contract on a napkin, since he lacked paper. Messi’s family was able to move to Barcelona in February, 2001, very close to the Camp Nou stadium.\n\nThings did not go too well during the initial stages because a transfer conflict with Newell’s stopped Messi from playing. He could only be fielded in the Catalan league and friendlies, and it was extremely difficult for him to become part of the team. At first, he did not communicate with his teammates too much.\n\nHe finally joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in February, following a year at the youth academy of Barcelona. In the end, he managed to make some friends among his teammates, with Gerard Pique being one of them. At 14 years old, he finished his growth hormone treatment, and was part of the best youth side of Barcelona, nicknamed the “Baby Dream Team”.\n\nDuring his time with Barcelona’s junior team, Messi scored 21 goals during 14 games. He was able to reach the advanced level until he turned 16, when he managed to have his FC Barcelona informal debut.\n\nLionel Messi was 17 during the 2004–2005 season, and that is when he became the youngest player in Spanish La Liga. Ever since, he has slowly gotten better and better, becoming one of the best players in the world.\n\nLionel Messi’s Failures\n\nJust like any other human being, Lionel Messi has experienced failure. It is hard to imagine that someone so successful could fail, but he had his fair share of disappointments throughout his career. Here are some of the less pleasant moments in Messi’s life:\n\nLosing the World Cup in 2014\n\nSome people think that back in 2014, Messi was stripped of the opportunity to win his first international trophy because of Gonzalo Higuain. In reality, Messi himself was responsible for the loss.\n\nLionel Messi got a through ball from midfield, which allowed his team to open the scoring. While he was approaching the goal, defenders from the German team were chasing him, but the only one Messi really had to beat was Manuel Neuer. But Messi ended up shooting the ball wide of the far post.\n\nThis cost the team the World Cup and he missed the chance to get the international trophy he wanted.\n\nCopa America Penalty Miss\n\nIn 2016, Messi had an opportunity to win a trophy after his team lost against Chile in the 2015 finals.\n\nThe 120 minutes of the game were not enough for any of the teams to score. Therefore, a penalty shootout would have to decide the outcome of this match between Argentina and Chile.\n\nIn the first penalty shot, Arturo Vidal was unsuccessful. Messi was next, and he hoped to score. However, he ended up shooting the ball over the goal. As a result, Argentina lost.\n\nUnable to Score Against Liverpool\n\nLionel Messi may have scored a lot of goals, but he also had many moments when he was not lucky when trying to score. One of these moments was during a match against Liverpool. Messi’s team was the favorite to enter the final of the Champions League, especially after leading in the first leg of the semi-final 3–0.\n\nDuring the second leg, Liverpool was able to score quite early. Lionel Messi then had two separate opportunities to score. He was unsuccessful, though. The first chance was saved by Alisson, whereas the second one ended with Messi losing the ball.\n\nSize Issues\n\nThe famous player struggled with a growth hormone problem during his childhood. This affected him in many ways, and although he was able to overcome it through treatment, it still led to him being smaller in size compared to other football players. This was quite problematic at times.\n\nWhen his team would play against larger players, Messi would be at a disadvantage, and it was quite challenging trying to beat the opponents. However, many times, he was able to overcome this issue. He scored a lot of goals and became one of the greatest football players in history.\n\nVarious Injuries\n\nFootball players are not safe from injuries, and Messi himself was not spared. For instance, in 2006, he had a right bicep injury. Then, during the next season, he experienced a muscle tear injury.\n\nBecause of the different injuries he dealt with, the player was not able to play football for more than 200 days.\n\nFree Kick Difficulties\n\nDespite having amazing accuracy when trying to score a goal, Messi does not have a lot of power when it comes to free kicks.\n\nMessi has the best chance to score when he is within 25 yards of the goal. If he is further away, he often misses the shot.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nLionel Messi experienced failure several times throughout his life. He dealt with a growth hormone deficiency that made him miss out on some time on the field, and he also cost his team the opportunity to win important games several times. Besides that, he experienced various injuries, and his size still gets in the way of his games sometimes.\n\nBut Messi never gave up on football, despite his problems or the various failures he’s experienced. He kept fighting and became one of the greatest football players in the world, and people all across the planet love him. He’s now a World Cup winner."
