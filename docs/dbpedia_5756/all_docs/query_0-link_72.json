        "text": "Yaaaaaaaargh!” The breathless magic of Lionel Messi’s goal scoring often leaves Ray Hudson, the motormouth commentator for Gol TV, grasping for words. It happened again on Jan. 21 as Messi scored a brilliant hat trick in FC Barcelona’s 4-1 win at Malaga in Spain’s La Liga. His first, a textbook header, had Hudson declaring that “his talent would light up the national grid.” After his second, Hudson described the diminutive Argentine as a “colossus bestriding the earth.” But Messi’s third — a slaloming run from the halfway line past three Malaga defenders, culminating in a soft, left-footed tap past the goalkeeper’s outstretched hands — left the commentator with only a rasping, primal scream: “YAAAAAAAARGH!”\n\nThat must also be the sound rising inside defenders’ heads when football’s mesmerizing little genius bears down on them at speed. Some have found the humiliation from a player nicknamed the Flea too much to bear and have lashed out, their frustration usually, but not always, aimed at his fleet feet. During a Jan. 18 FC Barcelona match against archrival Real Madrid, a defender named Pepe, assigned the hopeless task of trying to stop the Barcelona star, contrived to stomp on his hand after Messi had been tripped yet again by another player. (The foul was as futile as it was egregious: Messi set up the decisive goal in Barcelona’s win.)\n\n(Person of the Year: People Who Mattered – Lionel Messi)\n\nIt is the lot of great players to be treated shabbily on the field and royally off it. A few days before the Madrid game, football’s grandees had gathered in Zurich to crown Messi, known as Leo to his subjects, as their king. The annual announcement of the FIFA Ballon d’Or is meant to anoint the best player of the previous season. This year it was practically a foregone conclusion that Messi, 24, would receive his third Golden Ball in a row.\n\nMessi hardly looks a monarch: he possesses no hauteur, not even the I’m-the-MAN! swagger expected of a modern sporting superstar. For someone who has lived half his life in the spotlight, he is surprisingly shy, even painfully so. “Year after year, I’ve grown, improved,” he told me after the award ceremony. “I was lucky to start very young and always have very good colleagues around me as I was coming up, and this has helped me and how I play.”\n\n(SPECIAL: World Cup 2010)\n\nEvery generation produces players who change the game with their talent or approach — Puskas, Di Stefano, Pelé, Cruyff, Maradona, Zidane. Messi’s third Ballon d’Or not only cemented his place in the galaxy of greats, it also made him the centerpiece of a singular argument. “Messi is amongst the best ever,” quoth Manchester United’s Alex Ferguson, perhaps the most successful manager of all time. Pep Guardiola, Messi’s coach at Barcelona, declared that his team’s superstar “could be the best player of all time.” The influential British football writer Sid Lowe wrote in the Guardian: “It is no longer about whether or not Messi is currently the best player in the world; it is about whether he might even be the best there has ever been.”\n\nMessi is hailed in every football-loving country but one: his own. You would think there would be even louder hosannas in Argentina: its prodigal son, born to a steelworker and a part-time cleaner in the city of Rosario, handicapped in childhood by a growth-hormone deficiency, had gone on to foreign lands and been made sovereign of world football. But no. For all his great achievements abroad, Messi has never been fully embraced by his countrymen as one of their own, much less their king. There isn’t an official Leo Messi fan club in Buenos Aires. A few days after the Ballon d’Or ceremony, Cristian Grosso, sports columnist for the Argentine daily La Nacion, noted that “while the world bows to him, he’s barely starting to draw support here.” Why? The headline to Grosso’s column hinted at the answer: IT’S TIME TO START RESPECTING THE CATALONIAN. Catalonia is the Spanish region of which Barcelona is the capital; the headline defines Messi as one of “them,” not one of “us.”\n\nMany Argentines find it hard to relate to Messi because he has played his entire professional career abroad. The traditional trajectory of a South American football star requires him to be discovered young, then play a few years for an important domestic club and develop an emotional connection with local fans before heading for greater glory in Europe. But although Messi was a child prodigy, he left Argentina at 13. At that point, his talent was already undeniable, but his size was a drawback: his height was below the third percentile for his age. When his parents and local club could no longer afford the $1,000-a-month hormone treatment to rectify this childhood deficiency, FC Barcelona agreed to recruit him and bear the expenses. (Messi is now 169 cm.) He grew up, as a man and a player, at the club’s famous La Masia youth academy.\n\n(MORE: Messi: A Turning Point for Indian Soccer?)\n\nSo, uniquely among his nation’s top-tier football stars, he has never represented an Argentine club. He has played for the national team, but that amounts to barely 10 games a year, many of them played outside Argentina. And since debuting for the senior national team in 2005 at 18, he has won no honors of any consequence. (Messi did help Argentina take gold in Beijing in 2008, but Olympic football holds little value to fans.)\n\nSee TIME’s Top 10 Sporting Moments of 2011.\n\nSee photos from the 2010 World Cup.\n\nIn contrast, his collection of honors for FC Barcelona reflects that team’s ascension to the greatest on the planet. With Messi as its talisman, Barca, as the club is known, has redefined what can be done on a football field, playing a highly intricate passing game that leaves rivals mesmerized and vulnerable to the darting, goal-bound runs of its forwards.\n\n(See pictures of football’s top stars, including Messi.)\n\nSince Messi joined the first XI in 2004, Barca (pronounced Bar-sa) has thrice won the UEFA Champions League, the greatest contest in professional football. Barca has also won La Liga, Spain’s domestic league, five times. And it has claimed two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and an assortment of lesser trinkets. No other club has accumulated as many trophies in that period. (Full disclosure: I have been a Barca partisan since early youth.)\n\nAnd although the club has a constellation of top talent — eight members of the Spanish team that won the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa play for Barca — it is Messi’s goals that bring in the silverware. He has banged in 212 in 295 appearances, not including friendlies, a strike rate of 0.72 per game in a sport in which anything approaching 0.50 is regarded as brilliant. His closest rival, the Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays professionally for Barca’s archrival Real Madrid, has 237 goals in 411 games, a strike rate of 0.58. But what makes Messi unique among top goal getters is that he also creates scoring opportunities for others because he inevitably attracts so much defensive attention. His passing skill has produced 76 assists in his 295 appearances, a ratio exceeded only by a handful of midfielders, whose main job is to assist.\n\nAnd then there are the “oh my God” goals: beating four of Real Madrid’s high-priced defenders in a flash; flicking the ball past Arsenal’s befuddled keeper Manuel Almunia; collecting a pass at midfield against Getafe in 2007 and beating one player twice and three others before rounding the keeper to score. “I look at him, and he does at least three or four things in every game that I never did in my whole career,” says Gary Lineker, one of England’s most successful strikers. Former England manager Terry Venables, who coached Barcelona in the 1980s, adds, “It’s not possible, what he does.” Some great players, like Cristiano Ronaldo, have blinding speed; others, like the late Irish wizard George Best, are brilliant improvisers; still others, like Germany’s 1970s star Gerd Müller, have the knack of always being in the right place. Messi has all three gifts in generous proportions. He also has the ability to harness them in the biggest games, when he is under the most extreme pressure. He has scored twice in Champions League finals and 13 times in 17 games against Real Madrid in one of football’s fiercest contests.\n\n(See pictures of Diego Maradona.)\n\nIf Messi is otherworldly when playing in the blue and claret of Barca, why are his stats in the sky blue and white of the Argentine national team more human at just 0.29 goals per game? Argentina’s chaotic football politics is part of the problem. Since Messi’s debut, the national team has been run by a number of coaches (including, during the 2010 World Cup, the iconic Diego Maradona). Each has preferred a style very different from Barca’s. While his club allows him freedom to roam on the pitch, the national team — which has other world-class goal scorers in Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero — has mostly confined Messi to the right wing, allowing him fewer opportunities to strike. And few of his national teammates have the discipline and work ethic that are Barca’s hallmarks. Juan Roman Riquelme, the team’s playmaker, put it best when he declared, “Argentina is Messi without Barcelona, and Spain is Barcelona without Messi.”\n\nBut to many ordinary Argentine fans, Messi’s relatively mediocre goal-scoring record for the national team suggests that he puts club ahead of country, that he simply doesn’t play as hard for Argentina. By their reckoning, he is more Catalonian than Argentine.\n\nThe accusation cuts deeply. “[Critics] said things that weren’t true, that I didn’t care as much about wearing the [Argentine] shirt,” he says. The topic brings out genuine emotion in Messi, who is known to be cautious to the point of blandness. “I’ve never stopped being Argentine, and I’ve never wanted to,” he says. Teammates and club officials vouch for his patriotism: they point out that his accent remains unchanged since he first arrived in Spain from Rosario and that he barely speaks any Catalan, the language of Catalonia. (Ironically, some Barca fans fault him for failing to adapt to the ways of his adopted home.) He drinks endless quantities of maté, which is to Argentines what tea is to the English, and is partial to churrasco grilled-meat cookouts, another favorite national pastime. Even his girlfriend, Antonella Rocuzzo, is from his hometown. “He is the most Argentinian of Argentines,” says Guillermo Amor, the club’s director of football training. “He’s strongly rooted to his barrio [neighbourhood] in Rosario.”\n\nNational teammates too can sympathize with Messi’s predicament. Tevez, no stranger to criticism, lashed out in a recent interview: “Everything is always Messi’s fault. And he’s the best player in the world. Imagine how he must feel in his head!” Indeed, the lack of affection often hangs over Messi like a dark cloud, especially after a losing game. Carlos Bilardo, who coached Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup and is now general manager of the national team, recalls one postgame episode in which Messi broke down in uncontrollable tears in the dressing room. “He was just crying and crying and crying, and he couldn’t stop,” Bilardo says. “[Forward] Diego Milito came to ask me what to do, and I told him to just let him keep crying. That’s how much he loves Argentina.”\n\nSee pictures of football stadiums around the world.\n\nSee more on the 2011 Champions League final.\n\nWith so much else to cry for in Argentina in the past couple of decades — its economy left in the dust by Brazil’s, its domestic football league a violence-prone wreck — the national football team is disproportionately significant in this proud country. It wears on Messi. “When he returns from a national game, we all worry about his emotional state,” says Sandro Rossel, Barca’s president. Fingers were pointed at him after Argentina’s poor showing in South Africa, where it was thumped by Germany in the quarter-finals: Messi was scoreless in five games.\n\nBut the lowest point for Messi came last July, only weeks after he had won both the Champions League and La Liga with Barca. When Argentina drew 0-0 with Colombia in Messi’s native province of Santa Fe, fans began to hurl abuse at him. “Maradona! Maradona!” they screamed, making a mocking comparison between Messi and the former superstar. More hurtfully, they yelled, “Mercenary! Catalonian!” In the dressing room after the game, defender Nicolás Burdisso faced down Messi, screaming, “Get your act together, brat!” (Imagine Michael Jordan being chewed out by, say, Christian Laettner after a game at the 1992 Olympics.)\n\nBurdisso subsequently apologized, and some Santa Fe fans went to the next game at the stadium with banners pleading for Messi’s pardon: FORGIVE THEM, LEO, THEY KNOW WHAT THEY SAY! AND THANK YOU FOR SO MUCH! FORGIVE US FOR SO LITTLE! Messi says that since then, he’s felt less hostility from his countrymen. In Rosario during his Christmas break, he noticed there was less criticism of him on TV sports shows. “Before there was a lot of criticism and everything was bad,” he says. “And now it’s not like that. That’s good, because every country I go, people have always received me very well, and in my own country that wasn’t happening.”\n\n(MORE: David Beckham Signs On for Two More Years in Los Angeles)\n\nStill, there’s no disguising what his countrymen want most from Messi. “Until he wins a World Cup for Argentina, [the fans are] going to keep yelling ‘Maradona’ at him,” says Julian Moncalvo, who manages a restaurant in the trendy Palermo Hollywood district of Buenos Aires. For this prodigal son, coming home isn’t enough: he is expected to bring the fatted calf too.\n\nOn the horizon is a tantalizing opportunity for Messi to secure his rightful place in Argentine hearts: the next World Cup, in 2014, will be in Brazil, Argentina’s great rival. Messi will be 27, the peak age for a football player; Maradona was 25 when he won the Cup in ’86. If Messi can match Maradona’s achievement, he will not only prove his commitment to his country, he will likely surpass Pelé and Maradona as the best player ever. “I think the record books have to record him as a World Cup winner for him to be accepted as the greatest player of all time,” says Gavin Hamilton, editor of World Soccer magazine.\n\nMessi says the World Cup is his ultimate ambition, but he is careful to couch it in terms of what it will mean for his country, not for his place in the game’s history. “I hope it’s the moment for Argentina and that we can become champions. I’m going because I want to be champion and share the World Cup with my national team.”\n\nAnd what if the World Cup isn’t in his destiny? Opinion is divided on how history will judge Messi if his display cabinet lacks that one winner’s medal. Pelé, who jealously guards his title as the greatest, has sniffed that the Argentine has a long way to go before being considered his equal. “When Messi’s scored 1,283 goals like me, when he’s won three World Cups, we’ll talk about it,” he told the French daily Le Monde in an interview published Jan. 20.\n\nPelé has three World Cup winner’s medals, but he got them when the Cup was the only competition in which the world’s top players faced off, and quadrennially at that. These days, the annual UEFA Champions League is arguably a bigger and more grueling gladiatorial contest. Lineker says the league is comparable to the Cup “because you’ve got all the best players in the world playing in it for the biggest clubs week in, week out.”\n\nBy that reckoning, Messi may already have done enough to turn football’s divine duopoly into a holy trinity: Pelé, Maradona, Messi. But that’s not enough for the man who sobs after a lost game, who is known to storm off the pitch if he loses a rondo, or training-ground contest: he needs to keep playing, keep winning and (defenders of the world, beware!) keep getting better. “There’s still a lot of time to prepare and to improve,” he says.\n\nMORE: Nike-Made Shirts Have Barcelona Soccer Team Sweaty and Frustrated\n\nIt’s hard to imagine how he can still improve. His skills are already so unreal that Arsene Wenger, manager of the English club Arsenal, compared him to virtual players in PlayStation games. Not coincidentally, those are his favorite pastime off the real pitch. At the end of our interview, I ask if, when he plays a football video game, he picks the virtual Messi to be on his team. “Of course,” he replies, with only the faintest hint of swagger. “How else can I win?”\n\n— with reporting by Uki Goni / Buenos Aires, Glen Levy / London and Lisa Abend / Barcelona"
