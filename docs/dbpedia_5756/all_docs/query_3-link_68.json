        "text": "Lionel Messi is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi holds many records including eight Ballon d'Or awards, six European Golden Shoes and being named the world's best player eight times by Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Until 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times. With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals (474), hat-tricks (36), and assists (192) in La Liga. Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and the most goals for a single club (672).\n\nAn Argentine international, Messi is his country's all-time leading goalscorer and holds the national record for appearances. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who declared the teenager his successor. One of the most prolific goalscorers and clinical finishers of all time, Messi is known for his powerful and accurate striking ability from both inside and outside the area, as well as his positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He is also known for his superb ball control.\n\nBorn and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join FC Barcelona after they agreed to pay for his medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. During the 2008-2009 season, he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble -- when a club team wins three trophies in a single season -- in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins.\n\nMessi is also well-known for his philanthropy, having been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, Messi has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and serves as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador. He also founded the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children. Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centers and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world."
