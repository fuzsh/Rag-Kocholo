        "text": "Childhood\n\nLionel Messi was born in Rosario, Argentina, on June 24, 1987. At a relatively young age, Messi was diagnosed with a hormone deficiency that restricted his growth. Messi’s parents wanted to give him nightly growth hormone injections but were unable due to the extremely high cost. Luckily, at age thirteen, Messi was offered to train at Barcelona’s youth academy, La Masia, and his medical bills were covered. His family moved to Spain, where he improved quickly and was often compared to football legend Diego Maradona due to his height and attacking style.\n\nCareer Timeline\n\nMessi’s iconic career was launched in 2005 and his fans speculate on what year his “prime”, meaning his best most successful stage was. However, he is a very consistent player, as his time dedicated to the sport showed incredible athleticism annually.\n\n2005 – Messi made his first appearance for FC Barcelona at 16. In the same year, he led Argentina to the title in the 20-under world cup.\n\n2006 – Messi made his first appearance in the World Cup for Argentina. He came as a substitute in the group stages and scored in this game.\n\n2009 – Messi won the Champions League, La Liga, and Spanish cup titles. He also received the Ballon d’Or award (World Player of the year.)\n\n2010/2011 – Messi led Barcelona to the La Liga and Spanish cup championships; a year later, in 2011, he led them to the Champions League title.\n\n2012 – Not only did Messi become the first player ever to score five goals in a Champions League match, but he also passed the club record and became Barcelona’s leading scorer ever.\n\n2013 – Messi broke another record when he won his 4th Ballon d’Or in 2013.\n\n2014 – Messi led Argentina to the world cup final but lost extra time to Germany.\n\n2015 – Messi won his 5th Ballon d’Or trophy.\n\n2018 – Argentina lost to France in the round of 16.\n\n2021 – In August, Messi joined the club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).\n\n2022 – Argentina played in and wins the World Cup\n\nAn Argentinian Legend\n\nMessi played in what the world believes to be his final world cup due to him being 35 years of age. Messi started the tournament with a disappointing 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia. However, Argentina improved when they won 2 other games in the group stage 2-0, against Poland and Mexico. They beat Australia in the Round of 16 2-1 and scraped a win against the Netherlands, winning in penalties. They beat Croatia in the semi-finals, 3-0, and they made it to the final against France. The first 80 minutes of the game were a breeze for Messi, with Argentina dominating France 2-0 for most of the game. However, this was crushed when France’s star scorer Kylian Mbappe scored twice within 5 minutes, tying the game and forcing it to go into extra time. When both teams scored once in extra time, the World Cup Championship went into penalties. Argentina won in fines, 4-2, giving Messi his first World Cup Championship win.\n\nThis commentary had become famous due to its significant impact, and was spoken before Messi won the 2022 world cup title:\n\nThe little boy from Rosario, Argentina\n\nOn behalf of every little boy wearing his shirt\n\nMessi on a million backs\n\nMessi for a million flashbulbs\n\nMessi potentially to crown his stellar career\n\nOne kick of the ball\n\nOne kick of the football\n\nHe has done it before\n\nHe has done it so many times at the nou camp\n\nAround Spain. Around Europe\n\nHe has done it brilliantly for his nation in the competition\n\nHe must do it now"
