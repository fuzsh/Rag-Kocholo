        "text": "Lionel Messi’s eagerly awaited appearance in Hong Kong ended without fans being able to see him play as he sat out Inter Miami’s 4-1 victory over a Hong Kong XI on Sunday.\n\nThere were angry scenes as spectators turned on the visiting team and their co-owner David Beckham, booing and chanting “refund”.\n\nMessi, the man most of the 40,000 fans had paid handsomely to see play, was carrying a hamstring injury and remained out of the action as an unused substitute.\n\nAfterwards, Beckham’s attempt to address the crowd was drowned out by booing as many headed for the exits.\n\nWidely seen as the greatest to have ever played the game, tens of thousands turned out on Saturday just to watch Messi stretch in an open training session, but that was all they were to get as the 36-year-old nursed his legs on Sunday.\n\nLocal stars G.E.M, Gareth T and Mirror member Keung To earlier entertained a crowd that included the city’s leader John Lee, but the day was to end on a sour note.\n\nReporting by Josh Ball, Ezra Cheung, Paul McNamara, Connor Mycroft and Mike Chan"
