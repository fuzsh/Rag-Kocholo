        "text": "MESSI Done By : Ameer Atiyah 6A\n\nAbout Him • Full name: Lionel Andres Messi • Nickname/s: Leo, La Pulga • Date of Birth: 24-06-1987 • Place of Birth: Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina • Position: Forward • Team: FC Barcelona • National Team: Argentina • Weight: 67 KG • Height: 167cm\n\nFor which club and national team does messi play for • Messi actually plays for his national team which is Argentina but when he doesn’t have any tournaments in Argentina he plays for FC Barcelona which is the club which he plays for.\n\nAbout his background and from which family does he come from. • Lionel Andrés Messi was born 24 June 1987 he is an Argentinefootballer who currently plays for FC Barcelona and the Argentina national team as a forward or winger. He also holds Spanish citizenship, which makes him eligible as a EU player. Considered one of the best football players of his generation[3][4][5] and frequently cited as the world's best contemporary player,[6] Messi received several Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations by the age of 21 and won both by the age of 22.[6][7][8][9] His playing style and ability have drawn comparisons to Diego Maradona, who himself declared Messi his \"successor”. His parents Jorge Horacio Messi (born 1958), a factory worker, and Celia MaríaCuccittini, a part-time cleaner. He has two older brothers named Rodrigo and Matías as well as a sister named Maria. Messi came from a very poor family but now he is very rich.\n\nWhy is Messi very special? • The things which make messi very special is his skills and his different moves. Messi is a very good player with nice skills and he is very fast so he very fast open spaces and he dribbles the players and he shoots and scores. I also think that messi is special because he does maradona’s tricks which are very nice and nobody can do them.\n\nWhy do you enjoy watching messi playing? • I enjoy messi playing because he has different skills and a big amount of different moves where he dribbles the players and always tries so score some goals for his team to win and they like take the cup if it was a final match. I also enjoy watching him because ei would like to be like him one day and because the other players are not that good as him.\n\nWhat are three questions would you ask him if you met him? • The first question is who taught him all of these tricks because I would like to know how to do them all. • The second question is how many minutes does he take to practice everyday because I want to know if I want to be a football layer for me not to waste my life. • The third question is what did he want to be when he grew up because I want to know different players opinions.\n\nFrom where did I get the information from? • I took the information from the internet and some of them form my own knowledge which I hear from the television or I ask my older brothers."
