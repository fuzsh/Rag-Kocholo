He spent most of his career with Barcelona where he won 35 trophies, which includes ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues.

He is currently 34 years old.\n\nWhen did Lionel Messi start playing football?\n\nMessi started playing football with his elder brothers Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At just four, he joined a local club called Grandoli, where he was coached by his father.\n\nAt the age of six, he joined Newell's Old Boys and stayed there for six years. It is believed that he scored over 500 goals in those six years which earned him the nickname \"The Machine of '87\".\n\nWhen did Messi join Barcelona?\n\nThe Messi family had relatives in Catalonia and through them, they sought to arrange a trial for young Leo. In December 2000, the talks materialised and first-team director Charly Rexach offered him a contract. In February 2001, the entire family relocated to Barcelona as Messi joined La Masia, the youth academy of the club.\n\nWhen did Messi make his senior team debut?\n\nAt 17 years, three months, and 22 days, Messi made his senior team debut in a LaLiga game against Espanyol on October 16, 2004. Not only was that his professional debut, he also became the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.\n\nWhen did Messi score his first professional goal?\n\nAt 17 years, 10 months, eight days, he scored his first professional goal against Albacete which made him the youngest-ever scorer for the club.\n\nTimeline: Major events in Lionel Messi's career"
