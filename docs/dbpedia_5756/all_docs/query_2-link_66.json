        "text": "Lionel Messi, the prodigy from Rosario, Argentina, added another year to his storied life on Monday, celebrating his 37th birthday. Unlike many, Messi didn't indulge in lavish celebrations. Instead, he took to Instagram to share a humble, heartfelt message with his millions of followers, expressing his gratitude and highlighting his ongoing commitment to the Argentina national team as they prepared for their next game.\n\nAs is often the case, Messi's birthday coincided with international duty, this time against Chile in the Copa America. For the football maestro, birthdays have frequently meant business, with most of them spent in the trenches of international competitions. This year's understated celebration was no different, reflecting the relentless dedication that has defined his illustrious career.\n\n\"Thank you very much for all the greetings and congratulations!! Another year that coincides with my birthday being with the National Team... So just a little celebration and we continue preparing for our next game. Hugs!\" -Lionel Messi\n\nThe official Argentina social media accounts, along with FIFA, paid their tributes. The Argentina account on X, formerly Twitter, aptly remarked, \"Today is the birthday of the one who fulfilled our dream of seeing him champion,\" accompanied by a video of Messi's crowning moment lifting the World Cup in Qatar 2022. It was a poignant reminder of the pinnacle he reached just a few months back, a dream finally realized for him and millions of Argentines.\n\nMessi: Always humble, always great\n\nBorn on June 24, 1987, Messi's birthdays have often been shared with the Albiceleste, from the World Cups of 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018, to the Copa America tournaments. The exception was Qatar, the World Cup that took place in the winter of 2022, where Messi's brilliance illuminated the tournament like a comet blazing through the night sky. This year, Messi's 37th birthday aligns with the reigning world and continental champion's clash against Chile in the group stage of the Copa America, set in the imposing MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.\n\nThe venue, a coliseum of modern sport, holds bittersweet memories for Messi. It was here, on June 26, 2016, that Argentina fell to Chile on penalties in the Bicentennial Cup final. Messi, the captain, missed the first penalty, a moment that seemed to etch despair into his legacy. His subsequent resignation from international football felt like a tragic end to an epic saga, but as all great stories go, he returned a year later, rejuvenated and relentless. In 2021, Messi finally exorcised those demons by clinching his first major trophy with Argentina at the Copa America, a victory that felt as much cathartic as it was deserved."
