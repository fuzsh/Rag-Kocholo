        "text": "SHORT HILLS, New Jersey — Lionel Messi smiled and waved outside a hotel window to greet adoring fans on his 37th birthday Monday, in a celebration spanning from Times Square in New York City to the Argentine national team’s hotel in New Jersey.\n\nArgentine fans wearing white and sky blue flooded the streets of Times Square on Monday afternoon – dancing, jumping and signing “Soy Argentino, Es un sentimiento, Que no puedo parar. (I am Argentine. It’s a feeling that I cannot stop).”\n\nAbout 20 miles away at the Hilton Short Hills on Monday night, fans parked at a nearby mall and waited for hours to see Messi and several of his teammates, before staff members served two large sheets of dulce de leche cake, an Argentine favorite.\n\nThe celebration ended just before 10 p.m. local time, less than 24 hours before Argentina faces Chile at MetLife Stadium on Tuesday at 9 p.m. in their second group-play match during Copa América 2024.\n\n“I was crying. It was crazy. I never really imagined I could see him this close. So, it was definitely an unbelievable experience,” said Melanie Huashuayo, 21, a Peruvian from Summit, New Jersey who waited with her parents for Messi’s appearance.\n\n“I had this inclination to come. I heard from my friends he was staying, and I was like let me see if I can see him. I’m pretty happy I came.”\n\nKael Varela, 50, an Argentina from New Jersey, waited outside with his 13-year-old son Zen. About an hour after seeing Messi, he was still at a loss for words.\n\n“It was very emotional. After so many games following him, it was special, especially with my son,” Varela said. “We found out and we came. We took our chances and we were very lucky.”\n\nFelipe Rivera, a Colombian from Morristown, New Jersey, hopes to get a great Christmas gift from his niece Victoria Marin, 13, and nephew Andres Rodriguez, 10, after waiting about five hours to see Messi.\n\n“I was crying. I didn’t think I would cry seeing Messi up there,” Victoria said. “Wow. That was awesome.”\n\nAdded Andres: “It was super fun.”\n\nMessi posted a photo on Instagram earlier Monday, holding a birthday cake next to a bed filled with more sugary treats.\n\n“Thank you so much for all the greetings and congratulations!!” Messi said. “Another year that coincides with my birthday being with the National Team... So, celebrating a little bit more and we keep getting ready for our next game. Hugs!”\n\nIt’s a day of sweets and introspection for Messi, one day before Argentina continues group play during Copa América 2024.\n\nArgentine national coach Lionel Scaloni did his best to entertain questions Monday about the opponent, the loss in the Copa América Centenario final to Chile in 2016, and how the club will celebrate Messi’s birthday after practice.\n\n“You know the phrase, ‘What can I give him if he has everything?’ It’s a great excuse by the way,” Scaloni said when asked if he has a gift in mind.\n\nMessi, during another relaxed, introspective interview with Argentine journalist Juan Pablo Varsky, released Monday, said his soccer prowess and talent was a gift from above.\n\n“It’s very clear to me that I was born like this because God chose me,” Messi said. “It was a gift he gave me. I tried to take advantage of it, I did everything possible to squeeze the most out of it.”\n\nMessi’s gift has been a gift to all soccer fans worldwide. He’s a World Cup champion. He’s in the twilight of his legendary career, playing in the United States with Major League Soccer’s Inter Miami CF. And he hopes to add another international title to Argentina’s record books.\n\nMessi is healthy with no lingering effects from a hard tackle he endured in the final 10 minutes of Argentina’s 2-0 win over Canada on Thursday in Atlanta, the coach added.\n\nMessi appeared to bang knees with a sliding defender, but finished the match. Although he was held scoreless, Messi’s assist to Lautaro Martinez in the 88th minute sealed the victory. Chile played Peru to a scoreless draw on Friday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.\n\n“He’s doing fine. He’s trained well, and he’s in condition for playing,” Scaloni said of Messi.\n\nStill, it’s only natural to think back to one of the defining moments of Messi’s career eight years ago before his life changed in Qatar and his career continued in the United States.\n\nMessi has come so far since the Copa America final on June 26, 2016 – when he missed a penalty kick in a shootout and broke down in tears on the field. He abruptly retired from international play.\n\n“The national team is not for me,” a crushed Messi said. “I have decided to end everything here.” Still, it’s only natural to think back to one of the defining moments of Messi’s career eight years ago before his life changed in Qatar and his career continued in the United States.\n\nMessi has come so far since the Copa América final on June 26, 2016 — when he missed a penalty kick in a shootout and broke down in tears on the field. He abruptly retired from international play.\n\n“The national team is not for me,” a crushed Messi said. “I have decided to end everything here.”\n\nMessi was criticized around the world, the most by his own people in Argentina who believed he was incapable of leading the country to soccer glory again despite his individual accolades and club success with FC Barcelona.\n\nThe heartbreaks and losses he endured — like losing to Germany in the 2014 World Cup final, and Chile in the 2015 and 2016 Copa finals — molded him.\n\n“Without a doubt it was [most painful] because it was already the third final defeat in a row,” Messi said to Varsky about the 2016 loss to Chile.\n\n“We had had a very good Copa América in terms of play, reaching the final being far superior to the rest. In the final against Chile, although we did not have many clear chances, we were also superior in terms of play and we lost again on penalties.”\n\nScaloni added further perspective, saying Chile’s Copa América titles and Argentina’s titles at Copa América 2021 and the World Cup in 2022 have no bearing on Tuesday’s match.\n\nAnd, of course, it was Messi’s birthday.\n\nThere’s plenty to celebrate, and much for Argentina to focus on.\n\n“I think it’s very important to have him here. Everyone is asking about the future and the past, but it’s a lovely present. The present is very important,” Scaloni said.\n\n“He’s enjoying his birthday, and we want him to have a good time.”"
