        "text": "It could be said that Leo Messi is a player who came into the world with soccer DNA. The azulgrana was born with talent inserted in his veins, a talent that has made the player rise to the great altars of this sport. The striker was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario (Argentina). From his beginnings, he did not have it easy given the growth problems he suffered. However, his story shows that nothing is impossible.\n\nOn the other hand, he belongs to the select group of the one man club. The footballer has dedicated his entire life to what is considered to be the team of his life, FC Barcelona, with which he has achieved what seemed impossible for any footballer, breaking records and winning individual and collective titles everywhere. Leo Messi's trajectory is as follows:\n\nGrowing pains at Newell's Old Boys and arrival at FC Barcelona.\n\nLeo Messi began his sporting career in 1994, when he joined the youth teams of Newell's Old Boys. In the Rosario team, he began to stand out from the rest, a boy who had the ability to dribble his opponents with astonishing ease and make a difference. A player who, despite being very young and physically small, showed great potential.\n\nOne of Leo Messi's biggest setbacks came at the age of 11, when he was found to have a growth hormone deficiency. Undoubtedly, a handicap that would prevent him from continuing doing what he likes and loves the most: playing soccer. Coming from a humble family economically, he could not afford the treatment to combat this disease and most of the clubs that were interested in having him join their quarries, backed out.\n\nHowever, there was one club that trusted Leo Messi, more than anyone else, and that would be FC Barcelona. If he passed the tests with Infantil A, Barça would be willing to pay for his full treatment, and so it was, satisfying both parties.\n\nWell, his signing would take place in December 2000, with Carles Rexach (in charge of FC Barcelona's youth system at the time) in charge of the operation and meeting with Leo Messi's closest circle.\n\nMaking a difference at La Masia\n\nLeo Messi's great seasons at La Masia allowed him to move up through the ranks very quickly. In 2001 he started the official season with the Infantil A, the team with which he finished it. In 2002 he was promoted to the Cadete A, with which he also completed the year. However, from his promotion in 2003 to the Juvenil A, his development was voracious. In this category he remained only 5 months, moving to Barça C, which no longer exists and where he was for a minimum time, only one month, moving on to the second highest category of FC Barcelona, the B.\n\nHis time in the reserve team lasted 1 year and 7 months, being part of the first team from the 2004/05 season. In short, Leo Messi took relatively little time to reach the senior team. In the youth team, he played 107 games and scored 105 goals, very striking data.\n\nDuring this stage of development and evolution, he would be one of the most outstanding players at La Masia. A player who had the ability to knock down a couple of players in his path with great ease and superiority. In addition, as teammates he had players who are currently part of the elite of world soccer, such as Gerard Piqué or Cesc Fábregas.\n\nMaking history with the first team\n\nLeo Messi's official debut would come on October 16, 2004 against Espanyol, and his goal-scoring debut would be on May 1, 2005 against Albacete through a Vaseline, after receiving a great assist from Ronaldinho. After these key dates, the rest would be history.\n\nThe Argentinean has a total of 687 official matches in his locker, with 55,504 minutes under his belt. In all of them, he has scored a whopping 603 goals and 242 assists. In addition, in his collective track record he has won 10 Leagues, 6 King's Cups, 8 Spanish Super Cups, 4 Champions League, 3 European Super Cups and 3 Club World Cups.\n\nOn the other hand, at an individual level, he has also been a resounding success, winning 5 Golden Balls and 5 Golden Boots, among other records in a long list.\n\nAn enviable trajectory for any soccer player. A story of overcoming of Leo Messi, a child with growth problems who has become one of the greatest soccer players in history and captain of FC Barcelona and the Argentina National Team.\n\nNo crown with Argentina\n\nLeo Messi has also made a great number of achievements with Argentina. Despite only winning the gold medal at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, he has managed to reach three finals with his national team: two Copa America finals lost to Chile (2015 and 2016) and one World Cup final lost to Germany (2014). It is also noteworthy that he is the top scorer with his nation, with 68 goals, surpassing Batistuta (54 goals) and Sergio Agüero (40 goals).\n\nHis history with Argentina is one of love-hate. On the one hand, in his early days with the Albiceleste, the RFEF tried to convince Messi to play for Spain, but there was no way and he opted for his country of birth. On the other hand, we must highlight the negative side, the numerous times he has received harsh criticism in Argentina and the occasions on which Messi has considered leaving the national team for good.\n\nIn addition, the FC Barcelona player has had to bear the pressure of his constant comparison with Diego Armando Maradona, accusing the public that he cannot be the best in history until he wins a World Cup, as Diego himself did.\n\nBiography by José Manuel Mármol."
