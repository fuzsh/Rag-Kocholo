In his life, he overcame his lack of money, physical limitations, and disadvantaged upbringing to become the greatest football player in history. There are a lot of people who blame their financial situation and says it prevented them from taking action, that I lacked the means to advance, or that I was physically insufficient and was not qualified for the position. Those who regularly blame their luck by inventing all sorts of excuses and accepting what occurs in life as God's will. But this superstar footballer was different from all. He beat all the odds of his life and aimed to be one of the most celebrated footballers worldwide, and he succeeded.\n\nLionel Messi, one of the world's greatest football players, is an example I gentle conduct. Friends, Messi's life story is also one of a person who overcomes all the challenges on his path.\n\nSome information about Lionel Messi is as follows -\n\nName (Real Name) Lionel Messi Profession Argentine professional footballer Nationality Argentina Professional debut in football August 4, 2004, against Hungary jersey number 10 Zodiac Aquarius Coach/Mentor Salvador Aparicio, Frank Rijkaard, Pep Guardiola Position Forward Hometown Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina Religion Roman Catholic Date of Birth 24 June 1987 Name of the father Jorge Horacio Messi Name of the mother Celia Maria Katchitini Name of the brothers Mattias Messi and Rodrigo Messi are their brothers. Name of the sister Maria Sol Messi Name of his wife Antonella Roccuzzo Date of marriage June 30, 2017 Messi son name Thiago Messi and Matteo Messi\n\nLife and Struggle\n\nDespite being from a middle-class family and being born in Argentina on June 24, 1987, Lionel Messi frequently had a difficult upbringing. His mother was a working woman and his father, Jorge Messi, was a steel mill manager. Messi's parents were passionate football supporters, which led to their kids developing a love for the sport at an early age.\n\nIt may surprise you that Messi first showed his love and enthusiasm for football at a very young age. Messi's father encouraged him to attend a local football training club at the age of just five after noticing the young player's ability so that he could learn the game well and develop into a massive football star.\n\nMessi's father would teach him personally after seeing that his son had a desire and talent for the game. George maintained Leo's training; He performed as a model dad by doing everything he could to raise his son despite financial constraints. At the age of just 8, Lionel Messi was accepted into the football team known as the New Wales Old Boys because of his outstanding soccer skill. Where everyone turned to look at him because of his extraordinary abilities while playing, Messi's charm drew the interest of significant and prominent football teams at such a young age.\n\nHe was a huge football fan. He used to work on himself constantly. Every day, he was getting better. He started playing when he was just eight years old, during that very young age when he got the football in his strike and the players who were playing beside him. It would have taken around 15 to 20 minutes to take the football away from him. The local populace used to throw money for joy when they saw his game. His potential as a football player was evident to his family. He was really content with his life. He was enjoying it immensely. He wanted to play football professionally when he grew up, so he represented his country.\n\nBecause of Messi, the Argentinean government was compelled to pass a novel law a few years ago. As a result, no parent in Argentina was permitted to name their child Messi. Due to Messi's excessive fame, the administration believed Messi's name would be given to many kids, and identity issues might result from that. It was a future-focused decision. The government officially announced this news. Right now, the name Messi cannot be used as a middle name for children. Messi's name and resume are well-known to everybody. But the suffering Messi endured made him Messi.\n\nHis worldwide fan base is in the millions. Over the years, football players and spectators have looked up to this outstanding and skilled player. Barcelona FC now has distinct fame due to its outstanding football success. His football skills are amazing. He gets large audiences to watch his games. Because of his football expertise, the audience is intrigued by Messi's background and success story. Naturally, Messi was not without his flaws. But he never stopped working to overcome them. He is currently one of the most well-known, highly compensated, and elite football players in the world due to his efforts.\n\nFamily and Early Years of Lionel Messi\n\nOn June 24, 1987, Lionel Messi was born in Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. He is also known as Lionel Andres Messi by full name. Messi's admirers jokingly refer to him as Leo, atomic flea, la pulga, la pulga Atomica, and Macedonia. His father, Jorge Horacio Messi, was a manager who worked at a steel mill. His mother, Celia Maria Cuccittini, was a housewife. Messi has two brothers, Rodrigo Messi is the older brother, and Matisse Messi is the name of his younger brother. He also has a sister Maria Sol Messi.\n\nEven though Massey's home was cash-strapped but his father remained adamant. He said he would provide his child with every amenity that would advance him. Messi loved to play with his elder brothers when he was younger. Messi loved spending time with his grandma as a youngster, who was always there to support him.\n\nHe also received his first football uniform at the insistence of his grandma. At that time, his grandma wished for Messi to play football. At age 4, he became the first member of the neighborhood football team Granddoli. His grandmother always motivated him by saying \"One day, Leo, you'll be the best football player in the world.\"\n\nMessi's Battle\n\nAt the age of 4, Messi joined his first football team. Then, at 8, he began participating in football games for Newell's Old Boys in Rosario, his hometown. Football had already surpassed all the importance for Messi at this point. He once maintained an unbroken practice schedule day and night.\n\nFootball had been a source of inspiration for him. When Messi was ten years old, his grandmother passed away. Messi had jolted. For a few days, he didn't even touch the football. But afterward, persuaded by his father, he picked up football again. Even when Messi goals today in a football match, he lifts both hands in memory of his grandma. Messi used to work as a storage server of tea and coffee during his spare time, after his football practice. So that he can also aid his family financially. Messi had a significant obstacle to overcome at the age of 10 when he was detected with Growth Hormone Deficiency. It was his significant ailment at the time of his diagnosis. It had halted his height's progress.\n\nThe procedures and treatments needed to treat his disease that was very expensive. Messi's family was not as well-off financially for him to bear the cost of such an expensive therapy. Despite the ruckus, Messi never felt defeated or frustrated. Even though his playing was always of the highest caliber compared to other youngsters his age, his height was not growing, but he was still doing quite well at football. Messi's medical bills are around $1000per per month, which was covered by insurance for two years.\n\nMessi, though, never gave up. He never allowed his spirits to falter, not even in the face of difficulties. He also never gave up and made an effort to advance constantly, and Messi never lost hope after facing several hardships in life.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nMessi has a longterm girlfriend named Antonella Roccuzzo. She is a model and a trained dietitian by profession. He had a long-term romantic connection with her, and they supported each other in all thick and thins. They have two children together. Thiago Messi (was born on November 2, 2012) and their second child Mato Messi Ruccuzzo( was born on September 11, 2015). These two were not married th the time they became parents. Messi and Antonella Roccuzzo were partners for several years before getting married on June 30, 2017. Before their marriage, they had both these kids. They had a daughter after getting married and named her Ciro Messi Roccuzzo.\n\nInitial Achievements\n\nMessi made his debut in the year 2000 and 2005 game seasons, breaking the record for the youngest player to ever play in the league and becoming the league's youngest goal scorer. Messi never looked back after that. Messi played for Argentina in the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 2006 and the Argentine Olympic football squad; Messi won his first international honor-an Olympic gold medal-in Beijing in 2008. Messi had a wealth of talent, and everyone used to go wild seeing him play his game with such precision.\n\nMessi had a total of 49 goals scored during the 2009 campaign. One of Maradona's admirers of Messi exclaimed, \"I see myself in Messi.\" Messi created history by scoring 200 La Liga goals at the age of just 25. He also made history by being the first football player to win the Tea Drinks award twice in a row.\n\nLionel Messi makes his FC Barcelona Debut.\n\nBarcelona had heard about Messi and his battle. Someone informed FC Barcelona director Carles Rexach about his unbeatable talent in football. Then he added a stipulation that only applied if this guy proved to be talented. Therefore, all of his costs will be covered. He must, however, depart Argentina and travel to Spain. Messi's parents relocated to Barcelona.\n\nCarles Rexach saw Messi's game. He believed Messi had the talent and the drive to excel as a football player. Nevertheless, despite everything, nobody wanted to invest much money in a 13-year-old kid due to the exorbitant cost of Messi's care and other expenses.\n\nAfter significant consideration, he chose to back Messi. He didn't change anything and scribbled the contract on a napkin. Additionally, he made the offer to handle Messi's medical care. Messi joined the youth academy of the Barcelona team and is now credited for developing the talented footballer via training.\n\nLionel Messi made the correct choice to take advantage of this opportunity. When he entered the club's changing room for the first time. Everyone was so dubious due to his diminutive height. After a couple of sessions, that uncertainty became a surprise. Messi advanced fast in Barcelona's framework. He started polishing his skills under the proper guidance. His therapy was also ongoing at the time. On one leg, injections would be given in every seven days. The following week on the opposite leg.\n\nLionel Messi - First International Match for Barcelona Club\n\nFirst International Game for Barcelona Club, Lionel Messi earned his on-field appearance in 2003 when he was 16 years old and started playing for the Barça team. The Porto club was ahead of them. He was delighted by the instructor when he appeared before the crowd in his very first game. He was relentlessly pushed, yet he still scored sixes on four defenders. At the tender age of 18, he made his first appearance for his country against Hungary on August 17, 2005. He didn't look back after that. He kept raising the banner of achievement. Maradona, a legendary Argentine player, saw Messi play. He then declared- \"I'm aware of that player. Who will play Argentine football in my place? Messi is his name. I can see hints of myself in his game\".\n\nLionel Messi Has Great Footballer Ronaldo's Support\n\nOne of the most favorable events for Messi was when he had the opportunity to work alongside a great player like Ronaldo. Messi's performance at the time blew Ronaldo away. He also mentioned Messi that One day, this youngster will exceed me. Together, they contributed to numerous victories for Barcelona.\n\nMessi mentions Ronaldo in his statement, as I've mentioned before. He taught me a lot of things. I learned from what he did for me. For that, I shall be eternally thankful to him. I had the opportunity to use the same changing room as a renowned athlete. I usually feel fortunate for this. His smile will be in my memory forever.\n\nLionel Messi's Achievements and Records\n\nEvery year, Messi's performance improved. His outstanding performance during the 2008-09 season helped Barcelona win various titles for the third time. Messi's name is in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most goals scored in a year in 2012 that year; he scored 91 goals. He broke the record held by legendary German player Gerd Muller. In 1972, Muller made a record mark by tallying 85 goals in a calendar year. Messi scored his 200th La Liga goal at the young age of 25, becoming him the youngest player to do so. He broke a milestone by becoming the first player to get four FIFA Awards in a row.\n\nAdditionally, he is the first athlete to receive three European Golden Shoes. On February 16, 2013, Messi took the field for Barcelona. His 300th goal was scored. In Spanish La Liga, he is the only player with 300 goals. Argentina reached the World Cup final in 2014, thanks to his captaincy. He received the honour of the Golden Ball in recognition of his outstanding achievement.\n\nWith a total salary of $127 million in 2019, Messi topped the list of Forbes's highest-paid athletes in the world. In addition, Messi established other records that no player will find it simple to break them.\n\nWorld best footballer for 7th time\n\nIn July 2021, Messi led Argentina to the Copa America Cup championship. He scored four goals, which put him in a tie for the team lead. He assisted in five goals being scored while there. In addition, Messi led Barcelona in goals scored in the Spanish division of La Liga. However, the team came in third. For Barcelona, he scored twice in the Copa del Rey championship.\n\nIn 2021, Messi won the Ballon d'Or trophy for the most outstanding player for a record seventh time. The French football magazine \"Ballon d'Or\" has granted this award to the finest footballer every year since 1956, even though covid-19 made it impossible to conduct the ceremony the previous year.\n\nNet Worth\n\nMessi has frequently been coveted to play for other football clubs with significant funds. But he has consistently been committed to Barcelona FC. He is among the world's highest-paid football players. His annual base compensation was reportedly 16 million euros in 2018. Additionally, he is worth 110 million euros. After basketball player LeBourne James and football legend Cristiano Ronaldo, this demonstrates that Messi is the second-best-paid athlete in the world and the third highest-paid soccer player. Being regarded as the greatest football player of all time, he has emerged as the public face of huge brands like Turkish Airlines, Adidas, Pepsi, and EA Sports.\n\nLionel Messi Controversy\n\nHe was discovered to have been engaged in the following controversies:\n\nHe was under scrutiny in 2013 for possible tax evasion. His identity was also disclosed in the 2016 Panama Papers data breach.\n\nIn addition, he was the subject of criticism after declaring his retirement from international football due to his defeat at the Copa America competition.\n\nMessi was arrested off the football pitch in July 2016 after a Barcelona court found him and his father guilty of three tax fraud charges. During the four-day trial, Messi and his father argued that they had not broken any laws and were unaware of tax fraud. He received a 21-month sentence, nevertheless. According to Spanish legislation, Messi and his father would have to pay a fine of 2 million euros if the charges were suspended within two years instead of going to jail.\n\nIn this way, he experienced various difficulties throughout his professional life.\n\nWe may learn from Lionel Messi's life how someone can achieve success by conquering the challenges in his path with willpower and talent. However, you must pay attention, and when anything awful happens in your life, you should care about finding a solution rather than panicking."
