The Scottish Energy Strategy (2017) sets out a commitment to maximise economic recovery from the North Sea and to encourage new exploration in the North Sea. The Programme for Government (2019) confirmed that continued support for exploration and recovery will be conditional on the sector’s actions to help ensure a sustainable energy transition.

Oil and gas are Scotland’s principal sources of fuel and power, making up 78.8% of all energy consumption, accounting for 91.3% of all heat demand and almost all energy consumption in transport (Scottish Government, 2019a).

Between 2011 - 2018 forty-two new fields have started production (Table a). There are a number of fields for which consent has been granted but production has not started (Table b).

There is extensive infrastructure associated with oil and gas developments including seabed and platform-mounted production facilities and networks of pipelines (Table c) bringing oil and gas ashore for processing. The shore-side reception facilities include the gas terminal at St Fergus (Aberdeenshire) and the Sullom Voe oil terminal (Shetland), the largest oil terminal in Europe. There are three interconnector pipelines in the south west which take gas across the Irish Sea.

As production declines efforts have turned to decommissioning, which has commenced, albeit slower than originally anticipated. The increase in operational efficiency has helped to halve operating costs and boost production, as well as extend the field life on many mature fields causing decommissioning to be postponed. Seventeen projects have been postponed since 2016’s survey to outside the timeframe as operators have successfully extended field life.

Sustained efficiency improvements and cost reductions could defer cessation of production (COP) and therefore push back decommissioning in some cases, while the low oil price environment and access to infrastructure issues might expedite it in other cases. For example, over the last 12 months, 33 assets within the timeframe on the UKCS have deferred COP, 72 have brought forward COP, while for 135 COP remains unchanged. Since 2011 some fields have stopped production or are being decommissioned, for example the Beatrice (Moray Firth), which now hosts wind turbines.

In February 2018, in partnership with Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise, Scottish Government commissioned Westwood Energy Group to produce the Offshore Floating Asset Decommissioning Market Study (HIE, 2018) which explores decommissioning opportunities in the oil and gas sector. Funding and assistance to enhance the capability of the Scottish supply chain was also made available, with the aim of making Scotland a world leader in decommissioning. Scotland's network of ports (Scottish Energy Ports Capability Directory) offer a range of infrastructure, facilities, skills and supply chain to support the oil & gas, decommissioning, subsea and renewables industries.

While oil and gas continue to make a significant contribution to Scotland’s energy security during the transition towards net zero emissions economy, the Scottish Government aims for renewables to meet 50% of the energy for Scotland’s heat, transport and electricity consumption by 2030 (Scottish Energy Strategy, 2017).

Figures a to e give a more detailed breakdown of production in the Scottish sector. Figure d in particular highlights the significance of production in the East Shetland Shelf, Fladen and Moray Firth Offshore and Long Forties Offshore Marine Regions. Table d highlights the overall associated revenues.

In addition to the contribution from oil and gas extraction, are the services that support the extraction of oil and gas. The support activities are largely exploration and test drilling, but also look ahead to oil and gas decommissioning, where there is substantial potential for economic growth. Scotland’s Marine Economic Statistics (Scottish Government, 2019d), which includes the direct contribution of these support activities, but not the oil and gas extraction, report that Oil and gas support activities are the largest contributors of turnover and GVA in the marine economy (see Figure f).

The 77.2 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2018 represents 95% of UK crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production, and 62% of UK natural gas production. The approximate sales value of this was estimated at £24.8 billion, accounting for 88% of the UK total.

The future is mainly centred on significant discoveries not yet developed in areas under current licence (Figure g) or regions where oil and gas can be expected to be found but has not yet been explored.

The Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) Pathway to a Net-Zero Basin: Production Emissions Targets Report 2020 includes a commitment to halving operational emissions in the next decade to 2030. It outlines that this target will be achieved through changes to operations, progressive reductions in flaring and venting, and major capital investment programmes aimed at using electricity, rather than gas, to power offshore facilities. The Scottish Energy Strategy (2017) recognises that maintaining domestic oil and gas production can lead to lower net global emissions than under a scenario where Scotland depends more on imports.

There is a significant opportunity for integrating the UK offshore energy, which includes closer links between oil and gas and renewables, can reduce carbon emissions from oil and gas production and longer term actively support delivery of net zero ambitions through technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage. The UKCS Energy Integration project, led by the Oil and Gas Authority will look to develop a new strategic vision of the UKCS as an integrated energy basin.

Figure g: Undeveloped discoveries with Scottish Marine Regions and Offshore Marine Regions (November 2019). Source: OGA.

The longevity of the industry will depend on commodity prices, exploration and operational costs over the medium to long term and the ability to secure investment to fund new exploration and extraction activities.

According to Oil & Gas UK, its Vision 2035 strategy could deliver revenues of up to £920 billion through the period of 2016-35, compared with £630 billion without any intervention. Of this total, £420 billion would come from production in the UKCS, and the remaining £500 billion from supply chain increasing its turnover by capturing a larger share of export markets (Oil and Gas UK, 2019a).

The Oil and Gas Authority estimate there to be over 250 fixed installations, over 250 subsea production systems, over 3,000 pipelines (Figure h), and approximately 5,000 wells which will need to be decommissioned (OGA, 2016) although not all in the Scottish sector of the UKCS.

Figure h: Underwater pipeline.

Oil & Gas UK estimates that the industry will spend £15.3 billion over the next decade on decommissioning on the UKCS. Of this spend, 48% will take place in the central North Sea (OMR Long Forties, Fladen and Moray Firth Offshore), 30% in the northern North Sea (OMR East Shetland Shelf), 7% west of Shetland (OMR North and West Shetland Shelf) and 15% in the southern North Sea (not part of this assessment area) (Oil & Gas UK, 2018a).

A potential new activity will be the use of depleted fields to store carbon dioxide captured onshore (see CCUS section)​. When the geological conditions allow, depleted fields can be used as sites for the storage of gases, although this has not yet been developed in Scottish waters.

The skills and knowledge developed in the North Sea are still vital for the oil and gas sector but are also increasingly valuable to other energy sectors, such as CCUS, hydrogen, offshore wind and wave and tidal.
