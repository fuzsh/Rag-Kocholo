        "text": "AS DUSK falls, Grangemouth starts to glow. Cloaked in clouds of steam and lit by flares like giant candles, Scotland’s biggest oil refinery has a strange beauty. Situated roughly halfway between Edinburgh and Glasgow on the Firth of Forth, the 700-hectare petrochemical complex is a vital hub of UK oil production. Should Scotland vote for independence, it will be one of the new government’s key assets.\n\nAccording to the industry, there are between 15 and 24 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas left under the North Sea. About 42bn barrels have been extracted since production began there in 1967. Because prices have risen, 24bn barrels could be worth £1.5 trillion – more than the value of all the oil and gas extracted so far. “That gives us one of the best financial safety nets of any country in the world,” the Scottish government says. If the UK’s Trident nuclear submarine base moves from the river Clyde after independence – as Scottish nationalists say it must – then prospecting off the west coast could begin too. It is currently banned in case it interferes with naval operations there.\n\nThere will be a few other tricky issues to resolve, like where the lines are drawn to demarcate which fields belong to an independent Scotland and which to the UK, and how the £35-£50bn cost of decommissioning old oil rigs would be divided up.\n\nUltimately the plan is to emulate Norway, and invest at least some of the created wealth for the future. Scotland’s first minister, Alex Salmond, has promised to put aside about £1bn a year, with the aim of generating a £30bn oil fund over a generation.\n\n“Alex Salmond promises to put aside about £1 billion of oil money a year, to create a £30 billion fund”\n\nNorway’s equivalent, the Norwegian Pension Fund Global, has amassed over £500bn from oil and gas revenues since it was set up in 1990. It is the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund and owns 1.3 per cent of all the world’s listed companies.\n\nAccording to Bjørn Vidar Lerøen, an adviser to Norway’s industry body, Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, there was political consensus on the fund from the start. “The oil belongs to the people and revenues from oil production shall be used to build a better society,” he says. The Norwegian fund has a wide-ranging ethical policy that forbids investments in more than 60 companies involved in tobacco, arms, environmental or human rights abuses. Ironically, it is now reviewing whether to disinvest from fossil fuel companies because of the damage they do to the climate.\n\nBut there is one way in which Scotland would probably not be able to copy Norway&colon; the Norwegian government’s 67 per cent ownership of the oil company Statoil. “To try to nationalise companies would not be politically possible either in Scotland or the UK,” says Uisdean Vass, an oil specialist at legal firm Bond Dickinson in Aberdeen.\n\nPerhaps the biggest conundrum, though, is the climate. According to WWF Scotland, burning 24bn barrels of oil and gas could put more then 10bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – more than 120 times Scotland’s current annual emissions. “The science is clear,” says the environmental group’s director, Lang Banks. “The planet certainly can’t afford to allow all the oil left in the North Sea to be burned.”\n\nRead more&colon; “Four futures for an independent Scotland“\n\nThis article appeared in print under the headline “Oil and gas is at heart of Scots’ future wealth”"
