        "text": "With wide-ranging applications in commercial, financial, transportation and industrial sectors, Oil and natural gas are two resources that drive the world economies.\n\nThe global offshore drilling market size stood at 32 billion US dollars in 2018 but is expected to cross the 90 billion mark by the end of this decade.\n\nIn this article, let us review the 10 biggest offshore drilling giants.\n\n1. Schlumberger\n\nThe biggest offshore drilling company, Schlumberger is a prominent name in the maritime energy sector. It has a worldwide presence in more than 120 countries and employs over 100,000 professionals including technicians, engineers and research personnel working closely for developing industry-changing technologies that are safer and cleaner.\n\nIt was established in 1926 by Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger, two brothers hailing from Alsace, France. Since then it has come a long way by carving out its name as the highest revenue generator among all its competitors and offering reliable services to its international clients. The company recorded annual revenue of around 48 billion dollars in 2017. It is headquartered in Paris, France and has branch offices in Houston, London and the Hague.\n\nIt collaborates with international oil companies offering services like data processing, testing of oil wells, site evaluation, drilling and lifting operations etc. It also provides consultatory and management services.\n\nThe company has completed the biggest projects in Saudi Arabia, Libya, Turkmenistan and Russia, nations with the world’s largest oil reserves. It has a complex structure and subsidiary companies in Panama, the Netherlands and the British Virgin Islands.

It aids in locating the reservoir sites, manages data, undertakes drilling works, constructs oil wells and oversees the management of the asset. In fact, most of the major hydraulic fracturing contracts are bagged by Halliburton.\n\nIt also offers geothermal management services including directional drilling and non-portland cement systems. The enterprise uses advanced logging techniques to identify geothermal reservoirs and fractures. It carefully employs pressure drilling to reduce lost circulation. Most importantly, it is known for the usage of novel stimulation methods for enhancing the productivity of the asset.\n\nThe company states its mission of providing affordable solutions and underlines the need for transitioning into a low carbon future by combining technological expertise with efficient use of available resources.\n\nIn the last three years, it focussed on the complete digitisation of oilfield technologies for boosting operational efficiency by providing real-time information to its clients regarding the status of their projects.
