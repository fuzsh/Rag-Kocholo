        "text": "Production and Trade\n\nProduction on the UKCS is currently split roughly 60:40 between oil production and natural gas production (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4. UK Oil and Net Gas Production [2].\n\nSource: NSTA based on DESNZ data\n\nThe data presented in Figure 4 above are available on request from the UK EITI Secretariat.\n\nNet natural gas production equals gross production less producers' own use, that is the gas used in the course of production of oil and gas and therefore not available for sale to end users. The NSTA publishes data relating to production of UK oil and gas, including production data for individual fields, production and expenditure projections and data on UK upstream oil and gas income and expenditure.\n\nCombined oil and gas production volumes from the UKCS peaked in 1999 at 4.5million boe/day and declined to 1.4 million boe/day by 2014 – a consequence of natural reservoir decline in existing fields combined with fewer/smaller developments. Between 2014 and 2019, however, this trend was reversed and production on the UKCS increased to 1.7 million boe/day before falling to 1.4 million boe/day in 2023.\n\nTable 1. Data on the volume and value of UK oil production and trade\n\nNYA=not yet available\n\nSources: Energy Trends Table 3.10 (DESNZ, March 2024), DUKES 2023 Table 1.2 (DESNZ, July 2023) and (for production values) NSTA estimates\n\nTable 2. Data on the volume and value of UK natural gas production and trade\n\nNYA=not yet available\n\nSources: Energy Trends Table 4.2 (DESNZ, March 2024), DUKES 2023 Table 1.2 (DESNZ, July 2023) and (for production values) NSTA estimates\n\nThe data presented in Tables 1 and 2 above are available on request from the UK EITI Secretariat.\n\nIn 2022 domestic production of oil was equivalent to around 61% of UK oil consumption including non-energy demand and marine bunkers (down from 72% in 2021); gross domestic production of natural gas was equivalent to 54% of UK natural gas consumption (up from 42% in 2021).\n\nThe two charts below show, respectively, the destinations of UK oil production and the sources of UK oil supply. Most UK oil production is exported and most UK refinery supply comes from imports.\n\nFigure 5. Destination for total UK primary oil production, 2016–2022\n\nSources: DUKES 2023 (DESNZ July 2023)\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 above are available on request from the UK EITI Secretariat.\n\nFigure 6. Ways UK refinery demand was met by imports and UK production, 2018-2022\n\nSources: As figure 5.\n\nThe data presented in Figure 6 above are available on request from the UK EITI Secretariat.\n\nThe UK benefits from diverse and flexible sources of gas supply. The UK has one of the largest and most liquid gas markets in Europe, with extensive import infrastructure and a diverse range of gas supply sources: pipelines from Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands, domestic production, and the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals to bring in gas from around the world. Figure 7 below shows the sources of UK gas supply in recent years. These can change quickly and significantly.\n\nFigure 7. Sources of Annual UK Gas Supply - year to date\n\nSources: Energy Trends (DESNZ, March 2024)\n\nThe data presented in Figure 7 above are available on request from the UK EITI Secretariat.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 8, below, production of oil from existing fields typically declines over time as reservoir pressure falls. For overall production to increase generally requires several large fields (or major incremental projects in existing fields) to come onstream. Failing that, overall production will continue to decline.\n\nFigure 8. UK oil production by year of field start-up\n\nSource: Petroleum Production Reporting System, (NSTA, April 2024)\n\nThe data presented in Figure 8 above are available on request from the UK EITI Secretariat.\n\nThe UK is still a significant oil and gas producer, being responsible for 0.7% of global production of oil and 0.8% of global production of natural gas in 2023, when the UK was the 26th largest producer of oil and gas (24th largest of oil and 22nd largest of gas) [3].\n\nGovernment Revenues\n\nIn addition to taxation, the extractive sector in the UK pays relatively small amounts to government by way of licence fees and other levies. These payments are summarised later in this report.\n\nThe level of government revenues from taxes on production of oil and gas is dependent on rates of taxation and adjusted profitability which is driven by a combination of production volumes, commodity prices and cost levels. Historical data by financial year since 1976/77 on upstream oil and gas taxes, including petroleum licence fees, are shown in constant price terms in Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10. Government Revenues from UK Oil and Gas Production\n\nSource: NSTA, Government revenues from UK oil and gas production (March 2024)\n\nThe data presented in Figure 11 above are available on request from the UK EITI Secretariat.\n\nThe overall totals reflect both the combination of Ring Fence Corporation Tax (RFCT)/Supplementary Charge (SC) and Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) and of net payments and receipts by individual companies. The overall net repayments reflect the low level of oil (and gas) prices and companies’ varying exposure across their portfolios to the four main phases of upstream activity (exploration, development, production and decommissioning).\n\nA few companies paid significant amounts, many paid nothing and some received significant repayments of tax paid in previous years. In future years, with the permanent zero-rating of PRT from the start of 2016, net PRT receipts will be negative, with the carry-back of largely decommissioning-related losses resulting in significant repayments of PRT paid in previous years.\n\nUK Government accounts are compiled on a financial year basis and the figures reported are consistent with annual totals reported in them on a cash basis.\n\nTable 3 includes estimates of the amounts of RFCT plus SC paid annually in respect of UK upstream oil and gas production activities, i.e. the exploration and productions stage (described for simplicity as “offshore” CT), of Energy Profits Levy (EPL) and of PRT.\n\nIn addition to the cash receipts series published by HMRC that is tabulated below, tax receipts are also reported by the ONS on an accruals basis. The accruals basis shows when the tax liability arises, i.e. it matches the taxes arising to taxable income as it is earned. There is usually a timing difference between when the tax liability arises and when it is paid. Tax is usually paid after the liability arises so the tax cash payments in one time period may not match the tax liability for the same period.\n\nFor example, a tax liability of £120 million may arise in one tax year (£120 million recorded on an accruals basis); this may be paid in three equal instalments, two in the same tax year (£80 million recorded that year on a cash basis) with one final instalment the next tax year (£40 million recorded in the next tax year on a cash basis). Over a longer timeframe, the same amounts are captured by these two different mechanisms of recording payments, but in the short term there will be a mismatch in amounts. This results in different series being published for corporation tax receipts/repayments. Table 3 below therefore also includes receipts on an accruals basis.\n\nTable 3.

For example, the Onshore Allowance (an allowance against the SC which ensures that otherwise economic developments are not uncommercial) is applicable to both new conventional oil and gas as well as to shale gas developments. As PEDLs do not grant automatic rights to operations such as drilling or hydraulic fracturing, any company looking to develop shale will also need to obtain all necessary permissions, like planning and environmental permits.\n\nTo date, a range of measures specific to hydraulic fracturing and the shale industry have been put in place to ensure that exploration is safe and environmentally sound. The Infrastructure Act 2015 specifies thirteen conditions that need to be met before a hydraulic fracturing consent will be issued, including public notification and a scheme to provide financial or other benefit for the local area. The government has also put in place regulations which ensure that high-volume hydraulic fracturing cannot take place within 1,200 metres beneath the surface of National Parks, the Broads, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, World Heritage Sites and areas that are most vulnerable to groundwater pollution.\n\nFollowing its analysis of hydraulic fracturing operations in 2018, the Oil and Gas Authority (now the North Sea Transition Authority) has found that it is not currently possible to accurately predict the probability or magnitude of earthquakes linked to fracking operations. On this basis, and following the significant disturbance that has been caused to local people following seismic events in August 2019, caused by further operations at Preston New Road, Lancashire, on 2 November 2019 the BEIS Secretary of State announced a moratorium on fracking with immediate effect.\n\nOn 4 November 2019, Ministers issued a Written Ministerial Statement that sets out the Government’s position – namely that Government will no longer be supporting further hydraulic fracturing activities in England at this time. The statement sets out that there will be a presumption against Ministers issuing further Hydraulic Fracturing Consents, which would only be altered if compelling new evidence comes to light.\n\nPetroleum licensing functions are devolved to the Welsh Ministers. The Welsh Government petroleum policy, published via a written statement on 10th October 2018, is to not undertake any new petroleum licensing in Wales, or support applications for hydraulic fracturing petroleum licence consents.\n\nWritten Ministerial Statement\n\nAward and transfer of licences in Great Britain and on the UKCS\n\nThe NSTA works to maximise economic recovery of the nation’s petroleum resources. The government has essential pre-requisites for licence applicants, such as requiring the would-be licensee to have a fixed place of business within the UK.\n\nLicences are awarded during regular competitive onshore and offshore licensing rounds once the NSTA has been satisfied that the licensee has met the necessary technical and financial requirements [5]. This method of licensing aims to optimise recovery of the UK’s remaining petroleum resources. Out-of-round licence applications are possible but only in exceptional circumstances. Further Information on licensing activity is available on the NSTA website. Licensing rounds are announced in the Official Journal of the European Union and assessed against a publicly announced set of criteria[6].\n\nEach licence takes the form of a deed, which binds the licensee (either a single company or several working together and bound under joint and several liability) to obey the licence conditions regardless of whether or not they are using the licence at any given moment. The NSTA (and DECC previously) regulates the transfer of licence interests in order to enforce its policy objectives. A company that is party to a licence may wish to sell its interest or a part of it, to another company. It requires the NSTA’s permission to do so [7].\n\nLicence applications and interests attract fees and charges payable by the applicant or licensee. Each licence carries an annual charge, commonly called a rental. Rentals serve the double purpose of incentivising licensees to work their whole licensed areas and to surrender acreage they do not intend to exploit. Rentals are due every year on the licence anniversary and are charged at a variable rate on each square kilometre that the licence covers at that date. The rates are set out in the licence document at award. Payments are made to the NSTA only by licence administrators (typically operators, who recoup the payments from the licensees in proportion to their interests in each licence) so the reconciled amounts reported in Table 4 in the Payments Data section do not reflect the extent to which payments to the NSTA are spread between licensees.\n\nOnshore licensing was devolved to the Scottish Government on 9 February 2018 and to the Welsh Government on 1 October 2018. The power to set the consideration payable for a licence remains reserved by the UK Government as does the power to revoke licences. The NSTA has the responsibility for administering licences on behalf of the UK Government. Scottish licence information for onshore licences, onshore fields and onshore wells is published on the Marine Scotland website. In Wales licences are not yet published online, however information at petroleum licences can be requested, free of charge, by post or email. All licences and appropriate associated documents will be published online during 2021.\n\nLicence conditions and types of licences\n\nEach licence contains detailed terms and conditions, but not all regulation is contained in the licence. The Petroleum Act 1998 requires these conditions — called model clauses — to be published first in secondary legislation except in particular cases [8]. In recent years, the model clauses have also been set out in full in the licence document.\n\nProduction licences are valid for a sequence of periods, or terms. These terms mirror the typical life cycle of a field: exploration, appraisal and production, and provide that each licence will expire automatically at the end of each term, unless the licensee has sufficiently progressed to warrant a move into the next term. The duration of each term depends on the type of the licence.\n\nThe NSTA publishes additional information about the different types of licences, their normal duration and different phases of the licensing lifecycle.\n\nWhile landward licences confer the right to search for, bore and extract petroleum on areas under licence, they do not exempt the licensee from other legal or regulatory requirements, including a need to obtain access rights from landowners or planning permission from relevant local authorities, or to conform to health and safety regulations.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, there is only one type of petroleum licence, this has broadly similar terms and conditions to onshore Petroleum Exploration and Development Licences (PEDLs) in Great Britain but also some differences.\n\nThe MSG does not believe there are any non-trivial deviations in the award or transfer of licences for 2020 or previous years.\n\nLicensing Review\n\nThe review into the future of offshore oil and gas licensing has concluded that a formal climate compatibility checkpoint building on current practice should be established. This will help ensure that any future licenses are only awarded on the basis that they are aligned with the government’s broad climate change ambitions, including the UK’s target of reaching net zero by 2050. A climate compatibility checkpoint will allow for an orderly transition, underpinned by ongoing production of oil and gas as long as we still require it domestically, while the sector increasingly bears down on its production emissions, and pivots to support the energy transition. The government has committed to designing the new checkpoint by the end of 2021\n\nPRT allowances\n\nA number of allowances used to be available under the PRT regime to prevent an excessive PRT burden falling on smaller, more economically marginal fields. Oil Allowance was the only one that was still relevant to years immediately prior to 2016. Oil Allowance ensures that many small fields are effectively free from PRT. The available amounts are converted each chargeable period into a “cash equivalent” which then reduces the liability to PRT.\n\nRFCT allowances\n\nCapital allowances\n\nCapital allowances are a feature of business taxation in the UK and apply to the mainstream CT regime (as well as to income tax). For CT purposes, the general rule is that capital expenditure is not allowed as a deduction for tax purposes. This means that profits chargeable to CT cannot be reduced by depreciation or similar expenses. The capital allowance regime exists to provide some relief for capital expenditure incurred.\n\nThere are specific rules and rates of allowances available for companies carrying on a ring fence trade. These allowances mean that in practice, virtually all capital expenditure incurred by oil and gas companies for the purposes of their ring fence trades will qualify.\n\nThere are three types of allowance which are commonly relevant for companies carrying on a ring fence trade. Research and Development Allowance (RDA), Mineral Extraction Allowance (MEA) and Plant and Machinery Allowances (PMA). RDA and MEA are primarily relevant to companies incurring capital expenditure on exploring for, appraising and gaining access to oil and gas during the pre-production phase. PMAs are available on capital expenditure on items of plant or machinery used in the ring fence trade. Mostly these are 100% First Year Allowances (FYAs), which allow the full amount of the expenditure to be written off for tax purposes in the accounting period in which the expenditure is incurred [9].\n\nRing Fence Expenditure Supplement (RFES)\n\nRFES is designed to assist companies that do not yet have sufficient RFCT profits against which to set their exploration, appraisal and development costs. The RFES currently increases the value of unused expenditure carried forward from one accounting period to the next by a compound 10% a year for a maximum of 10 years (6 years prior to 2014). The company can elect which periods it wants to claim RFES for. They do not have to be consecutive years. The Oil Taxation Manual provides further guidance on Ring Fence Expenditure Supplement.\n\nResearch and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC)\n\nRDEC is a tax credit available to companies operating in all sectors. It is generated by spend on research and development, and is claimed as a tax credit. There are a number of ways in which a company can receive payment of their RDEC claim, including offsetting against another of its tax liabilities and receiving a cash repayment.\n\nMore information on RDEC can be found in HMRC guidance and statistics on RDEC can be found here.\n\nFor EITI reporting purposes, tax payments/repayments are reported exclusive of any adjustment for RDEC.\n\nSC allowances\n\nCluster Area Allowance\n\nLegislation in the Finance Act 2015 introduced a new Cluster Area Allowance, which aims to support large development projects in areas of high pressure and high temperature, encouraging exploration and appraisal in the surrounding area (or “cluster”). The allowance is generated by incurring capital expenditure, and certain types of operating and leasing expenditure within the cluster area. The value of the allowance is 62.5% of the qualifying expenditure incurred. Any allowance generated is carried forward year on year until it is activated. Allowance is activated by production income from the cluster area. Once the allowance has been activated it is set against profits subject to the SC, so that any such profits are only subject to RFCT at 30%. Cluster areas are determined as such by the OGA, and the only area determined to date is the Culzean Cluster Area in the Central North Sea.\n\nOnshore Allowance\n\nThe Onshore Allowance was introduced in Finance Act 2014 to provide support for the early development of onshore oil and gas projects which were economic but not commercially viable at the prevailing tax rates. The onshore allowance covers both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons and replaces all existing field allowances for onshore projects. The allowance works in a similar way to Cluster Area Allowance: it is generated by capital expenditure, in an amount equal to 75% of that capital expenditure. Once the allowance is activated by production income in relation to an onshore site, the allowance is used to reduce the adjusted ring fence profits which are subject to SC.\n\nInvestment Allowance\n\nThe existing system of offshore field allowances was replaced by a single Investment Allowance in Finance Act 2015. Similarly to the Cluster Area and Onshore Allowances, the Investment Allowance is generated by capital expenditure, and certain types of operating and leasing expenditure incurred in relation to a qualifying oil field. The amount of allowance generated is equal to 62.5% of qualifying expenditure. Investment Allowance is activated by production income from the field, unlike Cluster Area Allowances, which can be activated by income from any field in a designated cluster. Once activated, it is used to reduce the adjusted ring fence profits chargeable to the SC.\n\nLosses\n\nWhen a business makes a loss, it may be able to get relief for that loss through the tax system. Loss relief is not unique to the oil and gas regime: it is a feature of income tax, mainstream CT and other regimes too. Broadly, loss relief works by allowing a loss made in one period to be set off, in certain circumstances, against profits in the same or other periods.\n\nPRT\n\nPRT is a field-based tax, so loss relief is normally available only against profits from the same field. A loss can be carried back and set against profits of the field in previous periods, most recent period first, or carried forward to set against future profits, earliest period first. The loss is set against the profit before Oil Allowance. Only once, following cessation of production, all carry back and carry forward options are exhausted for that participator and there are no further profits against which the loss can be set, can the loss then be relieved against profits of earlier participators in the field. If there are still any unrelieved losses, they can be relieved against profits from another field.\n\nWhere a field has made an assessable profit, and paid tax in one period, and then has subsequently made a loss and the participator has chosen to carry the loss back, it could generate a repayment of tax.\n\nRFCT\n\nWhere a company makes a loss for RFCT purposes, it can also choose how to treat that loss. The default position is that the loss is carried forward to set against future profits of the ring fence trade. However, the loss can also be set off against other (non-ring fence) profits arising in the year, or it can be carried back to set against the profits earned in previous years. Alternatively, where a company is part of a corporate group, it can surrender the loss to another company making a profit in the same period.\n\nUnder the normal rules, losses can be carried back only against profits arising in the previous year. However, these time limits are extended where the trade has ceased, in which case the loss may be carried back up to three years. For ring fence trades, this time limit may be extended further where the loss is incurred as a result of decommissioning expenditure. In such situations, the loss may be carried back to any period ending on or after 17 April 2002, regardless of whether trade has ceased.\n\nSC\n\nSC is calculated on the same basis as RFCT, but with adjustment for finance costs resulting in ‘adjusted ring fence profits’. However, there is no loss relief for SC per se. Rather, if a company makes a RFCT loss, and elects to carry it forward or backward, it will reduce the RFCT profits, and therefore the adjusted ring fence profit subject to SC of the subsequent or previous period will also be reduced, potentially to nil, generating a repayment of SC where SC has already been paid.\n\nPRT Payments\n\nPRT instalments are due based on the previous chargeable period. From 2016, as the PRT rate was reduced to nil, PRT payments were only made to true up previous year’s liabilities or instalments made prior to the announcement of PRT being zero-rated at the 2016 Budget.\n\nRFCT/ SC payments\n\nThe rules for payment of RFCT and SC differ from the payment rules for mainstream CT. Payments of RFCT and SC are made in three equal instalments: 6 months and 13 days from the start of the AP, 3 months from the first instalment due date , and 14 days from the end of the AP. These payments are in addition to non-ring fence CT payments which will remain payable under the quarterly instalment payments (QIPS) regime.\n\nDecommissioning\n\nDecommissioning is an inherent cost of doing business in the UKCS. As a result, tax relief is given for decommissioning costs but not until they are incurred and the decommissioning is carried out. For accounting purposes a company is required to make an annual provision. However, this cannot be deducted for tax purposes as the cash has yet to be spent, and the decommissioning has not actually happened.\n\nIf decommissioning expenditure produces an overall loss for a year then, as explained above, the loss may be carried back against previous ring fence profits of that company, as far as 2002 for RFCT and SC, and almost indefinitely against field profits for PRT. Losses generated by decommissioning costs and carried back to be offset against previous profits are relieved at the RFCT and SC rates to which those earlier periods were subject to. However, SC relief is subject to a further restriction [10].\n\nIn most cases, the maximum rate of tax relief for PRT fields is 75%, but again is dependent on the prevailing tax rate in the period the losses are carried back to. The amount of relief available is limited to the taxable profits of the relevant field/company and in economic terms, represents a repayment of tax that has been overpaid through the profitable life of the company or field.\n\nHMRC's latest estimate of the likely cost to the Exchequer, based on current estimates of decommissioning costs, is £21.8 billion [11].\n\nDecommissioning Relief Deeds (DRDs)\n\nIn 2013, following extensive discussions with industry, the Government introduced legislation giving it the statutory authority to sign contracts (DRDs) with companies operating in the UKCS. The aim of the DRD is to provide certainty over the availability of decommissioning tax relief for the purposes of putting up security against the risk of default.\n\nThe DRD works by guaranteeing the tax relief due on decommissioning expenditure, based on the relief available at Finance Act 2013 (FA13). It allows a company to claim a payment from the Exchequer if, as a result of changes to the tax system, the relief available to the company on its decommissioning expenditure is less than that which would have been due under the rules as at FA13 (however, this does not apply if the relief is less due to changes in tax rates.)\n\nThe DRD will also pay out to a company that picks up the decommissioning liabilities of another company that has defaulted under its Petroleum Act 1988 obligations – for example if the company becomes insolvent – to ensure that the company incurring the default expenditure is able to get relief. This provides industry with certainty over the availability of decommissioning tax relief in future years and has unlocked additional investment capital in the UKCS by allowing companies to provide security for their decommissioning liabilities on a post-tax basis.\n\nEach year the Treasury reports to Parliament the number of Deeds it has entered into that year, the total number of DRDs in force, the number and amounts of any payments made under the Deeds and an estimate of the maximum amount liable to be paid.\n\nEnergy Profits Levy\n\nWith effect from 26 May 2022, the Energy (Oil and Gas) Profits Levy Act 2022 introduced a new, temporary 25% levy on companies producing oil and gas in the UK or on the UK Continental Shelf. The Autumn Statement 2022 announced several changes to the EPL that would take effect from 1 January 2023. These include increasing the rate of EPL to 35%, extending the end date of the EPL to 31 December 2028 and introducing a new 80% Decarbonisation Investment Allowance. The levy applies to a company’s ring fence profits computed for ring fence corporation tax purposes, but with a number of adjustments. It is charged as if it were an amount of corporation tax, and so the administration of the levy mirrors that for corporation tax.\n\nIn summary, the adjustments to profits are:\n\n• financing and decommissioning costs are added back in\n\n• repayments of PRT arising from decommissioning are left out of account\n\n• an 29% allowance for investment expenditure is deductable\n\n• an 80% allowance for decarbonisation expenditure is deductible\n\nLoss relief is available within the levy regime, but there is no cross over to any other ring fence taxes. Levy losses can be relieved through i) carry back of 12 months against previous levy profits (3 years for terminal losses), ii) carried forward to set against future levy profits, and iii) group relief in year to another company in the group with levy profits.\n\nOn 9 June 2023, the government announced the EPL Energy Security Investment Mechanism (ESIM). It will mean that EPL will remain in place until March 2028 unless the average oil and gas prices, over a six-month period, are at or below the ESIM price thresholds (calculated using a 20-year historic average at the end of 2022), these are set at $71.70 per barrel for oil and £0.54 per therm of gas. If that happens, the tax rate for oil and gas companies will return to 40%, the rate before EPL was introduced.\n\nAt Autumn Statement 2023, the government published a technical note setting out the practical application and technical detail of the ESIM."
