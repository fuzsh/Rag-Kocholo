        "text": "An opportunity for Scotland\n\nThe three scenarios helped explore hydrogen’s production usage, transportation. This has enabled us to explore the extent to which hydrogen can play a role in Scotland’s net zero economy. The distinct nature of the three scenarios enables the boundaries and potential future outcomes of hydrogen to be tested and explored, providing different pathways to inform policy development and action taken at government level.\n\nA socio-economic assessment was developed to quantify the benefits of each of the three scenarios and shared qualitative insights into the potential opportunities for wealth and job creation. In the most ambitious scenario, establishing Scotland as an exporter of green hydrogen to Europe has the potential to be worth up to £25bn a year to the Scottish economy, creating more than 300,000 jobs by 2045. This helped clarify the opportunity and capability within Scotland to use hydrogen to meet net zero ambitions whilst creating and protecting jobs that provide huge economic potential.\n\nShaping a net zero path\n\nOur work is helping the Scottish Government assist its agencies to shape the hydrogen policy agenda in the next few decades as we progress to net zero. The assessments outcomes have been used to inform the Scottish Government Hydrogen Policy Statement. This sets out Scotland’s vision to become production leaders of reliable, competitive, and sustainable hydrogen to underpin the energy transition."
