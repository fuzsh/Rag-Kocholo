        "text": "PE Limited (also known as Petex) has been at the vanguard of oil and gas field modelling since its inception in 1990. The twin concepts of integrated modelling and digitalisation have revolutionised how oil companies throughout the world approach complex development decisions and production problems.\n\nPE Limited is taking the experience gained over these years as a platform for substantial future expansion. As part of this, the company is relocating its HQ to Guildford. An office has been purchased and is currently being refurbished to high standards with capacity for many additional staff. We believe that we are at the cusp of a new phase in the development of the company, in which we will utilise the expertise gained in energy transition technologies and, ultimately, to technological advances in other industries."
