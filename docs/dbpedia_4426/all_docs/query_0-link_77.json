        "text": "Between 2012 and 2022, oil production in the United Kingdom fluctuated between about 750,000 to 1 million barrels a day with a slight downward trend starting in 2020. The volume of gas flared and the flaring intensity in the United Kingdom fell by about half during this period (figure 1.). The total volume flared remained largely steady from 2012 to 2017, after which it began to fall. The flaring intensity has been on a declining trend since 2014. There were 72 individual flare sites in the most recent flare count, conducted in 2022.\n\nFigure 1. Gas flaring volume and intensity in the United Kingdom, 2012–22\n\nThe United Kingdom endorsed the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative in 2020. It also participates in the Global Methane Initiative, the Global Methane Pledge, and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition. In September 2022, the United Kingdom submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and reiterated its commitment to reducing economywide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the 1990 level by at least 68 percent by 2030. In June 2019, the government amended the Climate Change Act, 2008, to increase the reduction in the “net UK carbon account” below the 1990 baseline by 2050 from 80 percent to at least 100 percent. The updated NDC remains consistent with the government’s new net-zero policy.\n\nFlaring and venting have been subject to the secretary of state’s consent for decades, per Section 12 of the Energy Act, 1976. Over the years, other legislation has been enacted that also covers flaring or venting. Between 2008 and 2016, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (now the Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy) provided flaring and venting consents on behalf of the secretary of state. The Energy Act, 2016, transferred certain powers from the secretary of state, including the issuance of consents for flaring and venting, to the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), which was formed in 2015 within the Department of Energy and Climate Change. The OGA changed its name to North Sea Transition Authority in March 2022 but the term OGA continues to be used, as many legal and regulatory documents still refer to it. With the passage of the Energy Act, 2016, the OGA became an independent regulator. It is a government company, limited by shares under the Companies Act 2006, with the secretary of state for business, energy, and industrial strategy the sole shareholder.\n\nSince its creation, the main objective of the OGA—its so-called Central Obligation—has been maximizing the economic recovery of oil and gas resources on the UK continental shelf (UKCS). This objective, known as Maximizing Economic Recovery of UK Petroleum (MER UK), was established as a government priority in 2015 and was the driver for creating the OGA. MER UK became legally binding with the Infrastructure Act, 2015. The Energy Act, 2016, charged the OGA with pursuing MER UK.\n\nIn February 2021, after a review by Parliament, the OGA’s new strategy became legally binding for oil and gas companies licensed to operate in the United Kingdom. The new strategy expands the Central Obligation and adds assistance to the secretary of state in meeting the net-zero target by reducing GHG emissions as far as possible from sources that include flaring and venting.\n\nThe North Sea Transition Deal, published in March 2021, illustrates how the 2021 strategy is guiding the offshore oil and gas sector. One of the pillars of this deal is decarbonization targeting a 50 percent reduction in GHG emissions from oil and gas production by 2030. This white paper—a co-product of the tripartite partnership of the government, the OGA, and the offshore oil and gas industry—is not legally binding.\n\nThe compatibility of the original and the new components of the new Central Obligation—maximization of oil and gas production and decarbonization—is not readily apparent. However, an analysis by the Committee on Climate Change identified reducing flaring and venting as well as methane leakage by means of better leak detection and repair as the lowest-cost options for reducing GHG emissions within the oil and gas industry. Historically, although flaring and venting have accounted for less than 1 percent of total GHG emissions in the United Kingdom, they have accounted for nearly 25 percent of oil and gas industry emissions, mostly from flaring. The rest of the emissions in the oil and gas industry are primarily from captive generation of electricity for the industry’s own use. The OGA’s data suggest that the flaring intensity is high for a relatively small group of facilities. This information is used in benchmarking to improve their performance.\n\nThe North Sea Transition Deal commits to developing a methane action plan. The Methane Action Plan 2021 and Methane Action Plan Guidelines 2022 were subsequently published. The plan commits the offshore oil and gas industry to a 50 percent reduction in methane emissions by 2030 relative to a 2018 baseline. It has six actions, the fourth of which aims to meet the goal of the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring before 2030 initiative with individual assets seeking to accelerate compliance where possible before 2030. The actions include a commitment to comply with zero routine flaring and gas recovery in all newly built facilities installed on the UKCS after 2025. In March 2021, the OGA released the Net Zero Stewardship Expectation 11, reflecting these and other priorities. In June 2021, the OGA released updated guidance on flaring and venting, consolidating and replacing previous guidance, tightening rules for issuing and monitoring consents, and aligning source categories with the Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.\n\nThe United Kingdom was one of the first countries to support the Global Methane Pledge. Between 1990 and 2020, methane emissions in the United Kingdom declined by 62 percent, more than any other member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development according to the United Kingdom Methane Memorandum, introduced at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP27) in November 2022 and referenced in the latest NDC. Although most of the reduction was from the waste management sector, the energy sector contributed the second-largest reduction, most of it due the closure of coal mines. Emissions from the gas distribution network were reduced by 50 percent, primarily by replacing old iron pipes with plastic pipes. Methane emissions from the upstream oil and gas operations fell about 60 percent between 1990 and 2006, mostly due to declining production but also owing to flare gas recovery systems and other actions. Since 2018, methane emissions have been further reduced thanks to improvements in flare and venting management, replacement of leaky seals, and investment in flare gas recovery systems."
