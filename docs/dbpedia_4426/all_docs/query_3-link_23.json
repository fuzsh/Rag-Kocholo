        "text": "During 2015 we invested £254 million in the UK North Sea.\n\nWe have an interest in nearly 40 producing oil and gas fields in the UK.\n\nWe are responsible for approximately five per cent of UK oil and gas production, supplying the UK and international markets with an average of 80,000 barrels of oil and 441 million cubic feet of gas a day.\n\nThe principal ExxonMobil subsidiary involved in offshore operations in the UK is Esso Exploration and Production UK Limited.\n\nExxonMobil has been a major investor in the UK's offshore oil and gas industry since the first exploration activities in the North Sea began in 1964. Combined investment from that time is the equivalent to nearly £33 billion at today's prices.\n\nEsso is one of the largest investors in the UK offshore industry. Investment in the North Sea is managed through a 50/50 joint operation with Shell. In the early days of North Sea exploration, Esso and Shell decided to pool their financial, technical and managerial resources and to share equally the risks and profits of a joint operation in the North Sea. Shell U.K. Exploration and Production was designated the operator in an agreement that was signed in April 1965. Shell is still the designated operator for many of the fields in this joint operation.\n\nExxonMobil does not have any interests in onshore oil and gas fields in the UK."
