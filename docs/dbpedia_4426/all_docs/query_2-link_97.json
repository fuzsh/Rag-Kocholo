Concomitant to the acceptance of the commitments, the CMA terminated its investigation, with no decision made on whether or not the Competition Act 1998 (the Act) had been infringed.\n\nDecision to accept binding commitments from Certas Energy UK Limited and DCC plc (PDF, 591 Kb) (24.06.14)\n\nPress release: CMA accepts commitments to improve access to road fuels market in the Western Isles (24.06.14)\n\nOn 22 May 2014, the CMA published a Notice of intention to accept modified commitments offered by Certas Energy UK Limited and DCC plc and invited representations from interested third parties on the proposed modifications to the commitments previously offered by Certas and DCC.\n\nNotice of intention to accept modified commitments offered by Certas Energy UK Limited and DCC plc (PDF, 517 Kb) (22.05.14)\n\nPress release: CMA consults on stronger commitments to improve access to road fuels market in the Western Isles (22.05.14)\n\nBackground\n\nIn January 2013, the OFT launched a formal investigation into the distribution of road fuels in the Western Isles of Scotland by GB Oils Limited (‘GB Oils’). On 27 September 2013, GB Oils changed its name to Certas Energy UK Limited (‘Certas’). The investigation was under Chapter II of the Act and related to suspected abuse of a dominant position. The investigation did not relate to excessive pricing and was not prompted by the OFT’s previous review of pricing, Petrol and Diesel Pricing in the Scottish Islands.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, the OFT undertook a number of investigative steps to gather evidence from Certas and other third parties. These steps included the sending of formal notices requiring documents and information under section 26 of the Act to a number of parties, and obtaining further substantive evidence through meetings, telephone conferences, and witness interviews with relevant individuals.\n\nIn July 2013, the OFT took the decision to extend its investigation of Certas’ conduct in the Western Isles to cover certain matters in the Shetland Islands. In March 2014, the OFT closed its investigation of Certas’ conduct in the Shetland Islands for reasons of administrative priority. Having assessed the evidence that it had gathered to date, and taking into account the significant differences between the road fuels markets in the Shetland Islands and the Western Isles, the OFT considered that the likelihood of further investigation of Certas’ conduct in the Shetland Islands resulting in a successful case outcome did not justify the expenditure of the significant resources that such further investigation would require. The OFT stated that if any new evidence was provided to it, then that decision would be reviewed.\n\nOn 18 March 2014, the OFT published a Notice of intention to accept binding commitments offered by Certas Energy UK Limited and DCC plc in relation to the Western Isles and invited representations from interested third parties on that proposed course of action. Responsibility for the investigation passed to the Competition and Markets Authority (‘the CMA’) on 1 April 2014. In May 2014, Certas and DCC proposed modifications to the commitments that they had previously offered.\n\nOn 22 May 2014, the CMA published a Notice of intention to accept modified commitments offered by Certas Energy UK Limited and DCC plc and invited representations from interested third parties on the proposed modifications to the commitments previously offered by Certas and DCC.\n\nFurther to consideration of the representations received in response to the two consultations described above, the CMA accepted commitments, which address its competition concerns, on 24 June 2014.\n\nOffice of Fair Trading related documents\n\nPress release OFT consults on action to encourage greater competition in the road fuels market for the Western Isles (18 March 2014)\n\nNotice of intention to accept binding commitments offered by Certas Energy UK Limited and DCC plc (pdf 509kb) (18 March 2014)\n\nQuestions and answers relating to the proposed commitments and the OFT consultation (pdf 17kb) (18 March 2014)\n\nTeam leader\n\nBrian Jackson (020 3738 6546, brian.jackson@cma.gsi.gov.uk)\n\nProject director\n\nJames Macbeth (020 3738 6958, james.macbeth@cma.gsi.gov.uk)\n\nSenior responsible officer"
