But the volatile fossil fuel energy system is failing the planet and pushing millions of people in fuel poverty.\n\nFor a society powered by renewable energy\n\nWe are working to end this political and financial support, to challenge their greenwashing and to hold polluters to account for the harm they are causing. Action must be taken to speed the shift away from fossil fuels. As a nation that built its wealth on fossil fuels, the UK must act fast.\n\nThere can be no new fossil fuels if we are to meet our climate goals. Our governments must rapidly scale up renewable energy and create decent green jobs."
