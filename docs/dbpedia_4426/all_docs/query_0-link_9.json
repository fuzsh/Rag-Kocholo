        "text": "Like many forms of fuel, gas oil is derived from crude oil that has been extracted from the ground. The crude oil is pumped out from below the earth’s surface to produce a thick, black liquid commonly known as petroleum. Through the process of distillation, crude oil transforms into a variety of fuels, depending on how it is distilled.\n\nThe lightest of these components will rise to the topmost part, while the heaviest settle at the bottom, which is how crude oil is transformed into gasoline, kerosene, and finally diesel. The ‘leftovers’ is what gas oil is made from.\n\nThe refining process of red diesel does not differ greatly from road diesel. The red dye is added to the final product to give it its distinct colour and make it easily recognisable against colourless road diesel. The red dye alerts HMRC inspectors to any misuse of the off-road fuel.\n\nGas oil is designed to support fuel users that need a relatively inexpensive source of fuel for specific off-road operations. Since the introduction of duty equalisation in April 2022, users of red diesel are limited to:\n\nTravelling fairs and circuses\n\nFuel used for non-commercial purposes – electricity generation and heating\n\nAgriculture, horticulture, fish farming and forestry\n\nRail transport\n\nCommunity amateur sport clubs and golf courses\n\nSailing, boating and marine transport (excluding private pleasure craft in Northern Ireland)\n\nAs it is a ‘rebated fuel’, gas oil has a lower fuel duty than regular road diesel and, as such, can only be legally used by certain industries in specific circumstances. For more information on who is affected by red diesel reform and how, visit the Beyond Red Diesel section of our website.\n\nYes – as gas oil is a rebated fuel and offers cost savings on fuel duty, its use is stringently regulated and it is clearly stipulated that gas oil is only to be used for specific purposes and industries.\n\nGas oil must not be used in any non-permitted vehicle or machinery and to use it in such a way is a criminal offence. Some farm vehicles are able to use gas oil when travelling on public roads between farms, but the distance must not exceed 1.5km and both pieces of land must be owned by the same person. Additionally, vehicles used to grit roads in icy conditions are permitted to use gas oil whilst carrying out the gritting.\n\nIndustries that traditionally relied on red diesel cannot use the rebated fuel, including the construction sector. Heavy plant and equipment of all kinds, including NRMM (non-road mobile machinery), can no longer run on gas oil when used for commercial purposes.\n\nOther industries and applications impacted by the red diesel law changes include leisure, manufacturing, mining and quarrying, oil and gas extraction, road maintenance, airport and seaport operations, plant hire, logistics and waste management, any commercial heating, and haulage—refrigeration units on HGVs are also prohibited from running on red diesel. Agricultural vehicles, however, are exempt from the rule changes, and can continue using red diesel as before, as long as they use it in accordance with the updated law.\n\nIf your business is no longer permitted to use red diesel reform – or if you would like to explore cleaner fuels – check out our guide to alternative fuel options.\n\nWhilst gas oil and road diesel are primarily the same type of fuel, road diesel does have a slightly higher cetane rating and can be more efficient for road vehicles. Both fuels can be used in the same way but, as explained, gas oil can only be used in accordance with government legislation. Using gas oil as an alternative to road diesel outside of the regulations is subject to significant fines.\n\nAs well as standard white diesel/DERV, there are cleaner diesel alternatives that are becoming increasingly available, including OEM approved fuel, GTL Fuel (Gas-to-Liquid), and renewable diesel Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), (dependent on usage, duty may still apply). Both fuels can help lower emissions and accelerate businesses’ net zero ambitions.\n\nGas oil and kerosene are both commonly used as heating solutions but gas oil is no longer permitted to be used for commercial heating purposes, following the legislative changes in April 2022.\n\nKerosene is a low viscosity oil that has a range of commercial uses. Also known as 28-second oil, paraffin or kero, this pale, yellow or clear fuel oil has a lower viscosity and lower freezing point than gas oil. It also has a longer shelf-life, making it a reliable oil for many industries.\n\nAnother cost-effective, highly-efficient and compliant alternative to gas oil is industrial heating oil or Therma35. It is ideal for use in commercial boilers, heaters, driers and furnaces and requires no equipment modifications. It also offers a long storage life so it can be bought and stored in bulk.\n\nCertas Energy is the UK’s largest distributor of liquid fuel, supplying businesses with reliable fuel deliveries across the UK from its national network of 130 depots.
