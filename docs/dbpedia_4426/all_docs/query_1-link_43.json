        "text": "Foreword\n\nIt has been more than a decade since the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) published its last major inquiry into energy. In this time, a huge amount has changed in the way we produce energy and the way in which we use it. Its importance, however, for the lives of the people of Scotland and for the Scottish economy is undiminished.\n\nThere are important issues about the demand for energy and the ways in which it is used; about the supply of energy and security of that supply; and about the impact of supply and demand on our environment, on the climate, and on the lives of consumers throughout Scottish society and in Scottish business.\n\nWe need to look at the opportunities that energy offers, in terms of innovation and research in areas such as supply, storage and delivery. We must also recognise the interconnected nature of supply and demand, between Scotland, the UK, Europe and, indeed, the wider energy supplying world. This thinking will illuminate the constraints and policy options that are available to those tasked with making the important decisions that will affect us all.\n\nAs Scotland’s National Academy, the RSE is in a unique position of having access to a wide range of expertise, provided by some of the foremost experts in Scotland. Furthermore, the RSE’s status as a renowned, impartial, learned society allows it to utilise this experience and knowledge to produce a considered view of the issues Scotland faces regarding energy and the options available to us.\n\nSince the Inquiry launched in 2017, we have received written evidence from a wealth of sources, held discussions with individuals and groups from across all sectors, and held public meetings up and down Scotland to ensure this report engaged with as many stakeholders as possible. This work was only made possible with the backing of the RSE’s supporters, to whom we are immensely grateful.\n\nWe hope that this combination of expertise, evidence and engagement will allow this report, its findings and its recommendations to continue to inform public policy debate and decision making long past its publication.\n\nIt would be remiss if we did not extend our sincere thanks to the group of Fellows and academics who have served with such distinction on the Inquiry Committee, providing the invaluable knowledge, analysis and insight without which the report would not have been possible. Further information on the Committee can be found in the appendix to this report.\n\nFinally, we would also like to acknowledge the work, and life, of our colleague Professor Paul Younger, who was involved in the early stages of this project, but sadly passed away last year.\n\nSummary\n\nObjectives and approach\n\nNo energy policy, no matter how well-considered, will ever solve all of the problems and paradoxes of energy supply and use.\n\nThose developing policy must ask how best to address the competing issues of the ‘energy quadrilemma’: addressing climate change; ensuring affordability; providing energy security; and developing energy policy which is acceptable to the public, economically sustainable and just.\n\nDecision-makers will need to be honest with the public about what is achievable, what choices must be made, and what changes will need to occur.\n\nGovernance and regulation\n\nSignificant progress has been achieved by the energy governance system for Scotland over the last decade, including the introduction of world-leading climate change legislation.\n\nScotland’s energy system is entering a challenging period of transition as the policy focus shifts towards the difficult task of decarbonising heat and transport, notwithstanding that difficult issues remain for electricity generation, and the oil and gas sectors.\n\nEnergy governance is highly complex, and while there have been significant successes, progress has been hampered by a systemic lack of transparency; weak planning, monitoring and implementation; and problems with delivering cost-effectiveness and protecting consumers’ interests.\n\nA high level of sustained political cooperation between the Scottish and UK Governments is necessary to maximise the effectiveness of the governance structure and to achieve common objectives. The UK Government retains control of the main levers for energy governance, and so key aspects of the Scottish Government’s strategy can only be realised in full with UK Government agreement.\n\nThe energy system must be subject to a continuous process of scrutiny and reform in order to ensure effective governance and regulation. Currently, there is no one official body responsible for the independent, continuous and whole system review of all aspects of energy policy and governance.\n\nWhere we are\n\nThe UK has historically been reliant on fossil fuels to meet its energy needs and, through its leading role in the industrial revolution, was and remains a major contributor to global carbon emissions.\n\nThe majority of Scotland’s energy consumption is attributable to heating, with electricity and transport playing smaller roles.\n\nEnergy consumption in Scotland is falling. However, despite over 89% of Scottish electricity being generated by low-carbon technologies, more than 80% of consumption is still attributable to the burning of fossil fuels, with renewables supplying 17.8%.\n\nThe UK is a net importer of energy and has several options through which to import this energy. In the event of interruptions to energy imports, the UK has very limited storage capacity, especially gas storage.\n\nThe Scottish Government has set targets for reducing carbon emissions, which have been met for the past two years. Further, more ambitious, goals have also been set.\n\nTotal global energy consumption continues to increase, although the types of energy consumed, and the profile of this use, varies significantly by region.\n\nUnderstanding trade-offs\n\nFuture Scottish energy policy will rely on various decisions made by a number of actors, including government, industry, communities and individual members of the public.\n\nUnder all scenarios, Scotland will require energy. Difficult choices, which will inevitably have consequences, must be made.\n\nAll of the choices available to Scotland to meet its energy needs require trade-offs. In reaching an informed decision on Scotland’s energy future, it is imperative that the compromises that need to be made are understood, discussed and accepted."
