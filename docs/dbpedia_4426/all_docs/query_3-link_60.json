        "text": "The quality of the rock drives our business.\n\nWe are not focused on geography. Instead, we go where compelling geology takes us. We have a strong and proven subsurface team that meticulously evaluates every opportunity.\n\nWe are passionate about what we do.\n\nWe come to work every day excited about our industry and work hard to create and grow a high-performing organization.\n\nInnovation is central to the way we think.\n\nOur name says it all. Novo is Latin for “to make new”. We have the conviction and confidence to trust our technical skills and experience and do things differently.\n\nEvery decision we make is deliberate, thoughtful, and designed to deliver value.\n\nWe are technically focused and commercially driven in all we do. Every decision we make is grounded in technical expertise. We don’t speculate. Instead, we believe every decision must be backed by a compelling technical story.\n\n“The path to wisdom is paved with humility.”\n\nWe believe in teamwork and understand that great ideas can come from anywhere in our organization. In fact, we challenge one another to generate new ideas. Everyone is important and no one function or discipline supersedes another. (quote from author Tim Fargo).\n\nWe are good stewards.\n\nWe believe in the responsible use of capital and in protecting people, land, and the environment.\n\nWe are honest and respectful, and we keep our promises.\n\nWe value relationships and treat our contractors, vendors, leaseholders, community partners, investors, and other stakeholders the same way we treat one another. We hold ourselves accountable for our actions."
