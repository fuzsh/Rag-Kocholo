We have won on this . Civil resistance works.\n\nOur new demand: That the UK Government sign up to a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030.\n\nOur governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition.\n\nThis can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty."
