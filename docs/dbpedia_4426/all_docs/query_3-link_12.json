        "text": "Benefits of buying subsea solutions from Scotland\n\nQuality and reliability\n\nScotland's success as a global leader in subsea and low carbon energy is rooted in our legacy of innovation, safety and trust as well as the values that define who we are. Every day, Scotland is winning new work. Major international partners from Abu Dhabi, Brazil, USA, Africa and the Mediterranean, engage Scottish firms because they share the same values for safety, excellence and efficiency.\n\nExpertise and partnership\n\nScotlandâs subsea industry has built a world-leading reputation for underwater expertise, an outstanding work ethic and a customer-first attitude. Access to the Scottish Government, their associated agencies, and academic institutions and trade bodies support the growth of the markets that energy businesses thrive in.\n\nThis means having a voice on key policy issues affecting the industry. When you partner with Scotland, you benefit from a supply chain of over 2000 energy and engineering businesses that are stable, well-funded and responsive.\n\nInnovation and enablers\n\nOver 50% of Scotlandâs subsea output is exported around the world. Hereâs why â energy is in our DNA. Scotlandâs subsea businesses have a passion to innovate. And it is fuelled by industry-leading practices, the latest digital and automated processes and a determination to meet the UKâs governmentâs ambitious goal to reduce carbon emissions by 68% by 2030.\n\nValue for money\n\nMore than ever, Scottish businesses are focused on delivering better, safer and more cost-efficient, higher quality outcomes for global customers. They understand that value for money is essential. Thatâs why there is a real commitment to research and the development of cutting edge technologies that help to drive down costs while delivering maximum value for money.\n\nSuccessful Scottish subsea exporters\n\nXodus\n\nXodus opens in a new window is a global energy consultancy based in Aberdeen. Bringing together a diverse array of talent, it provides energy engineering solutions, support and expertise for businesses with a focus on accelerating the transition to net zero.Â\n\nVerlume Ltd\n\nVerlume Ltd opens in a new window offers two main areas of technology: energy storage and remote power generation. Its products are already fully funded, developed and market ready.\n\nRotech Subsea\n\nAberdeen-based Rotech Subsea opens in a new window develops and operates mass flow and controlled flow excavation technology.
