        "text": "Emissions created by burning fossil fuels should be considered when granting planning permission for new drilling sites, the Supreme Court has ruled.\n\nThe landmark judgment could have “profound implications” for new fossil fuel projects, Friends of the Earth has said.\n\nA campaigner had challenged Surrey County Council’s decision to allow the expansion of an oil well site at Horse Hill, near Horley in Surrey, in 2019.\n\nSarah Finch, acting on behalf of Weald Action Group, argued that the environmental impact assessment carried out before planning permission was granted – which only took into account the impact of extracting the oil – should have taken into account the “downstream” emissions produced when the oil was burned.\n\nIn his judgment, Lord Leggatt said “it seems to me plain” that emissions created by burning oil extracted at the site “are effects of the project”, and as a result “it follows that the council’s decision was unlawful”.\n\nHe said: “The reasons accepted by the council for excluding the combustion emissions from consideration and assessing only direct greenhouse gas emissions from within the well site boundary are therefore demonstrably flawed.\n\n“In my view, there was no basis on which the council could reasonably decide that it was unnecessary to assess the combustion emissions.”\n\nLord Leggatt continued that he could see “no reason why combustion emissions that will occur elsewhere as a consequence of the operation of a project to extract oil should be regarded differently” from emissions generated by extracting the material.\n\nHe also said that while the law did not prevent planning authorities from approving projects which may harm the environment, the authority needed to reach a “reasoned conclusion” on the impact.\n\nBut he said it was “not a valid ground” to argue that the oil being refined elsewhere before being burned meant it did not need to be considered by the council as part of the environmental assessment.\n\nUnder the plans, the oil well site, run by Horse Hill Developments, would have seen the fossil fuel extracted over 20 years, producing around 3.3 million tonnes of oil.\n\nClimate campaign group Friends of the Earth, who supported Ms Finch during the case, estimated last year that the oil extracted from the site would emit more than 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide when burned.\n\nMs Finch said she was “absolutely over the moon” by the court’s decision.\n\n“The oil and gas companies may act like business as usual is still an option, but it will be very hard for planning authorities to permit new fossil fuel developments – in the Weald, the North Sea or anywhere else – when their true climate impact is clear for all to see.”\n\nA lawyer from Friends of the Earth, Katie de Kauwe, hailed the ruling as a “watershed moment”.\n\n“Gas, oil and coal companies have been fighting tooth and nail to avoid having to account for all the climate-harming emissions their developments cause,” she said.\n\n“This judgment will make it harder for new fossil fuel projects to go ahead. They can no longer claim that downstream emissions are someone else’s problem.”\n\nMel Evans, Climate Campaigner at Greenpeace UK, called for “robust government action to bring the UK’s oil and gas sector in line with our climate commitments”.\n\nLawyers for the council claimed that Ms Finch’s approach was “misguided” and that the environmental assessment considered the impact of “direct” greenhouse gas releases.\n\nBut Lord Leggatt dismissed the council’s argument, stating that the environmental assessment showed “inadequacy” and did not allow for public debate on the impact of the plans.\n\nHe said: “It is foreseeable in today’s world that, when development consent is sought for a project to produce oil, members of the public concerned will express comments and opinions about the impact of the project on climate change and the potential contribution to global warming of the oil produced.”\n\nHe continued: “It is not good enough that the potential global warming effect of the proposed development was not ‘completely ignored’.\n\n“The effect should have been properly assessed so that public debate could take place on an informed basis. That is a key democratic function of the environmental impact assessment process. It was not fulfilled here.”"
