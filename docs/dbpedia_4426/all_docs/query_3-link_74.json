        "text": "If you're new to the oil and gas world, or are even just considering an energy-related job at this stage, our \"Oil & Gas Terminology Series\" will help you get clued up with some of the industry's jargon.\n\nWe've compiled our previous series into a single, comprehensive blog with the key terms and acronyms used by the industry. You can use the menu below to navigate this list.\n\nJump To:\n\nA | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z\n\nA\n\nAssociated Gas\n\nNatural gas produced with crude oil from the same reservoir, or that which is associated with oil accumulations, which may be dissolved in the oil at reservoir conditions or may form a cap of âfree gasâ (in a gaseous, not liquid state) above the oil.\n\nAppraisal Well\n\nA well drilled as part of an appraisal drilling programme which is carried out to ascertain the size, reserve and estimated production rate of an oil field.\n\nAntifoam\n\nA chemical additive used to lower interfacial tension so that trapped gas will readily escape from mud and not form a foam. This additive is used during the preparation of a treatment fluid or when preparing the drilling surface (slurry). Common additives include: Octyl alcohol, aluminum stearate, various glycols, silicones and sulfonated hydrocarbons.\n\nTreatment fluid - A fluid designed and prepared to resolve a specific wellbore or reservoir condition. Treatment fluids are generally prepared at the wellsite for purposes such as stimulation, isolation or the control of reservoir gas or water. Every treatment fluid is designed for specific conditions.\n\nSlurry - A term used to describe a mixture of suspended solids and liquids.\n\nAlkaline Flooding\n\nAlso known as âcaustic floodingâ, this is an oil recovery technique in which an alkaline chemical such as sodium hydroxide is injected during polymer flooding or waterflooding operations. The alkaline chemical reacts with the oil, forming surfactants inside the reservoir, which reduce the interfacial tension between oil and water and therefore enable an increase in oil production.\n\nDuring âwaterfloodingâ, water is injected into the reservoir to displace residual oil. The water moves the displaced oil to adjacent production wells.\n\nâSurfactantsâ are compounds that lower the surface tension between two liquids, or two items of opposing states, i.e. between a gas and a liquid, or between a liquid and a solid.\n\nAbrasive Jetting\n\nA wellbore treatment in which a fluid containing solid particles is used to remove deposits from the surface of the wellbore and / or completion components. The fluid is pumped at high pressure through a downhole tool that uses nozzles to direct jets of the fluid onto the target area. Many tools utilise a controlled rotary motion to ensure the entire internal circumference of the wellbore is treated. Abrasive jetting can also be used to cut completion or wellbore components in which case highly abrasive particles (such as sand) are put into the fluid and then jetted at the target area for a prolonged period of time until the surface is eroded.\n\nBack to Top\n\nB\n\nBarrel or Barrel of Oil EQ (BOE)\n\nA unit of energy used to measure the volume of petroleum and related products. Itâs based on the approximate energy released by burning one barrel or crude oil.\n\nBBL\n\nRefers to a barrel of oil. One barrel of oil is approximately 35 imperial gallons or 159 litres. Oil companies typically use BBL to report on their production. You many sometimes see it listed as Mbbl which refers to one thousand barrels or MMbbl which refers to one millions barrels.\n\nBCF\n\nRefers to a billion cubic feet of natural gas. Itâs used to measure the amount of natural gas that is untapped or currently being pumped.\n\nBCM\n\nMeans a âbillion cubic metresâ and is generally used to measure natural gas. One billion cubic metres (BCM) is equivalent to 35.31 cubic feet.\n\nBIT\n\nA drilling tool used to cut a cylindrical hole in the earthâs crust â sometimes referred to as a âdrill bitâ or ârock bitâ. It can be used during the discovery or extraction process of both crude oil and natural gas. The diameter of the hole it creates can vary from 3.5inches up to 30 inches and it can create hole depths of up to 30,000 feet.\n\nBLOCK\n\nA geographical area of land in which an oil or gas reservoir lies. A âBlockâ will be awarded to drilling and exploration companies and the land mass is usually measured in 1000s of sq. kilometers.\n\nBlow-Out\n\nWhen well pressure exceeds the ability of the wellhead valves or drilling mud, which causes oil and gas to 'blow' to the surface â in other words itâs an uncontrolled release of either crude oil and/or natural gas. In some cases, blow-outs can be extremely dangerous â an accidental spark can lead to a fire breaking out.\n\nBlow-Out Preventer\n\nA specialised mechanical device or valve which prevents blow-outs. Itâs used to both seal and monitor the well in order to control pressures associated with drilling oil and gas.\n\nBOREHOLE\n\nThe hole made by the drill, which includes the open hole or uncased portion of the well. It can refer to the inside diameter of the wellborn wall or in other words, the rock face that bounds the drilled hole.\n\nBTU\n\nMeans âBritish thermal unitâ which is a measurement unit of the heating value of a fuel.\n\nBack to Top\n\nC\n\nCAPEX\n\nA companyâs capital expenditure in the current year. Its money the organisation uses to improve its fixed assets such as land, equipment, vehicles or buildings.\n\nCementation\n\nWhen ions in groundwater chemically precipitate and form a new crystalline material between sedimentary grains.\n\nClastic\n\nRocks that are composed of fragments or broken pieces of older rock.\n\nCommercial field\n\nWhen an oil and/or gas field is judged to be worth developing. It means the field is capable of producing enough net income, at low risk, to make it economic for development. The opposite of this is a Marginal Field â this means the oil field may not produce enough net income to be worth development.\n\nCompletion\n\nThe process of making a well ready for production after drilling operations. It usually involves the installation of permanent wellhead and downhole equipment.\n\nCompressor\n\nA mechanical device, such as an engine, used to reduce the volume of gas so it can increase the pressure. This allows the gas to flow more easily through a pipeline or from a reservoir.\n\nContingent resources\n\nQuantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations. However, the project(s) are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development.\n\nConventional Oil\n\nOil found or expected to be found within a conventional reservoir. Usually, it refers to crude oil, petroleum or raw natural gas.\n\nCore and Coring:\n\nA term associated with drilling. Coring is the process in which a continuous cylindrical sample of rock from the wellbore is taken to assess the productivity of oil well drilling. Normally itâs taken in 30 ft sections using a âcore barrelâ tool. This process provides valuable information about the rock being drilled and can be used during the exploration phase.\n\nCreaming Curve\n\nA statistical technique used to present the relationship between aggregated or cumulative resource from wells drilled.\n\nBack to Top\n\nD\n\nDerrick\n\nA tower-like structure where drilling controls and lifting equipment are typically housed\n\nDevelopment Well\n\nA well drilled in a proven area of an oil or gas reservoir with the goal of maximising economic production and recovery of reservoirs known reserves. They are typically drilled to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon that is known to be productive. The probability of success increases as more development wells are drilled. Development wells differ to exploratory wells as they are wider in diameter and drill deeper.\n\nDiscovery\n\nWhen a petroleum accumulation is found following several exploratory wells. Testing, sampling and/or logging the existence of a significant quantity of potentially moveable hydrocarbons must take place before a discovery can be declared.\n\nDownhole\n\nTools, instruments and equipment used in the wellbore or techniques applying to the wellbore.\n\nDownstream\n\nThis term indicates the refining of petroleum crude oil or the processing of natural gas as well as the marketing and distribution sectors of the oil and gas industry.\n\nDrill mud\n\nDrilling fluid that is used to clean and lubricate equipment during the drilling process as well as recover samples of the sub-surface formations to surface whilst counteracting the natural pressure of a formation.\n\nDrilling rig\n\nA drilling component that isnât permanently fixed to the seabed. For example, a drillship or a jack-up unit. The term âdrilling rigâ also can refer to the derrick and its associated machinery. Although this term is usually used in offshore activities, you may also hear it during discussions of onshore for land-based drilling activities.\n\nDry gas\n\nNatural gas composed mostly of methane. It can have minor amounts of ethane, butane and propane and, generally, has little or no heavier hydrocarbons.\n\nBack to Top\n\nE\n\nE&A\n\nAbbreviation for âexploration and appraisalâ\n\nE&P\n\nAbbreviation for exploration and production\n\nExploration - refers to the search for oil and gas; methods can include aerial surveys, geophysical surveys, geological studies, core testing and the drilling of test (wildcat) wells.\n\nAppraisal - The phase of the petroleum project that immediately follows successful exploratory drilling. During appraisal, delineation wells are often drilled to ascertain the size of the oil or gas field and the most efficient method for development.\n\nProduction - The phase that occurs after successful exploration and development â during this time the hydrocarbons start to be drained from the oil or gas field.\n\nEmbrittlement\n\nApplies to drilling equipment whereby steel components become less resistant to breakage and significantly weaker in tensile strength as a result of prolonged exposure to gaseous or liquid hydrogen sulphide. The weakness is caused when hydrogen ions get between the grain boundaries of the steel, where they then form molecular hydrogen â this takes up more space and reduces the strength of the bonds between the grains. Molecular hydrogen can cause metal to crack when subjected to tensile stress. Hydrogen embrittlement can also be referred to as âacid brittlenessâ.\n\nEnhanced oil recovery (EOR)\n\nA process which uses sophisticated techniques to increase the amount of oil that can be recovered from an oil reservoir. It restores formation pressure, and improves oil displacement / fluid flow in the reservoir. There are 3 major recovery types: chemical flooding (alkaline flooding or micellar polymer flooding), miscible displacement (carbon dioxide injection or hydrocarbon injection), and thermal recovery (steamflood or in-situ combustion). Enhanced oil recovery is also known as âimproved oil recoveryâ or âtertiary recoveryâ and it is generally abbreviated to EOR.\n\nExploration Well\n\nA concentrated area where drilling is carried out to determine whether hydrocarbons are present in a particular area or structure. Sometimes known as a âwildcat wellâ, particularly in places where little drilling has taken place previously.\n\nErosion corrosion\n\nA type of corrosion produced when scales such as iron carbonate that initially protected the metal surface of the pipe have become eroded, meaning that the underlying metals begin to corrode - this is a common cause of failure in oilfield equipment and in particular, intersecting pipe sections, bends or elbows where there is high velocity or turbulent flow are most at risk.\n\nBack to Top\n\nF\n\nField\n\nAn area under which a large amount of oil or gas lies. The size of an oilfield can vary hugely in size â some of the worldâs largest, such as the Rumailia field in Iraq, produce millions of barrels of oil every day.\n\nFish\n\nNot necessarily a creature with scales! In the oil and gas world, anything left in a wellbore, be it junk metal (generally remnants of milling operations), hand tools, a length of drillpipe â anything lost down there is simply referred to as âthe fishâ. Anything put into the hole should be accurately measured so that appropriate tools can be used to retrieve the object.\n\nFishing\n\nRefers to the act of retrieving objects from the borehole. For retrieval to be successful, the operation requires an understanding of the dimensions and nature of the âfishâ to be recovered, the wellbore conditions, the tools and techniques to be employed and the process by which the recovered fish will be handled at surface.\n\nFracturing/Fracking\n\nA method of breaking down a rock formation by injecting fluid at very high pressure so as to force open existing fissures, with the ultimate aim of increasing the reservoirâs production rate through making it easier to extract fuel from the field.\n\nFracturing Fluid\n\nFracturing fluids for shale reservoirs usually contain water, proppant, and low levels of nonaqueous fluids designed to reduce friction pressure whilst pumping the fluid into the wellbore.\n\nBack to Top\n\nG\n\nGas Field\n\nA field that contains natural gas only. Sometimes there may be limited producible oil but this is rare.\n\nGas Injection\n\nA process used to maintain reservoir pressure. Separated associated gas will be pumped back into a reservoir for conservation purposes.\n\nGas in Place (GIP) or Gas Initially in Place (GIIP)\n\nBefore extraction or production takes place, GIP or GIIP refers to the quantity of estimated gas that is believed to exist in naturally occurring accumulations.\n\nGas Lift\n\nThe process of raising or lifting fluid from a well by injecting gas through tubing into the well. The injection of gas means the fluid is aerated and less dense, forcing it out of the well bore.\n\nGas Oil Ratio (GOR)\n\nRefers to the number of cubic feet of gas produced per barrel of oil\n\nGatherer\n\nAny person or vehicle (i.e truck or barge) authorised to gather or accept oil, gas or geothermal resources after production or from storage.\n\nGathering Line\n\n(or a pipeline) is located within an oilfield and gathers produced oil and/or gas with the purpose to bring it to a location for further transmission.\n\nGun Barrel Separator\n\nUsed to separate oil, water and gas and is located near the wellhead.\n\nBack to Top\n\nH\n\nHorizontal Drilling\n\nA method of drilling where the drill bit is turned in a horizontal direction (generally with an inclination greater than 85Â°) in an effort to produce hydrocarbons from a number of areas located at the same approximate depth.\n\nHot Oiling\n\nCirculation of heated fluid (typically oil) to dissolve / dislodge paraffin deposits from the production tubing. Paraffin deposits can occur where a large variation in temperature exists across the producing system.\n\nHydraulic Disconnect\n\nA downhole tool designed to allow the lower and upper tool string sections to be parted, which enables the retrieval of the running string. Hydraulic disconnects rely on the application of a predefined pressure through the running string to activate a release mechanism. Sometimes, a ball will be used to block circulation through the tool string, which enables the application of the release pressure.\n\nRunning string - A small-diameter tubing string run inside the production tubing of a well as a remedial treatment to resolve liquid-loading problems. As the reservoir pressure in a gas well depletes, there may be insufficient velocity to transport all liquids from the wellbore.\n\nHydrocarbon\n\nA compound that contains only the elements hydrogen and carbon; this can exist as a solid, a liquid or a gas.\n\nHydrochloric Acid\n\nA type of acid commonly used in oil and gas well stimulation, especially in carbonate formations (rock where the main mineral content is calcite and aragonite). The effects of hydrochloric acid enable it to be used in many treatments, often with chemical\n\nadditives that enhance its performance or allow greater control of the treatment. Treatments are commonly conducted with 15% or 28% solutions of hydrochloric acid.\n\nBack to Top\n\nI\n\nIndustry Mutual Hold Harmless (IMMH)\n\nAn indemnity scheme run by LOGIC in the UK. The scheme was set up with the primary objective of addressing the contractual gap which traditionally exists between contractors and sub-contractors. The IMMH is designed to sit as a background agreement where there has been no direct contract between contractors.\n\nImproved oil recovery (IOR)\n\nProcesses that improve the flow of hydrocarbons from a reservoir to the wellbore. It sometimes refers to the recovery of more oil or natural gas than expected. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is an example of IOR.\n\nInfill Wells\n\nWells drilled into an existing reservoir between wells that are already producing oil/natural gas so the product does not have to travel as far through the formation. The increase in the number of wells per unit area improves recovery efficiency.\n\nInjection Well\n\nA well in which water or gases are injected into the reservoir. Typically this is done to maintain reservoir pressure.\n\nIn-situ recovery\n\nTechniques used to extract hydrocarbons from beneath the surface without removing the soil and other materials.\n\nInternet of Things (IoT)\n\nA system of interrelated physical devices, appliances, machines and more that enable connectivity and shared data without human interaction.

Sometimes, this section can also be called the âlegsâ.\n\nJacking Frame\n\nA hydraulically controlled support structure used to stabilize the injector head and pressure-control equipment on coiled tubing units. They are most commonly found on offshore units but can also be found on some special onshore units.\n\nJackup Rig\n\nAn offshore drilling system commonly used in water depths of 50-330ft. They are made up of a drilling rig, floating barge, and are fitted with long support legs that can be raised or lowered\n\nindependently of each other. If the ocean bottom is firm, an independent leg will be used whereas if the ocean bottom is soft, the rig will be mat supported.\n\nJamin Effect\n\nAn increase in flow resistance, commonly when one (or more) interfaces are present at one time in a channel.\n\nJar\n\nA tool used in drilling or workover and is either hydraulic or mechanical. The tools purpose is to deliver a sharp upward or downward blow to the tools below it. An example of its use is to free a tool or bit that is stuck. A jar accelerator, booster or intensifier can be used to speed up or increase the effect of the jar.\n\nJet\n\nA high-velocity drilling fluid stream from a nozzle or bit. Itâs used to drill a seismic shot hole.\n\nJet Hopper\n\nA mud-flow device, (sometimes called a mud hopper) that is used to feed materials into a jet mixer which is a mechanical blender used to mix a dry material* with drilling mud. The jet hopper is powered by a centrifugal pump that allows the materials to flow at a high velocity.\n\n*Dry materials are added to provide dispersion, rapid hydration and uniform mixing.\n\nJ factor\n\n(sometimes called the pseudo-geometrical factor) is a term used during the well-logging process. Well logging measures the depth and subsurface formation during drilling â the J factor is the response of a logging measurement as a function of distance from the tool.\n\nJoint\n\nA length of pipe, and usually refers to tubing, drillpipe or casing.\n\nJoule-Thomson\n\nThe cooling of gas as it expands. This effect is sometimes called the âthrottling effectâ and can be used to cool produced gas therefore removing natural gas liquids and hydrates.\n\nJunk pusher\n\nA downhole tool that prepares the casing for setting a packer. It works similarly to a casing scraper and ensures the wellbore is unobstructed before setting a packer or similar fullbore device. It is used with a gauge ring.\n\nJunked and abandoned (J&A)\n\nA well that has been abandoned due to a drilling problem.\n\nJ Slot\n\nA type of mechanism commonly used to set and unset downhole tools*, like packers. Itâs named this way because the slot is shaped like a J. The short side supports the protrusion weight and the long side is open to release the protrusion. A J Tool fits into the J Slot.\n\n*Most conventional downhole tools operate upward, downward or they rotate.\n\nBack to Top\n\nK\n\nBack to Top\n\nL\n\nLag Time\n\nThe time taken for cuttings to reach the surface. The term is also used in place of cycle time.\n\nLease\n\nA legal document conveying the right to drill for oil and gas i.e. begin exploration of production activity within a specified area.\n\nLiquefied natural gas (LNG)\n\nNaturally occurring gas (primarily methane and ethane), which is liquefied for transportation. Natural gas becomes a liquid at the very low temperature of minus 258 degrees ÂºF and may be stored and transported in the liquid state. This process is often required when a gas pipeline is not available to transport gas to the market place â such as remote jungle areas and offshore.\n\nLiquefied petroleum gas (LPG)\n\nGas mainly composed of propane and butane (light hydrocarbon material), which is gaseous at atmospheric temperature and pressure, held in the liquid state by pressure to facilitate storage, transport and handling. The gas is obtainable from refinery gases or after the cracking process of crude oil. Commercial liquefied gas consists essentially of either propane or butane, or mixtures thereof, and is also referred to as âbottled gasâ. The ease of conversion to a gaseous state means it can be used industrially or domestically.\n\nLiquid Desiccant\n\nA hygroscopic liquid used to remove water / water vapour from a gas stream. Some are glycols (diethylene, triethylene and tetraethylene), which are substances that can be regenerated i.e. the water\n\nabsorbed by these substances can also be separated from them. Some liquid desiccants however, such as methanol or ethylene, cannot be regenerated.\n\nLive Oil\n\nOil containing dissolved gas in solution (gas that is dissolved in a liquid, such as water or oil) that may be released from solution at surface conditions. Live oil must be handled and pumped under closely controlled conditions to avoid the risk of explosion or fire.\n\nBack to Top\n\nM\n\nMBBL\n\nA unit of measurement for âthousands of barrelsâ.\n\nMD\n\nA unit of measurement stands for âmeasured depthâ.\n\nMedium Crude Oil\n\nLiquid petroleum that has a density between light and heavy crude oil.\n\nMetric tonne\n\nA unit of measurement equivalent to 1000 kilos, 2204.61 lbs; 7.5 barrels.\n\nMethane\n\nThe main constituent of natural gas. Chemically, itâs classed as the simplest hydrocarbon molecule and is made up of on carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.\n\nMER\n\nAn acronym for âmaximising economic recoveryâ.

This unit of measurement is predominantly used in the United States.\n\nMud\n\nAlso known as âdrilling mudâ or âdrilling fluidâ, mud is a heavy fluid mixture made of base substance and additives that is used to lubricate and cool the drill bit.\n\nMidstream\n\nThe oil and gas industry is divided into three major components: upstream, midstream and downstream. Midstream is a term used to refer to activities, such as transportation, that fall between exploration and production (upstream) and refining and marketing (downstream).\n\nBack to Top\n\nN\n\nNatural Completion\n\nRefers to a completion system that utilizes the natural flow capability of a reservoir.\n\nNatural Gas\n\nGas that occurs naturally. It is often found with crude petroleum.\n\nNatural gas liquids ( or NGLs)\n\nThe portions of gas from a reservoir that are liquefied. This is usually observed in gas processing plants, at the surface in separators or field facilities. Sometimes NGL is also called liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).\n\nNeutralization\n\nA chemical reaction between a base and an acid which forms salt and water. This process is used in the manufacturing of mud products or the removal of acidic products/contaminants from muds. It is also used to test how alkaline a mud is.\n\nNeutron Log\n\nA radioactivity well log that determines how porous a formation is by blitzing the formation with neutrons. As the neutrons hit the hydrogen atoms in oil or water, gamma rays are released which are then used to identify the porosity.\n\nNight Toolpusher\n\nThe job role âAssistant Toolpusherâ who generally works during night-time hours.\n\nNipple\n\nA type of pipe fitting that is tubular in nature and threaded on both ends. It is used to connect pipe joints and other tools.\n\nNitro Shooting\n\nA formation-stimulation process where Nitroglycerine is placed in a well and exploded causing a fracture.\n\nNNS\n\nAcronym for Northern North Sea.\n\nNon-Associated Gas\n\nNatural gas from a reservoir that does not contain a significant amount of crude oil.\n\nNozzle\n\nThe passage through jet bits that cause drilling fluid to be ejected at a high velocity.\n\nNuclear tracer\n\nGas, liquid, or solid material that emits gamma rays.\n\nBack to Top\n\nO\n\nOil field\n\nAn accumulation, pool or group of subsurface oil pools. An oil field consists of a reservoir that traps hydrocarbons from being covered by impermeable or sealing rock. It may also contain associated gas.\n\nOil in place\n\nAn estimated measure of the total amount of oil contained in a reservoir, and, as such, a higher figure than the estimated recoverable reserves of oil.\n\nOperator\n\nThe company that has legal authority to drill wells and undertake production of hydrocarbons. The operator is often part of a consortium (an association of several companies) and acts on behalf of this consortium.\n\nOpex\n\nAn abbreviation for âoperating expenditureâ - an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.
