        "text": "Vår Energi is founded on more than 50 years of operations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), a robust and diversified asset portfolio with ongoing development projects centred around hubs, and a strong exploration track record.\n\nWith close to 1 400 employees and equity stakes in 47 producing fields, Vår Energi produced net 293 kboepd of oil and gas in the first half of 2024.\n\nWe are a leading independent upstream oil and gas company on the NCS:\n\nMaterial and diversified production base\n\nMaximising value creation with hub centered strategy\n\nWorld class capabilities, with tangible growth and track record\n\nTangible and concrete plan to reduce emissions from operations by more than 50% within 2030\n\nMaterial cash flow generation and Investment grade balance sheet supporting attractive and resilient distributions\n\nVår Energi has a strong heritage, having been created by combining four companies – Point Resources, the Norwegian businesses of Eni and ExxonMobil, and just recently Neptune Energy Norge. In the years since the company’s inception in 2018, we’ve established a strong track record of value creation and have become the 3rd largest operator on the NCS.\n\nWe’re achieving significant production and reserve growth, whilst at the same time delivering strong financials and returning over USD 2 billion to shareholders since the IPO in 2022.\n\nVår Energi is on track to nearly double production by 2025 from 2023 levels, and maintaining its significant gas share (37%). The growth catalysts are eight projects that will be in production before the end of 2025, primarily Balder X and Johan Castberg.\n\nVår Energi will be sustaining production and value creation beyond 2025 through\n\nOperational excellence, infill drilling and improved recovery in our core assets\n\nMaturing a high-value portfolio of early phase projects to move our significant discovered resource base into production\n\nDrilling on our exciting exploration portfolio\n\nValue-accretive M&A\n\nVår Energi is on track for near 100% production growth by end-2025, and have a tangible plan for high value creation beyond. The company create value from a large and diversified asset portfolio with a significant reserve base.\n\nOur strategy is centred around four hub areas, maximising utilisation of infrastructure and securing future growth. Together with our strong operational and exploration capabilities and safety culture, the hub areas form the basis for longterm profitable growth.\n\nOur recipe for moving from barrels to value:\n\nDelivering on the growth ambition – specifically the 10 projects in execution – securing around 400 kboepd by the end of 2025\n\nSustaining production by maturing a high value portfolio of new early-phase projects, more than 20 in total, ensuring that we sustain our production between 350-400 kboepd leading up to 2030.\n\nOpportunity to be countercyclical – benefitting on the market availability post-tax incentive wave\n\nAll projects are cost effective and low risk tie-backs to host installations – back-filling capacity\n\nShorter time-to-market, as project execution is standardised\n\nUnlocking future value – we’re accelerating our exploration efforts, targeting around 60 wells over the next 4 years – to unlock significant value across the entire NCS.\n\nVår Energi strives to be a partner of choice in all its activities. The company has a strong partnership with Equinor, the largest and one of the most experienced operators on the NCS, with Vår Energi being Equinor’s largest privately held partner on the NCS.\n\nThe company leverages its strong partnership with Equinor to seek cost and energy efficiencies, most recently by collaboration in the NCS Logistics Project (NLP), related to new solutions for logistics operations in the future. Other ongoing partnerships include the Hywind Tampen engagement, which started providing renewable energy to Snorre by use of floating wind, and a joint power from shore project for the Balder/Grane area.\n\nIn addition, Vår Energi is engaged in strong collaboration with Eni in order to leverage Eni’s capabilities in the areas of exploration, project development, asset operation and drilling expertise, to name a few. Vår Energi engages in commercial offtake agreements with Eni (through Eni Trade & Biofuels S.p.A) to provide offtake security and reduce the costs of hedging activity."
