        "text": "Choose Scotland for offshore wind energy solutions\n\nInnovation\n\nThereâs more offshore wind energy innovation underway in Scotland today than ever before.\n\nWith the UK Governmentâs Â£160 million commitment towards green energy research and development, Scotlandâs businesses remain at the cutting-edge of offshore wind energy innovation. They are developing next-generation floating wind turbines, designed using the most advanced mooring technology on the planet.\n\nExpertise\n\nAs the race toward renewables intensifies, customers are taking advantage of Scotlandâs well-established expertise in offshore energy projects.\n\nThere are also world firsts such as the Beatrice deepwater offshore wind demonstrator and Equinorâs Hywind Scotland floating offshore wind farm. As a result, businesses in Scotland offer products, services and manufacturing to customers worldwide, allowing them to increase their access to wind energy solutions.\n\nProject management\n\nScotland has nearly 20 years of experience in planning, developing and operating some of the worldâs biggest, deep water and most advanced floating offshore wind farms.\n\nOur subsea capabilities have benefited energy operations across the globe and with our northerly latitude, we are the windiest country in Europe. Few can demonstrate such an array of complementary conditions and business-ready infrastructure to advance the availability of offshore wind energy resources.\n\nValueÂ\n\nMany traditional energy companies are now beginning to look towards renewables.\n\nBecause of our offshore energy expertise, Scottish firms including tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers, are uniquely placed to help customers transform their core business models or pivot to new opportunities in a way that ensures the assetâs long term economic viability.\n\nAt the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm), ongoing research in the areas of blade testing, retrofitting techniques and maintenance regimes is ensuring our supply chain offers the most cost effective offshore wind solutions.\n\nSuccessful Scottish offshore wind energy companies\n\nGlobal Energy Group\n\nHeadquartered in Inverness and with facilities beside the Cromarty Firth, Global Energy Groupopens in a new window Â boasts an impressive track record of providing manufacture, assembly and factory acceptance testing services to the renewable energy sector.\n\nAs well as assembling turbines and manufacturing and assembling tidal turbine foundations, they supply an extensive range of offshore wind infrastructure products. In 2022, the company announced their intention to start offshore wind tower manufacturing.\n\nACT Blade\n\nTheÂ ACT Bladeopens in a new window Â is a light and controllable wind turbine blade. The innovative design allows for longer blades which increases energy production and reduces the cost of energy. ACT blade was founded in November 2015, following the completion of a feasibility study conducted in collaboration with DNV-GL and Offshore Renewable Catapult. Not only is it extremely effective, it has been designed to be partly recyclable and to use recycled material, reducing landfill waste.\n\nXodus Group\n\nXodus Groupopens in a new window Â is one of the worldâs leading offshore energy consultancies providing technical, environmental and engineering support to a wide range of clients within oil and gas and offshore wind and marine renewables (wave and tidal) industries.\n\nOur operations are managed by Scottish Enterprise.\n\nCookies help Scottish Enterprise (âSEâ, âusâ or âweâ) to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allow us to improve our website.
