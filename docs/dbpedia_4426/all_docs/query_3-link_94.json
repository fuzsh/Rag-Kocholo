        "text": "In this article, we will take a look at 10 of the biggest energy companies in the UK. If you want to see more of the biggest energy companies in the UK, go directly to 5 Biggest Energy Companies in the UK.\n\nThe United Kingdom or UK has one of the largest economies in the world with a 2021 GDP of $3.19 trillion. In the same year, only the United States, China, Japan, and Germany had higher nominal GDP. By GDP, PPP, the United Kingdom's economy also ranks #10 in the world.\n\nAs one of the biggest economies, the UK uses a lot of energy.\n\nWith a population of around 67.33 million, total energy consumption in the UK was 134 million tonnes of oil equivalent for 2021, up 4.6% from pandemic-affected 2020 according to the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy for the UK.\n\nIn terms of 2022, UK's total energy demand is likely around what it was in 2021 as total final energy consumption was only 0.2% lower in the second quarter of 2022 than what it was in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nWith more focus on building energy efficient homes, energy consumption might not rise very much for the near future.\n\nThe Energy Industry in the UK\n\nThe energy industry was bigger in the UK in the 1980's when oil and gas extraction was higher given North Sea production. In 1982, the energy industry accounted for as much as 10.4% of the total UK economy and the UK was a net exporter of oil at that time.\n\nNow, the UK is now a net importer of oil. According to the Office of National Statistics for the UK, \"The UK imported £30.0 billion of oil in 2021 (£17.6 billion crude oil, £12.4 billion refined oil), and exported £28.3 billion of oil (£17.9 billion crude oil, £10.4 billion refined oil).\"\n\nFor gas, the UK is less reliant on its internal production than oil. The Office of National Statistics for the UK writes, \"The UK imported £19.6 billion of gas in 2021; a notable increase of 312% from £4.8 billion in 2020. The UK exported £3.4 billion of gas in 2021, increasing by 167% from £1.3 billion in 2020.\"\n\nAs a result of less oil and gas production as well as the growth of the non-energy part of the UK economy, the energy sector accounted for 2.5% of the gross value added for the UK in 2021. The industry is still big, however, as it directly employed 175,000 people and more indirectly.\n\nAccording to the EIA, the United Kingdom was still the second largest producer of petroleum and other liquids and natural gas in OECD Europe in 2021, trailing only Norway. In 2021, the country produced 934,000 barrels per day in total liquid fuels and 1.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, with most of the production from offshore fields.\n\nIn terms of its electricity generation, the United Kingdom has made progress in terms of sustainability as 46% of the country's electricity generation came from renewables in 2020, versus 36% for natural gas, and 16% for nuclear.\n\nIn the future, it is likely that renewables will account for an even larger percentage of the UK's total electricity generation. Given the need for a more sustainable future, the UK has a goal to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Net zero according to the UK's Parliament is,\n\nAs a result, many of the leading UK energy companies have focused more on renewables in their portfolio in recent years and the companies are planning on investing billions in the future to help increase renewable energy generation.\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of 10 Biggest Energy Companies in the UK, we took the two largest oil and gas companies based in the UK, Royal Dutch Shell plc (NYSE:RDS) and BP plc (NYSE:BP) and added them to the big 5 energy companies in the UK, which includes Centrica given its subsidiary is British Gas, EDF given it owns EDF Energy, E.ON which owns E.ON Energy UK, and Iberdrola which owns Scottish Power. We also included FTSE 100 index utility component National Grid plc (NYSE:NGG), and FTSE 250 utility components such as ContourGlobal plc and Drax Group PLC.\n\nWe then ranked them based on 2021 revenues from macrotrends.net.\n\nGiven many of the 10 biggest energy companies in the UK are multinational corporations, their UK operations only account for a percentage of their total sales.\n\n10 Biggest Energy Companies in the UK\n\n10.
