        "text": "As a current medical student and member of the Jamaican diaspora, I am hugely concerned about the impact of the climate crisis both today and in the future. When visiting family in Jamaica I have seen first-hand the impacts of the climate crisis on it - as a low lying, previously colonised nation. So many other nations previously colonised by Britain, like Jamaica, are the ones experiencing the more severe impacts of the crisis today, despite having contributed so little to its causation.\n\nThe climate crisis is also the greatest global health threat the world faces. As someone who works for justice and for improving health and saving lives, it would be unacceptable to not address the greatest threat to life globally. It is imperative that the UK recognises its culpability in the creation of this crisis and takes every possible opportunity to act in accordance with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C target. These are just a few reasons why I dedicate so much of my time to environmental campaigning and why I’m taking the government to court to stop public money subsidising oil and gas extraction.\n\nI started working with Esso at Fawley Refinery in 1978, joining straight from university and staying there until 1986. The historical cover-up of the impacts of climate change by the oil and gas industry, including at the time that I was working for Esso, is inexcusable. The whole industry was all too aware of the damage that it was - and still is - causing. But it did whatever it could to keep that hidden, even from its own employees. I had a small part in this industry and want to help make things right.\n\nWhile at Esso I became more and more concerned about the environment and joined Greenpeace. I joined Extinction Rebellion in 2019, where I took part in a number of non-violent disruptive actions - some of these targeting the same fossil fuel industry I used to work for. I cannot stand by and let the Oil and Gas Authority and this government pursue a highly damaging strategy that I consider illegal and contrary to the government’s commitments to mitigate global heating. This Government's latest promise to stop funding fossil fuels overseas isn't enough - fighting the climate emergency starts at home.\n\nI grew up in Aberdeen, the centre of the oil and gas industry in Scotland. My father was a welder and fabricator who worked in Ravenscraig, the shipyards and the oil rigs. He was also a shop steward who was involved in the start-up of the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee (OILC). He was eventually 'Blacked' or blacklisted by the oil companies for his organising activities, along with around 700 others workers. My mother became the administrator for the OILC and she stayed there for 18 years, taking very little time off before she retired.\n\nFor me, this case is personal. It’s about honouring my family history and helping build the Scotland I want to see - one with lots of jobs in renewables and where public money goes towards the public good, not the wealthy polluters’ pockets. Public money is being spent supporting businesses that contribute to the crisis instead of solving it. We have to challenge this wrong-headed and deadly use of the public purse. That’s why I’m bringing the claim to the Oil and Gas Authority. If they don’t listen to common sense, maybe they’ll listen to the Courts."
