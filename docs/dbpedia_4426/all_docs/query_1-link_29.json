        "text": "Fuel poverty, grassroots climate groups and marine protection organisations are amongst 44 groups who have written to Scottish Government Ministers urging them to reject proposals for a new gas burning power station at Peterhead.\n\nThe letter signed by Oxfam Scotland, Fuel Poverty Action, Friends of the Earth Scotland and others highlights how new gas at Peterhead would maintain the current energy system which is “dominated by exploitative fossil fuel companies who are benefitting off ordinary people’s hardship.”\n\nThe Scottish Government is under huge pressure to increase climate action after announcing it would scrap its climate targets and this development would lock in higher fossil fuel emissions, from what is already Scotland’s biggest polluter, for decades to come.\n\nThe Scottish Government is considering an application from SSE and Equinor to build a new gas burning station with carbon capture in Aberdeenshire. The proposal would also lock Scottish households into paying energy prices which are set by international gas markets and are prone to external shocks such as the war in Ukraine. Climate campaigners have protested outside Equinor and SSE offices in recent weeks about the companies’ fossil fuel expansion plans.\n\nThe signatories also warn Ministers about reliance on carbon capture saying workers “should not be strung along with empty promises of jobs in fairytale carbon capture” and pointing out of the environmental and ethical risks of trying to store carbon under the North Sea in perpetuity.\n\nFriends of the Earth Scotland climate campaigner Alex Lee (they/them) commented,\n\n“Organisations from across Scottish society are calling on Ministers to reject this disastrous development which will only further enrich greedy energy companies at a huge cost to Scottish households and the climate. New fossil fuel burning will critically undermine the energy transition and make it even harder for the Scottish Government to meet its climate commitments.\n\n“Instead of building an energy system on the rotten foundations of carbon capture, we should be ploughing our time and resources into expanding a renewable energy system that is affordable, reliable and run in the public interest.”\n\nLucia Harrington, Organising Lead for Fuel Poverty Action commented,\n\n“Fuel Poverty Action opposes SSE and Equinor’s plans to build a new gas-burning power station in Peterhead. Expanding the fossil fuel industry will do nothing to help people with energy bills, but instead this new power station would lock households into relying on expensive gas for decades. Gas is currently priced five times higher than renewable energy and contributes to global warming, putting many lives at risk. But we know that companies like SSE do not care about people dying; whilst they made millions in profits, around 1000 people in Scotland alone died due to cold homes during the winter of 2022-2023.”\n\nCampaign Lead at Oceana Naomi Tilley said,\n\n“The planned development at Peterhead is an appallingly bad proposal from any angle, and the potential for severe damage to our ocean wildlife cannot be ignored. As well as marine heatwaves and ocean acidification driven by the climate crisis, fossil fuel developments and carbon capture projects degrade and destroy extraordinarily rare and diverse habitats – such as rich kelp forests and ancient corals – that are critical to the health of Scottish seas.”\n\n“It is also downright stupidity to prioritise untested and risky carbon-capture technology over protecting our ocean or slashing emissions. Thriving oceans can help stabilise our climate, give us food to eat, and support long-term livelihoods – safeguarding coastal communities. We don’t need more ocean-wrecking fossil fuel developments; we need a just transition to renewables that can provide low-cost energy and long-term jobs.”\n\nFrances Guy, Chief Executive, Scotland’s International Development Alliance,\n\n“Scotland’s industrial history means it has a responsibility to address its climate debt and to ensure current policy does no further harm. Global injustices will continue to grow until Scotland fundamentally reduces its carbon emissions. We urge the Scottish Government to consider the global impact of its domestic decision-making, particularly the new proposal at Peterhead. At a time when those with the biggest climate debt should be doing the most to reduce carbon emissions, a new gas burning power station will disastrously contribute to the impacts felt by climate-vulnerable countries around the world.”\n\nSam Bartlet, chair of Parents for Future Scotland said,\n\n“Building more fossil fuel power stations is like chucking petrol on a burning house. A just transition cannot be built on continued oil and gas use. Carbon capture and storage is a red herring, only designed to continue the profits of the oil and gas industry at the expense of a livable planet."
