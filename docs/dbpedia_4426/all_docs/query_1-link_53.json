        "text": "Scotland has high ambitions to develop an internationally significant hydrogen economy, as documented in the Scottish Hydrogen Action Planopens in a new window. A key part of that ambition is to develop 5GW of installed hydrogen production capacity by 2030, then 25GW by 2045.\n\nThe economic opportunities associated with hydrogen are not limited solely to its production. Other areas of opportunity include hydrogen use in:\n\nDistribution\n\nStorage\n\nIndustry\n\nTransport\n\nChemical feedstock\n\nExports to the rest of the UK and Europe\n\nThe global transition to hydrogen makes it a lucrative and innovative sector. Now we're showing Scottish companies how to be part of that change.\n\nWe're furthering our understanding of the wider hydrogen economyâs requirements and looking for existing capabilities in Scotland that could be useful to the sector.\n\nThe Assessment of Electrolysers report, commissioned by the Scottish Government, outlines the current state of electrolyser manufacturing globally. It details how to support the growing supply chain so that Scotland can reach its electrolyser deployment targets. We're working to make links between hydrogen project developers and Scottish companies that can offer relevant products and services.\n\nRead the Assessment of Electrolysers report opens in a new window\n\nHydrogen projects\n\nScotlandâs hydrogen project pipeline is growing, supported by existing energy generation and infrastructure assets.\n\nOur map of Scotland's hydrogen assets lets you see where hydrogen production, distribution and usage could take place.\n\nView our map of Scotland's hydrogen assetsopens in a new window\n\nWe are working to support developing projects and would encourage you to speak to us if you are a project developer and/or an inward investor.\n\nScotland's hydrogen innovation network (SHINe)\n\nScotland's hydrogen innovation ecosystem is growing at a fast pace. Scotland's hydrogen innovation network (SHINe) programme helps companies access the wide range of hydrogen innovation resources available.\n\nSHINe aims to speed up innovation in Scotland, strengthen hydrogen capabilities and help companies in the sector build lasting partnerships.\n\nLearn about hydrogen opportunities and news from SHINe\n\nSector and market opportunities\n\nThere are significant opportunities for companies that can contribute to making the large-scale production of green hydrogen more affordable.\n\nLearn about international hydrogen opportunitiesopens in a new window\n\nRecent reports\n\nThese reports cover hydrogen opportunities across different sectors in Scotland.\n\nIndustry hydrogen potential in Scotland\n\nDiscover how heavy industry could use hydrogen to decarbonise its energy-intensive processes and which sectors are best suited to take advantage of it. This study explains the most likely industrial offtakers, where offtakers are located and the level of demand.\n\nRead the report on industry hydrogen potentialopens in a new window\n\nHydrogen demand study â Scottish transport\n\nThe transport industry is one of the earliest adopters of hydrogen in Scotland â but how likely is each of its sectors to adopt hydrogen as a low carbon fuel? This report estimates and maps the potential demand for hydrogen in Scotland up until 2045.\n\nRead the report on hydrogen demand in Scotlandopens in a new window\n\nHydrogen for Scottish distilleries\n\nScotch whisky distilleries have ambitions to become more sustainable âand hydrogen is one of the ways that distilleries can do that. This study helps to simplify the type of hydrogen projects distilleries may consider, its requirements and costs.\n\nRead the report on hydrogen in Scottish distilleriesopens in a new window\n\nScottish hydrogen production â sites and opportunities\n\nThere's potential to produce green hydrogen all across Scotland. These studies highlight a range of sites where land, power and water requirements make the production of green hydrogen a possibility.\n\nRead our study on de-centralised green hydrogen production opens in a new window\n\nRead the report on Scottish hydrogen sites and requirementsopens in a new window\n\nRead our large-scale study on hydrogen production and export locationsopens in a new window\n\nSustainable aviation fuel mapping\n\nRead about Scotlandâs potential to support the use and development of synthetic/sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) â a solution that is widely regarded as the first step towards decarbonising aviation globally. This report defines the global and Scottish market opportunities for SAF and assesses the countryâs strengths and appetite to engage in zero-emission aviation. It also provides recommendations on how the Scottish and wider UK public sector can maximise the transition to net zero emissions aviation.\n\nRead the report on synthetic/sustainable aviation fuelopens in a new window\n\nCarbon capture, utilisation and storage\n\nScotland has a significant opportunity to deploy carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) due to its vast CO2 storage potential in the North Sea and the option to repurpose existing oil and gas infrastructure for CO2 transport and storage.\n\nScotland also has the skilled, experienced workforce and supply chain required to develop CCUS. This will help reduce carbon emissions across hard-to-abate industries, while also creating and sustaining jobs in Scotland.\n\nOf the four CCUS clusters in the UK, Scotland has one. These clusters will contribute towards the UK Governmentâs target to capture and store twenty to thirty megatonnes per annum (mtpa) of CO2 by 2030. CCUS in Scotland and across the UK will accelerate in the run up to 2030 to meet this target and will create new opportunities for the Scottish supply chain as a result.\n\nOffshore wind puts us in a strong position to be a world leader in green energy thanks toÂ Scotlandâs long-standing links to the oil and gas industry.Â\n\nExisting expertiseâ¯can be applied to offshore wind in fields such as surveying, installation, operations, maintenance, and health and safety.Â\n\nMarket opportunities in offshore wind\n\nOur market plans explain the background, scale and scope of the opportunity in offshore wind, the types of companies that are eligible, and â if you meet the criteria â what you need to do next.Â\n\nCheck out international opportunities in:\n\nChina\n\nJapan\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nPoland\n\nUSA\n\nFloating wind projects in Scotland\n\nScotland has two of the biggest floating wind farms in the world â Hywind Scotland and the Kincardine Offshore Wind Farm. There's a third in construction, the Pentland Offshore Wind Farm, which when completed, will overtake the others as the world's largest.Â\n\nThe opportunity for investment and growth in this sector is huge. In the UK alone, floating offshore wind is forecast to provide 17000 jobs and Â£33 billion GVA to the economy by 2050.\n\nRun by Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), Offshore Wind Scotland provides information on the sector. Discover developments and opportunities, instructions on how to become part of our Forth and Tay offshore supply chain clusters, and who to contact to find out more.\n\nRead more on offshorewindscotland.org opens in a new window Â\n\nGetting into clean heat offers big opportunities for your business, given Scotlandâs 2045 net zero targets,Â\n\nHeat accounts for 51% of Scotlandâs energy demand and, moving forward, all homes and buildings must have significantly reduced energy use with the majority using a zero-emissions heating system. This can provide the perfect opportunity for your company to grow through retraining your staff and redeveloping your services.\n\nFunding and grantsÂ\n\nGreen Heat Innovation Support Programme (GHISP)\n\nThe Â£17.6 million GHISP supports innovation and capital investment that will accelerate the roll out and adoption of clean heating solutions and associated products.\n\nLearn more about GHISPÂ Â\n\nHeatSource industry hub\n\nHeatSource is a collaborative knowledge hub funded by our organisation, HIE, and South of Scotland Enterprise (SOSE). It's aim is to explore opportunities in low carbon heat and bring together knowledge, partners and resources to help prepare the sector for net zero.\n\nAs well as providing industry updates, it allows you to register for events and list your business for free on the industry directory to help collaborators find you.\n\nFind out more on heatsource.org opens in a new window Â\n\nClean heat business guideÂ\n\nRead our report on Clean heat: low carbon heat opportunitiesÂ\n\nCase study\n\nLearn how Glasgow-based confectioner Aldomak is cutting energy costs.\n\nRead the full story on AldomakÂ"
