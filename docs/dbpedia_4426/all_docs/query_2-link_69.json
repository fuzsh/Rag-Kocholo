Some suppliers offer pre-registration, which helps to make sure you get any updates about them opening again. Others require you to apply for this discount and you can do this through your energy supplier directly.\n\nGreat British Insulation Scheme\n\nA new ECO fund for warm home improvements launched in April 2023. This will be available to households in Scotland and aims to offer various kinds of insulation to make homes more energy efficient and bring down people’s energy bills by helping them to keep their homes warm.\n\nThe Great British Insulation Scheme (ECO+) may help if you are struggling to pay your bills and will be open to lower income households, with a focus on homes which are not very energy efficient. You can contact your supplier or local council to find out if they are participating."
