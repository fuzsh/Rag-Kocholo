        "text": "Congratulations to our Commercial Manager, Daniel Cormack, who completed a charity swim across the Cromarty Firth on Sunday 11th August, along with his wife Rachael and Uncle Mark. Together they raised over £2,400 for the RNLI Invergordon Lifeboat Station, celebrating its 50th anniversary this year! The lifeboat station (RNLI 13-27), has been a cornerstone of the Invergordon community, providing invaluable services and ensuring safety in the Cromarty Firth and further at sea. In showing their appreciation for the vital services of the RNLI, the three braved the cool waters of the Firth, swimming from the Black Isle to the Lifeboat Station. #CharitySwim #InvergordonLifeboat #RNLI\n\nGlobal Energy Group is committed to supporting and developing the future workforce! Recently, we had the pleasure of hosting Adam Slotwinski from Dingwall Academy for a student work experience. Adam's enthusiasm for engineering was evident from the start, and it was fantastic to see his passion grow as he learned about our work across the energy industry. Adam shared: \"The experience at Global Energy Group was truly great and opened my eyes to what goes on in the field of engineering. I'm extremely lucky to have spent time here, and what I've seen and the conversations I've had will play a big part in planning my journey into the engineering world. Thank you and all the best for the future.\" We're thrilled to have been part of Adam's journey and wish him all the best for the future! #WorkExperience #FutureEngineer\n\nCongratulations to Daniel Nicholson, Welding Engineer at Global Energy Group Fabrication, who has completed his International / European Welding Engineer (IWE / EWE) qualification.
