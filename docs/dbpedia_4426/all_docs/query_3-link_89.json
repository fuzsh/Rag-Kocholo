It has been a refreshing change dealing with John McCabe at UK Marketing Management Ltd. When given a brief from me he squirrels away and comes back with in depth information that will help me make the right decisions. We need a few more John McCabe’s in the World!\n\n 5/5\n\nI have worked with UK Marketing Management for more than 10 years, taking their expertise and professionalism with me whenever I’ve moved to new digital marketing positions. They offer the advice, quality and technical ability of a large company, but the flexibility and reaction times of a start up.\n\n 5/5\n\nWe have been working with John and his team since the beginning of lockdown and where all other data suppliers have failed John has succeeded. I would fully recommend UK Marketing Management as they seem to get the job done and goes out of his way to deal with our requirements."
