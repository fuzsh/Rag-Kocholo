        "text": "Guiding principles\n\nThree guiding principles underpin Scotlandâs decommissioning sector:\n\nA steadfast commitment to operational excellence\n\nCost efficiency\n\nHuman and environmental safety\n\nThroughout Scotland, specialist businesses like CessCon Decom are embracing these principles to address the most critical decommissioning challenges facing traditional energy customers. Having won a contract to decommission 23,000 tonnes of offshore and onshore facilities material and equipment, CessCon Decom are an example of the capabilities, knowledge and skills on offer in Scotland.\n\nWhile oil and gas operations will continue to play a major role in the production of energy for the foreseeable future, many platforms have reached the end of their design life and need to be dismantled. This means the safe and responsible removal of pipelines, platforms, artificial islands and the safe sealing of wellheads. These highly-specialist services can be found in Scotland.\n\nBenefits of Scotlandâs decommissioning expertise\n\nWorld-leading innovation\n\nScotland can offer global customers the very best in technological innovation, world-class engineering teams and exceptional problem-solving expertise throughout the decommissioning lifecycle.

They provide advanced marine engineering capabilities and continuously develop and enhance current deepwater technologies. Sentinel Subseaâs game-changing well integrity monitoring system is just one example of the transformative technological solutions available in Scotland, to help global customers de-risk the abandonment process.\n\nReducing carbon safely\n\nToday, hundreds of the largest oil and gas operations are partnering with the specialist companies found in Scotland to roll out their decommissioning projects. Confidence in Scotlandâs project efficiency, strong execution record, safety and competitive pricing, makes Scotland a preferred-vendor for global customers.\n\nSuccessful oil and gas decommissioning exporters from Scotland\n\nCessCon Decom\n\nA leading decommissioning company in Europe,Â CessCon Decomopens in a new window Â provide expertise in onshore and offshore decommissioning, focused on environmentally friendly and safe solutions for clients.\n\nFairfield Decom\n\nAt the forefront of a new era in the oil and gas industry,Â Fairfield Decomopens in a new window Â heralds a new kind of decommissioning delivery business model.
