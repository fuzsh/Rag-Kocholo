The main supporter of the proposed Association is Councillor Maria Augimeri.

About Maria Augimeri: (Details are also available in brochures).

Maria Augimeri is the City of Toronto Councillor for Ward 9-York Centre, serving the Downsview community with passion and commitment since her first election as School Trustee in 1982. She was elected to North York City Council in 1985; Metro Council in 1998, 1991 and 1994 and Toronto Council in 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2010.

Councillor Augimeri is Chair of the North York Community Council and the Aerospace Action Partnership. She is the Vice-Chair of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. The Councillor is a member of the Toronto Transit Commission and was the Chair of the the York University, City of Toronto Track and Field Centre Committee.

As a published author, Councillor Augimeri’s passion for the written word was evident in her position as the first Chair of the City’s Language Equity and Literacy Working Group where she presided over the City’s historic Literacy Hearings. The Councillor was successful in building a new public library replete with computer lab to the Jane and Sheppard area.

Maria Augimeri is an Honours Graduate of English and Anthropology and a former instructor of Social Anthropology at York University. She is the author of three published works on the Italian-Canadian community. Ms. Augimeri’s poetry has also been published in Canada. Some of her books may be found in Toronto public libraries and the libraries of York University.

The Councillor’s commitment to local revitalization measures is evidenced through the many projects flourishing in the Downsview area. Wilson Avenue, in fact, was granted special redevelopment measures and beautification plans. Community partnerships have resulted in impressive murals in the Northwood Community Centre and along Wilson Avenue. The planting of trees along Keele St., Jane St., Wilson Ave. and Sheppard Ave. W.; the substantial beautification of City boulevards along these major thoroughfares; the enhancement of local parks and parkettes– these strategies all come together to make Downsview an attractive and appealing place to live.

Councillor Augimeri operates a Community Service Office where she meets with constituents on a weekly basis. She has held Property Tax Assessment Clinics for local residents and has handled thousands of property tax appeals throughout her 28 years in public office. Fairness and equity of property assessment has long been of primary interest to the Councillor, who has served as Vice-Chair of the City’s Assessment and Property Tax Task Force.

Ms. Augimeri was born in Italy and immigrated to Toronto at the age of 2. She is married to former Downsview MPP Odoardo Di Santo. They have two children — Vittoria and William.
