Previous plans called for all stations to be retrofitted by 2020, while the current plan defers this completion date to 2024;\n\nProvincial regulations under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities, 2005 (AODA) are being enacted, and these will apply to all public sector agencies, including the TTC. The TTC is in compliance with the regulations for customer service that came into effect January 2010. A consolidated regulation for standards for accessible transportation, employment, and communications is expected to be posted for public review early in 2011. The regulation for standards for the built environment will follow at a later date. The Commission has made the Province aware of concerns with the proposed standards, in particular requesting that the Province take the lead on implementation of elements of the standards rather than down-loading the responsibility and costs onto service providers;\n\nThe Province has not made a commitment to fund the costs of complying with the AODA regulations. Additional, unfunded costs resulting from the Provincial requirements may result in increased TTC subsidy requirements from the City, service reductions, and/or fare increases.\n\nApproved\n\n2011 Operating Budget: Service Re-allocations – Follow-up\n\nM.

That service re-allocations, including minor reductions and improvements, be reported to the commission on a quarterly, or semi-annual basis, based on the service thresholds established by the Commission.\n\n2. That TTC Management staff be requested to report back to the Commission on the accuracy of ridership on transit routes that are affected and may qualify to have the service reinstated where the ridership trend may be justified.\n\nThe motions by Commissioner Palacio carried.\n\nChair Stintz moved approval of the recommendations in the staff report.\n\nThe motion by Chair Stintz carried.\n\nThe meeting recessed at 11:01 a.m. and reconvened at 1:00 p.m.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 10:05 p.m."
