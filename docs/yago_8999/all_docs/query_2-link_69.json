Nadezhda exemplifies the spirit of the Cemetery, the Abolition of Slavery, the ending of young children's employment in mines and factories, the freeing of women, the freeing of nations.

On board were Frances Trollope, 40, Cecilia Trollope, 12, Emily Trollope, 10, Henry Trollope, 14, all English, Frances Wright, 28, American, and August Hervieu, 23, French. Frances Wright, associated with Lafayette, had invited the Trollopes to Nashoba where she had a settlement for the education of Negro slaves. Auguste Hervieu, a brilliant young artist, was the children's tutor and companion. With them also were Hester Rust and William Abbott, their servants. Often Hervieu had to sell his art to feed and house them all'. In Cincinatti she had engaged the young B32/ HIRAM POWERS to do Dante's Commedia in wax, starting his career as a sculptor. Pastore Luigi Santini wrote of her presence in Florence: 'She was the matriarch of a clan of writers; herself, two sons and two daughters-in-law. She arrived in Florence with her son Thomas Adolphus in 1843 and took up residence in Piazza Santa Croce, immediately entering into friendly relations with notables of the Court and the British community. In 1849 she moved with her son and daughter-in-law Theodosia Garrow to a little house, Villino Trollope, in Piazza Barbano (now Indipendenza). She dedicated herself to the theatre, organized Anglo-Florentine social life, and wrote prolifically, and her house became a meeting place and obligatory reference point even for such writers as Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy and Thackeray. Her son's autobiography, What I Remember (London, 1887), is a splendid window on cosmopolitan and cultivated Florence'. L.S.

Pierce to the centre,\n\nArts fiery finger! - and break up erelong\n\nThe serfdom of this world! Appeal, fair stone,\n\nFrom Gods pure heights of beauty, against mans wrong!\n\nCatch up in thy divine face, not alone\n\nEast griefs but west, - and strike and shame the strong,\n\nBy thunders of white silence, overthrown!\n\nSi dice che la Bellezza Ideale non possa entrare nella\n\ncasa d'angoscia. Una figura straniera sta sulla soglia,\n\ncon le mani incatenate, la Schiava greca:\n\ncome se lo scultore eleggesse lei,\n\n(quella perfezione impassibile che egli le diede,\n\nombreggiata, non oscurata, là dove la soglia si apre)\n\nper misurare i crimini degli uomini in diversi lidi,\n\ncon ogni ideale dell'uomo. Penetra nell'intimo,\n\ninfuocato dito dell'arte! - e spezza presto\n\nla schiavitù di questo mondo!

Theodore Parker's burial in the 'English' Cemetery.\n\nD21Q/ D108/ 698/ THEODORE PARKER/ AMERICA/ THEODORE PARKER/ THE GREAT AMERICAN PREACHER/ BORN AT LEXINGTON MASSACHUSETTS/ UNITED STATES OF AMERICA/ AUGUST 24TH 1810/ DIED AT FLORENCE ITALY/ MAY 10 1860/ HIS NAME IS ENGRAVED IN MARBLE/ HIS VIRTUES IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE HE/ HELPED TO FREE FROM SLAVERY/ AND SUPERSTITION\n\nPastore Luigi Santini: 'Born of a modest family in Lexington, Massachusetts, he studied at Harvard Divinity School, specializing in a study of German theology. He was drawn to the ideas of Coleridge, Carlyle and Emerson. In 1842 his doubts led him to an open break with orthodox theology: he stressed the immediacy of God and saw the Church as a communion looking upon Christ as the supreme expression of God. He organized the first congregations, called Unitarian, in Boston, and participated in the fight for the abolition of slavery. Seriously ill, he sought refuge in Florence because of his friendship with the Brownings, Isa Blagden and F.P. Cobbe, but died scarcely a month following his arrival. Frances P. Cobbe collected and published his writings in 14 volumes; his compatriot John Hart made the original simple tombstone'. This is what Frederick Douglass published on him:\n\nNext to Rome, in point of interest to me, is the classic city of Florence, and thither we went from the Eternal City. One might never tire of what is here to be seen. The first thing Mrs. Douglass and I did, on our arrival in Florence, was to visit the grave of Theodore Parker and at the same time that of Elizabeth Barrett Browning (B8). The preacher and the poet lie near each other. The soul of each was devoted to liberty. The brave stand taken by Theodore Parker during the antislavery conflict endeared him to my heart, and naturally enough the spot made sacred by his ashes was the first to draw me to its side. He had a voice for the slave when nearly all the pulpits of the land were dumb. Looking upon the little mound of earth that covered his dust, I felt the pathos of his simple grave. It did not seem well that the remains of the great American preacher should rest thus in a foreign soil, far away from the hearts and hands which would gladly linger about it and keep it well adorned with flowers. Than Theodore Parker no man was more intensely American. Broad as the land in his sympathy with mankind, he was yet a loving son of New England and thoroughly Bostonian in his thoughts, feelings, and activities. The liberal thought which he taught had in his native land its natural home and largest welcome, and I therefore felt that his dust should have been brought here. It was in his pulpit that I made my first antislavery speech in Roxbury. That its doors opened to me in that dark period was due to him. I remember, too, his lovingkindness when I was persecuted for my change of opinion as to political action. Theodore Parker never joined that warfare upon me. He loved Mr. Garrison, but was not a Garrisonian. He worked with the sects, but was not a sectarian. His character was cast in a mold too large to be pressed into a form or reform less broad than humanity. He would shed his blood as quickly for a black fugitive slave pursued by human hounds as for a white President of the United States. He was the friend of the non-voting and non-resistant class of abolitionists, but not less the friend of Henry Wilson, Charles Sumner, Gerrit Smith, and John Brown. He was the large and generous brother of all men, honestly endeavoring to bring about the abolition of Negro slavery. It has lately been attempted to class him with the contemners of the Negro. Could that be established, it would convict him of duplicity and hypocrisy of the most revolting kind. But his whole life and character are in direct contradiction to that assumption.\n\nWhile he had written the following in his diary:\n\nFollowing this visit to see Theodore Parker's tomb, Douglass agitated for a better monument to honour him, William Wetmore Story being commissioned to carry out the present one. Story had already created a bust of Parker from life in Rome, and now portrayed him in bas-relief. This is one among several tombs with a portrait medallion: A64/ GEORGE AUGUSTUS WALLIS by Aristodemos Costoli; A15/ ANNE SUSANNA (LLOYD) HORNER by Francesco Jerace; AB7/ INA BOSS SAULTER, by Ettore Ximenes;B4/ ELENA NIKITICNA DIK, NATA AKZYNOVA by Fyodor Fyodorovitsch Kamensky; C3/ THOMAS SOUTHWOOD SMITH by Joel T.

When President Obama ordered the carpet for the Oval Office he included words he thought originated with Martin Luther King, Jr., but which are actually Parker's words abbreviated by King from a sermon Parker preached against slavery in 1853: 'How long? Not long because the arc of the moral compass is long, but it bends towards justice'. He quoted them again at Nelson Mandela's funeral.\n\nTheodore Parker's desk with statues Frederick Douglass at Lloyd Garrison's tomb\n\nof Jesus and Spartacus Joel Hart(F28)'s tomb for Theodore Parker William Wetmore Story's tomb for Theodore Parker\n\nCippo.

Jeffrey Begeal notes Richard Hildreth was American Consul in Trieste. William Lyons Phelps notes that he wrote an inspiring History of the United States in six volumes, stating in its Preface: 'Of centennial sermons and Fourth of July orations, whether professedly such or in the guise of history, there are more than enough. It is due to our fathers and ourselves, it is due to truth and philosophy, to present for once, on the historic stage, the founders of our American nationa unbedaubed with patriotic rouge, wrapped up in no fine-spun cloaks of excuses and apology, without stilts, buskins, tinsel, or edizenment, in their own proper persons.' The Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography notes that he wrote the first anti-slavery novel, The Slave, from witnessing slavery in Florida where he had gone because of his tuberculosis. This novel may be read on the Web at http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/hildreth/hildreth.html. TAU has a copy of its Italian translation. Harriet Beecher Stowe, in Uncle Tom's Cabin, copies this novel and that of Frances Trollope (Sector B, B80), Jonathan Jefferson Whitlaw. Buried near Theodore Parker (D108), he also is Unitarian. Frederick Douglass visited both their graves and in his handwritten diary, above, commented admiringly on Hildreth. Hildreth's wife, Caroline Negus, the portraitist who supported her husband's writing career, died of cholera in Naples in 1867.\n\nCippo. Marmista ignoto. Sec. XIX, post 7/1865. Ambito toscano.

Another slave story in the 'English' Cemetery:\n\nF5O/ F53/ 1300/ HENRIETTA MARIA HAY/ SCOTLAND/ TO THE MEMORY OF/ HENRIETTA MARIA HAY/ DAUGHTER OF ROBERT HAY ESQ/ OF LINPLEM EAST LOTHIAN/ SCOTLAND/ BORN 8 DEC/ 1842 DIED 9 FEB 1875\n\nHer father, Robert Hay, of Linplem, was an Egyptologist. He purchased the former convent of Nunraw, but was ill-fitted for farming after his years (1826-38) as a leader in an archaelogical expedition to Egypt which yielded fruitful results for the British Museum. He published (1840) a folio work entitled 'Illustrations of Cairo' and had brought home to Scotland the slave captured by Ottoman Turks he ransomed in Alexandria, Kalitza Psaraki, daughter of the chief magistrate in Crete, as his wife. See http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200302/the.lost.portfolios.of.robert.hay.htm in which we realize we have a companion tale to Champollion and Rosellini's epedition to Egypt and Nubia, a companion tale even to NADEZHDA DE SANTIS (B58), echoed in HIRAM POWERS(B32) ' 'Greek Slave' and in ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING(B8)'s impassioned sonnet to that sculpture.. When the purchase of Nunraw was finally completed in 1860, Robert commenced extensive restoration work on the house but he died in 1863 before completing it. His son, Robert James Alexander Hay, then 23 - was at Cambridge - where he took an M.A. The young Laird continued the work of restoring the \"castle\", and thus in 1864 discovered the painted ceiling, dating back to 1610. Like his father, R. J. A. Hay was fond of travel and in 1875 brought home as his bride from Florence Caterina Maria Teresia, third daughter of Marchese di Monte Castello of Tuscany. When he inherited Nunraw, the property was already burdened with large debts and these soon increased. Eventually, in 1880, Mr. Hay decided to break the entail and he was living in Florence with his wife and children when the sale to Walter Wingate Gray, Esq., was finally completed, while his sister lived at B8/ ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING and Robert Browning's Casa Guidi. (It was republican Elizabeth Barrett Browning who changed its name from Palazzo Guidi, opposite the Palazzo Pitti, to 'Casa Guidi'. During these years the family of ANNA BROWN (E24), and that of CHAPMAN STANSFIELD MARSHALL (E148) also had that address. One can only assume these families had different apartments within the palace, while using her naming for its cachet.) Miss Hay dies a spinster, but with her married brother, his Italian wife, and two nephews living nearby. Thus we see a Tuscan connection with this Scottish family and we realize that Henrietta Maria Hay herself, from her mother, is half-Cretan, part Greek. The widow of William Hay, of the same Clan Hay, FRANCES ANNE (OGLE) HAY (F56), lived at Lungarno 30.\n\nRobert Hay, Egyptologist\n\nCroce. Marmista ignoto. Sec. XIX, post 2/1875. Ambito toscano.
