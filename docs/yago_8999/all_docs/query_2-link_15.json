        "text": "October 16, 1591—October 29, 1591\n\nDecember 30, 1591—January 30, 1592\n\nBackground\n\nGregory XIV was crowned on December 8, 1590. During his brief reign of ten months, he took the trouble to declare his support for the League in France, against Henri IV, promising both money and troops for their cause. He especially praised the Parisians for their stout defense of the Faith. This news was published in France by the Bishop of Piacenza Filippo Sega, on February 21, 1591. To make his support more concrete, Gregory XIV married his nephew Ercole to the daughter of the Duke of Massa, and in March appointed the Duke to lead his army against the heretic French. The League sent an ambassador to the Papal Court Charles de Lorraine-Vaudemont, the Cardinal of Lorraine. The younger Cardinal Charles de Bourbon-Vendôme (1583-1594) [Ciaconius-Olduin IV, 75; Gallia christiana XI, 101], also approached the Pope, through Scipio Balbani of Lucca, with a report that Henri IV was persisting in his heresy, and that, with the permission of the Pope, the French Crown ought to be transferred to its rightful owner by right of descent, the Cardinal himself. Pope Gregory was vague in responding to Charles de Bourbon's ideas. In addition, Bourbon's letter was intercepted and put into the hands of King Henri IV [Fleury, Histoire Ecclesiastique 36 (1738), 350-355].\n\nMeanwhile, Henri IV was attempting to reach an accommodation with his Protestant, moderate Catholic, and zealot Catholic subjects, while pursuing the war against the League. In 1591, however, Gregory had sent a new Legate to France, Cardinal Enrico Caetani, and had provided him with bulls declaring all of the King's followers heretic and excommunicate. The bulls were read in S. Denis on June 3 [Fleury, Histoire Ecclesiastique 36 (1738), 359-362]. King Henri responded promptly. A meeting was held at Mantes on July 4, 1591 [Fleury, Histoire Ecclesiastique 36 (1738), 362-366], with the Princes, Bishops and nobles of his party. An edict was published, restoring the edicts of pacification which had originally been issued by Henri III, but which had been limited by concessions made to the League in 1585 and 1588. The Cardinal de Bourbon made an attempt to leave the session, but was ordered by the King to seat himself again. The incident increased the suspicion of the King towards the Cardinal. King Henri also published an edict stating his intention to maintain the Catholic Church in France. On September 25, 1591, the prelates met again at Chartres, and declared the actions of Gregory XIV, which had been obtained by the influence of King Henri's political enemies (Count-duke of Olivares and the Duke of Sessa), to be null and void both in form and in matter. Two cardinals (Bourbon and Lenoncourt) and seven bishops signed the documents; the future Cardinal du Perron, Bishop-Elect of Evreux, also signed along with other notables [Spondanus, Continuatio Caes. Baronii Annalium III (Paris 1641), 732; Barigny, Vie du Cardinal du Perron, 69-75; Fleury, p. 366].\n\nThe October Conclave\n\nPope Gregory XIV (Sfondrati) died in the night between October 15 and 16, 1591. His life had been despaired of three times before (and he had received Extreme Unction four times). He suffered from kidney stones; a large one was found in his urinary track during the opening of the body for enbalming [Spondanus, Continuatio Caes. Baronii Annalium III (Paris 1641), 733]. Some cardinals were already on their way to Rome at the time of his death, believing that one of his crises had already been fatal. The Cardinals who were already in Rome had already begun their intrigues, even though the Pope was still alive (Conclavi, 516). Messengers were sent out to various cardinals, informing them that there would soon be a Conclave. Cardinal Francesco Sforza (Papal Governor of the Romagna) and Cardinal Monte (Papal Legate in Florence) arrived in Rome even before the Pope had died.\n\nA di 15 d' ottobre 1591 Martedi, circa dodici ore sino all' hore ventidue, il Papa cominciò a peggiorare in modo, che bisognò raccomandar l' anima. La domenica antecedente parimente gli fu raccomandata l' anima, e la notte seguente. Il Mercordi veniente cioò ad hore sette della notte seguente a detto giorno passò da questa a miglior vita il nostro Santissimo Padre Gregorio XIV.. Gia in questa lunga sua infermità S. Santità nello spazio di 23 giorni, che stette ammalato, più volte si era communicate ed ultimamente alli cinque del predetto mese d' Ottobre ebbe l' oglio santo, ed è morto santamente, sicche piamente si puole credere, che sia andato dritto dritto in Paradiso, e cosi sia. (Laemmer, Meletemetum, 234-235).\n\nGregory was buried in the Vatican Basilica in the Capella Gregoriana. The funeral oration was pronounced by Vincenzo Blas Garsias, of Valencia in Spain, on December 18, 1591 [Novaes, Introduzione, p. 263]. Agostino Valier, the Cardinal of Verona, wrote a small commentary on his life. On Friday, October 25, the ninth and last of the novendiales Masses was celebrated by the Cardinal of Ascoli, Girolamo Bernerio, OP. Fifty-six cardinals attended the Mass (Laemmer, Meletematum, 235).\n\nFactions\n\nThe principal factions were the Spanish interest and an opposition group led by Cardinals Montalto (Alessandro Peretti, nephew of Pope Sixtus V) and Francesco Sforza. There was also a small number of cardinals led by the nephew of the late Pope, Cardinal Paolo Aemilio Sfondrati. The Spanish faction, which had lost in the Conclave of 1590, was eager to recover their reputation and to demonstrate their worth to the King of Spain, Philip II, who had recently suffered such a dramatic defeat at the hands of the English heretics (the Spanish Armada of 1588). In France, another heretic, Henri IV, was poised to become master of the country, a prospect which drove King Philip to distraction. Popes had cooperated with Spanish policy in the past, and a cooperative pope was needed again. But Philip's choices had gradually been limited, until he was left essentially with one candidate whom he could count on to do his bidding, Cardinal Luigi Madruzzi, the bishop of Trent, who was unacceptable to many simply because he was so acceptable to King Philip. The Spanish faction, therefore, turned in the direction of Cardinals Girolamo Simoncelli and Giovanni Facchinetti, but with the understanding that if Cardinal Ascanio Colonna or Cardinal Tolomeo Galli, Suburbicarian Bishop of Frascati [portrait at left], should begin to show well in the voting, they would support them by preference.\n\nThe Mass of the Holy Spirit was sung in the Vatican Basilica on Sunday, October 27, and afterwards the cardinals proceeded to the area of the Conclave, and swore the customary oaths; at the fourth hour of the night, the Conclave was enclosed. Fifty-six or fifty-seven cardinals entered conclave on October 27 (Novaes, 248). Paolo Alaleone, the Master of Ceremonies, counted 54 [according to Gattico I, 342]. Thirty-eight votes were needed to elect.\n\nOn Monday, October 28 the Cardinal Dean, Alfonso Gesualdo, said the Mass of the Holy Spirit in the Capella Paolina, and distributed communion to all the Cardinals. After the Mass, the Cardinals proceeded to the first scrutiny, in which the Cardinal of Santi Quattro, Giovanni Facchinetti, received the most votes, twenty-four, but there was no successful election. After lunch, there was a vetting of the Conclavists.\n\nOn the second day of voting, Tuesday, October 29, in the morning scrutiny, Cardinal Facchinetti received twenty-eight votes, four more than on the previous ballot. The rest of the day was spent in discussion until late afternoon (l' ore ventitre'), when the Cardinals escorted Cardinal Facchinetti to the Capella Paolina. The Cardinal Dean began to speak, \"Ego Card. Gesualdus Episcopus Hostiensis eligo in Summum Pontificem Reverendissimum Dominum meum Joannem Antonium Facchinettum Tituli Sanctorum Quattuor Coronatorum Sanctae Ecclesiae Romanae Presbyterum Cardinalem. Following him, each of the other cardinals, in order, did the same (Laemmer, Meletmetum 236 ). The newly elected pope was led behind the altar where he changed from his cardinalatial costume into that of the pope, assisted by two Cardinal Deacons. When he returned to the Chapel he was seated on the papal throne and announced that he would be called Innocent IX. The Cardinal Protodeacon, Andreas of Austria, went to the traditional window and, displaying the processional cross, made the announcement of the election of Cardinal Facchinetti. While this was taking place, the new pope signed the usual bulls which committed him not to alienate Church property. The Cardinal Camerlengo, Enrico Caetani, placed the Fisherman's ring on the Pope's finger, and the Pope received the hommage of all the Cardinals. He was then carried to St. Peter's Basilica, where the ceremony was repeated in public.\n\nCardinal Giovanni Antonio Facchinetti, Cardinal Priest of SS. Quattro Coronati, though seventy-two years of age and in chronic ill health, was elected as Innocent IX. He was crowned in public on November 3, in the customary place at the top of the steps of the portico of St. Peter's. Cardinal Farnese was allowed to take part, even though he had not yet received the red hat. A fairly good list of the cardinals who participated is given in the Bull Quae ab hac of November 4, 1591 [Bullarium Romanum IX (Augustae Taurinorum 1865), p. 507], containing fifty-one names. On the 8th of November Innocent took solemn possession of the Lateran Basilica. Thirteen cardinals rode in the procession. Fifty were present at the ceremonies in S. Giovanni Laterano [Cancellieri, pp. 149-153, based on the diaries of Giovanni Paolo Mucanzio and Paolo Alaleone; Alaeone and Francesco Mucanzio took part as Maestri di Caeremonie]. Cardinal Ascanio Colonna, the Archpriest of the Lateran Basilica, presided at the installation [Cancellieri, p. 151]. The customary distribution of medals to Cardinals and other prelates did not take place, since the Treasurer, Bartolomeo Cesi, explained that there had not been time to strike them. During his return procession to the Vatican, the Pope stopped at his old titular church, SS. Quatuor Coronati, which was celebrating the parish feast day on that day. The monks were permitted to greet the pope and kiss his foot. The entire outing took some five hours.\n\nAlready on December 13, however, it was clear that Pope Innocent would not last long. Cardinal Monte wrote to the Grand Duke Ferdinand [Petruccelli II, 366, translated by Petruccelli]:\n\nLe pape ne vivra pas. Les Espagnols persistent dans leurs candidats, ou ils ne s’expliqueront qu’au moment voulu. Il faut donc prévoir. Cinq choses rendent Santa Severina difficile : son caractère, qui ne peut pas transiger avec la nécessité; ses ennemis nombreux, puissants, enragés et toujours plus implacables; la faiblesse de Montalto qui est le fondement de tout; la moquerie dont le berna Mendozza (et je ne sais ce que celui—ci fera plus tard); enfin ce qui me déplait le plus, la haine du pape, lequel compte beaucoup sur Sfondrato. Santa Severina baisse donc. On travaille sans cesse contre lui. D`autre part, si le roi le veut, tout plie sous sa volonté, même Mendozza et ses cardinaux. Tout est en cela. Paleotto frise l’impossible; Montalto et les Espagnols le pulvérisent. Beaucoup de monde s'est déclaré contre Colonna; personne n’agit sincèrement envers lui. Madruzzo n'éblouit personne: mais les faveurs dont dispose son roi sont immenses, et Montalto est jeune. Je me suis ri de Como jusqu’ici; mais maintenant, comme il faut, après tout, enfanter un pape quelconque, la peur de Santa Severina le pousse en avant, et Montalto le préférera toujours à Paleotto et à Madruzzo.\n\nOn the 18th of December, though ill, Pope Innocent made a pilgrimage of Rome's seven pilgrimage churches and caught a chill. He developed a heavy cough and fever, and died in the Apostolic Palace on Monday, December 30, 1591, between the eleventh and twelfth hours, at the age of 73 [Petramellari, p. 372], or two hours before sunrise [Ciaconius-Olduin IV, 238]. There was no Papal Master of Ceremonies present, but it was reported that he received Holy Communion and Extreme Unction. On the same day his body was transferred to St. Peter's Basilica, and laid out for public viewing for three days. He was buried in the Vatican Basilica next to Urban VII (Laemmer, Meletmetum, 236; Petramellari, 372). The Sede Vacante following his death lasted for thirty-one days. The Novendiales began on Tuesday, December 31, and concluded on January 8, 1592. The Funeral Oration was pronounced by Father Benedetto Giustiniani, SJ. on January 8, 1592 [text in Ciaconius-Olduin IV, 240-245; date given by Victorelli in col. 239].\n\nThe College of Cardinals, 1591\n\nThe second Interregnum lasted from December 30, 1591 to January 30, 1592. There were sixty-four cardinals, Giovanni Vincenzo Gonzaga (aged 49), Cardinal Priest of S. Alessio having died December 23, 1591 [Petramellari, pp. 371-372], Ippolito de Rossi, Cardinal Priest of S. Biagio (died April 28, 1591), and Cardinal Juan Hurtado de Mendoza (aged 43), Cardinal Priest of S. Maria in Trastevere on January 6, 1592 [Petramellari, pp. 373-374]. Ciaconius-Olduin [IV, 236-238] also provide a list of fifty-six cardinals who attended the Conclave, and nine who were absent—a total of sixty-five. Fifty-two cardinals entered conclave on January 10, 1592, according to a list provided by Giovanni Stringa, \"Vita di Clemente VIII\" , p. 241-242. The Cardinal de Joyeuse arrived on January 12, making fifty-four electors.

Nuncio in France; he had been left behind as Nuncio by Cardinal Caetani when he fled Paris in September, 1590. Innocent IX made him a cardinal on December 18, 1591.\n\nThe Conclave of January, 1592\n\nThe Conclave opened on Friday, January 10, 1592, with the celebration of the Mass of the Holy Spirit by Cardinal Gesualdo, the Bishop of Ostia. There were fifty-two cardinals in attendance [Histoire des conclaves 3rd edition, I, p. 259]. After the enclosing had taken place, it was discovered that the Spanish Ambassador the Duke of Sessa, and Cavaliere Vinta (the Ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany) were still inside, campaigning fo their favorite candidates; the gates had to be reopened so that they could make their exits. The Spanish Ambassador, who was now the Duca de Sessa, had acquired, it is said, nearly enough promises to elect. He took the trouble to remind Madruzzo of the five candidates preferred by Philip II, and at the last moment he added the name of Ippolito Aldobrandino [Petrucci II, p. 375].\n\nTwo parties were in evidence, one led by Cardinal Andrea Peretti di Montalto (the nephew of Sixtus V) and the Spanish party which was supporting Giulio Antonio Cardinal Santorio (of Caserta, a Spanish subject). The King of Spain (according to a report of Marquis Muti to the Duke of Savoy on January 4 [Petruccelli, II, p. 367], had provided a list of candidates, which included Madruzzo, Santorio [Santa Severina], Paleotto, Ptolomeo Galli [Como], and Colonna. Santorio (Sanseverino) had been much disliked by the recently deceased Pope Innocent.\n\nOn the Saturday, January 11, there was a disgraceful spectacle in the Pauline Chapel, as the Spanish party attempted to install Cardinal Santorio by acclamation, but they were vigorously resisted by Cardinals Altemps, Gesualdi and Colonna. There were thirty-six cardinals gathered in the Pauline Chapel, the election venue, and they could have elected Santorio, if they had had the nerve to attempt to do so, and if they were genuinely inspired and genuinely united in their desire. But as often happens in Conclaves, individuals are swept along for the moment, and on reconsideration they regret their enthusiasm. Cardinal Gesualdo, the Dean, advised Santorio to forgive those who were excluding him so that they could all proceed in peace. Santorio replied that he considered all the cardinals his brothers, and that he did not want to pressure anyone and cause a scandal, and that they should make a count of those in each chapel. This took some three hours. The standoff continued, and it was becoming apparent that the election by acclamation could not be accomplished unanimiter et concorditer, as the traditional phrase puts it. Gesualdo's even-handedness, despite the fact that he was a supporter of the Spanish interest, was a matter of surprise and admiration.\n\nThe two Colonna cardinals, Marcantonio and Ascanio, were in opposing assemblies, the one in the Sistine Chapel, the other in the Pauline. Altemps and Montalto could only assemble seventeen contrarians in the Sistine Chapel, which was insufficient to constitute an exclusiva. The elder Colonna, Marcantonio, sent a message from the Sistine to Ascanio, who thereupon announced that he would not support Santorio because he was not given by God. \"Lo Spirito santo non vuole santa Severina, ne anco le vuole Ascanio Colonna.\" The enthusiasm for Santorio collapsed. Then Sforza, Sfondrati and Aquaviva proclaimed loudly that there was no election (de nullitate electionis). Some of Santorio's supporters, who had been blocking the door of the Pauline Chapel to keep others from exiting after Ascanio Colonna, were compelled to give way. Some wanted Gesualdo to proceed to the Mass of the Holy Spirit and then to a Scrutiny, but he declined to do so while theree were two groups of cardinals in two different chapels. Those in the Sistine Chapel needed to be formally asked if they would come to the Pauline Chapel and join in the adoratio. He and Cardinal Madruzzo were deputized to carry out that task. Cardinal Altemps replied to their request on behalf of the minority, that, since they had not been invited to the adoratio and the majority had not observed the rules, they did not want to be present at such a gathering, and for their part they would have a Mass in the Sistine Chapel. On that day, therefore, there were two separate Masses of the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, the minority cardinals sent in their ballots to the Scrutiny that the majority was conducting. Being informed that the votes were going to be given openly rather than secretly, they entered a protest against irregular procedure, and summoned one of the Masters of Ceremonies who was a Protonotary Apostolic, to legally and properly record the Protest. Cardinal Bonelli, who had been on his knees praying the entire time of all of the disturbances and had not said one word, finally stood up and said to his associates, \"I have been praying to God to inspire me as to what I should do. But, having felt nothing in my heart to speak to me in favor of Sanseverino [Santorio], I see that Our Lord does not want this man to be pope.\"\n\nWhen the Cardinals in the Pauline Chapel hesitated as to whether to open the ballots and under what terms, Santorio claimed that the ballot did not matter one way or the other, since he had already been canonically elected. He would take the name Clement, to show that he would be clement to those who had opposed him. But when the votes were counted, the Spaniards could muster only 30 votes, followed by two more (Montalto and Pinelli) on the accessio. Humiliated, Sanseverino returned to his cell alone. His cell, however, had been completely plundered by the Conclavists, who expected his proclamation as pope. His supporters, though, were not completely discouraged and began canvassing for additional hopes. They also looked forward to the arrival of Cardinal de Joyeuse and of Andreas of Austria, who might tip the balance in Santorio's favor.\n\nSantorio had not, of course, been canonically elected. The Mass of the Holy Spirit had not yet been sung. No formal written scrutiny had been taken until after his claim was made. For an Election by \"Inspiration\" to be valid, all cardinals had to be present and had to agree; neither condition had been fulfilled. The Cardinal Dean, Gesualdo would not have the Mass said, nor a Scrutiny held, until all the Cardinals were in the same chapel.\n\nOn January 12, Cardinal de Joyeuse arrived.\n\nOn January 18, Ambassador Belisario Vinta informed the Grand Duke of Tuscany that he had gained access to the secret list of approved Spanish candidates [Petruccelli, II, p. 390]:\n\nSa Majesté veut Aldobrandino. On a vit l’ordre : donc, ou Santa Severina ou Aldobrandino. Sesso ne peut pas faire violence à Madruzzo et lui montrer de la défiance. Il dira quel’on hate le conclave. Monti a donné des coups de poing à deux cardinaux qui médisaient de Votre Altesse. On attend Autriche pour en finir avec Santa Severina.\n\nOn Saturday, January 25, after the Communion of the daily Mass, which had been celebrated by the Sacristan, he asked permission of the Cardinals to address them with a few remarks which had come to him by inspiration (petens licentiam posse dicere aliqua verba, quae ex inspiratione dixit venisse). His request was not granted, and he was instructed to finish the Mass. Apparently the rule was that the Holy Spirit speaks only through the Eminent Cardinals. On the same day, the Viaticum was administered to Cardinal della Rovere, who was in extremis. He died at the eighth hour of the night [Diary of Msgr. Paolo Alaleone, in Gattico I, p. 343]. According to local Roman time, it was already January 26. He had been an opponent of Cardinal Santorio.\n\nOn the 26th, Vinta wrote again to Grand Duke Ferdinando:\n\nDella Rovere est mort de pétéchies. L‘autre soir s’éleva le bruit de Colonna; Sforza l' apaisa par la menace de Santa Severina. Grandes difficultés partout. Nous n’échapperons pas Aldobrandine. Madruzzo ne recule pas devant cette élection. Les Espagnols se réchauffent pour Colonna, après un billet de Sessa pour nous dépiter.\n\nHaving finally given up on Santorio, his supporters turned to Cardinal Madruzzo, the fifty-nine year old Bishop of Trent, the manager of the Imperial faction and Spanish faction. Florence (Alessandro de' Medici), Monte (a confidante of the Grand Duke of Tuscany), and Morosini the Venetian, however, were opposed to his candidacy. His party had expected the support of Cardinal Montalto (Alessandro Damasceni Peretti, the grand-nephew of Sixtus V) and his faction—which was not forthcoming.\n\nOf the seven Cardinals who were on the list of acceptable candidates supplied by King Philip II, only the seventh, Cardinal Aldobrandini could muster support outside the Spanish faction. Cardinal Montalto was happily aware that Aldobrandini could muster thirty-four votes, as he stated in a letter he wrote to Camilla Peretti, the sister of Sixtus V [Petruccelli, II, p. 391]. After some considerable resistance on the part of Cardinal Madruzzo, who was doubtless disappointed in his own hopes, and was giving consideration to other candidates in his party, Ptolomeo Galli of Como (who was highly desired by King Philip II), Gabriele Paleotto the Bishop of Sabina, and Marc'Antonio Colonna Bishop of Palestrina. He finally gave way and endorsed the candidacy of Cardinal Aldobrandini on behalf of the Spanish and the Empire. This was the first time, on the evening of the 29th, that he revealed to his supporters the permission to elect Aldobrandini which had been given him on the opening day of the Conclave [Petruccelli II, p. 391]. On Thursday, January 30, at 19:00 hours, Ippolito Cardinal Aldobrandini (Clement VIII) was finally elected Pope. He had been a power in the reign of Sixtus V, serving both as Papal Datary (the manager of most papal patronage, except for bishoprics) and as Major Penitentiary.\n\nOn February 2, 1592, Clement VIII was consecrated bishop by Cardinal Alfonso Gesualdi, Dean of the College of Cardinals [Diary of Stefano Antonio Romano: Cancellieri, p. 154]. On the 9th he was crowned by Francesco Cardinal Sforza, the Cardinal Protodeacon, and on April 12 he took possession of the Lateran Basilica.\n\nA month after the election, on March 12, 1592 the Ambassador of Ferrara at the Papal Court, Claudio Rangoni the Bishop of Reggio, wrote to the Duke of Ferrara [Petruccelli II, pp. 401-402]:\n\nLe cardinal Canano [Giulio Canani, of Ferrara] me disait avoir appris par le cardinal Mattei que Sa Sainteté vit dans un soupçon continuel, à propos des mets qu’il mange; qu’il a pris à son service un cuisinier du cardinal Farnese, auquel cuisinier il a parlé et ordonné de ne pas s'adjoindre d`aides et de ne pas laisser hanter la cuisine à qui que ce soit, son maitre d’hôtel excepté. Ces préoccupations du saint-père tiennent en alarme continuelle sa cour. Il est certain, et j’ai entendu dire par plusieurs cardinaux, que Sa Sainteté fit brûler sa mule qui avait été baisée par le duc de Sessa.\n\nEvidently the new Pope went in fear of Spanish poison."
