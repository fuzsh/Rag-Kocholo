        "text": "Many denizens of City Hall have been spotted lately on doorsteps across town in search of votes.\n\nBut wait, didn't they just get elected seven month ago? This time, the councillors (and some staff) are out in droves to help their favourite candidates in the June 28 federal election. Of course, ahem, off hours or on leave from City Hall.\n\nIn York Centre, Councillor Maria Augimeri (who months ago scotched rumours she would run for the New Democratic Party) is backing the party's flag-bearer, Peter Flaherty. But deputy mayor Mike Feldman is backing Conservative Michael Mostyn. Both are likely to be disappointed in their bid to defeat Liberal newcomer Ken Dryden.\n\nEtobicoke North Councillor Rob Ford is handing out leaflets for Tory Rupinder Nanner, while Mr. Ford's aide, Andrew Pask, is slaving away for Conservative candidate Rick Byers in Oakville.\n\nIn Trinity-Spadina, Ann Ball, assistant to deputy mayor Joe Pantalone, and Bob Gallagher, an aide to Councillor Olivia Chow, have taken leaves to help Ms. Chow defeat Liberal incumbent Tony Ianno. Davenport Councillor Adam Giambrone's assistant Brendan Agnew-Iler is helping the local NDP candidate, Rui Pires.\n\nMs. Augimeri says the heavy activity by local councillors in a close election will help Toronto no matter who wins on election day. \"We'll have friends,\" she says. \"One of the three parties will make it.\"\n\nThat's also the view of Don Valley East Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong, campaign chairman and fundraiser for former provincial Tory cabinet minister Dave Johnson. In Don Valley East, he hopes to knock off Liberal newcomer Yasmin Ratansi.\n\n\"Having [political]relationships enables me to do my job better,\" says Mr. Minnan-Wong, who says there's an extra bonus if the winner lands in cabinet.\n\nWhatever the results, Mr. Minnan-Wong has already contributed to the Conservatives: His executive assistant, Rebecca Thompson, is off to Tory headquarters in Ottawa.\n\nMister looking for good bar\n\nIn the most recent issue of fab, a Toronto gay magazine, His Blondness, Mayor David Miller, gets advice from the writers about his pressing challenges for Pride Week, which begins on Monday.\n\nAfter a long day of marching in the Pride parade, the married father of two wants to know where to find a gay bar with a \"warm smile and a cold beer.\"\n\nMr. Miller, the cover model in the magazine's current issue, also wants to find a watering hole that features jazz. \"Particularly if they're playing a good saxophone, \" adds the mayor. \"I love it.\"\n\nThe magazine's remedy? For jazz, it's Zipperz on Carleton Street. The coldest beer can be found at Church Street bars, including George's Play, which has its cooler set at just one degree Celsius.\n\nIf only every problem at City Hall was so easily solved.\n\nServing the, er, public\n\nCouncillors may have to bail out of next week's council meeting early on Wednesday, given their invitation to the opening of a new steak and seafood restaurant in Woodbridge.\n\nSeems that motor-mouth Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti, an investor in a new dining establishment, has invited fellow councillors to the opening. (Generally speaking, councillors are not restricted from second jobs, though they must abide by conflict-of-interest rules.) Attached to the invitation is Mr. Mammoliti's business card, which reads \"I live to serve. After 25 years of serving the public, guess what . . . I'm still serving.\"\n\nMr. Mammoliti says he has no plans to leave politics for the kitchen, at least for now, and promises a big star will show up for the opening next week. That would be former mayor Mel Lastman, in one of his few public appearances since the election.\n\nA debt-free environment\n\nCross off one more councillor who's paid up on election debts.\n\nTo his relief, Scarborough Councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker last week held a $100-a-plate fundraiser that wiped out almost $30,000 in bills.\n\n\"I'm very happy,\" says the freshman councillor and former spokesman for Save the Rouge. \"Coming from the environmental community, we're not exactly rolling in dough.\""
