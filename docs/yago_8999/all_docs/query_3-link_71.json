        "text": "After multiple false attempts due to public concerns, the TTC retired tokens from general circulation on November 30th. TTC booths no longer sell tokens. Instead the TTC is encouraging the public to \"move to a PRESTO card now to avoid potential line ups\". The move was delayed several times due to a myriad of problems with PRESTO. The TTC itself is going after Metrolinx for costs related to PRESTO's for millions and the troubled pay system has created problems for customers from day one.\n\nTokens were simple and their functionality is still years away from being replaced by PRESTO. This affects all transit users, but more so those that face barriers to get around. The design of the PRESTO system was never user friendly, from its retrofit of stations that reduced payment points for the sake of efficiency, to cards that take 24 hours to charge online, to the lack of payment points outside of subway stations.\n\nThe public paid hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a system where it is harder to find a place that can charge your card. Whereas before, you could go into a number of small stores that sold tokens and tickets, now only Shoppers Drug Mart carries them and they are not everywhere. In buses and streetcars, every single user of the PRESTO card has run into broken equipment. The problem in development may be the lack of foresight into how people use transit and what their needs are.\n\nCase in point are the criticisms of the change from social and community workers and schools. There were people out there that needed free tokens to bridge gaps that allowed them to go to a job interview, attend school or receive health care services. For someone out of a job, going to 5 interviews with the price of tickets for adults being what it is, can add up quickly and prevent them from trying. Some students sometimes skip school because they cannot afford a bus ticket every day and this can lead to lower grades. Schools know this and always have bus tokens on hand. The new PRESTO system does not allow for an easy exchange of a single trip fare.\n\nThis again is a design problem that other transit systems have already figured out. Since we are behind here in Toronto, an exception is being made for some of the social agencies and school boards. They will continue to have access to tokens until the system is more functional. The TTC thinks it has lost $3.4 million in fares due to the pay system. The app itself is still being upgraded and several years into it, there are many functionalities that are still a work in progress.\n\nNeedless to say that the consensus is that this was not an improvement, as much as moving towards a regional payment system was necessary. Tokens will be missed.\n\nOn October 21, Canada and Downsview voted for a new Federal Government. After a very messy election, the result was a Liberal Minority government and the Conservatives as the official opposition, with the NDP and Bloc Québécois holding the balance of power.\n\nEvery time there is an election in Canada, Ontario voters seem to be given two picks. With one exception 30 years ago, since Confederation in 1867 voters have only made one of two choices at the ballot box in Ontario: red or blue. We vote Liberal when we cannot stomach the cuts that the blue team is promising to carry out. We vote Conservative when we cannot stomach the corruption and waste of the red team. In this riding we lean red federally for decades.\n\nHere is a list of what bouncing between the blue team and the red team have gotten us:\n\nHousing that is unaffordable in the GTA because the government stopped building cooperative housing and affordable rentals in the 1990s.\n\nNearly 30 years of unfulfilled promises for a Universal Childcare Strategy.\n\nRising medication costs, because pharmacare is not a priority for the two main parties.\n\nThe most expensive phone bills in North America, and bad internet coverage.\n\nThe most expensive monthly metropass in North America, and bad bus service.\n\nThese issues affect all of us day in and day out. Whether we are stuck in traffic because public transit is not an efficient way to get around, or we are jammed in a hospital where there are not enough nurses to treat us when we need help the most. Many people have to choose between buying their prescriptions and paying their rent on time, even if they work more than 40 hours per week.\n\nThese are all things that governments in other places have tackled and worked on. Collectively, people in Ontario seemed to feel that we avoided the cutting of programs from another Conservative government. But same as the blue team - the priority of the red team on the first day after the election were tax cuts for the rich and to build a pipeline for Alberta.\n\nThere is very little difference between the priorities of the blue and the red teams. This is why when we vote for the same people, we get the same results.\n\nAll of Toronto’s representation is from the red team. It is as if we threw a red carpet over all of the GTA to cover up all that is wrong from the last decision we took in Ontario - hoping it would make up for it.\n\nThe good news is that minority governments tend not to last the full term, so there might be an opportunity to demand more and to demand differently sooner rather than later. The same old decision to go back and forth between red and blue is not moving us forward as a society.\n\nIn March, the Downsview Advocate printed a story about my son with autism, Misha, and what the Ontario Autism Program (OAP) changes announced in February meant for children on the autism spectrum and their families. The article highlighted the importance of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy, an evidence-based best practice treatment for children with autism, and how the changes proposed by the Ford Government would not allow most children to access this life changing therapy.\n\nThe OAP program changes were a ‘one size fits all’ plan that did not address the individual needs of the child. I was devastated that other children would not get the therapy they desperately needed. As a result, along with other parents and advocates, I attended rallies, visited MPPs and organized my community demanding the government to not go through with those changes.\n\nI met with my local MPP, Roman Baber. At first meeting I was disheartened by his support of the OAP changes, nonetheless, I continued to meet with him. At one meeting, I showed him a video of my son practicing for his Bar Mitzvah and explained this was only possible because of the therapy he received. Roman was intrigued and attended Misha’s Bar Mitzvah.\n\nThe ceremony was very moving and meaningful. All in attendance were in tears because they knew how far Misha had come. Roman witnessed the benefits of ABA therapy firsthand.\n\nIn April, Roman Baber was asked by Premier Ford to review the Government’s Autism plan. He continued to meet with me along with many other autism advocates and professionals. Baber’s review of the OAP and later termed as the “Baber Report” was shared with the Government’s Autism Advisory Panel and then subsequently leaked by the Globe and Mail on June 28th. In the Baber Report, Roman courageously criticized his own government’s plan and called for an immediate reset to the Government’s Autism plan.\n\nOn July 29, the Ontario Government acknowledged that its proposed changes to the autism program were wrong and they reversed the course of the OAP. Many Ontario autism advocates, including myself, praised Baber for his work and feel all the rallies along with Baber’s report set the stage for the government to change its direction and provide families with funding based on the needs of individual children.\n\nThe revised OAP announced by the government would be needs-based, sustainable, within $600 million and would treat as many children as possible.\n\nThe Ontario autism advisory panel made up of parents with lived experience, autistic adults, educators and other experts from a range of disciplines released their report on October 30th. This report included many excellent recommendations. However, an implementation committee needs to be created in order to implement panel's recommendations. Implementation of the new program is planned for April 2020.\n\nMany children have lost valuable time not having access to therapy. It will be well over a year from announcement of the disastrous plan back in February to the new OAP program implementation in April 2020. Still, I extend a thank you to my MPP, Roman Baber, and all the advocates that made the government see the error of their ways.\n\nGrowing up I was never one of the kids who left school early or came in late because I had a dentist appointment. From a young age I knew that dentist visits were very expensive and not a financial priority in my household. In short, we just couldn’t afford it.\n\nWhen low-income families have rent, groceries, commuting, and other expenses it is very hard to prioritize or justify spending hundreds of dollars on dental care for themselves or their children. Yet dental care is important and has a very strong connection with our overall health.\n\nAccording to research done by Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research “An unhealthy mouth, especially if you have gum disease, may increase your risk of serious health problems such as heart attack, stroke, poorly controlled diabetes and preterm labor.” This means that without regular visits to the dentist it can be almost impossible to determine whether you suffer from gum disease or any other oral health problems like Gingivitis, Periodontitis, or Trench mouth which if left unchecked can lead to more serious health problems.\n\nResearch shows that dental care is an important part of our health, yet it is privatized and not accessible for many people in our city. Seeing as we have universal health care it almost doesn’t make sense that dental care is not included under the OHIP umbrella. Here are some average costs, in Canadian dollars, for common dental procedures:\n\nLarge Tooth Filling: $325 Small Tooth Filling: $80 (Silver Filling), or $200 (White Filling) Root Canal: $800 Dental Crown: $1425 (Gold), or $1625 (Porcelain) Dental Bonding: $450 Invisalign Braces: $7, 249 Veneer: $1, 750 Adult Dental Exam: $133 Child Dental Exam: $67 Tooth Extraction: $136 (starting at)\n\nGood dental health can be achieved with good oral hygiene, yet this does not prevent an overbite, teeth-grinding, wisdom teeth eruptions, the need for braces, or an injury.\n\nMy parents always taught my brother and I to practice good dental hygiene and luckily neither one of needed braces or suffered from any mouth injuries. However, this luck ran out when I was in University and my wisdom teeth started giving me issues. I could feel the teeth growing at the back of my mouth and it caused me a lot of pain and headaches. Through my University I had dental insurance, a mere $500 for a procedure that would cost in the thousands - the average wisdom teeth procedure for the extraction of all four teeth costs about $2300. This seems impossible when you are a student who is in school full time and trying to make ends meet.\n\nIt is easier to prioritise the cost of food, books, or commuting over oral surgery. Thankfully, I had a very nice and accommodating dentist who suggested I only take out one of my wisdom teeth (the one that was growing sideways and was causing the most discomfort) and he also suggested doing the procedure without being put to sleep. I was a bit afraid since most of the people I knew who had the procedure were put to sleep first and complained a lot about the recovery. The procedure was very comfortable even though I was awake and since I only pulled one tooth the recovery was quick. The tooth had already erupted so the procedure was quite simple\n\nI did this over my undergrad two more times as my insurance would renew every September. It took some patience and a lot of Advil to combat the headaches and overall discomfort I would experience from time to time. It wasn’t until last year that I finally took out my last wisdom tooth when I found a job with a good insurance plan and did not have to pay out of pocket for the final procedure.\n\nRecently, I also began grinding my teeth in my sleep which would lead to painful migraines as soon as I would wake up. If I wasn’t lucky enough to have my work insurance, it would be back to Advil and pain management. A mouthguard can cost anywhere between $300-$1000 dollars plus consultation fees. This is not a realistic expense for low-income families, let alone those with small children.\n\nUniversal dental care should be implemented in Canada especially for families and children who should not have to prioritize living costs over their health. Good oral hygiene only goes so far and we must consider all other issues that can not be prevented.\n\nI love my child. But honestly, what I would love more than anything right now is something even close to a good night’s sleep.\n\nFar too often, my nightly state of bliss, those precious and magical few hours where I can close my eyes and maybe, if I’m lucky, fall asleep, abruptly come to an end when I hear something loud and whiny.\n\nTo no one’s surprise, it was my son, crying. Oh Joy! It was 2:30 a.m., and I think: “I have to deal with this now. Goodbye sleep, hello crying child.”\n\nI rushed over to his room, and a mixture of exhaustion and panic set in. “Maybe something is wrong, maybe he is hurt,” I thought. I picked him up and started asking him what was wrong. Obviously, my one year-old son couldn’t answer me yet, but I tried anyways.\n\nWhen situations like this occur, my go-to solution is food - always food. I mean, if he is eating he can’t cry, right?! I was still completely exhausted, but I decided to take him into the kitchen and get him some food.\n\nIn the meantime, my son’s cries have now woken up my husband and I worried that because we live in an apartment, he may have woken up the neighbours as well - so I move even faster to take him to the kitchen.\n\nMy husband held him while I struggled to find something, anything, to feed him. Of course, my son wanted ME to hold him and as his crying got louder, I got more nervous.\n\nI frantically rummaged through my refrigerator and I found two simple items, a yogurt and a mini muffin and I quickly presented them to him as a gift from me to him. He looked at them, then me, then again at the food and finally decided on the mini muffin.\n\n“Thank goodness,” I said to my husband, and we both breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nAs my son rested on my shoulder finishing his muffin, his satisfied expression let us know that he was in the comfortable in the presence of his mommy and daddy. Even in the midst of exhaustion and worrying that I didn’t have enough strength to carry him, my toddler wrapped his arms as tight around me as he could, tucked his head under my chin and peacefully rested it on my chest.\n\nThrough these actions, he showed us that he knows we are always there to provide him comfort.\n\nAfter that, we lay on the couch together, my son was on my chest, my husband was in the bedroom, already fast asleep, and soon enough, so were we.\n\nWe did it! Or should I say, I did it! Another “I love you mommy and daddy” moment.\n\nThese are the kinds of moments I think all parents need, just knowing that your kiddo loves and appreciates you makes it worth all of the (mostly) sleepless nights.\n\nI must say that, despite all of this, I truly feel blessed to have a little one and to hear the words “momma… and dada…” come out of his mouth.\n\nOn Saturday, August 17, Hispanic Mothers with Autistic and ADHD Children Ontario (HAACO) hosted their first official meet and greet event in our community. Attendees included local NDP MPP of Humber River-Black Creek, Tom Rakocevic, PC MPP of York Centre, Roman Baber, federal NDP candidate for York Centre, Andrea Vasquez Jimenez, and former Toronto City Councillor and current federal NDP candidate of Humber River-Black Creek, Maria Augimeri.\n\nThe event brought together a room full of parents and advocates from the autism community, including local residents and those throughout the GTA and Hamilton region. The event was hosted by Casa Maiz and the youth leaders who work at the cultural centre, and sponsored by Beyond the Spectrum. Representatives from It's Medically Necessary, a grassroots awareness campaign outlining why autism therapy should be deemed medically necessary in Canada, attended to show support.\n\nSusel Munoz, founder and director of HAACO, introduced her organization and spoke to her own experiences as a Hispanic and Latinx mother of four children on the autism spectrum. HAACO's mission is to raise awareness about autism and ADHD while reaching out to parents about the tools and resources available to help them advocate for their children. Volunteer Coordinator, Diana Radonich worked with Susel to make this event inclusive, informative and moving for all in attendance.\n\nGiven the challenges faced by parents of children who on the spectrum, Susel shared what motivates her and opened the floor for other parents to discuss their own experiences. All parents vocalized that there continues to be a strong need for substantial improvements, especially provincial and federal investments in order to make the support system financially fair and accessible for everyone who needs it.\n\nSusel asked working professionals, policy experts, and residents to lend a hand or donate to help strengthen the cause, especially members from the Hispanic and Latinx community. She added that all levels of government need to use an \"equity and inclusion lens in terms of how they engage with communities and develop policies regarding the autism file.\" At this time, most parents, especially those in the Hispanic and Latinx community are not given the same tools and resources as other groups, meaning that they ultimately get less of what they need. Susel said that this is due to the \"narrow and exclusionary perspective\" of the current policies and programs in place.\n\nSusel highlighted that there are many challenges prior to and post-diagnosis for marginalized people in Ontario. Andrea Vasquez Jimenez expressed about how proud she was to see Hispanic and Latinx community leaders like Susel leading an initiative centred on the real issues. Vasquez Jimenez said that moving forward she will call for greater inclusion and more research to be conducted in the Hispanic and Latinx community with regards to the autism file.\n\nMaria Augimeri spoke to the importance of education and about how data collection will help HAACO materialize and educate the public about autism and ADHD. Susel said that her organization is committed to using methods like surveys, in order to gather feedback about the diverse needs within the community, saying that HAACO plans to \"use data to put together educational seminars and workshops.\"\n\nMPP Tom Rakocevic gave Susel a scroll for all of her hard work and dedication to the community. He also shared a speech about the importance of developing a needs-based file that represents the real needs of all ASD and ADHD families, calling for responsible collaboration among government. Susel reinforced that constant research will help outline the varying needs and shape the messaging going forward, and that all levels of government must work together to make progress a reality. Given the recent cuts at the provincial level by the Premier, families are worried about their children's futures. PC MPP Roman Baber also gave a speech showing his support for ASD and ADHD families in the area.\n\nVisit HAACO's social media pages, website and GoFundMe for further information about the launch of Hispanic Mothers with Autistic and ADHD Children Ontario.\n\nFacebook: Hispanic Mothers with Autistic and ADHD Children Ontario\n\nWebsite: www.haaco.org\n\nGoFundMe: www.gofundme.com/helps-us-become-a-nonfor-profit-organization"
