        "text": "TORONTO, Sept. 26 /CNW/ - Today, Councillor Maria Augimeri (Ward 9 York Centre); Jim Leek, brother of Robert Leek; Fulvia Leek (nee Coccorocchio), wife of Robert Leek; David Leek, son of Robert Leek; and City of Toronto representatives, along with the Toronto Professional Fire Fighters' Association, commemorated the significant contributions of Toronto Fire Services District Chief Bob Leek with a park refurbishing and naming.\n\nRobert Leek was a 25-year Toronto Fire Services veteran who responded to a propane explosion in 2008 and succumbed to a heart attack while carrying out his duties.\n\n\"It is with great pride that the City of Toronto honours fallen Toronto Fire Services District Chief Bob Leek with this park which bears his name,\" said Councillor Augimeri. \"As a teacher and mentor, Bob used his knowledge and expertise to help people. As District Chief of Emergency Planning, Bob chose to aid the field operations on August 10, 2008 and died while performing his duty. I believe Bob would have liked to be remembered for that.\"\n\nBob was an instructor at the Fire Academy, where he utilized his communications skills to teach others about fire service hydraulics and fire pumps, both very complicated subjects. Bob was later promoted to District Chief of Emergency Planning.\n\n\"Not only will the memory of District Chief Bob Leek be remembered by the men and women of the Toronto Fire Services; with the creation of the park, his memory will forever be woven into the fabric of this community,\" said Fire Chief William Stewart.\n\nParminder Singh Saini, who also lost his life at the site of the explosion, was also commemorated with the unveiling of a new plaque in his honour.\n\nThe park features a new junior playground, trees, benches, a walkway and a pergola. New playground equipment and decorative metal fencing were installed at the park thanks to donations from the following organizations:\n\nAmalgamated Transit Union, Local 113\n\nBell Canada\n\nBiddington Property Management\n\nBombardier Aerospace\n\nDrywall, Acoustics, Lathing & Insulation, Local 675\n\nEnbridge Gas Inc\n\nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 353\n\nIronworkers, Local 721\n\nLabourers International Union of North America, Local 506\n\nLynn Petersen\n\nMP Charitable Foundation - Bridlepath Property Management\n\nNational Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Union - Canadian Auto Workers, Local 112\n\nParc Downsview Park\n\nToronto Professional Fire Fighters' Association, Local 3888\n\nUnited Association - Journeymen & Apprentices - Plumbing & Pipe Fitting Industry, Local 46\n\nThe following organizations contributed in-kind material and/or labour to support the project:\n\nHome Depot Canada\n\nLabourers International Union of North America, Local 183\n\nTeskey Construction Limited\n\nUnited Brotherhood of Carpenters & Joiners, Local 27\n\nThe City of Toronto's Parks, Forestry and Recreation division has overseen construction of the project through to completion.\n\nToronto is Canada's largest city and sixth largest government, and home to a diverse population of about 2.6 million people.
