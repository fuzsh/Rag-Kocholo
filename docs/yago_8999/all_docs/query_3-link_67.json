        "text": "Article content\n\nIn 2010 while vying for his fifth municipal term in office, Councillor Norm Kelly made the rounds of steak houses and Asian food restaurants, charging thousands of dollars to his campaign expense account.\n\nKelly and his team visited the Blackhorn Steak House on Ellesmere Rd. nine times — enjoying Sidecars, Beefeater gin, Escargots, Surf Turf (filet) mignon and Carmel Decadence desserts.\n\nBut according to the receipts I found in his campaign expense file, the Asian Legend, Yueh Tung and Lin Garden restaurants were all expensed as well to Kelly’s campaign under the somewhat loosely defined category of Expenses Not Subject to (a candidate’s) Spending Limit.\n\nThe councillor’s $16,008.38 Aug. 3 fundraising function — another expense which does not fall under his $34,000 spending limit — was held way outside Ward 40 at the Rosewater Supper Club, operated by Kelly’s old friend Nick Di Donato.\n\nI found the invoice for that function in his file. But there was no invoice for the $6,000 paid to the “fundraising coordinator” contained in his audited financial statement.\n\nCouncillor Maria Augimeri, who had a tough fight against opponent Gus Cusimano, sent out a letter inviting people to attend her April 30, 2010 fundraiser which included a long list of union heads and corporate bosses as her fundraising committee.\n\nAugimeri paid her executive assistant, Robert Andreacchi, for website design and campaign clean-up out of her campaign war chest — even though it was never clear (and impossible to clarify given city privacy rules) whether he was on an unpaid leave of absence or lieu time as city rules dictate.\n\nGloria Lindsay-Luby’s campaign charged repairs of $472.69 to her 2004 Acura four days after the election and paid Fatima’s Cleaning $105.00 on four separate occasions to clean her election office, which was located in her home.\n\nSpurned on by the recent compliance audits of Mayor Rob Ford and Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti, I spent two days last week looking through the campaign expense files of a selection of councillors.\n\nIn some cases I found a real dog’s breakfast — missing invoices, questionable\n\nuse of office staff for the campaign or questionable expenditures and lavish post-voting day events.\n\nForensic auditor Bruce Armstrong, who did the compliance audit of both Rob Ford’s and Giorgio Mammoliti’s campaign expenses, says he always tells candidates at the outset that they can be assured he “will find something.”\n\nLet’s not forget that those councillors wining and dining their team or constituents before and after election day — or repairing their cars or hiring Fatima to clean their offices — are using significant taxpayer funds to do so.\n\nCampaign donations are eligible for a rebate. Those who use the city’s rebate program are entitled to up to 75% of their donation back, depending on the amount given.\n\n“The municipality is on the hook... (meaning) the taxpayer is on the hook for a share of the rebate,” says Armstrong.\n\nEach candidate is given a spending limit — which is essentially $5,000 plus 85 cents per eligible elector in their ward.\n\nBut candidates can spend both inside and outside of that limit.\n\nChartered accountant Bernie Nayman, who helped craft the framework for the current municipal election finance rules, says essentially all expenses incurred (signs, staff, advertising, office rental) to get a “candidate elected” fall within that limit.\n\nA fundraising event of an activity does not, however, including the use of a coordinator to organize that event or events.\n\n“That’s about as gray as you can get ... the whole fundraising area,” says Armstrong, noting that the Municipal Elections Act does not define what is meant by “activity.”\n\nIf a fundraising coordinator makes phone calls on behalf of the candidate and mentions fundraising merely at the end, that’s considered promotion or advertising, says Nayman.\n\n“They have to organize an event,” says the 78-year-old head of Election Finances International.\n\nArmstrong adds that there is an element of trust and a lot of judgement involved.\n\nCouncillor Michael Thompson was brought before the compliance audit committee in July 2011 for hiring Marcia Stiles, a long-time constituency assistant and his campaign manager, as a fundraiser for $6,000.\n\nThe committee accepted his lawyer’s contentions that fundraising activity should include work on fundraising beyond an actual event and did not pursue any further prosecution as they did with Mammoliti — an interesting outcome considering Nayman’s and Armstrong’s interpretation of the act.\n\nThe post-victory parties are not subject to spending limits either. There is also no limit on how many parties a councillor can hold, which can lead to more excessive spending to get rid of surpluses — seeing as since 2010 those surpluses must now be returned to the city.\n\nTake Raymond Cho, the newly nominated PC candidate for Scarborough Rouge-River. He spent a whopping $14,333.47 on post-election party food, drink, appreciation ads and notices.\n\nHe also paid his adminstrative assistant, Jessica Kim, who was on staff in his office in 2010, $1,800 to be his fundraising coordinator.\n\n“It’s (another) very gray (area),” says Armstrong of using councillor staff to man the campaign.\n\nWhen reached last week, Kelly said he wasn’t close to his campaign stuff and he’d be the “last person to answer” my questions — seeing as his wife, Charlotte, was his campaign manager.\n\n“At this point I’d have to go back and check,” he said.\n\nHe never did get back to me.\n\nLindsay-Luby didn’t respond to an e-mail request for comment. Neither did Cho or Augimeri\n\nNayman says part of the problem is that there are no parties at the municipal level.\n\nAt the provincial and federal level, all decisions are made at the party level and candidates must toe the line.\n\n“This is not so at the municipal level ... everybody is out on his (or her) own,” says Nayman. “That is a problem all by itself because every candidate has a different way of doing things.”\n\nsue-ann.levy@sunmedia.ca"
