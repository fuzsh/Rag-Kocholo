        "text": "In Sun today, S-A Levy:\n\nNine minutes into an emergency North York community council meeting at lunchtime Monday, Cllr. David Shiner moved that a new street in his ward be named “Karen’s Way.”\n\nThe street, which runs east to west between Rean Dr. and Barberry Pl., is located in his Willowdale ward.\n\nA majority of lemmings on the NYCC — Maria Augimeri, Denzil Minnan-Wong, Frances Nunziata, Josh Colle and of course Shiner– supported the motion without question.\n\nWhile the cost is not an issue — it’s about $500 to create a new street sign — the choice of name is.\n\nWhile sources tell me Shiner would not confirm who the “Karen” is in “Karen’s Way,” I might note that Karen Wood was Shiner’s executive assistant for many years at City Hall (I was there when she worked for him and found her to be a nice lady) — until she became his life partner.\n\nFrances Nunziata is part of Etobicoke - York Community council so not sure how she would have been there or able to vote?\n\nIt is a Sue-Ann article so why do you expect total accuracy? :->\n\nQuite an interview with Glenn De Baeremaeker. He tells @DavidNickle that in hindsight, he never should have supported the one-stop Scarborough subway that he and Mayor John Tory spent the past three years defending, calling it a compromise and a \"mistake.\"\n\nThe rats are jumping the ship as the real costs come home to roost- every choice made on the Scarborough subway has been a bad one (not choosing the RT corridor, removing stations, etc.).\n\nBut anyways - De Baeremaeker:"
