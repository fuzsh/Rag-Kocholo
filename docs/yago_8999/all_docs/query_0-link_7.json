        "text": "Maria Augimeri (ˌɔːdʒɪˈmɛəri , maˈriːa audʒiˈmɛːri; born 1954) is a Canadian politician. From 1985 to 2018, she served as a local politician in Toronto, holding office as a school board trustee, and as a council member in North York, Metropolitan Toronto, and on Toronto City Council. In 2019, Augimeri stood as the New Democratic candidate for the riding of Humber River-Black Creek. Born in Italy, Augimeri moved to Canada with her family at the age of 2. Before entering politics, she was a Social Anthropologist at York University. She has written three books on the Italian-Canadian community and is also a published poet. She first entered politics as a school trustee, and was elected to the city council of North York in 1985. She ran for the Ontario New Democratic Party in the 1987 provincial election in the riding of Downsview which her husband, Odoardo Di Santo, held for ten years before losing in the 1985 election. She lost to Liberal Laureano Leone by 174 votes. Augimeri was elected to the Metro Toronto council in 1988, and remained on that council until the creation of the new city of Toronto in 1997. She was elected councillor to the new city council three times. She was known for promoting environmental awareness and cultural issues. She was endorsed for re-election by the Toronto Star newspaper in 2003. The local weekly newspaper Now Magazine also gave her an endorsement in 2000. On August 10, 2008, a massive propane explosion in Augimeri's ward destroyed a propane distribution facility which caused the evacuation of thousands of residents. Augimeri cut short a summer vacation in Italy and returned to Toronto to assist with the situation. During a press conference, she became involved in a heated discussion with Tony Di Santo, head of the local ratepayer's group. She said, \"If people have problems of a partisan nature they should not be using the death of a firefighter... So shut up!\" Later she apologized for losing her temper, \"letting my anger\" (get in the way) in her words. The 2010 Toronto municipal election was held on October 25."
