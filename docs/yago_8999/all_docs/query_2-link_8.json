        "text": "Isabella Farnese, Queen of Spain\n\nOil on canvas. 1723\n\nRanc, Jean\n\nThis is an official portrait of Queen Isabella Farnese (1692-1766), daughter of Eduardo II, Duke of Parma and second wife of Felipe V of Spain (1683-1746), whom she married in 1714. Shown three quarters and sumptuously dressed, the Queen turns her body to the left and her head to the right in an elegant pose characteristic of French portraits of that period. The technique of this painting, with a\n\nIsabella Farnese\n\nOil on canvas. 1718 - 1722\n\nMeléndez, Miguel Jacinto\n\nThe brightly lit figure of Isabella Farnese stands out strongly against a dark background. Her face conforms to the highly idealised and slightly inexpressive prototype that Meléndez used in his numerous portraits of the Queen, but here he has paid particular attention to the depiction of the jewels. In the Queen´s hair a brooch with a large pearl secures the salmon pink ribbon that unfurls\n\nIsabella Farnese, Queen of Spain\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1715\n\nPiane, Giovanni Maria delle\n\nIsabella Farnese (1692-1766), the daughter of Odoardo II, Prince of Parma, and of Dorothea Sophie of Neuburg, married Philip V of Spain in 1714. This portrait is a replica of one made in Parma by Molinaretto, after the Queen´s arrival in Spain, copying a miniature or a portrait prior to her departure from Italy, and from which she later commissioned replicas that she had brought to Spain, giving a\n\nAdoration of the Shepherds\n\nOil on canvas. After 1575\n\nAnonymous (Workshop of: Bassano)\n\nThis is a modest bottega product illustrating the passage on the birth of Christ (Luke 2: 8-20) which lends itself particularly well to a nocturnal setting. It is a replica, not of the Adoration of the Shepherds Jacopo executed in 1590 for San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, as previously believed, but of the painting depicting the same theme housed at the Louvre (inv. 430), which is an entirely autog\n\nVenetian Lady\n\nOil on canvas. Mid-XVIIcentury\n\nAnonymous\n\nThe seated model is sumptuously dressed, with silver-lamé collar and cuffs, a pearl choker and a very dark green dress with silver decorations on her skirt and gold ones on the bodice and sleeves. She has flowers in her hair and long earrings. The heavy crimson velvet curtain behind her is echoed by a matching mat on the buffet. The scene opens onto an urban background that recalls the city\n\nMariana of Austria, Queen Regent\n\nOil on canvas. Second half of the XVII century\n\nAnonymous\n\nMarianne of Austria (1634–1696) was the daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III of Austria and his wife Maria. In 1649, at 15 years old, she was betrothed to her uncle Philip IV, the Great, who was 44 years old at the time. She had five children with him: Princess Margaret Theresa (1651–1673), later Empress of Germany; another girl who died a few days after her birth; Prince Philip Prospe\n\nThe Holy Family with the infant John the Baptist\n\nOil on panel. Ca. 1655\n\nGiordano, Luca\n\nGiordano was particularly gifted at imitating the style of some of the celebrated masters of the past, as evident in this work which evokes Raphael’s pictorial language. More than a mere exercise in imitation, the presence on the rock on the right of two monograms with the letters “RSF VB” (Raphael Sanzio Faciebat Vrbinas) indicates the painter’s probable intention to produce a forgery.\n\nThe Holy Family with Saint Elisabeth and the Infant Saint John\n\nOil on panel. Ca. 1697\n\nGiordano, Luca (Imitation of: Raphael (Raffaello Sanzio))\n\nGiordano’s contemporaries were particularly dazzled by his ability to recreate the style of certain past masters. This panel clearly recalls similar works by the Renaissance genius Raphael, featuring the Holy Family or the Madonna and Child. Though by no means imitative in execution, it conveys an atmosphere similar to that captured by Raphael’s paintings.\n\nLiberation of Saint Peter\n\nOil on canvas. 1639\n\nRibera, Jusepe de, lo Spagnoletto\n\nSaint Peter lies in prison where his sleep is interrupted by an angel who frees him. This subject allows Ribera to create a work in which he can show the very best of his mature style. The work combines his naturalist style with strong chiaroscuro effects and with the warm palette that Ribera used increasingly in the last years of the 1630s. This painting forms a pair with Jacob’s Dream (P-1117) w\n\nJacob’s Dream\n\nOil on canvas. 1639\n\nRibera, Jusepe de, lo Spagnoletto\n\nThis painting tells of Jacob the Patriarch´s mysterious dream, as told in Genesis. He appears asleep, lying on his left shoulder with a tree behind him. On the other side is the ladder of light, by which the angels ascend and descend. This subject demonstrates Ribera´s skill at constructing metaphoric discourse. He uses the image of a shepherd resting in the countryside to describe one of the best\n\nThe penitent Saint Jerome\n\nOil on canvas. 1652\n\nRibera, Jusepe de, lo Spagnoletto\n\nEmerging from a dark background, a half-length image of a man appears in the close foreground, his right shoulder and arm bare, his hair white and long, his features aged. He holds a wooden cross in his left hand and with his right he strikes his chest with a stone. The cross identifies him as a saint; his nakedness and dishevelled appearance indicate he is a hermit or a penitent; the stone with w"
