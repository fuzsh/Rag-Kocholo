The Title, Objectives, suggestions, and other information in this website are going to be changed later after everything is finalized by the Planning Committee. This website will be deleted, or replaced when the Official Website of the Association is available.\n\n============================================================================================\n\nBackground Information:\n\nThere is a plan to establish an Organization that will unite the Filipino – Canadian Citizens residing in Ward 9, Downsview area. The main objective is to have a united representation of residents with Philippine Heritage in Downsview. With regards to this plan a meeting was held in Councillor Maria Augemeri’s Office last March 20, 2014.\n\nFilipino Community Association\n\nThis Association is still in the planning stage after the organizational meeting held in the Office of Councillor Maria Augimeri on March 20, 2014.\n\nThe meeting was chaired bv :\n\nBeckey Cezar-Redublo (416-317-2390 beckycesar@rogers.com).\n\nClick for address >>>> Office Map Link .\n\nThe following Planning Committee Members attended the first meeting :\n\nClick >>>> HERE !\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————-\n\nThe main supporter of the proposed Association is Councillor Maria Augimeri.\n\nAbout Maria Augimeri: (Details are also available in brochures).\n\nMaria Augimeri is the City of Toronto Councillor for Ward 9-York Centre, serving the Downsview community with passion and commitment since her first election as School Trustee in 1982. She was elected to North York City Council in 1985; Metro Council in 1998, 1991 and 1994 and Toronto Council in 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2010.\n\nCouncillor Augimeri is Chair of the North York Community Council and the Aerospace Action Partnership. She is the Vice-Chair of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. The Councillor is a member of the Toronto Transit Commission and was the Chair of the the York University, City of Toronto Track and Field Centre Committee.\n\nAs a published author, Councillor Augimeri’s passion for the written word was evident in her position as the first Chair of the City’s Language Equity and Literacy Working Group where she presided over the City’s historic Literacy Hearings. The Councillor was successful in building a new public library replete with computer lab to the Jane and Sheppard area.\n\nMaria Augimeri is an Honours Graduate of English and Anthropology and a former instructor of Social Anthropology at York University. She is the author of three published works on the Italian-Canadian community. Ms. Augimeri’s poetry has also been published in Canada. Some of her books may be found in Toronto public libraries and the libraries of York University.\n\nThe Councillor’s commitment to local revitalization measures is evidenced through the many projects flourishing in the Downsview area. Wilson Avenue, in fact, was granted special redevelopment measures and beautification plans. Community partnerships have resulted in impressive murals in the Northwood Community Centre and along Wilson Avenue. The planting of trees along Keele St., Jane St., Wilson Ave. and Sheppard Ave. W.; the substantial beautification of City boulevards along these major thoroughfares; the enhancement of local parks and parkettes– these strategies all come together to make Downsview an attractive and appealing place to live.\n\nCouncillor Augimeri operates a Community Service Office where she meets with constituents on a weekly basis. She has held Property Tax Assessment Clinics for local residents and has handled thousands of property tax appeals throughout her 28 years in public office. Fairness and equity of property assessment has long been of primary interest to the Councillor, who has served as Vice-Chair of the City’s Assessment and Property Tax Task Force.\n\nMs. Augimeri was born in Italy and immigrated to Toronto at the age of 2. She is married to former Downsview MPP Odoardo Di Santo. They have two children — Vittoria and William."
