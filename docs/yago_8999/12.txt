Toronto has a love affair with the condo, with 28,466 new-build units purchased in 2011. Thousands more are planned. Suite size, price, amenities and architecture are important, but more and more, a building’s neighbourhood is being considered the ultimate draw. The 10th part of a lengthy series examining the GTA’s new condo ’hoods.

Maria Augimeri calls it the “point of convergence.”

Dressed for crisp winter weather in a camel-coloured coat, she’s driving through the neighbourhood of North York West — the Downsview community she’s represented as a councillor since 1985. At one stop after the next she points out change: cranes in the midst of a major construction project on Wilson Avenue, new development at Downsview Park, and freshly laid parks of all shapes and sizes throughout the York Centre ward she represents. In just a few years, the entire community, she says, “will be utterly transformed.”

And if you ask her, it’s been a long time coming.

“It’s been over 15 years in the planning stages, and now it’s about to take off. All of the plans, all of the paperwork, is in place, for a more intensified, vibrant community,” she says. “[The neighbourhood] will have more changes in terms of redevelopment than any other community in Toronto in the next decade.”

The community’s come a long way. Downsview — originally called such for its views looking down over the entire city — was once the site of apple orchards. Later, airplanes that would fly in the Second World War were manufactured there, and military personnel called the area home to be close to the former Canadian Forces base. Today, suburban homes from the 1950s and ’60s mingle with social housing and strip malls.

Change was needed, Ms. Augimeri admits. And now that change is coming: On Wilson, targeted by the city for intensification, there’s a possible Business Improvement Area in the works, condos underway and a new hospital about to start construction. The Spadina subway is being extended through North York West from Downsview through to York University and on to Vaughan. There’s industrial land east of Keele that Ms. Augimeri is working to have rezoned after the 2008 explosion at Sunrise Propane — and then there’s Downsview Park, where bands such as Radiohead sing for thousands of fans and 300 acres is currently being sold for new residential development.

“It’s outstanding for a suburban community,” Ms. Augimeri says. “It would have been haphazard had we not laid the groundwork to ensure proper redevelopment; that took 15 years. And on Wilson, the revitalization is already starting.”

Identified as one of Toronto’s “Avenues” — that is, one of the city’s streets specified for intensification — Wilson Avenue has been the subject of revitalization plans for years. The city hopes to enhance the streetscape to beautify it and make it more pedestrian-friendly, while introducing new development to bring both residents and employment opportunities to the area. That shift is starting to become apparent, through both small endeavours — trees being planted roadside and the new Moth Gardens parkette at Wilson and Keele — as well as larger ones. The new Humber River Regional Hospital is starting construction and the Forensic Services and Coroner’s Complex (a project by the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services) is already underway. Both are located at Wilson and Keele and promise to bring new employment and activity to the area.

“We need a good facelift — changes to give it a new look to attract more people,” says Jim Jammehdiabadi, owner of the AAA Vacuum Superstore on Wilson west of Dufferin. Mr. Jammehdiabadi has been in business in the area for 37 years and is part of a committee that’s currently trying to introduce a Business Improvement Area along the Wilson strip. The Wilson Avenue he envisions would be something not unlike Avenue Road, with a more cohesive, better-looking business community. “That’s what we’re looking for,” he says.

A BIA, Ms. Augimeri adds, would be the final step to a fully revitalized Wilson Avenue, creating a heart to her ward and North York West in general. “It will be revolutionary for the community, because a real BIA has never happened in the Downsview area,” the councillor says, adding that the move would also bring more upscale businesses to the community. “[It could mean] incentives for business, and in turn make property values more valuable.”

And that last bit is good news for the existing neighbourhood. Because — while change is underway — there’s still a loyal community of residents already living in North York West, most of whom Ms. Augimeri says have a strong pride of ownership in homes that have sometimes been in the same family for as long as 45 or 50 years. Largely Italian in population, many of those homeowners are now reaching old age and selling, with younger families and professionals coming into the neighbourhood to create a diverse and engaged community.

Patricia Ferazzutti, now in her thirties, grew up at Bathurst and Lawrence, moving into her current home with her family when she was just four years old. She’s getting ready to move out next year, but she’s not going far, having purchased a condo in one of the new towers under construction at Wilson and Allen. She’ll be just a five-minute drive away from the home where her parents still live; her sister’s house is just minutes away as well. And if you ask her, that’s just perfect — she had no desire to move out of the neighbourhood she already calls home. “The area has all the amenities you need — there’s Yorkdale around the corner, there’s access to the Allen Expressway and the 401,” she says. “Anything you need is right around the corner.”

Ms. Ferazzutti, who’s currently in teacher’s college, hopes to eventually find a job at a school in North York, but if she doesn’t she’s certain that wherever she does need to go will be easily accessible from her new home, with the Wilson subway station across the street and the major highways easily accessible. In fact, the neighbourhood’s convenience, she says, is one of the things she likes most about it. “I’m always joking that from my house to anywhere in the GTA is 20 minutes,” she says. Yet it still feels like a neighbourhood, she adds. “The people are friendly, and there’s no congestion.”

The neighbourhood’s accessibility and his own roots in the community also played into Sal Marrello’s decision to live there. Mr. Marrello lives at Wilson and Dufferin with his wife and three children, and like Ms. Ferazzutti grew up in the neighbourhood — his mother still lives at Allen and Sheppard. He works at Queen’s Park and commutes downtown by subway everyday, but likes that he can take his kids — ages five, three and nine months — to the local parks and to programs at the nearby Ancaster Community Centre. For the family man, 35, the schools were also a main selling point for staying in the area. “If you look at the EQAO testing, their schools are on the higher end of the spectrum,” says Mr. Marrello, who’s oldest son goes to St. Norbert’s Catholic School. “As well, they’re just nicer facilities.”

Despite his strong ties to the neighbourhood, though, Mr. Marrello says that change is needed in North York West. Joe Lepore, owner of the La Traviata Italian restaurant at Wilson west of Dufferin, agrees. For him, the changes coming are welcome. For 26 years, Mr. Lepore and his chef and co-owner Tony Di Falco have served the local Downsview residents. The projects underway, he says, will be good for the entire neighbourhood — creating a strong community with a thriving business community. “We see things coming back,” he says.
