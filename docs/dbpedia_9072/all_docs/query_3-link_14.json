The Award Show Rundown\n\nOn Saturday, October 17, 2009 the stars aligned at the illustrious Times Center in the heart of New York City for the 4th Annual 2009 BLACK GIRLS ROCK! Awards co-hosted by esteemed actresses Regina King and Tracee Ellis Ross. Tapping into her list of diverse philanthropic friends Black Girls Rock! Inc. founder Beverly Bond gathered a stellar and diverse array of presenters and supporters included noted entertainment attorney Londell McMillan, public relations maven and author Terrie Williams, philanthropist Jessica Seinfeld, Essence magazine’s Emil Wilbekin, Hip Hop Icon Doug E. Fresh, celebrity stylist and author June Ambrose, actor Columbus Short, Phil Collen-lead guitarist of the legendary English rock band Def Leppard, Black Enterprise television host and journalist Ed Gordon, Fox News correspondent Lisa Evers, BET News correspondent Jacque Reid, NYC mayoral candidate Bill Thompson, world-renowned fashion designer Catherine Malandrino, music mogul Andre Harrell, DJ Jazzy Joyce, Bethann Hardison and many others. Head HERE for awesome video coverage of the awards done by VH1.\n\nThe evening kicked off with a VIP cocktail reception and silent auction featuring many items donated by the night’s honorees, presenters and supporters. New York City’s Mayor Mike Bloomberg opened the awards show via a personal letter expressing a warm welcome, sincere congratulations, and a heartfelt thank you to BLACK GIRLS ROCK! Inc. founder Beverly Bond. Mayor Bloomberg recognized and exalted Ms. Bond’s efforts in helping to empower young girls of color and for helping to build “a brighter city.”\n\nThe effortless chemistry between entertaining hosts Regina King and Tracee Ellis Ross resonated throughout the event. Their serious voices of reason pertaining to the importance of the evening and their impromptu comedy sketches molded seamlessly together, creating an atmosphere that buzzed with excitement. The night was truly ablaze as inspired honorees and presenters delved deep within themselves and gave personal testimonials from their own lives to coincide with the night’s festivities.\n\nFor the past four years the BLACK GIRLS ROCK! Awards show has served as the premiere fundraising event for BLACK GIRLS ROCK! Inc., a non-profit, youth-empowerment mentoring organization founded by celebrity DJ Beverly Bond. All of the proceeds will go towards operational funding for BLACK GIRLS ROCK! programs. The BLACK GIRLS ROCK! Awards honors the influential achievements of exceptional women of color in fashion, media, business, the arts and entertainment, and public service.\n\nUniversal support for the organization was personified as Phil Collen of Def Leppard and hip hop icon Doug E. Fresh presented the Black Girls Rock! ‘Rock Star’ Award to Queen Latifah. Following a crowd-shaking, musical ode to hip hop icons intro by Doug E. Fresh, an overwhelmed Queen Latifah entered the stage to a standing ovation. The Queen delivered a rousing, emotionally charged acceptance speech in which she reminisced about her childhood years, which ultimately influenced her direction as she morphed into hip hop royalty. She placed special emphasis on the importance of the exceptional and unique programming offered by BLACK GIRLS ROCK!, Inc. Queen Latifah asked for more awareness, sympathy, and prohibitive action towards victims of sexual abuse. Uplifted, she then passionately matched an earlier donation of $25,000 made to the organization.\n\nSPONSORSHIP CONTACT:\n\nMiatta David\n\nMiatta@mvdinc.usoffice : 212.244.5436 fax:212.244.5439\n\nPose For The Camera Now\n\nOn Saturday, October 17, 2009, some of the best and brightest stars from several industries aligned to honor a set of distinguished, internationally-acclaimed women of color.

Awards, the “Jazzy Joyce” DJ Award will be going to none other than DJ Spinderella of Salt-N-Pepa, the best-selling female rap group ever. Named after the legendary DJ Jazzy Joyce, this award goes to the often unacknowledged but incredibly talented and versatile female DJ who contributes greatly to the legacy of hip hop. Born and bred in Brooklyn, Spinderella had an affinity for music and performing at an early age. Spin, as she now prefers to go by, may not have always taken center stage in the videos or at the Salt-N-Pepa concerts, but she was definitely an integral part of the legendary trio and added flavor to the mix with her expert turntable skills. Remember the jam “Ain’t None Of Your Buisness?” Well, Spin actually co-wrote that hit-song, a feat that roused her to become more vocal in the group’s direction. When Salt-N-Pepa officially split in 2002, success continued to follow Spin in the form of multiple broadcasting opportunities, such as a syndicated Friday night show aired on HOT 97 and WPGC in D.C. and a co-hosting stint with Angie Martinez for HOT 97’s Ladies’ Night show. When she’s not rocking the crowds abroad or DJing for high profile events, you can catch this DJ-of-all-Trades on her nationally-syndicated show “The Back Spin.” Head HERE for more info and times.\n\nLast year’s ‘Jazzy Joyce’ DJ Award recipient, DJ Cocoa Chanelle, actually began her music career as an MC, but quickly took to DJing at the age of 14 under her brother’s guidance. If you’re from New York, then chances are you’ve heard DJ Cocoa Chanelle on HOT 97 handling business. Or how about on television, where Chanelle became the first-ever BET resident DJ or the first female DJ to spin at MTV’s “Spring Break” special. All of the achievements that Chanelle has racked up puts her in a league of her own, so honoring ” New York’s Best Kept Secret” was a no brainer.\n\nBoth Spin and Cocoa Chanelle have ultimately helped to pave the way for the young, female DJs of today, like newcomer DJ Diamond Kuts, the 2007 ‘Jazzy Joyce’ DJ Award recipient. At the young age of 22, DJ Diamond Kuts has already done her fair share of history making by becoming the first and only female dj on the air in Philly. Kuts’ famous hip hop father, Grand Tone of the Masters of the Funk, introduced her to the art of dj’ing at an early age, however Kuts has always relied on her own talent, passion, and dedication to achieve her dreams. High School days of dropping her own highly sought after mixtapes then turned into nights of Djing at Philly clubs, which resulted in the opportunity to DJ Lil’ Mama’s 2007 tour as well as perform at the US Open, 106 & Park, MTV TRL and Rap City and on Power 99. We can’t wait to see what other accomplishments this Philly native has in store!\n\nBecause a DJ must know where she came from, to know where she’s going, it would be ludicrous not to discuss the first,the legendary, the ONE AND ONLY DJ Jazzy Joyce, the inaugural recipient of the award which we named in honor of her trailblazing work in the field. At the age of twelve, Joyce had decided that she would dedicate all of her time and energy to learning and honing her DJ skills. Instead of becoming discouraged by the absence of female DJs, this tenacious young woman from the Boogie Down worked even harder at crafting her skills. According to her biography on myspace, “JAZZY picked up her vinyl’s, got herself a pair of Technics (turntables) and practiced so long and hard that she practically ate and slept on them, developing her skills.She made [it] happen for herself.” [1] Joyce’s hard work soon began to pay-off as she quickly became associated with all things hip-hop. Where do we even being? Well, in 1983 Joyce won her 1st DJ award at the New Music Seminar, an achievement that set hundreds more into action, such as becoming the first lady of Funkmaster Flexx’s Big Dawg Pitbulls. To list off all of Joyce’s accomplishments would take more words and space than this post even allows, so be sure to go HERE for a more detailed resume of this inspirational woman. For now, name dropping will have to suffice (it is the music industry, after all): Globe and Whiz Kids, Sweet Trip, M.C Lyte, Africa Bambataa, Digable Planets, Rich Nice, Nenah Cherry, India.Arie, Mystic, Jaguar Wright, Tweet, Missy Elliot, Japan, Copenhagen, Amsterdam…seriously, we’d be here all day people! DJ Jazzy Joyce has proved to the world that females can mix, scratch, and cut with the best of them. So, how does she feel about being a female in a male dominated profession?\n\n“I’ll give props to hot male DJ’s like Grand Master Flash, Red Alert, as well as Kid Kapri”, she says, “but I’ve always known that by being serious and dedicated to my craft, I could be just as good as my male predecessors, and even better”. [2]\n\nAll of the ‘Jazzy Joyce’ DJ Award recipients have shown tremendous fearlessness, dedication, and passion by going against what probably seemed like insurmountable odds. They’ve broken down barriers not only in the DJ world, but in the hip hop world as well, ushering in new generations of eager girls along with them.\n\nSpeaking of female DJ role models, this post wouldn’t be complete without mentioning DJ Beverly Bond, the founder of, yours truly, BLACK GIRLS ROCK! INC. An ill dj in her own right, Bev was not only a winner of the Justo Mixtape Award for Best Female DJ, a monumental award honoring in hip hop DJ skills, but also is known to all as your “DJ’s favorite DJ” by males and females alike.
