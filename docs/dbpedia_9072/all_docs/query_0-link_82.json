        "text": "Sisterhood is powerful, especially when the messages of perseverance and self-respect are as compelling as the ones on the debut albums by singer-rapper Mystic and neo-soulster India.- Arie. Yet the two women’s strengths weren’t always well-served during their Thursday performances at the House of Blues.\n\nThe pair topped the bill on the sold-out last night of the Sisters for Hip-Hop & Soul Tour, which also featured brief sets by a variety of female rap and R&B; artists looking to break out of the pack, including R&B-rockers; Res and Kelis, singer Lina, MC Lyte, and DJ Jazzy Joyce, who provided the between-set sounds.\n\nWith positivity the unifying theme, and cross-pollination of genres the common musical thread, the shadow of such previous standouts as Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu and Jill Scott loomed large. These acts have proved that hip-hop’s women do more than just reveal different aspects of the big picture--they often are at the forefront of innovation while still appealing to a mass audience.\n\nThe two headliners certainly displayed similar potential. A lot of their lessons had to do with love, whether the romantic kind, as in Mystic’s mid-tempo heartbreak ballad “Neptune’s Jewels,” or the inner-focused kind, as in India.Arie’s self-accepting hit “Video.”\n\nAll the acts addressed such girlfriend stuff as man trouble, as well as community issues and self-esteem. But there wasn’t much sharing of the pain (or joy) on stage, as the performers stayed in their own slots and barely even mentioned one another’s presence.\n\nOakland-born Mystic performed her 35-minute set backed only by a turntablist-vocalist, which made the songs from her distinctive debut album, “Cuts for Luck and Scars for Freedom,” sound somewhat more generic. Dressed in a long skirt and top, she projected a soft appearance that belied the tough-yet-compassionate wisdom she imparted.\n\nAlthough her stance was in the street, her lyrics never settled for a life of short brutality. She aspired to make a better world and insisted her people demand more than what they’re getting on such numbers as “The Life” and “Girlfriend Sistagirl.” Her seamless, Hill-like way of shifting from singing to rapping and back helped get across her messages about the system (it’s against you), guys (they can mess you up bad), and the state of hip-hop (she has issues).\n\nAtlanta-based and more laid-back, India.Arie closed the night with about 45 minutes drawn from her debut, “Acoustic Soul.” The vibe set by the songwriter-guitarist and her quintet was a tad mellow for the end of a long evening, but her charisma shone through. Underscoring the message of self-acceptance in “Video,” she shed her flowing yellow top to reveal “Love Yourself” written across her one-shoulder tank top like a beauty queen’s sash. Taking off her head wrap as well, she let her long braids flow free and appeared more comfortable than many older and more seasoned artists.\n\nShe also brought the most overt sense of musical history, opening by name-checking soul heroes such as Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway. Interspersing quotations from classic tunes by the likes of Bill Withers and Bobby Caldwell, her songs blended old-school R&B; with hip-hop and folk, retaining her own fresh flavor while staying connected to her roots."
