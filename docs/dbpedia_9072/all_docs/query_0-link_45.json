        "text": "DJ Jazzy Joyce (born Joyce Spencer) is an American hip hop DJ and producer on New York City's radio station Hot 97. She is best known for her collaboration with rapper Sweet Tee on the 1986 single \"It's My Beat\".[1] In 1994, she was featured on \"9th Wonder (Blakitolism)\", the first single from \"Blowout Comb\", the second album from Grammy winning rap group Digable Planets. Not only were her DJ cuts prominent on the hook and the outro, but Joyce also exchanged several ad libbed lines at the end of the song's third verse with group member Ladybug Mecca and she was acknowledged by name throughout the track.\n\nShe was a contestant on the first season of DJ reality show, \"Master of the Mix\", which aired on two cable networks: BET and Centric.\n\nReferences\n\nOfficial Website\n\nDJ Jazzy Joyce on Myspace\n\nDJ Jazzy Joyce on Twitter\n\nDJ Jazzy Joyce at Discogs\n\nDJ Jazzy Joyce at the Internet Movie Database"
