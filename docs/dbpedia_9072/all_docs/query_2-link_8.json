Joyce developed her style with her strong techniques and engaging energy. In 1986 she teamed with Sweet Tee for the hit recording of “It’s My Beat” and later with Digable Planets for “The 9th Wonder.” She is one of the few women (if not the only) who battled in the legendary New Music Seminar DJ battles, going up against the likes of champions like DJ Cash Money!"
