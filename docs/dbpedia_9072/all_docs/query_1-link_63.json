        "text": "OAK BROOK, Ill., Oct. 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- McDonald's USA hooks up with leaders in hip-hop culture to announce the launch of its 2015 Flavor Battle competition. The eight-week national DJ competition challenges America's hottest up-and-coming mix masters to prove they are the best on the 1s and 2s. Twelve DJs, each representing a U.S. region—East Coast, West Coast and Central—will battle it out for DJ supremacy. Now in its seventh year, the competition has garnered recognition from hip-hop elites, such as DJ Clark Kent, who will serve as this year's host and radio host/entertainment personality, Angela Yee who will serve as Flavor Battle's social media correspondent. The celebrity judges this year will be DJ Skribble, DJ Shiftee, DJ Jazzy Joyce and the 2013 Flavor Battle champion, DJ R-Tistic.\n\n\"I've followed the Flavor Battle competition for a number of years now; I'm excited to partner with McDonald's on a competition that values creativity and the flavor of a generation,\" said DJ Clark Kent.\n\nMusic lovers can listen to a custom music mix from each DJ on www.flavorbattle.com and vote daily for their favorite mix-master from each region. The three DJs with the most votes will travel to New York City to compete in front of a panel of celebrity judges and live audience during the 2015 Global Spin Awards weekend. This year, McDonald's serves as a title sponsor for the Global Spin Awards, an international awards show that recognizes DJs across genres. Ultimately, one DJ will be crowned the Flavor Battle champion and take home a $10,000 cash prize. The second prize winner will be awarded $3,000 and the third place winner will receive $1,000.\n\n\"The mixes this year really push the envelope in terms of creativity and personal flavor,\" DJ Clark Kent said. \"Any and everyone should vote daily for the mix with the most promise. It's important we show support on rising artists of tomorrow.\"\n\nFans of great dj-ing are encouraged to vote often for their favorite mix-master. Each vote helps the DJ advance to the next round and qualifies consumers for a chance to win an all-expense paid trip to New York City for the Flavor Battle live finale event. Voters can share their top picks with their social networks via Twitter and Facebook directly from www.flavorbattle.com.\n\n\"McDonald's Flavor Battle brings relevant music and the brand's craveable flavor together through a fun representation of expression,\" said William Rhodes, McDonald's U.S. marketing director. \"Musical forms are constantly changing, it's important for McDonald's to stay up-to-date with the creativity that influences the lifestyle of our customers.\"\n\nIn conjunction with lifestyle network Complex Media, McDonald's Flavor Battle launched in 2009 as an extension of the company's 365Black initiative.
