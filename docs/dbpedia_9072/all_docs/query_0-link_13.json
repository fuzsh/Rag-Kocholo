        "text": "International DJ Superstar, Former “Hot 97” Host, and BET “Master of the Mix” Contestant Will Be Among Many Receiving Accolades\n\nHonoring National & International Female DJs, Promoters, and MCs\n\nNew York, NY (April, 2017) — As the excitement builds for Ayleet Productions First Annual Party Divas Award Show this September, honoring female DJs, Promoters, and MCs who have demonstrated creativity, innovation and drive in their work. it was recently announced that DJ Jazzy Joyce will be attending.\n\nBorn and bred in the Bronx, Joyce Spencer a.k.a. Jazzy Joyce was exposed at a young age to the urban rap world almost immediately. Since the age of 12, she recognized her calling and seized her opportunity to be able to study, hone, and master the art of DJing. At a time when female DJ’s were almost nonexistent, she got her first turntables and vinyl, developing a skill that has made her a legendary, internationally known DJ.\n\nWinning her 1st DJ award at the New Music Seminar in 1983, within a year she had recorded her 1st record as Quest vocalist on Globe and Whiz Kid’s hip hop classic, “Play That Beat”, an early Tommy Boy hit. Soon after, she signed on as DJ for Sweet Trio, a Whiz Kid produced act whose hit single “Non-Stop” prophetically predicted her ever expanding career. In 1986, she teamed up with Sweet T and dropped the hit single, “It’s My Beat” where she began to explore her production capabilities. Only four years after having won her first DJ battle, Jazzy stepped back up to battle at the 1987 New Music Seminar, and for the first time battled against a male DJ. With respect and credibility never having been a problem, and despite the male domination in her chosen profession- she has always refused to let gender be her handicap\n\nContinuing to push boundaries, Joyce powered into the 1990’s rocking Japan as a part of the Christian Marclay’s experimental “One Hundred Turntable Orchestra”, on the “Blowout Comb Tour” with Digable Planets, as the first scratcher and mix master on MTV’s second game show “Turn It Up”, and was featured on the HBO Special “Russell Simmons Presents: Bad Girls of Def Comedy Jam” in 1994. She was later awarded the 2003-2004 Mix Power Summit “East Coast DJ of the Year” Award, and due to her longevity and sustainability in the male predominant field- BET’s “Black Girls Rock” awarded and also named their DJ honor the “Jazzy Joyce DJ Award”. A featured contestant on the first season of BET’s “Master of the Mix” in 2010, she’s since continued to DJ clubs from New York to Tokyo, Amsterdam to Copenhagen, and just about every place in between despite her admittedly shy disposition.\n\nHaving toured with some of rap and R&B’s best, such as M.C Lyte, Africa Bambataa, Rich Nice, and Nenah Cherry, Joyce was also handpicked by Motown executives to DJ for the 30th Anniversary Motown Revue, hosted “Sister’s for Hip-Hop” and “Soul Tour” for MTV 2, and has guest DJ’d for Missy Elliot and Tweet at the Roseland Ballroom in NYC. Aside from the clubs, tours, and television, this busy boss lady also had a permanent home on Hot 97 along with CoCoa Chanelle, Angie Martinez, and LaLa on the Friday night “Ladies Night” show from 1996-2006. She then moved on to “Last Call” from 2006-2011, ending her last 5 years at the station hosting her own radio show.\n\nFrom guest appearances, rap seminars, award shows, & panels, Jazzy has appeared regularly on BET’s Rap City, and a host of magazines, including: VIBE, The Source, and she can even be found in “Who Shot Ya ?” the history of hip-hop written by Ernie Panniciloi, “A collection of 3 decades of hip-hop photos“. Jazzy’s spins have touched people all over the world, as she’s recently brought her radio experience to a whole new level broadcasting her own show online at DaMatrix Studios Broadcasting Network (DSBN) with viewers from over 35 countries.\n\nHaving created a path to follow for up-and-coming young women interested in breaking into the hip-hop world, Ayleet Productions is excited to have DJ Jazzy Joyce attending the First Annual “Party Divas Award Show” Saturday, September 16th!\n\nFor More Information on The Party Diva’s Award Show, VISIT:\n\nwww.PartyDivasAwardShow.com\n\nFacebook.com/PartyDivasShow\n\nInstagram.com/PartyDivasShow\n\nMore About The First Annual Party Divas Award Show:\n\nOn Saturday, September 16th, 2017 NY based production company Ayleet Productions will be hosting the First Annual Party Divas Award Show!
