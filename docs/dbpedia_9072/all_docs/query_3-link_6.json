        "text": "Getting to know the why of people’s backgrounds is my passion! When one meets someone as Iconic as Beverly Bond it only strengthens my passion further. Beverly a legend within multiple realms sat down with me, post her amazing set during Afro Punk 2016. If you believe like me, that everything happens for a reason, then the reason Beverly’s talents have excelled, show clearly within our conversation. Learning the in-depth history of how she connected the dots within her own life shed light to the (hows) regarding the fruits of labors. Take a look at our profound chat that will surely inspire you beyond your current hustle and catapult your own philanthropic endeavors, enjoy!\n\nMm: I love to get to know the why’s of people’s journey. I still feel like that kid who asks why— all the time. When you were modeling was that the initial dream for yourself to use that platform to lead into being a DJ as well as?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBB: Um, no! But also modeling was not the dream itself, modeling was a job for me.\n\nMm: Really?!\n\nBB: Yeah, it was really a job for me and it was a good job. It was a great job actually, it afforded me my turn-tables.\n\nMm: Did you seek out modeling opportunities? Or did it seek you out?\n\nBB: Both, I ended up having to do it because I needed to make money.\n\nMm: Don’t I know that! Ha-Ha!\n\nBB: Haha, but I was scouted a lot as well. It was always a thing that I knew naturally that I would be able to do. It wasn't something that I desired to do. But as a model it wasn’t a thing that fulfilled me. However as a person who loves music, I was a music collector. I was passionate about music, I hung out with DJ’s. I would collect records just for the fun of it. I would literally-- if I saw people on the streets, selling records even if I was on my bicycle, I’d stop and say let me see what they got! It was like a habit that I still have. So, I have this passion for music. Like last night when I saw George Clinton, I knew the words to the songs and I was so engrossed in the music and it was beautiful to have that experience. Its a passion of mine but I never really thought that I was going to become a DJ.\n\nMm: When did you allow yourself to dream bigger?\n\nBB: Well, it wasn’t a bigger dream. I thought it was a smaller dream.\n\nMm: Really, wow!\n\nBB: Yea, I didn’t know that there was such a thing as a Celebrity DJ.\n\nMm: But that’s what makes it big in my opinion, because no one else is doing it.\n\nBB: Well people were doing it, there were women DJ’s before me there was Jazzy Joyce, there was Spinderella, Belinda Becker even some of the DJ’s that you know now were actually spinning before me. Rasheeda was spinning before me but they weren’t necessarily these household names that Spinderella was. Jazzy Joyce was a pioneer so she opened the doors for a lot of us. Coco Chanel was on the radio killin it. So there were women DJ’s forsure but they were in radio or they were in music. So it wasn’t something that I decided to do. I never decided to be in radio and I certainly wasn’t someone in a band like Spinderella. I love music, I collected music, when I bought my turn-tables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMm: In 1999\n\nBB: Yes how did you know this! I was finishing in my acting program.\n\nMm: Oh, I didn’t know you were aspiring to be an actress.\n\nBB: Yea, I was trying to because my dream-bigger was to become an actress..... because that was kind of like the next step of what you do as a model. I got casted a lot for commercials, I would never get to pick the part, they would always cast me in the beauty department. I always wanted to stretch myself. So, I ended up doing this two and a half year acting program. In 99” when I got out of the program, I bought my turn tables because I was eventually going to move to California. I was going to go out to Cali, model out there and go on some casting stuff. My friend Wood Harris he’s the person who actually recommended the school to me. When I got out, I was like, I am moving to California. He was like Bev, this is not like New York— you have to have your crew. It's very isolating so you have to have your people, you have to have a network of people, you have to have a thing. For example himself Fatima Robinson the dancer and Saul Williams who were dating at the time would have poetry readings at their house right. I was like well, I got my records haha! I can come and be the DJ -- this was my big plan for DJ'ing. I'll be the DJ to your after party for the poetry readings.\n\nMm: Yes!\n\nBB: So that was really my only plan to DJ and before I left I was like I never want to be whack at anything I do so when I bought my turn tables, I just started practicing and I already had ideas cause I knew so many people that were doing this and whenever DJ's had conversations, I would be right in the middle of those conversations. If they were talking about samples, I would be right in the middle of those conversations. I already kind of had a feeling. So I was practicing, practicing, practicing and I was kind of nice. But... I never thought to take it anywhere real except for this after party at the poetry reading. I asked a couple of promoters and DJ's that I knew if I could open. This is January 2000! There were two people that were open to this, one guy was Eric and then DJ Kaori from Japan. She use to be at a place called spy bar which was my very first club. I use to go there just to practice to get ready for Cali--- for the after party of poetry. The first night I went in literally first night, the manager and other people were like who is this DJ.\n\nMm: Cause you kilt it!!?\n\nBB: I killed it and I killed it because I had prepared.\n\nMm: Opportunity meets preparation.\n\nBB: I did prepare. Not only was I prepared cause of my collection but once I decided that I was actually going to do this, I started going out specifically to listen to how DJ's play. Some nights, I would just go out and listen to the opening. Because.... I knew, I was only going to end up being an opener anyway. Most people were like get out of here with your modeling---DJ self. They were like no they were not trying to hear it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMm: Ha-ha!\n\nBB: If you were a model, they were not trying to take you serious as a DJ period. It was not happening. So, I knew that all I was going to get was the opening which is ok, because it's all I wanted. You know, I wasn't really planning on taking it any further but.... I wanted to hear what people were doing. I kept saying gosh they're leaning so much on the table cause when you open, first of all, no ones there people trickle in. You have such an ability to be playing so much music and really dig in the crates. So that became my signature.\n\nMm: And set the tone!\n\nBB: Yes and you can set the tone how you want to set it. And I felt like a lot of DJ’s were doing formulas as opposed to really giving you an experience in the early part of the night. So that's where I started. In the beginning I was like you know what, I can play this, I can mix this you know Ohio players and Jay Z.\n\nMm: Are you a visual learner?\n\nBB: Sometimes.\n\nMm: I ask because, I get like a visual learner creative mindset. It's almost like you can see it before you go and execute it?\n\nBB: Yea-Yea sometimes, I am actually. I was like this is my thing. I would hear what I wouldn't do when I would listen and think you know I wouldn't do that but instead, I would do this; so I learned a lot like that. I think by the third week of my gig of opening, by the way nobody paid me. They didn't even give me cab fare.\n\nMm: God, I LOVE it. You give me so much hope! Hahaha!\n\nBB: Haha, I had to carry my own turn-tables up and down the stairs.\n\nMm: HaHa, oh my current situation, it gets better thankfully.\n\nBB: HaHa-- Yes, I was dedicated. I was like I'm doing it right. I'm doing this!\n\nMm: When did it shift for you? When did it start to become.... I'm getting paid and things are taking off?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBB: Almost immediately, from day one. When I started playing even when I stared practicing I was like I'm nice. Then my friend who happened to be a manager at a record company where Mark Ronsen was—was like Bev you can get paid foreal. I was like really --- DJ's get paid? That's a job? She told me what Mark Ronsen was making at the time and I was like really ok! And at that point, I realized it was more than my day job as a model and I realized it was something that I could take seriously a little bit more than I wanted to. So when I went out practicing even though I was going to LA to do what this thing is. She put this in the back of my mind that this is actually a job Bev.\n\nMm: You said something that really keyed in for me, you said when you went to the opening at the club you decided to make a commitment to listen and just practice. There is something about making a commitment to yourself that almost opens the door to the commitment for the bigger--- that you don't even realize.\n\nBB: Well the commitment wasn't so much-- I like practicing. I loved it, you know what I mean. It wasn't about committing to the purpose of this job, it was just committing to my hobby, to my love, to my passion.\n\nMm: That's the secret crust of it in my opinion.\n\nBB: Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! But you know ok, what you are referring to is when, I decided I was going to a club; I wasn't going to be whack and that's when I committed to practicing. To make sure that, I'm not going to be whack. Even though I'm not really taking it that seriously, I can't be whack. Like come on, that's just not going to be who I am. My third week it was DJ Enuff's birthday party DJ Enuff and Angie Martinez. So that week, usually when the clubs have parties, they would have the celebrity stuff like that earlier. They had that during the times that I was spinning. No one changed the DJ or anything back then. This is in 2000 —January 2000. So they came in and all these people came to the floor like who the hell. Haha, I'm not use to a crowd I'm like, I'm the opening DJ people. So people kept coming up and you couldn't see where I was at -- at spy bar the DJ booth was up so you couldn't see the DJ from the floor. So people kept saying, “who is this DJ” and kept coming up to the DJ booth. Some dudes would come up and they would be like ya'll need to go see that DJ! So, I kept getting all of these visits from all of these people but the main thing was they respected the way I play. Jay Z was there that night and he came up to me and said, I love the way you play. Then Enuff said it to me, I love the way you play. Enuff at that point, in his mind-- he made his mind up, he's going to make me a heavy hitter. And like this is my third week in the club but you gotta think, I was practicing for months. I was selecting way before that. So part of DJ'ing is not just knowing the skill of DJ'ing the other part of it is knowing your music and I knew that. At that point I became kind of an it girl almost immediately and then I think my first big celebrity thing was DeAngelo. I did the VIP for his show. Mark Ronson did the main room. Dominique who actually just passed away he hired me because he wanted a DJ that could understand the musical influences of DeAngelo and mix that in with all of his stuff. They had Mark Ronson do the main room and I did the VIP room so it's kind of cool that my first big gig was with them.\n\nMm: With that rich history you take that and I love that you are still DJ'ing. Your still in that mix with your first love. But then you have taken that to share your passions with others including me, being a woman a black woman born in Southern Africa (Zimbabwe) and the impact you have had on us women. When did you realize that what you were doing in Black Girls Rock was an impact that you are starting to see now from the start of it in 2006.\n\n*Side note* I worked on Black Girls Rock in 2010 as a PA behind the scenes.\n\nBB: WoW!\n\nMm: Nia Long was the Host and it was taped in the Bronx. I knew, I was apart of something magical. Even though I was just getting food for people and hot teas for talent it still all felt powerful. When did you realize or what point did you first step back from your viewpoint and see the impact that you started to what it is today?\n\nBB: The first time that it really hit me was you know -- when we started Black Girls Rock starting in 2006 we started with an award show we had two honorees the first year. One was a DJ cause I always put the DJ award up, I thought it was important. So Jazzy Joyce, I wanted to pay homage for opening up that door for all of us woman. She was our first honoree and then MC Lyte was our other honoree. So MC Lyte and Jazzy Joyce were our very first honorees. But it was so powerful that year, there was a small power house books right here on Brooklyn in Dumbo that's where we did it that year. It's like an art gallery book store but it was beautiful. I always DJ and Premiere--DJ Premiere we DJ'ed. I didn't say a word on the mic, I was so scared. We honored the woman and MC Lyte performed. Everyone walked away with the same feeling that you got when you first went to the show in the Bronx. It's the same thing that everyone, even the security and the police officers everyone was like this is going to be something BIG. By 2007 more women came on board to help me and we got the show to Lincoln Center so by 2007, I had a full fledge award show. So we had this huge award show and by that time, TV was already talking to me. VH1 was interested and really trying to pick the show up. They were actually in front of BET. So, that took some time and BET started calling and were like VH1 hasn't picked this up yet? Can we talk? So we had been talking about it but I was still doing the show. So I have honored so many people like Mary J Blige and Queen Latifah and all these people. By 2007 Tracy and Gabrielle Union became my host. So BET started honors and took Gabby but we still were doing our show. Then it was Tracey as the host. So then Taraji Henson and Regina have always been there so it was already a big deal way before it got to TV. We finally got to a place where we were finalizing our deal with BET. BET had called me into the up-fronts to DJ. We were still in the process of negotiating and I hadn't signed anything so they called me into DJ the up-fronts. I didn't know the up-fronts is when they announced the shows so I'm in rehearsal and I'm DJ'ing and it comes up on the big screen mind you--- I had not stopped working on Black Girls Rock from an award show to starting a mentor program to all the other ancillary events around it. I hadn't stopped working --- nonstop. I put everything I had into it, put all my money into it, put all my time into it. Any press that people wanted to do on me as a DJ, I would turn that spotlight onto Black Girls Rock so I was just really relentless on making sure that this thing became what is was. By that time I had already made Ebony Power 100 list of most influential blacks in America. I made that list 3 times before I even got to TV. So that's how big of a movement --it's like Afro Punk like if Afro Punk would go to TV tomorrow it would be a new audience but everybody here has been with the movement. So Black Girls Rock was like that. There was a strong movement that was happening but of course taking it to Television becomes a much bigger thing and we got more eyes on it. So as I'm in rehearsal and this thing comes up on the screen and they are talking about the show it literally hit me like a ton of bricks..... like “Oh my God like this is what I built”. Like I built this whole thing and I couldn't believe it and I just thought about what this is going to mean to so many more women who were going to view this and I just started crying and then Deborah Lee she was sitting right near me and she saw me crying and she was like are you ok? Did we do something wrong, and I said \"no I just actually never looked up\". Like I never took a moment. I never looked up my head was down and I was just like I'm making this black girls rock work. So that's pretty much when it first hit me that this is going to be powerful, but I had worked on this for so long by the time the television audience and the world wide audience got it--- we had already been in it.\n\nMm: Who were the Black Girl Rock influences in your own life early on?\n\nBB: My mother definitely! I think in terms of women in television or women that are public figures, I would say like Angela Davis the woman from Star Trek, I'm a treky haha Nichelle Nichols the Lieutenant. Pam Grier and Grace Jones. Like really strong, edgy, Powerful impactful woman. I think that as the years have gone by you actually see less of these things it's almost like we were suppose to be going for more not less. Like somewhere along the way it decreased.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMm: You still think right now it's decreasing?\n\nBB: I think now it's increasing we have things like Shonda Land. If you think about Kerry's role in Scandal it's the first time someone has been in this type of leading role since Teresa Graves in Get Christie Love almost 30 years ago and right before that it was Diane Carroll. Yeah, so that's a long period of time to not have a black leading lady.\n\nMm: Yeah, even with all that went down with the Olympics and I love that you tweeted out about Simone shouting out Black Girls Rock.\n\nBB: Yes, Yes!\n\nMm: It was a big deal but the fact that it had to be a big deal, that so many black women were......\n\nMm: Right, Right! So how as women on the ground currently who aren't DJ's in an entertainment world. How can we continue to rise to the challenge and support each other further. Because we are all Black Girls that Rock. How can we further grow this movement?\n\nBB: I think we are doing it. I think black women are stepping up and using their voices. I think social media has a lot to do with it. I think we are asserting ourselves and using our voices. We are challenging the system. We are challenging the social constructs of womanhood and blackness. I think we are doing a very good job of it. I think we have to remember to not stop. You know Tatyana Ali has been in TV her whole life and she said that the reason she finds Black Girls to be so important is because she's seen the change that it's having because of it in Hollywood but because she has been around that work for so long, she has seen that we can go away if we are not constantly out there making our presence matter. We can't just think about our own time, we have to think about the time for the next generation. We have to think about that. So, I think that, that is important for us to continue to do work. To know that our voices matter and embrace each other and I think that's another beautiful thing that I see so much with black women. I think we are so sisterly and I've always thought that.\n\nMm: You have such a self-less spirit. You really do! You know meeting someone in person you get their vibe and I keep feeling selfless, selfless you're such a selfless person. Even that moment when you are in the DJ booth and you saw Black Girls Rock in the upfront roster and you said I just finally looked up. That to me, is so powerful. You saying— I just looked up because, I get that. I totally get that you get lost in your grind and being relentless towards your goals. It's hard for me to ingest compliments or take certain things in because I'm so tunnel vision yet, I want that for so many people for them to be inspired and keep going by the interviews that I do.\n\nBB: I think you know that's why I mentor, I mentor for that reason. I never stop mentoring. I think it's important because a lot of young girls keep getting mixed messages especially with media messages and this world moves so fast. And unfortunately anything that is harmful to children is even more harmful to black children. Black children have less tools and because they have less tools we have to work harder. Honest and clearly black lives matter did not happen by mistake. It happened because it was necessary. This is a necessary movement and we are still getting killed not just by police but even in our neighborhoods. So we are up against so much and because of that we have to be fearless. I think that every adult should be a mix of that in some form or fashion for some young person. You don't have to start a movement you can help with other people's. Volunteering with some organization. I think that we all have to commit to our kids. Even if they are not ours.\n\nMm: Fantasia said something very similar to me on the red carpet in July during Hip Hop Honors and that really stuck with me. When your name comes up and the words legend and living Icon come up next to it and you think about your own personal foot print, what are some words you yourself would associate with your own foot print?\n\nBB: I am grateful. That's the first thing that comes to mind. I am grateful to be given such blessings to be able to be blessed especially as an extreme introvert. Blessed enough to have enough stuff to use that inspires others. I think that's powerful. So I'm grateful, I'm grateful for that!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMm: I love it and I am so grateful for this moment. I just want to say thank you!\n\nBB: Aw, thank you sis!\n\nJoin the Black Girls Rock Movement of you haven't already!"
