        "text": "Dee Dee Roper, internationally known as DJ Spinderella, is a Grammy award winning DJ, producer, rapper, writer and world class mother. Spinderella is one of the original pioneers of hip hop music beginning her career as a member of the iconic rap group Salt-N-Pepa, selling over 15 million albums and singles worldwide. Over two decades after her groundbreaking entrance into hip hop, the Brooklyn native still sets the standard for “turntablisit” all over the world and is still a force to be reckoned with in the music industry. It has never been simply about cuts, beats, and rhymes says the Grammy,MTV, and BET Award Winner. “I’ve been blessed to be in the game for so many years, when many others have come and gone,” says Spinderella. “This industry is all about fun and entertainment, but humility and professionalism will take you far. I’ve also had great mentors such as DJ Jazzy Jeff, DJ Scratch, and the late Jam Master Jay.”\n\nSpinderella has rocked crowds around the world for 25 years and continues to bring hip hop to the masses. She is an active community partner of the American Diabetes Association of North Texas through her passion for vinyl and the preserving history of music she joined the Recording Academy Texas Chapter – Advisory Board. She is the official DJ for the Shaquille O’Neal All Star Comedy Jam and in January 2013, crowned the TV ONE “Unsung Ambassador” (Season & blog – begins January 23rd) .\n\nSpinderella still performs with her sisters Salt-N- Pepa, and recently rocked an electric performance during Rock the Bells in 2012 and was also featured on Oprah in April of 2011, which showcased “Women Who Rock”. With the flick of her wrist, Spin has juggled single motherhood while conquering grand scale events and holding down her international reputation as the “Universe’s #1 female DJ”.\n\nIn addition to pursuing acting and voice over work, she recently formed a community partnership with Big Thought.org to teach young artist the art of turntablism through the, Spinderella DJ Academy reaching over 250 children in one week. While music and family are undoubtedly Spin’s passions; she has also coordinated and hosted the “Music, Movies, and More” symposium at Cal State Dominguez Hills. Attendees at the official Espy Awards, Academy Awards, Kentucky Derby, and NBA All Star after parties have annually enjoyed her sets. She has also performed at high profile events for Magic Johnson Enterprises, McDonald’s, Children Uniting Nations, Glamour Magazine, Cisco Systems, Skyy Vodka, Red Bull, Nike, Queen Latifah, the J. Paul Getty Museum, House of Courvoisier, LA Weekly, Planned Parenthood, Carl Lewis, Paramount Pictures, and many more. “There isn’t anything I can’t do when I put my mind to it and feel it in my heart.” You would think that just being Spinderella is enough for one woman to handle, but this woman wants it all. “I’m blessed,” she explains.\n\n“A day doesn’t go by that I don’t appreciate all I have or where I’ve come from.”"
