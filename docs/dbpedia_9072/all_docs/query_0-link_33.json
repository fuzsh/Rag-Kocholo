We sat down for an exclusive interview with veteran Hip-Hop DJ’s, DJ Green Lantern and DJ Jazzy Joyce. The two DJ’s discussed some of their thoughts about HIV and AIDS prevention. DJ Green Lantern and DJ Jazzy Joyce also spoke about their views on the culture of Hip-Hop today and where it’s heading. Check out our exclusive interview with DJ Green Lantern and DJ Jazzy Joyce above and don’t forget to wrap it up!\n\nON AIDS and HIV Prevention:\n\n“Take precaution. Protect yourself and respect yourself. Respect other people.” – DJ Green Lantern\n\n“I say wrap it up. It’s serious out here. Young people wake up ’cause it’s real. The responsibility honey is, put that condom on. Lifebeat, protect yourself. If you wanna do it to the beat, do it to the beat. But, protect yourself.” – DJ Jazzy Joyce\n\nOn the current state of Hip-Hop:\n\n“Music is the best thing to bring people together. I’m more attached to Hip-Hop that was from an era when it wasn’t really controlled by corporations.” – DJ Green Lantern\n\n“It’s not just the music. I live it. I breathe it. The culture of it ’cause I’ve been it it for so long. But, at the same time it’s growing and it’s turning and it’s twisting.” – DJ Jazzy Joyce\n\nLifebeat, Music Fights HIV/AIDS was founded in 1992. It is the leading national nonprofit dedicated to educating America’s youth (13-29) about HIV/AIDS prevention.
