This week’s residency with Rennie Harris Puremovement American Street Dance Theater marks the third time that FirstWorks audiences and Providence students have engaged with this legendary choreographer. Tonight’s extraordinary “Rome & Jewels” performance is a masterwork of hip-hop theatre. Rennie picks up Shakespeare’s “Romeo & Juliet” and places it in the streets of Philadelphia. Tonight’s performance is an epic undertaking – at its origin over 30 years ago and for where we are today.\n\nFirstWorks is counting down to our 20th anniversary as a proud contributor to the cultural landscape of Providence and Rhode Island. Tonight’s performance is the culmination of years of dreaming and planning. It exemplifies the transformative power of creative expression to uplift, challenge, provoke and inspire us.\n\nLive performance is at the heart of FirstWorks. It is surrounded by a constellation of activities and events that extend the impact of the arts far beyond the stage. FirstWorks’ arts education program connects brilliant artists to students through workshops in schools. Last night, Dance Floor Dialogues brought stellar local artists into community with members of the Rennie Harris company and generated conversations and dialogues which explore the ideas behind the art.\n\nThank you for being a part of this cultural experience – please join us for global journeys in 2024 as we celebrate FirstWorks at 20!\n\nKathleen Pletcher\n\nExecutive Artistic Director and Founder\n\nFirstWorks\n\nMORE WAYS TO ENGAGE\n\nWe invite you to stay on immediately after tonight’s performance for a FirstWorks Artist Up-Close conversation with RHPM’s Ozzie Jones and Rodney Mason, moderated by Jessica T Pearson.\n\nRead an essay on “ROME & JEWELS” By Jessica T.

Little did I know, I’d grow up to become a choreographer. Some years later, around the mid to late 1990s, a thought popped into my mind: “Do a Hip-hop version of West Side Story.” Immediately, I began to create the work in my head and dreamt of it for weeks. By 1996-97, I started to set phrases on the company. Unbeknownst to the company I secretly cast Duane Holland as Rome. I continued to work out ideas every day with no financial support or performance in sight. Eventually Mark Murphy, the former presenter of On The Boards, caught wind of what I was doing and asked if I would present the workshop version of it at On The Boards Theater in Seattle, Washington. I agreed and presented a 45-minute workshop of the Rome & Jewels. At this point, there were no monologues it was purely dance. By 1998, I wrote the first draft of the script. It was a fusion of the original script of Romeo and Juliet mixed with colloquial language. One day before the start of rehearsal, Rodney Mason walked through the door and yelled aloud, “Yo Rome, thou art a villain, so what’s up”?! And there you have it! Down goes Sonny Liston. It became clear to me we didn’t really have to stay so exact. That night I began re-writing the script and gave everyone updated scripts, but there was a problem. The dancers couldn’t act. Well, not the way that would be believable. I then reached outside of the company for actors that could street dance and remembered a young man I worked with in the past by the name of d. Sabela Grimes. Next, I brought in a dramaturg who I knew as an accomplished director and rapper in Philadelphia, Mr. Ozzie Jones. At some point during the creation process I hired Ozzie to play my version of the Tony character in West Side Story “Old Man.” The last change to the script came as a default decision but not in a negative way. d. Sabela Grimes and Rodney Mason were established poets and readers of Shakespeare and, as if ordained by Shakespeare himself, each of them began to fuse their poetry with dialogues and eventually wrote their own monologues. Ozzie Jones also wrote his own monologue and the rest is history. The title Rome & Jewels is an encoded jab at the Hip-hop community. Rome = Roam, Jewels = jewelry. It means roaming for jewelry. In my opinion, the Hip-hop community is always roaming, or rather searching, for the golden grail/money/riches, as if it were their only means of rising out of their current situation. Ozzie Jones’s opening monologue explains it brilliantly. “Big and Pac roamed for jewels, but don’t we all? You ain’t nobody until you’re somebody on some motherfucka’s wall. One big, black, fat, and ugly, the other scarred up like tags on a train. Spitting freestyles for thirty Gs with pounds of weed on the brain. Now, here, heartbreak gets popped too while bullets crash through. Cause in the jungle sometimes what love got to do? When all your eyes are set on nothing you get tempted like David Ruffin. Cause in the death angel’s arms, our screams sound like mumbling. Through Rome, we see Jewels, and Rome stands for quest to get love, props, or dough before he dies from the stress.”\n\nWHO’S WHO?\n\n“Harris is the most respected and, to my knowledge, the most brilliant Hip-hop choreographer in America” ~ Joan Acocella, The New Yorker\n\nLORENZO RENNIE HARRIS (Founder, Artistic Director, Choreographer and Director). Dr. Lorenzo (Rennie) Harris was born and raised in an African American community in North Philadelphia. Since the age of 15, Harris has been teaching workshops and classes at universities around the country and is a powerful spokesperson for the significance of “street” origins in any dance style. In 1992, Harris founded Rennie Harris Puremovement, a street dance theatre company dedicated to preserving and disseminating street dance culture through workshops, classes, lecture, lecture demonstrations, residencies, mentoring programs, and public performances. Coining the term Street Dance Theater and Hip-hop Concert dance, Harris founded his company based on the belief that hip hop culture is the most important original expression of a new generation. With its roots in the inner-city African American and Latino communities, hip hop can be characterized as a contemporary indigenous form, one that expresses universal themes that extend beyond racial, religious, and economic boundaries, and one that (because of its pan-racial and transnational popularity) can help bridge these divisions. Harris’s work encompasses the diverse and rich African American traditions of the past, while simultaneously presenting the voice of a new generation through its ever-evolving interpretations of dance. Harris is committed to providing audiences with a sincere view of the essence and spirit of hip hop rather than the commercially exploited stereotypes portrayed by the media.\n\nCurrently, Harris tours a collection of evening-length works as well as classic repertory works of the last 30 years. Rome & Jewels, the first evening-length work written, choreographed, and directed by Rennie Harris, uses Shakespeare’s text, to tell its own story based on West Side Story and Romeo and Juliet. To date, Rome & Jewels is the longest touring street dance theater work in American history with three Bessie Awards and four Black Theater Alvin Ailey Awards. It was also nominated for a Lawrence Olivier Award (UK) and received The Harman Shakespeare Theater Award for adaptation of West Side Story and Romeo and Juliet. Rome & Jewels has performed for sold-out audiences nationally and internationally. The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote of the work, “Harris has built a wedge that will open the doors of America’s art centers, displaying hip hop as clear cultural expression, compelling to all races and generations… Rome & Jewels is clearly the work of an artist of uncommon vision…we get to witness, right here in our city, the evolution of an important new dance form.”\n\nIn addition, Harris’s body of work includes evening length works such as Falling Crumbs From the Cake, Something To Do With Love, Legends of Hip hop, Facing Mekka, 100NAKEDLOCKS, HEAVEN, LUV American-Style, Rennie Harris Funkedified, LIFTED, and two new works still in creation and development phase-American Street Dancer and Losing My Religion. In Facing Mekka, Harris continues his quest to present street dance on the concert stage. To this end, he has developed a solo that challenges his own choreographic experiences and audience’s expectations of hip hop and street dance. Harris approaches the vocabulary of this work, entitled Lorenzo’s Oil, as a butoh-style hip hop dance. The solo is meant to integrate calming, serene space (represented by the butoh style) with Popping. Lorenzo’s Oil turns street dance on its head in order to draw attention away from the spectacle and acrobatic and high-powered movements that many audiences, particularly those outside of hip hop movement, expect, and see what it could/should be. Dr. Harris found a way to marry his story with social dances and bring them to the concert stage, creating a cohesive dance style that finds a cogent voice in the theater. Much of Dr. Harris’s work has explored his personal experiences as an African American male growing up in North Philadelphia.\n\nAt the turn of the century alongside Princess Grace Kelly, Dr. and Julius Erving, Rennie Harris was voted one of the most influential people in the last one hundred years of Philadelphia history. He’s been compared to twentieth-century legends, Basquiat, Alvin Ailey and Bob Fosse. In 2010 he received an honorary doctorate in the Arts and Humanities from Bates College (Maine) and a 2nd Honorary Doctorate in the Fine Arts from Columbia College (Chicago). He received the Kulu Mele’ African Rooted Dance award and the Guggenheim (2010). He has also been featured in Rose Eichenbaum’s Masters of Movement-Portraits of America’s Great Choreographers with dance legends such as Carmen de Lavallade, Judith Jamison, Fayard Nicolas and Gregory Hines. In addition, he was awarded a medal from the Kennedy Center (DC) as a master of African American Choreography. Touring Egypt, Jordan, Palestine and surrounding countries, Rennie Harris served as one of four Ambassadors for the United States as part of President Obama’s cultural exchange program, Dance Motion USA, which was led by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Recently, Rennie Harris became a recipient of The Doris Duke Artist Award (2020). He and his group of dancers and their infectious brand of movement have toured around the globe pioneering Hip-hop Dance Theater as a cogent and viable voice. Dr. Lorenzo “Rennie” Harris is atop the hip-hop heap, its leading ambassador.\n\nACTORS/DANCERS\n\nRodney Mason aka Duck Butt (Rome) Original Cast Transplanted to Portland from South Philly, Rodney is a Song and Dance man who won the starring role of “Tony Sinclair” for the Tanqueray worldwide campaign beating out the Wayans brothers and 800 candidates in the US and UK for this sophisticated Black Brit.

The term itself means someone is doing the most or being extra, over the top with whatever they’re doing, wearing, or saying at the time to impress whoever. Simply put, I own it, I’m a showoﬀ because when you think about it, every professional artist that you know gets paid to travel the world and show oﬀ their skill or knowledge. When you come to see artists perform, it’s called a “show.” When we are on our game, we often refer to it as going oﬀ on stage or wherever. I have to be honest and say, I like it when my family and friends are in the audience. It inspires me more because I’m literally showing oﬀ for them” ~Evil Tracy The International Showoﬀ~\n\nDJ Razor Ramon is a DJ/ Turntablist/ Producer from Philadelphia.
