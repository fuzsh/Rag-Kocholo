Lyte has gone on to provide music for The Image Awards, Nissan, Google, Black Enterprise, and many others.\n\nSpeaker\n\n[edit]\n\nMC Lyte has spoken at colleges and universities, for organizations around the globe, and with notable people like Iyanla Vanzant, Russell Simmons, and Soledad O'Brien bringing a message of empowerment from her book Unstoppable: Igniting the Power Within to Achieve Your Greatest Potential. She also partnered with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund on the iLEAD international tour[99] in South Africa to empower the continent's youth and up-and-coming leaders.\n\nLeadership and philanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1991, MC Lyte was featured in TV informercial promoting pro-choice abortion rights political action \"The Most Exciting Women in Music\" alongside Corina, Juliet Cuming, Kim Gordon (Sonic Youth), Lady Miss Kier (Deee-Lite), Kate Pierson (The B-52's), Crystal Waters, Tina Weymouth (Talking Heads, Tom Tom Club).[100][101][102]\n\nIn February 2006, her diary, as well as a turntable, records, and other assorted ephemera from the early days of hip hop, were donated to the Smithsonian Institution.[103] This collection, entitled \"Hip-Hop Won't Stop: The Beat, the Rhymes, the Life\" is a program to assemble objects of historical relevance to the hip hop genre from its inception.[104] MC Lyte served as the President of the Los Angeles Chapter of the Recording Academy (the Grammy organization) from 2011 to 2013.[105] She was the first African American woman to serve in this role.[105]\n\nShe is the founder of Hip Hop Sisters Foundation,[17] which presented two $100,000 scholarships to college students each of the first two years of its inception and three $50,000 scholarships as a part of its #EducateOurMen initiative during its third year during the Soul Train Music Awards Red Carpet Preshow.[106]\n\nArtistry\n\n[edit]\n\nInfluences, style and rapping technique\n\n[edit]\n\nMC Lyte has considered artists such as Salt-N-Pepa,[107] Rakim,[108] Roxanne Shanté,[109] Doug E. Fresh,[110] Kool Moe Dee,[108] Sha-Rock from Funky 4 + 1,[111][112] and Run-DMC[108] as her inspirations early in her musical career. In an interview with XXL in 2013, Lyte talks about the influence in her early days of Melle Mel and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (specifically the song \"The Message\"). She also claimed to know \"all the words\" on Kurtis Blow's records.[108] Throughout her career, has also paid tribute to other artists such as Spoonie Gee (who she covered on Act Like You Know), Slick Rick,[113] The Rock Steady Crew,[114] LL Cool J[115] and Queen Latifah.[116] In an interview with The Source in 2015, when asked about her motivation to record her latest album, Legend, Lyte said she was inspired by Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West and Drake, among other rappers.[117]\n\nHer style of rap has been described in the book Listen to Rap! Exploring a Musical Genre as \"mid-tempo but aggressive (lots of plosives) and carefully articulated, with emphasis on end rhymes.\"[118] Her alto voice tone[119] is one of the generally most highlighted features in her music, being described as \"husky\",[120][121] \"raspy\",[122] \"raw\",[123] \"throat-grabbing\"[13] and \"authoritative\".[124] Her voice is also considered by Public Enemy's Chuck D as \"one of the greatest voices of all time.\"[125] According to the Hip hop Archive and Research Institute, \"MC Lyte combined a deep, rich, strong voice with emotional vulnerability, insightful artistic and social analysis, and a playful sense of humor.\"[126] Much of the lyrical content of MC Lyte's repertoire is based on braggadocio rap, although she recorded a considerable number of songs that address social issues, such as addictions (\"I Cram to Understand U (Sam)\",[127] \"Poor Georgie\",[128][124] \"Eyes Are the Soul\",[129][130] \"Lola from the Copa\"),[12][131] misogyny/gender issues (\"Paper Thin\",[132][127] I'm Not Havin' It, \"Please Understand\",[2] \"Eyes Are the Soul\",[129] \"Mickey Slipper\",[131] \"I Go On\",[133] \"Freedom\"),[53] HIV/AIDS (\"Eyes Are the Soul\",[129] \"Lola from the Copa\")[131] and crime (\"Self Destruction\",[33] Cappucino\",[134] \"Not wit' a Dealer\",[135] \"Eyes Are the Soul\",[129] \"Druglord Superstar\",[136] \"King of Rock\").[131][12] Other themes present in her songs are spirituality (\"Search 4 the Lyte\", \"God Said Lyte\", \"Better Place\")[12] and sexuality (\"Like a Virgin\", \"Ice Cream Dream\", \"Ruffneck\", \"Keep On Keepin' On\").[137]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nMC Lyte was considered by both the specialized press and fans as one of the best and most important Hip hop artists,[13][138][139][140] mainly among female artists.[141][142][143][144][145]\n\nGreg Prato of AllMusic, referred to her as one of the first female rappers to \"point out the sexism and misogyny that often runs rampant in hip-hop\", often taking the subject \"head on lyrically\" in her songs.[146] The Birmingham Times has credited her for helping transition hip-hop from the \"feel-good, party vibe\" of the late 1970s into a \"socially conscious form of expression,\" as the rapper addressed issues like racism, sexism, and the drug culture had been affecting the African-American community.[147] Billboard, The Washington Post, and NPR have cited her as a \"hip-hop pioneer\".[148][149][150]\n\nMC Lyte has influenced the work of later female rappers such as Queen Latifah,[151] Lil' Kim,[152] Da Brat,[153] Missy Elliott, Lauryn Hill,[154] Monie Love,[155] Eve,[156] Rapsody,[157] and Flo Milli,[158] as well as rock artist Jack White.[159] Also About.com ranked her No. 26 on their list of the 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987–2007)[139] and No. 6 in the Greatest Rappers Ever survey organized by NME.[138] Furthermore, Vibe magazine has referred to MC Lyte as the \"Queen of Rap\".[160]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2016, producer and rapper Q-Tip revealed on his Apple Music 1 show Abstract Radio that he used to date Lyte in his days before landing a record deal with A Tribe Called Quest. In the early 1990s, Lyte was in a relationship with Todd \"Todd 1\" Brown (1970–2019), then the producer of Yo! MTV Raps[161] and at that time she would also make public in an interview that they were engaged. Brown later said that the latter was part of a joke started by one of the hosts of the show Tyrone \"T Money\" Kelsie \"he came up with the marriage idea and then mayhem ensued. After the initial show, the story got so big that an interviewer actually asked Lyte about her \"marriage\"... and instead of her shooting down the rumor, she went along with it.\"[citation needed] Later it was speculated in the media that for a few years she had a relationship with actress Tichina Arnold. Later these rumors were denied by Arnold.[162] In May 2015 some media speculated that Lyte had dated R&B singer Janelle Monae, but these rumors have not been confirmed by either of them.[163][164]\n\nIn early 2016, she started dating Marine Corps veteran and entrepreneur John Wyche, after meeting him on Match.com. They announced their engagement in May 2017. \"What can I say, except thank you Lord!!!... It's been a long time, this single life, and I thank you all for your prayers and kind words of hope,\" she wrote in an Instagram post dated January 21, 2017. \"God has sent me true love. For all of you waiting on LOVE- don't give up – keep God first and he will see that you meet your match.\" In August they exchanged their vows during a musical wedding in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Reggae Congo bands played as Lyte walked down the aisle, and the couple's friend Kelly Price serenaded them during the ceremony. Afterward, an intimate gathering with only close friends and family members was held.[165][166] In August 2020 she filed for a divorce after three years of marriage.[167]\n\nShe is an honorary member of Sigma Gamma Rho sorority.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: MC Lyte discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nLyte as a Rock (1988)\n\nEyes on This (1989)\n\nAct Like You Know (1991)\n\nAin't No Other (1993)\n\nBad as I Wanna B (1996)\n\nSeven & Seven (1998)\n\nDa Undaground Heat, Vol. 1 (2003)\n\nLegend (2015)\n\nCollaboration albums\n\nAlmost September with Almost September (2008)\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1992 Fly by Night Akusa 1997 An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn Sista Tu Lumumba 1999 A Luv Tale Alia 2000 Train Ride Katrina Daniels 2002 Civil Brand Sgt.
