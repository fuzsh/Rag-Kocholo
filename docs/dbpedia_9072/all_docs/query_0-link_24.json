        "meta_description": "H.I.P. H.O.P. was France's first television show and first regular nationwide weekly show in the world to be dedicated to the hip hop culture. It was broadcast each Sunday afternoon on the French national channel TF1 in 1984, from January 14, for 43 weeks, which had a certain impact on the beginnings of the French hip hop scene. The host was Sidney, who was already presenting a hip-hop radio program since 1981, along with the Paris City Breakers. They had guests such as Herbie Hancock on February 19, Sugarhill Gang, Kurtis Blow, Afrika Bambaataa, The Rock Steady Crew, Art of Noise and Madonna, plus graffiti artists such as Futura 2000. \nMichael Holman, host of Graffiti Rock,  claims to be the very first person to broadcast a nationwide hip-hop  television show, but the show was launched in June 1984 by 88 syndicated  stations across the US starring Kool Moe Dee, Special K, Run-DMC and The New York City Breakers. Just two years prior, in 1982, Holman aired on New York cable TV two  much earlier programmes that were dedicated to hip-hop culture called On Beat and TV New York. These local TV shows already had featured hip-hop artists such as Fab 5 Freddy, DJ High Priest, The New York City Breakers, graffiti artist Phase 2, Futura, DJ Jazzy Joyce, K-Rob and Tim Single. \nSource: Wikipédia",

He is well known in France for his connection with the beginnings of the French hip hop scene. He presented a hip hop radio program on Radio 7 starting in 1982. In 1984, he was the host of the popular weekly French Rap television show entitled H.I.P. H.O.P. This was significant for two reasons: first because Duteil became the first Black man in France to hold such a position, and secondly because the birth and eventual popularity of the weekly show demonstrated the growing admiration and involvement in the French population in hip hop culture.\n\nIn 1990, Sidney collaborated with David Guetta in his early career to release \"Nation Rap.\"\n\nSource : Wikipédia"
