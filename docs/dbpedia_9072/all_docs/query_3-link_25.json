        "text": "Last week, I posted a blog celebrating the 25th anniversary of Rock Singer/Songwriter/Producer/Author Tina Turner’s classic album “Wildest Dreams” The articled featured me writing a review of the album along with the impact it made on music and her fans. I also interviewed many of Tina’s fans about what they loved about the album and this article features the interview of them speaking about the album and the songs indepth.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: This was a good move. She took the song and made it her own. She made it more intense and as she said in one interview, she loved to belt out the pain on that one. She made it build to a great crescendo (check spelling) with so much emotion packed in it that if you could relate to the situation the lyrics were referring to many would cry. No one packs as much emotion and soul into a ballad quite like Tina.\n\nMARTIN JONES: Oh my God when I when I first heard missing you on the wildest dream album I thought it was awesome her vocals was outstanding I mean look how many cover versions she done in her life and made it her own for instance al Green’s 1971 classic hit let’s stay together she made it her own in 1983 even a video of it which I love the video I mean Oh my God so if she can do let’s stay together good why not do the redemption of John waits missing you wish you know John waits classic missing you wasn’t what 1984 around the time that she scored her number one hit around that year 1984 was the comeback year I mean why not .\n\nELYSABETH HUNTER: The remake of Missing You? I can honestly say, I never heard the original track you referred too. I know I love Tina’s cover. Whenever I hear it, I see the video and the commercial that was shoot with it for Hanes.\n\nWALLACE: That is a favorite. Especially live. The way Tina gets into that song is amazing on the stage. She states in interviews she doesn’t like autobiographical songs, but when she sings that and IDWAF. Something comes over Tina on stage. You can tell Missing you is a song that hits a spot every time she sings it.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: “Missing You” by John Waite is one of my favorite songs from the 1980s. I enjoyed her cover and she made it her own with a 1990s feel and sound.\n\nBARBARA BULLOCK: I think that many songs on that album reflect a time of her life she would rather forget, and anyone who knows her story or can even relate will know why. I really like songs that Tina covers because she always makes them her own. As Gayle King says she Tinas them up (not sure of the spelling of this). They often sound so authentic Tina that at first, I don’t even know that they are covers.\n\nJAY’ER: I love both versions, but I will say that it is something about when Tina covers a song, she knows how to put “some stank on it” to make it a Tina song.\n\nELYSABETH HUNTER: Wildest Dream track? OMG, my favorite for sure.\n\nTINA HAD ALSO RECORDED A VERSION WITH ACTOR/DANCER ANTONIO BANDERUS. SOME FANS DO LIKE THE VERSION SHE RECORDED WITH ANTONIO.\n\nMARTIN JONES: Antonio Banderas or the incomparable maestro Barry White aw man that whole song is just everything I mean I could play that from top to\n\nbottom to left to right till North the South to East West.\n\nHOWEVER, MANY FANS PREFER THE VERSION TINA RECORDED WITH BARRY.\n\nWALLACE: I prefer Barry White. It just matched Barry’s Vibe.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: I like the Tina Turner and Barry White version better. I listened to the Tina and Antonio Banderas version, but it did not do anything for me mentally nor musically.\n\nJAY’ER: The first version that I have heard of ‘Wildest Dreams’ was the version with Barry White. It was not until later when I heard the version with Antonio Banderas. I like them both, however, I am more prone to enjoying the version with Barry.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: I liked the Barry White Version and loved Tessa’s background vocals. Why? Barry brought the real soul and added so much to the song.\n\nTHE SINGLE ALSO FEATURES BEAUTIFUL BACKGROUND VOCALS BY SINGER AND AUTHOR TESSA NILES, WHO SANG BACKGROUND ON MANY OF TINA’S CLASSICS INCLUDING WHAT’S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, TYPICAL MALE, TWO PEOPLE, THE BEST AND ASK ME HOW I FEEL. MANY FANS LOVE HER VOCALS ON THIS CLASSIC.\n\nMARTIN JONES: I think tesla’s vocals match with the duets of the songs on each version.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: I was not familiar with Tessa Niles prior to this questionnaire, so I never paid any attention to Tessa’s background vocals until now. I like her contribution.\n\nSADLY TINA AND BARRY NEVER GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERFORM THEIR CLASSIC DUET LIVE. HOWEVER THERE WERE 2 VIDEOS FOR THE SONG THAT FEATURED THE DUET. THE CONCERT PERFORMANCE AND A VIDEO WITH BOTH PERFORMERS IN CLAYMATION. MANY HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE HAD TINA AND BARRY HAD PERFORMED THIS CLASSIC LIVE AND HOW IT WOULD HAVE NOT ONLY HELPED ENLARGED AND COMBINE THEIR FAN BASES BUT IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED RECORD SALES IN THE UNITED STATES:\n\nELYSABETH HUNTER: I was disappointed that Tina and Barry never made an actual video for the track. I did not like the animation video, for I am not a fan of animation period. I do believe if they were able to do more for the track promotion wise, it would have gone further in America. Disappointed is not the word.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: I do think the sales would have been much greater had they performed live. This is a no brainer and I have always been baffled why this did not happen.\n\nWALLACE: That would of been great to see. Now, I’m wondering why that never happened. I feel like the US is really funny with Tina. We support her live at all times, but in the record sales we can be a little funny. From my understanding, 24/7 did so much better in the US.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: Oh yes! The crowd would have loved to have seen Tina and Barry perform the song live for sure. I could imagine the concert goers going wild had Tina and Barry performed together. The album would have gotten more sales in the U.S. especially with Tina and Barry’s collaboration as two top African-American icons from the R&B and soul memories of the 1960s and 1970s. They were comeback queens and kings. Unfortunately, the U.S. realized Tina was unable to be pigeonholed with her international icon status and therefore let Europe and the rest of the world claim her.\n\nJAY’ER: I think that because Barry White was known as a formidable force in the R&B genre, that if he and Tina would have performed the song live and been able to show to the world their duet performance live, it definitely could have possibly increased sales in the R&B market in the U.S..\n\nMARTIN JONES: The crowd would’ve went nuts especially me because I love both of them like Barry White come on you talking about a man that make a girls panties drop down and Tina Turner I think that will be in a movie with them together too I did see the claymation figures video and I thought the video was funny as ever but I mean the duet I remember hearing it on the radio when I was little and I said wow that’s a shocker.I would have loved to see Tina Turner and Barry White do that duet in concerts and live performance I think that would have been a knockout.\n\nTINA’S ROCK CLASSIC SINGLE “WHATEVER YOU WANT” IS ANOTHER FAVORITE AMONG FANS. IT REMINDS US HOW GREAT SHE COULD ROCK. THIS SINGLE CO-WRITTEN BY TAYLOR DAYNE SHOWED THAT ROCK STARS CAN BE SEXY AND IT WAS THE OPENING FOR TINA’S WILDEST DREAMS TOUR. MANY FANS SPEAK ABOUT THE SONG, THE VIDEO AND TINA OPENING HER CONCERT WITH THIS SEXY ROCK AND ROLL CLASSIC\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: The song was just perfect for opening the show with. Who can forget the flashing lights like bolts of electricity shooting across the screen as the drums beat and the crowd noise grew in anticipation of seeing the Queen. And then hearing her voice and the thunderous roar and then boom she appeared. Tina always knew the perfect opening and how to work up the crowd.\n\nELYSABETH HUNTER: Thoughts on Whatever You Want? It is seductive. Tina said she will do it for you. I guess the track tells those in America that abandoned her years past, that she can be whatever they want her to be. A RnB Queen, a Rock n Roll Queen. Whatever they need her to be.\n\nWALLACE: This was not my favorite track at all. The song and the performance had to grow on me for a long time. Now, I play it often. HA. Especially the live version from Amsterdam. The band, the voice, the lights are just fantastic.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES; I love shady music and tunes, so “Whatever You Want” grabbed and held my attention immediately. Tina let loose on this tune. I had no idea it was co-written by Taylor Dayne. I watched her live performance of “Whatever You Want” in Amsterdam and she owned the stage with her three female backup dancers. She showed her audience how she still had it as a middle-aged woman who was finally living her life and still knew how to work the crowd.\n\nMARTIN JONES: That’s funny you said that I remember watching Showtime and VH1 when VH1 was music back in the day and also had shows like behind the music legends VH1 one to one pop up video documents and biographies that’s how I learned about Tina Turner in my childhood but to hear her saying whatever you want on a wildest dreams tour it felt like I was in concert ‘cause I couldn’t sit down at the age of 7 every live performance she does is very awesome even dancing on the crate hold do you know that can do that.\n\nJAY’ER: It is one of my favorite songs. I remember seeing it when I saw her perform it in Amsterdam and the live performance to open the show, for me, was the highlight of the concert.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: “Do What You Do” is a combination of her R&B past and rock and roll present. I would say the song connects to her American and African fan base because it bridged blues, R&B, funk, and rock and roll – all of which were created by African-Americans and derived from African rhythms. Tina took it home across the sea from America to Europe to Africa and back.\n\nWALLACE: I like the song a lot. I also love the performance she did with them when the tour opened in South Africa. The song is interesting, but entertaining as well. I’m not too knowledge on her fan base in Africa, however during the wildest dream tour and after, she is considered a favorite.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: This was a catchy tune and the dance moves she created went perfectly with the song. A very funky beat and very catchy tune.\n\nJAY’ER: .: Do What You Do is one of my favorites from the album especially when I saw her perform it live. As far as why it connects with both her fans in the U.S. as well as the fans in Africa, I am not sure as to why it connects to them to be honest.\n\nMARTIN JONES: Well when you hear the lyrics of when you do what you to do it don’t mean a thing don’t mean a thing do gotta do it with love I think you gotta do everything with love unconditionally I mean every lyrics can teach you something in your life and it can make you relate quickly.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: Thief of Hearts was one that Tina had a lot of fun with. An obvious hit for the ladies and for obvious reasons.\n\nWALLACE: Yes. Thieves of hearts is fun. It reminds me of Tina as a performance. When I first heard it, I thought about Tina performing it night after night. It has a edge and a sexiness to it that makes it a good Tina song.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: “Thief of Hearts” is one of my new favorite fast tunes on the album. She showed the fun side of Tina. It took her so far and away from the Ike Turner abuse victim narrative. It became a hit with the ladies because the song’s character was a take-charge, kick-ass, and empowered woman who lived life on her terms. She did not have to wait on a man to fulfill her sexually. She went after her sexual desires, got what she wanted, and left with no strings attached.\n\nJAY’ER: As Tina said in an interview a while ago, “Rock & Roll is fun, it’s naughty”. So I believe that it is a playful naughty song that gives female listeners the fantasy of doing that and the allure of it.\n\nMARTIN JONES: Always thought Tina Turner had a fun side I love it when a woman always have a fun side. I guess it’s because I never knew what the lyrics was when I was little until I realized it now because lady’s been hurt before so maybe they thought they would do the same to men I mean it’s like a 5050 situation.\n\nBARBARA BULLOCK: I did not see the Wildest Dreams tour so I cannot comment on the concert. Silent Wings is a kind of song that I love and can’t listen to at the same time. It is a beautiful song that touches your heart but at the same time it tears it apart as it is such a sad song! I tend to think of people who have passed away, such as her son Craig, when I listen to it.\n\nWALLACE: This song is a deep song for me as it was a song I’ve used for my late daughter Amera Tina Wallace when she passed years ago at her service. It’s a beautiful song and I was happy to know that Tina recorded the song written by James. Tina loves her band and its shows. James knows her sound and she looks comfortable with him every time she performs a number. Overall, Silent Wings is one of those emotional Tina songs\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: This was another brilliant collaboration and a great way to close the shows. To me a very sad song about having to let go of someone you love in a relationship for whatever reason. So real and the song can still be used to remember so many things both good and bad in life.\n\nMANY FANS HAVE USED “SILENT WINGS” TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES.\n\nMARTIN JONES: I mean who wouldn’t have inspiration of from Tina Turner I mean anybody have inspiration whether you’re in a sports or you’re in the movies etc buffer staying too Oh my God that song silent wings it really makes me cry because it’s like you’re flying quietly to become better in the future and when she closed it out I literally cried because that song meant a lot to me I mean I’ve been abused I’ve been bullied up in you know beat down beat up and I’m still here and quietly I’m moving on with my future and I picked myself back up so silent wings is also been an inspiration to me and I thank Tina Turner for singing that song moving us in the crowd.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: I am sure it felt great for both Tina and Sting to perform together. For Tina to know that Sting idolized her must have made the experience more magical. I do not know that much about James Ralston but it must have made his own dreams come true to be acknowledged for his musical contribution to Tina’s album and legacy.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: Tina singing background vocals was a pleasant surprise and the magic of Britten and Lyle shown through again with Something Beautiful Remains. This should have been a big urban hit and especially with the remixes. I guess it came down to marketing again.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: I am not familiar that much with Terry Britten and Graham Lyle, except the fact Terry Britten was responsible for writing the Grammy Award-winning song “What’s Love Got to Do With It.” Tina’s background vocals for “Something Beautiful Remains” were beautiful, elegant, and freeing. It proved that she was not limited in her musical performances.\n\nWALLACE: Yes! Its a great song, but I must say I don’t play that track often. Tina does well with Terry Britten and Graham Lyle, I believe because she is comfortable with them. I think its great to hear her on the background vocals of her recordings as well. Tina can do anything.\n\nBARBARA BULLOCK: Tina can sing anything and the more the better, so yes background vocals definitely work for me as well.\n\nJAY’ER: .: This was the first song I heard from the album before it was released and I was blown away by the lyrics of the song. I was 10 years old when the song. The style of it was different from what I heard from Tina’s previous albums and drew me in as I have always had a love for her voice and music as a whole. Not long after that, I heard the song ‘Wildest Dreams’ with Barry White. From there I liked the entire album.\n\nMARTIN JONES: The magic that Tina created with Terry and Graham is amazing. To put out a song called something beautiful That means something is beautiful that makes you glow inside is it’s just beautiful whatever you do that’s beautiful like swim run jog exercise go shopping look look good to keep your confidence up something beautiful remains I think positivity a is a beauty that remains especially what we go through at this time of day.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: I immediately fell in love with “Confidential” for its soulful dance and romantic vibe. I love how Tina belts out the word “confidential.” I would state how the song gained some LGBTQ fans, given the sexuality of Neil Tennant and the gender-neutral status of Neil and Chris Lowe’s image as the Pet Stop Boys.\n\nWALLACE: Confidential was always one of my favorites of Tina next to Edith and Kingpin. It has a vibe that brings me to that takes me to a certain place. Ha. I loved it when i first heard it and I love it now.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: Confidential was a very unique song in mid-tempo. It was about keeping some things personal between just two people. Tina singing trying to assure person #2 that she could keep matters Confidential. A great collaboration\n\nMARTIN JONES: Oh the pet Shop Boys from London. That’s known for West End girls which is a 1985 classic also love comes quickly and also it’s a sin. The song confidential means keeping it private between you and me I mean at the end of the at the end of the day it’s between that two person you know they don’t have to show the world what they do or what who they are as long as they love each other why not that’s their business.\n\nJAY’ER: Honestly, I cannot answer that because that song was not particularly one of my favorites.\n\nJAY’ER: : As a person who sings about love and relationships, I feel that in the era that music was in at that time, it definitely worked well in Tina’s favor. Lisa Fischer has always had an amazing voice to me, that whistle octave she sings so effortlessly is amazing.\n\nBARBARA BULLOCK: I didn’t know Lisa Fischer until the tour of 2008/2009. On that tour, Lisa Fischer was great I think.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: This one was another mid-tempo tune with brilliant lyrics and great vocals by Lisa. In the times Lisa took over on stage for Tina on It’s Only Rock and Roll, she really showcased her vocal abilities and the crowd soaked it up. Perfection\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: I love Tina singing about love and relationships anyway, especially after becoming a solo artist and coming into her own. The background vocals of Lisa Fischer added her own popular seasoning as a revered background vocalist to the “The Difference Between Us.” Tina and Lisa’s sounds blended beautifully.\n\nWALLACE: Interesting. I didn’t know Lisa was background. You taught me a little something. Its great to know that Tina and Lisa recorded something together. That’s probably why the track sounds good. It flows nice. Lisa already knows how to add that extra Tina flavor to a song.\n\nMARTIN: Tina Turner’s songs about love and relationships is basically what she went through I mean come on her story is just so known so much that I wouldn’t be surprised if some of the songs that are related to her life and her working with Lisa Fisher I mean Lisa Fisher is awesome I mean you’re talking about a Grammy Award winner a Soul Train music award winner who also sang background vocals for Luther Vandross and The Rolling Stones I mean Lisa Fisher has a vocal as well she can go from low to high I mean gosh Lisa Fisher is known for her 1991 hit how can I ease the pain off her album so intense she also did background vocals for Patti LaBelle so for her to do Tina Turner as a background vocalist I wouldn’t be surprised Lisa Fisher should do more albums of herself as well I mean Lisa Fisher does it all and I got a lot of love and respect for her and by the way last goodbye is my favorite Lisa Fisher song as well an this official wherever you at just know I love you and you are still beautiful.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: Tina’s collaboration with Sheryl was a great moment of rock and roll feminism. Tina and Sheryl learned from each other as rock and roll women from two different generations. Tina was in peace with her Buddhist faith after touring all over the world. The song is timeless 25 years later. The world is rebuilding itself during COVID-19. Many people are now realizing how issues, isms, and phobias are social constructs that need to be eradicated, especially after the police murder of George Floyd by Officer Derek Chauvin which the world witnessed. “All Kinds of People” is the balm needed for the healing of humanity.\n\nJAY’ER: .: Being that some collaborations work and that some don’t, I think working with Tina as Sheryl Crow did, she knew that she would be working with an artist who is a true artist. One who would take her song and again, make it their own. Music with lyrics like ones in ‘All Kinds of People’ give people a chance to listen from all walks of life as music is that universal language.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: This was a great collaboration and it produced what should have been a big hit. As was the case with many of her hits, radio and more missed the significance of this song. It could have been used as an anthem for all of those things and more and still could today if it had been and would be marketed as such. Yes, it still is relevant today to many issues in our world.\n\nMARTIN JONES: We still live through it today I mean we are facing racism sexism police brutality but at the end of the day we all come as one Ann united this will be a better place there should not be no hate on this world ’cause the more they hate the more all hail break loose At the end of the day we have to have peace and we have to come as one and have happiness in our hearts.\n\nWALLACE: Yes. That song is really good. Tina’s voice is so strong on it and it is relevant to what is going on today or for any one that is dealing with any type of relationship. Its a great song that requires a strong voice like Tina’s.\n\nBARBARA BULLOCK: Again, I had no idea that this song is not an original from Tina. It sounds it could be! Yes, these topics will always be relevant.\n\nELYSABETH HUNTER: Golden Eye thoughts? First, I was so excited that Tina was on a soundtrack. I jumped up and down in joy. I love the track. At first I didn’t get the correlation of the track and the movie. But after seeing the video, I definitely understood it. It is now one of my favorite tracks and video.\n\nBARBARA BULLOCK: I like the roughness of the song, the intro especially. I honestly do not know any other James Bond theme songs, so this is the only one for me!\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: The song has a mystical, suspenseful feel. Tina made the song this way and presented it like a mini-play on stage. I really liked the eye on stage with her in the middle of it and the slow walk down stage, the costumes, and all the theatrics. I really felt it should have won the Oscar.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: Tina outdid herself with “GoldenEye” for the James Bond film starring Pierce Brosnan. It did not like the original version at first because I thought it sounded so European, but listening to it last night opened my ears and finally heard the R&B in it. When Tina sings about watching GoldenEye from the shadows as a child, I had a visual of a little Black girl looking at James Bond at a street parade.\n\nJAY’ER: : Considering that Tina stated herself that initially she did not like the song because when Bono gave the song to her, it had no real depth to it. When she got a chance to sing it after it was finished, she gave the performance of a lifetime for this song and it is by far the best theme song for a James Bond movie ever, and this song was what truly prompted the Wildest Dreams album. What I like about the song is the arrangement but also I enjoy Tina’s delivery on certain parts in the song.\n\nWALLACE: I love Goldeneye. Its such a great song. Especially now that i’m listening to it more. Tina vocals are amazing. I didn’t realize how popular the song was as people are mentioning it after the HBO doc that just premiered. Its a great thing to see. I know Tina enjoyed recording that.\n\nMARTIN JONES :Goldeneye from Tina Turner is my song the fact that she can go deep too high and vocals real quick is just astonishing meaning at Tina Turner took the 007 hit to another level I mean for the thing goldeneye which is my favorite movie I mean I can’t stop watching it.\n\nMARTIN JONES: Dave jam did a damn good job remixing an urban RnB mix from the gap bands outstanding hit I thought it was very groovy when I first heard it I mean I can vacuum the whole living room playing at all day I mean every urban remixed Tina Turner ever had including something beautiful remains which is also urban remix an open arms is a remix I think Dave jam is very awesome for mixing this together actually two of my favorite artists Tina Turner and The Gap Band so to me it was very awesome very good.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: The Dave Jam Hall/Urban Mix version of “GoldenEye” is my favorite. I bought the cassette single from Nobody Beats the Wiz in 1995 one day after school. I heard it on WBLS 107.5 FM and fell in love with it. I listen to it from time to time. I always envision Tina doing one of the Vanessa Huxtable dances from “The Cosby Show” during the Season 6 opening credits when Tina sings the line: “The other girls they gather around him, if I had him, I wouldn’t let him out.” LOL\n\nJAY’ER: I believe that the producers and the record label wanted to reach different markets and demographics, so mixing music that will reach a broader audience was used to give Tina more of an Urban edge when she has always been known as a Rock & Roll performer after leaving the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: This was so fresh! Urban Radio Marketing could have made this one a big hit for sure.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL: I think of this song as a prayer…. When she sings, “Seeing the way it all should be…” means to me that when one lays down to sleep one can choose to see the world in a loving way with love for all people the way God meant it. The song has a very spiritual message and many people miss it I think. Listen closer and receive it.\n\nBARBARA BULLOCK: It’s great to hear Tina singing with a Gospel Choir as it is a small tribute to her roots in Tennessee.\n\nJAY’ER: I can’t say as to why it is a favorite amongst fans, personally speaking, I like the song because it showed a different side of Tina than what we have heard in previous years.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: I fell in love with “Dancing in My Dreams” instantly upon hearing it. It was a homage to her church background as a little girl growing in NutBush, Tennessee. I used to think Tina totally distanced herself from her gospel roots but she did not. It is evident in this song. The song is another favorite of her fans because of her inspirational story from neglected child to abused wife to survivor to international icon.\n\nWALLACE: Dancing dreams is great to hear when i’m in a relaxing mood. To hear Tina go into her gospel roots in great in so many ways. No matter what Tina sings, that gospel soul sound will always come out. Especially if she is in the mood.\n\nMARTIN JONES: ’m too young to know who Brenda Russell is who is known for songs like way back when in 1979 and the 1988 classic piano in the dark Brenda Russell also been writing songs dancing in my dreams I think we can all relate to dancing in our dreams there’s been playing times I had dreams of dancing with Tina Turner after that it makes me feel good I mean I wouldn’t mind a song like that and even at her gospel roots of course she said Mahalia Jackson was one of her inspirations of of gospel music I think it’s good I mean gospel music it uplifts as you so if Tina Turner could put that in a gospel choir Anna gospel roots that’s that’s why people just fail to realize Tina Turner really didn’t forget her roots because if she did she wouldn’t be putting like this on the album I just think Tina Turner just wanted to be herself and I respect her for that she taught me how to be myself.\n\nThe fans also spoke about how Tina’s Wildest Dreams made an impact on them.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL:\n\n-The album was special to me because I ordered the vinyl and had it shipped to the address where I lived which was in the country near Jackson, TN. It was so exciting getting it, opening it, and putting it on the turntable. All of the songs resonate with many of my life experiences and being able to actually see where Tina came from creates a feeling that is hard to describe.\n\nELYSABETH HUNTER: Reflections as a black woman? As a black woman, I love the seduction of the album. It allows people to see the versatility of Tina as an artist and woman. It allows us to see her as a woman and not a machine as she was with Ike. A complete other side. This album I feel shows her vulnerable side.\n\nBARBARA BULLOCK: I actually missed it when it came out, but had an opportunity to listen to it many years later.\n\nWALLACE: Tina taught me about endurance. She taught me that its okay’s to make mistakes and to fix them. As a black man, she taught me how to be myself and to be proud of who I am and the things that I like to do. To not stay in a box and to remember that everything changes. Nothing stays the same.\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: I did not listen to the WILDEST DREAMS album 25 years ago when I began my sophomore year as a transfer student from City College to York College. I was not fully into Tina Turner at the time. I felt she walked away from her Blackness by moving to Europe, living with Erwin Bach, and speaking with a more pronounced European accent. I was very young, Afrocentric, and angry, so I did not associate Tina with my idea of Blackness. 25 years later, my attitudes and beliefs have shifted dramatically so I no longer view Tina as a race traitor. I consider Tina my musical godmother. I am realizing the impact of WILDEST DREAMS now after listening twice to it.\n\nMARTIN JONES: Yes I was young I was like six or seven when is album came out on Virgin records I remember going to stores and scene album it made an impact on me because I was going through a hard time with my parents when they were arguing fighting so watching her on Oprah and watching her promote this album on every tours and seeing it on TV was like wow I wish I could have went to the concert . I remember my mother had a Tina Turner pouch bag from Hanes And it was black and gold and I used to hide it in my bedroom.\n\nJAY’ER: ‘Wildest Dreams’ was an album that allowed me to continue to see why Tina Turner is one of my favorite influences in music and why I wanted to be a singer.\n\nDA-PROFESOR HAD JUST LEARNED THAT TINA WILL BE FINALLY INDUCTED INTO THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME FOR THE 2ND TIME AND SHE MADE HERSTORY: SHE WILL BE THE 1ST BLACK FEMALE SINGER TO BE INDUCTED INTO THE HALL OF FAME TWICE. AS A MEMBER OF A DUO AND AS A SOLO ARTISTS. HERE ARE THE MESSAGES THAT THE FANS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT TINA.\n\nKEITH GAMBILL :I would love to be able to have a conversation with her and tell her my story and how it impacted my life. I would love a hug, kiss, autograph, and pic and to leave her with a letter of my most treasured memories.\n\nELYSABETH HUNTER: I just hope and pray I can visit Zurich soon so I can stand outside her gate. If she comes outside, it will make my life!!\n\nWALLACE: Tina Mae, I’m glad that you are resting and taking care of yourself. Enjoy your flowers and you well deserved them. We love ya!\n\nDONALD PEEBLES: Please tell Tina that I love her and that I thank her for inspiring and healing the world with her humanity through music, experience, survival, resiliency, beauty, spirituality, and wisdom.\n\nBARBARA BULLOCK: I am happy that little Anna Mae has made her dreams come true and impacted my life more than anyone else.\n\nMARTIN JONES: I would say to Tina thank you for making me believe in myself when I didn’t when I was battling stage two squamous cell cancer and was free from it I remember reading your book my love story and you say you could turn poison into medicine that verse well actually that quote stick with me until this day.And the fact that you are a Sagittarius just like me you are born November 26 1939 I was born December 5th 1989 and the fact that you didn’t give up and you knew anything was possible even going through abandonment going to abuse relationships going through record labels that slammed the door in your face until that another door opened and the fact that you didn’t let age define who you are and that you make good impression of yourself Anne taught me that you can be black and still conquered the whole world and love everybody so I thank you Tina Turner for that and I think you forget me through rough times in my life you are the reason I am the person I am today.\n\nJAY’ER: : Well, yes. I have a lot to say to Tina Turner but not just regarding the album. I want to say to Tina Turner: “Tina, thank you for being the strong woman that I have seen that you are. Thank you for showing me that no matter the struggle, to keep believing that everything will work out fine. You are my music influence and I am so thankful that I have had the chance to know your music in my lifetime. You are an inspiration to people around the world, and as one Sagittarian to another, we are able to share our gifts with the world along with showing the world our strengths. I love you from the bottom of my heart and at this stage of your life, you deserve all of the joy and happiness given to you. God bless you Tina Turner, you’re simply the best!!!”\n\nDA-PROFESSOR WOULD ONCE AGAIN LIKE TO THANKS KEITH GAMBILL, ELYSABETH HUNTER, WALLACE, DONALD PEEBLES, MARTIN JONES, JAY’ER AND BARBARA BULLOCK FOR TAKING PART IN THIS INTERVIEW. DA-PROFESSOR ALSO WANTS TO SEND A HUGE CONGRATULATIONS FOR TINA FOR MAKING HERSTORY AGAIN. FROM SCORING A # 1 HIT AT THE AGE OF 80 TO FINALLY BEING INDUCTED INTO THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME AS A SOLO ARTIST IS AMAZING. YOU CONTINUE TO INSPIRE ME TO PURSUSE MY DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS. I STARTED CHANTING AND I’M GOING TO BECOME MORE SERIOUS ABOUT CHANTING. THANKS FOR RECORDING ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE ALBUMS. YOU’RE SIMPLY THE BEST AND YOU’RE STILL LIVING YOUR WILDEST DREAMS. STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE.\n\nA few weeks ago I logged into Facebook and saw many posts about Grammy Award Winning DJ/Rapper/Producer Spinderella being fired from the group Salt-N-Pepa. I was shocked, hurt and pissed at how it went down. Spin as she’s also called by fans had posted a statement on her Instagram page saying that she received a termination letter by her former group mates via email in January and they didn’t even bother to inform the fans who had purchased tickets to expect to see the trio on the mixtape tour with New Kids on The Block, Debbie Gibson, Tiffany and Naughty By Nature. When fans who attended the opening night noticed that the DJ performing was not Spin, they wondered what was going on and Spin decided to break her silence. Well I was and still am hurt, mad and pissed at how Spin was treated. Though she wasn’t the group’s original DJ, she helped the group become a house hold name with her skills, looks and her down to earth, laid back and outgoing personality. She even filled in for Pepa when she pregnant with her 1st child. Many fans are upset about how she was mistreated and this isn’t the 1st time that Spin has been shaded by Salt-N-Pepa and as a music historian, blogger and podcast host who always features the group in my yearly Women’s Herstory Month podcast, I feel that Spin deserves to be treated with respect and paid equally.\n\nSalt-N-Pepa’s beginnings started when Brooklyn Born Cheryl James met Kingston, Jamaican born Sandra (Sandy) Denton at Queensborough Community College where they both were majoring in nursing. The two later got a job working at Sears where their friendship blossomed. They later became friends with Actor/Comedian Martin Lawrence and fellow student Hurby Luv Bug Azor who would all become a part of entertainment history. Luv Bug was majoring in music and record production at the Center for Media Arts and asked Cheryl and Sandy to be a part of a class project. The result was the single called “The Show Stoppa” an response to Doug E Fresh & The Get Fresh Crew’s classic “The Show” which became a huge hit on radio. Impressed with the success of the single, Cheryl and Sandy decided to pursue a career in Rap and Luv Bug decided to name them Salt-N-Pepa. Cheryl was dubbed Salt due to her light complexion and laid back personality while Sandy was dubbed Pepa due to her wild and outgoing personality along with her Jamaican-West Indian Heritage and Sassiness. The duo signed with Next Plateau Records and began to work on their debut album with Luv Bug handling the production and writing most of the material. Wanting the group to stand out, Herb decided that the group should have a female DJ and he recruited DJ Latoya Hanson and dubbed her Spinderella to complete the group and it help them gain a large fan base. The group scored hits including “I’ll Take Your Man” and “My Mic Sounds Nice” which quickly became instant classics and helped their debut album “Hot Cool and Vicious” reached gold and platinum status. The group began to perform sold out shows and inspire many fans especially females including Queen Latifah, Da-Brat and Oaktown’s 357 to pursue careers in Hip-Hop, but by the time they released their 3rd single and 1st video for their single “Tramp” fans had noticed that Hanson wasn’t in the video nor the album cover for the follow single a Hip-Hop version of The Pointer Sisters classic Chick On The Side. Back then the story for Hanson’s leaving was she had became pregnant and wanted to spend time raising her daughter. That was a small part of the story. In interviews on BET’s Video Vibrations and on the group’s Behind The Music documentary, the real reasons was revealed. “She wasn’t into it” Salt said and claimed on Video Vibrations. The 1st Spinderella had different accounts. “There were female ego problems. Clash of personalities” Latoya said on “Video Vibrations” Latoya also revealed in Behind the Music that Salt thought that she was having an affair with their producer who Salt was dating at the time. Both Latoya and Herb has denied Salt’s accusations, while LaToya also disputed Salt and Herb’s claims that she didn’t attend shows and sessions when in reality she did and was eager to work, but she didn’t feel appreciated by the group. Mainly Salt. Latoya left the group and has been performing as The Original Spinderella or The Original. She has performed on the Iconic Hip-Hop concert Sisters In The Name of Rap and has written her memoirs which hasn’t been published as well as a new single in 2017.\n\nShorty after the release of Tramp, DJ and Producer Cameron Paul had remixed the single’s B-Side “Push It” which quickly gained radio play and promoted promoters to book the group to perform and tour. Herb decided to recruit a new female DJ to take Latoya’s spot and many females including radio gossip personality Wendy Williams had auditioned, but the female who wounded up getting the spot was Deidre Roper who was born and raised in East New York’s Pink Housing Projects. Dee Dee as she’s also known by became interested in music by listening to her father’s record collection. By the time she reached her 13th birthday, she had began to DJ courtesy of her late boyfriend who was a popular DJ in his own right. She became popular around the Brooklyn area and many were captivated by her styles, looks and her spirit. She has a old soul and youthful spirit. Dee Dee was in high school when one of her classmates who happened to know Herb had asked her about joining the group. She audition and won him over. He gave her the name Spinderella and wanted her to join the group, but since she was still a teenager, Herb had to gain permission from her parents to join the group and tour. Her parents especially her father granted permission and made sure that she got a fair deal and was provided a tutor to help her keep up with her studies. Dee Dee made her 1st official appearance with Salt-N-Pepa at the Westchester Music Festival and in the video for their hit single “Push It” and many fans quickly fell in love with Spin. Many fans especially guys loved her skills and named her as one of their teenage crushes. In 1988, the group released their 2nd album “A Salt With A Deadly Pepa” which went platinum and earned them American Music Award and Grammy nominations due to the success of their singles “Shake Your Thang” featuring E.U. and “Get Up Everybody” with the latter featuring Spin’s scratching skills. The album also features and album track “Spinderella’s Not a Fella (But A Girl DJ)” which further demonstrates her skills. Spin also showed her dancing skills in the videos as well. In late 1989, Spin began to show the industry that she was more than a DJ. While the group was working on their album “Blacks Magic” Pepa learned she was pregnant with her 1st child and had to take time off from recording and their producer Herb was busy producing other acts and working on the House Party soundtrack. With the label pushing the group for a new album, Spin and Salt started to recruit other producers as well as produce several tracks on the album which was released in the spring of 1990. Spin had rapped on several songs including “Negro With An Ego” and produced the album’s title track which went platinum and showed the industry that the group was capable of writing and producing hits on their own. In 1993, the group began to work on their classic multi-platinum album “Very Necessary” which became a hit and their best selling album to date. While Herb handled most of the production, the trio had advocated to have more creative control and be more involved with the writing, production and song selection as well as renegotiating their contract to receive more money. The album also featured Spin rapping on many of the songs including the album’s 2nd single “Whatta Man” featuring EnVogue which became a hit with many of their fans including many in the LGBT/SGL Community and their classic “None of Your Business” which made them the 1st Female Rap Group to win a Grammy Award. Spin also wrote and produced the album track “Step” and while it wasn’t released a single, it became a favorite among fans who loved Spin’s lyrics and flow and while it was written from a female’s perspective, many fans had revealed how it helped them leave toxic abusive relationships. In addition to winning a Grammy, the group was also honored by The Lady of Soul Awards where they were also by the 1st Lady of Soul awards where they were honored with the Entertainer of the Year award for their contributions to music. The group had also decided to several ties with Herb for good. In addition to performing, Spin had also spent time raising her daughter who she had with former NBA star Kenny Anderson. She also opened a successful spa in New York where many flocked to get beauty and spiritual make overs. In 1997, the group signed with Red Ant Records and released their long-awaited album “Brand New” which got great reviews and scored many hits including “R U Ready” and “Gitty Up” with the latter featuring samples of Rick James’ classic Give It To Me Baby and Spinderella rapping. Despite the success of the singles, the album only reached gold status due to the record label filing for bankruptcy shortly before the album’s release. The group still tour to promote the album but found themselves performing at theatres and clubs. Shortly after the year 2000, Pep was chilling in Spin’s spa when she received a call from Salt who had some startling news: she had decided to disband the group by telling Pep she no longer wanted to be joined at the hip. Both Pep and Spin was shocked, surprised and pissed at how Salt decided to end the group. During their time apart, Spin had relocated to California where she pursued a career as an actress as well as becoming a sought after DJ. She also hosted a successful radio show called The Backspin which featured her playing classic Old School Rap and Hip-Hop music. Pepa had married Award winning Rapper/Actor Treach of Naughty By Nature in 1999 shortly after giving birth to their daughter Egypt. They divorced 2 years later and have resumed their friendship. Salt had become spiritual and spent time overcoming a private battle with beliuma, being active in her church and spending time with her now ex-husband Gavin and their children.\n\nIn 2005 the trio reunited for the VH-1 Hip-Hop honors where they were honored for their contributions to Hip-Hop Music. They also teamed up with EnVogue to perform their classic “Whatta Man” marking the 1st time that both groups had performed their classic live along with EnVogue’s line-up who had also reunited as well. 2 years later Spin had appeared on Salt-N-Pepa’s reality show “The Salt-N-Pepa Show”and in the 1st episode Spin appeared in, she wanted to speak about the issues she had including not being treated and paid equally. and not allowing her to a full fleged co member of the group instead of treating her like a hired employee. An issued that fans were made aware of in the group’s Behind The Music documentary where it was revealed that after the group signed with Red Ant Records, the label gave them a 6 million dollar advance or bonus and while Cheryl and Sandy split the money equally between themselves, they gave Dee Dee a small portion. “Spin got paid” Sandy said with attitude and no shame while Salt’s excuse and reason was Dee Dee wasn’t there in the beginning when we had to log and carry own our equipment. In other words, Cheryl felt and feels that Dee Dee didn’t pay her dues like they did and she came along when the group was starting to become a international house hold name. I will be giving my feelings about this later on in this blog. Both had given her props but claimed that by hiring her it would help boast her career and brand. Around 2010, tensions began to flare and Cheryl and Sandy decided to embark on several tours without Dee Dee. There were times when they would perform with music tracks and there were times when they hired male DJ’s to fill Spin’s spot which took away from the group’s concept as well as enraged and pissed fans who blasted them on social media for being shady towards Spin. Fans would protest, return their money and post they would not attend a show if Spin wasn’t performing with them. It seemed like Cheryl and Sandy had came to their senses and worked things out with Spin. They began to feature her on more shows and in 2016, they along with Queen Latifah, Missy Elliot and Lil’ Kim were honored by VH-1 for their contributions to Rap and Hip-Hop. Things seemed to be going well until the 1st week of May when Spin posted her statement on instragram about being terminated by Cheryl and Sandy in January while they continued to use her photos in promotions without informing the fans who are still enraged at how she was mistreated. Several fans have returned their tickets and while many stated they would go to take soda and bathroom breaks during Cheryl and Sandy’s set. One fan even posted about wearing a Spinderella shirt as a form of protesting their childish behavior. I also believe that Red Ant filing for bankruptcy before the group released it’s 5th and final album was karma that Cheryl and Sandy received for not paying Dee Dee fairly. I watched a few of the clips of their performances on You Tube and I’ve notice that the video screens barely show the DJ who they hired to replace Spin on tour. Nor has she been introduced to the crowd.\n\nHere’s Da-Professor’s take on why Dee Dee needs to be treated with respect.\n\nShe was and still is a major part of Salt-N-Pepa. Herb decided to have the group stand out by having a female DJ for them which puts them in a class by themselves.\n\n2. Dee Dee paid her dues. She didn’t join Cheryl and James not having skills. Like Latoya, Dee Dee practiced on a daily basis to develop her unique style of blending, cutting, mixing and scratching and spending her weekends and summers DJaying parties throughout her hometown of Brooklyn.\n\n3. Filling in for Pep. When Pepa had to go on maternity leave, Spin filled in for her while the group was recording their 3rd album “Black Magic.” In addition to scratching on several tracks, Spin had also began rapping to fill in the temporary gap that Pep left. Spin rapped on the album track “Negro With An Ego” and she also rapped on the album’s title track which she helped produced. Plus she also joined Salt on a press and promotional tour to promote the album’s lead single “Expression” which Salt wrote and produced. Spin and Salt appeared on Yo MTV Raps without Pep.\n\n4. Being more involved creatively on their multiplatinum classic Grammy Award winning album “Very Necessary.” Spin rapped on 4 of the songs including the Grammy Award winning hit “None of Your Business” and “Whatta Man” Her flow on the latter shows her ability to flow mellow and with sass. Whenever she performed her part live the crowd goes crazy. Especially the hopeless romantics, the hood ladies and hood boys and members of the LGBT/SGL Community. The album track “Step” is another favorite among fans including myself. Spin co-produced and wrote this track as well as show cased her ability rap on a track solo. Her vocals on this track has a youthful yet serious tone which appealed to many young fans. Though the song was written from a lady’s perspective, many fans of both genders loved this song and many had spoke about how it helped them leave toxic relationships. I recall loaning my tape to a former friend’s brother (who just earned his 2nd’s master degree in music) and him telling me that was one of his favorite songs.\n\n5. Appearing in all of the videos. When Dee Dee joined the group, she appeared in all of their videos and she was featured in several group shots and had several close ups. She also had dancing and speaking roles as well. In their video for “Get Up Everybody” Cheryl and Sandy was seen leaving the jail after being arrested in for quote on quote dirty dancing in “Shake Your Thang.” After being released, Dee Dee arrived at the precent to pick them up in a fly jeep and inform them that they had to be an event which was a street dance battle.\n\n6. DJing live for Cheryl and Sandy. As mentioned throughout this blog, Herbie decided to have Salt-N-Pepa stand out by having a female DJ and it was a innovative and smart idea. It helped give the group more fans and it also added to their sex appeal and sexiness. Many Men love seeing Beautiful Talented Ladies and having both LaToya and Dee Dee spin, cut, scratch and hype the crowd was and is not only sexy, but empowering. Especially during the time when many females were still working to get into the industry and while Sequence was the 1st female rap group to sign a record deal and release hit singles, Salt-N-Pepa and Spin carried the torch and added something different. This also inspired many groups to hire female DJ’s including TLC who had originally had a female DJ during their 1st tour named DJ Dolemix.\n\n7. Dee Dee also made sacrifices. When she was recruited, she was in high school and not only did she have to leave school and finish her education with a tutor, she had sacrifice the last years of her teen years by performing and recording which meant spending time rehearsing, recording, doing school work and not being able to hang out with her friends and go to her high school prom. Cheryl and Sandy had graduated from high school and were already experiencing becoming adults such as attending college and working to make extra money to help their families and to have some spending change in their pocketbooks, where as Spin had to fly into Brooklyn after performing a show the previous night to attend her high school graduation and collect her high school diploma. She also had to break up with her 1st love, who taught her how to DJ and who sadly was shot in killed while visiting family and friends in North Carolina. She spoke about this in Behind The Music and I felt her pain. Especially when she gave the signal to inform the camera crew to stop filming and when a picture of them sharing a kiss in the projects came on right after.\n\nDeidre Dee Dee Roper is a part of Music Herstory and Hip-Hop culture and Cheryl Salt James & Sandy Pepa Denton needs to humble themselves and get off their ras asses and start treating Spin with respect and paying her fairly. She’s a major part of Salt-N-Pepa and she doesn’t deserve this mistreatment. I don’t hate Cheryl and Sandy, but I don’t like the way they’re behaving and they can’t be talking about female unity and empowerment while mistreating their DJ like this. It’s time for them to start acting more mature and chill with the shade because they will loose fans and respect."
