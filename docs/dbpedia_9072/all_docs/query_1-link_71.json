        "text": "Joni Mitchell’s vault will get an even deeper dig this fall with the release of a 6-CD boxed set that will bring together about a hundred previously unreleased recordings from the fruitful late ’70s period in which jazz exerted its greatest influence on her output.\n\nTitled “Joni Mitchell Archives, Vol. 4: The Asylum Years (1976-1980),” the set will be out Oct. 4, via Rhino. This collection of demos, studio outtakes and live tracks comes on the heels of a June set that boxed up all the original studio albums from this same period. The albums that came out during the time frame are 1976s “Hejira,” 1977’s double-LP “Don Juan’s Reckless Daughter,” 1979’s “Mingus” and the 1980 live album “Shadows and Light.”\n\nMore from Variety\n\nJoni Mitchell Rewrites 'I'm Still Standing' and Metallica Slays 'Love Lies Bleeding,' Among Standouts in PBS' Touching Elton John/Bernie Taupin Tribute: TV Review\n\nJoni Mitchell Music Is Back on Spotify, After She Joined Neil Young in Pulling Songs Over Joe Rogan's COVID 'Lies'\n\nJoni Mitchell and Tracy Chapman Made for an Outstanding Grammys, but the Show Has Forgotten How to Spotlight New Artists: TV Review\n\nVinyl enthusiasts will be able to purchase a condensed and distilled version of the collection as a four-LP set, described as containing Mitchell’s own personal favorites from the larger digital package.\n\nA preview track, “Intro to Coyote/Coyote,” recorded live in Canada in December 1975 when she was out on tour with Bob Dylan, was released Thursday.\n\nMusic fans who wished that Dylan’s “Rolling Thunder Revue” boxed set of a few years back had included material from other artists on that tour will see part of their wishes fulfilled with the Mitchell box: the first 11 tracks in this new set come from her Rolling Thunder sets of 1975-76 (actually predating the first year listed in the collection’s title, by just a bit), courtesy of the Bob Dylan Archives. Other live material covered includes Mitchell’s own headlining 1976 tour, a 1979 tour, and recordings culled from her appearances at the Bread & Roses Festival and Anti-Nuclear Rally.\n\nThe studio sessions represented will allow fans to hear more of what she was doing with such masterful jazz talents as Herbie Hancock, Jaco Pastorious, Wayne Shorter and Pat Metheny.\n\nAs with previous installments in the “Archives” series, Cameron Crowe contributed to the package’s liner notes, engaging in conversation with Mitchell to bring out memories and anecdotes from the period covered.\n\nMitchell’s long road of recovery from health setbacks in recent years will reach another culmination this fall when she headlines two appearances at the Hollywood Bowl Oct. 19-20 under the banner of a “Joni Jam.” Brandi Carlile has produced a few previous public Joni Jams at the Bowl and elsewhere, including a Newport Folk Festival appearance that was released as a live album.\n\nThe full CD and vinyl track lists:\n\n6CD Tracklisting\n\nDisc One:\n\nRolling Thunder Revue\n\nLive In Niagara Falls\n\nConvention Center, Niagara Falls, NY, November 15, 1975\n\nRecorded by L.A.
