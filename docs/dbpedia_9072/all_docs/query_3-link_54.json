        "text": "NOTE: There Are Both Online and Virtual Events Listed Here\n\nBook Talks: Judith Freeman & MacArthur Park, with Barbara Feldon & Getting Smarter via Chevalier’s Bookstore – Online Event\n\nLongtime friends Judith Freeman and Barbara Feldon will discuss their newest books, the novel MacArthur Park and the memoir Getting Smarter, respectively.\n\nJudith Freeman is a novelist and non-fiction writer whose most recent novel, MacArthur Park, is set in Los Angeles and the rural West. Friends Jolene and Verna share complicated ties that have crystallized over time. Beginning when they were girls discovering their needs and desires, their ongoing stories have been inextricably linked. But when Verna marries Vincent, Jolene’s ex-husband, their paths may have finally, permanently diverged. Now, on a trip to their hometown in Utah, they are forced to confront both the truths and falsehoods of their memories of each other and of their early friendship.\n\nBarbara Feldon is best known as “Agent 99” on the 1960’s TV series, Get Smart. She is the author of Living Alone and Loving it! and various essays. Her memoir Getting Smarter relates her dramatic and sometimes zany adventures with a glamorous Frenchman, her initiation into show business, and the fun of working in Hollywood.\n\nNOTE: See site for tickets, guidelines, and details.\n\nWhere: Chevalier’s Bookstore\n\nDate: Monday the 30th\n\nTime: 4 pm\n\nAddress: Online Event (see site)\n\nWebsite: https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_VJDEnKimRl6AwuRjBHEuYA\n\nDiana Goetsch, with Thomas Peele, & This Body I Wore at Skylight Bookstore – Online Event\n\nDiana Goetsch, in conversation with Thomas Peele, will present and discuss her new book: This Body I Wore (Farrar, Straus and Giroux).\n\nThis is a captivating memoir of one woman’s long journey to late transition, as the trans community emerges alongside her. Goetsch has not written a transition memoir, but rather a full account of a trans life, one both unusually public and closeted. All too often trans lives are reduced to before-and-after photos, but what if that before photo lasted fifty years?\n\n“How can you spend your life face-to-face with an essential truth about yourself and still not see it?” This is a question often asked of trans people, and a question that Goetsch, an award-winning poet and essayist, addresses with the power and complexity of lived reality. She brings us into her childhood, her time as a dynamic and beloved teacher at Stuyvesant High School, and her plunge into the crossdressing subculture of New York in the 1980s and ’90s. Under cover of night, crossdressers risked their jobs and their safety to give expression to urges they could neither control nor understand. Many of them would become late transitioners, the Cinderellas of the trans community largely ignored by history.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, book purchase, and details.\n\nWhere: Skylight Bookstore\n\nDate: Monday the 30th\n\nTime: 6 pm\n\nAddress: Online (see site)\n\nWebsite: https://www.skylightbooks.com/event/live-crowdcast-diana-goetsch-presents-body-i-wore-thomas-peele\n\nIn-Store Book Talk: Marissa R. Moss & Her Country at Chevalier’s Bookstore – In-Person Event\n\nAuthor Marissa R. Moss will present and discuss her new book, Her Country: How the Women of Country Music Became the Success They Were Never Supposed to Be.\n\nThis book is the full and unbridled inside story of the last twenty years of country music through the lens of Maren Morris, Mickey Guyton, and Kacey Musgraves—their peers and inspirations, their paths to stardom, and their battles against a deeply embedded boys’ club, as well as their efforts to transform the genre into a more inclusive place for all (and not just white men in trucker hats), as told by award-winning Nashville journalist Marissa R. Moss.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, guidelines, and details.\n\nWhere: Chevalier’s Bookstore\n\nDate: Monday the 30th\n\nTime: 7 pm – 8 pm\n\nAddress: 133 N.

Registration is required.\n\nRaquel Baker earned a PhD in English Literary Studies from the University of Iowa and an MFA in Creative Writing from Mills College. She is currently Assistant Professor of Postcolonial Studies and Transnational Literatures at CSU Channel Islands. She has published poetry and nonfiction and done readings with the Ventura Poetry Project.\n\nWhere: Beyond Baroque – Online event (tickets at Eventbrite)\n\nDate: Monday the 30th\n\nTime: 7:30 pm – 10 pm\n\nAddress: Zoom Online\n\nWebsite: https://beyondbaroque.org/free_workshops.html\n\nTori Eldridge, with Cynthia Pelayo, & Dance Among the Flames via Book Soup – Online Event\n\nTori Eldridge, in conversation with Cynthia Pelayo, will discuss her new book Dance Among the Flames.\n\nFrom the author of the Lily Wong series comes Dance Among the Flames, which talks a dark journey into Brazilian mysticism about a desperate mother who rises from the slums to embrace Quimbanda magic amid her quest for the ultimate revenge. Across forty years, three continents, and a past incident in 1560 France, Serafina Olegario tests the boundaries of love, power, and corruption as she fights to escape her life of poverty and abuse. Serafina’s quest begins in Brazil when she’s possessed by the warrior goddess Yansã, who emboldens her to fight yet threatens to consume her spirit. Fueled by power and enticed by Exú, an immortal trickster and intermediary to the gods, Serafina turns to the seductive magic of Quimbanda. It’s dangerous to dance in the fire. But when you come from nothing, you have nothing to lose.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, link, and details.\n\nWhere: Book Soup\n\nDate: Tuesday the 31st\n\nTime: 6 pm – 8 pm\n\nAddress: Book Soup – Online event (see site)\n\nWebsite: https://www.booksoup.com/event/tori-eldridge-conversation-cynthia-pelayo-discusses-dance-among-flames\n\nBenjamin Marra, David Birke and Nicholas McCarthy & Disciples Book Launch at Skylight Bookstore – Online Event\n\nDisciples is a seamless collaboration between cartoonist Ben Marra and filmmakers David Birke and Nicholas McCarthy. Birke and McCarthy’s script celebrates and reinvents a cult film ethos. It combines the best of 1970s era eerie-thriller-terror movies in a fresh and revelatory way, that is similar to how Marra has continued/reinvented the work of Abel Ferrara and George Cosmatos in graphic novels like Night Business.\n\nMarin County, 1978. In this graphic novel, teens Clara and Wendy get high one night alone at home. Before the night ends, they’ve disappeared—until five months later, when Clara is found, disheveled, but alive, in Death Valley National Park.\n\nFrom Clara’s mysterious reappearance in Death Valley, Disciples cuts to the present day, where stories of “The California Cult” and its enigmatic—and never-caught—leader, Billy Joe, are as much a part of the popular culture as the Manson Family. Clara, the lone survivor of the cult, has adopted a new identity to protect her and her daughter, Wren. And she mostly does, until one night when the past and present horrifically collide.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, book purchase, and details.\n\nWhere: Skylight Bookstore\n\nDate: Tuesday the 31st\n\nTime: 6 pm\n\nAddress: Online (see site)\n\nWebsite: https://www.skylightbooks.com/event/live-crowdcast-disciples-launch-event-benjamin-marra-david-birke-and-nicholas-mccarthy\n\nKimberly Wolf & Talk with Her at Diesel Bookstore – In-Person Event\n\nAuthor Kimberly Wolf will present and discuss her new book, Talk with Her: A Dad’s Essential Guide to Raising Healthy, Confident, and Capable Daughters.\n\n“Communication” with your daughter doesn’t mean having “big” conversations all the time. Creating even the smallest moments of father-daughter connection can build bonds. In Talk with Her, you’ll find information on nineteen topics defining your daughter’s life—including body positivity, romantic relationships, social media, mental health, and academic achievement—along with the communication strategies you’ll need to address them with care and confidence.\n\nKimberly Wolf, M.Ed., is an educator, speaker, and educational consultant with an undergraduate degree in gender studies from Brown University and a master’s degree in human development and psychology from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Fifteen years into her career, through conversations with friends, colleagues, and collaborators who were fathers of daughters, Wolf realized she was in a unique position to demystify girlhood for dads, helping them communicate better with their daughters, maximize their parental impact, and inspire young women to reach their potential.\n\nNOTE: See site for guidelines and details.\n\nWhere: Diesel Bookstore, in the Courtyard\n\nDate: Tuesday the 31st\n\nTime: 6:30 pm\n\nAddress: 225 26th St., Suite 33, Santa Monica, CA 90402\n\nWebsite: https://www.dieselbookstore.com/event/kimberly-wolf\n\nRebecca Walker & Women Talk Money: Breaking the Taboo at Vroman’s – In-Person Event\n\nRebecca Walker will present and discuss her new book, Women Talk Money: Breaking the Taboo.\n\nThis book is a groundbreaking collection that lifts the veil on what women talk about when they talk about money; it unflinchingly recounts the power of money to impact health, define relationships, and shape identity. The collection includes previously unpublished essays by trailblazing writers, activists, and models, such as Alice Walker, Tressie McMillan Cottom, Rachel Cargle, Tracy McMillan, Cameron Russell, Sonya Renee Taylor, Adrienne Maree Brown, and more, with Rebecca Walker as editor.\n\nIn this provocative anthology, we discover a family that worships money even as it tears them apart; we read about the “financial death sentence” a transgender woman must confront to live as herself. We trace the journey of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who finally makes enough money to discover her spiritual impoverishment; we follow a stressful email exchange between an unsympathetic university financial officer and a desperate family who can’t afford to pay their daughter’s tuition, and more.\n\nThis collection is a clarion call to conduct honest conversations that demystify and transform the role money plays in our lives. Dazzlingly resonant and deeply familiar, Women Talk Money is a revelation.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, guidelines, and details.\n\nWhere: Vroman’s\n\nDate: Tuesday the 31st\n\nTime: 7 pm\n\nAddress: 695 E.

Once brimming with dreams and ideals instilled in him by his eternally bohemian grandmother, a survivor of the Holocaust who has dedicated her life to passion and pleasure, Sol now finds the senseless jargon he produces at work seeping into all aspects of the world around him–and most disturbingly, into the art that his beloved grandmother taught him to revere.\n\nA personal tragedy drives Sol to leave New York and accept an invitation to The Coded Garden, an artists’ colony on a tropical island, whose mysterious patron, Sebastian Light, seems to offer the very escape Sol desperately needs. But the longer he remains in the Garden, the more that Light comes to resemble Trump himself, and the games he plays with Sol become more dangerous.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, guidelines and event details.\n\nWhere: Book Soup\n\nDate: Wednesday 1st\n\nTime: 7 pm\n\nAddress: 8818 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, CA 90069\n\nWebsite: https://www.booksoup.com/event/alexander-maksik-conversation-scott-burton-discusses-long-corner\n\nIn-Store Book Talk: Francesca Giacco, with Janelle Brown, & Six Days in Rome at Chevalier’s Bookstore – In-Person Event\n\nAuthor Francesca Giacco, in conversation with Janelle Brown, will present and discuss her new novel, Six Days in Rome.\n\nThis book is a decadent and evocative novel in which a young artist travels to Rome to heal a broken heart.\n\nEmilia arrives in Rome reeling from heartbreak and reckoning with her past. What was supposed to be a romantic trip has, with the sudden end of a relationship, become a solitary one instead. As she wanders, music, art, food, and the beauty of Rome’s wide piazzas and narrow streets color Emilia’s dreamy, but weighty experience of the city. She considers the many facets of her life, drifting in and out of memory, following her train of thought wherever it leads.\n\nWhile climbing a hill near Trastevere, she meets John, an American expat living a seemingly idyllic life. They are soon navigating an intriguing connection, one that brings pain they both hold into the light.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, guidelines, and details.\n\nWhere: Chevalier’s Bookstore\n\nDate: Wednesday the 1st\n\nTime: 7 pm – 8 pm\n\nAddress: 133 N.

The first crucial step toward becoming an engaged steward of the planet is connecting with our climate emotions, seeing them as a sign of humanity, and learning how to live with them. We have to face and value eco-anxiety, Wray argues, before we can conquer the deeply ingrained, widespread reactions of denial and disavowal that have led humanity to this alarming period of ecological decline.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, guidelines, and details.\n\nWhere: Skylight Bookstore\n\nDate: Wednesday the 1st\n\nTime: 7 pm\n\nAddress: 1818 N.

He argues that the history of music during this span was shaped by three major wars of that century: World War I, World War II, and the Cold War.\n\nProbing why so few works have been added to the canon since 1930, Mauceri examines the trajectories of great composers who, following World War I, created voices that were unique and versatile, but superficially simpler. He contends that the fate of composers during World War II is inextricably linked to the political agendas of their respective governments, resulting in the silencing of certain kinds of music in Germany, Italy, and Russia; the exodus of composers to America—especially Hollywood; the return of experimental music—what he calls “the institutional avant-garde”—and offers an answer to why so much of the music Hitler banned is still not played today.

As he tries to honor her memory by saving two young men from a life of crime amid their opioid-ravaged community, he is drawn into a network of villainy that includes a violent former Klansman, a far-from-holy minister, a biker club posing as evangelicals, and a murderer who has been hiding in plain sight.\n\nAaron’s only ally is state police officer Ruby Spotted Horse, a no-nonsense woman who harbors some powerful secrets in her cellar. Despite the air of mystery surrounding her, Ruby is the only one Aaron can trust. That is, until the ghost of Fannie Mae shows up, guiding her father through a tangled web of the present and past and helping him vanquish his foes from both this world and the next.\n\nDrawn from the author’s own life experiences, this story is a devastating exploration of the nature of good and evil and a deeply moving story about the power of love and family.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, link, and event details.\n\nWhere: Vroman’s\n\nDate: Thursday 2nd\n\nTime: 3 pm\n\nAddress: Vroman’s Online (see site)\n\nWebsite: https://www.vromansbookstore.com/james-lee-burke-in-conversation-with-linwood-barclay-discusses-every-cloak-rolled-in-blood\n\nMarcia DeSanctis, with Liz Lippincott, & A Hard Place to Leave, at Pages Bookstore – In-Person Event\n\nJoin us for a wine and cheese reception and to hear author Marcia DeSanctis, in conversation with Liz Lippincott, present and discuss her new book, A Hard Place to Leave.\n\nIn this memoir in essays, the author captures the unrelenting pull between the past and the present, between traveling the world and staying home.\n\nStarting in a dreary Moscow hotel room in 1983, weaving back and forth to rural New England, and ending on a West Texas trail in 2020, Marcia DeSanctis tells stories that span the globe and half a lifetime.
