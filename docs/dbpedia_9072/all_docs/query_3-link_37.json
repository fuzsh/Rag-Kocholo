        "text": "After a successful career, Johnny Cash felt like the world had passed him by. In 1991, Mr. Cash had been dropped by his record company, and his confidence was at an all-time low. He was a comet that had passed in the blink of an eye. But a year later, producer Rick Rubin thought differently. Rick Rubin approached Cash, who at the time was singing at dinner theaters. “I asked him to come to my house and just play me all of his favorite songs from the course of his life, just to get an understanding of who he was. It was a way to musically meet, not based on the music that he made, but what spoke to him.” This was all Johnny Cash really wanted: to be himself. Still, Mr. Cash had no idea why someone like Rick Rubin would want to work with him. Cash was in his 60s, and in his eyes, his career was done. But Rick Rubin saw something else. He said there was something about Johnny Cash, something, \"interesting, beautiful, quiet, and shy about him—brooding and thoughtful.\" Cash put his trust in Rubin and in 1994, on the 81st studio album, named American Recordings, which would go on to be hailed as one of the most significant records in Cash’s long career. Cash had returned, shining brighter than ever. ---------------------------------------------- Sometimes we can’t see our own greatness and we think our time has passed and it becomes easy to fall into self-doubt. If anyone is feeling like their time has passed, know this. Our time will never pass; we will never be a \"has-been.\" You are never done; you evolve. For anyone going through a transition in life, take it one day, one step, one moment at a time. Your dreams are on YOUR timeline. Surround yourself with a team who will help support you and your dreams. And remember to ALWAYS thank your team. Take. Time. It is okay to be where you are. Remember: You don't always have to shine the brightest, you just have to keep the light on.\n\nDrake had a very bad Q2. He picked a rap battle with Kendrick Lamar. He then lost the rap battle. And Kendrick’s diss track 𝘕𝘰𝘵 𝘓𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘜𝘴 became the song of the summer (featured at kids’ birthday parties and European soccer stadiums). But Q3 marked the start of Drake’s comeback. His redemption. The 𝟨 𝘎𝘰𝘥 made his first high-profile experience at Michael Rubin’s famous White Party. With 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗲𝘀 like Tom Brady, Beyonce and Draymond Green, this Gatsby-esque gathering represents the pinnacle of mainstream stardom. But Drake’s presence was marked with an asterisk. The DJs were all instructed to not play any songs by Kendrick Lamar. But can you truly be high-status if you’re scared of getting your feelings a bit hurt? And what great things in your life come with an 𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘴𝘬? 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝘄𝗼 𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗶𝗻 It turns out that Michael Rubin has been offered $5,000,000 for an invite to this coveted party. Which he promptly declined. So, getting the nod must be 𝗮𝗻 𝗼𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘆 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴. No asterisks needed. Sorta like winning the lottery. Objectively good, right? Guess again. 70% end up bankrupt. Others struggle with addiction. You immediately lose privacy. And you’ll never know who truly wants to be your friend. Here’s another example: 𝗯𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲. Now you’d think that a supermodel glides through life with ease thanks to their beauty. But they too have a plethora of internal struggles. Peers automatically presume that they’re stupid. Envy of their attractiveness can make people jealous and hostile. Not to mention the incessant fear that one day, looks will inevitably fade. So is it possible that The White Party, winning the lottery and being hot are all accompanied by some existential angst? https://lnkd.in/gNhhKekv\n\nIt’s been two months since I resigned from my position as CEO of Money Positive Silver. Founding a startup is a hard thing; a rollercoaster of high highs, low lows, and sharp turns (pivots). I was challenged to lean into vulnerability and break free from the trap of perfectionism. A recurrent theme was that I should spend my efforts becoming more effective at responding to change, rather than foolishly trying to predict the future. In the space between forecasting and foreshadowing, intuition resides. Fortunately, in my career I’ve had the privilege to choose hard things; choices that inevitably allowed me to recognize when hard things are sneaking up on me. Quitting a startup is a hard thing, especially when it sneaks up on you. Burnout by Emily Nagoski & Amelia Nagoski gave me permission to soften when confronted hard things. These genius sisters decode the stress response cycle with unparalleled clarity and precision. The section on redefining failure was particularly transformative for me. While deeply lost in my own stress cycle, their powerful lessons guided me to safety. To paraphrase Burnout… Reframing failure is the most demanding form of positive reappraisal, and none of it takes away the pain of failure and loss. Part of recovering from a loss is turning toward your grief with kindness and compassion, but another part is recognizing the unintended positive outcomes. We live in a culture that values persistence and have been taught that letting go of a goal is the same as failing. However, “women’s difficulty is rarely lack of persistence – on the contrary. We stand gazing at the possibilities of what the world can be– what we can be… But there is a deep, wide chasm between us and the realization of those possibilities. Our default action… is to do whatever it takes to get to the other side, and keep on doing it, no matter what, until we get there. But then we get exhausted and we wonder if we can accomplish any of the things we hope for, without destroying ourselves in the process. We ask ourselves if it’s time to quit. There is a point where our internal monitor switches its assessment of your goal from “attainable” to “unobtainable” and we simply hear a voice inside of us saying, “You’ve done all you can here. It’s time to move on.” Humans, especially women, have an extraordinary capacity to ignore this voice. I listen to this voice. My intuition. It keeps me safe when I choose hard things. It’s no surprise that when nurses rely on their intuition and use it as a support in decision-making, it increases the quality and safety of patient care. I have no doubt that relying on intuition as a support in my decision-making has increased the quality and safety of my self-care. This book was pivotal in my return to the bedside, enlightened with fresh perspective, empowered by hindsight, and energized for innovative solutions in geriatric care. My intuition tells me the Nagoski sisters can help you, too! Happy Thanksgiving, y’all!\n\n\"The Will to Rise Again\" I grew up with the Fresh Prince – the TV show, the music, the movies, all of it. I’d heard good things about, Will, Will Smith’s autobiography and I wasn’t disappointed. There were lots of great stories and lessons from his life. I was ready to give this five stars until a disappointing ending. More on that in a minute. But first, two thoughts on the two most interesting aspects of the book (to me). One. I was fascinated by his implosion following his first album which generated a Grammy award for DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. They squandered their fame and the follow-up album was a bomb that had Smith broke and out of work. Ultimately, he got a second shot at stardom with the Fresh Prince of Bel Aire and the rest is history (biography). My first thought about that rise, fall, and rise, was that I didn’t know about that despite the fact that I was a consumer of his music, TV, and film career. Which prompted the second thought: what if that fall had happened today? The only thing the media – especially celebrity gossip media – loves more than a fast rise to fame is a precipitous fall. If Smith’s fall had come 20 years later like, say, oh, I don’t know, Wesley Snipes, would there have been a quick return to fame or would Smith’s reputation have spent a decade or more to recover? The second was the constant back-and-forth in his life between pushing himself and everyone around him (including his family) to success and being satisfied with where he was in life. Ed Mylett calls this “blissful dissatisfaction” and it’s followed me my entire life. Behind Smith’s fame was a constant striving for more, a trait that he was likely born with (he’s got to be an Enneagram three) and was definitely cultivated by his intense (tyrannical) father. I was constantly enjoying this book, even in the presence of a consistent stream of F bombs (an Amazon search came up with 63), which might reveal as much the influence of his co-author Mark Manson, best know for The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life. Then, we got to the end. After all the fascinating steps in his life and career, the emptiness at the top and bottom of fame, he finds redemption in maybe the most stereotypical modern Hollywood star “soul-searching.” It would be like me writing this breathless history of the twists and turns in my life only to end with finding truth in the Bible (as someone who reads the Bible nearly every day of my life). It just fell a little flat for me. But that doesn’t erase the many life lessons and interesting stories in the book. I still recommend the 16 hours of listening. Just don’t hold your breath for a plot twist at the end. #nsbook\n\nIn 2005, comedian Dave Chappelle walked away from a $50-million contract. He explains why years later: \"I watched one of these nature shows one time. And they were talking about how a bushman finds water when it’s scarce. And they do what’s called a salt trap. . . Apparently baboons love salt. So they put a lump of salt in a hole and they wait for the baboon.\" \"The baboon comes, sticks his hand in the hole, grabs the salt. The salt makes his hand bigger and he’s trapped. He can’t get his hand out. Now, if he’s smart, all he does is let go of the salt. Baboon doesn’t want to let go of the salt. Then the bushman just comes, takes the baboon, throws them in the cage and gives them all the salt he wants. And then the baboon gets thirsty. The bush man lets him out of the cage. The first place the baboon runs to is water. The bushman follows them and they both drink to their fill. In that analogy, I felt like the baboon. But I was smart enough to let go of the salt.\" Most of us are not. In fact, most of us don’t even know we’re holding on to the salt in the first place. We're trapped by the desire for something more: A bigger salary. A nicer apartment. A shinier car. But when we do get more, when our dreams become our everyday reality, we still feel unhappy. “Psychologists sometimes refer to this concept as the ‘hedonic treadmill,’” explains Mark Manson, “the idea that we’re always working hard to change our life situation, but we actually never feel very different.” We may even be well aware we’re chasing things we don’t need, spending our days doing things we don’t like. Yet we can’t stop. We can’t let go of this seemingly insatiable hunger despite knowing what it does to us. What we need is courage: The courage to be happy here and now. The courage to let go of the salt. --- Notes: •The Dave Chappelle quote: https://lnkd.in/eMUxtmgk •The Mark Manson quote: The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson --- Are you looking to improve your mental performance?

You’re worried about saying the wrong things. Even if you won’t ever admit it. But you aren’t wrong. Secretly, deep down inside, it’s a very normal and natural thing to worry about offending others. Every culture on Earth has its own unique set of norms and guidelines on how to avoid offending others. And how to offend other people, in situations that supposedly call for it. I believe causing offense has its place in the world. But only as a counter to unsettle and disrupt those who already cause offense. Those who already wield outsized amounts of power. Offense should be used to tear down the powerful, not used to continue upholding unjust power structures. In some cultures, burping at the dinner table is a sign of satisfaction, gratitude, and respect for the person that prepared the meal. But in the USA, generally speaking we don’t do that. We have a shared cultural norm and an unspoken expectation that we will not knowingly cause offense to one another. So even those who have too much pride to admit it. They also care about not offending people. They may care about prioritizing certain groups of people who deserve protection from offense more than others. But nearly everyone universally holds a shared value that offending others is generally something we should strive to avoid. You don’t have to go on a racist rant to cause harm. Oftentimes, people cause harm and offense in other ways. No racist ranting required. When something like this happens though, this is the correct way to handle it. Whoever advised him to do damage control was giving him outdated and terrible advice. Even 18 years ago, he had the foresight to know that was not the correct way to proceed. Doing the painful internal work is the only answer. Don’t expect forgiveness. Don’t plan a comeback. Think of those who have always been excluded. Take action to ensure they are included. Use your privilege to destroy unjust systems. Some people will forgive you. Some won’t. Your comeback isn’t about you. It’s about the community you help build. The power you help distribute and equalize. The results people can accomplish together when we aren’t held back by artificial constraints such as bigotry. You can’t do damage control. The damage has been done. The only damage control that’s ever worth doing is sincere, deep, internal healing work. Everything else is just fluff. #Communications #Bigotry #DamageControl https://lnkd.in/e95V9gxS\n\nI felt compelled to say something about the Ray/Bridgewater book because of my connection to the place and people in it. Many of you know I’ve worked closely with Ray for well over a decade. I laughed at the Axios headline this week that said “pity anybody who ever had to work for Ray.” I’ve never thought it something deserving of pity…well, maybe some days ;) The book contains many outright falsehoods (to the degree it’s hard to think they aren’t intentional) and stories that, even when they did occur in some form, are told in a completely slanted and biased way. But what’s most important is that the “characters” themselves - many of whom I’ve known well for a long time - are unrecognizable. Bridgewater was/is not a place for everyone, and there is a compelling story that could have been written about the events during the period that would be fair, interesting, and balanced - but not uncontroversial! A fair book would be a provocative and insightful picture into an organization full of people trying thoughtfully - and at various times succeeding or failing - to do things in a unique way which some people would see as clearly connected to its unique success (as I do) and some might think is “crazy.” This bad faith caricature isn’t that. To that extent, it’s not only a misleading portrait, but also a shame because it’s so unilluminating. Reading it, you’d never guess that there are many thousands of people who had overwhelmingly positive experiences at Bridgewater. Not one of these perspectives is in the book. The worst part is it’s a highly inaccurate portrayal of good people. Of those people, about Ray specifically - the idea that Ray is different inside Bridgewater than the person he portrays on the outside, which is the thesis of the book, could not be further from the truth. Ray is both a wonderful and challenging person to work for largely because he is extremely, almost compulsively, consistent. He’s honest and uncompromising AS WELL AS caring and generous in equal extremes. He sometimes doesn’t listen well and can be frustrating to engage with, but he has a genuine desire to see the world as objectively as possible and always wants to hear others’ perspectives, which doesn’t mean he’ll always agree with them. In the end, he really is after meaningful work and meaningful relationships. The amount of time he spent (and still spends) asking for perspective and criticism from—and engaging with and openly debating—employees of all levels, even the most junior, was almost ridiculous. This sort of culture is reflected in the number of people who came to Bridgewater out of college, had a great learning experience, and went on to become successful entrepreneurs themselves. The people that matter and know Ray and Bridgewater know this reality. But for those who don’t know it, you can hear it from at least one very informed source (me).\n\nIt's the boldness for me from Matthew This is to everyone I have asked to follow me into the world unknown trying to solve a problem the world is facing, never knowing what will come out of it. This is to everyone on the team that left their comfort space to work on TECXE This is to every founders, co-founders and team members that have had sleepless night trying to ideate, prototype and launch their products. This story teaches us three things here; 1. If you are the seer, don't let what people say discourage you, at the very least you are seeing what they are not. 2. If you want to change the world, take those along that see that world with you, those that are willing to break a neck for it success or else you would only be regretting everything (Note that not everyone gets to enter the promise land, some will talk about it, some will try to get close to it but others will never enter it. The few that would enter it would obviously be the special ones like the 12 disciples of Christ. Learn from Jesus and Matthew story. Lastly, which is the most important, if you see an opportunity my friend do not look back, if it's truly an opportunity especially when it involves helping the world, my friend take it, go out there and transform the world because the gift you have, others have, and if you aren't using it, others will, it's all about who gets there first. I would want to belive you gained value from this short amazing story of our Lord Jesus Christ to Matthew who was already a rich man and a man with position but he humbled himself and followed Jesus. Before I forget, for those who would be followers, for the record, remember you are following to lead one day so if you see the opportunity take it, follow that person like a fool because it doesn't matter if you are a fool when you enter the promise land. See how Matthew followed Jesus by giving away everything had for a greater purpose. If you love this story and the post, kindly repost it so others can see. We have a lot to discuss you and I, so kindly connect with me let's have that conversation. I am currently leading a world record team at TECXE and would you be interested to know more about the things we are building, sincerely connect with me. And for those who did be interested in building, growing and scaling their business, we just launched TXN Academy, a business hub that trains you to build, grow and scale your business, and to read more on that TECXE Bye for now.\n\nIf the Kendrick and Drake beef taught us one thing, it’s that everyone has an opinion and that opinion isn’t going to change. I’m a Drake fan. His music has that relentless winner energy that i love. The world was divided in this beef and most of what i read had Kendrick getting the upper hand. I listened to each and every diss track from both. Every time, i would rather listen to Drake than i would Kendrick. But… no matter how good it is, im not going to be able to convince the other side that Drake is better. It’s a waste of breath. It’s a waste of time. Today a friend wrote a post that tagged me in it. Some guy on the internet popped off with an unbased opinion about me and what i offer. As much as id like to lash this person with a verbal ass whoop - it makes zero difference. It might make me feel good in the short term, but i always regret saying anything shortly after. Whether this guy likes my shit or not is completely irrelevant to me and my company. Even if he dissuaded 20 ppl from doing business with me - I’ll still do 2.5 million dollars this month ALONE and have 100s of thrilled customers. Although the Drake, Kendrick beef was great and interesting for fans of Rap - Drake lost as soon as he engaged. He was already on top despite millions of people not liking him or his music. There’s a great lesson in that for business owners. There’s going to be a lot of people who don’t like your shit. If you get big enough there will be a lot of people who take it a step further and talk shit. It’s usually an L as soon as you engage. Because here’s one thing that’s true. Nobody talking shit has done more than you. They’re breaking their necks looking up at you. Don’t break yours looking down at them."
