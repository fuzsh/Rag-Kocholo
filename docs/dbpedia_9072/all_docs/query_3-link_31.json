        "text": "DJ MARY MAC: ICON & PIONEER FOR FEMALE DJ'S; MEMBER, RANSOM REPS DJ's; MEMBER, AMERICA'S MOST WANTED DJ's was introduced to the art of turntables and mixing by her older brother while he practiced daily in the basement of their family's Queens, NY home. Barely a teen, and yet highly intrigued by the techniques of the many notable DJ's of that era, Mary Mac began working diligently to hone and perfect her skills behind the wheels. With a combination of natural talent and passion, she quickly made a name for herself as a sought-after female DJ. Needless to say, this was quite ground-breaking in the predominately male-driven industry.\n\nDuring the early 90's her career was further ignited while attending Mitchell College. As a full-time student, she began spinning for college parties in the area. This earned her the coveted position of Music Director at Eastern Connecticut State University's radio station where she remained for the next two years. Following her reign at the radio station, she began to earn solid credibility. She was soon approached by a Def Jam A&R as she was spinning at a NYC loft party. She was asked to DJ for their newest hip-hop artist [Boss]. This is the position that led to her involvement in the nationwide Phat Jam Tour, which featured Def Jam recording artists Run DMC, Redman, and Onyx. DJ Mary Mac and [Boss] opened the show for the span of the entire tour which lasted several months. By the mid 90's, she had managed to establish a \"rooted recognition\" which then led her to valuable opportunities that were key in her growth as an artist of the turn-tables.\n\nSince then, Mary has been exclusively requested to play at various national events and celebrity parties offering a seemingly endless and impressive list that includes birthday parties for Whitney Houston, Queen Latifah, MC Lyte and Queen Pen as well as promotional release parties for Cassidy, Fatty Koo, Dead Prez, Hush Magazine, Monica, and Clipse. She has played for artists such as Red Cafe, Black Buddfly, Bad Boy recording artist, Cheri Dennis, J Records, Da Brat, Jimmy Cozier, Teairra Mari', and Robin Thicke. Mary Mac has been featured playing events hosted by Miss Jones, Monie Love, DJ Kid Capri, and America's Next Top Model winner, Eva Pigford and spins annual not for profit Rock Crops. project, hosted by NYC's radio station HOT 97. Mary Mac was the requested DJ to play for the \"Tribute to Luther Vandross\" event. She played for the Brooklyn Museum and blazed the tables at Kimora Lee Simmons' launch party for the \"Beautiful\" fragrance. DJ Mary Mac has spun with the likes of DJ Enuff, Funkmaster Flex, DJ Mr. C, DJ Spindarella, DJ Clue, DJ S&S, DJ Jazzy Joyce, DJ Mad Links and several other recognized DJs in the industry. Of the many tours that Mary Mac has been included on, she also was invited to do the Grey Goose Tour which featured Lady May, Lil John, Bone Thugs & Harmony, and 8 Ball w/MJG. In addition, she has made several cameo appearances in publication and on television: VIBE Magazine, The Fox 5 comedy show \"In Living Colour\", The Rosie O' Donnell Show with Queen Latifah, and Rap City's \"In Tha Basement\". Radio also loves the premier DJ Mary Mac, in addition to being a regular on 91.9 FM's \"Next-Up\" radio, she is one of Wendy Williams' favorite DJs and was invited to spin on her nationally-syndicated show- The Wendy Williams Experience on New York's own 107.5 WBLS. Wendy also chose Mary Mac to deliver her talent for the benefit of the AIDS-A-Thon marathon.\n\nDJ Mary Mac strives to remain on top of her game and continues to secure her position as a \"premier DJ\" while playing at some of NYC's most popular venues such as Joe's Pub, Club Exit, Lotus, the legendary Club Shelter, Lovergirl, The Puma Store, Fashion 40, Taj, Crobar, PM, Club Show, and the list goes on. However, her limitless talent and magnetic personality has also taken her to around the globe. DJ Mary Mac received the opportunity to take her talent overseas. She delivered memorable performances and rave reviews in China when she was asked to play at China's exclusive Club NY. Mary Mac has played in Los Angeles, Houston, Baltimore, Honolulu, Mimi, Las Vegas, Washington DC, and Atlanta to name a few. Mary's affinity for music combined with her passion for the turn tables has enabled her to achieve success as well as longevity. Determination and commitment have driven Mary to expand her horizons into songwriting and producing, releasing and album under alias \"DJ Predator\" in collaboration with recording artist Romananthony, in the UK [titled \"Phatt Life featuring recording artist Phatt PussyCat] on the Scotland record label, Glascow Records. Mary Mac has also a documentary to her credit [be on the lookout for \"MISTRESS X: THE MOVIE\"]. She is consistently exemplifying her role as a pioneer for female DJs and aggressively paves a path for the next generation of female DJs. It is truly just a matter of time before the world is awakened by the full impact of DJ Mary Mac..... the international premier female DJ!"
