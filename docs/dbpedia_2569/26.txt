Katherine Jenkins

Welsh mezzo-soprano

Katherine Jenkins (born June 29, 1980, Neath, Glamorgan, Wales) is a Welsh mezzo-soprano with strong mainstream appeal. A highly versatile singer, Jenkins excels not only with opera and hymns but also with Welsh folk music, show tunes, and pop songs. In 2020, Classic FM, one of the United Kingdom’s Independent National Radio stations, named Katherine Jenkins as the best-selling classical albums artist of the 21st century.

Early life and education

Jenkins began studying piano and singing at age 7 in a local church choir. In the 1990s she was a member of both the Royal School of Church Music Cathedral Singers and the National Youth Choir of Wales. At age 17 she earned a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London, where she performed in operas while studying foreign languages. After graduating with honors, she continued to perform in operas while also teaching voice and working as a fashion model.

Breakthrough

Jenkins’s public profile grew in 2003 when she performed at London’s Westminster Cathedral at a celebration of Pope John Paul II’s silver jubilee. That year she signed a recording contract, and her debut album, Premiere, was released in 2004. A mix of classical favorites and traditional Welsh songs, it went to number one on Britain’s classical album music chart. It was followed quickly by Second Nature (2004), which likewise topped the classical album chart and also reached the top 20 on Britain’s pop chart. That album and its successor, Living a Dream (2005), earned Jenkins two straight Classical BRIT (British Record Industry Trust) Awards for album of the year. Living a Dream features an Italian-language version of the Dolly Parton song “I Will Always Love You” alongside arias and other classical material. The albums Serenade (2006) and Rejoice (2007), like Living a Dream, were number one on Britain’s classical albums chart and also reached the top 5 on Britain’s pop chart.

Albums from the 2010s and 2020

Jenkins made her most pop-oriented album to date with Believe (2009), which features versions of songs by the likes of Bob Marley, Queen, and Sarah McLachlan. Her albums from the 2010s include Daydream (2011), Home Sweet Home (2014), and Celebration (2016). The last, released at the time of Queen Elizabeth II’s 90th birthday, features a version of the British national anthem, “God Save the Queen,” along with other patriotic songs. Jenkins finished the decade with Guiding Light (2018). The album includes “Xander’s Song,” a ballad dedicated to her second child, son Xander Levitas (born 2018), with husband Andrew Levitas (married 2014), an American film director and artist. Their first child was daughter Aaliyah Levitas (born 2015). Jenkins’s next album was Cinema Paradiso (2020), a collection of memorable songs from such movies as Singin’ in the Rain (1952) and A Star Is Born (2018).

Screen appearances

In addition to making music, Jenkins took on a number of acting roles, including a part in the 2010 Dr. Who Christmas special and a role in the feature film Minamata (2020) alongside Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy. She made a number of television appearances as well, winning second place in the 14th season (2012) of Dancing with the Stars and competing on the first season (2020) of The Masked Singer UK.

Charities, recognition, and memoir

Jenkins has been recognized for her charitable efforts. In 2013 she ran the London Marathon to raise money for the Macmillan Cancer Support organization. She also made several trips to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries to perform for British troops. In 2014 Jenkins was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her contributions to music and charity. Her autobiography, Time to Say Hello, was published in 2008.
