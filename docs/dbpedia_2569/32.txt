More Info:

Following on from the heady success of albums like PREMIERE, SECOND NATURE, and LIVING A DREAM, Welsh mezzo-soprano and sometime fashion model and music teacher Katherine Jenkins now presents her fourth collection of classically-rendered hymns, arias, and pop classics. SERENADE seems an understated title for someone with such a soaring voice and dynamic range, yet fans will know Jenkins is more than capable of balancing her operatic cartwheels with moments of real tenderness. Katherine Jenkins' fourth studio album Serenade became the number one album on the UK mainstream charts and sold more than 50,000 copies in it's first week of release. This ensured it was the biggest seller for a classical CD in Britain ever. Serenade features one of Katherine's favorite songs of all time, her "classicalised" version of Bryan Adams' "Everything I Do".
