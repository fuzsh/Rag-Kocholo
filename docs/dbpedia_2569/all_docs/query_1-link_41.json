        "text": "Katherine Jenkins has been named as the number one classical music artist of the past 25 years.\n\nThe Neath-born singer has sold more than 2.7 million albums in the Ultimate Classic FM Chart, the “biggest ever countdown of classical music album sales in the UK\" beating off competition from classical singing giants like Pavarotti, Andre Rieu and Andrea Bocelli.\n\nBut she's not the only Welsh classical singer to make the Top 20 of the first-ever countdown of UK classical album sales from the past quarter of a century.\n\nCharlotte Church is the second highest-selling classical star at number 6, despite now moving in a whole new musical direction from her Voice of an Angel days; while Fron Male Voice Choir are two places behind her.\n\nOpera giant Bryn Terfel is at number 10; former boy soprano Aled Jones is in 11th place while composer Karl Jenkins is at number 17.\n\nAnd while she may be the overall top classical star, Katherine can't lay claim to the best-selling classical album of the last 25 years - that honour goes to James Horner's Titanic.\n\nAnd Charlotte Church's Voice of an Angel - released in 1999 when she was just 12 - sold more copies than Katherine's biggest-selling album, Living a Dream.\n\nCompiled by the Official Charts Company based on UK music sales data, the countdown featured 90 compilation albums and 26 film soundtracks.\n\nKatherine said: “I was 12 when Classic FM was launched and I feel like we have grown up together. I listened as a child, so it was a huge moment for me when they first played my song on the radio – and when they announced my first number one, I remember bursting into tears!\n\n“With so many friends and colleagues on the list, to be named the number one artist over Classic FM’s 25 years is something I will treasure always. I hope you can hear the cheering all the way from Neath!”\n\nThe Top 20 best-selling artists\n\n1. Katherine Jenkins\n\n2. Russell Watson\n\n3. André Rieu\n\n4. Andrea Bocelli\n\n5.
