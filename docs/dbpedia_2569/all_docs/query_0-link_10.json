The work of local artist, Nereo Costantini, the sculpture of Juliet was financed by the Lions’ Club of Verona, completed in 1968 and displayed, for the first time, in 1972. Dates are suggestive, and it was presumably in the wake of the success of the Franco Zeffirelli 1968 film version of Romeo and Juliet that the Italian municipality decided to commission its own memorial to Shakespeare’s creation. In so doing, the city authorities showed themselves responsive to a series of artistic rewritings and accretions. For Zeffirelli’s screen statement is but one entry in the continuum of envisionings of Romeo and Juliet, and prior to this the director had worked on Shakespearean stage productions and operatic interpretations. To pinpoint the inspiration for Juliet, then, is to acknowledge adaptations of the classic narrative that function across and through history in an intricately layered fashion. The physical constitution of the sculpture bears witness to the process. In that Juliet’s pose recalls that of Botticelli’s “Venus”, she is represented in terms of celebrated Renaissance art. At the same time, the curved lines of her combined demure and sexualized appearance – one hand rests at her shoulder, and the other holds the hem of her dress – point to an idea of womanhood that is firmly located in the 1960s. Given the multiple artistic contexts in which Juliet operates, it is perhaps appropriate that her face is impassive, even expressionless – devoid of meaning, she becomes instead the canvas, the artistic work, onto which a range of emotions are projected, with the sculpture coming to function as an object of longing, veneration and displacement. Immediately significant as a photographic opportunity – to possess a representation of this representation is a key imperative for the visitor – the sculpture is also a source of talismanic power. Touching Juliet’s right breast guarantees, apparently, luck in love; accordingly, thanks to a ritual that suggests both eroticism and infantilization, one side of the figure has been worn smooth, burnished by the rub of hands. In the wake of the manual friction that attends the sculpture, the dull bronze has been transformed into the semblance of glittering gold, reinforcing a sense of a valuable Shakespearean ancestry and associating Juliet with an idealization of a “golden age”. Certainly, Shakespeare is present in the courtyard of the “Casa di Giulietta”: a plaque with an apt quotation – “But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?” (2.1.44) –\n\n1\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 1\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n2\n\nmark thornton burnett, adrian streete and ramona wray\n\nadorns the wall, and Shakespeare himself appears as a small sculpture – much smaller than that of Juliet – quill at the ready. Despite his facility with writing, Shakespeare the man has been overshadowed by his creation: the products have greater purchase than their originator. The graffiti that covers the walls leading into this courtyard suggests that anyone can be an artist and that the reproduction of Shakespearean genius is within the reach of all, while that effort to communicate discovers itself in more than one register. In particular, the sculpted Juliet is the spur to outpourings of feeling, and attempts to make connections, on a huge scale. On the so-called “Juliet Wall” of the courtyard are posted the numerous letters and missives – to Juliet herself – that request guidance in affairs of the heart. Frozen, as she is, Juliet cannot respond to these appeals; rather, her voice – the ghostly manifestation of her spirit – is ventriloquized by the “Juliet Club”, a fifteen-strong team of local volunteers, supported by the urban oligarchy, who reply to each letter and offer counsel. As part of that initiative, the “Casa di Giulietta” encourages participation in mythography. The dominant ideas – that it is possible to commune with Juliet; that love is female, universal and global; that Shakespeare is there for the asking; and that his Romeo and Juliet can constantly be relived – are picked up in a recent film. Letters to Juliet (dir. Gary Winick, 2010) invests heavily both in a Shakespeare-inspired plot, which works across the world and across time, and in a romantic mystification of the “Casa di Giulietta”. The latter feature announces itself in a mise-en-scène intensely preoccupied with balconies. Nor is Verona’s “Casa di Giulietta” exempt from a Hollywood-like makeover. For all its trappings of anteriority, including a balcony and gothic-style windows, the house and courtyard have a tenuous claim to “authenticity”. True, this was a medieval home owned by the dell Capello family, from whom the Capulet family may have taken their name; it has also been suggested that Giulietta Capello was the basis for Shakespeare’s Juliet. At the same time, a trajectory of faux “pastness” is apparent: the house was extensively renovated – made old – in the 1930s, the culmination of which was the provision of numerous antiquated features, including the balcony, an addition that, ever since, has facilitated the replay of Romeo and Juliet and its famous aubade. In the experience offered at the “Casa di Giulietta” we are sensitized to recreation and reconstruction even as we are also reminded of history and “originality”. No matter that Juliet is a simulacrum or a relatively recent fixture: her name alone legitimates her status as a quasi-spiritual point of reference and visitation, authorizes the touristic circus to which she is linked, and allows for her circulation on a global basis. To enter the courtyard, and to encounter Juliet, is to negotiate multiple expressions of Shakespeare: it is to engage in a phenomenon that looks backwards and forwards and at many points in between. We are invited to trace a route backwards in time to a book (one model of art) by a Renaissance playwright which returns to Italy via a host of European and global adaptations, each one of which casts Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet in its own image. We are simultaneously encouraged to move forwards in time to experience a sculpture (another model of art) whose quasi-mystical influence continues into the here-and-now. And that immersion in the present carries in its train an active involvement in the cultures of tourism, in the bewildering variety of forms of mass communication, in the reproductive turn of postmodernity, and in the acceleration of hyperreality. So it is that Juliet – and Romeo and Juliet – are brought to mind in a conflux of acts of interpretation, appropriation and translation, each of which represents a multiplicity of points of intervention in the play and in the personality known as Shakespeare. The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts follows just such a multi-faceted, ongoing and accumulating movement. It delves into the past in its recovery of the condi-\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 2\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\ntions that enabled Shakespeare’s art and it traverses subsequent centuries, including the present, in detailing the extent to which the plays and poems have been reworked and revitalized in the arts of modernity. This collection understands “the arts” according to a generous franchise. It takes the arts to signify in their visual, literary and performing articulations, and it takes note of multiple creative endeavours and disciplines. The arts are defined as encompassing, variously, publishing, exhibiting, staging, reconstructing and disseminating; they are interpreted in the light of a spectrum of encounters and experiences; and they are embodied in the numerous means through which Shakespeare’s work is communicated. This range of artistic practices has wide historical coverage. The chapters assembled investigate the diverse mechanisms familiar to, and utilized by, Shakespeare in his day. They simultaneously explore how the Bardic name, and its associations, have been either parodied or appropriated from the sixteenth century onwards. Chapters are both surveys and interventions; that is, they make available syntheses of existing knowledge and pursue discrete discussions, debating the state of play in the critical field and suggesting particular applications. In the same way that the book approaches the arts in terms of the variety of their temporal habitations, so does it reflect on regional and international contexts; as far as possible, the book aims to keep local and global frames of reference in focus, with the chapters espousing emergent paradigms and domains that inflect Shakespeare in his manifold artistic guises. None of this is or can claim to be exhaustive or comprehensive; rather, the book offers case-studies for some of the most striking and important manifestations of Shakespeare and the arts and, in so doing, provides unique readings of the Bard’s cultural authority. Shakespeare is distinctive in The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts as a measure of global value, as the sculpture of Juliet may suggest: he also acts as a body of meaning to be adapted in a process that bolsters his legitimating imprimatur across periods and cultures. The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts is divided into six thematic sections designed to open up the differing but complementary dimensions of its subject. The first section, Shakespeare and the Book, takes the book – the First Folio – and looks at its point of departure. In the opening chapter, “Textual Shakespeare”, Sonia Massai reflects on the critical approaches whereby we explain the transmission of Shakespeare’s works from stage to print. Concentrating on the example of King Lear, she argues for the importance of textual and paratextual features, suggesting that editors and publishers have contributed substantially to the shaping and production of Shakespeare as a national icon. Early modern kinds of textual production, she concludes, are enriched by, and can be profitably compared with, the singular dissemination of new kinds of Shakespearean text in modern technology. In “Shakespeare and Poetry”, Peter Holbrook approaches the book in a contrasting way as Shakespeare’s kinship with, and deployment of, poetry. He argues that the various typologies of poetry in Shakespeare are often, surprisingly, treated satirically: poetry is linked to fantasy, to dubious claims, to an alienation from “reality”. There is a fruitful tension in Shakespeare, Holbrook maintains, between the “artful” and the “natural”, and this is taken up interestingly in the work of poets such as Thom Gunn and Ted Hughes, who self-consciously cogitate the virtues of poetry as a communicative idiom. Where Peter Holbrook attends to poetry, Marianne Novy in “Shakespeare and the Novel” looks at prose. Noting the affinity between the novel and drama as generic forms, she reads a range of fiction as laudatory and critical responses to Shakespeare. The discussion, which ranges from George Eliot to Jane Smiley, demonstrates the ways in which Shakespeare in the novel functions as a marker of prestige, an opportunity for irony, an aid to\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 3\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n4\n\nmark thornton burnett, adrian streete and ramona wray\n\ncharacterization, literary shorthand, and an exercise in nostalgia. Turning to Shakespeare, Novy argues, novelists debate both Shakespeare’s uses and his relevance to culture more generally. Taking the adaptive endeavour into a cognate domain, Alexander C. Y. Huang in “Shakespeare and Translation” points up the creativity involved in translating Shakespeare’s plays into a variety of media. He rehearses several theories of translation before moving onto a consideration of specific instances – Asia and Germany – that discover translation as an exciting force for cultural interchange. The role of context, and the significance of genre, are equally assessed in a chapter that theorizes its theme in the light of the localization of globally circulating ideas. It is Shakespeare’s books anthologized that occupy Kate Rumbold in her chapter. In “Shakespeare Anthologized”, she outlines how quoting Shakespeare was a vital element in the elaboration of his reputation. Particularly over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, she writes, the Bard’s imputed characteristics, and relationship to aesthetics and ethics, were reified through the publication of anthologies that cemented his place as a source of use and usefulness. The tradition continues, she concludes, in the construction of Shakespeare as a spokesperson for self-help in the present day. The section ends with David Bevington’s chapter on “Shakespeare and Biography”. Although there has been a glut of recent Shakespearean biographies that have returned to or else uncovered new documentary material about his life, Bevington’s question is whether we can legitimately extract a Shakespearean “real life” from his books. The answer is that there may be sufficient emotional to and fro in the plays, which embraces signature components of maturation, mortality and family, to hint at a material narrative trajectory, although caution should also be exercised, Bevington insists, in proposing strict or immovable parallels. The second section of the volume is concerned with Shakespeare and Music. What music featured in “original” Shakespearean performances? How did music consort with other forms of artistic expression? In what ways has music informed the business of Shakespearean adaptation? These are the issues preoccupying chapters that begin with sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Shakespearean performance and end with his appropriation in twentieth- and twenty-first-century popular culture. In “Shakespeare and Early Modern Music”, Christopher R. Wilson pursues an archaeology of emotions, situations and materials, pinpointing when songs were sung and how, in the plays. He identifies the instruments used, and the meanings attached to them, in a chapter that singles out for comment vocal forms (the madrigal and the ayre), composers and genres as well as the part played by musical references in theatrical production. Continuing the theme of performance, Adrian Streete maps the contours of “Shakespeare and Opera” in the next chapter. Both Hector Berlioz and Giuseppe Verdi were dominant presences in the European obsession with opera in the nineteenth century, he points out, observing that opera itself was an art that raised important issues of authorship and authority. It is nineteenth-century Shakespearean operas like Verdi’s Otello that generally hold sway over twentieth-century works in modern opera houses, Streete notes, a state of affairs that he contextualizes in terms of developments in theatre and broader questions touching upon history and politics. As a related form, orchestral or symphonic music, which Julie Sanders discusses in “Shakespeare and Classical Music”, occupies a no less charged place in the history of Shakespearean transmission and reception. Sanders’ chapter alternates between figures as seemingly removed from each other as Henry Purcell and Hans Werner Henze in addressing, among other kinds of classical music, the sonata, film music and the symphonic poem and in exploring why particular plays are the recurring targets of musical treatment. If\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 4\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nShakespeare’s plays are themselves intricately dependent on music, then it is in musical theatre that they find a peculiarly intriguing expression, as Fran Teague argues in her chapter on “Shakespeare and Musical Theatre”. In the Broadway musical, Teague avers, we encounter a hybrid Shakespearean form, one that brings into play laughter, transgression and burlesque traditions. The musical, too, has counterparts in Shakespeare on film, Teague goes on to establish, and is as deserving of attention as an art with several afterlives in the world community. Shakespeare’s interconnections with music are investigated from another point of view in Rodney Stenning Edgecombe’s chapter on “Shakespeare, Ballet and Dance”. The position here is that Shakespeare’s plays possess proto-balletic dimensions that make them attractive to choreographic interpretation. It is a connection that is in part facilitated by the symbolic complexions of Shakespearean dramaturgy itself, Edgecombe contends, not least in Shakespeare’s comedies, which resemble ballet and the dance in their characteristic drive towards reconciliation and the restoration of order. Adam Hansen reflects on the partnership shared between Shakespeare and popular music in his chapter, maintaining that the dialogic relationship between the two lies at the heart of Shakespeare’s imbrication in musical styles like hip-hop, jazz, country and rap. There is every justification for the intermingling of the dramatist and these various forms, Hansen observes, referencing Shakespeare’s own absorption in balladry as part of a discussion of how reverence and resistance combine with each other in the translation of the plays into alternative aural mediums. The gravitation of Shakespeare to other homes presupposes a pre-existing theatrical point of origin. In the third section, which is entitled Shakespeare on Stage and in Performance, contributors look at the art that is the theatre, attending to what might be thought of as the Bard’s most naturalized habitus. The opening chapter on “Shakespeare and Drama” by Lucy Munro reminds us that Shakespeare adapted is most often Shakespeare adapted theatrically. Munro considers adaptation as product and process, underlining how generic changes and gender switches invariably informed the movement of Shakespeare from his own stage into other stages. Modern dramatic figures such as Mary Lou Rosato and Richard Curtis are illustrative here, as is the increasing prominence of multi-lingual modalities of performance. The bewildering variety of more recent theatrical adaptations of Shakespeare has a correlative in the shifting theatrical environment that Shakespeare himself inhabited. As Edel Lamb notes in her chapter on “Shakespeare and the Renaissance Stage”, the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were a breeding-ground for experimental representational practices at a time when theatre was evolving commercially, professionally and institutionally. The Tempest is the clearest instantiation of the situation, Lamb explains, and a play that abundantly reflects a contemporary explosion of artistic innovation. Quite how Shakespeare became the point of reference for theatrical adaptation is reflected upon by Fiona Ritchie in her chapter on “Shakespeare and the Restoration and Eighteenth-Century Stage”. Shakespeare was not necessarily canonized during the Restoration, she points out. Rather, related to the promulgation of neoclassical ideals, the stress on morality, the rise of the female actress, and the predilection for rewriting dramatic endings so as to suit contemporary taste, Shakespeare became, by the end of the eighteenth century, an alternatively conceived figure, one more in keeping with an incipient bardolatry. By the nineteenth century, as Richard Foulkes states in his chapter on “Shakespeare and the Victorian Stage”, the position of Shakespeare as national icon was more firmly established. Yet that alteration in imaginings of Shakespeare was itself the product of concomitant tensions – a desire to keep Shakespearean performance within\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 5\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n6\n\nmark thornton burnett, adrian streete and ramona wray\n\nthe capital and a move to extend performance into the provinces. At a moment of pictorial staging and actor-managers, acting dynasties wrestled to control the Shakespearean imprimatur in a competition for ownership of the Bard that paradoxically enabled the emergence of the first mass audience. Turning to the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, Christie Carson suggests in “Shakespeare and the Modern Stage” that several associated tendencies can be detected – a cultivation of theatrical “authenticity”, the overtaking of the local by the global, and the application of Shakespeare in projects of local self-definition. Centring on the Globe Theatre, the National Theatre and the RSC, Carson argues that touring and transculturation bode well for future theatrical practice, promising, as they do, mutual learning and interchange. The “local”, in particular, is what interests Andrew James Hartley in his chapter on “Shakespeare and Contemporary Performance Spaces”. His terrain is the US, and his plea is for a regional theatre; as such, his chapter offers a complementary contribution to the discussion, not least in its espousal of the localities of meaning that Shakespearean production creates. To assist discussion, Hartley reminds us of the physical properties of the performance space – acoustics and visual elements, for example – and in so doing proposes a version of Shakespeare which is shifting, surprising and dynamic. Audience, it hardly needs stating, is at the core of any Shakespearean encounter. “Youth” as an actual and potential audience for Shakespeare is the subject of the fourth section of this volume, Shakespeare and Youth Culture. Amy Scott-Douglass’ chapter on “Shakespeare for Children” kicks off: it might be thought, she argues, in a consideration of canonical writers such as the Bowdlers and the Lambs, and non-canonical writers such as Caroline Maxwell and Elizabeth Wright MacAuley, that Shakespeare-inspired literature for children exhibits a clear development from morality to liberalism. This is not the case, Scott-Douglass points out, substituting the more nuanced suggestion that it is primarily venue and application that have changed. What defines a “youthful” audience is a question that animates Kevin J. Wetmore Jr in his chapter. His “Shakespeare and Teenagers” points up the fact that “teenagers” are a modern category, one essentially alien to Shakespeare; as a result, he states, there has been the concomitant rise of the “TeenShake”, a version of Shakespeare directed at teenagers marked as “cool” and an instrument of “empowerment”. The revealing instance, in this connection, is the film of the high-school production of Shakespeare, a genre that, while appealing to a particular consumer, simultaneously mediates the Bard as an abiding locus of value. Any construction of Shakespeare for “youth”, the three contributors to this section agree, is predicated on an educative component. Hence, Michael P. Jensen in his chapter on “Shakespeare and the Comic Book” begins by recalling that comics have ever been envisaged as a pedagogical tool in the teaching of literature. He proceeds by clarifying choices about dialogue and visuals in comics based on Shakespeare’s plays, and he notes the differences and points of contact between comics in their British, American and Japanese incarnations. His final point is that comics constitute vital meditations on Shakespearean significances and that they invite interpretation according to issues of emphasis, distribution and marketing. The comic is a material product and a visual representation. So too, but more obviously, are portraits of Shakespeare, sculptures of Shakespeare and festivals dedicated to Shakespeare – these manifestations of the Bard in the arts are explored in the volume’s fifth section, Shakespeare, Visual and Material Culture. The most familiar likeness of Shakespeare is that by Martin Droeshout: his engraving decorates the opening pages of the 1623 First Folio. In her chapter on “Shakespeare, Portraiture, Painting and Prints”, Erin\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 6\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\nC. Blake discusses the engraving, paying particular attention to the extent to which it has been imitated, mocked and corrected. She also considers a rival likeness, the Chandos portrait, and related imaginings of the dramatist. Her salutary observation is that, in the plethora of images of Shakespeare, we experience not his “actuality” but only ideas and inventions of his appearance. From printed representations to public monuments is a small step. In his chapter on “Shakespeare, Sculpture and the Material Arts”, Balz Engler surveys the numerous statues of Shakespeare – in, for instance, Germany, England and the US – so as to argue that the Bard is both a figure of prestige and a conduit for the cultures of memory. And, in the positions and peregrinations traced by particular sculptures of Shakespeare, he suggests, there are revealing signs of an international rapprochement and reciprocity. Like sculpture, festivals and exhibitions dedicated to Shakespeare fulfilled important social and cultural purposes. In “Shakespeare Exhibition and Festival Culture”, Mark Thornton Burnett identifies six interrelated tendencies which, he argues, have their beginnings in the 1769 Stratford-upon-Avon Jubilee. The impulse to celebrate Shakespeare, Burnett suggests, has a nationalistic dimension, is implicated in cultures of pilgrimage and tourism, is responsive to the significance of the Bard as text, shows sensitivity to history and is educative in the sense that commemoration invariably enjoys an institutional purchase. Different embodiments notwithstanding, he maintains, Shakespearean festivals and exhibitions are characterized by arresting convergences and continuities. In modernity, it is not so much the material expression of Shakespeare that impresses as the media expression. That is, the technologies of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are increasingly the first port of call for any Shakespeare experience. Taking this phenomenon as a framing device, the contributors to the sixth section of the volume, Shakespeare, Media and Culture, address the Shakespeare and media equation from complementary generic and temporal perspectives. “Shakespeare and Silent Film”, Judith Buchanan’s chapter, asks for a reappraisal of Shakespeare in his silent film appearances. Beginning with King John (1899), Buchanan notes that the films of the period are distinctive for encouraging moments of communion and stimulating imaginative effort. A landmark juncture, she suggests, was the point at which practitioners abandoned the stage to embrace new-found confidence in the cinematic medium. The subsequent period of Shakespearean filmmaking, which Anne-Marie Costantini-Cornède explores in her chapter on “Shakespeare on Film, 1930–90”, was hallmarked by richness and variety. The notable auteur figures she identifies include Akira Kurosawa, Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, and the types of film she spotlights for critical attention extend to classical productions, film noirs and picturesque fantasies. For Ramona Wray in “Shakespeare on Film, 1990–2010”, the auteur represents one approach to a complex field; in addition, she suggests, we need to take account of the popularity of particular plays, the use of imaginative conceits, an investment in nostalgia, an immersion in postmodernism and the mechanics of adaptation adequately to explain a discrete and historically bound resurgence in Shakespearean filmmaking. In what is a highly intertextual corpus, she argues, the working practices of Shakespeare on film are migrating from the US and the UK to the newer locations of India and China. As these three contributors pick out key moments of production, so, too, does Stephen Purcell in a chapter on “Shakespeare on Television” that selects the BBC Television Shakespeare of 1978–85, the Animated Tales of 1992–4 and the ShakespeaRetold series of 2005 as decisive conjunctures. Television Shakespeare, he notes, is, like silent cinema, in urgent need of reconsideration. We watch Shakespeare in media; we also hear Shakespeare in media, as Susanne Greenhalgh establishes in her\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 7\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n8\n\nmark thornton burnett, adrian streete and ramona wray\n\nchapter on “Shakespeare and Radio”. Radio Shakespeare, she writes, is an “inter-medial” idiom that, often chiming with celebratory occasions, is a specific kind of engagement and a particular form of aesthetic appreciation with the potential to offer new Shakespeares based on aural virtues. All of these media constructions of Shakespeare have a place in cyberspace. As Michael Best argues in “Shakespeare on the Internet and in Digital Media”, hypertext, the library, the image and video are at home on our computer screens, and in such a way that possibilities for democracy are held in play. Highlighting the interconnections that Shakespeare enables in a rapidly changing environment, Best points towards a politically transformative role for the digital humanities. The digital humanities, in particular, stand as testimony to the transmutations and developments, projects and trajectories, which have overtaken “Shakespeare” since inception. In their graphic display of a mutable Shakespeare, they are surely akin to the sculpture of Juliet in Verona, that expressive instance of, and mute witness to, the continuing traffic of Bardic resurrection. Thus is Shakespeare perpetuated across time, culture and space – extracted from history, reinserted and artistically reanimated – so as to address the flux of contemporary preoccupations and requirements.\n\nNotes 1. We are grateful to Giovanna Tamassia of the “Club de Giulietta” and Michelangelo Cappuccilli of “Verona Tourism” for providing information that assisted us in the writing of the introduction.\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 8\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n1\n\nTEXTUAL SHAKESPEARE Sonia Massai\n\nW\n\nriting about the advent of print technologies and cultures in early modern England, Stephen Orgel argues that “the translation of manuscripts into print constituted the inauguration of an English literary canon” and that “the great originary figures are not Chaucer, Gower [and] Langland . . . but the first editors and publishers, Caxton, Pynson [and] Wynkyn de Worde” (Orgel, 2009, 517). This essay shows that Shakespeare’s early printers and publishers, commonly known as “stationers” in the early modern period, followed by a long line of editors and prestigious publishers from the eighteenth century to the present, have also shaped what and how we mean by “Shakespeare”. The initial transmission of Shakespeare’s dramatic works from theatrical manuscripts into printed playbooks and their frequent retransmission into different types of editions since then have anticipated critical approaches and made available the texts then used by subsequent generations of readers, translators and theatre practitioners. Even more crucially, the vast amount of scholarly and commercial efforts invested in the reproduction of Shakespeare in print has not merely preserved but rather contributed to fashion the myth of Shakespeare as a literary and cultural icon. The realization that literary value is as much culturally determined as it is connected to specific artistic qualities – vision, technique, ingenuity and novelty, among others – might seem more in keeping with mid- to late-twentieth-century theories of culture and cultural production than with an earlier, more positivist endorsement of Shakespeare’s intrinsic greatness and his universal appeal. However, even Shakespeare’s early editors seem to have appreciated the extent to which they were moulding rather than merely transmitting Shakespeare through the medium of print. As early as the mid-eighteenth century, Samuel Johnson, one of Shakespeare’s most discriminating readers and editors, used a memorable architectural metaphor to explain the impact of textual scholarship and the editorial tradition on the establishment of the Shakespeare myth: Of the first building that was raised, it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square, but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time. The Pythagorean scale of numbers was at once discovered to be perfect; but the poems of Homer we yet know not to transcend the common limits of human intelligence, but by remarking, that nation after nation, and century after century, has been able to do little more than transpose his incidents, new name his characters, and paraphrase his sentiments . . . It must [then] be at last confessed, that as we owe\n\n11\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 11\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n12\n\nsonia massai every thing to [Shakespeare], he owes something to us; that, if much of his praise is paid by perception and judgement, much is likewise given by custom and veneration. (Johnson, 1765, I, vi–vii)\n\nAlso worth stressing is the significant role accorded by Johnson’s associate and collaborator, George Steevens, to the third and last member of the Tonson family, the most influential publishers of Shakespeare’s works in the eighteenth century. Steevens explains “with great regret” that the death of Jacob Tonson (1714–1767) will perhaps affect not only the works of Shakespeare, but of many other writers . . . He was the last commercial name of a family which will be long remembered; and if Horace thought it not improper to convey the SOSII to posterity; if rhetoric suffered no dishonour from Quintilian’s dedication to TRYPHO; let it not be thought that we disgrace Shakespeare, by appending to his works the name of TONSON. (Steevens, 1773, I, 78–9) This essay accordingly discusses those editors and publishers who played a formative and influential role in the establishment of Shakespeare in print by focusing on a selection of influential editions of the complete works. I chose to write about editions of the complete works because they redefine the significance of the entire body of Shakespeare’s textual remains more explicitly than other types of editions, such as single-text, performance or school editions. This essay will also illustrate the impact of different editorial approaches on the text of Shakespeare by discussing the range and type of variant readings introduced by subsequent generations of editors in a short sample scene in King Lear (generally marked as 3.6 in modern editions). As well as paying attention to the often minute changes undergone by Shakespeare’s text over time and to the scholarly debate generated by conflicting editorial approaches, this essay will consider the different strategies used by different editors and publishers to present Shakespeare’s text to their readers, including the size and content of the critical and textual apparatus, the size and format of individual volumes, the layout of the text and the balance between textual and paratextual features, or mise-en-page. Rather than simply ushering in the reader, the paratext in the Shakespeare editions discussed in this essay has a transformative effect on the reading experience: some editors hide their labour by presenting Shakespeare’s text unencumbered by notes and glosses; others expect their readers to divide their attention between the apparently linear stability of Shakespeare’s text and the often overwhelming amount of variation, emendation and conjecture recorded in their swelling commentaries that rise from the bottom of the page, leaving little space for a few lines of text stranded at the top. The first section of this essay will show that even the earliest publishers of Shakespeare’s works were acutely aware of the impact of the textual and paratextual features of their editions on their readers. The central section will trace the impact of the rise of a scholarly editorial tradition on the transmission of Shakespeare in print from the early eighteenth century to the late twentieth century. Finally, a brief conclusion will identify current editorial trends and reflect on how such trends will inform future encounters with “textual Shakespeare”.\n\n“Playing the Midwife’s Part”: Shakespeare’s First Editors Starting from the early eighteenth century, Shakespeare scholars and editors gave disheartening accounts of how the texts of his plays were first committed to the press. The\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 12\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\ntextual shakespeare\n\n13\n\nEnglish language had undergone significant changes by then and the apparent lack of regularity in spelling and syntax, as well as the lack of stylistic decorum, were blamed on the carelessness of Shakespeare’s printers and the interpolation of spurious materials spoken by the actors in performance and then added to memorially-reconstructed versions of the texts used as printer’s copy in the printing house. Alexander Pope, who published his edition of Shakespeare’s works in 1725, condemned the “blunders and illiteracies of the first Publishers of his works”: In these editions their ignorance shines almost in every page; nothing is more common than Actus tertia. Exit Omnes. Enter three Witches solus. Their French is as bad as their Latin, both in construction and spelling: Their very Welsh is false. (Pope, 1725, I, xiv) The next editor of Shakespeare, Lewis Theobald, attacked Pope’s editorial methods but shared his views about the “maim’d and deform’d” quality of the early editions (Theobald, 1733, I, xxxiv). Like Pope, Theobald understood theatrical and textual transmission as contamination and was particularly harsh in his assessment of the impact of Shakespeare’s actors on the quality of the text preserved in the early editions. Writing specifically about the First Folio edition of Shakespeare’s dramatic works published in 1623 (henceforth F1), Theobald complained that [w]hen the Players took upon them to publish his Works intire, every Theatre was ransack’d to supply the Copy; and Parts collected which had gone thro’ as many changes as Performers, either from Mutilations or Additions made to them. Hence we derive many Chasms and Incoherences in the Sense and Matter. Scenes were frequently transposed, and shuffled out of their true Place, to humour the Caprice or suppos’d Convenience of some particular Actor. (Theobald, 1733, I, xxxviii) Recent scholarship has reversed these views by demonstrating that dramatic copy was routinely if lightly annotated for the press (Massai, 2007) and that early modern stationers invested time, money and intellectual effort in the publication of plays originally written for the commercial stage (Lesser, 2004; McCullough, 2008). More generally, a more informed understanding of the conditions of theatrical production in early modern playhouses has led scholars and textual editors to argue that early modern dramatic authorship was inherently collaborative and that dramatists like Shakespeare relied on their actors and their stationers to realize and perfect their plays on the stage and on the page (Peters, 2000; Orgel, 2006). In keeping with this paradigmatic shift in our assessment of the impact of early modern theatrical and textual cultures on the fashioning of Shakespeare in print, Lukas Erne compares the act of committing his play to print under Shakespeare’s patronym to midwifery: If we consider the suddenness and the frequency with which Shakespeare’s name appears on title pages of printed playbooks from 1598 to 1600, it is no exaggeration to say that in one sense, “Shakespeare”, author of dramatic texts, was born in the space of two or three years at the end of the sixteenth century. (Erne, 2003, 63) Whether understood as formative or deforming, the influence of Shakespeare’s first printers and editors cannot be underestimated and is worth considering in more detail in order to get a better sense of how “textual Shakespeare” started to be constructed in the author’s own lifetime.\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 13\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n14\n\nsonia massai\n\nThe sample scene discussed throughout this essay was first published as part of “M. William Shak-speare: HIS True Chronicle Historie of the life and death of King LEAR and his three Daughters”, a slim pamphlet printed by Nicholas Okes for Nathaniel Butter in 1608 (STC 22292). This version of King Lear is also known as the First Quarto (Q1) because of its format – the text was printed on both sides of a sheet of paper, which was then folded twice, thus producing four leaves (hence the name “quarto”) and eight sides, or pages. Shakespeare’s name is the most prominent feature on the title page of Q1 King Lear (Fig. 1.1). The prominence accorded to Shakespeare’s name is significant because, while it certainly started to be included more systematically on the title-pages of the playbooks printed in and after 1598, it was still omitted from some plays, including, for example, and astonishingly enough, Romeo and Juliet, which was never attributed to Shakespeare in print during his lifetime. Nathaniel Butter, who had invested capital to purchase the manuscript copy of the play and to hire the printer who then set the “True Chronicle Historie of the life and death of King LEAR” to type, must have regarded Shakespeare’s name as a good selling point, even more powerful than the royal favour accorded to the play when it was staged “before the Kings Maiestie at Whitehall” on 26 December 1606, as recorded further down the title-page. Despite the prominence accorded to Shakespeare’s name on its titlepage, Q1 includes no further paratext to advertise Shakespeare’s authorship. Furthermore, the fact that none of the early editions of Shakespeare’s plays includes a dedication or an address to the reader signed by the author would seem to suggest that Shakespeare was never directly involved in the process of transmission of his theatrical manuscripts into print and that the early editions of his dramatic works are the product of his stationers’ craft and entrepreneurship. In making such a claim, I depart from Lukas Erne’s theory that Shakespeare and/or his company were the main drivers behind the publication of his dramatic works during his lifetime (Erne, 2003, 78–114; Massai, 2009, 1–11). The text of the sample scene itself is unmarked – Q1 is printed without act and scene divisions – and consists of ninety-three lines of dialogue, inconsistently set up as prose and verse over three pages (from signature G3v to signature G4v) (Fig. 1.2). This section of the play is also informally known as the trial scene, because forty-three lines of the dialogue as set in Q1 (from G3v line 29 to G4r line 35) are taken up by the imaginary trial set up by Lear to try his elder daughters, Goneril and Regan, who, having sworn their allegiance to Lear and inherited his kingdom as a result, have driven him mad by refusing to obey and honour him as a king and as a father. The stage directions are sparse, and the text of the dialogue includes some obscurities that would later attract the attention of several generations of editors and textual scholars, including the list of dogs named by Edgar as Poor Tom at G4r line 30 – “Mastife, gray hou[n]d, mungril, grim-hou[n]d, or spaniel, brach or him” (my emphasis) – or his puzzling appeal at G3v line 36 – “come ore the broome Bessy to mee”. Despite these minor cruxes, the text of this scene is otherwise coherent and was offered to Shakespeare’s early readers as a slim, unbound pamphlet for the modest amount of 6d [pence] (Blayney, 1997, 411). Another version of Q1 was reprinted in 1619 for Thomas Pavier (STC 22293), although the title-page of this later edition reproduces fairly accurately the original title-page, including its original date of publication. Pavier has been universally reviled by Shakespearean scholars and textual editors as an unscrupulous fraudster since W. W. Greg first established in a seminal essay published in 1908 that he had also published nine other Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean plays in 1619 and had attributed them all to Shakespeare, using fake imprints in six of them (Greg, 1908, 113–31). However, as I have\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 14\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\ntextual shakespeare\n\n15\n\nFigure 1.1: Title page of the First Quarto edition of King Lear (1608, STC 22292)\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 15\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n16\n\nsonia massai Enter Gloster and Lear, Kent, Foole, and Tom.\n\nGlost.

Internal evidence indicates that Pavier had in fact planned to publish the first collected edition of Shakespeare’s dramatic works. Significant in this respect is the fact that the first three plays reprinted by Pavier – The Whole Contention (now normally referred to as 2 & 3 Henry VI) and Pericles – had continuous signatures. Also worth stressing is the sheer amount of effort invested in preparing all ten plays for the press. Pavier’s edition of the “True Chronicle Historie of the life and death of King LEAR” displays a typical level of editorial intervention: it adds or clarifies stage directions and resets fourteen of them by centring them and allowing for extra space before and after them (Massai, 2007, 121–32). That both the “Pavier Quartos” and F1 were printed by William and Isaac Jaggard in turn suggests that Pavier may have changed his plan and used fake imprints in some of his quartos in order to sell them individually or as a nonce collection when the Jaggards realized that they could publish a larger and more upmarket collection of Shakespeare’s plays. When they eventually published the First Folio in 1623, the text of the sample scene discussed in this essay continued to change in ways that had already been anticipated by the Pavier edition of 1619, although the copy from which the Folio version was set clearly differed in several, significant ways from the one originally acquired and then published by Butter in 1608. The sample scene in F1 (1623, STC 22272) is marked as “[Actus Tertius] Scena Sexta” (Fig. 1.3). This scene, as reproduced in F1, is noticeably shorter than its counterpart in Q1: its sixty lines are typically arranged over two columns and take up half of page 299 (signature rr4). Lear’s mad trial is almost entirely omitted, though he is still determined to “Anatomize Regan” and “See what breeds about her heart” (TLN, 2033–4). Although considerably shorter, this scene in F1 includes lines that do not appear in Q1: in F1 the Fool is more prominent and is allowed to correct Lear and answer his own riddle (“whether a madman be a Gentleman, or a Yeoman”, TLN, 2007–8). As in Q1, Lear replies, “A King, a King” (TLN, 2009), but in F1 the Fool adds, “No, he’s a Yeoman, that ha’s a Gentleman to his Sonne: for hee’s a mad Yeoman that sees his Sonne a Gentleman before him” (TLN, 2010–12). Similarly, when Lear prepares to leave the stage announcing that he and his companions, Edgar as Poor Tom and the Fool, will “go to Supper i’th’morning”, the latter replies “And Ile go to bed at noone” (TLN, 2042–3). Other changes affect the stage directions: an exit direction, for example, indicates that Gloucester leaves the stage after delivering his opening lines and a slightly earlier entry direction at TLN 2039 gives Gloucester time to enter and join the other characters before he speaks his lines at TLN 2044–5. These changes reinforce the common assumption that at least some of the plays printed in F1 preserve features derived from the acting versions provided by Shakespeare’s fellow actors John Heminge and Henry Condell, who sign the dedication and the address “To the great variety of readers” included in the prefatory materials. Even more visually arresting is a radical change in the running-title at the top of the page from “The Historie of King Lear” to “The Tragedie of King Lear” in F1. The new running title is consistent with\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 17\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n18\n\nsonia massai Scena Sexta. Enter Kent, and Gloucester.\n\nGlou.

These changes are significant and will be discussed again in relation to the different theories advanced by later generations of scholars to account for their origins. However, far more consequential for Shakespeare’s early readers was the new bibliographical context within which the sample scene was placed in F1. King Lear was now available along with thirty-five other plays wholly attributed to Shakespeare in a large and expensive volume, prefaced by an imposing title-page mostly taken up by the Droeshout portrait, a dedication to two prominent courtiers and power-brokers, William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, and his brother Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery, an address to the reader, several dedicatory poems, a list of “The names of the principal actors” who had acted in Shakespeare’s plays and a list of contents, or “Catalogue”. While the name of Shakespeare had been used only once on the title-page of Q1 to promote a cheap pamphlet, Shakespeare in F1 is literally monumentalized as the author and authorizing point of origin of a body of works, which could be purchased unbound for the considerable amount of 1l (£1). The omission of collaborative plays like Pericles and Two Noble Kinsmen and the failure to signal collaboration in plays such as The Life of King Henry the Eighth contributed to efface the material conditions within which Shakespeare lived and worked – as a company man, as a collaborative author, as an actor – and to construct the myth of Shakespeare as a literary genius. As Margreta de Grazia has helpfully explained, the textual and paratextual materials included in F1 presented Shakespeare’s plays as pure and uncontaminated, descending in a straight line from head to hand to papers to the printed copy of the Folio repository, a direct and undefiled line from the conceptions of Shakespeare’s mind to the printed issues of the Folio . . . “Shakespeare” was the name that guaranteed the consanguinity and therefore the coherence of what might otherwise have been no more than a miscellany . . . The diverse functions that led to the production of the Folio – the various stages of scripting, acting, printing, selling, patronage – collapsed into that one name. (de Grazia, 1991, 38–9) Interesting in this respect is the choice of patrons and the appeal to their power to transform and elevate the texts of plays originally written for the commercial stage – mere “trifles” (A2) – into literary works worthy of the appreciation (and custom) of discriminating (and wealthy) readers. “Country hands” may “reach forth milk, cream, fruits, or what they have”, but, as the text of the dedication continues, “the most, though meanest, of things are made more precious when they are dedicated to temples” (A2v). Unlike de Grazia, I believe that the name of Shakespeare alone was not as yet so prestigious as to warrant the publication of his works in such an expensive, and ostentatious format. By dedicating F1 to William and Philip Herbert, those responsible for its publication invoked the protection of and an affiliation to the most influential literary circle at the time, which had attracted dedication from over 250 contemporary authors (Stewart, 2000, 226). Also telling is the use of the verb “to prosecute”, meaning “to continue (with a course of action) with a view to its accomplishment or completion” (OED v. 1a), to express the hope that as the Herbert brothers “prosecuted both [the plays as staged] and their author, living”, they will now “use the like indulgence toward [the plays as printed in F1]” (A2). As I have explained elsewhere, “[b]oth ‘Shakespeare’ and his works are completed, become accomplished, through the transformative power of the two brothers as prosecutors, as parents, to both the plays and their author” (Massai, forthcoming).\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 19\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n20\n\nsonia massai\n\nF1 was reprinted three times during the course of the seventeenth century and views differ as to whether subsequent editions elicited editorial preparation of copy for the press. Most textual scholars still regard the transmission of Shakespeare’s text in the seventeenth century as a process of incremental contamination, even when they are inclined to admit that the printer’s copy was prepared for the press by an intelligent, though anonymous, editor. M. W. Black and M. A. Shaaber, for example, value the intervention of seventeenth-century annotators only when their corrections happen to be supported by the earlier editors, as shown in their discussion of the second Folio (F2): it is remarkable that these seventeenth-century editors, in F2 nearly a hundred years before Pope began the restoration of quarto readings by process of collation, should, by a process of divination alone, so often have worked back to the readings of the quartos. (Black and Shaaber, 1937, 23) What Black and Shaaber overlook is a radical difference in the principles informing editorial practices among these early, anonymous annotators of Shakespeare’s text. While editors from the late eighteenth century onwards have refrained from refining or revising Shakespeare’s language, regarding the restoration of the text as originally intended by its author as the sole, legitimate purpose of their labour, their seventeenth-century predecessors clearly aimed at “perfecting” the text by replacing what they felt to be an obscure or unsatisfactory reading with a better one (Massai, 2007, 1–38). As well as “perfecting” Shakespeare’s text for the press, the agents responsible for the later folios expanded the preliminary materials by adding new dedicatory poems – most notably John Milton’s “An Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W. Shakespeare” in F2 (A5). If the addition of seven new plays, including Pericles, to the second issue of the Third Folio (F3) reflects a desire to enlarge the corpus of Shakespeare’s textual remains, the attention paid to the preliminaries attests to the continuing efforts to elevate Shakespeare’s plays to the status of modern classics, a tendency which survived well into the eighteenth century.\n\n“The Best of our Poets”: The Canonization of Shakespeare in Print Nicholas Rowe’s 1709 edition of Shakespeare’s collected works is normally (and quite rightly) hailed as a milestone because it was edited by a well-known playwright, who explicitly stated the principles informing his editorial method. Rowe was the first editor to argue that, since none of Shakespeare’s manuscripts survives, he had endeavoured to compare “the several [extant] Editions, and [to] give the true Reading as well as [he] could from thence” (Rowe, 1709, I, A2v). However groundbreaking this statement of intent may seem, Rowe continued to work firmly within the editorial tradition established by his seventeenth-century predecessors and very rarely relied on early editions other than F4, which he used as the basis of his own (Mowat, 1988, 97–126; Brockbank, 1985, 717–32). He instead used his expertise as a professional playwright and added lists of dramatis personae, scene locators and necessary stage directions (Mowat, 1994, 314–22). The sample scene is certainly representative of Rowe’s editorial approach – Rowe was, for example, the first editor to signal to his readers that Edgar’s lines “My Tears begin to take his part so much / They mar my Counterfeiting” (Rowe, 1709, V, 2518) should be delivered as an aside. Rowe also continued the work started by the syndicate of stationers who produced F1 to foreground Shakespeare’s authorship by adding the very first “ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE, &c. OF Mr. William Shakespear”. Even more crucially, Rowe added woodcuts specifically\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 20\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\ntextual shakespeare\n\n21\n\nFigure 1.4: Woodcut illustrating King Lear in Nicholas Rowe’s edition of The works of Mr. William Shakespear (1709), vol. 5, p. 2467\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 21\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n22\n\nsonia massai\n\ncommissioned to illustrate key moments in each play. Interestingly, his title-page privileges the description of this edition as “Adorn’d with Cuts” before it specifies that the texts of Shakespeare’s plays had been “Revis’d and Corrected”. Rowe the dramatist must have decided to provide his readers with some visual counterpart or substitute for the pleasure of performance, which is usually unavailable to readers of printed drama. Readers of the sample scene in his edition would have visualized the madness of King Lear and the violence of the elements in a naturalistic setting, against which the characters’ anachronistic wigs and clothing oppose a feeble, if decorous, resistance (Fig. 1.4). More generally, the impetus behind Rowe’s edition would seem to have been commercial, rather than stemming from the sudden need to change the principles informing the editing of Shakespeare. If the comments made by a later editor are anything to go by, “there was [then] a demand for [Shakespeare’s] works, and in a form[at] that was more convenient than the folio’s: in consequence of which, [Rowe] was set to work by the booksellers” (Capell, 1768, I, 15). Rowe may have claimed to present his readers with a more authoritative version of Shakespeare’s plays, but in fact what he offered was an attractive edition of the complete works in a smaller, more manageable format than the earlier folios, with the text of the plays unencumbered by textual notes or glosses and adorned instead with fetching woodcuts and more regular and standardized paratextual features, including act and scene divisions. The tendency to monumentalize rather than to edit Shakespeare systematically continued despite the increasing stress placed on justifying and supporting editorial intervention by means of a thorough collation of the early editions. Alexander Pope, for example, offered the following account of his editorial methods in the preface to his 1725 edition: I have discharg’d the dull duty of an Editor, to my best judgment, with more labour than I expect thanks, with a religious abhorrence of all Innovation, and without any indulgence to my private sense or conjecture. The method taken in this Edition will show it self. The various Readings are fairly put in the margin, so that every one may compare ’em; and those I have prefer’d into the Text are constantly ex fide Codicum, upon authority. The Alternations or Additions which Shakespear himself made, are taken notice of as they occur. (Pope, 1725, I, xxii) A glance at the sample scene shows that Pope did correct Rowe’s text by collating it with Q1 and that he was responsible for the groundbreaking introduction of critical and textual notes underneath Shakespeare’s text (Fig. 1.5). However, as some of his detractors pointed out, Pope, like Rowe before him, had not used the early editions consistently. What Lewis Theobald for example contested in 1726 was Pope’s half-hearted commitment to checking Q1 and to justifying editorial interventions that were not supported by any of the early editions, thus contradicting Pope’s own rationale as quoted above. The textual note at the bottom of the opening of 3.9 [3.6] is representative in informing Pope’s readers that, after Lear’s lines “To have a thousand with red burning spits / Come hizzing in upon ’em”, “[t]here follow in the old edition several speeches in the mad way, which probably were left out by the players, or by Shakespear himself. I shall however insert them here”. Groundbreaking as it is, this textual note did not allow Pope’s readers to establish that he had decided to include only a selection of lines from the mad trial and to exclude two speeches spoken by Kent and Edgar at the end of this scene. Besides criticizing Pope for failing to abide by his own editorial principles, Lewis Theobald described Pope’s edition as “pompous” (Theobald, 1733, I, xxxv), drawing\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 22\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\ntextual shakespeare\n\n23\n\nFigure 1.5: Opening of Act 3, Scene 9 [3.6] and apparatus in Pope’s edition (1725), vol. 3, p. 66 attention to specific bibliographical and typographical features that often go unnoticed. While Rowe’s edition had been published in smaller and manageable octavo volumes, Pope’s edition was printed in a large quarto format and his volumes approximate small folios in size. The text of the plays is generously laid out above short and sparse notes at the bottom of the page. Most conspicuously, parts of the title-page in Pope’s edition are\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 23\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n24\n\nsonia massai\n\nprinted in red ink – a feature which required considerable ingenuity on the part of the printers in the age of the hand-press. Pope the poet seemed as concerned about monumentalizing Shakespeare as the syndicate of stationers who produced F1 and as his immediate predecessor, Nicholas Rowe. Like them, he described Shakespeare as a natural genius: “[t]he Poetry of Shakespear was inspiration indeed”, he writes in his preface; “he is not so much an Imitator, as an Instrument, of Nature; and ’tis not so just to say that he speaks from her, as that she speaks thro’ him” (Pope, 1725, I, 2). The grand setting of Pope’s edition is in keeping with his claim that “[e]very single character in Shakespear is as much as Individual, as those in Life itself” (Pope, 1725, I, 3) and with Pope’s understanding of “Nature” and “Life” mostly in nationalistic terms as the true essence of Englishness: “to enter upon a Criticism upon this Author”, he claims, “would be the best occasion that any just Writer could take, to form the judgement and taste of our nation” (Pope, 1725, I, 1). Pope’s edition also includes a list of subscribers, and it seems quite fitting that the king should feature as the first and foremost among Pope’s select readers. Everything about Pope’s edition suggests the elevation of Shakespeare to the status of national poet; the edition itself is presented to his select and discerning readers as the homage of a great poet to another. Theobald’s edition includes the same list of subscribers, because it was published, like all the other major editions of Shakespeare’s works in the eighteenth century, by the Tonson cartel. However, Theobald’s edition presented itself to its readers as a radically different enterprise. Theobald, like Pope, describes Shakespeare as “our British HOMER”, but he also adds that “Had Homer, or any other admir’d Author, first started into Publick so maim’d and deform’d, we cannot determine whether they had not sunk for ever under the Ignominy of such an ill Appearance” (Theobald, 1733, I, xxxiv). Instead of monumentalizing Shakespeare, Theobald argued vehemently for the need to restore his text by emending it: For the natural Veneration, which we have for him, makes us apt to swallow whatever is given us as his, and set off with Encomiums; and hence we quiet all Suspicions of Depravity. On the contrary, the Censure of so divine an Author sets us upon his Defence; and this produces an exact Scrutiny and Examination, which ends in finding out and discriminating the true from the spurious. (Theobald, 1733, I, xxxvi) The moral register of Theobald’s manifesto was an open attack against the work of his predecessors, and of Pope in particular, who had already been the target of Theobald’s criticism, when the latter published his Shakespeare Restor’d: or, A Specimen of the Many errors as well Committed, or Un-amended, by Mr. Pope in his Late Editions of this Poet in 1726. Theobald referred to editing as “the Science of Criticism” (Theobald, 1733, I, xl) and often used medical similes to advocate informed intervention as its most pressing imperative. In Shakespeare Restor’d, he compared Shakespeare’s text to the body of a patient and the editor to a conscientious physician: Certainly, that Physician would be reckon’d a very unserviceable Member of the Republick, as well as a bad Friend to himself, who would not venture to prescribe to a Patient, because not absolutely sure to cure his Distemper: As, on the other hand, he would be accounted a Man of very indifferent Morals, if he rashly tamper’d with the health and Constitution of his Fellow-Creature, and was bold to try Conclusions only for private Information. The same Thing may be said with regard to Attempts upon Books: We should shew very little Honesty, or Wisdom, to play the Tyrants\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 24\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\ntextual shakespeare\n\n25\n\nwith any Author’s Text; to raze, alter, innovate, and overturn, at all Adventures, and to the utter Detriment of his Sense and Meaning. (Theobald, 1733, I, lv) According to Theobald, Pope had acted as a careless and as an unscrupulous physician, because he had both refrained from emending corrupt passages – he had refused to cure his patient – and tampered unnecessarily with Shakespeare’s text in order to “perfect” it according to his own standards of aesthetic and poetic decorum. In the sample scene Theobald emends the Fool’s answer to his own riddle, by adding “mad” before “yeoman”: “No, he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son: for he’s a mad yeoman, that sees his son a gentleman before him”. Pope had left these lines unaltered, probably because he had failed to check Rowe’s text, which was based on F4, from which “mad” had been accidentally dropped, against F1. Theobald therefore cured the text of the sample scene by careful scrutiny of the earlier copies. Theobald also reinserted all the quarto passages omitted in the folios, and only partially restored by Pope, who, in Theobald’s view, had played “the Tyrant” with Q1. The application of his rationale of informed and systematic engagement with Shakespeare’s text led Theobald to proclaim that his “Emendations [were] so far from being arbitrary or capricious, that They [were] establish’d with a very high Degree of moral Certainty” (Theobald, 1773, I, xlii). Despite Theobald’s recurrent reference to editing as the reformation of textual depravity and as a science, he did rely on conjectural emendation and silently changed the text preserved in the early editions. In the sample scene, he changed Q1’s “sinews” for no apparent reason to “Senses” and his emendation survived, unquestioned, until the Cambridge editors restored the quarto reading in the mid-nineteenth century. Theobald also fell back on the aesthetic principle when he justified his decision to restore the two final speeches spoken by Kent and Edgar in Q1 on the basis of their being “extreamly fine”. “[H]ow absurd”, he added, “would it look for a character of [Edgar’s] Importance to quit the Scene without one Word said.” Rather than justifying the insertion of these two speeches on the ground of a more general theory about the origins of the two different versions of the text from which Q1 and F1 were set, Theobald offered his reader a conflated edition, on the basis of his own sense of what constitutes a fine speech and whether or not a main character should speak last before leaving the stage. Theobald’s “moral” imperative to restore Shakespeare’s text, to emend it systematically by drawing on a comprehensive collation of all extant early editions, and to elucidate obscure passages “by Parallel Passages, and Authorities” (Theobald, 1726, viii) in other works by Shakespeare or by his contemporaries was going to prevail and has informed all major scholarly editions since the end of the eighteenth century. As Simon Jarvis explains: [t]he hostile responses to Pope’s edition were critically motivated by dissent from the idea that editors or writers should be disinterested or gentlemanly, and by an insistence, instead, that they should be informed or qualified specialists. This dissent was linked both to a newly historicist approach to the idea of linguist correctness . . . to an insistence on the importance of detailed bibliographical evaluation . . . [and to] changing attitudes towards the / division and professionalization of literary labour in the eighteenth century. (Jarvis, 1995, 13, 187–8) However, the aesthetic imperative to correct and revise Shakespeare’s language and to monumentalize his works in print was still dominant throughout the eighteenth century.\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 25\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n26\n\nsonia massai\n\nIn 1747, William Warburton was hired by the third member of the Tonson cartel to run the family business, who was also called Jacob and had succeeded Jacob the Elder and his nephew after both died in 1735 and 1736. Warburton had contributed to Theobald’s edition and quarrelled with him because he felt that his work had not been properly acknowledged. Ironically, when Warburton set out on preparing his own edition, he ostensibly corrected Pope’s edition, and both names appeared on its title-page, but he in fact relied heavily on Theobald in order to compensate for Pope’s reliance on no authority other than his own judgement in his effort to improve Shakespeare’s language. In Warburton’s version of the sample scene, he followed Theobald by accepting all the quarto passages the latter had drawn from Q1 and all his main emendations, including “Senses” for Q1’s “sinews”. Subsequent editors remarked on Warburton’s unacknowledged reliance on Theobald. The Cambridge editors, for example, remarked that [t]he excellence of the edition proved to be by no means proportionate to the arrogance of the editor. His text is, indeed, better than Pope’s, inasmuch as he introduced many of Theobald’s restorations and some probable emendations both of his own and of the two editors whom he so unsparingly denounced, but there is no trace whatsoever, so far as we have discovered, of his having collated for himself either the earlier Folios or any of the Quartos. (Clark, Glover and Wright, 1863–6, I, xxxiv) Warburton’s approach to editing Shakespeare’s text was in fact still closer to Pope’s than to Theobald’s, despite his reliance on the latter. Warburton, for example, changed the Fool’s speech in Q1 – “He’s made, that trusts in the tamenes of a Wolfe, a horses health, a boyes loue, or a whores oath” – to read “the heels of a horse”. In a new note added at the bottom of the page, Warburton explained that “[w]ithout a doubt we should read HEELS, i.e. to stand behind him”. When Johnson re-edited this scene for his 1765 edition, he rightly and sensibly noted that “Shakespeare is here speaking not of things maliciously treacherous, but of things uncertain and not durable. A horse is above all animals subject to diseases.” In the introduction to his 1790 edition, Edmund Malone is more generally critical of Warburton’s editorial methods: “[h]is unbounded licence in substituting his own chimerical conceits in the place of the authour’s genuine text, has been so fully shewn by his revisers, that I suppose no critical reader will ever again open his volumes” (Malone, 1790, I, 67). Johnson’s and Malone’s assessments of Warburton’s methods were fair, but they underestimated the influence and the purchasing power of the “aesthetic reader”, namely, of those readers interested in the reputation and status acquired by the received text, repeatedly emended, modernized and often unnecessarily and freely revised by his predecessors. In 1744, the Tonson cartel, who were trying to protect their copyright on Shakespeare’s works, were challenged by the publication of another lavish, monumental edition that included thirty-six newly commissioned illustrations. This edition was prepared by Thomas Hanmer and published under the auspices of the powerful and prestigious Clarendon Press at Oxford University. A far cry from Theobald’s definition of the editorial process as the “Science of Criticism”, the preface in Hanmer’s edition describes his engagement with Shakespeare’s text as “the amusement of his leisure hours” and his aim “to note the obscurities and absurdities introduced into the text, and according to the best of his judgment to restore the genuine sense and purity of it” (Hanmer, 1743–4, I, i, my emphasis). A testimony to Hanmer’s attempt to describe his editorial work not as professional labour but as a gentlemanly pursuit is the absence of any direct attribution of the\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 26\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\ntextual shakespeare\n\n27\n\ntext of the preface (which refers to its editor in the third person) or the editing of the texts of the plays to him. The preface instead refers to “other Gentlemen equally fond of the Author”, who gave Hanmer “their assistance by communicating their observations and conjectures upon difficult passages which had occurred to them” (Hanmer, 1743–4, I, i). This type of editing did not require systematic labour but judgement and was not carried out by a professional who would expect to be remunerated for his labour and for his labour to be protected from plagiarism. Predictably Hanmer used Pope’s, rather than Theobald’s, edition as his source text, overlooking all the quarto passages and the emendations introduced by the latter in 1733. Like Pope, Hanmer often resorted to conjectural emendation, and occasionally proposed readings, which, though not universally accepted, are still regarded by many editors as viable solutions to cruxes in the texts of the early editions. In the sample scene, for example, Hanmer changed the list of dogs named by Edgar/Poor Tom, emending the seemingly nonsensical “him” (Q1) / “Hym” (F1) in the early editions to read “lym”, short for lyme-hound or bloodhound. Edgar’s lines, as they first appeared in Hanmer, “Mastiff, grey-hound, mungril grim, / Hound or spaniel, brache, or lym”, have routinely been adopted by editors since then, though some modern editors prefer to retain “him” as a viable, if unusual, counterpart to “brach”, meaning bitch-hound. And like Pope, Hanmer produced an ostentatious edition, printed in large quarto volumes, adorned with new illustrations, with the text set in a large font and unencumbered by notes. Hanmer was even more explicit in stating that the main aim of his edition was not to “cure” Shakespeare’s text and to offer his readers a genuine, more authoritative version of it, but to celebrate Shakespeare as national poet: Since therefore other nations have taken care to dignify the works of their most celebrated Poets with the fairest impressions beautified with the ornaments of sculpture, well may our Shakespear be thought to deserve no less consideration: and as a fresh acknowledgment hath lately been paid to his merit, and a high regard to his name and memory, by erecting his Statue at a publick expence [Hanmer is alluding to the memorial statue erected in “Poets’ Corner” in Westminster Abbey in 1740]; so it is desired that this new Edition of his works, which hath cost some attention and care, may be looked upon as another small monument designed and dedicated to his honour. (Hanmer, 1743–4, I, v) The desire to revise Shakespeare and to present his works as a national treasure, as a monument, is matched by Hanmer’s efforts to make his text more palatable and immediately comprehensible to eighteenth-century readers. Interestingly, his edition included a glossary aimed at the “generality of Readers” and was therefore ornate and expensive, but not elitist. Hanmer’s edition proved very popular and was reissued with corrections in 1771. By then it had already sold well, even better than Pope’s edition. Even the Cambridge editors, who adopted a professional, systematic approach to the editing of Shakespeare in the mid-nineteenth century, had to admit that “[w]hether . . . from its typographical beauty, or from the plausibility of its new readings, this edition continued in favour, and even rose to the price of 10l. 10s. [10 pounds and 10 shillings] before it was reprinted in 1770–1, while Pope’s in quarto, at the same period sold off at Tong’s sale for 16s. [16 shillings] per copy” (Clark, Glover and Wright, 1863–6, I, xxxii). The popularity of Hanmer’s edition and the aesthetic and typographical priorities that informed it qualify recent teleological accounts of the evolution of Shakespeare in print in the eighteenth century. Marcus Walsh, like Simon Jarvis, detects a progressive inclination\n\nBURNETT PRINT.indd 27\n\n11/08/2011 15:13\n\n28\n\nsonia massai\n\namong eighteenth-century editors to professionalize their approach to Shakespeare and English literature more generally: What is most striking about Pope’s successors is not the lingering tendency to an aesthetic approach, but the extent of the movement towards explanation and emendation based, for the most part, on the assumption that there is an authorial text to be recovered and interpreted. (Walsh, 1997, 132) What Warburton’s reliance on conjectural emendation and the commercial success of Hanmer’s beautiful, monumental edition show is that the aesthetic approach was far from a lingering, residual influence, and that it in fact dogged the efforts of those editors who, like Theobald, had criticized it and were harshly ridiculed and accused of pedantry as a result. Probably conscious of the unresolved tension between these two approaches to Shakespeare’s text, Samuel Johnson was the only editor who successfully positioned himself in the middle: he distanced himself from Pope and Hanmer by claiming that he was not guilty of “refusing the trouble of research, for the ambition of alteration” (Johnson, 1765, I, lxiii), but he also criticized Theobald by explaining that he had been “more careful to protect than to attack” (Johnson, 1765, I, lxiv). Echoing Theobald, but choosing a military rather than a medical simile, he declared that “it is more honourable to save a citizen [an obscure reading], than to kill an enemy [to emend it]” (Johnson, 1765, I, lxiv). As a linguist and as the author of the first historical Dictionary of the English Language (1755), Johnson did gloss several obscure readings instead of emending them or leaving them unexplained. A good example occurs in the sample scene, where Johnson for the first time provided a commentary note for lines that had been highlighted by Warburton as defective and unintelligible. Edgar’s lines, “Mark the high Noises, and thyself bewray, / When false Opinion, whose wrong Thought defiles thee, / In thy just Proof repeals, and reconciles thee”, are re-presented by Johnson to his readers as perfectly intelligible through the following paraphrase: “Attend to the great events that are approaching, and make thyself known when that false opinion now prevailing against thee shall, in consequence of just proof of thy integrity, revoke its erroneous sentence, and recall thee to honour and reconciliation.” Johnson’s propensity to gloss rather than to emend Shakespeare’s text inflated the size of the critical apparatus and on some pages the notes took as much space as the text of the play. However, Johnson was clearly keen to attract both the “critical” and the “aesthetic” reader and urged those who read Shakespeare for the first time to “read every play from the first scene to the last, with utter negligence of all his commentators” (Johnson, 1765, I, lxix). A similar level of restraint can be detected even in one of the most innovative and systematically researched editions in the period. Edward Capell was the first editor to use the early editions, as opposed to the latest version of the received text, as a basis for his own edition. He carefully collated a greater number of ex"
