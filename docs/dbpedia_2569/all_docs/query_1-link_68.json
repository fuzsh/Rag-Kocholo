They join previously announced compere Myleene Klass, opera star performers Nadine Sierra, Isabel Leonard and Luca Micheletti, and choir Crouch End Festival Chorus. The first classical artist to headline in BST Hyde Park’s history, and a 2024 UK exclusive, Bocelli will be joined by The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Michele Spotti. Tickets on sale now, visit www.bst-hydepark.com.\n\nRenowned for her captivating Mezzo Soprano vocals and charismatic stage presence, Katherine Jenkins OBE officially became the world’s most successful Classical singer after she was crowned ‘The Biggest Selling Classical Artist of the Century’ by Classic FM. She further cemented her title by gaining her 14th Classical Number 1 album, with 2020’s Cinema Paradiso – smashing the record books since signing the ‘biggest recording deal in UK classical music history’ at just 22 years old.\n\nWithin months of graduating from the Royal Academy of music, Katherine released her debut album Premiere, which became her first Classical Number 1 album. Six months later her second album, Second Nature, also reached Number 1, and went on to earn Katherine her first Classic BRIT Award for Best Album in 2005. The following year brought Katherine another Classic BRIT award, Album of the Year for Living A Dream.\n\nWith multiple sold-out tours, awards and accolades, as well as invitations to sing for Popes, Presidents and Princes, Katherine is also a firm favourite of the British Royal family, having performed at Jubilees, Coronation concerts, Royal birthday celebrations and more. She was also selected by the BBC to be the first artist to record ‘God Save The King’ for His Majesty, King Charles III.\n\nKatherine Jenkins OBE will grace the Great Oak Stage for the very first time, promising an unforgettable performance – from classical masterpieces to contemporary hits, her diverse repertoire guaranteeing an experience for music lovers far and wide. Join us as we gather under the summer skies for a day of pure musical magic at BST Hyde Park!\n\nRising classical crossover star Matteo Bocelli is blazing a trail, selling out tours in Europe, North America and Australia. From his first appearance on the single ‘Fall On Me’ with his father, Andrea Bocelli, in 2018, to singing a reimagined version of ‘Time To Say Goodbye’ with new composition from Hans Zimmer at this year’s Oscars, Matteo Bocelli’s career has been going from strength to strength. His Night With Matteo tour has sold out world-renowned venues including the Sydney Opera House and the Country Music Hall of Fame. He has opened for musical legend Lionel Richie and sung for His Majesty Charles III and Queen Camilla at the Festival of Remembrance.\n\nIn 2023 he released his debut self-titled album, which includes ‘Chasing Stars’, a touching ballad penned by Ed and Matthew Sheeran. In 2022 Matteo released A Family Christmas, alongside father Andrea and his younger sister, Virginia Bocelli, featuring on a Christmas episode of The Simpsons. Matteo’s tour continues across 2024 with dates in Europe, North and Latin America. He is also the face of Guess Menswear.\n\nMatteo is delighted to be performing with his father once again, this time at BST Hyde Park. Fans have previously seen the pair take to the stage together at London’s O2 Arena, Madison Square Garden and the Hollywood Bowl to name a few.\n\nRecognised as the UK’s most in-demand orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra will join Andrea Bocelli, conducted by Michele Spotti.

Celebrating it here is sure to be unforgettable, in the vast green lung from which London has been drawing breath for hundreds of years, in this park that is the embodiment of a glorious chapter in the history of a nation, of a continent, of a civilization…and also of so much wonderful music that has rung out here, nourishing it in its wake.” – Andrea Bocelli\n\nAndrea Bocelli is the most successful classical artist of all time – he’s performed for Popes, Presidents, Prime Ministers and royalty, sang in many of the greatest concert halls and opera houses, and sold 90 million records. There is no other classical star that comes close – he has a Golden Globe, 7 Classical BRITs and 7 World Music Awards under his belt, plus a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has performed across the world’s most famous venues and for globally significant events, including the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee at Buckingham Palace in 2022 and at the ceremonies of the Olympic Games.\n\nThis special UK exclusive show at BST Hyde Park comes at a milestone year for Bocelli, who celebrates 30 years of his career in 2024. Drawing millions in with his popular crossover appeal, Bocelli has collaborated with iconic opera singers such as Pavarotti as well as a host of A-list pop stars including Ed Sheeran, Ariana Grande, Céline Dion, Tony Bennett, Dua Lipa, and many more. As former BST Hyde Park headliner Céline Dion puts it, “If God had a singing voice, he would sound a lot like Andrea Bocelli.”\n\nOne of the world’s most beloved performers, coming to the very special stage at BST Hyde Park for one night only.

He broke records again on Easter Day 2020, uniting millions around the world with his emotionally charged “Music for Hope” performance from the historic Duomo cathedral in Milan, one of the biggest musical live stream performances of all-time. The broadcast saw 2.8 million peak concurrent viewers – the largest simultaneous audience for a classical live stream in YouTube history.\n\nMusically gifted from birth, Andrea Bocelli is one of the most celebrated singers in modern history. He earned a Bachelor’s degree in Opera Singing from the “G. Puccini” Music Conservatory in La Spezia and a Bachelor’s degree in Law from the University of Pisa, Italy. He was honored by the Italian Republic with a Grande Ufficiale Italian Order of Merit (Grand Officer of the Italian Republic) and he was bestowed the title of Ambassador of the Italian Republic of San Marino.
