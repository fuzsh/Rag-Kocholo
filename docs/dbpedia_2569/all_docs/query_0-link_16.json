An extraordinary run, for an institution that each sinnnier is created, lives for eight weeks, and then disappears — and that has contintied on with its basic fabric intact, since its birth as the living embodiment of Serge Koiissevitzky’s remarkable vision. Though aspects of the Mtisic Center have changed, its core strncttire and informing valnes have not. The TMC is still the only place like it in the world: a center for the exchange of ideas, and creative engagement with music at the highest possible level, that is part of a major symiphony orchestra. For an orchestra to morph, at least in part, into an edticational instittition for eight weeks, and for its members to add the mentoring of yotmg musicians to their already overfilled schedules, is extraordi- nary; btit the interaction between a great, resident symphony orchestra and the gifted musicians of the new generation invigorates the former — through this regnlar infusion of eagerness, enthusiasm, and expectation of excellence — and inspires the latter. A gift to the young becomes a gift to their mentors. In naming Aaron Copland as Director of the TMC, Koussevitzky was making a statement, establishing a philosophy that has been confirmed by every subsequent music director of the BSO and leader of the TMC program — that serious mtisic education begins with music’s creators, and that new work, and the involvement of composers, must be a nattiral and regular part of its activity: not confined to special events here and there, btit as a visceral and continuotis engagement throughout the season, inchiding everyone. Secondly, from the start the overwhelming emphasis of the program has been on collaboration, collegiality, and on good musical citizenship, all of which reach to the dtial goals of eqtiipping individual young musicians in establishing a working life in the profession, balanced by that of working to instire a healthy futtire for the art itself through the ptirsuit of the highest possible musical standards. In reading 75 years of Opening Exercises speeches, one is struck by the consistency of this aspiration, voiced first by Koussevitzky in 1940: “The Berkshire Music Center presents a tmique opporttmity for a stimmer of living and working in music. The Music Center is designed to lay special emphasis upon those aspects of mtisical education concerned with collective performance.” Wliile adapting variotis artistic and logistical aspects of the TMC to the reqtiire- ments and possibilities of the present, we continue to adhere to the principles that formed its foundation, and that have been so very successful. The interac- tions between the TMC and the BSO have never been stronger, or healthier. All TMC Fellows have the ojrporttmity, in various ways, to be onstage with the Boston Symjjhony: perhaps playing in with the orchestra, or observing rehearsals from within the section. BSO players serve as liai.sons to their instrumental counterparts in the TMC, forming strong mentorship relationships throughotit the summer. World-renowned BSO gtiest artists join in working with the Fellows as well, in both formal and informal settings, and a distinguished facidty serves the non- orchestral disciplines, including the vocal and composition programs. And the jii imacy of composers and new music continues to inform TMC activity. Cielebrating this, for the summer of 2015 some thirty-four works have been com- missioned from a wide range of composers (and one clioreograpiier) whose rela- tionships to Tanglewood, as students, factilty, or sometimes both, extends from 1945 to 2014. And our highlighting of contemporary works is by no means limited to these. Every TMC program will feature new music, including the works of the 2015 Com|Josition Fellows alongside their senior colleagues. Koussevitzky’s vision of the TMC sprang from a deeply held conviction — that music is important, truly important, and that recognizing its profound power to both elevate the soul and deepen understanding requires a place where this can be explored lidly, as free of limitations as possible. In his own words, from 1947: “Have we the courage to break away from the banality of mere ‘enjoyment’ to the realm of pure joy to which music belongs?” The realm of pure joy is the place to which the TMC aspires; may we never aspire to anything less. ELLEN HIGHSTEIN has been director of the Tanglewood Music Center since 1998. m C4fl Fitcbcr.lAC New York. First page of the manuscript score of Randall Thompson's \"Alleluia,\" which was composed for the Opening Exercises of the Berkshire Music Center's inaugural session in 1940 (BSO Archives) 75 Years of Chamber Music at Tanglewood by Pamela Feo Chamber music concerts at the Tanglewood Music Center draw Fellows out from the orchestra and into the spotlight. Wliat audiences do not see, however, is the transformative process that occurs on the path to the stage: intense coaching sessions whose lessons last well beyond that week’s concert. For eight weeks every summer, instrumental Fellows work closely with coaches and with each other in trios, quartets, and larger ensembles, refining skills vital to true musi- cianship. This invaluable experience of developing as performers together encapsulates Serge Koussevitzky’s original vision of interpretation through col- laboration at Tanglewood. That chamber music holds a unique appeal for Fellows was already evident in 1940, during the first summer of the Berkshire Music Center, as it was then called. Wliile it had always been envisioned as part of the instrumental program, no one among the founding faculty anticipated the absolute zeal with which it was pur- sued. Students are on record as rehearsing in spontaneously formed groups “at all possible hours and in all possible places,” and showed “amazing” eagerness when working with BSO musicians. In response, the Center’s second year brought with it an official branch dedicated specifically to chamber music studies, led by Gregor Piatigorsky, with the newly built Chamber Music Hall and Theatre-Concert Hall providing rehearsal and performance space. Chamber music continued to thrive with Richard Burgin, William Kroll, Gilbert Kalish, and Joel Smirnoff each at the helm over the years. Coaches such as vio- linist Louis Krasiler, who had premiered Berg’s Violin Concerto, and BSO violist Eugene Lehner, former violist of the Kolisch Quartet, provided an invaluable and direct link to the music of such composers as Bartok, Schoenberg, and Berg. Larger chamber music works offered particularly rewarding experience; as for- mer BSO concertmaster Joseph Silverstein, who chaired the facidty for over thirty years, points out, “It was only in a festival that students got the opportunity to perform such marvelous pieces as the Brahms and Dvorak sextets or the Schubert and Enescu octets. It is very difficult to assemble a group like that at a conserva- tory, whereas here everyone is available to put together those larger works.” More pieces were studied during those years than could be performed: with at least fifteen coaches rehearsing two groixps at a time, over thirty groups might be working on a new piece each week, of which only three were selected for Sunday concerts. And yet even without the promise of performance, chamber music remained a compelling reason to study at Tanglewood precisely because of the rewards of the coaching process. In 1963 incoming BSO Music Director Erich Leinsdorf became the Berkshire Music Center’s new director and proclaimed a renewed emphasis on chamber music. In his first address to Tanglewood students, he eloquently highlighted the spirit of collaboration that is so effectively developed through chamber music studies: “To play chamber music you should alternately assert and submerge your individuality. Chamber music played without personality is a dead letter. Chamber music played as a competition for maximnm attention to oneself is no longer chamber music.” Leinsdorf s belief in the value of chamber music enabled it to nourish during his tenure, and it has continued to develop throughout the years since. Even with the demands of regular orchestra rehearsals, seminars, and master classes that make np the TMC experience today. Fellows must carve out time for rehearsals and coaching sessions to keep np with a demanding cham- ber music concert schedule. In addition to the longstanding Snnday-morning concert series. Fellows now also perform in Satnrday-evening Prelude concerts prior to BSO Shed performances, as well as in nnmerons other concerts throngh- ont the Slimmer, with certain programs dedicated solely to brass, percussion, or woodwinds. In 1994 the completion of Seiji Ozawa Hall gave these concerts a new home in a world-class performance space particularly suited to the acoustics of a small ensemble, while its open back wall allows the music to carry over the grounds in iconic Tanglewood fashion. Fellows share this space with such illnstri- ons guest artists as Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax, who also act as coaches. TMC chamber music today is shaped by its focus on specific repertoire, highlighted through the String Quartet Seminar and similar activities. In the seminar’s intense week of daily coaching under the direction of Norman Fischer and faculty enlisted from prominent professional quartets, works by Haydn and others, encomjjassing multiple time periods and styles, are prepared for a culminating “Marathon” per- formance. Through this process. Fellows sharpen listening and timing skills that inform every aspect of their playing, and by the end of the week are primed to enter orchestra rehearsals with greater attimement to their peers. Contemporary music is another significant area of focus, as it has been since developments implemented by Feinsdorf; in addition to the Fromm Players, who worked exclusively on new music, Feinsdorf drew regular chamber music students into these activities as well, under the direction of Gunther Schuller. The inaugu- ration in 1964 of the Festival of Contemporary American Music (now the Festival of Contemporary Music), along with the frequent presence of prominent com- posers as coaches, has led to some of Tanglewood’s most exciting collaborations. Pieces by the Composition Fellows, previously segregated into their own concerts, have been integrated into the weekly chamber music series since 1965. The many current BSO players who are TMC alumni consistently claim that they have carried the skills developed through their Tanglewood chamber music expe- rience to Symphony Hall. Many have become coaches in turn, and count both sides of the intimate coaching relationship as among their most cherished learn- ing experiences. BSO violinist Ronan Fefkowitz, who was a Fellow in 1972 and has been coaching for over twenty years, voices the sentiment of his colleagues when he says, “I was a student at Tanglewood; I am still a student at Tanglewood.” The TMC’s 75th anniversary this summer, marked by an abundance of commis- sioned works by former Composition Fellows as well as former and current faculty members, enlivens the chamber music program with the best that Tanglewood offers; collaborations among performers, coaches, and composers that inspire and elevate, filling the summer with the camaraderie of reaching new heights of music-making together. It is through the alchemy of this collaborative process that musicians learn how truly to listen to one another; where, in the absence of a conductor, hesitant performers emerge as leaders; and where an ensemble, in working together, can create an offering greater than the sum of its parts.

Whitaker Fund. The Tanglewood Music Center The Tanglewood Music Center was founded by Serge Koussevitzky as the Berkshire Music Center in 1940. Since then, each summer roughly 150 extraordinarily gifted young musicians come to study, perform and create at Tanglewood, working with some of the world's most distinguished ^ artists — including members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, guests of the BSO, and specially invited artists. Over the years, the TMC has become one of the world's most influential centers for advanced musical study; alumni of the Tanglewood Music Center play a vital role in the musical life of the nation and the world. The Tanglewood Music Center would not exist without support from Friends of the Tanglewood Music Center. TMC ticket sales generate only a small percentage of the revenue required to operate the TMC. Contributions from the Friends of the TMC make up the balance. To make a gift, call the Friends Office at (413) 637-5261. The Tanglewood Music Center gratefully acknowledges AMERICAN AIRLINES, and COMMONWEALTH WORLDWIDE CHAUFFEURED TRANSPORTATION, for providing transportation assistance to TMC Resident Artist Faculty, Guest Artists, and Staff; and THE STUDLEY PRESS, for printing this program.
