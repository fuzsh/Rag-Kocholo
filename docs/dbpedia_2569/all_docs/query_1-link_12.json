        "text": "The discography of Katherine Jenkins, a Welsh mezzo-soprano singer, consists of twelve studio albums, two soundtrack albums, two compilation albums, eleven singles and three video albums.\n\nReleased in April 2004, Katherine's classical chart-topping debut album Premiere, was a mix of old standards including Ave Maria and The Lord Is My Shepherd, plus a smattering of traditional Welsh songs and new interpretations of classic tunes by Handel, Bach, Erik Satie and others. The album made her the fastest-selling mezzo-soprano to date[1] she became the first British classical crossover artist to have two number one albums in the same year.[2] Her second album, Second Nature, reached number 16 in the UK later on in 2004. Next album, Living A Dream followed in 2005 and held the number one position in the classical charts for nearly a year and reached number four in the pop album charts.[3] Her fourth album, Serenade was released in November 2006 and reached number five in the mainstream charts selling more than 50,000 copies in its first week, a record in the genre.[1] Fifth album, Rejoice, was released a year later in November 2007 and included songs written specially for her and entered the pop album charts at number three, beating the Spice Girls and Girls Aloud.[4]"
