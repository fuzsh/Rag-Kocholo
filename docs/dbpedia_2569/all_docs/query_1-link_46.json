        "text": "The more you surrender to it, the better it gets.\n\nBy the time of her second album, the debates whether or not this was still Classical music and whether or not she could sing, had died down. Katherine Jenkins hadÂ cheered on the Welsh rugby team, appeared in almost every TV show as well as every awards ceremony imaginable and been such an adorable person and persuasive performer at it, that even her most passionate opponents had to admit there was more to this lady than just looks. After âSecond Natureâ, of course, all of the points, which could possibly have been brought against her, were utterly pointless anyway â itâs pretty hard arguing with more than 500.000 copies of this record sold in the UK alone. Youâd also be ill advided snubbing Jenkins for the mere fact that sheâs a blockbuster, simply because thereâd be quite a lot youâd miss.\n\nStill, thereâs an instruction manual which goes with âSecond Natureâ. First of all you have to let go. Stop expecting any drastic changes from Jenkinsâ first effort, âPremiereâ. This is yet another go at a selection of carefully balanced classical favourites, contemporary pieces in a classical style, some seasonal material (this was released at Christmas at the time) and excerpts from Hollywood scores (âHannibalâ, âSaving Private Ryanâ). So, at least when it comes to repertoire, she sticks to her guns and does what she does best: Playing the popular tune. On top of that, it would also be a good idea to quit thinking of Opera as a âbigger, better, faster, moreâ genre. Katherineâs vocal range is certainly lightyears from what Britney Spears could ever dream of (or would ever, for that matter), but she interprets these fifteen songs like pure pop: âTime to say goodbyeâ, âI love you very much, very, very much, you knowâ, âOh moon, tell me, oh where is my loverâ, girl wants boy and how will they get together â beyond this horizon, there is nothing. Not that there need be. For whatever so-called experts are telling you in their forums, blogs and arts supplements, opera has hardly ever been about nurturing the elite, but about pleasing the crowd. âSecond Natureâ is one of these albums, which youâll put up and instantly feel at home with. Itâs a great companion to cooking pasta, to adorning the christmas tree, to sitting on the couch with your loved one or to simply have a glass of red wine on your own. Her version of Lucio Dallaâs ode to âCarusoâ is tender and heartwrenching, she sounds natural and unpretentious in Dvorakâs âSong to the Moonâ and her duet with tenor Rhys Meirion of superficial beauty. The more you surrender to it, the better it gets.\n\nCâmon, admit it: You enjoy a simple and direct tune as well, one of those which go straight to the heart. And thatâs exactly what you are going to get here. So, to return to our manual, you will have to be able to accept a decent dose of sentiment, or else the muffled horns and sadly rolling drums of the tear-drenched dirge âHymn to the Fallenâ will be wasted on you. But if you can, âSecond Natureâ has the potential to turn into a dear friend and an album, which youâll like to play in some of those special moments. With its mix of catchy and stirring material, it takes us back to a time, when people would hum opera melodies on the street and Caruso was a pop star. As such, it is more classical than critics-pleasing Classicallâart pour lâart could ever be.Â\n\nBy Tobias Fischer"
