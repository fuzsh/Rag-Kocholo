        "text": "I dedicate this chapter to the inexhaustible memory of poet and playwright, Amiri Baraka (1934-2014). The drama of Africans' forceful migration and existence as an internal colony under the control of the dominant white infrastructure in the United States acts as the fundamental backdrop for protest discourse. Largely absent from the examination of this history, and from critiques of subordination within the discipline of performance arts in the United States, is the analysis of the historical roots of protest and its consequent discourse in African American theater. The purpose of this essay is to trace those roots as they develop on the early twentieth-century stage, how they emerge full force during the 1960s and 1970s, and how they create lasting legacies for contemporary theater. It is likely no accident that traditions of protest discourse in performance art have gone under-studied until recently. Even the contemporary world sees cultural products, including those originating from counter-cultural ideologies, transmitted to people in ways that fit prescribed roles. The process boils down divergent components into an indistinguishable mass of uniformity, an inferno feeding on negativity and separatism. In America the history of stereotypes has been advanced with racial intimidation on stage.\n\nThis essay aims to draw attention to the fundamental differences that exist between the inherent qualities of African American dramatic tradition and the dramatic tradition of the West through an assessment of initial models in both traditions. Aristotle, Shakespeare, Descartes and Nietzsche’s contribution to European arts, literature and philosophy may have been great however Aristotelian premises do not explain African or Asian phenomena. In Black Theatre: Premise and Presentation, Molette and Molette (1986) argue that in African American drama rather than Aristotle’s formula on linear development, aesthetic priorities place a higher value on texture in forms of dialogue, music, and spectacle (Molette & Molette, 1986). Rather than the script, the theme, the plot, the character, the presentation is of primary importance; it is the overall effect of the presentation and not just the words but how well they are presented to the audience. Fundamentally this essay postulates that understanding African American drama in the light of Afrocentricity rests on viewing it as a means of total creation that derives its power from the interaction of a human being with the self, the community, and the cosmos."
