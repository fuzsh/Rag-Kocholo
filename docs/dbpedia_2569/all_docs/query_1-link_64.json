        "text": "Sleep\n\nI get up at 6.30am to feed my seven-month-old son, Xander, but as a morning person, I have lots of energy. I get less sleep than I should – I’m never in bed before 11pm. Luckily I’m good at napping on planes or in the car. My husband Andrew works on West Coast time, starting at 3pm and finishing at three in the morning.\n\nFood\n\nI am a pescetarian-vegan in remembrance of my friend Polly Humphries, who passed away from cancer and ate a plant-based diet. Breakfast is porridge with almond milk. Lunch is salad with tuna or tofu. Dinner is roasted veg with salmon and salad. I enjoy a glass of wine on holiday, but alcohol’s effect on the voice means none while performing.\n\nWork\n\nI no longer get nervous performing. When I was younger, I would overthink things, and never performed as well as in rehearsal. Now it’s second nature to get out there and have a good time, sharing the occasion with the audience. With young children, I do less international touring; I can go back when Aaliyah, who is three, and Xander are older. On tour, I don’t speak between performances: from coming off stage to the next sound check. It’s a discipline. To be in the best vocal state, you must not overwork your voice. I let everybody know: I would hate to appear rude.\n\nFamily\n\nKids are the best thing that ever happened to us. I’m in awe of my husband for how great a father he is. We’re both artists, so love painting, dressing up, or putting on a show with the kids. My sister Laura lives in London with her two children, so my mother Susan can see all the grandchildren at once. Mother-in-law comes over from New York twice a year, and Andrew’s grandmother is 93. My nana was an important influence on me, so it’s great the children have these wise people in their lives.\n\nFun\n\nI enjoy eating out and trying different kinds of food. We love the theatre and art exhibitions. I’ve run marathons and 10km races, so fun for me is going for a run or fitting in a workout. I’ve definitely changed: I used to chase fun, but now everything I want is at home."
