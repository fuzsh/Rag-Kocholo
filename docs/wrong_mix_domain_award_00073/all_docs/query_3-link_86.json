The award aims to recognize outstanding and creative contributions by a nominee to fundamental discoveries or inventions in ultrafast science and technology in the areas of physics, chemistry, biology, or related fields regardless of race, gender, age, religion, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity, presence of disabilities, and educational background. The recipient will have conducted original and insightful research that has had a significant impact on the field of ultrafast science and technology.\n\nThe award was established in 2005 and is supported by the Ahmed Zewail Endowment Fund, established by the Newport Corporation.\n\nAward\n\nThe award will consist of $5,000 and a certificate. Up to $2,500 for travel expenses to the meeting at which the award will be presented will be reimbursed.\n\nEligibility\n\nNominators\n\nNominators are not required to be members of the Society.\n\nA nomination can only have one nominator and the recommendation letter is written by this person.\n\nAny individual, except a member of the award selection committee or an ACS Board member during their terms of service on the Board, may submit one nomination and/or one support letter for each award. However, selection committee members may submit other nominations or support letters for awards for which they are not serving as a judge.\n\nNominees\n\nNominees are not required to be members of the Society unless the submission is for the ACS Award for Team Innovation (which requires at least one team member to be an ACS member in good standing), the ACS Award for Distinguished Service in the Advancement of Inorganic Chemistry, the Award for Volunteer Service to the ACS, the Kathryn C. Hach Award for Entrepreneurial Success, or the Charles Lathrop Parsons Award.\n\nThe nomineeâs accomplishments should be specific to the purpose of the award.\n\nIn general, a recipient of a widely recognized scientific award is not eligible for an ACS National Award unless the accomplishment cited as the basis for the nomination represents new or different work.\n\nAn individual who has received an ACS National Award may be nominated for a different ACS National Award if (1) the nomination is for clearly different work from the previous award (the letter of recommendation must address the differences between the work performed for the previous ACS National Award and that which is addressed in the current nomination) or (2) at least five years has elapsed since the previous ACS National Award was received. The five year rule is waived for the preceptor(s) of the students who are eligible to receive the Nobel Laureate Signature Award for Graduate Education in Chemistry.\n\nNomination\n\nClick here to nominate\n\nFor more information, visit Ahmed Zewail Award.\n\nShare.\n\nJude Ogar\n\nWebsite\n\nJude Ogar is an educator and youth development practitioner with years of experience working in the education and youth development space.
