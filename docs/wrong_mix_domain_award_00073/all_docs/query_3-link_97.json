King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented the Â£600,000 Nobel Prize awarded to Ahmed Zewail for developing what amounts to a highly sophisticated form of flash photography, in Stockholm on 10th December.\n\nThe California Institute of Technology researcher pioneered a laser technique that allows scientists to see, in \"slow motion\", how atoms and molecules behave in chemical reactions. In a series of groundbreaking experiments in the 1980s, he developed what many have described as the world's fastest camera - a device that provides a laser flash measured in femtoseconds. This is a unit of measurement equal to 0.000000000000001 seconds, which is to a second what a second is to 32 million years. But this is the sort of speed required if chemists want to \"freeze\" the moment when atoms and molecules come together to form new compounds. This area of physical chemistry is now called femtochemistry.\n\nAnnouncing the Nobel Prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Ahmed Zewail was being honoured for creating a \"revolution\" in chemistry. \"Scientists the world over are studying processes with femtosecond spectroscopy in gases and in solids, on surfaces and in polymers,\" it said."
