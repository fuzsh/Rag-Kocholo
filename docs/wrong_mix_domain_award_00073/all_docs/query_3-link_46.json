        "text": "5 Ahmed Hassan Zewail\n\nJohn Kaiser; Alex Meier; Mckenzy Chu; Abby Rickman; Anna Scarpaci; Raegan Stiger; Maclaine Spears; and Shuai Sun\n\nAhmed Hassan Zewail was born in 1946 in Damanhur, Egypt. Growing up in Alexandria, Ahmed was the only son among three girls. His father worked in the government while his mother was a stay-at-home mom. As a child, Ahmed naturally gravitated towards physical sciences, especially math, engineering, and chemistry. When choosing where to go for his secondary education, Ahmed was pushed heavily by his parents to study abroad. Despite this, Ackman decided to study in Egypt for his college.\n\nDuring Zewail’s childhood, the 23 July Revolution took place, culminating in the ousting of the Egyptian monarchy. The revolutionaries that spearheaded this revolution were mainly concerned with decolonization and modernizing politics in Northern Africa and the Middle East. The 23 July Revolution would establish Gamal Nasser as president of Egypt. Under Nasser’s rule, a new standardized test was created that modernized Egyptian education. One aspect of this education reform was the Thanaweya Amma, a standardized test that any prospective college students must take. Zewail took the test, and was assigned to attended the University of Alexandria. It was here that Zewail would earn both a B.S. and M.D. degree in chemistry. Zewail successfully completed his Master’s degree in a short period of time, lasting only 18 months compared to the typical two year program.\n\nUpon completing his Master’s degree, Zewail was again compelled by his professors to go abroad and study. Two of his professors, Professor El Ezaby and Professor El Tantaway, recommended that Zewail study spectral changes of various molecules in different solvents. At first apprehensive, Zewail eventually applied to travel to the United States. Zewail’s initial hesitance lied with geopolitical conflicts at the time. Nasser’s reign over Egypt had led to the country siding with the Soviet Union. Many Egyptians studying abroad would therefore either go to the U.S.S.R. or to Eastern Europe for their research. Additionally, Zewail had no ties to the United States and practically no knowledge of how to assimilate. Regardless, Zewail was offered a scholarship by the University of Pennsylvania and a stipend, both of which would allow him to complete his studies.\n\nAs a foreigner, Zewail found it difficult to become accustomed to the social structure and language of the United States. This was especially difficult when he was trying to form friendships. A lot of communication between individuals, such as humor and flow of conversation, is language and culture-specific. Despite this, Zewail was enamored by the new knowledge he was acquiring, as well as the new culture that he was being exposed to.\n\nAfter finishing his PhD, Zewail ruminated on whether he should return to Egypt or stay in the U.S. to become a professor. Ultimately, Zewail decided that the U.S. was a better option because of the better resources and academic freedom that he could have. Although Zewail decided to stay in the U.S., he still held very strong pride in his Egyptian ethnicity.\n\nWith his decision to stay in the United States, Zewail ended up taking a position at Berkley. He found that he could connect with many of his peers through a shared love of science. One of these peers was Charles Harris, who would offer Zewail an IBM fellowship. However, Zewail was more interested in an assistant professorship at Caltech. Zewail would become a Professor, and would continue the rest of his academic career there. Zewail’s work at Caltech would earn him a Nobel Prize in 1999. This served as a realization of a dream he had since his childhood, as he reminisced over times when he was younger and Egyptian scientists would be recognized for their achievements.\n\nZewail’s interests extended beyond just the chemistry lab. In addition to his chemistry work, Zewail engaged in political and social activism in Egypt. The same year he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, he was awarded the Grand Collar of the Nile. This award was given to Egyptian citizens who had contributed to Egyptian society. Zewail is the only scientist to have received this award. In 2010, Zewail was also named as a science envoy to Muslim-majority countries throughout the world. One of Zewail’s books Reflections on World Affairs, Peace, and Politics, looked at the connections between Egypt, the U.S., and the role of science on global affairs. During the 2011 Egyptian protests, Zewail also served as a communications envoy between the military state and revolutionary groups that were protesting the brutality of the government. Zewail would pass in 2016 at the age of 70, survived by his wife and four kids. A national funeral, attended by the Egyptian President, Prime Minister, and many very important Egyptian officials and Muslim leaders, was held in Cairo.\n\nAhmed Zewail was a pioneer in the field of femtochemistry. While Zewail received many accolades throughout his career, this is most evident by his Nobel prize. Ahmed Zewail was the first Egyptian/Arab man to win The Nobel Prize in Chemistry. His research changed the world in the way that we now understand chemical reactions. Ahmed’s research used laser technology to snapshot the exact moment in which the chemical reaction occurred. He used a technique of rapid ultrafast lasers to be able to determine that it is possible to map out chemical reactions. Zewail was able to study the bonds and formations of these chemical reactions in detail. Later he designed a four-dimensional ultrafast electron microscope, this helped to visualize how complex chemical reactions are. The microscope showed the physical and chemical changes between the chemical reactions.\n\nIn his career, Zewail was a chemist, professor, and advisor to the United States. After he earned his PhD from Berkeley, Zewail became a professor at the California Institute of Technology. Zewail’s main focus in research was femtochemistry, his main research is what made him known around the world today. His research group in CalTech was designing and constructing instruments to view chemical reactions. In 2009, he served was appointed to the Advisory Science Council to The United States under the administration of former President Barack Obama. While he served in the advisory council, he raised awareness of the need to invest in fundamental research of science and mathematics. He believed that this initial investment would help economic development but provide political stability in The United States. He is the reason that Barack Obama started a new program of Science Envoys specifically for the United States and Muslims."
