Zewail developed a new way of using ultra-short pulsing laser flashes to observe and isolate chemical reactions down to the femtosecond (one quadrillionth of a second). His pioneering methodology, called femtochemistry, has revealed previously unknown aspects of the transition states of chemical reactions, and brought Zewail the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1999. He has also studied 4D electron microscopy.\n\nFather: Hassan Zewail (d. 22-Oct-1992)\n\nWife: Dema Faham (physician, m. 1989, two daughters, two sons)\n\nDaughter: Maha\n\nDaughter: Amani\n\nSon: Nabeel\n\nSon: Hani\n\nUniversity: BS Chemistry, Alexandria University (1967)\n\nUniversity: MS Chemistry, Alexandria University (1969)\n\nUniversity: PhD Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania (1974)\n\nFellow: University of California at Berkeley (1974-76)\n\nTeacher: Chemistry, California Institute of Technology (1976-78)\n\nProfessor: Chemistry, California Institute of Technology (1976-90)\n\nProfessor: Linus Pauling Chair Professor of Chemistry, California Institute of Technology (1990-)\n\nAdministrator: Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science & Technology, Cal Tech (2005-)\n\nACS Buck-Whitney Medal 1985\n\nGuggenheim Fellowship 1987\n\nACS Harrison Howe Award 1989\n\nKing Faisal International Prize in Science 1989\n\nAPS Plyler Prize for Molecular Spectroscopy 1993\n\nWolf Prize in Chemistry 1993\n\nAPS Herbert P.
