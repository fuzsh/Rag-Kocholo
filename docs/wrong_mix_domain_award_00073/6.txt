Details of the Prize

Ahmed H. Zewail, the winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, established this prize at AUC to recognize honors graduates whose academic accomplishments demonstrate a strong commitment to scientific inquiry and the affirmation of human values. The prize is intended to reflect Zewail’s belief that Egypt’s future development is based on:

Progress in the physical, biological and social sciences

Development of world-class technologies

A deeper understanding of the relationship between science, technology, and society

Candidates are evaluated by a panel of University faculty members on the basis of academic achievement, originality of their essays, and extracurricular activities that embody the ideals of the award. The prize was given for the first time in February 2001 and winners will be recognized at each AUC commencement.

Participants should submit the essay by email attachment to by May 8, 2024, at midnight (11:59 pm) Cairo Local Time.

Eligibility

The applicant must be an AUC student in the final semester of undergraduate study

Selection Criteria

A select faculty panel evaluates prospective candidates on the basis of the following:

Participants must write an original 1,500 to 2,000-word essay written especially for the prize on a science and humanities topic. The panel will judge the essay on its quality of thought, expression, originality, and multidisciplinary sophistication. Applicants must write one of the following two essays:

An original essay on any science and humanities topic that transcends the rigid boundaries of traditional academic disciplines and reflects a multidisciplinary perspective on the chosen topic

An original essay on a topic drawn from within the student’s own area of specialization that explores new ideas and possibilities and reflects the applicant’s own work and intellectual interest.

It is both appropriate and essential that the candidate reflects the breadth and depth of AUC’s academic reach and rich diversity of perspectives. Consistent with this goal, the widest possible participation by AUC students in all schools is welcomed and encouraged.
