We recommend this charming hotel to those who want to experience the authentic and timeless Sardinia: Le Dune Piscinas is a sustainable 5-star hotel that pays careful and respectful attention to the exceptional context in which the structure is located and features a contemporary design that harmonises with it, the external environment and the spectacular nature are the real protagonists here.

In the courtyard of the hotel, surrounded by luxuriant gardens, you will find an almost magical atmosphere, reminiscent of times gone by, when the house was the centre of agricultural activity. The rooms, distributed between the main house and the annex, are an expression of rustic elegance, furnished with antique furniture but equipped with all modern conveniences. The hotel restaurant offers a culinary experience of simple and genuine flavours, where guests can taste local delicacies every day in the garden or under the shelter of the loggia.\n\nBoutiquehotel Is Cheas"
