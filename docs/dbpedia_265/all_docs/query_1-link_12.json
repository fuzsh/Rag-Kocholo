        "text": "The church of Santa Maria Assunta in Riola is located in Vergato Bologna Apennines and was built\n\nbetween 1977-78 but finished only in 1994. The church was designed by architect Alvar Aalto who\n\ndesigned the structure and all the interior furnishings. In 1955 Cardinal Lercaro gave the charge office\n\nNew Churches to equip places of worship the outskirts of the city that was expanding as a result of\n\nurbanization. However, the flattening of architectural churches, anonymous and repetitive,\n\ncommissioned the three major architects of the time to design a church. These were: France’s Le\n\nCorbusier, Aalto and Tange Japanese. Each of them accepted the invitation and made a plan. Aalto was\n\nthe only one to be realized in practice. The study of light was one of the main cornerstones of the\n\narchitect’s work. The light inside the church is widespread, snatched by large windows oriented to the\n\nnorth so that the end result is plentiful but never direct. Also for night illumination sources have been\n\nincluded in order to give a soft light, very impressive. The shape of a “reversed binoculars church” This\n\nmeans that all prospective lines are ideally converge in the center of the cross, including the\n\nbell tower.\n\nThe Futa German Military Cemetery is located near the Futa Pass, on a characteristic mountain\n\npeak at an altitude of 950 MASL, halfway between Bologna and Florence. During the Second World\n\nWar, this spectacular Tusco-Emilian mountainscape was part of the Gothic Line, the German\n\ndefensive front that sought to slow down the Allied military advance. Built in the 1960s by the\n\nGerman architect, Dieter Osterlen, following agreements between Italy and the Federal German\n\nRepublic, the Futa German Military Cemetery is the largest burial ground built in Italy for the\n\nGerman troops who died here during the war. The cemetery covers 12 hectares of ground and\n\nconsists of a series of stepped terraces that follow the slope of the mountain. The tombs are\n\nprotected by a 2 km long perimeter wall that spirals up to the peak of the mountain, culminating in\n\na pointed wedge-shaped memorial under which are two commemorative crypts.\n\nThis high, knifeedged feature pointing up into the sky makes the Futa German Military Cemetery a distinctive\n\nlandmark that can be seen from many miles around.\n\nThe Pliocenico Contrafforte is a large area formed by sandstone rocks that stretches between the\n\nvalleys of the Mountain Community Five Valleys Bolognesi in Monzuno and Sasso Marconi. The\n\ngeology of this area comes from the sediments transported by the rivers of these valleys that were\n\ngoing to come together in a large maritime area in which the Pliocene characterized much of the\n\nBolognese Apennines area. The rocks of the current surveys that have formed as a result of the\n\nlifting of the Apennine Mountains are rich in fossils and that refer to the presence of the sea in all\n\nthis territory. The most striking are the heights of the Buttress of Mounte delle Formiche, Monte\n\nAdone and Monte Mario. Within this area of Community interest was established in 2006, the\n\nNatural Pliocenico Contrafforte, a protected natural area of the Emilia Romagna region reserve\n\nthat distinguishes the province south of Bologna for its particular shape and variety of wildlife and\n\nthe environment. The natural beauty of this landscape can best be discovered along the famous\n\nVia degli Dei, a hiking path marked by C.A.I. that can be done on foot or by mountain bike and\n\nrunning through the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines from Bologna to Florence.\n\nRightfully regarded as one of the most picturesque medieval hamlets in the Tusco-Emilian\n\nApennines, the town of Dozza nestles comfortably in the hills, just north-west of Imola. Its\n\nbeautifully preserved buildings and splendid backdrop of rolling hills and vineyards,\n\ncrowned by a majestic Sforza castle, all combine to make the town well worth a visit,\n\nespecially as the official Enoteca Regionale dell’Emilia-Romagna is housed in the cellars of\n\nthe fortress. Founded in 1970 and granted official status by the regional authorities 8 years\n\nlater, this wine association brings together over 200 producers of fine wines, spirits and\n\nbalsamic vinegar. The activities of the Enoteca basically aim in two directions: – to offer a\n\nfirsthand experience of wines in a store-cum-museum opened in 2006 in the Sforza castle\n\nvaults (where over 1000 different regional wines are on display) and to popularise wine\n\ngenerally; – to promote local wines in Italy and abroad by providing coordination, support\n\nand attendance at trade fairs, such as Vinitaly. Dozza also stands out for the numerous\n\nmurals that decorate the facades of the houses and enhance the village’s unique\n\ncharacter. Since 1989 Dozza has organised a special Mural Biennial Festival that has\n\nbecome the village’s main event. Every two years, acclaimed national and international\n\nartists come here to paint permanent works on the walls of this small town, thereby\n\nhelping to create its distinctive, artistic character. Dozza is just 3 Km from the Via Emilia\n\nbetween Bologna and Imola (25 km from Bologna and 6 km from Imola). Dozza can be\n\neasily reached from Lodole Country House by taking the A1 (Firenze – Bologna) motorway\n\nat Sasso Marconi, changing to the A14 (Bologna – Ancona) motorway, exiting at Castel San\n\nPietro Terme and then continuing along the Via Emilia until the Dozza turn off.\n\nGLAMPING: EXTRA-LUXURY TENTS TO BE IN CONTACT WITH NATURE.\n\nWhat happens when luxury accommodation meets nature? Glamping is born, a word born from the fusion between glamour and camping, which represents the new frontier of green and eco-sustainable tourism.\n\nA lifestyle capable of captivating and conquering more and more people around the world.\n\nGlamping is intended for those who want to experience an experiential holiday immersed in nature without having to give up comfort: a pre-furnished extra-luxury tent where you have the option of sleeping in a double bed, with a private bathroom and all the services you don’t have nothing to envy to a high level hotel.\n\nAlso in Lodole’s programs there is the opening of glamping structures to offer customers the opportunity to experience an alternative and unforgettable glamorous holiday.\n\nFollow us, we will keep you updated on the developments of the project.\n\nThe Labante cave is a karstic phenomenon which is very important due to its rarity: it is in fact the\n\nlargest primary travertine cave in Italy and perhaps one of the largest in Europe. Above the cave\n\nthere is a natural waterfall fed by the spring that built up the deposit of calcareous rock which was\n\nquarried by the Etruscans for the construction of the necropolis of Marzabotto. The cave is located\n\nin a park with numerous hikes and mountain bike routes. The cave can be reached by following\n\nthe directions and the external structure can be seen easily from the road. The cave is free to visit\n\nand is always open. How to get there: from Lodole Country House take the SP 38 road as far as\n\nRioveggio, then reach Grizzana Morandi and then Vergato. From Vergato take the SS 64 Porrettana\n\nroad South. After Vergato turn right on the SP 68 road towards Castel D’Aiano. Once in Labante\n\nfollow the directions to the Grotta.\n\nWe recommend a unique route off the beaten track to immerse yourself in the nature and history\n\nof the Bolognese Apennine. From Lodole reach the Reno Valley heading towards Rioveggio and\n\ntake the SS 64 Porrettana road south. After Vergato, at Ca’ Mezzini and just before the bridge on\n\nthe Reno, turn right and follow the directions for Vimignano. Then continue until Ca’ Viola and the\n\nintersection with the SP 73 road. Continue towards Vimignano, as far as the La Scola hamlet in the\n\nmunicipality of Grizzana Morandi, an area that shares the same name as the local painter Giorgio\n\nMorandi. La Scola derives its name from the Lombard term Sculca, which means a lookout from a\n\nhigh position. The hamlet’s defences were strengthened over the years with the construction of\n\nwalls and towers, as a final bulwark of defence. The most important building of the hamlet, Casa\n\nParisi (named after the family that owned the hamlet until the eighteenth century), which dates\n\nfrom the second half of the fourteenth century, is a massive construction that follows the shape of\n\ndefence fortresses. The higher part of the hamlet still houses the Oratory of S.Rocco which, built\n\nwith blocks of sandstone, is the only example of this type of building left in the Bolognese\n\nApennine. Finally the lower part of the hamlet, full of valuable architectonic features (covered\n\nloggias, windows and fireplaces with coats of arms, internal walls and covered walkways) is also\n\nhome to a cypress which is over a hundred years old and has been declared an arboreal\n\nmonument. From La Scola you can reach the Sanctuary of Montovolo. Once past Grizzana\n\nMorandi and the Church of Campolo, the road rises to the summit of the hill, revealing wonderful\n\nsurprises: a beautiful panorama over the surrounding mountains of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines\n\n(the Corno alle Scale, Nuda and Monte Cimone mountains can be seen), the sanctuary, a sort of\n\nlodge and a breath taking view of the Reno valley. Heading back towards Lodole Country House,\n\nthe road from Grizzana reaches Camugnano where, just south of Mount Vigese (Site of Community\n\nImportance where birds of prey such as golden eagles nest) there is an enormous rock with the\n\nVigo church on top, which is quite spectacular when illuminated at night. To round off the trip in\n\nfine style stop off at the Trattoria da Anna in Campolo, for a fantastic meal of typical dishes of the\n\nBolognese Apennine.\n\nThe idea of creating a dam on the Sieve river, in Bilancino on the Tuscan-Emilian Apennine, dates\n\nfrom the end of the fifties, in order to prevent the flooding of the Arno and to fulfil the demands\n\nfor water from the nearby Florence. The idea started to become a reality only in 1978, years after\n\nthe famous Florence flood. Work began in 1984, after many variations that included areas with\n\nrecreational facilities, a hunting area and an area for water sports. The project, therefore, resulted\n\nin a veritable lake. The Bilancino lake, which was opened to the public in 1999, covers an area of\n\nabout five square kilometres. It is one of Italy’s largest artificial reservoirs and is up to thirty one\n\nmetres deep. As well as the beaches, the area includes a naturalistic oasis managed by WWF and\n\nmany areas for hiking and mountain biking, as well as water sports such as canoeing, kayaking,\n\nwindsurfing and sailing. How to get there: from Rioveggio take the A1 motorway towards Florence,\n\nand exit at Barberino di Mugello. After the tollbooth turn right at the first junction and right again\n\nat the roundabout (2 km).\n\nThe Castel dell’Alpi lake is a natural reservoir formed in 1950 following a landslide that blocked the\n\ncourse of the Savena river. The lake is located by Castel dell’Alpi, a small hamlet buried deep in the\n\nlush greenery of the Tusco-Emilian Apennines in the municipality of San Benedetto Val di Sambro\n\nand it is the only naturally formed reservoir in the entire province of Bologna. It name comes from\n\nthe ancient hamlet of Castel dell’Alpi that once stood on the left bank of the Savena river. Sadly the\n\nhamlet was destroyed by the landslide, but the old church and belltower survived and can still be\n\nseen today. Some years after the disaster, the village was rebuilt on the righthand bank of the lake\n\nand this has since become a popular tourist resort, especially in the summer months. Beautiful\n\nviews can be enjoyed from the paths that run along the banks, and for the more adventurous,\n\nrowing boats are available for hire. For fishing enthusiasts the lake is full of all kinds of fish,\n\nincluding carp and trout that can be caught from either the bank or a boat. The lake is also a\n\nparadise for trekking enthusiasts as numerous paths and nature trails start here and then\n\nmeander their way through chestnut woods and oak forests up to the nearby border with Tuscany.\n\nFrom Lodole Country House the Castel dell’Alpi lake can be easily reached in about 15 minutes by\n\ntaking the Savena Valley Road in the direction of Monghidoro.\n\nIn the 1950s, along the so-called “Via dei Mulini” (Mill Way) in the municipalities of Loiano and\n\nMonghidoro, there were no less than 36 mills, which used the power of the Savena river to grind\n\ncereals and chestnuts into high quality flour. Near Lodole Country House, in addition to the\n\nbeautifully renovated “Molino del Pero” mill, which now houses the local golf club house, there is\n\nalso the “Mulino di Mazzone”, the only water mill in the area that is still in working condition. Built\n\nin 1785, the interiors of the “Mazzone” mill are still exactly the same as they were when first built\n\nand much of the grinding machinery is original too. The miller’s house is still there, as is the\n\nstable, a wood-fired oven and a series of rooms containing the millstones for the different types of\n\ncereal. The Mulino Mazzone currently belongs to the Sazzini family from Piamaggio, who are happy\n\nto open it on Saturdays and Sundays if visitors first make a reservation.\n\nAt the end of the 1980 the Emilia Romagna Regional Authorities officially named this stretch of\n\nhills a Protected Area in order to preserve the memory of the events that took place here and to\n\nlaunch a message of peace to raise awareness especially among young people and safeguard the\n\nenvironmental heritage. The area stretches for over 6,000 hectares across the Bolognese\n\nApennines and through the municipalities of Marzabotto, Monzuno and Grizzana Morandi. The\n\nMonte Sole Historical Park is situated on the site of the Marzabotto massacre that took place in\n\nSeptember 1944.\n\nMonte Sole is the only historical park of its kind in Italy and it includes 5 fascinating trails:\n\n· the Memorial trail is the most important as it passes through all the localities where the Nazi\n\nmassacres took place;\n\n· for trekking, mountain bike and horseriding lovers, the nature trail is a splendid way to\n\ndiscover the natural beauty of these hills;\n\n· the Montovolo trail follows in the footsteps of the pilgrims who once walked through these\n\nhills on their way to Rome or Florence;\n\n· the Etruscan trail explores the ancient origins of this area by visiting sites like the Marzabotto\n\nArchaeological Area, the first human settlement in these parts;\n\n· last of all, is the fascinating Giorgio Morandi trail that shows how the famous Grizzana-born\n\nartist was inspired by the places he lived in as a child and how he immortalised them in his\n\npaintings.\n\nThe Rocchetta Mattei is a castle of great charm located in the town of Grizzana Morandi, only 20\n\nkm from Lodole Country House and enchants the eyes of those who pass along the 64 statale\n\nPorrettana roadroad. The fortress was built in the mid nineteenth century by Count Cesare Mattei,\n\nwho made it his residence and the center of elettromeopatica medicine. The peculiarity of the\n\ncastle, built in medieval and Moorish styles, features the Rocchetta Mattei according oriental\n\nimpression that stands out as unique in the Apennine environment. It has been use as an hotel\n\nfrom the sixties until the late eighties and then was abandoned since 2005. In that year the\n\nRocchetta Mattei was owned by the Foundation of the Bologna Cassa di Risparmio. After a long\n\ndesign study it began the restoration of the 2/3 of the total. Since August 2015, the partly restored,\n\nis open to the public. For information call from Tuesday to Thursday 3:00 pm/6:00 pm tel. + 39 051916 845.\n\nIn the middle ages the area surrounding Bologna was dominated by noble and upper middle class\n\nfamilies seeking for power. To demonstrate their prestige and impose their authority on the local\n\nlandscape these families often built themselves lavish residences in the form of spectacular\n\ncastles. These castles stretch right across the Bologna Province and the most notable examples\n\n(many of which are open to the public) are listed below.\n\nROCCHETTA MATTEI\n\nThe Rocchetta Mattei castle is an enchanting structure located near the village of Ponte in the\n\nMunicipality of Grizzana Morandi, just 20 km away from Lodole Country House. And anyone\n\ndriving up the Porrettana State Highway (SS64) through the splendid Bolognese Apennines cannot\n\nfail to fall under its spell. The castle was built as a private residence and rest home in the mid 19C\n\nby Count Cesare Mattei, the founder of Electro-Homeopathy. The fascinating architecture of the\n\nstructure combines medieval and Moorish styles that give the building a distinctive oriental feel\n\nthat contrasts spectacularly with the surrounding hills. In the 1960s the Rocchetta Mattei castle\n\nwas converted into a luxury hotel but in the 1980s it was abandoned and fell into neglect. The\n\nbuilding is now the property of the Fondazione della Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna who are\n\ncurrently restoring it.\n\nTHE ROCCA DEI BENTIVOGLIO\n\nOriginally built as a defence against the barbarians over a thousand years ago, the Rocca dei\n\nBentivoglio castle still stands just 25 km from Bologna in the municipality of Bazzano overlooking\n\nthe splendid landscapes of the Bolognese Apennines. The current layout of the castle dates back\n\nto the ascendancy of the Bentivoglio family who used the castle as a country residence. The castle\n\nfeatures a number of frescoed rooms decorated with crests and symbols representing the story of\n\nthis famous Bolognese family and is also home to the Municipal Media Library, an Archaeological\n\nMuseum and the Rocca dei Bentivoglio Foundation.\n\nPALATA PEPOLI CASTLE\n\nThe Pepoli family originally built this castle with its central tower in 1500 as a hunting lodge and\n\ncountry residence at the heart of the family’s lands. The castle is situated in the village of Palata\n\nPepoli, in the Municipality of Crevalcore, just 30 km outside Bologna. Today the castle is still private\n\nproperty and the owners are currently helping with the restoration of the building.\n\nTHE SAN MARTINO CASTLE IN SOVERZANO\n\nThis castle complete with its military defences of moats, battlements and towers was built by\n\nCavaliere Manzoli in 1400 as an aristocratic residence and is surrounded by a vast park and\n\nancient woods. On the first Saturday and Sunday of October the park is home to an important\n\nfestival that has been held there since the 1500s. The San Martino Castle is located in the\n\ncountryside outside Soverzano, in the Municipality of Minerbio, just 18 km outside Bologna. The\n\ncastle is currently a private residence and can only be viewed from the outside.\n\nTHE ROCCA SFORZESCA CASTLE IN DOZZA\n\nThe ancient Rocca Sforzesca castle dates back to the middle ages and overlooks the characteristic\n\nstructure of a small hamlet that has remained unchanged over the centuries. Dozza is a\n\npicturesque village located midway between Bologna and Imola, and is famous the world over for\n\nboth its splendid castle and “Biennale del Muro Dipinto” (Biennial Mural Festival). The original\n\ncastle was restructured in 1400 by Caterina Sforza who altered the military structure of the\n\nfortress and turned it into a graceful aristocratic residence with a series of imposing rooms and\n\nhalls facing onto a majestic, central courtyard. Today the castle is home to the Emilia Romagna\n\nRegional Wine Store, an association responsible for the promotion and protection of local wines\n\n(free admission), and a Mural Documentation and Study Centre featuring some of the best work\n\nfrom the artists who have taken part in the Biennial Mural Festival over the years (Guided tour\n\nadmission only, for more info: tel. 0542 678240).\n\nTHE GIOVANNINA CASTLE\n\nThe Giovannina Castle is a beautiful country residence built by the Bentivoglio family at the end of\n\nthe 1400s. Located in the village of San Matteo della Decima in the municipality of San Giovanni in\n\nPersiceto, just 30 km from Bologna, the castle takes its name from the road in which it is situated.\n\nFour classic, crenellated tours and typically medieval battlements give the house a majestic,\n\nmilitary air that is enhanced by the splendid park and ancient woods that surround it. Its interiors\n\ninclude prestigious frescoes by Guercino and numerous priceless antiques that all contribute to\n\nmaking this structure one of the most refined and picturesque castles in the whole province. The\n\nGiovannina castle is privately owned and franchised to a catering company who use it for\n\nimportant events such as weddings and conferences."
