The Spring serves as the home of Faron, the second of the Spirits of Light.\n\nFeatures and Overview[]\n\nWhen Link first walks into the Faron Spring as a Wolf, the Light Spirit Faron will ask that the young hero defeat the Shadow Insects and retrieve the Tears of Light from them, in order to return light to the area and thus restore Faron's powers.[2] After doing so, Link will awaken already wearing the Hero's Clothes, revealing to be the hero chosen by the gods who will save Hyrule from its Ganon.[3]\n\nLike the rest of the Spirit Springs, Link can walk into the Spring to have his health slowly recovered merely by stepping into its water. In the Cave of Ordeals, when Link reaches the 20th floor, the Great Fairy will reward the young hero by releasing recovery Fairies into the Faron Spring.[1] Reaching the last floor of the Cave will allow Link to talk to the Great Fairy at the spring and receive unlimited Great Fairy's Tears, provided that he does not already have a Bottle full of them.[4]\n\nNomenclature[]\n\nNames in Other Regions Language Name FrenchEU Source de Firone Italian Sorgente di Firone\n\nSee Also[]\n\nOrdon Spring\n\nEldin Spring\n\nSpring of the Spirit Lanayru\n\nReferences"
