        "text": "Some sit on the edges of cliffs overlooking the sea, others are framed by enchanted forests, and others can be found atop alpine peaks. There are more than 20,000 castles in Italy, imposing fortifications that are often rich in artistic treasures, found along the entire length of the “boot,” from north to south. There are ancient strongholds, military forts, and portions of defensive city walls. Each is unique, though all bear witness to long and complicated histories, often shrouded in mystery. These places are the guardians of secrets, evoking fairy tales and legends of lords, ladies, and knights. The preservation of these castles in Italy is entrusted to the Istituto Italiano Castelli (the Italian Institute of Castles), a cultural organisation committed to this immense cultural heritage. Here are the most fascinating castles as selected by AD.\n\nSant’Angelo Castle, Rome\n\nCompleted in 139 CE at the orders of Emperor Hadrian to serve as his mausoleum, the structure was converted to a castle in the fifth century. Today it is one of the most iconic buildings of Rome. Its history is closely linked to that of the capital: though it began as a sepulchre, it then became the coveted seat of Roman families competing to control the city, and later a refuge during times of war for the popes. The Secret Castle tours allow you to discover the most mysterious parts of the castle: the dungeons, the Passetto di Borgo (a passage that links the castle to the Vatican City), and the Stufetta, or private bath, of Clement VII. Two millennia of history unfold before your eyes as you pass from one room to the next in this spectacular building, one of the few structures from ancient Rome to have survived, largely intact, to the present day.\n\nAlso read: This glorious heritage hotel in Udaipur basks in the glow of the City Palace\n\nCastelvecchio and its bridge, Verona, Veneto\n\nVerona’s Castelvecchio, or “the old castle,” appears like the quintessential castle of our imaginations, with its towers, fortified walls, a moat filled with water from the Adige River, ever-present drawbridges, and its fortified bridge that crosses the river, protected by the castle’s keep. It’s a must-see in Verona, the city’s most important military construction. Originally called San Martino Castle, it was built during the 14th century at the behest of the della Scala family (and specifically Cangrande II della Scala), who wanted to protect themselves from both popular uprisings and enemy sieges. Over the centuries this imposing castle has been the scene of many events that have shaped the history of the city and Italy more broadly. Today, it houses the Castelvecchio Museum, restored in the 1950s by Carlo Scarpa; its collection includes works by Pisanello, Veronese, Tintoretto, Mantegna, and other great artists. Throughout the castle, you’ll be immersed in the medieval atmosphere that will transport you back in time.\n\nRocca Albornoziana, Spoleto, Umbria\n\nThe majestic Rocca Albornoziana dominates Sant’Elia Hill in the beautiful town of Spoleto in Umbria. Construction began in 1359, at the order of Pope Innocent VI as he attempted to reassert his control over Italy after the papacy’s exile in Avignon, France. (It would be used by the Spanish cardinal Egidio Albornoz, hence the name.) The project was entrusted to Matteo di Giovannello da Gubbio. The castle was both a defensive fortress and an elegant residence that could host illustrious personages. Until the 16th century, it welcomed popes, governors, lords, and even Lucrezia Borgia, who stayed there on several occasions. Over the years, it also became the residence of the city’s governors and papal legates. It was enriched with decorations and frescoes, many of which were lost beginning in 1816 and during the years that followed when it was turned into a prison. (It would operate as a prison until 1982.) The Salone d'Onore (Hall of Honour), the largest room, is used for ceremonies and banquets, while the Camera Pinta, which preserves two beautiful fresco cycles dating from between the 14th and 15th centuries, is among the most remarkable in central Italy. Protected by six imposing towers and rectangular in shape, the castle has two courtyards, the Cortile delle Armi (Weapons Courtyard), originally home to the armed militia, and the Cortile d’Onore (Courtyard of Honour), reserved for governors and other officials. To enjoy the view of Spoleto and the surrounding green hills, one can walk the Giro della Rocca, a one-kilometre path through the grounds of the castle.\n\nCaccamo Castle, Palermo, Sicily\n\nAccording to legend, the ghost of Matteo Bonello, one of the earliest residents of Caccamo Castle, still roams its halls. This is where he was brutally murdered by one of his enemies, King William I of Sicily (also known as William the Bad or William the Wicked). Tales and myth intertwine in the history of the imposing castle which, situated atop a rock outcropping, dominates the landscape. It is one of the largest and best-preserved fortresses in all of Sicily. Caccamo is also the name of the medieval town where the castle is found, 520 metres above sea level in the province of Palermo. To reach it, you’ll climb a stone staircase—as you walk up it you may feel like you’re returning to the Middle Ages as you follow in the footsteps of the many knights who have passed the same way over the centuries. Originally built as a defensive fortress, the castle later underwent various interventions that transformed it into an opulent residence for the Sicilian nobles who ruled this part of the island.\n\nAlso read: 9 buildings with the most-satisfying symmetry, including two in India\n\nCastel del Monte, Andria, Apulia\n\nOne of Italy's most intriguing castles is back in the spotlight after Alessandro Michele, Gucci’s creative director, chose to unveil his new collection in this magical location this spring. Commissioned in 1240 by Emperor Frederick II of Swabia, Castel del Monte is a fortress atop a hill 540 metres above sea level in the town of Andria, 60 kilometres from Bari in Apulia. Added to UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites in 1996, the castle is famous for its octagonal shape: At each of the octagon’s eight points there’s a tower, also an octagon, made of quartz and local limestone. The castle is a magical place: The structure follows a geometric design reminiscent of a labyrinth, full of symbolism and meanings that have fascinated scholars, and the entire castle is a synthesis of refined mathematical, geometric, and astronomical knowledge. The octagonal shape represents an intermediate figure between the square, a symbol of the Earth, and the circle, representing the infinite sky. It thus represents the passage from one world to another. The construction is also imbued with astronomical significance. It is said to have been designed so that on solstice and equinox days the shadows created by the walls fall in a particular direction.\n\nScaliger Castle in Sirmione, Lombardy\n\nThe Scaliger Castle in Sirmione is an extraordinary example of a lakeside fortification and, specifically, the most spectacular and best preserved of several castle that are on or near Lake Garda. Built in the late 14th century, it takes its name from the della Scala family who ruled over Verona and its territories for much of the 13th and 14th centuries. The castle still has a protected harbour that was once a shelter for the ships of the della Scala fleet—the only surviving example in the world of a 14th-century fortified port. Don't miss a visit to the dungeons where it is possible to see some portions of the Monastery of St. Salvatore that once stood where the castle is now.\n\nAragonese Castle, Ischia, Campania\n\nConnected to the village of Celsa by the Ischia Bridge, the first castle on this site was built in 474 BCE by Hieron I, known as the tyrant of Syracuse. The islet atop which that and later castles stood was probably formed around 300,000 years ago following a volcanic eruption. The castle took on its present form in 1441, when Alfonso V of Aragon ordered that the walls be reinforced to defend against pirate raids. The castle and the island that it protected reached their most splendid stage in the 16th and 17th centuries when an estimated 2,000 families lived there. During the Napoleonic Wars, following British shelling of the then-French-occupied castle, it was almost completely abandoned. Today traces of some 25 centuries of history can be found in the ruins of the island’s churches, convents, prisons, and gardens. Despite the passage of time, the belvedere, suspended between sky and sea, still awes visitors.\n\nScaliger Castle of Malcesine, Veneto\n\nA second Scaliger Castle on Lake Garda also makes our list. This one, on the Veneto side of the lake in Malcesine, enchanted even Goethe who wrote about it in his book Italian Journey. While there may have been a fortification at this location in the first millennium BCE, the earliest reliable evidence of a castle dates to the first millennium CE when there are historical records of the Franks destroying, and then rebuilding, one here. The castle took the name Castello Scaligero, or Scaliger Castle, in 1277, when it became the property of Alberto della Scala, a member of the della Scala family who ruled Verona in the 13th and 14th centuries. An Italian national monument, the castle now houses the Natural History Museum, located on the ground floor. Highlights of a visit to the castle include the powder magazine built by the Austrians, now called Goethe Hall; the Scaliger Chapel; and the Lacaòr, right outside the castle gate, which was once part of a protohistoric settlement. There are stunning panorama views of Malcesine, Lake Garda, and the western slopes of Mount Baldo from the castle tower.\n\nAlso read: 17 of Europe's most beautiful bakeries\n\nCastel dell’Ovo, Naples\n\nOn Megaride, once an island but now a peninsula which was the location of the original ancient Greek settlement that would eventually become Naples, the Castel dell’Ovo is a symbol of the splendour and history of the city. The castle also has enviable views of the Bay of Naples and Mount Vesuvius. In the 19th century a fishing village, Borgo Marinari, was established in the shadow of the castle. It’s one of the most scenic spots in Naples. Castel dell’Ovo is the oldest castle in Naples with a history that can be traced back to the first century BCE when an earlier castle was built on the site of today’s fortification. Later Roger the Norman, who conquered Naples in 1140, would order the construction of a castle here to serve as the seat of his court. In the subsequent centuries it would be used as a prison and treasury at various points. In 1975, an extensive renovation restored the castle to its current appearance.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nTabiano Castle, Salsomaggiore Terme, Emilia-Romagna\n\nScenic and enchanting, set in the green countryside near the ancient hamlet of Salsomaggiore Terme, Tabiano Castle has been transformed into a charming inn. A meticulous renovation respected the castle’s history and ties to the surrounding region while also focusing on environmental sustainability. Lemon and pomegranate trees and rose bushes surround the buildings, while the estate also has two swimming pools and a wellness centre housed in a natural grotto. From the outside, it may appear like nothing has changed with the passage of time but today the old farmers’ and craftsmen’s lodgings have been transformed into guest rooms and comfortable flats.\n\nRocca Calascio, Abruzzo\n\nThe Rocca Calascio in Abruzzo has been used as a location for numerous films, including Ladyhawke in 1985 and, more recently, The American starring George Clooney. The dramatic hilltop fortification is made of white stone and consists of a central keep, a crenelated circle of stone walls, and four corner towers with circular bases. Its mountaintop location in the Gran Sasso National Park is at an altitude of 1,460 metres and it dominates the Tirino Valley and the Plain of Navelli. The castle’s location made it invaluable as a military observation point that then communicated with other nearby watchtowers and castles as far as the Adriatic. The castle’s construction dates to the 10th century though it was expanded and altered many times until 1703, when the damage from an earthquake led to its being abandoned.\n\nMelfi Castle, Potenza\n\nOne of the most important mediaeval buildings of its kind, Melfi Castle, in the province of Potenza, dates to the Norman period and was built in the 11th century at the behest of Robert Guiscard and later enlarged by Frederick II in the 13th century. New towers were added by Charles I of Anjou and it was further modified by the Caracciolo and Doria families. Ten impressive towers (seven rectangular and three pentagonal) are located around the permitter of the castle, which has four access gates. In the main courtyard, you can admire the baronial palace and the noble chapel. The castle is home to the Museo Archeologico Nazionale del Melfese (the National Archaeological Museum of Melfi) where one of the highlights is a splendid Roman sarcophagus found in 1856."
