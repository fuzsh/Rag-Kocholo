        "text": "Two mountain ranges dominate the region. The ancient Iberian range bisects the area from the north west to the south east. The younger Bética formation extends from the south to Cap de la Nao. This younger limestone has distinctive, high rocks like the Peñon de Ifach crag, a climber's paradise. Where these mountain ranges meet the sea, they create a dramatic landscape of high cliffs, hidden coves and beaches  and offshore reef  a rich habitat for sea life.\n\nValencias famous beaches break up these rugged capes. These wide, kilometre-long stretches of fine sand are one of the main reasons people visit the area. But behind them is something most tourists dont notice. Large wetlands of brackish water separate some beaches from the mainland. These well irrigated areas are great for growing rice for Valencias famous paellas, but their reed beds are also ideal breeding grounds for resident and visiting migratory birds. Valencia is one of the most popular locations for bird watchers during the migrating seasons.\n\nBeyond reed beds, theres a wide range of flora in the region. In the north, deeply wooded valleys of pine and oak trees are interspersed with high moorland covered with juniper bushes. Closer to the coast youll walk through a typical Mediterranean garrigue of thyme, rosemary and other fragrant herbs. In total, youll find more than 3,000 different species of plants and trees within the region, many unique to the area.\n\nHistory\n\nThanks to its gorgeous geographic assets, the Valencian Region has been settled for many thousands of years. Artefacts and paintings discovered in the Parpalló Cave in Gandia indicate that small groups of hunter-gatherers were active in the area some 29,000 years BCE.\n\nGreeks and Phoenicians set up small communities and trading settlements in Valencia as they established the first maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean. Even these small communities left a permanent mark on the land: ancient terraces built more than two thousand years ago still line the rocky valleys near Jalón in Alicante.\n\nLittle trace remains of the Visigoths, who occupied Valencia after the collapse of the Roman empire in the 4th century CE. The same can't be said for the Moors: the Muslim invasion in the 8th century marked a dramatic turning point for the region. Under five centuries of Arab rule, Valencia prospered. There were large advances in irrigation techniques (see the palm plantations of Elche), rice cultivation, paper manufacture in Xátiva, and centers of learning in Denia and Valencia."
