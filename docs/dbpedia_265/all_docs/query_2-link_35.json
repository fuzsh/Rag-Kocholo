        "text": "In August 2006, Jay Riola had just graduated from Trinity University in San Antonio and completed three internships over two years. He was living at his mom’s house in Denver and working as a counselor at the Denver Nuggets’ Bill Hanzlik Hoops Camp when he got the call from the Orlando Magic … to be an intern.\n\nThe callers were Anthony Perez, the team’s business development manager, and Charlie Freeman, vice president of business development and strategy (both eventual Forty Under 40 honorees). The gig, which provided a stipend, was more aligned with his career goals than his previous internships — unpaid at Kroenke Sports; a gopher for the San Antonio Spurs at the Finals; and with USA Basketball, where he slept in the dorms with the players. The self-proclaimed “NBA junkie,” who has played basketball his entire life, said that “Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game” had shown him that the sports analytics career he wanted was realistic.\n\nHe packed up the 1998 blue Honda Accord that he had since high school, made the nearly 2,000-mile drive to Maitland, Fla., and moved in with four other team interns across the street from the team’s business office.\n\nHe was named a full-time employee at the conclusion of his internship, and his role has grown steadily ever since.\n\nAfter his revenue management strategies were implemented in 2012, the club’s single-game ticket revenue has grown by 80%, and over the past two years sponsorship revenue has grown 18%."
