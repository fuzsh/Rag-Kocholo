        "text": "The “Internazionali d’Italia MX” came to an end at Riola Sardo. In the MX1 another 4th place Overall gave Forato the silver medal. In the MX2 Adamo was not lucky, who was excellent until lap 10; “top 10” result for Tuani instead. In the “Supercampione” race good performance for Forato who finished 5th Overall.\n\nRiola Sardo, in Oristano province, hosted the second and last round of the “Internazionali d’Italia MX”. The circuit where the event took place was the technical “Le Dune” track, which is featured by soft sand that can be deep and insidious and put to test riders and bikes.\n\nAs in the first round, Andrea Adamo #80 (MX2), Federico Tuani #3 (MX2) and Alberto Forato #303 (MX1) were deployed by SM Action GasGas Racing Team Yuasa Battery, which went to the second round of the championship with confidence after the good debut at Alghero.\n\nIn the MX2 Timed Practice, which was scheduled in the morning, Andrea made an excellent performance as he finished 3rd fastest. Good result for Federico too, who finished in P9. In the Top Class, Alberto showed again to be in good shape as he finished 5th, fastest Italian rider on track and first behind the “top riders” who race in the World Championship with official bikes.\n\nMX2 Race 1 start was superb for Andrea as he positioned straight away in 3rd position. Good start for Federico too as he entered in the “top 10” in P8. After the first half of the race, Andrea was in 2nd place and was following the leader, while Federico swung between P7 and P8. Unfortunately though, during lap 10, Adamo had contact with another rider and both fell on the ground: Andrea had the worst of it and he restarted in 5th place. Meanwhile, Federico gave up one place and he was 9th. Andrea tried his best to recover during the final part of the race, but another crash forced him to give up and he finished 12th. Federico, instead, after that he was 9th he managed to come back to P8. The Championship finished with both teammates next to each other in the standing, with Adamo in 8th position and Tuani in 9th.\n\nIn MX1 Race 1 Alberto had a great start from the gates as he finished lap 1 in P5. After four laps Alberto took advantage of a crash that happened to one of his opponents and he moved to P4. The rider from Veneto kept the place until lap 10, when he was overtaken, and moved back to P5, a place that he then kept until the checkered flag. Thanks to this result, Alberto finished 2nd in the Championship and won the silver medal.\n\nIn the “Supercampione” race the start was good for all SM Action GasGas Racing Team Yuasa Battery riders: Adamo was in P5, Forato in P6 and Tuani in P13. Everything seemed to be ok but during lap 5 Andrea made a mistake and was forced to retire. Alberto kept the 4th position until lap 9 but then he felt some fatigue and he had to slow down a little, finishing the race in P6. Federico, who was in 14th place until lap 10, gave up a few places in the final moments of the race and he finished in P18. Forato was the only rider to be in the standings of this Championship and he finished in 5th place.\n\nThere will be only one week of stop after this brief period of racing for the “Internazionali d’Italia MX”: on the 19th and the 20th of February, the teams and the riders will travel to England where the 2022 FIM Motocross World Championship will start its journey at the amazing circuit of Matterley Basin.\n\nAlberto Forato #303: “I struggled a lot with my arms hardening at Riola. After 5th place in Qualifying, I made it to P4 (MX1) and P6 (Supercampione). From the physical point of view, it was not a good weekend, as I was quick enough but I wasn’t able to ride the way I wanted to. After all, we are focusing on what was positive and we look forward to the beginning of the World Championship in England”."
