        "text": "Spirit Springs are locations in Twilight Princess.[name reference needed] They serve as the home of the four Spirits of Light, who each protect a province of Hyrule.\n\nFeatures and Overview[]\n\nThere are four Spirit Spring located throughout Hyrule, situated in the four major provinces: Ordon Spring, Faron Spring, Eldin Spring, and Spring of the Spirit Lanayru, all named after its respective province and Spirit of Light.\n\nDuring the events of the game, the Spirit Spring of Faron, Eldin, and Lanayru are all invaded by Shadow Beasts, who attack the Light Spirits and promptly steal their power, thus causing Twilight to cover the area. With the exception of the Ordon Spring, which is where Link learns of Hyrule's fate, the Spirit Spring are where Link receives the Vessel of Light from the Light Spirit guarding that area. Here, he is tasked to retrieve all of the Tears of Light located within its respective province.[1] Once Link returns to the Spirit Spring with the complete Vessel of Light, the province's light will be restored, allowing the young hero to return to his Hylian form. After this, Link can walk into any of the Spirit Spring to have his health slowly recovered merely by stepping into the water.\n\nIn the Cave of Ordeals, after every ten floors, the Great Fairy appears and grants the power of Fairies to each Spirit Spring, serving as the game's Fairy Fountains.[2] Reaching the last floor of the cave will allow Link to talk to the Great Fairy in each spring and receive unlimited Great Fairy's Tears, provided that he does not already have a Empty Bottle full of them.[3]\n\nNomenclature[]\n\nNames in Other Regions Language Name Meaning Japanese 精霊の泉 (Seirei no Izumi) Spirit Spring\n\nGallery[]\n\nOrdon Spring\n\nEldin Spring\n\nLanayru Spring\n\nSee Also[]\n\nOrdon Spring\n\nFaron Spring\n\nEldin Spring\n\nSpring of the Spirit Lanayru"
