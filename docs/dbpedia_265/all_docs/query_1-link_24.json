        "text": "The province of Oristano is a province of Sardinia of about 159 thousand inhabitants, consisting of 87 municipalities. The provincial territory was defined and established only in 1974. The provincial territory is very varied, from the enormous plain of Campidano (which also extends into the province of South Sardinia) to the mountain complex of \"Monte Ferru\" that occupies much of the north-western part of the province. The diversity of the territory is also present along the coast where white sand beaches alternate with limestone cliffs. A few kilometers from the coast is also the island of Mal di Ventre completely flat, but uninhabited. Also important is the presence of ponds, fundamental for biodiversity as they are the habitat of different species of birds. The province of Oristano, like most of the Sardinian provinces, has been inhabited since the Neolithic age and this is attested by a series of findings that are now some of the most important archaeological sites in the territory. Another curiosity about this province is the presence of several protected natural areas such as: the natural park of Mount Acre, the establishment of the marine protected area Isola del Sinis - Isola di Mal di Ventre and S'Archittu a small arch formed by marine erosion. Also in this province, as in all the other Sardinian provinces, tourism is mainly summer thanks to the presence of numerous beaches and coves. Below I will tell you about the most beautiful places from the point of view of tourism / real estate.\n\n- The most attractive town from the point of view of real estate is Oristano, the provincial capital of the same name, located in the northern part and in the plain of Campidano. This town has ancient origins and had a great importance in the Middle Ages, in fact it was long the capital of the \"Giudicato di Arborea\" one of the four independent states that were formed in Sardinia after the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire. Its historical importance makes it a city rich in monuments and sites of historical interest, just know that there are thirteen civil architecture and 30 religious structures. In the provincial territory, this town has a strategic position, in fact it is located near the coast and therefore close to most of the sites of tourist interest for seaside tourism. Particular also the presence of the Stragno di Cabràs surrounded on all sides by a series of museums and farms. From the real estate point of view, buying a property in Oristano is possible, thanks to a high number of offers of sale, although some of these do not mainly concern the city center, but some neighboring municipalities. In particular: for a villa of 145 m2 the price is about 330.000€; for a rustic-house the average price is about 22.000€; for a detached house the price varies from 20.000€ to 50.000€.\n\nIn this province, the capital contains a large part of the real estate landscape, from the point of view of tourism, however, the sites of interest are different and are almost always located along the coast"
