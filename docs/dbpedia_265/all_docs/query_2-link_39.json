        "text": "The Agriturismo Bellu 1 was set up at the end of the 1980s following the complete restoration of a three-storey old stone manor house dating from 1800. Today, in full view throughout the building, you can still see the ancient sandstone load-bearing arches, used back in the day for constructing buildings with several storeys, with great decorative effect.\n\nOn the ground floor, in addition to rooms for Liliana and Gabrieleâ€™s family, there is a kitchen and a small room where breakfast and dinner are served in the winter months. In summer, on the other hand, guests can enjoy breakfast in the large garden at the back of the building. The first and second floors are home to 6 bedrooms, doubles and triples, some of which are en-suite and have air-conditioning.\n\nThe agriturismo Bellu 2 welcomes its guests in the countryside near Riola Sardo, just 4 km from the town. The building consists of a main section with a large, air-conditioned dining room seating about 90, where breakfast and dinner are served during the summer months. The room can also accommodate small ceremonies.\n\nThe 6 bedrooms, all very spacious, are only a short distance from the dining room: immersed in the vegetation, they are arranged in two small rows facing each other. All have private entrances and en-suite bathrooms, mosquito nets, air-conditioning and safety deposit boxes. A single bed or bunk bed can be added to the double rooms and almost all have a TV. On the small veranda outside the rooms, there are refrigerators for guests to share.\n\nOne of the rooms is equipped for disabled guests."
