        "meta_description": "La Rioja is a region which is very famous for its wines; these wines are delicious due to the fertile lands of La Rioja, which are watered by seven rivers, including the Ebro River. The region is generally dry, even arid, but the Mediterranean influences are felt; as you go to the north, you will be stunned by the beauty of the landscapes guarded by the high mountains.  La Rioja has a very interesting history; the 10th century brought a dispute between the Navarre and the Castilla Kings who wanted to rule over Logrono. Henry I, King of England, put an end to the dispute, by awarding the city to Castilla. Napoleon and its forces took it under their control until 1814, when the region gained its independence. However, this independence was not recognized until Francisco Franco died. Logrono, the capital of La Rioja The La Rioja province has Logrono as its capital. The most important aspect of Logrono is that it represents the main wine market of the region, as the main activity is the grape cultivation and wine production. The city is actually a river port, situated on the Ebro River. Even though it has a modern scent and aspect, there are old places in the city which still hide the beauties of the past. The Church of Santa Maria Palacio, dating back to the 11th century, is very popular among tourists who choose to visit it attracted by its Gothic spire, which also has several Romanesque details. The Puente Piedra Bridge is annually crossed by the pilgrims who try to make their way to the tomb belonging to Saint James. Haro Haro is the city which can be considered the wine capital; if you want to taste a fine wine, with a unique flavor, visit Haro. The Romans were the ones who first started to produce wine in Haro and the tradition is still kept today. If you are really passionate about wine, visit the Wine Museum; there, you will find out more interesting details about its production and its history. San Millan Cogolla This town is very popular among the religious; pilgrims from all over the country visit it attracted by the story of Saint Emilian, who is thought to have made a lot of miracles possible. Visit the La Rioja province and I assure you the experience will be an unforgettable one.",
