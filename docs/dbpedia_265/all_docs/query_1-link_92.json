        "text": "Looking for the best day trips from Bologna? You’ve come to the right place!\n\nLocated in Northern Italy, Bologna is the capital of the Emilia-Romagna region, which is known for incredible Italian cuisine and stunning medieval architecture. While there’s no shortage of wonderful things to do in Bologna, the city’s central location makes it convenient for amazing day trips within a 1-2.5 hour train ride.\n\nWe’ve spent over 2.5 months in Bologna and the surrounding region discovering all of the best cities and towns to visit. In this guide, we’ve split up the day trips by region to help you easily decide the perfect day trip for you!\n\nWe’re also sharing how to get to each destination, personal tips on the best things to do, and a guide on how to navigate your way around the region.\n\nHere is our list of the 23 best day trips from Bologna, Italy.\n\nDon’t have time to read it all? Here are the top 5 day trips from Bologna that we recommend.\n\nBest foodie day trip: Modena or Parma\n\nBest artsy day trip: Ravenna\n\nBest cultural day trip: Mantua or Padua\n\nBest countryside day trip: Dozza or Brisighella\n\nBest car lovers day trip: Maranello\n\nDay Trips from Bologna to Veneto\n\n1. Verona\n\nTravel time:\n\nDistance from Bologna by car: 1h 45min\n\nDistance from Bologna by train: 52min to 1h 30min\n\nVerona is one of the most beautiful cities in Italy and is an easy day trip from Bologna. With its stunning medieval architecture, idyllic location along the Adige river, and historical sights, it’s hard not to fall in love with Verona.\n\nThe first time we visited Verona was on a Bologna day trip, and we loved it so much that we ended up going back and spending a month there.\n\nAll of the sights around Verona are within walking distance, so you don’t need to worry about public transportation.\n\nStart your day at the Verona Arena, a spectacular 1st century Roman amphitheater. You can take a tour inside of the arena, or if you are visiting during the summer, attend an opera performance in the evening.\n\nThe annual Opera festival is held every year from June to September and is one of the most incredible events in Italy.

It’s quicker and you have the opportunity to visit a few Tuscan towns nearby – like San Gimignano and Monteriggioni.\n\nExplore the streets of this medieval city and grab a gelato to enjoy in Il Campo – the enormous piazza in Siena. Or climb the Torre del Mangia (city tower) for an incredible view of Siena and the hills surrounding the city.\n\nOne of my favorite sites in Siena is the cathedral.

It’s located just a little over 2 hours away by train from Bologna and is one of our favorite cities in the region.\n\nOne of our top things to do in Lucca is to rent a bike and ride around the city’s walls! It takes about an hour to go around and is a fun activity to see the city from a new perspective.\n\nKnown as the “City of 100 churches”, wander around the streets and discover the city’s many churches like San Paolino and Basilica di San Frediano.\n\nAfterwards, you can take a rest and enjoy a drink at the lovely Piazza dell’Anfiteatro, a square that is in the shape of a Roman amphitheater.\n\nFor the best views of the city, climb the 233 steps to the top of the Torre Guinigi. A 14th century tower with oak trees growing from top! The panoramic views from the top of the tower are fantastic.\n\nWhile there are many incredible restaurants in Lucca, we suggest stopping for lunch at In Pasta – Cibo e Convivio.

Take your time to walk around the fortresses and climb the three towers atop the hill for beautiful views of San Marino\n\nThere is only one street that leads up to the city of San Marino, but you’ll find plenty of cafes and shops around here and the Piazza Della Liberta.\n\nPlan your Bologna to San Marino Day Trip\n\nHow Much Time in San Marino: With transportation, plan on a full day.\n\nTransportation from Bologna to San Marino:\n\nCar: The best way to get to San Marino from Bologna is by car.

It is enormous and every single room is so intricately decorated that you’ll end up spending more time than you think you need here.\n\nJust when you thought it couldn’t get any better, there is another grand palace in Mantua also known for its frescoed rooms and Renaissance architecture. If you have time, make your way to the Te Palace, which was commissioned for Isabella d’Este in the early 16th century.\n\nInside of the palace, you’ll find beautiful frescoes depicting scenes from classical mythology as well as an extensive collection of paintings, furniture, and sculpture.\n\nBoth the Te Palace and the Ducale Palace are UNESCO World Heritage sites that offer insights into Mantua’s rich culture history.\n\nOther highlights in Mantua include the Rotonda di San Lorenzo, built in the 11th century and featuring fragments of frescoes from the time.

For Milanese risotto, make a reservation at Trattoria Masuelli San Marco for lunch or dinner.\n\nFor the best aperitivo experience, make your way to Navigli, an area by the canals in Milan that’s filled with bars.

However, it is important to note that trains can often be delayed here. We’ve never experienced a significant delay, but it’s a common theme in Italy.\n\nTwo types of trains are available in Italy: regional trains and Frecciarossa (high-speed). The Frecciarossa trains cost more but can absolutely be worth the price to save time.\n\nBologna centrale train station is the main railway station. It’s a 20-mintue walk from center.\n\nHow book train tickets in Italy\n\nYou can either book your train tickets online in advance or at the train station.\n\nThe official website to book trains online in Italy is Trenitalia.com.\n\nWe always suggest booking your tickets at least 3 weeks in advance to get the best prices. For regional trains or very short train rides (under 1 hour), you can usually book the tickets a day of or day before, and the price will be around the same amount.\n\nTips on Italy train travel\n\nHere are a few tips to make your train journey as smooth and enjoyable as possible:\n\nBuy your tickets in advance for the best prices. We recommend booking at least 3 weeks in advance if possible, especially for longer journeys.\n\nDownload the Trenitalia app to get up-to-date information on train timetables and delays. You can book your tickets on the app, and it’s so much easier than buying them online or at the station!

Keep this in mind if you’re having trouble finding a city.\n\nCheck out the various discount schemes available – if you’re traveling with a group or as a student, you may be eligible for reduced fares.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the timetable to help avoid delays and plan connection times.\n\nRenting a car\n\nGenerally speaking, we like to take trains on day trips around Italy because it’s cheaper, more convenient, and usually completely pain-free.\n\nMany Italian cities were built before cars were invented. Therefore, streets are often narrow, and parking is often limited.\n\nHowever, traveling by car is sometimes preferable for certain day trips and for more extended stays.\n\nRenting a car is easy and affordable in Bologna. We rented a car from the Bologna airport for our day trips to Siena and Florence. It cost us about 40 euros + gas, which is less than train tickets would have cost.\n\nThere are two places where you can rent a car in Bologna: the train station or the airport. Because there are more rental options at the airport, it tends to be a bit cheaper than at the train station.\n\nWe suggest renting a car from Discover Cars, our preferred rental car company in Europe.\n\nTo get to the airport, you will take the Marconi Express monorail from the train station. The train runs every 7 minutes throughout the day. You can look at the timetable and book your tickets here.\n\nWhere to Stay in Bologna\n\nYou’ll find many fantastic options for places to stay in Bologna. One thing to note is that there are limited hotels in the center, which means prices can get quite expensive during peak season (June, July, August).\n\nMake sure to book well in advance (at least 2 months) to get the best rates and to have the best available options. Here are a few Bologna hotels that we recommend for your stay:\n\nBest overall Bologna hotel: Art Hotel Commercianti – with a fantastic central location and amazing balcony views from some of the rooms!\n\nBest Bologna luxury hotel: Grand Hotel Majestic gia’ Baglioni\n\nBest Bologna boutique hotel: Casa Bertagni\n\nBest Bologna mid-range hotel: Hotel Touring\n\nBest Bologna hostel: Dopa Hostel\n\nCheck out our guide on the best 11 Boutique Hotels in Bologna for more hotel options.\n\nITALY TRAVEL PLANNING GUIDE\n\nItaly Travel Insurance – Should you get travel insurance for Italy?
