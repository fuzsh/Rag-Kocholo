        "text": "Lake Floria is a recurring location in The Legend of Zelda series.[1][2]\n\nFeatures and Overview[]\n\nSkyward Sword[]\n\nLake Floria is the largest known body of water that exists in the present day on the Surface. It is inhabited by a large range of flora and aquatic creatures. Most of the Lake is composed of large submerged underground caverns which can be explored through the use of the Water Dragon's Scale and the bomb-like Froaks.\n\nLink first discovers the entrance to Lake Floria after completing Farore's Silent Realm. He obtains the Water Dragon's Scale, allowing him to swim underwater, and makes his way up to the top of the canopy of the Great Tree, where he meets the Kikwi Hermit known as Yerbal. He reveals the location of the entrance to Lake Floria.[3]\n\nThe Lake is inhabited by the squid-like Parella tribe, who are protected by the Water Dragon Faron. She was entrusted with a part of the Song of the Hero and protects Farore's Flame.[4] However, shortly before Link arrived, Lake Floria was invaded by Ghirahim and his force of aggressive beasts known as Cranioc,[5] and Faron was injured as a result.[6]\n\nNear the Lake is the Ancient Cistern, a water-themed dungeon where Link can obtain the Whip and Farore's Flame.\n\nMinor Enemies and Traps[]\n\nCranioc\n\nFroak\n\nGreen Chuchu\n\nBreath of the Wild[]\n\nLake Floria is located in West Necluda. Lake Floria is fed by 10 waterfalls of varying sizes to the north,[7] and one from the south.[8] The Lake itself feeds into the Floria River, which runs westward. Lake Floria is bisected by the Floria Bridge, which connects the eastern Ebara Forest with the Sarjon Woods in the west. The Dragon Farosh is frequently seen flying over the Lake.[9][10]\n\nNomenclature[]\n\nLake Floria derives its name from Farore.\n\nNames in other regions LanguageNameMeaningJapaneseフロリア湖 (Furoria Ko) (BotW)Lake FuroriaGermanFloria-See (SS)Same as English.SpanishLALago Faroria (BotW)[11]Lake FaroriaThis table was generated using translation pages.\n\nTo request an addition, please a staff member with a reference.\n\nSee Also[]\n\nAncient Cistern\n\nFloria Bridge\n\nFloria River\n\nReferences"
