        "text": "4. Discussion\n\nThis study was undertaken to provide patterns and spatial distributions of CM to better understand the evolution of age-sex PMRs for cancer over time and space in SA. The vital death statistics data have been of high coverage, especially at the level needed for assessing patterns and mapping. The study findings will contribute towards a reflection on the past, present, and future trends of CM in SA. We are aware that this study did not include the calculation of CM rates, which may estimate the risks of this disease. Most mid-year population estimates in SA are at the regional level and not often given by age-sex groups at the district level. The adopted approach has allowed for the computation of PMRs for cancer by six age-sex groups and the identification of districts presenting high and low CM. The numbers of cancer deaths increased from 1997 to 2004 in all age and sex groups. The increase may be indicative of population growth and better reporting coverage. The numbers of notified and registered cancer deaths continued to increase even from 2004 to 2016, although they declined slightly during specific periods. This may be due to variations in cancer deaths recorded across the districts in SA, which may suggest the variation in the quality and completeness of mortality data. We found disparities in all-cancer mortality in the age-sex groups, with the lowest proportions in children, followed by the elderly population, and the highest in the working-age population. The low CM in the 0–14 year-olds could be explained by the fact that pediatric cancer is underreported in SA. There are about 50% of childhood cancer cases that are not diagnosed in SA (24). The stability of the trend among children in SA probably is due to the lower incidence rate of childhood cancers, even far lower than in developed countries such as the United States. A study done in SA reported the age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) of 45.7 per million children (25), whereas the ASR in high-income countries was 180 per million (26). A study done in Nigeria reported that hematological malignancies accounted for most cancer deaths among children (27). This present study did not assess the pattern of deaths due to hematological malignancies because of the criteria used to select the five leading types of cancer death. However, hematological malignancies were included when the pattern of deaths attributable to all cancers was assessed.\n\nAge is positively correlated with cancer (28). This could explain why cancer contributed to more deaths in the working-age and elderly populations than in children. The improvement of life expectancy in SA after the ART era could be the contributory factor to the high CM in these age categories. Of notable importance, cancer contributed to more deaths among individuals aged 15–64 years than 65+ years. The predominance of cancer deaths among working-age individuals may be due to either age profile of the population or actual disparities in CM rates in SA. The lower CM among the elderly population than working-age individuals signifies that the patients do not live long after they were diagnosed with cancer or cancer cases were successfully treated. Furthermore, there is a long waiting period from screening to initiation of treatment amongst cancer patients in SA. The waiting times for radiation treatment of gynecological and prostate cancers in SA take many weeks. Delaying cancer treatment for more than 12 weeks may be harmful. This delay is caused by the lack of access to care linked with socio-economic status, race, insurance status and urban-rural location, which significantly affect vulnerable groups, namely black Africans, poor, uninsured, and rural residents (19). Another possible explanation is that the patients might have started to seek care from traditional healers before going to cancer centers due to stigma and lack of awareness. This resulted in the presentation of cancer cases at the advanced stage; hence it is often difficult to cure cancer at its advanced stage. More worrisome is the observed increase of CM from 2006 to 2016 in the population aged 15–64 and 65+ years, which calls for the implementation of necessary interventions. The lack of awareness among the general public and healthcare professionals of cancer negatively impacts the number of patients diagnosed and those referred to appropriate services; hence, patients may die from this disease. The avoidance of these cancer deaths may include strengthening awareness, diagnostic capacities, and early treatment (29). The spatial distributions of CM showed differences between districts, indicating disparities in access to health care quality, age distribution, and the burden of cancer disease. Cancer services such as diagnostic, curative, rehabilitative, psycho-social or palliative services in SA are more concentrated in two provinces, namely, Western Cape and Gauteng. Despite the availability of cancer services in the Western Cape and Gauteng provinces, deaths due to cancer predominated in those provinces in 1997. This may be explained by the movement of patients diagnosed with cancer from their under-resourced provinces to the Western Cape and Gauteng to seek care. This increases the number of cancer patients in the well-resourced provinces leading to inadequate staffing ratio, low survival rate, and poor quality of survivorship. This study found the lowest PMR among elderly women in 2006. This suggests that women live longer than men; hence men are highly likely to involve themselves in risky behavioral patterns such as heavy drinking (30), which may contribute to cancer morbidity and mortality. However, women in this age group may die from other conditions that are linked with aging. SA is experiencing demographic, epidemiological, and nutritional transitions contributing to lifestyle-related diseases and mortality, such as cancer. Men and women aged 15–64 and 65+ years are crucial in studying CM and other non-communicable diseases, considering that these age groups are more likely to develop and succumb to these diseases. In addition to the health impact, the findings from this study have some important economic implications.\n\nThe highest mortality was observed in the 15–64-year-olds, the economically active, contributing to the country's economy. In SA, economically reproductive adults are also helpful in the welfare of younger and older age groups. In males and females aged 15–64 years, the high CM may negatively impact the economy. Cancer constituted the majority of deaths in the Western Cape, Northern Cape, North West, and Gauteng in women aged 15–64 years. CM also predominated among men in these provinces, except in North West and Gauteng. The CM preponderance in Western Cape and Gauteng provinces could be due to the high rate of inter-provincial migration among potential job-seekers and employees. Gauteng and Western Cape dominate the economy in SA; hence these provinces are zones of attraction. The in-migrants modify their lifestyles as they move from their places of origin to urbanized places and adapt to urbanization associated with cancer (31). Therefore, patients diagnosed with cancer may die from this disease if untreated. Given an increased unemployment rate in SA, many families depend on old-age pensions for survival; hence the high CM among the 65+ age group may increase poverty in many families. There are over three-quarters of African adults age-eligible for a pension who stay with at least one individual younger than 21 years, and the majority live in households containing three or more generations (32).\n\nThus, the findings presented in this study will assist policymakers by providing empirical evidence to help them make and map policies to narrow the differences in access to quality healthcare services for districts. However, some of these initiatives were implemented, as detailed within the National Cancer Strategic Framework (33). These initiatives aimed to reduce and combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, increase primary health access to families and communities, and achieve universal health care coverage. Overall, the five leading causes of cancer death were similar among the working-age and elderly populations, but some differences were based on ranking and sex. Similar cancer profiles with some insignificant variations in their relative rankings have been reported in SA (7, 34, 35). Lung and esophageal cancers were among the five leading causes of cancer death in both sexes. The high prevalence of smoking in SA could be responsible for lung and esophageal CM patterns in the populace. Hence, smoking is a common risk factor for lung and esophageal cancers (36). The estimated prevalence of smoking in adult men and women in SA is 26.5% and 5.5% (37). Among men, the major contributors to CM in the working-age category were lung and esophageal malignancies, whereas lung and prostate cancers were the leading causes of cancer death in the 65+ age group. Advanced age is associated with prostate cancer (38); this explains the pattern of high CM observed among the 65+ age group. Worldwide, lung and prostate cancers are the two most common cancers that affect men, whereas lung and liver malignancies cause more deaths among males (34). Cancers of the cervix and breast caused the greatest mortality in women aged 15–64 years, while the majority of deaths in elderly women were due to breast and lung malignancies. Interestingly, deaths due to cervix cancer among females aged 15–64 hugely declined from 1997 to 2003 and increased from 2004 to 2016. This signifies that HIV-positive women might have died before developing cervical cancer, but the introduction of ART in SA from 2004 to 2016 has increased the life expectancy, which is long enough to enable the development of cervical cancer. There are projections that the incidence of cervical cancer will sharply increase in SA (39). There is high accessibility, affordability, and availability of ultra-processed food in rural and urban areas in SA. The ultra-processed food consumed is associated with breast cancer (40). Among females worldwide, breast and colon cancers are the top two cancers diagnosed, whereas breast and lung cancers are the leading causes of cancer death (34). The high incidence of this disease may increase the number of deaths related to the five major cancers. Hence, the five leading causes of cancer death in our study were among the top ten cancers diagnosed in South African men and women in 2019 (41). Compared to children, the risk factors associated with many cancers are more prevalent in working-age and elderly populations. Therefore, the high prevalence of cancer risk factors among these age groups studied could lead to high CM.\n\nWe found that the five leading causes of cancer deaths contributed more than 50% of cancer deaths in both working-age and elderly populations, regardless of sex. The National Department of Health in SA has prioritized the cancers of the lung, colon, cervix, prostate, and breast based on high incidences of these cancers (33). The high incidences of these major cancers were also reported in sub-Saharan Africa (42). Based on the findings of our study, it is suggested that all the top five cancers in each sex should be given priority when formulating the interventions to fight cancer. Furthermore, the implementation of interventions should target both working-age and elderly populations. In South Africa, the numbers of cancers diagnosed among males and females increased from 26,538 to 41,491 and 28,748 to 43,811 between 2008 and 2019 (43). Studies conducted in South Africa from 1998 to 2002, 2003 to 2007, and 2008 to 2012 reported similar cancers diagnosed (44–46), although there were some differences based on ranking and sex. Esophageal cancer (30.5%) was the first most frequent cancer diagnosed, followed by prostate cancer (14.8%), Kaposi sarcoma (7.0%), lung cancer (5.2%), and liver cancer (5.1%) in men from 2008 to 2012, while cervical cancer accounted for 34.5%, esophageal cancer (19.9%), breast cancer (14.4%), Kaposi sarcoma (3.8%), and ovarian cancer (2.8%) in women (46)."
