        "meta_description": "In 1993 the publication of Paul Gilroy’s The Black Atlantic became a landmark in the field of cultural studies as its author tried to rescue that discipline from what he saw as its ethnocentrism inherited from the narrow focus of British historiography. Gilroy rejected any kind of ethnic absolutism, any theory based on some kind of “cultural insiderism” and tried to shift the focus to the Black British whom he saw as characterised by a double consciousness inherited from modernity and the gre...",

        "text": "4More recently, as pointed out by Dr Michael Morris of Dundee University, Wedderburn has become an important figure in the growing field of Scottish-Caribbean studies, as more research has revealed the extent of Scotland’s involvement in the slave trade. In 2004 Martin Hoyles published a book about him, entitled The Axe Laid to the Root: The Story of Robert Wedderburn and tried to present Wedderburn's story in a novel and entertaining way, by telling a story so to speak. Hoyles probably used McCalman's book as his main source. Ryan Hanley re-evaluated Wedderburn's career as a revolutionary activist in his book Beyond Slavery and Abolition: Black British Writing, c.1770-1830 and contrasted his uncompromising approach with the more conciliating tones used by Ottobah Cuguoano in his writings.\n\nFrom Jamaica to Britain: the influence of Thomas Spence\n\n8In 1785 in Seven Dials Wedderburn happened to chance upon a Methodist preacher who was addressing a crowd perched upon an upturned vegetable crate. Wedderburn stood transfixed listening to the preacher’s sermon, and finally agreed to join his congregation. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the growing dissatisfaction with Anglicanism, especially among the masses in the new industrial villages, led to the birth of a new religious creed which became known as Methodism. Wedderburn came to reject Methodism, which he seemed to find too conservative, and moved to Unitarianism.\n\n9The years between 1785 and 1813, the year when Wedderburn came under the influence of Spencean ideas, were extremely troubled years as the Napoleonic Wars, the legacy of the American Revolution, and the Haitian Revolution all had a big impact in Britain, influencing the rise of the radical movement. Wedderburn became involved in the radical movement and met Thomas Spence in 1812. In 1813, Wedderburn became a member of the Society of Spencean Philanthropists which Spence had founded in 1801.\n\n10To further his Spencean ideas, Wedderburn opened a Unitarian chapel in Hopkins Street, Soho. He regularly preached in that chapel, which was in fact a hayloft, and he was eventually tried and sent to jail in 1820. He was initially charged with sedition, as government spies reported that he had spoken against the government and in favour of land nationalisation, but he was eventually acquitted. He was later re-arrested on a charge of blasphemy. His trial took place on Friday 25 February 1820, two days after the arrest of the Cato Street conspirators. Wedderburn was already in jail on a charge of blasphemy when the conspirators were taken into custody and thus escaped arrest. Wedderburn was eventually found guilty of blasphemy and sent to Dorchester jail. Wedderburn published a book entitled The Horrors of Slavery in 1824, and then was arrested again on various charges in 1831, before migrating to New York. Back in England, he was last seen in 1834. The exact year of his death is not known, possibly 1835.\n\n12One of the most influential revolutionary thinkers was Thomas Paine whose Rights of Man was published in 1791 and 1792. Paine had supported the American colonists when he wrote and published Common Sense in January 1976, making the case for full independence from the British crown. In Rights of Man he attacked the hereditary principle and the monarchy, which shocked many people. The publication of the first part of the book in 1791 led to the birth of the London Corresponding Society in 1792 founded by a shoemaker called Thomas Hardy. In London, Spence entered various radical circles like the London Corresponding Society and became active as a propagandist and writer. He set up his bookstall in central London, trying to sell his pamphlets and was tried several times for sedition and for selling Rights of Man, which was banned. Spence defended the rights of women and children, and was against the colonial dispossession of African enslaved persons and Native Americans. In 1801, he was tried for seditious libel, found guilty, and sentenced to a year in Shrewsbury prison.\n\n15 Morris, Michael, “Robert Wedderburn: Race, Religion, and Revolution,” International Socialism, 132 (...)\n\nRecollect the fermentation will be universal. Their weapons are their bill-hooks; their store of provision is every were [sic] in abundance; you know they can live upon sugar canes. They will be victorious in their fight, slaying all before them. Their method of fighting is to be found in the scriptures, which they are now learning to read. They will slay man, woman, and child, and not spare the virgin, whose interest is connected with slavery, whether black, white or tawny.\n\n16According to Martin Hoyles, Wedderburn had set up his own bookstall next to Spence’s and occasionally helped him sell his material. Two buskers were present there too, which leads us to the performative aspect of Wedderburn's work.\n\nWedderburn’s performative ethos and his Caribbean heritage\n\n19Wedderburn's political radicalism seems to have developed during his time as a sailor. In The Black Atlantic, Paul Gilroy identified service in the Navy as a key element in the development of a Black Atlantic consciousness:\n\n20 Morris, “Robert Wedderburn: Race, Religion, and Revolution,” International Socialism, 132 (2011).\n\nBoth Wedderburn and his sometime associate Davidson had been sailors, moving to and fro between nations, crossing borders in modern machines which were themselves micro-systems of linguistic and political hybridity. Their relationship to the sea may turn out to be especially important for both the early politics and poetics of the black Atlantic world that I wish to counterpose against the narrow nationalism of so much English historiography.\n\n20Wedderburn's radicalism could be seen as part of British working-class radicalism, and he condemned the Peterloo massacre in no uncertain terms, calling the prince Regent a “tyrant” at a public meeting in London:\n\n21 Wedderburn, The Horrors of Slavery, 119.\n\nThat the Prince had lost the confidence and affection of his people but that he the Prince being supported by the Army and surrounded by his vile ministers nothing short of people taking arms in their own defence could bring about a Reform and prevent the bloody scene taking place at the next Smithfield meeting as had taken place at Manchester; for his part old as he was he was learning his Exercise as a soldier and he would be one if he fell in the cause, for he would rather die like Cashman if he could but have the satisfaction of plunging a dagger in the heart of a Tyrant.\n\n21The reference to John Cashman is particularly interesting as he was one of the Spencean revolutionaries involved in the Spa Fields riots of 1816. Cashman was executed in 1817. Wedderburn thus established a link between the Spa Fields riots and the Peterloo Massacre, and seems to have seen himself as part of that revolutionary tradition.\n\n22Another element which seems to identify Robert Wedderburn as a potent Black Atlantic figure is the performative ethos he developed based on the Caribbean oral tradition and what he knew about slave rebellions in the Caribbean. Wedderburn raised people’s consciousness on issues like slavery and workers’ rights by using political theatre and a performative aesthetics. Wedderburn popularised his ideas at his Hopkins Street Chapel, but also by making speeches on the streets of London, and in alehouses and taverns. Ironically, we have access to these speeches only through the testimonies of government spies and agents-provocateurs who were responsible for Wedderburn's eventual conviction for blasphemy.\n\n23In fact, in several of his Hopkins Street Chapel ‘sermons’, Wedderburn actually acted out scenes with his comrades and they would play the parts of current politicians like Lord Sidmouth (whom they dubbed ‘Lord Sadmouth’) and Lord Castlereagh (whom they called ‘Castlefish’). At one of these meetings, according to Martin Hoyles, Wedderburn debated such topics as “Has a Slave the Right to Kill His Master?” and referred to a slave rebellion which had broken out in Barbados in 1816, Bussa’s rebellion, and to an abortive slave insurrection in Jamaica, which nearly broke out in 1815. The aborted slave rebellion in Jamaica was actually mentioned in Matthew “Monk” Lewis’s Journal of a West India Proprietor, together with the song that got the plotters sentenced to death and hanged. That song was used in evidence in court. It is known as the “Song of the King of the Eboes”:\n\n22 Lewis, Matthew, Journal of A West India Proprietor (1834; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 1 (...)\n\nSong of the King of the Eboes\n\nOh me good friend, Mr. Wilberforce, make we free!\n\nGod Almighty thank ye! God Almighty thank ye!\n\nGod Almighty, make we free!\n\nBuckra in this country no make we free!\n\nWhat Negro for to do? What Negro for to do?\n\nTake force by force! Take force by force!\n\n24In his tirade, Wedderburn established a link between the infiltration of radical organisations by government spies in England and the fact that “they have spies in Jamaica too” since the leaders of the rebellion were betrayed by one of them. Wedderburn then asked one of his friends to sing that song, and they repeated the last two lines all together. Then, Wedderburn launched into a long tirade against Wilberforce, calling him a “hypocrite” and a “Jesuit” and accusing him of supporting every measure introduced by the government to restrict civil liberties.\n\n27 Lewis, Journal of A West India Proprietor, 36.\n\nthe sudden sounds of the drum and banjee called our attention to a procession of the John-Canoe, which was proceeding to celebrate the opening of the new year at the town of Black River. The John-Canoe is a Merry-Andrew dressed in a striped doublet, and bearing upon his head a kind of pasteboard house-boat filled with puppets, representing, some sailors, others soldiers, others again slaves at work on a plantation, &c. The John-Canoe is considered not merely as a person of material consequence, but one whose presence is absolutely indispensable. Nothing could look more gay.\n\n28Wedderburn could be said to have stood at the confluence of various traditions, oral and written, and this is visible, as pointed out by Alan Rice, in the heavily hybridised style he adopted in some passages of his autobiography, The Horrors of Slavery (1824), in which he used a mixture of capital letters, lower-case letters, and exclamation marks in a very unorthodox style:\n\n30 Wedderburn, The Horrors of Slavery, 50-51.\n\nI being a descendant of a Slave by a base Slave-Holder, the late JAMES WEDDERBURN, Esq. of Inveresk, who sold my mother when she was with child of me, HER THIRD SON BY HIM!!! She was FORCED to submit to him, being his Slave, THOUGH HE KNEW SHE DISLIKED HIM!... I have seen my poor mother stretched on the ground, tied hands and feet, and FLOGGED in the most indecent manner, though PREGNANT AT THE SAME TIME!!! her fault being the not acquainting her mistress that her master had given her leave to go and see her mother in town!\n\n29In his article on Wedderburn, Alan Rice identifies this style as an example of the hybridised style that Homi Bhabha sees as a form of resistance to the colonialist discourse associated with imperialism. Rice also points out that this unorthodox style could be an example of the subaltern speaking out against a dominant discourse, thus walking in Garyatri Spivak's footsteps. These are useful insights, but Wedderburn’s visually striking style could also be interpreted as his own position at the confluence of two traditions: the written, formal tradition (literacy) and the more demotic oral tradition represented by folk songs and folk tales, and oral testimonies. Wedderburn’s exclamation marks and capital letters may have been an attempt at giving the slaves a “voice” in print, at inscribing their presence in his text."
