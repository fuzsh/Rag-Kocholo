Even when we were making 'O', I was in Minnesota, New York, nowhere, because I was living from set to set.\n\n\"I drove my car down from Minnesota to shoot 'O' and then drove back after that. But the choice to step back from the industry had more to do with just plain sanity.\"\n\nJosh ultimately feared that fame and success might've led him to becoming detached from his \"community\".\n\nThe actor also acknowledged that fame didn't give him the \"satisfaction\" he was seeking.\n\nJosh - who now lives in the UK with his wife Tamsin Egerton - shared: \"I wanted to be myself amongst people that I knew, so I was able to revert back to my family and friends in Minnesota.\n\n\"Also, after a certain amount of time chasing a goal, I realised that achieving these things wasn’t giving me back the satisfaction I hoped it would, so I had to find something else to fill that gap. I felt, and still feel, that community is what fills it.\n\n\"Achievement is great in any walk of life. It’s a reason to get up in the morning. But the thing that really holds you is your community. I felt that I was kind of rootless at that time, so I wanted to find that community.\""
