        "text": "The ashes of child killer Robert Black, who was convicted of the murders of four children from across the UK in the 1980s, have been scattered at sea.\n\nBlack, 68, who had a history of abducting, abusing and murdering young girls, died in Maghaberry prison, County Antrim, last month.\n\nAmong his victims was Jennifer Cardy, nine, of Ballinderry in County Antrim.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Prison Service said his ashes were scattered \"without ceremony, beyond these shores\".\n\nA spokesperson said this was done in the absence of anyone claiming his remains and \"in accordance with the legal requirements for disposal.\"\n\nJennifer Cardy's father Andy said: \"I think it was handled discreetly, I think it was handled reverently and with respect and I think it had to be handled like that and I think the authorities did really well.\n\n\"I'm very pleased at how they handled it.\n\n\"We would now say that it's over. We knew that he would never be out of jail again and that he would never hurt another little girl.\n\n\"But probably it would be right to say that that's the end of it and that's quite a relief.\"\n\nBlack's other victims were Sarah Harper, 10, of Leeds, Susan Maxwell, 11, of Northumberland, and Caroline Hogg, five, of Edinburgh."
