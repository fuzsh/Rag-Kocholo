        "text": "THE remains of child killer Robert Black are lying unclaimed in a mortuary.\n\nPolice have failed to trace family members who would want to take the murderer’s body.\n\nThe Scots serial killer died on Tuesday while serving 12 life sentences for the kidnap and murder of four girls.\n\nHe was serving his time in Maghaberry Prison in Northern Ireland.\n\nOfficers have been trying to find family members in a bid to release Black’s remains for a funeral. But they have been unable to track down anyone willing to take responsibility.\n\nRead more: Police were set to charge serial child killer Robert Black with murder of Genette Tate within weeks\n\nMeanwhile, funeral arrangements have been put on hold.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland said: “Inquiries are ongoing to ascertain if there are any next of kin and if they want to take the body.”\n\nThe location where he will be laid to rest is causing concern, with one politician saying he should not be buried in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party’s Edwin Poots said: “In the absence of instructions, my preference would be that he is cremated and whatever is done with the ashes should be done secretly.”\n\nFalkirk-born Black’s single mum Jesse Hunter Black put him up for adoption when he was just weeks old in 1947.\n\nHe lived with foster parents in Kinlochleven, Argyll, but both died when he was 11 and he was placed in children’s homes in Falkirk, then Musselburgh.\n\nBlack, who was first accused of rape aged 12, abducted and murdered young girls while working as a delivery driver.\n\nHe was jailed in 1994 for the murders of Susan Maxwell, 11, from Cornhill-on-Tweed, Northumberland, in 1982; Caroline Hogg, five, from Edinburgh, in 1983; and Sarah Harper, 10, from Morley, near Leeds, in 1986. In 2011, he was also convicted of the murder of Jennifer Cardy, nine, in Ballinderry, Co Antrim, in 1981.\n\nAt the same time, he was convicted of a failed abduction bid on Teresa Thornhill in Nottingham in 1988 when she was 15.\n\nHe was finally caught in 1990 when he tried to abduct a six-year-old girl, who was found gagged and stuffed in a sleeping bag in his van in Stow in the Borders.\n\nFollowing his death, detectives said they were days away from charging him with the abduction and murder of Genette Tate, 13, who went missing in Devon in 1978 and has never been found.\n\nBlack never expressed any remorse and refused to co-operate with police investigating other killings.\n\nCold case expert Chris Clark fears Black murdered up to 16 girls.\n\nEx-police intelligence officer Clark says a former associate of Black’s said the killer had revealed “information only a guilty man could have known” about a number of other child murders."
