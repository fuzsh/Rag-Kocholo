        "text": "Here I have to specify that ‘Black Dog’ as used throughout this article does not refer simply to domestic dogs that are black, but to a specific sort of frightening, monstrous creature that has the form of a very large, black, shaggy-coated dog, is mostly associated with rural roads, town edges and green places, and which is described as atypical relative to domestic dogs and, furthermore, able to generate an unusual amount of fear in those who encounter it. In discussing the Black Dog, we almost certainly aren’t talking about an actual animal or race of animals but instead some kind of folkloric or cultural entity, perhaps meaning that this article is out of place on a blog devoted to zoology. But read on.\n\nThe Black Dog is a creature of contradiction, stories variously describing it as a malevolent or menacing presence, as an associate of witchcraft, Satanic goings-on, or the afterlife, as Satan himself, as a terrifying, hellish beast that can burn and even kill, as an omen or portent associated with misfortune or impending death, as a benign, known and regular feature of the landscape, or even as a guardian or protector.\n\nNames and their alleged origins. A large number of local names are attached to the Black Dog, those from Britain including Barguest, Black Shuck, Capelthwaite, Galley Trot, Gurt Dog, Hairy Jack, Hooter, Old Scarpe, Old Shock, Padfoot, Scarfe, Shucky Dog, Shug Monster, Skeff, Skriker, Striker and Trash. Numerous efforts to find the etymologies of these names exist; in his Mystery Animals of Britain and Ireland, Graham McEwan (1986) reviewed suggestions that certain of them might have their roots in old words associated with gnawing or biting, with Satan, with words for spirit, ghost, elf, or shining, with howling, with the noisy ‘striking’ or ‘sloshing’ sounds of the Black Dog’s feet, with the shagginess of its coat, with the bear-like appearance of the Black Dog, with the Black Dog’s association with towns, barrows, hills or funeral processions, or with its role as a guardian of treasure (McEwan 1986).\n\nThis diversity of associations makes me wonder if people were ever really describing the same one thing. I mean: if names used for specific, regional variants of the Black Dog really are meant to be synonymous with ‘town ghost’, ‘hill ghost’, ‘barrow ghost’ or ‘treasure guardian’, I’m inclined to think that ‘Black Dog’ is better imagined as a synonym of ‘amorphous dark non-humanoid phantom’. Having said that, a good number of the tales and accounts really do describe big, black, shaggy-coated dog-like animals, and it’s those accounts I’m interested in.\n\nBlack Dogs are generally large: mostly bigger than a familiar dog like a German shepherd or Labrador, and quite often said to be exceptionally big, some accounts describing them as being as tall as a table or the size of a calf. The eyes are often said to be strikingly large, and to glow, usually red. This is thought to reflect an internally generated, spectral glow and not be a reflection of lights held by the witness. A few accounts pertaining to Devon describe the Black Dog as headless and Black Shuck is said in some stories to only have one, centrally positioned eye.\n\nBlack Dog tales are not restricted to the UK. They also come from the Republic of Ireland, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Poland, the USA and Canada (Bord & Bord 1981, McEwan 1986), and there are stories from Mexico, Central and South American countries too that describe similar creatures. Whether this reflects a shared folkloric heritage, cultural transmission, the coincidental development of similar tales, or the widespread nature of a genuine phenomenon remains to be established.\n\nBlack Dog accounts typically involve lonely countryside roads, and the witness is virtually always alone when the encounter happens. A Black Dog story most often involves the person hearing the dog approaching and then seeing it, and then realising by virtue of its size, frightening appearance and unusual features that it is not a normal dog. Its approach sometimes causes the person to flee or hide, but more normally the Black Dog walks alongside the person for a while before disappearing or moving into a gap in a hedge or bend in the road. There are a few accounts where the Black Dog was seen running alongside by the occupants of a vehicle, and there are a few stories of them being seen indoors, and of disappearing after leaving a room.\n\nWhile it might sound from everything I’ve described so far that Black Dog stories are long-ago tales from the Middle Ages or thereabouts, a great many are surprisingly modern. Reading through the numerous tales repeated in McEwan (1986) and other sources, it’s striking how many are from the 20th century, including from the 1940s, 50s and as recently as the 70s.\n\nA Strange and Terrible Wonder. Among the most famous of Black Dog stories is that reported by Abraham Fleming in his 1577 booklet A Strange and Terrible Wonder. Fleming was relating an account that happened in the churches of Bungay and Blythburgh, Suffolk, on the morning of Sunday 4th August. After a thunderstorm, a great black dog – accompanied by flashes of fire – appeared within the Bungay church and ran among the congregation. It passed between two people, both kneeling in prayer, and killed them both by attacks to the neck. It grabbed the neck of another person – a man – and, though succeeding in causing the skin of his neck to become shrunk “as it were a peece of lether scorched in a hot fire”, did not kill him.\n\nThe Black Dog then somehow moved to the church at Blythburgh about 7 miles (10 km) away where similar events ensued. There, it killed three people and burnt the hand of a fourth. This is the only Black Dog account associated with any claimed physical evidence of its manifestation, since it supposedly leapt through a door at the end of the church and left black scorch marks on the wood. Whether the scorch marks existed first, and then inspired the placement of the Black Dog event, or whether something caused the scorch marks and then ‘became’ – through retelling, embellishment, misunderstanding or misinterpretation – a Black Dog remains unknown.\n\nThe suggestion that some local English names used for Black Dogs (specifically, Barguest and its variants) had their origins in its bear-like form (McEwan 1986) raise the possibility that some Black Dog accounts were based on sightings of actual bears. The Brown bear Ursus arctos became extinct in Britain around 1000-1500 years ago, perhaps during the early Medieval period (O’Regan 2018), and this is too long ago to be linked to Black Dog stories. Anyway, given the familiarity that people have with bears – even in Britain – any idea that bears might have been dubbed ‘dogs’ of any sort is unlikely. I do wonder, though, if the idea of spectral or phantom bears has been confused with, or absorbed into, Black Dog lore.\n\nOne researcher – author Di Francis, who died in 2021 – argued that Black Dogs may indeed be descriptions of a real carnivoran species, but one that’s of felid identity, not canid. Francis was an advocate (if not the sole advocate) of the hypothesis that claimed British big cat encounters were not only zoologically valid, but that they described a new kind of cat unknown to science, and belonging to an ancient lineage distinct from familiar groups within the cat family tree. Her hypothesis was advocated in a few popular books – most notably 1981’s Cat Country (Francis 1981) – but was and is essentially unknown and ignored outside the niche community interested in the British big cat phenomenon. I think it’s fair to say that the proposal was extremely unpopular and that it failed to win adherents.\n\nWere her hypothesis true or likely, it would benefit from some indication that people throughout the ages had encountered her novel British cat species and had reason to describe it to others. Francis suggested that Black Dog accounts were not folkloric but actual descriptions of big black cats; she argued that Black Dog accounts merely described the creature within a ‘dog’ frame of reference because the people observing these animals were unfamiliar with large cats. She argued that the ‘striking’ sounds associated with Black Dog feet were consistent with her view that the British big cat has non-retractile claws, that Black Dog accounts mentioning headlessness are consistent with the low neck carriage of cats relative to the more erect one of dogs, and she also noted that the sounds made by Black Dogs, and the leaping behaviour mentioned in a few accounts, were also more consistent with a cat identity than a dog one (Francis 1981).\n\nAs is so often the case with cryptozoological hypotheses that aim to turn an inconsistently described, cultural entity into a flesh and blood animal, I think that Francis’s proposal is a whole lot of fun, and I’m entertained by the fact that the Black Dog illustrated in Fleming’s 1577 booklet could be interpreted as a cat-like animal rather than a dog-like one. But… do I take it seriously? No. I think her effort to turn Black Dogs into cats reflects a cherry-picking of traits that are either not convincing (would a cat with non-retractile claws really be noisy on a road? Would a big cat interpreted as a dog really be interpreted as headless?), or ignore the obvious dog-like demeanour of this creature.\n\nThe Black Dog as an psychological phenomenon. Could there be a real-world explanation for Black Dogs? There’s a tendency in the mystery animal literature for Black Dog accounts – as there is for mystery animal accounts in general – to be interpreted as eyewitness observations of real animals. I’m not necessarily discounting this proposed explanation across the board, but the long-ago nature of many Black Dog accounts sure makes them sound folkloric and allegorical: as tales that are meant to entertain or frighten, and perhaps function as warnings about travelling certain routes at unsafe hours. The associations I’ve mentioned with churches and the Christian devil imply that belief in the Black Dog has been encouraged since it promotes some sort of adherence to religious belief.\n\nBut if we entertain the idea that at least some of the stories (remember, they’re reported as recently as a few decades ago) describe real experiences of some sort, could there be a non-zoological explanation?\n\nAs I noted earlier, the massive diversity of Black Dogs sure makes it sound as if people have described all manner of different things. What’s been suggested is that people might have seen – or, at least, perceived – an amorphous dark shape, only vaguely of dog-like size and form, and interpreted or described it as a Black Dog because that was the only thing they could liken it to. One possible explanation for Black Dog sightings is that they represent hallucinations. Maybe, in certain situations, people perceive a dark shape (due to tiredness, intoxication, eye defects or a brain disorder) and it’s this that’s ‘the Black Dog’. This would be an ‘internal’, ‘psychological’ or ‘human’ explanation for the phenomenon.\n\nIt must be emphasised that the linking of hauntings to these things is a hypothesis, and an under-tested one that hasn’t necessarily worked well as an explanation in experiments (French et al. 2009, Dagnall et al. 2020). It’s also worth noting that people’s tendency to apparently perceive exotic or supposedly paranormal phenomena is contingent on their beliefs and suggestibility, so ‘believing’ or merely knowing about a supposed phenomenon or entity has some influence on what the person thinks is happening.\n\nWhere I’m going with this is as follows: I wonder if key locations, imbued with certain properties relating to geomagnetism, infrasound or something else, OR particular electromagnetic weather events have resulted in people experiencing something, interpreting that something as observations of a vague dark object, and it is this “vague dark object” that is the Black Dog. This all sounds tenuous and arm-wavy, and it is, but it’s not a ridiculous hypothesis given the weirdness of human perception (Tandy & Lawrence 1998, Tandy 2000) and the power of suggestion and belief.\n\nNone of what I’m saying is entirely novel. The idea that sightings of monsters, phantoms and ghosts might be linked to unusual properties of the landscape (like, the presence of underground watercourses, specific rock types, seismic activity and so on) has been mused on here and there in the past, and a few features of Black Dog accounts that seem linked to storms, lightning or electrical discharge led McEwan (1986) to consider that ‘Black Dog’ accounts might be misinterpreted stories about ball lightning. You’ll recall the scorch marks from the Blythburgh church.\n\nWhatever the root of this phenomenon, I find the Black Dog as a mythical, semi-real feature of the landscape a fascinating one, and I’m often surprised that such a ubiquitous, long-standing mythical creature isn’t better known. And I wonder if a better understanding of this alleged creature might help explain other ‘monsters’, whether real or imagined.\n\nFor previous TetZoo articles on related issues, see…\n\nUsborne’s All About Monsters, April 2019\n\nSea Monster Sightings and the ‘Plesiosaur Effect’, April 2019\n\nBooks on the Loch Ness Monster 3: The Man Who Filmed Nessie: Tim Dinsdale and the Enigma of Loch Ness, August 2019\n\nThe 1972 Loch Ness Monster Flipper Photos, August 2020\n\nMonsters of the Deep, a Ground-Breaking Exhibition at the National Maritime Museum, Cornwall, October 2020\n\nThe Lake Dakataua ‘Migo’ Lake Monster Footage of 1994, February 2021\n\nWhat Was the Montauk Monster?
