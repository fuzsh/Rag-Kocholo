He had sexually assaulted her moments earlier.\n\nOnce in police custody, the predator was linked to a series of unsolved crimes in the previous decade.\n\nIn 1994, he was found guilty of three child murders in the 1980s, those of 11-year-old Susan Maxwell in the Scottish Borders and five-year-old Caroline and Sarah Harper, 10, from Morley, near Leeds, as well as a failed abduction bid in Nottingham in 1988.\n\nIn 2011, he was found guilty of the 1981 murder of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy, from Ballinderry, Country Antrim. Black, who lived out his last days in Maghaberry high security prison in Co Antrim, was also suspected of involvement in other killings and unexplained disappearances.\n\nHe had long been the prime suspect in the case of missing 13-year-old Genette Tate, who was last seen in a rural lane in Aylesbeare, Devon, in 1978.\n\nHe died in January 2018 of heart disease and was cremated - with his ashes scattered at sea after prison authorities in Northern Ireland revealed no one wanted his remains.\n\nThe Child Snatcher: Manhunt, a two-part documentary airs Monday, 7 August at 9pm and concludes on Tuesday night on Channel 5."
