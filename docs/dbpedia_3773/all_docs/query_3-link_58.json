        "text": "VIENNA: The Vienna leg of a tour by American mega-star Taylor Swift has been canceled after Austria arrested a Daesh sympathizer in connection with an attack plot, the organizers said Wednesday.\n\nAuthorities had earlier confirmed the arrest of a 19-year-old sympathizer of the armed group for allegedly planning an attack in the Vienna region, warning he had a “focus” on Swift’s three upcoming shows.\n\n“With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone’s safety,” Barracuda Music said on Instagram.\n\nThe organizers added that all ticket holders would receive refunds. About 65,000 spectators were expected at each show scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe man, who had pledged his allegiance to Daesh “in recent weeks,” was detained in lower Austria about an hour from the capital early on Wednesday, Austria’s top security chief Franz Ruf told a press conference.\n\n“We have established corresponding preparatory acts and also that there is a focus of the 19-year-old perpetrator on the Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna,” Ruf said.\n\nHe said that chemical substances had been seized at the suspect’s home.\n\nA second person believed to have been in contact with the suspect was arrested in Vienna.\n\nAccording to the initial investigation, both suspects radicalized themselves on the Internet.\n\nPolice had promised to ramp up security measures, including deploying special units for the concerts, while having minimized any concrete danger.\n\nIn the official “Swifties” fan group on WhatsApp, panic ensued following the announcement of the shows’ cancelation with administrators overwhelmed with thousands of messages.\n\nMarie Sereinig, 15, who had traveled from the south of the Alps to attend the show with her aunt, had spent months planning her outfit for the concert.\n\n“I’m simply shocked and very sad. But I can also understand that Taylor Swift wouldn’t dare go on stage in these conditions,” she told AFP.\n\nOther fans also shared their dismay.\n\n“I don’t really have any words,” said Flora Zoe Koberwein, a 20-year-old student, adding, “sorry for those who have traveled so far.”\n\nConservative Chancellor Karl Nehammer called the cancelation “a bitter disappointment” for fans in a post on X, adding that the “very serious” threat had been combatted early to prevent any tragedy.\n\nThe 34-year-old pop star was due to bring her record-breaking “Eras” Tour, which began its European leg in Paris in May, to Vienna on Thursday.\n\nFollowing France, the tour stopped in Sweden, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Poland, having a significant impact on the local economies at each stop.\n\nIn Austria, more than 170,000 spectators were expected to attend the shows, bringing in some 100 million euros, according to estimates by the news agency APA.\n\nBy the end of the year, “Eras” had already become the first tour to sell more than $1 billion in tickets and it is on track to more than double that by the time it concludes in Vancouver this December.\n\nAustria experienced its first deadly jihadist attack in November 2020, when a convicted IS sympathizer went on a shooting rampage in downtown Vienna, killing four and wounding 23 others before police shot him dead.\n\nPARIS: France bid a reluctant farewell on Monday to an “enchanted” fortnight of Olympic sport as athletes headed home from Paris praising a dazzling edition of the Games that has breathed new life into the biggest show on earth.\n\nHollywood star Tom Cruise delivered stardust at the closing ceremony on Sunday evening — and a link with the next Games in Los Angeles — by abseiling into the national stadium.\n\nThe “Mission Impossible” star descended on a wire in front of 71,500 spectators, grabbed the Olympic flag and jumped onto a motorbike, to the delight of thousands of dancing athletes and awe-struck fans.\n\nThe final act of the Paris Olympics brought relief that an event foreshadowed by worries about terror attacks, strikes or protests had passed off with barely a hitch.\n\nBut there was also sadness that two weeks of high-spirited celebration had come to an end.\n\n“Keep the flame alive,” urged the front-page headline of France’s biggest sports newspaper, L’Equipe, which featured new national swimming hero Leon Marchand and urged French people to maintain the spirit “of this enchanted fortnight.”\n\nAt the Athletes’ Village in northern Paris, bleary-eyed athletes were packing their bags after a late night, with the French capital’s two main airports braced for a huge influx of travelers and sports equipment.\n\nMagda Skarbonkiewicz, a Team USA fencer, said she would return home filled with memories of competing inside the Grand Palais, one of the historic venues used around the French capital.\n\n“It’s such an iconic venue and just nothing like I’ve ever seen before,” she told AFP. “It’s amazing to see so many people care about fencing the way the French people do.”\n\nDuring Sunday night’s closing ceremony, which stressed the Olympics’ core message of peace and cooperation, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach had praised the Paris Games for being “sport at its best.”\n\n“These were sensational Olympic Games from start to finish,” Bach said. “Or dare I say: Seine-sational Games,” the IOC chief quipped in a pun about the river flowing through Paris which was a sometimes fickle star of the event.\n\nObservers had seen Paris 2024 as essential for the Olympics brand as a whole, coming after a Covid-affected edition in Tokyo and a corruption-tainted version in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nAround 9,000 athletes flooded into the Stade de France on Sunday night for a show that featured music from French electro act Air, guitar band Phoenix, Belgian singer Angele and the Cambodian rapper VannDa.\n\n“We knew you would be brilliant, but you were magic,” Paris 2024 organizing chief Tony Estanguet told the crowd during a triumphalist speech.\n\nHe said the Games had transformed “a nation of implacable complainers” into “unbridled supporters who don’t want to stop singing.”\n\nMuch of the media commentary has focused on the uplifting impact of the Games on the generally morose national mood.\n\nJust weeks before the Olympics, snap elections called by President Emmanuel Macron delivered a hung parliament and a historic number of seats for the far-right National Rally party.\n\n“The Paris Games offered the capital and the entire country more than two weeks of fervor and happiness that were so unexpected and appreciated given that they came after a political period dominated by the sad passions of decline and xenophobia,” said an editorial in Le Monde newspaper.\n\n“For 17 days the stereotype of the indifferent, grumpy Frenchman went missing,” wrote sports writer Owen Slot in The Times newspaper, adding that Paris had “made the Olympic Games look more beautiful than ever before.”\n\nThe closing spectacle marked the beginning of the four-year countdown to the LA Games, and American gymnastics icon Simone Biles joined Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass as the Olympic flag was formally handed over.\n\nThe ceremony followed 17 days of drama-filled sporting action lit up by Biles, American sprinter Noah Lyles, Pakistan’s javelin king Arshad Nadeem and casual Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec, who has become an Internet sensation.\n\nThey also featured a damaging gender row about two female boxers, Imane Khelif of Algeria and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting, who both went on to win gold.\n\nThe last day of sporting action saw the United States pip China for top spot in the battle for medals after the US women’s basketball team squeezed past France 67-66 to clinch the last gold of the Games.\n\nThe win — the eighth consecutive Olympic women’s basketball title won by the USA — ensured the Americans finished level with China on 40 golds each.\n\nThe USA however finished on top of the overall medal table with a total of 126 medals, with China in second place on 91.\n\nDHAKA: Bangladeshi police resumed patrols of the capital Dhaka on Monday, ending a weeklong strike that left a law and order vacuum following the abrupt ouster of autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina.\n\nOfficers vanished from the streets of the sprawling megacity of 20 million people last week after Hasina’s resignation and flight abroad ended her 15-year rule.\n\nPolice were loathed for spearheading a lethal crackdown on the weeks of protests that forced her departure, with 42 officers among the more than 450 people killed.\n\nPolice had vowed not to resume work until their safety on duty was guaranteed, but they agreed to return after late-night talks with the new interim government, helmed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.\n\n“It’s good to be back,” assistant commissioner Snehasish Das said while standing at a busy intersection directing traffic.\n\n“As we feel secure now, we are back on duty.”\n\nStudent-led protests against Hasina’s government had been largely peaceful until police attempted to violently disperse them.\n\nAround 450 of the country’s 600 police stations were targeted in arson and vandalism attacks over the past month, according to the national police union.\n\nSome began reopening late last week under guard by the army, an institution held in higher esteem for largely refusing to participate in the crackdown.\n\nIn the police’s absence, the students who led the protests that toppled Hasina volunteered to restore law and order after looting and reprisal attacks in the hours after her departure.\n\nThey acted as traffic wardens, formed overnight neighborhood watch patrols and guarded Hindu temples and other places of worship, quickly settling the unrest.\n\nDas said there was “no tension” between police and the students who had been performing their duties.\n\n“Students have done a tremendous job in the past few days,” he added. “Our thanks to them.”\n\nThe volunteers, for their part, said they were relieved to yield back their responsibilities.\n\n“It’s too difficult for us to manage the vehicles,” Chanu Abdullah, 27, said. “I’m really thankful the police came back.”\n\nYunus’s de facto cabinet now administering the country said it had noted with “grave concern” some attacks on Hindus and other minorities.\n\nIn its first official statement on Sunday night, the cabinet said it would work to “find ways to resolve such heinous attacks.”\n\nBangladeshi Hindus account for around eight percent of the country’s 170 million people and have regularly been the targets of violence during periods of upheaval.\n\nHundreds have arrived on India’s border since last week, asking to cross.\n\nThe leadership of Jamaat, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party, said it would meet with representatives of the Hindu community and other minority leaders later Monday in a bid to ease tensions.\n\nHasina, 76, fled by helicopter to neighboring India a week ago as protesters flooded Dhaka’s streets in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted tenure.\n\nHer government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents.\n\nBut new home minister Sakhawat Hossain said the government had no intention of banning Hasina’s Awami League party, which played a pivotal role in the country’s independence movement.\n\n“The party has made many contributions to Bangladesh — we don’t deny this,” he told reporters.\n\n“When the election comes, (they should) contest the elections.”\n\nInterim leader Yunus returned from Europe on Thursday to head a temporary administration facing the monumental challenge of steering democratic reforms.\n\nThe 84-year-old won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance, credited with helping millions of Bangladeshis out of grinding poverty.\n\nHe took office as “chief adviser” to a caretaker administration — all fellow civilians bar Hossain, a retired brigadier-general — and has said he wants to hold elections “within a few months.”\n\nThe Daesh group has claimed a bombing on a minibus that killed one person and wounded 11 in a Shiite-dominated neighborhood of the Afghan capital.\n\nThe jihadist group said on its Telegram channel late Sunday that “one Shiite was killed in a bombing by Caliphate soldiers in the Afghan capital.”\n\nKabul police said on Sunday the blast occurred in a western Kabul neighborhood home to many Shiite Muslims, a historically persecuted minority in Afghanistan and a frequent target of the Daesh group that considers them heretics.\n\nItalian nongovernmental organization Emergency NGO, which operates a hospital in Kabul, said on social media platform X that it had received eight people wounded in the blast, with seven in need of surgery and one “in a serious condition.”\n\nThe number of deadly bomb blasts and suicide attacks in Afghanistan has declined markedly since the Taliban ended their insurgency after seizing power in August 2021. However, a number of armed groups, including Daesh-Khorasan, remain a threat.\n\nDaesh-Khorasan, or Daesh-K, is the group’s Afghanistan branch, “Khorasan” referring to a historical region that included parts of Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia.\n\nThe group also claimed an attack targeting tourists in Afghanistan in May that killed six people, including three foreigners.\n\nIt has also claimed responsibility for an attack on a Moscow concert hall in March that killed 145 people.\n\nA UN counter-terrorism official warned this month that Daesh-K poses the greatest external terrorist threat to Europe, having “improved its financial and logistical capabilities in the past six months.”\n\nChief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the concerns raised were “driven by propaganda” and that the group had been “significantly weakened” in Afghanistan.\n\n“The Islamic Emirate (of Afghanistan) does not allow anyone to use Afghan soil against the security of any other country or to pose threats from Afghanistan,” he wrote on X.\n\nKYIV: Two Russian regions bordering Ukraine ordered more evacuations on Monday as Moscow battled to contain an unprecedented push onto its territory.\n\nUkraine sent troops into Russia last week in its biggest cross-border operation since Moscow launched its invasion in February 2022 and the most significant by a foreign army since World War II.\n\nAuthorities in the Kursk region announced they were widening their evacuation area to include Belovsky district, home to some 14,000 people. The neighboring Belgorod region said it was evacuating its border district of Krasnoyaruzhsky.\n\n“For the health and security of our population, we’re beginning to move people who live in Krasnoyaruzhsky to safer places,” Belgorod region governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram.\n\nThe assault on Kursk had already led to 76,000 people being ordered out.\n\nA top Ukrainian official told AFP over the weekend that the operation was aimed at stretching Russian troops and destabilising the country after months of slow Russian advances across the frontline.\n\nThe assault appeared to catch the Kremlin off guard. Russia’s army rushed in reserve troops, tanks, aviation, artillery and drones in a bid to quash it.\n\nBut the army on Sunday conceded that Ukraine had penetrated up to 30 kilometers (20 miles) into Russian territory in places.\n\nIn a briefing, the defense ministry said it had “foiled attempts” by Ukraine’s forces to “break through deep into Russian territory” using armored vehicles.\n\nBut it said some forces were near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, some 25 kilometers and 30 kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border.\n\nA Ukrainian security official told AFP, on condition of anonymity, that “the aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilize the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border.”\n\nThe Ukrainian official said thousands of Ukrainian troops were involved in the operation.\n\nRussia’s defense ministry said on Monday that its air defense systems had destroyed 18 Ukrainian drones — including 11 over the Kursk region.\n\nOn Sunday, each country blamed the other for a fire at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine. Both sides — and the UN’s nuclear watchdog — said there was no sign of a nuclear leak.\n\n“No impact has been reported for nuclear safety,” said the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has experts at the site. Kyiv and Moscow said there had been no rise in radiation levels.\n\nIn a later statement, the IAEA said it had requested “immediate access to the cooling tower to assess the damage.”\n\nA Moscow-installed official, Vladimir Rogov, said the blaze has been “completely extinguished” in a Telegram post Monday.\n\nThe plant’s Russian-installed operator said on Monday that it was working normally following the incident and that all six reactors remained in “cold shutdown.”\n\nRussia’s emergency situations ministry said on Sunday that over 44,000 residents in the Kursk region have applied for financial assistance, TASS news agency reported.\n\nAt an aid center in Moscow, 28-year-old midwife Daria Chistopolskaya was critical of the response.\n\n“I think that the state does not care enough about such people, and people themselves should help each other in these kinds of situations,” she told AFP.\n\nRussia’s rail operator organized emergency trains from Kursk to Moscow, around 450 kilometers away, for those fleeing.\n\n“It’s scary to have helicopters flying over your head all the time,” said Marina, refusing to give her surname, who arrived by train in Moscow on Sunday. “When it was possible to leave, I left.”\n\nKursk regional governor Alexei Smirnov conceded on Sunday that the situation was “difficult.”\n\nAcross the border in Ukraine’s Sumy region, AFP journalists on Sunday saw dozens of armored vehicles daubed with a white triangle — the insignia apparently being used to identify Ukrainian military hardware deployed in the attack.\n\nAt an evacuation center in the regional capital of Sumy, 70-year-old retired metal worker Mykola, who fled his village of Khotyn some 10 kilometers from the Russian border, welcomed Ukraine’s push into Russia.\n\n“Let’s let them find out what it’s like,” he told AFP. “They don’t understand what war is. Let them have a taste of it.”\n\nAnalysts think Kyiv may have launched the assault to try to relieve pressure on its troops in other parts of the front line.\n\nBut the Ukrainian official said: “Their pressure in the east continues, they are not pulling back troops from the area,” even if “the intensity of Russian attacks has gone down a little bit.”\n\nThe Ukrainian official said he expected Russia would “in the end” stop the incursion.\n\nUkraine was bracing for a large-scale retalliatory missile attack, including “on decision-making centers” in Ukraine, the official said.\n\nKABUL: Three years into its rule of Afghanistan, the Taliban government has achieved some diplomatic wins even as it has consolidated power and enforced its strict version of Islamic law.\n\nThe Taliban rulers continue to operate without official recognition from any country — its restrictions on women a major sticking point.\n\nBut concern over Afghanistan’s worsening humanitarian crisis, the threat of terrorism, and hard-nosed pragmatism have led to some international engagement.\n\nThe most notable example was the Taliban government’s participation, for the first time, in United Nations-hosted talks in June in Qatar to discuss economic issues and counter-narcotics efforts.\n\nChief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, who led the delegation, said the gathering was further proof that: “Afghanistan has come out of isolation.”\n\n“We are in favor of positive meetings with the condition that Afghanistan’s situation is taken into account,” he told AFP in a recent interview ahead of this week’s three-year anniversary of the Taliban taking back power.\n\nThe talks went ahead after Kabul obtained the agreement of the UN — which has described restrictions on women in Afghanistan as “gender apartheid” — that civil society and women’s rights groups would not attend.\n\nObaidullah Baheer, grandson of former warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and an Afghan academic, said engagement at the talks was a “smart approach.”\n\n“The international community can’t solve the women’s rights issue. What they can do is try to create an environment” to gradually stabilize the economy in Afghanistan, Baheer said.\n\n“Economic stability naturally brings with it some sort of opening for politics as well.”\n\nThe Taliban authorities, who are still pushing to fill Afghanistan’s seat at the UN, are also forging regional ties.\n\n“Currently we have very good relations with neighboring, regional and Muslim countries,” Mujahid said, adding that about 40 countries had embassies or consulates in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile Western embassies in Kabul have been closed for three years, Pakistan, China, Russia, Iran and Central Asian republics have established de facto diplomatic relations with Kabul.\n\nRussia is also preparing to remove the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations, while Beijing has appointed its first ambassador to Kabul since the takeover.\n\nFears over the growing security threat from the Daesh group’s branch in the region, known as Islamic State Khorasan Province, have also spurred engagement.\n\nLast week, the UN warned that IS-K posed the greatest external terrorist threat to Europe and was growing in strength.\n\nMujahid insisted the IS threat was being overblown.\n\n“We have brought the phenomenon of ISKP to nearly zero,” he told AFP.\n\nAfter ousting the foreign-backed government and ending their 20-year insurgency, the Taliban rulers have made security one of their highest priorities.\n\nThe Taliban authorities still allocate a large part of the national budget to security despite Afghanistan no longer being at war and its economy in dire straits. And while Afghans may welcome restored security after more than 40 years of successive conflicts, many also struggle to feed themselves and strain under tightening restrictions.\n\nA civil society activist, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, described the rules on daily life as becoming “stricter and stricter.”\n\nGovernment affairs are mostly run through religious edicts from the reclusive supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, based in the Taliban southern stronghold of Kandahar.\n\nPolitically, there is no visible opposition: parties are banned and there are no elections.\n\n“There is no one to challenge the Emir,” the civil society activist said.\n\nThe UN has described a “climate of fear” in the country, where popular protests are virtually non-existent.\n\nThe Taliban government rejects these accusations.\n\n“We don’t accept that we are totalitarian,” Mujahid said.\n\nThe authorities have “mechanisms... to convey the voice of the people to the government,” the spokesman said, referring to provincial counsels comprising clerics and tribal elders.\n\n“They might not be the same as in the previous government or what are common in democratic governments, but we have developed these mechanisms in an Islamic way and we are committed to the country’s interests,” Mujahid added.\n\nBaheer, based in Kabul, said he still believed dialogue could bring about change:\n\n“What we can do is constantly speak to the nation and these people (the Taliban authorities), creating a larger national pressure and ultimately... hoping that they realize that they are up against the people and they have to compromise.”"
