        "text": "Black Surname Name Meaning, Origin, History, & Etymology\n\nThe primarily Scottish and English last name Black has five main origin theories and meanings. First, this derives from the nickname “the black” referring to a person with a dark complexion or dark hair, perhaps a moniker given to the native Britons and Celts by the invading Saxons and Angles who began to come to the British Isles starting in the around 450 AD. Second, the name may be a reduced form of the occupational name Blacksmith, a person who worked with cold metals (as opposed to a Whitesmith, who worked with hot metals). The name derive from the Middle English word blak(e) and Old English blæc or blaca, meaning black. Third, it may be a spelling variant of the Norman surname Blanc. Fourth, in some instances it could be an Anglicized version of several Gaelic surnames with the word dubh, meaning black (ex. MacCiludy, Macildowie, MacGilledhuibh, meaning “son of the black lad”). Fifth, it could derive from the occupation or job of chimney sweeping, as the person who performed such a task would often be covered in soot, which is the color black. It is interesting to note that folklore states that Wulric the Black, the all of Hereward the Saxon, was so named because “on one occasion he had blackened his face with charcoal, and this disguised, had penetrated unobserved among his enemies, and killed ten of them with his spear before he made his retreat”. It is also possible it derives from the Old English word blac, which means pale or white, the exactly opposite of the words. In old Scots Latin documents, the name is spelled Niger (ex. Hugh Niger witness a charter in Angus in 1178 AD). It is interesting to note that the Clan Lamont Society asserts the Blacks were originally Lamonts who later changed their surname. One author asserts that in England, the family was first established in county Lincolnshire, where they held land, manors, and titles for many generations, perhaps even prior to the Norman Invasion of 1066 AD. Here they were converted to Christianity by Paulinus (a Roman missionary who was the first Bishop of York, sent by Pope Gregory I to Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism, died 644 AD) around 628 AD, and later moved north, becoming established in Scotland by the year 1175 AD.\n\nSpelling Variations\n\nSome known spelling variants or names with similar etymologies include Blacke, Blake, and Blak. The name also is found in various other surnames, including, but not limited to, Blackman, Blackley, Blackett, Blackwell, Blackgrove, Blacklock, Blackburn, Blackford, Blackleach, Blacksmith, Blackston(e), Blackwood, Blackborn(e), and others. Similar foreign names include Blaak and Blak (Dutch).\n\nPopularity & Geographic Distribution\n\nThe last name Black ranks 160th in popularity in the United Status as of the 2000 Census. The name ranks particularly high in the following seven states: Utah, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wyoming.\n\nThe surname Black frequency/commonness ranks as follows in the British Isles: England (186th), Scotland (44th), Wales (280th), Ireland (536th) and Northern Ireland (50th). In England, it ranks highest in counties Northumberland and Cumberland. In Scotland, the surname Black ranks highest in counties East Lothian and West Lothian. In Wales, it ranks highest in county Anglesey. In Ireland, it ranks highest in Donegal. In Northern Ireland, it ranks highest in Antrim.\n\nThe name is also present throughout the remainder English speaking world: Canada (179th), New Zealand (102nd), Australia (132nd), and South Africa (661st).\n\nThe 1890 book Homes of Family Names by H.B. Guppy, states the following in regard to this surname: “Amongst the old established Wiltshire families I may refer to that of Blake, which is at present best represented around Chippenham. There were Blakes in Warminster in the reign of Elizabeth, and they are still to be found there, and the name has been represented in Ludgershall since the beginning of the 17th century (H.). An influential family of this name owned Pinhill House in Calne in the 17th century”. The name was common in Prestwick in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries AD, and was later very popular in Edinburgh in the seventeenth century.\n\nEarly Bearers of the Surname\n\nThe earliest known bearer of this surname was Wulfhun des Blaca who was documented in the Old English Bynames Register in 901 AD. In Scotland, Luce Blake was tenant of land in Waldefgate, Berwick, around 1266 AD. The Hundred Rolls of 1273 AD, a census of Wales and England, known in Latin as Rotuli Hundredorum lists four bearers of this surname: Hamole Blake (Buckinghamshire), Reginald le Blake (Cambridge), Reyner le Blake (Norfolk), and Edericke le Blacke (Lincolnshire). A one William le Blake was recorded in county Somerset in 1327 AD in Kirby’s Quest during the reign of King Edward III of England. A one Margery la Blak was recorded in the Close Rolls in 1329 AD.
