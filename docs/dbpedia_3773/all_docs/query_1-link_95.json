(Bottom, left to right): Audre Lorde, June Jordan, Barbara Ransby, and another photo of June Jordan.\n\nBy Black Women Radicals\n\nThis reading list offers a brief primer on the radical Black feminist political mandate, which is solidarity with Palestine.\n\nWe, who believe in freedom, we as Black feminists who believe in freedom –– freedom from white supremacy, patriarchy, capitalism, transphobia, queerphobia, ableism, and other oppressions –– unabashedly believe in and stand in solidarity for a free Palestine.\n\nAs students of Black feminist politics and movements, we know and understand that our liberation as Black women, femme, and gender expansive people in the United States, in the belly of the imperial beast, is tethered to the liberation, freedom, and emancipation of all marginalized peoples around the world. We know that we come from long radical and revolutionary traditions of Black women and gender expansive organizers, educators, and activists who have and continue to be committed to the liberation struggles of oppressed and “Third World” peoples.\n\nMore specifically, and especially at this current juncture in Gaza and the West Bank, we know as Black feminists that our political commitments, mandates, and solidarity are bound up and intertwined with the liberation and self-determination of the Palestinian people.\n\nAccording to reports, more than 2,383 Palestinians are dead and 10,814 are injured. The organization, Defense for Children International–Palestine has reported that at least 724 Palestinian children have been killed by the Israeli military since October 7th. This past Friday, October 12th, the Israeli army issued an evacuation order – by way of dropping leaflets – of more than 1.1 million Palestinians in northern Gaza, giving them only 24 hours to leave their homes and move to southern Gaza toward a “safe route.” However, when many Palestinians migrated to southern Gaza, the army bombed the south part of the Gaza strip – the only road in and out of Gaza – killing and injuring hundreds. Israel has cut off Gaza from electricity, fuel, food, water, and humanitarian aid.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, on October 10 and 11, 2023, the Israeli army used white phosphorus - which is a “chemical substance that burns at temperatures hot enough to melt metal” - in military operations in Lebanon and Gaza. The chemical agent is also known to cause fatal birth defects. The organization notes that the use of white phosphorus by the Israeli army violates international humanitarian law.\n\nMoreover, not only has the Israeli military deployed airstrikes on hospitals, journalists, medics, and more, it has dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza, as innocent people flee with nowhere to go.\n\nThe violence and humanitarian crisis we are seeing right before our eyes comes at the heels of an attack by Hamas, officially known as the Islamic Resistance Movement, on October 7th, where members from the group killed more than 1,400 Israelis and kidnapped hundreds of others. We do not condone the killing of innocent lives –– whether Palestinian or Israeli. However, while many media outlets have disseminated misinformation and portrayed a one-sided narrative about the attack, they do not discuss the political, historical, and present-day siege of Gaza by the Israeli military and the systematic violence, expulsion, poverty, displacement, Zionist settler colonialism, sexual and racialized terror, surveillance, Apartheid, and more that Palestinians have endured for decades since the Nakba.\n\nMany media outlets are promoting the Zionist propaganda that Israeli lives are worth more than Palestinian ones by justifying the Israeli State's past and present collective punishment of Palestinians. For years, the Israeli State has ignored the protests, pleas, and outcries of Jewish, Palestinian, and Allied individuals and organizations alike, who repudiate the institutional subordination of Palestinians.\n\nWhat we are seeing before our eyes is genocide. We charge genocide.\n\nThroughout the years, Black feminists such as Angela Y. Davis, bell hooks, Audre Lorde, June Jordan, Toni Morrison, Barbara Ransby, Margo Okazawa-Rey, Beverly Guy-Sheftall, and countless others have made it crystal clear about their solidarity and commitments to Palestine. Many of us cite their work, but what we have seen and observed presently by many Black feminists who claim to have an abolitionist politic and praxis is silence.\n\nWe are calling you out.\n\nYou cite radical and revolutionary Black feminists who have made unwavering theoretical and political commitments to Palestine, but you refuse to be in solidarity yourselves. Just like many of us said about so many White and Non-Black People of Color who were silent during the uprisings against intersectional anti-Black state violence in the U.S., your silence on Palestine is complicity.\n\nWe will not be silent. We will not be complicit.\n\nThis reading list offers a brief primer on the radical Black feminist political mandate, which is solidarity with Palestine.\n\nBlack Feminist Writers and Palestine\n\n〰️\n\nBlack Feminist Writers and Palestine 〰️ Black Feminist Writers and Palestine 〰️\n\nBlack Feminist Writers and Palestine\n\nOn Sunday, October 22nd at 5:30 PM ET/2:30 PM PT, Black Women Radicals hosted the online event, “Black Feminist Writers and Palestine.” This online event focused on the importance of the Black feminist literary and political canon and the mandate of Black feminist commitments to a free Palestine. Moreover, we will cite, discuss, and interrogate the long, extensive, and unwavering tradition of Black feminist educators, poets, writers, organizers, and more who have committed to being in solidarity with Palestine.

It aimed at ending capitalism, racism, imperialism, and sexism and was one of the earliest groups advocating for an intersectional approach to women's oppression. Members of the TWWA argued that women of color faced a \"triple jeopardy\" of race, gender, and class oppression. The TWWA worked to address these intersectional issues, internationally and domestically, specifically focusing much of their efforts in Cuba. Though the organization's roots lay in the Civil rights movement, it soon broadened its focus to include women of color in the US and women of the Third World.\n\nETHEL MINOR AND THE PALESTINE PROBLEM\n\n〰️\n\nETHEL MINOR AND THE PALESTINE PROBLEM 〰️ ETHEL MINOR AND THE PALESTINE PROBLEM 〰️\n\n“Third World Round Up: The Palestine Problem: Test Your Knowledge” by Ethel Minor, SNCC Communications Director\n\nPublished in the June-July 1967 SNCC Newsletter, shortly after the June 1967 Arab-Israeli War. The article would be known as the SNCC Palestine’s Statement. Source: SNCC Digital Gateway.\n\nThe Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC): In the early 1960s, young Black college students conducted sit-ins around America to protest the segregation of restaurants. Ella Baker, a Civil Rights activist and Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) official, invited some of those young Black activists (including Diane Nash, Marion Barry, John Lewis, and James Bevel) to a meeting at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina in April of 1960. From that meeting, the group formed the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). It was made up mostly of Black college students, who practiced peaceful, direct action protests. Ella Baker recommended that the group keep its autonomy and to not affiliate itself with the SCLC or other civil rights groups.\n\nIn 1967, Ethel Minor (November 9, 1938 – September 21, 2022), civil rights activist, journalist, and SNCC Communications Director, wrote the article, “Third World Round Up: The Palestine Problem: Test Your Knowledge”, which was published in the June-July 1967 SNCC Newsletter, shortly after the June 1967 Arab-Israeli War. The article would be known as the SNCC Palestine’s Statement. Born in Chicago, Minor was working as Malcolm X’s secretary when he was assassinated in 1965. An editor of SNCC’s Newsletter, Minor also edited much of Stokely Carmichael’s political correspondence, and edited “Stokely Speaks”, his collection of speeches.\n\nBlack Feminist Solidarity with Palestine\n\n〰️\n\nBlack Feminist Solidarity with Palestine 〰️ Black Feminist Solidarity with Palestine 〰️\n\n“Living Under Israeli Occupation”: Margo Okazawa-Rey Intercollegiate Women’s Studies Visiting Scholar\n\nNovember 13, 2006\n\nFeminist activist and scholar Margo Okazawa-Rey will present a lecture “Living Under Israeli Occupation,” Monday, November 13, 2006 at 4:15 p.m., in the Hampton Room, Malott Commons at Scripps College.\n\nBased on her recent experience in Palestine, Professor Okazawa-Rey will address the daily existence of Palestinian women living under Israeli occupation, the impact of the U.S. and Israeli-led boycott of Hamas leadership, and U.S.-based activists addressing the conflict.

Zionism is a reactionary racist ideology that justifies the expulsion of the Palestinian people from their homes and lands, and attempts to enlist the Jewish masses of Israel and elsewhere in service of imperialism to hold back the Middle East revolution…WE STATE that the Palestinian Revolution is the vanguard of the Arab Revolution and is a part of the anti-colonial revolution which is going on in places such as Vietnam, Mozambique, Angola, Brazil, Laos, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Because of its alliance with imperialism, Zionism opposes the anti-colonial revolution and especially revolutionary change in the Middle East.”\n\n“WE STATE that Israel, Rhodesia, and South Africa are three privileged white settler-states that come into existence by displacing the indigenous peoples from their lands.”\n\nRead the full statement at Black For Palestine.\n\nThe Committee of Black Americans for Truth About the Middle East (C.O.B.A.T.A.M.E.) was co-founded by Paul B.

She served as a Member of Parliament from 1994 to 2003, and from 2009 until her death, and was a deputy minister of arts and culture from 1994 to 1996. A member of the African National Congress (ANC) political party, she served on the ANC's National Executive Committee and headed its Women's League. Madikizela-Mandela was known to her supporters as the \"Mother of the Nation\".\n\nWhile many people focus on Nelson Mandela’s solidarity with Palestine, many overlook Winnie Mandela’s political commitments to Palestine as well. As Adama Munu’s notes in “Reflections on Winnie Mandela's relationship with Palestine.”\n\n”Winnie believed that the struggles in South Africa during colonial rule were a reflection of practices taking place against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and was in direct support of what she believed was an extension of South Africa's fight against inequality, stating in 2004: \"Apartheid Israel can be defeated, just as apartheid in South Africa was defeated.\"\n\n“This comment came as she addressed a meeting arranged by a Palestinian solidarity organization in Lenasia, Johannesburg, and she was known to be a staunch supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.”\n\nShirley Graham Dubois and Palestine\n\n〰️\n\nShirley Graham Dubois and Palestine 〰️ Shirley Graham Dubois and Palestine 〰️\n\nOn Imperialism, Neocolonialism, and Africa, A Speech by Shirley Graham Du Bois (1970), Speaking at UCLA\n\nSource: Color Collective Press and Abolition Notes\n\nPhoto: Portrait of Shirley Graham (1896-1977), later Shirley Graham Du Bois, by Carl Van Vechten, taken July 18, 1946.
