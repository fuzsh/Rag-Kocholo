        "text": "Child killer Robert Black, who murdered four children across the UK in the 1980s, has died in prison.\n\nGrangemouth-born Black was serving multiple life sentences for the brutal abductions and murders of four girls in the early 1980s.\n\nBlack died of natural causes in Maghaberry prison, it was confirmed today.\n\nIn a statement, the Northern Ireland Prison Service confirmed that a 68-year-old prisoner had died at the high-security jail.\n\n\"While this is not being treated as suspicious, the Prison Service has informed the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Coroner, and Prisoner Ombudsman,\" the statement added.\n\n\"It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.\"\n\nThe paedophile was serving a total of 12 life sentences for murder and kidnap.\n\nBlack was found guilty in 1994 of three child murders in the 80s – those of Susan Maxwell, 11, from the Scottish Borders, five-year-old Caroline Hogg, of Edinburgh, and Sarah Harper, 10, from Morley, near Leeds.\n\nRead more : Serial killer Robert Black 'intended to murder two girls from the same town'\n\nHis reign of terror finally ended in 1990 when he was caught red-handed with a six-year-girl hooded, bound, gagged and stuffed in a sleeping bag in the back of his van in the Scottish village of Stow.\n\nHe had sexually assaulted her moments earlier.\n\nBut in 2012 he was prosecuted for a fourth murder – that of Jennifer Cardy, who was snatched in 1981 as she cycled to a friend’s house in Ballinderry, County Antrim, Northern Ireland.\n\nHe was also suspected of involvement in other killings.\n\nHe had long been the prime suspect in the case of missing 13-year-old Genette Tate, who was last seen in a rural lane in Aylesbeare, Devon, in 1978.\n\nNo trace of the newspaper delivery girl has ever been found. All that remained at the scene were her bike and scattered papers."
