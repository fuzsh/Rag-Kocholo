        "text": "The Second World War was documented on a huge scale by thousands of photographers and artists who created millions of pictures. American military photographers representing all of the armed services covered the battlefronts around the world. Every activity of the war was depicted--training, combat, support services, and much more. On the home front, the many federal war agencies produced and collected pictures, posters, and cartoons on such subjects as war production, rationing, and civilian relocation.\n\nThe pictures described in this list are from the holdings of the Still Picture Branch (RRSS) of the National Archives and Records Administration. Most are from the records of the Army Signal Corps (Record Group 111), Department of the Navy (Record Group 80), Coast Guard (Record Group 26), Marine Corps (Record Group 127), and the Office of War Information (Record Group 208). Others were selected from the records of 12 additional agencies.\n\nPictures are listed by subject and campaign. Original captions are in quotation marks. Photographers, artists, locations, and dates, when known, are also included. This information is followed by the local identification number and the National Archives Identifier number (NAID). The National Archives Identifier number is linked to the online catalog where a digitized file of the photograph will be available for download. The images included in this list are only available in black and white. The selected photographs are in the public domain and have no Use Restrictions.\n\nJonathan Heller researched, selected, and arranged the items for this list and wrote these introductory remarks in 1990. Additional updates to this introduction were made as recently as May 2021.\n\nContact Us\n\nLeaders\n\n1. President Franklin D.
