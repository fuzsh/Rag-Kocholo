        "text": "Robert Black was born on 24 August 1893 in Arrowtown, in the south of New Zealand.\n\nHe was educated at Otago Boys' High School in Dunedin, one of the oldest boysâ€™ secondary schools. He discovered rugby at high school and then at the University of Otago.\n\nHe played for Otago at a provincial level and for Buller Rugby Union team in 1914. His speed and rapid acceleration made him an excellent first five-eight.\n\nHis performances earned him a selection to play for the All Blacks in the first test against the Wallabies on 18 July 1914, during their tour of Australia in 1914.\n\nThe All Blacks won 5-0, and he played in six of the tour's matches, scoring three tries. This would be his only selection for the national team, and six of the All Blacks who took part in the 1913 tour were killed in the Great War.\n\nWith the outbreak of the First World War, he enlisted on 18 November 1915 as a Corporal in the Otago Mounted Rifles, which earned the nickname 'The Unlucky Otagos' as no other New Zealand regiment lost as many men as this one during the conflict.\n\nAfter leaving New Zealand, he transferred to the Canterbury Regiment and was sent to fight in France. He saw active service during the Somme offensive. Black was killed in action on 21 September 1916, aged 23.\n\nHe has no known grave and is commemorated on the Caterpillar Valley New Zealand Memorial, Longueval, Somme."
