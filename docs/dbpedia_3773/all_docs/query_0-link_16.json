        "text": "SUSAN MAXWELL was one of the tragic victims of serial killer Robert Black.\n\nBlack, who died in prison in 2016, was charged with murdering four schoolgirls while he was still alive but is thought to have been behind many more horrific crimes.\n\nWho was Susan Maxwell?\n\nSusan was a child who lived in the village of Cornhill-on-Tweed with her family.\n\nThe village is close to the border between Scotland and England.\n\nSusan was abducted on July 30, 1982, when she was just eleven years old.\n\nShe disappeared from the Scottish town of Coldstream while walking home from a game of tennis.\n\nHer body was later found 264 miles from where she had last been seen.\n\nHer killer had cruelly dumped the little girl' s body on the A518 near Uttoxer.\n\nWho are the parents of Susan Maxwell?\n\nSusan's parents are Liz and Fordyce Maxwell.\n\nAfter the death of their daughter's killer in 2016, the couple released a statement.\n\nIt read: \"It's a great relief to know that he will never be released from prison.\n\n\"He has been fortunate enough to die of natural causes, which is more than he deserved.\"\n\nThey added: \"All his innocent victims, including our beloved daughter Susan died in horrific and terrifying circumstances.\n\n\"He brought us and the parents of the other children a lifetime of misery and will be mourned by no one.\"\n\nLiz and Fordyce have daughter called Jacqueline and a son called Thomas who welcomed a daughter of his own in December 2015.\n\nTheir granddaughter was born just weeks before Robert Black's death in prison.\n\nJournalist Fordyce passed away in November 2022.\n\nWhat happened to Susan Maxwell?\n\nSusan vanished in 1982 after walking the half-mile route home from her tennis lesson.\n\nIt was the first time she had been allowed to walk home by herself.\n\nSusan's body was later found dumped in undergrowth near Staffordshire.\n\nShe had been bound, gagged and sexually assaulted by Black before her body was discarded.\n\nIt later revealed at an inquest that Susan had been kept in Black's van for over 24 hours before he dumped her body.\n\nThe van driver is said to have continued with his deliveries across Scotland with Susan's body in his van.\n\nHe then started his journey back down to London and got rid of Susan's body on the way.\n\nBlack was found guilty of murdering Susan and two other schoolgirls, Sarah Harper and Caroline Hogg, in May 1994.\n\nIn 2011, he was convicted of killing Jennifer Cardy in 1981.\n\nBlack died of a heart attack in 2016.\n\nHe was in prison serving 12 life terms at the time.\n\nSince his arrest in 1990 Black has been connected to a number of other similar crimes but was never formally charged with any other murders.\n\nWhen he died he was just weeks away from being charged with the 1978 killing of Genette Tate."
