        "text": "Serial child killer Robert Black has died in prison aged 68 meaning that the family of a murdered teenager will likely never learn what happened to their daughter.\n\nHe was just weeks away from being charged with Genette Tate 1970's murder, according to police sources.\n\nThough the Northern Ireland Prison Service would not confirm which inmate died in non-suspicious circumstances, prison sources said last night that the dead prisoner was Black.\n\nHis reign of terror was ended in 1990 when he was caught red-handed by police with a barely alive six-year-old girl hooded, bound, gagged and stuffed in a sleeping bag in the back of his van in the Scottish village of Stow. He had sexually assaulted her moments earlier.\n\n\"The Prison Service has confirmed that a 68-year-old prisoner has died at Maghaberry Prison. While this is not being treated as suspicious, the Prison Service has informed the PSNI, Coroner, and Prisoner Ombudsman. It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.\"\n\nA NI Prison Service spokesman\n\nIn 2012, he was found guilty of the 1981 murder of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy, from Ballinderry, Co Antrim.\n\nHe was also suspected of involvement in other killings.\n\nHe had long been the prime suspect in the case of missing 13-year-old Genette, who was last seen in a rural lane in Aylesbeare, Devon, in 1978.\n\nNo trace of the newspaper delivery girl has ever been found. All that remained at the scene were her bike and scattered papers.\n\nIn 2014 her father threw his weight by moves by police and prosecutors to to launch a case against Black based on his previous convictions.\n\nBut Black's death means that the Tate family are unlikely to ever learn whether the killer was involved in their daughter's disappearance.\n\nA NI Prison Service spokeswoman said: \"The Prison Service has confirmed that a 68-year-old prisoner has died at Maghaberry Prison. While this is not being treated as suspicious, the Prison Service has informed the PSNI, Coroner, and Prisoner Ombudsman. It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.\"\n\nBlack has been linked to a number of other historic disappearances. A retired Scottish detective investigated the killer for more than 20 years said Genette's was the only realistic prosecution that was outstanding.\n\n“Now you're only really probably talking about Genette Tate.”\n\nRoger Orr\n\nFormer Lothian and Borders detective chief superintendent Roger Orr previously revealed that 40 cases were reviewed by police in the 1990s to assess Black's potential involvement.\n\nHe was eliminated as a suspect from many of them, and Mr Orr said at the time: “Now you're only really probably talking about Genette Tate.”\n\nMr Orr added: “My gut feeling is there are gaps there, he's done more. “That's easy to say, but it's much harder to prove.”\n\nLast night Genette's ailing father John, speaking from his Manchester home, said: \"I hoped that one day he might have made a deathbed confession.\n\n\"But I don't know what happens now. The police have told me that they are going to have a big meeting on Wednesday about it.\n\n\"I would have liked to have seen Robert Black go on trial charged with Genette's kidnap and murder but now that has been denied us. We have waited all these years for a breakthrough and it seems we have been denied again just as something major was about to happen.\n\n\"The police are not telling me much at the moment but this is a major blow to our hopes of trying to discover the truth.\"\n\nA source said: \"Black has denied the Tate family justice after all these years. I guess that will be end of it now, they will never know what happened to Genette. It's a cruel blow especially as the police had been working so hard and very quietly behind the scenes to put him on trial like the police had done with Jennifer Cardy which was such a similar case.\"\n\nBlack's killing spree was finally ended in 1990 when he was caught red-handed by police with a barely-alive six-year-old girl hooded, bound, gagged and stuffed in a sleeping bag in the back of his van in the Scottish village of Stow. He had sexually assaulted her moments earlier.\n\nThe brother of one of Robert Black's victims has said he carries no hate for the serial killer.\n\nPhillip Cardy, whose sister Jennifer was murdered by the paedophile, said he hopes people will take time to remember his victims."
