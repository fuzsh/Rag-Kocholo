        "text": "Tonight, Channel 5 will tell the horrifying story of the paedophile and murderer Robert Black.\n\nDocumentary The Child Snatcher: Manhunt will air at 9pm and recount when Caroline Hogg's summer evening out playing turned into her horrifying death. The Scottish girl, from a coastal area of Edinburgh, Portobello, was last seen playing on the Promenade before her body was found in a ditch 10 days later.\n\nShe was just five years old when she was abducted, sexually assaulted, and murdered by Robert Black. Now, the murders of her and three others will feature on the new Channel 5 show.\n\nRead more: Vile brute stopped girlfriend using the toilet during five-year 'campaign of humiliation'\n\nWho was Robert Black?\n\nRobert Black was an evil child killer from Grangemouth - a town in Scotland. He set out to prowl the roads of the UK in search of victims, committing various killings in the '80s and '90s.\n\nThe killer was put up to be fostered within weeks of his birth in 1947. A couple from Kinlochleven in the West Highlands who took him in both died within 11 years and Black spent the rest of his childhood in care homes in Falkirk and Edinburgh.\n\nWho did Robert kill?\n\nAs well as Caroline Hogg, Robert also sexually assaulted and killed several other children.\n\nThe child snatcher's long campaign of terror linked him to a number of unsolved crimes. In 1990, he was caught by police with a barely alive six-year-old girl hooded, bound, gagged and stuffed in a sleeping bag in the back of his van in the Scottish village of Stow. He had sexually assaulted her moments earlier.\n\nIn 1994, he was found guilty of three child murders from the 1980s; those of 11-year-old Susan Maxwell in the Scottish Borders and five-year-old Caroline and Sarah Harper, 10, from Morley, near Leeds, as well as a failed abduction bid in Nottingham in 1988.\n\nIn 2011, he was found guilty of the 1981 murder of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy, from Ballinderry, Country Antrim. Black, who lived out his last days in Maghaberry high security prison in Co Antrim, was also suspected of involvement in other killings and unexplained disappearances.\n\nHe had long been the prime suspect in the case of missing 13-year-old Genette Tate, who was last seen in a rural lane in Aylesbeare, Devon, in 1978.\n\nWhen did Robert die?\n\nRobert died in January 2018 of heart disease and was cremated. His ashes were scattered at sea after prison authorities in Northern Ireland revealed no one wanted his remains."
