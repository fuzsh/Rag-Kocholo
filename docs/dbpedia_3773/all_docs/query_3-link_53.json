According to Forbes magazine (2022), data from Crunchbase shows that Latino entrepreneurs receive only 2 percent of U.S. venture capital investments, despite making up nearly half of the net new small business growth between 2007 and 2017. üï∞ There are many leaders and funds stepping up to bridge this gap. While this happens though, many Latino entrepreneurs continue to launch businesses in a broad range of industries including F&B, Retail, Law, Consulting, and tech - to name a few. It was rewarding to meet scores of #leaders who have built great, successful businesses despite the gap in access to funding. Thanks LBAN! These events are a testament to the power of diversity in driving innovation. Let's keep it up! #StanfordLBAN #LatinoFounders #DiversityInTech\n\nüì∞ A lovely midweek read for all our Cambridge colleagues and connections ‚Äì Teri F. Willey recalls her five year tenure as founding director of Cambridge Enterprise. Tony Quested asks the questions, and there are some really interesting stories from way back in 2006, when Cambridge Enterprise was created as part of Cambridge University to improve knowledge transfer and research impact. The organisation, heading towards its 20th year, is responsible for facilitating and using the incredibly high-quality of the University research to \"create globally leading economic and social impact\". Take a few minutes and read the background to this Cambridge institution in its own right, that is now deeply embedded in the country's innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem. A few takeaway phrases from us: ‚Äì \"How did you go about putting your successful model in place? Listening, and asking a lot of questions to a lot of people and listening some more.\" ‚Äì \"We typically had equity in around 80 companies at any one time while I was there and under Geraldine‚Äôs leadership worked with each one to see how we could support their success.\" ‚Äì \"we learned we had not communicated well enough that we were there for the University of Cambridge: a limited company, limited by shares with only one share holder: The University of Cambridge. We needed to show and communicate that we were not ‚Äúother‚Äù.\" Thanks for sharing, both. #Cambridge Business Weekly newspaper\n\nExcited to share that the Financial Times has once again published a letter authored by our General Partner, Ekaterina Almasque! In a recent article, FT reported a decline in funding for UK university spinouts, marking the first decrease in a decade. Yet, the article didn‚Äôt explore the factors hindering these spinouts from achieving global competitiveness. Katya‚Äôs letter highlights the following critical challenges faced by UK university spinouts: üìäEquity retention disparities compared to European and US counterparts. üéìThe deterrent effect of excessive university control on potential investors ü§ùThe critical role of VC firms in bridging academia and business. The key message here is clear: It‚Äôs not just about the level of funding but removing the barriers that impede their progress and harnessing their true potential.
