        "text": "Child killer Robert Black, who murdered four children across the UK in the 1980s, has died in prison aged 68.\n\nBlack was serving multiple life sentences for the brutal abductions and murders of four girls in the early 1980s.\n\nHe was born on 21 April 1947 in Grangemouth, Stirlinghshire, to Jessie Hunter Black, who immediately had him fostered.\n\nHe was brought up by a couple in their 50s, Jack and Margaret Tulip until he was 11 when he was put in a children's home in Falkirk.\n\nAged 12, he was transferred schools after attempting to rape a girl in a field with two other boys.\n\nHe started work aged 15 as a delivery boy in Greenock near Glasgow. He later admitted that, while on his rounds, he molested 30 to 40 girls.\n\nIn 1963, he received his first conviction for luring a seven-year-old girl from a play park to a disused air raid shelter after promising to show her a box of kittens.\n\nHe choked her until she fell unconscious and then molested her. He then left her for dead.\n\nRead more:\n\nShe was later found wandering on her own, in tears and bleeding.\n\nRemarkably, Black was not incarcerated for the crime after being found guilty of only \"lewd and libidinous\" behaviour.\n\nIn 1966, he returned to Kinlochleven, when he had been raised, to again target a seven-year-old girl, who was the daughter of a couple he was lodging with.\n\nWhen he was left to babysit, Black instead took the opportunity to repeatedly violate her.\n\nHe was convicted of three counts of indecent assault and sent to borstal at Polmont near Falkirk for a year.\n\nOn August 12 1981 he committed his first known murder, killing nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy. She was cycling from her home in Ballinderry, County Antrim in Northern Ireland to meet a friend.\n\nHer bicycle was recovered close to her home. Her body was found at McKee's Dam near Hillsborough, County Down six days later. She had been sexually assaulted.\n\nBlack, who at the time was working in the area for a poster-delivery company, was convicted of her kidnap, sexual assault and murder at Armagh Crown Court on 27 October 2011.\n\nOn July 30, 1982 he killed Susan Maxwell.\n\nThe 11-year-old schoolgirl lived on her family's farm near the village of Cornhill on Tweed on the English side of the Scottish border.\n\nOn July 30, she was walking back from a tennis match in Coldstream two miles away when she vanished.\n\nHer game finished at 4pm and Susan was last seen crossing the bridge back into England over the River Tweed.\n\nTwo weeks later, her body was found 264 miles away lying a ditch at a roadside lay-by just outside Uttoxeter in the Midlands.\n\nStill wearing her T-shirt and shorts, her pants had been removed, folded and placed under the dead girl's cheek.\n\nBlack had been travelling between Edinburgh and Newcastle on the day Susan vanished and often visited a friend in London via the Midlands.\n\nOn July 8 1983, he snatched five-year-old Caroline Hogg off the street as she was playing.\n\nCaroline, from Portobello near Edinburgh, who was wearing a princess dress, was given permission to play for five minutes in the school grounds opposite her house.\n\nEyewitnesses saw her with a scruffy man playing in the promenade and the funfair.\n\nTen days later her badly decomposed and naked body was found dumped in the East Midlands.\n\nBlack was later traced to the area near Stafford.\n\nOn March 26 1986 he murdered Sarah Harper, 10, who lived in Morley in greater Leeds.\n\nShe was sent on an errand to buy a loaf of bread at the corner shop and was last seen heading down a short alleyway on her way home.\n\nThree and a half weeks later, a man walking his dog along the River Trent at Wilford near Nottingham spotted her body floating in the water.\n\nHer anorak was gone, as was her skirt.\n\nA post-mortem showed she was subjected to a violent sexual assault.\n\nBlack was later traced to the area.\n\nOn Sunday April 4 1988 he tried and failed to abduct Teresa Thornhill, 15, in the the Radford area of Nottingham.\n\nIn 1990, Black was finally court when he was stopped by police in the Scottish village of Stow with a six-year-old girl hooded, gagged, bound and stuffed in a sleeping bag in the back of his van.\n\nHe had snatched her from the village fate 20 minutes earlier and had taken her to a lay-by to molest her.\n\nBlack was sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnap and attack.\n\nWhile he was in jail, detectives linked him to the other murders, and in 1994, he was found guilty of killing Susan, Caroline and Sarah Harper, 10.\n\nGenette Louise Tate disappeared on 19 August 1978 at the age of 13 from her home town of Aylesbeare in Devon, while she was delivering newspapers.\n\nInvestigators tried to link her disappearance to Black in 2005 but they did not find sufficient evidence to charge him.\n\nBlack died of natural causes in Maghaberry prison, it was confirmed today."
