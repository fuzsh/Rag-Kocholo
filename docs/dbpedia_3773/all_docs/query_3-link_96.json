        "text": "Choose A Facility:\n\nNeyland Stadium\n\nOne of the most iconic landmarks in sport, Neyland Stadium is the sixth-largest college football venue in the nation.\n\nMore Than a Century of Tradition\n\nTennessee Athletics in the fall of 2021 celebrated 100 years of Volunteers football at historic Neyland Stadium, ushering in a new era. During its first century of service to the Big Orange faithful, the venue grew in both capacity and reverence while evolving into one of the most iconic sporting venues in the world.\n\nSix Tennessee teams that captured national championships have called Neyland Stadium home, while 22 players and four head coaches authored careers worthy of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame on Neyland’s hallowed ground. The 2024 season will be the 103rd in the venue that has seen historic upgrades.\n\nRecent decades have brought six-figure expansion, development of innovative premium-seating sections and stadium-wide amenity enhancements. Efforts to prepare Neyland Stadium for its next century of service continue thanks to a comprehensive stadium master plan fueled by the My All Campaign.\n\nRenovation scope completed prior to the 2022 football season brought Neyland Stadium's capacity to 101,915.\n\nNeyland Stadium Photo Gallery\n\nThe introduction of new lower-west club and upper-north social deck spaces for the start of the 2022 season brought Neyland Stadium’s seating capacity to 101,915—sixth largest among college football venues.\n\nOther recent stadium enhancements include a stadium kitchen, commissary and loading dock (2024), upgrades to stadium skyboxes (2024), the installation of a stadium-wide Wi-Fi network (2023), restoration of the historic V-O-L-S letters along the top of the facility’s south end (2022), a second videoboard on the upper-north deck (2022) and bronze statues honoring four of Tennessee’s Black football trailblazers (2021).\n\nIn June 2023, the UT Board of Trustees approved Tennessee Athletics’ request to adjust the scope and budget of the ongoing Neyland Stadium renovations project to $337 million. The project includes new deliverables each football season through the fall of 2026. Future updates feature necessary upgrades to the south side and perimeter of the stadium, including the widening of concourses, construction of expanded gates and entryways and additional restrooms and concessions areas.\n\nVice Chancellor/Director of Athletics Danny White’s vision for Neyland Stadium aligns with Tennessee Athletics’ stated goals of modernizing the fan and visitor experience through enhanced amenities and diversified seating options, improving fan safety and security and aligning stadium features and aesthetics with campus architectural standards.\n\nA critical element in the plan is major and necessary upgrades to the south side and perimeter of the stadium, including the widening of concourses, construction of expanded gates and entryways and provision of additional restrooms and concessions areas. The delivery of this primary component will dramatically improve fan comfort and safety, reduce wait times and allow for more food and beverage offerings.\n\nThe ongoing renovations phase will provide annual deliverables through an anticipated project completion date of Fall 2026.\n\nNeyland Stadium provides an unparalleled college football experience, as evidenced by 13 consecutive sellouts entering the 2024 campaign. The Vols sported a 13-1 record in the venue during the 2022 and 2023 seasons, outscoring opponents 640-277. In 2023, Tennessee led the SEC and ranked top four in the nation in both average attendance (101,915) and accumulated attendance (713,405).\n\nHistory\n\nThe present day Neyland Stadium, Shields-Watkins Field, had its beginning in 1919. Col. W.S. Shields, president of Knoxville's City National Bank and a UT trustee, provided the initial capital to prepare and equip an athletic field. Thus, when the field was completed in March 1921, it was called Shields-Watkins Field in honor of the donor and his wife, Alice Watkins-Shields.\n\nThe stadium, apart from the field it grew to enclose, came to bear its own distinguished name—Neyland Stadium. It was named for the man most responsible for the growth and development of Tennessee's proud football tradition. General Robert R. Neyland served as head coach from 1926-1952, with two interruptions for military service.\n\nGeneral Neyland\n\nThe history and tradition of Tennessee football began when Gen. Robert Reese Neyland came to Tennessee as an ROTC instructor and backfield coach in 1925 and was named head football coach in 1926. From that date, Tennessee was in the college football arena to stay.\n\nNeyland, who came to Tennessee as an Army captain and left as a brigadier general, brought one of the most efficient single-wing offenses in the country to go with an unyielding defense. It was Gene McEver who kicked off the Neyland era with his 98-yard return of the opening kickoff in the 1928 Alabama game, a game the underdog Vols won 15-13. Each of his succeeding eras would be highlighted by similar big plays. Johnny Butler's 56-yard run against Alabama in 1939 and Hank Lauricella's 75-yard run against Texas in the 1951 Cotton Bowl.\n\nNeyland's 1939 Vols were the last to shut out each of its regular season opponents. Over the course of his career, 112 of 216 opponents failed to score against his Tennessee teams and the Vols still own an NCAA record for holding opponents scoreless for 71 consecutive quarters.\n\nNeyland's teams won Southern Conference titles in 1927 and 1932, piling up undefeated streaks of 33 and 28 games along the way, and SEC championships in 1938, 1939, 1940, 1946 and 1951. In addition, Neyland-coached teams won four national championships. The Vols were consensus national champions in 1951 and Neyland's 21-year record at Tennessee was 173-31-12.\n\nHis legacy continues to live through his name on the football stadium, UT's indoor football complex (Neyland-Thompson Sports Center) and the road paralleling the Tennessee River (Neyland Drive).\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFirst game as Shields-Watkins Field:\n\nSept. 24, 1921\n\nTennessee - 27 / Emory & Henry - 0\n\nDedication game as Neyland Stadium:\n\nOct. 20, 1962\n\nAlabama - 27 / Tennessee - 7\n\nFirst game on artificial turf:\n\nSept. 14, 1968\n\nTennessee - 17 / Georgia - 17\n\nFinal game on artificial turf:\n\nNov. 27, 1993\n\nTennessee - 62 / Vanderbilt - 14\n\nAttendance:\n\nSince attendance records were first kept beginning in the 1946 season, more than 37 million fans have watched Big Orange football in Neyland Stadium.
