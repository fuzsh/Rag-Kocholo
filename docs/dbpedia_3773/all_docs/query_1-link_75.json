        "text": "Share\n\nThe island of Majorca, located off the east coast of Spain, is a renowned tourist destination filled with a multitude of restaurants, turquoise beaches, hidden natural spaces, and a varied cultural offering. From the bustling atmosphere of its capital, Palma, to the villages of the Serra de Tramuntana mountains, Majorca is a paradise waiting to be explored.\n\nDay 1: Palma\n\nMorning\n\nPalma, the capital of Majorca, is an excellent starting point for a 48-hour tour of the island. It is a city full of architectural beauties and first-class gastronomic proposals, where the traditional and the modern are combined. And here, there is nothing like starting the day with an 'ensaimada', with several pastry shops and traditional bakeries to choose from where you can try the different flavors of this local delicacy. The typical Majorcan ensaimada is a plain one, but the versions with custard, cream, quince, apricot, chocolate, or sobrasada sausage are also delicious. Among the top bakeries in Palma is Can Joan de s'Aigo. Founded in 1700, it offers homemade ice cream or hot chocolate (depending on the season) to accompany the classic ensaimadas.\n\nThe plain ensaimada is usually served with sprinkled sugar (© nito100/iStock)\n\nA few steps from this establishment is Palma Cathedral ('Catedral-Basilica of Santa Maria de Mallorca'), which is of a Mediterranean Gothic style. Among its stand-out architectural features are: its large rose window; the chapel of the Holy Sacrament, decorated in 2006 by the Majorcan artist Miquel Barceló; and the interior space adapted by Antoni Gaudí. We shouldn't forget to mention the brilliant sea views from this monument too. Right next to the Cathedral is the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, a former fortress from the 14th century and the official residence of the monarchs during their stays in Mallorca.\n\nA view of Palma de Mallorca (© Mlenny/iStock)\n\nNot far from here is La Lonja de Palma, a gorgeous Gothic building that often hosts traveling exhibitions. From this point, you can stroll through the old town, where you will see numerous terraces and fashionable stores, small palaces with typical Majorcan patios, historical buildings with marés stone façades (characteristic of the Balearic Islands), and promenades such as Paseo del Borne. Nearby is the Casal Solleric, an exhibition space with free admission, housed in an 18th-century palace.\n\nAt mid-morning, enjoy a refreshing drink or a coffee on the stately, quiet, and elegant patio of Cappuccino. If you'd prefer a snack before lunch, try a 'variat mallorquí', a combination of 'ensaladilla rusa' (Spanish potato salad), 'frit mallorquín' (roasted meat with a variety of diced vegetables), croquettes, meatballs, and calamari. There are numerous places that offer it, among them Bar Bosch, where you can also taste a 'llonguet', a typical Majorcan bread, accompanied by sobrasada.\n\nOnce you have recovered your energy, you can visit the Plaza Mayor and the Plaza de Cort, where the Town Hall is located. In front of it, there is a 600-year-old tree known as L'olivera de Cort, a symbol of the capital. During this walk, there are many small stores selling sobrasadas made from black pork, the island's native breed.\n\nLunch\n\nThere is no shortage of options for lunch in the old town. One of them is Aromata, where Andreu Genestra offers informal, urban gastronomy in a stately 17th-century courtyard. Another alternative is DINS Santi Taura, in the lively El Llorenç Parc de la Mar hotel. Awarded One MICHELIN Star, the restaurant boasts an open kitchen which allows a limited number of diners to observe the preparation of Chef Santi Taura's traditional yet modern dishes. Based on local produce of exceptional quality, the 'Origen' tasting menu, which is reinvented each season, encapsulates the different flavors of the island.\n\nOne of the dishes at DINS Santi Taura (© Tarek Serraj)\n\nAfternoon\n\nIn the historic center of the city is the modernist-style building that once housed the Gran Hotel de Palma. It is now the headquarters of the CaixaForum and exhibits, among other gems, works by the painter Hermenegildo Anglada Camarasa. Opposite, Fornet de la Soca, a bakery dedicated to old recipes, offers both sweet and savory traditional specialties, such as 'cocas de trampó', 'cocarrois', and the Majorcan 'panades'.\n\nA little further away from the city center, surrounded by nature, is the Fundació Pilar i Joan Miró. This former ceramics factory is now a museum exhibiting the artist Joan Miró's original studio, a permanent collection, and temporary exhibitions.\n\nAt sunset, it is worth visiting Bellver Castle, an emblematic monument of the capital, for a panoramic view of Palma and the Mediterranean coast. Interestingly, this castle is the only one in Spain with a circular floor plan.\n\nThe 14th-century Bellver Castle in Palma, Majorca (© jewhyte/iStock)\n\nDinner and Evening\n\nBack in the historic center of the city, one of the many great options for dinner is the MICHELIN-Starred Zaranda, by Chef Fernando Pérez Arellano, located in the Es Princep hotel. It offers different tasting menus with nods to its original location, a former tannery.\n\nIf you prefer to remain isolated from the hustle and bustle of the city, then near Palma, in the town of Llucmajor, is the eponymous restaurant of the aforementioned chef Andreu Genestra. It offers three menus, one of them vegetarian, all showcasing Mediterranean cuisine. Andreu's focus on sustainable gastronomy has led to his restaurant being awarded, in addition to One MICHELIN Star, a Green Star. The establishment has its own vegetable garden, a water reuse system, and solar panels, among other measures that show how haute cuisine can go hand in hand with environmental responsibility.\n\nCreativity is one of the hallmarks of Chef Fernando Pérez Arellano (© Zaranda/Nando Esteva)\n\nA day exploring the city calls for a relaxing drink to finish off the evening. Right in the historic center and in an old Majorcan house, Bar Abaco is one of the best options; if you prefer to enjoy views of the city's harbor, the Sky Bar, on the rooftop of Hotel Hostal Cuba, is the ideal destination.\n\nAfterwards, any of the 12 cozy rooms at the Two MICHELIN Key Hotel Can Cera, in Palma's old town, are a perfect place to rest after your first day on the island. This 17th-century Majorcan palace combines elegant traditional elements with modern comforts. Another option, also holding Two MICHELIN Keys, is Cap Rocat, which is located in a former fortress about 20 kilometers from the capital, in a protected natural area, and offers unique views of the bay of Palma.\n\nOne of the spectacular sea views from the Cap Rocat hotel\n\nDay 2: Serra de Tramuntana\n\nMorning\n\nToday, it's time to travel out of Palma to the Serra de Tramuntana mountain range. But before setting off, starting the day with a good coffee in any of our recommended hotels is always a good idea. Es Princep, for example, offers breakfast and coffee on the terrace overlooking the promenade. Wherever you choose, it's worth reserving a little space for an essential sweet treat during today's journey: the 'coca de patata' from Valldemossa.\n\nYou can try this spongy, potato-based bun at Ca'n Molinas, and it is made even better if you accompany it with an almond ice cream in summer or a hot chocolate in winter. While you savor it, you can stroll through the narrow cobbled streets of Valldemossa, a small village in the Serra de Tramuntana, which hosted visitors from the world of culture in the 19th century such as George Sand, Rubén Darío, and Frédéric Chopin. The latter said of the village: \"Everything that the poet and the painter can dream of, nature has created in this place. It is the most beautiful place in the world.\" Once you've seen its unbeatable natural views, its Carthusian monastery, and its cypress garden, you'll be inclined to agree.\n\nThe charming village of Valldemossa (© Alex/iStock)\n\nFollowing the route of the Serra de Tramuntana mountains, you'll arrive at the viewpoint of Sa Foradada, which lets you glimpse all the immense beauty of both the sea and a small peninsula. Next to it is the Son Marroig estate, where Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria once lived.\n\nA few minutes away by car is another of the island's most visited enclaves: Sóller, a village with a small square framed by the modernist façade of San Bartolomeu Church. From Palma, this destination can also be reached by the Ferrocarril de Sóller, a wooden train inaugurated in 1912.\n\nLunch\n\nYou can enjoy a typically Majorcan menu based on local, seasonal produce and a wide range of flavors at Ca'n Boqueta, by Chef Kiko Martorell. Located in a traditional house that's emblematic of the island, the restaurant boasts views of the mountains and a special charm in addition to its great value cooking that has been recognized with a MICHELIN Bib Gourmand.\n\nScallop carpaccio with 'caragols' herb sorbet (© Ca'n Boqueta/Kiko Martorell)\n\nAfternoon\n\nFour kilometers from the center of Sóller is the picturesque village of Port de Sóller. It is well worth taking a walk by the seafront and trying an ice cream made from the area's famous oranges. After your stroll, drive along the narrow, winding road, surrounded by nature, towards your next destination: Sa Calobra. One of the island's best-loved areas for cyclists, this hidden natural spot is also accessible by boat from Port de Sóller.\n\nAnother attraction hidden among the mountain range is the village of Fornalutx, known as one of the most beautiful in Spain. It's worth getting lost in its charming cobblestone streets and stone houses, surrounded by orange and lemon trees.\n\nAn aerial view of Sa Calobra (© jotily/iStock)\n\nDinner and Evening\n\nTo end the trip with magnificent sea views, book a table on the terrace of the MICHELIN-Starred Béns d'Avall restaurant. Behind the stoves, Benet and Jaume Vicens (father and son) offer seasonal Majorcan cuisine, made with ingredients from their orchards, their chicken farm, and their olive groves, from which they obtain their own oil with a unique flavor. All of this is indicative of the team's commitment to sustainability, for which the restaurant has been awarded a MICHELIN Green Star.\n\nOne of the many delicious dishes at Béns d'Avall\n\nAfter this, La Residencia, A Belmond Hotel, in Deià, is the ideal place to relax, sleep, and finish your trip in style. This villa, built between the 16th and 17th centuries, has spectacular panoramic views of the Serra de Tramuntana, surrounded by olive and citrus trees. The rooms are spacious and decorated in traditional Majorcan style.\n\nOne of the many incredible exclusive features at La Residencia, A Belmond Hotel\n\nAddress Book\n\nBar Ábaco: Carrer de Sant Joan, 1, Palma, 07012\n\nBar Bosch: Pl. del Rei Joan Carles I, 6, Bajos, Palma, 07012\n\nBellver Castle: Carrer Camilo José Cela, s/n, Ponent, Palma 07014\n\nCan Joan de s'Aigo: Carrer Can Sanç, 10, Palma, 07001\n\nCa'n Molinas: Via Blanquerna, 15, Valldemossa, 07170\n\nCappuccino: Carrer de Sant Miquel, 53, Palma, 07002\n\nCasal Solleric: Pg. del Born, 27, Centre, Palma 07012\n\nFornet de la Soca: Plaça de Weyler, 9, Palma, 07001\n\nFundació Pilar i Joan Miró: C/ de Saridakis, 29, Ponent, Palma 07015\n\nGran Hotel – CaixaForum Palma: Plaça de Weyler, 3, Centre, Palma 07001\n\nHotel Hostal Cuba: Carrer de Sant Magí, 1, Ponent, Palma, 07013\n\nLa Lonja de Palma: Plaça de la Llotja, 5, Centre, Palma 07012\n\nPalma Cathedral (Catedral–Basílica de Santa María de Mallorca): Plaça de la Seu, s/n, Centre, Palma 07001\n\nRoyal Palace La Almudaina: Carrer del Palau Reial, s/n, Centre, Palma 07001\n\nHero Image: Playa de Formentor, Palma Mallorca (© Balate Dorin/iStock)\n\nWritten by The MICHELIN Guide"
