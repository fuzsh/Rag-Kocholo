        "text": "Humza Yousaf has said that he and his family may have to leave the UK because of far-Right riots.\n\nThe former Scottish first minister, the first Muslim leader of a Western democracy, said he had become so fearful at rising Islamophobia that he had considered leaving the UK.\n\nWhile Scotland is yet to be hit by the riots that have spread across England and Northern Ireland, Mr Yousaf described the targeting of minority groups as “horrendous” and said he and other minorities felt their “sense of belonging is questioned”.\n\nSpeaking to the News Agents podcast, he added: “I am about as Scottish as they come. Born in Scotland, raised in Scotland, educated in Scotland, just welcomed my third child here in Scotland. I was the leader of the Scottish Government for just over a year. You cut me open and I’m about as Scottish as you come.\n\n“The truth of the matter is I don’t know if the future for me, my wife and my three children is going to be here in Scotland or the United Kingdom, or indeed in Europe, and the West. I have for some time worried about the rise of Islamophobia.”\n\nMr Yousaf said anti-Muslim and anti-migrant rhetoric had been “normalised” in the UK and was now “playing out in the most horrendous, violent way possible”.\n\nHe added: “That makes me question whether or not my family has an existence in the UK or not. I’m not the only one – I’ve had hundreds of messages from the Muslim community saying the exact same thing.”\n\nMr Yousaf said that when he was a child his father acquired Pakistani identity cards for the family as he claimed that they may one day have to leave Scotland. He had viewed this as “ridiculous” at the time, but was now considering the same thing.\n\n“I could give you example after example, of where the language of the far Right, driven by Islamophobia, has now become institutionalised in our politics,” said the 39-year-old.\n\nHe named Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, Lee Anderson, the Reform MP, and “a former home secretary” as three individuals who he said had stoked racism and Islamophobia in the UK with their rhetoric.\n\nThe Glasgow MSP also praised Sir Keir Starmer’s response to the riots.\n\nPolice Scotland has said it has no intelligence to suggest that the violent disorder seen in England is likely to break out in Scotland.\n\nHowever, police are aware of a series of attempts to organise Right-wing events in the country, with one “pro-UK” rally planned for Sep 7 in Glasgow being promoted by the far-Right activist Tommy Robinson.\n\nMr Yousaf’s comments were echoed by Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, who said “black, brown and minority” people did not feel safe in some parts of the country.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Mr Khan wrote: “Our communities are facing the threat of hatred – including violence – fuelled by insidious racism, prejudice, and Islamophobia. It’s the legacy of decades of dog whistles, including from some irresponsible politicians.\n\n“We all bear not just the responsibility, but also the duty to stand up to hate. To be vocal. To be allies to those who are being unjustly targeted – online and off. To our black, brown and minority communities: NEVER forget that you are loved and wanted in London.”"
