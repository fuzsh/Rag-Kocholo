        "text": "\"There's nothing more heart-warming than a kid throw its arms round you and giving you a hug, it's a lovely feeling.\"\n\nChilling words from one of Britain's most notorious serial child killers, Robert Black, who died last month.\n\nHis voice was recorded by police as they questioned him about the 1981 murder of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy.\n\nBBC NI's Spotlight programme obtained copies of the audio recordings and will broadcast them on Tuesday evening.\n\nExtracts of the Scottish-born murderer's interviews, conducted by Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) detectives, will form part of Spotlight's one-hour special report into the life of the child killer.\n\nIn one exchange, Black told the police: \"I'm not exactly proud of the way I feel towards young girls.\"\n\nHe added: \"There's a part of me that knows I'm wrong, that knows it's wrong, that I shouldn't be doing things like that, I shouldn't even be thinking things like that.\n\n\"But there's the other part that says 'you like it, go on'.\"\n\nBlack died in Northern Ireland's Maghaberry Prison last month, where he was serving a total of five life sentences.\n\nHe was an opportunistic predator who drove all around the United Kingdom in his delivery van snatching young girls off the streets, mainly in the 8-12 age group.\n\nHe then dumped the bodies of those he killed hundreds of miles away.\n\nCriss-crossing police boundaries in his delivery van helped him evade detectives for 20 years.\n\nEven though he was given life sentences for killing three girls in England and Scotland - 10-year-old Sarah Harper, five-year-old Caroline Hogg and 11-year-old Susan Maxwell - Black gave nothing away to police.\n\nBut that changed when he was questioned in 2005 by PSNI officers about the murder of County Antrim schoolgirl, Jennifer Cardy.\n\nHe began to open up when he came face to face with Det Con Pamela Simpson.\n\nShe told Spotlight: \"I think everyone was surprised at that because nobody knew before we went into the interviews whether he was even going to talk at all and for some unknown reason he felt comfortable talking to myself.\"\n\nBlack began to speak about his sexual fantasies, encouraged by Det Con Simpson in the hope he might incriminate himself.\n\nWhat became apparent was that Black's fantasies were in fact reality.\n\n\"It was clear that although the questions were about his fantasies, which he was happy to talk about, what he was actually talking about were his exact decision-making processes during actual offences,\" Dr Badcock said.\n\nBlack was questioned for three days and Det Con Simpson said it was evident during the final hours of interview that Black realised he had incriminated himself.\n\n\"The head went down, he lost eye contact with us and at the very end of the interview whenever the tapes were off, he knew at that stage that he had said too much,\" she said."
