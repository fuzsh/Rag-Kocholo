        "text": "This article examines the meanings of the crime scene in serial killings, and the tensions between the real and the imagined in the circulation of those meanings. Starting with the Whitechapel Murders of 1888 it argues that they, as well as forming an origin for the construction of the identity of ‘the serial killer’, initiate certain ideas about the relationship of subjects to spaces and the existence of the self in the modern urban landscape. It suggests that these ideas come to play an integral part in the contemporary discourse of serial killing, both in the popular imagination and in professional analysis. Examining the Whitechapel Murders, more recent cases and modern profiling techniques, it argues that popular and professional representations of crime scenes reveal more of social anxieties about the nature of the public and the private than they do about serial killers. It suggests that ‘the serial killer’ is not a coherent type, but an invention produced from the confusions...\n\nThis article seeks to develop criminological theory with the application of a literary device known as the ‘flâneur’ – an individual described as a ‘stroller’ – to serial murderer Levi Bellfield. With this application of the ‘flâneur’ to the phenomenon of serial murder, this article provides a fresh theoretical ‘lens’, and specifically sheds light on how particular serial murderers operate and evade detection in modern society. The importance of modernity to the phenomenon of serial murder is also considered utilizing Ultra-Realist theory, resulting in both a micro and macro examination into how the modern urban landscape has subsequently created an environment in which the serial killer both operates and comes to fruition. This synthesis between the application of literary devices, criminological theory and socio-cultural concepts not only raises important and previously neglected questions pertaining to serial murder, but also assists in forming the more sinister relative of the f...\n\nQuestions of perception have for a long time held a central place in French intellectual life, from investigations into perception and consciousness by Bergson and Merleau-Ponty, through a psychoanalytic focus on self-image, to more recent preoccupations with photography and the moving image.1 This interest has been echoed by several writers of literary fiction, and the relationship between visual theorists and literary writers has been a topic of critical interest. The author's argument here, though, concerns popular fiction. The author claims that the treatment of perception in the detective story is a special case in literature, that the perception of the physical world in crime fiction is qualitatively different from that usually represented in other literary forms. It is also the author's contention that crime fiction's unique approach ranks it among the influences that have informed the representation of perception in French literary fiction of the later twentieth century.\n\nThis essay reads the Fritz Lang film noir, Human Desire (1954) as an intertextual reworking of La Bete humaine (Jean Renoir, 1938), in turn an adaptation of Emile Zola\\u27s eponymous novel (1890). I argue that whereas Renoir\\u27s film worries about the impending World War II, Lang\\u27s grapples with the noir legacy of a post-war world devoid of hope. This traps Zola\\u27s novel in a middle ground: the novel is set on the brink of the French destruction in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, but is written twenty years afterward\n\nEdgar Allan Poe's oeuvre has undoubtedly been pioneering in the field of detective fiction not only for American literature but also for various literatures across the world. With his detective stories, Poe introduced the eccentric figure of Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin-synthesizing ratiocinative capabilities with imaginative faculty. This article focuses on Edgar Allan Poe's ambivalent characterization of detective Dupin in the short story \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue.\" The main point is to examine the emergence of the detective figure as a reaction to the rapidly changing world of mid-nineteenth century urban modernity. While focusing on the first detective story of its kind, this paper argues that the portrayal of Dupin's partial attachment to the past and his temporal dislocation as a displaced individual in the predominantly bourgeois society is used as a means to provide a critique of the modern world and to reveal the ambivalence of modern man confronted with conflicting forces between the past and the present. While the first half of the article focuses on the detective's alliance with both the past and the present values by examining specific illustrations of this ambivalence, the second half, borrowing from the works of Foucault, Benjamin and Moretti, discusses the theoretical ramifications of the detective's embodiment of modern surveillance culture."
