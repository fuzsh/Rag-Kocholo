        "text": "The beginning of the end\n\nTo catch a killer and take him off the street forever only took a little bit of luck. A bystander saw something he thought was strange and made a call to the Police.\n\nIn the minutes before, serial killer Robert Black had seized a little girl, pulled her into his vehicle, bound and subdued her, and had driven away. By luck, he came back the same way a short time later, by which time the Police were on the scene with the witness, and they were able to stop his vehicle.\n\nPolice officers are always grateful for a tip-off such as this. Still, the officer who pulled the traumatised, semi-conscious and terrified little girl from the back of Black’s van had a reason to be more grateful than he could probably ever express: The little girl he freed from this appalling sex criminal was none other than his own daughter.\n\nBlack would undoubtedly have gone on to further assault and murder this child before ignominiously dumping her body by the roadside, as he had done before. Instead of this, he went to custody, where the Police began the painstaking process of unravelling his back story."
