        "text": "FROM twisted killer Dennis Nilsen, notorious for stuffing body parts down drains to Ian Brady who tortured and murdered five young children, we take a look at Scotland's worst killers.\n\nTwo of them even murdered sixteen people over a period ten months and sold the corpses to an anatomist who dissected them in his lectures.\n\nDennis Nilsen\n\nDennis Nilsen was caged for life in 1983 after murdering up to 15 men when he picked them up from the streets.\n\nHe strangled or drowned them before having sex with their corpses between 1978 and 1983.\n\nNilsen, of Fraserburgh in Scotland, is Britain's second worst serial killer behind Shipman.\n\nNilsen, who was convicted of six murders and two attempted murders, was only caught when plumbers found human remains blocking the drain of his London flat.\n\nDepraved Nilsen - who would never have been released after being sentenced to a whole life term - was serving his sentence at maximum security HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire when he died on May 12, 2018.\n\nPeter Tobin\n\nPeter Tobin is a Glasgow-based serial killer currently serving life without parole after being convicted of the brutal murders of three innocent women.\n\nHe was born on August 27, 1946, and is now 75-year-old.\n\nThe monster, who had served ten years for raping two 14-year-old girls, was found guilty of killing Polish student Angelika Kluk in 2006.\n\nWhen detectives quizzed him about other killings, he snarled: \"I couldn't give a f***.\"\n\nHe beat 23-year-old Angelika with a table leg, stabbing and raping her in the horrific attack before hiding her body under the floorboards of a Glasgow church.\n\nOfficers racked up more than 1,500 hours of overtime before they caught Tobin for the 1991 murders of Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol - with the subsequent charges leading to a life sentence.\n\nRobert Black\n\nRobert Black is one of the UK's most notorious serial killers and was born in Grangemouth on 21 April, 1947.\n\nHe had a troubled childhood, moving between foster families and care homes where he was sexually abused and molested other children.\n\nHe was first charged in 1963 with lewd and libidinous behaviour after luring a seven-year-old girl to an air raid shelter, choking her until she was unconscious then masturbating over her body.\n\nHowever, Black went on to kill four children and is suspected of killing many more - but he took his secrets to the grave, dying of a heart attack in prison earlier this year as he served 12 life terms.\n\nBlack never married, and had only one known girlfriend called Pamela Hodgson.\n\nHe proposed to her but she allegedly declined and split with him because of his \"unusual sexual demands\".\n\nBlack was found dead in his cell in Maghaberry high-security prison in Co Antrim in January 2016 aged 68.\n\nIan Brady\n\nMoors Murderer Ian Brady was England's longest serving prisoner until he died at the age of 79 - he never showed any remorse for his crimes.\n\nThe monster, who had been receiving end-of-life care before his death in May 2017, was convicted of killing children in 1966 alongside his twisted girlfriend Myra Hindley.\n\nBrady was born in Glasgow in 1938 and attended Shawlands Academy - a school for above-average pupils.\n\nHis violent personality was shaped by an unstable background. His mother neglected him and he was raised by foster parents in the Gorbals - Glasgow's toughest slum.\n\nAfter a spree of petty crime as a teenager the courts sent him to Manchester to live with his mum and her new husband, Patrick Brady.\n\nIan took his stepfather's name, continued his criminal activities and developed into a teenage alcoholic.\n\nHe pursued new interests in a bid to \"better himself\" - building up a library of books on Nazi Germany, sadism and sexual perversion.\n\nBrady first met Myra Hindley when she worked as a secretary at the same company in Manchester where he was working as a stores clerk.\n\nPeter Manuel\n\nNicknamed the Beast of Birkenshaw, Peter Manuel terrorised Scotland in the late 1950s, where he murdered eight people.\n\nBorn in 1927 to Scottish parents in New York, Manuel moved to Detroit with his family before emigrating back to Britain in 1932.\n\nHe lived in Birkenshaw, North Lanarkshire, where he was bullied throughout his childhood.\n\nWhen he turned 15, the beast broke into a young woman’s house, waking her, pulling down her underwear and battering her with a hammer.\n\nHe attacked several other women before being caught and caged for nine years in Peterhead prison when he was 16.\n\nOver two years in the 1950s, he was responsible for almost a third of all killings in Scotland.\n\nIn a sensational trial at Glasgow High Court, Manuel sacked his lawyers and conducted his own defence.\n\nIn July 1958, Manuel was hanged on the gallows at Barlinnie Prison. His last words are reported to have been: “Turn up the radio and I’ll go quietly.”\n\nAngus Sinclair\n\nSinclair was convicted of four killings, including the 1977 World’s End murders, but was suspected of slaying four more women in Glasgow in the same year.\n\nHe was caged for a minimum of 37 years in 2014 for murdering teen Helen Scott and her pal Christine Eadie.\n\nSinclair carried out his first murder at the age of 16 in 1961.\n\nHe raped and strangled seven-year-old neighbour Catherine Reehill before disposing of her body - but was released in his early 20s after serving just six years.\n\nTeens Helen Scott and Christine Eadie went missing after last being seen at the World's End pub on Edinburgh's Royal Mile in October 1977.\n\nThey were found dead six miles apart in the East Lothian countryside the next day.\n\nYears later, when Sinclair was being prepared for parole, a cold case review found that his DNA had been found on slain Mary Gallagher, murdered in Glasgow in 1978.\n\nHe was given another life sentence for the killing - and police started to probe links between Sinclair and other unsolved cases.\n\nHe stood trial in 2007 for the World’s End murders, but the case collapsed due to insufficient evidence.\n\nBut following a change in Scotland’s double jeopardy law, he was prosecuted again and found guilty of the murders in 2014.\n\nHe died aged 73 died in March 2019 at top security Glenochil Prison in Clackmannanshire.\n\nBurke and Hare\n\nIn the late 1820s, William Burke and William Hare supplied anatomist Dr Robert Knox with fresh corpses for research, earning the reputation of 'body snatchers'.\n\nAt the time, there was a shortage of cadavers for anatomy classes at the University of Edinburgh, and this gave rise to an illegal new industry in the city - grave robbing.\n\nBut Burke and Hare took a different route from most body snatchers and actually murdered people before passing on their bodies to science.\n\nThey never actually plundered any graves, yet the details of their story are often mistold.\n\nBurke and Hare murdered 16 people over a 12 month period, with the last murder taking place on Halloween in 1828.\n\nBurke was hanged outside St Giles Cathedral on January 28, 1829 - although it remains unknown what became of Hare.\n\nBurke's skeleton was donated to the Anatomy Museum in the University of Edinburgh, where it hangs to this day."
