        "text": "Robert Douglass Jr. was born in Philadelphia in 1809 into an activist family that emigrated from the Caribbean island of St Christopher/St Kitts. His father, Robert Douglas Sr. was an officer of the Pennsylvania Augustine Society for the Education of People of Colour, who opposed the American Colonization Society effort, started in 1816, to repatriate free African Americans to Africa. His mother, Grace Bustill Douglass, was an abolitionist, whose influence was felt in the political and artistic work of her daughter Sarah Mapps Douglas. Robert Douglas Jr’s two siblings Sarah Mapps Douglass (older sister), and William Penn Douglas (his younger brother) were artists, and activists who also followed the family anti-slavery activism tradition.\n\nRobert Douglass (Figure 1) studied portrait painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts with Thomas Sully, the renowned painting artist of the time. Douglass was a painter, printmaker, and photographer. Though his first work was an oil painting of the Pennsylvania State seal, he rose into public prominence with his transparencies of President George Washington Crossing the Delaware. This artwork was displayed on Independence Hall to celebrate the centennial of Washington’s birth on February 22, 1832. Douglass experienced discrimination at art exhibitions in Philadelphia where racism against African Americans was commonplace and whites considered it normal. For instance, in 1834, Douglass’ oil painting Portrait of a Gentleman was included in the annual exhibition of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. However, he was prevented from getting into the Academy to view his own work because of his race.\n\nInternational Travels\n\nIn 1834, violent racial street riots started in Philadelphia by white males. African Americans were attacked, their houses looted and destroyed in actions these white males described as “hunting the nigs”. Racial tensions continued and grew worse in the following years. It is during this period of intensified racial violence that Douglass traveled abroad. From 1837-1839 he was in Haiti, where he interacted with respected politicians and artists (e.g., Joseph Balthazar Inginac and Colbert Lochard). In 1840, with recommendation letters from his former instructor at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Thomas Sully, he was admitted at the National Gallery in London, where he studied. Despite the rejection of his application for an American passport by the US Secretary of State because “the people of color were not citizens and therefore had no right to passports to foreign countries1”, the French and British allowed him to stay and travel in Europe. This created an opportunity for Douglass to learn how to produce daguerreotypes, a revolutionary process of photography introduced by Frenchman Louis Daguerre. In 1847, in a period characterized by racial violence, Douglass as many other African Americans, left Philadelphia. He traveled to Jamaica, where he likely had citizenship given his father’s Caribbean background. However, in a letter to Sidney Howard Gay dated February 29, 1848 and published in the National Anti-Slavery Standard on April 20, 1848, he wrote:\n\ngreat numbers of the lower orders running to and fro, almost all Black… who are fond of amusing themselves by the beating of drums ... singing and dancing, keeping up such a perfect discord that it was exceedingly difficult to get any sleep2.\n\nAfter a few months in Jamaica, Douglass returned to Philadelphia, the city of his birth, where he died in 1887.\n\nWork\n\nDouglass’s artistic skills were exhibited in the paintings, banners, lithographs, and daguerreotypes he created or inspired including:\n\nA banner3 designed for the Young Men's Vigilant Association of Philadelphia, displaying a Black male with one hand pointing to broken chains at his feet, and his other hand pointing to the word \"liberty” written in gold letters above his head. He added the rising sun and a sinking ship which symbolized the birth of freedom and the end of tyranny.\n\nOil painting of the Pennsylvania state seal.\n\nPainting of George Washington Crossing the Delaware4 displayed on Independence Hall in Philadelphia to celebrate the centennial of the first president's birth.\n\nPainting of William Lloyd Garrison, the white abolitionist from which he made lithographs5 for mass marketing\n\nA watercolor paint of a three-quarters view of a kneeling female slave in Mary Anne Dickerson6 scrapbook\n\nPortraits of Haitian Ladies, showing their Costume\n\nPainting Joseph Balthazar Inginac, the secretary general of Haiti.\n\nDaguerreotype portraits of popular figures such as Frank Johnson7, Abby Kelley Foster8,\n\nGrand Picture of the Haitian Independence anniversary of January 1st, 1839\n\nPainting titled “Magnanimity of a Great Artist” in 1876 included in the Pennsylvania Academy annual exhibition, which may have been the portrait of Frederick Douglass\n\nOil portrait of Henrietta Bowers Duterte9\n\nPortraits copied from paintings in the National Gallery in London10\n\nPortrait of Frederick Douglass presented at the Annual Exhibition of the Pennsylvania Academy in 1878.\n\nDouglass’ talent was undeniable as shown with the inclusion of his work in the Pennsylvania Academy annual exhibitions11, and by reports in journals. For instance, writing about Douglass’ exhibition on Haiti, a reporter of the National Anti-Slavery Standard12 journal13 wrote:\n\nThese were from the pencil of the lecturer himself, whose skill as an artist is highly creditable to his talents and perseverance under all the discouragements to which one his complexion is exposed, whenever he engages in any except what are generally considered the lower and less respectable occupations.\n\nMost of Douglass’s work did not survive. The American Antiquarian Society, in Massachusetts, has a daguerreotype of the abolitionist leader Abby Kelley Foster (Figure 2 ). The Historical Society of Pennsylvania has Douglass's lithograph of the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, (Figure 3) as well as a lithograph of the Black musician Francis Johnson (Figure 4).\n\nIn addition to his artistry, Douglass was engaged in the Anti-Slavery Society, taught drawing and painting along with his sister (Sarah) at The Institute for Colored Youth; founded the Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons in 1833 with the goal of developing knowledge of literature, science, public-speaking and debating skills among its free Black males. Douglass also wrote reviews of the Centennial for the Christian Recorder15 , the first and only Black newspaper to have a continuous circulation for one hundred years, defending American Art.\n\nDouglass was the first African American artist whose work was included in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts Annual exhibition in 1834, but could not live off his work, and struggled financially. Yet, he inspired artists such as David Bustill Bowser, his nephew, and one of Philadelphia’s most commercially successful African American artists of the 19th century, and paved the way for others centuries after.\n\nRead more in this series, Blacks Reshaping Narratives About Black People in 19th Century America:\n\nFlora Stewart: African American Woman, Oldest Citizen of Londonberry, N.H\n\nConsidering Flora Stewart’s Portrait as an Autobiography of an African American Woman\n\nFootnotes\n\n* Cartes de Visite Collection (US), 19th Century Collection, Photographs and Prints Division, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations.\n\n1 Pryor, E.
