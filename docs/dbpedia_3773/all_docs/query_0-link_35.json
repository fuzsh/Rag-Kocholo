        "text": "The monster – who murdered four schoolgirls and was suspected in 12 other unsolved cases across the UK – is understood to have fallen ill several days ago in Maghaberry Jail in Lisburn, Co Antrim.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Prison Service confirmed a prisoner had passed away and that it was Black, 68, who knew he would die behind bars.\n\nFollowing his last conviction Black, who was serving 13 life sentences, had been condemned to “spend eternity in hell with Satan” by the parents of victim Jennifer Cardy.\n\nRelatives spoke out in December 2011 after Black, born in Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, was found guilty of abducting Jennifer, nine, as she cycled to a friend’s house in Ballinderry, Co Antrim, in August 1981.\n\nHer body was found dumped in a local dam six days later after people from both sides of the Troubles joined forces to search for her.\n\nBlack, who was flown to the trial in Armagh from Wakefield Prison in Yorkshire in a private jet, had already been found guilty at Newcastle Crown Court in 1994 of three other child murders.\n\nHe was jailed for life for murdering farmer’s daughter Susan Maxwell, 11, in Coldstream in the Borders in 1982, Caroline Hogg, five, in Portobello, near Edinburgh, the following year, and Sarah Harper, 10, who was abducted near her home in Morley, Leeds, in 1986 as she went to the shops for a loaf of bread.\n\nThe billboard poster delivery-driver had spent decades driving around the UK in a Ford Transit van abducting and abusing youngsters. One Nottingham schoolgirl narrowly escaped his clutches by fighting him off.\n\nBlack was brought to justice after he was convicted of abducting and sexually assaulting the daughter of a Scottish police officer in tiny Stow in the Borders in 1990.\n\nA neighbour raised the alarm after seeing the little girl being snatched and Black was caught by the her father who bravely halted the fiend’s Ford Transit and found his semi-conscious daughter bound, gagged and trussed up in a sleeping bag.\n\nAs he was being driven away, the cruel killer calmly told police: “What a day it’s been!”\n\nBlack committed his first sex offence as a 12-year-old and later used his job working for a London-based company to trawl the country in search of victims.\n\nHe is believed to have asked for a transfer to Maghaberry Prison where he bizarrely refused to turn his cell light off at night for fear of “recurring nightmares” and only slept during the daytime.\n\nAt the time of his death, Black was suspected of killing up to a dozen girls around the UK, and was labelled the country’s most prolific child killer by criminologists."
