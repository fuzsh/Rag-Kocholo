        "text": "Kyiv's forces conducted an operation in Ukraine's partially occupied Kherson region on Tuesday as part of a daring overnight raid authorities said.\n\nUkrainian Defense Intelligence (DIU) said on Wednesday that a raid on Tendrivska Kosa, or Tendra Spit—a thin strip of land in the Black Sea which extends from the Kherson region—was carried out by special forces.\n\n\"Scouts destroyed equipment, personnel and fortifications of the occupiers,\" the DIU said on Telegram.\n\nNewsweek couldn't independently verify the claims and has contacted Russia's Defense Ministry for comment by email.\n\nThe Context\n\nUkraine liberated the city of Kherson and the west bank of the Dnieper River toward the end of 2022. Since then, Ukrainian forces have launched regular raids across the river.\n\nWhat We Know\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, a former adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, described Tendrivska Kosa on X (formerly Twitter) as \"a narrow island about 65 km long and up to 1.8 km wide,\" although it is in fact a spit of land, not an island.\n\n\"It is located in the northern part of the Black Sea, near the Ukrainian Crimea,\" he wrote.\n\n\"At night, a landing group of the Special Operations Forces landed on the Tendra Spit and destroyed enemy armored vehicles, including MT-LBs, an enemy electronic warfare system and Russian fortifications,\" Ukraine's Defense Intelligence said. \"During the battle, the Russian invaders suffered losses among their personnel, but the exact number is being determined.\"\n\nThe DIU said Ukrainian forces left \"without loss\" after they \"completed the assigned task.\"\n\nThe operation is \"part of a large-scale plan of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine, the implementation of which is ongoing,\" it said.\n\nUkraine released a video of the naval raid, which shows strikes on Russian equipment.\n\nRussia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said in April that it had foiled a previous attempt by Ukrainian forces to attack Tendrivska Kosa.\n\n\"The FSB together with the Defense Ministry foiled a landing of Ukrainian sabotage groups on the Tendra Spit of the Kherson Region, planned by British special services,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"In the clash, the Ukrainian landing force was destroyed, and a citizen of Ukraine, a senior soldier of the 73rd Marine Center of the Ukrainian Army's special operations forces, Yevgeny Gorin, born on April 18, 1985, was taken prisoner,\" the FSB said."
