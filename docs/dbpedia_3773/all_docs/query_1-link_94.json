        "text": "Daley has been married to his husband Dustin Lance Black – who’s 20 years older than him – since 2012, and they share two children together.\n\nHere’s what we know about the British athlete’s supportive husband:\n\nDustin Lance Black is an American screenwriter and director\n\nBlack, 50, is a critically acclaimed writer and producer. The Californian-born talent is best known for his work on films including Milk starring Sean Penn, Under the Banner of Heaven, and J. Edgar. Per his IMDb page, he has been nominated for 21 awards and has won 15 times, including an Oscar for Milk.\n\nHe is an LGBT rights activist\n\nBlack and Daley ditched the UK for the US\n\nAccording to the official Olympics website, Daley and Black currently live in Los Angeles. They reportedly moved out of the UK because Black believed that the British government “owed him an apology”. The writer was wrongly accused of assaulting BBC presenter Teddy Edwardes at a London nightclub, per The Guardian, but the case was dismissed in 2023. He told the newspaper he couldn’t understand how the case ever made it to court.\n\nDaley later wrote on Instagram: “To be violently attacked, then blamed, dragged through a court process, having evidence lost, stories changed all for a judge to see the lies for exactly what they were and dismiss the case immediately, has been hugely draining for us as a family.”\n\nHow many children do Tom Daley and Dustin Lance Black have?\n\nDaley and Black are proud fathers to two children who were both born by surrogate. Per People, they have two sons – six-year-old Robert “Robbie” Ray and Phoenix Rose, who was born last March.\n\nAccording to the same outlet, the couple began dating in 2013, after meeting at a dinner party, and tied the knot in May 2017."
