        "text": "From the stand-up stages of Canada to the breakout sketch-comedy hit \"In Living Color\" (Fox, 1990-96), award-winning actor Jim Carrey became of Hollywood's most bankable comedic stars during the 1990s, thanks to a string of zany blockbusters that began with \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" (1994). His Golden Globe-winning performance in the eerily promontory \"The Truman Show\" (1998) proved that there was also significant depth and substance beneath his hyperkinetic antics, after which point, Carrey divided his efforts between broad comedies such as \"Me, Myself and Irene\" (2000) and more esoteric indie dramas such as Milos Forman's \"Man on the Moon\" (1999) and Michel Gondry's \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004). Carrey's unique sensibility and characterizations also proved a perfect match for big-screen adaptations of Dr. Seuss' fanciful classics, \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" (2000) and \"Horton Hears a Who!\" (2008), and he stayed atop the heap with comedies like \"Bruce Almighty\" (2003). Though his box-office clout diminished as he turned to uncharacteristic movies such as \"The Number 23\" (2007) and \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" (2009) - as evidenced by the muted response to \"Mr. Popper's Penguins\" (2011) and \"Dumb & Dumber To\" (2014) - Carrey nonetheless remained one of Hollywood's biggest and more beloved stars."
