        "text": "When Lauren Holly met investment banker Francis Greco in 2000 on a blind date, it wasn't exactly love at first sight. At the time, the actress, who had risen to fame thanks to roles on both the big and little screens (Dumb & Dumber, Sabrina, CBS's Picket Fences), had two marriages behind her--the first to actor Danny Quinn; the second a high-profile, though brief, marriage to actor Jim Carrey. Lauren lets out a throaty laugh as she recalls how a friend actually had to persuade Francis to meet her. \"I was a few years older, I had been married twice before, I was an actress, a type A personality--and I think it all sounded too highmaintenance for a nice Catholic boy from a huge Italian family.\" But surprisingly for both of them, they clicked--and today, seven years later, Lauren, 43, and Francis, 38, are the happily married parents of three adopted sons: Alexander, 5, George, 4, and 3-year-old Henry. Here, the NCIS star shares her very personal story of finding unexpected love the third time around, and how the fateful adoptions of her young sons transformed her.\n\nHow was your husband different from guys in past relationships?\n\nI never really had an a--hole guy in my life. In fact, they were the most amazing men on the planet. It was just that their personalities were as big as mine, if not bigger. So to meet somebody who was so stable and down-to-earth was very new. Even the idea of dating was new. In my 20s and 30s, people didn't date. You went out in large groups and eventually you went home together. But with Francis, there were actual dates where he would plan things and call to tell me what time he was picking me up. He wanted me to meet his family. It was so different and it took a little time to understand it.\n\nHow did Francis feel about your learning curve?\n\nAfter dating for a few weeks, he sat me down one day and said, \"Look, I'm not like you Hollywood types. I'm ready for a commitment and a family, and if you're not, tell me and we can forget about this. But if you're more than just interested, we should see where this goes.\" And we did, and 11 months later he proposed.\n\nOnce you got engaged, you stepped out of the acting world for a while. What prompted that decision?\n\nI realized this whole other world was out there and open to me. I had been very fortunate in my career up until that point, but for the first time I thought, I just want to settle down, be with the man that I love, and start a family. So I kind of dropped out of the business and moved to New York with Francis and we got an apartment together.\n\nStarting your family came pretty soon after that, right?\n\nYeah, it was actually kind of a fluke. I always knew I was going to adopt. I remember being very young and watching an after-school special about adoption, and after that it was just always part of my plan. And I thought I'd have my own children as well. When I told Francis about it, it was so weird because he said that he had always thought about adopting--which surprised me since he's from a very traditional Italian family. We started the adoption process a couple of months before our wedding because we figured it would take at least two years.\n\nWhat was the adoption process like for you?\n\nWe started working with a lawyer and a social worker. And by chance several months later, a couple walked into a hospital--a Sicilian guy and a redhaired, green-eyed Irish girl--and they gave birth and left. My social worker was on call, and she called me and said, \"A baby was just born, and I think he belongs to you.\" Within the week, my husband said to me, \"We have to do this again.\" Baby George came along 15 months later. Then, believe it or not, George's birth parents got pregnant again and 15 months later Henry came to us. They're like Irish triplets, basically.\n\nDo they all know they're adopted?\n\nOh, yes. I've been talking to all three of them about it since the day they were born. We celebrate each boy's adoption day just like a birthday. I never wanted it to be a shock and I never wanted them to hear it from someone else. We just had our first situation at school where someone said something that hurt my son's feelings. He said that one of the kids told him that I had stolen him.\n\nHave the boys changed you?\n\nI look back now and say, \"Thank God I didn't have my children until I was a little bit older.\" I have friends who tell me, \"I'm not ready yet\" or \"We haven't saved enough money yet to have kids.\" But it's not really about any of that. It's about: You'll be a good parent when you're ready to no longer be selfish. Until I was about 35, it was all about me. I look back and I'm astonished at how I lived my life--it was totally self-involved.\n\nDid you ever miss Hollywood during your break?\n\nAt first I didn't miss my other life at all. But after George came, I got the itch to work again. We were living in Chicago then because Francis had moved his business there. It was ultimately Francis who said, \"You want to go back to work. Go for it.\" Then NCIS came along.\n\nIt's great that Francis supported your wish to get back to work.\n\nI had done some producing during my time off, but everything I did, I did from our house. Francis could see how alive I became when I was involved in a project. So when NCIS came up, I started flying back and forth between Los Angeles and Chicago. I'd be gone for two to three days, then fly home. It was crazy, but it worked. In the spring of 2006, the show got picked up for a fourth season, and Francis said he'd be the one to fly back and forth, since he flies so much for business anyway, and we moved to California. Francis is usually gone Monday through Wednesday, and the kids spend a lot of time with me on the set. I've set up a little parking lot for them there where they ride bikes, run around, and play with their scooters and skateboards. I do have a full-time nanny who helps me during the week, but on the weekends I want to do it all myself.\n\nHow do you and Francis find alone time these days?\n\nPeople are always saying to us, \"You need to go away together,\" but the fact is we haven't wanted to be away from the boys--that didn't feel like fun to us. But we did just start two things that are really great. On Sunday afternoons, we have what we call \"private time.\" Francis and I might play a game, or just take a walk. The other thing is that Francis recently gave me a spa certificate to the new Four Seasons Hotel, which is about 10 minutes from where we live. He worked it out so we could stay overnight, and we had the nanny watch the kids for us. That was the first time in six years we had been away together alone. Of course, the first thing I said to Francis was, \"We should bring the kids here,\" but once we settled in, we had the best time, and now we've decided to do a mini-vacation like that once a month."
