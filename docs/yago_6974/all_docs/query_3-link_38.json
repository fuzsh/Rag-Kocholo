        "text": "Jim Carrey has released a statement after being accused of supplying his depression-prone girlfriend with prescription drugs purchased under a false name in an explosive new wrongful death lawsuit filed by the woman’s estranged husband.\n\nIrish makeup artist Cathriona White's estranged husband Mark Burton has filed papers in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles alleging Carrey obtained Ambien, Popranolol and Percocet under the fake name “Arthur King”.\n\n“This is a case about Jim Carrey using his immense wealth and celebrity status to illegally obtain and distribute highly addictive and, in this case, deadly, controlled substances,” the suit reads. \"On information and belief, after White committed suicide, and in an effort to cover-up his conduct and complicity in her death, CARREY sent a bogus text message on September 27, 2015 to White (who was already deceased) pretending as though he had misplaced the drugs and insinuating the White may have taken them from CARREY.\"\n\nCathriona White. Source: Instagram\n\nLater on Tuesday, Carrey released a statement to People on the lawsuit.\n\n\"What a terrible shame,\" Carrey began.\n\n\"It would be easy for me to get in a back room with this man's lawyer and make this go away, but there are some moments in life when you have to stand up and defend your honor against the evil in this world.\"\n\n\"I will not tolerate this heartless attempt to exploit me or the woman I loved,\" he continued. \"Cat's troubles were born long before I met her and sadly her tragic end was beyond anyone's control.\"\n\n\"I really hope that some day soon people will stop trying to profit from this and let her rest in peace.\"\n\nBurton was still legally married to White while she was dating the movie star and at the time of her September 25, 2015 death.\n\nBurton’s attorney, Michael Avenatti, told the New York Post his client had \"been investigating facts related to Mr. Carrey’s involvement [in White’s death] for a long time\".\n\nWhite was found dead in her home in September last year alongside bottle of pills prescribed to \"Arthur King\". She had broken up with Carrey only days before she took her own life and wrote about the break-up in a suicide note signed \"Dewdrop\".\n\n\"I've spent 3 days now in disbelief that you're not here. I can go on brokenhearted and try to put the pieces back. I could, I just don't have the will this time,\" the note read. \"I'm sorry you felt I wasn't there for you. I tried to give you my best part.\"\n\n\"Please forgive me. I'm just not for this world.\"\n\nThe suit alleges Carrey attempted to control and manipulate White and would monitor her using surveillance cameras installed in her home.\n\nThe claim also alleges Carrey publicly promised to pay for White’s funeral in her native Ireland but later reneged.\n\n“Not surprisingly, he never informed the media of his broken promise and decision to stiff the family,” the suit says. “Instead, he allowed the perpetuation of the ‘grieving, good guy’ image he and his handlers had crafted for the media,” the suit says.\n\nJim was a pallbearer at her funeral. Source: Getty Images.\n\nCarrey was a pallbearer at White's funeral.\n\nBurton is asking Carrey to pay for all burial expenses, his lawyer's fees, the costs of the suit and punitive damages. He has requested a jury trial and is being represented by Michael Avenatti."
