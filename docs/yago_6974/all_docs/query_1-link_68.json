        "text": "On Feb. 9, 1996, the dramedy Beautiful Girls first opened in theaters. The film centers around Willie (Timothy Hutton), who returns home for his high school reunion in a small Massachusetts town. It's funny and heartwarming and features one of the better ensemble casts of the 1990s. Head back down memory lane and see what the actors have been up since the film's release.\n\nTimothy Hutton as Willie Conway\n\nYears before his character, Willie, revisited his old stomping grounds in the fictional town of Knight's Ridge, Hutton won Best Supporting Actor in 1981 for his performance in Ordinary People. At only 20 years old, he became (and has remained) the youngest male actor to win an Oscar. It's no surprise the star continued to prove his dramatic chops in the decades since playing everyone's favorite sideburn-sporting jazz pianist.\n\nHutton has been featured in films like The General's Daughter (1999), Kinsey (2004), The Good Shepherd (2006), Serious Moonlight (2009), Beautiful Boy (2018) and The Glorias (2020) with Julianne Moore and Alicia Vikander.\n\nNo stranger to the small screen, the actor led A&E's detective series, A Nero Wolfe Mystery, directed several episodes and served as an executive producer. He then starred on Leverage and American Crime opposite Felicity Huffman, which earned him an Emmy nomination in 2015. Other notable TV credits include Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, The Haunting of Hill House, How to Get Away With Murder, Almost Family and Women of the Movement.\n\nIn 2020, he was accused of sexually assaulting then-14-year-old model Sera Johnston in a hotel room in 1983. Hutton denied the allegations; In 2021, he was officially cleared of all charges by the British Columbia Crown Counsel and the Vancouver Police Department.\n\nHutton and his now-estranged wife, Aurore Giscard d'Estaing – an illustrator and the niece of former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing – tied the knot in 2000. Their son Milo was born the following year. He also shares a son, Noah, with ex-wife and actress Debra Winger, whom he was married to from 1986 to 1990.\n\nMatt Dillon as Tommy \"Birdman\" Rowland\n\nAfter playing Tommy \"Birdman\" Rowland — the former jock who never met his full potential — Matt Dillon was featured in a string of '90s hits: In & Out (1997), There's Something About Mary (1998) and Wild Things (1998).\n\nHe continued acting throughout the 2000s, starring in Crash (2004), Factotum (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Nothing but the Truth (2008), Takers (2010), Girl Most Likely (2012), Bad Country (2014) and Asteroid City (2023).\n\nIn 2018, he led the cast of The House That Jack Built alongside his Beautiful Girls costar, Uma Thurman, and the gruesome flick made headlines when it prompted over 100 walkouts at Cannes. For his role as bigoted police officer John Ryan in Crash, Dillon received an Oscar nomination in 2006 for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe actor also tried his hand at TV, starring on the Fox series Wayward Pines in 2015. He will appear opposite Patricia Arquette on the Apple TV+ show High Desert, premiering on May 17, 2023.\n\nDillon is in a relationship with longtime girlfriend and Italian actress Roberta Mastromichele.\n\nNatalie Portman as Marty\n\nNatalie Portman was only 15 when she played the girl next door who nurses a crush on Willie. Since then, Portman has starred in the Star Wars prequels, Garden State (2004), Closer (2004), V for Vendetta (2005), The Other Boleyn Girl (2008), Brothers (2009) and Black Swan (2010), which earned her an Oscar for Best Actress.\n\nPortman was also featured in No Strings Attached (2011), Jackie (2016), Annihilation (2018) and Lucy in The Sky (2019). Her performance as Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2016 biopic earned Portman her third Oscar nomination. She joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe, portraying superhero Jane Foster in three Thor installments, including The Dark World (2013) and Love and Thunder (2022).\n\nThe actress is an animal rights advocate and has a long history of supporting anti-poverty organizations like FINCA International. She contributed $50,000 to the Time's Up initiative in 2018. As captured in a video by CNN, Portman opened up about the sexual trauma she experienced as a 13-year-old on the set of her first film, Léon: The Professional (1994).\n\nPortman has been married to Benjamin Millepied since August 2012; the two first met on the set of Black Swan in 2009 and started dating. Portman and Millepied share two children: son Aleph and daughter Amalia.\n\nLauren Holly as Darian Smalls\n\nLauren Holly's role as Darian Smalls saw her as Tommy's former high school sweetheart, who needed to remind Kev that it was, in fact, five o'clock in the morning. The actress was later featured in Any Given Sunday (1999), What Women Want (2000), Field of Lost Shoes (2015), The Blackcoat's Daughter (2015) and several TV and holiday movies.\n\nHolly never strayed far from the crime scene or courtroom on the small screen. She starred on NCIS as Director Jenny Shepard and played the lead medical examiner on the Canadian procedural Motive. Since then, she's appeared on other series such as Designated Survivor, Tiny Pretty Things, The Lake and Family Law.\n\nHolly shares three sons — Alexander, George and Henry — with ex-husband Francis Greco. She was previously married to actor and comedian Jim Carrey from 1996 to 1997.\n\nRosie O'Donnell as Gina Barrisano\n\nThough Rosie O'Donnell would continue to star in films after Beautiful Girls — including Harriet the Spy (1996) and Tarzan (1999) — she focused her career on daytime and primetime TV.\n\nShe began her new chapter in 1996 with The Rosie O'Donnell Show, which won 11 Daytime Emmys for outstanding talk show. The comedian followed six seasons of The Rosie O'Donnell Show with a stint on The View in 2006 (where she famously feuded with Donald Trump), the short-lived Rosie Radio on SiriusXM and OWN's The Rosie Show.\n\nO'Donnell was later cast as Rita Hendricks on ABC Family's The Fosters, made a cameo in Pitch Perfect 2 (2015) and popped up on an episode of Empire. She even appeared on two episodes of the CBS sitcom Mom as Allison Janney's character's ex-girlfriend.\n\nThe actress garnered critical acclaim for her role as Tutu on Showtime's SMILF and appeared on American Gigolo as Detective Joan Sunday and The L Word: Generation Q. In 2022, she joined the cast of Prime Video's A League of Their Own reboot as Vi, the owner of an underground gay bar. O'Donnell also voiced the subway announcer throughout season 2 of Russian Doll.\n\nShe is an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ and adoption rights, and in 2003, she co-created Rosie's Theater Kids, a charity that aims to provide free music and dance education to New York City public school students.\n\nO'Donnell has five children: Parker, Chelsea, Blake, Vivienne and Dakota. She was married to Nickelodeon executive Kelli Carpenter until 2004 and wed her second wife, Michelle Rounds, in 2012. The two finalized their divorce in March 2016 before Rounds died of apparent suicide in 2017.\n\nMira Sorvino as Sharon Cassidy\n\nNaturally, Hutton and Portman aren't the only ones in the cast with an Oscar. Mira Sorvino, who played Tommy's girlfriend, Sharon, won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1996 for her role in Woody Allen's Mighty Aphrodite, the same year Beautiful Girls was released.\n\nSorvino went on to star opposite Lisa Kudrow in the '90s cult classic Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997), followed by the 1999 flicks At First Sight and Spike Lee's Summer of Sam. Sorvino also had supporting roles in Reservation Road (2007), Space Warriors (2013), Stuber (2019) and Sound of Freedom (2022).\n\nOver the years, Sorvino has appeared on TV favorites like Intruders, StartUp, Modern Family, Hollywood, The Expecting, Impeachment: American Crime Story and Shining Vale. She earned an Emmy nomination in 1996 for her performance as Marilyn Monroe in the biopic Norma Jean & Marilyn.\n\nOff-screen, Sorvino is an anti-human trafficking activist and, in 2009, was appointed United Nations Goodwill ambassador. The actress has been involved with Amnesty International since 2004.\n\nSorvino has been married to actor Christopher Backus since 2004. Together, they share four children — Mattea, Johnny, Holden and Lucia. Sorvino is the daughter of late Goodfellas and Law & Order star Paul Sorvino, who died on July 25, 2022, at 83.\n\nUma Thurman as Andera\n\nBeautiful Girls was Thurman's third feature film after starring in 1994's Pulp Fiction — for which she was nominated Best Supporting Actress — and 1995's A Month By the Lake. In the following years, she was cast in The Truth About Cats and Dogs (1996), Batman & Robin (1997) and Gattaca (1997), where she met actor Ethan Hawke, whom she married in 1998 before filing for divorce in 2004.

In the years after Beautiful Girls, the actress appeared in flicks like Pecker (1998), 200 Cigarettes (1999), Company (2011) and Mass (2021).\n\nPlimpton is known for her starring role on Fox's Raising Hope, which earned her an Emmy nomination in 2011 for outstanding lead actress.
