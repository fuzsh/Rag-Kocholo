        "text": "Cathriona White's marriage certificate has been revealed following her death.\n\nThe on-off girlfriend of Jim Carrey tied the knot to estranged husband Mark Burton in 2013 during a ceremony in Las Vegas.\n\nAccording to the document, the pair were married at the Heavenly Bliss Wedding Chapel on 15th January two years ago.\n\nTragically, the 30-year-old make-up artist was found dead of an apparent suicide at her rented home in Sherman Oaks, California, on September 28.\n\nA week after her death the Los Angeles County Medical Examinerâ€™s office has confirmed that her body will be released to her husband .\n\nAn official told The Hollywood Reporter: \"She had a husband, we have a husband as next of kin. We're not releasing any more information on next of kin, but we do have her as married.\"\n\nA source close to Jim, 53, confirmed that Cathriona was married but separated and said that she was planning to file for divorce in December.\n\nThe insider explained: \"There is no way that Jim would have taken her out to public places if he thought she was married. As far as Jim was concerned, Cat was separated from her husband and was going to start divorce proceedings in December.\n\n\"When people are separated they date or do whatever they need to do.\"\n\nCathriona's body is expected to be repatriated to her native Ireland.\n\nThe LA County Coroner's office also revealed that Cathriona left several suicide notes and four different kinds of medication, including Ambien, Percocet, Zofran and Propranolol, were found at the\n\nscene.\n\nWhile some of the medication allegedly belonged to Jim, who is reportedly set to fly to Ireland for her funeral, an insider claimed Cathriona took the pills from his home without his knowledge.\n\nThe source said: \"They were his medications but unbeknownst to him she took the pills. He had no idea. He didn't even know they were gone for a few days.\"\n\nMirror Celebs has contacted a rep for Jim Carrey for comment"
