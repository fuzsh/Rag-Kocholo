        "text": "Comedic genius Jim Carrey and his ex-wife Melissa vowed to never fall into \"the pitfalls of Hollywood marriages,\" per The Spokesman-Review, but their marriage ended up in a nasty public divorce. According to Melissa, their split had a lot to do with Jim's \"Dumb and Dumber\" co-star Lauren Holly.\n\nBy the time Jim Carrey's divorce from Melissa was finalized, he was already in a relationship with Holly. Melissa accused Holly of being the third party in her and Jim's relationship, telling The Spokesman-Review that she believed Holly \"may have been involved a lot sooner than they are letting on.\"\n\nHolly denied Melissa's accusations, telling Rolling Stone, \"They kept calling me a homewrecker. I feel for Melissa, but they were completely apart when Jim and I met.\" Even so, Carrey and Holly's marriage lasted only a year, and while Holly has spoken about her heartbreak, she has no hard feelings and thinks Carrey is a \"genius.\""
