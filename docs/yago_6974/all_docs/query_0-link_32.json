        "text": "The Juror #6 Job\n\nWhen Parker attends jury duty in order to keep up the legitimacy of one of her aliases, she notices some strange things at the trial. It seems someone is trying to buy a favorable verdict... but not if the Leverage team can steal it first!\n\nAcceptable Risk\n\nIn the wake of a museum gala shooting spree, the SRU's actions and judgments are called into question; however, the investigator seems to be focusing on Sgt. Parker in particular.\n\nMidnight Lamp\n\nFaced with the possibility of war, the Ash (Vincent Walsh) sends Bo (Anna Silk) to capture a Fae action film star (guest star Lauren Holly) who could help the Light Fae. But when the plan goes awry and traps them inside a Âmagic lamp,Â Bo's only ally may be a handsome Dark Fae (guest star Anthony Lemke)."
