        "text": "JIM Carrey has gone red-carpet-official with new girlfriend Ginger Gonzaga, with the pair stepping out together at the Golden Globes Awards earlier this evening.\n\nJim, 56, and 34-year-old Ginger looked loved-up as they attended the swanky ceremony at The Beverly Hilton Hotel.\n\nThe pair star in comedy series Kidding together, with Jim nominated for a Golden Globe in this year's Best Performance By An Actor In A Television Series: Musical or Comedy category.\n\nThe sitcom is also nominated for the Best Television Series: Musical or Comedy gong.\n\nA representative for Jim confirmed that he is dating Ginger, with the pair laughing and smiling as they posed arm-in-arm in front of the cameras today.\n\nGinger had her short, black hair slicked back and looked sensational in a figure-hugging, asymmetric, black dress.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim looked smart in a navy suit, that he completed with a black shirt and bow tie.\n\nJim married actress Melissa Womer in 1987, with the pair welcoming daughter Jane, now 31, before their 1995 split.\n\nHe previously dated Bridget Jones' actress Renée Zellweger, Jenny McCarthy, and Cathriona White - who tragically passed away in 2015.\n\nGinger is Jim's first public romance since Cathriona's shock death.\n\nPaying his respects to his former love at the time, the actor said: \"I am shocked and deeply saddened by the passing of my sweet Cathriona.\n\n\"She was a truly kind and delicate Irish flower, too sensitive for this soil, to whom loving and being loved was all that sparkled.\n\n\"My heart goes out to her family and friends and to everyone who loved and cared about her. We have all been hit with a lightning bolt.\"\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220."
