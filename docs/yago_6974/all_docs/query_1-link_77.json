        "text": "Claudia (Lauren Holly) is living in the small town she grew up. Working as a diner waitress, her time is divided between her depressed mother (Blythe Danner) and her sister (Connie Britton), her live-in boyfriend Michael (Jon Bon Jovi) and with her friends – who are also Michael’s allies and they pretty much end up doing the same things every night.\n\nClaudia is fed up with her life, but that babe doesn’t feel like there’s much that babe can do, until her ex/the-love-of-her-life Charlie (Edward Burns) comes back to town. Charlie has not ever been content with the domestic town life and this chab makes sure he reminds Claudia that neither has she.\n\nSure, Charlie appears to be like an exciting change but can Claudia ever trust her anew? And what about Michael?\n\n**\n\nDon’t accuse me of being a hypocrite for watching this just yet. So, I told I wasn’t really dying to see Natalie Portman’s Love and Other Impossible Pursuits cuz it had such an unoriginal storyline. Yet here I am reviewing a film that, on the surface, offers no thing but a love triangle and tiny city depression. But then once more, No Looking Back has 2 fine things to offer: Jon Bon Jovi and Edward Burns. And I not at any time had anything against Gwyneth Paltrow’s real life mother Blythe Danner, Spin City’s Nikki Connie Britton or Jennifer Esposito, who deliver nicely on the sidelines. But this clip, for me, was about Jon and Edward.\n\nYeah, Lauren Holly is a valuable actress. But what makes No Looking Back worth a try to find me is that it is mainly a one-man effort, just like many Edward Burns videos. It was written and directed by Burns, he has the lead role and that stud has co-produced it. That fellow doesn’t always come up with the most worthwhile storylines, but he’s admirable at creating ordinary yet life-like characters and this chap has always been one of my idols. Come on- how many movie scene buffs fantasized about shooting their own story, with their favourite actors? I am guessing and the difference is Burns has managed it. Remember his first The Brothers McMullen? Shot with $25,000 and making 10 million – all that with an unknown cast? Yes, that was Burns. As I said, No Looking Back is nothing special storywise, but it’s a wonderful, modest little effort.\n\nAnd Jon Bon Jovi. Yep, I’m a Bon Jovi fan and yeah, that automatically makes me a fan of Jon’s singing, (most) song-writing and stage presence. But believe it or not, the fellow can action. This chab 1st got the acting bug when that stud discharged a scene for buddy Emilio Estevez’ Juvenile Guns II, where Jon was doing the soundtrack. The clip did well and the soundtrack did even better, scoring Jon a Golden Globe for Best Song, as well as an Oscar nomination.\n\nWhen Jon gave acting a serious discharged in the mid-90s and during the time that he wasn’t a box office star, he was critically liked and that was what he wanted. No Looking Back is a great film for Jon to shine coz the heart of the clip lies in the triangle and he is taste in the middle of it.\n\nJon is a worthy example for getting what you wish the old-fashioned way. This dude worked really hard to become a rock star and he did. That guy could have bought his way into a studio, but that stud did auditions and took acting lessons.\n\nSo yes, the episode is greater quantity for Burns and Jon Bon Jovi fans as well as aspiring (indie) filmmakers.\n\nIt’s likewise for getting nostalgic. 1998. Do you remember where u were? For me, it was the start of 9th grade. But worry not- the themes in the movie won’t acquire obsolete. Clichéd and over-used? Sure. Obsolete? No. After all, depression, identity crisis, settling down, settling vs. chasing your dreams…they have been the core themes for a long whilst.\n\nRated 5.8 on IMDB. Sounds fair sufficiently. No Looking Back is not recommended if you’re after escapism or original screenplay. It’s recommended for those who are after the familiar themes, a enjoyable soundtrack (Sheryl Crow, Bruce Springsteen, Lynyrd Skynyrd,Pete Yorn, The Allman Brothers Band and greater quantity) and well, for these who are wondering whether Jon Bon Jovi can act.\n\nOh, I too like the ending. This part has a spoiler: the movie scene picks a neither- nor approach rather than either or;)\n\nJoy Stuff:\n\nThe singer almost any heard in the background is the rock legend Bruce Springsteen and this dude is the much loved musician of Jon Bon Jovi. They are one as well as the other from New Jersey and they performed on stage jointly.\n\nJennifer Espesito was married to Bradley Cooper.\n\nOn Lauren Holly\n\nSabrina starring Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond & Greg Kinnear.
