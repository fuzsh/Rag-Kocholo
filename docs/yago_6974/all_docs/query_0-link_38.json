        "text": "Born in Bristol, Pennsylvania, the daughter of two college professors, Lauren Michael Holly grew up in the upstate New York town of Geneva. Her childhood was split between experiences that contrasted. She was privy to the shelter of growing up in a rural town and also exposed due to the erudite sophistication of her parents' academic careers. She spent time traveling in Europe and lived for a year in London, where she studied languages and flute at the famed Sarah Siddons School. A graduate of Sarah Lawrence College in Westchester County, New York, Holly credits her love of acting to her great-grandmother who bred a family tradition of \"treading the boards\" on the musical theatre stages of Liverpool and London.\n\nHolly's breakthrough motion picture performance came in the New Line Cinema's box-office smash, Dumm und Dümmer (1994), with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Lauren captured the hearts of audiences, as \"Mary Swanson\", the woman who drove Jim Carrey to follow her across the country to pledge his love. Next, she received glowing reviews for her performance in the Edward Burns drama, Auch mehr ist nie genug (1998), as a woman whose life in a small seaside community is turned upside down by the reappearance of her ex-boyfriend. Other film credits include Oliver Stone's \"Any Given Sunday\", Sydney Pollack's \"Sabrina\", the action-drama \"Turbulence\", the Miramax ensemble \"Beautiful Girls\", \"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story\", \"A Smile Like Yours\", \"The Adventures of Ford Fairlane\", \"Down Periscope\", \"Entropy\" and \"The Last Producer\". On television, Holly recently starred in two films for Hallmark. She also boasts three seasons as Director Jenny Shepard in NCIS, opposite Mark Harmon. Holly was seen in the TNT movie \"King of Texas\", an adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", playing opposite Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden and renowned actor Patrick Stewart, and in the NBC miniseries \"Jackie, Ethel, Joan: Women of Camelot\". She also starred on David E. Kelley's drama, \"Chicago Hope\", marking her second project with Kelley, following their successful collaboration on the critically acclaimed, Emmy Award-winning series, \"Picket Fences\".\n\nHolly has worked on numerous Independent films, including the political thriller \"Fatwa\", in which she not only acted but also served as a producer, the Peter Schwaba penned and directed comedy \"Godfather of Green Bay\", \"The Chumscrubber\", \"Pleasure Drivers\", a Lifetime movie \"Caught in the Act\" (which she also produced), and \"Chasing 3000\". Most recently, she starred in \"You're So Cupid\". Additional projects contributing to the broad and diverse body of motion picture work Lauren has compiled include the drama \"Colored Eggs\" with Academy Award winner Faye Dunaway, the comedy \"Raising Flagg\" playing opposite Academy Award winner Alan Arkin, the Darrell Roodt directed HBO thriller, \"Pavement\" (co-starring Robert Patrick), and \"What Women Want\" (starring Academy Award winners Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt). She had a prime role in Disney's Academy Award-winning animated motion picture \"Spirited Away\" as the voice of Chihiro's Mother. Thrice divorced, as of 2014, Holly makes her home in Toronto, Canada, with her sons: Alexander, George, and Henry."
