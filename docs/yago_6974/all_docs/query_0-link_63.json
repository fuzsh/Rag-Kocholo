        "text": "Lauren Holly (born October 28, 1963) is an American-Canadian actress. She portrays Monique on Netflix's Tiny Pretty Things.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBorn in Bristol, Pennsylvania, the daughter of two college professors, Lauren grew up in the upstate New York town of Geneva. Her childhood was split between experiences that contrasted. She was privy to the shelter of growing up in a rural town and also exposed due to the erudite sophistication of her parents' academic careers. Lauren spent time traveling in Europe and lived for a year in London, where she studied languages and flute at the famed Sarah Siddons School. A graduate of Sarah Lawrence College in New York, Lauren credits her love of acting to her great-grandmother who bred a family tradition of \"treading the boards\" on the musical theatre stages of Liverpool and London. Lauren's breakthrough motion picture performance came in the New Line Cinema's box-office smash, Dumb and Dumber (1994), with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels.\n\nCredits[]\n\nActress[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nCorps\n\nRange of Motion\n\nClass Act\n\nDance Dance Revolution\n\nSplit Sole\n\nJoie de Vivre\n\nCatch and Release\n\nRelev√©\n\nIt's Not the Walking, It's the Rising\n\nPush Comes to Shove\n\nTrivia[]\n\n[]\n\nat the\n\non\n\nGallery[]"
