        "text": "How many times did Jim Carrey get married?\n\n\"No.\" Is incorrect, simply the fact is that Jim Carrey has been married, and to a woman. Actually make that women. He was married to two, at separate times of course. Here it is: 1996 - 1997 Lauren Holly. 1987-1995 Melissa Womer - one child, Jane Carrey, born 1987.\n\nWifes of Jim Carrey?\n\nExcuse me I think you mean \"wives\". Well, he's been married twice. First was Melissa Womer, and then Lauren Holly."
