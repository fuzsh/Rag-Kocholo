        "text": "NCIS: Thrilling teaser trailer for NEW episode 'Hail Mary'\n\nCBS series NCIS first aired back in 2003 with audiences plunged into the high octane world of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service’s Major Case Response Team. Each week the team crack a case as the clock ticks. The show has proved to be such a success that it spawned the spin-off series NCIS: New Orleans and NCIS: LA. The show has a massive cast of characters that have changed over the years.\n\nOne of the early cast members to have departed from the show was actress Lauren Holly who played Director Jenny Shepard in the series.\n\nShe was part of NCIS from 2005 to 2008 (seasons three to five) with the role reuniting her with Mark Harmon and Rocky Carroll, whom she’d worked with on Chicago Hope.\n\nThe character of Director Shepard had previously been romantically involved with the head of the NCIS team Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon).\n\nShe also had a close relationship with Ziva David (Cote De Pablo) which began before she was working as the director.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

About five different ways!”\n\nShe added: “I wish them all success. The show continues to be watched by millions.\n\n“A lot of people depend on it for their families. For that, I hope it continues forever. It probably will. I think of them all often.”\n\nNCIS season 17 airs on CBS in the US on Tuesdays 8/7c"
