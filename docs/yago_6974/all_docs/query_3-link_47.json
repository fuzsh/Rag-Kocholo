        "text": "Hollywood actor Jim Carrey’s girlfriend Cathriona White, who died in a suspected suicide last week, was married to another man at the time of her death, according to sources. White’s body will be released to her husband for repatriation to her native Ireland, an official with the Los Angeles county medical examiner’s office said, reports hollywoodreporter.com.\n\n“She had a husband, we have a husband as next of kin,” said the medical examiner’s official. “We’re not releasing any more information on next of kin, but we do have her as married.”\n\nThe news was confirmed by a second well-placed source close to Carrey, who said that White was indeed married but separated from her husband and was planning to file divorce proceedings sometime in December.\n\nRead: Jim Carrey’s girlfriend found dead\n\n“There is no way that Jim would have taken her out to public places if he thought she was married,” said a well-placed source close to Carrey’s family. “As far as Jim was concerned, Cat was separated from her husband and was going to start divorce proceedings in December. When people are separated they date or do whatever they need to do,” the source added.\n\nThe identity of White’s husband remains unclear, as is the length of their marriage, where they got married and when they separated."
