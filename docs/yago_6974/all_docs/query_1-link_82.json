It seems I’m always working in Vancouver. (This was) easy peasy, man. I just loved it.”\n\nWe caught up with the mother of three sons — formerly married to Canadian comedian Jim Carrey — at her Oakville residence.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nHow’s Canada suiting you and your family?\n\nEveryone’s dual (citizenship) including me. And I decided two years ago, ‘This is stupid. I live here. I feel at home here. I’ve built a whole career here. I need to apply for my citizenship.’ And I became citizen a year ago and I was shocked how emotional the ceremony was for me. I was so happy.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nDid you shoot Tiny Pretty Things with COVID-19 protocols?\n\nNo. It was from end of July to December last year. It was perfect. And we wrapped and I took my boys on this incredible epic trip. We went to Tokyo for Christmas and Sydney Australia for New Year’s Eve. And it was just going to be just a fabulous trip. And we came back and got sick. I even wonder if we had COVID already in our house. I don’t know to tell you the truth. I’m certainly not acting like we had it and running around. I’ve been locked in my house.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nTiny Pretty Things is based on a young adult novel but your character, Madame Monique, who is a former prima ballerina and now the head of an elite Chicago ballet academy, was created specifically for the series. How did it feel to be No.1 on the call sheet?\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nI said to (writer-showrunner-executive producer) Michael (MacLennan), ‘Listen, I’m going to try and be the best number one that you could ever have.’ Because I had that on my first big successful show with Kathy Baker on Picket Fences (1992-1996). I’ve been doing this for 35 years and I would say this is the second time from the very first day, it just felt like there was magic dust.”\n\nDo you expect there will be a second season then?\n\nI don’t think we’ll know until the data comes in. So I just want everyone to watch because I want to do it again so much. I think what Netflix was saying was, if we get to go back, they said it’ll probably be like May so that (hopefully) there will be vaccines available and all that. Because between sex and dancing on this show, I’m not sure how you do it otherwise.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
