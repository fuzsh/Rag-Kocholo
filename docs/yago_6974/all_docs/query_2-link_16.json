        "text": "Kit Harrington and Rose Leslie\n\nThese two Game of Thrones stars hit it off pretty quickly when they were coupled as Ygritte and Jon Snow in the show’s second season.\n\nBut they kept their actual romance hidden until going public in 2016. Two years later, they tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony in Scotland.\n\nRyan Reynolds and Blake Lively\n\nThese two hilarious (and gorgeous) A-listers have been together now for nearly a decade, and just welcomed a third child earlier this year. The stars first met on the set of 2010’s superhero film, The Green Lantern.\n\nAt the time, Reynolds was married to Scarlett Johansson, but by the following year, those two had split and he and Lively began dating.\n\nGoldie Hawn and Kurt Russell\n\nThis couple is celebrating their 35th year together – but they never tied the knot. The two, who met on the set of a Disney film in the 1960s, have several children together.\n\nTheir daughter, Kate Hudson, is a successful actress and entrepreneur in her own right. Their relationship is widely regarded as one of the strongest (and longest) that Hollywood has ever seen.\n\nLauren Morelli and Samira Wiley\n\nAccording to an interview Wiley gave with BUST magazine, she fell in love with wife Lauren Morelli’s mind long before she even met her in person.\n\nThat’s because when she read the Orange is The New Black script she wrote, which included Wiley’s breakthrough character, Poussey, she just knew she was something special. The women were married in Palm Springs in 2017.\n\nHalle Berry and Oliver Martinez\n\nThis pair fell for one another in the midst of the production of 2010’s Dark Tide, and made things official in 2013. They had a son during their marriage but wound up getting divorced just two years after they’d tied the knot.\n\nBerry is currently in a heated custody battle over her daughter, Nahla, that she has from one of her other past relationships with model Gabriel Aubry.\n\nWill and Jada Pinkett Smith\n\nThese two are just one of the most adorable (and longest-lasting) relationships in Hollywood. The pair met when they were both auditioning for the 90’s hit comedy, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\n\nThey tied the knot later that same decade and they’re still married today. The couple has two children together, Willow and Jaden Smith, both of whom have followed in mom and dad’s footsteps and already made their own pretty major marks on the entertainment world.\n\nKaley Cuoco and Johnny Galecki\n\nGalecki and Cuoco met on the set of primetime favorite, The Big Bang Theory. They dated for a while but ultimately decided they were better off as friends.\n\nNow, their characters on the show are married, which you’d think may make it awkward between exes. But Cuoco told CBS that Johnny is “one of her best friends.”\n\nZoe Saldana and Bradley Cooper\n\nSaldana met Cooper on the set of The Words, in 2011. They spent several months as a couple, but broke up just before New Year’s Eve the following year.\n\nApparently, there were no hard feelings between the two, who later on shared the red carpet at the L.A premiere of Guardians Of The Galaxy.\n\nRyan Gosling and Eva Mendes\n\nYou may not hear about the romantic relationship between these A-listers, that’s spanned decades. That’s because the stars, who met while working together on The Place Beyond the Pines, in 2012, keep everything pretty private.\n\nThe gorgeous couple has two daughters and a rescue dog.\n\nAnna Paquin and Stephen Moyer\n\nThese True Blood co-stars had some seriously steamy moments on the HBO series about vampires, werewolves and other creatures of the night. But as it turns out, what they shared on-screen turned into a real, off-screen romance.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in 2010 and are still together. Paquin gave birth to twins in 2012.\n\nGina Torres and Laurence Fishburne\n\nThe actors met while filming the second installment of The Matrix trilogy, in 2001.\n\nThings got serious and they tied the knot the following year. After 14 years as a married couple and one child, however, they split.\n\nPenelope Cruz and Javier Bardem\n\nCruz and Bardem first met on the set of the 1992 film, Jamón Jamón, when Cruz was just a teenager. But when they met again a decade later, things took a romantic turn.\n\nThe two were married in 2010 and have two children together.\n\nJosh Dallas and Ginnifer Goodwin\n\nLike in any good fairy tale, these two met once upon a time…or, they met on the set of Once Upon a Time, on which Josh plays the actual Prince Charming and Goodwin, his princess. Josh recalled the moment he woke Sleeping Beauty with a kiss in one scene and it started snowing in real life.\n\nThe actor said it seemed so “symbolic and magical.” And it seems it was, because a few years later, the two were married and have lived happily ever after ever since.\n\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux\n\nJennifer Anniston’s extensive list of costars she’s gotten romantic with continues on with Justin Theroux. The stars met on the set of Wanderlust, in 2012, and started dating after filming wrapped.\n\nThey tied the knot in 2015 but divorced just a couple of years later.\n\nHugh Dancy and Claire Danes\n\nThis pair met on the set of Evening, in 2007, and started dating almost immediately. Two years later, they got married and are still together today.\n\nThe actors live in New York City with their two sons.\n\nEmma Stone and Andrew Garfield\n\nThese two hilarious actors have had an extensive on-again, off-again relationship over the course of basically the last decade.

They recently helped raise over $1 million to fund the LA Dance Project Gala together. In 2023, it was revealed that the couple were separating after 11 years together.\n\nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt\n\nThese two superstars probably have one of the most publicized relationships of all time. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that, while they got together, Brad was still married to Hollywood’s golden girl, Jennifer Aniston. The world was not happy when they heard what came next.\n\nJolie first met the actor when they worked together as the sultry spy couple, Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Apparently, things got pretty hot and heavy fairly quickly, and they were together not long after. The two ended up having several children of their own and adopting several more from multiple countries.\n\nCharlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer\n\nThese two stars both made their breakthrough debuts and met each other on the Netflix hit show, Stranger Things.\n\nThey are still together a year after, making their couple’s debut at the Emmy Awards in 2018.\n\nAlexis Bledel and Vincent Kartheiser\n\nThe Gilmore Girls and Handmaid’s Tale star met fellow actor and husband, Vincent Kartheiser when she played his mistress in the ’50s set drama, Mad Men.\n\nThe stars started dating when they wrapped filming, got married in 2014, and welcomed their son into the world the following year.\n\nCamila Mendes and Charles Melton\n\nThese two Riverdale stars fell head over heels for each other on the set of the popular CW series and announced their official relationship in 2018.\n\nThey are still going strong, although there have been recent rumors of potential turbulence between the two. They very well may just be that though, since they are known to be very private people.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr.\n\nThe former vampire slayer met her future husband while they were filming 90’s teen slasher flick, I Know What You Did Last Summer, near Wilmington, North Carolina in 1997.\n\nThe couple just celebrated their 17th wedding anniversary earlier this year. They have a son and daughter together and currently live in Los Angeles.\n\nJennifer Carpenter and Michael C. Hall\n\nThey may have played siblings on the primetime serial killer series, Dexter, but off-screen they had an entirely different relationship going on.\n\nThe two dated for a year before tying the knot in 2008. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out between them and things ended in divorce in 2011.\n\nRyan Gosling and Rachel McAdams\n\nThe Notebook may be one of the most popular romance movies of the 21st century, but as it turns out, the main actors actually couldn’t stand each other during filming.\n\nGosling and McAdams may have first met on the set of the 2005 film, but they didn’t realize their feelings for one another until they wrapped. They dated for a few years until calling it quits in 2007.\n\nNicole Kidman and Tom Cruise\n\nThese two stars were perhaps one of the most famous married couples of the 1990s.

Things didn’t last very long, although Vince later said that he thought she “is great.”\n\nThe couple said they spent a lot of their time trying to avoid drawing too much attention to themselves, especially considering they started dating right around her (very public) divorce from Brad Pitt.\n\nKristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson\n\nTeenagers all across America swooned when these Twilight costars first took their romance off-screen in 2008. But in 2012, rumors of Stewart being unfaithful led to their ultimate split.\n\nShe later had a steamy relationship with model Stella Maxwell and is currently reported to be with screenwriter Dylan Meyer.\n\nLili Reinhart and Cole Sprouse\n\nReinhart and Sprouse are the second set of Riverdale stars on this list to have evolved from an on-screen couple to an off-screen relationship.\n\nThey are still happily together and frequently post adorable couple stuff on their Instagram pages. The two are still very much together as Betty and Jughead on the show, as well.\n\nJennifer Lawrence and Darren Aronofsky\n\nThe Hunger Games star first met Aronofsky while he directed her in the 2017 psychological horror thriller, Mother!.\n\nBut the same thing that brought them together would eventually drive them apart, as the turbulence and stress of the press tour and negative reviews took their toll on the relationship, which ended just a year after its inception.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie\n\nThese mega celebs met while filming the 1999 drama, Pushing Tin.
