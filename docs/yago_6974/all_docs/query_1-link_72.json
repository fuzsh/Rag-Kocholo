Dumb And Dumber actress Lauren Holly, who met husband Jim Carrey while filming the wacky comedy, is filing for a divorce from her estranged partner. Holly is said to be asking Carrey, who can command $20 million fees, for spousal support. Irreconcilable differences were cited as the reason for the split.
