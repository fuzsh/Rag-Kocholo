        "text": "A striking and intelligent leading lady, Lauren Holly found success as an actress in both television and film. Known first as the tough but sensitive Deputy Maxine Stewart on the Emmy Award-winning \"Picket Fences\" (CBS, 1992-96), Holly garnered critical acclaim for her refined performance in \"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story\" (1993) and drew raves for her comedic prowess opposite the then new comedy giant, Jim Carrey in the less-than-sophisticated hit, \"Dumb & Dumber\" (1994). Their relationship off screen propelled her to heretofore undreamed of heights, with the tabloids following their every move throughout their tempestuous romance and marriage in the mid 1990s. The spotlight was so firmly fixated on the Carrey connection or what hair color Holly would debut next, that it was often forgotten that the actress was a smart and charismatic leading and supporting player. In 2006, she returned to her television roots as NCIS Director Jenny Shepard on the CBS series \"NCIS\" (CBS, 2003- ), putting to rest any doubts that her past onscreen success, both on the big and small screen, was a fluke."
