        "text": "Leroy Jethro Gibbs\n\n“NCIS” will never be the same without Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs. If you so much as even think of the series, your mind automatically thinks of the iconic pensive face of the NCIS Major Case Response team leader. Not only is Gibbs a thorough and intelligent investigator, but he is a former marine, specifically in the sniper corps.\n\nThe only thing Gibbs doesn’t seem to have a hold on is his love life – either he struggles with commitment or marries the wrong person completely. When Gibbs finally quit NCIS, many viewers were upset, believing that he made the show.\n\nMark Harmon – Leroy Jethro Gibbs\n\nMark Harmon is officially the face of “NCIS”. Sadly, viewers had to say goodbye to Harmon in Season 18, but Harmon did not completely let go of “NCIS” altogether. He did make a couple of appearances, acting in the role of a consultant offering investigative assistance. To this date, Harmon has been featured in over 400 episodes of the TV series.\n\nHowever, that’s not all he did. You might remember Harmon from “Freaky Friday” or “Chasing Liberty.” He has also been featured as a voice actor in an episode of “Family Guy”. Now that the actor is over 70 years old, he has decided to retire.\n\nJacqueline “Jack” Sloane\n\nIn Season 15, we first met the lovely, but troubled Jacqueline “Jack” Sloane. This character has had a difficult past, making her a complex but interesting individual. After a fateful mission in Afghanistan, Sloane is left with emotional scars and guilt over what happened to her team in Afghanistan, which causes Sloane to act out and subsequently be forced to leave the army. She then joins the NCIS Major Response Team under Special Agent Gibbs.\n\nIn Season 18, we have to say goodbye to Sloane because she has an opportunity to seek redemption by staying in Afghanistan to provide aid.\n\nMaria Bello – Jacqueline “Jack” Sloane\n\nDoesn’t this actress look familiar? The actress first came to major prominence with her roles in “Coyote Ugly” and “A History of Violence”. While she has had numerous roles in her career, she has taken to playing a large role in production after she did not renew her contract with “NCIS”.\n\nFor instance, in 2022 Bello was one of the producers of the historical drama “The Woman King”. However, the actress has not said goodbye completely to her acting career with a following role in the TV series “Beef”.\n\nDonald “Ducky” Mallard\n\nAnd the most loyal NCIS worker is …Donald “Ducky” Mallard. We know the “NCIS” creators were just having fun when they came up with this character. The proof is in the name. Donald “Ducky” Mallard was the principle NCIS Medical Examiner and definitely one of the longest-serving examiners.\n\nWhile you may think Ducky’s job in the labs is safe, this character has seen more dangerous moments, including being taken hostage. But still, Ducky remain devoted to the lab until he retired officially in Season 19. Despite having his own nickname “Ducky”, Ducky never calls his teammates by their nicknames.\n\nDavid McCallum – Donald “Ducky” Mallard\n\nThe late David McCallum’s standout roles were in the war movie “The Great Escape” and the TV series “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” Yes, we’re talking about the 1960s, since the actor was born in 1933! During his lifetime, McCallum has had more than 100 acting credentials to his name.\n\nAfter making an exit from “NCIS,” McCallum has taken roles in the film “Baby Driver”. He also devoted much of his time doing voice work for videos, video games, and animations like “Ben 10: Alien Force”.\n\nAnthony DiNozzo Sr.\n\nWhile it is true that this character did not make up the main crew, he could more or less be considered part of the NCIS family. In fact, Anthony DiNozzo Sr. is the father to one of the more commanding Special Agents, Anthony DiNozzo Jr. That said, the DiNozzo Sr. is more than your average father.\n\nOn many occasions, he gives much delight to audiences with his surprising appearances including in the episode “You Better Watch Out” in season 10, where the senior DiNozzo is caught in bed with his neighbor.\n\nRobert Wagner — Anthony DiNozzo Sr.\n\nYou surely have seen this actor around. He has been in showbiz for ages. His career started in the 1950s and has spanned eight decades. Interestingly, Robert Wagner was simply supposed to serve as a guest appearance on “NCIS”.\n\nHe was invited to star in Season 7, Episode 12 “Flesh and Blood”, but has since been invited back to make one appearance in every season. Wagner is notable for his roles as Number Two in “Austin Power” films and as Dan Bigelow in “The Towering Inferno”. The actor is rumored to star in the upcoming production, “SuperSonic”.\n\nTimothy “Tim” McGee\n\nIn Season 1, Timothy “Tim” McGee made a couple of appearances, but a season later he made up the main cast and workforce. McGee attended John Hopkins University where he studied Bio-medical engineering. If that is not enough, he later attended MIT where he did his graduate course in Medical Forensics.\n\nHe joined the NCIS team and later worked his way up to be the temporary leader of the Major Case Response Team. Thanks to his background, McGee offers his team a lot of help with hacking.\n\nSean Murray – Timothy McGee\n\nAs one of the longest-serving actors on “NCIS”, Sean Murray has spent a lot of time in “NCIS” filming studios. Many of Murray’s acting credentials pre-date “NCIS”. He starred in fantasy comedies such as “Hocus Pocus” and the biographical drama “This Boy’s Life”.\n\nDuring his time filming “NCIS”, he also made up the cast of the TV movie “Agatha Christie: Ordeal by Innocence” and was featured in the NCIS video game. After joining the “NCIS” crew, McGee met Carrie James and the two married a year later. The couple now has two children.\n\nLeon Vance\n\nAfter working as Director Jennifer Shepard’s assistant, Leon Vance’s dedication paid off. Sadly, it was Shepard’s death that landed Vance this role. Before Vance, there had never been a longer-serving NCIS Director. He was later promoted to the NCIS director role.\n\nInterestingly, Vance initially trained to be a boxer before attending the naval academy. He worked hard, and his capabilities made him rise to the position of Second Lieutenant. Vance first entered the NCIS labs in Season 5 and he has been loyal ever since.\n\nRocky Carroll – Leon Vance\n\nWhile this actor is most recognized for his roles in TV series such as “NCIS” and “Chicago Hope”, Rocky Carroll actually started out in the theater. Carroll attended School for Creative and Performing Arts (SCPA) in Ohio but continued to further his education at The Conservatory of Theatre Arts at Webster University in St. Louis where he obtained a bachelor’s in Fine Arts.\n\nThe actor’s artistic vision has now taken him to experiment with directing. He has directed one episode of “NCIS” and an episode of the remake “Magnum P.I.”.\n\nZiva David\n\nThough this character is one of the favorites among viewers, she has had a complex relationship with her onscreen co-workers. It is easy to understand as her half-brother was responsible for killing one of her former teammates, Caitlin Todd. Nothing quite makes your colleague dislike you more than being related to a close friend’s killer.\n\nOver time, she manages to prove her loyalty to her NCIS teammates and becomes a dependable team member. David forms strong bonds with her colleagues, especially Tony DiNozzo. The two end up marrying and having a child together.\n\nCote de Pablo – Ziva David\n\nThis actress, Cote de Pablo, has one of the most interesting reasons for leaving “NCIS”. She believed that the character did not get as much respect as she deserved and did not agree with the character’s development and storyline. Now, that is something considering that Ziva David was one of the most loved characters on “NCIS”.\n\nDe Pablo was born in Santiago, Chile. Since “NCIS” she has starred in the crime drama series “The Jury” and the historical drama “The 33”. The actress was in a relationship with Ecuadorian actor, Diego Serrano, but the two have since split up.\n\nCailin Todd\n\nAfter a Navy Commander dies during Airforce One, the NCIS step in to investigate. Only they end up having another member, Caitlin Todd, join their team. When the NCIS team meets Todd, she is working as a Secret Service Agent. However, after learning that the marine she was in a romantic relationship with was killed, Todd joins the NCIS Major Response Team as a junior member.\n\nShe proves as an invaluable member of the NCIS team with her background as a Secret Service. Sadly, viewers do not enjoy much time with Todd as she meets her demise in Season 2.\n\nSasha Alexander – Caitlin Todd\n\nSasha Alexander is actually Suzana S. Drobnjaković, a Serbian and American actress who was born in Los Angeles. Before joining “NCIS” the actress gained some fame in her appearances in “Dawson’s Creek” and “Wasteland”.\n\nIn 2005, Alexander formally left the show, but she did make some guest appearances in later seasons. The main motivation for Alexander to leave was to develop her acting career and the actress certainly has done so. In “Rizzoli & Isles” she starred in one of the main roles as Dr. Isles and in “Shameless” she played the role of Helene Runyon.\n\nNick Torres\n\nDespite enjoying a long career as an NCIS Special Agent, viewers have had a complex relationship with Nick Torres. Originally, Torres left the undercover or deep cover unit to work with NCIS to try to lead a more normal life.\n\nAs mentioned, viewers have a complex relationship with Torres. On the one hand, the character has had a difficult past losing his ex-girlfriend to cancer and struggling with his romance with his team member. On the other hand, Torres comes across as a bit arrogant and puts too much pressure on Ellie Bishop to have children.\n\nWilmer Valderama – Nick Torres\n\nAt first, you’d never say, but the actor playing Nick Torres also starred as Fez in the classic TV series, “That 70s Show”. Born Wilmar Eduardo Valderrama to a Venezuelan father and Columbian mother, the actor grew up in Miami. When he isn't acting, he takes an interest in the voting rights of Hispanic people in the US.\n\nValderrama was also featured in other films as a voice actor for both “Encanto” and “Charming”. He also made a comeback with “That 90s Show” playing Fez once again.\n\nEleanor “Ellie” Bishop\n\nFor much of her time on “NCIS”, fans were wondering ‘Will they? Won’t they?’ And only in the final season do we know whether Eleanor “Ellie” Bishop and Nick Torres get together. Known by their combined name, Ellick, their onscreen relationship has even led to fanfiction being created about their romance.\n\nThat being said, Ellie should never just be known for her relationship with Torres. This former NSA agent joined NCIS and with her fierce determination and ability to respond to threats adequately, Ellie earned a promotion to a senior role.\n\nEmily Wickersham – Ellie Bishop\n\nThis Kansas-born actress has slowly made a name for herself in film and TV. Though she was born in Kansas, Emily Wickersham’s family relocated to the state of New York. One of her first big roles was portraying Ellie on “NCIS”. For almost eight years Wickersham completed the main cast of “NCIS”.\n\nThe actress was featured in TV shows such as “The Bridge” and films like “Gone” and “I am Number Four”. Since the actress left “NCIS” in May 2021 and gave birth to a son in June 2021, we’re suspecting that might be the reason for leaving the show.\n\nAbigail Sciuto\n\nWho could ever forget Abbey Sciuto? “NCIS” fans certainly will not. The character exited in Season 15 after being a part of the team for a staggering 16 years. Though Sciuto was a serious and hardworking forensic scientist, she had a colorful personality and was always one to have a go at her colleagues like Leroy Gibbs and Tony DiNozzo.\n\nHer personality may have been bright and colorful but her clothes weren’t. Sciuto was one of the first mainstream goths and one of the best onscreen representations of goths. The character brought much warmth to the silver screen.\n\nPauley Perrette — Abigail Sciuto\n\nApparently, Pauley Perrette, who played the charismatic and quirky onscreen goth, Abbey Sciuto, finally called it quits on “NCIS” because she was scared of her co-star Mark Harmon. Yikes! According to Perrette, it took her a long time to open up about her fears and to get the courage to leave “NCIS”.\n\nSince her “NCIS” days, Perrette has taken up a major role in the comedy “Broke”. The actress in her earlier days starred in films such as “Almost Famous” and was a voice actor for the TV series “Fantasy Hospital”.\n\nAnthony “Tony” DiNozzo Jr.\n\nAfter working his way up, Anthony DiNozzo eventually managed to become second in command. He started out as a probationary officer but after much hard work and dedication, he became Special Agent Leroy Gibbs’, right-hand man. DiNozzo joined the team in 2001 and fifteen years later, he finally called it quits.\n\nOnce his daughter, Talia, was born, DiNozzo was a changed man – and he wanted nothing more than to settle down with his family. This character won many of the hearts of the audience, especially with his relationship with his coworker, Ziva David.\n\nMichael Weatherly — Anthony DiNozzo Jr.\n\nIt was hard for viewers to say goodbye to Anthony DiNozzo aka “Michael Weatherly” when the actor finally called it quits. The audience finally said goodbye to DiNozzo after seeing him for 13 seasons. The reason for Weatherly’s departure was he wanted to try something new.\n\nInterestingly, Weatherly also reported feeling burnt out after his long commitment to “NCIS”. Another major role Weatherly has had was playing Logan Cale in “Dark Angel”. Since leaving “NCIS”, he has become the lead actor in the CBS legal drama “Bull”, where he plays a psychologist that helps firms to select the best jurors.\n\nDr. Jeanne Benoit\n\nSpecial Agent Anthony DiNozzo certainly knows how to pick them – or rather knew how to pick them. To be fair, DiNozzo had started dating Dr. Jeanne Benoit as a part of an undercover operation.\n\nIn Season 4, DiNozzo and Benoit met and slowly their onscreen romance began to blossom. The only problem was that her father was an international and powerful arms dealer who DiNozzo was trying to get intel on. Naturally, things didn’t go too well when the truth finally came to light but still DiNozzo’s and Benoit’s romance won over many viewers.\n\nScottie Thompson — Dr. Jeanne Benoit\n\nWhether it is on TV or on the stage, Scottie Thompson was born to perform. From a young age this actress, hailing from Richmond, Virginia, took dancing lessons specifically in ballet and modern dance.\n\nIn 2006, Thompson landed a role starring in the TV series “Brotherhood”. After a couple of appearances on “Ugly Betty” and “CSI: NY”, Thompson landed her role on “NCIS”, which is one of most notable to date. She left the show in 2008 but returned in 2015 to 2016. Since 2016, Thompson has starred in the TV series “The Blacklist” and “12 Monkeys”.\n\nAiden Parker\n\nIn mid-2021, NCIS Special Agent Leroy Gibbs leaves the unit, and, in his place, Aiden Parker joins the team, heading the NCIS Major Response Team. Parker has big shoes to fill as Gibbs was one of the best investigators and leaders of NCIS. However, Parker is no novice.\n\nFormerly, Parker worked as a special agent for the FBI. In June 2021, he was dismissed and then joined NCIS. Parker was once married to Vivian Kolchak who also worked for the FBI as a secret agent. The couple divorced but remained on friendly terms.\n\nGary Cole – Aiden Parker\n\nWith a career spanning almost four decades in entertainment, we’re guessing you’ve seen this actor around. One of Gary Cole’s first claims to fame was Mike Brady in “The Brady Bunch Movie” and “A Brady Bunch Sequel”.\n\nIf you have not seen him, then you have definitely heard him as Cole also has had numerous roles as a voice actor including shows like “Bob’s Burgers” and “Rick and Morty”. The actor is still sticking with “NCIS” but he has also joined the cast of the new series “Velma” and “The Bob’s Burgers Movie”.\n\nMichael “Mike” Franks\n\nFrom a young age, Michael “Mike” Franks joins the US Marines, where he is enlisted in Vietnam. Franks managed to rise in the ranks in the Marines and during the 70s or 80s joins the NCIS team, which was then known as NIS.\n\nOnce again, Franks rose the ranks and eventually earned the title of NIS Special Agent and the position of leader of the Major Response Team. He would stay with the team and the show for six seasons. After a terrorist attack in 1996, Franks resigns and decides to retire in Mexico to spend his time fishing.\n\nMuse Watson – Michael “Mike” Franks\n\nSince 1989, this actor, Muse Watson, has been performing. And Watson, now, in his seventies is still going strong and does not look like he is ready to call it quits. With such as extensive acting career, we’re guessing you have spotted Muse Watson around.\n\nYou’ve probably seen him as the fisherman in the film “I Know What You Did Last Summer” or as an inmate in “Prison Break”. Interestingly, Watson first took to the stage before he joined productions in film and series. Now, you can check out Watson in the TV series “Diary of a Lunatic”.\n\nAlexander “Alex” Quinn\n\nThis character first premiered in Season 14 in the episode “Rouge”. The first impression viewers have of Alex Quinn is that of giving Special Agent Gibbs a mouthful, after he had rejected eight new potential NCIS members. Even though Alex remains a favorite among audiences for her spunky attitude and dedication, viewers only had one season with her, and it was definitely not enough time.\n\nNCIS Special Agent Quinn was in her mid-40s when she joined the team but sadly had to look after her mother who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.\n\nJennifer Esposito – Alexander “Alex” Quinn\n\nBorn in New York City, this actress was raised in Staten Island by parents of Italian descent. In terms of film and TV, Espacito has had quite a career. Some of her first standout roles include appearances on “Spin City” and “Law & Order”.\n\nIn film, she starred in Paul Haggis’ “Crash”, “Welcome to Collinwood”, and “Don’t Say a Word”. Since leaving NCIS in May 2017, Esposito has starred in Amazon Prime’s “The Boys’’ as Susan Raynor and in the series “Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens”. The actress was formerly married to Bradley Cooper but in 2020 remarried Jesper Vesterstrøm.\n\nGerald Jackson\n\nIf you are an original fan of “NCIS”, you will remember Gerald Jackson, as this character goes back all the way to Season 1. Since we have such a short time with Jackson, we don’t know much about him. Jackson works as a medical examiner and assistant to Dr. Donald Mallard, who is the principal medical examiner for NCIS Major Case Response Team.\n\nDuring episode 16 of season 1, a hostage situation occurs, and Jackson and Mallard were both taken as hostages. Jackson was shot and had to go on extended leave but did not return to NCIS.\n\nPancho Demmings – Gerald Jackson\n\nPancho Demmings brought the character of Gerald Jackson to life. Sadly, Demmings did not have a long stay with “NCIS”. It was not Demmings but the writers of “NCIS” who decided to have the character cut from the script. Gerald Jackson was on extended leave after sustaining a gunshot, but the character never returned to the medical theater.\n\nSince “NCIS”, Demmings has continued to star in crime and investigation shows and has had appearances on “CSI: New York”, “Bones”, “The Mentalist”, and “Cold Case”. Demmings has found more success with series such as “Tyler and Borelli” playing policeman Chuck Tyler.\n\nThomas “Trent” Kort\n\nEvery good series has a great villain and Trent Kort is one of the best villains of “NCIS”. Trent Kort enjoys dabbling in treason in his free time, meaning that there is plenty of excitement on NCIS when he makes an appearance. Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo was sent on a special undercover mission by NCIS leader Jenny Shepard, which threatens Kort’s arms operation. Kort tries to jeopardize Shepard’s authority.\n\nHe is a great villain – he even has the eyepatch, which is later replaced with a glass eye. This cold, methodical villain adds tension to “NCIS” and tests DiNozzo and Shepard.\n\nDavid Dayan Fisher – Thomas “Trent” Kort\n\nYou have probably seen David Dayan Fisher, especially if you have watched “National Treasure” or “Everlasting”. Gifted with a remarkably deep voice, Fisher has been frequently cast as the villain. Born in London, Fisher’s career took off when he appeared in the British crime show, “The Bill”.\n\nFour years later, Fisher entered American TV, making cameos in TV shows such as “Robbery Homicide Division” and “Charmed”. After leaving “NCIS”, the actor joined the History Channel’s show “Knightfall” – a reimagining of the Knights Templar. During his time with “NCIS”, Fisher starred in the film “Everlasting” and the TV series “Rush Hour”.\n\nCynthia Sumner\n\nAlso known as NCIS Tech Cynthia Summer, this character made a brief appearance in Season 2 but officially joined the NCIS crew in Seasons 3 and 4 where she worked with the NCIS Director, Jennifer Shepard. In the episode “Mind Games” and “The Voyeur’s Web”, we see Summer working as an MTAC Tech.\n\nThanks to her dedication and good work, she is then promoted to the NCIS director’s assistant. Though Summer proved to be a popular character among audiences, she had a short stay on NCIS and left in Season 4.\n\nStephanie Mello – Cynthia Summer\n\nThis actress has slowly managed to work her way up in the world of entertainment. Little is known about the actress except that Stephanie Mello started out in TV commercials, both in Boston and Los Angeles. Her biggest role to date is as Cynthia Summer in “NCIS”.\n\nThe actress has also made appearances in the family comedy “Growing Pains” and the soap opera “The Bold and the Beautiful”. After her time with “NCIS”, she has since made an appearance on the TV series “Big Time Rush”. Mello played a main role in the film “Co-Incidence”.\n\nMichelle Lee\n\nThis is probably not everyone’s favorite character, but Special Agent Michelle Lee, aka Michy, gave us plenty of surprises, tension, and drama. In Season 4, Michy entered NCIS and started working on the NCIS Major Response Team as a temporary member.\n\nAs the story develops, viewers soon realize that Michy is not who they think she is. Of course, the NCIS department is bound to have leaks now and then, it is just surprising that it came in the form of Michelle Lee. That said, the audience feels a bit of a tender spot for her and her younger sister.\n\nLiza Lapira – Michelle Lee\n\nThis actress hails from Queens, New York City. Born in a city that never sleeps, Lapira first took to acting on stage and in indie films. However, it was in the city of angels, where Lapira could get her big break in TV. Her major roles to date include her role as Michelle Lee in “NCIS” and Ivy in “Dollhouse”.\n\nLapira has also had roles in films such as “Domino” and “Crazy Stupid Love”. After leaving “NCIS”, the actress starred in “The Fabulous Filipino Brothers” and made appearances in “The Good Doctor”.\n\nDr. Grace Confalone\n\nWorking in the grizzly and gory world of crime scene investigation, the job is bound to have some psychological ramifications for its detectives and special agents. Fortunately, the department of Navy has taken all kinds of measures to ensure their staff is well supported.\n\nOne of those measures is the supportive Dr. Grace Confalone. While the psychiatrist originally appeared all the way back in Season 3, she started appearing more frequently from season 13 onwards. She is known for her supportive role, counseling Nick Torres, helping the agent to cope with his work, romantic relationship with Bishop, and childhood issues.\n\nLaura Ann Giacomo – Dr. Grace Confalone\n\nFrom first being discovered in a New Jersey high school, Laura Ann Giacomo has over time managed to make her mark in the entertainment world. Yet, it was not with “NCIS” that this actress had her first break. For those of you who love the romantic movie “Pretty Woman”, you will have seen her playing Kit De Luca.\n\nGiacomo also walked away with the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female for her role as Cynthia in “Sex, Lies, and Videotape”. More recently, Giacomo has starred in “The Santa Clauses”, bringing the Italian folklore of Le Bafana to life.\n\nKasie Hines\n\nMany viewers were immensely sad when Abbey Sciuto left the Navy yard. Even her replacement, Kasie Hines was one of her biggest fans and did not know how to act around her. Though audience members were upset at the loss of Sciuto, they got the young and easy-going Kasie Hines in her place.\n\nHines began working under Dr. Donald Mallard, but when Sciuto left, she was promoted to the role of forensics scientist. During her time, she has become quite close to some of her colleagues such as Piper a tech of the Navy Yard’s sub-basement.\n\nDiona Reasonover – Kasie Hines\n\nThis actress must have the coolest surname ever. It makes her a perfect fit to portray forensics scientist Kasie Hines because of course a forensics scientist would have to have reason over anything else.\n\nReasonover was born in Detroit, Michigan, and has had quite a promising start to her career. Once the actress moved to California to study fine arts, she picked up some roles in theater productions. While the actress has been a recent addition to “NCIS”, she has also starred in the spin-off, “NCIS: Hawaii”.\n\nTobias TC Fornell\n\nBetter known as T.C., Tobias Fornell did not work for the NCIS, but he worked very closely with them. Fornell spent much of his career working as an operative of the FBI. His expertise would come in handy, helping the NCIS agents, especially Special Agent Leroy Gibbs.\n\nSadly, Fornell did not take Gibbs’ advice when it came to marriage as Fornell and Diane Sterling – Gibbs’ ex-wife – married. As Gibbs warned, the marriage broke down and ended in a not-so-friendly divorce. Fornell had better luck with his career than marriage. He left the FBI to work as a private investigator.\n\nJoe Spano – Tobias TC Fornell\n\nSince the first season, Joe Spano has made appearances on “NCIS”. While the actor is not part of the main cast, Joe Spano has a recurring spot on the show and he has been there longer than almost anyone else and without fail.\n\nWhen he is not filming in the “NCIS” studios, Spano has had cameos on TV shows such as “The Mentalist”, “In Plain Sight”, and more recently, “Pearson”. The actor also has had roles in films such as “Fracture” and “Apollo 13”. Since 1980, the actor has been married and he and his wife adopted two daughters.\n\nClayton Reeves\n\nIn Season 13, we are introduced to one of the more intriguing characters, Clayton Reeves. While he works as a liaison officer for NCIS International, Reeves is often called into the Washington D.C. branch to assist the Major Case Response Team with homicide investigations. Reeves had a difficult background as he was placed in numerous foster-care homes, some of which were abusive.\n\nThis later took a toll on Reeves, but he managed to come right through charity work and volunteering. Though he was only featured in Seasons 13 to 15, Reeves’ story has made him a popular character.\n\nDuane Henry – Clayton Reeves\n\nIt might seem a bit odd that someone who studied at Dudley College of Technology would go on to become an actor, but interestingly, Duane Henry studied drama at this college. Born in Birmingham, England, Henry spent the first two-thirds of his life in the United Kingdom.\n\nOne of his major roles during this period was as Rory Andrews in “The Cut” which earned him a BAFTA nomination. On leaving “NCIS”, Henry was featured in films such as “Captain Marvel” and the Hallmark movie “A Gingerbread Romance”.\n\nDiane Sterling\n\nWe have to admit that Special Agent Leroy Gibbs has not had the easiest romantic life, but maybe it is just something that comes with the territory of being an NCIS agent. To be fair, Gibbs was not the only one who married Diane Sterling. Before ex-FBI operative Tobias TC Fornell married and divorced her, Diane Sterling was married to Gibbs.\n\nThe couple divorced and she later had a child, Emily, with Tobias. Sterling was also a former investigator as she worked with the criminal division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nMelinda McGraw – Diane Sterling\n\nTo be fair, Melinda McGraw is not the only actress to have portrayed Diane Sterling. McGraw has had an extensive acting career thanks to her range of acting abilities.\n\nNo matter the genre, McGraw can take on the role. She played Barbara Gordon in Christopher Nolan’s epic superhero film “The Dark Knight” and starred in the spoof film “Wrongfully Accused”. In more recent days, McGraw has joined the cast of “Paul T. Goldman”, the revamp of “Charmed”, and “The Crossing”. Interestingly, she also joined “NCIS: New Orleans” but not as Diane Sterling.\n\nJessica Knight\n\nFollowing her parents’ divorce, Jessica Knight remained close to her father so much so that she followed in his footsteps to become an NCIS agent.\n\nOriginally, Knight was assigned to the React Unit team. However, as the story unfolded, three of her team members were killed and one was arrested, causing Knight to join the Major Case Response Team. Once Ellie Bishop had left, it was up to Knight to fill her shoes and she has stuck with the team ever since.\n\nKatrina Law – Jessica Knight\n\nGrowing up, this actress dabbled in a little bit of everything – from weightlifting to soccer to dancing and cheerleading, she did it all. Now, Katrina Law is an actress who has many acting credentials to her name and a promising future ahead of her. Law was born to a father of German and Italian descent and a Taiwanese mother.\n\nWhile she has just recently joined the cast of “NCIS”, she was featured in “Arrow”, “Spartacus”, and “Hawaii Five-O”. Currently, the actress has one child and is married to the actor/director, Keith Andreen.\n\nGreta Ford\n\nWe have met this character, Greta Ford, only recently, as she was introduced to viewers in Season 20. Still, it seems like she will continue to make appearances. Known for her famous blonde ponytail, that does its own curl thing, Ford is a FLETC instructor.\n\nHer job is to make sure that federal operatives receive adequate training and Ford does a great job of it. She is one fierce teacher and not one that trainees want to get on the wrong side of. Fortunately, her trainees, Jessica Knight and Jane Tennant become some of her favorites.\n\nStephanie Hodge – Greta Ford\n\nIn fact, this actress’s career in TV started out in stand-up comedy. Born in Wilmington, Ohio, Stephanie Hodge worked as a stand-up comedian and landed roles in the comedies like “Big Top Pee-Wee”. In 1991, Hodge shot her own stand-up comedy titled, “Stephanie Hodge: Straight Up”.\n\nWhile a familiar face on the “NCIS” cast, the actress has also made appearances on “Young Sheldon”, “Perry Mason”, “Bones” and the show’s spin-off “NCIS: Los Angeles”. Hodge has also made guest appearances on “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody” and “Reba”.\n\nGuy Ross\n\nWhat gives every crime a measure of seriousness is when it is reported and broadcasted on the news. While Guy Ross may not have the most important role in the show, he also still adds a bit of realism to the investigations. Ross was first seen in Season 1 in the episode “One Shot, One Kill”.\n\nHe made his exit in Season 16, with his final episode being, “Toil and Trouble”. Despite being an infrequent cast member, Ross was a reporter for a whole sixteen seasons – meaning he must have been some reporter.\n\nKent Shocknek – Guy Ross\n\nSome actors are doomed to certain typecasts –the tough guy, the iconic pretty woman who should just be pretty, and the nice guys. What is interesting is that Kent Shockneck typically plays the authority figure. Guess it is just the actor’s face that makes him look like the type of person a reporter would be.\n\nWhile Shocknek has been on and off with “NCIS”, he garnered wider attention with his role as – you guessed it – a news broadcaster on “Bosch” and “Fast Five”. Perhaps, Shocknek should have considered a career in journalism.\n\nThomas “Tom” Morrow\n\nThis character, Thomas Morrow, starred in the original “Jag” and then made the spin-off “NCIS” years later. For those of you who watched the crime show in its early days, you will probably remember Morrow.\n\nThen, he was acting as the NCIS director. However, following the killing of one of his own, namely Caitlin Todd, Morrow resigned. His contributions to NCIS did not stop there as Special Agent Leroy Gibbs often sought out the former director. Sadly, Morrow’s contributions do end when he is killed by a sniper.\n\nAlan Dale – Thomas “Tom” Morrow\n\nHailing from New Zealand, you’d expect one thing from actor Alan Dale and that is for him to love sports. Well, that is true. Interestingly, growing up, Dale juggled playing rugby with acting, specifically in theater. Dale did not have much luck in New Zealand or Australia, but once he moved to the USA, his acting career picked up.\n\nAfter leaving “NCIS”, Dale starred in the films “Entourage” and “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”. A more recent production with him has been in the TV series “Dynasty” where he joined the main cast.\n\nJennifer “Jenny” Shepard\n\nWhile this character managed to rise to the ranks of NCIS Director, there was no goal more important than uncovering the true cause of her father’s death. Her father had been Colonel Shepard who worked for the pentagon, until his supposed suicide. Not convinced that her father really took his own life, Jennifer Shepard takes on a life of fighting crime.\n\nFor some time, she serves as the NCIS director, but the shadow of her father’s death always hangs over her. Briefly, she had a romance with Leroy Gibbs, but like most of Gibbs’ relationships, it did not end too well.\n\nLauren Holly – Jennifer “Jenny” Shepard\n\nOne of Lauren Holly’s most iconic roles was in “Dumb and Dumber”, in which the actress alongside her co-star, Jim Carrey, picked up the MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss. When she is not busy locking lips with Carrey onscreen, she is featured in numerous movies such as “Any Given Sunday” and “The Final Storm”.\n\nSpeaking of Jim Carrey, the two married in 1996 but got divorced one year later. She remarried Francis Greco in 2001 but the couple divorced in 2014. Holly left “NCIS” as she felt bored portraying the NCIS director.\n\nDr. Samantha Ryan\n\nThis character served as the head of the DOD PsyOps Division and a love interest for Leroy Gibbs. Unfortunately, the character was not well-loved among “NCIS” fans. She was a colorful onscreen personality but maybe a bit too colorful.\n\nPlus, her flirting with her co-worker probably didn’t do her much good, especially since it seemed rather forced. By now we all know that romance is not Gibbs’ strongest point. In fact, her flirting was so over-the-top that many viewers were convinced she was a double agent. Ryan made an exit when she and her son’s lives were put in danger.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis – Dr. Samantha Ryan\n\nThis actress doesn’t need an introduction, as she is an A-lister and a household name, especially for anyone born in the 1970s and the 1990s. Yes, that is how long she has been in the industry. She is considered one of the quintessential scream queens after starring in John Carpenter’s “Halloween”.\n\nDecades later, she is still screaming as she portrayed Laurie Strode again in 2018 in the “Halloween” remake. You can expect to see her portray “Kay Scarpetta” based on Patricia Cornwell’s novels so look out for that.\n\nMargaret Allison Hart\n\nAdmittedly, this character was not everyone’s favorite. According to more than one list including an Express UK article, she has been voted the most annoying “NCIS” character. Margaret Allison Hart made her first appearance in Season 7 and did not stay for much longer. She is a defense attorney and soon takes a liking to Leroy Gibbs.\n\nUnfortunately, viewers were not buying it. Her flirtations felt put on. Eventually, discovering a file about Gibbs and wishing to protect him Hart makes the decision to leave. We’re not sure if viewers exactly bought it, but we’re sure they’re not complaining.\n\nRena Sofer — Margaret Allison Hart\n\nIf you are a fan of “The Bold and Beautiful”, then you will probably remember Quinn Fuller, who was played by Rena Sofer. The actress also starred in one of the longest-running American soap operas, “General Hospital” and another soap opera, “Melrose Arch”.\n\nSofer later appeared on other TV series including “Spin City” and “Friends”. She was in six “NCIS” episodes and since her departure joined the cast of “The Bold and Beautiful”. In 2022, Sofer left the mega-soap opera. She is currently married to the producer Sanford Bookstaver.\n\nDelilah Fielding\n\nThe character goes through many ups and downs, but luckily for her, she has a solid partner to stand by her side. As the other half of the onscreen couple, Delilah Fielding works for the Department of Defense. In Season 11, audiences cheered when Fielding and Timmy McGee confirmed that they were in fact a couple.\n\nBut it is not all sunshine and roses after that. Fielding sustains an injury paralyzing her and she is also offered a job in Dubai, testing their strong love. At least, viewers were not disappointed by this onscreen romance…but no spoilers.\n\nMargo Harshman – Delilah Fielding\n\nThere are three main shows in which Margo Harshman made her mark on the world of entertainment. They are “Run of the House”, “Even Stevens”, and “NCIS”. In fact, in 2005, the actress was nominated for two awards at the Young Artists Awards: one for starring in the film “The Even Stevens Movie” and the other for starring in the series “Even Stevens”.\n\nAs she is still a member of the “NCIS” main cast, much of Harshman’s work is devoted to the crime series but she has made an appearance on “How I Met Your Father”.\n\nEmily Fornell\n\nIt can not be easy to grow up in a law enforcement household. Emily Fornell is one of those children that prove that while law enforcement and criminal investigation are necessary for society to function, they can be hard on children. Fornell lost her mother in a killing and her father too gets shot and ends up in hospital.\n\nThough she suffers a great deal of hardship, this young girl demonstrates her own skills to become a fine investigator in Season 11 Episode 10, “Devil’s Triad”. Her dating an entomologist hints at her possibly entering the field of crime scene investigation.\n\nJuliette Angelo – Emily Fornell\n\nThough Juliette Angelo is still young, she has taken great strides in her acting career so far. She has already made the cast of several successful TV series including portraying Emily Fornell in “NCIS” and Geneva in “Shameless”.\n\nThe actress has even managed to star in some films such as “Hope Springs Eternal” and “I’ll Be Next Door for Christmas”. The actress has made a number of appearances on “NCIS”, going back to Season 11. However, during this time she has other roles like making an appearance on “Criminal Minds”.\n\nPaula Cassidy\n\nFor fans of old-school “NCIS”, you might remember Paula Cassidy. In Season 1, we were introduced to Special Agent Cassidy whose role is to work as an interrogator in probably the worst place to work as one – Guantanamo Bay. Cassidy is one tough character.\n\nLater, the Special Agent is reassigned to work on the aircraft carrier, U.S.S. Kennedy. But the audience’s last moment is Season 4 Episode 19 when Cassidy sacrifices herself when coming up against a suicide bomber.\n\nJessica Steen – Paula Cassidy\n\nThis actress was born to a showbiz family so little surprise she entered the world of entertainment at a young age. One of Jessica Steen’s first roles (when she was eight) was in a TV series called “The Sunrunners” starring none other than her own mother. Later, in 1994, the Canadian actress moved to New York City.\n\nShe landed roles in the blockbuster “Armageddon” and “Trial & Error”. In 2007, she left “NCIS” and since has landed some major roles like in “Heartland”, “Charmed”, and “Maid”.\n\nMelinda Stone\n\nWith a show that involves the FBI, NSA, and IRS, you’re bound to have some moles or double-crossing individuals pop up. Meet, Melinda Stone. Sure, she was the character only featured in one episode in Season 1, but she became one of the memorable villainesses, mainly because she managed to deceive the NCIS crew.\n\nStone pretends to work at a pawn shop, but her true business is gun-running and arms smuggling. Something was definitely up and “NCIS” gave us a good reason to have our suspicions of pawnbrokers.\n\nBellamy Young – Melinda Stone\n\nAudiences probably best know Bellamy Young for her role in the thriller TV series “Scandal” where the actress portrayed Mellie Grant. This actress was born in North Carolina and attended Yale University. She also studied in the United Kingdom at the British American Drama Academy.\n\nAfter her short role in “NCIS”, Young was featured in numerous films including “Mission Impossible III” and TV series such as “Scrubs” and “CSI: Miami” where she had recurring roles. More recently, the actress starred in the drama “Promised Land”. In 2020, she married Pedro Segundo but a year later their married dissolved.\n\nWest Virginia Sheriff\n\nOkay, admittedly, it was not a big role. And probably most people missed this guest appearance because it took place all the way in season 1. But it did feature Josh Holloway who would land a massive breakthrough with “Lost”.\n\nHowever, if you did remember Episode 12 of Season 1, you will remember an unnamed West Virginian Police Sherriff who had no qualms about making awkward jokes which did not sit well with Leroy Gibbs. It does not help that NCIS was called to investigate the matter of a marine’s limbs found in the trashcan.\n\nJosh Holloway – West Virginia Sheriff\n\nAll the way back in Season 1, this actor was featured on “NCIS” but since then, Josh Holloway has made a name for himself. One of his most notable roles to date was portraying bad-guy Sawyer in “Lost”. Holloway has also made up the cast of “Yellowstone” and “Colony”.\n\nA major moment for the actor was when he was featured in “Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol”. Holloway has also involved himself with the production side of things. He was one of the producers of “Colony” and “Intelligence” – which he also starred in.\n\nElaine Burns\n\nWe all know that a good crime show needs a good villain. What beats a good villain, is a good villainess. Meet Elaine Burns. She could have pulled off the robbery of a lifetime – who can beat Civil War arms – if it were not for Ziva David’s heroic intervention. Before we pulled the mask off this villainess, she worked closely alongside Special Agent Leroy Gibbs as a forensic anthropologist at the Smithsonian.\n\nThe team was sent to investigate the death of Staff Sergeant Warren Sorrow, but when they got too close to learning the truth, Burns showed her true colors.\n\nBarbara Niven – Elaine Burns\n\nAs she was only featured in one “NCIS” episode, Barbara Niven is most notably known for other roles like in the adventure and action series – also based on the navy – “Pensacola: Wings of Gold”.\n\nThe actress also has been featured on numerous other TV programs including “Cold Case”, “ER”, “Las Vegas”, and interestingly, also “Silk Stalkings” which she had been on several times, but always as different characters. Just recently, Niven is known for her role in the Hallmark film series “Murder, She Baked”. Her daughter, Jessica Niven, has just made her own introduction to the world of entertainment.\n\nCommander William Ryan\n\nIf you are an original fan, you might remember Commander William O’Ryan. During the episode “Enigma” – Season 1, Episode 15 – a hostage situation seemingly goes awry and the NCIS team is sent in to investigate. The hostage victim is Commander William Ryan who was none other than Special Agent Leroy Gibbs’ former colonel.\n\nWhen investigating the killing of one of the kidnappers, things don’t seem to add up and it is up to them to understand what is really going on. Even if it means Gibbs must investigate his former military superior.\n\nTerry O’Quinn — Commander William Ryan\n\nThis actor was one of the first guest appearances on “NCIS”, going back all the way to Season 1. This episode aired in February 2004. Seven months later, Terry O’Quinn made his mark on showbiz with his portrayal of John Locke in the island thriller “Lost”.\n\nSince 2004, O’Quinn continues to pick up roles in TV series like “666 Park Avenue” and “Gang Related”. More recently, the actor has starred in the series “Resident Alien” and “FBI: Most Wanted”. Up until 2010, the actor was married to Lori O’Quinn and the couple have two children.\n\nNancy\n\nThis character is another blast from the past – so any die-hard “NCIS” fans, you’d probably just about remember Nancy. In Season 1, Episode 3 entitled “Sea Dog”, the NCIS team is called out to Virginia Beach to investigate the killing of someone called “Sea Dog”.\n\nExcept, it turns out Sea Dog is actually Commander Farrell. Nancy is one of the beach locals who helps Agent DiNozzo with some investigating.\n\nEmilie De Ravin – Nancy\n\nYou probably best know this actress from her portrayal of Claire Littleton in “Lost”. The actress featured on “NCIS” but then went on to have a successful acting career. As mentioned, one of her notable performances was on the much-loved “Lost”.\n\nShe also has joined the main cast of films such as “Brick” and “The Hills Have Eyes”. More recently, De Ravin starred in the fantasy romance TV series “Once Upon a Time”. The Australian actress has been with her partner, Eric Bilitch, since 2014 and she has two children."
