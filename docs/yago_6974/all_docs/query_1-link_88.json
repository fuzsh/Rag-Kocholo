        "text": "The Hills are alive...with the sound of wedding bells! Heidi Montag's sister Holly, who appeared on The Hills (who can forget how much she used to hate Spencer) tied the knot last weekend - the same date that her former co-star, Lauren Conrad, married William Tell.\n\nHolly married Richie Wilson in their hometown of Crested Butte, Colorado, and enlisted her Mum Darlene to take care of the wedding decorations. She wore an empire line gown by designer Pia Michi, and her sister Heidi was the Maid of Honour in a navy dress.\n\n\"It was the most beautiful, majestic, mountain fairy tale wedding,\" Heidi told Us Weekly: \"I was trying to push back my joyful tears throughout the ceremony and evening. It was simply perfect and stunning. I am so blessed to have been a part of it.\"\n\n\"It could not have been more intimate and elegant,\" Holly added. \"Being surrounded by the mountains as the trees are just beginning to turn for fall was absolutely dreamy. It could not have been more magical or perfect for Richie and me.\"\n\nAnd there was major tension on The Hills between Spencer (who attended the wedding) and his sister-in-law Holly, five years after Speidi tied the knot, there's nothing but love between the family (being off camera probably helped) - apparently he's \"thrilled\" with the news."
