        "text": "A striking and intelligent leading lady, Lauren Holly found success as an actress in both television and film. She is known for her role as Deputy Sheriff Maxine Stewart in the TV series Picket Fences, as Mary Swanson in the 1994 film Dumb & Dumber, as Jenny Shepard on the TV series NCIS from 2005 to 2008 and for her relationship with actor Jim Carrey.\n\nHolly was born in Bristol, Pennsylvania. Her mother, Michael Ann, is an art historian, Starr Director of Research and Academic Program at The Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, and former professor at Hobart and William Smith Colleges. Her father, Grant Holly, is a screenwriter and professor of literature at Hobart and William Smith Colleges. Holly was raised in Geneva, New York, and is a 1981 graduate of Geneva High School, where she was a cheerleader. In 1985, Holly earned an undergraduate degree in English from Sarah Lawrence College in New York.\n\nAt age 23, Holly joined the cast of the iconic ABC television soap opera All My Children as Julie Chandler (1986â€“1989). She portrayed the comic book character Betty on television's Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again in 1990.\n\nShe appeared as Mary Swanson, Lloyd Christmas's love interest in the 1994 Jim Carrey comedy Dumb & Dumber. She also portrayed Linda Lee Cadwell, the wife of martial artist and actor Bruce Lee, in 1993's Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story; a doctor in Sydney Pollack's 1995 remake of Sabrina; and Lieutenant Emily Lake, the only woman aboard a submarine, in the 1996 Kelsey Grammer comedy Down Periscope. She also starred in the movie Any Given Sunday along with Jamie Foxx and Dennis Quaid.\n\nShe also appeared in the music video for Dixie Chicks' single \"Goodbye Earl\", along with Jane Krakowski, Dennis Franz, Adrian Pasdar, Michael DeLuise and Evan Bernard.\n\nHolly starred as small-town Deputy Sheriff Maxine Stewart in David E. Kelley's TV series Picket Fences. In 2005, she joined the cast of NCIS as Director Jenny Shepard, and in doing so was reunited with her former Chicago Hope co-star Mark Harmon. Her character was killed off in 2008.\n\nHolly has been married three times. Her first marriage was to Danny Quinn from 1991 to 1993. She then had a high-profile, though short-lived, marriage to Dumb & Dumber costar Carrey from 1996 to 1997. Her latest marriage came in 2001 to Francis Greco. They are currently still together and have adopted three children."
