        "text": "This is one wedding that Iâ€™ve been so anxious to get finished! Trent and Lauren were married on September 19th at Laurenâ€™s family property in Holly, MI. (If youâ€™ve never been to Holly, then youâ€™re missing out. Itâ€™s like a real-life Hallmark Christmas movie setting.)\n\nThe property was just gorgeous. I canâ€™t imagine how much different it looks a month later with Fall color in full force. The ceremony and reception both overlooked a lake. All night long people commented on how beautiful it was. And honestly, it was a perfect place for a wedding!\n\nSeveral weeks before the wedding we did engagement photos in Holly. At that time Lauren showed me all of the things that she had prepared for the wedding. Let me tell you, Lauren is hard working and so creative. She had a vision for her wedding and I canâ€™t help but think that as she looked around during the wedding that she saw all of her dreams come true.\n\nSo let me tell you how I know this couple. Trent is my cousin on my husbandâ€™s side. Weâ€™ve watched him grow up. We love our Michigan family so much and have gone on numerous trips to Mackinac Island together and just have the BEST time when weâ€™re together. The first time we met Lauren was last Summer (2019). My husband reached out to her on Facebook and planned a surprise dinner meet up, half way between Holly and Berne. Trent had no idea that we were going to be at the dinner. He was so shocked when he walked in and saw us. At that time we just knew that Lauren was the one for Trent. And after that we kind of awaited the day until they got engaged. And they did! ðŸ™‚\n\nTrent and Lauren, I am so happy that it worked out for me to be with you on your wedding day. I love you both and am so thankful that God brought you together.\n\nHere are my favorites from your wedding day. ENJOY the highlight reel.\n\nMuch love,\n\nAmy"
