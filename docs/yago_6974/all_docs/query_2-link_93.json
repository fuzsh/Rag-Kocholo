        "text": "Jim Carrey is a popular personality in the entertainment industry who is recognized for comedic and dramatic film roles. He first gained recognition in 1990 by getting a role in the American television series In Living Color (1990–1994). He went on to try his luck in films as well and successfully dominated the industry with his talent.\n\nAlso Read: Legendary Comedian Jim Carrey Explaining Difference Between Depression and Sadness Has Fans Convinced Life Has Truly Broken Him\n\nJust like his professional life, his personal life was also in widespread media attention. He has had some high-profile relationships and had married two times to Melissa Womer from 1987 to 1995 and Lauren Holly from 1996 to 1997. Though his relationship with Holly did not last long, she had a very hard time from the divorce.\n\nLauren Holly and Jim Carrey’s Marriage Amid The Rumors of Her Being a Homewrecker\n\nAlso Read: 10 Minor Details From Jim Carrey Films That Make Us Say, “Alrighty Then,”\n\nBefore his marriage to actress Lauren Holly, he married former actress and Comedy Store waitress Melissa Womer in March 1987. They share a daughter, Jane Erin Carrey. After being together for eight years, they finally put an end to it and were divorced in 1995.\n\nSoon after his divorce, he was linked with the former however their relationship was rather short-term. The duo first met during a screen test for Carrey’s 1994 film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.\n\nEven though, the test went well she turned down the offer. They soon starred together in 1994’s Dumb and Dumber. With that movie, their names were linked facing various tabloid rumors about them. “They’re always writing about us as ‘on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again,'” she said about that time, “like we’re this flaky Hollywood couple that just breaks up and gets back together all the time.”\n\nOne such rumor was the actress allegedly being the “homewrecker” as many speculated that her relationship with Jim Carrey started when he was with his former wife. It began to surface when the comedian’s first wife accused Holly of being the third wheel in her relationship with the iconic star.\n\n“They kept calling me a homewrecker,” Holly told Rolling Stone in 1995. Though she clarified “they were completely apart when Jim and I met.” It would mean their relationships were not overlapped with one another.\n\nLauren Holly Had a Heartbreaking Experience After Divorcing Her Former Husband Jim Carrey\n\nAlso Read: Best Movies Of Jim Carrey, Ranked\n\nEven though their marriage was a happy one, it ended in a short while. After trying their best to make their relationship work, the Picket Fences star filed for divorce in 1997 citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nReminiscing the past, the actress addressed her divorce in a 2013’s interview on George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight show confessing that she had a rough time going through her separation from the A Christmas Carol star.\n\nShe shared,\n\n“And when we got divorced, I had a really hard time because no one ever really had the story right or anything.”\n\nShe continued to state that she was going through a “heartbreak” however their relationship as per her was affected by the tabloids who wrote things without any proper justification.\n\n“We made our lives… It was all about running away from them and making sure we had privacy,” she told in the interview. Even though she went through a difficult time, she never had ill feelings for her ex-husband.\n\nSource: Youtube"
