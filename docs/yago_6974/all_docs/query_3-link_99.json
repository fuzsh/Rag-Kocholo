        "text": "Jim Carrey has managed to achieve mammoth success with his energetic slapstick performances, alongside numerous controversies. Still, he couldn’t please Oscar-winning actress Emma Stone for whom the Dumb and Dumber star once posted a cringeworthy video. Carrey, who also made headlines for his strange behavior, falling in and out of the public eye, once expressed that he wanted to marry Stone and have kids with her, only if he was younger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim Carrey’s Cringe Proposal For Emma Stone\n\nLa La Land star Emma Stone was marred with a bit of a scandal after the then-50-year-old Jim Carrey posted a cringeworthy love letter video in 2011, expressing his desire to marry the then-23-year-old Stone, and called her “all the way beautiful”.\n\nAlso Read: “But I’m retiring. I’m being fairly serious”: Jim Carrey Declared Permanently Leaving Hollywood But Will Return Under 1 Condition\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe creepily added in the video dedicated to Stone that he wanted to have “chubby little freckle-faced kids” with her, only if he were younger. He also mouthed in the end, “I love you.” The comedian said in the video:\n\nEmma Stone Could Have Just Opted For An Order Of Protection Against Jim Carrey\n\nAfter Jim Carrey’s bizarre video, Emma Stone posted on her YouTube channel, “Should I be flattered or seek an order of protection?” While fans suggested that the then-23-year-old star should really seek an order of protection, Stone expressed a bit of flattery towards Carrey, also expressing her embarrassment over the video.\n\nShe revealed in an interview with New York Magazine: “I was so flattered I can’t even tell you. Honest! I was really flattered, I really was!”, narrating that the video came out when Stone was present at MTV Move Awards, and said:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There were like five of us (including the host, Jason Sudeikis, and we just went on this tangent of talking nice behind Jim Carrey’s back.\n\nJason was talking about how great [Carrey] was when he went to ‘Saturday Night Live’ and how he was just like a comedic genius. Everyone was kind of weighing in, like ‘He’s the best. He’s amazing.”\n\nAfter the weird video went viral, they all kind of talked to each other like: “Weird, that was the guy we were lauding for, like, 30 minutes.’ Have you ever done that?” Emma Stone might have remained confused, but thousands of Twitterers asked one question: “Creepy or hilarious?”\n\nThe worst line from his love letter video remains: “I’m 49. I have lines in my face, gray in my hair, and it takes me a lot longer to pee than it used to.” Nonetheless, Carrey’s video did sound like a parody of one of those creepy dudes.\n\nAlso Read: “Oh, for the love, I can’t even simulate s*x without dying!”: Emma Stone Felt Humiliated After Having an Asthma Attack During an Intimate Scene\n\nAdvertisement"
