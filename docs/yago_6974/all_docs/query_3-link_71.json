She did not appreciate a stable upbringing because, according to many reports, she grew up in a dysfunctional family.\n\nMelissa Womer attended her elementary and high school in New York and she was later enrolled at the University of Kansas. During her college years, she did excellent jobs, such as writing jokes for the morning radio show at Q104 in Kansas City.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Kansas, Melissa went to Hollywood in hopes of making a name for herself.

Later, she had the opportunity to participate in an open mic night at the Comedy store and she really enjoyed her first open mic night.\n\nMelissa has become a favorite character in some comics at the comedy store. The comics, however, encouraged her to transfer her writing skills to the comedy store scene.
