Hers is every TV actresses resume rolled into one.\n\nVancouver is where she shoots Family Law, which returns for a second season Monday, May 22 on Global. The CW just announced that they've acquired the cheeky law drama for their summer season.\n\nWhen she's not stirring things up as family matriarch Joanne Kowalski opposite Jewel Staite and Victor Garber on Family Law, she can be found in Ontario's cottage country. That's where she shoots The Lake, the Prime Video drama returning for a second season June 9.\n\nHolly's credits stretch back to her breakout role opposite Tom Skerritt and Kathy Baker on Picket Fences (1992-96). Several seasons on Chicago Hope and NCIS followed as did features such as \"Dumb and Dumber\" and \"What Women Want.\"\n\nRaised in upstate New York, Holly married not one but two Canadians, moved to Canada, became a Canadian citizen and has three Canadian sons. Does this not qualify her for the Order of Canada? Or at least a discount at Tim Horton's?\n\nHear her on the importance of acting on happy sets on this episode of brioux.tv: the podcast."
