        "text": "Mary Margaret Swanson was a rich woman from Aspen. She is the tritagonist of the 1994 film Dumb and Dumber. She was played by actress Lauren Holly.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nMary is beautiful, attractive caucasian woman. She has bob-length red hair and blue eyes. She wears a dark purple long-sleeved shirt and a black skirt and pantyhose and black high-heels.\n\nHistory[]\n\nAt some unknown point, Mary's husband Bobby, was kidnapped & held for ransom.\n\nIn 1994, Mary followed the kidnappers orders & left a briefcase full of cash at an airport in Rhode Island before flying back to Aspen. However, Lloyd Christmas, who had fallen in love with her, got his hands on the briefcase and tried to return it to her.\n\nLater, Lloyd and Harry Dunne arrived in Aspen, with the briefcase, but they spend all the money. The kidnapper discovered the briefcase was empty, but then were apprehended by Harry and a group of FBI agents & Mary was reunited with her husband.\n\nIn Lloyd's Dream[]\n\nMary appeared in Lloyd's dream. In the dream Lloyd redelivered the briefcase to Mary, who embraced him. Mary was then sat with a group of people who all laughed at Lloyd’s jokes. Lloyd took Mary to a restaurant & when she was sexually harassed by a waiter, Lloyd attacked the offender knocking him & several others cold, & even ripping out the chef’s heart. He & Mary were seen kissing & Mary even stripped to nothing, but the dream ended there.\n\nDumb and Dumber To[]\n\nMary does not appear in Dumb and Dumber To, but she was mentioned at the beginning by Harry. Lloyd had spent 20 years pretending to be handicapped due to being traumatized about not getting married to Mary. This was all just to pull a prank on his best friend. It is not known what had happened to Mary over those 20 years, but it's possible that she was still married to Bobby, or had lost contact with Harry and Lloyd.\n\nBehind the Scenes[]\n\nWhen casting the role, The Farrelly Brothers wanted an actress that was not only beautiful but who had tremendous chemistry with both Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. At the suggestion from her then friend (and future husband) Carrey, Lauren Holly auditioned and successfully won the part. Holly was primarily known for television and had previously auditioned for the role of Melissa Robinson in Carrey’s feature film debut, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.\n\nThe Farrelly’s felt she brought a great sense of earnestness and honesty to the part, and that perfectly blended with the screwball humor from Carrey and Daniels.\n\nHolly was very briefly approached about appearing in the sequel, Dumb and Dumber To. There was hesitation on reaching out to her due to the failed marriage between her and Carrey and the Farrelly’s worried it would be uncomfortable for both parties. However, Carrey was open to the idea, as he and Holly had made amends.\n\nHowever, the discussions never went beyond a couple conversations as the scripting did not accommodate her character. Holly has since stated that she was relieved it worked out as such, as she felt the first film was best left on its own and a sequel, no matter how funny, wasn’t going to measure up to it.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nDumb and Dumber\n\nDumb and Dumber To (mentioned)\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]"
