        "text": "Lauren Holly is a successful actor, best known for her role as Director Jenny Shepard in the crime drama \"NCIS,\" in addition to parts in popular films, including \"Dumb and Dumber,\" \"What Women Want,\" and \"The Final Storm.\" More recently, she landed roles in the political thriller \"Designated Survivor\" and the dance drama \"Tiny Pretty Things.\" Her role as Madame Monique Dubois in \"Tiny Pretty Things\" was transformational, which she opened up about to New Beauty at the end of 2020. For starters, Holly passed through extensive training to perfect her movements. \"I had to do the finer things like learn to walk and move like a dancer,\" she said. The role also changed her perception of beauty, making her \"realize that beauty really does come from within.\"\n\nThe \"Picket Fences\" star's career has not been without its ups and downs. In the early 2000s, she left the entertainment industry to raise her three sons, Azer, George, and Henry. In an episode of \"Oprah: Where Are They Now?,\" she said that at the time, she was \"worried about taking a break and then trying to go back into acting.\" However, raising her kids when they were still young was important to her. Fortunately, once she started working again, she was \"busier\" than ever. Since then, she has been able to balance the demands of her career with those of being a mother.\n\nWhile building her incredible career, Holly also went through a number of heartbreaks, getting married and divorced multiple times.\n\nLauren Holly has been married and divorced three times. Her first husband was fellow actor Danny Quinn. The duo shared a short marriage of two years, beginning in 1991 and ending in 1993. While not much was known about the reason for their divorce at the time, the \"Judas\" actor later confessed to abusing Holly. During his father, Anthony Quinn's, divorce trial, Danny stated that he and Holly \"had a dysfunctional relationship\" and that he \"would turn violent,\" punching, hitting, and grabbing her, as per The Spokesman Review. He attributed his behavior to having watched his father treat his mother the same way.\n\nThe \"NCIS\" star's second husband was comedian and actor Jim Carrey, whom she met on the set of \"Dumb and Dumber.\" This was yet another short marriage, beating out the record for her first by more than a year — the pair were married for a mere 10 months before Holly filed for divorce in 1997, citing \"irreconcilable differences,\" according to Deseret News. Despite the short-lived marriage, Holly said on \"George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight\" in 2013 that she \"had a really hard time\" following the divorce.\n\nWhile for many, the third time's the charm, this would not be the case for the \"Christmas Catch\" actor. However, her third marriage was her longest. She married investment banker Francis Greco in 2001 and they stayed together until 2014, as per Glamour Path. During their marriage, they adopted three boys, Azer, George, and Henry.\n\nIf you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233. You can also find more information, resources, and support at their website.\n\nAlthough Lauren Holly has reportedly dated a couple times since getting divorced from Francis Greco, she is not looking to get married again, she told Closer Weekly in 2019. However, she has learned a very important life lesson from her marriages: to make sure \"you share a sense of humor.\" She also comes away from her third marriage with three forever loves: her sons, Azer, George, and Henry. She told Closer Weekly that she always knew she wanted to adopt when it became time for her to grow her family. She said specifically of her boys, \"I felt like we were supposed to meet, like we chose each other.\" And despite not growing up living in the same house as their father, which has been Holly's \"biggest hurdle,\" she feels they have all grown into \"super-responsible, good kids.\"\n\nThe \"Designated Survivor\" star's eldest son, Azer, has followed in his mother's footsteps and starred in several films, including \"Just Go With It\" and \"Too Late to Say Goodbye,\" as per IMDb. While George and Henry have not shared the same passion for acting, Holly is proud of all three of her boys nonetheless. She frequently takes to Instagram to post photos and videos of them. In a recent post from December 2021, the actor showed off a tattoo she got in honor of her sons, which consists of three crowns lined up on her arm to symbolize her \"three kings.\""
