I think she's lovely.\"\n\nHoward then wondered if Jim felt like Renée was \"the one that got away,\" in a sense.\n\n\"I don't regret. I don't have those things, but I do appreciate the people that have come through my life for the good that they gave me.\"\n\nJim went on to say, \"But I don't pine for anybody. It's not that kind of situation. It's just my way of saying there was a very important thing there and to recognize that.\"\n\nIt's always sweet to hear people reflect on the people who impacted their life, even if their friendships or relationships didn't last.\n\nTo hear more, be sure to watch the full clip from Jim's interview on The Howard Stern Show.\n\nShare This Article"
