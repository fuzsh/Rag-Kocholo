        "text": "Question: I was wondering what the status was of the Jim Carrey-Lauren Holly marriage. I was a Lauren Holly fan when she was on All My Children and later on Picket Fences. I also liked my fellow Canadian, Carrey, when he was on In Living Color, but I'm no fan of his movies.\n\nAnswer: Lauren, who met Jim when the couple filmed Dumb and Dumber in 1994, has filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. Wags in Hollywood say she is easing her disappointment in the comforting presence of Ed Burns, the director of her new film, Long Time, Nothing New.\n\nNot only did a lot of folks predict that the marriage would not set a record for longevity, many wondered how it could have happened in the first place. It's interesting that Jim's first marriage, which produced a child, seemed to be a happy one until he struck it big with his first starring feature film. He almost immediately filed for divorce and, some say he even tried to have his lawyers work out a way so that he wouldn't have to share his multimillion-dollar film fee with his soon-to-be former wife. California is a community property state, which means that, unless previously agreed to, the couple shares all assets earned during the marriage.\n\n_ Times wires"
