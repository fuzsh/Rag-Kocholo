        "text": "Los Angeles: It seems that actor Jim Carrey had his share of matrimony. The 52-year-old says now he doesn't want to \"voluntarily\" go the marriage way.\n\nHe appeared on the \"Howard Stern Show\" where he spoke about love and relationships, reports eonline.com.\n\nAsked if he would ever consider marriage again, Carrey said: \"I just don't see it as necessary at this point. Is it really sacred? I don't know.\"\n\nCarrey was previously married to actresses Lauren Holly and Melissa Womer.\n\nThe actor says that having relationships is still important and he still appreciates a great woman.\n\n\"If you hook up with someone who is famous, you become a sellable commodity and that's the most important thing in those magazines. It's not what you're doing in the movie. It's who you are with, what are you doing, are you breaking up?\" he said.\n\nAsked if the perfect girl came along, would he ever consider marriage, Carrey said: \"I can't say that I know how I would feel if I meet somebody that knocks my head off. I can't make hard fast rules about the future, but I wouldn't voluntarily go that way.\""
