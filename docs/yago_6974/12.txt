The way we figure it, Jim Carrey divorced his first wife, Melissa (see the file offered elsewhere in our catalogue) to marry Lauren Holly (infinitely cute in DUMB AND DUMBER) only to have that union dissolve after just nine months. At least Ms. Holly didn't take poor Jim to the cleaners the way his first wife did. This 17 page file includes all the usual stuff, with a bunch of good signatures.
