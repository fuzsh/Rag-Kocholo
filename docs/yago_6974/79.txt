Actor Lauren Holly sits down with George - she's a living, breathing embodiment of how TV's changed over the past 25 years. She got her start on 'All My Children', spent three seasons on the incredibly popular 'NCIS', and now she's back on the screen in 'Motive'. And somewhere in there she starred in 'Dumb and Dumber' - and was married to co-star Jim Carrey for a couple of years.
