Leipzig Commemorative Flag.

The black lion with red claws and tongue depicted on the coat of arms of Leipzig symbolizes the Margravate of Meissen. The city was part of this margravate in the Middle Ages. Next to the lion are the blue Landsberg pillars, which have become the heraldic symbol of many Saxon principalities.

Key Features oF Leipzig:

Leipzig, like her sister ship – researchable cruiser Nürnberg – is armed with nine 150mm main battery guns and four triple torpedo tubes and is equipped with HE shells that have high armour penetration capabilities and AP shells with high damage. She has good concealment and the trademark German Hydroacoustic Search consumable. However, she has weak armour and AA weapons, as well as a slow main battery turret traverse speed.

Unlike Nürnberg, Leipzig's gameplay is weighted toward torpedo attacks, as her torpedoes have a high range. Because of this, as well as her good concealment, the ship can attack targets with torpedoes from a comfortable range while remaining undetected.

Leipzig Info:

Ship Name: VI Leipzig

Tier: 6

Class: Leipzig-class cruiser

WG introduction: August 2, 2022

Base value 5 500 doubloons

Nation: Germany

Current development status: Released

Dockyard Details

The Dockyard itself will be broken into 20 phases. As always, you can complete combat missions that will award you with Dockyard phases. However, you will need to obtain 2 phases outside of these combat missions. The great news is that similar to the Wisconsin Dockyard, players will have the opportunity to complete this Dockyard without buying additional phases! VI Leipzig will be offered at phase 11 as an intermediate reward, and those captains who were lucky enough to obtain her already will be awarded 2 phases after reaching her assigned phase. Who doesn't love a free ship?!

Additionally, each phase can be purchased for 2,000 Doubloons. There will also be starter packs available for 3,000 Doubloons (which includes 2 phases) and 8,000 Doubloons (which includes 7 phases) for those who want to jumpstart their progression. These packs will only be available until you achieve 5 phases through combat missions, so be warned! Regardless of how you get there, the final reward for this event is the IX Almirante Oquendo with the special War Paint permanent camouflage and the Almirante Oquendo flag.

This Dockyard event will last until the start of Update 13.10, with combat missions available until the end of Update 13.8. Once 13.9 rolls around, you will only be able to progress the Dockyard by purchasing phases for Doubloons, so make sure you get cracking as soon as the event rolls around!
