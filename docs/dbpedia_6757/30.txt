The Old Stock Exchange on Naschmarkt is Leipzig’s oldest baroque building. It was constructed by Leipzig merchants in 1678 and was used as a prestigious place of assembly for 200 years. Transactions were concluded, auctions were held and bills of exchange were traded here. One striking feature is its symmetrical design. The centrepiece of its splendidly decorated façade is the coat of arms of the City of Leipzig.

During World War II, the Old Stock Exchange was damaged and lost its stucco ceiling. After the war it was rebuilt. Today the Old Stock Exchange is used for concerts, readings, theatre performances, lectures and conferences as well as private and public functions.
