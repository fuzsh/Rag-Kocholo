        "text": "Protected Site-01, Overwatch HQ\n\nI wanted this to be very simple and location nonspecific. I got the Triangles from EstrellaYoshte's Overwatch Command logo, I added the \"OVERWATCH\" text to fill space.\n\nHumanoid Containment Site-06-3, Loraine, France\n\nObviously inspired by the Flag of France, but the three little birds are from the Flag of Lorraine, to make the logo a little more specific to that location. My personal headcanon is that it's disguised as a prison, I'll go into detail if I get around to writing about it.\n\nSite-11, Lansing, Michigan\n\nBased on the Seal of Michigan, very much inspired by the Logos HarryBlank did for Site-11 and Site-19, but with the addition of Lances, inspired by the Canting arms of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing. (Lansing, Lance-ing, get it?)\n\nSite-12, Devon, England\n\nBased on the Flag of Devon, with a book overlaid to represent its purpose as an archive and library for the History Department.\n\nProtected Site-14, Sacramento, California\n\nBased on Agente Shuffle's logo for the Telecommunications Monitoring Office, with the white background with a red band at the bottom inspired by the Flag of California.\n\nSite-15, Silicon Valley, California\n\nColors and central star taken from the Flag of Santa Clara County, California with the addition of the Infotech Department logo.\n\nSite-17, Undisclosed Location\n\nInspired by the Site-17 Deepwell logo.\n\nSite-18, Undisclosed Location\n\nI liked the idea of Site-18 literally being halfway between 17 and 19, the design reflects that.\n\nSite-19, Undisclosed Location\n\nObviously based on my Site-17 logo, but I do like the sickly green - it's meant to seem Safe, but to me it seems very cold and institutional, which I like.\n\nStorage Site-23, Undisclosed Location\n\nRefined this one over time - it's a storage Site in an unknown location, so it's a box, but the box contains a biohazard due to that being one of the focuses of the Site. The color scheme implies that it's in the USA, I suppose.\n\nSite-28, Manhattan, New York\n\nBased on the Flag of New York City, incorporating the logo of the Department of Artistic Anomalies, since the site focuses on art.\n\nSite-34, Spanish Branch\n\nSlight edit of a design HarryBlank already did, based on the Flag of the Hispanic People. I was told on the Spanish Discord that the tilde above the number improved it, the letter ñ is a distinctive feature of the Spanish language.\n\nSite-36, India\n\nBased on the Flag of India - Harry Blank did something very similar but I like the addition of the Ashoka Chakra, since the Site has a focus on theological anomalies. In my head the Foundation obviously has many other facilities in India, but I think most of those could use designs from the flags and heraldry of specific regions.\n\nSite-38, Tennessee\n\nBased on the Flag of Tennessee, one of the top-tier US state flags.\n\nSite-41, Colorado\n\nBased on of the Flag of Colorado combined with the EstrellaYoshte's Antimemetics Division logo - I think it works pretty well!\n\nSite-42, North Carolina\n\nSite-42 from the Broken Masquerade Canon has quite a detailed description, so I wanted to make a logo based on the Flag of North Carolina.\n\nSite-44, Foulness, Essex, England\n\nBased on the Flag of Essex, but with a green background and a circular arrangement to reflect its location and former designation as Site Green. I'm very pleased that OzzyLizard liked it enough to use it in the Site-44 Secure Facility Dossier.\n\nSite-45, Australia\n\nThis is based on the Flag of Australia, but I've adjusted the position of the stars in the Southern Cross to make it more recognisable.\n\nSite-45, ㄗitch 卄aven, Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nThe first one I showed to an author, thanks for being so enthusiastic Fantem, and putting it on the ㄗitch 卄aven Hub. It's inspired by the monochrome artwork of SunnyClockwork on the hub.\n\nSite-50, Tokyo, Japan\n\nBased on the Metropolitan Crest of Tokyo, with an edit to the direction of the rays to make it more SCP themed.\n\nSite-54, Leipzig, Saxony, Germany\n\nCombining the Flags of Leipzig, Saxony, and Germany. German approved (thanks Allnyta)! I'm not 100% sure on this one since it's a little too colorful, but in this case the principle of \"use meaningful symbolism\" overrides the principle of \"use 2-3 colors\".\n\nSite-55, Boston, Massachusetts\n\nHarry Blank did something similar already but I remade it, I wanted something a bit more colourful. This version combines the Flag of Boston and the Flag of Massachusetts.\n\nSite-56, Nevada\n\nI wanted something that represented the aesthetic of the Trashfire Canon, something dark and sinister, and since \"The Kraken Protocol\" is part of Site-56's history, I found my way to a heraldry website.\n\nAnomalous Relations Site-58, Nanticoke, Philadelphia\n\nBased on an original design by OriTiefling, but the Progress Pride Flag is CC-NC and so I redesigned it - it's actually based on the original public domain 8-Stripe Pride Flag, because we wanted to get the pink and cyan from the Transgender flag in there.\n\nDimensional Site-62, SCP-004\n\nThis one is pretty basic, there's not really anything really distinctive about this Site beyond it being inside SCP-004 so it was a hard one to work on. Went with a purple padlock, I tried making it a few different colors but I didn't really like any of them.\n\nStorage Site-64, Portland, Oregon\n\nThe first one is based on the Flag of Portland, I wanted something that works well at a very small size.\n\nSite-64, Portland, Oregon\n\nI do like the Flag of Oregon so I used that to make a more detailed version with a couple of Those Twisted Pines (from here) and a Rose to represent Portland.\n\nSite-65, Saskatchewan\n\nWelcome to Wonderful Site-65 is very entertaining, I wanted to do something based on the Flag of Saskatchewan, although I deleted a lot of details from the flower to make it look better at a smaller size.\n\nBiological Containment Site-66, Undisclosed Location\n\nInspired by SCP-1479, trees are from the Pine Tree Flag.\n\nSite-73, Texas\n\nBased on the Flag of Texas.\n\nReliquary Site-76\n\nHistoric, American, couldn't really think of anything other than this for than the Betsy Ross Flag of the United States. This is a Site I ended up expanding on when writing up the description of it for the new Facilities page, it was lacking anything distinctive.\n\nSite-77, Abruzzo, Italy\n\nBased on the Flag of Italy and the Coat of Arms of Abruzzo.\n\nSite-79, Yumegemu, Japan\n\nObviously based on the Flag of Japan, but since Yumegemu is a Nexus themed around video games I went with a pixelated version of the red circle. Every time I see this, I hear the faint sound of an 8-bit soundtrack…\n\nSite-81, Indiana\n\nThis design is a modification of the Flag of Indiana, I basically deleted everything except the stars in order to simplify the design - the number covered up the torch anyway so there was no point in keeping it.\n\nSite-83, New Jersey\n\nBased on the Flag of New Jersey.\n\nSite-84, Alice Springs, Norther Territory, Australia\n\nBased on the Flag of the Northern Territory.\n\nSite-88, Alabama\n\nBased off the Flag of Alabama, but I felt it was lacking something so I added a Yellow Hammer. I'm aware that Alabama Yellowhammers are actually as type of bird, but visual puns actually have a long tradition in heraldry, and I like the way this design looks.\n\nSite-91, Hecatoncheires Cycle, Yorkshire, England\n\nBased of the flag of Yorkshire, incorporating the hands from the logo on the Hecatoncheires Cycle Hub. I previously lived in the north of England, so this is one of my favourite designs.\n\nSite-98, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nBased of the Flag of Philadelphia, with the Department of Sciences logo by EstrellaYoshte.\n\nBio-Site-103, Undisclosed Location\n\nI wanted a flower, the exact colour (peach) was inspired by SCP-757. It originally had 5 petals but threefold symetry looks so much better with this template.\n\nBio-Site-104, Undisclosed Location\n\nThe dead tree is more heraldry, and is intended to be a depiction of SCP-628.\n\nSite-118, Sonora Desert, Arizona\n\nBased on the the Flag of Arizona, with a labyrinth below to indicate the site is subterranean and concealed.\n\nSite-119, Mound City, Kansas\n\nSame design as the Site-15 logo, but in the colors of the Flag of Kansas.\n\nSite-120, From 120's Archives, Silesian Voivodeship, Poland\n\nBased on the Flag of Poland, with the addition of the Ontokinetics logo in 120 brown.\n\nSite-184, Nova Scotia, Canada\n\nThe background of the Flag of Nova Scotia, defaced (technical term) with a big red anchor. I'm very pleased that DodoDevil liked it enough to use it in the Site-184 Secure Facility Dossier.\n\nSite-201, Ontario, Canada\n\nBased on the Arms of Ontario, with the inclusion of Lake Ontario and a stylised depiction of the Arete Dimensional Array.\n\nSite-228, Hungary\n\nSince we only have one Site in Hungary, I just used the Flag of Hungary.\n\nSite-234, Alabama\n\nThe biohazard symbol for this biological research facility looks great and is very appropriate, plus using the Alabama colors makes it look like very medical.\n\nSite-322, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nBased of the Flag of Philadelphia.\n\nSite-333, Atlantic City, New Jersey\n\nBased of the Seal of Atlantic City, which features the lighthouse, boardwalk and some very ugly fish. This would actually be quite a stylish design without the fish, which is why I included them!\n\nResource Site-400, Newcastle, Northern Ireland\n\nBased of the flag of Northern Ireland, the Red Hand feels fitting for a site that contains a lot of humanoids, and the arrows at the bottom are stylised pine trees based on the site's location in the forest.\n\nSite-666, Undervegas, Las Vegas\n\nBased of the Flag of Las Vegas with elements from the image from SCP-4661.\n\nSite-θ, Yellowstone National Park\n\nThere's a bit of inconsistency over whether the SCP-2000 facility should be Site-2000 or Site-θ, but I went with theta as the more unique option. The colors are inspired by the memetic kill agent, the overlaid symbol is the ACS Thaumiel symbol, in Yellow to represent the Site's location."
