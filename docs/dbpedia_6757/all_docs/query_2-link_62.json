        "text": "There are basically three main areas of scrutiny when you design a coat of arms. Family name, geographical provenance of your family and professional occupations prevalent in your family. With my family name being „Kalter“, let´s work our way backwards from the latter.\n\nAs there are a number of families in Germany calling themselves „Kalter“, my particular family´s branch originates from the Rhine-Mosel Rivers wine-producing area. Historically, my forebears worked in agrarian professions up to the late 19th century. After that, things get blurry, which means that basically every generation since worked in quite different professions. So, there´s no real lineage of similar jobs to draw on to define charges for a coat of arms.\n\nMy family, at least as the references have it so far, originates from the small settlement of Arzheim near Coblenz, which has since become part of that city. Coblenz is situated at the confluence of the rivers Rhine and Mosel. Not only because of this geographical localisation, but also because my father´s mother´s roots are in the Mosel region, it´s obvious to choose the two rivers as geographical coordinates for the coat of arms. However, a large number of coats of arms denote rivers by using „horizontal wavy lines“, which I found excessively boring. Instead, I decided to use a spiraling snail shell. In the design above this gives you a golden and a green spiral wave interlocking, thus denoting not only the two rivers but also a notion of family togetherness and joint evolution. Also, the Spiral is a symbol found almost everywhere. For me, it is really the symbol of symbols, the ultimate code signifying life and, possibly, evolvement. It is the DNA Helix as well as the Triskelion of Megalithic times.\n\nThe name „Kalter“ derives from the German word „keltern“, which means making wine, or, more correctly, harvesting, and especially pressing and storing wine. Professor Jürgen Udolph from Leipzig University did an expert assessment of my family´s name ( www.prof-udolph.com ). He confirmed the family name´s linguistic roots as well as the provenance from the Rhine-Mosel-Region. Thus, the bunch of grapes in the foreground at the shield´s base forms the symbolical bedrock of the coat of arms. Also, with the grapes being „counterchanged“ Or-Vert, they symbolically merge with the two rivers and echo the two colours of white wine and its foliage, which this region is particularly known for, during the year´s seasons. Please also note the spiral tendril at the grapes´ stem, which chimes in with the fluvial spiral metaphor.\n\nThrough time, my family has always looked beyond the daily chores towards general values. The Catholic Creed has played a very important role for the majority of my family´s existence in this regard. Beyond the three coat of arms definitions mentioned above, there´s a fourth possibility of charging, which is finding a symbol for a family´s common value- or self-defining-system. As a consequence, I had to incorporate a christian symbol into the design. Of course, the array of christian symbols is vast, but I wanted to find something not quite as blatant as a cross or lamb or dove. The Pilgrim´s Shell or Scallop is not only a symbol strongly employed in heraldry, but also signifies striving for an ideal through daily small paces. I felt that this would resonate with my ancestors´ beliefs quite well, especially with the values of modesty and industry.\n\nHowever, I have to admit that this particular choice has a somewhat mischievous ambiguity on my part as well. The Latin word for pilgrim is „peregrinus“, and this relates quite nicely to the English „Peregrine“, which I use as a central part of my pseudonym. If you visualise this symbolical journey through the shield starting from the sinister birth of the golden spiral moving clockwise, you have a very bold quasi-calligraphical volte-face through the Kalters´ family history towards a „Peregrine“ endpoint, which is, admittedly, slightly self-referential, and purely my very own personal shortcoming.\n\nCoats of arms, after all, are warriors´ logos historically. As the shield shows a relatively benign arrangement, I wanted something more aggressive for the crest. I toyed with various ideas, especially trying to incorporate some possible Kalter symbology, but wasn´t convinced by any of the ideas I had. To keep it simple and expressive, I chose the pointed bull´s horns, which by their curving nature echo the two rivers. Also, they have a golden inlay of irregular river- or snake-like lines curving upwards around the horns. I´m very fond of some works by Andy Goldsworthy and used this imagery to reflect the river and wine tendril movements from the shield. Also, all of these movements are watery in nature and thus make a natural habitat for the shell …\n\nThe motto is a short sequence taken from the Song of Solomon. As such, „Ad Montem Myrrhae“ aspires to higher ideals, but at the same time refers to love, which should be at the centre of every family. Also, it might have a slightly erotic undercurrent, which has nothing to do with family but everything with chivalry (or Kate Bush, coming to think of it). Quae est ista quae progreditur quasi aurora consurgens pulchra ut luna electa ut sol terribilis ut acies ordinata ?\n\nHere´s the blazon:\n\nArms: Per fess voluted Vert and Or, in sinister chief an Escallop inverted Or and at nombril point a bunch of Grapes tendriled, all counterchanged.\n\nCrest: Issuant from a Helm wreathed and mantled Vert doubled Or, a pair of pointed Bulls´ Horns Vert, each circled by a ribbon serpentined Or.\n\nMotto: \"Ad Montem Myrrhae\"\n\nBadges:\n\nMarkus Kalter / Grapehorn: A bunch of grapes proper Vert, bull-horned Or.\n\nMarkus Kalter / Morgan Jocelyn Osmélian Peregrine of Wolfin: On a Wine Leaf Vert stemmed and tendriled Or, in dexter a Wolf´s Head and in sinister a Peregrine Falcon´s Head contourné, both couped, both Or.\n\nAnd in German:\n\nWappenschild: Mit Schnecke geteilt von Grün und Gold, unten eine Traube am Rebholz mit Ranke in verwechselten Farben, links oben eine gestürzte goldene Muschel.\n\nOberwappen: Auf dem Helm mit grün-goldenem Wulst und grün-goldenen Helmdecken zwei spitze grüne Büffelhörner, umwunden von je einem goldenen Band."
