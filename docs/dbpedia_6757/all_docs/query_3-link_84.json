        "text": "Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund were the first two Bundesliga teams to unveil their new jerseys for the upcoming 2023/24 season. Check out all the latest kits as they're released and find out how to get your hands on one yourself.\n\nBayern Munich\n\nThe record champions have gone back to 1965 and the year of their promotion to the Bundesliga with their newest design, which features a white base with red sleeves. The phrase \"Rot & Weiß Leben lang\" (red & white for life) features on the collar alongside the club motto of \"Mia san mia\". As has become tradition in recent years, the Munich club debuted their new home strip in their final game of the season at the Allianz Arena, when they took on RB Leipzig on Matchday 33.\n\nBayern's away kit features a world map-inspired graphic with pink and green diamonds, representing their fan clubs around the globe.\n\nYou can buy Bayern's new home jersey right here at the official club shop!\n\nBorussia Dortmund\n\nDortmund turned to their fans to determine the style of their 2023/24 kits, with the design by Timo R. from Marl the overwhelming winner in voting. It features the club's traditional colours of black and yellow, with a silhouette of the Signal Iduna Park and steel structure a reminder of the region's industrial roots.\n\nOnce on sale from 26 May, you can buy Dortmund's new home jersey right here at the official club shop!\n\nRB Leipzig\n\nLeipzig were the first team to unveil their new away threads for the coming season, debuting their red and blue zig-zag number as they beat Bayern in Munich for the first time ever on Matchday 33. They then released their new home kit, which is based on the design of the 2018/19 strip. It features a white base with red arrows on the sleeves and shoulders to reflect the club's colours.
