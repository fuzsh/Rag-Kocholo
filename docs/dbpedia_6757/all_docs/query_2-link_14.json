        "text": "The Markets of Leipzig mini expansion contains 4 double-sized tiles that will replace the start tile. They represent different quarters of the city of Leipzig. These tiles allow you to send meeples on roads to Leipzig in order to receive bonus points according to the chosen quarter.\n\nOriginally released by Hans im Glück in the 2nd edition (C2 for short) in 2017 on occasion of Leipzig's fair \"model-hobby-spiel\" 2017, with two double tiles for Amazonas: Amazon Bonus River Tiles. A version in the 3rd edition (C3 for short) was released in 2023.\n\nThis expansion doesn't exist for the 1st edition (C1 for short), and presents some limitations if played with this edition.\n\nThis expansion was first released as a limited edition of total 600 examples: the first 300 at the \"modell hobby spiel\" in Leipzig from 29th September to 1st October 2017, and the second 300 at the Spiel'17 in Essen from 26th to 29th of October 2017. This limited version was signed by Klaus-Jürgen Wrede and the CEO of Leipzig's trade fair center (Messe Leipzig) and contained 13 meeples.\n\nThe Leipzig trade fair, which provides its logo as the symbol for this expansion, has its origins in the Middle Ages.\n\nThis expansion presents some rules changes between C2 and C3:\n\nThe number of meeples recommended to add to the game when playing with this expansion.\n\nThe scoring of the long road segments features on the Leipzig tiles.\n\nContents\n\n4 double land tiles with the city of Leipzig, to be used as an alternative start tile\n\n13 additional meeples in different colors in some versions [1]\n\nRules\n\nPreparation\n\nThis setup replaces the start tile. Place the land tiles in a way that the four quarters lie next to each other and form the city of Leipzig (lat. Lipsia). Rightly, the signpost for Francofortum points to the west, the one for Stettinum to the north, Vratislavia to the east and Roma to the south. For the game, however, it is not important in which order the tiles are placed. [2]\n\nIf possible, give extra meeples to each player as meeples might run low easily in this variant. The number recommended varies depending on the edition:\n\nC3: 2 extra meeples\n\nC2: 1 extra meeple\n\nGameplay\n\nOther expansions\n\nThis section contains additional information about the interactions with other Carcassonne expansions.\n\nTile distribution\n\nThird edition C3\n\nTotal tiles: 4\n\nSeveral tiles have a small illustration on them. The letters in brackets show which illustration is on each tile:\n\nSecond edition C2\n\nTotal tiles: 4\n\nSeveral tiles have a small illustration on them. The letters in brackets show which illustration is on each tile:"
