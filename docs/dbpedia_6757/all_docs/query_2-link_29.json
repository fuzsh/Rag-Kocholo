        "text": "Coat of Arms is Sabaton's fifth studio album. It was released on 21st May 2010.\n\nInformation[]\n\nThis is the band's first album released on Nuclear Blast label.\n\nThe album was teased for the first time on 20th November 2009 with the words \"See you all in 2010 under the Coat of Arms!\", when Sabaton announced their signing to Nuclear Blast.[1]\n\n\"Coat of Arms\" was officialy announced on 23rd December, 2009. The band posted the artwork, title and a pre-production snippet of the title track on their homepage and Facebook page.[2]\n\nJoakim said that Nuclear Blast didn't have any effect regarding their work on the album.[3]\n\nThe band didn't have time to make another album so quickly than before because of the extensive touring for The Art of War.[4]\n\nPär had the the artwork and the title in his head, he did a quick drawing of a sample artwork. The band agreed to the idea, then sent it to Jobert Mello of Sledgehammergraphix to do a proper artwork.[5]\n\nThe bird on the cover of the album is a phoenix bird, but it was based on the Polish Eagle.[6]\n\nThe title of the album was inspired by the history of Polish coat of arms the band received during their concert in Wizna from Władysław Stasiak, the Chief of the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland.[7]\n\nAll the lyrics on the album focus on World War II, except for Metal Ripper, which continued the heavy metal themes just like Metal Machine from Primo Victoria and Metal Crüe from Attero Dominatus did.\n\nThe band decided to include instrumental versions of some songs as bonus tracks, because it would be fun to see people singing their songs, after seeing multiple videos of instrument covers.[8]\n\nIt was Sabaton's first album to achieve gold certification (2011). It sold over 10 000 copies in Poland.[9]\n\nBy the end of 2017, various retailers added \"Coat of Arms (Re-Recorded)\" to their catalogues, along with a new album cover. The initial release was scheduled on 23rd February 2018, but the date's been pushed back several times and it wasn't released. Current status is unknown. However, in one of the interviews in 2019, Pär said:\n\n\"We haven’t re-recorded Coat of Arms. We have done some changes, but we’re not quite happy with the result so we don’t know if it will lead to something yet. But there were a couple of rumors that we had re-made it. At the moment we’re not quite there at least!\"[10]\n\nBackground[]\n\nJoakim: \"In the beginning, especially when we were writing the album and composing it, we didn't want anybody to be disappointed, especially the fans. I mean, if somebody doesn't like Sabaton already, I don't care about it, but if a Sabatons' fan is disappointed, I won't be happy at all! (Laughs). But once we started to record the album, and everything was done, then we said \"that's a good album, so let's do it!\".\"[11]\n\nJoakim: \"(...) While I'm starting writing, I don't think about anything but doing a good melodic line and full of emotions. But once I'm in the middle of the song and get myself in all that work, I usually get pictures already how it's gonna look or sound in a live show.\"[12]\n\nJoakim: \"Working on it is quite different from before, because for the first time we are not pressured with deadlines and various stressful schedules, where you often have to hang out for 12 hours in the studio...\"[13]\n\nJoakim: \"More grandiose sounding than The Art of War, oh yes! Our new stuff will sound even more epic and bombastic. Or at least that first piece, haha! I also worked with a lot of choral vocals - as is the case with Ghost Division, where choirs are not only in choruses but also in verse. Which, on the other hand, requires a lot of thought and structuring of the track. We used to crack a song and say: Hmm, let's add some harmony here and there! while now all of these things are clear from the beginning. And when we go to the studio, 90 percent of the song will be ready. Most of all, we change some solos and so on.\"'[14]\n\nJoakim: \"(...) with the last two albums I was sometimes really panicky about songwriting. I just want every song to be the best I've ever written. And that can get tough sometimes. I fight most at the beginning of the songwriting phase. I have a lot of ideas because I always humming ideas into my iPhone while on the go, but putting them together to form conclusive songs that are not just copies of other titles that either I or someone else has made before is hell in the first few weeks. I constantly switch between \"hey, that's good\" and \"No, it's too similar to what I've already done.\" With every album there is the moment when I almost finish this one song, when I get the adrenaline rush - just from the idea of ​​playing it. When this point is reached, things usually go much better. When the mental blockade is overcome, things really go up. Here it was with the song \"Coat of Arms\", when all the choirs and harmonies were ready, I thought: \"It's not that hard, you can still do it\". On the previous album it was \"Ghost Division\".\"[15]\n\nJoakim: \"(...) I'm always writing and I'm always looking for new ideas. It became really serious with \"Coat of Arms\" shortly after the \"The Art of War\" tour in December 2008.\"[16]\n\nJoakim: \"(...) we mainly worked on the composition of this disc during our moments of rest, at home. It all started in December 2008 and then in January of the following year, we recorded the drum parts at Abyss studios (Sweden). Subsequently, we recovered the recordings to work on the compositions in our own studio. Then the guitars, bass and vocal parts were set up in a studio in Leipzig (Germany). Generally, when you enter the studio, 90% of the songs are already in place. Little room is left for improvisation. There is therefore very little chance that we will be able to make 130 takes of a guitar parts (laughs).\"[17]\n\nPär: \"Part of the material that appeared on \"Coat of Arms\" was written a few years ago. In addition, we had a lot of ideas for new songs. The very process of their writing took place before the UK tour and after returning from it. During Christmas, we worked hard to make sure the songs were ready before the new year (2010). We entered the studio on January 2 2010, where we spent five weeks recording new compositions. Then we worked on the lyrics for the new album.\"'[18]\n\nJoakim: \"Compared to \"The Art of War\", I would say that this record is more direct and melodic than the previous one. There are also a lot of fast songs. We go back a bit to the roots of Sabaton. There are no dark atmospheres as was the case in the previous opus.\" [19]\n\nPär: \"I think it will be a bit faster and heavier then for example Art of War.\"[20]\n\nJoakim: \"The album is not only a cross-section of our previous work, but goes a little bit further. In terms of composition, it has a lot in common with \"Metalizer\", but also with newer albums like \"Primo Victoria\" and \"The Art of War\". On the other hand there are songs like 'The Final Solution' or 'Wehrmacht', which represent something new and which show what the future might hold for SABATON.\"[21]\n\nPär: \"We had been working on some songs for quite a while. Some others are around 10 years old. About 3 months ago we entered the studio where everything was arranged. We wrote the lyrics during the studio sessions. The recordings themselves took about 5 weeks, including mix and mastering.\"[22]\n\nJoakim: \"I don't know (why the album is so short) - I was surprised myself (laughs). \"Primo Victoria\" and \"Attero Dominatus\" weren't much longer either. One of my old favorite albums is \"Rising\" by RAINBOW, which only contains six tracks. If you release an album with 17 songs, not everyone can be of the same quality. Therefore, I prefer shorter albums with eight to a maximum of twelve songs, which are really strong. As an artist you should rather deal with the really good songs than try to artificially inflate the album.\"[23]\n\nPär: \"(...) the songs are quite short and we were really surprised. We don't plan that we should have this kind of song or this kind of song, we work with the best songs that are written at that moment. When a song is good enough to written all the way, it will be on the album. If it's not good enough to finish writing, it won't be on the album. When we have enough songs for an album, we decide to go to the studio and start recording. We don't think about whether they are fast songs or slow songs. What's important is that they are GOOD songs. On \"Coat of Arms\", they turned out to be short songs. On \"The Art of War\", there are more longer songs.\"[24]\n\nPär: \"Our previous album \"The Art of War\" was much darker, more epic and more concept based. The new one is more simple cheerful heavy metal. I hope that the people are looking for this.\"[25]\n\nPär: \"(...) we are very happy with it. When the recording was finished we had no feeling for the album because we had worked so hard. So we didn't know whether we had recorded a good or bad album. Now after some time we know that it has become a good album.\"[26]\n\nPär: \"I think 'The Art of War' was a lot more epic. The new album is actually more straight forward in my opinion and has easy-going metal songs. All songs were actually composed in such a way that they also work very well live.\"[27]\n\nPär: \"I do not think actually that \"Coat of Arms\" was a evolution of the band, it was more of simply a continuation of a already powerful band. The most interesting with that album was that we worked on another way. We did the recording ourselves and took professional help with drums and mixing. That was something we won't do again in the future. Too many bands do this and we don't think it's good.[28]\n\nPär: \"We are satisfied with Coat of Arms, but there are some things we could have changed. The recording process where we first started with Peter Tägtgren in one studio, then continued in our own studio without producer and finally mixed it with Fredrik Nordström in another studio. The idea of using 3 studios and 3 producers was not ideal. It made it complicated.\"[29]\n\nLyrical themes[]\n\nThis album specifically deals with battles and incidents from the years 1939 to 1945 – the period of World War II. While some songs are about famous moments such as the Warsaw Uprising and the Battle of Midway, others shine a light on lesser-told stories such as the foreign pilots who fought in the Battle of Britain (Aces in Exile), and Finland’s most celebrated military sniper (White Death).[30]\n\nPär: \"The subjects of all the tracks included on \"Coat of Arms\" were given to us - in one way or another - by fans. Since we've received a total of over 10,000 ideas for songs, choosing the ones we want to do was a difficult task\".[31]\n\nPär: \"We decided to choose World War II due to the fact that most countries took part in it. What's more, it also affected those countries that did not directly participate in it. It is quite obvious,since the war is considered to be \"world\". The conflict included so many interesting events that - if only we wanted - it could provide us with inspiration for the next ten albums.\"[32]\n\nPär: \"There's a lot of potential song material in World War II. That's why we focused the entire album \"Coat of Arms\" about World War II, because there's an unlimited source of information about it.\"[33]\n\nPär: \"(...) in Sweden, we don't know so much about World War II, we have a few stories we've heard and of course movies we've seen. But we asked our world wide fans to send in ideas. They sent in about a hundred ideas on the last album and some we actually made into songs. This time, it was quite different, because ten thousand ideas came in or maybe even more and they still come in every day! Our friends were really helpful in coming up with ideas for song themes. We'd get together and say, this sounds interesting. We'd do some research and find out that this would be the right subject. Then we would look into books, movies and documentaries. What you find on the Internet may not always be the correct information. The fans have been really helpful with this as well. They'd find documentaries that weren't in a language we could understand, but they would translate them for us. They would send us DVDs with home-made subtitles so we could understand what's going on. The fans are really dedicated in helping us and also staying as true as possible to the story. Usually there are two sides to a story...the winner and the loser...and they both have their own books. We try to find things from a more objective point of view. What are the real facts and what is propaganda?\"[34]\n\nJoakim: \"For our forthcoming album, we want to highlight historical events that are not so well known worldwide. This gives us a lot more freedom compared to working on The Art of War where each song corresponded to a particular chapter in Sun Tzu's book. Now we have decided to choose the ten best compositions we have come up with, and dress them up for texts that are not as overexposed as we have done so far. Let's not sing about battles involving over two million people, as is the case with the Battle of Kursk. So many important battles have taken place in the world, involving no more than two hundred and three hundred people, and so many major events have taken place that have had an impact on world history, but still remain shrouded in mystery. That is why we want to focus our attention exactly there - to tell people about episodes of military history that they either do not know about, or if they know, it is very small. Not like the D-Day and the Normandy landing that everyone knows about.\"[35]\n\nTracklist[]\n\nCoat of Arms (03:35)\n\nMidway (02:29)\n\nUprising (04:55)\n\nScreaming Eagles (04:07)\n\nThe Final Solution (04:56)\n\nAces in Exile (04:22)\n\nSaboteurs (03:15)\n\nWehrmacht (04:14)\n\nWhite Death (04:10)\n\nMetal Ripper (03:50)\n\nDigipak bonus tracks:\n\nCoat of Arms (Instrumental) (03:35)\n\nMetal Ripper (Instrumental) (03:51)\n\nStreaming Services and digital Download bonus track:\n\nWhite Death (Instrumental) (04:10)\n\nChart performance[]\n\nChart (2010) Peak\n\nposition Swedish Albums Chart[36] 2 Hungarian Albums Chart[37] 9 Polish Albums Chart[38] 9 Greek Album Charts[39] 10 Finnish Album Charts[40] 15 German Album Charts[41] 19 Switzerland Album Charts[42] 22 Austrian Album Charts[43] 71 Billboard[44] 87 (Top Hard Music)\n\n124 (Heatseekers)"
