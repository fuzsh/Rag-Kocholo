        "text": "Post by cjd on\n\nHitler ephemera is not really my thing, but this is a somewhat striking piece. The caption Unsere Hoffnung translates as \"Our Hope\" and this is apparently quite early, appearing on covers in 1933. (In January, 1933 Hitler was appointed chancellor.)\n\nAnyone know anything behind these? I've seen perf and imperf, and various colors.\n\nC.\n\nPost by Ryan on\n\nThe German Wikipedia page on the Hitler Head stamps includes a small bit of info on the \"Unsere Hoffnung\" propaganda labels. They were produced by a printer in Braunschweig and were sold in booklets of 20 labels for 20 Pfennig. The labels had no postal validity. According to the Wikipedia page, they were originally produced for the March 1933 election, but the earliest known usage is from May 1, 1933. Usage is known until early 1943.\n\nRyan\n\nPost by Ryan on\n\nAnother find from last night's sort through some worldwide stamps was this label advertising Roth-Händle cigarettes, a brand which still exists today. I've found info on a book printed in 1971 commemorating the 100th anniversary of the brand, so they've been around a long time. In their original formulation, they were rather on the strong side of things, to the point where current legislation doesn't allow tar / nicotine levels to be that high any longer. I don't have a clue how old the label is, as they have a habit of using retro packaging - the label might date from 1910 or it might date from 1990, I have no idea.\n\nRyan\n\nPost by jamesw on\n\nlove the label Ryan. Great colour, and the mustache is to die for!\n\nPicked up a few German labels the other day.\n\nHere's a pair which (google) translates\n\n450 years\n\nProtection guild\n\nCome to this jubilant celebration in Sommerfeld, Leipzig\n\nNot sure what a 'protection guild' is. Looks more like a shooting club to me.\n\nPost by jamesw on\n\nTourism in Munich for the outdoorsy German.\n\n**Just noticed these, along with the other two of the set in Rod's Austrian stamps thread. And of course I should have noticed the OSTERR in the headings on these. I was thrown by Munchen at the bottom. Thanks Rod.\n\nPost by jamesw on\n\nAdvertising label for this Dresden company on their 75th anniversary in 1914. This is described as a 'sledge toboggan'. From what I can find on the interweb, they also made lighters and possibly tools.\n\nI'm thinking, from the #4 in the upper left corner, this might be from a series, perhaps showing their different products.\n\nBe interesting to see any others.\n\nPost by jamesw on\n\nA couple more German labels\n\nThe Berlin label has no year, but the signature is Kurt Kranz 50, so that probably places it in 1950.\n\nThe Dusseldorf label dates from 1960.\n\nPost by jamesw on\n\nfound this little 1914 Red Cross seal in a pile of Swiss stamps. Postmarked Berlin.\n\nUnverkäuflich translates (google) as 'not for sale'\n\nedit- found other versions of this label on DKEnterprises website. No info about them though.\n\nPost by cjd on\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II:\n\nFürs Fliegerheim cinderella. I believe this was used as a fundraiser for an amateur flying club. If there is a better answer, please let me know. This is one of a large set (perhaps 80?) depicting German \"personalities.\" At least one way they were sold was in blocks of 20 (2 rows of 10). I haven't seen any other formats.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II was KGV's first cousin, which is why I picked up this one. (Well, that and it was pretty close to free, if I recall correctly.)\n\nPost by jamesw on\n\nA pair from Karlsruhe Germany 1915 Industrial Exhibition.\n\nThe label on the right has full gum, and an imprint on the gum from the printer. The imprint seems to have transferred to the butt of the horse on the left at some point, probably when they were in storage somewhere.\n\nPost by jamesw on\n\nPicked up these four large German labels today.\n\nBeautiful 1912 Photographic Expo in Heidelberg\n\nMunich 1927. My guess (without any research) and expo for craftsmen?\n\nAnd this one is intriguing. While it says Leipzig and bears the MM of postwar Germany (someone remind me exactly what that means, my brain isn't working) the text seems to be in either Portuguese (feira - according to google translate) or Spanish (google translate says other words are thus).\n\nPost by jaysee on\n\nMM = Muster-Messe\n\nYour Leipzig Fair label is in Portuguese.\n\nI'm not sure what it was used for, but it comes in several languages. Below you can see German, English, French, Esperanto, Polish, Spanish, Italian & Portuguese versions:\n\nalphabetilately.org/Esperanto/non-esp/leipzig.jpg\n\nPost by PostmasterGS on\n\njamesw,\n\nThe \"Grenzland in Not\" (Borderland in Need) was an exhibition held in June 1933, at the Technischen Hochschule München (Technical University of Munich).\n\nAt that time, the Nazis were spreading the ideology of Lebensraum, or \"living space\", particularly in the countries to the east. The \"Grenzland in Not\" campaign was a form of battlespace preparation -- encouraging aid to the border regions to strengthen the pro-German presence and lay the groundwork for easy annexation, either by peaceful or violent means. The map on the cinderella is Czechoslovakia.\n\nBy 1933, the University's Student Union was among the most pro-Nazi student groups in Germany, and it sponsored the exhibition as a means of promoting the campaign.\n\nPost by jamesw on\n\nthanks for the info, all!\n\nsome more German labels picked up Friday (poke me if I'm boring you with these. I just think they're great!)\n\n1913 Craftsman and Industrial Exp. I find the Germanic script really hard to decipher.\n\n1909 Munich Brewers Expo\n\n1922 Munich Trade Show\n\n1924 Koblenz Industrial Trade Show\n\n1926 Dusseldorf Health Care Exp (I think). Embossed, possibly a letter seal?\n\n1934 Leipzig Spring Fair\n\nUndated and no location. Workers label? The 2h denomination makes me think charity label and also makes me wonder about possible Austrian origin.\n\nPost by jaysee on\n\nYou can read all about the Komotau exhibition below. There are several postcards and 3 poster stamps at the bottom (including yours).\n\ntranslate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://www.komotau.de/landesschau.htm&prev=search\n\nPost by cjd on\n\nI see where you are going with the worker's label, but I don't think an Austrian label would use the colors of Germany in the shields? I found another online, with different colors in the shields, on offer on a German site under benevolent associations. (If it was Austria, after the Anschluss, I'd be inclined to expect black, red and white, rather than black, red and gold.) Guessing. (Obviously.)\n\nPost by jamesw on\n\nThanks for the info about the Komotau exhibit, jaysee. It also proves my point about the Germanic font. I read that as Komofau. No wonder I couldn't find any info.\n\ncjd, I agree an Austrian connection would be iffy. The 'h' after the 2 make me think 'heller' - Austrian currency. But it wouldn't be the first time that sort of thing fooled me.\n\nAnd I think the colour on the one you found is the same. The bottom colour is metallic gold, and I think the ink on your example has oxidized. Just guessing too."
