This is also the oldest reference to its own national emblem of the city, with the Imperial eagle appearing a little later, first seen on early 14th-century coins. The colors of the shield are thought not to come from the County of Holstein, but from the Imperial arms. From around 1450 the two arms were found combined, the eagle bearing the Hanseatic coat of arms as breast shield. Its continued use today makes it the oldest coat of arms of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nAfter the inclusion of Lübeck into the First French Empire on 1 January 1811, the city received a new coat of arms, to emphasise the position of Lübeck as a community within the French state. In this emblem, designed by the Conseil du Sceau, the traditional red-and-white coat of arms sat on a pair of black eagle's wings, an approximate representation of the Lübeck double eagle; this combination on a white field. As Lübeck was one of the Bonnes villes of the Empire, a chief gules, with three golden Imperial bees, was added. This coat of arms was awarded to Lübeck by Napoleon Bonaparte on 13 June 1811 with a signed Wappenbrief. After liberation from French rule in 1813, and the restoration of Lübeck's status as an independent city-state, the traditional coat of arms was reinstated.\n\nWith the abolition of Lübeck's independence in the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937, annexing it to the Free State of Prussia, as a part of the Province of Schleswig-Holstein, the city was permitted to keep its old coat of arms.\n\nGreater coat of arms of the Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck during the German Empire\n\nAn earlier representation of the coat of arms\n\nMosaic from the vertical-lift bridge over the Elbe–Lübeck Canal below the castle gate\n\nCoat of arms in a window of the Imperial Supreme Court building in Leipzig (now the Federal Administrative Court of Germany)\n\nThe official coat of arms of the city since 1997, designed by Professor Kurt Weidemann\n\nSee also\n\nFree City of Lübeck\n\nOrigin of the coats of arms of German federal states\n\nReferences\n\nAntjekathrin Graßmann (ed), Lübeckische Geschichte, Schmidt-Römhild, 1989."
