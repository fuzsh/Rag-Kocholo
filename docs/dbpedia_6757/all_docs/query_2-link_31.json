        "text": "The maximum number of participants depends on the desired program components. We are happy to help. Together we will find the right offer for your guests. An initial overview of our capacities can be found here.\n\nYour logo or event title can be displayed in a variety of ways: for example on an LED pedestal directly in front of the main entrance of the Customer Centre, on TFT displays in our large elevator, on the menu cards for your event or on the participant cards. We are pleased to discuss the possibilities for your event with you. Please send us the company or event logo as jpg, png, tiff or as a vector file at least 3 days before your event.\n\nThere are 3 rows in the front of the factory gate, each with 5 flagpoles, where we can place your flags on request. The ideal size of the flags is 150 x 400 cm (width x height). The attachment is by carabiners. When you book a driving event at the Porsche (on-road) Circuit, you can also have up to 13 flagpoles at the start / finish line.\n\nThe large capacity lift has the dimensions 5,650 x 2,780 x 2,050 mm (L x W x H) and can carry a load of 9.5 t or 126 persons. The maximum access height of the lift is 2 m. Please note that the width at a height of 750 to 980 mm above the floor is reduced by a 120 mm wide control panel.\n\nIn the Motorsport Lounge on the ground floor, the floor is equipped with porcelain tiles (anthracite). On the 1st and 2nd floors, the rooms (Porsche Lounge, Forum, Board room and Club room) are designed with textile flooring. The Porsche Auditorium, as well as the gallery on the third and fourth floors, are also equipped with porcelain tiles (anthracite). The stage has solid oak wood parquet. The maximum load on the tiles and the stage is 5 kN / mÂ².\n\nPlease make sure to include a deadline for the participant registration in the invitations. This should be planned in such a way so that you can inform us at least 5 days before your event, as to how many people will be present. In general, invitations or other publications with pictures and references to the Porsche factory Leipzig are to be approved by Porsche Leipzig GmbH before shipment or publication. We are happy to provide you with graphical material. A picture of the Porsche coat of arms is reserved for Porsche Communications and is therefore not permitted. Your event manager is happy to answer all of your questions.\n\nThis depends on whether events are already planned for the day of your event or the day before. Your allocated event manager will be happy to inform you about when you can deliver and assemble.\n\nYou may take photos in the Customer Centre or on the circuits. A corresponding film and photo-permit must be approved by Porsche in the case of more extensive recordings (film crews, documentation of driving events, etc.) Please understand that photography is not permitted in the vehicle production area.\n\nDriving events at Porsche Leipzig are multifaceted. In addition to the offer of guided driving under the guidance of an instructor, we also offer section trainings to improve the driver's skills and \"taxi rides / hot laps\" (passengers sit beside a motor sport professional). As an incentives competitions can also be integrated into the on and off-road events.\n\nLegal notice Data protection Human Rights Compliance General Terms and Conditions\n\n*Data determined in accordance with the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) as required by law. You can find more information on WLTP at www.porsche.com/wltp. For Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) range and Equivalent All Electric Range (EAER) figures are determined with the battery fully charged, using a combination of both battery power and fuel.\n\nValues are provided for comparison only. To the extent that fuel and energy consumption or CO2 values are given as ranges, these do not relate to a single, individual car and do not constitute part of the offer. Optional features and accessories can change relevant vehicle parameters such as weight, rolling resistance and aerodynamics which may result in a change in fuel or energy consumption and CO2 values. Vehicle loading, topography, weather and traffic conditions, as well as individual driving styles, can all affect the actual fuel consumption, energy consumption, electrical range, and CO2 emissions of a car.\n\n** Important information about the all-electric Porsche models can be found here."
