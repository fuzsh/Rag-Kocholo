        "text": "What is the most interesting thing about the #135th #Canton #Fair? It is definitely this rideable suitcase. Although it is not our product, see many foreign friends buying it and riding a donkey around the exhibition,it is quite cool . I really want to run up, take our motor, and sell it to him! I wonder if the box can hold up if a 200-pound fat man rides on it? This store sells this product and it has always been very popular. In addition, I have another question, what kind of motor is used for this roller? You can take a guess together.\n\nüöÄ The Power of LinkedIn for Dealers üåü Did you know that LinkedIn has experienced an incredible 41% growth in post activity over the last two years?
