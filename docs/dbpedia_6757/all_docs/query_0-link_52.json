I think this is a good sign\n\nUkrainian flag:\n\nLeipzig flag:\n\nDo those flags have a common history by chance?\n\nSussex\n\nSeveral flags have similar colors but different patterns. The EU and Sweden for example.\n\nBut except for the fact that there is their emblem in the middle.\n\nDo you mean the Leipzig flag? Yes, that’s because cities and towns don’t actually have their own flags, only a coat of arms. That is, strictly speaking, the city of Leipzig does not have a flag, but only its coat of arms, which it presents and brands on a flag for marketing reasons."
