        "text": "A unique system of arcades and passageways that never ceases to amaze architecture enthusiasts. Although cities such as London, Paris and Hamburg also have numerous shopping arcades, only Leipzig has such a closed system of these buildings in the city centre. The various historical forms that have been preserved are remarkable.\n\nIt all started with the through yard. It was built so that goods could be loaded quickly without having to turn the wagon, especially during the Leipzig trade fairs. Another advantage was that the distances between two rows of buildings were shortened. Today, Kretschmanns Hof, for example, still gives an impression of this interesting construction method.\n\nIn contrast to the Durchhof, which connected different buildings with each other, the Baroque Durchhaus of the 18th century had a uniform style and a self-contained form. However, the logistical and economic advantages of the previous building were retained. The ground floor was mostly occupied by shops and vaults, with living quarters on the first floor and warehouses above. Of these architectural gems, only the Barthels Hof has been preserved in Leipzig. Following its extensive renovation in the mid-1990s, it now shines again in its former splendour and has become a tourist attraction.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, numerous exhibition centres were built in Leipzig. These buildings opened up plots and rooms that originally had nothing to do with each other. Specks Hof or the Mädler Passage, for example, were built over a large number of older buildings. The example of the municipal department stores' shows that the exhibition centres often even enclosed entire blocks of streets. This architecture was tailored to the requirements of the new model trade fairs. Whereas previously all goods had been brought to Leipzig, loaded and sold during the trade fairs, by the end of the 19th century businessmen only presented samples of their wares. The aim was to present them as effectively as possible in an attractive setting. The exhibition centres were usually only used during trade fairs.\n\nAfter German reunification in 1990, many property companies and investors in particular seized the opportunity to renovate the historic arcades, courtyards and exhibition centres. The city of Leipzig attached particular importance to ensuring that the buildings, some of which had fallen into complete disrepair during the GDR era (e.g. Webers Hof), were refurbished in accordance with monument protection regulations. It is well known that a certain Dr Jürgen Schneider acquired the \"prime pieces\" of Leipzig's building stock.\n\nWith the development of a new trade fair concept and the relocation of the Leipzig Trade Fair Centre to the newly built exhibition grounds in 1996, the exhibition buildings in the city centre lost their original function. Museums, galleries, restaurants, shops and offices moved into the former exhibition spaces. However, new arcades were also built (e.g. Brühl-Arkade, Strohsack) and their modern charm also contributes to the attractiveness of the city centre.\n\nWith the exception of a few buildings that have not yet been renovated (e.g. Oelßners Hof), visitors today find an atmospheric ambience in the arcades and exhibition centres that invites them to stroll and linger. Hundreds of shops exude international flair with their diverse range of products. However, visitors will not only find exclusive branded goods here, but also everyday necessities and typical Saxon cuisine.\n\nFollow us on a tour of the Leipziger Höfe.\n\nBy the way, if you would like to get to know Leipzig's exhibition centres and the arcade system better - no problem: tour guides offer special city tours of the \"Courtyards and Passages in Leipzig\". The tour \"Courtyards, Furs, Sample Fair - The Leipzig Passages Tour\" can be booked at here book.\n\nContent / Contents\n\nBARTHELS HOF - Formerly: \"Zur Goldenen Schlange\" (The Golden Snake)\n\nBLAUER HECHT\n\nBLUE AND GOLD STAR / KRETSCHMANNS HOF\n\nBRÜHL-ARKADE - Formerly: \"Schwabes Hof\"\n\nPassagen Tour Leipzig\n\nHistoric Old Town Guided tour Leipzig\n\nJÄGERHOF - Formerly: Lederhof (Hainstraße 17) and \"Zum Goldenen Hahn\" (Hainstraße 19)\n\nKING-ALBERT-HOUSE\n\nKÖNIGSHAUS\n\nMÄDLER PASSAGE LEIPZIG - Formerly: \"Auerbachs Hof\"\n\nEXHIBITION CENTRE AT THE MARKET\n\nMESSEHOF - Formerly: \"Hohmanns Hof\"\n\nOELßNERS HOF\n\nPETERSBOGEN LEIPZIG - Formerly: Collegium Juridicum\n\nPETERSHOF - Formerly: \"Hôtel de Russie\"\n\nSPECKS HOF LEIPZIG\n\nSTÄDTISCHES KAUFHAUS - MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT STORE\n\nSTEIBS HOF\n\nSTENTZLERS HOF\n\nSTROHSACK PASSAGE - Formerly: Zum Strohsack\n\nTHEATRE PASSAGE IN THE KROCHHOCHHAUS\n\nUNDERGROUND EXHIBITION CENTRE\n\nWEBERS HOF\n\nZENTRAL-MESSEPALAST - CENTRAL EXHIBITION CENTRE\n\nBARTHELS HOF - Formerly: \"Zur Goldenen Schlange\" (The Golden Snake)\n\nIt is the only surviving 18th century through-house from the time of the goods fair and is one of the city's most famous buildings, and not just because of its attractive location. The \"Golden Snake\" was Leipzig's oldest Renaissance building and was erected in 1523 by Hieronymus Walter and remodelled in Baroque style in 1747-1750 by Friedrich Seltendorff on behalf of the city captain and merchant Johann Gottlieb Barthel. Barthel had the buildings at Markt 8 and Hainstraße 1 with the courtyard and passageway to Kleine Fleischergasse extended.\n\nHowever, the façade dates from 1871, and the magnificent Renaissance bay window, still influenced by the Gothic style, has only been in its current position in the courtyard since 1872. It is considered to be the oldest surviving fragment of a Leipzig townhouse façade. For almost three and a half centuries, from 1523 onwards, it adorned the house of Hieronymus Walther, who was the Leipzig branch manager of the famous Welser trading company at the time.\n\nAs a witness to Leipzig's commercial architecture, the imposing courtyard conveys a picture of life in Leipzig at the time of the trade fairs, particularly due to its size, the height of the buildings and their attics. The beginnings of the crane beams over which goods were once pulled into the warehouses are still clearly recognisable on the mighty 18th century courtyard wings. As early as the 16th century, trade was often conducted in the courtyards, as they offered protection from wind, heat and moisture. The courtyards were usually created by the amalgamation of several houses, whereby the old ravines disappeared. This in turn resulted in a public right of passage, contrary to Roman law, which regarded entering the courtyards as trespassing. After reunification, the entire complex was renovated and is now back to its former glory. In addition to original shops in the inner courtyard, there is also the \"Barthels Hof\" restaurant, which was established in 1890 and offers many Saxon specialities. Your city guide will be able to tell you more about Leipzig's culinary delights.\n\nAddress: Markt 8 and Hainstraße 1 / Kleine Fleischergasse 2\n\nBLAUER HECHT\n\nThe passage was named after the inn \"Zum blauen Hecht\", first mentioned in 1551. The façade cladding of the fur trade building, built in 1911/12 by Leopold Stentzler, is made of limestone. The roof, which is formed by four striking dormers with pointed gables, is striking. The house sign with the blue pike emphasises the entrance to the passage. Animal heads form the capital-like ends of the façade pillars. However, the passage leads into a dreary backyard on Reichsstraße.\n\nAddress: Nikolaistraße 39-45\n\nBLUE AND GOLD STAR / KRETSCHMANNS HOF\n\nThe symbolism of the house name \"blue and gold star\" is sculpturally depicted on the balcony grille above the ground floor passageway. The newly designed rectangular courtyard is architecturally very attractive. Four historic cast-iron columns are incorporated into the loggias above the courtyard exits. Hainstraße 14 is connected to the Kretschmanns Hof commercial building, which was built in 1910/12 by Leipzig architect Max Fricke. The large one is tiled in white.\n\nAddress: Hainstraße 14 / Katharinenstraße 17\n\nBRÜHL-ARKADE - Formerly: \"Schwab's Hof\"\n\nUntil the destruction of the Second World War, the site of today's Brühl Arcade was occupied by \"Schwabes Hof\", a transit yard. Afterwards, the area was left undeveloped and planted with flowers and shrubs. The Brühl Arcade is integrated into the new five-storey Marriott Hotel, which was completed in 1998 to designs by the Wittstock und Partner planning group from Hanover. The new building successfully takes up the tradition of the Leipzig arcades. A three-storey balcony bay emphasises the entrance to the arcade on Brühl. The arcade alternates between flat passageways and two two-storey glazed, bright atriums. The west side of the first courtyard was decorated with large-format paintings by Leipzig artist Michael Fischer-Art. The large gable wall of the adjoining gap to the east is also decorated with depictions by the artist.\n\nAddress: Brühl 33 / Richard-Wagner-Straße 9\n\nThe passage houses the studio of artist Michael Fischer-Art.\n\nJÄGERHOF - Formerly: Lederhof (Hainstraße 17) and \"Zum Goldenen Hahn\" (Hainstraße 19)\n\nIn the years 1911-20, the model exhibition centre, designed around three atriums, was built according to designs by Alfred Müller on behalf of Kommerzienrat Chr. The historic house sign can still be seen in the first inner courtyard. The monumental street façade made of Thuringian shell limestone is typical of the architecture before the First World War. The first white-tiled inner courtyard (green sections) is particularly spacious. All three courtyards were fitted with light glass roofs during the 1995 refurbishment.\n\nAddress: Hainstraße 17-19/ Große Fleischergasse 11-13\n\nKING-ALBERT-HOUSE\n\nThe house with its passageway was built in 1913 according to designs by Emil Franz Hänsel, the leading commercial building architect of the time. Two courtyards are connected by flat passageways. A marble-clad main staircase is located in the large courtyard. Unique in Leipzig's architecture is the use of glazed ceramics for the cladding of the ground floor and mezzanine floor at the front facing the street. There used to be two friezes in the courtyard depicting scenes from the life of King Albert of Saxony.\n\nAddress: Market 9 / Barefoot Lane 2/8\n\nKÖNIGSHAUS\n\nOpposite the Alte Waage, on the south side of the market square, stands the Königshaus, which is one of Leipzig's most interesting architectural monuments in terms of cultural history. Around 1610, Welsch, a professor of medicine, had a very stately building erected in place of a house built in the 15th century, in which the council soon began to accommodate its guests. Peter the Great stayed here in 1698 when he was travelling through Leipzig from Holland to Russia.\n\nIn 1706-1707, the wealthy manufacturer Andreas Dietrich Apel had the building remodelled by Gregor Fuchs in the Baroque style. Now the guests favoured the house even more. Augustus the Strong celebrated his lavish parties here, for which the town had to foot the bill. On 19 October 1813, Napoleon bid farewell to the Saxon king in the bay window room on the first floor. The commander-in-chief of the allies, Prince Schwarzenberg, died in the royal house in 1820 when he visited the site of the Battle of the Nations once again. Until 1781, the courtyard was occasionally used for concerts organised by Johann Adam Hiller's \"Musikübende Gesellschaft\". In 1932, the Leipzig architect Curt Schiemichen built the passage into the building, which had been converted into a model exhibition centre.\n\nAddress: Market 17\n\nImportant personalities such as Peter the Great, Napoleon, Augustus the Strong and Prince Schwarzenberg frequented the royal house\n\nMÄDLER PASSAGE LEIPZIG - Formerly: \"Auerbachs Hof\"\n\nAuerbachs Hof, later known as Mädler Passage, was built in 1530-1538 by Heinrich Stromer, a professor of medicine from Auerbach in Franconia, as a Renaissance-style passageway. He had inherited it in 1519 and opened a thriving wine tavern in 1525. In 1625, the building was remodelled and became the Kaufhof, as impressively described by Goethe. Jewellery, silk, lace and gallantry goods were traded in around 100 vaults. The fame of the wine bar \"Auerbachs Keller\" was established by the cellar scene in Goethe's \"Faust\". The entrance is effectively accentuated by bronze figures by the Leipzig sculptor Matthieu Molitor.\n\nToday's Mädler Passage is one of Leipzig's most beautiful shopping streets and connects the Königshauspassage with the Messehofpassage. With one façade facing Neumarkt and the other facing Grimmaische Strasse, the former Mädler Passage exhibition centre has 5,700 m2 of exhibition space and was the meeting place for anyone who traded in porcelain, ceramics or earthenware. In 1912, Anton Mädler demolished the well-known Auerbachs Hof, which was by no means in keeping with modern trade fair life, and had the five-storey new building with the Passage constructed while retaining the old floor plan. The reference to the Baroque style is easy to recognise. Since 1969, a Meissen carillon can also be admired in the Mädler Passage. The total length of the passage is 140 metres. Today, the passage system with the Mädler Passage at its heart is the benchmark for the further urban and architectural development of Leipzig's city centre.\n\nAddress: Grimmaische Straße 3-4 / Neumarkt 14\n\nJohann Wolfgang Goethe frequented the \"Auerbachs Keller\" wine bar during his time as a student in Leipzig.\n\nEXHIBITION CENTRE AT THE MARKET\n\nThe position of the Leipzig market in trade fair life is also emphasised by the construction of the new trade fair building on the market. It was inaugurated on 1 September 1963 as a book fair building with an exhibition area of 5,300 m2 and stands on the site of the \"National\" exhibition centre, which was bombed out in 1943. The building was constructed using a steel skeleton construction method and was designed to be simple in keeping with its surroundings. It is relatively harmonious with the neighbouring buildings, the Königshaus and the Messehof.\n\nAddress: Market 16\n\nMESSEHOF - Formerly: \"Hohmanns Hof\"\n\nThe Messehof, the first completely new trade fair building of the post-war period, adjoins the Messehaus am Markt, the main wing of which is located on Petersstraße. After a year of construction, the building was handed over for the 1950 autumn fair. It was available to the food and luxury goods sectors. The exhibition centre had an exhibition area of 9,400 m2. The \"Hohmanns Hof\", which had been destroyed in the war, had previously stood on this site. Eberhard Werner provided the design for the six-storey trade fair palace, the foundations of which lie six metres below ground. The façade was clad with Langensalza limestone slabs.\n\nPart of the characteristic passageway system runs through the hall; it is an 80 metre long shopping street to Neumarkt. The main staircase and the five lifts can be reached from here. In the centre of the hall is the so-called mushroom column made of light-coloured Jura marble with the typical depiction of the \"working man\" (miner, farmer, spinner, humanities scholar).\n\nThe Peek & Cloppenburg department stores', completed in 1994, has created a passageway arm to Preußergasse.\n\nAddress: Petersstraße 15 / Neumarkt 16/18\n\nOELßNERS HOF\n\nThe two magnificent four-storey sandstone façades in Nikolaistrasse and Ritterstrasse are a reminder of the glorious days of the fur trade at the turn of the century. The impressive fur trade building was constructed in 1907/08 by the Leipzig architect Max Pommer. The two wrought-iron gates are remarkable. Above the entrance door in Ritterstraße is a baroque cartouche with the symbols of trade in the coat of arms: Mercury's staff with a winged helmet, a merchant ship, a captive balloon and a railway carriage. On the first floor there is a keystone with a portrait of the owner. The building is to be renovated in the coming months.\n\nAddress: Nikolaistraße 20-26 / Ritterstraße 23 - 29\n\nPETERSBOGEN LEIPZIG - Formerly: Collegium Juridicum\n\nThe development, which began in 1999, closes the gap created during the Second World War. The new passageway will cross the massive building block from Petersstrasse in a gentle curve and lead into a rotunda.\n\nThe new building will house a supermarket, a hotel, the university's new Juridicum, a multiplex cinema and a library. The façade was designed by four young Leipzig architects. The future hotel windows project out as glass cubes and can be seen from Petersstrasse. The attraction is a band of glass that is both a screen and a support layer. Four artistically designed holograms are inserted at selected points. This creates a virtual gallery that is constantly in motion.\n\nAddress: Petersstraße 36 / Schloßgasse 10-24\n\nPETERSHOF - Formerly: \"Hôtel de Russie\"\n\nOpposite the exhibition centre is the Petershof. It was opened in 1929 as a trade fair centre and has an exhibition area of 10,500 m2. In the past, toys, musical instruments and joke articles were mainly presented there.\n\nEleven buildings had to make way for the construction, including the \"Hôtel de Russie\", in whose place stood the inn \"Zum Engel\", where Johann Friedrich Böttger exhibited his porcelain for the first time in Leipzig in 1710 and where Schiller lived in 1785. The seven-storey Petershof was built by Alfred Liebig according to his own designs. The ground floor now houses the Capitol film theatre.\n\nAddress: Petersstraße 20\n\nSPECKS HOF LEIPZIG\n\nSpecks Hof is the oldest surviving arcade in Leipzig and is one of the most architecturally outstanding commercial buildings in Leipzig. The site of the trade fair centre, built by Emil Franz Hänsel between 1908 and 1909, had previously been home to a well-known department store whose owner was called Speck, latterly even Freiherr von Speck, but who, despite the high-sounding name, traded in wool and farmed sheep. The rapid rise of the neighbouring Handelshof inspired the construction of the five-storey Messepalast. In fact, it was so successful that extensions had to be added in 1911 and 1928. In the course of the first extension, Specks Hof was connected to the Hansahaus exhibition centre in 1911 by means of a passageway. Incidentally, Specks Hof was the first trade fair building with a perfect forced tour for visitors and served as a model for many other trade fair buildings. Until 1989, the exhibition centre with a presentation area of 6,000 m2 served as an exhibition venue for leather and jewellery goods.\n\nIt was reopened on 27 November 1995 after renovation. The new owners, Bilfinger & Berger and Rendata, had invested 200 million marks. Since then, the attraction has been the three atriums, for which playful contemporary art solutions were commissioned. Bruno Giesel from Leipzig, Moritz Götze from Halle and Johannes Grützke from Berlin realised the theme imaginatively with wall friezes, paintings and ceramic medallions. In atrium A, Giesel created a picture frieze with the theme \"The Psychology of Time\". The wall frieze in atrium B: \"The Morning, the Noon, the Evening\" by Goetze consists of approx. 20,000 ceramic panels. In atrium C, Grützke painted 16 medallions with witty depictions of simple everyday objects using the enamel glaze technique. Also noteworthy are the restored copper passages and the art deco chandeliers, which make strolling along the two dozen shops a special pleasure. In its combination of old and new, the arcade is one of the most glamorous of its kind in Germany.\n\nAddress: Reichsstraße 4-6\n\nSTÄDTISCHES KAUFHAUS - MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT STORE\n\nIt reflects more than 500 years of trade and cultural history than almost any other cultural monument in the city centre. With the change in the new form of trade fair - the model trade fair as the cause of the development of large-scale production at the end of the 19th century - new forms of trade fair buildings inevitably emerged. The old exhibition centres had to make way for the new design. Between 1893 and 1901, under the direction of Hugo Licht, the world's first model trade fair centre, the Städtisches Kaufhaus, was built. The mighty complex with 4,500 square metres of exhibition space served the glassware industry as a trade fair palace. The principle of the forced tour was introduced here. A further 30 new exhibition centres were built by 1917.\n\nThe Städtisches Kaufhaus was built in three stages: in 1893/94 a library building was remodelled for trade fair purposes, in 1895/96 the main wing was built and in 1899-1901 the final section was built, incorporating the old Gewandhaus. The premises of the conservatory and the concert hall created by Dauthe, in which the Gewandhaus concerts were held from 1781-1884, were also demolished.\n\nThe larger-than-life bronze statue of Emperor Maximilian I is located in a niche above the gateway in Universitätsstraße. It was created by Carl Seffner to mark the 400th anniversary of Maximilian's granting of the trade fair privilege during the construction of the municipal department stores'. The interior design was entirely subject to the laws of practicality. The booths and walkways set an example for all subsequent trade fair buildings. On 4 December 1943, the building was badly damaged in a bombing raid. After lengthy reconstruction work, trade fair exhibitors were able to move back in in 1954.\n\nAfter reunification, the municipal department stores' was extensively renovated and the conservation guidelines were implemented in the most precise manner. The courtyard of the municipal library, which had existed for centuries, was once again transformed into a pleasant place to linger. The passageway with inlaid marble flooring has been redesigned and is reminiscent of the early Parisian arcades of the 19th century. Also noteworthy is the reconstructed passenger lift from 1901 in stairwell A. It is the oldest surviving passenger lift in Leipzig. The left-hand of the two rococo doors next to the courtyard entrance on Universitätsstraße, which from 1781 also provided access to the historic Gewandhaussaal on the second floor, is also significant. Renowned musicians such as Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Mozart, Weber and Schumann frequented the hall.\n\nAddress: Neumarkt 9-19\n\nLiszt, Schumann, Weber, Mozart and Mendelssohn Bartholdy, among others, used the left of the two rococo doors next to the courtyard entrance on Universitätsstraße to enter the historic Gewandhaussaal on the second floor.\n\nSTEIBS HOF\n\nThe Leipzig master builder Felix Steib erected the commercial building named after him in 1907. Although it was designed as a trade fair palace, it ultimately served the fur trade - like most of the other buildings in Nikolaistraße. Around 1930, more than 700 fur companies had their headquarters in the area around Brühl, Nikolaistraße, Reichsstraße and Ritterstraße. What is striking about the building is the interesting mixture of historicising forms, partly influenced by Art Nouveau, and modern commercial architecture. The neo-baroque sandstone decoration of the centre axis is striking. The sculptural works are themed around trade and industry. In the gable field of the frontispiece there is a high oval window flanked by two putti with the symbols of a merchant ship and a hammer. The roof of the window above is crowned by a globe. The commercial building is \"guarded\" by two lion sculptures as heraldic animals above the main cornice. On the first floor is the Latin inscription \"Labor vincit mundum\" (Labour overcomes the world). The richly decorated sandstone portal is the most beautiful entrance design of historicism in Leipzig. The two courtyards are tiled in white and blue. The front courtyard has a glass roof. The Steibs Hof, renovated by the Stuttgart architects Heinle, Wischer und Partner, was awarded the \"Hieronymus Lotter Prize for the Preservation of Historical Monuments\" in 1997. During the refurbishment of the Dussmann-Haus (Brühl 64/66) in mid-1990, a small glazed inner courtyard was created, which is now connected to Steibs Hof and forms a new passageway.\n\nAddress: Nikolaistraße 28-32 / Brühl 64/66\n\nSTENTZLERS HOF\n\nStentzlers Hof is a particularly characteristic trade fair building in Leipzig. The five-storey building offered the representatives of the sporting goods companies an exhibition area of 3,500 m2. It was built between 1914 and 1916 by Leopold Stentzler and, of all the trade fair palaces constructed during this period, best reflects the many years of experience of the Mustermesse. The staircase, for example, was laid out centrally in order to create a favourable starting point for the tried and tested tours. The monumental building in reinforced concrete features rich figurative decoration.\n\nThe figures on the outside front, works by the sculptor Bruno Wollstätter, symbolise trade, abundance and similar allegories. At the corner of the building, a Roland with a sword and the Leipzig coat of arms symbolises the city's power. Below it is a banner: \"Unity is strength\". During the renovation in 1994/95, the entrance to Petersstraße was reopened, allowing a passageway-like passage to St Peter's Churchyard. The courtyard was also given a glass roof. A two-storey early baroque box bay from around 1690 with lavish floral decorations was also incorporated into the design of the courtyard.\n\nAddress: Petersstraße 39/41\n\nSTROHSACK PASSAGE - Formerly: Zum Strohsack\n\nThe foundation stone for this new commercial building with arcade was laid on 30 November 1995. The building was realised by the Leipzig architects Appel, Behzadi and Bohne until 1997. The centre of the building is the two-storey hall on Nikolaistraße. Under the restaurant balcony, a clock was set into the floor of the hall under Plexiglas. Its hands are formed by a male and a female figure. The entrance to the arcade on Nikolaistraße was emphasised by a futuristic glass façade extending across all floors. The adjoining street façade to the north is modelled on the commercial building architecture of the turn of the century, while the southern façade with its window frames in Rochlitz porphyry, typical of the area, is based on the town house façades of the 18th century. Two further courtyards follow in the direction of Ritterstraße, although they are less interesting architecturally. The passage owes its name to the town house at Ritterstraße 7, which is integrated into the new building.\n\nAddress: Nikolaistraße 10 / Ritterstraße 7\n\nTHEATRE PASSAGE IN THE KROCHHOCHHAUS\n\nThe name Theatre Passage was first used in 1880. The passage formed a shortcut from Ritterstraße 4 to Goethestraße and Augustusplatz with the New Theatre. The Krochhochhaus was built in 1927/28 according to designs by Munich architect German Bestelmeyer in the New Objectivity style and is the city's first high-rise building. The eleven-storey limestone-clad reinforced concrete building is modelled on the clock tower on Marcusplatz in Venice. The bell-ringer sculptures form the upper end. The phases of the moon can be read on the sphere above the clock. The pediment bears the inscription \"Omnia vincit labor\" (Labour conquers all).\n\nAddress: Goethestrasse 2 / Ritterstrasse\n\nUNDERGROUND EXHIBITION CENTRE\n\nLeipzig's exhibition centres are said to have a profile of their own. If this is true, then it is particularly true of the underground exhibition centre on the market square. Around 2000 exhibitors were unable to obtain a stand in 1919, and out of embarrassment a wooden barrack was erected in front of the Old Town Hall, which severely disrupted the overall appearance of the market and aroused the ire of the people of Leipzig. The exhibitors did not like the hall, but they did like the central location. This gave rise to the idea of \"going underground\".\n\nIn 1925, the market was transformed into a huge building site and the 98 m x 45 m underground exhibition centre was erected. As the city councillors rejected any construction on the market square, the entrance was designed with a low parapet made of Rochlitz porphyry tuff. Access to the exhibition centre was via a two-armed staircase (architect Otto Droge). The underground exhibition centre designed by architect Karl Crämer was the first underground exhibition building in the world and had an exhibition area of 1850 m2. Today it houses the \"Markt 1\" discotheque, among other things.\n\nAddress: Market 1\n\nWEBERS HOF\n\nWebers Hof, as it has been known since 1875, is more than 400 years old and is one of the most architecturally significant town houses in the city. In 1662, master bricklayer Christian Richter completely rebuilt the front building.\n\nThe stair tower, which is still preserved today, was created in the process. The magnificent early Renaissance oriel with its fruit hangings and cornucopias is one of the oldest oriels in Leipzig. The sandstone portal on the ground floor was built in 1872 and the building's character as a Renaissance monument saved it from demolition during the GDR era. After reunification, the completely neglected Webers Hof was renovated and restored to its 1662 condition. The arcades in the inner courtyard, which had not been preserved, were modernised. Since the renovation work was completed in 1997, Webers Hof has been connected to Barthels Hof. Theatre is performed in its atmospheric inner courtyard during the summer.\n\nAddress: Hainstraße 3\n\nZENTRAL-MESSEPALAST - CENTRAL EXHIBITION CENTRE\n\nThis monumental building made of Würzburg shell limestone was erected in 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War. The huge nave expresses the optimism of the young model trade fair centre as well as the bourgeoisie's thirst for prestige. This is also clearly shown by the gable on Grimmaische Strasse with its fake four-storey bay window and a lion on the ridge. The sculptures on the first floor are the work of sculptor Bruno Wollstätter. The architect and client, Emil Franz Hänsel, also acquired the adjoining Monopol exhibition centre in Grimmaische Straße in 1926 and combined it with the Central Exhibition Palace. This union created an exhibition area of 4,700 m2. Office supplies, packaging materials, paper and printed products were exhibited.\n\nThe Zentral-Messepalast was recently reopened after extensive refurbishment and now houses attractive shops as well as the \"Zeitgenössisches Forum Leipzig\" museum.\n\nAddress: Neumarkt 2-4\n\nWould you like to find out more about Leipzig and its fascinating history?
