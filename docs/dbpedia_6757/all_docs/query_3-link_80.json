        "text": "In an Ashkenazic Bible produced in the thirteenth century, we find a unique micrography decoration portraying Ezekiel's vision. On the bottom margin the Masorah micrography shows the full bodies of the four creatures: the lion facing the ox, and the man, in full armor and holding an object in each hand, facing the eagle. I suggest that the choice to portray the human figure in this micrography as an armored knight can be explained by reference to the tradition describing seeing Jacob's image engraved on the throne in Ezekiel's vision, as also reflected in the writings of Hasidei Ashkenaz. The decoration identifies the human figure as Jacob, which may illustrate the verse 'Avir Ya‘akov, meaning “mighty one of Jacob” or Jacob the Knight.\n\n9. On other scenes of the chariot's four creatures in Ashkenazic and French manuscripts see Sara Offenberg, Illuminated Piety: Pietistic Texts and Images in the North French Hebrew Miscellany (Los Angeles: Cherub Press, 2013), 65–71. The Ambrosiana Bible (Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, B. 32 inf., fol. 135a), produced in 1236; the London Miscellany (London, British Library, Add. 11639, fol. 354b), produced in northern France around 1280; The Double Maḥzor (Wrocław, University Library, Cod. Or. I, 1, fol. 89a), probably produced in Esslingen around 1290; and the Leipzig Maḥzor (Leipzig, Universitätsbibliothek V 1102/I, fol.31a), produced in Worms around 1310 (fig. 3); The Copenhagen Maimonides (Guide for the Perplexed) (Copenhagen, The Royal Library, Cod. Hebr. 37, fol. 202a), produced in Barcelona 1348. The creatures in the Leipzig Maḥzor are portrayed without wings. In all of these examples, as well as in the Yonah Pentateuch, the lion is always facing the ox and the man is facing the eagle. On the lion facing the ox as symbolizing harmony and peace see Michael Schneider, Ha-masorot ha-genuzot shel ha-mistikah ha-Yehudit (Los Angeles: Cherub Press, 2013), 239–242. I could not find other illustrations of the four creatures in medieval Hebrew manuscripts.\n\n10. For example, in 'Orḥot ḥayim, a compilation from the end of the thirteenth or early fourteenth century, Rabbi Aharon ha-Kohen of Lunel quotes a responsum by the Rashba (Rabbi Solomon ibn Adret of Barcelona, d. 1310): “It is forbidden to create the form of the four creatures as one figure with four faces, but creating one of them alone is not [forbidden] … and that is why it is allowed to create the form of the lion, the eagle and the ox—each on its own.” 'Orḥot ḥayim: Hilkhot ‘avodah zarah 7, ed. Moshe Schlesinger (Berlin: Druck von H. Itzkowski, 1902), 232–233. I used Katrin Kogman-Appel's translation: A Mahzor from Worms: Art and Religion in a Medieval Jewish Community (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2012), 176; Kogman-Appel, “The Scales in the Leipzig Mahzor: Penance and Eschatology in Early Fourteenth-Century Germany,” in Between Judaism and Christianity: Art Historical Essays in Honor of Elisheva (Elisabeth) Revel-Neher, ed. Katrin Kogman-Appel and Mati Meyer (Leiden: Brill, 2009), 314. Beyond this halakhic restriction, there may be another reason for choosing to differ from the conventional mode of depicting the evangelist symbols in late thirteenth-century Christian culture in Franco-Germany: the masoretor avoided such images due to their christological ideas.\n\n16. Neis, Rachel, “Embracing Icons: The Face of Jacob on the Throne of God,” Images 1 (2007): 48–49CrossRefGoogle Scholar. The importance of the hekhalot literature here is that it was familiar to Hasidei Ashkenaz, who indeed elaborated on it, as meticulously studied in recent years by Annelies Kuyt. See Annelies Kuyt, “Traces of a Mutual Influence of the Haside Ashkenaz and the Hekhalot Literature,” in From Narbonne to Regensburg: Studies in Medieval Hebrew Texts, ed. N. A. van Uchelen and I. E. Zwiep (Amsterdam: Juda Palache Institute, 1993), 62–86; Kuyt, “The Haside Ashkenaz and Their Mystical Sources: Continuity and Innovation,” in Jewish Studies in a New Europe: Proceedings of the Fifth Congress of Jewish Studies in Copenhagen 1994, ed. Ulf Haxen, Hanne Trautner-Kromann and Karen Lisa Goldschmidt Salamon (Copenhagen: C. A. Reitzel A/S International, Det Kongelige Bibliotek, 1998), 462–471. In what follows we shall return to the issue of Hasidei Ashkenaz.\n\n19. I should mention Rabbi Judah the Pious's statement in Sefer Ḥasidim that “one who hires a scribe to write the Masorah for the twenty-four books (i.e., the Bible) should make a condition with the scribe that he should not make the Masorah into drawings of birds or beasts or a tree or into any other illustration … for how will he be able to see [and read the Masorah]?” Sefer Ḥasidim, ed. Jehuda Wistinetzki (Frankfurt a. M: M. A. Wahrmann, 1924), par. 709, 184. However, according to David Stern: “Whether or not Judah was the first to oppose the practice, it is clear that his and any other objections were manifestly ignored by Ashkenazic scribes and Masoretes. Indeed, there is hardly anything more common in Ashkenazic Bibles (and other Ashkenazic books) than micrographic illustration.” Stern, “Hebrew Bible in Europe in the Middle Ages,” 52–53. See also Fronda, Rahel, “Attributing of Three Ashkenazi Bibles with Micrographic Images,” Ars Judaica 9 (2013): 45–56Google Scholar; Shalev-Eyni, Jews among Christians, 4–5; Halperin, Dalia-Ruth, “Decorated Masorah on the Openings between Quires in Masoretic Bible Manuscripts,” Journal of Jewish Studies 65, no. 2 (2014): 323–348Google Scholar. It is important to note that there is a gap between what R. Judah the Pious wrote and the actual acceptance of all his instructions by his followers. One example of that is his ban on writing in the margins (found just after the aforementioned section), however, his own book Sefer gematriot was copied on the margins in the North French Hebrew Miscellany produced around 1280; for more on that see Offenberg, Illuminated Piety, 73–100.\n\n26. I could not find a heraldic equivalent to identify it. Perhaps celestial figures were chosen for the heraldic symbols because they are related to Jacob's image engraved not only upon the throne, but also upon the stars and moon. On this see Wolfson, Along the Path, 27–28, 31–32. A fourteenth-century Jewish seal of a scribe from Trier called “Jacob the scribe” shows a shield with letters forming Jacob's name (IACOB), and a crescent moon on the right side face of a man. Friedenberg, Medieval Jewish Seals, 222–223. I thank Andreas Lehnertz for drawing my attention to this seal.\n\n29. Shalev-Eyni, Jews among Christians, 85–92; Gabrielle Sed-Rejna studied the knights illustrated in the French manuscript of Mishneh Torah in the Kaufmann Collection, produced in 1296 (also called Codex Maimuni) (Budapest, Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Kaufmann Collection, Ms. A.77, vol. 1, fol. 16b; vol. 3, fol. 3b). See the manuscript on the web site: www.kaufmann.mtak.hu/index-en.html (accessed September 3, 2014). Sed-Rajna, Gabrielle, “The Illustrations of the Kaufmann Mishneh Torah,” Journal of Jewish Art 6 (1979): 64–77Google Scholar. This manuscript contains scenes of jousting knights and even of their practice for the games. Also see, for example, a scene in the bottom margin of the first page of 1 Kings of a Hebrew Bible (Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, heb. 4, fol. 249b), composed in Lorraine, in 1286. The scene portrays two jousting knights identified by an inscription over their heads as David and Adoniyahu. On this scene and others see Stern, “The Hebrew Bible in Europe in the Middle Ages,” fig. 13, 48–49.\n\n35. It could look more like a “horn book” (although it does not look as if it has a handle), and I thank Ilia Rodov for this idea. We can compare it with a later example of Moses receiving the Torah in the shape of a “horn book” from the fifteenth-century Second Darmstadt Haggadah (Darmstadt Hessische landes- und hochschulbibliothek, Cod. Or. 28, fol. 9v). On this image see Ilia Rodov, “The King of the King of Kings: Images of Rulership in Late Medieval and Early Modern Christian Art and Synagogue Design,” in Interaction between Judaism and Christianity in History, Religion, Art and Literature, ed. Marcel Poorthuis, Joshua Schwartz and Joseph Turner (Leiden: Brill, 2009), 464."
