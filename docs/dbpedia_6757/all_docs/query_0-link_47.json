        "text": "GOVERNMENT\n\nWhoops, didnt see the threat. ^^;\n\nFor Merkel and the CDU... they are in power now so of course everyone is dissatisfied. Thats ordinary because the opposition would make everything better and less costly too!\n\nLets start with the political system of germany. We are a federation. This means that the government is somewhat spread over germany. Constitutional court is in Karlsruhe, Bonn as well as Berlin have parts of the government in them. State capitals have extensive rights (collecting taxes is state right, they give the taxes to the federal government after collecting them).\n\nThe 16 states are represented in the Bundesrat. The members are send there by the elected governments of the states. They are not elected directly. All decisions must be agreed on by a certain minority. not voting on something is like saying no. If representatives of the same state vote differently from one another their votes are forfeit. coalition governments of states that cant agree on something might as well vote no because abstaining or voting differently from one another is only showing the citizens where the sympathies lie, the end result is always a No vote.\n\nThe federal parliament is the Bundestag, they are elected by mixed member proportional representation. Now what does that mean?\n\nIt means every german has two votes in a federal election. One vote goes to the representative of the constituency. The winner is chose by the first-past-the-post system, this means that if you are in a safe SPD constituency you might as well not vote if you're green. The second vote is for a party. Here, the parties get as many seats as they get votes, meaning that regardless how safe the constituency or state is, you get your vote through. So if 40% of all germans vote for the greens then the greens will get 40% of the seats. If a party gets by the vote for the direct representative lets say... 20% of the constituencies but with the party vote only 15% of total votes than they get as many extra seats as they have constituencies over the 15% party vote they recieved. This means that then there will be extra seats in the bundestag. If they only get 5% of constituencies but 20% of popular vote then they can fill up the remaining 15% by a pre-determined party list.\n\ndue to that there is a small misrepresentation. if the Bundestag has 500 seats but 2 parties are elegible to recieve the extra seats and blow up the seats to 550 members, then some other party that recieved only 10% of the party vote will still only get 50 seats (since the original size was 500 seats, 10% of that is 50). In the new Bundestag, there are 550 seats however so they dont have 10% because that would be 55 seats.\n\nThis system was invented to make sure on the one hand that citizens votes are actually worth something even if they life in a safe constituency, but to make sure on the other hand that parliamentarians (the directly elected ones) have some constituency to answer to and dont life in a vaccum where they are not answerable to no-one.\n\nAs a safeguard against the possibility to have dozens of minor parties with one or two seats each, a party must get 5% of the votes in the party vote or all party votes are discounted (directly chosen ones are different now that i think about it... I think you get them anyways or need at least 4 constituencies or something...). This is so that we dont get coalitions of dozens of parties with one major one and many minor ones or even worse minority governments that get to change allegiance every few days like the nazis did. The only exception to this rule are parties that represent the acknowledged national minorities of germany (danes, Gypsies, sorbs, frisians).\n\nThe chancelor is chosen by the Bundestag and is our head of government. the president is chosen by the so-called Bundesversammlung, this is simply our bundestag and Bundesrat put together (upper and lower house put together in laymans terms), he is our head of state.\n\nSo, with that cleared we can talk about german federal governments. They always are coalitions. Unlike the - from a germans pov - quite funny outrage and panic in the UK when they formed their coalition in more than one week this takes some time. A coalition contract is set up, who gets what ministries and so on. As a general rule the chancelor has the so called \"richtlinienkompetenz\" meaning that the chancelor gets to define the broad outlook of the government, but every minister is in charge of his or her ministry, the chancelor cant just take over just because she is chancelor and tell them what to do. Since this is quite conflicting in practical terms all disagreements are to be solved by the cabinet, of which the chancelor is only primus. so as a general rule germany has a consensus based government structure. not only in so far that we aalways have coalitions but also in so far that even members of the same party dont have to just follow the chancelor in everything.\n\nNow, for the current government we have FDP (economical focus, liberal in the european meaning, chairman is openly ... and married the other day)\n\nand the CDU/CSU (conservatives, chairman is Merkel, theoretical Christian but under Merkel a clear focus on Democracy in the Union.)\n\nThe major looser at the moment is the FDP, they had 15% and are now strugeling to even get over the 5% hurdle (as said, if you dont make that you are out) The CDU lost some votes, but only from 33% then to 31% now. So, hardly a landslide. Merkel remains quite popular when compared to former chancelors, Kohl and Schröder where pretty much disliked but still voted for again.\n\nThe opposition consists of the old workers party SPD (together with the CDU they are considered \"peoples parties\", meaning that they draw from the whole german people, as opposed to the greens for instance that are supposed to only draw from a certain part of society) The SPD is social democratic and has immensly fallen from grace due to former chancelor Schröders policies. They usualy are in government when the CDU is not, only twice was the german people so torn in voting that there had to be a CDU-SPD coalition government, these where all-conquering in voting power and quite split up on what to do with that voting power.\n\nThen we have the greens. Obviously green politics, but they where the first green party in the world to make government afaik, again with schröder and the SPD. voted for the afghanistan war, against iraq. Very reality based policies all in all under then chairman Fischer, nearly tore the party appart with all the governing on real life issues. Now they are lead by one man and one woman (only double chairmanship atm, its supposed to stay with one man, one woman). Male one is Cem Özemir, Female one is Claudia Roth.\n\nLastly we have \"the left Party\" which is the old GDR dictator party remade. They where called SED then, renamed themselves to PDS and then when Lafontaine left the SPD and founded his own party due to Schröders unpopular course they allied with that party and together called themselves the left party. Chairman is Gregor Gisy. Hes got some Stasi (east german KGB) past but went to court to forbid journalitst from writing about it.\n\nWhen the last election was the votes where: (polls now in brackets) government in bold\n\nCDU.....34% (31%)\n\nFDP.....15% (5%)\n\nSPD.....23% (30%)\n\nGreen..11% (20%)\n\nLeft....12% (11%)\n\nSo you see that the CDU/FDP government couldnt govern on if elections where now, but its not as if Merkel would be the main problem. Question is of course is the opposition stronger now or is the FDP just so bad that they loose the votes instead of the SPD gaining the votes? Or is the CDU not loosing votes because the SPD and Greens are just so hideously bad that the CDU is still the better choice between the pest and cholera?\n\nI'll write something about the bavarians and regionality in germany later.\n\nOk, next on the cameras and bases.\n\nThe cameras are basically misinterpretations. Neither Google, nor the government plan to put up CCTV like in britain. With the GDR and the thrid Reich germans are quite oversensitive to that. I can for a few bucks get information on any US citizens, credit card record and so on... I cant with a german. The privacy right in germany is differntly defined in germany to the US for instance. US legal view is that the right to privacy is the right to draw away from the world. In germany the right to privacy means additionaly the right to control what of your data is shown to the world. This is called inforamtional self-determination\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_self-determination\n\n[...] in the context of modern data processing, the protection of the individual against unlimited collection, storage, use and disclosure of his/her personal data is encompassed by the general personal rights of the [German Constitution]. This basic right warrants in this respect the capacity of the individual to determine in principle the disclosure and use of his/her personal data. Limitations to this informational self-determination are allowed only in case of overriding public interest\n\nSo, this pretty much outrules many things possible in other law systems. In general, either a law must be made or a judge must accept every single camera sperately. For the law to be made, possibly the constitution would have to change too. IUf you apply for a credit card you must sign a contract that allows the company to check your credit information. They cant if you dont, but of course will not give you a credit card if you dont either.\n\nFor google to build up cameras, that is basically believed by people that have no real interaction with the internet and those are generally of the elder generation.\n\nUS Bases are generally not a big problem any more. Last time a german car got rolled over by US tanks with the family still inside is a while back, so that helps. IIRC the last incident was a jetfighter cutting with its wings a cable of a cable car in the italian alps with some italians falling to their deaths. Of course with SOFA there where no consequences for the pilot. That of course always creates some outrage. Raping of children like with the marine base in okinawa, japan isnt at all a problem here neither. Not sure why this happens so \"often\" in japan anyways...\n\n-edit: This sounds more negative than I thought it would. In essence what i'm saying is that with troop reductions the rubbs reduced too.\n\nMajor disagrements are with the FDP that want all WMDs out of germany and the US that exactly do not want that. Minor disagrements over the EU and NATO, the EU battle groups where supposed to be a bit more integrated and powerful, but the US interviened and got the promise that the EU military cooperation will do not one single thing that is done already by NATO since the US - then under ....... - feared that the europeans would gradualy leave NATO. While to many conservative US-americans that might sound like a good thing, the problem is that the US needs europe as its major base of logistics and foreign operation. Without NATO, ports would be closed, airspaces off-limits, airbases denied...in effect this would severly hamper US global operations.\n\nDuring the Iraq war german soldiers guarded US bases since the US couldnt spare the soldiers so its not as if there would be demonstrations or anything. As an aside, since reunification the allied powers cant any more unilaterally station troops on german soil against the wishes of the german government. They could until 1990 by the previous SOFA, this has been discontinued since reunification, making germany fully souvereign of her own soil again. It must be said though that the allies never chose to activate that paragraph.\n\nRegionality\n\nGermany is, due to its history, quite regional. in my opinion there are two major reasons for this. Firstly, the late unification and long time with seperate german states. Secondly, the Nazis. The Nazis, because being proud to be a german is somewhat more difficult than being proud to be a french. Of course the french will get clobbered with the \"chease eating surrender monkey\" stereotype, the brits with the empire and the US with its modern wars. But, mostly this is ignored by the more patriotic/nationalist people.\n\nIn germany, one cant just say \"I'm proud to be a german.\" without looking like a neo-nazi. However, its quite possible to say \"I'm proud to be a bavarian\". So the nazis made national patriotism look really bad and since most people need something to identify with they chose the old kingdoms or federal states. This is called \"Lokalpatriotismus\" or local(regional) patriotism.\n\nFor me, i am living in the residency city of the former free Reichscountry of Oldenburg, before that Grand-Dutchy of Oldenburg. As a show of the impact of the old souvereign german countries here the anthem of Oldenburg:\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnyD_Nhuf_E\"]YouTube - Oldenburg Hymne 1 Strophe[/ame]\n\nHail to you o Oldenburg, Hail to your colors!\n\nMay god protect your noble horse, may he bless your sheaves!\n\nHail to your prince, hail, who - beneficciently overlooking you -\n\nlikes to make you happy, o fatherland!\n\nHonor to your flowers, care for their sprouts\n\nblue and red they bloom, the friendship and the love;\n\nas your oaks so strong, as free as the waves of the ocean,\n\nmay german mens might be your highest posession.\n\nBravely your banner plows through the seas,\n\nwherever your warrior goes, people give him honor and glory\n\nthrows the storms a foreign ship to your beach,\n\nthe band of maritime pilots faithfully recover it.\n\nwhoever nears your fires feels instantly,\n\nthat he may be at home here, he considers himself lucky;\n\nguids him his wanderstaff through all countries,\n\nyou'll stay his most favorite, my Oldenburg!\n\nThe Flag shown is the Oldenburg Flag (blue with red cross) and the coat of arms in the middle, double red stripe on yellow ground (Kaiser henry IV of the HRE put two of his fingers into the blood of a slain lion and painted the stripes on the golden shield of the victorious knight acording to legend). the cross on blue ground has been added with the inclusion of the realm of Delmenhorst into the Dutchy. Some people here actually fly the old flag still.\n\nWhat beorna said about the Main is essentially true. There is the so called Weißwurst Äquator (white sausage equator) here a wiki link for a quick explanation:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weißwurstäquator\n\nI know the bavarians as northern italy, not so much as northern africa but ... whats the difference between african banana republics and whatever berlusconi does in italy anyways?\n\nAs the link states, in northern german low german is spoken, in southern german its ofen a variant of upper german. Then theres standard german and various dialects of which i have no idea what kind of language they are.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7a6ak8QggY\"]YouTube - Ein Wetterchen![/ame]\n\nHere a sketch with various german dialects and also how various germans culturally react to the same rainy weather (from my region reacting with indifference and the bavarians reacting with outrage towards it and the east prussians with happiness that there are neither sandstorms nor flooding) Also watch the borders of the weather card. *cough* 1973.\n\nAnimosities are generally not as big as one could suspect when people talk. Bavaria is a kind of special case though, not in sofar that they truly want out or anything but because of its history. Bavaria was the second biggest kingdom of the German Reich after Prussia and normally favored the Austrians over the Prussians. Today, Bavaria is the only Free state in germany, every other state is just \"state of Lower saxony\" or \"state of Bremen\". They retained some other special rights, like some nominal control over the bundeswehr within bavaria, there is a bavarian constitution and bavarian citizenship. Those are basicaly carry overs from the Reich when german citizenship was just awarded when one bacame citizen of a country of the Reich. Nowadays its the other way around, one becomes citizen of germany and gets citizenship of the EU as an additional citizenship.\n\nWithin Bavaria there is a region called \"Franken\", franconia. They live within bavaria but dont take well to being called bavarians. They are Francs. Those regionalities that are not overlapping with the state structure of germany are even older than the former souvereign kingdoms, they are carry overs from the german tribes. The francs consider themselves distinct from the bavarians due to modern tribalism to put it a bit over the top.\n\n[ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia\"]Franconia - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nAnother example would be the animosity between the people of the palantine and of Swabia. Kohl was from the palantine.... it was a hard time for swabia back then... The best friend of the swabian is the frenchman.\n\nWhile generally there is often an overlapping of states or administrative regions with tribal settlement structures in the south, in the north there is much less of such things as prussia was - unlike bavaria or saxony - not a state of one tribe, it was multi-tribal. Lower Saxony for instance has to my knowledge nothing like any tribal structure and the state itself is rather new (after WWII) with no real previous kingdom or state to relate to. The anthem of Lower Saxony is however already from the 1920s, before the state was constructed and from the Wandervogel movement.\n\n[ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandervogel\"]Wandervogel - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nI knid of envision something like that for the EU with extensive country rights and a federal EU structure to take responsibility where a mere national solution falls short. As an example:\n\nRegional:\n\nIt doesnt make sense to have car emission legislation for inner cities made from Brusseles because Brusseles does laws that are equal to all europeans. However, a german city is different from a british city and London is different from brighton. General suggestions and broad guidelines that are then put into national law acording to the state of the country make more sense there. In germanys case it would make most sense to delegate that kind of legislation towards state parliaments. In the UKs case it'd make sense to delegate it to the devolved parliaments and in France... there is nothing but the national parliament afaik.\n\nEU level:\n\nOn the other hand, banking regulation can not reasonably be done on a level of the german states or the scotish or waleish parliament. Even just on german national level it falls kind of short...There, a european solution would be preferable, if we can find a working compromise.\n\nNational level:\n\nAlso, one can not expect the EU to have a truly united working market. I cant expect a greek to go to Poland to find work and demand that he does so or I cut his unemployment benefits. This is not do-able and thus this should stay national. Its entirely possible to demand of a german to change residency from one german state to another, but not to learn french and change residency to france.\n\nThanks guys.\n\nFor Solidaires question as to why the germans voted for merkel:\n\nMerkel was voted in for the first term in a head-to-head race against Chancelor Schröder (although he is now executive of an oil company and i feel bad calling him with a lower grade title than executive, the sell-out. Once car salesman, always car salesman )\n\nSchröder was of the social democrats (SPD) and governed with the greens. Both parties are supposed to be more pacifistic than the CDU but still went for afghanistan and kosovo. Personally I think kosovo was ok, afghanistan i can overlook partially as shock induced. I would still like my government to not make decisions based on emotional shock when its about the lifes of our citizens, even if those citizens wear uniform.\n\nSo those decisions didnt exactly fly too well with their voters. They also embarked on a quest to cut the wellfare back, not exactly something you expect social democrats to do... voters where dissapointed there too. Finally, it has been mentioned that company officials can actually be lend to public services to support decision makeing. This was introduced by Schröder and then flew out again under Merkel. Schröder thought it would cut costs since then you could lend experts from the private sector, pay them for their work (so as to not have them dependend on their old company) and after that give them back. As you can imagine, people knew fully well that they where in civil service only a short time and even if paid by the government then they knew that they'd work for their company again later so their loyalty did lie there.\n\nThose are only the bad parts of Schröder, if someone (beorna?) wants to write something positive about him I'll let that person do it instead... from my view (I'm conservative) he brought germany out in the world by Kosovo for instance and while I think he sold out by becoming part of that oil company I believe Russia to be the most moral place germany can get its oil and gas. The arab kingdoms are way worse than russia from a human rights perspective, also we need russia inside europe, not necessarily within the EU though.\n\nRussia supports the whole east of europe with energy, germany gets only some 10% of its energy by russian gas (20% of german energy is gas energy, 40% of that gas is russian => less than 10%). Ukraine is nearly 100% dependend on russia, Poland got about a third of its energy from russia iirc. So russia is like germany after WWII. not very much liked but as shown by the morgenthau plan, europe couldnt recover without german steel, coal and industry.\n\nLikewise eastern europe cant get up to western europes standard without russia. I would prefer us to figure that out without a russian morgenthau plan where we hang russia and the east in concert until we realize that we need russia. A bit western humility would be in order in my opinion, we cant deny reality and build up the east by magic west sorcery. That about the positive things about Schröder from my side.\n\nSo, Merkel got voted in the first time then because mainly out of spd weakness. However, the SPD was still so strong and the FDP (see above) so weak that the normal CDU-FDP coalition was not possible. the left cant form a government with the CDU, they dont like oneanother and the CDU refuses to even talk to the left. The greens wherent willing to ally with the FDP so CDU-FDP-Green was also impossible.\n\nThat left the Grand Coalition... CDU-SPD. This coalition was led by the CDU because the Union had slightly (whiskers breath) more voters. we're talking about 0.2% or so. Schröder managed to look liken an ... even then, by arguing that he should be the new chancelor again... and not arguing very nicely.\n\nThe Grand Coalition was largely succesfull actually, in my opinion. Merkel is by nature a somewhat careful person and - unlike other politicians - keeps her trap shut for some time before coming out. This means that \"minor\" politicians would state their opinion on things and the chancelor would be silent. Then, when the people spoke and it emerged on what side of an argument they where, Merkel just said she also supports that. Genious in its simplicity if I may say so. This style, somewhat presidential, now hurts her. Before, CDU and SPD would quarrel with the CDU pulling right and the SPD pulling left. She could then emerge in the middle and be seen as a good moderator. Now, we have CDU and FDP so we got two parties pulling right... she cant agree half with the opposition and half with her own party, can she. So the style that served her so well in the past is now unusable, she just looks indecisive and weak with the coalition quarreling on and on.\n\nMrs Merkel herself I would characterize as a manipulative person with less negativity than the word normally implies. She is cautious enough to wait until at least some facts emerge which I aplaud her for. As said before, I resent senseless activity just to get a good photo-ops and some cheap votes (Look, the president is doing something! Must be the right thing then, because doing nothing and waiting for facts is always wrong.)\n\nLately she seems to have finally gotten the clue and got more agressive. This is needed, since IMO its the weakness of the coalition that makes the opposition gain votes, not their own strenght. They dont even have a good candidate, even SPD voters in my surroundings see that.\n\nThe last election, the FDP got votes after years out of office because of the financial crisis in my opinion. They are the german economical party (read: they are for the rich ruleing us all) and anxity made people vote for them, as well as the aforementioned german voting system. Its easy to vote second vote (the party vote) CDU and then first vote (constituency) FDP to let the FDP get some seats they wouldnt normally get. That tactic is well known and often employed.\n\nMore importantly though, and I'm sure beornawill agree there, the election buildup was a joke. German election campaings are traditionally much shorter than the US ones but the most recent one was boring beyond belive. There was nothing! No facts, no fights, no anything.\n\nSPD and CDU where in the grand coalition so they couldnt say that the government sucks. Greens and FDP hoped for \"their partner\" to win and thus also didnt do too much to fight against \"their\" part of government, the FDP couldnt really critizise the CDU and the greens couldnt berate the SPD because if they would then they risked that again the voters would elect in a way that only a grand coalition could emerge. so both minor parties chose to not critizise the grand coalition too much. Splendid.\n\nLong story short, CDU was having the chancelor bonus, economy was \"in danger\", victory for the conservatives and the liberals.\n\nThey went on to not govern for some month so they wouldnt loose the Bundesrat (state parliament) and because of that lost it and then chose to engage one another in name calling (calling one another wild pigs). Still the opposition is barely at 50%... IMO that says all about the weakness of the SPD and the Greens at the moment.\n\nFor Brandt, which you mentioned Solidaire... i like him. While I consider myself conservative i can vote for the SPD, no problem. I support various social concepts and am for wage raises. not that the government can press wage raises through. However, Brandt was in another time... the SPD then is not the SPD now and the world then is not the world now.\n\nGERMANS! We can be proud of our country! Vote Willy Brandt.\n\nImpossible for the modern SPD to say. Not because they would be ripped appart or something... but because they would never think of anything like that. They left patriotism, a field they actually engaged in before wide open. so far open in fact that the CDU doesnt even has to do campains on patriotism, they win that without even trying. Likewise, other concepts that where SPD back then are CDU now. Germany has gotten more social than back then, also because back then unemployment was lower and people wherent demanding things like child care centers and so on. The world changes and the old time wont come back. We've got new and different challanges nowadays, the old times of full employment and looking for fair wages for everyone are gone, now we need fair wages for everyone and also more employment. This is much harder, since you need companies to hire... for working is also a part of human dignity and selfrespect.\n\nI am a bit too young to be nostalgic about Brandt since I wasnt born then but i fully subscribe to the idea that the economic policy of a government must be aimed at the dignity of its people, the fairness towards it people and the happiness of its people. It must never be aimed at growing GDP. For what is inherently positive about growing GDP? You want to have growing prosperity of your people, and the vessel to asure that is growing GDP. GDP by itself is worthless, you can as well just reintroduce slavery. So growing GDP can never be a primary goal of economic policy, it must always be a secondary one.. a means towards a more happy people. Short time and partial time working does not acomplish that. they grow GDP all right but not to the benefit but to the expense of the people. That short cut is wrong in my opinion...\n\nHowever, the social market economy of germany was made by Erhardt and agumented by the governments ever after and all german parties subscribe to it. Sadly they seem to have lost their way a bit. So one can be conservative and still subscribe to those ideas here.\n\n[ame]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine_Capitalism[/ame]\n\n[ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_model\"]German model - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nI visited Germany, for the first time, this year. I spent 8 days in Berlin and Leipzig. Berlin is overwhelmed with WW2 historical sites and monuments. I'd been all over the city to discover this historical place which determined European history from 1945 and onwards! I was very much impressed.\n\nLeipzig, on the other hand is a place for those who are into more picturesque cities. There is a huge annual Gothic meeting too.\n\nThere is one thing I want to ask kimi: How do Germans view Austrians? As a brotherly nation? As..inferior? As German wannabes maybe\n\nHmmm… the Schluchtenscheisser you say. (Schlucht = canyon; scheisser = somebody who is taking a dump; meaning they don't have modern technology and use outhouses over some canyon)\n\nWell, as said germany is very regional. Accordingly theres no true \"german\" and no true \"how do germans feel about…\". The Bavarians are direct neighbours and fought together with the Austrians against other germans quite often. 30 year war for instance. But then again, the Austrians fought against napoleon while the Bavarians fought with napoleon against the northern germans and Austrians. So theres some rubs but vastly more common things between Bavarians and Austrians. They really like one another I think. Both call us Prussians or Piefkes.\n\nMe, as a northern german don't share as much with the austrians. Northern germany is protestant, Austria is catholic. Not that this has any real bearing nowadays any more. They speak a very Bavarian-like dialect. We don't. So, while the Bavarians sometimes jokingly say they would rather be part of Austria than germany, for the north its not so. They are \"down there\" with the Bavarians. South of the white sausage equator.\n\nGenerally though, Austrians are fellow german speakers, have a fellow germanic culture and there is very active exchange of ideas. They too are a federal republic, have a bundeswehr, a bundeskanzler, a bundestag, a bundesadler… its all very similar, only named \"Austrian\" instead of \"german\". German Bundeswehr vs Austrian Bundeswehr. Civil code is also based on the german BGB. We use the old Austrian imperial anthem as our anthem, also its said that the greatest deed the Austrians ever pulled was to make Hitler into a german and Beethoven into an Austrian.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bürgerliches_Gesetzbuch\n\nBGB got around quite a bit actually.\n\nThis understanding of other people and how it varies over germany is a general phenomenon. The people of the Saar are feeling very connected with the French, my \"uncle\" Claude is French and married a german. We adopted one another families and my mother is from the saar region. Here, in Oldenburg however we're much more pro-dutch than pro-French because they are so close and we have similar cuisines and languages and often cross border to shop, as do they. In the Saar the german cuisine is much more French and alsac or lorhaine like. In the east of germany the culture gets more Slavic. This includes cuisine and the character of the people. German people near france are getting more talkative, northern germans are ... lets say more stoic (although the word of choice is mundfaul, mouth-lazy).\n\nHowever, this shouldn't be seen as extremely strong, they all still identify as germans if push comes to shove (as easily seen in centuries of war, the saar people like the French but are not willing to join france, we like the dutch but will not become dutch… I like my brother but will not become exactly like my brother?)"
