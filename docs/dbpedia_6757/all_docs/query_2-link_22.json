        "text": "LOCATION:\n\nPfaffendorfer Stra√üe 29, D-04105 Leipzig, Germany\n\nPhone: 0049 341 5933303\n\nURL: http://www.zoo-leipzig.de\n\nKEY WORDS\n\nAfrica, artificial rock, barrier, cave, kopje\n\nANIMALS:\n\nFamily:Species:Common Name:Capacity: Felidae Panthera Leo African Lion 6 Muridae Acomys Spiny Mouse\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nSince Zoo Leipzig's foundation in 1878, lions have been a main component of the collection and the zoo has been the most successful in Europe in breeding them. The breeding of lions at the zoo culminated around 1900, when lions were in demand by zoos, menageries, and circuses. In the mid-twentieth century, the zoo specialized in breeding the rare Barbary subspecies. This ended with the death of the last animal in 2000.\n\nThe cat house, built in 1901, and its outdoor enclosure, built in 1928, were long out-dated for today's standards of lion keeping. These were changed into an education center.\n\nBecause of the strong tradition of lions at the zoo and the significance of lions for Leipzig (Leipzig has a lion in its coat of arms), a lion exhibit was included in the zoo's master plan.\n\nMakasi Simba was built as part of the zoo's master plan (1999 - 2014) offering experiences of different continents. Makasi Simba is part of the Africa section, near to the meerkats and the savannah panorama.\n\nThe exhibit has five indoor boxes. The building is hidden in a slope, with artificial rock covering the walls and doors. One of the boxes can be viewed by the public through a window inside the viewing cave. The cave also affords views to the outdoor enclosure and to a spiny mouse exhibit. The outdoor exhibit has four types of barriers: water moat, dry moat, artificial cave with glass panels, and, along the backside of the exhibit, a fence barrier. There is no visitor viewing from the backside. The railing on the visitor side of the moat is low to the ground and made of wood sticks. An electric fence along the edge of the water on the visitor side serves as a second barrier in case a lion decides to cross the water moat.\n\nThe main feature of the outdoor exhibit is the kopje rock outcropping. Underneath the rocks is an artificial cave with floor heating, which faces the visitors' cave. Waterfalls, in both the visitor and animal areas, add the sound of flowing water and re-circulate water through the moat - conserving water and preventing freezing in cold temperatures. The enclosure area is covered with long grass and contains trees, logs, and bamboo grasses.\n\nSIZE:\n\nThe moat comprises about 1/4 of the space of the animal's outdoor enclosure. The lions do not enter the water, so this feature serves as a barrier and aesthetic feature.\n\nSpace allocation in square metres:\n\nUse:Indoors:Outdoors:Total Exhibit: accessibletotalaccessibletotal animals1638251,1001,263 visitors404040 others9393 total255.51,1401,396\n\nCOSTS:\n\nFunding came from three sources: 1/3 from the city, 1/3 from Friends of the Zoo, and 1/3 from a year-long supplement to the zoo's entry price specifically for this purpose.\n\nEuro 1,430,000 including 19% for design.\n\nOPENING DATE:\n\n8 February 2001\n\nDESIGN:\n\nBeginning: February 1999\n\nArchitecture/Landscape Architecture: Rasbach , Oberhausen, Germany\n\nArtificial Rock: Uwe Turner and Professor Ado , Verona, Italy\n\nCONSTRUCTION:\n\nBeginning: 2 April 2000\n\nGlass Work: ER & TE Stahl-u. Metallbau GmbH, Zerbst, Germany\n\nGreen Roof: Mueller Garden, Landscape, and Sportsfield Builders GmbH, Markleeberg, Germany\n\nPlanting: SEC, Leipzig, Germany\n\nArtificial Rock: Uwe Turner and Professor Ado, Verona, Italy\n\nLOCAL CONDITIONS:\n\nThis is a climatic diagram for the closest weather station.\n\nPLANTS:\n\nThe plant list specifies the Latin names of the plants used for this exhibit.\n\nFEATURES DEDICATED TO ANIMALS:\n\nThe kopje (rock outcropping) provides the animals with a high place from which they can overview their surroundings. Beneath the kopje, a cave has a heated floor for comfort in cold winter. A sand pit near the glass viewing window is heated from below.\n\nFEATURES DEDICATED TO KEEPERS:\n\nAll doors in the lion holding area are mechanically controlled. This type of door is easier to control than the electric one and can be opened and closed quicker. A storage room is provided with easy access to supplies.\n\nFEATURES DEDICATED TO VISITORS:\n\nA cave at one of the viewing points provides protection from the weather, while offering views into the night/winter holding areas for the lions and into a spiny mouse exhibit. The stone of the cave was designed by artists. It has paintings on it to enhance a feeling of weathering.\n\nINTERPRETATION:\n\nA large sign at the cave entrance illustrates hunting strategies of lions and signs in the cave inform about the two displayed species, lions and spiny mice.\n\nThe outside visitor space features an interactive game that shows which animal species profit from the lions' prey.\n\nA space on the green roof of the cave serves keepers with amplifiers at their daily talks during feeding times when they tell facts about the animals, their exhibit and conservation efforts of zoos.\n\nMANAGEMENT:\n\nThe water in the moat is circulated to prevent freezing over in winter.\n\nFood is often hung from the tree in the exhibit for enrichment.\n\nRESEARCH:\n\nIn a joint effort with the Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, the zoo researches genetic sub-species of lions. The set up of a new European Studbook (ESB) for an African lion subpopulation of known origin will be managed by Zoo Leipzig.\n\nCONSERVATION:\n\nThe holding building has a green roof, which decreases heat radiation and helps the building blend into the landscape. The water in the moat and waterfall is recycled."
