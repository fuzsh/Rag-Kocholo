        "text": "Chemotherapy. It's not a word people want to hear and certainly not something they want to go through. But, for those of us with cancer, we often don't have a choice.\n\nI remember how terrified I was of getting my first chemotherapy treatment.\n\nWould I be sick? Would I have a reaction to the medication? Would I be in a room by myself or with other chemo patients?\n\nI really didn't know what to expect the first day. However, almost 4 years later, I feel like a pro.\n\nPreparing for chemotherapy\n\nFirst, you may be told to show up a couple of hours early to get blood work drawn. This is to make sure you're able to get your chemotherapy treatment.\n\nIt can be a pain, but, believe me, it's in your best interest.\n\nUse the extra time to relax before you go to your chemotherapy appointment.\n\nWhen you arrive at the infusion floor and they have your lab results and a room available, you'll be called back to have your vital signs taken.\n\nOnce you are cleared at the vitals station, you will be taken to your chemotherapy room for your infusion.\n\nAt MD Anderson, you will have a TV, Internet access, a bed or a recliner and best of all warm blankets.\n\nThey also have food service at lunch and dinner if you're hungry.\n\nAt MD Anderson, you're allowed to have one caregiver with you in the infusion room.\n\nGetting started with chemotherapy\n\nOnce you're in the infusion suite, the nurse will order your chemotherapy cocktail and any pre-medications that are required from the pharmacy.\n\nIt usually takes at least 30 minutes for the drugs to arrive. Some of the pre-medications may be steroids, anti-nausea medications and/or anxiety medications.\n\nEach doctor will send an order to the infusion room telling them what chemotherapy and pre-medications to administer.\n\nIn the meantime, your nurse will access your \"Power Port\" or \"Port a Cath,\" if you have one, or will just start an IV in your arm.\n\nYour nurse will begin with a saline solution through your IV.\n\nAs soon as the medications are delivered, your nurse will hang the bags of medication on the IV stand and then start the different IVs.\n\nYou'll be given pre-medications first, then the chemotherapy.\n\nWhat does chemotherapy feel like?\n\nThe steroids may give you energy; the allergy drugs and anti-anxiety drugs may make you sleepy.\n\nIt's important that you have a caregiver with you to get you to and from chemotherapy the first time, as you don't know how you'll feel after you're done.\n\nThe length of time for chemotherapy regimens can range from 5 minutes to 8 or more hours. It all depends on the chemotherapy.\n\nThroughout the chemotherapy, your nurse will come in and check your vitals and make sure you aren't reacting to the medications.\n\nIn the meantime, use your infusion time to relax, visit, eat, work, whatever you want to do.\n\nThe IV stand will even roll with you in case you want to take a walk or sit outside.\n\nAfter the chemotherapy is finished, the nurse will \"flush\" your IV line with saline and then de-access your port or take out your IV.\n\nThey may have you wait 30 minutes after the chemotherapy is done to make sure you don't have any reactions to the medications.\n\nAt that point, you can go home. Again, depending on your pre-medications and chemotherapy, you may have lots of energy or may feel very sleepy later in the day.\n\nRachel Midgett is a 41-year-old stage IV breast cancer patient. Her journey started with her trying to get pregnant by IVF (in vitro fertilization). She was about to start round 2 of IVF when she found a cyst on her left breast. The cyst ended up being benign, but underneath the cyst was a 4.5 cm malignant tumor.\n\nShe underwent a radical mastectomy of her left breast and started chemotherapy treatments that same week. As devastating as her prognosis may be, she has faith that God will heal her and give her a miracle."
