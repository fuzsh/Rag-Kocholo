        "text": "A time zone is a region if the planet that observes a uniform standard of time for commercial, social and legal purposes. GMT and IST are two such time zones\n\nGreenwich Mean Time (GMT) is the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London which is measured at midnight. In English speaking nations, GMT is often used synonymously with Universal Time Coordinate (UTC).\n\nIndian Standard Time (IST) is the time zone observed throughout India. It does not take into account daylight saving time along with other seasonal factors. India has only one time zone.\n\n*IST is ahead of GMT by 5:30 Hours.\n\nIn this article, we will examine the differences between the GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) and IST (Indian Standard Time). They both are recurring terms under the Geography segment of the IAS Exam.\n\nDifferences between GMT and IST\n\nGMT (Greenwich Mean Time)\n\nIST (Indian Standard Time)\n\nThe Greenwich Mean Time was established by the Royal Observatory in 1675 with the purpose of assisting navigators at sea. The Indian Standard Time was established as the official time zone of India upon its independence on August 15th, 1947 When calculating GMT it is considered equivalent to UT1 (the modern form of mean solar time at 0° longitude), but this meaning can differ from UTC by up to 0.9 seconds. The IST is calculated on the basis of a clock tower in Mirzapur (with coordinates 25.15° North Latitude and 82.58° East longitude). Because of Earth’s uneven angular velocity in its elliptical orbit, GMT is rarely the exact moment the Sun crosses the Greenwich meridian Official time signals are generated by the Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory at the National Physical Laboratory in New Delhi, for both commercial and official use. The signals are based on atomic clocks and are synchronised with the worldwide system of clocks Since legal, political and geographical criteria, are used in the drawing of time zones, actual time zones do not precisely adhere to meridian lines.\n\nThe same holds true for GMT as well because there will be discrepancies between legal and geographic GMT\n\nThe IST is insufficient to cover the geographical expanse of India.\n\nThe reason is that such is the east-west distance covers about 2933 kilometres and 29 degrees of longitude resulting in the sun rising and setting almost two hours earlier on the eastern borders of India than its western borders.\n\nThe proposals to divide the country into different timezones have been taken into consideration by the government of India as of late to overcome this drawback.\n\nThe term Greenwich Mean Time is used commonly in the United Kingdom and in the Commonwealth of Nations such as Australia, New Zealand and many other countries of the Eastern Hemisphere Indian Standard Time is used observed in India and Sri Lanka but it takes references from the UTC (Universal Time Coordinate). The UTC has been developed as a successor to the Greenwich Mean Time\n\nAspirants can find study materials for the Geography segment of the UPSC Exams through the links given below\n\nNCERT Notes for UPSC Geography\n\nGeography Syllabus for UPSC Exam\n\nTricks to Study Geography for UPSC Exam\n\nDifference Between Physical and Human Geography\n\nFree NCERT Geography Books for UPSC\n\n100 Difference Between Articles\n\nDifference Between GMT and IST – Download PDF Here\n\nBecome familiar with the general pattern of the UPSC Exams by visiting the UPSC Syllabus page.

It runs through the countries of India and Sri Lanka. Those in the time zone also refer to it as Indian or India Time (IT) and Indian Standard Time (IST).India and Sri Lanka remain on India Standard Time all year long and do not make any changes for Daylight Saving.\n\nQ2\n\nHow many time zones are in India?\n\nThere is only one time zone across the whole of India. The time zone is calculated according to the longitude of 82.5° E. at Shankargarh Fort in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh, which was picked as the central meridian for India. The Assam government wanted to introduce a separate time zone across the whole state and the other northeast Indian states. A campaign was started in 2014 but it’s yet to be approved by the Central Government of India. The government is keen to retain one time zone to prevent confusion and safety issues (railway operations and flights).In many places in India, the sun rises and sets much earlier than official working hours. Sunrise is as early as 4 a.m. and sunset by 4 p.m. in northeast India, resulting in a loss of daylight hours and productivity.\n\nQ3\n\nDoes India need 2 time zones?\n\nA proposal for two time zones has come from India’s national timekeeper itself. Scientists at the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research’s National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL), which maintains Indian Standard Time, have published a research article describing the necessity of two time zones, with the new one an hour ahead of the existing time zone. In a reply to a question in Parliament, the government said it has not taken any decision on separate time zones. A committee set up in 2002 did not recommend two time zones because of the complexities involved\n\nQ4\n\nWhich country has most time zones?\n\nThe country with the most time zones is France (12 time zones), mostly due to its various territories around the world. The United States and Russia are tied for second place with eleven time zones each.\n\nQ5\n\nWhat is GMT?\n\nGMT or Greenwich Mean Time is the time measured on Earth’s 0 degree longitude which passes through Old Royal Observatory near London. The 0 degree longitude runs from the North Pole to the South Pole and is referred to as the Greenwich Meridian since 1884.\n\nRelevant Links\n\nUPSC Mains General Studies Paper 1 Syllabus, Strategy & Structure Difference between Advancing and Retreating Monsoon Previous Years Geography Questions in UPSC Mains General Studies Paper- 1 Topic-Wise General Studies Paper-1 Questions in UPSC Mains"
