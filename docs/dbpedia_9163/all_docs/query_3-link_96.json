        "text": "Capture started getting slow about 4-5 days ago (just a couple of seconds) but not affecting the game but since yesterday, with no drivers, windows update or any software changes, capture takes up to 3 minutes, freezing the game while trying to hook but eventually makes it through.\n\nOS: Win10 21H2 64 bits\n\nCapture method: Game Capture\n\nGame: Monster Hunter World, DX12 API. It does the exact same with DX11.\n\nOverlays: None (except Win10 general overlay that can't be disabled).\n\nI used to have the game with RTSS enabled and was one of the few games in which it worked fine since RTSS blocks OBS Game Capture most of the time in other titles. Disabled it since the issue appeared because I thought that could be the root of the problem but it didn't change anything. Also at some point I reenabled it and it did capture the game after the 2-3 min wait, it seems pretty random if capture works with RTSS overlay on, it does work (after the 3 min wait) without it every time.\n\nThe bigger puzzle to me was how the slower capture a few days ago and the gigantic freeze and slow capture issue I have now both popped up with apparently no changes to OS (no updates as far as I'm aware, also not showing any on Windows Update history), no changes to software (nothing has been installed nor uninstalled), no updates/settings change to OBS and no changes to the game (old game so no updates).\n\nLog: https://obsproject.com/logs/lwm6VDb_tyhustot\n\nI forgot to mention, this is the only game I see with this issue atm, tried others (DiRT Rally DX11, Vermintide 2 DX12, Dota DX11, Jupiter Hell Vulkan) and none showed the slow capture issue.\n\nMore data, If I start OBS after the game is running with a scene with no game capture associated to the game and switch to the scene with the Game Capture for Monster Hunter World, it also takes a long time to capture:\n\nLog: https://obsproject.com/logs/yMv6ip82w0NdoSPk\n\nBut if I start OBS with the Game Capture active it hooks immediately:\n\nLog: https://obsproject.com/logs/0uGmlfmRYFe4CjhS\n\nAt least a workaround but not ideal if you are switching from something else to this game.\n\nThis is getting worse with no changes to the PC.\n\nAfter a session earlier OBS did not manage to capture the game again so I nuked my profiles and scenes and started from scratch. It captured immediately (opening OBS after the game was running) but only did it once, after that I got this:\n\nLog: https://obsproject.com/logs/N5y3Idg5TgHBXC1x\n\n10 mins delay to capture. I have absolutely no idea what could be the issue.\n\nThe resolution is just an output resolution. Is closer to the effective size of a theater mode stream on a 1080p monitor. Not sure how's relevant, it does the same on 720p or 1080p.\n\nWhat's the point of an active stream for the capture? The log shows the capture issue, an active stream of this would be a black screen for 10 mins but here it is:\n\nLog: https://obsproject.com/logs/a1ZU8EldfAhqNEdy\n\nThe bind ip seems to be the default setting (since I did a full reinstall of OBS and wiped AppData stored settings before setting this scene up)."
