        "meta_description": "Immured by Meantime, released 14 August 2023\n\nAnother night spent alone, \nin this prison I make my home. \nWith Shaking hands I carve in stone, \nanother song about being alone. \nWith shaking hands I break my bones. \nTo make mind off of the unknown. \nWith broken broken teeth clenched so tight, I grit and bear another night. \nDays and hours mean nothing to me,\nI punched the clock, just so I could bleed.\nHopes and aspirations, just fragmented dreams.\nBarely remember who I used to be. \nLocked myself up and lost the key,\nConfined again with so much ease.\nI’ve given up on being free\nThis fucking cage comforts.\nBut when did I stop putting up a fight, \nWhen did these chains get so tight?\nWhen did I lose my fucking sight?\nI don’t want to suffer another night. \nDays and hours mean nothing to me,\nI punched the clock, just so I could bleed.\nHopes and aspirations, just fragmented dreams.\nBarely remember who I used to be. \nSet me free",
