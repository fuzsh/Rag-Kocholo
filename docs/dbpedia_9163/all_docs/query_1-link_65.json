It additionally reached number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 29 on the UK Singles Chart while reaching the top 50 in Australia, Canada, Iceland, New Zealand and Sweden.\n\nMeaning\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a 2018 interview, lead singer Royston Langdon said:\n\nIt's me trying to reach people. It's using some kind of metaphor of a worldly or inner-worldly search for the end of isolation, and the acceptance of one's self is in there. At the end of the day it's saying whatever you gotta do, it's OK, it's alright. And I think that's also me talking to myself, getting through my wan anxieties and fear of death. That's what it all comes down to. What's so beautiful about it is that it continues to connect with people.[3]\n\nTrack listings and formats\n\n[edit]\n\nUS CD and cassette single[4][5]\n\n\"In the Meantime\" – 5:01\n\n\"To Be a Millionaire...
