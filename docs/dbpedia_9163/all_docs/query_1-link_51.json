        "text": "The Borderlands movie adaptation was in production for a long time, but now it seems like the result is not what the filmmakers expected, as its first reviews are pretty scathing. Immediately after the film’s premiere, attendees have started sharing their opinions on the videogame adaptation, and all signs point to it being “a disaster”.\n\n“BORDERLANDS is a disaster. Filled with every cliché you can ponder, this film swaps the mayhem and imagination of the games for a lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud with annoying characters and a cast with not one ounce of chemistry,” said Adriano Caporusso of Bitesize Break.\n\n“The Borderlands Movie is a baffling video game adaptation. There is potential for great world building, but it never happens due to a rushed and dull screenplay; the set design is impressive but the film looks cheap due to poor CGI,” states Darren Movie Reviews in a tweet. “Cate Blanchett, Ariana Greenblatt and Jack Black are all great, even if their characters are underdeveloped and the majority of the jokes fall flat; and while the video game carries a M rating, the film carries a PG-13 rating and you can tell it forced Eli Roth into an uncomfortable space as he tried to create a fun and bizarre space adventure. Not bad, but utterly forgettable.”\n\n“As predictable as films come these days,” said Kurt Morrison from Movie Scene Canada. “Borderlands is borderline unwatchable. With such great talent in front and behind the camera, it’s astonishing to me that this ended up being the finished product. Blanchett and Hart are having a lot of fun here & save this from being a trainwreck. Geared to be a franchise starter, it’ll be a big surprise if this film finds an audience.”\n\nMatthew Simpson, a reporter from Awesome Friday!, said: “Oh hey, I can tell you I’ve seen #BorderlandsMovie now, and that it’s really bad. I really wanted to like it, but an uninspired plot + several phoned in performances + being stuck in a weird place where it looks both expensive and cheap a the same time make it a huge misfire.”\n\nThe Borderlands movie is officially releasing in theaters around the world on August 9, at which point we should also see a new influx of impressions and in-depth reviews that may paint a fuller picture. In the meantime, these first looks at the film are not very flattering."
