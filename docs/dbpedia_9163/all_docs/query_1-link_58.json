        "text": "Taylor Swift is giving her fans an early Christmas present. And no, it's not Reputation TV!\n\nSwift took to social media Monday morning to announce that her hit concert film \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" will be available to stream in just over two weeks. On her birthday!\n\n“Well, so, basically I have a birthday coming up and I was thinking a fun way to celebrate the year we’ve had together would be to make The Eras Tour Concert Film available for you to watch at home!,” Swift wrote on X/Twitter.\n\n“Very happy to be able to tell you that the extended version of the film including ‘Wildest Dreams,’ ‘The Archer’ and ‘Long Live’ will be available to rent on demand in the US, Canada & additional countries to be announced soon starting on … you guessed it, December 13.”\n\nThe film’s theatrical release has been a major success as the film’s box office grosses passed $232 million globally earlier this month, AMC CEO Adam Aron said last week.

There has yet to an announcement on how much the movie will cost to rent.\n\nWhat songs were added to the 'Eras Tour' film?\n\nThe three songs added to the movie are “Wildest Dreams,” “The Archer” and “Long Live.”\n\nSadly, \"Cardigan\" and \"Tis the Damn Season (which was replaced by \"No Body, No Crime\" during the SoFi dates)\" are still left in the dust.\n\nWhat are the songs in the 'Eras Tour' film?\n\nWith the additional songs added to the lineup, here's what viewers can expect when singing and dancing their hearts out:\n\n\"Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince\"\n\n\"Cruel Summer\"\n\n\"The Man\"\n\n\"You Need to Calm Down\"\n\n\"Lover\"\n\n\"The Archer\"\n\n\"Fearless\"\n\n\"You Belong With Me\"\n\n\"Love Story\"\n\n\"Willow\"\n\n\"Marjorie\"\n\n\"Champagne Problems\"\n\n\"Tolerate It\"\n\n\"Ready For It?\"\n\n\"Delicate\"\n\n\"Don't Blame Me\"\n\n\"Look What You Made Me Do\"\n\n\"Enchanted\"\n\n\"Long Live\"\n\n\"22\"\n\n\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\"\n\n\"I Knew You Were Trouble\"\n\n\"All Too Well (10-Minute Version)\"\n\n\"The 1\"\n\n\"Betty\"\n\n\"The Last Great American Dynasty\"\n\n\"August\"\n\n\"Illicit Affairs\"\n\n\"My Tears Ricochet\"\n\n\"Style\"\n\n\"Blank Space\"\n\n\"Shake it Off\"\n\n\"Wildest Dreams\"\n\n\"Bad Blood\"\n\n\"Lavender Haze\"\n\n\"Anti-Hero\"\n\n\"Midnight Rain\"\n\n\"Vigilante S---\"\n\n\"Bejeweled\"\n\n\"Mastermind\"\n\n\"Karma\"\n\nWhat is the runtime for the film?\n\nIn this new extended version, the run time is now roughly 3 hours instead of 2 hours and 48 minutes.\n\nCan I still go see 'The Eras Tour' movie in Florida theaters?\n\nYes, you can still go see Taylor Swift's movie in the meantime but only up until this weekend on Sunday, Dec. 3. The concert film had just over a four-week run in theaters with showtimes only on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nProspective ticket buyers can still visit AMC Theatres to buy tickets for “The Eras Tour” movie, or access the theater's mobile app. Swift fans can also buy tickets at Cinemark and Regal.\n\nIs there still a chance to see the 'Eras Tour' in Florida or the United States?\n\nIn 2024, the popstar will head back to the U.S. on:\n\nOct. 18-20, 2024: Miami, Hard Rock Stadium\n\nOct. 25-27, 2024: New Orleans, Caesars Superdome\n\nNov. 1-3, 2024: Indianapolis, Lucas Oil Stadium\n\nNov. 14-16, Nov. 21-23, 2024: Toronto, Rogers Centre\n\nHave tickets for the Miami Eras Tour shows gone on sale? Can I still purchase tickets for the Taylor Swift shows in Florida?\n\nTickets to all three of the Miami dates for Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” sold out via Ticketmaster back in September. However, resale tickets are available via StubHub and SeatGeek.\n\nHowever, beware as a majority of these tickets are sold by scalpers above face value, ranging from $900 to $10,000 for seats.\n\nTaylor Swift performed in Florida for Eras Tour 2023. What were Tampa’s surprise songs?\n\nThroughout the Eras Tour, Swift has performed two songs, usually album deep cuts, not on her setlist at each show. She has brought out collaborators like Aaron Dresner, Jack Antonoff and Marcus Mumford to join her on the stage.\n\nShe does not repeat surprise songs on tour unless she messes it up, then it is back in the running to be sung at another show.\n\nThursday, April 13: “Speak now” and “Treacherous”\n\nFriday, April 14: “You’re on You’re Own Kid” and “The Great War”\n\nSaturday, April 15: “Mad Woman” and “Mean”\n\nWhat special dances or chants should I know ahead of time?\n\nUSA TODAY rounded up all of the special dances, chants and outfits to bring out during the Eras tour. Some of the top ones are:\n\n'Delicate' chant\n\nAt the start of \"Delicate,\" right after Swift sings \"We can't make any promises now can we, babe? But you can make me a drink,\" fans have taken to yelling: \"One, two, three, let's go b----!\" The chant was popularized after a viral vine.\n\n'Bad Blood' chant\n\nIn 2015, Swift came out with a remix to her hit song \"Bad Blood\" featuring Kendrick Lamar. During the concert, fans repeat a line of Lamar's part during the bridge.\n\nIn the \"Anti-Hero\" remix with Bleachers' frontman Jack Antonoff, he sings \"Taylor, you'll be fine\" after Swift sings \"Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman?\" in the second pre-chorus.\n\nFans are singing Antonoff's \"Taylor, you'll be fine\" at the same spot during the concert.\n\n'Bejeweled' dance\n\nA dance move created and made popular by TikTok user @mikael.arellano made its way into Swift's choreography. During \"Bejeweled,\" when Swift sings the word \"shimmer,\" flutter your fingers out in front of you.\n\nWhat other Taylor Swift documentaries can I watch in the meantime?\n\nIf those looking to dig a little deeper into Swift's lore, it’s about time to visit the 2020 documentary \"Miss Americana\" on Netflix.\n\nThe film follows Swift as she creates songs for her 2019 album \"Lover\" and reflects on her rise to fame and her songwriting process. It also gives fans an inside look at footage at her past concerts and gives Swift a spotlight to discuss topics she had never before, such as politics, failures with previous music and her reputation."
