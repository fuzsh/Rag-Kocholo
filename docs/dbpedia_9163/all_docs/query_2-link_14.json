For Clark Comstock and Claire Foley, what began as a class project turned into a major opportunity — their short film \"Kayla Baby\" will premiere at the Slamdance Film Festival on January 22 and 24 in Park City, Utah.",

        "text": "The story follows Kayla, a mostly silent teenager, and her sister Marta, who have been forced to relocate to an abandoned housing development by a menacing being. There, they meet an elderly man named Charles, and a troubled yet energetic teenage boy named Davy. Friendships form and connections deepen as the group eventually realizes they share a common thread (and common adversary) in their exile to this lonely place.\n\nKayla Baby stars CCM Acting students Kenny Rayborn, Nora Kovasckitz, Cyrus Fontenot; Cincinnati local Ayla Cole and Comstock's godfather George Alexander. It also features the work of multiple CCM Media Production students, make-up design by CCM Make-Up and Wig student Tiara Jones and costume design by DAAP student Rachael Olberding. Full production credits are below and on the film's website.\n\nWithout the budget or backing of a Hollywood studio, the student filmmakers got creative.\n\n“The main locations were my parents’ house in Hyde Park and Mt. Storm Park in Clifton,” says Comstock of the filming process. “In order to work with everyone’s schedules, we would shoot for about five or six hours every weekday evening for about three weeks… It was a tough process at times, but I’m very happy with the results.\"\n\nComstock and Foley will travel to Park City, Utah, for the Slamdance Film Festival, held January 19-25 in person and January 22-28 virtually. Since 1995, Slamdance has established itself as one of the world’s premiere independent film festivals. Every year, the festival premieres dozens of cutting-edge features, short films and documentaries, and winners from each category are eligible for Oscar and BAFTA consideration.\n\nComstock, who hopes to continue his directing pursuits and is currently applying to graduate programs. In the meantime, he is a teaching artist at Elementz and teaches video at various rec centers throughout Cincinnati. He hopes to work as a freelance editor and wants to continue working on independent films (he has another project in the works with CCM Acting student Debra Najor). Comstock is grateful for his formative time at CCM:\n\n\"Media Production has been a fantastic program for me,\" he says. \"Don Hancock, Kenneth Allen and Kevin Burke have all been great mentors. They've given me a lot of confidence and a lot of freedom to explore various ideas. Thomas McKee and John Owens have been very supportive as well.\"\n\n\"I'm very thankful to have been a part of such a great program. I look back on my time at CCM, and it was just a constant barrage of great opportunities. I'm very thankful for these instructors, as well as the students. I've gotten to collaborate with so many talented people.\"\n\nTo learn more about Kayla Baby or buy a virtual pass to Slamdance, visit the festival's website."
