I recently reduced a host of paintings and on my website its a button called: ART SALE SALE SALE. If you ever wanted a great piece of art I slashed these to nearly costs and shipping is extra. But creating right now is all I think of. While I'm firing at all cylinders and at a higher vibration Im fascinated at the awesome work coming out. Unfortunately, I can not focus long and thats frustrating.\n\nOnce again I want to say thanks to everyone for the support its humbling and a beautiful experience"
