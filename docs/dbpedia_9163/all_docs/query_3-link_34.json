        "text": "MTTR stands for mean time to repair and is a key maintenance metric that indicates the average time taken to diagnose and rectify faulty equipment. It essentially measures an organization's efficiency in handling and resolving unplanned equipment breakdowns.\n\nThe MTTR encompasses the following steps:\n\nAlerting the technicians about the issue.\n\nDiagnosing the root cause of the problem.\n\nUndertaking necessary repairs.\n\nGiving the equipment time to cool down, if necessary.\n\nReassembling, aligning, and calibrating the equipment.\n\nFinally, setting up, testing, and restarting the equipment for regular production.\n\nNotably, MTTR does not factor in the waiting period for replacement parts.\n\nHow to calculate MTTR\n\nThe MTTR formula is calculated by dividing the total unplanned maintenance (opens in new tab) time spent on an asset by the total number of failures that asset experienced over a specific period. Mean time to repair is most commonly represented in hours.\n\nThe MTTR calculation (opens in new tab) assumes that:\n\nTasks are performed sequentially\n\nTasks are performed by appropriately trained personnel\n\nMTTR\n\n=\n\nTotal maintenance time ÷\n\nNumber of repairs\n\nFor example, if you have spent 50 hours on unplanned maintenance for an asset that has broken down eight times over the course of a year, the mean time to repair would be 6.25 hours.\n\nWhat is considered a world-class MTTR is dependent on several factors, like the type of asset, its criticality (opens in new tab), and its age. However, a good rule of thumb is an MTTR of under five hours.\n\nHow is MTTR used?\n\nMean time to repair is used as a baseline for increasing efficiency, finding ways to limit unplanned downtime, and boosting the bottom line. MTTR helps organizations identify why maintenance may take longer than ideal and make more informed decisions to fix the underlying causes.\n\nExample of MTTR\n\nConsider a beverage manufacturing plant where a crucial piece of machinery breaks down. This machine is responsible for filling bottles, and any delay in its operation directly affects the production line.\n\nUpon breakdown, the clock starts ticking. The maintenance team is alerted, and they begin the process of diagnosing the issue. After an hour, they identify that a specific component has malfunctioned. Fortunately, they have the spare part in stock. It takes another two hours to replace the part, test the machinery, and ensure everything is working as expected. The total time taken from the machine breaking down to it becoming operational again is three hours, making the MTTR for this incident three hours.\n\nIf such breakdowns happen frequently and the MTTR remains high, the plant will consistently miss its production targets, leading to potential order delays and disgruntled customers. However, by tracking MTTR, the plant management can identify patterns. For instance, if the same component is frequently causing the issue, it might be worth investing in a higher-quality replacement or even considering redesigning that part of the machine. Over time, by addressing these root causes, the plant can effectively reduce its MTTR, ensuring smoother operations and satisfied customers.\n\nWhat does MTTR mean for maintenance?\n\nExploring MTTR offers a lens into the intricacies of your maintenance team's equipment procurement, task scheduling, and execution processes. At its core, MTTR aims to identify and eradicate bottlenecks that lead to production halts and the subsequent financial implications. Below are some important ways that MTTR directly influences maintenance teams.\n\nDeciding between repair or replacement\n\nMTTR serves as a pivotal tool in determining whether to repair or replace aging assets. An increasing repair duration for aging assets could be a sign that replacement is the more cost-effective approach. Furthermore, MTTR can guide procurement and design strategies by offering predictions about the lifecycle costs of emerging systems.\n\nOptimizing preventive maintenance schedules\n\nWhile MTTR primarily evaluates reactive maintenance, its insights can enhance preventive maintenance (PM) routines. If certain assets consistently have lengthy repair times, it may hint at ineffective associated PM tasks. MTTR becomes the bridge to discerning the root of such inefficiencies, laying the groundwork for solutions. As an illustration, if MTTR is on the rise, non-standardized PMs could be culprits, escalating equipment breakdowns. For instance, a work order might indicate a part needs lubrication but may omit specifying the lubricant type or quantity. Enriching work orders with these specifics can expedite tasks, cutting down on downtimes.\n\nStreamlining MRO inventory management\n\nAn unusually protracted MTTR might signal inefficiencies in your parts strategy. Disarrayed spares and stockouts are notorious for prolonging repair times. Studies suggest (opens in new tab) that nearly half of all unexpected downtimes are attributable to inadequate spare part availability. Additionally, technicians often spend between 10% to 25% (432kb PDF, opens in new tab) of their time in the quest for elusive parts.\n\nIf particular assets or specific plant areas consistently exhibit extended MTTRs, it’s prudent to scrutinize if parts discrepancies are the culprits. Assess whether essential components are recurrently out of stock, faulty, or incorrectly labeled. Moreover, consider utilizing tools designed to precisely forecast the parts needed for imminent tasks (including unplanned ones) to avert such predicaments in the future."
