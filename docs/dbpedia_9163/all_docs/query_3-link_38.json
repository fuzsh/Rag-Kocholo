Meanwhile, Nancy started to prepare lunch.\n\nJim went to answer the phone. In the meantime, Nancy started to prepare lunch.\n\nJim went to answer the phone. At the same time, Nancy started to prepare lunch.\n\nYou go to do the shopping. ................., I'll clean the house.\n\nAnd for this one, only the first two work, really.\n\nYou go to do the shopping. Meanwhile, I'll clean the house.\n\nYou go to do the shopping. In the meantime, I'll clean the house.\n\nMeanwhile and in the meantime are generally synonymous.\n\nI believe at the same time doesn't work for the second one because no one says that. It's not felicitous. It's possible – definitely grammatical – but unheard of, at least in my non-native opinion. It works in the first sentence because it's a narration and you can be as factual-sounding as you want there, for lack of a better explanation.\n\nSome people have strong opinions about the choice of these expressions. But in reality, all three are used interchangeably and it's a matter of style and personal preference.\n\nHere is a longer discussion of this topic, and another one, from credible sources.\n\nExcerpts from these sources:\n\nMeanwhile and meantime can both be nouns or adverbs and are interchangeable.\n\nAnd\n\nUse the adverb meanwhile to mean \"at the same time.\"\n\nHaving said that, my own preference for the sentences in question would be either \"meanwhile\" or \"in the meantime\", because in both cases (and especially in the second one) there is an implication of until some other thing is completed. The phrase \"at the same time\" does not convey this notion."
