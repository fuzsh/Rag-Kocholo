        "text": "Fourth Friday Film Forum: Silver Linings Playbook To be a person, my friend Andy Root says in his wonderful new book The Relational Pastor, is to be broken. Most of us probably donâ€™t like the sound of that too much, but there is surprising power and freedom in admitting itâ€™s true. For once we stop trying constantly to pretend that we have it all together, that life is just as we want it to be, and that we donâ€™t really need anyone else, then we can open ourselves up to the power of authentic and transformative relationship. While Iâ€™ll review Andyâ€™s book more thoroughly soon, I thought of it as I prepared to write about what was one...\n\nThe second installation of the Hobbit film franchise â€“ 3 films, total screen time equal to or longer than the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy! â€“ opens tomorrow. Thatâ€™s right: Friday the 13th. Despite the ominous date, Iâ€™m optimisticâ€¦if only because I donâ€™t think it can get any worse than the first outing! The problem with the last film? An entirely bloated script that tried way too hard to make us remember the look and feel of the Lord of the Rings instead of simply telling the story at hand. After sitting through more than two-and-a-half hours of plodding plot lines (both the Hobbit proper and as much back-story to LOTR as they...\n\nFifth Friday Film Forum: Catching Fire Spoiler alerts: If you havenâ€™t read Catching Fire or seen the film, you may not want to read this. I have to admit that when I first read Catching Fire and realized that Suzanne Collins was going to send Katniss and Peeta back into the arena to compete in another Hunger Games, I was disappointed. What seemed such a brilliant plot element in the last book suddenly seemed tired, as if Collins was a one-trick pony. But that feeling soon disappeared. Although there is indeed a second round of the Hunger Games competition in Catching Fire, the plot both inside and outside of the arena was different enough...\n\nThis monthâ€™s Fourth Friday Film Forum: Gravity. From the very start of the film Gravity you are aware of two elements of space that we probably know but donâ€™t often think about: 1) the sheer size of outer space and, by extension, the universe, and 2) the utter silence of space. Both of these elements are brought to vivid expression by filmmaker Alfonso CuarÃ³n and serve to elicit one emotional reaction in particular: loneliness. That sense that you are so small as to be insignificant; so absolutely irrelevant in the larger scheme of things; so tiny and powerless in the face of the monumental challenges of life; so utterly...\n\nI love movies. I love the way I get swept up into their grand stories and often â€“ especially after a particularly good move â€“ think a little differently because of them. And so Iâ€™ve decided to try to write once a month about one movie and what it suggests to me about our life of faith in the world. And, if I can remember to do it, Iâ€™ll try to post these reflections on the fourth Friday of the month. Why? No particular reason except that then I can call it the Fourth Friday Film Forum. (Corny, I know, but the preacher in me loves alliterations when I can find them. ðŸ™‚ ) So the film I want to talk about is Prometheus, released in the...\n\nBest known, perhaps, as the cohost of PBSâ€™s long-running Sneak Previews (later changed to Siskel and Ebert and the Movies), Roger Ebert was many things. The first Pulitzer Prize winning film critic, he was also a profound commentator on culture and politics, an incredibly astute observer of human nature and, ultimately, a candid memoirist and cataloguer of the human spirit. His very well written autobiography, Life Itself, began with this wonderful metaphor drawn from his lifelong love affair with film: I was born inside the movie of my life. The visuals were before me, the audio surrounded me, the plot unfolded inevitably but not..."
