        "text": "As one of the longest movie franchises of all time, The Fast and Furious series has evolved from relatively modest street racing movies to the pinnacle of over-the-top Hollywood action — an evolution that's led to nearly $2 billion USD at the global box office.\n\nThroughout that time, the franchise's twelve films (nine mainline, one spinoff, and two shorts) have woven together a convoluted narrative that's proven a bit difficult to follow. With the latest Fast and Furious film: Fast X now available to stream on Amazon, we've put together this handy guide on how to watch the Fast and Furious movies in chronological order.\n\nAt the bottom of the article, you'll find a second list that orders the films by their actual release dates, if you’d prefer to watch them in that order instead. Considering its lack of importance to the film series’ ongoing narrative, we aren’t including the animated series Fast & Furious: Spy Racers.\n\nJump to:\n\nHow to watch in chronological order\n\nHow to watch by release order\n\nHow Many Fast and Furious Movies are There?\n\nThere are currently a total of 12 Fast and Furious movies, 2 short films, and an animated series. Fast and Furious 11 (also known as Fast X: Part 2) is expected to conclude the main storyline, though spinoffs and side projects may continue. See our guide on where to watch every Fast and Furious movie for streaming details for the films.\n\nHow Long to Watch All Fast and Furious Movies\n\nA Fast and Furious movie marathon will take you almost a full day to get through. If you’re looking to watch the entire franchise in a weekend, all of the films together take almost 23 and half hours.\n\nFast and Furious Movies in Chronological Order\n\n1. The Fast and the Furious (2001)\n\nThe timeline begins with the franchise's first film, 2001's The Fast and the Furious. The fairly straightforward action plot tasks Paul Walker's undercover cop Brian O'Conner with taking down a crew of carjackers led by Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto. Brian gets involved in illegal street racing, befriends Dom, starts dating his sister (Jordan Brewster's Mia Toretto), and ultimately chooses those relationships over his duty as a cop. The first film also introduces viewers to series staple Michelle Rodriguez, who plays Letty Ortiz, Dom's love interest.\n\nRead our review of The Fast and the Furious.\n\n2. The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\n\nThe Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious shows how Brian O’Conner, on the run from law enforcement, gets from LA to Miami before the events of 2 Fast 2 Furious. The six-minute short film features no dialogue and a handful of races. It’s nonessential viewing, but it’s here nonetheless.\n\n3. 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\n\nThe series’ only movie without Dom Toretto, 2 Fast 2 Furious introduces Roman Pearce (Tyrese GIbson) and Tej Parker (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges). The story follows Brian O’Connor and Pearce as they go undercover to take down a drug lord in exchange for having their criminal records expunged — a mission that's ultimately successful. It also introduces a new love interest for O’Connor in Eva Mendes’s Monica Fuentes, who only appears again briefly in Fast Five.\n\nRead our review of 2 Fast 2 Furious\n\n4. Los Bandoleros (2009)\n\nThe second of the series’ two short films, Los Bandoleros takes place between Fast 1 and Fast 4, though its exact placement on the timeline is never specified. Written and directed by Vin Diesel, Los Bandoleros is set in the Dominican Republic, where Dom is lying low after the events of Fast 1. In its 20-minute runtime, the film manages to cover an oil war, corrupt politics, and a prison break, culminating in a romantic reunion between Dom and Letty. Chronologically, it’s also the first time we see Sung Kang’s death-defying Han Lue.\n\n5. Fast & Furious (2009)\n\nNot to be confused with The Fast and the Furious, Fast & Furious is the franchise's fourth mainline film, though it precedes Tokyo Drift (film number three) in the chronology. It's a sequel to Fast 1, set five years later, with Dom and Brian teaming up once again to take down a drug lord and avenge the “death” of Letty. Dom is ultimately arrested and sentenced, though en route to the prison, Brian, Mia, and Tego Leo (Tego Calderon) are seen intercepting the prison bus. Fast & Furious also introduces Gal Gadot’s Gisele Yashar. It was the Wonder Woman actor's first major film role.\n\nRead our review of Fast & Furious.\n\n6. Fast Five (2011)\n\nFrequent series director Justin Lin’s third Fast movie raised the stakes with massive setpieces and a supersized cast featuring Dwayne Johnson’s Luke Hobbs. Picking up where Fast & Furious left off, Dom heads to Rio de Janeiro with Mia and Brian after escaping his prison transport. A familiar tale unfolds: They steal and race souped-up street cars while on the run from another government agency, this time Luke Hobbs and the DEA. Eva Mendes’s Monica Fuentes returns in a mid-credits scene to reveal Letty is still alive.\n\nRead our review of Fast Five.\n\n7. Fast & Furious 6 (2013)\n\nFast 6 begins with Dom and his crew once again on the lam. Hobbs, meanwhile, is looking to take down a mercenary group led by Luke Evans’s Owen Shaw. Hobbs recruits Dom by showing him a picture of Letty, whom Dom believes to be dead, and offering him and his crew amnesty back in the U.S. As always, there are vehicular shenanigans and casualties, though things ultimately end well for the crew, and the franchise carries on. The post-credits scene introduces Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw to the series.\n\nRead our review of Fast & Furious 6.\n\n8. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)\n\nThe wackiest of the Fast movies timeline-wise is the series’ third movie, which actually takes place between Fast 6 and 7. The first Fast movie directed by Justin Lin features a Dom cameo but largely centers around teenage street racers Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) and Twinkie (Shad \"Bow Wow\" Moss), with series staple Han Lue serving as a mentor to Sean. With a $62 million haul, it's the series’ least successful entry by box office total.\n\nRead our review of Tokyo Drift.\n\n9. Furious 7 (2015)\n\nThe series’ biggest box office success to date is Furious 7, which grossed over $350 million — no other Fast film has cleared $250 million. It’s also the most well-received critically with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 82% (five points better than runner-up Fast Five). Furious 7 picks up at the end of Tokyo Drift, with Statham’s Deckard Shaw serving as the main villain. It was directed by James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring, Aquaman).\n\nThis is the last Fast film with Paul Walker’s Brian O’Conner, as Walker died during the time of its filming. Furious 7 ends with an emotional farewell to Brian/Walker.\n\nRead our review of Furious 7.\n\n10. The Fate of the Furious (2017)\n\nOrder is restored here as Fast 8 follows Fast 7 in both the real and fictional timelines. The film’s stacked cast includes Charlize Theron, Russell Crowe, Scott Eastwood, and Helen Mirren, alongside series regulars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Dwayne Johson, and Jason Statham. In addition to the expected dose of fast cars, over-the-top action, and double-crossing, Fast 8 finds time for cyberterrorism and the threat of nuclear war.\n\nRead our review of The Fate of the Furious.\n\n11. Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw (2019)\n\nThe series’ only spinoff film to date stars Johnson’s Luke Hobbs and Statham’s Deckard Shaw. The duo, who became buddies after escaping prison together in the previous film, are tasked with saving humanity from a deadly virus. The spinoff also brings the legendary Idris Elba into the fold as villainous super soldier Brixton Lore.\n\nBack in 2020, Johnson said he was working on a Hobbs and Shaw sequel, though he vowed to never again appear in the mainline films due to a feud with Vin Diesel. So as it stands there are currently no discussions happening for a sequel.\n\nRead our review of Hobbs and Shaw.\n\n12. F9 (2021)\n\nThe series’ most recent film before Fast X, once again directed by Justin Lin, pits Dom and the crew against Jakob Toretto, Dom’s estranged brother played by John Cena. The family’s all here for this one, as nearly every major series player to date returns, in addition to new blood like Cena, Michael Rooker, and Cardi B. The plot involves another threat to humanity: Project Aries, a device capable of controlling all of the world's weapon systems. As always, that plot is foiled, in part thanks to Roman and Tej flying a Pontiac into space.\n\nRead our review of Fast and Furious 9.\n\n13. Fast X (2023)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nFast X is set to be the second to last chapter in the Fast and Furious series. Dom will have to protect his family from a new enemy named Dante (Jason Momoa) who is looking for revenge after the death of his father in Fast 5.\n\nIf you're wondering how to watch Fast X in 2024, it's currently available to rent on Amazon or you can stream it on Peacock wit a subscription.\n\nRead our review of Fast X.\n\nHow to Watch the Fast and Furious Movies By Release Date\n\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001)\n\nThe Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003 – short film)\n\n2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\n\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)\n\nFast & Furious (2009)\n\nLos Bandoleros (2009 – short film)\n\nFast Five (2011)\n\nFast & Furious 6 (2013)\n\nFurious 7 (2015)\n\nThe Fate of the Furious (2017)\n\nHobbs & Shaw (2019 – spinoff film)\n\nF9 (2021)\n\nFast X (2023)\n\nFast X: Part 2 (TBA 2026)\n\nThe Future of The Fast and Furious Movies"
