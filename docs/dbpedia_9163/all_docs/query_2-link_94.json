        "text": "And that's not all there is to look forward to, with Phase Six on the horizon and plenty of exciting titles on the way, including Agatha All Along, Thunderbolts* and the Fantastic Four reboot.\n\nThere's also plenty of hype around the upcoming Avengers 5, which is now named Doomsday – the first of two Avengers films releasing in the MCU's Phase 6 – especially following the announcement that Robert Downey Jr is returning to the MCU as Doctor Doom.\n\nYep, the actor, whose career has been defined by his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man in the MCU, will make his return as Victor Von Doom in The Fantastic Four, and then in Avengers 5, which is now named Doomsday. He'll return alongside Avengers: Endgame directors, the Russo brothers, who will be helming the new Avengers movies.\n\nMore like this\n\nMaking his grand appearance at the Marvel Studios panel at SDCC, RDJ dramatically removed his mask, declaring: \"New mask, same task.\" So, if you're as confused as Gwyneth Paltrow appears to be, it's high time to catch up on anything you missed in the MCU.\n\nNo Marvel fan wants to miss out on any in-jokes, references, Easter eggs or post-credits scenes – so where exactly do you need to start in the monumental MCU?\n\nHave no fear, RadioTimes.com has you covered in how to watch Marvel movies and TV shows in order – including both chronological and release date order. Sit back, relax and get ready for your Marvel marathon - because we could do this all day.\n\nHow to watch Marvel movies in order of release\n\nThe easiest way to catch up on the MCU is to watch the Marvel movies in release date order, which also neatly categorises the MCU story into its distinct \"phases\".\n\nThe first three phases make up what is now referred to as the Infinity Saga, beginning with the introduction of the Avengers characters and ending with the time-hopping mega-event that was Avengers: Endgame.\n\nWatching this method will send you on the same journey that millions of Marvel fans all over the world have enjoyed, allowing you to watch first-hand how the MCU grew from a fairly grounded superhero flick to an all-out space opera.\n\nIt's true that watching this way will mean you see some events outside of their in-universe order, i.e. the origin of Captain America or the first meeting between Nick Fury and Captain Marvel, but this doesn't cause any serious storytelling problems.\n\nIn release date order, the MCU begins with 2008's Iron Man. It continues up to the present, with the most recent release being Deadpool & Wolverine, and then delves into future releases which have been announced, including the recently re-named Avengers: Doomsday.\n\nThe Infinity Saga\n\nPhase One\n\nIron Man (May, 2008)\n\nThe Incredible Hulk (June, 2008)\n\nIron Man 2 (May, 2010)\n\nThor (May, 2011)\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger (July 22, 2011)\n\nAvengers Assemble (May 4, 2012)\n\nPhase Two\n\nIron Man 3 (May, 2013)\n\nThor: The Dark World (November, 2013)\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (April, 2014)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (August, 2014)\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (May, 2015)\n\nAnt-Man (July, 2015)\n\nPhase Three\n\nCaptain America: Civil War (May, 2016)\n\nDoctor Strange (November, 2016)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (May, 2017)\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (July, 2017)\n\nThor: Ragnarok (November, 2017)\n\nBlack Panther (February, 2018)\n\nAvengers: Infinity War (April, 2018)\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp (July, 2018)\n\nCaptain Marvel (March, 2019)\n\nAvengers: Endgame (April, 2019)\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home (July, 2019)\n\nThe Multiverse Saga\n\nPhase Four\n\nWandaVision (TV series) (January, 2021)\n\nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier (TV series) (March, 2021)\n\nLoki season 1 (TV series) (June, 2021)\n\nBlack Widow (9th July 2021)\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (3rd September 2021)\n\nEternals (5th November 2021)\n\nHawkeye (24th November 2021)\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (17th December 2021)\n\nMoon Knight (TV show -30th March 2022)\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (5th May 2022)\n\nMs Marvel (TV show -

While the method sounds appealing in theory, there are several reasons why it could actually hamper your overall experience of the MCU.\n\nFirst off: you may struggle to remember the background of certain characters. Captain Marvel, for instance, will be introduced in the second film in the list, but won't be mentioned again until more than 40 screen hours later.\n\nAlso, making Captain Marvel your second MCU movie means you miss out on the in-jokes and references established over 17 preceding entries.\n\nHowever, there is something to be said for ardent Marvel fans revisiting the saga chronologically, as this will give more depth to the backstory of some key characters and brings a new understanding of the MCU timeline (e.g. many don't realise that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 and 2 are set mere months apart).\n\nRead More: How to watch all the DC Extended Universe movies in order\n\nRead More: How to watch all of the Star Wars movies in order\n\nCheck out more of our Movies coverage or visit our TV guide and Streaming Guide to see what's on tonight.
