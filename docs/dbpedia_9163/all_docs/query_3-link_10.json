        "text": "What is mean time between failures?\n\nMean time between failures (MTBF) is the average time between system breakdowns. Mean time between failures is a crucial maintenance metric to measure performance, safety, and equipment design, especially for critical or complex assets like generators or airplanes. It’s also used to determine the reliability of an asset.\n\nMTBF is also one-half of the formula used to calculate availability, together with mean time to repair (MTTR). The MTBF formula uses only unplanned maintenance and doesn’t account for scheduled maintenance, like inspections, recalibrations, or preventive parts replacements.\n\nHow do you calculate mean time between failures?\n\nCalculating MTBF is pretty straightforward. You divide the total number of operational hours by the number of failures in that period. MTBF is usually measured in hours.\n\nMTBF calculation\n\nMTBF = # of operational hours ÷ # of failures\n\nFor example, an asset may have been operational for 1,000 hours in a year. For that year, that asset broke down eight times. Therefore, the MTBF for that piece of equipment is 125 hours.\n\nTo get an accurate measure of MTBF, you must collect data from the actual performance of the equipment. Each asset operates under different circumstances and is influenced by human factors, such as design, assembly, maintenance, and more. That’s why you should avoid basing your maintenance around an MTBF estimate from a manual.\n\nMean Time Between Failure Calculator\n\n= (# of operational hours / # of failures)\n\nWhat does MTBF mean for maintenance?\n\nFailure is a problem, and knowing everything about it is often the best way to solve it. Measuring and calculating MTBF is one way to get more information about a failure and mitigate its impact. Conducting an MTBF analysis helps your maintenance team reduce downtime while saving money and working faster.\n\nCalculating an asset’s MTBF provides a baseline for maximizing your preventive maintenance schedule. Knowing approximately how often an asset fails allows you to schedule preventive maintenance before that point. This gives you a better chance to prevent failure while doing as little maintenance as possible and maximizing your resources. This method is a good step towards condition-based maintenance.\n\nYou can also go a step further and measure MTBF for a specific failure. Not only can you target that failure with preventive maintenance schedules, but you can also investigate why a specific issue results in a lower MTBF. The culprit can be anything from vague task lists to defective parts or inadequate training. With this knowledge, you can pinpoint and eliminate the root cause of a particularly consistent failure.\n\nPMs aren’t the only task that can be optimized using MTBF. Inventory management can also be improved by tracking this maintenance metric. Knowing approximately how long you have before a piece of equipment goes down can fine-tune your approach to MRO inventory purchasing. For example, you can get a better sense of minimum quantities and lead times to achieve just-in-time delivery, resulting in lower costs and quicker repair times.\n\nLastly, MTBF can help make tough decisions a little easier. It’s never easy to give up on a piece of equipment and buy an expensive new machine. However, if all attempts to combat low MTBF are unsuccessful, it might be in your best interest to replace the asset instead of spending time and money repairing it all the time. MTBF can be used to calculate the cost of repair vs. replacement and make a business case for new equipment."
