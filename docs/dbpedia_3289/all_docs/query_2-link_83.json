        "text": "OTHER FOUNTAINS EAST OF THE TIBER\n\nThe districts lying by the east bank of the Tiber, namely Ponte and Regola, were the next to benefit from the making of the Acqua Paola. Here some rich mansions still suffered a lack of running water, which was already available in the adjacent districts, thanks to the Salone Water (formerly Aqua Virgo) and the Acqua Felice, but reached this part of Rome with a very low pressure, insufficient for the making of further fountains. Thanks to a branch of the Acqua Paola that ran parallel to the river's eastern bank, the needs of both districts could be finally satisfied.\n\nthe Acqua Paola and its branch (blue)\n\ncrossing Ponte and Regola districts (red)\n\nTHE FOUNTAIN OF MONTE GIORDANO\n\nIn the heart of Ponte is a hillock named Monte Giordano. During the Middle Ages it was the site of a fortress that belonged to the powerful Orsini family.\n\nFollowing its demolition, in the 15th century the previous building was replaced by a mansion, initially called Palazzo Orsini. During the 1700s the Orsini sold this property to the Gabrielli, and one century later it was bought by the Taverna, whence the name of the mansion was changed into the present denomination, Palazzo Taverna.\n\nWhen the first fountains were built in Rome (see page 2), this spot had already been included in the first project, agreed under pope Gregory XIII, provided that the running water could reach the spot; but since this condition had not been met, Monte Giordano had been cancelled.\n\nAs soon as the Acqua Paola's water became available, Antonio Casoni was given commission for the making of a decorative fountain for the mansion's central court.\n\nThe architect drew a magnificent composition, finished in 1618, consisting of four basins of different sizes. The two upper (smaller) ones are supported by a central baluster and have a flourish on two sides; the water gushes from the top basin, and trickles down into the remaining three, filling them in turn.\n\nOnce the structure also included two standing bears - the name Orsini actually means \"small bears\" - resting on a wall on both sides of the fountain; they held the family's coat of arms, while spouting a jet of water into the second basin.\n\nBut when in the 18th century Palazzo Orsini changed owners the courtyard was altered, a tall hedge was built around the fountain, and the bears, slightly moved from their original position, stopped working and were left merely as decorations above the wall.\n\nthe fountain of palazzo Orsini (etching by G.B.Falda)\n\nthe fountain, in its present condition Today the amount of water that the fountain of Monte Giordano receives has been considerably reduced, and signs of ageing are quite evident.\n\nSince it is still now a private property of the Taverna, the mansion's court is not accessible to the public. Although this section disregards fountains located in buildings and villas (as disclaimed in the foreword), this one has been included as an exception, as it is clearly visible, at any time, through the gate of the mansion's main entrance.\n\none of the bears that once spouted water\n\none of the two fountains, in the southern half of piazza Farnese\n\nTHE FOUNTAINS IN PIAZZA FARNESE\n\nPiazza Farnese is the main square of Regola district; its western side is entirely occupied by the façade of Palazzo Farnese, one of the largest and most beautiful Renaissance mansions in Rome, created by talented architects such as Antonio Sangallo the Younger, Michelangelo, and the same prolific fountain-maker Giacomo della Porta. The artistic importance of Palazzo Farnese once matched the political power of the family who dwelt in it. But despite the Farnese counted among their members a pope (Paul III), a cardinal, and several important officers, the mansion could be supplied by running water only after the making of the aforesaid branch of the Acqua Paola.\n\nUp to the 1500s, in the middle of piazza Farnese (once called piazza del Duca) stood an ancient tub made of granite, of Roman age; commonly used in public baths of ancient Rome, most of these tubs, including this one, had a very traditional shape, with two handles and a lion head carved on each side.\n\na bullfight below Palazzo Farnese (c.1535); →\n\n← the detail shows people enjoying the show from\n\ninside the only tub in the centre of the square\n\nIt had been found in the Baths of Carcalla and had been set in the square merely as a decoration, but since bullfights were sometimes held in front of Palazzo Farnese, the people used it also as a comfortable and safe standpoint from where the dangerous show could be followed, as seen in the etching on the right.\n\nearly 1600s: piazza del Duca (piazza Farnese)\n\nnow had two tubs; nearby, in Campo de' Fiori,\n\na fountain had already been built, see page 5 Another ancient tub stood in piazza San Marco, presently piazza Venezia; one century earlier (mid 1400s) pope Paul II had moved it from the Colosseum's surroundings to the square where his own mansion stood, see page 4. Being very similar to the one in front of Palazzo Farnese, sometime during the second half of the 16th century cardinal Alessandro Farnese, wishing to form a pair, asked the papal authorities for the other tub, and gave in exchange for it a slightly smaller one, that had been unearthed in one of the family's several estates.\n\nThe two tubs were arranged in their present position (picture on the left). Since in those days the ducts of the Salone Water were reaching many districts, it is likely that the Farnese had already thought of having fountains made from them. But due to the long distance from the aqueduct's main outlet this was impossible, until the Acqua Paola was built.\n\nIn 1626 the distinguished architect Girolamo Rainaldi, influenced by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana, turned the two tubs into elegant twin fountains."
