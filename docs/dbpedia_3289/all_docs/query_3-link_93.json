        "text": "SURROUNDINGS\n\nDiscover the city\n\nIn the heart of the historic centre, in the Regola district, between Trastevere, Campo di Fiori, Piazza Navona and just a few steps and you will immediately have something remarkable to admire. Leaving home, you can choose to go in any direction, no matter which one. Whichever way you go, you will be on a journey full of wonders and exciting things to see and discover.\n\nThe area around the flat is rich in testimonies and monuments, both civil and religious. You can start with a visit to Palazzo Spada, a walk along Via Giulia, the fascinating Piazza Navona, Campo di Fiori, the Pantheon, Palazzo Farnese, the Spada Chapel in the Church of San Girolamo alla Carità one of the most sensational marble chapels in Rome. And then to discover all the treasures of Rome, all within easy reach with a short walk.\n\n.\n\nPALAZZO SPADA\n\nBORROMINI’S PERSPECTIVE\n\nAlready from the flat’s windows, it is possible to admire the splendid façade of Palazzo Spada. The magnificent building, which takes its name from the Spada family, was built during the 16th century by Cardinal Girolamo Capodiferro, who had entrusted the project to the architect Bartolomeo Baronino.\n\nThe rich façade has a series of niches with statues representing the illustrious men of ancient Rome, including Trajan, Pompey, Fabius Maximus, Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, Julius Caesar and Augustus, with the Spada coat of arms in the centre. At the same time, at the top level, tables depict Roman heroes’ deeds in Latin. The rich stucco decorations of the Palazzo Spada make it one of Rome’s most significant symbols of Renaissance architecture. Don’t miss the Secret Garden, with Borromini’s Prospective, created by the artist in 1653. A sequence of columns of decreasing height and a rising floor create the optical illusion of a 37-metre-long gallery (when it is 8 metres long) with a sculpture at the end that looks life-size when in fact it is only 60 centimetres high.\n\ncontinua\n\nIn the courtyard are Hercules, Mars, Venus, Juno, Jupiter, Proserpine, Minerva, Mercury, Amphitrite, Neptune and Pluto. The palace also houses a colossal sculpture of Pompey the Great, believed to be the one at whose feet Julius Caesar fell. Inside, the 16th-century Palazzo Capodiferro the Spada Gallery with works by Guercino, Baciccia, Orazio Gentileschi, Artemisia Gentileschi, Guido Reni, Tiziano and Brueghel, the Elder, and has a significant collection of Baroque paintings, antique sculptures, furnishings and period furniture, which give this place a unique charm.\n\nSpada Gallery\n\nPiazza Capodiferro 13 00186 Rome\n\nOpening hours Monday/Sunday 8.30 a.m. – 7.30 p.m.\n\nClosed on Tuesdays.\n\nThe ticket office always closes at 7 p.m.\n\nFor groups of less than 10 Reservation is not required\n\nIncluded in Romepass circuit\n\nDistance 2 minutes\n\nFARNESE PALACE\n\nTHE NUT\n\nPalazzo Farnese dominates the famous Piazza Farnese, embellished with twin fountains by Girolamo Rainaldi. (Piazza Farnese should be an oasis of peace, as it is a pedestrian zone, but unfortunately, the rules are not respected and every day it is invaded by all kinds of vehicles).\n\nWork on Palazzo Farnese’s construction began in 1517 with Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (later to become Paul III in 1534). Antonio da Sangallo, the Younger carried out by followed by Michelangelo and Vignola and completed by Giacomo Della Porta.\n\nmore\n\nThe rear elevation is Della Porta and Vignola’s work, while the facades on the side streets and the square are Sangallo the Younger’s work. On the other hand, Michelangelo completed the cornice. Palazzo Farnese has been renamed ‘The Nut’ because of its shape.\n\nThe Atrium\n\nConsists of a wide central nave and two narrower side aisles divided by ancient granite columns from the Baths of Caracalla’s excavations.\n\nThe Staircase.\n\nThis Staircase leads to the upper floor, the noble one. It is a grand staircase formed by majestic ramps that allow a magnificent ascent.\n\nThe Red Salon.\n\nAt the time called the “philosophers’ salon”, this room housed until 1787 the ancient busts of Greek philosophers and poets. This collection is now in the Archaeological Museum of Naples.\n\nThe Salone Bianco is known as the ‘Chamber of Queen Christina’ who stayed here between 1655 and 1656. The coffered ceiling bears the arms of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese. The Yellow Salon and the Signature Salon.\n\nThe coat of arms of Cardinal Alessandro’s and four symbols referring to the Farnese family: Pegasus, a ship, Farnese lilies and a shield are depicted on the coffered ceiling. In the Hall of Signatures, there are frescoes that Domenichino painted in 1603 depicting Apollo and Hyacinth’s myths and Adonis and Narcissus’s death, which were later transformed into flowers: the hyacinth, narcissus and anemone. This motif represents the Farnese family.\n\nThe Camerino Farnese.\n\nCarracci’s first work in Rome, commissioned by Odoardo Farnese, was the Cardinal’s Cabinet, also known as the Camerino Farnese. The vaulted ceiling decorated with frescoes between 1595 and 1597 depicts the cardinal virtues shown as a philosopher prince. This work is now in the Gallery of the Capodimonte Museum in Naples.\n\nThe Farnese Gallery.\n\nThe Gallery is the most famous room in Palazzo Farnese. Annibale Carracci, Agostino Carracci and Domenichino frescoed it between 1597 and 1604. The Gallery is narrow (about six metres) and just over twenty metres long. The vault’s decorations have their theme the gods’ loves and are taken almost exclusively from Ovid’s Metamorphoses. The central part depicts the wedding procession with the Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne on two chariots pulled by tigers and accompanied by dancing figures.\n\nThe Hall of Hercules. This room takes its name from Hercules’ statue that was present here for centuries before being brought to the Archeological Museum of Naples and the entire Farnese collection.\n\nPalazzo Farnese has been the headquarters of the French Embassy since 1871.\n\nOpening Hours\n\nIt is possible to visit Palazzo Farnese by booking on the website: www.inventerrome.com/index.php/it/visitare-palazzo-farnese.\n\nVisits are offered in French, Italian or English.\n\nReservation is compulsory\n\nAddress: Piazza Farnese 00186 Rome\n\nOpening hours:\n\nWednesday and Friday afternoon. A professional guide conducts visits.\n\nYou can visit the Sangallo atrium, the courtyard, the garden, the Salone d’Ercole and the Carracci gallery.\n\nThe cost of the visit is €11 per person.\n\nDistance 2 minutes\n\nCAMPO di FIORI\n\nCampo de’ Fiori is one of Rome’s most famous squares\n\nThe current market of Campo de’ Fiori already existed in the 15th century and was the site of inns for pilgrims and merchants and the home of courtesans.\n\nCampo de’ Fiori has a double life, depending on the moment.\n\nFrom the first hours of the day until 2 p.m. it is a popular market, where Romans’ voices selling fruit and vegetables resound.\n\nIn the evening it is a lively square, especially for young people, attracted by the many bars and restaurants surrounding the square.\n\nmore\n\nA bit of history\n\nPopular tradition has it that this square’s name refers to Flora, a woman much loved by Pompey, the great Roman general. In reality, after being abandoned towards the end of the 14th century, it became a meadow full of flowers.\n\nThe construction took place around 1456 after Pope Callistus III had the whole area paved. Thus, Campo dè Fiori became the site of a flourishing horse market and the centre of numerous commercial activities. After the redevelopment of the 16th century, the Piazza, almost as it is today, was a place of taverns, every building in the Piazza and the adjacent streets included one, together with trade and craft activities. The roads that converged on the square became symbols of commercial activities that still today bear the toponymy of the court: Via dei Baullari, which grouped with the shops of trunk and suitcase manufacturers, Via dei Giubbonari, jacket manufacturers, and so for all the other streets Via degli Straderari, dei Cappellari, dei Giubbonari, dei Chiodaroli, dei Cartari, Dei Pettinari, dei Chiavari etc.\n\nThe square was also the site of executions, Giordano Bruno was burned here in 1600 on heresy charges. The statue the centre of the square reminds us of his story.\n\nCampo di Fiori at Sunset As the sun goes down, Campo de’ Fiori turns into a favourite spot for dinner or simply an aperitif. (A suggestion: choose your restaurant carefully, there are many good ones but many to avoid).\n\nCuriosity: One of the personalities linked to the history of Campo de’ Fiori was Giovanna de Candia dei Cattanei, nicknamed Vannozza, the famous lover of Alexander VI Borgia. Vannozza gave the Pontiff three children, all of them sadly famous: Cesare Borgia, who inspired Macchiavelli’s “Prince”, Lucrezia, accused of bloody intrigues, and the third Giovanni, who died in mysterious circumstances, including the probable fact that it was her brother who killed him. Vannozza was the owner of one of the most famous inns in Campo de’ Fiori, the “Taverna della Vacca”. Famous also because it is said to have been frequented by prostitutes. The tavern no longer exists, but at the end of Vicolo del Gallo, you can see Vannozza’s coat of arms on the wall in a building from the Middle Ages.\n\nDistance 2 minutes\n\nNAVONA SQUARE\n\nROMAN BAROQUE MASTERPIECE\n\nPiazza Navona is one of Rome’s most beautiful squares, and I confess my favourite, especially at night.\n\nPiazza Navona is a busy square. And at any time of day, there are people there. That is why I recommend you come here at night or early in the morning if you want to enjoy its beauty to the full. But even at sunset, Piazza Navona is one of the most beautiful places to be.\n\nmore\n\nThe square is bordered by the buildings that stood on the remains of the ancient Stadium of Domitian, whose shape and size the square retains. This ancient structure’s remains are located 5-6 metres below today’s street level and can still be seen and visited. In the Stadium that Domitian had built in 86 A.D., were held athletic competitions and horse races. And over the centuries Piazza Navona has been the scene of popular festivals, races and jousts. The modern name of the square derives from the word Agones, which means ‘games’ in Latin.\n\nThe current appearance of Piazza Navona was established in the 17th century when the noble Pamphili family, who lived in the area, commissioned the most influential architects of the time to monumentalise the site to make it a unique spaces in the city.\n\nDominating the square is the Church of Sant’Agnese in Agone, begun by Carlo and Girolamo Rainaldi and completed by Borromini, who made it one of the most magnificent Baroque architectures in Rome. Next to the Church is Palazzo Pamphilj. Opposite the palace stands the Church of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, formerly known as San Giacomo degli Spagnoli, built for the Jubilee of 1450.\n\nThree fountains enrich the square: the Fountain of the Moor, so-called because of the statue of the Ethiopian wrestling with a dolphin, the Fountain of the Calderari, also known as the Fountain of Neptune, both works by Giacomo della Porta and, in the centre, the imposing Fountain of the Four Rivers, by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The Fountain represents as a large travertine cliff, on the corners of the ridge are placed the monumental marble statues of the four rivers representing the then known continents: the Danube for Europe, the Ganges for Asia; the Nile for Africa, with its veiled head (an allusion to the unknown sources); the Rio de la Plata for America.\n\nThe Domitian Stadium Archaeological Area is open to the public\n\nFriday to Monday 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.Saturday until 20:\n\nPurchasing the ticket directly from the site\n\nwww.stadiodomiziano.com\n\nTICKETS : Full price € 8,50: 18 – 64 years old (audio guide included)*.Reduced € 6,50: 12 – 17 years old / over 65 years old (audio guide included)*.\n\nJunior € 4,50: 8 – 11 years old (audio guide included)*.\n\nDuration of the visit with audio guide 40 minutes.\n\nDistance 4 minutes\n\nPANTHEON\n\nONE OF THE BEST -PRESERVED HISTORICAL MONUMENTS\n\nThe name comes from the Greek words pan (all) and theon (divine), and initially, the Pantheon was a small temple dedicated to all the Roman Gods. Emperor Hadrian built it between 118 and 125 AD to replace an earlier temple built between 27 and 25 B.C. by Marcus Agrippa and consecrated to Mars and Venus. The facade still bears the inscription, ‘M. Agrippa L. F. Cos. Tertium fecit” or “Marcus Agrippa Luci Filius consul tertium fecit” “Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, consul for the third time, built it”.\n\nIn 609, the Roman temple became a Christian basilica with the name Santa Maria ad Martyres\n\nmore\n\nInside are the tombs of Vittorio Emanuele II, Umberto I, Margherita di Savoia, and those of Raffaello Sanzio and Annibale Caracci.\n\nThe temple consists of a circular hall surmounted by a hemispherical dome, preceded by 16 Corinthian columns supporting the tympanum. The ceiling of the pronaos was of bronze, but Pope Urban VIII had it removed in 1632 to make another great work inside St Peter’s Basilica, namely the altar canopy by Bernini. Hence the saying: “What the Barbarians did not do, the Barberini did”.\n\nDiscovering the Pantheon\n\nOn passing the huge columns and the gigantic bronze doorway, you will find yourself inside an enormous space that will leave you breathless, characterised by the impressive hemispherical dome with a diameter of 43.3m. An architectural miracle that makes the Pantheon a perfect sphere since its height is equal to its diameter: 43m and 44cm by 43m and 44cm. Balance and stability are the principles that the ancient architects adhered to an entirely synthesised in the Pantheon.\n\nThe Oculus at the top of the dome is the large and unique 9-metre opening called the Oculus, from which light and heat arrive. From the Oculus, a sunbeam penetrates inside and rotates according to the time of day. On the summer solstice, the sunbeam projects a luminous disc, 9 metres in diameter, onto the floor, just like the Oculus. If you have the opportunity, enter the temple at noon, when the sun’s rays from the Oculus become extraordinarily intense and create a unique effect.\n\nThe Oculus and Rain\n\nLight comes from this hole, but water also falls when it rains, but this drains away quickly trough to the central and lateral holes in the floor, which prevent puddles from forming.\n\nThe Pantheon Building technique is a mixing concrete with lighter and lighter materials, ranging from travertine to pumice stone, as one approached the top. All this has allowed the Pantheon’s dome to endure almost two thousand years and remain perfectly intact to this day.\n\nOPENING HOURS\n\nMonday to Saturday: 9:00 – 19:30 Sunday : 9:00 – 18:00;\n\nHolidays: 9:00 – 13:00 Closed: 25 December, 1 January and 1 May\n\nThe Pantheon is freely accessible, and for the moment, there is no entrance fee.\n\nKeep in mind that the Pantheon is a Basilica and that religious services take place inside.\n\nAddress: Piazza Della Rotonda\n\nDistance: 400 m, 5 minutes.\n\nwww.pantheonroma.com\n\nDistance 5 minutes\n\nVIA GIULIA\n\nONE KILOMETRE OF HISTORY AND ART\n\nThe most beautiful street in Rome is in Rione Regola, our neighbourhood. It is about 1 km long and runs parallel to the Tiber from Ponte Sisto to the Church of San Giovanni Dei Fiorentini. Thanks to the elegance of its façades, fountains and characteristic views, the street is considered the most beautiful in Rome and has an incredible heritage of art and culture housed in the buildings that line it.\n\nEach palace or Church is a fine example of architecture along its route, and each one contains numerous and immeasurable works of art.\n\nmore\n\nThe History\n\nCommissioned by Pope Julius II, from whom it takes its name and built by Bramante in the early 16th century, Via Giulia is the first and longest straight road, born to connect all papal institutions government. The Sacchetti, the Ricci and the Chigi, ant all the most important families of the time, built their houses along Via Giulia. The area became populated with gardens and palaces. Via Giulia also became the residence of many artists who set up their workshops in the street; Raphael, Cellini and Borromini lived there. In contrast to the rich palaces in the area near Ponte Sisto, there were also prostitutes’ houses, hospices for pilgrims or the poor, charitable institutions for orphans and single mothers. Via Delle Zoccolette is famous because it owes its name to the young girls who found shelter in one of the street’s institutions.\n\nOver the centuries, new palaces, churches and fountains will continually enrich the exclusive street. Until the second half of the nineteenth century, with the construction of the Tiber walls, the houses along the river disappeared. Many palaces were downsized or even eliminated, and the gardens surrounding them.\n\nDespite these upheavals, Via Giulia still retains all its aristocratic charm.\n\nAlong Via Giulia\n\nJust before reaching Ponte Sisto, on our right, the sumptuous Via Giulia begins and immediately introduces us to its wonders, introducing us to the Fontana del Mascherone, built at the behest of the Farnese family around 1626. The Fountain consists of a rectangular basin and a Mascherone of Roman age. A few metres further on, behind the gate at number 186, we can see Palazzo Farnese’s rear facade, built in the second half of the 16th century by Vignola.\n\nThe Arch of the Farnese Palace above Via Giulia According to Michelangelo’s project was supposed to connect Palazzo Farnese and its gardens to Villa Farnesina, the other side of the Tiber.\n\nAfter the arch is the Church of S. Maria dell’Orazione e Morte, built around 1538 to bury the “poor dead”, without identity found in the countryside or drowned in the Tiber\n\nThe façade is full of columns and pillars; the doors and windows are decorated with winged skulls, and a plaque recalls “Hodie mihi, cras tibi”, that is “Today to me, tomorrow to you”. The interior decorations show continuous “macabre” references that always refer to life after death.\n\nCHURCHES and NOBLE PALACES\n\nAdjacent to the Church of S. Maria dell’Orazione e Morte is Palazzo Falconieri, which first belonged to the Ceci family and then, through various passages, to the Falconieri who entrusted its restoration to Francesco Borromini. The Church of Santa Maria Degli Orefici, designed by Raphael and built by Baldassarre Peruzzi. Next are a series of small palaces, including Palazzo Baldoca-Muccioli at number 167 and Palazzo Cisterna at number 163. Immediately after, there is the Church of St Catherine of Siena, built-in 1526 to a design by Baldassarre Peruzzi. On the opposite side, at number 4, palazzo Lecca de Guevara. At n°16 is palazzo Varese, designed by Carlo Maderno. At number 38, we find the portal of palazzo Ghisleri. At number 65 there is the Church of Spirito Santo dei Napoletani, by Domenico Fontana.\n\nAt Vicolo Della Moretta, there is the Church dedicated to S. Filippo Neri, also called S. Filippino, because of its small size.\n\nThe next part of Via Giulia, after Vicolo delle Prigioni, is dominated by the massive building of the Carceri Nuove. Furthermore, immediately after the Juvenile Prison wanted by Pope Leo XII, designed by Valadier, immediately after the Criminal Museum, a curious and exciting museum dedicated to the most heinous crimes and criminals. At number 59 is the Church of S. Maria del Suffragio, designed by Rainaldi. At the corner of Via dei Bresciani and Vicolo del Cefalo is an extravagant building, with large stones and seats facing the street and known in Rome as “I sofà di via Giulia”: these are the remains of the unfinished Palazzo dei Tribunali della Curia, designed by Bramante.\n\nDo not miss a visit to the Confalone auditorium in the street of the same name and the Spada Chapel in Via di Monserrato, 54-58.\n\nReturning to Via Giulia, at number 64 is the Church of S. Biagio degli Armeni. At No. 66 is Palazzo Sacchetti, perhaps the most valuable palace on Via Giulia, built by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, who lived there until the year of his death in 1546. On the opposite side, the seventeenth-century palazzo Ricci Donarelli, and at number 85 is what tradition considers Raphael’s house, “but this is only a legend”. At number 79, the 16th-century Palazzo Medici Clarelli, also designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger.\n\nAt the confluence of Via Giulia and Piazza dell’ Oro stands the Church of S. Giovanni dei Fiorentini. Jacopo Sansovino designed the Church, which began construction in the early 1500s. The Church took a century to complete and was continued, in fact, by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, Giacomo Della Porta and Carlo Maderno, to whom we owe the characteristic elongated dome (1614), for which the Romans christened it ‘the sucked confetto’.\n\nThere are no pavements on Via Giulia, but the street is paved with cobblestones, which adds to its charm and period character. The only drawback is that when it rains, the street becomes a puddle.\n\nContinuing along Via Giulia, you can reach St Peter’s Basilica, which was the project’s initial purpose, and Castel Sant’Angelo.\n\nDistance 1′\n\nCASTEL SANT’ANGELO\n\nTHE MAUSOLEUM OF ADRIAN\n\nCastel Sant’Angelo is another symbol of Rome. Built by Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century A.D. as a mausoleum for himself and his family, the Castle retained this original role until 403 AD. Caracalla, in 217 AD, was the last emperor to be buried there. Over the centuries, the Castle has undergone an endless series of transformations that have taken it from being a tomb to being a fortress, a place of imprisonment, a court, a Renaissance residence and, today, a museum. Transformations that have allowed it to arrive intact until today. Around 1300, Papa Niccolò III (an Orsini) had the Passetto di Borgo built, a secret elevated passageway linking the Castle with the Vatican, through the Borgo. This 800 metres long fortified corridor allowed the Church’s head to take refuge inside the Castle when and if necessary.\n\nStarting in 1400, Castel Sant’Angelo began to be embellished.\n\nmore\n\nWe found a succession of courtyards, bastions, terraces, inner rooms, loggias, and prisons on seven different levels. These include the Saviour’s courtyard, the courtyard of the firing squad, the courtyard of the Angel, the Halls of Clement VIII, the courtyard of Alexander VI, the small courtyard of Leo X, and the private flats of Clement VII. The Sala Paolina with frescoes by Perin del Vaga and other rooms such as the Sala di Amore e Psiche, del Perseo, dei Festoni, del Tesoro, delle Colonne and della Rotonda. Hadrian’s mausoleum is located 3 metres below ground level, with the Urn Room at its centre. Inside the “dungeons of the Castle” are the parlour and the narrow cells where prisoners were held.\n\nOne of these has been that one of Benvenuto Cellini.\n\nThe Sala della Giustizia (Hall of Justice), where death sentences were passed, is fascinating. Here, Clement VIII decided on the death penalty for Beatrice Cenci and the torture of Giordano Bruno.\n\nVisiting the Castle, you can walk along the mighty ramparts overlooking the river and admire the beautiful view.\n\nThe Angel terrace is so-called because a colossal statue of the Archangel Michael is there: ” The deck, on which stands the figure of the Angel with the bell next to it, whose funereal chimes announced the death sentences, is the place where the suicide of Tosca, a character in Puccini’s opera of the same name, is set, who threw herself from here after killing Cavaradossi.\n\nThe National Museum of Castel Sant’Angelo is open.\n\nMonday to Sunday from 9.00 a.m. to 7.30 p.m.\n\nTickets: € 15.00 full price; € 2.00 concessionary\n\nReservations: We recommend booking and purchasing tickets online\n\nwww.gebart.it/musei/museo-nazionale-di-castel-santangelo\n\nRomepass circuit\n\nDistance 14′\n\nBASILICA OF SAINT PETER\n\nTHE LARGEST CHURCH IN THE WORLD, HEART OF CHRISTIANITY\n\nAccording to tradition, St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican stands on the site buried the Apostle Peter.\n\nEmperor Constantine had the primitive St. Peter’s Basilica built here around 320.\n\nIn 1505 Julius II decided to rebuild the temple completely, entrusting the work to Bramante, who was succeeded by Raphael, Baldassarre Peruzzi, Antonio da San Gallo, Michelangelo, Giacomo della Porta and Carlo Maderno. In 1629 Gian Lorenzo Bernini took over the building site’s management and carried out most of the decorations. Between 1656 and 1665, he finally arranged the square in front of the Basilica, erecting the famous colonnade.\n\nmore\n\nTHE DOME\n\nThe dome was designed by Michelangelo, who had been working on the construction of the Basilica since 1547. At the end of his long life (he died at the age of 89 in 1564), the building’s direction passed to his pupil Giacomo Della Porta, who raised the vault of the dome by about 7 metres and completed the work. The dome has an internal diameter of 42.56 metres and a height at the top of the cross of 136.57 metres; the lantern is 17 metres high.\n\nReaching the top of St. Peter’s Dome offers incomparable emotions and suggestions impossible to describe. There is no more exciting place than this. From the dome, you have a unique view of the city. But be careful, the climb is not only imposing and allows you to admire the dome, Michelangelo’s drawings and some beautiful mosaics, but it is also quite difficult.\n\nThe first part steps are quite comfortable, towards the end with the shrinking of the environment become increasingly narrow and a bit’ high and need breath, but above all, you should not have claustrophobia.\n\nTHE SQUARE\n\nGian Lorenzo Bernini completed the square in 1667.\n\nThe colonnade of St. Peter’s Square has an elliptical shape to signify as\n\nBernini himself said: “since St. Peter’s Church is almost the matrix of all the others, it had to have a portico that would show that it was receiving Catholics with open arms to confirm them in their belief, Heretics to unite them in the Church and Infidels to enlighten them in the true faith”.\n\nThe colonnade is composed of 284 columns of Doric order and surmounted by 140 statues of saints over three metres high and six large coats of Alexander VII Chigi’s arms. Standing on the porphyry disks in the square, you can see all the columns lined up entirely one behind the other as if by magic they had moved.\n\nWith the opening of Via Della Conciliazione, a new, wide access road to the Vatican Basilica was built, enhancing the majestic view of St. Peter’s dome, but profoundly altering Bernini’s original and evocative design.\n\nThe square dimensions are extraordinary: it is 320 metres deep with a central diameter of 240 metres. On either side of the Obelisk, placed in the centre of the square by Domenico Fontana, are two large fountains by Bernini and Maderno.\n\nThe Obelisk that stands in the centre was brought to Rome from Alexandria by Caligula. The Vatican obelisk is the only Obelisk in Rome that has never fallen. Pope Sixtus V wanted it in the centre of the square to give it greater visibility. On the base of the Obelisk can be read: Christus vincit, Christus regnat, Christus imperat, Christus ab omni malo plebem suam defendant (Christ victorious, Christ King, Christ Emperor, may Christ defend his people from all evil). It is an exorcistic and propitiatory formula used in the Middle Ages to ward off illness.\n\nThe Obelisk is 25 metres high. At the top of the Obelisk, Julius Caesar‘s ashes in a bronze globe rolled in gold. The large sphere was removed in 1585 and is now on display in the Capitoline Museums. Of the 13 ancient obelisks in Rome, it is the second largest after the Lateran, and the only one without symbols.\n\nOn the pavement of St Peter’s Square is inlaid a sundial. The shadow cast by the Obelisk marks the movements of the sun. At noon on the zodiac signs and the two discs at either end, you can see the two solstices, summer and winter.\n\nTHE FACADE\n\nCarlo Maderno designed the entrance and façade who completed them in 1614. The façade is 114.69 metres wide and 48 metres high and surmounted by thirteen statues (almost 6 metres high) with the Blessing Redeemer statue in the centre. The façade has five entrances leading to the interior of the Basilica. Of the five doors, the middle one is remarkable, with 15th-century doors by Filarete. The Holy Door, whose opening officially starts the Holy Year, is the last one on the right.\n\nThe atrium created between 1608 and 1612.is considered one of Carlo Maderno’s most valuable works. At the back, in the left vestibule, is the equestrian monument of Charlemagne, while in the right vestibule is the statue of Emperor Constantine on horseback, made by Bernini in 1670.\n\nTHE INTERIOR\n\nThe Church is 187 metres long, 58 metres wide at the aisles’ level and 140 metres wide at the level of the transept; the maximum height of the vault in the nave is 46 metres (like a 15-storey building!). It has a central nave and two smaller side aisles. On the nave floor, a few metres from the entrance are the Rota Porphyretica, a porphyry disc on which Charlemagne knelt to receive the imperial crown from Leo III on Christmas Eve 800.\n\nProceeding towards the altar, you can see, marked on the floor, the bronze letters with which the lengths of the largest churches in the world. On the last pillar to the right, a famous bronze statue of St Peter seated and blessing – introduces the dome, whose luminous interior was decorated with mosaics by Cavalier d’Arpino in 1605\n\nIn the inner faces of the pillars are carved the niches that hold four colossal statues: St Longinus, the soldier who opened Jesus’ side with a lance and later converted to Christianity, a work by Bernini in 1638; St Helen, mother of Emperor Constantine, who brought the cross and nails of martyrdom to Rome; St Veronica, who is said to have wiped Christ’s face with a cloth on the road to Calvary, and finally St Andrew, brother of Peter, crucified in Greece.\n\nAt the centre of the Church, the famous bronze Baldachin 29 metres high, an early work by Bernini, executed between 1624 and 1632. The Baldachin surmounts the papal altar consists of four colossal twisted columns decorated with spiral grooves, olive and laurel branches, and angular statues of extraordinary elegance, culminating in a gilded bronze sphere. Note the bees (the heraldic emblem of the Barberini family, indicating their perseverance). Inside is a golden dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit. On the marble bases supporting the columns, a woman’s face is depicted seven times, from conception to a child’s birth, represented in the last frieze. It is a work by the young Borromini to magnify the Mater Ecclesia, Mother Church of all other churches. To make the Baldacchino was used, the bronze that covered the dome of the Pantheon.\n\nThe dome rises majestically above the canopy. The Latin inscription at the base of the dome reads: “You are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my Church, and to you, I will give the keys to the kingdom of heaven”.\n\nInside the Basilica there are numerous works of great artistic and religious value. On the way back to the entrance, in the first Chapel of the right aisle, you can admire the most famous of the masterpieces inside St. Peter’s, Michelangelo’s Pietà, a marble work created by the artist when he was only 23 years old. In succession is the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, executed by Bernini in 1674; the funeral monument to Gregory XIII (1572-1585); the monument to Clement XIII by Canova. The Altar of the Chair, another masterpiece by Bernini. The bronze Chair of Peter. The funerary monuments to Paul III by Guglielmo della Porta (left), and that to Urban VIII by Bernini. Another sculpture of great artistic importance is the one dedicated to Alexander VII, Bernini’s last work, created when the artist was eighty years old. The skeleton, which appears below the red drape, and the hourglass symbolise the passing of time and death’s inevitability.\n\nVATICAN CAVES and S.T. PETER’S TREASURE\n\nAn integral part of the Basilica is in the Vatican Grottoes, located between the floor of the Constantinian Basilica and the present one: here are the tombs of many Pontiffs Pius XII, Paul VI, John Paul I and John Paul II. From the caves, where chapels, statues, monuments and tombs follow one another, you can access the Pre-Constantine Necropolis. In this place, together with mausoleums from the 2nd-4th centuries, there is a modest monument, but the foundation of the Church of Rome: the tomb of Peter, in which, according to tradition, the remains of the Apostle are preserved. Recent archaeological investigations seem to confirm this.\n\nVisit\n\nEntrance to St. Peter’s Basilica is free of charge, and you can book a guided tour. Just a few steps from St Peter’s Basilica are the Vatican Museums with thousands of works of art collected over more than five centuries.\n\nAccess to the Dome\n\nElevator up to the terrace level and continue on foot (320 steps) Ticket 10€\n\nFoot up 551 steps Ticket 8 €.\n\nDistance 1,5 km 16′\n\nPONTE SISTO\n\nBETWEEN TWO BANKS\n\nPonte Sisto was built on the ruins of an ancient Roman bridge, dating back to 215 AD, at the time of the emperor of Caracalla, who wanted to unite the Tiber’s left bank Trastevere.\n\nmore\n\nBetween 366 and 367, Emperor Valentinian had a triumphal arch decorated with bronze statues erected for the first major restoration, now in the Museo Nazionale Romano. In 792 the bridge collapsed after a river flood and was consequently abandoned, so it took the name “Ruptus”, “Tremulus” or “Fractus” (broken). It was not until the Jubilee of 1475 that Sixtus IV commissioned Baccio Pontelli to rebuild the old bridge, which took Sixtus Bridge’s name after the pontiff. Before its construction, a boat connected the two banks Arenula on the left, and Renella on the opposite bank. In 1599 it was restored by Clement VIII, who had the paving and parapets renewed in travertine. In 1880, after the barriers’ construction, cast-iron parapets were placed, which significantly changed its appearance. The bridge, which is 108 metres long and 11 metres wide, consists of four arches with a large circular “occhialone” on the central pier, which functions as a detection and warning point in case of flooding the Tiber. The bridge was restored for the Jubilee of 2000 and has regained its fifteenth-century image. Ponte Sisto is only walkable, always crowded with people coming and going from Trastevere or stopping to enjoy the magnificent sunset light while looking towards the Tiber Island.\n\nDistance 2′\n\nTRASTEVERE\n\nTRASTEVERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TIBER\n\nFor many, Trastevere is the most beautiful district in Rome, without a doubt, the most characteristic.\n\nAs soon as you leave home, cross Ponte Sisto, and you will find yourself on the other side of the Tiber in the heart of the district.\n\nWhatever time you choose to cross the Tiber. We are sure you will be satisfied.\n\nWithout a doubt, the alleys of Trastevere are among the most characteristic of all Rome. From Piazza Trilussa to Santa Maria in Trastevere, passing through Vicolo del Cinque, Via della Scala, Vicolo del Moro or Vicolo del Bologna, you have the feeling of living in another time.\n\nmore\n\nTrastevere is beautiful to discover by day and experience by night. Trastevere is beautiful to discover by day and experience by night. Here, if you know how to choose, you can spend beautiful evenings having fun and enjoying good food. However, there are not many good trattorias and even fewer excellent restaurants. But I think I can suggest some useful addresses. Trastevere is a district with a long history, dating back as far as Etruscan times, but until Augustus, this area remained outside the city proper; it was only at the end of the Republican era that Trastevere began to be an inhabited area. In the imperial age, it became a vast district inhabited by workers and artisans and ordinary people. The district has preserved its original characteristics for centuries, showing every evidence of its appearance and the unmistakable sign of poverty and precariousness distinguished from the rest of the city. A disorderly cluster of houses and hovels distributed in a tangle of narrow streets and dark alleys around primitive churches.\n\nThese streets retained their principal character even in later centuries. No cardinals or high-ranking people ever lived here. Apart from a few rare exceptions, the district was never involved in the construction of sumptuous churches, nor were aristocratic palaces built here; at most, modest people lived here. In recent decades, Trastevere has become a prestigious and much sought-after area while retaining its popular character. Trastevere has remained unchanged over the centuries until the opening at the beginning of the last century of the ‘Viale del Re’, then ‘Viale del Lavoro’, now Viale Trastevere, which distorted its soul, dividing Trastevere into two parts. The neighbourhood is vast, and the things to see are potentially endless. Alleys, Churches, Sights\n\nTrastevere is a place to be experienced on foot. The best thing to do is walk around, look around and explore the district without a particular destination. In Trastevere Everywhere you go, you will find suggestive places! Like the Church of San Cosimato, and its almost secret but charming cloister. The Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere, and its mosaics, Sant’Agata in Trastevere. And then towards via della Lungara in a less frequented part of Trastevere you can visit the Botanical Garden, Villa Farnesina, the Palazzo and Galleria Corsini and the Church of Ss. Rufina and Seconda of the 12th century, San Giacomo alla Lungara or Settignano, Santa Maria della Luce IV century.\n\nTowards the Janiculum\n\nSan Pietro in Montorio and the small temple by Bramante.South beyond Viale Trastevere The Basilica of Santa Cecilia, 11th century San Benedetto in Piscinula, 5th century San Crisogono, 11th century San Francesco d’Assisi a Ripa Grande, San Giovanni Battista dei Genovesi, and these are just some of the infinite treasures of Trastevere.\n\nDistance 5′\n\nGIANICOLO\n\nTHE MOST ROMANTIC VIEW\n\nAbove Trastevere, we find the Gianicolo, undoubtedly one of the must-see places to enjoy a magnificent view of the city. Above Trastevere, we find the Gianicolo, undoubtedly one of the must-see places to enjoy a magnificent view of the city. The terrace of the Janiculum offers a breathtaking view of ancient Rome. Your gaze will wander from the rooftops to the ancient ruins, monuments, domes and as far as the horizon.\n\nmore\n\nYou can reach the Janiculum with a beautiful walk through the greenery and the walkways that intersect Via Garibaldi.\n\nThe Janiculum was the stage for the fighting for the Roman Republic in 1849.\n\nEighty-four busts of the heroes of those battles are along the green avenues.\n\nThere is also a cannonball on the side of San Pietro’s n Montorio church in memory.\n\nAn equestrian statue of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the hero of two worlds, dominates the square.\n\nAs well as offering a fantastic view over Rome and being a charming area for walking, and a favourite destination for couples looking for romantic spots, the Janiculum has much more to show.\n\nFontana dell’Acqua Paola, or Il Fontanone, a monumental marble fountain, created in the 17th century to celebrate the ancient Roman aqueduct’s reopening. And it is where the opening scene of ‘La Grande Bellezza’, the 2014 Oscar-winning film, was shot.\n\nThe Manfredi Lighthouse: The beautiful lighthouse built-in 1911 as a gift from the Italians who emigrated to Argentina.\n\nNot to be missed is the Church of San Pietro in Montorio wherein its courtyard is the Tempietto del Bramante, a small temple erected on the site where St Peter’s martyrdom crucified upside down, took place.\n\nDon’t miss Villa Doria Pamphilj, Rome’s largest public park with the splendid Casino del Respiro, located in the park’s centre, surrounded by a citrus grove and well-tended Italian gardens.\n\nAlso, the Museum of the Roman Republic and Garibaldi’s Memory at Porta San Pancrazio.\n\nCuriosities\n\nWhen you are at home or on the terrace, on time at noon, you will hear a slight roar; a cannon shot from the top of the Janiculum. This tradition dates back to Pius IX who, to avoid time confusion, instituted this service in 1846.\n\nDistance: 1.6 km 18 min.\n\nGHETTO\n\nAN ENCHANTED CORNER, A PIECE OF CITY EXPOSES YOU TO THE CHARM OF ALLEYWAYS AN MEMORY.\n\nThe Sant’Angelo district at the Capitol’s foot is the smallest of the Roman districts its area is bounded by Largo Arenula, via delle Botteghe Oscure, via dell’Aracoeli, via del Teatro di Marcello Lungotevere de’ Cenci. The site is still primarily known and referred to as the Jewish Ghetto of Rome. The district is one of the most fascinating, famous for its history and its restaurants. People come here to enjoy the delicious dishes of traditional Judaic-Roman cuisine.\n\nmore\n\nThe real creator of the Ghetto was Paul IV Carafa, who on 14 July 1555, with the bull “Cum nimis absurdum”, wanted to separate the houses of the Jews from those of the Christians, enclosing the area with a wall and three gates, on Piazza Giudia near S.Angelo in Pescheria and near S. Gregorio de Quattro Campora.\n\nIn 1586 pope Sixtus V enlarged the Ghetto towards the Tiber. The real creator of the Ghetto was Paul IV Carafa, who on 14 July 1555, with the bull “Cum nimis absurdum”, wanted to separate the houses of the Jews from those of the Christians, enclosing the area with a wall and three gates, on Piazza Giudia near S.Angelo in Pescheria and near S. Gregorio de Quattro Campora. In 1586 pope Sixtus V enlarged the Ghetto towards the Tiber.\n\nThe entrances were closed from dusk to dawn; The gates opened only for those who had a special permit or those who had to exercise the only two trades allowed: street sale of rags and loans to usury.\n\nFor more than three centuries, the Roman Ghetto was an urban unicum, overcrowded, degraded, bringing disease and death. Social differences were inevitable: wealthy families lived in houses far from the river, while the poorest lived there. Here the dark, sunless dwellings were frequently submerged by the waters, in a perpetual state of mud and damp. In 1848 Pius IX erased the shame of the “Ghetto” by ordering the walls and gates to be knocked down.\n\nThe Ghetto was finally abolished only after 1870. Most of the old streets, alleys and buildings were demolished by 1888. Historically, the area of the district encompasses the site where the great Circus Flaminius once stood.\n\nEven today, it is possible to see many Roman times’ testimonials on the older buildings’ walls. Among the Roman remains in this district are the remains of the Portico d’Ottavia, built in the 2nd century B.C. and modified a hundred years later by Emperor Octavian Augustus, who dedicated it to his sister Octavia, and Transformed, in the Middle Ages, into a fish market. An inscription in Latin is still visible today: ‘the heads of the fish longer than this marble plaque must be given to the Conservators up to and including the first fins’. ‘The Conservators were the civic administrators’.\n\nParts of the original paving can still be seen at the portico’s foot, showing that the former ground level was much lower than it is today. Behind the elaborate stand, three tall columns were belonging to the temple of Apollo Sosianus, dating from around 430 BC. Next to the temple is a two-storey theatre, built at the end of the 1st century B.C. and dedicated to Marcellus, nephew of Octavian Augustus. The theatre initially had three levels, but what is striking about these impressive ruins is that an entire palace is on top of them. The theatre mutated into a fortress in the 12th century, and by the 14th century, it became the property of the powerful Savelli family.\n\nAt the very end of the district, next to the theatre is the Church of San Nicola in Carcere. The Church founded in the early Middle Ages; its left side preserves some columns of a small pre-existing temple. Today, many columns, capitals and cornices found in the excavations lie in the area between the theatre and the temples.\n\nSituated at the northern end of the small district, Torre Margana, one of Rome’s surviving medieval family towers, dominates the winding alleyways network below, which give this part of Sant’Angelo an appearance still very close to the original.\n\nWithin the walls of the Ghetto, thousands of Jews were forced to live in old, tiny houses, but just outside its gates, wealthy families lived in sumptuous palaces. One of them is Palazzo Costaguti, whose main entrance originally opened onto Via della Reginella. But since after the establishment of the Ghetto this alley led to the infamous enclosure, the owners bricked up the door and opened another one just around the corner, in the small Piazza Mattei where the famous Fountain of the Turtles stands, as well as Palazzo Mattei, consisting of five separate palaces, built between the late 15th and early 17th centuries.\n\nAlthough most of the alleys that were once part of the Ghetto have disappeared, the plan of the innermost part of the district is still reasonably faithful to the original. Many houses dating from the late 1400s to the mid-1500s along the northern side of Via Portico d’Ottavia maintain their original appearance.\n\nContinuing out of the Rione, you can reach the Fori Imperiali and the Colosseum in a few minutes if you go left, the Bocca della Verità and the Circo Massimo if you go right.\n\nDistance 5′ minutes – 400 m\n\nWhere to eat in the Ghetto\n\nIn the Ghetto, of course, the main attraction is the Judaic-Roman cuisine with its traditional recipes, where the symbol is the artichoke.\n\nDiscover our suggestions Discover the best restaurants\n\nFORI IMPERIALI\n\nFORUM of CAESAR- FORUM of AUGUSTUS – FORUM of PEACE – FORUM of NERVA – FORUM of TRAJAN\n\nThe Fori Imperiali area is undoubtedly one of the most famous and at the same time, most fascinating archaeological and historic sites in the world. It is located in Rome’s heart, along the same name street, between Piazza Venezia and the Colosseum. The Fori Imperiali area is undoubtedly one of the most famous and at the same time, most fascinating archaeological and historic sites in the world. It is located in Rome’s heart, along the same name street, between Piazza Venezia and the Colosseum. Until the twentieth century Via dei Fori Imperiali did not yet exist. Between 1924 and 1932 the demolition of all the buildings in the area began and Via dei Fori Imperiali was built, bringing to light many archaeological finds and erasing centuries of history and evidence.\n\nmore\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Forum of Caesar\n\nLooking towards the Colosseum on the right we find the first of the Imperial Forums. It is the Forum of Caesar. Started in 54 B.C., immediately after Gaul’s conquest, and completed in 46, it was an enlargement of the Roman Forum. It stretched between the Roman Forum, the Quirinal Hill and the Capitoline Hill. Caesar expropriated at a high price the private houses that stood in the area and bought all the land necessary for his project’s realisation to realise the project. The Forum looked like a long and narrow square surrounded by colonnades with two naves. Inside the Forum there are still the remains of the Temple of Venus Genetrix, the Tabernae, the Basilica Argentaria, and a semicircular latrine considered the largest in the ancient world.\n\nThe Peace Forum\n\nThe Temple of Peace, called the Forum of Peace only from the late imperial era, was built by Emperor Vespasian between 71 and 75 A.D. to commemorate the Jewish victory of 70 A.D. It is a large rectangular square with a temple on the backside, dedicated to peace. On either side of the temple were four large halls, two on each side; during the 6th century A.D., one of these rooms was transformed into the Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian. In the adjoining hall, the Forma Urbis, the great map of Rome made at Septimius Severus’s time and engraved on marble slabs. The Forum’s central area was a garden, with flowerbeds and fountains for water games. The Forum of Peace also contained many works of art, including the seven-armed candelabrum transported from Jerusalem and several statues, which had previously decorated Nero’s, Domus Aurea.\n\nThe Forum of Augustus\n\nThe Forum of Augustus is In front of Caesar’s Forum. It is the second in order of time and inaugurated in 2 B.C. The Forum of Augustus was limited on the backside by a grandiose wall of 33 metres high made of peperino blocks and stone, which isolated it from the district of Suburra at that time a slum. It was built at the behest of Octavian Augustus, together with the temple of Mars Ultor a magnificent building in white Carrara marble with eight columns on the front and seven on the long sides; three are still visible. Large porticoes and two semicircular exedras surrounded the forum square with niches. Inside the slots were statues of triumphant members of the Giulia family. At the end of the portico on the left, a large square hall, whose back wall contained a colossal statue, probably the Colossus of Augustus. On the north side of the Forum is the House of the Knights of Rhodes, with its magnificent loggia.\n\nThe Forum of Nerva\n\nDomitian (81-96 A.D.) built The Forum but inaugurated only after his death by his successor Nerva in 97 A.D. The name Transitory derives from the fact that it was in the long and narrow space between the Forum of Peace, Caesar’s Forum, and Augustus’s Forum. On the short side towards the Suburra, a temple to Minerva, protector of Domitian. All the colonnade remains are two columns called “le colonnacce” and a section of the back wall on the side towards what is now Via Cavour. On the attic, a bas-relief of Minerva, while on the frieze there are scenes of women’s work. Behind the temple of Minerva, there is a sizeable horseshoe-shaped exedra. In 1606 the temple of Minerva, until then well preserved, was destroyed by pope Paul V to build the Acqua Paola fountain on the Janiculum with its recovered materials.\n\nThe Forum of Trajan\n\nThe works started by Domitian were partly continued by Trajan, who gave his name to the fourth Forum. The last and largest of Rome’s forums, the complex includes the splendid Trajan’s Column, a funerary monument to the emperor. The shaft is 30 metres high with a magnificent spiral bas-relief depicting more than two thousand five hundred figures narrating Trajan’s two battles against the Dacians. Inside the column, there is a spiral staircase leading from the base where Trajan was buried, now replaced by St Peter’s statue. And the Basilica Ulpia, the largest of the Roman period, built to the design of Apollodorus of Damascus between 106 and 113 AD, of which part of the splendid coloured marble floor remains. Behind Trajan’s Column and the Basilica Ulpia, the Syrian architect Apollodorus also built the Trajan’s Markets for the retail trade.\n\nTrajan’s Markets\n\nAn imposing complex, begun in 107 but completed under Hadrian, it was considered by the ancients to be the eighth wonder of the world. The architectural and statuary remains are the first nucleus of the Imperial Forum Museum.\n\nThe Imperial Forum Museum\n\nThe Imperial Forum Museum is the first museum of ancient architecture housed in Trajan’s Markets. In Rome, the Imperial Forum Museum is both an archaeological museum and an excellent Roman historical site open to the public. It fully represents the concept that artefacts should be kept in their original context, which becomes a “place-museum” like this one. Topographically and conceptually linked to the grandiose urban system of the Imperial Forums: with the Forum of Caesar (46 B.C.), the Forum of Augustus (2 B.C.), the Forum of the Temple of Peace (75 A.D.), the Forum of Nerva (97 A.D.) and the Forum of Trajan (112 and 113 AD).\n\nDistance: 1.6 km 18 min.\n\nVisit\n\nIt is possible to visit all the Forums with a single ticket.\n\nThe Trajan’s Markets and the Museum of the Imperial Forums not are included.\n\nOnline booking is mandatory.\n\nIMPERIAL FORUMS\n\nOpening hours: Daily 9.30-19.30Ticket prices:\n\nFull € 11.50.

It owes its current name to a colossal bronze statue depicting Nero that, in the 2nd century A.D., stood a few metres from it next to the Domus Aurea.\n\nThe construction of the Colosseum started in 72 B.C. with Vespasian and ended in 80 with Titus. With its 188 metres long, the Colosseum, 156 metres wide and 57 metres high, became the largest Roman amphitheatre. The Colosseum allowed more than 50,000 people to attend their favourite shows. Exhibitions of exotic animals, executions of prisoners, reproductions of battle scenes, and gladiator fights were for years the Romans’ entertainment spectacles.\n\nmore\n\nThe Colosseum made of white travertine rose on four floors. In the first three, there were columns and niches, in each of which there was a statue. On the last level, where there were only windows, masonry and wooden supports support a huge tarpaulin (velarium), which served to protect the spectators from the sun and the rain.\n\nThe arena, 76m x 46m, was made of wood and covered with sand. There was a dense series of tunnels. In the basement were kept the beasts and stored the stage equipment. If you want you can go down into the belly of the monument, and visit these rooms that still preserve the state they were in at the end of the 5th century A.D. During the Roman Empire and under the motto “Panem et circenses” the Colosseum was in operation for more than 500 years, and its last shows happened in the 6th century.\n\nStarting from the V century, with the abolition of the gladiatorial games by Valentinian III, the Colosseum underwent a slow and progressive decline. It became a shelter for animals, a place for handicraft workshops and houses. For centuries the Colosseum has been plundered and used as a quarry for materials. To construct St Peter’s Basilica and civil buildings such as Palazzo Barberini, the marble of the facade and some internal parts of the Colosseum have been used.\n\nIn our time only one-third of the original construction remained.\n\nUntil the end of ancient times, Colosseum hosted shows of great popular appeal, today it is itself a spectacle and a symbol of human ingenuity that has survived anything and everything.\n\nIn addition to being a World Heritage Site, in July 2007 it was included among the New Seven Wonders of the World, along with the Great Wall of China, the ancient Jordanian city of Petra, the Statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the Inca Ruins of Machu Picchu, Peru, the Mayan Pyramid of Chichen Itza, Mexico, and the Taj Mahal, India.\n\nVISITING THE COLOSSEUM\n\nThe Colosseum is open to the public every day, except 25 December and 1 January, from 8:30 in the morning to afternoon-evening (5:00 p.m. in winter, 7:30 p.m. in summer).\n\nTicket – full price € 16,00 + € 2,00 booking fee\n\nThe ticket is valid for 24 hours and also allows entry to the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill.

The first arrangement of the valley as a place for chariot races dates back to the Tarquini kings’ time, but it was not until Julius Caesar built a real brick Circus. The races that took place in the Circus were the most popular competitive activities among the Romans, in addition to the gladiatorial games: the people idolised the drivers of the chariots\n\nmore\n\nRepeatedly by fire, the Circus Maximus was almost wholly rebuilt under Trajan, to whose period most of the currently visible structures belong. The Circus remained until the first decades of the 6th century.\n\nThe Circus was demolished, plundered and used as farmland, until the beginning of the 20th century, when it became an archaeological promenade.\n\nToday it is possible to visit the galleries that once led to the steps of the cavea (the senators on the ground floor and the plebs on the upper floor). You can walk along the external paved road found during the excavations, where there is a sizeable basin-drinking trough made of travertine slabs and visit some rooms used as shops (tabernae). You can see the Arch of Titus’s bases in the central area of the arena, one of Rome’s largest triumphal arches. And the medieval 12th-century Torre della Moletta.\n\nAccording to one of the legends leading to Rome’s origins, it is here that the Rape of the Sabine Women took place. When Rome was founded, the legend says Romulus wanted to make alliances with neighbouring peoples and try to obtain women to procreate with to populate the new city. However, the neighbouring peoples refused to grant this favour to the new king of Rome. Romulus then decided to deceive them by organising a fabulous spectacle in their favour to lure them in and then kidnap their women during the event. A war ensues, which is interrupted only thanks to the pleas of the women who have suffered the affront.\n\nThe men listened to their pleas, stopped fighting and entered a period of peace.\n\nPALATINE\n\nAt 40 metres above the Roman Forum, the Palatine is the most central of the seven hills and the oldest part of Rome’s city. The hill was the site of essential city cults, including that of the Magna Mater. Between the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C., it became the residential quarter of the Roman aristocracy, with elegant residences characterised by exceptional pictorial and floor decorations, such as those preserved in the House of the Griffins. Augustus symbolically chose the hill as his residence site, which consisted of several buildings, including the House of Livia. Later the hill became the imperial palaces’ site: the Domus Tiberiana, the Domus Transitoria, and finally the Domus Flavia. During the Renaissance, the Palatine became the property of aristocratic families who planted villas, vineyards, and gardens: part of the charming Horti Farnesiani, on the upper part of the hill Loggia Stati-Mattei still preserved today.\n\nMythology tells us that the cave where Luperca, the she-wolf who suckled Romulus and Remus, lived was on Mount Palatine.\n\nPalatine Hill is a very picturesque place where you can find the most extraordinary corners of Ancient Rome and where you have the Roman Forum’s best views.\n\nPalatine Museum: This small museum display finds from excavations in the Palatine area. It contains sculptures, frescoes, mosaics and other objects from the hill’s heyday.\n\nVisiting the Palatine Hill\n\nAccess to the Palatine is only possible by booking online.\n\nThe Palatine is part of the Colosseum Archaeological Park and can be visited with a single ticket.

It takes its name Trevi about the ‘Trivio’ (i.e. the crossroads of three streets) which corresponded to the current Piazza dei Crociferi.\n\nThe origin of the Fountain dates back to 19 B.C., when it was the end of the aqueduct, the Aqua Virgo (Virgin Aqueduct), the only one of the ancient aqueducts still in use today, which Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa brought to Rome to supply his baths.\n\nmore\n\nThe Trevi Fountain was built by Pope Clement XII in 1732, based on architect Nicola Salvi’s design. The Fountain, entirely leaning against Palazzo Poli’s back, is 20 metres wide and 26 metres high and rises over the large basin like a broad cliff. The central part develops like a triumphal arch, with a large niche and Corinthian columns at the sides. The top centre is an inscription ‘CLEMENS XII PONT MAX’, reminding us that Clement XII commissioned the construction. The centre is the statue of Ocean driving a shell-shaped chariot, pulled by two winged sea horses, one angry and the other peaceful, guided by two tritons, one young and the other adult, to highlight the different characteristics of the age of man and nature.\n\nThere are also two reliefs alluding to the legend of the spring and the history of the aqueduct and four statues that, in order: looking from the left, symbolise the Abundance of Fruit, the Fertility of the Fields, the Gifts of Autumn and the Amenity of the Meadows. In the side niches Salubrity and Abundance statues. Two allegorical figures are extolling the beneficial effects of water: On the right, the Virgin points out the spring to the Roman soldiers. On the other side, Agrippa ordering the start of construction work on the aqueduct. The statues of Salubrity and Abundance, placed in the side niches, complete the decorations.\n\nAccording to tradition, the tourist who throws a coin into the Fountain will surely return to Rome.\n\nWhen to visit the Trevi Fountain\n\nWhichever way you look at it, the Trevi Fountain will magically appear before your eyes, filling them with wonder. The Fountain is always beautiful, even during the busiest hours of the day, but superb at night. It is only a 12-minute walk from home, so you choose the time of day that suits you best.\n\nDistance: 1.5 km 15 min Bus 62\n\nSPANISH STEPS\n\nTHE CITY DRAWING ROOM\n\nPiazza di Spagna, one of the most beautiful and famous squares in Rome owes its name to the Spanish Embassy located nearby.\n\nThe Staircase, built at the behest of Pope Benedict XIII between 1723-25, was inaugurated during the pontificate of Pope Innocent XIII. It was designed by Francesco de Santis who created what was later described as the most famous ‘architectural spectacle’ in the world. It consists of 12 ramps and 135 travertine steps, the Staircase also includes several resting areas.\n\nDe Santis’ intention was to create a staircase that would be a meeting place for all citizens. In fact, even today, the stairway is a meeting place, so much so that it is called the ‘drawing room of Rome’. Even though it has been forbidden to stand on its steps for some time.\n\nmore\n\nAt the foot of the steps is the famous Fountain known as the ‘Barcaccia’. It was built in the Baroque style by Pietro Bernini (father of Gian Lorenzo) in 1627 for Pope Urban VIII. Pietro Bernini exploited the depiction of a boat in apparent danger of sinking to eliminate the problem of low water pressure feeding the Fountain. The bees and suns decorating the Fountain are symbols of Urban VIII’s family, the Barberini.\n\nThe Twin Palaces\n\nAt the beginning of the Staircase on both sides are the twin palaces. The one on the right side is called the Casina Rossa.\n\nThe Casina Rossa belonged to a lady called Anna Angeletti, who rented out rooms to tourists visiting Rome. It was here that the poet Keats, who had rented a room on the second floor with his friend, the painter Joseph Severn, spent the last days of his life. He died there on 23 February 1821 at the age of 26.\n\nThe Casina Rossa is now a charming little museum dedicated to the poet and the other English Romantic poets Shelley and Lord Byron. On the other side of the Staircase, stands the twin palace. On the ground floor is Babington’s tea room, founded in 1893 by two enterprising English ladies, the place still exists today and if you feel like treating yourself to a little luxury it is a recommended place despite the prices.\n\nIf you love art and have some time on your hands, you could also visit the Giorgio De Chirico House Museum in the 17th-century Palazzetto del Borgognoni at number 31 Piazza di Spagna.\n\nAt the top of the steps from which you can admire one of the most beautiful views of Rome is the 1495 Trinità dei Monti Church. Inside there are two works by Daniele da Volterra, the same artist called by Pope Pius IV to cover the nudity of the Last Judgement in the Sistine Chapel and since then nicknamed “braghettone”.\n\nThe interior of the Convent of Trinità dei Monti has preserved for centuries some wonders such as the cloister, two anamorphosis frescoes on the corridors of the cloister, a sundial (the so-called astrolabe), the refectory painted by the Jesuit Andrea Pozzo, and the Chapel of Mater Admirabilis.\n\nFrom Trinità dei Monti along the Pincio promenade you can reach Piazza del Popolo or Villa Borghese.\n\nPiazza di Spagna is an unmissable point of departure or arrival for lovers of shopping all ‘around are concentrated all the streets that host the windows of the major designers in the world.\n\nAnd Via Margutta, the street where Vacanze Romane was set, is just a few metres away.

Piazza del Popolo’s obelisk is the first one transported to Rome at Augustus era and initially placed in the Circus Maximus. Then there are the other fountains, the two shell-shaped ones with groups of sculptures on top, symbolising the god Neptune with tritons and the goddess Rome with the personifications of the Tiber and the Aniene on either side of the square. There are also two fountains made from ancient sarcophagi on the side of the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo and the symmetrically opposed building. The obelisk backgrounds are Carlo Fontana’s twin churches Santa Maria di Montesanto (1662-1679) and Santa Maria dei Miracoli (1675-1681).\n\nmore\n\nSANTA MARIA DEL POPOLO\n\nSanta Maria del Popolo is one of the most significant buildings of the Roman Renaissance, not only for its architectural features but also for the paintings and sculptures it houses. The Church arose from a small chapel built at the behest of Pope Paschal II. Rebuilt in the 15th century at the time of Pope Sixtus IV, it was modified in the 17th century and is associated with Bramante, Sansovino, Pinturicchio, Mino Da Fiesole, Raphael, Bernini and Caravaggio. Caravaggio’s works include The Conversion of St. Paul and The Crucifixion of St. Peter, which together with Annibale Carracci’s Assumption, adorn the Cerasi chapel to the left of the high altar.\n\nThe Church\n\nInside there are numerous tomb slabs on the floor, dating from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The chapels abound in funerary monuments and works of art. The most important of these is the Chigi Chapel, designed by Raphael for the banker Agostino Chigi from 1513 and completed in 1656 by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Raphael made the cartoons for the dome’s mosaics and the design for the pyramid tombs of Agostino Chigi. The statue of Jonah was made by Lorenzetto to a design by Raphael, while Habakkuk and the Angel and Daniel in the lion’s den are the work of Bernini. The altarpiece is by Sebastiano del Piombo and Salviati.\n\nCerasi Chapel: Caravaggio\n\nThe Chapel, near the altar, houses two masterpieces by Caravaggio: the Crucifixion of St Peter, painted around 1601, and the Conversion of St Paul, from the same period. The two canvases, painted in oils, were commissioned from Caravaggio in September 1600 by Tiberio Cerasi. To Annibale, Carracci was commissioned to paint the altarpiece depicting the Assumption of the Virgin.\n\nFree admission\n\nWorkdays and Saturdays 8.30 – 12.00 / 16.00 – 18.00\n\nDistance 2 km bus 628\n\nTHE TREASURES of ROME\n\nRome has an impressive number of places to visit that a year would not be enough to see.

At the end of the left aisle, in the Contarelli Chapel, you can admire the “Vocation of St. Matthew”, the “Martyrdom of St. Matthew“, and “St. Matthew and the Angel”, which Caravaggio painted when he was only 20 years old.\n\nNot far away is the Basilica di Sant’Agostino in Campo Marzio, which in the first chapel on the left, next to the entrance, houses the “Madonna dei Pellegrini”, painted between 1604 and 1606, with Mary’s face “borrowed” from Lena Antognetti, a famous courtesan of the time.\n\nContinuing your walk in less than 15 minutes, you arrive at Piazza del Popolo inside the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo. In the Cerasi Chapel, Caravaggio has two great works, “Conversion of St Paul” and “Crucifixion of St Peter“, made between 1600 and 1601.\n\nIt is possible to discover other works by Caravaggio at the Doria Pamphilj Gallery, which houses three works by the master: the “Penitent Magdalene” dated around 1595, the “Rest during the Flight into Egypt” also dated around 1595, and one of the two versions of “Saint John the Baptist” dated 1602. The Doria Pamphilj Gallery is located in via del Corso 305 not far from piazza Venezia.\n\nAt the Vatican Museums:\n\nYou can find the “Deposition of Christ” made between 1602 and 1604.\n\nAt Palazzo Barberini in Via delle Quattro Fontane, “Judith and Holofernes” of 1599. And the “Narcissus”, one of Caravaggio’s most impressive works.\n\nAt the Capitoline Museums in the hall of the Pinacoteca, there are two works: the “Buona Ventura” painted between 1593 and 1594 and the “San Giovanni Battista” of 1602.\n\nThe National Gallery of Ancient Art in Palazzo Corsini houses the second version of ‘St. John the Baptist’.\n\nAnd at the Galleria Borghese, the place with the largest number of Caravaggio’s works in Rome. “The Boy with a Basket of Fruit”‘ and the ‘Sick Bacchus’ two works from Caravaggio’s youth and the ‘Madonna of the Palafrenieri’ and ‘David with the Head of Goliath‘ works of more mature Caravaggio\n\ncontinua\n\nTrastevere è bella da scoprire di giorno e viverla la notte.\n\nQui se saprete scegliere, potrete trascorrere delle magnifiche serate all’insegna del divertimento e della buona cucina. Anche se le buone trattorie non sono tante ed ancora più raro qualche ottimo ristorante. Ma penso di essere in grado di suggerirvi qualche buon indirizzo.\n\nTrastevere è un quartiere dalla lunga storia, che parte addirittura dal tempo degli Etruschi, ma fino ai tempi di Augusto questa zona è rimasta al di fuori della città vera e propria; e soltanto alla fine dell’età repubblicana Trastevere cominciò ad essere un’area abitata. Diventando in età imperiale un immenso quartiere abitato da operai ed artigiani e gente del popolo. Il rione ha conservato per secoli le caratteristiche originali, mostrando con ogni evidenza il suo aspetto ed il segno inequivocabile di povertà e di precarietà che lo distinguevano dal resto della città. Un ammasso disordinato di case e casupole distribuite in un groviglio di strette vie e vicoli bui intorno a primitive chiese.\n\nQueste vie hanno mantenuto in loro carattere fortemente popolare anche nei secoli successivi. Qui non risiedettero mai cardinali, o persone di alto rango, il rione a parte qualche rara eccezione non fu mai interessato dalla costruzione di chiese sontuose né tantomeno vi furono creati palazzi aristocratici, al massimo ci andarono a vivere figure di modesto livello. Solo negli ultimi decenni Trastevere è diventata una zona prestigiosa ed anche molto ambita pur conservando il suo carattere popolare. Trastevere è rimasta immutata nei secoli fino all’ apertura all’inizio dello scorso secolo del “viale del Re”, poi “viale del Lavoro” oggi viale Trastevere, che ne ha stravolto l’anima dividendo Trastevere in due parti mai più rinsaldate.\n\nIl quartiere è molto grande e le cose da vedere sono potenzialmente infinite.\n\nVicoli, Chiese, Angoli Suggestivi\n\nTrastevere è un luogo che va vissuto a piedi. La cosa più bella da fare è passeggiare, guardarsi attorno ed esplorare il rione senza una meta precisa. Ovunque andrete a Trastevere troverete luoghi suggestivi!.\n\nCome la Chiesa di San Cosimato, ed il suo Chiostro quasi segreto ma incredibilmente bello. La Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere, e i suoi mosaici, Sant’Agata in Trastevere.\n\nE poi Verso via della Lungara in una parte di Trastevere meno frequentata potrete visitare l’Orto Botanico, Villa Farnesina, il Palazzo e Galleria Corsini e la chiesa di Ss. Rufina e Seconda del XII secolo, San Giacomo alla Lungara o in Settignano, Santa Maria della Luce IV secolo.\n\nVerso il Gianicolo\n\nSan Pietro in Montorio ed il tempietto del Bramante.\n\nA Sud oltre Viale trastevere\n\nLa Basilica di Santa Cecilia, San Benedetto in Piscinula XI secolo, San Crisogono V secolo, San Francesco d’Assisi a Ripa Grande XI secolo, San Giovanni Battista dei Genovesi, e questi sono solo alcuni degliinfiniti tesori di Trastevere.\n\nSECRET ROME\n\nThe least known Rome\n\nRome is an immense treasure of beautiful places to visit. Many monuments and sites that everyone knows. But there are many other equally beautiful and curious places that if you have time left or your stay is longer than the canonical three days or if this is not the first time you visit the city we invite you to get to know some other interesting places.\n\ncontinua\n\nACETARY ARCH\n\nThe small courtyard of Arco degli Acetari is where time seems to have stopped in the Middle Ages. Not far from Campo de’ Fiori, in Via del Pellegrino, at number 19, you will find an entrance that leads you into a small courtyard whose architecture, colours, plants, and ancient atmosphere will surely amaze you.\n\nThe Church of St Ignatius Loyola\n\nThe Church of Sant’Ignazio Loyola is located between the Pantheon and Piazza Venezia. It overlooks Piazza di Sant’Ignazio the Rococo Baroque square designed by the architect Filippo Raguzzini around 1728 evokes a real theatre scene, with three symmetrical buildings with concave shapes. They represent the superimposition of three ellipses. Inside the church in the 17th century, Andrea Pozzo created some perspective visions of rare beauty.\n\nTHE FAKE DOME\n\nIt is one of Andrea Pozzo‘s most famous works and is best known for its effect of awe and wonder. With a play on perspective, the artist creates a false architecture through which Pozzo’s painting shifts the vanishing point of perspective towards the nave’s vault. The effect captures the visitor advancing through the church. It looks like a dome, but a closer look reveals that the ceiling is flat!\n\nTHE VAULT\n\nThe large fresco in the vault is the centrepiece of the church’s decoration. Pozzo creates a play of perspective that gives the sensation of infinite space.\n\nTHE PRESBYTERY\n\nThe perspective effect is terrific: the apse wall looks polygonal when it is actually concave.\n\nSCIARRA GALLERY\n\nA few steps away from the Trevi Fountain, you can’t miss the wonderful Sciarra Gallery. To find it, you have to walk along Via Minghetti, and at n° 10, after crossing the entrance, you will be inside the wonderful Sciarra Gallery with its grand liberty style. Access is free, but it is only open during daylight hours and rarely on Sundays.\n\nThe anamorphosis of the Convent of Trinità dei Monti\n\nAt the top of the Spanish Steps is the Church of Trinità dei Monti with its Convent. The convent of Trinità dei Monti The latter is a treasure chest containing several masterpieces unknown to most people that really deserve to be discovered. Among them is the anamorphic painting of St Francis of Paola: if observed from a transverse view, the saint appears under the branches of an olive tree, but if you look at it from a frontal perspective, the saint disappears, and a coastal landscape appears.\n\nAnamorphism is an optical effect whereby the subject of a painting only appears to the viewer when seen from a certain point.\n\nThere is also a spectacular view of the city from the church towers.\n\nWhen to visit: second and fourth Wednesday of the month at 9 am, and Saturdays at 9 am, and 11 am with a guided tour. Reservation is compulsory on the Convent’s website.\n\nZUCCARI Palace\n\nClimb to the top of the Spanish Steps and turn right onto Via Gregoriana, where you will find Palazzo Zuccari. Also known as the House of Monsters, it is undoubtedly a curious as well as exciting stop. It was built at the end of the 1500s with rather bizarre architecture, which arouses a lot of amazement. The entrance to the palace was designed by its creator, Federico Zuccari, to inspire fear and astound guests once they crossed the threshold with the beauty of the garden (which no longer exists) behind the door.\n\nWhen to visit: The palace is now home to the Hertziana Library and can be visited by appointment.\n\nCOPPEDE’ DISTRICT\n\nAway from the centre, I invite you to discover the Coppedè district.\n\nThe Coppedè district, which is not really a district but only a tiny area within the Trieste district, can be reached by tram 19 or bus 60. It is a district that few people know about, unique in its kind, where the buildings’ architectural style and uniqueness (the Palazzo del Ragno, the Palazzi degli Ambasciatori and the Villini delle Fate) that rise around the Fountain of Frogs will surely leave you fascinated.\n\nTHE HOUSE OF OWLS\n\nIn the Trieste district, not far from the Coppedè district, inside Villa Torlonia is the Casina delle Civette, a mountain hut transformed into an Art Nouveau residence at the behest of Alessandro Torlonia. The name comes from the stained glass windows on the ground floor. The Casina delle Civette is part of the network of municipal museums in Rome. It can be visited from Tuesday to Sunday together with the 19th century Casino Nobile, home to the Museum of the Villa and the collection of works of the Roman School, the Casino dei Principi, home to exhibitions and the Archives of the Roman School, and the Mussolini Bunker.\n\nTRASTEVERE\n\nTrastevere is not only restaurants and folklore\n\nIn Piazza San Cosimato, even if it is not easy to find, there is the Cloister of San Cosimato, even if it is not so easy to find. You get there through a doorway that overlooks the square on the side opposite the market. Then, cross a small garden that leads to the two enchanting cloisters. Access is free. The first cloister dates back to 1260, the second to 1400. The Cloisters are of the Regina Margherita Hospital, but access is accessible to anyone wishing to visit them.\n\nThe Ancient Pharmacy of Santa Maria della Scala\n\nThe Antica Farmacia di Trastevere is the oldest pharmacy in Rome and was established in 1600. Initially, it was part of the monastery next door and was for internal use. Then, it was opened to the public and became the most famous apothecary’s shop in Rome, where prominent personalities such as princes, popes and doctors were supplied, so much so that it became known as the ‘pharmacy of the popes’.\n\nToday, it still retains the original furnishings, ampoules and machinery used to create ointments and pills. However, when you cross the pharmacy threshold, you will step back in time because everything here has stopped in 1700. The Ancient Pharmacy of Santa Maria della Scala remained in operation until 1954.\n\nOn request, it can be visited by writing an email to this address anticafarmaciadellascala@gmail.com and asking when visits are scheduled. There are usually 2 or 3 per week at various times. The visit lasts about 40 minutes and costs €5.\n\nTHE BOTANICAL GARDEN\n\nIn Trastevere, there is a beautiful botanical garden where you can visit the cactus greenhouses, walk through the Mediterranean forest, admire hundreds of different roses, walk through the Japanese garden and even enter a butterfly greenhouse.\n\nThe best time to visit the Botanical Garden is in spring, especially between the end of March and April, when the cherry trees bloom.\n\nThe Botanical Garden is open every day until 18.30\n\nTHE CAPUCHIN CRYPT\n\nThe Capuchin Crypt was decorated with the bones of 4000 Capuchin friars collected over some 300 years from the Cemetery of the Capuchin Order. The idea may seem macabre, but it is actually a way of exorcising death and emphasising the importance of the soul over the body.\n\nIt is on Via Veneto in the Church of Santa Maria Immacolata\n\nAccess to the crypt is by purchasing a ticket for €8, which is open every day. In addition, it is possible to combine the visit with a concert of Gregorian chants inside the church with a special ticket.\n\nTHE MUNICIPAL ROSE GARDEN\n\nOn the Aventine Hill, between April and July, the municipal rose garden displays more than 1100 varieties of roses from all over the world – an unmissable spectacle of nature. In the 3rd century B.C., a temple to the goddess Flora stood here and was celebrated in April. Covered with vegetable gardens and vineyards until the end of the 16th century, in 1645, it became the Jewish garden with a small community cemetery attached. When it became the site of the new municipal rose garden. In gratitude to the Jewish community, which had made it possible to recreate the rose garden in a sacred place, a stele was placed at the entrance to the garden in memory of its previous use. The paths dividing the flowerbeds in the collection area took the form of the menorah, the seven-branched candelabrum, the symbol of Judaism.\n\nOn Rome’s birthday, 21 April, the Rose Garden opens every year and remains open during the summer. It also opens for 2 weeks in October for the autumn flowering.\n\nNON-CATHOLIC CEMETERY\n\nClose the Pyramid of Caius Cestius, a small cemetery called the Non-Catholic Cemetery or the English Cemetery.\n\nIts history begins in the early 1700s. At that time, ecclesiastical regulations prohibited the burial of non-Catholics in churches or consecrated lands. Therefore Protestants, as well as people of other faiths, did not have a proper burial place. It was not until around 1716 that land was granted for the burial of English Protestants in exile. From then on, the area between the pyramid and the Aurelian Wall became a cemetery for non-Catholics. Among others buried in the Cemetery are the Swedish sculptor Hendrik Christian Andersen, Antonio Gramsci, one of Goethe’s sons, John Keats, Richard Wyatt, and the English actress Belinda Lee.\n\nToday the Cemetery can be visited every day from 9 am to 5 pm and on Sundays from 9 am to 1 pm.\n\nNasons\n\nThe nasoni, or cast-iron fountains that continuously spout drinking water, are one of the symbols of Rome. But among all the nasoni in Rome, there are about 2000. Some are more unusual and have become very rare: they are those with three spouts. There are only three left and they are located in Via della Cordonata, Via di San Teodoro and Piazza della Rotonda.\n\nTHE FOUNTAIN OF BOOKS (and other local fountains)\n\nThe Fountain of Books is located in Via degli Staderari, a stone’s throw from Piazza Navona. This street was the ancient seat of the Sapienza University, and the fountain is a tribute to culture. In the centre is a deer, as it was the historical symbol of the Rione Sant’Eustachio.\n\nThis fountain is part of a project of the municipality of Rome, which in the 1920s entrusted the architect Pietro Lombardi with the creation of several fountains representing the districts of Rome. So if you walk around Rome you can find the Fontana delle Anfore, the Fontana delle Palle di Cannone, the Fontana delle Tiare, the Fontana della Pigna, the Fontana delle Botte and the Fontana dei Monti.\n\nThe Church of Sant’Ivo alla Sapienza\n\nAlready the courtyard of the Church of Sant’Ivo alla Sapienza is worth a visit, but if you are lucky enough to find the church open usually but not always on Sundays, don’t miss the chance.\n\nThe Janiculum Lighthouse\n\nYou might be a little surprised during a walk on the Janiculum when you come across a lighthouse. Obviously, it is not a lighthouse that guides sailors, but a monument built in 1911 and donated to the city of Rome by the Italians of Argentina.\n\nRome’s round churches\n\nThere are hundreds of churches in Rome, but only a few are round. This particular conformation of the buildings gives the places of worship a very striking appearance.\n\nApart from the famous Pantheon, there are two other churches in Rome with a circular plan. The Basilica di Santo Stefano Rotondo al Celio, one of Rome’s oldest Christian places of worship, was built in the 5th century. You can admire the 34 martyrology frescoes and a 7th century Byzantine mosaic in the chapel on the interior walls. And the Mausoleum of St Constance is imposing and surprising. Its architecture is characterised by two circular spaces and the columns supporting the structure that create a particular play of light and shadow.\n\nTHE MOST BEAUTIFUL CHURCHES IN ROME\n\nChurches are not only the symbol of Christianity but also preserve masterpieces of immense beauty.\n\nThere are more than 900 churches in Rome, , including Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque and Gothic ones, and they must be included in our itinerary.\n\nIn addition to the churches you will undoubtedly visit, such as St. Peter’s and the Pantheon (yes, the Pantheon is a church), I think these are the most beautiful and exciting for their artistic heritage that they preserve but also for what they represent.\n\ncontinua\n\nHISTORICAL CENTRE\n\nBASILICA OF SANTA MARIA DEL POPOLO\n\nPiazza del Popolo 12 www.santamariadelpopolo.com\n\nCHURCH OF SANT’AGOSTINO\n\nPiazza di S.

The present construction was started by Girolamo and Carlo Rainaldi in 1652 and completed by Borromini (1653-1657), who significantly modified it. He designed the façade and dome, while Antonio del Grande and Giovanni Maria Baratta built the twin bell towers. The interior is remarkable for the splendour of the gold and marble, the mosaic floors and the splendid medieval frescoes. In the underground of the Church are the ruins of Domitian’s Circus,\n\nCHIESA DI SANT’AGNESE IN AGONE\n\nPiazza Navona www.santagneseinagone.org/\n\nCHURCH OF SANT’AGOSTINO\n\nIts construction in Renaissance style began in 1296 at the behest of Boniface VIII and was not completed until 1420. Its current appearance results from a reconstruction in 1479-1483 by Jacopo di Pietrasanta and Sebastiano Fiorentino. It houses the “Madonna dei Pellegrini” by Caravaggio. And the ‘Madonna del Parto’ by Jacopo Sansovino (1521). The third pillar on the left of the nave is decorated with a fresco by Raphael depicting the ‘Prophet Isaiah’ (1512). On the high altar, built-in 1627 to a design by Bernini, is the ‘Virgin and Child’ from the Church of St Sophia in Constantinople. Particularly noteworthy is the altarpiece “Saint Augustine, John the Evangelist and Jerome” by Guercino (1591-1666). St Monica is buried in the Church, in the chapel dedicated to her.\n\nCHIESA DI SANT’AGOSTINO\n\nPiazza di S. Agostino\n\nwww.agostiniani.it/comunita-agostiniane-provincia/basilica-s-agostino-roma/\n\nCHURCH OF SANT’ANDREA DELLA VALLE\n\nThe great Church of Sant’Andrea della Valle was begun in 1591 to a design by Gian Francesco Grimaldi and Giacomo della Porta; it was taken over by Carlo Maderno in 1608, who also designed the beautiful dome, resplendent with gold and frescoes, which give it a great appearance. The great dome is inferior in width and height only to that of St. Peter’s. The large dome is inferior in size and height only to St. Peter’s. Don’t miss the remarkable series of frescoes by Domenichino.\n\nPuccini set the beginning of Tosca there.\n\nBASILICA SANT’ANDREA DELLA VALLE\n\nCorso Vittorio Emmanuele II\n\nwww.santandrea.teatinos.org/\n\nSANTA MARIA IN ARACOELI\n\nIt is"
