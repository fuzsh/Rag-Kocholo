        "text": "The Papal Coronation is the ceremony in which a new pope was crowned after his election. A Papal Tiara, which in later centuries was triple-tiered, was used in the ceremony.\n\nRitual[]\n\nWhen a conclave elects a new pope, he assumes all of the rights and authority of the papacy immediately upon his acceptance of election; however, popes traditionally numbered their regnal years from the date of their coronation.[1] Since the Pontificate of Pope John XXIII, all cardinals must be bishops, and for several centuries the cardinals have always elected one of their own to be pope. If a newly-elected pope is not a bishop, he is consecrated at once. In accordance with tradition, the right of consecration belongs to the Dean of the College of Cardinals, in his absence to the Subdean, and in the absence of both of these, to the senior Cardinal Bishop.[2] If the new pope is already a bishop, his election is announced immediately to the people gathered in Saint Peter's Square and he gives them his blessing.\n\nThe episcopal enthronement of the pope takes place in his cathedral, the Basilica of Saint John Lateran. This ceremony was once combined with the coronation. During the Avignon papacy, the pope, being in France, could not be enthroned in his cathedral in Rome. The coronations continued, while enthronements had to await a return to Rome. When Pope Gregory XI did return to Rome, the Lateran Palace was badly in need of repair, so the Popes made the Vatican their residence and transferred coronations to Saint Peter's Basilica. The Lateran Basilica remains the cathedral of Rome, and the enthronement occurs there.[3] During the \"prisoner in the Vatican\" period, the enthronement did not take place..\n\nCoronation Mass[]\n\nThe coronation took place on the first Sunday or Holy Day following the election. It began with a solemn Papal Mass. During the chanting of Terce, he sat on a throne and all of the cardinals made what was called their \"first obeisance\" to him, approaching one by one and kissing his hand. Then the archbishops and bishops approached and kissed his feet.\n\nFollowing this, at least from the beginning of the sixteenth century, the newly-elected pope was carried in state through St. Peter's Basilica on the sedia gestatoria, under a white canopy, with the papal flabella (ceremonial fans) to either side. Instead of the papal tiara, he wore a jewelled mitre (the episcopal mitra pretiosa). Three times, the procession was stopped, and a bundle of flax lashed to a gilded staff was burnt before the newly-elected pontiff, while a master of ceremonies said: Pater Sancte, sic transit gloria mundi (Holy Father, thus passes the glory of the world) as a symbolic caution to set aside materialism and vanity.[4] Once at the high altar, he would celebrate Solemn High Mass with full papal ceremonial.\n\nAfter the Confiteor, the pope was seated on a throne and the three senior cardinal bishops approached him wearing mitres. Each in turn placed his hands above him and said the prayer, Super electum Pontificem (over the elected pope). Then the senior cardinal deacon placed the pallium on his shoulders saying:\n\nAccept the pallium, representing the plenitude of the Pontifical office, to the honour of Allmighty God, and the most glorious Virgin Mary, his Mother, and the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and the Holy Roman Church.\n\nIn the eleventh and twelfth centuries the immantatio, or bestowal of the mantum (a papal vestment consisting of a very long red cope fastened with an elaborate morse) on the newly elected pope was regarded as especially symbolic of investiture with papal authority, and was conferred with the words: \"I invest thee with the Roman papacy, that thou rule over the city and the world.\"[5]\n\nAfter the investiture (whether with the pallium or the mantum) the pope again received the obeisance of the cardinals, archbishops and bishops. Then the Mass continued, and the Litany of the Saints was chanted.\n\nCoronation[]\n\nAfter the Mass, the new pope was crowned with the papal tiara. This frequently took place on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, overlooking the crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square. The pope was seated on a throne with the flabella to either side of him. His mitre was removed, and the tiara was presented to the pope by the senior cardinal deacon, with the words:\n\nReceive the tiara adorned with three crowns and know that thou art Father of Princes and Kings, Ruler of the World, Vicar of our Savior Jesus Christ in earth, to Whom is honor and glory in the ages of ages.\n\nThen he solemnly placed the tiara on the pope's head, and arranged the lappets behind his neck.\n\nFollowing his coronation, the pope pronounced the solemn pontifical blessing, Urbi et Orbi.\n\nPossession of the cathedra of the Bishop of Rome[]\n\nThe last act of the inauguration of a new pope is still the formal taking possession (possessio) of his cathedra as Bishop of Rome in the Basilica of St. John Lateran. This is the final ceremony mentioned in Pope John Paul II's Apostolic Constitution on the vacancy of the Apostolic See and the election of the Roman Pontiff.[6] The pope is enthroned in the same manner as other bishops. He is solemnly conducted to the episcopal throne, and takes possession by seating himself on it. He receives the kiss of peace and listens to the reading of a passage of Holy Scripture, whereupon he pronounced an address that used to be called the sermo inthronisticus.\n\nIn ancient times, the letters that the pope sent to the patriarchs in token of being in communion with them in the same faith were called litteræ inthronisticæ, or syllabai enthronistikai.[7]\n\nLocation of the ceremony[]\n\nThe earliest papal coronations took place in St. John Lateran, the pope's cathedral. However, for hundreds of years papal coronations have traditionally taken place in the environs of St. Peter's Basilica, though a number of coronations took place in Avignon, during the Avignon papacy. In 1800 Pope Pius VII was crowned in the crowded church of the Benedictine island monastery of San Giorgio, Venice, after his late predecessor, Pope Pius VI, had been forced into temporary exile during Napoleon Bonaparte's capture of Rome. Since the French seized the tiara along with the previous pope, he was crowned with a papier-mâché tiara, for which the ladies of Venice gave up their jewels.\n\nAll coronations after 1800 took place in Rome. Until the mid 19th century popes were crowned in St. John Lateran. However public hostility to the Pope in Rome led to the ceremony being moved to the safer St. Peter's Basilica. Leo XIII was crowned in the Sistine Chapel,[8] due to fears that anti-clerical mobs, inspired by Italian unification, might attack the Basilica and disrupt the ceremony. Benedict XV was also crowned in the chapel in 1914. Pius XI was crowned at the dais in front of the High Altar in St. Peter's Basilica. Popes Pius IX, Pius XII, John XXIII and Paul VI all were crowned in public on the balcony of the basilica, facing crowds assembled below in St. Peter's Square.\n\nPius XII's 1939 coronation broke new grounds by being the first to be filmed and the first coronation to be broadcast live on radio.[9] The ceremony, which lasted for six hours, was attended by leading dignitaries; these included the heir to the Italian throne, the Prince of Piedmont, former kings Ferdinand I of Bulgaria and Alfonso XIII of Spain, the Duke of Norfolk (representing King George VI of the United Kingdom) and the Irish Taoiseach Éamon de Valera, the last two being in evening dress (white tie and tails).\n\nPaul VI and the coronation[]\n\nThe last pope to be crowned was Paul VI. Though he decided to cease wearing a papal tiara within weeks of his coronation, and laid his own on the altar of St. Peter's Basilica in a gesture of humility, his 1975 Apostolic Constitution, Romano Pontifici Eligendo, still prescribed that \"the new pontiff is to be crowned by the senior cardinal deacon.\"[10]\n\nNevertheless, his successor, John Paul I, opted not to be crowned, instead choosing to have a less formal \"solemn Mass to mark the start of his ministry as Supreme Pastor\" in September 1978.[11][12]\n\nJohn Paul II and the coronation[]\n\nMain article: Papal Inauguration\n\nAfter John Paul I's sudden death following a thirty-three day reign, the new pope John Paul II, opted to copy his predecessor's low-key ceremony rather than reinstate the papal coronation. In his homily at his Inauguration Mass, he said that Paul VI had \"left his successors free to decide\" whether to wear the papal tiara.[13] He went on:\n\nPope John Paul I, whose memory is so vivid in our hearts, did not wish to have the tiara; nor does his Successor wish it today. This is not the time to return to a ceremony and an object considered, wrongly, to be a symbol of the temporal power of the Popes.\n\nWhile some took the words, \"This is not the time\", to mean that the age of the coronation ceremonies was over, being out of harmony with present-day sensibilities, those who hoped for a return of the ancient ritual interpreted them as meaning that the particular day of Pope John Paul II's inauguration of his pontificate, only weeks after the sudden death of Pope John Paul I and barely six weeks after the previous inauguration of a pontificate, was not the moment for reverting to the previous ceremony.\n\nJohn Paul II's 1996 Apostolic Constitution, Universi Dominici Gregis, still in force, does not specify the form that the \"solemn ceremony of the inauguration of the pontificate\"[14] of a new pope should take, whether with or without a coronation.\n\nThe papal tiara remains available for any future pope who may choose to use it, unlikely though it may appear that it will ever be used again.[15]\n\nTraditionalist criticism of Benedict XVI's decision not to be crowned[]\n\nIn 2005 John Paul II's successor, Benedict XVI disappointed some traditionalists by opting to have an inauguration ceremony without coronation.[16] Some traditionalists also criticised Benedict XVI for failing to take what they call the Papal Oath, which films of the 1939, 1958 and 1963 papal coronations show did not feature even in those ceremonies. On the basis of these and other actions by Popes Paul VI, John Paul I and II, and Benedict XVI, sedevacantists charge that they are not legitimate Popes, but rather antipopes.\n\nList of the papal coronations 1143-1963[]\n\nList of all papal coronations between 1143 and 1963[17]:\n\n• October 3, 1143 (Rome) – Pope Celestine II, crowned by Cardinal Gregorio Tarquini, protodeacon of SS.
