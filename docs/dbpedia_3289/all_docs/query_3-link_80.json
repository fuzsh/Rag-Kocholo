        "text": "The Prophesy of Popes is an oracle attributed to the Irish Bishop St. Malachy in 1138, which claims to be a list of Latin mottos associated with every future pope, spanning from Pope Celestine II (r.1143-1144) until the End of the World. It was supposedly discovered by Alphonsus Ciacconius in 1590, and afterwards published in 1595 by Arnold Wyon. If the prophesy is interpreted literally, then the current Pope Francis would correspond to the very last motto on the list, i.e. the Petrus Romanus (or \"Peter the Roman\"), and afterwards the Church of Rome will be destroyed.\n\nFor centuries, the Prophesy of Popes captured the imagination of many mystics and paranormal enthusiasts, and became intertwined with many other end-time prophesies spawned from esoteric traditions of early modern Europe. However, over time it has become heavily criticized by many scholars, in particular because of how the Latin mottos after 1590 almost never accurately describe the Popes they are supposedly associated with, except for a few cases chalked up to coincidence. The most notable of these critiques comes from the Irish Priest Michael John O'Brien, in his essay An Historical and Critical Account of the So-called Prophecy of St. Malachy Regarding the Succession of Popes (Dublin: Gill & Son, 1880), which I use as the primary source of this essay.\n\nCurrently, the most common theory is that the Prophesy is pseudepigrapha, and was forged in 1590 by some unknown persons (most likely Arnold Wyon), in an attempt to sway the Conclave that ultimately elected Pope Gregory XIV.\n\nOnce the pontificate of Pope Francis comes to an end, the Prophesy will have exhausted its usefulness of any future predictions, and will likely fade into obscurity. However, in this essay I will argue that the Prophesy does still have a useful purpose. Not as a cryptic prediction of future OTL history, but rather as a direct instruction for creating an alternate history.\n\nI argue that the Prophesy of Popes is best understood as a Paleo-Future. A Paleo-Future is a kind of science fiction that takes place at a specific date in the author's future, but in the progress of time has now become our past. As the events of OTL deviated from what was predicted, then the Paleo-Future transitions from a possible future into an alternate history (using a point of divergence where the future prediction first proved to be inaccurate). In the case of the Prophesy of Popes, the PoD is where Gregory XIV is not elected Pope in 1590, and the subsequent history of the Catholic Church perfectly aligns with the predictions in the Prophesy.\n\nAs this timeline may have a different number of Popes than in OTL, then the Petrus Romanus (and subsequent destruction of Rome) may take place sometime prior the present day, or may be pushed into the future. There may be many other geopolitical implications from this timeline, beyond the sheer list of Roman bishops, and may be extended to include other failed prophesies of early modern Europe.\n\nI decided to compile these suggestions into an essay, rather than writing a timeline, because I do not have the resources capable of doing any proper justice to the idea. Instead, I will detail everything I know should go into such a timeline, and hopefully some future reader may have the ability to make it happen.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not an authority on Latin, so any comment I make on the Latin mottos are lifted from outside sources, which I have made every effort to transclude as faithfully and literally as possible.\n\nIntroduction[]\n\nLegendary Origin[]\n\nSt. Malachy (1094-1148) was a native of Armagh, now located within Northern Ireland. Unlike many medieval saints, the events of Malachy's life are very reliably recorded for us, as his biography was documented by the contemporary saint, Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153). He was ordained as priest by the incumbent archbishop in 1119, and undertook the task of making many systematic reforms for the Churches in Ireland, which were badly needed at the time. After the Abbot of Bangor died in 1123, Malachy assumed de-facto responsibility over the Abbey, although he was never officially admitted to a Holy Order. In 1132, he was elevated to be Archbishop of Armagh, a position that he would resign from just a few years later, in 1137.\n\nMalachy visited Rome twice in his life: first to Pope Innocent II in 1138, then to Pope Eugene III in 1147. It was during the latter visit that Malachy's life came to an end, as he fell ill in France on his way back to Ireland. It was during the first visit, however, that Malachy supposedly gave his prophesy to the Pontiff, at least according to the traditional account (as described by Abbe Cucherat, the most famous supporter of the Prophesy, in his 1871 essay[1]).\n\nIn the 1130s, the Papacy was suffering from a number of issues. While the worst phases of the Investiture Controversy had passed, the political rivalry between the Pope and Emperor was still a constant struggle, which continued throughout the reigns of Henry V and Lothair III. The Papal election of 1130 proved controversial, as most of the Roman nobility disapproved of Innocent II and instead threw their support behind Cardinal Pietro Pierleoni, who was elected Antipope Anacletus II (r.1130-1138). On top of all this, the mercantile classes of Rome were pushing for their own temporal power over the Papal States, which culminated into a popular revolt known as the Commune of Rome. As a result of all these issues, Innocent II spend a large part of his papacy exiled in France, until he gained enough political support to recapture Rome.\n\nWith all these troubles happening, so the legend goes, Innocent II was worried if the papal office itself would soon cease to exist. So in order to alleviate his anxiety, St. Malachy shared the vision he had of these 112 Latin mottos, indicating that the Papacy will still last for over a hundred future generations. This was recorded in the Vatican archives, but apparently forgotten about for many centuries. This conversation was not mentioned at all by St. Bernard, or any other source prior to the 1590s.\n\nFirst Publication[]\n\nArnold Wyon (1554-c.1610) was a native of Flanders under the Spanish Empire, but specifically a region that is now part of France. He was a monk of the Benedictine Order, and during the Dutch Revolt he relocated to the Abby of San Benedetto in Mantua. In 1595, Wyon published a complete history of the Benedictines called Lignum Vitae, and it is in this book that the Prophesy of Popes first appeared in print. Wyon claimed that the Prophesy was first discovered by the Dominican historian Alphonsus Ciacconius (1530-1599), who also provided explanations of how each Latin motto was fulfilled (up until 1590). Ciacconius was a respected authority on Papal heraldry, whose seminal work Vitae et Gestae Pontificum Romanorum was published posthumously in 1601.\n\nIt is important to mention how Wyon's Lignum Vitae was known to stretch the truth at times. For example, he argued that St. Benedict and the Habsburgs were both descended from the Ancient Roman noble family known as the Ancians. He also included St. Malachy himself as a Benedictine, even though he was never officially recognized as one[2].\n\nBelow is the full list of Latin mottos given by the prophesy, aligned with their

Roman\n\nIn addition to the list of Latin mottos, the Prophesy also concludes with the following text:\n\nIn the final persecution of the Holy Roman Church, there will sit Peter the Roman (Petrus Romanus), who will pasture his sheep in many tribulations, and when these things are finished, the City of Seven Hills will be destroyed, and the dreadful judge will judge his people. The End.\n\nForgery Exposed[]\n\nAt first, the Prophesy caught the attention of the community of Christian theologians who specialize in mystical experiences and Endtime prophesies. For example, the Commentary on Daniel by Cornelius a Lapide (1567-1637) speculated on where the last Popes of the Prophesy fit in with the events of the Apocalypse, and noted the implication that the City of Rome will be destroyed before the Last Judgement[5]. It wasn't long, however, before the Prophesy fell subject to criticism. The French Priest Louis Moreri (1643-1680) was the first to give a critical examination, which he published in his 1673 encyclopedia titled Le Grand Dictionnaire historique[6]. The French historian Claude-François Menestrier (1631-1705) was in the process of making a more detailed analysis at this same time, and in 1689 he published an essay titled Refutation of the Supposed Prophesy of St. Malachy. It is from these two sources that the official historical opinion on the Prophesy is derived, and all subsequent historians have deferred back to them[7].\n\nAccording to Moreri and Menestrier, the Prophesy of Popes was actually forged by supporters of Cardinal Girolamo Simoncelli (1522-1605), in order to bolster his push for the Papacy during the Conclave of 1590. This is because the next entry of the Prophesy after Pope Urban VII says \"Of the Antiquity of the City\" (Ex antiquitate urbis). Simoncelli was born in Orvieto, which is colloquially called \"Urbs Vetus\" (or literally \"Old City\"), and thus would be a very straightforward interpretation of the motto.\n\nSimoncelli ultimately lost the election in favor of Pope Gregory XIV, but enthusiasm for the Prophesy remained, as people speculated on other ways that Pope Gregory's provenance could be interpreted as an \"old city\". He was actually born in Milan, which is indeed an Ancient city (at least as old as the Roman Republic). His father was also Senator for the Duke of Milan, which comes from the Latin word senex meaning \"elderly\"[8]. And so it goes with these kind of horoscopes, that people will mangle the interpretation in convoluted ways in order to make the prophesy appear to be accurate.\n\nFor Italians, especially citizens of Rome, the election of a new Pope is an exciting time filled with fervent energy, and it isn't at all unusual for people to pass around forged prophesies or visions in order to capitalize on that energy[9]. That explains why the Prophesy is never given any credence or even acknowledgement from any official source from the Catholic Church, including any Cardinal or Pope: It's just one more hoax among many that they have come across in their careers. There is no evidence that it has ever swayed the decision of any Papal election, or any other crucial decisions of the Papacy.\n\nCritique of the Prophesy[]\n\nThe most glaring criticism of the Prophesy is how completely divorced the mottos after 1590 are from the Popes they are supposed to be describing. For example, Pope Pius IX is given the motto \"Cross from Cross\" (Crux de cruce), whose coat of arms has no crosses on it. Pope Benedict XIV is given the motto \"Country Animal\" (Animal rurale), whose coat of arms has no animal on it. Supporters of the Prophesy end up resorting to more metaphorical or mystical interpretations, or an obscure event that happens sometime during the Pope's tenure. However, doing so is inconsistent with the 74 Latin mottos prior to 1590, whose interpretations were fairly straightforward and literal. As O'Brien put it: \"How does it happen that there were no mystic explanations before 1590, while, on the contrary, from that year down to the present, in order to explain the [other] prophecies we must give words vague and mystic meanings?\"[10] And in another place, \"The prophet, up to 1590, did not deal in generalities.\"[11] This point becomes more crucial in the next section.\n\nThere is also reason to believe that the Prophesy had nothing to do with St. Malachy in the first place. Many of the mottos heavily rely on puns or wordplay in the Italian language, which is a language Malachy wouldn't be familiar with[12]. There are also certain words or phrases that are anachronistic, and wouldn't have existed in Malachy's time period. For example, Pope Sixtus IV is given the motto \"Minorite Fisherman\" (Piscator Minorita). While Pope Sixtus was a Minorite, the order didn't exist in 1138[13].\n\nSome mottos also rely on very niche pieces of information that could not possibly be deduced forward from the Prophesy, but can only be worked backwards from the interpretation. For example, Pope Benedict XI is given the motto \"Preacher From Patara\" (Concionator Patereus), because his birth name \"Nicholas\" is named after St. Nicholas of Patara. Pope Urban VII is given the motto \"From the Dew of Heaven\" (De rore coeli), because he was previously Archbishop of Calabria, where apparently a certain plant called \"Dew of Heaven\" happens to grow. As O'Brien puts it, \"Everything leads us to suspect that the author and interpreter of the prophecy is one and the same person.\"[14]\n\nThe Prophesy and its interpretation also contain some historical inaccuracies, where some Popes are attributed with personal details that are either dubious or incorrect. For example, Pope Clement IV is given the motto \"Dragon Pressed Down\" (Draco depressus), and the interpretation says \"Whose herald is an eagle holding a dragon in his talons\". However, Clement's actual coat of arms is a banner of six fleurs-de-lis[15]. The Prophesy also references several Antipopes, two of which are designated as illegitimate (\"Schismatic Crow\" for Antipope Nicholas V and \"Schism of the Barcelonas\" for Antipope Clement VIII). However, the other Antipopes are not designated this way, making them appear to be treated as legitimate pontiffs. This casts doubt on Wyon's claim that the Prophesy was interpreted by Ciacconius, as such an expert on Papal heralds would never make these kind of mistakes[16]. This is compounded by the fact that Ciacconius never makes any reference to the Prophesy in his own historical work, which was published shortly after the Lignum Vitae.\n\nWhen O'Brien made his analysis of the Prophesy in the 1880s, he discovered that it follows very closely with a 1557 document titled Epitome Romanorum Pontificum, written by the Augustinian historian Onofrio Panvinio (1529-1568). Now Panvinio is not a bad historian, and is praised by his contemporaries for his insatiable apatite for studying. Joseph Scaliger (1484-1558), for example, called him \"the father of all history\"[17]. Nonetheless he did make his own share of errors, and Ciacconius in particular heavily criticized the mistakes he made on Papal heraldry[18]. O'Brien pointed out that wherever the Prophesy of St. Malachy makes a historical error (and one that contradicts Ciacconius' own works), it is in agreement with Panvinio. This includes not only the errors in Papal heraldry and other personal details, but also the legitimacy of Antipopes as well. O'Brien concluded that whoever forged the Prophesy must have been intimately familiar with Panvinio's work[19].\n\nPost-O'Brien analysis[]\n\nHaving covered all the above information, I would like to take a moment to point out some interesting coincidences that arose from the Latin mottos that take place after O'Brien's essay was published in the 1880s. O'Brien gives some speculation on what the intended meaning of the Prophesy should be, but he would have no way of knowing how history would play out in the last 140 years. This alone isn't to say that the prophesy should be given much credence, but it is nonetheless interesting to note:\n\n\"Religion Destroyed\" (Religio depopulata) aligns with Pope Benedict XV (r.1914-1922). O'Brien notes, \"Troubled times are foretold by this. The blood of the martyrs shall flow\"[20]. What a coincidence that this Papacy aligned with the First World War and Bolshevik Revolution, which saw such a flow of martyrs' blood that is unprecedented in all of recorded history. It is also worth noting that St. Malachy's Prophesy is not the only eschatological source that predicted World War One, as the Jehovah's Witnesses also claimed Armageddon would happen in the year 1914. Even Otto von Bismarck, although not exactly a prophet, is believed to have stated the Great War would happen within twenty years after his death, in 1898.\n\n\"Angelic Shepherd\" (Pastor angelicus) aligns with Pope Pius XII (r.1939-1958). Following the commentary of Cornelius a Lapide, O'Brien stated that this future Pope would hold a special place in the Apocalypse, being contemporary with the Antichrist and the wars of the Last Roman Emperor[21]. How fascinating it is, then, that this Pope was contemporary with the rise of Nazi Germany and the Second World War. While it is true that every pontificate has its share of devastating wars and despotic tyrants, few individuals in recorded history could ever compare with the depravity indelible memory of Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"Shepherd and sailor\" (Pastor et nautica) aligns with Pope John XXIII (r.1958-1963). His previous office was the Patriarch of Venice, which would be a fairly straightforward interpretation of this motto. The Prophesy previously established the term \"sailor\" is meant to refer to Venice, as was the case with Pope Gregory XII (\"Sailor from a black bridge\").\n\n\"Of the Half-moon\" (De medietate lunae) aligns with Pope John Paul I (r.1978). His brief pontificate happens to be half of a lunar cycle.\n\nWhile these coincidences are interesting to speculate on, in a later section I will explain that this is probably not how the Prophesy is meant to be interpreted, anyway.\n\nProphesy of the Popes is a Paleo-Future[]\n\nForged Prophesies[]\n\nGenerally speaking, the word prophesy refers to a message that is received from a divine source, and in Abrahamic religions this specifically refers to the monotheistic God. Since ancient times, it is customary that any prophesy must be accompanied by a miraculous event, which signifies the message comes from a supernatural origin. Moses gave this criteria for prophesies in the Jewish law (Deuteronomy 18:18-22), and the same formula has been followed by every claimed revelation of every Abrahamic religion down to the present day. Even with the presence of a miracle, this doesn't preclude the possibility of a false prophesy coming from some other spiritual entity, such as the Devil. Both the Old and New Testaments condemn the use of spiritual insight by sorcery or divinations (Deuteronomy 18:10; 1 John 4:1). In Ancient Israel, the office of Prophet worked in parallel with the High Priest, who interceded to God on behalf of the people.\n\nThe ability to predict the future is merely one kind of miraculous event, indictive of God's power to transcend our limitations of time and space. But since this particular kind of miracle was so commonly used by the ancient prophets, then word prophesy has now evolved into a secondary meaning, referring to any kind of future prediction.\n\nThe Catholic Church, like many other Abrahamic faiths, does not discount the possibility of prophetic messages continuing beyond the generation of the Apostles. But any claims of Special Revelations outside of canonical scriptures must come with a hefty amount of skepticism, as O'Brien explains \"The Church has produced a countless number of saints, who were more or less imbued with the prophetic spirit; but on any work which, has been attributed to any saint as prophetic, the Church has given no decision.\"[22]\n\nBecause of these factors, the theologians investigating a supposed prophesy carry a universal assumption that if a prophesy is valid, then it must come true. There is no room for possible futures or alternate history; it either happens or it doesn't. And once events are set in motion subsequent to the utterance of prophesy, then it's fulfillment has already been predestined. Therefore, the supporters of certain oracles have the task of trying to identify some alternate interpretation, no matter how convoluted, in order to ensure that their predictions align with historical reality.\n\nIn the case of St. Malachy's prophesy, these interpretations have to resort to rather obtuse or metaphorical explanations, whenever the straightforward and literal approach is insufficient. In many cases, the supporters of the Prophesy claim that each Latin motto describes some events that happen during the Pope's tenure, even though this is not the case for any of the 74 mottos that preceded 1590. The most egregious example is Pope Pius VIII, who aligns with the motto \"Religious man\" (Vir religiosus). The most common explanation is that it refers to his papal name \"Pius\". Not only does \"Pius\" actually mean \"mercy\" and has nothing to do with the English word \"Pious\", but also this would be the only motto of the entire Prophesy that references the Papal name, rather than the Pope's birth name. And how useless the Prophesy would be if that was the intention! For literally anyone could be elected Pope and then select the papal name that makes the Prophesy come true.\n\nKnowing that a prophesy is held accountable by its ability to come true, then the authors of a forged prophesy will make every effort to keep their predictions as vague and imprecise as possible. This is a common practice familiar to con artists down through the centuries, particularly among astrologers and fortune-tellers. They will make ambiguous statements about \"a struggle\" or \"a success\" or \"a relative\", and allow the client's imagination to latch on to however those phrases give meaning to their specific lives. In a similar way, a forged oracle may make vague descriptions of \"a war\", or \"a persecution\", or \"a king\", knowing that the probability is very high that these concepts will manifest in some way, at some point in the future, if not on a frequent basis. The author may also rely on bizarre and ambiguous metaphors, which have a wide margin of alternate interpretations that could be used. In a more subtle way, the author of a forged prophesy may make detailed descriptions of events that actually took place in the recent past, but described in such a way that their audience could imagine such an event may happen again in the future. For example, the Book of 2 Esdras uses the recent destruction of the Second Temple as a way to describe a future global apocalypse.\n\nPaleo-Futures[]\n\nA Paleo-future is a kind of science fiction that takes place in the future relative to its original author, but takes place in the past relative to the current audience. For example, the story Paris in the 20th Century by Jules Verne takes place in the 1970s, which is several decades in our past. But as Jules Verne was writing in the 1870s, then from his perspective the story actually takes place in the future. As soon as the date of a science fiction story becomes the past, then it transitions from a speculative, possible future into an alternate history, where the point of divergence corresponds to the first ahistorical prediction made by that author.\n\nUnlike a forged prophesy, a paleo-future requires a very specific setting in time and space. If a work of science fiction took place in an ambiguous futuristic time period, then it would be impossible for that setting to ever become the past with any certainty, and therefore it could never become a paleo-future. And generally speaking, any work of science fiction is understood to be one possible vision of the future from that author's perspective, and is not meant to deceive people like a forged prophesy is.\n\nArgument[]\n\nHaving explained the key differences between a prophesy and a paleo-future, it is my argument that the Prophesy of Popes incidentally lends itself to being understood as a kind of paleo-future, despite the fact it was originally created as a forged prophesy. The concept of science fiction barely existed at all in the 1590s, and the oldest recognized Paleo-Future wouldn't be written until the 1730s (Memoirs of the Twentieth Century by Samuel Madden). Therefore, my personal assessment is that Arnold Wyon (or whoever wrote the Prophesy) accidentally stumbled across a genre of fiction that was, poetically enough, way ahead of their time.\n\nFirst, the Prophesy makes specific claims about each Pope which can be easily verified. Had we only been given the 38 mottos after 1590, then their exact interpretation may have been left up to speculation. But the 74 mottos prior to 1590 exudes the pattern of an exact formula, which can then be applied to the second half of the Prophesy. As O'Brien explains, \"in the language used up to 1590, Bonus does not mean 'good,' it simply means one of the Ottobono family; crux does not mean the Christian emblem of redemption or suffering, it simply means an heraldic charge on the pope's shield [...] and so on\". The chronology of the Prophesy also points to specific time periods, and not a vague future era as typically found in an Apocalypse. Almost every interpretation of the Prophesy agrees that each motto corresponds to each and every pope in sequence, without any gaps or re-arrangement. The one possible exception is the Petrus Romanus, who is supposed to appear at the end of the world, and therefore enthusiasts of the prophesy are reluctant to identify him as Pope Francis.\n\nIn his refutation of the Prophesy, Ménestrier performed an experiment where he re-arranged the order of the mottos, and discovered that the new arrangement could align with the historical Popes more properly than the original order. He did this to demonstrate the \"absurdity\" of the oracle[23], but it also illustrates a very interesting point: the Prophesy of St. Malachy may not describe the Popes elected in our timeline, but it does do well to describe a possible list of Popes that might have been elected in a different timeline.\n\nIn many cases, it is evident that the author of the Prophesy had a specific family or nationality in mind. For example, the motto \"Swift Bear\" (Ursus velox) refers to the ancient noble family of Orsini, whose name originated from the Latin word ursa (bear). An even more striking example is the motto \"Star of the swans\" (Sydus olorum), as O'Brien explains: \"I have seen in the Teatro Araldico--a work which gives the arms of the most illustrious Italian families—a shield on which was emblazoned a swan with stars overhead. Could the forger have had something like this in his mind?\"[24] So clearly the symbols being used in the Prophesy are not at random, but rather call out specific individuals who the author anticipated might have been elected Pope at specific points in the future.\n\nOther considerations[]\n\nWhy would the forger of the Prophesy make these kind of specific claims, akin to a genre of science fiction far ahead of his time? Surely, it would only take two or three papal elections before it becomes clear that the oracle holds no water, which is why the vast majority of forged prophesies root themselves in more vague or imprecise language. But one has to keep in mind that the original intentions of the author are unknown. Because Arnold Wyon lied about receiving the Prophesy from Ciacconius, then it is not known where he obtained it from. Perhaps the original author never expected his words to be published, or held up to the scrutiny of future generations. Perhaps he assumed that, once Simoncelli was successfully elected, then he would quietly dispose of the Prophesy and let it fade into obscurity. Perhaps, in 1595, he casually intimated his little project with Arnold Wyon, under the belief that (now that two more Popes had been elected) no sane person would take his work seriously. But, as O'Brien eloquently put it, \"This would have shaken the faith of another, perhaps, but not of the simple-minded Fleming.\"[25]\n\nOne counterpoint to this argument is that some of the mottos after 1590 do use more vague or evocative language than the earlier mottos, for example \"Glorious penitence\" or \"Religion destroyed\". I do concede that the forger may have been tempted to include a few random phrases to pad out the end of the list. However, I argue that some mottos that appear to be evocative at first glance actually do follow the same formula as the mottos before 1590. Take Pope Lucius II for example, who is attributed the motto \"Enemy expelled\" (Inimicus expulsus). Now, if you lived in 1145 and the Prophesy of Popes actually existed in St. Malachy's time, then at first glance you may have concluded that the promises of this motto failed to come true. This Pope's reign was \"a short but troubled one.\"[26] It was during this time that the city of Rome was overrun by a revolutionary government called the Commune of Rome, which continued to dominate the Papal States long after Lucius' death. While the Investiture Controversy had long since passed, the broader political conflict of the Guelphs and Gibilines had only just begun, in which the mighty Hohenstaufen dynasty were quickly rising to power. Evidently, \"the enemies\" were quite decidedly not expelled during this pontificate.\n\nBut of course, the forger of the Prophesy intended this motto to actually be a pun off of Pope Lucius' birth name, because his surname \"Caccianemici\" derives from the Italian words cacciare (expelled) and \"nemici\" (enemies). It is entirely conceivable that the author intended for the mottos after 1590 to be interpreted in a similar way. Thus, no religion is actually destroyed during the pontificate of \"Religion destroyed\", but instead it refers to the Pope's birthname in some inconspicuous way. This is why it is very crucial to understand the mottos as a reference to the Pope's identity, not the events of their tenure.\n\nHaving explained why the Prophesy of Popes should be understood as a Paleo-Future, the rest of this article will break down a methodology by which someone could write an alternate timeline using the Prophesy as a guide. Then, there is some discussion on what other geo-political implications there could be as a result of the Butterfly Effect.\n\nInterpreting the Prophesy[]\n\nPrinciple Mechanics[]\n\nTake a moment to completely clear your mind of any Pope who reigned after 1590. None of those papal elections have any bearing on the Conclaves that take place in this timeline. Some OTL popes may end up being elected anyway, perhaps under a different motto than they had historically, but this is merely incidental. Instead, this section will operate solely off of the information that would have been available to someone trying to interpret the Prophesy in the year 1590, where the identities of any future Pope are completely unknown. Rather than starting with historical popes and engineering an interpretation of the prophesy to fit that, I will instead start with a straightforward interpretation of the Prophesy, and rewrite the history of the Catholic Church to match it.\n\nIt is fortunate that there are twice as many Popes covered by the Prophesy before 1590 than afterwards, 74 verses 38 names in total. This gives an overabundance of data to work with, making it that much easier to construct a formula for interpreting each and every motto.\n\nFirst, it seems that the Prophesy was intended to be used in order to anticipate who was going to win each papal election, prior to the election actually taking place. That is to say, each motto provides information only on the pope's personal identity, and not on any events during their pontificate, nor any circumstances surrounding the Conclave. There are only a couple of possible exceptions to this rule. A couple of entries are specifically called out as being antipopes (\"Schismatic Crow\" and \"Schism of the Barcelonas\"). For the purposes of this timeline, however, this should not be of any concern. There have not been any recognized antipopes since 1590 (or really any since the death of Antipope Felix V in 1449), and there is no reason to assume that the Butterfly Effects of this timeline will make it any more likely. The lack of antipopes in the last five hundred years can be attributed to three basic causes: 1) the death of conciliarism in the 15th century (which would enable councils to elect a rival Pope), 2) the Counter-Reformation in the 16th century (solidifying the Catholic faith as more of a religious movement than a political office), and 3) the secularization of Europe in the 17th century (removing any political ambitions of becoming Pope). As long as these factors are still true, then the likelihood of antipopes appear in this timeline is fairly low.\n\nThere is really only one entry in the Prophesy which can be considered a description of the pontificate, rather than the pope's personal identity: Pope Marcellus II, who is given the motto \"Useless grain\" (Frumentum flocidum). The \"grain\" part refers to images on his herald, while the \"useless\" part refers to the brevity of his tenure: a total of 21 days. This goes to show that the rule can be broken, but only rarely.\n\nAlmost every motto of the Prophesy can be broken down into two phrases, where each phrase alludes to (at most) one piece of information. This piece of information can come in one of the following forms:\n\nCoat of arms\n\nBirth name\n\nBirth place\n\nPreviously-held office or occupation\n\nFather's occupation\n\nWith 74 mottos and two phrases each, the prophesy up to 1590 has a total of 147 phrases (Pope Clement III's motto, \"He will come from school\", has only one phrase instead of two). Categorizing these phrases thematically/grammatically gives the following statistics:\n\nSpecific locations: 22; 15% (\"Aquitaine\", \"Jerusalem\", \"Patara\", etc.)\n\nAnimals: 19; 13% (\"Goose\", \"Lion\", \"She-wolf\", etc.)\n\nAdjectives/descriptors: 18; 12% (\"Good\", \"White\", \"Cold\", etc.)\n\nGeneric places: 15; 10% (\"Castle\", \"Prison\", \"Mountain\", etc.)\n\nOccupations: 12; 8% (\"Doctor\", \"Sailor\", \"Cobbler\", etc.)\n\nGeometric shapes: 10; 7% (\"Column\", \"Cross\", \"Square\", etc.)\n\nSmall objects: 9; 6% (\"Crown\", \"Door\", \"Food\", etc.)\n\nPlants: 9; 6% (\"Grain\", \"Rose\", \"Dew\", etc.)\n\nSpecific offices: 8; 5% (\"Abbot\", \"Canon\", \"Viscount\", etc.)\n\nAbstract concepts: 8; 5% (\"Blessing\", \"Faith\", \"Lover\", etc.)\n\nProper names: 7; 5% (\"Peter\", \"Lawrence\", \"Jupiter\", etc.)\n\nBody parts: 4; 3% (\"Bony\", \"Half-body\", \"Side\", and \"Pregnant\")\n\nMythological creatures: 3; 2% (\"Dragon\", \"Angel\", and \"Siren\")\n\nAstral bodies: 3; 2% (\"Sun\", \"Moon\", and \"Star\")\n\nBolded entries refer to phrases that are visually distinct, and therefore lend themselves to being heraldic symbols. In total, these heraldic-esque phrases make up 36% of all phrases in the Prophesy.\n\nBecause the Pre-1590 mottos have an official interpretation, then we can construct a correlation between these phrases and their interpretations. After correlating all 147 phrases with their official interpretations, then the information taken from these phrases fall into these categories:\n\nCoat of arms: 45 (30%)\n\nOffice or occupation: 44 (30%)\n\nName: 23 (16%)\n\nBirth place: 21 (14%)\n\nFather's occupation: 4 (3%)\n\nNone/other: 11 (7%)\n\nThis preliminary analysis illustrates a very important point: the Prophesy has a strong preference for using the personal coat of arms of each Pope, over any other personal information. This makes intuitive sense: remember that the principle source of the Prophesy was Epitome Romanorum Pontificum by Onofrio Panvinio, which is a book primarily about Papal heraldry. Usually, the only time the Pope's coat of arms is not used is when it's not recorded in history, or they come from an impoverished background with no personal herald.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, references to the Pope's father seem to be more of an anomaly than an actual rule, as it is only used in four mottos: \"From a bony cobbler\", \"From the meanness of Luna\", \"Minorite fisherman\", and \"From a political gridiron\". This could very well be lumped into the \"none/other\" category, and it would not affect any subsequent analysis.\n\nWhenever the Prophesy refers to a specific location, it almost always refers to either their birthplace or office. There are only two exceptions to this rule: \"Florentine lion\" and \"Preacher from Patara\". Both cases actually refers to the Pope's personal name, but in a very unorthodox way. Pope Adrian VI, the only Dutch Pope in history, had nothing to do with the City of Florence, but he had a middle name \"Florensz\" which was named after his father. Pope Benedict XI, as mentioned previously, was named \"Nicholas\" after St. Nicholas of Patara.\n\nThere are a couple of cases where the Prophesy appears to reference the Pope's papal name, but this should be understood as more of a coincidence. For example, Pope Martin IV is given the motto \"Tollhouse of Martin of the lilies\" (Ex teloneo liliacei Martini). The motto actually refers to Pope Martin's previous office, which was treasurer of the Church of St. Martin of Tours. As one might imagine, Popes will typically select a papal name based on a saint that they particularly admire or aspire to be like, which is very likely a saint associated with the office they came from.\n\nThere are a couple of mottos that refer to a set of coat of arms, but not the personal arms of the pope in question. Antipope John XXIII is given the motto \"Stag of the siren\" (Cervus sirenae), because he was born in Naples (represented by a siren). Pope Eugene IV is given the motto \"Heavenly she-wolf\" (Lupa coelestina), because he was formally Bishop of Siena (represented by a she-wolf). The strangest of all is the case of Pope Leo X, who is given the motto \"From a political gridiron\" (De craticula politiana). The gridiron is emblematic of the Pope's father, Lorenzo the Magnificent, because it's the symbol of St. Lawrence. These are the worst outliers, while most of the mottos have a fairly straightforward interpretation.\n\nThere are a few points of ambiguity in this system of interpretation that should be cleared up:\n\nAmbiguity of name and herald: It is common for families to design their coat of arms based on the literal translation of their name. For example, the Colonna family has a crest depicting a series of columns. So when the Prophesy refers to colonna, it could be referring to either one of these. In this essay, I will always defer to the heraldic interpretation, regardless of what Wion's interpreter says, whenever such an ambiguity arises.\n\nAmbiguity of name and birthplace: In pre-modern times, there are many people whose surname derives from the place of birth, rather than their family, and this is also the case for a few Popes in the Prophesy. For example, Pope Celestine II is named Guido de Castello, and was born at the city of Castello; Antipope Nicholas V was named Pietro di Corvaro, and was born at the city of Corvaro. But here Wion creates some ambiguity, for in the former case he interprets the Prophesy as a birthplace (\"An inhabitant of Tifernum-Tiberinum [AKA Castello]\"), but in the latter case he interprets it as a name (\"Who was called Brother Peter Corvarium\"). In this essay, I will defer to using the birthplace.\n\nThis analysis establishes a correlation between certain phrases to specific noble families. Including, but not limited to:\n\nHouse of Barbo: lion\n\nHouse of Boncompagni: half-body\n\nHouse of Borgia: bull, ox\n\nHouse of Caetini: waves\n\nHouse of Carafa: faith\n\nHouse of Colonna: columns\n\nHouse of Conti di Segni: \"designated count\", sign, bird, school\n\nHouse of Cybo: square\n\nHouse of Della Rovere: oak tree (AKA Jupiter Tree)\n\nHouse of Farnese: hyacinth\n\nHouse of Geneva: cross\n\nHouse of Medici: medicine, pills, flowers\n\nHouse of Orsini: rose, cattle\n\nHouse of Piccolomini: \"small man\"\n\nHouse of Savoy: cross\n\nHouse of Visconti: snake\n\nHaving laid out those principles, the following table summarizes how all the 74 mottos prior to 1590 are broken down into constituent phrases, and how each phrase is interpreted:\n\nNo. Pope Birthname Motto First phrase Second phrase First interpretation Second interpretation Explanation 1 Pope Celestine II (1143–44) Guido de Castello From a castle of the Tiber Castle Tiber Birthplace Birthplace Born at Città di Castello, near the Tiber 2 Pope Lucius II (1144–45) Gherardo Caccianemici del Orso Enemy expelled Enemy Espelled Name Name Last name Cacciare (\"expelled\"), Nemici (\"enemies\") 3 Pope Eugene III (1145–53) Bernardo dei Paganelli From the great mountain Great Mountain Birthplace Birthplace Born at Montemagno (\"great mountain\") 4 Pope Anastasius IV (1153–54) Corrado di Suburra Abbot from Subbura Abbot Subbura Former Office Birthplace Born at Subbura;

Again, this analysis solely uses the information that can be gleaned before the Prophesy actually happens, without using any OTL Popes as any kind of point of reference. While we don't have the luxury of knowing the interpretation of each motto a priori, this section will provide the best possible guess based on the mechanics that have been established thus far.\n\nJust as it was before 1590, each motto of the Prophesy can be divided into two distinct phrases, where each phrase represents a single piece of personal information. The 38 mottos of the Prophesy therefore gives us a total of 75 phrases (one of the mottos, \"Of the Half Moon\", is only one phrase). Categorizing these phrases thematically/grammatically gives the following statistics:\n\nAdjectives/descriptors: 14; 19% (\"Wicked\", \"Lofty\", \"Swift\", etc.)\n\nAbstract concepts: 13; 17% (\"Religion\", \"War\", \"Antiquity\", etc.)\n\nAnimals: 9; 12% (\"Swans\", \"Dog\", \"Man\", etc.)\n\nOccupations: 8; 10% (\"Shephard\", \"Sailor\", \"Soldier\", etc.)\n\nPlants: 7; 9% (\"Flower\", \"Rose\", \"Lily\", and \"Olive\")\n\nGeometric shapes: 6; 8% (\"Cross\", \"Column\", and \"Wave\")\n\nGeneric locations: 5; 6% (\"City\", \"Mountain\", \"Sky\", etc.)\n\nObjects: 3; 4% (\"Rake\", \"Door\", and \"Baths\")\n\nSpecific locations: 3; 4% (\"Etruria\", \"Rome\", and \"Umbria\")\n\nCelestial bodies: 3; 4% (\"Sun\", \"Half Moon\", \"Star\")\n\nProper names: 2; 3% (\"Peter\" and \"Romulus\")\n\nElements: 2; 3% (\"Light\" and \"Fire\")\n\nNow, it cannot go unnoticed that there is a statistical shift in the language of the Prophesy towards vagueness. Before 1590, the most commonly-used phrases were proper names and places. Afterwards, the most common phrases are abstract concepts or adjectives. Nonetheless, the previous arguments still apply that the Prophet had some specific ideas for the future trajectory of the Catholic Church, which is what the rest of this article will meticulously tease out.\n\nThe interpretations of these phrases can be best estimated with the following method: First, there are 24 phrases used after 1590 which are already used, in some form or another, by the mottos before 1590. It can therefore be assumed that the interpretation of these phrases should be the same:\n\nPhrase Pre-1590 example Interpretation Notes Adder Snaky man Herald House of Visconti Column Crown of the golden curtain Herald House of Colonna Cross Lover of the cross Herald Possibly House of Savoy Flower Flower of the sick man's pill Herald Possibly Houes of Medici Half Moon Cosmedine moon Herald Possibly surnamed Luna Lily From the tollhouse of Martin of the lilies Herald Probably a fleur-di-lis Mountains From the mountains of Pammachius Herald Rose Composite Rose Herald Possibly House of Orsini Star From a better star Herald Sun Whip of the sun Herald Wavy From the blessing of the waves Herald Possibly House of Caetani Angelic Angel of the grove Name Probably Michael Faith From Peter's faith Name Probably Carafa Good Good Count Name Probably Bono Man From a small man Name Probably suffix \"-ini\" Peter From Peter's faith Name Peter (or variations thereof) Great From the great mountain Birthplace Light A light in the door Birthplace Lucca, Tuscany Sailor Sailor from a black bridge Birthplace Venice Apostolic From the apostolic cross Former office Cardinal Bishop of Twelve Apostles Door A light in the door Former office Cardinal Bishop of Ostia Sky Heavenly she-wolf Former office Possibly Celestines Country From cattle country none/other Guard From the guardian goose none/other\n\nIt can be assumed that the above list of interpretations are a given. That is to say, it is an ironclad rule that \"sailor\" must refer to Venice, that \"door\" must refer to Ostia, etc. Other interpretations in the Prophesy will have some room for interpretation or margin of error, but these first 24 phrases are known for certain. A couple of these phrases are used multiple times in the post-1590 mottos (\"cross\", \"flower\", \"rose\", and \"man\"). This therefore brings the total number of interpreted phrases up to 31. This leaves 44 phrases remaining.\n\nNext, there are 21 out of 38 mottos that follow a similar pattern or cadence as one of the mottos before 1590. It can therefore be assumed that the corresponding phrases from parallel mottos should be interpreted the same way. Three of these parallel mottos are redundant, because they are composed of phrases that have already been interpreted (\"Wavy man\", \"Guard of the mountains\", and \"Light in the sky\"). The remaining 18 mottos are as follows:\n\nNo. Motto Parallel pre-1590 motto First interpretation Second interpretation 77 Cross of Romulus The sword of Lawrence Herald Office 82 Delight of the cross Lover of the cross Name Herald 85 From a great river From the great mountain Birthplace Birthplace 86 Insatiable beast Sabine Lion Office Herald 89 Surrounded by flowers Composite Rose Herald Herald 92 Lofty column From a better star Name Herald 93 Country animal Pasturing ox none/other Herald 94 Rose of Umbria From the rose of Arras Herald Office 95 Swift bear Heavenly she-wolf Office Office 96 Apostolic pilgrim Tuscan Fisherman Office Name 97 Rapacious eagle Schismatic crow none/other Birthplace 98 Dog and adder From a stag and lion Office Herald 99 Religious man From a small man Name Name 100 From the baths of Etruria Jerusalem of Champagne Office Birthplace 104 Religion destroyed Enemy expelled Name Name 105 Intrepid faith From Peter's faith Name Name 106 Angelic shepherd Good Count Name Office 110 From the labor of the sun Cosmedine moon Office Herald\n\nThis gives us an interpretation for another 23 phrases. As was the case with the previous method, there are a couple of phrases which are used multiple times in the Prophesy after 1590 (\"religion\" and \"shepherd\"). Also, I will assume that \"Roman\" should have the same interpretation as \"Romulus\" because of how similar those concepts are. This brings the total number of phrases interpreted by this method as 26. Combined with the 31 phrases in the first method, this gives us 57 phrases interpreted so far.\n\nOf the 18 phrases that cannot be discerned by the first two methods, we can use the previously-established principle that the Prophesy defers to the use of heraldry whenever it can. There are a few phrases that lend themselves towards heraldic imagery. That is to say, they refer to some kind of plant or animal, or other visual image that could conceivably appear on a coat of arms. Those phrases are as follows:\n\nSwans (for example, the Monesi family)\n\nFire\n\nOlive (or, more commonly, an olive branch)\n\nRake (note that the Latin word for rake [rastrum] is similar to the Italian word rastellato, meaning an embattlement on a herald)\n\nFinally, the first motto of the Prophesy is already given to us: \"Antiquity of the city\" (Ex antiquitate urbis) refers to Girolamo Simoncelli, the Cardinal for whom the Prophesy was originally designed for. In this case, the two constituent phrases (\"antiquity\" and \"city\") both refer to the Cardinal's birthplace: He was born in Orvieto, which is locally referred to as Urbs vetus (\"Old city\"). This reinforces the idea of how literal the Prophesy is meant to be understood.\n\nAfter all of the above analysis, there are 14 remaining phrases (from seven different mottos) which cannot be easily understood. In other words, these last phrases are ambiguous in their interpretation because 1) they do not share any phrases in common with pre-1590 mottos, 2) they do not follow the pattern or cadence of any pre-1590 motto, and 3) they use abstract or descriptive language that cannot be interpreted as a coat of arms. These ambiguous mottos are as follows:\n\nPious citizens in war (Pia civitas in bello)\n\nWicked race (Gens perversa)\n\nIn the trouble of peace (In tribulatione pacis)\n\nGlorious penitence (Poenitentia gloriosa)\n\nSoldier in war (Miles in bello)\n\nBurning fire (Ignis ardens)\n\nGlory of the olive (Gloria olivae)\n\nThere is an interesting self-sufficient ecosystem between these phrases, as they share some phrases in common with each other (\"war\" and \"glory\") which don't appear in any other phrases. It also alludes to sequential chapters of a story: Citizens in war, then a troublesome peace, then a period of penitence, and finally soldiers in war. I will end up bending my own rule in this case, and use some of these phrases to describe events during their pontificate.\n\nCombining all the information from these different directions of analysis, the following table shows how all 38 mottos after 1590 are meant to be interpreted:\n\nNo. Motto First phrase Second phrase First interpretation Second interpretation 75 Of the antiquity of the city Antiquity City Birthplace Birthplace 76 Pious citizens in war Pious citizens War Unknown Unknown 77 Cross of Romulus Cross Romulus Herald Former office 78 Wavy man Wavy Man Herald none/other 79 Wicked race Wicked Race Unknown Unknown 80 In the trouble of peace Trouble Peace Unknown Unknown 81 Lily and rose Lily Rose Herald Herald 82 Delight of the cross Delight Cross Name Herald 83 Guard of the mountains Guard Mountains none/other Herald 84 Star of the swans Star Swans Herald Herald 85 From a great river Great River Birthplace Birthplace 86 Insatiable beast Insatiable Beast Office Herald 87 Glorious penitence Glorious Penitence Unknown Unknown 88 Rake in the door Rake Door Herald Former office 89 Surrounded flowers Surrounded Flowers Herald Herald 90 From good religion Good Religion Name Name 91 Soldier in War Soldier War Unknown Unknown 92 Lofty column Lofty Column Name Herald 93 Country animal Country Animal none/other Herald 94 Rose of Umbria Rose Umbria Herald Former office 95 Swift bear Swift Bear Former office Former office 96 Apostolic pilgrim Apostolic Pilgrim Former office Name 97 Rapacious eagle Rapacious Eagle none/other Birthplace 98 Dog and adder Dog Adder Former office Herald 99 Religious man Religious Man Name Name 100 From the baths of Etruria Baths Etruria Former office Birthplace 101 Cross from cross Cross Cross Herald Herald 102 Light in the sky Light Sky Birthplace Former office 103 Burning fire Burning Fire Unknown Herald 104 Religion destroyed Religion Destroyed Name Name 105 Intrepid faith Intrepid Faith Name Name 106 Angelic shepherd Angelic Shepherd Name Former office 107 Shepherd and sailor Shepherd Sailor Former office Birthplace 108 Flower of flowers Flower Flowers Herald Herald 109 Of the half moon N/A Half Moon none/other Herald 110 From the labor of the sun Labor Sun Former office Herald 111 Glory of the olive. Glory Olive Unknown Herald 112 Peter the Roman Peter Roman Name Former office\n\nThe above table of interpretations can be broken down into the following statistics, showing the distribution of interpretations across the 75 phrases:\n\nCoat of arms: 25, 33%\n\nName: 14, 18%\n\nFormer office or occupation: 12, 16%\n\nBirthplace: 7, 9%\n\nNone/other: 8, 11%\n\nUnknown: 10, 13%\n\nMost of these proportions are very close to their pre-1590 counterparts. Some of them are reduced from what would be expected, especially the former offices which dropped from 30% to only 16%. This is explained by the unknown phrases, whose interpretations most likely fit in that category.\n\nThe rest of this article will break down exactly what each of these interpretations will mean for each Pope, and what methodology can be used to construct a timeline, one step at a time, all the way down to the present day.\n\nGuide to a Timeline on the Prophesy[]\n\nAdditional Mechanics[]\n\nIn order to transform the Prophesy of Popes into an actual timeline, certain practical limitations need to be first addressed, which will then generate some simplifying assumptions. At first glance, the timeline on the Prophesy could be generated by using the following algorithm:\n\nInitialize the first Pope as Girolamo Simoncelli, who dies in 1605\n\nUpon the Pope's death, identify all Cardinals who were serving at that time, and assemble them into an ATL conclave\n\nAmong the Cardinals present at the ATL conclave, select whichever best matches the next motto of the Prophesy\n\nIf no Cardinal fits with the motto, then select some contemporary individual who does, and assume they are a Cardinal in ATL due to unforeseen Butterfly effects\n\nTake note if multiple Cardinals fit the same motto. This can be used to backtrack and adjust the chronology in order to minimize the possibility of scenario 3.1\n\nSet the selected Cardinal as the next Pope\n\nRepeat steps 2-4 until the Petrus Romanus is identified\n\nThe major problem with the above algorithm is the time complexity needed to identify candidate Cardinals, and judging whether or not each of them fits with the corresponding motto. In a perfect world, the most efficient approach would be to start with a single database, containing the relevant information of every Cardinal who has served after 1590 (including their name, dates served, coat of arms, birthplace, and former offices). Then, each entry in the database would be marked with every motto in the Prophesy that they could potentially fulfill. Finally, a simple script could be written that would combine this database with the above algorithm, generating every possible combination of Popes that would fulfill the Prophesy down to the present day.\n\nHowever, for all practical purposes it is unlikely that any such database could be easily produced. Granted, the time period that the Prophesy covers is relatively modern, so it is conceivable that such personal information should be accessible somewhere, but it's very much non-trivial. Among the hundreds (possibly thousands) of Cardinals who have served since 1590, the vast majority of these come from obscure backgrounds, such that their birthplace or heraldry may not be publicly disclosed. At best, one might be able to produce a database containing each Cardinal's name and dates of service, but that alone would take considerable effort. Thus, the author of this timeline should take some simplifying assumptions in order to maximize the efficiency of this process\n\nFirst, the author should limit the scope of their search almost entirely to Italy. From the death of Pope Adrian VI in 1523, until the election of Pope John Paul II in 1978, every single Pope was Italian in origin. Because this trend began several decades before the PoD, then it is unlikely for it to be any different in ATL. This means that the author should lean towards interpretations of the Prophesy that are applicable to Italian Cardinals: Italian names, Italian places, and Italian heraldry. Once the timeline reaches the 1960s or later, then the author can start to broaden their scope of their search to consider non-Italian candidates. Of course, this suggestion should not be taken too restrictive, on the off-chance that the author stumbles across a non-Italian Cardinal who happens to fit the motto very nicely.\n\nSecond, the author can take advantage of the fact that each motto has two distinct phrases, and thus provides two separate pieces of information. Let's assume that one phrase gives information that is relatively easy to check (such as a name), while the other phrase is non-trivial to check (like a former office). Then, the process of identifying candidate Cardinals could work like this:\n\nAutomatically filter the list of Cardinals, to generate a smaller list of candidates that match the trivial phrase\n\nManually check each Cardinal in the smaller list against the non-trivial phrase\n\nNext, there are certain inferences the author can use that would make each piece of information easier to identify, given that they are using a database that only contains names and dates:\n\nName: search the database for that name (including linguistic variations)\n\nCoat of arms: identify all Italian families whose coat of arms fits that motto. Then, search the database for surnames that match these families\n\nBirthplace: assume that the Cardinal would hold an office close to where they are born (for example, the motto \"Light in the sky\" suggests a Pope that is born in Lucca, so this can be assumed to refer to the Archbishop of Lucca)\n\nFormer office: requires manual checking. Thus, in these cases the author should defer to the information provided by the other phrase first\n\nIn the next section, I will systematically go through each motto one-by-one, and utilize the above mechanics to give my best recommendation for how the author can identify each Papal candidate.\n\nSuggestions per Pope[]\n\nThis section will list out each motto of the Prophesy after 1590, and provide the best possible suggestions for how that motto can be used to identify the corresponding Pope. These suggestions draw heavily from previously-published analyses on the same prophesy (particularly O'Brien). However, the difference is that this analysis will be completely agnostic to any Pope elected in OTL, and none of these suggestions will be influenced by the personal information of their OTL counterparts. I will sometimes make references to major historical events from OTL that would likely still happen (such as the Thirty Years War), just not the OTL Popes.\n\n75. Of the antiquity of the city (Ex antiquitate urbis)\n\nInterpretation: birthplace\n\nThis is the easiest entry of the whole list. It's Girolamo Simoncelli, as the original author of the Prophesy forged it specifically for him. As mentioned previously, Simoncelli was born in the city of Orvieto, which is locally known as Urbs vetus (or \"old city\"). Very little is known about this Cardinal, except that he was related to Pope Julius III, and he was aligned with the Spanish Habsburgs politically. He would reign for fifteen years before dying in 1605, outliving the OTL Popes Gregory XIV and Innocent IX. More discussion is made later on the possible political implications of this papacy.\n\n76. Pious citizens in war (Pia civitas in bello)\n\nInterpretation: unknown (possibly birthplace?)\n\nRight off the bat, we run into one of the more enigmatic mottos of the Prophesy. Generally speaking, these mottos with unknown interpretations are concentrated to the early part of the Prophesy, while the later mottos are more straightforward. This is the first pontificate in which I bend my own rule, and suggest that it actually refers to an event during the Pope's reign. Since Simoncelli died in 1605, then it is entirely possible that his successor lives long enough to see the outbreak of the Thirty Years War.\n\nAlternatively, some translate the first phrase as \"Pious city\", which would mean this motto technically shares a phrase in common with the previous pope (\"Of the antiquity of the city\"). This could mean that the motto actually refers to the Pope's place of birth. There are some cities in Italy which have the word \"bello\" in its name, such as Alberobello in Apulia. I do not make use of that in this essay, but it is worth noting that is an alternate tact the author could take.\n\n77. Cross of Romulus (Crux Romulea)\n\nParallel motto: The sword of Lawrence (Ensis Laurentii)\n\nInterpretation: herald, office\n\nA cross should appear on his herald. This motif in the Prophesy is used for for two different noble houses before 1590 (the House of Savoy for Antipope Felix V, and the House of Geneva for Antipope Clement VII). However, there could easily be a number of other families with the same motif, as O'Brien states \"A forger would naturally chance the cross in alluding to a future pope, as well on account of its connection with everything papal as on account of its frequent recurrence, in some form or other, in armorial bearings\"[37].\n\nI compare this motto with The sword of Lawrence, as both of these use an object as the first phrase (being heraldic) and a proper name as the second (referring to an office). Because the character Romulus is the legendary founder of Rome, then this office should have something to do with the city of Rome itself. It cannot be any church that happens to reside in Rome, but rather has to be an office that is somehow tied to the city as a whole. Some possible explanations include the Cardinal Secretary of State (presiding over the Roman Curia), or the Cardinal Vicar of Rome.\n\n78. Wavy man (Undosus vir)\n\nParallel motto: Snaky man (Anguinus vir)\n\nInterpretation: herald\n\nA wave should appear on his herald, as was the case with Pope Boniface VIII (\"From the blessing of the waves\"). In fact, he may very well be from the same noble family of Caetani. The \"man\" part of the motto is meant to be ignored, as it didn't mean anything for Pope Gregory X.\n\n79. Wicked race (Gens perversa)\n\nInterpretation: unknown (possibly birthplace)\n\nAnother enigmatic motto. O'Brien dismissively says \"It would be easy to find a wicked race during this pope's pontificate as well as at any other time.\"[38]. However, it is interesting to note that St. Bernard's biography of St. Malachy makes frequent references to how perverse and immoral the people of Ireland are, effectively calling them a wicked race[39]. Since Malachy is (erroneously) accredited for first making the Prophesy, perhaps the interpretation stemming from his opinion should take highest priority. This would mean that this Pope should be Irish in origin, or perhaps hold an office related to a patron saint of Ireland. Here, the author could select whoever happens to be Primate of Ireland at the time of the conclave.\n\n80. In the trouble of peace (In tribulatione pacis)\n\nInterpretation: unknown\n\nThe third enigmatic motto, and the second for which I will suggest bending my own rule. Because this is a few Popes removed from \"Pious citizens in war\", then this Pope could be contemporary with the end of the Thirty Years War, or whatever ATL equivalent there is. Because these enigmatic mottos don't necessarily give any indication on the Pope's identity, then it can be essentially treated as a \"free space\". That is to say, the author can select whatever Cardinal helps adjust the chronology of future Popes in the most optimal way, or make up a fictional Cardinal entirely.\n\n81. Lily and rose (Lilium et rosa)\n\nInterpretation: herald\n\nHis herald should have both roses and lilies on it, or more likely a rosette and fleur-di-lis. Both of these flowers appear in earlier mottos (\"From the tollhouse of Martin of the lilies\", \"Composite Rose\"). With such a specific description, the number of families with that particular combination of heraldry must be limited (or at least, more limited than the more generic descriptions like \"cross\" or \"animal\").\n\n82. Delight of the cross (Jucunditas crucis)\n\nParallel motto: Lover of the cross (Amator Crucis)\n\nInterpretation: name, herald\n\nA cross should appear on his herald, as long as we are sticking closely to the mechanics of the Prophesy laid out for us. By following the motto \"Lover of the cross\" (referring to Antipope Felix V) then we are meant to interpret Jucunditas as the Pope's name (since both mottos have an abstract, positive descriptor followed by \"cross\"). As it turns out, the name \"Gioconda\" is a very common given name in Italian, which literally means \"delightful\". So the author should first search for Cardinals named Gioconda, and then narrow the search by their coat of arms.\n\n83. Guard of the mountains (Montium custos)\n\nParallel motto: From the guardian goose (Ex ansere custode)\n\nInterpretation: herald\n\nMountains or hills should appear on his herald. The Prophesy uses this motif to refer to Popes from two different families: \"From the mountains of Pammachius\" for Pope Innocent VI (although his herald was incorrect), and \"From the mountainous crown\" for Pope Julius III. Pope Julius was from the family of del Monte, which literally means \"of the mountains\", although the reputation of this family was severely tainted after the scandals involving Cardinal Innocenzo Del Monte. Nonetheless, there may be many other families that use this same motif, as O'Brien states \"it must be noted that on looking over a work like Ciacconius [...] you will find those hills pretty often recurring\"[40].\n\nThere is an interesting parallel, possibly deliberate, between this motto and \"From the guardian goose\". There is a legend that a flock of geese saved the city of Rome, during the Battle of Allia in 387 BC. This makes the goose the guardian of Rome, but also makes it guard of the seven hills or \"mountains\" that are emblematic of Rome. At any rate, the word \"guard\" in this case is meant to be ignored, as it meant nothing in the case of Pope Alexander III.\n\n84. Star of the swans (Sydus olorum)\n\nInterpretation: herald\n\nBoth a star and swans should appear on his herald. When the word \"star\" was previously used in the Prophesy, it referred to a comet on the coat of arms (\"From a better star\", referring to Pope Innocent VII). With such a specific description, it is hard to imagine there are many Italian families that it could be referring to. Indeed, O'Brien says he identified a noble family of that exact description, but doesn't give their name[41]. He might have been referring to the Monesi family, a noble house that is first recorded in the 16th century as patricians of Modena.\n\n85. From a great river (De flumine magno)\n\nParallel motto: From the great mountain (Ex magnitudine motis)\n\nInterpretation: birthplace\n\nMost people reading the Prophesy seem to assume that this refers to the Tiber River[42]. From the perspective of someone living in America, familiar with such mighty rivers as the Mississippi or the Susquehanna, I fail to understand what is so \"great\" about the Tiber. Nonetheless, the Prophesy was never so indirect when talking about the Tiber before (see \"From a castle of the Tiber\", and \"Road across the Tiber\"). Instead, I compare this motto to the kind of play-on-words used for Pope Eugene III (\"From the great mountain\"). That is to say, a river that is literally called \"great\". As it turns out, there is a river in Sicily called Imera Settentrionale, also known as Fiume Grande (or \"great river\"). The author may select whoever the Archbishop of Palermo is at the time, and assume that they were born near that river.\n\n86. Insatiable beast (Bellua insatiabilis)\n\nParallel motto: Sabine Lion (Leo Sabinus)\n\nInterpretation: office, herald\n\nSome kind of carnivorous animal should appear on his herald. The \"insatiable\" part seems to be primarily a description of the beast, and so might not mean anything. But if this is intended to parallel earlier mottos like \"Sabine Lion\" (originally referencing Pope Celestine IV, then we are meant to interpret the other phrase as some kind of former office or occupation (since both mottos have a descriptor followed by a carnivorous animal). However, I don't currently have any theories on what office insatiabilis could be referring to.\n\n87. Glorious penitence (Poenitentia gloriosa)\n\nInterpretation: unknown (possibly office)\n\nWe return once again to an enigmatic motto. O'Brien remarks, \"There are glorious repentances during every pontificate\"[43]. This is the third motto in which I suggest a reference to the Pope's pontificate: if we interpret \"penitence\" as a kind of noble humility, then perhaps this is a period after the end of the aforementioned war in which the Papacy is forced into submission by some foreign power.\n\nNote that the phrase \"glory\" here is shared in common with \"Glory of the olive\" (Gloria oliuae), whose interpretation is also unknown. It's possible that this Pope previously held an office related to the Church of Santa Croce in Florence, which is commonly referred to as Tempio del Itale Glorie (or \"Temple of Italian glories\").\n\n88. Rake in the door (Rastrum in porta)\n\nInterpretation: herald, office\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Latin word rastrum can also refer to an embattlement on a herald[44]. The phrase \"door\" consistently refers to the Cardinal Bishop of Ostia (see \"A light in the door\"). Thus, this Pope should be from that office with an embattlement on his herald.\n\n89. Surrounded by flowers (Flores circundati)\n\nParallel motto: Composite Rose (Rosa composita)\n\nInterpretation: herald\n\nFlowers, of any kind, should appear on his herald. By comparing this to the motto \"Composite Rose\" (representing Pope Nicholas III), then the \"surrounded\" part is interpreted as a further description of this same herald (as both mottos are a descriptor of a flower). That is to say, the herald should have some symbol which is supported by images of flowers. Many Italian families likely have arms that match this description.\n\n90. From good religion (De bona religione)\n\nInterpretation: name\n\nHis given name should contain \"Bono\", as is the case with Pope Adrian V (\"Good Count\"). This phrase religione is never used in pre-1590 mottos, but used three times in total after 1590. The general assessment of this analysis is that this phrase is intended to be a reference to the Pope's name (as some kind of pun in Italian), either their given name or surname. However, I don't have any theories as to what Italian name is meant by this phrase.\n\n91. Soldier in War (Miles in bello)\n\nInterpretation: unknown (likely office)\n\nThe last of the particularly enigmatic mottos, and the last for which I will suggest bending the rule about references to the pontificate itself. Because this is several popes removed from the mottos alluding to the Thirty Years War, then this Pope may have begun his career as a soldier in that same conflict, before devoting his life to the church (reminiscent of the life of Ignatius of Loyola). This means that this motto technically should be interpreted as a reference to the Pope's former occupation.\n\n92. Lofty column (Columna excelsa)\n\nParallel motto: From a better star (De meliore sydere)\n\nInterpretation: name, herald\n\nA column should appear on his herald, almost certainly referencing the Colonna family (as \"Column of the golden curtain\" referenced Pope Martin V). The phrase \"Lofty\" might be a descriptor of the column, and so it might not mean anything. However, if this is parallel with the motto \"From a better star\" (referencing Pope Innocent VII), then that suggests the \"Lofty\" should reference the Pope's name (because both mottos are a descriptor followed by a geometric shape). The name \"Alto\", meaning \"tall\", is fairly common given name in Italian.\n\n93. Country animal (Animal rurale)\n\nParallel motto: Pasturing ox (Bos pascens)\n\nInterpretation: herald\n\nA herd animal, likely some kind of farm animal, should appear on his herald. O'Brien drew the parallel with \"Pasturing ox\", which is the crest of the House of Borja[45]. However, he may not necessarily come from the House of Borja, as many other Italian heralds may fit the same description.\n\n94. Rose of Umbria (Rosa Umbriae)\n\nParallel motto: From the rose of Arras (De rosa Attrebatensi)\n\nInterpretation: herald, office\n\nA rose should appear on his herald. The pre-1590 mottos use this motif to refer to Popes of two different families: House of Orsini (for Pope Nicholas III), and the Roger family (for Clement VI). The latter family was not nearly as famous, but is more direct in its etymology, since it derives from the French name rosiers meaning \"rose bush\". Nonetheless, many other Italian families may use the same motif.\n\nThe comparison with \"From the rose of Arras\" would suggest that the phrase \"Umbria\" must reference the Pope's former occupation (sine both mottos are the word \"rose\" followed by a proper place name). Umbria is a dense region of central Italy, but the vast majority of the time the name is uttered, it is in connection to one specific individual from that region: St. Francis of Assisi. The author can thus conclude that this Pope should come from the Franciscan order. In more practical terms, the author should first filter for Cardinals whose families use the rose as their herald, and then manually check each Cardinal to see which one of them is a Franciscan.\n\n95. Swift Bear (Ursus velox)\n\nParallel motto: Heavenly she-wolf (Lupa Coelestina)\n\nInterpretation: office, office (or name)\n\nI compare this motto with \"Heavenly she-wolf\" (referencing Pope Eugene IV), as both mottos are a descriptor followed by a wild animal. This would suggest that both phrases indicate two different former offices or occupations the Pope had prior to their election. In the case of Pope Eugene, he was previously Bishop of Siena (which is symbolized by a she-wolf). Therefore, we can assume that this Pope previously had an office related to a place symbolized by a bear. There are certainly many locations outside of Italy that use this motif (like the cities of Berlin and Madrid, or the Russian Empire), so perhaps this person was a Papal ambassador to one of them. However, I am unsure how the phrase \"swift\" (velox) could be interpreted as an office. There are places in Italy with the word \"Velo\" in it (such as Velo d'Astico), but that doesn't translate into the name of an office.\n\nAlternatively, O'Brien suggested that \"Bear\" actually refers to the Pope's name, specifically the House of Orsini (as a pun off of the word ursinus)[46]. This may be more likely than using the interpretation of an office. However, if that is the case then the parallelism with \"Heavenly she-wolf\" is nullified, leaving the phrase velox as a completely unknown interpretation[47].\n\n96. Apostolic Pilgrim (Peregrinus apostolicus)\n\nParallel motto: Tuscan Fisherman (Piscator Thuscus)\n\nInterpretation: office, name\n\nThe phrase \"Apostolic\" most certainly refers to the Cardinal Bishop of the Twelve Apostles, as was the case with Antipope Clement VII (\"From the apostolic cross\"). I compare this motto with \"Tuscan Fisherman\" (referring to Pope John XXI), as both mottos contain an allusion to a Cardinal title followed by a generic occupation. This suggests that the phrase \"Pilgrim\" references the Pope's personal name. Indeed, O'Brien suggests that it is meant to refer to the Pellegrini family[48]. Unfortunately, not a single person who has held the title of Carinal Bishop of the Twelve Apostles has ever been named Pellegrini. Thus, the author will have to resort to selecting some Cardinal named Pellegrini, and assume they hold that particular office in ATL due to unforeseen butterfly effects.\n\n97. Rapacious Eagle (Aquila rapax)\n\nParallel motto: Schismatic crow (Corvus schismaticus)\n\nInterpretation: birthplace (or name?)\n\nIt is tempting to interpret the eagle as a herald, as O'Brien mentions \"The eagle is common in armorial bearings\"[49]. However, when it comes to the use of birds in the Prophesy, I found the closest parallel to be \"Schismatic crow\" of Antipope Nicholas V (as both mottos have an evocative description followed a bird). The eagle is very sacred to the nation of Italy, as it was a symbol of the Roman Empire, and there are many places named after it (such as the city of L'Aquila). Thus, the author can use whoever the current Archbishop of L'Aquila is, and assume they were born in that same city. The \"Rapacious\" phrase could mean nothing, or refer to something innocuous like the Pope's personality.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Antipope Nicholas V was named \"Pietro di Corvaro\" because he was born in the city of Corvaro, which creates some ambiguity as to whether the Prophesy is referring to a name or a place. \"Aquila\" is also a common given name in Italian.\n\n98. Dog and adder (Canis et coluber)\n\nParallel motto: From a stag and lion (De Cervo et Leone)\n\nInterpretation: office, herald\n\nA snake should appear on his herald, as was the case for Pope Gregory X (\"Snaky man\"). This could refer to the House of Visconti, but snakes appear on many other heralds as well. Dogs also appear on heralds on occasion. However, in this case I draw a parallel to the motto \"From a stag and lion\" (referencing Pope Paul II), since both mottos include two different animals conjoined with \"and\". This would suggest that the phrase \"dog\" references some former office occupation.\n\nThe dog is immediately recognizable as the symbol of St. Dominic (just like the stag was symbolic of St. Eustachius). In the middle ages, the Dominican Order was jokingly referred to as domini canes (or \"the Lord's dogs\"). Therefore, this Pope is almost certainly a Dominican. The author should first filter the list of Cardinals for families using the snake motif, and then manually check each remaining Cardinal for Dominicans.\n\n99. Religious man (Vir religiosus)\n\nParallel motto: From a small man (De parvo homine)\n\nInterpretation: name\n\nThe second motto containing the word religiones. The parallel motto lends more weight to the connection of this word to a person's name (as was the case with Pope Pius III), since both mottos are a descriptor followed by \"man\". Still, I have no theory as to how religiones can be interpreted as an Italian name.\n\n100. From the baths of Etruria (De balneis Ethruriae)\n\nParallel motto: Jerusalem of Champagne (Hierusalem Campanie)\n\nInterpretation: office, birthplace\n\nI connect this motto to that of Pope Urban IV (\"Jerusalem of Champagne\"), as both mottos are allusions to two specific locations conjoined by \"of\". That being the case, then the first phrase refers to a former office while the second phrase refers to the Pope's birthplace. In the first phrase, the Pope may have been a member of the Order of Bath, or held an office in a city famous for their Roman baths. The second phrase is much easier: he is born in Tuscany, known in ancient Latin as \"Etruria\".\n\n101. Cross from cross (Crux de cruce)\n\nInterpretation: herald (and name)\n\nIn all the pre-1590 mottos, the cross is always used to refer to a herald, as it likely should in this case as well. However, because the word \"cross\" is mentioned twice, then it is likely meant to refer to two different pieces of information, rather than being redundant. O'Brien suggested that it refers to the Italian noble family of Del Croce. There are also other names that derive from this same motif, such as the Spanish surname de la Cruz.\n\nIf it refers to a birthplace, there are many places that are symbolized by a cross. However, previous mottos of the Prophesy take particular interest in referencing the cross of Savoy, so that region of southern France is more likely than anything else. It's probably best to limit the scope of search to just these suggestions, as there are way too many people and places in Catholicism that utilize crosses to consider them all.\n\n102. Light in the sky (Lumen in coelo)\n\nParallel motto: A light in the door (Lux in ostio)\n\nInterpretation: birthplace, office\n\nPrevious mottos of the Prophesy associate light with the city of Lucca, as was the case with Pope Lucius III. Other mottos of the Prophesy associate the sky (coelo) with the Celestine Order (see \"Heavenly she-wolf\"). So, the author can assume that this Pope was previously Archbishop of Lucca, and they are a member of the Celestines. There are possibly other locations that could be represented by \"light\". For example, the ancient Roman name for Paris is Lutetia, the same place which is nowadays called \"the city of lights\".\n\nThis is the last motto that is directly addressed by O'Brien, as it corresponds to what was the incumbent Pope in his day, namely Pope Leo XIII[50].\n\n103. Burning fire (Ignis ardens)\n\nInterpretation: herald (and possibly birthplace)\n\nA symbol of fire should appear on his herald. This isn't determined by any parallel motto or shared phrase, but simply assumed because fire is a rather common motif on heraldry. The phrase \"burning\" seems to simply describe the fire, and so might not mean anything. However, it is interesting that the Latin word ardens is so similar to the region of northeastern France, the Ardennes. This could possibly be the Pope's intended birthplace. Thus, the author could infer that this Pope was formally Archbishop of Reims. However, the fact this motto comes immediately after \"Light in the sky\" limits our ability to use that interpretation, as will be explained more in a later section on \"fixed points\".\n\n104. Religion destroyed (Religio depopulata)\n\nParallel motto: Enemy expelled (Inimicus expulsus)\n\nInterpretation: name\n\nOrdinarily, such an evocative statement would lend itself towards being ambiguous, if not apocalyptic (as O'Brien also assumed[51]). However, this is the motto that I reserve as being parallel with the equally evocative statement from among the Pre-1590 mottos: Enemy expelled. As was the case with Pope Lucius II, this motto is meant to be a pun off of the Pope's name in some way. This is the third and final time that the word religiones appears, and further evidence that it must refer to a personal name. However,"
