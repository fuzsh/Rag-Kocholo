        "text": "Italian-Argentinian Jorge Mario Bergoglio becomes Pope Francis I\n\nArgentinian cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio became the first ever pope from the Americas in the history of the Catholic Christian Church, taking the papal name of Francis I\n\nIANS\n\nVATICAN CITY- Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio from Argentina was Wednesday night elected the Catholic Church’s the 266th Pope. He is first Latin American to be pontiff, and will call himself Francis I.\n\nAfter his election, the 76-year-old Pope appeared on a balcony and greeted crowds in St. Peter’s Square, BBC reported. He was the archbishop of Buenos Aires.\n\nHe asked the faithful to pray for him. Cheers erupted as he gave a blessing.\n\nEarlier, white smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney announced the new Pope’s election. Crowds in St. Peter’s Square cheered and bells rang out as the smoke appeared.\n\nPope Francis replaces Benedict XVI, who resigned Feb 28 at the age of 85, saying he was not strong enough to lead the Church.\n\nHe is the first Jesuit to become pope.\n\nA member of the Jesuits and ordained in 1936 after four years as priest, Bergoglio became head of all the Jesuits in Argentina, Xinhua reported.\n\nAfter studying in Germany, he became bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992 and archbishop in 1998. A strong supporter of helping the poor, Bergoglio was made cardinal in 2001.\n\nThe 115 cardinals have been in isolation since Tuesday, and held four inconclusive votes.\n\nAt least 77 of them, or two-thirds, would have had to vote for a single candidate for him to be elected Pope.\n\nCrowds with umbrellas gathered in the square waving flags from around the world.\n\nThe Catholic News Agency said people were running through the streets of Rome, hoping to reach St. Peter’s Square in time for the appearance of the new Pope.\n\n“It’s so emotional. We thought we were going home and the smoke was going to be black,” one Catholic told the BBC. “We’re so touched. It was really incredible.”\n\n__________________________________\n\nArgentina\n\nArgentina is a country that has a population that is 97% white European. The country is only 3% mestizo (mixed white and Amerindian ancestry), Amerindian, or other non-white groups.\n\nPopulation: 42,192,494 (July 2012 est.) 25 million are of Italian European descent\n\n______________________________________________\n\nThe Pope is still an Italian. Is this really a break from the Catholic tradition of Popes?\n\nJorge Mario Bergoglio is the son of Italian immigrants Mario Jose Bergoglio and Regina Maria Sivori\n\nThe Washington Post reports\n\n….the first Latin American pope also represents a cultural bridge between two worlds — the son of Italian immigrants in a country regarded by some as the New World colony Italy never had. For many Italians, his heritage makes him the next best thing to the return of an Italian pope.\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/world/jorge-mario-bergoglio-the-first-jesuit-pope-known-for-pastoral-work/2013/03/13/8a47e324-8c0b-11e2-9f54-f3fdd70acad2_story.html\n\n…..The College of Cardinals picked the first non-European in modern times, as well — yet he is the son of Italian immigrants and grew up in Argentina, perhaps the most European of any country in Latin America.\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/bergoglio-a-pope-of-paradox-for-a-church-in-transition/2013/03/13/54a5b326-8c3e-11e2-adca-74ab31da3399_story.html\n\n_________________________________\n\nItalian-Argentinians\n\nIn the hundred years between 1830 and 1930, 60,000,000 men, women, and children left Europe, and 40,000,000 of them cast off forever the ties of home, family and fatherland.\n\nAs in North America, the migration to South America originated mainly in Europe. This is outside of the force migration of enslaved Africans to the Americans.\n\nWith themselves the Europeans brought their Christian religion, their languages and their customs. However many of the immigrants to North America came from Northern Europe bringing with them the influence of their Christian Protestant religion and culture.\n\nIn Latin America, instead, the majority of immigrants came from Southern Europe, and therefore the predominant religious influence has been Christian Roman Catholic, rather than Christian Protestant. The languages of these new immigrants were Spanish and Portuguese, and the basic political institutions, Mediterranean rather than English.\n\nAn important factor in the assimilation of the Europeans in South America, has been that the ancient native culture and native population of the south proved far stronger than those native forces in the northern part of the Americas and this led in Mexico and in the southern hemisphere to more of a blending of people and cultures, whereas in both Canada and the United States the European heritage was overwhelming. The size of the enslaved African population in central and southern America were also larger than in the north.\n\nHowever it was not until 1870, about 50 years after independence, that a really open immigration policy began in the Latin American countries. This open immigration brought millions of Europeans to South America, changing the population from 23,163,000 in 1850, to 231,070,000 in 1980. This overwhelming increase in numbers was caused by the natural growth of the population, but also by the large numbers of immigrants that were attracted to South America. Many of theses millions emigrated to Argentina.\n\nThe first recorded visit by Europeans to Argentina can be dated to 1516, when Juan Diaz de Solis entered the Rio de la Plata and claimed the territory for Spain. This exploration, however, was not successful because of the confrontation with the Amerindians, where de Solis and most of his men were killed. Finally in 1580, Juan de Garay, established a lasting settlement at Buenos Aires.\n\nBetween 1857 and 1958 the main source of immigrants to Argentina were Italy (46%) and Spain )33%) of the total. The rest of the immigrants were made up of different nationalities, including French, German, British, and Irish.\n\nIn the peak period of the world’s oversee migration, 1821-1932, 6 countries absorbed 90% of the total, and among these 6, Argentina ranked 2nd in the number of immigrants, with a total of 6,405,000. The only other Latin American country on the list is Brazil, with 4,431,000. The United States came 1st with about 5 times as many as Argentina.\n\nThe Italians and the Spanish had little adjustment to make in terms of religion, language, or food. These first groups adjusted well, and also influenced the culture of the new country with what they contributed.\n\nSource: South American Immigration: Argentina by Wanda A.
