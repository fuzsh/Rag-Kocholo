        "text": "The Bishops of Rome, the Popes;\n\nthe Patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, Armenia, and the East; Archbishops of Canterbury and Prince Archbishops of Mainz, Trier, Cologne, and Salzburg\n\nOn the map we have the Roman Empire as it was partially restored at the death of Justinian I. The capital, of course, is Constantinople, with the recovered western areas ruled from Ravenna (Italy, the Exarchate of Ravenna) and Carthage (Africa and Spain, the Exarchate of Carthage). The One Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church, Una Sancta Romana Catholica et Apostolica Ecclesia, is governed through the Emperor and the Patriarchs, namely the Patriarchs of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, in that order of precedence.\n\nThe role of the Emperor in governing the Church is now called \"caesaro-papism,\" i.e. an Emperor acting like a Pope. However, the Emperor had exercised his powers since Constantine I, while the familiar powers of the Pope were much later claims and inventions. It is thus much less anarchonistic to characterize the claims of later Popes, not the Emperors, as the \"caesaro-papism,\" i.e. the Pope trying to act like an Emperor.\n\nPart of that act of play-acting a Roman Emperor are actually the famous \"red shoes\" of the Popes. But those are stolen shoes, and nothing like what would have been the shoes (or sandals) of the original \"fisherman,\" i.e. St. Peter. Roman Emperors wore red shoes, not prelates of the Church. The last legitimate red shoes were on Constantine XI on May 29, 1453, as he died defending Constantinople against the Ottoman Turks. The red shoes of the Popes, which recent Popes have begun to avoid, are part of \"caesaro-papism.\"\n\nChief among the powers of the Emperor -- the \"Equal to the Apostles,\" ἰσαπόστολος, isapóstolos, always portrayed with a halo, -- was that of calling Church Councils, as Constantine had called the Council of Nicaea in 325. Indeed, he had already called a Council at Arles in 314 to deal with the Donatist controversy in North Africa, a production carried out, apparently, without any reference to the Bishop of Rome. The first Council called by a Pope, and regarded by him as Ecumenical, was the Lateran Council I in 1123. Orthodox Churches have never recognized any such councils.\n\nTo resolve the Great Schism, the Council of Constance, 1414-1418, was called by the Emperor Sigismund; but once a single line of Popes was secure in Rome again, they denied that the Emperor had any authority to call Councils. The last Emperor in any position, and with any need, to call a Council, Charles V, deferred to the Pope -- who then was the one to call the Council of Trent, 1545-1563. At the time of Justinian, the Pope was regarded as primus inter pares, first among equals of the Patriarchs, but that was all. The Patriarch of Constantinople was made second in rank, although this was a bit resented by the other, older Patriarchates. The Papacy, of course, claims that its full authority and its position as the head of whole Church existed from the beginning; and, indeed, the Popes did begin to make such claims as early as the 5th Century.\n\nThe diagram at right gives some impression of how the One Catholic Church has broken up -- setting aside the Protestant fragmention of the See of Rome in the West, which of course would require a complex diagram in its own right.\n\nThe convention of calling the Latin Church \"Catholic\" and the Eastern Churches \"Orthodox\" obscures the circumstance that katholikḗ, καθολική, \"universal,\" signifies the Church of the Roman Empire, whose Patriarch in Constantinople the Bishop of Rome (through his representative) excommunicated in 1054 AD (although the Pope had just died and the representative no longer had any authority).\n\nThe Greek Church therefore still uses katholikḗ, while the Churches that fell out over one of the Ecumenical Councils, especially the Nestorians and Monophysites, would be heterodox, not \"Orthodox,\" to both the Latin and Greek branches of the Catholica Ecclesia. While the Coptic and Syrian Churches broke away over the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon, there remained a continuous line of Greek Patriarchs in Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, even as the Patriarch of Constantinople proselytized Bulgaria, Russia, and other states in the Balkans.\n\nBeginning with the Crusades, the Church of Rome sought converts over the same territory; and so we see Latin/Catholic churches and counter-churches swarming around the older, Orthodox ones. The counter-churches double up with the existing Orthodox churches, but sometimes a Catholic church exists, e.g. in the Ukraine or Ruthenia, where a separate Orthodox one doesn't. The Popes claim doctrinal authority, while the doctrine of Constantinople is based on the Church Councils.\n\nJust how people can be confused about the history of the Church we see in a statement by film maker Francis Ford Coppola in the director's commentary on his movie, Bram Stoker's Dracula [1991, 2007], as he is watching the stars (Winona Ryder & Keanu Reaves) being married, which was actually filmed at a Greek Orthodox church in Los Angeles:\n\nThe Orthodox religions, Greek Orthodox, Romanian Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, is [sic] in fact the original Christianity and, for my part, I think the most beautiful expression of Christianity -- that Roman Catholicism is Christianity having been fused with the Roman Empire and really I think has more to do with the Roman Empire than it does with Christianity. [transcribed from audio track]\n\nCoppola is apparently unaware that the Orthodox Churches he mentions, Churches in doctrinal agreement with the Patriarch of Constantinople, are the actual direct descendants of the State Religion of the Roman Empire, founded under the authority of the Patriarch and the Emperor in Constantinople (starting with Constantine), while modern Roman Catholicism, far from being Christianity \"fused with the Roman Empire,\" is the religion of the Bishops of Rome who repudiated the authority of the Roman Emperor and excommunicated the Patriarch of Constantinople.\n\nThe religion of the City of Rome detached itself from the religion of the Roman Empire, i.e. Mediaeval Romania, centered in Constantinople. Few people, indeed, remember that Mediaeval \"Romans\" meant the Greek, Albanian, Vlach, Armenian, and other inhabitants of the so-called \"Byzantine\" Empire. The phenomenon that Coppola describes is thus not Christianity being \"fused\" with the Roman Empire, which is actually the way it began -- it was the \"Roman\" religion to one and all -- but Catholicism being corrupted by the attempt of the Popes to assume the authority of Emperors. When the Emperors were strong, whether in Constantinople or in Germany, the ability of the Popes to make good their claims was limited; but in the decline of the power of both Thrones, there was little to restrain them -- until Philip IV of France sent thugs to assault Boniface VIII and henceforth did as he wished.\n\nA different sort of confusion involving the Roman Empire comes from a more scholarly source, the classic study of Delphi by Peter Hoyle [Cassell, London, 1967].\n\nReligion in the Greek world was tolerant, there was no religious persecution... it was through the Romans, the strong and well-organized, the cruel and authoritative power, that Christianity developed and became a state religion. The terrors and massacres, the inquisitions, the persecutions of Christian by Christian, might never have come about if Greece and not Rome had prevailed. [p.7]\n\nVilla of the Mysteries,\n\nVilla dei Misteri, Pompeii\n\nHoyle has apparently forgotten that Socrates was put to death for \"not believing in the gods in whom the city believes, but in other new spiritual [things].\" That looks like some kind of religious persecution, on behalf of the state religion of Athens. Furthermore, the practice of Roman religion as generally tolerant was little different from that of Greece.\n\nWith some exceptions, Christians were not asked to renounce their faith or to desecrate its images, as Christians were in Japan; they were simply asked to honor the traditional gods as well and to demonstrate this by pouring a small libation to them. The subsequent intolerant exclusivism we see, when pagan practice and belief were suppressed, came from the Christians, not from previous Roman traditions.\n\nAnd where then did this Christian exclusivism come from? Clearly from Judaism -- לֹא יִהְיֶה־ לְךִָ אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים עַל־ פָּנָי׃; Οὐκ ἔσονταί σοι θεοὶ ἕτεροι πλὴν ἐμοῦ· Non habebis deos alienos coram me; Thou shalt have no other gods before me [Exodus 20:3] -- but I doubt that Hoyle would have wanted to put in print that the \"terrors and massacres\" were ultimately due to Judaism. I do not want to place all the blame there either, for something that is the most characteristic of Christianity may in fact derive from the Greeks rather than the Jews. We find Sophocles saying:\n\nὡς τρισόλβιοι\n\nκεῖνοι βροτῶν, οἳ ταῦτα δερχθέντες τέλη\n\nμολωσ᾽ ἐς Ἅιδου· τοῖσδε γὰρ μόνοις ἐκεῖ\n\nζῆν ἔστι, τοῖς ἄλλοισι πάντ᾽ ἔχειν κακά.\n\nThrice blessed are those among men who, having seen these rites, go down to Hades; for only to them is there life; to the others there will be all evils [πάντα κακά].\n\n[Fragment 837, \"Fragments Not Assignable to Any Play,\" Sophocles III, Fragments, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press, 1996, 2003, pp.368-369.]\n\nSophocles is talking about the Eleusinian Mysteries, which promised rebirth and eternal life to those who were initiated and denied it to those who were not. There is nothing in Judaism like that -- except in beliefs about the afterlife that developed later, already with some elements in late books of the Bible, and implied by references in the New Testament to the Sadducees rejecting an afterlife, but not the Pharisees -- or the unmentioned Essences.\n\nIn the modern polemic against Christianity, Nietzsche was willing to blame Judaism for the evils of Christianity (the \"slave revolt\" in morals), but then this is little noted in the popular apologetic for Nietzsche's anti-Semitism. Nietzsche was also willing to blame Socrates (that victim of religious persecution) and Plato for corrupting the Greek spirit and making it vulnerable to Judaism and Christianity.\n\nPerhaps Hoyle, consciously or not, tries to avoid this mess by simply placing the blame on the Romans -- the opposite of Nietzsche, who said that the Romans were the most noble people who had ever lived, and that \"Rome viewed Israel as a monstrosity; the Romans regarded the Jews as convicted of hatred against the whole of mankind\" [The Birth of Tragedy and The Genealogy of Morals, translated by Francis Golffing, Doubleday Anchor Books, 1956, p.185-186]. Yet the characteristic attitude of traditional Christianity, that we are saved and you are going to Hell -- Extra Ecclesiam, nemo salvatur (Outside the Church, no one is saved): that looks like something from Hoyle's \"tolerant\" Greeks.\n\nThe Patriarchates, as illustrated at right, consist, as we have seen, originally of the five indigenous to the Roman Empire and, from an early date, that of Armenia and of the East. Schisms multiplied the number of claimants to each Seat, initially between the Roman Church (i.e. the Melkite, Μελχίτης, \"Royal\" -- here what I call \"Ecumenical,\" after the title of the Patriarch of Constantinople) and the Monophysites but later between the Latin and the Greek Churches, with the former claiming, and conventionally conceded, the appellation \"Roman Catholic.\"\n\nHowever, this leaves the \"Orthodox\" Churches as, conventionally, everything else that we see. All of Christendom, indeed, could be divided between Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox Churches, with the Protestants missing from the diagram because there are no Protestant claimants to a Patriarchate at the traditional Seats or any Protestant institution of new Patriarchate. For instance, the Primate of England is still the Archbishop of Canterbury, just as when the country was Catholic. Meanwhile, however, we get other Orthodox Patriarchates, as of Russia, and most recently of Ethiopia. The tendency of the Orthdox Churches to become Patriarchates is that, even when in doctrinal communion with an older Church (as at Constantinople), they are characteristically autocephalous, i.e. self-governing.\n\nIn this period there were five significant centers of Christianity outside what had ever been in the Roman Empire: in the Caucasus, in Mesopotamia, in India, in Ethiopia, and in Ireland. In the Caucasus were the Churches of Georgia and Armenia. Georgia was doctrinally in union with Romania, but Armenia had not accepted the decision of the Fourth Ecumenical Council. The Patriarchate of Armenia was thus regarded by the Roman Church as heterodox. Similarly heterodox was the Patriarchate of the East, seated at the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, which had not accepted the decision of the Third Ecumenical Council -- and thus is often called the \"Nestorian\" Church, after the doctrine condemned by the Third Council. The authority of the Patriarch of the East already extended to Christians in India, and subsequently would reach all the way to China.\n\nEthiopia was under the authority of the Patriarch of Alexandria and so, until the Fourth Ecumenical Council, was doctrinally in union with Rome -- later it would continue to follow the lead of the Coptic Church, and now has had its own autonomous Patriarchate just since 1959. That leaves Ireland, which traditionally was converted by St. Patrick after 432 AD. As communication between Ireland and the Empire became more tenuous, the Irish Church preserved literacy, as Britain itself fell out of history, and developed some of its own traditions -- though these never came to serious heterodoxy and any differences were subsequently straightened out. As Irish nationalism later became identified with the Catholic Church, over and against the Protestant Church of England and British rule in Ireland, Ireland became one of the most staunchly Catholic states in Europe -- and today, with Poland, provides a disproportionate number of priests to the Catholic Church. However, Catholic observance in both Ireland and Poland recently has declined.\n\nPatriarchal Index\n\nIntroduction Bishops of Rome and Popes\n\nPilgrimage Churches in Rome Kenneth Clark's Big Room Latin Rite and Uniate Patriarchates Numbering of the Popes The Legend of Pope Joan The Popes and Fascism John Paul and Francis The Anti-Capitalist Statement of Pope Francis Critique of Roman Catholic Ethics Patriarchs of Aquileia, Grado, and Venice Archbishops of Ravenna Archbishops of Canterbury Archbishops of Milan Archbishop-Electors of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne Prince-Bishops of Liège Archbishops of Salzburg Bishops and Patriarchs of Goa, the West Indies, & the East Indies Patriarchs of Lisbon\n\nPatriarchs of Constantinople\n\nPrimates of Russia, Metropolitans & Patriarchs of Kiev & Moscow Latin Patriarchs of Constantinople Armenian Patriarchs of Constantinople The See of Athens\n\nCoptic Patriarchs of Alexandria\n\nMelkite Patriarchs of Alexandria Latin Patriarchs of Alexandria Coptic Catholic Patriarchs of Alexandria Patriarchs of Ethiopia\n\nPatriarchs of Antioch\n\nSyrian Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch John of Damascus Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch, Jerusalem, & Alexandria Maronite Patriarchs of Lebanon Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch Latin Patriarchs of Antioch\n\nPatriarchs of Jerusalem\n\nArmenian Patriarchs of Jerusalem Got Temple?

There are likely to be few neutral opinions about it. To Roman Catholics, the Pope may be the holiest man on earth, the heir and keeper of the deepest truths of religion. To others, the Papacy may only stand for ignorance and dogma, intolerance, torture, arrogance, and bigotry. Purely historical judgments, which cannot take into account religious truth or falsehood, may nevertheless leave a negative impression because of the factual nature of things like torture and intolerance. One would like, therefore, as a historian (or philosopher) to ask, \"What good was the Papacy?\"\n\nThere is one very good answer in that respect: By claiming independent authority and resisting secular power, the Papacy paved the way for the later conception of the separation of Church and State. Not that the Church ever wanted to give up its authority over the conscience and morals of citizens, but it accustomed people to the idea that secular power was not the last word and that obedience to the same was not an unconditioned duty. Once the Church was divided by the Reformation, and Protestants found even their own sects multiplying, the easiest solution was, not only to keep secular authority separate, but to deny to churches any coercive function. Thus, while Catholic countries often still mix some religious authority into secular law, the separation of religion from the state, or the principle of liberty of conscience, is a far, far less secure proposition out of the Western world. When China prohibits an inoffensive religious sect, and various countries debate whether to institute Islāmic Law (or apply it in all its rigor), the long struggles between Popes and Emperors, or Popes and Kings, look positively remarkable.\n\nSt. Peter's Basilica, Rome, 2019\n\nAs with many people who look good out of power, for their resistance, but then prove as bad, or worse, as their tormentors once they are in power themselves, our appreciation of the Papacy has its limits. The Popes always looked better resisting than ruling. This has peristed into recent times, when the Church was the focus of undeniable opposition to communism in Poland, but then, again, sought to introduce Catholic moral teachings into the law of post-communist Poland. The irony of this dynamic is palpable when communism itself came to power in the name of the workers but then often slaughtered workers to stay in power.\n\nThus, one might well say, \"OK, it was a worthy role to distinguish and limit the power of secular governments, but since then the Church has been more famous for its intolerance, for the Inquisition, for its authoritarianism. What has it done for us, outside of the Warsaw Pact, lately?\" Indeed, if a Mediaeval or Cold War historical role is the best we can do, then perhaps the demise of the Church is long overdue. At the same time, the Church is no longer running any Inquisitions, and priests and nuns have often become activists in trendy political causes -- unfortunately sometimes poisonous leftist causes, as in \"Liberation Theology.\"\n\nThe Baldachin (Baldacchino), bronze altar canopy, of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter's Basilica, Rome, 2019\n\nHowever, that kind of thing may be of less value than the continued conservative moral teaching of the Church. If the Catholic Church is not going to stand for conservative morality, who is? The principle lesson of traditional morality is self-control. If the Church argues that abortion and birth control are not necessary (apart from its moral objections) for economic success, this is actually true and an argument that should be made. Those who are so imprudent as to find themselves with illegitimate children, even if their fortunes can be retrieved by abortions, may not be prudent in any other areas of life either, to a great loss of fortune which cannot so easily be remedied. The proposition that people should be protected, usually by the government, from any adverse consequences of their own actions is the most destructive moral principle of the modern age, when relativism and nihilism have become the self-evident truths of the intelligentsia. Although the Church may err in the direction of moralism, this is no worse, and probably overall better, than the opposite popular trivializations of morality and prudence. The legendary, fortress-like chastity of Catholic girls, although often ridiculed as unhealthy inhibition, now, especially in the environment of herpes and AIDS, proves to have been the wisest of practical virtues.\n\nOn the other hand, the moral standing of the Church now stands gravely challenged by scandals over priests who take advantage of their positions to sexually prey on children.\n\nThe Holy Spirit, St. Peter's Basilica, Rome, 2019\n\nIn the most scurrilous of anti-Catholic rumor and libel, Catholics were required to provide children to priests for sexual purposes. However innocent of this, the Church put itself in a very false, immoral, and illegal position by often simply transfering priests accused of sexual crimes instead of turning them over to the police. Why the Church would be reluctant to respond appropriately is understandable, since it has been harder and harder, especially outside of Ireland and Poland, to get men to commit to a life of celibacy to become priests. The Church invests a great deal in the education and training of priests and is going to be reluctant to lose them. There is actually nothing new about this. The wish of King Henry II to be rid of Thomas à Becket was not because Becket was protecting the peasants from the oppression of the King, but because he was protecting Churchmen who were rapists and murderers from the King's Justice. Someone might consider staging a version of T.S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral in which the complaint against Becket (or perhaps Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles) was his protection of child molesters. Henry II could use some good press in this, since he hasn't gotten any since the 12th century.\n\nIt can be a problem that the priesthood might tend to attract men who might otherwise be uninterested in marriage, i.e. homosexuals and those sexually attracted to children. In principle, homosexuals are going to be in no worse position than heterosexual priests in that the Church has no objection to anyone being a homosexual, as long as they don't engage in homosexual sex. Since priests are expected to avoid any kind of sex, homosexual priests face temptations in much the same way as heterosexual priests. A priest tempted into homosexual sex may be committing a greater sin than a heterosexual priest, but at least it is not illegal. Child molesting is something else. While homosexual priests as such may not be the problem, conservatives sometimes think it is, since much of the abuse really isn't of children, but of teenage boys. Either way, however, these particular priests don't seem to be able to observe either their vows of celibacy, the Church's teachings on sexuality, or the laws about the age of consent.\n\nThe Pietà, by Michelangelo, St. Peter's Basilica, Rome, 2019\n\nA reasonable solution to all this, since the fundamental problem is the scarcity of parish priests, could be married priests. While priestly celibacy is founded on the text, Matthew 19:12, \"and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it,\" it may be that the particular emphasis on celibacy in the Latin Church developed mainly to prevent priestly offices from becoming hereditary -- a grave danger in the Middle Ages, as seen recently also in Japan, where a married Buddhist clergy has resulted precisely in hereditary succession to Buddhist temples. This not likely to become a danger in the modern Catholic Church, however, and the Church would do well to adopt a somewhat more relaxed policy, as in the Greek Orthodox Church, where married priests are simply disqualified from advancing in the hierarchy. On the other hand, the horror or contempt of modern Protestants and secularists for celibacy in general is a bias that is inconsistent both with the history of Christianity, where celibacy is respected or required in all the Orthodox Churches, and in relation to the practice of religion in, say, India, where there is provision and an esteemed place for celibacy in all the autochthonous religions, Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. After all, the great power of the noble hero Bhishma, , of the Mahābhārata, who could not be killed against his wish, and his name, derives from the \"frightful\" oath of celibacy he took. Western enthusiasts for Buddhism as a system of philosophy tend to be oblivious of the place of the Sangha, the monastic community, in the doctrine and history of Buddhism.\n\nAnti-Popes are shown in brackets. Alternative numbers or numbers that do not count in the following sequence are in parentheses. Several Anti-Popes (e.g. Alexander V) actually figure in the count of legitimate Popes. Popes and Anti-Popes in the Great Schism at Avignon are shown with backgrounds in purple. Anti-Popes at Pisa are on a background in green. Sedē Vacantē is \"with the Seat Vacant.\"\n\nThe Popes may be viewed in frames in conjunction with the Emperors of the Roman-Romanian-Byzantine lines and Popes of the Frankish-German-French-Austrian lines, using this link. In a screen 640 pixels wide, the formatting suffers considerable distortions. In a wider screen, the window should be enlarged or maximized. To exit the frames, links from this \"Popes\" window must be used. This device of running Popes and Emperors in parallel goes back to The Holy Roman Empire of James Bryce [1904, Schocken Books, 1961, 1964]. Because the Popes played a larger role in the story of the Emperors in Francia, Bryce ceased listing the Roman Emperors once Charlemagne had been crowned. Also, this shift probably also expresses the lack of regard of historians like Bryce for \"Byzantium\" and its heritage. See the \"Note on 'Romania'.\"\n\nThe mythic beginning of the Papacy with St. Peter may not be quite as mythic as Protestants like to suppose. St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican is built over a 1st century Christian cemetery. Rebuilt over time, ever since the first version built by Constantine, the altar turns out always to have been over a particular grave, with its own humble monument, of a man whose bones date from the correct era. This may or may not really be Peter, but the antiquity of bones and tomb rule out the kind of crude mediaeval fraud that the sceptic might suppose.\n\nSince St. Peter's and the Papacy really are so old, the opposite temptation, from the one of priestly fictions, is that the Popes know far more about history than anyone suspects. One favorite notion, which may or may not have originated in the novel Another Roadside Attraction by Tom Robbins, is that the Vatican possesses the actual body of Jesus Christ. Since Christ is supposed to have risen from the dead and ascended to heaven, his body would be, to say the least, an embarrassment. But when one wonders whether these few bones are actually St. Peter, the intact mummy of Jesus seems rather less credible.\n\nBasilica Papale di Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, 2019\n\nAnother conceit, apparently taken seriously by the 1999 movie Stigmata, is that the Vatican possesses texts of the Gospels, even in Aramaic (surviving Gospels are in Greek), which contradict various points of Catholic doctrine, like the existence of the Church. Stigmata, however, very much, perhaps inadvertently, overstates its case, since the sayings of Jesus it treasures as directed against the (not yet existing) Catholic Church could, at the time, have had no possible object other than the Temple of Herod in Jerusalem. The viewer of the movie, taking into account the historical context in which Jesus spoke, might therefore take it as an anti-Semitic rather than just an anti-Catholic screed.\n\nThe antiquity of the Papacy is perhaps often forgotten when it comes to the monuments of Rome. The mediaeval Popes did not live in the Vatican, but in the Lateran Palace, which had been seized from its private owners by, of all people, the Emperor Nero. Constantine then donated it to the Bishop of Rome and built adjacent to it the church of St. John Lateran, which has remained ever since the actual episcopal church, the cathedral, of Rome (not St. Peter's). Most of the mediaeval Church councils in Rome are thus \"Lateran\" Councils, held at the Pope's residence (as the last two Councils have been \"Vatican\" Councils). Later, while the Popes were in Avignon, the Palace burned twice, in 1307 and 1361. Although the Palace was rebuilt, when the Popes returned, they never lived there again, settling at Santa Maria in Trastevere, then at Santa Maria Maggiore (also ancient; built in 432), and finally, as we all know, at the Vatican. However, Gregory XIII began to build the Quirinal Palace as a summer residence, regarding the higher ground of the Quirinal Hill as healthier in the hot season. Soon afterwards, under Clement VIII, and before the present building was finished, this became the principal residence of the Popes. It continued as such until 1870, and has since then been the official (if not the actual) residence of both the Kings and the Presidents of Italy. The Popes retreated back to the Vatican and the Vatican Palace. What was left of the ancient Lateran Palace was removed by Sixtus V, who then built the smaller existing building.\n\nKenneth Clark's Big Room\n\nAlthough the Pope had been the de facto governor of Rome for a few years, the Donation of Pepin in 754 begins the formal history of the Papacy as a territorial power. This would last until 1870, giving the Papal States a run of 1116 years. The original terms of the grant were for the \"Exarchate of Ravenna,\" i.e. the Roman Imperial territory that was preserved across central Italy after the invasion of Lombards in 568. The most important parts of this were, of course, Rome itself and the area of Romagna around Ravenna in the north, with a narrow salient connecting them. While the Donation was made on paper in 754, Pepin was not able to deliver practical control of the territory to the Pope until 756, which thus is taken by many as the effective beginning of the Papal States.\n\nThe ability of the Popes to control the outlying territories, or even Rome itself, was, however, very uneven. Rome was often under the control of turbulent local aristocrats, and one reason for the Papal relocation to Avignon was to escape them. After the return of the Popes to Rome, it was some time before the territorial fortunes could be restored. The son of Alexander VI, Cesare Borgia, then conquered Romagna. This was for his own benefit; but the deaths of him and his (reputed) father (who was perhaps trying to poison someone else) and the accession of the warrior Pope Julius II resulted in its being secured for the Papacy. Avignon was still a Papal possession, and there were some outlying holdings in Italy, like Benevento. This arrangement was then fairly stable until the French Revolution, when Avignon was lost, the Papal States temporarily annexed, and the Pope himself eventually imprisoned by Napoleon. The restorations of 1815 returned the Papal Italian territories, until the period of the unification of Italy, 1859-1870. This formally ended the political independence of the Papacy until the Concordat with Mussolini in 1929 recognized the sovereignty of the Vatican City.\n\nThe Donation of Pepin and the subsequent crowning of Charlemagne as Roman Emperor gave the Popes ideas. A document was manufactured, the \"Donation of Constantine,\" whereby secular authority over the entire Western Roman Empire had been given to the Pope by Constantine the Great. This became the basis of Mediaeval Papal claims of authority over all secular rulers in Francia. Papal claims were occasionally enforced with some success, against the Emperors and even against the Kings of France and England; but they came to a bad end when Boniface VIII had to face the ruthlessness of King Philip IV of France.\n\nThe Donation of Constantine, 1247, San Silvestro Chapel at Santi Quattro Coronati, Rome The Donation of Constantine, Papal Apartments, the Vatican, Rome, 2019 The \"Donation\" discredited as a forgery by Lorenzo Valla (1407-1457), 14391440, because the language could be dated as Mediaeval, not 4th Century AD\n\nThe subsequent Babylonian Captivity and Great Schism, not to mention the Reformation and the exposure of the Donation of Constantine as a forgery, put the Papacy at such disadvantages that it never again had as much leverage as before over secular rulers.\n\nThe Frankish Kingdom as the Roman Empire petered out (as it were) after a while, and the Pope granted the Imperial Crown for a few years to local Kings of Italy. This also lapsed. The institution got revived, for the rest of the Middle Ages, when the successful German King Otto I descended on Italy. This began a long struggle between the German Emperors and the Popes for control of Italy and control of the Church in Germany. The successes of the Popes crippled the authority of the German Throne, and ensured that Germany and Italy would enter the Modern period fragmented and anarchic. The political consequences even in the 20th century were severe, as the political immaturity of Germany and Italy rendered them vulnerable to ideologies like Fascism and Nazism. Italy remained tempted by Communism until its fall in 1989/91. The war and mass murder effected by the former temptations echo in the terrorism practiced by the die-hard believers of the latter, even after the Fall of Communism.\n\nIn the 10th and 11th centuries, we have a situation that looks like that under the Renaissance Popes of the Borgias, Della Roveres, and Medici, as we will see below. A family of Roman nobility, the Tusculani, in league with the Dukes of Spoleto, founds a virtual dynasty of Popes. The final score is eight Popes by marriage or descent, which is much better than any of the Renaissance families could boast of. The Tusculani, whose first member here is Theophylact, may have been, with such a Greek name, derived from a military family installed when Rome was ruled from Constantinople, or from a comparable family from Southern Italy. The period involves intense interaction with the German Emperors, with Otto I crowned by John XII in 962. This John may also have been the first Pope to adopt a new name as Pope, having previously been known as Octavian. Soon this becomes customary. At the same time, with the report that John XI was the natural son of Sergius III and Marozia of Tusculum, there is the kind of reputation about the Papacy, as a \"pornocracy,\" that we later get again with the Borgias.\n\nAlthough the Church of the Pope is called by one and all the \"Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church\" (Sancta Romana Catholica et Apostolica Ecclesia), and this is contrasted, not just with Protestant churches, but with the Orthodox Churches of the East, Greek, Coptic, Syriac, Armenian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Serbian, etc., this has been no more than a very clever usurpation. The \"Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church\" was the Universal (katholikos) Church of the Roman Empire. The Pope was not the ruler of that Church, but one of the Ecumenical Patriarchs, along with the Patriarchs of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople. The Pope was allowed to be primus inter pares, \"first among equals,\" but that was it. Governance of the Church was also shared with the Emperor, the \"Equal of the Apostles,\" who had the authority to call Church Councils; and, after 476, that meant only the Emperor in Constantinople -- although, as it happened, only that Emperor had ever called Councils. After various disputes, the Latin and Greek Churches finally broke in 1054. Each thus claimed to be the proper \"Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church,\" but over time the Papal use of the terminology seems curiously to have been conceded by the East. \"Eastern Orthodox\" is not particularly insulting, but it is a surrender. Even the expression \"Greek Catholic\" is used for the Roman Catholic counter-church that was created to lure the Greek Orthodox into allegiance to Rome.\n\nThe Schism between Greek and Latin Churches came at a very bad time for the Greeks. Defeat by the Turks and the loss of Asia Minor deprived Romania of more than half its territory. This was a catastrophe, and actually the Empire never recovered. The Emperor Alexius Comnenus appealed to the West for help. He had no idea what this would set off. Pope Urban II got the idea to call for a \"Crusade,\" a great Christian army, not just to help the Greeks, but to go on and reconquer Jerusalem. This is what happened. The First Crusade defeated the Turks badly enough that Romania was able to recover considerable territory, but then it went on and obtained the great goal of Jerusalem, which had been in Islāmic hands for 463 years.\n\nLater Crusades were the result of setbacks, like the fall of Edessa in 1144 and, much worse, the loss of Jerusalem in 1187. The Popes began to labor constantly to put together forces that could recover the Christian position in Outremer. The Third Crusade was the most powerful and direct, led by the heroic Richard the Lionheart of England, but it fell short. Much, much worse was the Fourth Crusade, which was redirected by the Doge of Venice, Enrico Dandolo, to the purposes of Venice. Pope Innocent III first had to excommunicate everyone for the use of the army in Dalmatia, and then the Venetians took it, not to Palestine, but to Constantinople. This could be seen as undoing the Schism between the Chruches, since now there was a Latin Emperor and Latin Patriarch in Romania, but it didn't accomplish the real purpose. Nor did it last long. Innocent also sanctioned the appalling Albigensian Crusade which precipitated massacre and cultural devastation in the South of France. Nevertheless, he also accepted the legitimancy of the new mendicant preachers, like the charismatic St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) and St. Dominic (1170-1221), the founders of the Franciscan and Dominican Orders.\n\nLater Popes had to contend with an excommunicated Emperor, Frederick II, regaining Jerusalem by negotiation (Fifth Crusade), and then with St. Louis of France getting himself captured in Egypt (Sixth Crusade) and then dying in Tunisia (Seventh Crusade). That was about it.\n\nWhile the last glimmers of the Holy Land were fading, the self-importance of the Papacy was expanding. Boniface VIII went the furtherest with this. The Popes were essentially going to be rulers of the world, deposing and enthroning rulers as they wished. These were naive and dangerous pretentions given some of the rulers that the Pope would have to deal with. The Emperor Henry IV might have been willing to stand in the snow as a penitant, but King Philip IV of France sent one of his agents, Nogaret, to do something about the Pope. With a gang of mercenaries, Nogaret seized Boniface in his summer palace at Anagni, holding him hostage and sacking the place. By one account, they intented to take him back to France for trial but then were driven off, and Boniface rescued, by the local citizens. On another account, they thought it impractical to move Boniface and simply left him without further harm. But they had broken his spirit, and he died weeks later.\n\nIn short order, a French Pope was elected, Clement V, who may actually have meant well but who ended up as a dupe and tool of Philip. Clement settled at Avignon, where the Papal Court then resided until 1377 -- later called the \"Babylonian Captivity\" of the Papacy. Clement was helpless against Philip's schemes, like the destruction of the Templars, even though the Crusading Order was under the direct authority of the Pope and was theoretically immune to French sovereignty. That didn't help them, and Philip ended up burning the Grand Master, without so much as notifying Clement beforehand. Subsequently, all of Europe saw the Papacy as an instrument of French policy.\n\nPopes at Avignon during Great Schism A [Clement (VII)\n\nRobert of Geneva]1378-1394 A [Benedict (XIII)\n\nPetro de Luna]1394-1417\n\nd.1423 1414-1418 Council of Constance, called by Emperor Sigismund, Papal interregnum 1415-1417 A [Clement (VIII)\n\nGil Sanchez Muñoz]1423-1429,\n\nd.1446 A [Benedict (XIV)\n\nBernard Garnier]1425-?\n\nin Armagnac\n\nFinally, the Babylonian Captivity was ended when a French Pope, Gregory XI, returned to Rome, but not without great trouble wading in to Italian politics. When he died a new Pope was elected in Rome, but another was soon also elected at Avignon. This resulted in two Papacies, the \"Great Schism,\" and the states of Francia lined up on one side or another. As with the Northern Emperors in Japan, the Popes at Avignon during the Schism are now considered Anti-Popes and not numbered in the succession.\n\n1409 Council of Pisa, adds third Pope at Pisa P [Alexander V\n\nPietro Philarghi]1409-1410 P [John (XXIII)\n\nBaldassare Cossa]1410-1415\n\nd.1419\n\nThis awkward and mortifying division of Catholic Christendom eventually moved many to find a solution. A Council at Pisa in 1409 elected a new Pope, but then the two old ones refused to resign. So the Great Schism now divided Europe in three, rather than just two. Even worse, the second Pope at Pisa, John XXIII, behaved so disgracefully that no legitimacy was left for the Pisa line, and no Pope would again take the name \"John\" for five hundred years, until 1958 -- then we get another John XXIII because the first was considered an anti-Pope and his number discounted.\n\nFinally, a General Church Council was called at Constance by the Emperor Sigismund. All three Popes were asked to resign. They did, and the Schism was resolved with the election of a new Pope, Martin V. Although Benedict XIII at Avignon resigned, two more \"Avignon\" Popes were elected, though they were not in possession of the Papal city. The principle that Church Councils might be called by the Emperor and rule on matters of Church doctrine and discipline, although affirmed by Constance, was soon repudiated by Martin. The next Emperor who wanted to call a Council, and who had the power to do so, Charles V, nevertheless deferred to the claims of the Papacy (even though his army sacked Rome in 1527, driving out the hostile Clement VII).\n\nNo sooner was the Papacy out of all this trouble, however, that it got into new problems. The Popes became wealthy Renaissance Princes. Alexander VI Borgia became one of the most infamous Popes ever, with rumors of incest as well as murder dogging him. It has long been accepted that he produced multiple illegitimate children, like Cesare and Lucretia (Lucrezia) Borgia, kept Giulia Farnese as a mistress, and was so busy poisoning his enemies that it has long been thought that he accidentally poisoned himself and Cesare.\n\nThis traditional view has now been forcefully disputed by G.J. Meyer in The Borgias, The Hidden History [Bantam, 2013]. Meyer finds the evidence that Alexander had any illegitimate children, or had any mistresses, unconvincing. Cesare and his siblings seem to have been born in Spain at the time when Rodrigo Borja was already a Cardinal living in Rome. The children may in fact have great-nephews and nieces, as indeed they were often identified in contemporary accounts. That such relatives would have been brought to Rome, especially after their father died, was not unusual at the time.\n\nThe greatest practitioners of using the Papacy to house and promote their family were actually Alexander's greatest enemies, the della Roveres. The documentation for Meyer's case, however, has long existed. It was meticulously collected by Peter De Roo and published in 1924 as Material for a History of Pope Alexander VI, His Relatives and His Times. This was \"material for\" rather than an actual history because De Roo was already 84 years old when the five volume work was published.\n\nSuch a monument of Renaissance historiography, however, has been so neglected that when Meyer examined the copy held by the Bodleian Library at Oxford in 2010, the pages had not yet been cut -- 86 years after their printing. I had noticed that other historians were already walking back some of the accusations against the Borgias, for instance that Alexander seems to have been a victim of disease, not poisoning, from which Cesare himself recovered, later to die in battle (involved in the affairs of his Navarrese in-laws).\n\nThe effort to blacken the reputations of the Borgias seems to have been launched by political enemies, especially from della Roveres such as Pope Julius II, later happily piled on by Protestants, looking for any iniquities in Rome.\n\nThe following tables contain some genealogy of the Borgias and the della Roveres. More della Rovere genealogy is given under the rulers of Urbino. Popes from a similiar family, the Medici, are featured in the genealogy of the Medici given with the rulers of Tuscany. Originally Spanish (Borja), Alexander VI's descendants through his nephew Juan returned to Spain and multiplied. Indeed, much of the resentment of the Borgias was that they were Spanish, not Italian.\n\nShowtime ran a series on the Borgias [2011-2013], which, however, not only accepted all the prurient details of the traditional narrative, but was heavily fictionalized in other and easily discovered ways. Further comment on this can be found under the Aragonese Kings of Naples. The series badly misrepresents the fate of King Ferdinand II, whose brother was the second husband of Lucretia Borgia and whose sister was the wife of Goffredo (a person ignored in the series).\n\nLucretia's first husband was Giovanni Sforza, from a collateral line of the Sforza's of Milan. I had some difficulty running down his descent, which was not shown in my usual sources but was not a problem to find at Wikipedia. Giovanni, however, although his marriage to Lucretia was indeed annulled for impotence, was not murdered by Cesare as in the television series. On the other hand, Cesare may have murdered Lucretia's second husband, Alfonso of Aragon and Naples, apparently in her presence. Lucretia's third, final, and apparently happy marriage was to the Duke of Modena. In memory and propaganda, however, Lucetia is presented as the equivalent of Messalina, the promiscuous (to say the least) wife of the Emperor Claudius.\n\nThe series followed in some detail the doings of Giuliano della Rovere, but without tipping us off that he will become Pope Julius II or cluing us in that his own position at Rome was due to the nepotism of his uncle, Pope Sixtus IV. Julius did not become the target of personal smears, such as he promoted against Alexander VI, but his opposition to the Borgias was purely political and personal, without any disinterested justification.\n\nLeo X, the first of the Medici Popes, under whom the Protestant Reformation began, is supposed to have said, \"God has given us the Papacy, so we might as well enjoy it.\" He dismissed Martin Luther as \"some drunken German,\" but Luther's movement not only shook Francia, it shattered it. A division something like the Great Schism happened again, but this time is not was not over who would be Pope, but whether there would be a Pope at all.\n\nThe political divisions of the Reformation were only settled by war. The Dutch revolted against Spain (1568), and as the Spanish kept trying to defeat them, the Emperor moved to suppress heresy in Bohemia (1618). After Imperial forces secured Bohemia and advanced in Germany, France began to subsidize opposition. This brought Sweden into the war; and after Swedish fortunes faded, France, a Catholic state, entered the war against the Catholic side. Spanish power was permanently broken, and the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 secured Dutch (and Swiss) independence and the Protestant states in Germany. The Pope lost even theoretical and spiritual authority over most of Northern Europe.\n\nIf we ever wanted to know what a Counter-Reformation Pope was like, all we need is the portrait of Innocent X (1644-1655) by Velázquez (from 1649/50). This is often regarded as Velázquez' greatest portrait, and it is perhaps one the greatest in all history -- and the subject of more than one disturbing interpretation by the artist Francis Bacon (1909-1992).\n\nBy the 19th century, Popes were spending much of their energy just trying to maintain their rule over Rome and the Papal States. They were ultimately unsuccessful. A Concordat with Napoleon (1801) meant that the Corsican took a crown from the hands of Pius VII to crown himself Emperor. Later, Napoleon annexed Rome and arrested the Pope for excommunicating him. A few years later, after riding out the troubles of 1848, Napoleon III came to the rescue of the Papacy with French troops who prevented the absorption of Rome into the new Kingdom of Italy.\n\nWhen French troops were withdrawn to fight Prussia in 1870, the Italians rolled into Rome, made it the capital of Italy, and the Pope removed himself to sulk in the Vatican (and proclaim Papal Infallibility at the Vatican I Council). This was the end of the 1116 year history of the Papal States. Pope Pius XI finally settled for a Concordat with Mussolini (1929) that gave him sovereignty over the Vatican City. This left him with nothing to do but worry about religion and morality, which the Popes have largely confined themselves to since -- as most Catholics probably figure that they should. The Pope's Swiss Guard, still in 15th Century costume (at least on ceremonial occasions), remains to remind us of the day when the Pope had armies.\n\nThere are seven traditional Pilgrimage Churches of Rome. Four are \"major\" basilicas, St. Peter's, St. John Lateran, St. Paul's outside the Walls, and Santa Maria Maggiore.\n\nSanta Maria Maggiore was begun in 432, by Pope Sixtus III, reportedly in tribute to the Third Ecumenical Council affirming the status of Mary as the \"Mother of God,\" ἡ Θεοτόκος. Additions to the church now conceal the original 5th century building; but the original structure and original mosaics are evident from the interior.\n\nThe present St. Peter's, of course, is a product of the Renaissance. St. John Lateran is the actual cathedral of Rome, the Seat of the Bishop of Rome, built adjacent to the Lateran Palace, which the Emperor Constantine donated the Pope, probably in 313. The new Church was dedicated by Pope Sylvester I in 324.\n\nThe Lateran Palace was the residence of the Popes until the relocation of the Papacy to Avignon. St. Paul's was originally built under Constantine, but it was expanded into a very large church under Theodosius I.\n\n\"Outside the Walls,\" fuori le Mura, which figures in the names of three of the Pilgrimage Churches, means outside the Aurelian Walls of ancient Rome, built by the Emperor Aurelian, 271-275 AD. The Vatican is also outside the Aurelian Walls, but it is inside the Leonine Walls, built 848-852 AD by Leo IV after the Arab sack of Rome in 846.\n\nThere are three \"minor\" basilicas among the Pilgrimage Churches, Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, St. Lawrence outside the Walls, and St. Sebastian outside the Walls. Santa Croce may be the most interesting of these churches. The site was originally the palace of the mother of the Emperor Constantine, St. Helena. On a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, 326-328, Helena is supposed to have discovered relics of the Crucifixion, including the Cross itself, the Titulus, which held the inscriptions attached to the Cross, and nails used in the Crucifixion. She reportedly ordered the building of the Church of the Holy Selpulchre on the site of her discoveries. St. Lawrence was originally constructed in the 6th century, and St. Sebastian in the 4th. St. Sebastian, on the Old Appian Way, is also called \"at the Catacombs,\" because of the existence of catacombs under the church. However, in 2000, Pope John Paul II replaced St. Sebastian as a Pilgrimage Church with the Sancturary of Our Lady of Divine Love, which was only originally built in 1745.\n\nTo the Popes, they have always been the only Supreme rulers of true One Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church. That the Orthodox Churches do not agree with this is an inconvenience to be dealt with as necessary, but in general it could be ignored, even with some contempt. Given the long subjugation of many Orthodox Churches under Islam and under the Ottomans, and the ability of the Papacy to draw on the wealth and political power of Francia, older Christianity, including even the Patriarch of Constantinople, was at a disadvantage in dealing with the intrusion of Papal authority and influence. Only Russia could be counted on for a fierce Orthodox response from a Great Power.\n\nThus, it long seemed proper to the Papacy that there should be a Latin Patriarch for each of the original four Patriarchates that had split from Rome. The Crusades allowed for Latin Patriarchs to be installed in Antioch, Jerusalem, Constantinople, and Alexandria. The latter was the most tenuous, since Alexandria was never in the hands of Crusaders.\n\nAlso, the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople was no longer welcome there when the city was retaken by the Greeks in 1261. Consequently, the phenomenon developed of titular Latin Patriarchs actually living in Rome. The only such Patriarchate that survives today is the one for Jerusalem, which was reestablished in the city in 1847. The others were simply and finally abolished in 1954/65, as part of an outreach to Orthodoxy, especially to the Patriarch of Constantinople.\n\nApart from the historic Eastern Patriarches, there are also the \"Minor\" Latin Rite Patriarchates that have always been within the jurisdiction of the See of Rome. This began with Aquileia in 557 AD, which had actually split with Rome over the Fifth Ecumenical Council and thus claimed Patriarchal status to assert its independence. The independence didn't last long, but the title survived and indeed passed on to Grado and Venice. In asserting its own primacy, Venice saw to it that its rivals did not continue. Both are now pretty much forgotten, and I expect most people of some small familiarity with history may even think that Aquileia disappeared when sacked by the Huns in 452 AD, rather than continuing as a significant city and a Patriarchal Seat until 1751. The other Minor Pariarchates, of the West Indies, Lisbon, and the East Indies, were all a function of the Portuguese and Spanish colonial Empires. Only the See of the East Indies, at Goa, was ever actually outside of Iberia.\n\nIf the abolition of the Latin Patriarchates was a gesture to Orthodoxy, it was compromised by the existence of the \"Uniate\" Patriarchs. Thus, it became the practice of the Papacy to create \"counter-churches\" to uncooperative Orthdox Churches, retaining the rite and liturgical language of the original Church. To all superficial appearances, the counter-church might not look like a Latin or Catholic church at all. It may only be in matters of doctrine and Papal Supremacy that the new Church differs from the traditional one. Such a Church could be created out of whole cloth, or it often could be established because of a disputed election or some other schism in the local Church. On the other hand, by 1584 the Maronite Church, in the fastness of Mt. Lebanon, as a whole accepted Papal Supremacy. Now I hear that the Church had always been in communion with Rome, but this seems ahistorical both because the early history of the Maronites is very poorly known, because they apparently were Monotheletes, the doctrine of their founder, Maron, and because claims of Papal Supremacy scarcely existed in a credible way in the early Church of the Roman Empire. While the Maronite Patriarch, who has always resided in Lebanon, claims the See of Antioch, two other Uniate Churches, split off from the Syriac Orthodox and (Melkite, Μελχίτης) Antiochian Orthodox, also claim the See of Antioch. There are therefore three Patriarchs of Antioch all in communion with Rome. The Uniate Churches can be recognized because they usually have \"Catholic\" in their name, in contrast to \"Orthodox\" in the name of the traditional Church. \"Uniate\" or \"Uniat\" is sometimes thought to be insulting; but I don't quite get the insult, which, if based on the sort of colonial character of the counter-churches, will be offensive whatever name is picked to characterize the Churches.\n\nOne sees differing numberings of the Popes. Here I have John Paul II as the 263rd Pope. At the time of his death, I began seeing him referred to as the 264th -- with the new Pope Francis identified in the press as the 266th -- but the Catholic Encyclopedia gave John Paul as the 265th (they have now conformed to 264). Part of this uncertainty is that there has been disagreement about which Popes are legitimate. Thus, in this list, Christopher (903) and Benedict X (1058) were formerly counted as Popes, but they are not on the Catholic Encyclopedia list and are characterized as Anti-Popes by The Oxford Dictionary of Popes. On the other hand, Leo VIII (963) and Sylvester III (1045) are now on the Catholic Encyclopedia list but were formerly, at least by some, considered Anti-Popes.\n\nAs it happens, if we switch off between these Popes and Anti-Popes, it still leaves the count the same. So where does the difference come from between the 363 Popes up to John Paul II here and the 365 in the Catholic Encyclopedia? Well, the 365 number in the Encyclopedia list comes from numbering Benedict IX (1032) three times, as the 146th, 148th, and 151st Pope. He was a layman elected by the power of his family, the Counts of Tusculum, following his uncles Benedict VIII (1012) and John XIX (1024). Opposition to his family, to his own secular ways, and by the Emperor, resulted in him being deposed three times, first in favor of Sylvester III (1045), then second in favor of Gregory VI (1045). Gregory, Sylvester, and Benedict were all pushed aside by the Emperor Henry III, who installed Clement II (1046). After Clement's death, Benedict finally returned again, only to be deposed a third time in 1048 by Boniface of Tuscany, who installed the Emperor's candidate, Damasus II (1048).\n\nIt is because of this mess that Benedict, uniquely, like President Grover Cleveland, can be numbered with non-consecutive \"terms\" as Pope. I am not sure this makes as much sense for Popes as for Presidents, however. We are not really dealing with terms of office. If we ask \"How many popes?\" we want to know the number of individuals. So I have dispensed with the extra numberings. Reckoning them into the count, if anyone really wants to do that, does make John Paul II the 265th Pope (given the other judgments about Popes and Anti-Popes).\n\nThe count of John Paul II as 264th and Francis as the 266th Pope comes from using the three reigns for Benedict IX but not counting Stephen II (752), who died after reigning for only three days. Since he was properly elected but was never consecrated, judgment has wavered about whether to count him as a proper Pope. This results in different numberings seen for subsequent Stephens. Here, however, I have included the original Stephen II as a true Pope. The principle now is that someone becomes the Pope the minute he is elected and accepts the position. The consecration, like the coronation of a king, is extra. Edward VIII of England was never crowned, but he became King of England the minute his father, George V, died. This should determine that Stephen II was a proper Pope, regardless of former practices. Even if we discount him, however, I think it is very wrong to renumber the subsequent Stephens. This can create tremendous confusion when dealing with older (mainly pre-1961) histories, which will not have the renumbering. Stephen III was a Pope of great historical significance, and it should be possible to refer to him, or read about him, without confusion. There are several cases where Popes now considered Anti-Popes nevertheless retain their place in the sequence of names. Thus, Boniface VII (974), John XVI (997), Benedict X (1058), and Alexander V (1409) are now all Anti-Popes who nevertheless are figured in the numbering of subsequent Popes of their name. Since Stephen II had a legitimate election, and has never been considered an Anti-Pope by anyone, it is especially inappropiate to create confusion with anyone after him. As it happens, the Catholic Encyclopedia now sensibly follows the practice of keeping the number for Stephen II even though it does not number him as a proper Pope.\n\nThe only other Papal name where we get this kind of confusing renumbering is with \"Felix.\" Felix II (355) was the early Anti-Pope with the name, but the subsequent Felixes, III (or II, 483) and IV (or III, 526), are early and not of great historical significance -- so not much confusion arises. However, the Anti-Pope Felix V (1439), chosen by the Council of Basle, and the last Anti-Pope, is of rather more importance, and appears to always be numbered with the Anti-Pope Felix II in the sequence.\n\nThere actually is no Pope John XX. When John XXI (1276) became Pope, there was some confusion about the numbering of the earlier Johns. Since John XXI styled himself the \"XXI,\" this number has been allowed to stand, even when the confusion has been cleared up. How much more appropriate, then to retain even a discounted Stephen II.\n\nJust what was the confusion in the mind of John XXI? Well, in his day it had become accepted that there was an extra John in the succession, numbered John VIII (855-857), who had turned out to be a woman and consequently was purged from the list of Popes. This was \"Pope Joan\" -- i.e. the feminine of \"John,\" Johanna rather than Johannes in Latin. Since the dates of Leo IV (847-855) and Benedict III (855-858) are rather well attested, it is all but impossible that Joan could have been elected at the traditional date of 855. The legend of Joan, however, was well established in a chronicle of 1265, shortly before John XXI was chosing his name. Another chronicle of that era, by Jean de Mailly, accepted the historicity of Joan, but dated her to 1099. That is an interesting choice of date, since it is in the middle of a long gap of Johns, between John XIX (1024-1032) and John XXI (1276-1277). This would mean that such a Joan would be numbered as \"John XX,\" the very number that is now missing from the succession of Popes.\n\nJoan's inappropriate sex is supposed to have been revealed when she suddenly gave birth while in a procession from St. Peter's to the Lateran. She was immediately killed and buried on the spot, under an inscription that said Petre, Pater Patrum, Papisse Prodito Partum, \"O Peter, Father of Fathers, Betray the Childbirth of the Women Pope.\" In later processions to the Lateran, subsequent Popes are said to have avoided this place, where there was a statue of Joan with her child. Such a practice is actually attested in 1404 by a Welshman, Adam of Usk, who also added that Popes never ride on horseback nearby, as Joan had been doing. The existence of the statue is attested by a German cleric, Theodoric of Niem, in 1414. It is subsequently supposed to have been thrown in the Tiber by the order of Sixtus IV (1471-1484). Since the statue thus appears to have actually existed, within living memory when Martin Luther visited Rome in 1510, one wonders if such a legend grew up just because of the statue -- a remnant of Roman art that in origin had nothing to do with Joan. John Julius Norwich features a sensible discussion, and a whole chapter, on the business in his recent Absolute Monarchs, A History of the Papacy [Random House, 2011]. Even if we wanted to dismiss the matter of the legend as silly, it should remain significant as one explanation why there is no \"John XX.\"\n\nThere is another explanation why there is no \"John XX,\" which is that for a while there was a mistaken belief that there had actually been two Popes numbered as a single \"John XIV.\" When Pedro Julião (Petrus Hispanus) was elected Pope in 1276, he chose to be \"John XXI\" on the understanding that there had actually been twenty \"Johns\" at that point. However, if it was understood that there had been two Popes named \"John XIV,\" it is not clear why a simple renumbering had not been carried out, as we have seen with the renumbering of the Stephens. John XXI's election would have been the appropriate occasion for that; but it did not happen. So perhaps \"John XX\" was thought to have been Pope Joan after all.\n\nMany of the details of the story of Pope Joan were current so early that we find them in the history of the Greek historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles (c.1430-c.1465). Thus, he says that after a Pope is elected:\n\nThey seat him upon a chair with a hole so that his testicles dangle down and can be touched by a man appointed to that duty, and in this way it becomes clear that he is a man. They believe that long ago a woman attained the pontificate at Rome. The uncertainty was due to the fact that almost all men in Italy and the western lands regularly shave their beards. She then became pregnant and, when she went to perform the eucharist, she gave birth to a child during the ceremony in full view of the congregation. It is for this reason, so that they may know for certain and have no doubts, that they do this touching, and the person doing the touching calls out, \"Our lord is a man!\" [The Histories, Volume II, translated by Anthony Kaldellis, Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library, Harvard University Press, 2014, pp.38-39]\n\nHere we do not have quite the same story as related above, since the scene of the birth during the procession is now instead at the performance of a Mass, but we have the detail of the \"pierced chair\" (chaise percée) that is part of the legend, and the test of the new Pope's genitals. Priests of the Orthodox Churches, of course, did not shave, which is why Chalkokondyles mentions that those of the Latin Church do. However, we are certain that at least one Patriarch of Constantinople was a eunuch, Ignatius (847-858, 867-877), a son of the Emperor Michael I Rhangabé, who had been castrated by the Emperor Leo V. We see images of Ignatius without a beard, which means he must have been castrated before puberty. The Orthodox Church displayed mixed feelings about eunuchs but tended not to blame or penalize them if the mutilation was not self-inflicted. But it was accepted that a eunuch could not be Emperor, hence the action of Leo V.\n\nIn much recent writing, Pope Pius XII has been accused of being little better than a Nazi collaborator during World War II -- \"Hitler's Pope,\" in the title of one book. There is one fact that all by itself refutes such charges. When the Germans occupied Rome after the surrender of Italy in 1943 and began rounding up Jews, no less than three thousand Jews found refuge at the Pope's summer residence, Castel Gandolfo (originally built, ironically, by the Roman Emperor Domitian). The Pope's own private apartments became an obstetrics ward. Critics of Pius generally ignore this case, or lamely and incredibly argue that this was done without the Pope's knowledge. That would have been, to say the least, impossible.\n\nBut inferences are not necessary; the testimony and the evidence is abundant that Papal instructions to all were to rescue Jews. For instance, Tibor Branaski, honored by Israel as a \"righteous gentile\" for helping Jews escape Hungary, testifies that he worked with the Papal Nuncio, Angelo Rotta, who showed him letters from Pius with such instructions. Similarly, Angelo Roncalli, the future John XXIII, who had a Papal diplomatic post in İstanbul during the War, supplied immigration and transit papers to Hungarian and Slovakian Jews. In 1957, Israel thanked Roncalli, still a Cardinal, for what he had done. But Roncalli refused to take credit: \"I referred to the Holy See and afterwards I simply carried out the pope's orders.\" In 1955, an Israeli deligation asked Giovanni Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, if he would accept an award for what he had done to rescue Jews. Montini declined, again referring to his instructions from the Pope, and affirming that he had simply done his duty.\n\nThe result of the Church's efforts, and of many other Italians, on their own, was that 80% of Roman Jews and 85% of Italian Jews were saved from the Nazis. But to the \"Hitler's Pope\" crowd, this was apparently in spite of Papal indifference or even collaboration. This is hardly believable. In truth, Pius never approved of the Nazis, spoke out against them, and had no friendly dealings with them [cf. The Myth of Hitler's Pope, How Pope Pius XII Rescued Jews from the Nazis, by Rabbi David G. Dalin, Regnery Publishing, 2005]. The implication of the \"Hitler's Pope\" thesis, that Pius would have met with or had some understanding with Hitler, is all false. Indeed, the attacks sink so low that a photograph is used of Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pius XII, leaving a building guarded by German soldiers, with the implication that this was from a meeting with Hitler. In fact, it was Pacelli, who was a Papal diplomat in Germany, leaving a reception in 1928 for the German President, Paul von Hindenberg. The soldiers were those of the Weimar Republic.\n\nA recent summary of the story is by Michael Burleigh:\n\nHigh level of assimilation, and the low resonance of anti-Semitism also meant that many Italian Jews survived, although it helped that Italy had a dense network of ecclesiastical sanctuaries amenable to the instructions of Pope Pius XII, who, recent research shows, intervened to help the Jews with a familiar clerical combination of kindness that hardly justifies the Communist-inspired attempts to demonize him in the post-war years. While such sanctuary very occasionally involved attempts to convert Jewish children to Christianity, it should be recalled that the Franciscan friars who sheltered two hundred Jews at Assisi actually provided them with kosher meals, which suggests that conversion was not among their priorities. Rather it reflected the religious virtues of charity and hospitality. [Moral Combat, A History of World War II, Harper Press, London, 2010, p.468, bolface added]\n\nWhile Burleigh may be referring to Italian Communists, whose own agenda would be pretty obvious, one wonders about the animus of American or other scholars whose anti-Catholicism may have some other inspirations.\n\nBurleigh's \"recent research\" unfortunately appears to be missing from John Julius Norwich's Absolute Monarchs, A History of the Papacy [Random House, 2011]. Norwich obviously dislikes and disapproves of Pius XII and mentions nothing in the way of mitigating evidence in regard to his actions in World War II. Norwich does cite the deeds of the Hungarian Church and of Angelo Roncalli in rescuing Jews [pp.449 & 454], but then he omits the testimony that these actions were on instructions from the Pope. Instead, we get some examples of anti-Semitic sentiments expressed by Pius, but mainly the case against him, such as we usually see in public discourse, is his silence, his \"contemptible silence\" [p.447], on the matter of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust. Norwich says that to Pius \"even the deportation of Roman Jewry would be a small price to pay\" to avoid a Communist takeover in the place of the Nazis [p.448]. Disregarding the fact that the Church, with many others, saved 80% of Roman Jews, one of the better records in Europe (worse than Denmark or Bulgaria but much better than the Netherlands, where 79% of Jews were deported), one might well ask whether an openly hostile Church would have had a better chance of working to save Jews rather than a Church that was more discreet and may consequently have had a relatively freer hand to work.\n\nSince Confucius, moralists have esteemed deeds before words [Analects 4:24]. I am willing to believe that Pius XII was an unpleasant person, and his actions on behalf of the Jews may even have been grudging and in bad conscience, but if we do judge Pius by actions and not by words (or lack of them), Norwich's treatment is unfair and dishonest. It is Norwich's judgment that I question, not the least because of his expression of conventional anti-Americanisms, e.g. his apparent disapproval of \"American materialism\" in \"the accoutrements of capitalist-consumerist society\" [p.449] and a snide reference to \"Senator Joseph McCarthy's America, where Reds were found under every bed\" [p.451] -- a stale and probably thoughtless recycling of Soviet propaganda that there were no Soviet spies to find and that actual \"Reds\" were just honest liberals and not dissimulating agents of totalitarian dictatorship. No wonder that Norwich seems to have little sympathy for the anti-Communism of Pius XII, or even that of John Paul II. Norwich, like so many modern academics and intellectuals, need to consider why they are still repeating Marxist and Soviet propaganda decades after it has all been exposed and discredited.\n\nOn the other hand, Pius XII cannot be entirely excused from a more complacent attitude towards, if not Nazism in general, then individual Fascists or Nazis in particular. In 1941 he granted an audience to Ante Pavelić, who, after exile in Italy, returned home to head the Nazi puppet state of Croatia -- for a while the state even had a figurehead King from the Italian royal family. Pavelić conducted round ups and massacres against Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, and Communists. Nevertheless, after the War the Church apparently sheltered him in Italy before he fled to South America and found service with Juan Peron. Pavelić was not alone among Catholics who were potential war criminals who found refuge in the Church and passage away from justice.\n\nThis sort of thing, of course, is not to the credit of the Church or the Pope. Indeed, if Pius never had any use for the Nazis, the Church had much less of a problem with Mussolini's Fascism, or that of Franco in Spain (where Pavelić died in 1959) or Salazar in Portugal. That a Fascist like Franco could actually shelter Jews fleeing from Vichi France means that Fascism as such was not necessarily anti-Semitic, but it is troubling that conservatives or nationalists of the time, like Mircea Eliade, nevertheless became attracted to regimes like those of Mussolini or Franco. Then, as now, collectivist and statist politics were all too appealing, both to left and right, and liberal ideals disparaged. Indeed, few would confuse the traditional Papacy with a source of liberal policies or exhortations.\n\nNevertheless, despite a less than perfect record of dealing with Fascists and fugitives, the Church was already on record as opposing the fundamentals of Fascism. Thus, in 1931 (just two years after the Concordat of 1929), Pope Pius XI had issued an encyclical, Non abbiamo bisogno, that condemned Fascism for its \"statolatry,\" a charge on target for far too much of 20th century politics, but certainly especially apt for fascism and communism. The Fascists were accused of trying \"to monopolize completely the young, from their tenderest years up to manhood and womanhood, for the exlcusive advantage of a party and of a regime based on an ideology which clearly resolves iself into a true, a real pagan worship of the State.\" This not only bespeaks the better angels of the Papal nature but is a caution for continuing political traditions, for long under the influence of Hegel, that denigrate the individual and exalt the reality of state and government. Critics of Catholicism should be careful of the statist log in their own eye before practicing their ophthamology on the Papacy. If Pius XII walked back the forthright rhetoric of Pius XI, we may not admire him for this, but, again, we must also weigh the words against the deeds.\n\nIn Mediaeval Europe, as it happens, one place that Jews could always be sure of a secure reception was in Rome. In the Bull Sicut Judaeis (1120), Callistus (Calixtus) II forbid prejudice against the Jews, forbid forced conversion of them, and required that their persons, property, religious observances, and cemeteries be respected and unmolested. This pronouncement was motivated by recent attacks on the Jews as a result of the call for the First Crusade. The Bull was renewed and reaffirmed by Alexander III, Celestine III (1191-1198), Innocent III (1199), Honorius III (1216), Gregory IX (1235), Innocent IV (1246), Alexander IV (1255), Urban IV (1262), Gregory X (1272 & 1274), Nicholas III, Martin IV (1281), Honorius IV (1285-1287), Nicholas IV (1288-92), Clement VI (1348), Urban V (1365), Boniface IX (1389), Martin V (1422), and Nicholas V (1447).\n\nClement VI had reissued the Bull, and one other, in response to widespread belief and violence blaming the Jews for the Black Death (1346-1353). Furthermore, as early as 1247, Innocent IV issued another Papal Bull refuting with learned detail the \"blood libel\" charge against Jews, that they mixed the blood of Christian children with Passover matzos. This refutation was confirmed in 1540. Meanwhile, Jews expelled from Spain in 1492 could find refuge in Rome, where the contemporary Pope, the notorious Alexander VI, had a Jewish personal physician. When the Emperor Maximilian I was about to order that the Talmud be banned, and burned, in Germany for reputed blasphemies against Jesus, Pope Leo X responded by ordering the entire Talmud published at Rome (Popes had previously, at times, agreed to burn, or at least censor, the Talmud). These are the sorts of things that those with an animus for Catholicism or the Papacy don't seem to notice -- and it makes me wonder if the likes of Alexander and Leo were in some ways, like Bill Clinton, not such bad fellows after all. But the Papacy was also not entirely free from the spirit of the times. In 1555 Paul IV issued a spate of hostile regulations against Roman Jews. They were gathered into a ghetto, restricted to one synagogue, limited to certain professions, required to wear yellow hats in public, etc. This was a hostile enough regime that the Jewish population of Rome declined by half under Paul's Papacy. But Paul IV was disliked by the people of Rome, who at his death attacked the headquarters of the Inquisition, destroyed the building, and freed the prisoners. The measures against the Jews, however, like the Spanish \"purity of blood\" laws, continued until the 19th century.\n\nThe name \"John,\" shunned for centuries, has now been born by three of the last six Popes. This was all due to the saintliness and magnanimity of John XXIII. John Paul I wished to honor John and his successor, Paul VI, and then John Paul II wished to honor all three of them. John Paul I's brief reign (little more than a month) moved the Cardinals to elect a relatively young and vigorous Pope. John Paul II, indeed, reigned into the new Millennium. He was the first non-Italian Pope in centuries, and the first Slavic and Polish Pope ever. It was a historic reign indeed, with John Paul playing a large part in the Fall of Communism, but in the 90's he grew gravely frail and ill. Rumors of the gravity of his condition occasionally surfaced. Some even suggested that he abdicate, but this is something that historically Popes had never done (of their own will). Then, on 2 April 2005, John Paul died. Just the previous Sunday, on Easter, he appeared at his window and blessed the crowd, but he was unable to speak. An infection led to a brief critical illness. After what may have been the largest funeral in history, on April 8th, a historic Papal election will soon take place, the first in a quarter of a century.\n\nAlthough Catholicism has declined in much of the secular West, John Paul himself made the Papacy a presence and a player in modern religion, culture, and politics. In the days of Paul VI, this hardly seemed possible. John Paul was able to accomplish it all through a combination of qualities that may be difficult to repeat. Personally, he was outgoing and appealing, giving a personal touch to an office that can easily swallow a Pope in pompous ritual and the trappings of Mediaeval monarchy. John Paul believed in the pastoral vocation of the Pope, and he travelled the world, meeting millions, to carry this out. All the same, he would not compromise Catholic doctrine just to be in tune with modernity. This turned many away from the Faith, even w"
