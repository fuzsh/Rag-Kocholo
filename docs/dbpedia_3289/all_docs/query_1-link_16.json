Maria in Cosmedin, and succeeded Martin IV. Though aged and so crippled that he could not stand alone he displayed remarkable energy as pope. He maintained peace in the states of the Church and friendly relations with Rudolph of Habsburg, and his policy in the Sicilian question was more liberal than that of his predecessor. He showed special favors to the mendicant orders and formally sanctioned the Carmelites and Augustinian Eremites. He was the first pope to employ the great banking houses in northern Italy for the collection of papal dues. He died at Rome and was succeeded by Nicholas IV.\n\nUniversity: University of Paris\n\nRoman Catholic Pope 2-Apr-1285 to 3-Apr-1287\n\nRoman Catholic Cardinal\n\nPapal Inquisition\n\nRisk Factors: Gout\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Pope Honorius IV\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
