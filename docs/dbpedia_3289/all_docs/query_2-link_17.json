        "text": "Chronological List Of Popes Through The Centuries From St. Peter To Present\n\nJump To List of Popes\n\nWhat does Pope Mean?\n\nThe Pope, a term that means \"father\" or \"papa,\" is the Bishop of Rome. This title places him as the leader of the entire Catholic Church, which includes both the Latin Rite and the Eastern Catholic Churches that are in full communion with Rome.\n\nHere's a list of the Pope's official titles:\n\nBishop of Rome\n\nVicar of Jesus Christ\n\nSuccessor of the Prince of the Apostles\n\nSupreme Pontiff of the Universal Church\n\nPrimate of Italy\n\nArchbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province\n\nSovereign of the State of Vatican City\n\nServant of the Servants of God\n\nAmong these, the title \"Vicar of Jesus Christ\" (or the shortened form \"Vicar of Christ\") is significant. It highlights the Pope's role as the supreme leader of the Church on Earth, a role believed to have been given to Saint Peter by Christ. This belief stems from biblical passages, including Christ telling Peter to \"Feed my lambs... Feed my sheep\" (John 21:16-17) and calling Peter the \"rock\" upon which He would build His Church (Matt. 16:18-19).\n\nThe word \"pontiff\" comes from the Latin word \"pontifex,\" which means \"bridge builder.\" \"Pontifex Maximus\" translates to \"the greatest pontiff.\"\n\nWho Has Become Pope?\n\nIn the history of the Church, there have been 266 popes, from St. Peter to Pope Francis. Some popes have also been members of religious orders, such as:\n\n17 Benedictines\n\n6 Augustinians\n\n4 Canons Regular\n\n4 Franciscans\n\n4 Dominicans\n\n2 Conventual Franciscans\n\n2 Cistercians\n\n1 Caldomese\n\n1 Jesuit\n\nList of Popes\n\nFirst To Fifth Centuries\n\nSixth To Tenth Centuries\n\nEleventh To Fifteenth Centuries\n\nSixteenth To Twenty-First Centuries\n\nFirst Century\n\nPontificate Name English - Regnal (Latin) Personal name Place of birth Notes 30 - 64/67 St. Peter\n\nPETRUS Simon Peter, Simeon Kephas, Simon The Rock Bethsaida, Galilea Disciple of Jesus from whom he received the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven, according to Matthew 16:18-19 .
