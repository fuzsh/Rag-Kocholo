They purport to describe each of the Roman Catholic popes (along with a few anti-popes), beginning with Pope Celestine II (elected in 1143) and concluding with the successor of current pope Benedict XVI, a pope described in the prophecy as “Peter the Roman”, whose pontificate will end in the destruction of the city of Rome.\n\nContents\n\n[hide]\n\n1 Provenance\n\n2 Interpretation\n\n3 Popes and corresponding mottos\n\n3.1 Popes and Antipopes 1143–1590\n\n3.2 Popes 1590 to present\n\n4 Recent Popes and the Prophecy\n\n4.1 Pope Benedict XV (Religio depopulata)\n\n4.2 Pope Pius XI (Fides intrepida)\n\n4.3 Pope Pius XII (Pastor angelicus)\n\n4.4 Pope John XXIII (Pastor et nauta)\n\n4.5 Pope Paul VI (Flos florum)\n\n4.6 Pope John Paul I (De medietate lunae)\n\n4.7 Pope John Paul II (De labore solis)\n\n4.8 Pope Benedict XVI (Gloria olivae)\n\n4.9 Petrus Romanus\n\n5 Authenticity and skepticism\n\n5.1 Erroneous claims\n\n6 See also\n\n7 References\n\n7.1 Notes\n\n7.2 Websites\n\n7.3 Books\n\n8 External links\n\n[edit] Provenance\n\nThe prophecy was first published in 1595 by Arnold de Wyon, a Benedictine historian, as part of his book Lignum Vitæ. Wyon attributed the list to Saint Malachy, the 12th‑century bishop of Armagh in Ireland, (now part of Northern Ireland). According to the traditional account, in 1139, Malachy was summoned to Rome by Pope Innocent II. While in Rome, Malachy purportedly experienced a vision of future popes, which he recorded as a sequence of cryptic phrases. This manuscript was then deposited in the Roman Archive, and thereafter forgotten about until its rediscovery in 1590.\n\nOn the other hand, Bernard of Clairvaux‘s biography of Malachy makes no mention of the prophecy, nor is it mentioned in any record prior to its 1595 publication.[1] Some sources, including the most recent editions of the Catholic Encyclopedia, suggest that the prophecy is a late 16th‑century forgery. Some have suggested that it was created by Nostradamus and was credited to Saint Malachy so the purported seer would not be blamed for the destruction of the papacy. Supporters, such as author John Hogue, who wrote a popular book titled The Last Pope about the claims, generally argue that even if the author of the prophecies is uncertain, the predictions are still valid.\n\n[edit] Interpretation\n\nInterpretation of the mottos has generally relied on finding correspondences between the mottos and the popes’ birthplaces, their personal arms, and the events of their pontificates. For example, the first motto, Ex castro Tiberis (From a castle on the Tiber), fits Pope Celestine II‘s birthplace in Città di Castello, on the Tiber.\n\nPope Clement XIII, referred to in the prophecy as Rosa Umbriae, the rose of Umbria, is stated to have used a rose “as his personal emblem” (his coat of arms does not include one, however, nor was he from Umbria nor had any but the most marginal connection with the region, having been briefly pontifical governor of Rieti, at the time part of Umbria). The technique of word play was evident in instances where interpreters find a phrase fitting more than one explanation.\n\nIt is notable that where the interpretation of the prophecy is clear (as is the case for almost all of the Popes prior to 1590), the reference is almost always to some characteristic possessed by the Pope prior to assuming the Papacy—e.g., his birthplace, his arms, his surname, or his cardinal see. However, for more recent Popes, efforts to connect the prophecy with the pope have often focused on the events of his pontificate.\n\nIn recent times, some interpreters of prophetic literature have drawn attention to the prophecies, both because of their success in finding connections between the prophecies and recent popes, and because of the prophecies’ imminent conclusion. Interpretations made before the elections of recent popes have not generally predicted their papacies accurately.\n\n[edit] Popes and corresponding mottos\n\nThis list, adapted from The Prophecies of St. Malachy by Peter Bander, begins its numbering two numbers ahead of the Vatican’s numbering of popes (Benedict XVI is the 265th, not the 267th). The reason for this is unclear (perhaps because of the two purported “anti-popes”).\n\nThe list can be divided into two groups; one of the 74 Popes and Antipopes who reigned prior to the appearance of the Prophecy in 1590, for whom the connection between the motto and the Pope is usually clear. The other is of the 37 Popes who have reigned since 1590, for whom the connection between the motto and the Pope is often strained or totally opaque.\n\n[edit] Popes and Antipopes 1143–1590\n\nThe text on the silver lines below reproduces the original text (including punctuation and orthography) of the 1595 Lignum Vitae, which consisted of three parallel columns for the Popes before 1590. The first column contained the motto, the second the name of the Pope or Antipope to whom it was attached (with occasional errors), and the third an attempted explanation or justification of the name. The original list was unnumbered.\n\nPre-appearance Popes (1143–1590) Pope No. Motto (Translation) Regnal Name (Reign) Name Historical Reference or Explanation Coat of Arms Ex caſtro Tiberis.

This pope released the encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge which condemned Nazi racism and also signed agreements with Fascist Italy which, among other things, gave the Vatican sovereignty, established the pope as head of state, and added 700 million lire to the church coffers.\n\n[edit] Pope Pius XII (Pastor angelicus)\n\nThe motto means “angelic shepherd”. This pope was known to be very mystical, and it was believed that he received visions. His writings added greatly to understanding of Catholic beliefs and church doctrine. During his reign, Pius exercised Papal Infallibility in defining dogma when he issued, on November 1, 1950 an apostolic constitution, Munificentissimus Deus, which defines ex cathedra the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven, on the request of the Heavenly Father. He was declared Venerable in 2009.\n\n[edit] Pope John XXIII (Pastor et nauta)\n\n“Pastor et nauta” translates to “shepherd and sailor”. Prior to his election he was patriarch of Venice, which is a maritime city, famous for its waterways and gondolas.\n\nAccording to Peter Bander in The Prophecies of Malachy, during the conclave which was to elect John XXIII, Cardinal Spellman, evidently having taken Malachy’s forecast that the next pope would be “pastor and mariner” literally, rented a boat, filled it with sheep and sailed up and down the Tiber.\n\nThe anti-pope Pius XIII of the True Catholic Church has also claimed to be “Pastor et nauta”, as their group believes that his last valid predecessor was Pius XII. He has used justifications including his residence in the United States, which is across the Atlantic Ocean from Rome.\n\n[edit] Pope Paul VI (Flos florum)\n\nPope Paul VI, is described in the prophecies as “flos florum” or “flower of flowers”. His personal arms bore three fleurs-de-lis, the heraldic charge best known as that in the arms of the French monarchy. Fleur-de-lis literally means “flower of the lily”: yet the medieval flower par excellence was the rose[citation needed], not the lily; and many popes have borne various flowers in their arms.\n\nThe fleur-de-lys has the meaning of purity and chastity in Catholic religion. This is based upon scripture.[citation needed] Paul VI published his encyclical Humanae Vitae subtitled On Human Life, on July 25, 1968. In this encyclical he reaffirmed the Catholic Church’s traditional condemnation of artificial birth control.\n\n[edit] Pope John Paul I (De medietate lunae)\n\n“De medietate lunae” translates to “from the midst of the moon” or “from the half moon”. It has also been interpreted as “De media aetate lunae”, meaning “of the average age of the moon”.\n\nAlbino Luciani, who later became Pope John Paul I, was born in Canale d’Agordo, diocese of Belluno, which name is similar to bella luna or beautiful moon.\n\nHe was elected on August 26, 1978, the day after the moon reached its last quarter, and reigned for 33 days, approximately five days longer than a lunar cycle. He died the day before the new moon.\n\nHowever, a much simpler explanation might be that he was born on the day of the half moon: on October 17, 1912, the moon was in its first quarter.\n\nOthers point to his name before becoming pope, Albino Luciani. Albino is related to “albus”, white, and “Luciani”, derived from “Lucius”, is ultimately related to the Latin word lux “light”, whence “white light”. Still others have linked “half-moon” to the smile often exhibited by John Paul I, who is remembered by many as the “smiling Pope.”\n\n[edit] Pope John Paul II (De labore solis)\n\nThe prophetic motto corresponding to Pope John Paul II is “De labore solis”, which literally means “Of the labor (work/giving birth) of the sun”; but “labor solis” is a common Latin expression that means a solar eclipse.\n\nThere are a variety of explanations that have been given to explain the motto:\n\nKarol Jozef Wojtyła, who later became Pope John Paul II, was born on 18 May 1920, the day of a partial solar eclipse over the Indian Ocean, and buried on 8 April 2005, the day of a rare hybrid eclipse over the south-western Pacific and South America.\n\nDuring World War II, Karol Wojtyła worked in a quarry, “laboring in the sunlight”.\n\nIt might also be seen to be the fruit of the intercession of the “Woman Clothed with the Sun labouring” in the Book of Revelation 12, because of his devotion to the Virgin Mary, to whose intercession he credited surviving an assassination attempt early in his papacy.\n\nAlso, he affirmed the importance of the reported messages of the Virgin Mary at Fatima, which had as its confirming event, the strange “solar miracle” or “sun spinning in the sky” event, reported in the secular media in 1917.\n\nIt has also been suggested that the associated Latin phrase could also be an anagram for “de borealis sol” (correct Latin: de boreali sol) or “a Sun from the North”, being a luminary coming from Poland which is north of Rome.\n\nAnother interpretation points simply to the sun rising in the east and his being the first Pope from Eastern Europe.\n\nA further theory is that the combination of “labore” and “solis” cryptically refers to “the sun of the workers”, i.e., “the star of communism”, with John Paul being the only pope to have spent much of his life under a communist regime.\n\nSaid Pope rose in history together – and probably had special relationship with – the Gdansk “Solidarity” workers union. The logo of this union is the circle of the sun and some lines which represent its rays, plus the word “SOL” which is the beginning of the Polish Union name “Solidarity”.\n\nYet another theory exists among some traditionalist Catholics, who believe that the motto translates as “Eclipse of the Sun”. These Catholics view the Second Vatican Council as a fundamental departure of the Catholic faith. and that the differences between the church before and after the council are stark enough to regard the contemporary official Catholic Church as a new modernist church and not truly Catholic. The sun is so interpreted as the true Catholic faith, which has been eclipsed by the heterodoxy of the council teachings. They identify this time period as the Great Apostasy, that has been predicted for the End of Times.\n\nJohn Paul II introduced the Luminous Mysteries to the Rosary.\n\nDuring his pontificate, John Paul II traveled extensively all around the world, more than any other pope before, and similarly to what the sun does daily, from an earth-centric point of view.[67]\n\nNicolaus Copernicus, who was the first astronomer to formulate a comprehensive heliocentric cosmology, spent his youth in Kraków, Poland. The heliocentric model of the universe was described as heretical by Catholic Church during the early 17th century, when the Copernican system was espoused by Galileo Galilei. This position was reversed in 1992 by Pope John Paul II, who also spent his youth in Kraków, Poland, in his apology to Galileo, 450 years after Copernicus published De revolutionibus and 360 years after Galileo’s trial. Thus, the “Toil of the Sun” may have referenced the Church’s acceptance of heliocentricity.\n\n[edit] Pope Benedict XVI (Gloria olivae)\n\n“Gloria olivae” or “glory of the olive”, is the last short phrase on the list.\n\nPrior to the papal conclave, this motto led to speculation that the next pontiff would be from the Order of Saint Benedict, whose symbols include the olive branch.\n\nJoseph Cardinal Ratzinger, elected in April 2005, is not a Benedictine, but did choose Benedict XVI as his regnal name, partially named after Benedictine founder Benedict of Nursia, which might be regarded as a fulfillment of this prophecy.\n\nBy choosing the name Benedict, the Pope became linked with St. Benedict, who in turn is distantly connected to the Olivetans, a small sub-order of Benedictines. Although it is frequently stated that the Order of St Benedict is also known as that of the Olivetans, this is not true: while all Olivetans are Benedictines, few Benedictines are Olivetans.\n\nOn 5 April 1993, the future Pope Benedict XVI was installed as the cardinal bishop of Velletri-Segni. Velletri’s coat of arms are emblazoned with three olive trees. It was while Cardinal Bishop of the Sees of Ostia and Velletri-Segni that Cardinal Ratzinger took part in the 2005 Conclave, in which he was elected Pope.\n\nPope Benedict XVI was born on 16 April, the feast day of Saint Benedict Joseph Labre (26 March 1748 – 16 April 1783), also known as the Holy Pilgrim, with whom the Pope now shares both names, Benedict and Joseph. St. Benedict Labre, however, is not associated with olives, Olivetans or Mount Olivet in any way.\n\nYet another possible interpretation might be that, like his predecessor — who spoke of the Church needing to “breathe with both lungs” again — Pope Benedict XVI has a special desire to reunite with the Eastern Orthodox churches, which have been separated since the Great Schism in 1054. The olive can of course be taken as a symbol of Greece, and hence the Greek Orthodox Church (and — by extension — the Russian Orthodox Church which grew out of it).\n\nAnother interpretation was that “Gloria Olivae” would promote world peace, as symbolized by the olive branch. In a general audience on 27 April 2005, Benedict XVI explained that he chose his regnal name as a link to Benedict XV, “Religio Depopulata”, and that: “In his footsteps I place my ministry, in the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples, profoundly convinced that the great good of peace is above all a gift of God, a fragile and precious gift to be invoked, safeguarded and constructed, day after day and with everyone’s contribution.”\n\nSome, who expect Pope Benedict XVI to restore order and discipline, namely, the “rule“, Latin “regula“, within the Catholic Church, the “sheepfold”, Latin “ovilis”, whence “ovilia”, the place where the sheep lay to rest. Consider the phrase to be an imperfect and ungrammatical anagram, “de regola ovilia” (correct Latin: de regula oviliae) or “of the rule of the sheepfold” for the counter-reformation he is expected to introduce.\n\nOthers have pointed to the Olivet Discourse in the Gospel of Matthew and argued that the events described therein will come to completion during the reign of this Pope. These people argue that the Tribulation will begin during the reign of Benedict XVI.\n\nCardinal Ratzinger’s choice of the name Benedict XVI was seen by some as the fulfillment of the prophecy gloria olivae, since it is claimed that the olive branch is sometimes used as a symbol of St. Benedict. However, prior to his election there were numerous speculations in the media as to what could be considered as “fulfillment of the prophecy”. For example, it was said that any pope from the Benedictine Order; or any Latin American pope (with olive complexion) or any black pope; or any pope from Italy or Spain (two countries strongly associated with the cultivation of olives); or any pope with links to Judaism—any of the aforementioned possibilities was advanced as constituting a fulfillment of the prophecy, giving a broad array of possibilities. It has also been noted that the choice of name, while interesting for those who predicted the choice of the name, was not statistically unlikely, as modern papal names are generally chosen from a fairly limited set of names. In the last 250 years, for example, there have only been eight names used for Popes: Clement, John, Benedict, Pius, Gregory, Paul, Leo, and John Paul. Media comments on Pope Benedict XVI’s choice of name have suggested that his motive was to emulate Pope Benedict XV‘s legacy of diplomacy and theological conservatism.\n\n[edit] Petrus Romanus\n\nThe longest and final motto reads in the original Latin:\n\nIn ꝑſecutione extre-\n\nma S.R.E. ſedebit.\n\nPetrus Romanus, qui\n\npaſcet oues in mul-\n\ntis tribulationibus:\n\nquibus tranſactis ci-\n\nuitas ſepticollis di-\n\nruetur, & Iudex tre\n\nmẽdus iudicabit po\n\npulum ſuum. Finis.\n\nThis is usually translated into English as:\n\n“In the last persecution of the Holy Roman Church, Peter the Roman will hold the see (lit. “sit”),\n\nwho will pasture his sheep in many tribulations:\n\nand when these things are finished, the city of seven hills will be destroyed,\n\nand the terrible judge will judge his people.\n\nThe End.”\n\nHowever, in the 1595 Lignum Vitae, the line In persecutione extrema S.R.E. sedebit. forms a separate sentence and paragraph of its own, and it is unclear whether it is grammatically related to Gloria Olivae which precedes it, or to Petrus Romanus, which follows it.\n\nThere is, also, a claim that the original list written by St. Malachy, does not contain a reference to Petrus Romanus and that the last lines were added to the printed text in Wyon’s Lignum Vitæ. This, however, cannot be proved, as the original manuscript (if any) probably no longer exists.\n\n[edit] Authenticity and skepticism\n\nSpanish writer father Benito Jerónimo Feijóo wrote in his Teatro Crítico Universal (1724–1739), in an entry called Purported prophecies, that the ones by Saint Malachy’s were a shameful forgery, claiming that they were created ad hoc during the 16th century. As a proof, he offers an accurate fact: that the first time the prophecy is mentioned is on a handwritten account by patriarch Alfonso Chacón (a.k.a Alphonsus Ciacconus, 1540–1599) in 1590 (this account would be later published, in 1595, by the abovementioned historian Arnold de Wyon); in this account, Chacón only comments the prophecies until the papacy of Urban VII (whose papacy only lasted September 1590, and was the current pope at the time Chacón wrote the comment). According to Feijóo, Chacón, who held a great intellectual prestige at the time, was lured to comment the prophecies by someone who wanted to help cardinal Girolamo Simoncelli (1522–1605) reach the papacy. By showing them to be accurate till Urban VII, it was expected people to believe the next ones; that way, Girolamo Simoncelli could be easily elected pope, since the prophecy after Urban VII’s one tells about a pope Ex antiquitate urbis (from the antiquity of the city), a fact that seems to fit him, who was cardinal of Orvieto (literally “old city”, urbs vetus), or at least better than Gregory XIV, who was elected pope after Urban VII. Thus, the forgery would have been useless, since Simoncelli was not elected pope. Jesuit father Claude-François Menestrier also claimed that the prophecies were forged in order to help the papal candidacy of Girolamo Simoncelli, offering similar reasons to those of Feijóo. Spanish historian José Luis Calvo points out that the prophecies seem to be very accurate till Urban VII, fitting perfectly even the antipopes, but that afterwards great efforts have to be made in order to make the prophecies fit their pope. Feijóo’s explanation is usually regarded as being the most probable proof of the forgery.\n\n[edit] Erroneous claims\n\nA number of claims have been made about the original text of the Prophecies. Many of these claims attempt to allay anxiety arising from the apparently imminent appearance of the “last Pope” and the subsequent Last Judgment. These claims include the following:\n\nClaim: The last entry describing Petrus Romanus was first recorded sometime after 1820 and so is not part of the original prophecy. Alternatively, the 112th pope was added in 1559 by the Olivetan monks.[68]\n\nResponse: The entry is definitely attested earlier than 1820. There is no 1559 text of the prophecies. The 1595 printing of Lignum Vitæ is the earliest extant copy of the prophecies, and it contains the full text referring to Petrus Romanus.[69]\n\nClaim: There is no 112 number preceding the Petrus Romanus prophecy,[70] therefore either Gloria olivæ and Petrus Romanus are the same, or there may be many unprophesied Popes between Gloria olivæ and Petrus Romanus.\n\nResponse: There is indeed no “112” preceding the entry for Petrus Romanus; there are also no numbers given for any of the other Papal mottos, yet it is plain that it is intended to be a sequential list. There is no potential in the first printed publication list for confusion between Gloria olivæ and Petrus Romanus, which follows below it."
