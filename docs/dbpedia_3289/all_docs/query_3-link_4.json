        "text": "Biographical Dictionary\n\nPope Paul III (1534-1549)\n\nConsistory of June 2, 1542 (VII)\n\n(40) 1. MORONE, Giovanni Girolamo (1509-1580)\n\nBirth. January 25, 1509, Milan. Of a noble family that moved to Modena while he was in his infancy. Son of Girolamo Morone, grand chancellor of the duchy of Milan, and Amabilia Fisiraga.\n\nEducation. Completed his primary and secondary education in Modena; studied jurisprudence in Padua; his father trained him in the conduction of public affairs.\n\nEarly life. Cleric of Milan. In recognition of his father's services during his imprisonment by the imperial troops that sacked Rome, Pope Clement VII elevated him to the episcopate.\n\nEpiscopate. Elected bishop of Modena, April 7, 1529 (1); he was only twenty years old and was to govern the diocese through vicars general until reaching the canonical age of 27. His episcopal motto was Coelitus datum. Sent to a diplomatic mission in France in 1529. Cardinal Ippolito d'Este strongly opposed the election, arguing that the see of Modena had been promised to him; he asked Duke Alfonso of Ferrara for help and took possession of the see by force, confiscating all its revenues; on February 6, 1531, the pope asked Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to intercede in favor of Bishop Morone; the dispute was settled in 1532, when Bishop Morone bought off the opposition of Cardinal d'Este, agreeing to pay him an annual pension of 400 ducats.\n\nPriesthood. Ordained, January 12, 1533, Bologna; and on that same day and place received the episcopal consecration; entered his diocese on January 28, 1533. Sent to a diplomatic mission before Duke Alfonso Sforza of Milan in 1535. In 1536, he went as nuncio to the court of Ferdinand I, king of the Romans, to promote in Hungary and Bohemia the celebration of the general council; he was instructed to obtain from the king a safe conduct for those who intended to take part in the meeting and to propose Mantua or another Italian city as the place of council. He was present at the Diets of Hagenau in 1540 and Regensburg in 1541; and was the papal special representative at the Diet of Spiers in 1542; he had a leading role although his tact and resolution did not accomplish much due to the difficulty of the German religious situation.\n\nCardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of June 2, 1542; received the red hat and the title of S. Vitale, October 16, 1542. Together with Cardinals Reginald Pole and Pierpaolo Parisio, named president of the Council of Trent, November 1, 1542; due to the small number of delegates, the proceedings were suspended on July 6, 1543; the reopening of the council was delayed until December 1545. Legate in Bologna, April 2, 1544 until July 13, 1548. Legate pro pace before Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, July 30, 1544. Named by the pope again to the general council, November 2, 1544.

Participated in the second conclave of 1555, which elected Pope Paul IV. Opted for the title of S. Maria in Trastevere, June 12, 1556. Pope Paul IV publicly degraded him and imprisoned him in the castle of Sant'Angelo on suspicion of Lutheran heresy on May 31, 1557 (3); Cardinal Michele Ghisleri, future Pope Pius V, carefully examined Cardinal Morone in his prison, found him innocent and declared so in the presence of Pope Paul IV, who on March 27, 1559, restored him to the cardinalitial dignity and assigned him to the suburbicarian see of Albano; Cardinal Morone could have had his freedom, but refused to accept the promotion and to leave prison unless the pope publicly acknowledged his innocence; the pontiff did not, and he remained incarcerated until Pope Paul IV's death on August 18, 1559.

Both Eubel and Gams indicate that Bishop Gonzaga, later cardinal, occupied the see from 1527 to 1529 and that it was then when Bishop Morone was elected. The latter's biography in German, linked above, says that he was bishop of Tortona in 1528 for a brief period of time; but none of the sources consulted mention this. His second biography in English, also linked above, indicates that he was named bishop of Modena in 1527.\n\n(2) These cardinals were Giandomenico de Cupis, François de Tournon, Gian Pietro Carafa, Rodolfo Pio, Pedro Sarmiento, Marcello Cervini, Marcello Crescenzi, Girolamo Verallo, Francesco Pisano and Reginald Pole.\n\n(3) From his times in Germany and throughout his life, he remained a notable member of a group of moderate and intellectual men who believed that in the struggle with Lutheranism, the faults were not all on one side. His ideas on justification, veneration of the saints and relics were considered suspicious; the pope confronted the spirituali and between 1557 and 1558 sent to prison, besides Cardinal Morone, others like Pietro Antonio di Capua, archbishop of Otranto; Giovanni Francesco Verdura, bishop of Chiron; Egidio Foscherari, O.P., bishop of Mantua; Cavaliere Mario Galeota; and nobleman Bartolomeo Spadafora; Cardinal Reginald Pole was saved by the intercession of Queen Mary I Tudor of England.\n\n(4) This is the text of his epitaph taken from Chacón, Vitæ, et res gestæ Pontificvm Romanorum et S.

Toward September 1494, in Granada, Spain. Third child of Íñigo López de Mendoza (1440-1515), second count of Tendilla and first marquis of Mondéjar and his second wife, Francisca Pacheco Portocarrero. Grand-nephew of Cardinal Pedro González de Mendoza (1473).\n\nEducation. Studied at Colegio de S. Cecilio, Granada, under the direction of Archbishop Fray Hernando de Talavera, O.S.H.; later, in Salamanca (1509-1513); and then in Alcalá until 1515.\n\nEarly life. He went to Rome in 1515 and became privy chamberlain of Pope Leo X. Abbot of the colegiates of Valladolid and Medina del Campo. At the beginning of 1522 he went by sea to join the recently elected Pope Adrian VI and he was imprisioned by the French. A failed attempt to escape in September 1522 made the French retain in him prison until after June 1523. He returned to Rome and after the death of Adrian VI, he went back to Spain. Dean of Córdoba from June 1528 until August 1531. He unsuccessfuly aspired to the see of Oviedo in 1531. Chaplain of Emperor Charles V. He took part in the negotiations with France together with Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle and Francisco de los Cobos in Salses in 1537.\n\nEpiscopate. Elected bishop of Jaén, June 14, 1538; he entered the see on July 11, 1539; he arrived in Jaén accompanied by his confessor Martín Pérez de Ayala. During his episcopate the University of Baeza was founded by Juan de Ávila, future saint. He probably accompanied Emperor Charles V as vicar general in the expedition to Argel in 1541; after having returned to his see, he again accompanied the emperor in his travels to the Low Countries and Germany in 1543. During the absence from his see, he delegated in Licentiate Pedro de Mérida as provisor of the bishopric. Around June 1543, he was named ambassador before the Council of Trent, post that he never exercised. He was attending the Diet of Speyer with the emperor when he died.\n\nCardinalate. The reference to this prelate as a cardinal has been documented since ancient times. González Dávila already calls him a cardinal-elect. We owe its news to an article by Francisco Juan Martínez Rojas (Anotaciones al episcopologio giennense de los SS XV y XVI, Boletín del Instituto de Estudios Giennenses, nº 177, 2001) who cites, among others, González Palencia (Vida y obras de Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 1943) or Ibáñez de Segovia (Historia [handwritten] de la Casa de Mondéjar), but above all it is based on a letter (May 1545) by Francisco de los Cobos recommending Emperor Charles V to propose Diego Hurtado de Mendoza as a cardinal, arguing that Pope Paul III would grant it, since the one made to the bishop of Jaén had an effect (his brother). González Palencia affirms that he would have been created in pectore in the consistory of June 2, 1542.\n\nDeath. March 22, 1544, Speyer. Buried (no information found).\n\nWebgraphy. His arms and biography, in Spanish, Wikipedia.\n\nNote: The date of his birth is an estimate from a ltter of his father from the en of November or beginning of December 1508, which is reproduced by Martinez Rojas, in which he says that his son Francisco was 14 years and two and a half months old. There is a problem of homonymy that sometimes leads to confusion with a bishop of Zamora with the same name, who died in 1536. Most sources, including Hierarchia, do not give an exact date of his death and limit themselves to sya that he died at the end of 1543. The date here given comes from an article by Juan M. Carretero Zamora (\"The collection of Spain in the time of Carlos V\", in Cuadernos de Historia de España, v. 78, nº 1, 2003) and is consistent with the data suggested by some contemporary news (correspondence, etc.), as well as with the news that Jimena gives that on January 8 (1544) his provider acted on his behalf, although he attributes it to the fact that he should not have been known the death of the bishop.\n\nCROCE, B., Bernardino della (1502-1568)\n\nBirth. 1502, Riva S. Vitale (Ticino), son of Giovan Antonio della Croce, castellano of Bellinzona until 1499.\n\nEducation. Joined the Order of the Barnabites and studied in Rome.\n\nPriesthood. Ordained (no further information found). Secretary to Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, when he was elected Pope Paul III in 1534. Canon of the patriarchal Vatican basilica. Cubiculario and papal secretary.\n\nEpiscopate. Elected bishop of Casale Monferrato, June 1546. Consecrated (no information found). Elected bishop of Asti in April 1547. Transferred to the see of Como, September 1548; enthronized, November 1550; occupied the see until April 1559; it seems that the delay in entering his diocese of Como and his subsequent resignation was due to his misunderstanding with the Spanish authorities. He remained in Rome at the court of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, nephew of Pope Paul III, trying to be made a cardinal. He sent his brother Rodolfo, primicerio of the metropolitan of Milan, as vicar. On November 15, 1550, failing to achieve his goal, he arrived in Como, and during his episcopate he did his utmost to restore the bishop's palace and the church of Riva San Vitale, naming it after the Holy Cross. In 1559 he renounced the see of Como in favor of Giovanni Antonio Volpi, from Como, and bequeathed all his assets to the church of Como. On October 18, 1567, he was the principal consecrator of Giovan Mario de Alessandri, bishop of Oppido Mamertina.\n\nCardinalate. He presented himself before the Sacred College of Cardinals in the conclave of 1549 trying to participate in it but he was not recognized as a cardinal by the Sacred College.\n\nDeath. August 15, 1568, Rome. Buried in the chapel of S. Maria del Soccorso, Vatican basilica, Rome.\n\nWebgraphy. Biography, in Italian, Dizionario Storico della Svizzera; his arms and biography, in Italian, Wikipedia.\n\nNote: The story of his secret creation and presentation to the conclave of 1549 is recorded by Francesco Cancellieri Descrizione delle cappelle pontificie e cardinalizie di tutto l'anno e de' concistori pubblici e segreti da aggiungnersi a quella de' tre pontificali, e delle funzioni della settimana santa, pubblicata in altri due tometti. Si premette una descrizione storico-critica delle sale regie, e ducale, e delle cappelle Paoline, e Sistina, del Vaticano, e del Quirinale, presso Luigi Perego Salvioni stampator vaticano, 1790. It is doubtful that he was, as they say, general treasurer, not appearing in Francesco Vitale's work (Memorie istoriche dei Tesorerieri generali pontifici, Napoli, 1772) his secret creation, if true, would probably date to the consistory of April 8, 1549.\n\nTop Consistories Catalogs Home\n\n©1998-2023 Salvador Miranda."
