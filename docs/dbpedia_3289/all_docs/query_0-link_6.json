        "text": "Election of Pope Sixtus V\n\nPapal conclave\n\nApril 1585\n\nDates and location21–24 April 1585\n\nApostolic Palace, Papal StatesKey officialsDeanAlessandro FarneseCamerlengoFilippo GuastavillaniElected popeFelice Peretti di Montalto\n\nName taken: Sixtus V\n\n← 1572\n\nSeptember 1590 →\n\nThe 1585 papal conclave (21–24 April), convoked after the death of Pope Gregory XIII, elected Cardinal Felice Peretti Montalto (O.F.M.Conv), who took the name Sixtus V. Forty-two of the sixty cardinals participated in the conclave. The absence of thirty percent of the cardinalate makes this conclave one of the most sparsely attended in the history of the modern Roman Catholic Church. Fourteen of Gregory XIII's thirty cardinals failed to attend, a startlingly high number.\n\nThe conclave began in the Vatican on 21 April, Easter Sunday. At the opening ceremonies, out of sixty living cardinals thirty-nine were in attendance. Three more arrived later, in time to cast a vote: Andreas of Austria, Ludovico Madruzzo of Trent, and Guido Luca Ferrero of Vercelli. Two factions quickly formed. The first was led by Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici and the second by Luigi d'Este (grandson of King Louis XII of France). They were willing to combine to make a pope, but it depended on whether they could agree on a common candidate.\n\nEarly voting seemed to favour Cardinals Pier Donato Cesi and Guglielmo Sirleto, but by the next morning they had been abandoned. Wanting to avoid the potential influence of cardinals who had not yet arrived, Medici then proposed two names to D' Este: those of Cardinals Albani and Montalto, and invited him to choose. D' Este imposed conditions, however, and the projected deal, when news got out, caused much indignation. Through a series of misdirections and stratagems, Medici convinced the cardinals that Montalto was not his candidate.\n\nLudovico Cardinal Madruzzo, who was the designated leader of the Spanish faction, then arrived in Rome and had conversations with the Spanish and Imperial ambassadors before he entered conclave. Meeting immediately with d' Este, Madruccio learned of d' Este's dislike of his own favorite, Sirleto. Considering that a completely pro-Spanish pope would be as unpalatable as a completely pro-French one, he therefore declared himself to d'Este to be against Cardinal Albani, and thus in favor of Montalto. Altemps, Medici and Gesualdo then put pressure on Madruccio as well, and he was won over. As leader of the Spanish interest, he brought his own influence to bear on Andrew of Austria, Colonna, Deza (Seza), Gonzaga, Sfondrati and Spinola. With all of these adherents, Medici and d'Este still needed four votes. These could only be had in the group of Gregory XIII's cardinals organized by Alessandro Farnese, the Dean of the College of Cardinals. During that night, Cardinal Ferrero arrived.\n\nOn 24 April Medici explained to Montalto all that had been done, and advised him as to how affairs should be conducted. D'Este met with Farnese, who believed that Montalto had no voting strength, and managed to further misdirect him. During a meeting in the Pauline Chapel, d' Este recruited Guastavillani, the Cardinal Camerlengo; Giambattista Castagna, the Cardinal of San Marcello; and Francesco Sforza. When the cardinals finally assembled in the Sistine Chapel, d' Este declared that it was not necessary to proceed to a ballot, since it was obvious who the new pope was. Without opposition the cardinals proceeded to do homage ('adoration') to Felice Cardinal Peretti though, immediately afterwards, a vote was conducted by asking each cardinal to cast his vote aloud. The vote was unanimous. Cardinal François de Joyeuse arrived in Rome too late to participate in the Conclave.\n\nThe coronation of Sixtus V took place on May 1. As senior cardinal deacon Cardinal de' Medici placed the tiara on his head. On May 5, he took possession of the Lateran.\n\nAlessandro Farnese, Bishop of Ostia and Velletri, Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals\n\nGiacomo Savelli, Vicar of Rome, Bishop of Porto and Santa Rufina\n\nGiovanni Antonio Serbelloni, Bishop of Frascati\n\nAlfonso Gesualdo, Bishop of Albano\n\nGianfrancesco Gambara, Bishop of Palestrina\n\nGirolamo Simoncelli\n\nMark Sittich von Hohenems Altemps, Bishop of Constance\n\nLuigi d'Este, Archbishop of Auch\n\nLudovico Madruzzo\n\nInnico d'Avalos d'Aragona\n\nFerdinando de' Medici\n\nMarco Antonio Colonna\n\nTolomeo Gallio\n\nProspero Santacroce\n\nGuido Luca Ferrero\n\nGuglielmo Sirleto\n\nGabriele Paleotti, Archbishop of Bologna\n\nMichele Bonelli\n\nAntonio Carafa\n\nGiulio Antonio Santorio\n\nPier Donato Cesi\n\nCharles d'Angennes de Rambouillet, Bishop of Le Mans\n\nFelice Peretti Montalto OFM (elected as Pope Sixtus V)\n\nGirolamo Rusticucci\n\nNicolas de Pellevé, Archbishop of Sens\n\nGian Girolamo Albani\n\nFilippo Boncompagni\n\nFilippo Guastavillani, Camerlengo\n\nAndrea d'Austria, Bishop of Brixen\n\nAlessandro Riario, Titular Patriarch of Alexandria\n\nPedro de Deza\n\nGiovanni Vincenzo Gonzaga\n\nGiovanni Antonio Facchinetti de Nuce, Patriarch of Jerusalem\n\nGiambattista Castagna, Papal Legate to Bologna\n\nAlessandro Ottaviano de' Medici, Archbishop of Florence\n\nGiulio Canani, Bishop of Adria\n\nNiccolò Sfondrati, Bishop of Cremona\n\nAntonmaria Salviati\n\nFilippo Spinola, Bishop of Nola\n\nMatthieu Cointerel,\n\nScipione Lancelotti\n\nFrancesco Sforza\n\nThe following cardinals did not attend the conclave:\n\nNiccolò Caetani.\n\nGeorges d'Armagnac, archbishop of Toulouse, France.\n\nCharles II de Bourbon-Vendôme, archbishop of Rouen, France.\n\nAntoine Perrenot de Granvelle, archbishop of Besançon, France, and bishop of Sabina.\n\nAlbrecht von Austria.\n\nLouis II de Guise, archbishop of Reims, France.\n\nCharles II de Lorraine de Vaudémont, administrator of Toul, and Verdun, France.\n\nGaspar de Quiroga y Vela, archbishop of Toledo, Spain.\n\nRodrigo de Castro Osorio, archbishop of Seville, Spain.\n\nFrançois de Joyeuse, archbishop of Narbonne, France.\n\nMichele Della Torre, bishop of Ceneda.\n\nAgostino Valier, bishop of Verona.\n\nVincenzo Lauro, bishop of Mondovi.\n\nAlberto Bolognetti, Bishop of Massa Marittima.\n\nJerzy Radziwill, bishop of Wilno, Lithuania.\n\nSimeone Tagliavia d'Aragonia.\n\nCharles III de Bourbon de Vendôme, coadjutor archbishop of Rouen, France.\n\nAndrew Báthory, bishop of Ermland, Prussia."
