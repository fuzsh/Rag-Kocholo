As a postgraduate I spent much of my time searching for answers to what seemed to me fundamental questions about what a cardinal is—or was. In attempting to answer some of my own questions, my research moved from specific cardinals to the impact that cardinals could have as a body. My aim has been to provide material and answer questions for which I could find no easy answers. This book, therefore, is an attempt to provide some boundaries within which cardinals may be studied—how they were defined in the fifteenth century and how they related to the pope and his city. It is by no means a definition of what they were, for there are as many definitions as there were, and are, cardinals. Most of all, I hope that it will encourage others to tackle this fascinating subject and period—whether through the study of individual cardinals or the topography of Rome. Such answers as I could find have come up in every corner of scholarship. Although I am an art historian, and therefore the visual manifestations of the relationship of the papal court with Rome are the main focus of my enquiry, understanding these works of art and architecture—how they came to exist, how they were used, and what they might represent—demands an interdisciplinary approach. The subjects and disciplines on which I have relied for information and inspiration include political and economic history, theology, liturgy, topography, and archaeology. I hope this book will be as useful for those fields as they have been for my researches. As this study is interdisciplinary in nature, the range of sources consulted is wide and disparate. To include full notes for every topic would have made the book unwieldy. Throughout notes are given as an indication of the supporting material. Primary sources are quoted in the notes where these are from unpublished archival or not generally available published sources. Wherever possible, secondary material used\n\nxxiv\n\npreface\n\nis in English. Primary sources quoted in the text are all in English, from accessible translations or translated specially for this work. Most of the research for this book was carried out under the auspices of the AHRB “Court Culture of Early Modern Rome” research project. The images were paid for with grants from the British Academy and the Research Committee of the Faculty of Arts at The Open University. I am most grateful to all these bodies for their invaluable support. So many people have helped and encouraged me over the past decade of research for this book that it would be impossible to name them all. The librarians and archivists at the following institutions have been particularly generous with their collections: Archivio Segreto Vaticano, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (and the other members of the URBS consortium in Rome), British Library, Open Library, Warburg Institute. I would single out the British School at Rome, an institution whose librarians, staff, and scholars have done more to shape the direction of my research than anywhere or anyone else. Cornelia Linde very kindly checked some of my Latin transcriptions at the last minute. The editorial board and editorial team at Brill were a pleasure to deal with.

They were blamed for keeping the popes in Avignon for much of the fourteenth century instead of letting them return to Rome.1 After the dramatic events of 1378, the cardinals were also blamed for causing the schism.2 In April, following the death in March of Gregory XI (1370–8), they had elected Bartolomeo Prignano, Archbishop of Bari, who adopted the name Urban VI (1378–89). He was the first Italian pope since Benedict XI at the beginning of the fourteenth century to be elected in Rome.3 Shortly afterwards, when Urban VI’s hot temper and desire for reform was exposed, the cardinals claimed that the election was invalid as it had been under duress: it was the first election that had taken place in Rome for seventy-five years, and the local populace had bullied them into electing an Italian.4 In September, the mainly French cardinals elected a new pope, the French Robert of Geneva, who took the name Clement VII (1378–94).\n\n1 On the Avignon period see Étienne Baluze, Vitae paparum Avenionensium : hoc est historia pontificum Romanorum qui in Gallia sederunt ab anno Christi 1305 usque ad annum 1394, ed.

Altogether, this period of two and then three popes, known as the Great Schism, lasted for forty years. When the schism was finally resolved in 1417 with the election of Martin V (1417–31), one of the main casualties was the College of Cardinals.5 The problems the cardinals had created in the first place—the result of a series of attempts to assert their influence over the pope—left them, as a group, weaker than they had ever been since their emergence as the pope’s exclusive counsel in the eleventh century. The first half of the fifteenth century was a period of consolidation for the popes and their cardinals following the exile and schism. Most of all, the papal court had to resettle in Rome and forge close links—both practical and symbolic—with the city. It is this period of reclaiming Rome as papal city that is the focus of this book. Popes and cardinals Late in 1378 the indomitable Catherine of Siena (d. 1380) wrote from Rome to the small group of Italian cardinals who had joined the French to help elect Clement VII—Pietro Corsini, Giacomo Orsini, and Simone da Borzano—making her opinion of them and what they had done clear.6 Her sharp words can be taken as representative of wider feeling amongst Italians and those still loyal to the papacy in Rome: Oimé! Oimé! To what have you come by not pursuing your exalted state virtuously! You were set to feed at the breast of holy church. Like flowers you were put in this garden to spread the fragrance of virtue. You were 5 The College of Cardinals during the councils of Pisa and Constance is discussed in more detail in chapter 1 below. 6 Pietro Corsini had been made cardinal in 1370 by Urban V and was dean of the College of Cardinals; Giacomo Orsini and Simone da Borzano were both cardinals of Gregory XI. The fourth Italian cardinal in the college that elected Urban VI, Francesco Tebaldeschi, died on 6 September 1378, two weeks before the majority of cardinals had elected Clement VII. Although present at the conclave, Corsini had abstained at the election. The three Italian cardinals refused to side with either pope. In January 1379 they finally turned their backs on Urban VI while still not siding with Clement VII. See Baluze, Vitae paparum Avenionensium, vol. 4, cols 837–47, 186–194; Catherine of Siena, Letters, vol. 3, 218.\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\nset as pillars to fortify this little ship and Christ’s vicar on earth. You were set as a lamp on a lampstand to give light to faithful Christians and to spread the faith. You know very well whether or not you’ve done what you were assigned to do—and you certainly haven’t . . . And where is the gratitude you owe this bride who has nurtured you at her breast? I see nothing but ingratitude, ingratitude that dries up the fountain of devotedness. What shows me that you are ingrates, villains, mercenaries? The persecution which you and the others have directed and continue to direct against this bride at a time when you ought to recognize the truth that Pope Urban VI is truly pope . . . Now you have made an about-face like wretched cowardly knights. . . . What caused this? The poison of selfish love that has poisoned the world. That is what has made you pillars worse than straw. Not flowers spreading fragrance but a stench that has pervaded the whole world. Not lamps set on a lampstand to spread the faith; no, since you’ve hidden this light under the basket of pride, you’ve become not spreaders but contaminators of the faith and are spreading darkness to yourselves as well as to others.7\n\nWhen Cardinal Francesco Uguccione (d. 1412), Archbishop of Bordeaux, addressed the joint parliaments of England thirty years later in October 1408, encouraging them to support the Council of Pisa, he knew that he had to defend the cardinals’ recent actions. Most of all, what entitled the cardinals to think that only they could solve the schism by summoning such a council? Canon law, he argued—the heir of Roman law, as it was codified in the thirteenth century by the lawyer and cardinal, Hostiensis (d. 1271). Uguccione declared: . . . there is no other rank in the Church militant above the College of Cardinals, and even an undisputed pope ought to undertake all difficult business with their advice. And if anyone wants full information about the jurisdiction of the cardinals, he can see what Hostiensis wrote . . . and then you will see that their authority ought not to be so despised as it is by some.8\n\nWhat this makes clear is that while Uguccione had no doubt about the authority of the cardinals that justified their summoning of a council in Pisa to end the schism, he nevertheless recognized that their reputation was poor and had to be reasserted. Catherine of Siena, Letters, vol. 3, 217–25. Quoted and translated in Christopher Michael Dennis Crowder, Unity, Heresy and Reform, 1378–1460: The Conciliar Response to the Great Schism (London: Edward Arnold, 1977), 48–50; on Hostiensis see Brian Tierney, Foundations of the Conciliar Theory: The Contribution of the Medieval Canonists from Gratian to the Great Schism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1955), 150–1 (enlarged edition Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1998), 15, 155. 7 8\n\n4\n\nintroduction\n\nDuring the first half of the fifteenth century, the status that the cardinals had gradually established in the preceding centuries—which, in the fourteenth century, made them believe that they could depose popes as well as elect them—was to be regularly challenged and reassessed, not least by the popes themselves.9 The result was a period of realignment with the papacy from which the modern relationship of the pope and his cardinals can be traced: they moved from being the pope’s manipulators to his instruments. Each of the popes of the fifteenth century had a different attitude to the cardinals: Martin V kept them on a tight rein and did not create any new cardinals until he absolutely had to do so; in the early 1440s Eugenius IV defended the cardinals as being second only to the pope, the equivalent of the Roman Senate and superior to the bishops—but only when he was forced to do so; in the 1450s, in his biography of Nicholas V, Giannozzo Manetti remarked that the name of the College of Cardinals was a recent invention lacking a long tradition.10 But then in the 1460s Pius II described them as his co-workers, while the very act of making cardinals was the consummation of his election as pope. Indeed, in the fifteenth century there was no consensus over what a cardinal was: those against them said they were a new invention while those for them traced the college back to the Apostles, commissioned by Christ himself.11 What was going on? The popes and the cardinals in first half of the fifteenth century were inextricably bound together in a struggle for power. Since the twelfth century the cardinals had been the sole electors of the pope, free from the participation of the bishops and the representatives of secular rulers or Roman barons, and this in particular defined their role.12 Their relationship with the popes became an integral part of 9 Edith Pásztor, “Cardinali italiani e francesi tra Avignone e Basilea: due testimonianze,” in Échanges religieux entre la France et l’Italie du Moyen Âge à l’époque moderne, ed. Mgr M. Maccarone and A. Vauchez (Geneva: Slatkine, 1987), esp. 378–80; Barraclough, Medieval Papacy, 158–60. 10 The relationship between the popes and cardinals is discussed in detail in chapters 1–3 below. 11 Margaret Harvey gives an outline of how the history of the cardinalate was understood in the fifteenth century in “Eugenius IV, Cardinal Kemp and Archbishop Chichele: A Reconsideration of the Role of Antonio Caffarelli,” in The Church and Sovereignty, ed. Diana Wood, Studies in Church History, Subsidia 9 (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1991), 337. 12 In 1139 at the Lateran Council, Innocent II decreed that the cardinals alone had the right to elect the pope, independent of other clergy. See H.J. Schroeder, Disciplinary Decrees of the General Councils: Text, Translation and Commentary (St Louis: B. Herder,\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\npapal power: they elected the pope and the pope created the cardinals. This relationship took on new meaning in the fifteenth century when, after almost a century of exile and schism, it had to be redefined. But instead of increasing their influence, the cardinals almost lost it by provoking the conciliar crisis, which began with the Council of Pisa (1409) and ended at Basel (1431–49), whereby the autonomy of papal authority was challenged first by the cardinals and subsequently by the bishops, diocesan clergy, and secular rulers of western Christendom.13 The Council of Constance (1414–18) marked a particularly low point: the cardinals were practically excluded from the proceedings to reform the Church and resolve the schism, and, in the election that made Martin V pope, lost even the sole right to elect the pope that they had possessed since the twelfth century. By the middle of the fifteenth century, the cardinals had lost the concessions they had gained at the height of their powers in Avignon a century earlier. By the second half of the fifteenth century, they might have secured their position as the pope’s co-judges, his electors and counsel, but they had little power without him. The popes from Martin V to Paul II gradually eroded any status they might have claimed independent of the pope. In the last decades of the fifteenth century, from the time of Sixtus IV, their influence was further weakened by an increase in their numbers, because the threat of censure from the councils was a distant memory.14 What is a cardinal? Since they were given the sole right of electing the pope, the cardinals’ relationship with the popes had been an integral part of papal power. 1937), 195–213. Nicholas II in 1059 had decreed (with the bull In nomine domine) that the cardinal-bishops alone should elect the pope, with the other cardinals and clergy confirming their decision. See Giovanni Domenico Mansi, ed., Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova et Amplissima Collectio (Paris: H. Welter, 1901–27), vol. 19, cols 903–4. For the origins and development of their role see Pierre Jugie, “Cardinali (fino al Concilio di trento),” in Dizionario Storico del Papato, ed. Philippe Levillain (Milan: Bompiani, 1996), 253–4. 13 The position of the cardinals at the councils will be discussed in chapter 1. The most useful introduction to the conciliar crisis is the anthology of primary sources by Crowder, Unity, Heresy and Reform, 1378–1460. See also Ullmann, The Origins of the Great Schism; Tierney, Foundations of the Conciliar Theory. 14 An important point in achieving a balance of power was the election capitulations, a list of demands that each group of cardinals electing a new pope in conclave drew up for the pope to adhere to. These will be discussed further in chapter 2, 86–9.\n\n6\n\nintroduction\n\nLeo IX (1049–54) called them cardines—the hinges upon which the great door of the universal Church swings.15 This metaphor was still used in the fifteenth century and thereafter. Peter Damian (1007–72) described the cardinals as spiritual senators of the Church because they acted as the council of the pope.16 They regularly asserted that they were in equal partnership with the pope in the exercise of the papal imperium. Cardinals often signed official documents alongside, or in the place of, the pope.17 As a result they occasionally attempted to censure the individual who happened to be pope. They were always careful to distinguish between the individual who was pope and the office of the papacy, however, as the latter could not be brought into question. It was a distinction that lay behind much of the trouble in the late fourteenth century. In 1148 the cardinals reminded the Cistercian pope, Eugenius III, after he sided with Bernard of Clairvaux, the great founder of the Cistercian Order and the pope’s spiritual advisor, against the college that, as he owed his position to them, he should be loyal to them: You should know that, having been elevated to the rule of the entire church by us, around whom, like pivots [cardines], the axis of the church universal swings, and having been made by us from a private person into the father of the universal church, it is necessary from now on that you belong not just to yourself but to us; that you do not rank particular and recent friendships before those which are general and of ancient standing.18\n\n15 Stephen Kuttner, “Cardinalis: The History of a Canonical Concept,” Traditio 3 (1945): 176.

He wrote to Eugenius III that they had “no power except that which you grant them or permit them to exercise.” Their claims “make no sense . . . derived from no tradition . . . [and] had the support of no authority.”19 But there was little consensus over the cardinals’ role. Rather, their position and relationship with the pope often depended on tension—and it was usually the cardinals themselves who exploited that tension. The cardinals’ role was defined not in theory but by centuries of working closely with the pope as his advisors, electors and, on occasion, his enemies. Honorius III (1216–27) went so far as to declare an attack on one of the cardinals an attack on the pope himself, an important point in their official recognition.20 By the fourteenth century and the exile in Avignon, the cardinals were at the height of their power after three centuries of concessions from the popes and were almost inseparable from him in the exercise of papal power. At Avignon they were particularly busy not least as bankers: Clement VI ended up owing them 16,000 gold florins, for which they had to be bought off with extra powers.21 Their relationship with the popes in the increasingly complex administration of the Church throughout western Christendom resulted in the official trappings that still distinguish them today. In 1245 at the Council of Lyons Innocent IV assigned them exclusive use of the red hat and other insignia to distinguish them from other ecclesiastics.22 Their dress was further modified in the middle of the fifteenth century to reflect their status, a subject that will be discussed in chapter 3 below.\n\n1150–1300, ed.

Two of the seven Avignon popes had not been cardinals: Clement V (1305–14) who had moved the papal court to Avignon in 1309, was Archbishop of Bordeaux; Urban V (1362–70) was a Benedictine abbot. Nor had Urban VI been a cardinal before he became pope in 1378; he was Archbishop of Bari. The fact that only cardinals were considered for election to the papacy in the fifteenth century is a conclusive sign of the propinquity of popes and cardinals. Therefore, for the fifteenth century, if you want to study popes, you also need to study cardinals. From Rome to Avignon and back The three popes of the schism—of the Avignon, Roman, and Pisan obediences—and their three colleges represented different models of papal government, each of which fed into the formation of the fifteenthcentury papal paradigm. The popes of the Avignon obedience were closely aligned to the French monarchy, a practical necessity since the popes had had to leave Rome and its factional instability. The Avignon experience represented the tensions between a supreme pontiff answerable to no one and one dependent on a secular sovereign to maintain his position. The creation of cardinals loyal to the sovereign was one way in which the pope could foster his support. The popes in Rome claimed the true path that could be traced back through the apostolic succession to Peter; Rome was therefore a major aspect of the pope’s claim to universal sovereignty. The popes of Pisa represented a new model of church government by committee. The centralized power of the papacy was largely devolved to the nations of Catholic Europe so they could retain fuller control over their own affairs. The pope was to work with, and be guided by, the cardinals, and, in exceptional circumstances, broader church councils of bishops and other ecclesiastical, academic, and secular representatives. By the middle of the fifteenth century, although there was just one pope again, elements 23 Francis A. Burkle-Young, Passing the Keys: Modern Cardinals, Conclaves, and the Election of the Next Pope (Lanham: Madison Books, 1999), xxii–v.\n\nintroduction\n\n9\n\nof each of these models influenced the workings of the Renaissance papacy—their ambition for political and secular power, and the deals that constantly had to be struck with foreign powers to protect papal interests, but most of all the practical and symbolic reintegration of the papacy and Rome. Francesco Petrarch (1304–74) famously called Avignon “that most disgusting city.”24 It was “the enemy of the good, the dwelling-place and refuge of evil.”25 The cardinals, he wrote in one of his many letters, had become too accustomed to the good wine of Burgundy.26 The Italian cardinals, in particular, had betrayed the Church. The only place for the papacy was Rome. You have neglected to guide the chariot of the Bride of the Crucified One along the path so clearly marked out for her. Like the false charioteer Phaeton, you have left the right track, and though it was your office to lead the hosts safely through the wilderness, you have dragged them after you into the abyss. But one remedy now remains: you, who have been the authors of all this confusion, must go forth manfully with one heart and one soul into the fray in defence of the Bride of Christ whose seat is in Rome, of Italy, in short of the whole band of pilgrims on earth. This you must do, and then returning in triumph from the battle-field, on which the eyes of the world are fixed, you shall hear the song “Glory to God in the Highest”; and the disgrace of the covetous Gascons, striving to rob the Latins of their renown, shall serve as a warning to all future ages.27\n\nThe exile in Avignon only proved how much the papacy needed its physical, historical, and symbolic links with the city of Rome. The popes owed their identity, administration, laws, and even their universal Francesco Petrarca, Letters of Old Age = Rerum senilium libri I–XVIII, trans. Aldo S. Bernardo, Saul Levin, and Reta A. Bernardo (Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), 676 (Rerum senilium, book 18, letter 1). 25 Norman P.

Warn each and every one of the cardinals to remember that they are mortals, not to think always of pleasures but from time to time of death and eternal life . . . For I hear the saddest and the most irritating thing I could hear: that there are some who grumble that they have no burgundy wine in Italy. Would that those vines had never existed, and I would almost say, no vines at all, if they were destined to produce such a poisonous vintage for the Church of Christ!” (Rerum senilium, book 9, letter 1); also 251 (Rerum senilium, book 7, letter 1). See also Wood, Clement VI, 74–5. 27 Petrarch quoted in Pastor, History of the Popes, vol. 1, 64; Franz Xaver von Wegele, Dante’s Leben und Werke, kulturgeschichtlich dargestellt (Jena: Altenburg, 1852), 262–5. 24\n\n10\n\nintroduction\n\nauthority to the city. They styled themselves as the successors of the Roman emperors, assuming the adage “pontifex maximus” as their own, while the cardinals were modelled on the senators. None of this made much sense in the south of France in a small town on the banks of the Rhone. By implication, in Italy at least, it was strongly believed that the pope should be Italian. Catherine of Siena could not fathom why the few surviving Italian cardinals—only three of them by the end of 1378 compared with eighteen French—were willing to turn against the first Italian pope for seventy-five years when they tried to replace Urban VI with Clement VII.28 Whatever the national preferences and loyalties involved, as Diana Wood stresses in her study of one of the Avignon popes, Clement VI, “by jettisoning the link with Rome the papacy stood to lose much of the Roman theory which underpinned its own system.”29 Clement VI and other Avignon popes tried to overcome the problem by emphasizing two facets of their authority: as both Vicar of Christ and Bishop of Rome. These relationships were construed as marriages—of Christ to the Church and of the pope to Rome with its jurisdiction over the universal Church—which therefore led logically to the personification of Rome as an abandoned bride or widow (Figure 1).30 Cola di Rienzo quipped that the pope had left his bride in a tavern while he went off to take care of Avignon, the whore.31 With the papacy based in Avignon, it was easier for critics to distinguish between the pope as 28 Catherine of Siena, Letters, vol. 3, 218–25: “. . . since Christ on earth is Italian [Urban VI] and you are Italian, I see no reason other than selfish love that patriotism could not move you as it did those from the other side of the mountains [i.e. the French cardinals who elected a French anti-pope].” 29 Wood, Clement VI, 76. 30 The desertion of Rome by the papacy was compared to the Lamentations of Jeremiah on Jerusalem: “How lonely sits the city that was full of people! How like a widow has she become, she that was great among the nations! She that was a princess among the cities has become a vassal” (Lamentations 1:1). Borrowing the same metaphor, Dante (Purgatory IV, 112–26) describes Italy as a weeping widow, deserted by the emperor. During the Avignon exile the metaphor was applied specifically to Rome. Petrarch, in a number of letters, represents Rome as a white-haired matron, reminiscing about her past and lamenting the present: for example Petrarca, Letters of Old Age, 235 (Rerum senilium, book 7, letter 1, to Urban V). See Natalia Costa-Zalessow, “The Personification of Italy from Dante through the Trecento,” Italica 68 no. 3 (1991), 326–7. Bridget of Sweden was believed to represent abandoned Rome because she had chosen poverty and, like Catherine of Siena, waited in the city for the return of the pope: Julia Bolton Holloway, Saint Bride and her Book: Birgitta of Sweden’s “Revelations” (Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 2000, first published 1992), 16. 31 Wood, Clement VI, 80; Conrad Burdach, Rienzo und die geistige Wandlung seiner Zeit (Briefwechsel des Cola di Rienzo) (Berlin, 1913), vol. 1, 48–9. Petrarch and other writers\n\nintroduction\n\n11\n\nuniversal authority with power over all of Christendom and as a local bishop with jurisdiction over his diocese alone. Rome, because Peter had chosen it, was head above all other churches.32 Without Rome, what gave the popes their claim to universal authority over Christendom? Urban VI hung on to Rome, conscious of its significance, his claim made clear on his tomb that shows Peter giving him the keys of heaven and therefore his right to rule (Figure 2). What kept the popes in Avignon was the overwhelming control of the French over the pope and cardinals—most of whom, as a result, were French—and the belief that Rome was just too dangerous, with its constant civil war and internecine strife. Nevertheless, contacts were kept up with Rome, and cardinals and other envoys tried to maintain some kind of presence in the rebellious city, but it was no easy task. In the 1350s, for example, after the sight of his camel being exercised in a courtyard of the Lateran palace had provoked a riot, Annibaldo da Ceccano, cardinal-bishop of Tusculum (Frascati) and Clement VI’s legate to Rome, suggested to the Roman populace that the pope could not return to such a unstable place. The cardinal’s red hat was pierced by an arrow, and he petitioned the pope to be allowed to leave and go to Naples. He died en route: poison was suggested as the cause.33 But the fabric of the city suffered; Bridget of Sweden described the effects of neglect of the city, in terms of both its physical fabric and the discipline of the clergy.34 The problem was that Rome lacked the pope: in Petrarch’s words to Urban V, “just as you are weaker anywhere than in\n\nuse the same metaphor of Rome, the bride: for example Petrarca, Letters of Old Age, 306 (Rerum senilium, book 9, letter 1). 32 On the Petrine tradition and “how the tradition of Peter’s presence in Rome evolved,” see F. Lapham, Peter: The Myth, the Man and the Writings—A Study of Early Petrine Text and Tradition, Journal for the Study of the New Testament supplement series 239 (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 2003), 93–8.

The main palace chapel was dedicated to St Peter while another chapel in the complex was dedicated to Petrarca, Letters of Old Age, 249 (Rerum senilium, book 7, letter 1). Petrarca, Letters of Old Age, 630 (Rerum senilium, book 16, letter 7): “Avignon on the Rhone … is in no way comparable to Rome, but the Roman Pontiff and many emblems of the Roman state were there and are there today . . .

Processions between the cathedral of Rome—St John Lateran— and St Peter’s basilica through the streets of Rome could therefore be re-enacted within the palace. When a new pope was elected at Avignon, he was crowned outside the door of the chapel of St Peter, which stood in for the steps of St Peter’s where the coronation traditionally took place. Then the possesso, whereby the pope as Bishop of Rome took control of his cathedral, proceeded through the corridors of the palace from the first floor—where the chapel of St Peter was located—to the ground floor, ending at the chapel of St John, which was decorated with frescoes depicting the life of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, mirroring the decoration of the cathedral of Rome.38 Conversely, Avignon helped shape the redevelopment of Rome in the fifteenth century. Bernhard Schimmelpfennig has argued that the evolution of the papal liturgies at Avignon accelerated the withdrawal of the public ceremonies performed by the popes in the streets of Rome to within the confines of the Vatican palace.39 The topography of Avignon and its surrounds may also have influenced the organization of the papal court on its return to Rome. In Avignon the popes lived in the city proper while the majority of the cardinals lived on the other side of the River Rhone at Villeneuve-les-Avignon, a town that had previously been dominated by a Carthusian monastery, and which grew to accommodate them.40 Presumably the cardinals also had slightly more control over their own activities in Villeneuve at a remove from the papal headquarters. The papacy in Rome had settled into a similar pattern in Rome by the middle of the fifteenth century, the popes resident at the Vatican palace next to St Peter’s and most of the cardinals across the Tiber in Rome proper.\n\n38 Wood, Clement VI, 73; on the frescoes see Christian Heck, “La Chapelle du consistoire et les crucifixions dans la peinture murale Avignonnaise du XIV e siècle: le renouvellement d’un thème d’origine romaine du service de l’affirmation de la légitimité pontificale,” Genèse et débuts du grand schisme d’occident (1362–1394), Colloques Internationaux du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, vol. 586 (Paris: CNRS, 1980), 431–43. 39 Bernhard Schimmelpfennig, “Der Einfluss des avignonesischen Zeremoniells auf den Vatikanpalast seit Nikolaus V,” in Functions and Decorations: Art and Ritual at the Vatican Palace in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, ed.

The argument that where the pope was, there was Rome (“ubi papa, ibi Roma”) was simply not adequate when the faithful throughout western Christendom identified themselves as members of the Roman and Catholic (universal) Church led by the pope in Rome who was also bishop of that city.41 Because of the significance of Rome as papal city, although also in part provoked by the increasing insecurity of Avignon itself, in 1367 Urban V went back to Rome.42 In her Revelations Bridget of Sweden (1303–73) has the Virgin instructing Urban V to reinforce the Catholic faith and build stability and peace by returning to Rome so that the Church might be renewed.43 But despite his attempts to restore order, Urban V gave up and went back to Avignon in 1370 where, as St Bridget predicted, he died. Gregory XI then entered Rome in 1377, no doubt with the shrill voice of Catherine of Siena ringing in his ears. She had written to him regularly, reminding him of his duty to go back to Rome: “What sane person doesn’t see that the holiest thing is for the lord of all the world to be seated on his proper throne?”44 Bridget likewise had written that the pope was in danger of losing both his temporal and his spiritual authority unless he returned.45 Both women had moved to Rome to wait for that to happen. Gregory XI died on 41 Margaret M. Harvey, “Unity and Diversity: Perceptions of the Papacy in the Later Middle Ages,” in Unity and Diversity in the Church, ed. R.N.

Bridget went to Rome for the jubilee of 1350 and stayed there until her death in 1373, with the exception of a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1372.

But it was to take another century to restore the papacy securely in Rome. The histories of the popes Attempting to write anything that approaches a general history of the papacy is a risky business. It is all too easy to fall into the trap of making value judgements of ecclesiastical abuses that say more about our own post-modern sceptical and secular age than about the late medieval and Renaissance papacy. But this is not a new problem. Papal histories were particularly controversial in the nineteenth century—that period of great historians and great histories. The history of the papacy, and by association the cardinals, has long been dominated by the magisterial works of nineteenth-century Germanic scholars, most notably Leopold von Ranke, Ferdinand Gregorovius, and Ludwig von Pastor. The historical model upon which they relied for their approach and conclusions was predominantly Hegelian. Accordingly, these historians examined the papacy of the fifteenth century looking for signs of abuse or reform at the time that would lead directly to the Reformation north of the Alps in the sixteenth century. But the histories of Ranke, Gregorovius, and Pastor are just as revealing of the times in which they were written, something to which the histories of the Church are particularly vulnerable. Both Gregorovius and Pastor followed in the footsteps of Ranke, whose Roman Popes in the Last Four Centuries was published 1834–6. Ranke’s history was based on painstaking archival research—although his access to the Vatican was strictly limited—and as diplomatic, political, and economic aspects were revealed by documents in local archives, this was the approach he took and which still endures.46 Not surprisingly, these German historians were particularly interested in the interstices between Italian and German history, and in particular the role of the Holy Roman Emperor. The other major feature of studies that follow the Rankian model is the unquestioning application of the Hegelian teleology, so that the Reformation becomes the inevitable fulfilment of the Renaissance papacy in the relentless march towards modernity, 46 See the introduction to Gianvittorio Signorotto and Maria Antonietta Visceglia, eds, Court and Politics in Papal Rome 1492–1700 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 1.\n\nintroduction\n\n17\n\nits instrument the German peoples.47 The realignment of ecclesiastical and secular power was the result of the inevitable development of national identity and the rise of the nation state—and in particular the German state.48 In his brief analysis of the fourteenth century, Ranke makes the popes and emperors characters in a Hegelian drama: “Possessed by no means within herself,” the Church in schism (thesis) was challenged by the secular powers led by the emperor (antithesis) to move on to a “position of great splendour” that was nevertheless subtly and irreversibly altered (synthesis): “the old relations of things were no longer in force.”49 Similar forces are at work in the eight-volume History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages (1859–72) that Ferdinand Gregorovius started writing in 1856. It covers the years from 410 to 1527, a period established by the two sacks of Rome by the Germans under Alaric and Charles V.50 Despite his lack of institutional affiliation, Gregorovius’s work vividly displays the extent to which the Hegelian teleology dominated: these dates were important for German scholars writing with an innate sense of their own nation as the catalyst for the relentless forward progression of history.51 The institutional apparatus of the Church is hardly allowed to progress, proof of the expectation of the Reformation. Instead, “in Georg G. Iggers, The German Conception of History: The National Tradition of Historical Thought from Herder to the Present (Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 1968), 73: “The task of Germans is to create a genuinely German state which corresponds to the spirit of the nation.” See also Jaroslav Pelikan, “Leopold von Ranke as Historian of the Reformation,” in Leopold von Ranke and the Shaping of the Historical Discipline, ed.

Bell and Sons, 1913), vol. 1, 33. 49 Ranke, History of the Popes, vol. 1, 28–9. 50 On Gregorovius and his history see Arnold Esch and Jens Petersen, eds, Ferdinand Gregorovius und Italien. Eine kritische Würdigung (Tübingen: Niemeyer, 1993); and David S. Chambers, “Ferdinand Gregorovius and Rome,” Renaissance Studies 14 no. 4 (2000): 409–34. 51 Hegelian teleology is evident, for example in the depiction of the fifteenth century as the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of a new age, and of the German people being the catalyst for change and progression: “The accomplishment of the noblest ideas of man . . . as early as the fifteenth century . . . is visible as the budding germ of a new idea of culture, which took the place of the catholic idea of the Middle Ages.” “As the Germans had formerly acquired the teaching of Christianity from the Latins, they now received the treasures of ancient culture, which they mastered so quickly and thoroughly as already to give evidence of their future power in the domain of learning.” See Ferdinand Gregorovius, The History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages, vol. 7, 1421–1496, trans.

Pastor justified this starting point by arguing, albeit rather weakly, that “a thorough acquaintance with that period [the fifteenth century] is an essential preliminary to the comprehension of the sixteenth century,” the period of the Reformation.57\n\nand the Shaping of the Historical Discipline, ed.

Pastor’s is a safe approach: the story of the papacy is presented as a series of events which took place within a static framework of the Church as an unchanging institution. As Owen Chadwick put it, Pastor “had little sense of ‘development’, the key word in German historical minds. The Church was given, its hierarchy ordered.”60 To examine the history of the popes critically would have been unacceptable to the conservative ‘ultramontane’ ecclesiastical administration of the second half of the nineteenth century. On the effect of the humanist rediscovery of ancient texts, for example, Pastor saw the popes as benevolent parents who remain constant while supporting, and ultimately controlling, the growth of their wayward children: “as long as dogma was untouched, Nicholas V and his like-minded successors allowed the movement the most ample scope.”61 The idea of progress or development as applied by nineteenthcentury historians was a particularly problematic model for the Roman Catholic Church. As Owen Chadwick has so eloquently considered, in the seventeenth century the French theologian Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet (1627–1704) stated firmly that that there had never been, nor would there ever be, changes in dogmatic truth. But in the intervening period it was increasingly argued (ultimately by John Henry Newman in his Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine, 1845) that while the Church did not change because revelation was one and the same forever, its means of understanding and expressing itself did change: “there may be changes, but they are consolidations or adaptations; all is unequivocal and determinate, with an identity which there is no\n\n58 On the papacy in this period see Owen Chadwick, A History of the Popes 1830–1914 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), 1–268. 59 Chadwick, Catholicism and History, 122–3. 60 Chadwick, Catholicism and History, 124. 61 Pastor, History of the Popes, vol. 1, 56.\n\n20\n\nintroduction\n\ndisputing.”62 Before Newman’s ideas were generally accepted towards the end of the century, at its most basic level the idea that the papacy changed or altered course in response to external factors could therefore not be countenanced. To do so would have been to fall into the hands of the Protestant historians who sought to demonstrate that theirs was the true church which could claim continuity all the way back to the Church of the Apostles. Indeed, Ranke, in his introduction to The History of the Popes, declared that “the papal power was . . . not so unchangeable as is commonly supposed . . . its maxims, its objectives, and its pretensions have undergone essential changes [although] we perceive an impression of uninterrupted stability . . . we must not allow ourselves to be misled.”63 Each side in the debate sought to prove that the other represented a deviation from the true course. For Pastor, historical progress or development was therefore irrelevant in the ecclesiastical context, which is why the development of the institution of the papacy—and in the fifteenth century the relationship of the popes and cardinals—was not open to him for scrutiny. Pastor does not give any space to the fundamental events of the conciliar crisis which pitted the cardinals and the popes against one another. All that is reported in his narrative of events is the cardinals’ straying from their right course. Thus, for example, Martin V had to regulate them to bring them back in line because “the schism had disorganised the Sacred College, and produced a baneful spirit of independence” in them.64 The assumption is that the cardinals had been a particular institution and that they had to be returned to the same state they had been before. But what that state was is not considered by the nineteenth-century historians. While Pastor, in the aggressively defensive context in which he was writing, could not criticize individual popes given the inherent risk of\n\nJohn Henry Newman, Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine (London: Longmans, 1909; first published 1845), 444; Chadwick, Bossuet to Newman, 139–84; Paul Misner, Papacy and Development: Newman and the Primacy of the Pope (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1976), 67. 63 Ranke, preface to The History of the Popes, in Theory and Practice of History, 145. Ranke’s objectives were more philosophical and historical than religious or theological: he wanted to show that the papacy was another “portion of general history, of the overall development of the world.” He did not study the papacy in itself but as a means of considering “the peculiar role of religion as a political force in history.” See Iggers, introduction to Ranke, Theory and Practice of History, lvii–lviii; Pelikan, “Historian of the Reformation,” 93. 64 Pastor, History of the Popes, vol. 1, 263. 62\n\nintroduction\n\n21\n\ncriticizing the papacy itself, the cardinals were a much easier target. Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia became something of a test of loyalty for nineteenth-century historians. On the one hand, Pastor reserved particular disapproval for the Spanish cardinal who, he demonstrates repeatedly, was an immoral and an unsuitable character.65 On the other, Pastor explains that Borgia’s election as Alexander VI was particularly suited to the needs of the time, while his moral character was hardly out of place in a period when standards were generally lower: Alexander VI, Pastor writes, “seemed to possess all the qualities of a distinguished temporal ruler.”66 This very human history of the popes only convinced Pastor even more of the unchallengeable nature of the institution itself. Two years after the publication of the volume on Alexander VI in 1895, Pastor defended his continued faith in the Church, despite the flaws he had uncovered in his History of the Popes: “Just because of the human weaknesses, which could not abolish Church and Papacy, I say the Church must be divine.”67 In contrast, while Gregorovius includes the same details of Alexander VI’s pontificate, including his administrative abilities and popularity, he uses his discussion to make a barely veiled criticism of the papacy as a whole. For example, the conclave that elected the Borgia pope is used to reflect upon the effectiveness of conclaves in general: “even to the most pious believer in mysteries the appointment of such a man as representative of Christ . . . can scarcely appear an act of the Holy Ghost, who is supposed to influence quarrelsome and ambitious cardinals in conclave.”68 These nineteenth-century depictions of the papacy persisted until very recently. Walter Ullmann in 1972 characterized the papacy in the fifteenth century as an ineffective, marginalized, and provincial monarchy. Whereas before the exile in Avignon its power had come from its religious and intellectual status, afterwards it was marked by\n\nPastor, History of the Popes, vol. 2, 452–4; vol. 3, 277; vol. 5, 362–7.

This marriage of spiritual and temporal power in Rome is an age-old problem. The Florentine historian Francesco Guicciardini (1483–1540), in his History of Italy, described the papacy that returned to Rome from Avignon: . . . no longer using their spiritual authority except as an instrument and minister of temporal power, they began to appear rather more like secular princes rather than popes. Their concern and endeavours began to be no longer the sanctity of life or the propagation of religion, no longer zeal and charity toward their neighbours, but armies and wars against Christians . . . they began to accumulate new treasures, to make new laws, to invent new tricks, new cunning devices in order to gather money from every side; for this purpose, to use their spiritual arms without respect; for this end, to shamelessly sell sacred and profane things.70\n\nGuicciardini makes his attack on the papacy as an aside during his history of the critical period of the 1490s in the Italian peninsula when a number of city states lost their independence. In particular, as a Florentine writing about the precarious years of the Florentine republic (1492–1534), when the Medici had been ousted from the city and before they were re-established as Grand Dukes, Guicciardini could hardly fail to be critical of the popes: two of them, Leo X and Clement VIII, were Medici after all. He believed that they had done so much to damage the prospects of his city that he even admitted some sympathy for Martin Luther.71 Nepotism, the common practice of popes appointing their relatives as cardinals, lies behind many studies of popes and cardinals, and is used to account for a great deal of artistic patronage in Rome.72 As 69 Walter Ullmann, A Short History of the Papacy in the Middle Ages (London: Methuen, 1972), 306.

But by the time of Julius II, the pope only required their supporting function and this aspect dominated thereafter.75 Most of all, nepotism was the primary means by which families could use the papacy to improve their social status. In the fifteenth century, only Martin V’s family, the Colonna, were already nobility. The rest were social climbers. Indeed, as will be seen below, and in particular for the patronage of papal funerary monuments in the fifteenth century, the cardinal-nephews were important for the construction of their papal-uncles’ cultural and physical presence in Rome. Rather than a reprehensible and immoral act, it seems that in the fifteenth century\n\nState in the Thirteenth Century (London: Macmillan, 1961); Wolfgang Reinhard, “Der Funktionswandel einer papstgeschichtlichen Konstanten,” Zeitschrift für Kirchengeschichte 86 (1975): 145–85. Clare Robertson’s monograph on Cardinal Alessandro Farnese is one of the fullest explorations of the patronage of a cardinal-nephew before the end of the sixteenth century: “Il Gran Cardinale”: Alessandro Farnese, Patron of the Arts (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992). Reinhard refers to this (1538–1692) as the period of “institutionalized nepotism”: Wolfgang Reinhard, “Papal Power and Family Strategy in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries,” in Princes, Patronage, and the Nobility: The Court at the Beginning of the Modern Age c. 1450–1650, ed. Ronald G. Asch and Adolf M. Birke (London: German Historical Institute/Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 330. See the review of Robertson by Thomas Willette in The Journal of Modern History 67 no. 2 (1995): 458–60. In the seventeenth century Reinhard (and now others) takes the Borghese as “a paradigm” of the papal dynasty which formalized nepotistic activity: Wolfgang Reinhard, Papstfinanz und Nepotismus unter Paul V. (1605–1621): Studien und Quellen zur Struktur und zu quantitativen Aspekten des päpstlichen Herrschaftssystems (Stuttgart: Hiersemann, 1974). 73 John F. D’Amico, review of McClung Hallman, Church as Property, Renaissance and Reformation 11 no. 3 (1987): 276; this same point regarding nepotism is made in Reinhard, “Papal Power and Family Strategy,” 356. 74 Reinhard, “Papal Power and Family Strategy,” 331–2; Signorotto and Visceglia, Court and Politics, 4. 75 Reinhard, “Papal Power and Family Strategy,” 332–3.\n\n24\n\nintroduction\n\nthe activities of cardinal-nephews could be used to distance popes from unseemly extravagance and personal commemoration.76 But as historians such as Paolo Prodi have made clear, such narrow judgements are inevitable if the papacy is seen as an exception and is studied in isolation from wider developments: The polemic has always been dominated by the Reformation and by the reply which the Church of Rome gave, anticipating or confined by events, to the urgent need for renewal. The insistence on abuses and on the war against abuses as a pivot of historical reasoning demonstrates a lack of historiographical vision and an interpretative split between civil and ecclesiastical history which has prevented a true understanding of the problem.77\n\nBut Prodi’s own reconciliation of civil and ecclesiastical history has presented another, equally problematic model for the papacy. By stressing the territorial ambitions of the popes through the expansion and reinforcement of the Papal States, he aligns the history of the papacy with the history of the rise of the nation state in early modern Europe. As Anthony Wright points out, by demonstrating that in papal government, “religious priorities [were] . . . subordinated to the necessities of secular government,” Prodi’s argument becomes uncomfortably close to an important assumption for many Italian historians: the “political and economic consequences of the preservation of papal temporal government” ultimately led up to the unnecessarily painful birth of the Italian state with Rome as its capital in the nineteenth century.78 The economic, temporal, monarchical, and even military pretensions of the papacy may be usefully studied, but they should not be used to characterize the papacy in its entirety. It is a much more complex and, ultimately, paradoxical institution.
