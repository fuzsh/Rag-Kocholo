        "text": "1. History\n\nOn 21 July 1542, Pope Paul III proclaimed the Apostolic Constitution Licet ab initio, establishing the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition, staffed by cardinals and other officials whose task it was \"to maintain and defend the integrity of the faith and to examine and proscribe errors and false doctrines.\" It served as the final court of appeal in trials of heresy and served as an important part of the Counter-Reformation.\n\nThis body was renamed the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office in 1908 by Pope Pius X. In many Catholic countries, the body is often informally called the Holy Office (e.g., Italian: Sant'Uffizio and Spanish: Santo Oficio).\n\nAstronomer Galileo Galilei presented before the Holy Office, a 19th-century painting by Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury.\n\nThe congregation's name was changed to Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (SCDF) on 7 December 1965, at the end of the Second Vatican Council. Soon after the 1983 Code of Canon Law came into effect, the adjective \"sacred\" was dropped from the names of all Curial Congregations,[1] and so the dicastery adopted its current name, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\n\n1.1. Timeline\n\n1542 Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition is established \"to maintain and defend the integrity of the faith and to examine and proscribe errors and false doctrines.\" 1622 Pope Gregory XV writes a letter addressing the issue of priests abusing the confessional to solicit \"shameful and dishonorable conduct\". The letter is referenced in Sacramentum Poenitentiae (1741). 1665 The General Congregation of the Universal Inquisition, in the presence of Pope Alexander VII, reiterates that propositions by confessors to solicit or provoke sex from penitents are \"alien and discordant by the Evangelical truth and clearly so by the sixth and seventh doctrines of the Holy Fathers\" and are to be \"checked, condemned, and prohibited.\" \"The Inquisitors of Heretical Depravity, ..., [should] seek out and proceed against everyone - every priest [...] who has essayed to tempt a penitent.\"[2] 1908 The Inquisition is renamed Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office by Pope Pius X. 1965 The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office is renamed Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (SCDF). 1985 All dicasteries of the Roman Curia no longer use the adjective \"sacred\" as part of their title. The Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith becomes the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF). 1988 Pope John Paul II reaffirms the authority of the CDF on 28 June: \"The proper duty of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is to promote and safeguard the doctrine on faith and morals in the whole Catholic world; so it has competence in things that touch this matter in any way.\"[3] 2001 John Paul II issues Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela \"by which are promulgated Norms concerning the more grave delicts reserved to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\" It, again, reaffirms the CDF's responsibilities, expressing that it was necessary to define more precisely both \"the more grave delicts whether against morals or committed in the celebration of the sacraments\" for which the competence of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith remains exclusive, and also the special procedural norms \"for declaring or imposing canonical sanctions.\"[4] 2015 Francis establishes an ecclesiastical judicial commission, which will have its own staff and secretary, to try bishops, which will work with other units of the CDF and with the congregation that has oversight over the bishop.[5] 2018 Francis appoints three women as consultors to the Congregation, the first in its history.[6]\n\n2. Role\n\nAccording to the 1988 Apostolic Constitution on the Roman Curia, Pastor bonus, article 48, promulgated by John Paul II: \"The proper duty of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is to promote and safeguard the doctrine on faith and morals in the whole Catholic world; so it has competence in things that touch this matter in any way.\"[3]\n\nThis includes investigations into grave delicts, i.e., acts which the Catholic Church considers as being the most serious crimes: crimes against the Eucharist and against the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance, and crimes against the sixth Commandment (\"Thou shall not commit adultery.\") committed by a cleric against a person under the age of eighteen. These crimes, in Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela a motu proprio of 2001, come under the competency of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In effect, it is the \"promoter of justice\" which deals with, among other things, the question of priests accused of paedophilia.[4][7][8]\n\nWithin the CDF are the International Theological Commission, the Pontifical Biblical Commission, and the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei. The Prefect of the CDF is ex officio president of these commissions.\n\n3. Organization\n\nUntil 1968, the pope held the title of prefect and appointed a cardinal to preside over the meetings, first as Secretary, then as Pro-Prefect.\n\nSince 1968, the Cardinal head of the dicastery has borne the title of Prefect and the title of Secretary refers to the second highest-ranking officer of the Congregation. As of 2012 the Congregation had a membership of 18 cardinals and a smaller number of non-cardinal bishops, a staff of 38 (clerical and lay) and 26 consultors.[9]\n\nThe work of the CDF is divided into four sections: the doctrinal, disciplinary, matrimonial, and clerical offices. The CDF holds biennial plenary assemblies, and issues documents on doctrinal, disciplinary, and sacramental questions that occasionally include notifications concerning books by Catholic theologians (e.g., Hans Küng, Charles Curran, and Leonardo Boff) that it judges contrary to Church doctrine.[10]\n\n4. Recent Canonical Judgments and Publications\n\nThe following is a list of recent documents and judgments issued by the CDF. Lengthy CDF documents usually have Latin titles. A short document that briefly states objections to one or more writings by a Catholic theologian is typically called a \"notification.\"\n\n\"Doctrinal Assessment of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious\" – (Re-affirmed by Pope Francis on 15 April 2013)[11][12]\n\n\"Note on the banalization of sexuality, Regarding certain interpretations of Light of the World\" (22 December 2010)\n\n\"Circular Letter to the Presidents of the Episcopal Conferences regarding the association Opus Angelorum\" (2 October 2010)\n\nDignitas Personae (on bioethical questions, with summary and press conference transcript; 8 September 2008)\n\nOn 5 April 2008, as a result of \"grave reservations\" by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith about the Mormon practice of posthumous rebaptism, Catholic dioceses throughout the world were directed not to give information in parish registers to the Mormons' Genealogical Society of Utah for microfilming or digitizing.[13]\n\n\"Doctrinal Note on Some Aspects of Evangelization\" (with press conference transcript; 3 December 2007)\n\nOn 28 September 2007, Gaston Hebert, the then apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Little Rock, stated that (per the 11 July Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) six Arkansas nuns were excommunicated for heresy (the first in the diocese's 165-year history). They refused to recant the doctrines of the Community of the Lady of All Nations (Army of Mary). The nuns are members of the Good Shepherd Monastery of Our Lady of Charity and Refuge in Hot Springs. Sister Mary Theresa Dionne, 82, one of the six, said they will still live at the convent property, which they own. The sect believes that its 86-year-old founder, Marie Paule Giguere, is the reincarnation of the Virgin Mary.[14]\n\n\"Responses to Certain Questions of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Concerning Artificial Nutrition and Hydration\" (with commentary;

Leadership\n\n5.1. Secretaries until 1965\n\nWhen the Supreme Sacred Congregation for the Roman and Universal Inquisition was first established in 1542, it was composed of several Cardinal Inquisitors styled as \"Inquisitors-General\", who were formally equal to each other, even if some of them were clearly dominant (e.g. Cardinal Gian Pietro Carafa from 1542, who was elected Pope Paul IV in 1555). Until 1968 the Pope himself presided over the Congregation. However, from 1564 the daily administration of the affairs of the Congregation was entrusted to the Cardinal Secretary.[20][21](pp19–26) This model was retained when the Inquisition was formally renamed as the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office in 1908[22].\n\nUnless stated otherwise, the secretaryship ended with the officeholder's death.\n\nAntonio Michele Ghislieri (1564–1566; elected as Pope Pius V)[21](p118)\n\nGiacomo Savelli (1577–1587)[21](p118)\n\nGiulio Antonio Santori (1587–1602)[21](p118)\n\nCamillo Borghese (1602–1605; elected as Pope Paul V)[21](p118)\n\nPompeio Arrigoni (1605–1612; resigned, died in 1616)[21](p118)\n\nGiovanni Garzia Millini (1612–1629)[21](p118)\n\nAntonio Marcello Barberini (1629–1633; resigned; died in 1646)\n\nFrancesco Barberini (1633–1679)\n\nCesare Facchinetti (1680–1683)\n\nAlderano Cybo (1683–1700)\n\nGaleazzo Marescotti (1700–1716; resigned, died in 1726)\n\nFabrizio Spada (1716–1717)\n\nNicolò Acciaioli (1717–1719)\n\nFrancesco del Giudice (1719–1725)\n\nFabrizio Paolucci (1725–1726)\n\nPietro Ottoboni (1726–1740)\n\nTommaso Ruffo (1740–1753)\n\nNeri Maria Corsini (1753–1770)\n\nGiovanni Francesco Stoppani (1770–1774)\n\nLuigi Maria Torregiani (1775–1777)\n\nCarlo Rezzonico (1777–1799)\n\nLeonardo Antonelli (1800–1811)\n\nGiulio Maria della Somaglia (1814–1830)\n\nBartolomeo Pacca (1830–1844)\n\nVincenzo Macchi (1844–1860)\n\nCostantino Patrizi Naro (1860–1876)\n\nProspero Caterini (1876–1881)\n\nAntonio Maria Panebianco (1882–1883)\n\nLuigi Bilio, CRSP (1883–1884)\n\nRaffaele Monaco La Valletta (1884–1896)\n\nLucido Parocchi (1896–1903)\n\nSerafino Vannutelli (1903–1908) (resigned)\n\nMariano Rampolla (1908–1913)\n\nDomenico Ferrata (3 January 1914 – 10 October 1914)\n\nRafael Merry del Val (14 October 1914 – 26 February 1930)\n\nDonato Sbarretti (4 July 1930 – 1 April 1939)\n\nFrancesco Marchetti-Selvaggiani (30 April 1939 – 13 January 1951)\n\nGiuseppe Pizzardo (16 February 1951 – 12 October 1959)\n\nAlfredo Ottaviani (7 November 1959 – 7 December 1965, when he was made Pro-Prefect)\n\n5.2. Prefects since 1965\n\nWhen Pope Paul VI changed the name of the dicastery on 7 December 1965, he changed the title of the cardinal in charge of the daily administration of the Congregation from Secretary to Pro-Prefect. He continued to reserve the title of Prefect to himself[23] until 1968 when he relinquished his role as head of the Congregation and named a Prefect.[24]\n\nAlfredo Ottaviani (7 December 1965 – 6 January 1968, his retirement) Titled: Pro-Prefect[25]\n\nFranjo Šeper (8 January 1968 – 25 November 1981, his retirement)[26]\n\nJoseph Ratzinger (25 November 1981 – 2 April 2005, death of Pope John Paul II)\n\nWilliam Levada (13 May 2005 – 2 July 2012, his retirement)\n\nGerhard Ludwig Müller (2 July 2012 – 2 July 2017, appointment not renewed)[27][28]\n\nLuis Ladaria Ferrer, SJ (2 July 2017 – present)[27][28]\n\n5.3. Secretaries since 1965\n\nWith the December 1965 reorganization of the Holy Office as the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the head of the Congregation was no longer titled Secretary. The dicastery's second-in-command, until then titled assessor, was then given the title of Secretary, as was already the case with the other Roman Congregations.
