Instead James announced to the crowd that Jesus was the Christ, he sat at God’s right hand and will return in the clouds of heaven. The scribes and Pharisees then pushed James off the temple and proceeded to throw stones at him. As James prayed for the people he was clubbed in the head and died.\n\n63 Simeon, bishop of Jerusalem\n\nSimeon was the son of Clopas (mentioned in John 19:25 as the husband of Mary). Clopas was the brother of Joseph which means Simeon was Jesus’ cousin.\n\nAfter James’ death the living apostles and disciples of Jesus assembled in Jerusalem and chose Simeon to fill James’ place as bishop of the Jerusalem church.\n\nSimeon resisted the Judaizers\n\nIn 66 AD Simeon led the church out of Jerusalem to Pella as the Roman armies approached\n\n64 Rome Burns\n\nIt began the night of July 18 in the wooden shops in the SE end of the Great Circus\n\nThe fire raged for 7 nights and 6 days\n\nThen it burst out again and burnt 2 more parts of the city for 3 more days.\n\n(London’s fire of 1666 lasted 4 days; Chicago’s fire of 1871 lasted 36 hours.)\n\n10 of the 14 regions of the city were destroyed. Only 2/7 of the city was left.\n\nThe public blamed Nero.\n\nHistorians blame Nero and his ambitions to rebuild Rome as Neropolis\n\nTo escape responsibility Nero blamed an already suspicious group, Christians\n\nTacitus: “a vast multitude” were put to death in the most shameful manner:\n\nChristians were crucified\n\nChristians were sewed up in skins of wild beast and exposed to dogs in arena\n\nChristians were covered with pitch or oil, nailed to post to be lit for street lights\n\nWithin a year Peter was arrested and crucified upside down along w/ his wife\n\nIn the spring of 68 Paul was led out on the Ostian Way and beheaded.\n\nOn June 9, 68 Nero committed suicide by stabbing himself in the throat.\n\nAnti-Christian Logic of Roman Empire\n\nThe Christians were despised and persecuted by the Romans for what the Roman Empire considered very logical reasons:\n\nRomans considered the state the highest good. The Christians obeyed the state but held to a higher law and a higher good.\n\nNew religions were illegal and not permitted. Old, traditional religions were allowed to continue. Once Christianity was distinguished as a separate religion from Judaism it was illegal. If a Christian were of high rank in society they were banished, if they were of a lower social rank they were executed. This may be why John the Apostle was exiled instead of executed.\n\nRome was old and had their traditional values. Christianity was bringing in new values that would undermine the traditions and the gods that had made Rome great.\n\nRoman religion was done with altars, images (idols), sacrifices and temples. The Christians had none of these since their religion was internal. The Christians appeared to have no God and were considered atheists by the Romans.\n\nThe Christians refused emperor worship and instead worship what the Romans considered was a rival king, Jesus.\n\nThe Romans accepted many Gods but the Christians only worshipped Jesus.\n\nChristians considered all men equal but the Roman Empire enforced slavery.\n\nChristians believed that all men should work to eat, but most Romans had slaves working and even preparing the food.\n\nThe spread of Christianity interfered with the sale of household idols which interrupted a major business in many Roman cities.\n\nRome knew the importance of family but some families were divided when one or more of their members became a Christian.\n\nThe Christians began meeting in secret to avoid public speculation and interference, but this only made the Christians look more secretive and suspicious.\n\nThe public’s misunderstanding of the Lord’s Supper led to the rumor that the Christians practice cannibalism.\n\nThe practice of magic was illegal. The Christians appeared to practice magic with healing, casting out of demons and reading their magic books (scripture).\n\nSoon the problems in the Roman empire were blamed on the Christians for having led the Roman population away from the traditional gods that had made Rome great.\n\n90-117 Asian and Roman Persecution\n\nApostle was sent to Patmos during this persecution\n\nEmperor Domitian persecuted Jews for refusing to pay a poll tax for pagan temple\n\nSince Christians were considered part of Jewish faith they also were persecuted.\n\nDuring this time the governor of Bithynia (Asia Minor) wrote Emperor Trajan asking for advice concerning treatment of Christians. He says: “This superstition (Christianity) had spread in the villages and rural areas as well as in the larger cities to such an extent that the temples had been almost deserted and the sellers of sacrificial animals impoverished.” Trajan responsed to him by saying that if a person denies being a Christian to let them go. If they confess to being a Christian after being asked three times they were to be killed, unless they recanted and worshipped the Roman gods.\n\n30-100 Clement of Rome\n\nKnew and worked with Paul. Mentioned in Philippians 4:3\n\nAccording to Origen he was a disciple of the apostles.\n\nIrenaeus writes: “He had the preaching of the apostles still echoing in his ears and their doctrine in front of his eyes.”\n\nLearned to use Septuagint from Paul and Luke\n\nHe wrote a letter from Rome to the Corinthians called “First Clement. It had been referred to by other writers but was not discovered until the 1600’s\n\nClement writes after Domitian persecution about 98\n\nClement writes the Corinthians because the church had overthrown the church’s leadership.\n\nClement appeals to the Word of God as final authority and refers to 1 Cor. 1:10\n\nClement gives testimony to: Trinity, divinity of Christ, salvation only by Christ, necessity of repentance, necessity of faith, justification by grace, sanctification by Holy Spirit, unity of the church, fruit of the Spirit.\n\nClement is the pastor of Rome and knows no higher office\n\nHe writes his book in the name of the church not in the name of his office\n\nClement writes to a church of apostolic foundation with a tone of authority and thus reveals how easily and innocent the papacy began.\n\n100 years after his death this same position in the same church will take authority and will excommunicate whole churches for much smaller differences\n\n63-107 Simeon, bishop of Jerusalem\n\nSimeon, son of Clophas (Joseph’s brother), was chosen in 63 to be the new bishop of Jerusalem by the surviving apostles and disciples of Jesus\n\nAs Roman armies approached Jerusalem in 66 Simeon led the Jerusalem church across the Jordan into Pella in the Decapolis to save them.\n\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem, Simeon led the Christians back across the Jordan to the defeated city of Jerusalem, built a church and won many Jewish converts.\n\nIn order to prevent another revolt after the fall of Jerusalem Emperor Vespasian ordered the death of anyone who was a descendant of David. Simeon escaped\n\nEmperor Domitian (81-96) followed up on the order to execute the line of David and was informed that there were grandsons of Jesus’ brother Jude. They were ordered to appear before Domitian. When Domitian saw how simple and poor they were he allowed them to live and considered them to be no threat.\n\nSimeon was later killed in 107 at the age of about 120 when Trajan gave a similar order to execute the line of David.\n\n117 Ignatius\n\nPastor of church in Antioch\n\nContemporary pastor with Clement in Rome, Simeon in Jerusalem, Polycarp in Smyrna\n\nAntioch was a doorway to Gentile world and so became a seat of heretical tendencies which forced Antioch to develop sound doctrine and organize quickly\n\nIgnatius was tried in Antioch before Emperor Trajan and sent to Rome in chains for martyrdom in the Coliseum by being thrown to the lions.\n\nOn his way to Rome he wrote seven letters that we still have: Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans, Philadelphians, Smyrneans, and one to Polycarp, the Pastor in Smyrna.\n\nThese are some quotes from those letters:\n\n“I would rather die for Christ than rule the whole earth.”\n\n“It is glorious to go down in the world, in order to go up into God.”\n\n“Leave me to the beasts, that I may by them be made partaker of God. Rather fawn upon the beasts, that they may be to me a grave, and leave nothing of my body, that, when I sleep, I may not be burdensome to anyone. Then will I truly be a disciple of Christ, when the world can no longer even see my body.”\n\nHis remains were brought back to Antioch.\n\nIgnatius’ attitude toward martyrdom exceeds the genuine apostolic resignation which is equal willing to depart or remain. He degenerates into morbid fanaticism. This is an age when martyrdom was sought and glorified.\n\n70-155 Polycarp\n\nKnew the apostles and was one of John’s disciples\n\nJohn placed his as the bishop of Smyrna.\n\nHe had trained Irenaeus and was friends with Ignatius and Papias.\n\nHe was captured as an 86 year old man and burnt at the stake in Smyrna.\n\nHis last days, capture, and death are recorded in the letter “The martyrdom of Polycarp”\n\nDisciples of the Apostles and Early Bishops\n\nIn Ephesus\n\nIn Jerusalem\n\nIn Antioch\n\nIn Rome\n\nPaul placed Timothy in position in Ephesus\n\nJohn, the apostle, arrived from Jerusalem in 66 AD\n\nPolycarp (70-155) was a disciple of John. He was the bishop in Smyrna, near Ephesus. Polycarp trained and sent Irenaeus (115-202) to Gaul (France) and Irenaeus trained Hippolytus (170-236) who went to Rome to oppose the bishop.\n\nPapias, was a bishop in Hierapolis (by Colosse and near Ephesus). Papias’ book Sayings of the Lord has been lost but is heavily quoted by early church writers.\n\nIgnatius was appointed to Antioch\n\nPolycrates, (130-196), was the 8th bishop of Ephesus. He knew Polycarp and Irenaeus. Wrote to the Roman bishop Victor concerning Easter and was cut off from the Roman church until Irenaeus interceded.\n\nJames, the Lord’s brother, was killed in 63 AD\n\nSimeon, the son of Clopas, followed James as bishop of Jerusalem\n\nJustus\n\nZacchaeus\n\nTobias\n\nBenjamin\n\nJohn\n\nMatthias\n\nPhilip\n\nSeneca\n\nJustus II\n\nLevi\n\nEphres\n\nJoseph\n\nJudas, (died 148) of the family of Jesus, the 15th bishop and last Hebrew bishop because in 135 AD Hadrian put down a Jewish revolt and Jews were forbidden to enter Jerusalem\n\nMarcus, the first gentile bishop of Jerusalem\n\nCassian, and the list continues. . .\n\nFirst Paul and Peter\n\nEvodius a pagan convert of Peter led the church of Antioch\n\nIgnatius was the third bishop of Antioch until the time of Trajan in 117 AD. According to Eusebius Peter appointed him.\n\nHeron, (107-127)\n\nCornelius, (127-154)\n\nEros, (154-169)\n\nTheophilus, (169-182), wrote books, we still have his Apology to Autolycum. Born a pagan but became a Christian by reading Scriptures. Kept Gnostics out of Antioch\n\nMaximus I, (182-191)\n\nSerapion, (191-211), wrote several works, including a pamphlet against the Gospel of Peter.\n\nLinus of 2 Tim. 4:21 led church in Rome. Irenaeus says apostles placed him\n\nCletus killed by Domitian\n\nClement, in Phil.4:3 exiled and martyred around 98.\n\nEvaristus, 100-109\n\nAlexander I, holy water introduced, made additions to liturgy. Beheaded by Trajan.\n\nSixtas, ruled during Emperor Hadrian\n\nTelesphorus, (125-136) listed celebrating Easter on Sunday not Passover; martyred\n\nHyginus, organized ranks and positions in church; Gnostics Valentine & Cerdo came to Rome.\n\nPius I, born a slave; brother, Hermas, wrote Shepherd; Excommunicated Marcion (142-155)\n\nAnicetus, (155-166) visited by Polycarp concerning Easter; Manichaeism; martyred.\n\nSoter, wrote to Corinth, martyred\n\nEleutherius (174-189) – dealt with Montanism\n\nVictor I, (189-198), asserted Roman Church authority; imposed Roman’s Easter date by threatening excommunication; Latin replaced Greek.\n\n150 Gnosticism\n\nIts roots go back to the days of Paul and John. Both seem to deal with the false concepts in Colossians and 1 John.\n\nChristian tradition connects the founding of it to Simon Magus, who Peter rebukes in Acts\n\nGnosticism sprang from the natural desire of humans to explain the origin of evil.\n\nSince evil can be associated with matter and flesh, the Gnostics tried to develop a philosophical system to disassociate God, who is spirit, from evil, matter and flesh.\n\nThe second question it sought to answer was the origin of man. They did this by combining Greek philosophy and Christian theology. The Corinthians did this and were rebuked in First Corinthians 1 and 2.\n\nIf the Gnostics had succeeded Christianity would have been reduced to a philosophical system.\n\nDualism was one of their main statements of faith. The Gnostics insisted on a clear distinction between material and spiritual and a distinction between evil and good. Their conclusion: God could not have created the world.\n\nThe gap between the world and God was bridged by a series of emanations that formed a hierarchy.\n\nOne of these, known as Jehovah of the Old Testament, had rebelled and created the world. The Gnostics did not like the God of the Old Testament.\n\nTo explain Jesus Christ they embraced a doctrine known as Docetism. Docetism teaches that since matter is evil Jesus did not have a human body. Either he was a phantom or the spirit of Christ came on the man Jesus between his baptism but left before his death.\n\nSalvation might begin with faith, but is only for the soul.\n\nThe special knowledge (gnosis) that Christ exposed while here was of far greater benefit.\n\nIrenaeus refutes gnosticism in “Against Heresies”\n\nIn 140 Marcion went to Rome and embraced gnosticism and developed it. Marcion was the first to develop a New Testament canon that he could use to match his Gnostic doctrine. This caused the church to begin to recognize certain books as scripture and others as less than God-breathed.\n\n126-203 Irenaeus\n\nNative of Asia Minor\n\nAs a youth he had seen and heard Polycarp in Smyrna.\n\nHe mentions Papias frequently and must have known him\n\nBecame bishop of Lyons, Gaul (Spain) when the bishop died in persecution\n\nLyons was a missionary church of Asia Minor\n\nLived in Lyons during the persecution of 177\n\nTook a letter to the Roman bishop Eleutherus from the confessors\n\nRoman Bishop Victor was complelling the Asian churches to celebrate Easter on a different date.\n\nIrenaeus tried to protect Asian churches from Roman Bishops pretensions and aggression\n\nRoman Bishop Victor cut them off from communion.\n\nIrenaus says earlier Roman bishops didn’t demand agreement on this issue.\n\nIrenaus appeals to other bishops for support.\n\nIrenaus was martyred under Emperor Septimius Severus\n\n190-194 Easter Conflict\n\n150-155, Smyrna Bishop Polycarp visits Rome Bishop Anicetus. The issue comes up, is not resolved, Polycarp departs in peace saying this is how he celebrated Easter with John\n\n170, the same controversy develops in Laodicea but is dealt with in peace\n\n190-194, Rome Bishop Victor requires the Asian churches to abandon their Easter practices. The new Ephesian Bishop Polycrates appeals with a letter which is still in existence today. Victor wouldn’t listen, calls them heretics, excommunicates them and would not send them communion elements. Irenaeus interecedw by quoting Colossians 2:16: “The apostles have ordered that we should, ‘Judge no one in meat or in drink, or in respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabath day.’ ”\n\nThe time of the Jewish Passover and the Easter fast created a violent controversy\n\nThe issue becomes complicated and is not yet cleared up\n\nThe issue was purely ritualistic and involved no doctrine\n\nToo much stress was laid on external uniformity\n\nAsia Minor’s views:\n\nFollowed Jewish chronology\n\nFollowed John and Philip’s example\n\nThey celebrated the Christian for of the Passover on Nisan 14 and at the end of the day they broke their Easter fast with communion and the Love Feast\n\nRoman Church view:\n\nAppealed to early custom of celebrating Jesus death on a Friday\n\nCelebrated Easter always on a Sunday after the March full moon\n\nNearly all the churches did it this way\n\nThe Roman practice created an entire holy week of fasting to recall Lord’s suffering\n\nThe Problem to the Roman Church: Part of the universal church was celebrating and feasting the Lord’s resurrection while another part of the world church was still fasting his death.\n\nThe Nicean Council of 325 established as a law for the whole church by saying:\n\n“Easter should be celebrated on the first Sunday after the first full moon succeeding the vernal equinox (March 21). If the full moon occurs on a Sunday, Easter-day is the Sunday after. Easter can be anywhere from\n\nMarch 22 to April 25.” -Nicean Council of 325\n\nThe last trace of the “heretics” from Asia was seen in the 500’s AD\n\n100-165 Justin Martyr\n\nA Christian apologist trained in philosophy (Stoicism and Platonism) and became a Christian.\n\nHe became the most notable writer of this century\n\nHe was born in Palestine and searched energetically for truth as a young man in philosophical schools. While meditating alone by the sea side one day he was approached by an old man who exposed the weaknesses of his thinking and pointed him to the Jewish prophets who bore witness to Christ.\n\nJustin took this new faith back into the philosophical schools.\n\nHis writings vigorous and earnest. They are written under the threat of persecution and are an urgent appeal to reason.\n\nHe wrote “First Apology” to the Emperor Antoninus Pius (138-161) to clear away prejudice and misunderstanding about Christianity.\n\nIn his “Dialogue with Trypho” he recounts an actual encounter in Ephesus with a Jew who accused Christians of breaking the Jewish law and worshipping a man. The debate was conducted with respect and courtesy on both sides, despite strong disagreement.\n\nHe opened a school in Rome.\n\nJustin was martyred in Rome about 165\n\n140-160 Marcion\n\nFrom Pontus on the Black Sea, Marcion arrived in Rome in 140.\n\nHe made a fortune as a shipowner\n\nHis father was a bishop and excommunicated him.\n\nMarcion believed that the God of the Old Testament was different from the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nMarcion taught that the God of the OT was unknowable and sheer justice. The God of the NT was revealed and was loving and gracious.\n\nThe church of Rome excommunicated him in 144.\n\nJustin Martyr said Marcion was aided by the devil to blaspheme and den that God was the creator.\n\nTertullian wrote “Against Marcion” about 207 and called him a formidable foe of true Christian doctrine.\n\nMarcion stated that Jesus was notborn of a woman but suddenly appeared in the synagogue at Capernaum in 29 AD.\n\nHe taught that since creation was not the work of the true God the body must be denied.\n\nMarcion recognized Polycarp in Rome in 155 and Polycarp replied, “I recognize you as the firstborn of Satan.”\n\nThe followers of Marcion were called Marcionites. Constantine absolutely forbade their meeting for worship. Most were absorbed into newer heretical teaching of Mani and Manicheism. There were reports of them in the 400’s. The council at Trullo 692 made provision for the reconciliation of Marcionites. There was lingering remains as late as the 900’s.\n\nKEY POINTS (back to the top)\n\nOTHER SITES (back to the top)\n\nRoman Emperors\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_Emperors\n\nhttp://www.roman-emperors.org/impindex.htm\n\nList of Popes with links to each Pope\n\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12272b.htm\n\nA Cross Reference Table of the Development of the Canon of the New Testament.
