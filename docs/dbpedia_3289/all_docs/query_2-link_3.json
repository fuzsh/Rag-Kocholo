While on his way to Paris, he stopped in Avignon to calm down the tumult between the nobility and the people that was affecting that city. He succeeded to the satisfaction of both parties. Nuncio Corsini had been named to replace Nicolò Guidi di Bagno, who had been recalled to Rome by Pope Innocent X because of suspicions that he was too deferent to Cardinal Giulio Mazzarino. The French court was upset because it had not been notified before the appointment. Nuncio Corsini was detained in a monastery in Marseille and Nuncio Bagno was asked to continue in his post by the king. The pope distrusted the latter so much that in rarissimi casi valevasi dell'opera e ministero di lui. The situation lasted until the end of 1656.\n\n(25) 7.
