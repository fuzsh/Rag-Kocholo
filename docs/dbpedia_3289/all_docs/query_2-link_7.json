According to Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii et Recientoris Aevi. Volumen III (1503-1592). (Münich : Sumptibus et Typis Librariae Regensbergianae, 1935; reprint, Padua : Il Messagero di S. Antonio, 1960), p. 27, n. 12, the pope created, reserved in pectore and never published an uncertain number of cardinals.\n\nNote 3. The reference to Francisco de Mendoza y Pacheco as a cardinal has been documented since ancient times. González Dávila already calls him a cardinal-elect. We owe its news to an article by Francisco Juan Martínez Rojas (Anotaciones al episcopologio giennense de los SS XV y XVI, Boletín del Instituto de Estudios Giennenses, nº 177, 2001) who cites, among others, González Palencia (Vida y obras de Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 1943) or Ibáñez de Segovia (Historia [handwritten] de la Casa de Mondéjar), but above all it is based on a letter (May 1545) by Francisco de los Cobos recommending Emperor Charles V to propose Diego Hurtado de Mendoza as a cardinal, arguing that Pope Paul III would grant it, since the one made to the bishop of Jaén had an effect (his brother). González Palencia affirms that he would have been created in pectore in the consistory of June 2, 1542.\n\nNote 4. The story of the secret creation and presentation to the conclave of 1549 of Bernardino della Croce, B., is recorded by Francesco Cancellieri Descrizione delle cappelle pontificie e cardinalizie di tutto l'anno e de' concistori pubblici e segreti da aggiungnersi a quella de' tre pontificali, e delle funzioni della settimana santa, pubblicata in altri due tometti. Si premette una descrizione storico-critica delle sale regie, e ducale, e delle cappelle Paoline, e Sistina, del Vaticano, e del Quirinale, presso Luigi Perego Salvioni stampator vaticano, 1790. It is doubtful that he was, as they say, general treasurer, not appearing in Francesco Vitale's work (Memorie istoriche dei Tesorerieri generali pontifici, Napoli, 1772) his secret creation, if true, would probably date to the consistory of April 8, 1549.\n\nDecember 19, 1544 (VIII)\n\n(48) 1.
