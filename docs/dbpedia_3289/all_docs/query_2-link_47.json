The Lord was not contented with having raised him to this height of charity, and given him so remarkable a spirit of prayer. It was his good pleasure to exalt him to penetrate the ineffable secrets of the Divine Greatness in wonderful ecstasies and raptures, which were of frequent occurrence during the whole of his life; although, out of humility, he used every means and tried every artifice to avoid them, even doing violence to himself for that end.\n\nIn consequence of an important cause, which they had at that time before the Pope, the Dominican fathers had the devotion of the Forty Hours at their convent of the Minerva, and Philip, together with Francesco Maria Tarugi and some others, was there by invitation. While he was kneeling in one of the remotest parts of the church, praying fervently, he fell all at once into an ecstasy, and remained with his eyes fixed on the Blessed Sacrament, his face slightly smiling, and the rest of his body perfectly motionless. The prior, Fra. Angelo Diaceti, who was afterwards bishop of Fiesole, and a great friend of Philip, noticed it, and in company with another friar went to him, and called him several times; they then touched him, and found him as cold as ice. Thinking that some accident had happened to him, they carried him to a cell in the novitiate, where, after he had remained a long while in that state, he returned to himself, and cried out, Victory! victory! our prayer is heard. The prior, in great astonishment, begged him earnestly to explain the cause of the change that had come over him, and what that victory was of which he spoke. The Saint at first made a great difficulty of explaining anything; but at last, being prevailed upon by the priors reiterated petitions, he said, Well, the business for which we have had this devotion has succeeded, and we have been heard. When he was questioned more narrowly about his ecstasy, he said that he had seen Jesus Christ in the consecrated host, giving benediction with His most holy hand to all those who were present at the devotion; and that they should therefore thank God for the victory they had gained. It was observed, that at the very moment in which the Saint returned to himself, the Pope had given sentence in favour of the Dominicans, in the cause for which they had exposed the Blessed Sacrament, and had the devotion of the Forty Hours.\n\nFabrizio de Massimi, going one morning to confession to him, found the door of his room closed; and opening it very softly, he saw the Saint in the act of praying, raised upon his feet, his eyes looking to heaven, and his hands uplifted, and making many gestures. He stood for a while watching him, and then going close to him, he saluted him. The Saint, although he had his face towards him, so that he could easily see him, and could not naturally have avoided seeing him, did in fact neither see him nor return him any answer. Fabrizio, struck with this, looked at him again, feeling himself no little devotion from simply beholding Philip in this state of abstraction, which lasted about eight minutes longer. When Philip came to himself and perceived that Fabrizio was present, he asked him how he had got in; he replied, that he had not found the door bolted; whereupon, without another word, the Saint heard his confession. Francesco della Molara also going one morning to confession to him, found the door open, and the Saint sitting praying. Francesco knelt down before him to confess, when he perceived that the servant of God was in an ecstasy, and it was a quarter of an hour before he came to himself.\n\nAnother time he was in the chapel of the Visitation, one of his favourite haunts, because he was particularly fond of Baroccis picture which is there; and sitting down, according to his custom, upon a little seat, he passed unawares into a most sweet ecstasy. Some women, his penitents, who were at no great distance, saw this, and went up to him, and after having looked at him for a while, they called him, and shook him so vehemently that he came to himself. But Philip, disliking of all things to be observed when enjoying these divine favours, got up, and began to cry out, and call Father Antonio to send those women away, because they were annoying him, and would not let him alone; and he pretended to be in a violent passion; and all this was merely an artifice to destroy the good opinion they might have formed of him from finding him in an ecstasy.\n\nPaolo Ricuperati, a prelate of both the Segnature, and one of the holy fathers familiar friends, went one evening to confession to him at San Girolamo, and found him at supper with Messer Giovanni Animuccia. Philip rose from table and heard his confession, and in putting his hands on his head to give him absolution, went into arm ecstasy and remained motionless. He remained in this state for a considerable time, to the astonishment of the prelate and Animuccia, who was also an eye-witness of it; and when at last he came to himself, he gave him absolution: and the like happened to many other of his penitents, as the time of the hearing of confessions was frequently to him the time of these heavenly favours.\n\nAbout the year 1585, Father Antonio Gallonio found Philip in bed one morning apparently almost dead. The medical men were immediately summoned; they applied a hot iron to his head, blisters to his arms, and other remedies to the shoulders. Nothing, however, seemed to rouse him, or do him any good; and F. Giovan Francesco Bordino gave him Extreme Unction; but one of the fathers saying Credo, Credo, the Saint came to himself, and said in an audible voice, What Credo, Credo is this? and then opened his eyes, looked round on all of them weeping; and when some of them said, Father, you have been very ill, he answered, Nay, I have had no other illness than the one you have provided me with. They found afterwards that it was no fit, but an ecstasy; and it was perhaps because of these frequent ecstasies that he used repeatedly to say in bidding them good night after he was in bed, Go away, and if you find me dead to-morrow morning, bury me. At mass his ecstasies were frequent, as we learn from those who served, and especially Cardinal Ottavio Paravicino, who, when young, served the Saints mass for twenty years, though not continuously. He also found it so difficult to prevent himself going into an ecstasy, when he was in the presence of the Pope, because of the interior movements which it caused in his heart, that whenever he was going to see his Holiness he used to say to the fathers, Now pray for me, that I may not commit some foolery or other.\n\nHe was often seen with his whole body raised in the air; and among others Paolo Sfondrato, Cardinal of S. Cecilia, saw him in prayer raised several spans from the ground, indeed almost to the ceiling, as he told Paul V. a little time before he died. Giovanni Battista Modio was on one occasion so grievously ill, that his death was hourly expected, and he had already lost his speech and senses. At this juncture the holy father came to visit him, as he was a friend of the family. He stayed a little while with him, and then retired into a solitary room to pray for him. When midnight was passed some of those who wore attending the sick man began to wonder where Philip had retired, and they found him with his body raised entirely up into the air, and with rays of glory all around him. When they saw him in this state, they cried out, Come here quickly, come here quickly; and all the attendants, hearing, ran to the spot, and they saw him raised from the ground to such a height that his head almost touched the ceiling, while a glory of rays shone all round him. In about half an hour Philip came to himself, and went to the invalid in great joy, and laying his hand on his head, said to him, Keep up your heart, you will not die; at that instant the power of speech returned to the sick man, and he began to converse with the Saint on various topics as distinctly as if he had not been ill at all, and in a few days he had entirely recovered.\n\nFather Gregorio Ozes, the Dominican, declared that before he entered religion he also had seen Philip raised in the air, and with a resplendent light around him. But the Saint was not only seen raised in this manner in private places, or by one or few persons at once; even in churches and public places he was, against his own will and endeavours, carried off into these ecstasies. On one occasion he was praying in S. Peters, at the tombs of the apostles, and his whole body was seen to rise all at once into the air, and with his clothes gathered up, as they had been when he was kneeling, and then to descend with equal suddenness; while he, fearing lest he should have been observed, fled away with the utmost rapidity. The same thing happened in many other churches, so that when he entered a church in company with others, he used to stay a very little time, but merely say a Pater and an Ave, and then rise from his knees, to prevent the possibility of his going into an ecstasy.\n\nWhen he was saying mass he was repeatedly raised into the air, and several persons took particular notice of it. At Torre di Specehi some of the nuns saw him three or four palms above the ground during mass; and a little girl, who was at his mass at San Girolamo, saw him about two palms from the ground, and turning to her mother said with childish simplicity, Mother, I think that father there is possessed with a bad spirit; look at him, how he stays in the air! but the mother replied, Hold your tongue, it is a Saint in an ecstasy. Sulpizia Sirleti, one of his penitents, seeing him raised into the air on one occasion, said within herself, Surely this father is possessed, else he would never stay in the air in this way. Going afterwards to confession to him, she was ashamed to mention this suspicion to the Saint, and began, Father, I have said, and then stopped, not having courage to finish her sentence. But Philip said to her, Go on, you silly creature; you have been finding fault with me, eh? that is it, is it not? She said it was, and he asked her further what it was; Sulpizia answered, The other morning, when your Reverence was saying mass, and was raised above the ground - Philip hearing this much put his finger on his mouth and said, Hush, hush; but she added, Then I said in my heart, O dear! this father is possessed. At these words Philip burst out laughing, and repeated several times, interruptedly, in his usual way, True, I am possessed.\n\nSometimes when he was saying mass he was seen with rays of glory round his head. In the first year of the pontificate of Sixtus V., Aurelio Bacci, a Sienese, saw Philip saying mass at the high altar of our church, and as soon as he began the Memento of the Living, he saw him with a splendour round his head, of the colour of gold, but more gleaming, about four fingers wide all round, and in the shape of a diadem. Aurelio, thinking it might perhaps be some defect in his own vision, turned himself several times in order to change the point of view, and then looked again, but still he saw the same thing distinctly. He rubbed his eyes with his hands and his pocket handkerchief, and looking at the heads of other people he saw nothing of the kind, but turning again to Philip, he saw the glory as plain as before, and it lasted until the holy father had communicated.\n\nAnother time when he was saying mass at San Girolamo, a little girl about twelve years old, saw him raised in the air, and surrounded by a most white and resplendent cloud, which covered him all over; and although his vestments were red, or of some other colour, not white, yet he appeared all white and shining, and remained in this for half a quarter of an hour; and this same thing happened more than once. Muzio Achillei, a. priest of San Severino, and Philips penitent, also saw the Saint saying mass with his face shining like bright gold.\n\nWhen Vincenzo Lanteri, the Archbishop of Ragusa, was young, Philip used to pull his hair and box his ears whenever he met him; and one day Vincenzo, meeting him in the street, and fearing lest he should do the same in public, determined to be beforehand with him, and going up to him, took his hand and kissed it reverently; and in taking it he perceived it all gold colour, and shining with rays that seemed to come from the middle of it. Wondering whether this could come from any natural cause, he looked about him, and saw that the air was thick, and no sunshine to be seen any where; full of wonder and perplexity, he went immediately to Chiesa Nuova, and related the whole matter to Father Tommaso Bozzio, who confirmed him in his belief that it was supernatural, and told him that many had seen Philips hand as it were all of gold. But to relate all the matters of this kind, with his ecstasies and raptures, would only weary the reader, both from the sameness and the number of the instances.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPHILIPS VISIONS.\n\nBesides these ecstasies and ravishments of spirit, Philip was favoured with many visions and apparitions; indeed they were so frequent that they occurred almost every night. A few only shall be related here, sufficient to show the reader how this glorious Saint, whose mind and heart were continually in heaven, was favoured by God with heavenly visits and unearthly consolations.\n\nOn one occasion before he was ordained priest, or had come to any determination about a state of life, he was praying with particular fervour, that he might know the will of God about it. It was in the morning just at sunrise, and as he was praying, the glorious precursor of Christ, S. John the Baptist, appeared to him. He was so filled with devotion at this apparition, that the usual trembling came over him, and after he had remained in rapture for some time, the vision disappeared, leaving him in great spiritual fervour and most burning love; and from certain things in the apparition, he told Cardinal Frederic Borromeo that he gathered it to be the will of God that he should live in Rome for the good of others in poverty, and a special detachment from every thing. The same thing was signified to him in another vision which he had of two blessed souls, while he was at prayer.\n\nOne of them had a hard roll in his hand, which he appeared to be eating without any other food. Philip seeing this, and wishing to know the meaning of it, heard those words, God wishes that you should live in the middle of Rome, as if you were in a desert, abstaining from eating flesh, so far as may be allowable for you. This he observed perseveringly to the day of his death, eating meat very seldom, and then rather out of condescension to the will of others, or because of illness; otherwise he used to abstain from it, assigning as a reason that it did not agree with him. These visions, in addition to what Father Agostino Ghettini of the Tre Fontane said to him, and which we have already narrated, put Philips mind completely at ease regarding his state of life, and filled him with an inward contentment and clearness of mind which never left him during the whole course of his life.\n\nAnother time, after he was a priest, he was praying on Christmas night with Costanzo Tassone, and Sebastiano, the musician whom we have spoken of before; and in the fervour of his prayer he saw Christ appear upon the altar in the form of a child; whereupon, turning to his companions, he said, Do you not see Christ the Child upon the altar? They answered, No; and he, perceiving that the favour was granted to him only, held his peace and went on with his prayer. Once as when he was saying mass, Cesare Tomasi of Ripatransona, his penitent, observed that at the elevation, after he had laid the host down, he remained a long time as in ecstasy before the elevation of the chalice; and that after mass he returned to the sacristy with a joyous and smiling countenance. Cesare afterwards asked him why he had been so long at the elevation, and why he had come back into the sacristy so joyous; the Saint laid his hand on his head and smiled, but gave him no answer; but his penitent growing importunate, and asking him over and over again, Philip at last reluctantly told him that some times at mass after the consecration, God was pleased to show him the glory of Paradise in a vision; but he begged him not to tell this to any one else.\n\nHe had also the consolation of seeing the souls of many, and particularly of his friends and penitents, go into heaven. Mario Tosini, one of the first of the company of the Santissima Trinità, a man of singular goodness, and whose life has been written by Bonsignor Cacciaguerra, appeared to Philip immediately after his death, about midnight, and in great joy. He called twice with a loud voice, Philip, Philip, and the Saint, lifting his eyes to heaven, saw the soul of Mario, all bright and resplendent, enter into Paradise. The following morning he heard the news of his death, and found upon inquiry, that he had expired at the very the the vision appeared. The Saint himself related this to some of his spiritual children, when conversing with them about the goodness of that servant of God, and he said that human language could never express the beauty of a justified soul.\n\nVincenzo Miniatore, also one of the first brothers of the Santissima Trinità, and his penitent, a man of great perfection, appeared to him immediately after his death, all glorious, and Philip saw him ascend to heaven surrounded with splendour. In the morning he went to console the widow, and said to her, Your husband knocked at my door last night, and recommended you and all your family to my care you need be under no uneasiness about him; he is gone to Paradise; and from that time the holy father always assisted the family in its necessities, as has been mentioned elsewhere.\n\nMarco Antonio Corteselli of Como, cashier of the bank of the Cevoli, one of his spiritual children, the most dear to him, and a man very much given to prayer and works of mercy, and who for many years transacted the business of the Capuchins for them, passed to a better life and the Saint went with Father Antonio Gallonio and another priest to see his body which was in Santa Caterina close to S. Girolamo della Carità. After having looked at it for a long time with great attention, he made a painter take a portrait of it; the priest wondering at this, Gallonio told him he need not be surprised, for that Philip had said, The soul of Corteselli appeared to me last night all luminous, and remained conversing with me for about four or five hours, and after that was borne up to heaven by angels, and his presence filled the whole room with a resplendent brightness. Corteselli had as great an esteem for Philip, as Philip for him, and talking one day with Paolo Maji, a priest, and procurator of the Sacred Penitentiary, he said of Philip, as if in the spirit of prophecy, Messer Paolo, this good father is not known, and some think him an ordinary man; but he will be well known when he is dead.\n\nFabrizio de Massimi had a daughter about thirteen years old, whose name was Elena. This child was most fervent in the love of Christ, and most obedient to her director in the least particular; she wept bitterly over our Lords Passion, communicated at least three times a week, and that with abundance of tears, and had such a relish and appetite for prayer, that it seemed like the very food that sustained her. She had a mean opinion of herself, preferring every one to herself, and she had an extreme desire to suffer, that she might in some measure be conformed to our Saviours Passion. In her last illness, when Baronius took her the holy communion, after she had communicated, she saw Jesus Christ shedding His Precious Blood into her soul; and at last, having already foreseen her death, she passed away to heaven with signs of the greatest devotion. No sooner had she breathed her last, than Philip heard the angels singing, and saw them, as he himself told Baronius, carrying the little virgins soul to Paradise as they sang, and Baronius says the Saint called it a Hebrew song.\n\nIn fact, those who were most intimate with Philip, held it for certain, that none of his spiritual children died without his being certified of the state of their souls. Besides the apparitions already mentioned, the same happened at the deaths of Lavinia de Rustici, the first wife of Fabrizio de Massimi, of Sister Elena and Sister Scholastica, her daughters, who were at Torre di Specchi, of Patrizio Patrizi, and of Virgilio Crescenzi; for consoling the sons of this last, he said, Do not make yourselves unhappy; your father is in Paradise, and I tell you that I know it, and He repeated these words several times over. Many other instances of a like nature might be mentioned; and Cardinal Frederic Borromeo says, that Philip in talking with him about this very matter, spoke of it as an ordinary and usual thing with him; and it was so well known that God had given him this gift of knowing the condition of departed souls, especially of his own penitents, that Father Giovanni Antonio Lucci, when his mother was dead, begged him to pray that he might know the state of her soul; and Philip after his prayer said, Be of good cheer; your mother is in heaven, and Giovanni hearing this wept in the joy of his heart. He told him the same of his father when he died, and giving him the reason, said, Because the same thing has happened as in the case of my own fathers death; whence we may gather, that Philips father had gone to heaven, and we may believe this to be owing to the prayers and merit of such a son. Whenever conversation turned on the beauty of souls, he used to speak as a man would do who was accustomed to such visions, and it was a common phrase with him, it is impossible to describe the beauty of a soul that has died in the grace of the Lord.\n\nWe have already had several times to mention Giovanni Animuccia, one of the Saints spiritual children, a musician and chapel master at S. Peters, who used to go every day to the Oratory to sing after the sermons, taking several other singers with him. He was a man of such purity, that after he had put himself under Philips direction, he lived with his wife as though she had been his sister. During his life he was extremely harassed by scruples; but in his last sickness it pleased God to free him from them entirely, so that he died in the greatest peace and joyfulness. One evening, about three years after his death, about an hour before the Ave, when the sermons were over, he appeared to a certain Alfonso, a Portuguese, and a friend of his, and asked him if the Oratory was finished. His friend replied that it was, forgetting at the moment that Animuccia was dead. Animuccia added, I beg you will speak to Father Philip, and ask him to pray for me, and then disappeared. The Portuguese, reflecting, remembered that his friend had been dead a good while since, and immediately returned to the place where he had seen the apparition, but all had disappeared whereupon he went to the Saint in great fear, and told him what had happened. Philip the next morning made him relate the whole vision in the Oratory, in the presence of all, and then sent to different churches to have masses said for the soul of the deceased, besides having a solemn requiem sung at San Giovanni of the Florentines. Afterwards he said to the brothers at the Oratory, Animuccia has arrived, meaning, that he had gone from purgatory to Paradise.\n\nIn some instances he was allowed to see the beauty of souls, even while they were united to the body. Speaking of S. Ignatius, the founder of the Company of Jesus, he said that the intense beauty of that holy man was such and so great, that he could discern it in his countenance, and he declared that he had seen rays of glory issue from his face. So high was the opinion which Philip had of him, that after his death, in case of any special need, he used to go to his tomb, and recommend himself to him, although he was not yet canonized, and he obtained by this means whatever he asked; and when he read his life, he said several times, How many things are left out, how many more than are written! O if all had been registered, how would mens admiration for Ignatius have increased!\n\nHe declared he had observed the same thing in looking at S. Charles, and that he had seen him beautiful and resplendent as an angel. He saw also a great splendour in the countenance of one of his youthful penitents, named Giovanni Battista Saraceni of Collescepoli, who afterwards became a Dominican and was called Fra. Pietro Martire; and by his virtue and abilities he was raised to the chief offices of his religion, and was created Vicar General of the order, ending his edifying life by a most holy death. He also saw at different times some Carthusian monks with their faces shining, as they came from prayer.\n\nPhilip, however, had not only visions of good spirits for his own consolation, but of evil ones also for the exercise of his virtue, and the instruction of others. When he was living at S. Girolamo, he ordered Father Giovanni Antonio Lucci to exorcise a woman who was possessed, and in contempt of the devil to give her several blows. The evil spirit was so enraged at this, that he appeared to Philip the next night in a most brutal form, in order to frighten him, and in going away left such a stench in the room that the Saint smelled it for a long time afterwards. One day he was in the Oratory at San Girolamo, when, besides the brothers, Gabriello Palleotto, who was afterwards cardinal, was there. They were conversing of the things of God, when all on a sudden Philip rose and said, My brothers, behold here is the devil; kneel down and pray. He himself immediately went down on iris knees, and making the sign of the cross in front of himself, he said to the devil, Thou shalt not enter; whereupon the evil one disappeared instantly from the eyes of the Saint, and they pursued their exercises in peace.\n\nAnother time he was in the baths of Diocletian, close to Santa Maria degli Angeli, and he saw above one of the monuments of antiquity, which there are there, the devil in the form of a young man; and looking fixedly at him, he observed that he changed his countenance, and appeared sometimes younger, sometimes older, sometimes ugly, and sometimes beautiful. Perceiving that the devil was doing this in order to delude him, he commanded him in the name of God to depart; upon which he immediately vanished, leaving a most horrible stench behind him. This stench was always like sulphur, and although he only smelled it in general, yet sometimes others perceived it also; as was the case one morning when he laid his hand on the head of a possessed person; such a pestilential smell was left upon his hand, that although he washed it with soap, and different sweet-scented things, the stench lasted for several days. During this time he gave his hand to several persons to smell, in order that they might take occasion from it to avoid sin more carefully; as he declared it came from the devil, by whom that poor woman was harassed and possessed. Upon another occasion when Philip was in our church, the devil appeared to him in the form of a boy of six or seven years of age, who held a pocket handkerchief to his mouth, and made game of Philip. The Saint looking severely at him, drove him away; and asking Gallonio, who was there, if he had seen that boy, he added, It was the devil who came unto the church to do some mischief, either to make some one fall into sin, or because some great sinner has entered the church.\n\nIn a word, so bitter was the devils hatred to Philip, that if he prayed or performed any action at all of a religious nature, he almost always endeavoured to disturb him and weary him. One night when the Saint was praying, he appeared to him with a terrible aspect, in order to frighten him, but Philip invoking the Queen of heaven, the evil one instantly disappeared. Another time when the Saint had retired to a sort of little balcony above his room, the demon, not being able to do him any other mischief, stained his clothes all over with dirt; another time in order to annoy him, he upset a table upon him and when the Saint was ill, the devil used often to put out the light which was kept burning in the room. Besides this, he was continually making a noise in the room; so that Gallonio, who slept underneath, was frequently obliged to rise and go upstairs to see what the meaning of the noise was, and never found anything: but Philip repeatedly said to him, The devil has tried to frighten me tonight, but I recommended myself to the most holy Mary, and she delivered me.\n\nPhilip, as well by the sanctity of his life, as by his experience, had acquired great discernment in these matters, and know well how to distinguish true from false visions. He was very particular every time that conversation turned upon them, whether speculatively or practically, to warn men against being deluded, which is very easy and probable; and for this end he constantly quoted that common doctrine of the holy fathers, that we ought not ordinarily to give credit to visions; and although he was favoured by God with such lights and elevations of mind, yet he did not at all like ecstasies or visions in public; for he said they were most dangerous things, and that we ought to seek for spiritual sweetnesses and consolations, and keep them as secret as possible. He also said that visions, as well good as bad, were wont to come even to those who did not wish for them, and therefore that no person could confidently say, I do not desire these things, and so I shall not be exposed to delusions or to visions, but that there is need of great humility, great resignation and detachment, to prevent our leaving God because of visions. He used to add that it was a difficult thing to receive visions, and not be puffed up by them, more difficult not to think ourselves worthy of them, but the most difficult of all to think ourselves actually unworthy, and to prefer patience, obedience, and humility, to the sweetness of visions. He taught that the visions which were not useful either to the person who received them, or to the Church in general., were in no way to be esteemed, and that real visions begin by breeding horror and fear, but leave behind them great peace and tranquillity, whereas counterfeit visions work just in a contrary way. He warned confessors never to trust to the revelations of their spiritual children, and particularly of women, because they seem sometimes to be far advanced in spirituality, but more often than not it all melts away, and many have made shipwreck of themselves in following after these things. He counselled, therefore, nay, in many instances commanded his spiritual children to reject such things with all their might, and not to fear that in doing so they should displease the Divine Majesty, because this is one of the very tests to distinguish true from false visions. One day when he mounted into the pulpit to preach, he spoke against those who gave easy credence to visions, raptures, and ecstasies, and said, I know a person present here who can go into an ecstasy when ever he pleases, God having among other graces granted him this also, but a person ought to fly from such things and. to hide them; when he had said this he felt himself being carried away in spirit; whereupon he strove to the best of his power to hinder himself from going unto an ecstasy, and being unable to proceed with his sermon, he leaned with his hand upon his knee, and said, He who wishes for ecstasies and visions, does not know what he desires! O if everybody did but know what an ecstasy is! and then bursting into tears, he came down from the pulpit, and went away.\n\nAnother time when Fr. Giovan Francesco Bordini had been discoursing upon ecstasies, after he had finished, Philip mounted the pulpit and said, that as that father had spoken of ecstasies, he wished to add a word or two to the discourse; I have known, said he, a woman of holy life who had continual ecstasies for a long time, and then God took them from her: now I ask you, when do you think I esteemed that woman more, when she had ecstasies, or when she had not? I tell you, that to my mind, she was without comparison more estimable when she had not ecstasies than when she had; and with these words he came down from the pulpit and went away. On one occasion he was told that our Lord frequently appeared, and S. Catherine of Siena almost continually, to a virgin of the third order of S. Dominic. He replied, as one who had had much experience in such matters, Women very easily deceive themselves; tell her, therefore, when such visions come, to spit in their face, and be the persons who they may to make no esteem of them, and not only not to desire them, but to despise them. The virgin acted upon this advice, and kept herself always in a prudent fear of being deceived, to the immense profit of her soul.\n\nWe have already mentioned Francesco Maria, commonly surnamed Il Ferrarese, one of the Saints first spiritual children. One night the devil appeared to him in the form of the Blessed Virgin, with much splendour. In the morning Francesco told Philip of it, but he answered, This is the devil, and not the Virgin; if he returns again, spit in his face. The following night the same vision returned; Francesco spit in his face, and the demon immediately disappeared. Francesco continued his prayer, and presently the most holy Virgin came to him in reality; he wished to spit at her, but she said, Spit if you can. He tried to do so, but found his month and tongue so dry and parched, that he could not. Our Blessed Lady told him he had done well to perform the obedience which had been given him, and then disappeared, leaving him full of consolation and joyousness of spirit.\n\nAntonio Fucci, the physician of whom we have spoken before, attended a nun of a holy life, who was seriously ill, and finding her one day lost in divine contemplation, he waited till she came to herself, when turning immediately to him she said, O how beautiful have I seen you just now in Paradise. Antonio, hearing these words, and reflecting on them, went to confer with the holy father, and on the same day fell ill. His indisposition continually increasing, the enemy of human nature, in order to delude him, came to visit him several times under the guise of a physician, promising him a long life, and telling him that he would certainly not die of that sickness. He mentioned this to the Saint, who came to him every day; Philip told him this was not the physician, but the devil; and Antonio, discovering the delusion, resigned himself to the will of God, and died a holy death a few days afterwards. The Saint used to relate this, in order to impress upon his children, that those who are in danger of death ought not to credit visions readily, especially when a promise of long life was made in them, because they are generally delusions of the devil, who wishes a man to die still hoping for life, and so without due preparation; and he used to say, that the danger of rejecting true visions, was much less than that of putting trust in false ones.\n\nMattia Maffei, a priest, and one of the Saints penitents, having been miraculously cured of an illness by him, the night following had a dream, which shall be related for the sake of the meaning it contains. It seemed to this good priest, that he was conducted by the holy father into a most spacious meadow, where there was an innumerable multitude of princes, richly and superbly clothed; and while he was looking, in one instant the whole scene sank down, and everything turned into flames and fire, and an immense number of devils appeared. He remained standing on a very narrow edge of the meadow, and one of the devils with some hooks tried all he could to pull him into the fire, and while he was defending himself, the Saint looked at him and smiled. At last he took him by the hand and said to him, Come, Mattia; do not be afraid, and he led him through the midst of a tangled thicket of exceedingly sharp thorns: the Saint himself seemed to be unhurt by them, but he dragged Maffei through them in such a way as to give him the most acute pain. He then led him into a inmost beautiful meadow, at the end of which there was a most beautiful hill, and at the foot of it three angels in shining garments, one with a cross in his hand, and the other two with two candlesticks and lighted candles, and behind them was an immense multitude of virgins, widows, and married women, many of whom made an obeisance to the holy father, and many asked Maffei if he wished to go with them; but he not daring to speak, the Saint answered for him, saying that it was not time yet, because he was not altogether a good man. All this multitude passed through a wide alley, with trees in blossom on both sides, on which were little angels, who kept breaking branches off, and throwing them down on the crowd below, and singing all the while most sweetly, Gloria in excelsis Deo, and the hymn, Jesu corona Virginum. At last when the multitude reached the top of the hill, they entered into a most beautiful palace; and when all had entered, Maffei awoke, and so the dream ended. He went immediately to confession to the Saint, and before he had spoken a word, Philip asked him if he believed in dreams; and Maffei wishing to lay hold of this opportunity to relate his dream, the Saint with a severe and menacing look cut him short, and said, Get away with you; he who wishes to go to Paradise must be an honest man and a good Christian, and not a believer in dreams.\n\nIn fine, this was the doctrine that he was continually preaching - that we must catch by the feet those who wish to fly without wings, and drag them down to the ground by main force, lest they should fail into the devils net - meaning those who go after visions, dreams, and the like, forgetting that we must always walk along the road of mortification of our own passions, and of holy humility.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nOF PHILIP'S GIFT OF PROPHECY; AND FIRST OF HIS PREDICTING THE DEATHS OF SEVERAL PERSONS.\n\nTo the gift of visions, Philip joined that of prophecy; indeed he was specially eminent even among other Saints in this gift, as well in predicting future events, as in seeing absent things, and in reading the secrets of hearts. If all the examples of this which it would be easy to adduce were narrated, they would fill entire volumes, as many of the witnesses affirmed in the processes; and in truth the Congregation of Rites pronounced that in this gift of prophecy, non est inventus similis illi, none was found like him. It will be sufficient, therefore, to give a few specimens, from which it may be gathered how singularly he was favoured by God in this respect; and we will begin with the predictions he made of the deaths of others.\n\nCostanzo Tassone, who has been mentioned before, was called from Milan to Rome, by S. Pius V., and when he arrived there, went at once to dismount at S. Girolamo della Carità. One of Philips penitents was at the window that looks into the piazza; he immediately ran to the Saint and said, Father, here is Messer Costanzo. Philip immediately ordered Ottavio Paravicino and Germanico Fedeli, who were both youths at that time, to stretch themselves like corpses over the threshold of the door through which Costanzo had to pass. They obeyed, and Tassone, seeing the two youths stretched in this way on the ground, was a little disturbed, and begged them to let him pass; but they remained in that position till Philip caused them to rise, and Costanzo ran to embrace him. In a short time he fell sick, and was dead within the fortnight.\n\nGiovan Angelo Crivelli went to confess to the Saint on Holy Thursday; he was perfectly well at the time, but Philip looking earnestly into his face, said to him, My Giovan Angelo, prepare yourself, go and pray a little while before the crucifix in the church of San Girolamo, and then come back, for God wants something of you. Crivelli answered, May His Divine Majesty do what seems best to Him; for I am ready to receive any thing from His hand. But, rejoined the Saint, if it were to please God to send you a very grievous tribulation, would you bear it willingly? Trusting in His aid, said he, I would bear it most willingly. Well then, replied Philip, see that you are prepared, for at Easter God will call you. Giovan Angelo went away, and that same evening a fever came on, and on the fourth day he died and the Saint said afterwards to Giovans daughter, that her father was gone to Paradise.\n\nOne morning he called Francesco della Molara to him suddenly, and said to him, What would you do, Francesco, if your wife were to die? Indeed, father, replied he, I do not know. Well now, said Philip, think on what you would do if your wife were to die. Fulvia de Cavalieri, as Francescos wife was called, was at that time both young and well, and with no appearance of illness about her, but in ten days she was seized with a malignant fever, and died within the fortnight.\n\nGirolamo Cordella, a physician of some reputation and a friend of the Saint, was appointed physician to the court, but continued, notwithstanding, to go about Rome visiting his patients whereupon the Saint said, This will last but a short time; he wishes to return to his old labours, and he will die. Soon afterwards Cordella was taken ill, and his wife sent some one to the Saint to let him know that her husband was ill, and to beg his prayers. Father Gallonio went down stairs to see who it was that was asking for Philip, and what they wanted. As soon as he was gone the Saint began to say, O poor Cordella! Ah! this time he will die without fail; his hour is come. Those who were present wondered at these words, for Father Gallonio had not yet returned with the news of his illness. But when he came back, and delivered the message of Cordellas wife, the Saint again said, O poor Cordella! the course of his life is finished; he will die presently. Those who were there said, Well, father, if we cannot mend his body, we may at least help his soul. Philip replied in his usual manner, Yes, this we can do, certainly, this we can do. The eighth day of Cordellas illness came, and very early in the morning, Father Gallonio and Consolini taking a light to the Saint, he said, Cordella died at such an hour, did he not? but perceiving that they knew nothing about it, he immediately turned the conversation to something else. He afterwards sent them to see how matters stood, and they found that Cordella had died at the very hour that Philip had named; and Philip himself said afterwards to Cardinal Agostino Cusano, I was present at Girolamo Cordellas death, although I was in my own room all the while.\n\nOrintia, the wife of Pompeo Colonna, was a lady, who to the distinction of noble birth added that of eminent piety. She constantly visited the hospital of San Giacomo of the Incurables, in order to succour those poor patients in soul as well as in body. At last she fell ill, and was attended by the principal physicians of Rome, who said that her indisposition was not of any importance. But Orintia, putting no confidence in the medical men, sent to ask Philip to visit her. He went, and conversed with her for a long time upon spiritual matters; before bidding her good bye, he dipped his finger in holy water, made the sign of the cross upon her, and urging her to call to mind the passion of our Saviour, he departed. In going out of the palace he met the physicians, and when he said that the lady was very ill, they ridiculed him. Then Philip replied, Well, you may laugh at me now, but I tell you that on such a day, (mentioning the day,) she will pass to another world. At these words the physicians burst out laughing; but on the day mentioned Orintia died.\n\nElena Cibi fell sick, together with her husband Domenico Mazzei; and Tamiria Cevoli, Elenas mother, fearing from the symptoms of their complaint that both her daughter and her son-in-law would die, went to the Saint to recommend them to his prayers. Father, said she, I fear that both of them will die. No, replied the Saint, no, one is enough; and so it was, for Domenico died, and Elena got well, and leaving the cares of the world, she became a nun in the convent of San Vincenzo, at Prato in Tuscany. Vittoria Cibi, Elenas sister, went to the Saint to confess; he asked her how long it was since she had visited her sister who was a nun at Torre di Speech, called Sister Vincenza. Vittoria replied that it was several days since; Well then, answered the Saint, go and see her every day, for she will die very shortly. Not long afterwards the nun, who was in perfect health, and of a strong constitution, was suddenly attacked by a malignant fever, and died in eighteen days.\n\nMarcello Ferro wished to leave Rome with Cardinal Gambara; but the holy father told him not to go, because his father, Alfonso Ferro, would die in a few days. Marcello obeyed, and although his father was strong and well, he died at the end of twenty days. Alessandro Crescenzi went to the Saint on the 1st of August, 1594, in excellent bodily health; and Philip, as soon as he saw him, said, Get ready, for in a short time you will die; and on the 16th of the same month Alessandro expired. Guglielmo, the brother of Giovan Francesco Bucca, fell ill, and Philip said to Giovan Francesco, Your brother will die, and do not fret about it, for it is well for him that he should die now; and his death took place accordingly. A clerk of the Congregation, named Leonardo, a person of exemplary life, was ill, and the Saint was asked to pray for him, that he might not die. But Philip, having withdrawn for a while, returned and told Antonio Gallonio that he would rather not make that prayer, perhaps because he knew that death would be better than health for Leonardo, who did in fact die of that illness.\n\nVirgilio Crescenzi fell ill, and as his indisposition was at first very slight, his family never dreamed of his dying. The Saint, however, went to visit him, and told Costanza his wife that she must acquiesce in what was pleasing to God. On hearing this she was very much disturbed; but knowing the favours which God daily granted through Philip to those who recommended themselves to his prayers, she drew him aside, and shedding floods of tears, she knelt down before him, and earnestly besought him to intercede with God for the health of her husband. But he answered, God wishes for him: do you desire anything but the salvation of his soul? Both mother and sons, however, joined together entreating him to pray for Virgilios life, and then he said plainly to them, that it was well for his soul that he should die then; and after Crescenzis death Philip told Marcello Vitelleschi that when he really wished to pray for the deceaseds recovery, he found himself deprived of the power to pray, and he seemed to hear an interior voice telling him that it was necessary for Virgilios good that he should die then. In like manner when Antonio Regattiero went to recommend his sick wife to the Saints prayers, Philip said, Let her go; do not make yourself anxious about this; and the woman died.\n\nWhen Patrizio Patrizi died, his indisposition seemed so slight that he said he would get up the next morning, and the doctors declared he had no fever. Philip, however, ordered him to receive the holy communion as soon as possible, to make his will, and to prepare for death. Patrizios wife, seeing the Saint in such a hurry, said, This old man seems out of his mind, and Patrizio himself said, In this matter the Father seems to me to be a little precipitate; and yet when he had made his will and received the last sacraments he died. He was a great servant of God, and the Saint put the greatest possible confidence in him, and after his death recommended himself to his prayers.\n\nFra. Desiderio Consalvi, a Dominican, was dangerously ill of a pestilential fever, with lethargy and delirium; the medical men despaired of him, and he was at the point of death. At the same time and in the same convent another brother, Fra. Francesco Bencini, was in, but not so seriously as Consalvi. Philip went to see both of them; he visited Fra. Francesco first, and said, This one will die. Going afterwards to Fra. Desiderio, he had scarcely entered his cell before the invalid came to himself, and the Saint laying his hands on his head, the delirium left him instantly, and Philip said, Be of good cheer; you will get well. At these words the sick man felt his heart filled with joy, secretly believing that God was going to restore him his health through the means of his servant Philip; nay, he seemed to be already cured, and answered, I trust in you, father, pray for me and for my welfare. When Philip bade him good bye, he said to him a second time, Keep up your heart; you will recover, without doubt. And so it was; for, contrary to the opinion of all, he recovered, and Fra. Franceso died; so that the friars, when they saw Fra. Desiderio restored to health, called him the Risen Lazarus; and Giovanni Comparotti, a medical man of the order, used to call this cure the miracle of miracles. It happened on the 22nd of July, 1591.\n\nFinally, he predicted the death of S. Charles Borromeo. Ceccolino Margarucci, a priest of San Severino, and protonotary apostolic, who had been sent by the holy father to the service of S. Charles, having asked his masters leave to stay three or four months at home, in order to settle some affairs of his own, and desiring the holy cardinal to grant him a favour before his return to Milan after settling these affairs, wrote to Philip to get him to obtain this favour for him from the cardinal. Philip replied, that it was useless treating of such matters, because by the time he thought of returning to Milan, some thing would have happened which would prevent his returning to his service there. Margarucci could not at the time understand what Philip meant; but the mystery was cleared up when he received the mews of S. Charless death, just as he was getting ready to return to Milan. He had written his letter to the holy father a month before the cardinals death, when there was no indisposition, or anything to make men expect the sad event. When Margarucci returned to Rome, some months afterwards, Philip, as soon as he saw him, said, Did I not tell you something would happen which would prevent your returning to the service of Cardinal Borromeo?\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nPHILIP PREDICTS THE RECOVERY OF MANY.\n\nThe reader must not, however, imagine that Philip was only the messenger of death. There were many instances in which he predicted the recovery of those who seemed at the point of death. Cardinal Francesco Sforza was ill of a pestilential fever and a bloody flux; and for twenty-two days the malady had afflicted him with loss of appetite and cruel pain, so that he had made his confession and received the Viaticum, but not Extreme Unction. Caterina Sforza, his mother, in this distress sent a candle to Philip, and at the same time begged him to pray for the recovery of her son the cardinal. Philip waited for a little while, and then sent word to her not to be cast down, because her son would certainly not die; and the cardinal recovered. The same thing happened to Michele Mercati, of San Miniato, a famous physician and one of Philips most intimate friends. When he was lying at deaths door, Philip said to his father Pietro Mercati, who was also a physician, Do not be alarmed; your son will not die, and Pietro saying to him one day, Father! we may almost count the minutes now, Philip answered, Have I not told you that he will not die? The Lord does not want him yet: He chooses to reserve him for another time. Michele survived this eleven years, became physician to Clement VIII., and was made a prelate by him, and then Philip predicted his death, as he had before predicted his recovery. He sent several times to him to tell him not to study so hard, for that if he continued to do so he would die very shortly. Michele gave no heed to the warning, but a month and a half after he had finished the book he was composing, he died; and when the holy father heard of it, he said, Yes, he chose to study too much.\n\nWhen the second son of the duke of Acquasparta was ill, his mother sent to recommend him to the prayers of the Saint. When Philip was vested for mass, the time when they always reminded him of those who were recommended to his prayers, they called to his remembrance the request of the duchess; he answered that she had an elder son, implying that the other one would die, as he did. Shortly afterwards the elder son fell dangerously ill, and the mother sent to beg the prayers of the Saint. Philip said that he must help him by his prayers, as the other son had died but a little while before, and conformably to his prediction, and by the help of his prayers, the one who was now ill recovered. Giovan Battista Altoviti was so ill that the physician considered him as good as dead, but the Saint, having prayed for him, said to Father Francesco Maria Tarugi, Go and tell Giovan Battista from me, that he shall not only not die, but that he shall begin to recover to-morrow, and shall get well; all which was verified in the end.\n\nBartolomeo Dotti, a Modenese, was ill in Rome of fever; he made his will, and those who were about him expecting his death, watched with him through the night. He held a squires place, and in consequence of this, his nephew begged the Saint to pray for his uncle, for if he died the place would be lost, and go out of the family, which would be a great loss to both of them; particularly as his uncle had told him several times, that he wished to resign the office in his favour. Philip answered, Go; he will get well this time; but the first illness he shall have after this, he will die most certainly; but as to his resigning his place in your favour, I tell you he will do nothing of the kind. Dotti got well, but did not resign his place, and four years afterwards he died of the first illness which he had, after the Saints prediction.\n\nOlimpia del Nero, wife of Marco Antonio Vitelleschi, was dangerously ill; three fevers came one after another, and there was every symptom of inevitable death. Girolamo Cordella, who attended her, told her husband that he had never had but three patients in that way before, and that all three had died. Philip, however, told Marco Antonio and others, not to be afraid, because he felt compassion for that family, and that the loss would be too great, and that he would pray to God for her with the greatest earnestness, adding, This is a case in which we must needs do violence to God, and pray absolutely for her, because she has so many children. The invalid began to amend as soon as the Saint had gone, and got well in a few days, contrary to the opinion of the medical men.\n\nCardinal Girolamo Panfilio, before he was promoted to the cardinalate, and when he was auditor of the Rota, fell sick, and every one judged his disease to be mortal. Philip went to visit him twice a-day; and once, when the malady was at its worst, moved by the spirit of God, he took the sufferer by the head, and held it tightly with both his hands. Meanwhile he trembled and was agitated in his usual way, while he prayed for him, and when he had finished his prayer, he said, Be of good cheer, and do not be afraid; you will not die this time, but in a few days you will be free from your complaint. Panfilio began to amend immediately, and in a short time was completely well. The same cardinal affirms that this happened also to his nephew Alessandro. The physicians had already given him over, when Philip came to visit him. He did nothing but touch him with some relics, pray for him, and then say that his illness would be of no consequence. The youths complaint took a favourable turn immediately, to the surprise of the medical attendants.\n\nFaustina Cenci, the wife of Carlo Gabrielli, was at the point of death. The holy father went to visit her, laid his hand upon her head, and said, Do not fear, you will not die. He then prayed for a while, and she said, Father! I am dead. Philip replied, No, keep up your spirits; I assure you you will not die this time; nor was it a vain security, for in a short time she recovered perfectly. Costanza del Drago was also at the point of death, when the Saint went to visit her. He said to her, Do not be afraid, you will soon come to confession at San Girolamo; and so it was, for from this occasion she became one of the Saints penitents, and confessed to him as long as she lived. Another time when Costanza was eight months gone in her pregnancy, she was attacked by a dangerous fever and measles, and her malady increased so much that she seemed at the point of death, and about midnight she received the holy Viaticum, after which the priest returned to give her Extreme Unction. Meanwhile she began to think within herself in what manner she might be rescued from impending death, and it came into her mind, that the only remedy in this urgent necessity, was Philips intercession with the Divine clemency for her recovery. At day break Philip presented himself without being sent for, and found her somewhat better. As soon as she saw him she began to say, Father! I have passed the night in distresses and fears, and have been at deaths door. I longed very much to see you, because I felt sure you could assist me, and as soon as I thought of you, I implored the aid of God, and immediately through the power of your prayers I began to amend. Then Philip replied, During this very night which you have passed in the midst of distress, I have all the while been with you; and now be of good cheer, for you will not only not die, but will soon recover your health perfectly. The lady immediately found herself better, and contrary to the expectation of all who knew how ill she had been, recovered her former health in a few days.\n\nThe same happened to the wife of Giovan Francesco Bucca, a Roman. She was at the very point of death; and the brothers of the Company of S. Giovanni de Fiorentini were already warned to be ready to accompany her to the grave. Philip, however, went to visit her, and touching her with some relics, prayed for her, and then said to her husband, Your wife will certainly not die; and to the astonishment of all she rallied and recovered perfectly.\n\nGiovanni Antonio Lucci, when he was upwards of sixty years old, fell from his horse as he was coming to Rome. He received a contusion on the head, and dislocated his shoulder bone, and he was so much injured that all looked upon his death as certain. In consequence of this accident a fever came on, and the physicians pronouncing him in danger, Giovanni Antonio sent for the holy father in order to confess to him. When Philip came, Lucci begged him to pray for his recovery, not that he was afraid of death, but because he had not settled his affairs as he should wish to do. Philip, hearing this, embraced him, and said, Do not fear, you will settle your affairs as you wish, and you will have time to make your will at your leisure. At that moment he began to amend, and in a short time recovered perfectly, and survived the Saint some months. Philip said the same to Giovan Francesco Bernardi, a father of the Congregation, who had already received Extreme Unction, and yet recovered to the surprise of every body. The Saint afterwards said to him, My Giovan Francesco, I prayed for you in that dangerous illness, that God would be pleased to heal you if it was for your good. To Agnesina Colonna, a lady as illustrious for her piety as her birth, and who was then given over by her medical attendants, he said, You will not die this time, and she recovered. Another time he visited Giovan Battista Crivelli, who was ill of a fever, and was just then expecting the usual accession, and he said to him, Do not fear; the fever will not come again; and so it proved. A priest, one of the Saints spiritual children, had a rupture which inconvenienced him greatly, and he could find no remedy for it, although he had consulted some of the most skilful physicians and surgeons. He had recourse, however, to the prayers of Philip, and having recommended himself to him several times, the Saint always answered, Do you not be afraid; you will be cured of it; and in a few days it went away of itself, and nothing but a slight mark remained.\n\nFinally, we may observe that those sick persons, whose recovery Philip predicted, got well, although the Physicians had despaired of them, and those who he said would die did die, even when the physicians had no suspicion of it, and treated the malady as of no importance. Monte Zazzara declares that he had on several occasions two or three sicknesses in the house at a time, some sick of malignant fever, and other pestilential disorders, and telling every thing to the Saint, as he usually did, if Philip said, Do not be afraid; they will not die, they always got well; but if he did not say so, they died.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nOTHER OF PHILIPS PREDICTIONS.\n\nPhilip made many other predictions about different matters. Sulpizia Sirleti, the wife of Pietro Focile, whom we have already mentioned, had a daughter four years old, who was dangerously ill. She sent for the holy father, who was her confessor, and begged him with many tears to heal her daughter. The Saint replied, Be calm, God wishes for her, let it be enough for you to have nursed her for God. But the mother, not quite resigning herself as she ought to do, Philip added, Well, you will have a son, who will give you such trouble that it will go ill with you. At the end of about two years and a half she had a son, who his whole life long did nothing else but give continual displeasure to his father and mother. Elena Cibi, the wife of Domenico Mazzei, being in the pains of child-birth, sent for the holy father that she might make her confession. Having done this, she begged of him to hold at the font the child that was about to be born, or at least to find some one else to do so, according as he pleased; Philip answered, There will be no need of a godfather; and the night following Elena was confined of a dead child.\n\nThere was in the Congregation a lay brother, named Pietro Paolo de Petris. It happened that his father, who was a poor man, won five or six thousand crowns in certain wagers which were common at that time. In consequence of this he was very anxious that his son should leave the Congregation and study for the priesthood, in order that he might assist in raising the family. Pietro Paolo, in order to get rid of his fathers importunities, determined by the Saints advice to set off for Naples, and going for a blessing, Philip, changing his mind, said to him, I do not wish you to go; and do not be alarmed, God will provide in this matter; and three months afterwards Pietros father lost all his money at play, and consequently gave his son no further trouble.\n\nOlimpia del Nero, wife of Marco Antonio Vitelleschi, had seven daughters, and was extremely desirous of having a son. She had great faith in the holy father, and going to him she said, Father, I have seven daughters: Philip replied, Well, do not be afraid; you will not have any more girls. She had three more children, all of whom were boys, and then, thinking her family was becoming too large, she went again to the Saint, and said, Father, I have now three sons; Philip answered, Go away with you! you will have no more, neither boys nor girls, a prediction which was fulfilled in the event.\n\nThe Saint one day entered the convent of Torre di Specchi, and as four of those good mothers were going with him to one of their churches, which is now called the Old Church, he said to Porzia Capozucchi, who was one of them, Porzia, give yourself to prayer; she replied, I cannot, father, because I am in office, and I have always active work to do. Another of them, Maria Maddalena Anguillara, said, And what of me, father? I do not give myself up to prayer, and yet I have nothing to do. The Saint answered, as usual, in a joking way, Yes, yes! you do nothing, and you shall be presidente; so give yourself to prayer now, for you will not be able to do so when you are superioress. The others, when they heard this, burst out laughing, for Maria Maddalena was then only about twenty or twenty-one: the Saint said, Laugh away, laugh away, and yet you will say afterwards, Philip said it. When he saw that Maria Maddalena herself was laughing, he said to her, You laugh, do you? remember, Philip has told you. From time to time several superioresses died, and at last, after the canonization of the Saint, Girolama Taschi was elected; but in 1635 she became perfectly blind, and being no longer able to attend to her duties she resigned her office, and at the new election the mothers chose Maria Maddalena Anguillara as presidente. Afterwards they remembered Philips prophecy, which was thus fulfilled forty years after he had made it, and that contrary to all expectation, inasmuch as Girolama Taschi was young, and likely to live a long time.\n\nThe constable Marco Antonio Colonna, and Felice Orsina, his wife, were annoyed that their son Fabrizio had no heirs. Anna Borromeo, the sister of S. Charles and Fabrizios wife, one of the Saints penitents, was on this account particularly anxious to have a son, and she recommended herself to Philips prayers, that he might obtain this favour for her from God. One morning Philip said to her quite suddenly, Anna, you may rejoice, for in a short time you will have two sons; and a year afterwards she had a son, who was named Marco Antonio, and the year following another, named Filippo, after the constables death; and she used to say, I consider myself to have received these two sons through the intercession of Father Philip, and she used to call them his children.\n\nTommaso Minerbetti and Pier Antonio Morelli went to San Girolamo, by the advice of F. Francesco Benci of the Company of Jesus, to hear Philips opinion of a resolution which they had made. Pier Antonio told him he wished to be come a Benedictine monk, and Tommaso said his desire was to be a priest, but they wished for the Saints advice. Philip rose from his chair, and with a cheerful countenance touched Pier Antonio with a stick which he had in his hand, saying to him, You shall not be a monk; and to Tommaso, You shall not be a priest. And so it turned out, for Tommaso married after he had received minor orders; and Pier Antonio, though he did his best to be a monk, remained a secular priest, and died curate of Santa Fiora.\n\nCaptain Ottonello Ottonelli, of Fanano, in the territory of Modena, came to Rome on some business concerning the erection of a convent of nuns, and meeting with some difficulties, he was brought to the holy father by Germanico Fedeli, in order that Philip might take an interest in the matter, and help him with his prayers. As soon as Ottonelli arrived, the Saint turned to some priests who were present, and said to them, This man is your brother. He then asked the captain what profession he was of; he replied, that he was a soldier. No, said Philip, not a soldier, but the brother of these; and then, laying his hand on his head, he blessed him. Now Ottonelli was a married man, had several sons and daughters, and was exceedingly fond of his profession. In a very short time, however, his wife and some of his daughters died; those who survived became nuns, and he himself, in 1609, inspired by God, was ordained priest, and after some years became oven a religious among the fathers of the Pious Schools, the order founded by S. Joseph Calasanctius.\n\nIn 1579 four of our fathers were sent by the Congregation to Milan upon business. One day the holy father suddenly called Francesco Maria Tarugi, and said to him, Write immediately to our fathers at Milan, and tell them to return home as soon as possible. Tarugi answered, that it was not well to recall them, lest it should create scandal in that city, seeing they had not accomplished the business on which they were sent. Philip replied, Make no answer; you obey me and write, and write that they are to come home immediately. The letter had scarcely arrived at Milan, when the plague broke out, although there had not been so much as a suspicion of it previously; and it was so sudden that two of the fathers had great difficulty in getting away, and passing the barrier on their return. One of those fathers, Pompeo Pateri, wished a few months before to go into Spain with a prelate who was greatly attached to the Congregation, as well to please the prelate as to facilitate the accomplishment of the business above mentioned, Milan being at that time under the government of Spain. The rest of the fathers were of opinion that he ought to go; the resolution was taken, and the packet fastened up to send to the post; but at the very time Philip said to Father Agostino Manni, Write to Pompeo, and tell him not to go into Spain, but to stop at Milan. Two months had not passed before a person died, whose death would have entailed a very serious loss upon the Congregation, if Pompeo had not been in Milan at the time.\n\nPier Filippo Lazzarelli, a parish priest, was in danger of losing his benefice through the favour which his enemies had with a certain influential prelate. This drove him into such despair, that he left off saying mass and office, and determined to shoot his adversary and murder him. In this condition it happened that one of his brothers brought him one morning to our church, and as they were both kneeling before the high altar, the priest turned and saw the Saint at the confessional. Although he had never seen him before, he felt himself so drawn to him, that he was, as it were, forced to him, and threw himself at his feet without knowing what he was doing. Philip, seeing him full of thought, and not uttering a word, took hold of him by the ear, and said, You are tempted, are you not? He replied, I am tempted to such a degree, father, that I am on the point of doing great evil, and he then told him all he had in his mind. Philip answered, Go away, and do not be cast down; in a fortnight you will be freed from these troubles, and having said thus he heard his confession. When the fortnight had elapsed, the priest met his adversary, who said, I give up to you now, and consider myself to have lost my cause, as my patron has been removed from his office. The priest then remembered the holy fathers words, and gave God thanks for preserving him from that great sin.\n\nThe same thing happened to Orazio Ricci, a knight of Malta. He was in the service of Cardinal Frederick Borromeo, and he was afflicted by an important persecution set on foot against him in that court, and which involved his honour and reputation. He rose up one morning very early, in great discontent, and went into the open air, that he might in some measure give vent to the passion which affected him. In the street he met S. Philip, who asked him where he was going; he answered, To take the air, but that if his Reverence wished anything else of him he might command him freely. Philip, who had seen in spirit all his distress, took him with him to the palace of the auditor of the Camera, who who at that time Orazio Borghese, brother of Paul V., with whom the Saint had some important business, and because it was so early he had to wait a long time. Meanwhile the Saint began reading: but the knight was more disturbed than ever, especially when he found himself shut up in a weary waiting room, when he had intended to be out in the open air, and yet he was ashamed to ask Philips leave to go away. Just at the time when Riccis weariness had come to such a pitch that he could not possibly stay any longer, Philip rose from his chair, and looking fixedly at him, took his hand and squeezed it, saying, Do not be afraid; it will all come to nothing, and in the end matters will turn out well for you, and I tell you so. The knight was astonished at this, but at the same time greatly consoled, and filled with a lively hope that all would be as the Saint had prophesied. In a fortnight the cardinal dismissed from his service the man who was persecuting Ricci, and the knight rose higher than before in his masters favour, who at last put him as chamberlain in the household of Clement VIII., everything falling out to his advantage, according to the words of the holy father.\n\nIn 1580 Domenico Ridolfi, of the order of the Clerks Regular, was sent by his superiors from Naples to Cremona. When he arrived in Rome he heard of Philip, and went immediately to him, and found him at the confessional. He kissed his hand, and paid his respects to him. Philip, with a blithe countenance said to him, Go cheerfully where holy obedience sends you, and attend to the salvation of souls; and know that in progress of time you will be made bishop, in order to labour more effectually for the salvation of others. But I warn you that in this journey you will run a great risk of your life, but by the favour of our Lord and his most holy Mother you will come safely out of the danger, yet not without great difficulty. The father set off for Cremona, and when he came to the mountains of Florence, wishing to pass a fosse which was full of liquid chalk, and which he did not know of, he fell in, together with his horse, and it was so deep that both the beast and himself were up to the neck. They who were in company with him were unable to assist him, and so they began to make the commendation of his soul. At that moment the good father thought of Philip, and called him to his aid. Immediately he began to have the use of his hands, and by little and little he got out of the chalk, although half dead; and the horse was afterwards extricated by the help of two pair of oxen. He arrived at Cremona, and worked for his order till 1619, when Paul V. appointed him bishop of Oria; the whole of Philips prediction being thus punctually fulfilled.\n\nTo a certain person who wished to convert all the bad women in Rome, he predicted that he would not only not succeed, but would be perverted himself, and then in the end would marry; all which happened as he had said. Indeed, those in the house observed that all he said, however casually he might seem to say it, turned out true, and this not only during his lifetime, but of things which happened after his death. For what he said, or even in any manner insinuated, was verified by degrees, and they who were in the way of knowing of them, had almost daily experience of something or other proving true which he had predicted.\n\nFra. Niccolo Ridolfi, a Florentine noble, took the Dominican habit when he was quite a youth, and it was the priors will that Philip should clothe him, he did so, and he then said to him, I make a friar of you now, and you shall one day make a friar of me. When Ridolfi was made Master General of the Dominicans, one of the first things he did, was to order the office of S. Philip to be recited throughout the whole of the order, as is done with the saints who were children of the order; and it was then men came to see how the Saints prediction was fulfilled. Another time Philip said to Father Pietro Consolini, as if he was joking, You will one day see me dragged through the Banchi. Many years after his death a marble statue of the Saint was made for the new sacristy, where it is at present to be seen; and although they would naturally have brought it through the Strada di Panico, yet some hindrances arose which compelled them to bring it through the Banchi. Father Pietro happened unawares to meet the kind of truck on which they were dragging the statue, and being told it was the statue of Philip, he began to weep with emotion, remembering the strange prediction, and now seeing it fulfilled.\n\nWhile they were building the church of Madonna dei Lumi, at San Severino for our Congregation, the Saint said to some Barnabite fathers, I am building for you, and so it proved in the end; for although the Congregation was established there, our people gave up the church to the Barnabites six years after the Saints death. He also told the same fathers that they would one day have the college of S. Paul in Rome, thus determining the place of their establishment years before-hand by the spirit of prophecy. Lastly, he told the Venerable Giovanni Leonardi, founder of the Clerks Regular of the Mother of God, and one of his penitents, that he would not live to see his congregation formally and canonically erected into a religious institute, saying, God does not choose to do every thing in your time.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nHE PROPHESIES TO SEVERAL THAT THEY WILL BE CARDINALS OR POPES.\n\nHe prophesied to many that they would be cardinals, and to others that they would be popes. Some youths were one day in his room, and among them were Pietro Aldobrandini, the Abate Crescenzi, and Marcello Vitelleschi. The holy father, without there being a vacancy in the holy see, or any thing to suggest the conversation, called Pietro Aldobrandini to him, and commanded him by holy obedience, to say to his companions, Father Philip says I am to tell you that in a short time you will have to call me Illustrissimo, and that you will esteem it as a favour to have an opportunity of speaking with me. Pietro obeyed out of the respect which he had for the Saint, but he blushed and was not a little ashamed. In a short time the holy see became vacant, and Cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini, his uncle, was made pope, and Pietro was made a cardinal. A little while before, Philip, as if he were making game of him, said to him who was still a youth, See how I behave to you now, whom I shall shortly have to call Illustrissimo.\n\nGiovan Francesco Aldobrandini, nephew of Clement VIII., and general of the Holy Church, being in Philips room, saw stuck up there two cardinals armorial bearings, sketched on paper, with two deaths heads in the shield. Wishing to know the meaning of this, he asked what those two cardinals hats and deaths heads signified. Philip, after some little reluctance, said to him, They signify that after my death I shall have two cardinals in my Congregation; and so, the year after the Saints death, Francesco Maria Tarugi, and Cesare Baronius, both priests of the Congregation, were made cardinals. Philip had several times put a cardinals berretta on Baroniuss head, as if in presage of what was to happen, and twenty years before the promotion of these two priests, he had spoken of it to Mgr. Paolo Recuperati. At other times he spoke of it to others, and particularly to Francesco Neri, a priest of the Company of Jesus, who asked the Saint if Baronius would ever be pope. Philip answered expressly that he would not:\n\nso that when Baronius was in conclave after the death of Clement VIII., and was commonly reported to be near to the popedom, Francesco confidently asserted that he would not be chosen, because the blessed Philip had told him it would not be so.\n\nGirolamo Panfilio says, that Philip prophesied to him that he should be a cardinal. When I went to confession one morning, says Girolamo, to the blessed father, who was ill, he said to me, Would you like to be a cardinal? I answered, that I had never thought of such a thing. He rejoined, However, you will be a cardinal. I laughed at him, and said, And pray who will make me one? however, the blessed father repeated twice over, I tell you you will be a cardinal. He received the hat from Clement VIII. many years after the Saints death.\n\nCardinal Innocenzo del Bufalo speaks as follows: In 1593 or 1594, if I remember rightly, the blessed Father Philip telling me that I should have a canonry at S. Peters, I laughed at this, because I was not in the popes service, nor known to him, so far as I could tell, and I did not see how my appointment to this canonry could come about; and the oftener Father Philip affirmed it the less I believed it. however, in 1549, about the month of August, if I remember rightly, Cardinal Aldobrandini, without my having sought favour, or made any efforts for it, sent for me and told me that the pope thought of giving me the canonry at S. Peters, vacant by the death of Mgr. Maffei. The following day, or a few days afterwards, I went to see the blessed Father Philip, and showed great signs of joy, which I really felt, about my appointment to this canonry; he said that this was nothing, for that this pope would also make me cardinal. This seemed so unlikely, and indeed so impossible, that I laughed immoderately at him; but for all that he repeated it several times, and on different occasions. Afterwards, when by the grace of God and his holiness I was created cardinal, I learnt that the blessed Father Philip had predicted it several times to Sister Silvia del Bufalo, my sister, a nun at Torre di Specchi; and on one occasion, when the news came to Rome of a dangerous illness with which I had been seized in France, my sister said I should certainly not die, because I must be a cardinal first, according to the prediction of the blessed Father Philip.\n\nCardinal Francesco Diatristano in like manner says, When I was young, and living at Rome as chamberlain of honour to Clement VIII., Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini took me to the church of Santa Maria in the Vallicella, to visit Father Philip Neri. We went to his room, and as soon as the holy old man saw me he went into another room, and took out of a basket a very old cardinals berretta, and laughing at me he put it on my head, and said, O what a fine young cardinal! Little thinking that he had the light of prophecy, but imagining that he was making game of me, I was somewhat out of temper; but partly shame and partly respect for his ago and the presence of others, made me keep it down. However, not long after the event approved the Saints action, and at the same time condemned my vexation, which I also condemn now; and I have related this matter just as it happened, for the glory of the Saint, and I subscribe it with my own hand, and seal it with my seal, in token of its truth.\n\nAs to the papacy, whenever the holy see was vacant he seemed to hear a voice telling him which of the cardinals would be pope. After the death of Pius IV. four or five days before the election of the pope, Philip was with Marcello Ferro, one of his spiritual children, and lifting his eyes to heaven, and going almost into an ecstasy, he said, The pope will be elected on Monday. Then another day afterwards, as Marcello was walking with him, he begged him, as he had already told him the day of the popes election, to tell him who would be pope. Philip answered, Come now, I will tell you: the pope will be one whom you have never thought of, and whom no one has spoken of as likely, and that is Cardinal Alessandrino, and he will be elected on Monday evening without fail. This was the glorious S. Pius V. whose election the Saint had already predicted to others, and which took place as he had said. After the death of S. Pius V. Marcello remembered how Philip had prophesied his election, and accordingly prayed him very importunately to tell him who would be pope now. Philip asked him who was talked of in Rome as likely; Marcello answered, Cardinal Morone: No, replied Philip, it will not be Morone, but Boncompagni, who was elected accordingly, and took the name of Gregory XIII.\n\nAfter the death of Sixtus V. Cardinal Niccolò Sfondrato came one day to visit the holy father. Philip sent him word not to come up stairs, but to stay in the guest-room, and he would come down to him. When he came down he found there Pietro Paolo Crescenzi, who was afterwards cardinal, and Abate Giacomo his brother, Marcello Vitelleschi, and others; and before he spoke to the cardinal he commanded all of them to kiss the feet of his Eminence, which they did. A day or two afterwards the same cardinal came into our church, and Francesco della Molara went and told the Saint of it. Philip answered, That pope, eh? Even while Sixtus V. was alive, Philip had in different ways pointed to Cardinal Sfondrato as the future pope; and once in particular, about a year before the death of Sixtus. The cardinal was in Philips room, according to his custom, with Marcello Vitelleschi and others. Philip said to Marcello, Open that cupboard, and give me the popes cap that is there: this was a cap which had belonged to S. Pius V. and was preserved by the holy father as a relic. Philip took it and tried to put it on the cardinals head, saying to him, Try it a little, and see how well it suits you, meaning by that to insinuate what was to be hereafter. Urban VII. who was chosen to succeed Sixtus, only lived twelve days, and then Cardinal Sfondrato was elected, and took the name of Gregory XIV.\n\nBut his prediction of the papacy to Cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandino, was even yet more wonderful. For some time before, the cardinal was in the garden of Curzio de Massimi, together with Cardinal Cusano, the Saint, and some others; and Father Curzio coming to Philip, said to him, I wish your Reverence would get me taken into the service of Cardinal Aldobrandino. Philip replied, I will do so without fail; leave it to me; for I tell you he will not die cardinal; and four months afterwards he was elected pope. The very evening before the election, he said to the Abate Marco Antonio Maffa, among others, that Aldobrandino would be pope, and would take the name of Clement, which he did; and that same evening Mgr. Papia sent the Saint a sonnet, asking him to pray that they might have a good pope and a speedy election, upon which Philip sent him another sonnet in reply, containing the same prophecy of Aldobrandinos election.\n\nTo Leo XI., before he was cardinal, and when he was the Grand Dukes ambassador, Philip made three prophecies in the few following words, Signor Alessandro, you will be cardinal and pope, but your reign will last a short time. Fra. Girolamo Ghetti, a Roman, who was afterwards general of the order of the hermits of S. Augustine, when he was preaching on the octave of the Saints canonization, declared that he heard this from Leos own mouth when he was cardinal; and it was confirmed by Gregory XV., for when he heard what Fra. Girolamo had said in his sermon, he added, I am sure it is true, for when I was auditor of the Rota, and went to kiss the feet of Leo XI., among other things he said, I shall not weary the people long, for I shall soon be out of the way, which was fulfilled by his early death.\n\nAlthough Philip almost always foresaw who would be pope, yet he never mentioned it except for some grave reason, or in familiar conversations with some of his penitents, as if he were in joke; and he used always to add, that we ought by no means to give easy credence to similar predictions, or to wish for them, because many deceits and snares of the devil might be hidden in them; and he was very harsh towards those who went to tell him that they had had revelations or made prophecies.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nPHILIP SEES THINGS WHICH HAPPEN AT A DISTANCE.\n\nPhilip had also received the gift of seeing things absent as though they were present. Late one Sunday morning, Cesare Baronius went to confess to him as usual. The holy father would not hear him, but bade him go to Santo Spirito to visit the sick. Baronius replied that it was past the time; the Saint however replied, Go and perform the obedience. He went, and as he was walking through the hospital, he saw a patient with the crucifix and lamp at his bed, as is usual with the dying. It so happened that the sufferer had come into the hospital the day before after the customary time, and therefore had been put to bed without having made his confession, and as he had worsened very much, they had given him Extreme Unction. Baronius went up to him, and asking him some questions, found that he had not been to confession. He heard his confession at once and gave him Communion, and the poor fellow died immediately. Baronius returned to the house and told the Saint, who said, Well now, another time you will have learned to obey without making any answer.\n\nFrancesco Maria Tarugi went to him one morning to confession, and Philip said to him, How is such a person? How long is it since you have seen her? go and visit her, and then come back to confession, for my heart is disturbed about her soul. This person was a servant in the hospital of San Giacomo of the Incurables, a very diligent and devout woman. Tarugi went, and found her with the cross at her bed-head, and just expiring; and he was thus enabled to assist her in this extremity. The same thing happened to a captain who was one of Philips penitents. One morning the Saint suddenly sent some person to inquire after him, and he was found at the point of death, and was thus furnished with all that he had need of in his last hour. Costanzo Tassone had fallen into a lethargy from which he could not be roused: the Saint said to one of the fathers of the congregation, Go to Costanzo who is dying. He went and found him asleep, whereupon he said to him, Awake, and take the Sacraments. Costanzo immediately awoke, made his confession, received the Communion and Extreme Unction, and then died.\n\nAs Antonio Fantini was one day going to Chiesa Nuova, some one through some slight pique threw a bucket of water on his head from a window, as he was passing through the street. This disturbed him exceedingly and filled him with resentment. When he entered the church he went to the holy father to confess; and the Saint, before he heard him, told him what had happened to him in the street, and bantered him about it, to Antonio's astonishment, who was sure Philip could not have learned it from any one else, because no one had been a witness of it, and if any one had been, the time was too short for him to have told it to Philip, who detailed every minutest circumstance. Upon another occasion he went out with several of his penitents, among whom was Marcello Ferro. When they came to the Campo di Fiore, the Saint called Marcello and said to him, Who are those people whom you have at your house? he replied, They are gentlemen, and are so and so, naming their names. Well, said the Saint, I tell you that you must anyhow look to this matter, and find some remedy for it, for they are there to do mischief; and if the matter is not remedied very shortly, bloodshed will ensue, and you will find out that all I am now telling you is true. All this he said, covering his face with his hands, and in a kind of ecstasy or abstraction of mind. Marcello was thunderstruck at these words, and in the greatest possible distress. As soon as he reached home he began to pray, and begged of God most earnestly to give him some proof of what Philip had said. He then put himself upon his guard, and paid the most minute attention to everything those persons did, and soon received positive proof of what had been told him, and was enabled by a little dexterity to ward off the danger.\n\nPaolo Ricuperati, referendary of both the Segnature, had conversed one evening with a beneficiary of S. Peters about some secret affairs of their own. The next morning he went to S. Girolamo della Carità, and Philip repeated to him with the utmost exactness all the conversation with its circumstances, just as they had really occurred. The prelate was overcome with astonishment, because he knew that the beneficiary was not acquainted with the Saint, and perhaps did not even know him; yet in order to be quite sure, he went to him and asked him, if he had been talking to any one of the business which they had conversed upon the evening before; and when he said that he had not, Ricuperati discovered that Philip had heard and seen in spirit all that had passed between them.\n\nOn one occasion the Saint had sent one of his spiritual children to some distance, and when he returned he gave Philip an account of all that had happened since he had been away. The Saint replied to it, I knew all this before, and yet the occurrences were such as he could not have known, except by Divine revelation. In like manner when he was once talking with Cardinal Frederic Borromeo about a secret business, and the cardinal asked him how he had come to the knowledge of it, Philip answered, I sometimes say things, and I do not know why I say them, but God makes me speak. Muzio Achillei, a priest at San Severino, when he had returned from Rome to his own country, gave himself up to a belief in dreams and visions, and to seek after sensible sweetnesses in devotion. He never conferred with any one about this, neither did he write a word of it to the holy father, but Philip nevertheless sent him letters warning him that he must not walk by that path, because it was easy to be deceived by the devil in those matters, and also to injure our bodily health; and furthermore he admonished him of a certain occasion of sin into which he had fallen rather by imprudence than out of an evil will, and gave him rules for avoiding similar dangers. Of all this Muzio himself affirmed that the holy father could know nothing except by Divine revelation, for he had not disclosed it to any one.\n\nGiovan Battista Lamberti, also one of Philips penitents, was informed by his father that his uncle at Messina was dead. This uncle had always said that he would make him his heir, and his property amounted to more than forty thousand crowns. When Lamberti heard this, he went to confer with Philip, to make his confession, and to ask his permission to set off for Messina. Philip, laying hold of him by his ear, made him lean his head against his breast, and held him in this position for some little time. Meanwhile Giovan Battista smelled so sweet a fragrance that he had never smelled anything like it; and Philip, lifting the penitents head up, looked fixedly at him with a joyous countenance, and said, My son, do not disturb yourself; there is no occasion for you to leave Rome, for your uncle is now quite well, and you will shortly have a letter from him, congratulating you on your coming to court, and sending you something (naming what it was) as a proof of his affection. Lamberti had such faith in Philip that he did not set off on his journey, and the following Tuesday he had a letter from his uncle, in which he informed him of his recovery, and also sent him a present. Giovan Battista was exceedingly astonished, and went immediately to tell the news to the Saint, and to thank him. But Philip, looking rather sternly at him, commanded him never to mention the matter to any one so long as he lived.\n\nGiovanni Atrina of Marsico in the kingdom of Naples, one of the Saints penitents, heard from his cousin that his mother was dead. As he was poor, he could afford to have only one mass said for her, and after that he went to Philip to recommend her to his prayers, but wept so bitterly that he could not articulate a single word. The Saint said to him, Go your way; there is no truth in the matter; your mother is not even ill; and a few days afterwards Giovanni heard from his mother who was in perfect health.\n\nGiulio Severa, a brother of the Congregation, went one morning to confess to him; and as he was going, some letters were given him which contained the news of his mothers death, although he had not before so much as heard that she was ill. Without mentioning it to any one he went to the Saint and knelt down; but before he could speak a word, Philip took his berretta off, and put it on Giulios head, and then twined round his neck a rosary which he had in his hand, and said to him, My son, sorrow no more, for your mother is gone to salvation; be cheerful therefore, and rejoice because of it. When Giulio heard these words he was overwhelmed with astonishment, as he had not spoken to any one on the subject, and had only just received the news himself. But as he believed implicitly the good news which Philip gave him, he ceased to mourn, and was delighted to think that he had some one now in Paradise to pray for him.\n\nBefore concluding this chapter it will not be foreign to my purpose to relate a piece of pleasantry similar to that which S. Gregory tells of S. Benedict in his Dialogues, about the servant whose master sent him to the Saint with two bottles of wine, but he hid one by the way, and the Saint saw him in spirit, and reproved him with dexterous charity, as S. Gregory relates at some length. Marcello Vitelleschi, out of affection to Philip, sent him two flasks of orange-flower water; the servant who was carrying them inadvertently broke one of them by the way. When he arrived with the one bottle, Philip smiled, and said, Come now, tell me the truth; you have drunk half of it on the road, have you not? The servant hearing this, and perceiving that Philip was alluding to the non-appearance of the other bottle, told him what had happened. When he returned home, he asked his master if he had told Father Philip that he was going to send him the two bottles of orange-flower water, and learning that Vitelleschi had never said anything to him about it, he perceived that the Saint had seen in spirit the accident he had had by the way.\n\nPhilip one day sent Egidio Calvelli, a most exemplary brother of the Congregation, upon a particular business. Egidio, turning a little out of his road, took that opportunity of visiting two churches to which he had a particular devotion. Philip saw the whole of this in spirit, and when the brother returned, he asked him where he had been. Egidio, not wishing to discover the little pious act which he had done, only replied that he had been to execute the business which his Reverence had entrusted to him. The Saint added, and where else have you been? and he, persisting in his equivocal answer, answered, I have been where your Reverence sent me. Then Philip replied, Ah you captain of gypsies! and why won't you tell"
