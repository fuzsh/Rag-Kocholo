        "text": "Kolkata, Jun 6 (UNI) West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday fondly remembered legendary Bollywood actor, director, and parliamentarian Sunil Dutt on his birth anniversary.\n\n“Fondly remembering legendary actor and my former colleague Sunil Dutt ji on his birth anniversary,” Ms Banerjee posted on her social networking page.\n\nBorn as Balraj Dutt on June 6, 1928, Sunil was known for many attributes in life – acclaimed actor, successful producer, talented director, renowned politician and Nargis' husband – but there was one key role he played in his life. He was the father of Sanjay Dutt aka Sanju.\n\nWhen Sanjay Dutt was convicted under TADA in the 1993 Bombay Blasts Case, for illegal possession of weapons, including an AK-56, Sunil Dutt took help from the Shiv Sena Founder, the late Bal Thackeray. People believe Sanjay Dutt was granted bail only because of Thackeray.\n\nIn Rajkumar Hirani-directorial Sanju, Paresh Rawal will be essaying the role of Sanjay Dutt’s father Sunil Dutt, who relentlessly believed in his son’s innocence. The film is slated to release on June 29th, 2018.\n\nSunil was especially known for his several acting roles as a dacoit (member of an armed gang of bandits). While he continued to act until the time of his death, he assumed other offscreen roles in the film industry and also became involved in politics and with various social issues.\n\nHe debuted in Hindi cinema withRailway Platform (1955), and his first major success came six movies later with Mother India (1957). His role in that movie was that of the outlaw hero Birju, and it remains one of Bollywood’s most-memorable performances of all time.\n\nSome of Dutt’s other successes at the box office were in Ek-hi-rasta (1956; “The Only Way”), Gumrah (1963; “Astray”), Waqt (1965; “Time”),Hamraaz (1967; “Confidant”), the comedy Padosan (1968; “Neighbour”), and Reshma aur Shera (1972; “Reshma and Shera”).\n\nDutt acted in some 100 films, produced seven, and directed 6. He made his directorial debut in 1964 with the daring, experimental one-man film,Yaadein, later known as Memories.\n\nOn May 25, 2005, Sunil passed away at his residence in Mumbai after suffering a heart attack. He was serving as a Cabinet Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports in the Union Government led by Dr. Manmohan Singh. However, his tenure was cut short by his untimely demise.\n\nUNI BM SJC"
