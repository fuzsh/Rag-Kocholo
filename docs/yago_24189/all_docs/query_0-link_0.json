When their families find out about their relationship, Chotu (Bachchan), Shera's mute sharpshooting brother carries out his father Sagat Singh's (Jayant) orders to kill Reshma's father (K. N. Singh) and her recently married brother Gopal (Ranjeet). Unable to bear the grief of Gopal's widowed bride (Raakhee), Shera kills his own father believing he actually pulled the trigger. After this tragedy, Reshma and Shera's family's feud will end in more tragedy as misunderstandings lead to more bloodshed between the clans.\n\nShera swears to kill Chotu and protect Reshma's family. Shera searches for Chotu, who hides in Reshma's house and seeks protection from her. The movie's climax is when Shera waits outside Reshma's house to kill Chotu. At the moment, Chotu and Reshma emerge from the house as a married couple. Shera notices sindoor on Reshma's forehead and realizes that he cannot kill Chotu since he is now her husband, thus ending the bloodshed. In his grief, Shera ends his own life using his rifle, just as Reshma to collapses after begging the skies to take her life away, with her corpse falling on that of Sheraâ€™s. As the two lovers lay dead in the desert, a windstorm takes plays, and buries their bodies within the sand.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nWaheeda Rehman as Reshma[4]\n\nSunil Dutt as Shera\n\nAmitabh Bachchan as Chhotu[5]\n\nVinod Khanna as Vijay\n\nRaakhee as Reshma's Sister-in-law\n\nRanjeet as Gopal\n\nJayant as Sagat Singh\n\nK.
