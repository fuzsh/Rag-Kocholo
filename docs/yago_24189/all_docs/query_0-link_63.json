        "text": "News\n\nentertainment\n\nhindi\n\nbollywood\n\nDid you know Sanjay Duttâs ancestors were landlords in Pakistan? â ETimes BFFS\n\nThis story is from September 17, 2023\n\nDid you know Sanjay Duttâs ancestors were landlords in Pakistan? â ETimes BFFS\n\nSunil Dutt and Nargis have left behind an illustrious family, which is carrying forward their legacy in films and politics. Their son Sanjay Dutt is an established actor, while daughter Priya Dutt is invested into politics. ETimes decodes the Dutt Dynasty in this week's Big Filmy Families.\n\nThe most handsome man of Bollywood, Sunil Dutt, hailed from a family of landlords who were settled in present-day Pakistan. He braved the partition and settled in India, working his way to become an acting legend. Sunil Dutt worked with the local electricity and transport board in Mumbai, charmed audiences with his voice on radio and eventually worked his way into movies.\n\nActing was nowhere on the horizon for the Dutts but Sunil proved it otherwise, by not just working in iconic films but also marrying timeless diva, Nargis . The Dutt family has been one of the best things that has happened to Bollywood.\n\nIn this weekâs BFFs, we discover more about the Dutt dynasty, which has its roots in the Rawalpindi region of West Punjab. We trace their history back to the pre-independence era and explore their glowing lineage in politics and Bollywood.\n\nSunil Dutt\n\nBorn as Balraj Dutt, this legend gave the country a lot of be proud about. Sunil Dutt's birth took place in pre-independent India on June 6, 1929. At the tender age of five, he suffered the loss of his father, Diwan Raghunath Dutt. As he turned 18, the partition drama unfolded and with his mother, Kulwantidevi, Dutt escaped from Pakistan and found refuge in Mandauli, now Haryana. After a stint in Lucknow, Sunil Dutt made his way to the city of dreams, which he would one day be a sheriff of.\n\nSpeaking about his ancestors, Sunil Dutt had revealed that years later when he visited his village Khurd in Pakistan's Punjab, the villagers had showered him with love. They respected his forefathers who were landlords and lived in harmony with Muslims.\n\nSunil Dutt is an alumnus of Jai Hind College in Mumbai and in 1954, he graduated with B.A. (Hons.) in History. As an undergraduate, he worked with the city's BEST Transportation Engineering division. Sunil Dutt's mastery of the Urdu language earned him popularity in the Hindi service of Radio Ceylon, South Asia's oldest radio station. His transition into the world of Hindi cinema began with his debut in the 1955 film 'Railway Platform'. In a career spanning decades, Sunil Dutt's most celebrated performances are Mother India (1957), Gumraah (1963), Waqt (1965), Khandaan (1965), Padosan (1968), Reshma Aur Shera (1971), and Mujhe Jeene Do (1963), which he also produced.\n\nIn 1968, the Government of India conferred upon him the prestigious Padma Shri. In 1984, Sunil Dutt made a significant move by joining the Indian National Congress party and he went on to serve five terms as a Member of Parliament from the Mumbai North West constituency. He also held the esteemed position of Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports in the Manmohan Singh government from 2004 to 2005. He passed away on May 25, 2005.\n\nNargis Dutt\n\nNargis exuded elegance every time she graced the silver screen and captivated a million hearts with her charismatic presence. She was named Fatima Rashid on her birth on June 1, 1929. Her father, Abdul Rashid converted to Islam from being an heir of the Mohyal Brahmin caste from Rawalpindi and married Jaddanbai Hussain, who was born in a Muslim family of Hindu Brahmin origin.\n\nNargis' mother was a celebrated Hindustani classical music singer and one of the first female music composers of Indian cinema.

In 1980, she received a nomination to the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of the Indian Parliament).

Years later, they shared the frame in Mehboob Khan's iconic movie Mother India.
