        "text": "Among Hindi cinema's leading men of the last century, Sunil Dutt, who passed away 16 years ago on May 25, did not hesitate in doing women-oriented films which addressed the issues of their upliftment, empowerment and equality.\n\nSubhash K Jha lists Sunil Dutt films where the actor played a reformist.\n\nSujata, 1959\n\nSunil Dutt and Nutan shared a special onscreen rapport that stretched into six films, none as relevant as Sujata.\n\nIn this Bimal Roy directed drama on the upliftment of an adopted Harijan girl, Duttsaab played Adhir, a progressive poet, who insists on marrying Sujata even as his conservative aunt (Lalita Pawar) threatens to disinherit him.\n\nWho can forget the lovelorn hero singing Majrooh Sultanpuri's Jalte Hain Jisskke Liye Mere Khwabon Ke Diye over the phone to the tearful heroine?\n\nSadhana, 1958\n\nA year before Sujata, it was Vyjanthimala in Sadhana whom a righteous professor brings home from a kotha and presents her as his wife to his ailing mother.\n\nIn the end, Duttsaab insists on marrying the tawaif.\n\nEven though samaaj thinks she doesn't deserve a second chance, he does.\n\nSahir Ludhianvi's hard-hitting poetry against the perverse practice of patriarchy still rings true: Aurat ne janam diya mardo ko, mardo ne use bazar diya. jab jee chaha masla kuchla, jab jee chaha dutkar diya.\n\nVyjanthimala, who did three films with Dutt, says, \"He was a true gentleman and a progressive man and a rational artiste. The way he conducted himself with Nargisji made every woman in India wish he could be their husband.\"\n\nNartaki, 1963\n\nAgain, the reformist. The man who doesn't only mouth feminism, he practises it.\n\nIn this neglected film directed by Nitin Bose, Duttsaab was Professor Nirmal Kumar, who won't let an uneducated daughter of a prostitute suffer her mother's fate.\n\nHe tutors Nanda into an enlightened world.\n\nDharmendra echoed Duttsaab's role in Sharafat and Chaitali.\n\nChirag, 1969\n\nWhen Asha cannot conceive, her mother-in-law (Lalita Pawar) insists that her son throw his wife out and remarry.\n\nNo prizes for guessing who plays the man who won't listen to his mother's evil plans.\n\nSunil Dutt stands by his wife and even looks after her when she loses her eyesight.\n\nAsha Parekh, who played Asha, recalls Sunil Dutt fondly: \"He was my friend and a very supportive co-star. Once when we were shooting together for Chhaya, I hid his chappals in the studio. He had to go home barefeet. He was full of hope and encouragement, kind considerate and generous. One felt safe when he was around.\"\n\nDarpan, 1970\n\nDuttsaab marries a prostitute (played by Waheeda Rehman) and brings her home.\n\nTrouble starts when men, who had slept with her in the past, begin to sneer at the marriage between a Ideologue and a Fallen Women.\n\nThe film shows Duttsaab fighting social and familial opposition to stand by his wife.\n\nAdhurthi Subba Rao, who earlier directed Duttsaab in the superhit Milan, insisted on naming his character Balraj Dutt.\n\nThat was the actor-MP's real name.\n\nZindagi Zindagi, 1972\n\nDr Sunil has a visitor from his past.\n\nThe woman he was once in love with is widowed and returns to his life. He then insists on marrying her.\n\nBengali legend Tapan Sinha's only Hindi film was a reformist drama about widow remarriage.\n\nWaheeda Rehman, who played the widow, says, \"It was always a pleasure working with Dutt Saab. I was directed by him in the great Mujhe Jeene Do and Reshma Aur Shera. I co-starred with him in several films. He was a thorough gentleman, chivalrous and courteous.\""
