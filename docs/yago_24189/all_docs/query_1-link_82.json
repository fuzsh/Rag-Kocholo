It was also nominated for the Golden Bear at the 22nd Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nWritten by S. Ali Raza, Reshma Aur Shera (1971) was a Romeo and Juliet styled love story that was set in Jaisalmer Rajasthan, with the two lovers belonging to warring Rajput families.\n\nFor her stellar performance in the film, Waheeda Rehman won the National Film Award for Best Actress at the 19th National Film Awards, making this Reshma Aur Shera poster, highly collectible!\n\nPrinted and circulated during the first release run of the film (somewhere in 1971), this vintage Bollywood poster was originally designed for publicity of the film but never ended up being used.\n\nThis vintage Reshma Aur Shera poster was originally designed in hand painted oil on canvas format by a Bollywood poster design studio in Bombay. The printed signature of Bollywood poster painter Vishnu is seen on the bottom left of this old Amitabh movie poster.\n\nStunning close up illustrations of the five key actors are seen prominently in this old Bollywood poster.

The two lovers, Waheeda Rehman (Reshma) and Sunil Dutt (Shera) are seen in miniature on the top of this vintage Bollywood poster. They are seen riding on a camel with the setting desert sun in the distance behind them. An overturned rifle is seen sticking out from the sand alongside, giving away the conflict in their love story.\n\nTypography used in this Reshma Aur Shera poster is entirely in English, with only a translation of the title appearing on the top in Devanagari Hindi as well. The English title appears illustrated in a striking diagonal font in blood red, accentuated with a yellow border.\n\nThe soundtrack album of Reshma Aur Shera (1971) was composed by Jaidev, which won him the National Film Award for Best Music Direction. The song “Ek Meethi Si Chubhan” sung by Lata Mangeshkar became popular at the time of it’s release."
