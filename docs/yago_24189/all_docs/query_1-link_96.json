        "text": "Born as Balraj Dutt in the Punjab province in the now present-day Pakistan, Sunil Dutt was a man of many talents. He not only starred in multiple successful films, but also produced and directed them. Do you know that one of the films that he made is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records?\n\nThe 1964 black and white Hindi film Yaadein, which was produced and directed by Sunil Dutt, featured only him throughout its entire runtime. Dutt's wife Nargis Dutt appears as a silhoutte in the final scene. It is listed in Guinness Book of World Records under the category \"Fewest actors in a narrative film.\" It also ended up winning the National Film Award for the Second Best Feature Film in Hindi.\n\nThere is also another very interesting anecdote related to another Sunil Dut directorial, Reshma aur Shera. Karan Johar's father Yash Johar was the production controller for the film and Dutt asked him to arrange for 100 camels for an important sequence. When Johar could arrange 99 camels instead of the 100 that the actor-filmmaker asked for, the latter walked off the sets.\n\nRecalling the incident, Karan Johar told Film Companion in a recent interview, \"Dutt sahab told my father overnight that for Reshma Aur Shera, he wanted 100 camels. My father was a production controller so he was given these requirements. Overnight, he went to the nearby villages and got the camels. They weren’t 100. He told him, ‘Dutt sahab, I am sorry. I couldn’t get you 100 camels. But I could get you 99.’ Dutt sahab looked at him and said ‘Pack up’ and walked off. He was serious because they weren’t 100 but 99 camels.\""
