        "text": "Be it hero, villain or comedy, there is no role that Sanjay Dutt cannot pull off with ease on the big screen.\n\nSanjay's first adult role in Bollywood was in 'Rocky' in 1981. But it was not his original debut. That came 10 years earlier.\n\nSanjay's entry into Bollywood was as a child actor when he played a Qawwali singer in the 1971 film 'Reshma Aur Shera'.\n\n'Reshma Aur Shera' was one of Big B's lesser known films before he became a star.\n\nSanjay has films like 'Double iSmart,' 'Sheran Di Kaum Punjabi,' 'KD - The Devil,' 'Baap,' and 'Welcome To The Jungle' set to come out in 2024.\n\nSanjay is almost 65, but he is far from done when it comes to acting. Like others, he is reinventing himself and evolving on the big screen."
