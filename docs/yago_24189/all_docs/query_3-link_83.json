Shera was played by Sunil Dutt.\n\nThe film, directed by Sunil Dutt, also starred Waheeda Rehman in the lead, and featured Vinod Khanna, Raakhee, Amitabh, Ranjeet, and Amrish Puri in key roles. Several fans said that Amitabh looked like Sonu Sood in the picture.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan regularly shares throwback pictures from his old films, on Instagram. He earlier shared a still from his film Naseeb, with the caption, \"The matador and the gun... film NASEEB... climax on a rotating Restaurant, a set built at Chandivali Studio and it rotated... so action scenes, drama, Restaurant on fire, all done while it rotated.\""
