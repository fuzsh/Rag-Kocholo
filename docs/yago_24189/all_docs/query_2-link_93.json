He was also Sheriff of Bombay In 1968, he was honoured with the Padma Shri by the Government of India.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nHe is making money but I am earning love. His money will get spent, but the respect and love that I get will remain for him when I leave. I only hope he keeps it up.Somewhere he will take care of my respect and love.\n\nAbout his son in Dawar, Ramesh (1 January 2006). Bollywood: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow. Star Publications. pp. 135. ISBN 978-1-905863-01-3.\n\nThere should be no statues or a street named after me, no postal stamp with my face or any a organization after me. I like people to remember me by following my work\n\nHis last wish noted in \"Bollywood: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow\", pages=135-36\n\nWe all are one, whichever religion we belong to\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter his visit to his village in Pakistan on aspects of better relation between India and Pakistan\"We all are one, whichever religion we belong to'\". Rediff.com. 25 may 2005 .\n\nDuring Partition, my entire family was saved by a Muslim. His name was Yakub -- a friend of my father's who lived a mile-and-a-half away from our village.\n\nSomehow, this hatred should come to an end. I am a believer of nonviolence. I believe we all are one, whichever religion we belong to.\n\nI wish it culminates in something positive and we can both grow economically. The money we spend on weapons can be used to give water to the people, to educate everybody, to give them medical aid and to give employment to the youth of the country.\n\nIf there is no friendship with one's neighbours, no one can progress.

It has to have a positive, dynamic image.\n\nAbove two in \"Violence is not the hallmark of the Congress\". Rediff.com .\n\nOne of my first tasks is to instill discipline into the organisation. We do not need slogan shouting. Too many 'leaders' do nothing but sit on podiums or get themselves photographed with other leaders. This must stop. The Youth Congress leaders must go back to the roots and serve the people. I want to bring back value-based politics to the youth wing.\n\nQuoted in \"Violence is not the hallmark of the Congress\".\n\nMy concept of secularism is to be a good human being who respects all religions.\n\nQuoted in \"Sunil Dutt — film star, peace activist, secularist, politician extraordinary\" in The Hindu.\n\nI never knew there was a romance. The only thing I knew was that she came into my life. I was not concerned about her past. I know these questions arise. But I am concerned about the person who comes in my life; what matters from that day on is how true the person is to me.
