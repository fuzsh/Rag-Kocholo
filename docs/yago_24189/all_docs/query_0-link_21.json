But, this film also had Vinod Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan , Rakhee, Ranjeet, K.N.Singh and Sulochana Didi, a in important roles.\n\nThis film was acclaimed by national and international critics and was nominated at the 22nd Berlin International film festival. It was also selected as Indian entry in the best foreign language film at the 44th Academy Awards. ‘Reshma aur Shera’ won three national awards, i.e. Best actress- Waheeda Rehman, Best music- Jaidev and best Cinematography – Ramachandra; which was a big honour. Most of the shooting of this film had taken place in the deserts of Rajasthan. Though actors Sunil Dutt and Vinod Khanna are no more amongst us today, it’s a big honour for other living legends like Waheeda Rehman, Amitabh Bachchan, Rakhee, Ranjeet and Sulochana Didi, to watch their film celebrating 50 years."
