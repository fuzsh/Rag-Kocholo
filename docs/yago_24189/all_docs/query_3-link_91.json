        "text": "“Reshma Aur Shera”(1971) is a movie which was produced and direced by Sunil Dutt. The movie had Sunil Dutt, Waheeda Rehman, Amitabh Bachchan, Jayant, Sulochana, Amrish Puri, Dulari, Sudhir, B. B. Bhalla, Guddy, Padma Khanna, Sunil Dutt, Vinod Khanna, Rakhee Gulzar, K. N. Singh etc in it.\n\nThe movie had an impressive starcast in hindsight. Amitabh Bachchan, who later on became the reigning superstar was in fact in a bit role without any dialogues and hardly resembled the superstar that he was to become in a couple of years time. Vinod Khanna was also there in the movie and he was just as charismatic in this movie as always.\n\nThe movie flopped at the box office. Many careers suffered as a result. Music director Jaidev was one of them who had composed some nice music in this movie which failed to take off in the popularity stakes. I have discussed the list of the top 16 songs in 1971 in an earlier post and it can be seen that the songs of “Reshma Aur Shera” (1971) were nowhere in contention when it came to the most popular songs of the year.\n\nThe songs on their own were nice songs to listen to. With passage of time, music lovers can appreciate these songs better, without needing to compare these songs with the other more popular songs from hit movies.\n\nToday (6th of january) is the death anniversary of Jaidev. On this occasion, here is a song from “Reshma Aur Shera” (1971). This song is sung by Lata and it is picturised on Waheeda Rehman and Sunil Dutt. Balkavi Bairaagi is the lyricist.\n\nLyrics of this song were sent to me by nahm.\n\nSong-Tu chanda main chaandni (Reshma Aur Shera)(1971) Singer-Lata, Lyrics-Balkavi Bairaagi, MD-Jaidev\n\nLyrics(Provided by nahm)\n\ntu chandaa\n\nmain chaandani\n\nchaandani\n\nchaandani\n\ntu chandaa\n\nmain chaandni\n\ntu tarwar\n\nmain shaakh re\n\ntu baadal\n\nmain bijuree\n\ntu baadal\n\nmain bijuree\n\ntu panchhi\n\nmain paakh re\n\ntu baadal\n\nmain bijuree\n\ntu panchhi\n\nmain paakh re\n\ntu chandaa\n\nmain chaandni\n\ntujhe aanchal mein rakkhoongi\n\no saanvre\n\ntujhe aanchal mein rakkhoongi\n\no saanvre\n\nkaali alkon se baandhoongi\n\nye paaon re\n\nkaali alkon se baandhoongi\n\nye paaon re\n\ngalbaiyyan va daalon ke chhoote nahin\n\ngalbaiyyan va daalon ke chhoote nahin\n\nmeraa sapnaa sajan ab toote nahin\n\nmehendi rachee hathheliyaan\n\nmehendi rachee hathheliyaan\n\nmere kaajar waare nain re\n\npal pal tujhe pukaar ke\n\npiyaa pal pal tujhe pukaar ke\n\nho ho kar bechain re\n\nbechain re\n\nho ho kar bechain re"
