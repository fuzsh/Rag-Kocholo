        "text": "Indian composer (1918–1987)\n\nFor the Sanskrit poet, see Jayadeva.\n\nJaidev (3 August 1918[1][2] – 6 January 1987; born Jaidev Verma) was a music composer in Hindi films, most known for his work in films: Hum Dono (1961), Reshma Aur Shera (1971), Prem Parbat (1973), Gharaonda (1977) and Gaman (1978).\n\nHe won the National Film Award for Best Music Direction, three times for Reshma Aur Shera (1972), Gaman (1979) and Ankahee (1985).\n\nJaidev was born in Nairobi and brought up in Ludhiana, India. In 1933, when he was 15 years old, he ran away to Mumbai to become a film star. There, he acted in eight films as a child star for the Wadia Film Company. He was initiated into music at a young age in Ludhiana by Prof. Barkat Rai. Later, when he made it Mumbai, he learnt music from Krishnarao Jaokar and Janardan Jaokar.\n\nUnfortunately, he had to leave his film career abruptly and return to Ludhiana, due to his father’s blindness, which thrust the sole responsibility of his family on his young shoulders.\n\nAfter his father died, Jaidev took the responsibility of looking after his sister, Ved Kumari and later got her married to Sat-Paul Varma. After that in 1943, he left for Lucknow to study under the tutelage of music maestro Ustad Ali Akbar Khan.\n\nJaidev was the first music director to bag 3 National Awards. Ali Akbar Khan took Jaidev as his music assistant, in 1951, when he composed music for Navketan Films's Aandhiyan (1952) and 'Hum Safar'. From film 'Taxi Driver' on, he became assistant to music composer, S. D. Burman.\n\nHis big break as a full-fledged music director came with Chetan Anand's film, Joru Ka Bhai, followed by Chetan Anand's next Anjali, both of these films became very popular.\n\nThough it was with the film Navketan's Hum Dono (1961) that Jaidev true came into the limelight, with classic songs like, \"Allah Tero Naam\", \"Abhi Na Jao Chhodkar\", \"Main Zindagi Ka Saath\" and \"Kabhi khud pe Kabhi Halat pe\". His other big success came with Sunil Dutt star, Mujhe Jeene Do (1963).\n\nThough many of Jaidev's films failed at the box office, many of them, such as Alaap, Kinare Kinare and Ankahee, are remembered for his imaginative musical scores. Jaidev shot to prominence once again with his ghazals and songs in Muzaffar Ali's Gaman like Seene mein jalan, Raat bhar aapki yaad aati rahi and Ajeeb saaneha mujhpar guzar gaya yaaron. He introduced many new singers like Suresh Wadkar, A Hariharan and his protegee Chhaya Ganguly in Gaman.\n\nJaidev had a unique capability to mix traditional and folk music into Hindi film situations, giving him a unique advantage to other music directors of his times.\n\nHe also known for his non-film album of the couplets of Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan's classic work Madhushala set to music and sung by singer Manna Dey.\n\nHe is one of the favourite composers of Lata Mangeshkar besides Salil Chowdhury and Madan Mohan. He also composed music for Nepali film Maitighar.\n\nJaidev never married. He remained close to his sister's family who later settled in the United Kingdom. He died on 6 January 1987 at the age of 68.\n\nJoru Ka Bhai (1955)\n\nSamudri Daaku (1956)\n\nAnjali (1957)\n\nArpan (1957)\n\nRaat Ke Raahi (1959)\n\nEk Ke Baad Ek as a music assistant\n\nHum Dono (1961)\n\nKinare Kinare (1963)\n\nMujhe Jeene Do (1963)\n\nMaitighar (Nepali film) (1966)\n\nHamare Gham Se Mat Khelo (1967)\n\nJiyo Aur Jeene Do (1969)\n\nSapna (1969)\n\nAshadh Ka Ek Din (1971)\n\nDo Boond Pani (1971)\n\nEk Thi Reeta (1971)\n\nReshma Aur Shera (1971)\n\nSampoorn Dev Darshan (1971)\n\nAatish, aka Daulat Ka Nasha (1972)\n\nBhaavna (1972)\n\nBharat Darshan (1972)\n\nMan Jaiye (1972)\n\nAalingan (1973)\n\nAazadi Pachchis Baras Ki (1973)\n\nPrem Parbat (1973)\n\nFaasla (1974)\n\nParinay (1974)\n\nAndolan (1975)\n\nEk Hans Ka Joda (1975)\n\nShadi Kar Lo (1975)\n\nLaila Majnu (1976)\n\nAlaap (1977)\n\nGharonda (1977)\n\nKissa Kursee Ka (1977)\n\nWohi Baat, aka Sameera (1977)\n\nDoooriyan (1978)\n\nGaman (1978)\n\nSolva Sawan (1978)\n\nTumhare Liye (1978)\n\nAai Teri Yaad (1980)\n\nEk Gunah Aur Sahi (1980)\n\nRamnagri (1982)\n\nEk Naya Itihaas (1983)\n\nAmar Jyoti (1984)\n\nAnkahee (1984)\n\nJumbish (1985)\n\nTrikon Ka Chautha Kon (1986)\n\nKhunnus (1987)\n\nChand Grahan (1997)\n\nChalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958) (music assistant)\n\nLajwanti (1958) (music assistant)\n\nKeemat (1973)\n\nMiss Frontier Mail (1936)\n\nHunterwali (1935)\n\nMarthanda Varma (1933)\n\nNational Film Award for Best Music Direction:\n\nAnkahee (1985) [3]\n\nGaman (1979)\n\nReshma Aur Shera (1972)\n\nSur Singar Samsad Awards, four times\n\nLata Mangeshkar Award Madhya Pradesh Government."
