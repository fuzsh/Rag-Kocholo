        "text": "Sunil Dutt is a memorable name in the history of Indian Cinema. This tall, handsome man with a charming smile and dashing personality ruled Bollywood in the ‘50s and ‘60s. In later years, he also forayed into film production and direction. He has featured in some of the most iconic Hindi Films of all time. After quitting films, Sunil Dutt became the Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports in the Manmohan Singh government (2004–2005). He has also served as a Sheriff of Mumbai.\n\nAhead of his 92nd birth anniversary, here is a list of things that you didn’t know about Sunil Dutt: -\n\n1. Sunil Dutt’s real name is BalrajDutt. The director of his first film Railway Platform Mr. Ramesh Saigal gave this name to him to avoid any confusion with the veteran actor BalrajSahni.\n\n2. There’s a nice story about how Sunil Dutt got his first Bollywood movie offer. Sunil Dutt was then working at Radio Ceylon as his command over the Urdu language was immense. While hosting his show Lipton Ki Mehfil on Radio Ceylon, Dutt Saab met Ramesh Saigal who was impressed by the personality of this bright young man. Also, Sunil Dutt’s great voice helped him land this role.\n\n3. Mother India - the 1957 epic drama film is a landmark in Indian Cinema. This movie covered many social issues and ignited many questions. Sunil Dutt played the role of Birju, the youngest son of Radha whom she later kills. Radha was played by Nargis who won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for an intense portrayal. Just like in the movies, there was a fire in the set and Sunil Dutt threw himself in that to save Nargis Ji’s life. Romance brewed between them and they tied the knot in 1958. (Download Mzaalo - the online free movie watching app for your android or iOS and watch this Bollywood drama in full HD for free. Also, you can win exciting reward coins from brands like Lal Mahal, Ixigo, Croma, etc.)\n\n4. Way before this Mother India film happened when Sunil Dutt Saab was a Radio Presenter at Radio Ceylon, he had to interview Nargis Ji. The show had to be canceled because he couldn’t utter a single word in front of the finest actress of Bollywood. Isn’t that surreal- how destiny planned to unite them?\n\n5. Nargis died of pancreatic cancer and after that Dutt Saab laid the foundation of “The NargisDutt Foundation” in the loving memory of his wife to help cure cancer patients.\n\n6. Sunil Dutt was a sponsor of the India Project, an organization like Operation Smile for the treatment of Indian children with facial deformities.\n\n7. Do you know that in the year 1988, Sunil Dutt walked from Nagasaki to Hiroshima to appeal for global demilitarization?\n\n8. In 1968, the Government of India honored Mr. Sunil Dutt with Padma Shri for his contribution to the field of art and entertainment.\n\n9. Sunil Dutt debuted as a director with the 1964 movie titled Yaadein. The strange fact about this movie is that it had only one actor and that was Sunil Dutt. This film was thus featured in the Guinness Book of Records for “Fewest Actors in a Narrative Film”.\n\n10. For MujheJeene Do (1963) and Khandan (1965), Sunil Dutt won Filmfare Award for Best Actor. He also won BFJA Award for Milan in 1967. The Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award was given to him in 1995."
