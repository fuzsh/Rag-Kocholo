Sunil Dutt nearly went bankrupt producing this movie.The original Reshma aur Shera ( if my memory serves me right ) was directed by some another person ( who was supposed to be a great 'new wave' director of that era !!!) .That film sounded and looked like a documentary film.Sunil Dutt had to take over the reins and lo and behold we have at least 3 new upcoming and future superstars in that film ...Amitabh Bacchan , Ranjit and Raakhee. Music by Jaidev as always was excellent and he used raag todi and marwah which essentially enmates the flavour of Rajasthan. The song Tu Chanda ... still brings tears to my eyes after all these years.Mind you when I first saw that film I was a teenager.To me it was the the greatest composition ever sung with such feeling and fantastic portrayal of emotion contained in the lyrics , by Lata Mangeshkar. In that one song one can experience the love, the pain , the hope and the longing. We shall ever be thankful to Sunil Dutt , Jaidev and Lata Mangeshkar
