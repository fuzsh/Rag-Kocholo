“Reshma Aur Shera”(1971) is a movie which was produced and direced by Sunil Dutt. The movie had Sunil Dutt, Waheeda Rehman, Amitabh Bachchan, Jayant, Sulochana, Amrish Puri, Dulari, Sudhir, B. B. Bhalla, Guddy, Padma Khanna, Sunil Dutt, Vinod Khanna, Rakhee Gulzar, K. N. Singh etc in it.

The movie had an impressive starcast in hindsight. Amitabh Bachchan, who later on became the reigning superstar was in fact in a bit role without any dialogues and hardly resembled the superstar that he was to become in a couple of years time. Vinod Khanna was also there in the movie and he was just as charismatic in this movie as always.

The movie flopped at the box office. Many careers suffered as a result. Music director Jaidev was one of them who had composed some nice music in this movie which failed to take off in the popularity stakes. I have discussed the list of the top 16 songs in 1971 in an earlier post and it can be seen that the songs of “Reshma Aur Shera” (1971) were nowhere in contention when it came to the most popular songs of the year.

The songs on their own were nice songs to listen to. With passage of time, music lovers can appreciate these songs better, without needing to compare these songs with the other more popular songs from hit movies.

Today (6th of january) is the death anniversary of Jaidev. On this occasion, here is a song from “Reshma Aur Shera” (1971). This song is sung by Lata and it is picturised on Waheeda Rehman and Sunil Dutt. Balkavi Bairaagi is the lyricist.

Lyrics(Provided by nahm)

tu chandaa

main chaandani

chaandani

chaandani

tu chandaa

main chaandni

tu tarwar

main shaakh re

tu baadal

main bijuree

tu baadal

main bijuree

tu panchhi

main paakh re

tu baadal

main bijuree

tu panchhi

main paakh re

tu chandaa

main chaandni

tujhe aanchal mein rakkhoongi

o saanvre

tujhe aanchal mein rakkhoongi

o saanvre

kaali alkon se baandhoongi

ye paaon re

kaali alkon se baandhoongi

ye paaon re

galbaiyyan va daalon ke chhoote nahin

galbaiyyan va daalon ke chhoote nahin

meraa sapnaa sajan ab toote nahin

mehendi rachee hathheliyaan

mehendi rachee hathheliyaan

mere kaajar waare nain re

pal pal tujhe pukaar ke

piyaa pal pal tujhe pukaar ke

ho ho kar bechain re

bechain re

ho ho kar bechain re
