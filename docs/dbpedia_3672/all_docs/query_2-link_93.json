        "text": "I remember saying, \"I bet Thompson won't be watching Match of the Day tonight\" when we were leaving. I wonder whether he did?\n\nThat was all you got on MotD in those days - two minutes if you were lucky.\n\nNIce to see SB as it was, even with the wall down.\n\nTrevor Thompson a great attacking full back, I still recall his mazy run solo goal at home to Aldershot in a midweek match. Defensively he was suspect, but a great Imp.\n\nTrevor Thompson? Really? I don't remember that at all. I do remember the one he scored against Tranmere, which had a bigger gate because it was the game after the 8-0 win over Northampton.\n\nTrevor Thompson? Really? I don't remember that at all. I do remember the one he scored against Tranmere, which had a bigger gate because it was the game after the 8-0 win over Northampton.\n\nI'm not the curator of your memory.\n\nIt was a small clip, but it demonstrated what a great footballer that 'big' TC was. Back in the day I recall seeing him walking down Lincoln High Street in his cowboy boots, what a man mountain, he would be worth a million in prizes today.\n\nMy first local derby, about my 6th or 7th match and remember it being a big deal about being on telly.\n\nAgree, the best kit ever, but I'm probably influenced because my first season.\n\nAnd remember big Tony used to get a right battering from CBs - tough player\n\nThanks for posting that. 8,500 there if I remember rightly. Remember looking forward to MotD so much and being disappointed with the brief footage shown. Still good to see the bog rolls flying onto the pitch. 'Big' Dave Carr was a 7/10 Sam of his day. Another one who went too soon.\n\nLoved this side and Trevor T . Watched it on the wall at the back of the bank with granddad and uncles. In the late 90's I worked with TT at the Royal Mail and he was mad as a hatter. In a good way.\n\nI'm not the curator of your memory.\n\nHave just checked it - the only goal Thompson ever scored was the one against Tranmere. You must be thinking of that one.\n\nI never realised Keeley played so many games for Scunny before signing for us. And Carr barely missed a game during his three seasons with us, helped us win promotion and was then given a free transfer, leaving for Torquay. Anyone recall there feelings at the time of his departure? I was a bit young back then.\n\nHow the heck did you find this clip? I haven’t seen it since the actual night it was on MOTD ?? We drew with Bradford 1-1 the next home game which made Football Special on YTV but with only half of the crowd .... how fickle we were back then? ??\n\nI never realised Keeley played so many games for Scunny before signing for us.

Anyone recall there feelings at the time of his departure? I was a bit young back then.\n\nI thought he was one of the weaker players in a team of top players. Akin to Paul Parker playing for England.\n\nHe scored at Fulham. God that was a frenetic final ten minutes. How we didn’t score again fits me to this day.\n\nPeople talk about the quality of our current side but look at that era back then. How many players went on to play at a higher level and in the top flight? Cockerill, Hobson, Cunningham, Peake, Felgate, Shipley, Turner, Harford, Naylor, Thompson..."
