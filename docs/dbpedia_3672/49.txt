Trevor Thompson is an Emmy Award-winning television journalist and a graduate of USCâs prestigious Annenberg School for Communication and Thornton School of Music. Trevorâs work has been broadcast on NBC and ABC stations across the country and shared by CNN. He most recently reported for the NBC affiliate in Las Vegas, NV, where he received acclaim for his piece on a local band, Parade of Lights, who composed a song that was featured during the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Trevor is the son of BMI Award-winning composer Tim Thompson. A love of music is a genetic trait in the Thompson family, although Trevorâs father must have forgotten to pass down the gene for actual musical talent. Trevor calls two places home â Los Angeles and Nashville a.k.a. Music City, where he went to high school.
