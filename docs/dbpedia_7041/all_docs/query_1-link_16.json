        "text": "FALL RIVER — Nearly fifty years ago, Joseph V.R. Camara went on a mission in Vietnam that earned him several valor awards but still haunts him to this day.\n\nOn Dec. 4, 1967, serving as a boatswain’s mate 3rd class in the Navy, Camara was at the wheel of an ATC 111-8 (Armored Troop Carrier) when his crewmate Robert Moras tapped him on the shoulder.\n\n“Look, you’ve been driving for the last four and a half hours, let me give you a break,” recalled Camara on Monday.\n\nAs he stepped away, a B40 rocket slammed into the coxswain’s flat.\n\n“He died. Three seconds before that would have been me,” Camara said, his voice chocked with emotion.\n\nThe ambush left two dead and multiple injured. Camara’s face was peppered with shrapnel and covered with blood.\n\n“It was scary,” Cabral admitted.\n\nYet, that did not deter the 24-year-old Azorean immigrant from Fall River from jumping back on the wheel.\n\nThe force of the blast had blown the boat to the side of the river, perpendicular to the beach, and the fate of the soldiers and 15 boats they were transporting was now in his hands.\n\n“I knew that I was the only one capable of driving that boat,” Camara said Monday, downplaying his brave and selfless actions.\n\nHe put the boat back in line and sailed it away without flap — only protected by the bar armor.\n\nAfter spending a month in the hospital, Camara went back to the front line.\n\nFor his heroism that day, the Navy awarded him a Purple Heart Medal and a Commendation Medal with Combat V.\n\nCamara said his DD-214 discharge paperwork lists 17 medals, including a Bronze Star he is yet to receive.\n\n“Just before I was supposed to receive the Bronze Star, we were ambushed,” he recalled. “It was too dangerous and we had to get out of there.”\n\nCamara was discharged from the Navy in November of 1968. He resumed his duties as a construction worker and later became a postal worker, retiring 24 years ago as a delivery supervisor. He currently resides in Freetown.\n\nUntil recently, he would not talk about that traumatic day in Mekong Delta or any experiences he had in Vietnam at all for that matter.\n\n“I still have bad dreams about it,” said Camara, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder a few years ago.\n\n“The Vietnam War was not well accepted by the U.S public,” he added. “People spat on my face when I came back and there were protests everywhere. We [Vietnam vets] kept to ourselves. I never talked about it until three years ago.”\n\nThat’s when he was contacted by John Darrell Sherwood, an American author who specializes in military history and has published five books.\n\n“He asked if he could publish my story,” Camara said.\n\nSince then, he has started coming to grips with things he experienced during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe details of the infamous battle between his river assault division and Viet Cong guerrillas are recounted in Sherwood’s latest book “War in the Shallows: U.S. Navy Coastal and Riverine Warfare in Vietnam 1965-1968.”\n\nBut for Camara, it was never really about awards, fame or glory. Instead, it was serving the country that he loves so dearly.\n\n“I came from a very poor family in the Azores. This country did a lot for me, so I wanted to give back and I enlisted,” he said.\n\nA native of Santa Bárbara in Ponta Delgada, Azores, Camara emigrated with his family to Fall River in 1954 at the age of 11.\n\n“My mother was born in the United States, but her family went back to the Azores,” Camara said.\n\nHe became a U.S. citizen at age 16 and joined the Navy in 1964.\n\nHe eventually was assigned to a nuclear guided missile ship, but didn’t like it.\n\n“I found it boring to be out at sea,” he said. “I figured I was not doing enough, so I volunteered to go to Vietnam.”\n\nCamara will be honored as the grand marshal of the Veteran’s Parade in Fall River. The parade will step-off Nov. 11 at 1 p.m. from upper Kennedy Park and will travel north on South Main Street to the Fall River Government Center for the concluding ceremonies. Line up for parade participants will begin at 12 p.m. at the park.\n\n“It will be a great honor to represent the city, but there’s a lot of people like me out there,” he said.\n\nCamara said he never made an effort until this point to try to receive the medals he is owed, but he is now reconsidering it.\n\n“My grandchildren take a lot of pride in it and sometimes talk about me in school,” he said. “It would be nice to leave the medals to them.”\n\nThat would be the best part of it all, he concluded."
