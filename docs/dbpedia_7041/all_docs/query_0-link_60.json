        "text": "Marion and Hungry Mother State Park by Ken Heath\n\nSituated in Virginia's southwestern corner in the splendor of the Blue Ridge Mountain Highlands, Marion and neighboring Hungry Mother State Park are steeped in natural beauty. Marion, the name chosen to honor American Revolutionary War hero Gen. Francis Marion, was officially incorporated by the General Assembly on March 15, 1849. The railroad arrived in 1856 and fueled the economy by promoting industrial growth throughout the region. In 1933, John D. and Mildred Lincoln donated 1,881 acres to the state for the establishment of a state park on Hungry Mother Creek. On June 13, 1936, the park was officially dedicated with public opening ceremonies at Hungry Mother State Park, and more than 5,000 turned out to see the park as Gov. George Peery and State Park Director Robert Burson officiated. (Credit: Back cover of book.)\n\n$20.00\n\nSmyth County by Kimberly Barr Byrd and Debra J.

(Taken from rear cover)\n\n$20.00\n\nSherwood Anderson: An American Career by John E. Bassett\n\nSherwood Anderson: An American Career\" is the first critical introduction to this important Midwestern and American writer in over a quarter century. While reevaluating the accomplishments in Winesburg, Ohio and Anderson's other novels and short stories, it pays more attention to his non-fictional, autobiographical, and journalistic writing than do previous studies. It draws on unpublished manuscripts in the Newberry Library Anderson papers that shed new light on a prolific career, manuscripts such as \"Talbott Whittingham\" and \"An Ohio Paper.\" (Inside dust jacket)\n\n$30.00\n\nSherwood Anderson Remembered by Welford D. Taylor\n\nIn 1912, Sherwood Anderson suffered the mental and artistic break that has since become a firmly embedded legend in American literary history. A successful businessman in Ohio, he began to speak incoherently while dictating a letter at his desk and walked out of his office, to be found four days later and a hundred miles away, disoriented and exhausted. Within weeks, he had quit his former life, moved to Chicago, and become the writer who would produce, among other works, Winesburg, Ohio, the landmark collection of stories which transformed American literature by disregarding the norms of realism and naturalism and foregrounding the lyrical voices of the isolated in a distinctive, modern way. Anderson served as a mentor to writers like Faulkner and Hemingway early in their careers and befriended a remarkable number of American writers, among them, Carl Sandburg, Ben Hecht, John Dos Passos, James T. Farrell, Gertrude Stein, Henry Miller, and Anita Loos. Anderson was notoriously elusive, and autobiographical accounts of his breakdown and life vary wildly. Sherwood Anderson Remembered offers an intimate account of Anderson and the impressions he made on his contemporaries. The anecdotes collected in this volume constitute some of the best and most vivid assessments of his personality and work available. Together they create a richly detailed account of an individual who left an indelible mark on those touched by his presence and his words. (Inside dust Jacket)\n\n$40.00\n\nCertain Things Last by Charles E. Modlin\n\nThis collection of 30 post- Winesburg, Ohio stories includes three previously unpublished and six previously uncollected stories. Several others, including two that had been radically revised, have been restored by Modlin to what he believes were Anderson's original intentions. The stories, which generally address the storytelling process, are wonderfully well crafted and still enjoyable today. Using mostly male narrators and often involving initiation rites, they give us a male perspective of small-town Midwestern life during the first 40 years of this century. The unquestioned racism and sexism occasionally revealed by the narrators may disturb some readers, but these attitudes were realities of American life that must be faced. Highly recommended, particularly for American literature collections in academic libraries. - Judy Mimken, Saginaw Valley State Univ., Mich. Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.\n\n$17.50\n\nPathfinders, Pioneers, & Patriots by Danny Dixon\n\nThe story of our history is a fascinating one that grows ever more so as one learns more and more about the people and events that shaped it. Although much has been well documented, much more has been lost and may never be recovered. This book is an attempt to gather together some of the fragmented details and stories that have survived and to place them in context with better known historical events - so they can better be understood and appreciated. (Taken from rear cover)\n\n$20.00\n\nFaster Pastor by Sharyn McCrumb\n\nCamber Berkley, a young stock car driver, wrecks his car on a winding mountain road, landing right during the funeral of an elderly NASCAR fan. As punishment for his spectacular car wreck, the local authorities of the small Tennessee town of Judas Grove give him a choice: serve three months in jail for reckless driving or spend two weeks teaching the local ministers to drive stock cars, so that they can compete in a race whose prize is the $2 million legacy left by that deceased NASCAR fan. (credit: Sharyn McCrumb website.)\n\n$20.00\n\nGrave Passions by R Marie McIntyre\n\nAllison Canyer lives a typical life; she is a successful businesswoman with a dedicated, successful boyfriend.

(Taken from back cover)\n\n$20.00\n\nBlood on the Constitution by R. S. Sukle\n\nAll might be free if they valued freedom and defended it as they should. - Samuel Adams In the late 1920's, the well-oiled machine of capitalist interest ran roughshod over the civil rights of American workers. Blood on the Constitution follows Teddy Albert Gall through the horrific world of brutality, rape, exploitation, and murder that characterized this era for so many whose voices were lost to history. Albert, as he is called, ex-marine and talented prize fighter, is drawn into the deadly world of the trade union movement, unions, big business, mafia, and the ranks of the oppressed and the oppressors all struggle for supremacy. Teddy enters the fray, compelled by his noble sense of justice, yet tortured by the fact that he is endangering the lives and livelihoods of those around him... pursued by a psychotic serial hit man and pursuing happiness with the woman he loves. In Blood on the Constitution, the long-awaited sequel to The Ragman's War, Sukle provides a fascinating and impeccably researched insight into a key period that shaped the America we know today. Its compelling characters and shocking tales are skillfully interwoven, culminating in an unforgettable climactic confrontation. (Back Cover)\n\n$14.00\n\nMiner Injustice: The Ragman’s War by R. S. Sukle\n\nSukle's book is well researched, and her dialogue rings true to the accent and the feeling of those fraught times. It is a praiseworthy effort, and one expects to see more of Sukle as a writer/historian.-Barbara Bamberger Scott, Women Writers ReviewDuring the coal strike of 1927, the coalfields of western Pennsylvania become a hotbed of tension and terror.A mine mechanic and World War I hero, Ragman walks away from his job at the Russellton Mine.

Appointed by the governor to break the strike and evict the miners from their homes, he imposes unconstitutional restrictions to keep out relief workers and organizers.Thus begins an intricate, emotional tangle that leads Ragman and his fellow activists on an escalating, fanatical path of revenge and self-discovery, culminating in a life-and-death struggle.
