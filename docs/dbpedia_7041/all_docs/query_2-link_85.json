        "text": "On May 8, 1945, Victory in Europe was celebrated across the world, as millions rejoiced in the defeat of Nazi Germany. Several months later, in August 1945, Japan surrendered to the Allies as well, leading to VJ Day on September 2, 1945.\n\nPerhaps no event in history has reshaped the world in the manner and scale of the Second World War. Virtually every corner of the world was impacted by the conflict, and its consequences are still felt generations later.\n\nIn light of the 75 year anniversary of the end of World War II in 2020, the staff of Eisenhower National Historic Site and Gettysburg National Military Park wanted to take a moment to recognize the connections we all share to the “greatest generation” of World War II veterans. Below is a list compiled by the staff and volunteers of Eisenhower National Historic Site and Gettysburg National Military Park, a list of our fathers, grandfathers, great-uncles, loved ones, and friends who served in the Second World War. You will find that some of them have photos or brief stories included about them as well. Whether all we have is a name, or a photo, or a story, it is enough to remember them and their service.\n\nIt is important to remember that this World War II generation was composed of ordinary individuals who worked together to accomplish extraordinary things in the name of a common goal. Dwight Eisenhower himself noted, in his VE Day message, “As we celebrate Victory in Europe, let us remind ourselves that our common problems of the immediate and distant future can best be solved in the same conceptions of cooperation and devotion to the cause of human freedom as have made this Expeditionary Force such a mighty engine of righteous destruction.”\n\nIn this spirit, let us remember our friends and loved ones who served our country in World War II, and never forget their example."
