        "text": "2016 -\n\nThe following entries constitute an online addendum to the 2009 published piece in Prologue, which spotlights examples of \"acknowledgments\" to archivists working at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), as found in various works of nonfiction. Although all of these acknowledgments (and many more) deserved inclusion in the piece, not all could be due to space limitations in Prologue’s printed edition. Here we have listed the acknowledgments to NARA and its archival staff in fuller form, so that the reader might gain a better understanding of the scope of NARA’s influence on the type of work produced by authors and historians over the years. Time and resources permitting, the present list will be supplemented with additional entries as they become known. Readers should feel free to contact Chief Librarian Jeffery Hartley at alic@nara.gov with additional suggestions for inclusion on this list.\n\nSee Also:\n\nAcknowledgements, 1990-2015\n\nAdler, Jessica L. Burdens of War: Creating the United States Veterans Health System (2017).\n\n\"At the National Archives and Records Administration in College Park, Maryland, Mitch Yockelson and Haley Maynard provided expert assistance with World War I-era government records. Juliette Arai and Paul Harrison offered valuable guidance at the National Archives in Washington, DC, especially as I attempted to decipher the complex finding aids of Record Group 15. Likewise, Richard McCulley and Kate Mollan helped me navigate House and Senate records at the Center for Legislative Archives in Washington.\"\n\nAgran, Edward Gale. Herbert Hoover and the Commodification of Middle-Class America: An American Promise (2016).\n\n\"The staff at the Hoover Presidential Library in West Branch, Iowa, as so many often note, are terrific - friendly, always available, encouraging, and of course knowledgeable. It is a wonderful spot to work. I yet again wish to express my gratitude to Craig Wright for all of his help with the photographs.\"\n\nAlexander, Benjamin F. The New Deal's Forest Army: How the Civilian Conservation Corps Worked (2018).\n\n\"In my library research, I have much appreciated the staff at the National Archives in both College Park, Maryland, and Washington, DC, especially Gene Morris, the specialist in College Park with the closest connection to the CCC collection.\"\n\nAlford, Kenneth D. American Crimes and the Liberation of Paris: Robbery, Rape, and Murder by Renegade GIs, 1944-1947 (2016).\n\n\"I am thankful to Holly Reed and Sharon Culley, archives specialists, National Archives, College Park....A special thanks to staff of the National Archives at St. Louis, Bryan K.

His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life (2020).\n\n\"I spent many happy weeks in Atlanta at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum, where Meredith Evans is the director and Keith Schuler, Christopher Geissler, Aisha Johnson-Jones, and and especially David Stanhope provided invaluable help. They were of assistance remotely, too.\"\n\nAlvandi, Roham. Nixon, Kissinger, and the Shah: The United States and Iran in the Cold War (2016).\n\n\"I owe special thanks to Christian Goos and Donna Lehman at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library for generously sifting through countless files for me in Ann Arbor and efficiently processing my numerous mandatory review requests.\"\n\nAlvarez, C.J. Border Land, Border Water: A History of Construction on the US-Mexico Divide (2019).\n\n\"In the archives two people stood out: Ketina Taylor at the National Archives branch in Fort Worth, Texas...Both volunteered hours of their time to help me understand the organization and scope of the collections they know so well. Without their expertise and guidance, many of the sources and images in this book that have never been seen before by researchers would still be filed away in obscurity.\"\n\nAnderson, Gary Clayton. Massacre in Minnesota: The Dakota War of 1862, the Most Violent Ethnic Conflict in American History (2019).\n\n\"So many have contributed over the years to this research that it is impossible to list them all. Robert Kvasnicka, at the National Archives, was always on hand to show me pertinent documents. Bob rediscovered the Sioux trial records in the Senate papers, seemingly lost for a time in the vast shelves of the archives.\"\n\nAnziska, Seth. Preventing Palestine: A Political History from Camp David to Oslo (2018).\n\n\"I am indebted to the archivists, librarians, and researchers who helped me locate material across multiple locations....In Atlanta, Keith Shuler, Brittany Parris, and Amanda Pellerin assisted at the Jimmy Carter Library; in Sim Valley, Kelly Barton and Shelly Williams assisted at the Ronald Reagan Library....\"\n\nAtkinson, Rick.

It is an incredible facility.\"\n\nBaier, Brett and Catherine Whitney. Three Days in Moscow: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of the Soviet Empire (2018).\n\n\"Professionals at presidential libraries are the gatekeepers of the history and wisdom of our highest office. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library opened its doors to me and allowed inside their remarkable store of knowledge and insight. In particular, I would like to thank...archivist Ray Wilson, who was so generous with his time and input; audiovisual archivist Michael Pinckney, who helped select wonderful photos for the book....\"\n\n\"Thanks, too, to archivists Doug Campbell and Buffie Hollis at the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library, who helped give substance to President Bush's role in the end of the Cold War. I also returned to the Eisenhower Library for research into the relationship between our thirty-fourth and fortieth presidents, and am grateful as always to the wonderful professionals there, especially acting director Tim Rives and archivist Mary Burtzloff.\"\n\nBaime, A.J. The Accidental President: Harry S. Truman and the Four Months that Changed the World (2017).\n\n\"Completing a book of 160,000 words feels like shepherding 160,000 beloved kittens across a busy highway. I owe a great deal of gratitude to a lot of people. First, I would like to thank the archivists at the research institutions where I visited, most notably the Harry S. Truman Library & Museum in Independence. Missouri; the National Archives in College Park, Maryland;...the FDR Presidential Library & Museum in Hyde Park, New York...\"\n\n\"Particular gratitude goes to Greg Bradsher at the National Archives, Randy Sowell at the Truman Library...\"\n\nBaker, Peter and Susan Glasser. The Man Who Ran Washington: The Life and Times of James A. Baker III (2020).\n\n\"Thanks too to a host of people who searched their organizations' files for us, including...Geir Gunderson at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, and Donna Lehman, formerly of the library;...\"\n\nBavery, Ashley Johnson. Bootlegged Aliens: Immigration Politics on America's Northern Border (2020).\n\n\"I have encountered excellent archivists across the United States and Canada and could not have completed the book's research without the help of Bill Creech at the National Archives, who screened hundreds of deportation files in the Immigration and Naturalization Service Records.\"\n\nBeevor, Antony. The Battle of Arnhem: The Deadliest Airborne Operation of World War II (2018).\n\n\"I once again owe a great deal to Dr. Tim Nenninger of the National Archives at College Park, Maryland....\"\n\nBell-Scott, Patricia.

The USS Swordfish: The World War II Patrols of the First American Submarine to Sink a Japanese Ship (2019).\n\n\"At the National Archives and Records Center at College Park, Maryland, Barry Zerby and again Kenneth Johnson guided my navigation to essential sources. Similarly, at the National Archives and Records Center in San Bruno, California, Robert Glass rendered valuable assistance in locating very useful information.\"\n\nBird, Kai. The Outlier: The Unfinished Presidency of Jimmy Carter (2021).\n\n\"The National Archives is an underappreciated (and underfunded) national treasure, and so too is the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum in Atlanta. Altogether, I spent nearly five months in the Carter archives, copying more than twenty thousand pages of Carter presidential documents. I could not have been so productive without the expert assistance of such professional archivists as Sara Mitchell, Mary Ann McSweeney, Aisha Johnson-Jones, Dave Stanhope, Brittany Paris, Keith Schuler, and the Carter Library director, Dr. Meredith Evans. I particularly want to thank Sara Mitchell for helping me at the last minute, and in the middle of the 2020 pandemic, to obtain access to a number of Carter photographs.\"\n\nBlack, Megan. The Global Interior: Mineral Frontiers and American Power (2018).\n\n\"Numerous archivists helped me survey the terrain of the Interior Department's activities. Early in the process, David Clark of the Truman Library directed me to the files of the Presidential Materials Policy Commission...At the later stages of my research, Barbara Cline of the Johnson library went above and beyond in retrieving scattered traces of space race correspondence. Year after year, Joseph Schwarz of the National Archives and Records Administration demonstrated great patience as I sought Interior Department personnel across numerous, seemingly disconnected, files.\"\n\nBlades, Brooke S. The Americans on D-Day and in Normandy: Rare Photographs from Wartime Archives (2019).\n\n\"This book would quite simply not have been possible without the National Archives in College Park, Maryland. Many staff provided assistance but a few stood out and must be mentioned: Andrew Knight in Cartography, and Sharon Culley, Holly Reed, and Kaitlyn Crain Enriquez in Still Pictures.\"\n\nBlume, Lesley M.M. Fallout: The Hiroshima Cover-up and the Reporter Who Revealed It to the World (2020).\n\n\"My deepest thanks to the many archivists who helped me and my team research this project, including...Abigail Malangone and Matt Porter of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library....Randy Sowell and David Clark of the Harry S. Truman Library & Museum...\"\n\nBoghardt, Thomas. Covert Legions: U.S. Army Intelligence in Germany, 1944-1949 (2022).\n\n\"The writer Patricia Cornwell emphasizes the importance of 'passionate' and 'dogged' research, and Covert Legions is no exception to this rule. The National Archives at College Park houses the lion's share of the mined documents, and I am indebted to archivists Paul B. Brown, David Castillo, William H. Cunliffe, Martin A. Gedra, Eric Van Slander, and Suzanne M. Zoumbaris for guiding me through the vast collections of their organization. A special thank you is due to the archives' director of classification, David Fort, who provided me with copies of several thousand classified documents. At Suitland, Maryland, the staff of the Washington National Records Center helped me review several court-martial records pertaining to espionage in postwar Germany.\"\n\nBolzenius, Sandra M. Glory in Their Spirit: How Four Black Women Took On the Army during World War II (2018).\n\n\"...and Sharon Culley at the National Archive College Park, Maryland, and many of their colleagues' relentless pursuit of materials was as helpful as it was impressive...\"\n\nBontrager, Shannon. Death at the Edges of Empire: Fallen Soldiers, Cultural Memory, and the Making of an American Nation, 1863-1921 (2020).\n\n\"I would like to extend a special thanks to Senior Military Archivist (retired) Richard L. Boylan, who spend several hours with me in the National Archives at College Park, Maryland, helping me fill out request forms, escorting me to the stacks, and alerting me to sources that only someone with his vast experience could locate. It was heartwarming and encouraging to work with such a seasoned scholar who went out of his way to help me.\"\n\nBorchert, Scott. Republic of Detours: How the New Deal Paid Broke Writers to Rediscover America (2021).\n\n\"I'm grateful to the archivists and librarians and their colleagues at multiple institutions whose work made my research for this book possible; my debt goes beyond what is reflected in the citations. Thanks, in particular, to Eugene Morris at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland, who helped me navigate the extensive WPA holdings...\"\n\nBouk, Dan. Democracy's Data: The Hidden Stories in the U.S. Census and How to Read Them (2022).\n\n\"...David Castillo of the National Archives at College Park, Jim Armistead of the Truman Library, Craig Wright of the Herbert Hoover Library...each aided me in acquiring copies of important archival materials.\"\n\nBowen, Wayne H. Truman, Franco's Spain, and the Cold War (2017).\n\n\"At the Truman Library, archivist Tammy Williams was especially helpful and creative as I searched for materials on a topic Truman himself did his best to avoid.\"\n\nBradley, Mark A. Blood Runs Coal: The Yablonski Murders and the Battle for the United Mine Workers of America (2020).\n\n\"I am especially grateful to David Ferriero, the Archivist of the United States, who read an early draft of my manuscript and gave me kind words of support.\"\n\nBrenes, Michael. For Might and Right: Cold War Defense Spending and the Remaking of American Democracy (2020).\n\n\"Jeremy Schmidt, then at the Ford Library, guided me to essential documents on defense spending in the 1970s and sent me links to digitized documents on the library's website.\"\n\nBrigham, Robert K. Reckless: Henry Kissinger and the Tragedy of Vietnam (2018).\n\n\"I am deeply thankful to the authors whose books I read and reread in preparation for this project.

First in Line: Presidents, Vice Presidents, and the Pursuit of Power (2018).\n\n\"I appreciate the help of the women who work at the Presidential Materials Division at the National Archives: Stephannie Oriabure, Jessica Owens, and Anna Yallouris. The staffs at several presidential libraries helped me cull through thousands of pages of letters and memos and they include Mary McMurray, Sam Rushay, and David Clark at Harry Truman's Library; Liza Talbott at Lyndon Johnson's library; Scott Russell and Jonathan Movroydis at Richard Nixon's library; and Elaine Didier, John O'Connell, Kate Murray, and Stacy Davis at Gerald R. Ford's library.\"\n\nBrown, Archie. Mighty Endeavor: The American Nation and World War II (2020).\n\n\"In the United States I have gathered much material also at the Reagan Presidential Library Archives in Simi Valley, California, where archivist Jennifer Mandel was an invaluable guide.\"\n\nBrowne, Blaine T. Mighty Endeavor: The American Nation and World War II (2019).\n\n\"Many thanks to Beth Fortson at the National Archives, Maryrose Grossman and Arabella Matthews at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library...\"\n\nBurke, Colin B. America's Information Wars: The Untold Story of Information Systems in America's Conflicts and Politics from World War II to the Internet Age (2018).\n\n\"The staffs at the National Archives in College Park and Washington, D.C., especially Jeff Hartley, often led me to unexpectedly valuable files....\"\n\nCarlson, Brady. Dead Presidents: An American Adventure into the Strange Deaths and Surprising Afterlives of Our Nation's Leaders (2016).\n\n\"Many thanks to those who took the time to talk with me, show me around on my travels, or send me ideas and information. Most of them are mentioned in the book, but a few who aren't deserve to be named here:...Tom Schwartz and Lynn Smith of the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum...and Anne Wheeler at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.\"\n\nCarlson, Elliot. Stanley Johnston's Blunder: (2017).\n\n\"I was able to pinpoint the location of those documents in the fall of 2012 with the assistance of NARAII archivist Christina Jones, to whom I now pass my thanks. After requesting the documents through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), I finally obtained them in the late summer of 2013, the final step facilitated by the ubiquitous Robert Reed, archivist, special access and FOIA staff. \"\n\n\"Robert Clark, supervisory archivist at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Hyde Park, New York, pointed my way through that institution's bewildering thicket of papers and documents.\"\n\nCarpenter, Daniel. Democracy by Petition: Popular Politics in Transformation, 1790-1870 (2021).\n\n\"Archivists too numerous to mention here facilitated much of my research. Let me acknowledge in particular Richard Hunt and his staff at the Legislative Archives Center of the U.S. National Archives...\"\n\nCarr, Barnes. The Lenin Plot: The Unknown Story of America's War Against Russia (2020).\n\n\"Much valuable help was provided by...Lynn Smith, Herbert Hoover Presidential Library...\"\n\n\"Cate Brennan, Loretta Deaver, Michele Brown, Sharon Culley, Professor David Fogelsong, Holly Reed, Abbi Oliver, Suzanne Isaacs, Kate Mollan, and Cara Moore at the National Archives and Records Administration helped immensely in my search for rare documents.\"\n\nCarroll, Andrew. My Fellow Soldiers: General John Pershing and the Americans Who Helped Win the Great War (2017).\n\n\"For going out of their way to help with my research, there are numerous historians, archivists, and librarians throughout the United States whom I wish to thanks, including:...Deanna L. Kolling and Kathy Struss at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum, and Boyhood Home;...Kurt Graham, Jim Armistead, David Clark, Sam Rushay, and Randy Sowell at the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum...\"\n\nCasey, Steven. The War Beat, Pacific: The American Media at War Against Japan (2021).\n\n\"I owe a large debt to all the staff members at many archives, especially...Liza Talbot at the Lyndon Johnson Library...\"\n\nCashin, Joan E. War Stuff: The Struggle for Human and Environmental Resources in the American Civil War (2018).\n\n\"These archivists gave prompt, cordial assistance during my research at various institutions: DeAnne Blanton of the National Archives....\"\n\nCeleski, Joseph. The Green Berets in the Land of a Million Elephants: U.S. Army Special Warfare and the Secret War in Laos 1959-74 (2018).\n\n\"At the National Archives in Maryland, Martin Gedra and Stanley Fanaras worked hard before, during and after my visit to scrub a vast amount of Vietnam-era documents to find materials on the White Star period.\"\n\nCeleski, Joseph. Special Air Warfare and the Secret War in Laos: Air Commandos 1964–1975 (2019).\n\n\"At the National Archives in Maryland, Martin Gedra and Stanley Fanaras worked hard before, during and after my visit to scrub a vast amount of Vietnam-era documents to find materials on this subject.\"\n\nChavez, Tizoc Victor. The Diplomatic Presidency: American Foreign Policy from FDR to George H. W. Bush (2022).\n\n\"I would particularly like to thank Ray Wilson at the Reagan Library, who was exceedingly generous with his time and made helpful suggestions.\"\n\nChopas, Mary Elizabeth Basile.

Preparing for War: The Emergence of the Modern U.S. Army, 1815-1917 (2017).\n\n\"As anyone who has done archival research can attest, some collections are more pleasant places in which to pursue the past then others. In my journeys, I have found the most helpful and considerate to be...Timothy Nenninger of the National Archives;...\"\n\nClarke, Frances M. and Rebecca Jo Plant. Of Age: Boy Soldiers and Military Power in the Civil War Era (2023).\n\n\"Many other people have contributed to this project over the years. To start at the beginning, back in 2009 an archivist at the National Archives in Washington, DC, took Frances on a behind-the-scenes tour of the stacks. That tour revealed one of the main sets of records that we eventually used to write this book - a collection containing letters from parents trying to get their underage sons discharged from service. We'll be forever grateful to Mike Musick for bending the rules and introducing us to this untapped treasure trove. He had retired by the time we returned to NARA to start our research, so we relied on Trevor Plante and DeAnn Blanton thereafter to figure out the intricacies of military historical records. On multiple trips to NARA over the years, their expertise was invaluable.\"\n\nClodfelter, Mark. Violating Reality: The Lavelle Affair, Nixon, and the Parsing of the Truth (2016).\n\n\"The author also thanks...Martin Gedra, Dr. Alex J.

I am indebted to wonderful and knowledgeable people at the Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kansas (particularly Valoise Armstrong); the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri (Sam Rushay and the late Liz Safly)...\"\n\nCobbs, Elizabeth. The Hello Girls: America's First Women Soldiers (2017).\n\n\"Others smoothed my path...Holly Reed,...and Mitchell Yockelson contributed generously. Their knowledge guided me. Their kindness encouraged me. The staff of the National Personnel Record Center in St. Louis, especially Cara Moore, provided invaluable assistance.\"\n\nConant, Jennet. The Great Secret: The Classified World War II Disaster that Launched the War on Cancer (2020).\n\n\"Also at the National Archives at College Park, Tim Nenninger, and in NARA St. Louis, George Fuller, who ventured into the 'burn bay' to look through sealed refrigerated units containing personnel records damaged in the 1973 fire. Holly Reed and Michael Bloomfield helped to find the still photographs....Thank you to...Valoise Armstrong and Mary Burtzloff at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum...\"\n\nConnelly, Matthew. The Declassification Engine: What History Reveals about America's Top Secrets (2023).\n\n\"In this book I have frequently described libraries as our most effective intelligence agencies - which they are. But they are intelligence agencies that also operate time machines, also known as archives. Without the people who command these vessels, we historians could never connect past, present, and future. Now that I have safely touched down once again, I wish to applaud these noble men and women, particularly...the irascible David Langbart....\"\n\nCowie, Steven. When Hell Came to Sharpsburg: The Battle of Antietam and Its Impact on the Civilians Who Called It Home (2022).\n\n\"I am deeply indebted to the archivists at the National Archives in Washington, D.C, namely Deanne Blanton, Robert Ellis, Danielle Ireland, and Trevor Plante, for helping me unearth a trove of war claims and congressional cases relating to the battle of Antietam.\"\n\nCucuz, Diana. Winning Women’s Hearts and Minds: Selling Cold War Culture in the US and the USSR (2022).\n\n\"I owe a great deal to the hard work of the archivists at the archives and libraries I visited throughout the years; in particular I thank David Pfeiffer at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland; Randy Sowell at the Harry S. Truman Library in Independence, Missouri; Chelsea Millner at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library in Independence, Kansas...Their enthusiasm for the areas in which they work, coupled with their ability to quickly and easily find the records that this Canadian historian researching in the United States needed, made my work not only easier but also much more enjoyable.\"\n\nCurran, Thomas F. Women Making War: Female Confederate Prisoners and Union Military Justice (2020).\n\n\"At the National Archives DeAnne Blanton assisted me early and often on a number of issues.\"\n\nDack, Mikkel. Everyday Denazification in Postwar Germany: The Fragebogen and Political Screening during the Allied Occupation (2023).\n\n\"The twelve-year project involved research at no less than twenty archives in four countries and the exploration of hundreds of record collections, a labyrinth of sources that I could have never navigated on my own. Among the many archivists and librarians who guided me, I must mention the generosity of Amy Schmidt and Eric van Slander at the US National Archives in College Park, Maryland...\"\n\nDaddis, Gregory A. Withdrawal: Reassessing America's Final Years in Vietnam (2017).\n\n\"All historians know the value of knowledgeable archivists and library staff and I have benefited from working with more than a few. John Wilson at the LBJ Library helped me find some important documents on pacification and the term 'one war'. At the Nixon Library, I have been fortunate to work with some amazingly talented folks: Greg Cummings, Pamela Eisenberg, Mike Ellzey, Mellissa Heddon, Ida Kelley, Meghan Lee-Parker, Ryan Pettigrew, and Jason Schultz.\"\n\nDavies, Wade. Native Hoops: The Rise of American Indian Basketball, 1895-1970 (2020).\n\n\"There have been so many archivists and archives staff members who have assisted me in this project over the years that listing them all would take at least two pages, and I would fear accidentally omitting deserving names in the process. Suffice it here to thank Lori Cox-Paul for assisting me on numerous occasions over a span of years, as I returned more than once to conduct research at the National Archives regional branch in Kansas City, Missouri. Special thanks also to Brita Merkel and Wade Popp for assisting with the many National Archives photos that appear in this book.\"\n\nDaws,Laura Beth, and Susan L. Brinson. The Greater Good: Media, Family Removal, and TVA Dam Construction in North Alabama (2019).\n\n\"Our research took us to numerous places across the South, and we are thankful to many talented and knowledgeable archivists and librarians who assisted us along the way....Maureen Hill, archivist at the National Archives Southeast Region in Atlanta, provided a great deal of assistance in navigating Record Group 142, particularly with regard to Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) family removal records and other TVA archives stored there.\"\n\nDearborn, Mary V. Ernest Hemingway: A Biography (2017).\n\n\"I have had significant help from archivists and librarians. Every Hemingway scholar is indebted to the matchless Ernest Hemingway Collection at the JFK Library and its staff, especially Susan Wrynn, Stephen Plotkin, Laurie Austin, and Connor Anderson - all of whom brought me materials, answered my questions, and generally made life easier for me.\"\n\nDietl, Ralph L. The Strategic Defense Initiative: Ronald Reagan, NATO Europe, and the Nuclear and Space Talks, 1981–1988 (2018).\n\n\"I am indebted to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library whose hospitality created an excellent working environment. I am particularly indebted to Ray Wilson whose expertise and counseling offered invaluable guidance.\"\n\nDixon, Chris. African Americans and the Pacific War, 1941-1945: Race, Nationality, and the Fight for Freedom (2018).\n\n\"In this age of digitization, librarians and archivists remain the often-unsung heroes of historical research....I am also grateful to Eric Van Slander, in the National Archives and Records Administration, at College Park, Maryland. As anyone who has researched in the National Archives can attest, the mass of material can seem overwhelming, and the systems to access that material occasionally obtuse - negotiating both was made easier with Eric's expertise and friendly help....At the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library (Austin, Texas), Liza Talbot procured materials relating to the African American presence in wartime Australia.\"\n\nDobbs, Michael. King Richard: Nixon and Watergate - An American Tragedy (2021).\n\n\"I would like to thank all the archivists at the Nixon Library, but particularly Ryan Pettigrew, who had the foresight to assemble a huge electronic database of the Nixon photo archive several years ago. This database proved invaluable when the library, along with other branches of the National Archives, was compelled to close its doors to researchers during the coronavirus pandemic. Without this electronic treasure trove and Ryan's assistance, I would been unable to obtain many of the photographs that appear in this book in time for publication.\"\n\nDobbs, Michael.

Contrary to the clichés of \"hidden,\" \"lost,\" or \"forgotten\" papers, these documents were all previously catalogued and retrieved by librarians and archivists, many of whom graciously scanned and emailed me materials so I would not have to travel across the country on a whim or a hunch. I have tried to maintain a list over the years and apologize to those I may have missed:...Haley Maynard and Amanda Weimer at the National Archives in College Park...\"\n\nField, Thomas C.

But seriously, everyone there has helped me in some capacity. Besides Holly in Still Pictures, Tim Nenninger, the branch chief for Modern Military Records, offered advice and wisdom to my research. He would often show up at my research desk with a box of papers, telling me he had stumbled over some documents that were relevant to Patton. You can't put a price on that.

Get Things Moving! FDR, Wayne Coy, and the Office for Emergency Management, 1941-1943 (2018).\n\n\"Months after getting back from my last research trip to DC, I stumbled across a 1973 book citing an interview Coy did in 1943 with the historian of the Foreign Economic Administration (something of a successor to Lend-Lease). The book's author had found it at the Washington National Records Center, the Archives' records management service for departments and agencies. I submitted an email inquiry to the National Archives asking if the document could be located. After searching, archivists Cate Brennan and David Langbart shared with me the definitive bad news that the hard copy had been destroyed with other agency records. The State Department might have it on microfilm, but most of its microfilms remained classified. It was possible, though not certain, that it might have been microfilmed as part of a different set. Typical of so many archivists I've worked with, they had a never-say-die attitude. Finally, Langbart found it on a different microfilm at the National Archives II site. Another obstacle: he said there was some administrative uncertainty about how to make a copy, including the need to formally declassify it. A few days later, he solved that. The quality was poor, he admitted, but beggars can't be choosy. I was thrilled to obtain it and appreciative of his extra effort. \"\n\nLelyveld, Joseph.

However, a great many Army veterans of the war, from generals on down, donated their fascinating papers to this library, as did many units that fought in theater. In addition, Eisenhower's letters and writings from his purgatorial days as an aide to MacArthur offer a rich portrait of the SWPA commander and his proclivities.

The Pearl Harbor Secret: Why Roosevelt Undermined the U.S. Navy (2020).\n\n\"I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the assistance of many archivists and librarians whose able support enabled this work to come to fruition. First and foremost is Nathaniel S. Patch, archives specialist with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Archives II, Reference Section, Textual Archives Services Division, who guided me over a series of weeklong visits through the labyrinth of a haphazard and convoluted filing system that constitutes hundreds, if not thousands, of Hollinger storage boxes that house the estimated half-million or more documents of one sort or another that deal with the years leading up to the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific. With his assistance I was able to screen through and find the key documents and pages that verified the the Imperial Japanese Navy had broken its own radio listening silence midway through its maneuvering toward Pearl Harbor during the first few days of December 1941-a critical event that was noted by a number of radio monitoring and intercept sources and duly reported to the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington, DC. Patch also helped me locate the all-important, original translations of the ONI's decoded 'Bomb Plot' messages referred to in the Pearl Harbor Attack Hearings.\"\n\n\"Archivists Kathleen Crosman, Susan H, Karren, and Patty McNamee of NARA's Pacific Alaska Region archive in Seattle guided me over a period of a week, gleaning key pieces of information that I was otherwise unaware of about the 13th Naval District's contributions to and operations of the West Coast Communications Intelligence Network (WCCI).
