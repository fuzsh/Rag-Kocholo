        "text": "Launcelot Vincent Stoneham Sherwood, D.S.O. and Bar\n\nBorn 1900 in Chiswick, Middx son of James Isaac & Ethel Lily Sherwood of 3 Flanders Rd, Chiswick (1901 census). He had an older sister, Ruby B born ca1899. He is related to the above Lt. Isaac Sherwood who died at the Battle of Waterloo, and eventually attained the rank of Brigadier in the Indian Army. Here is an abstract of his citation held at The National Archives, Kew (Class WO373/29:\n\n10 Indian Inf. Brigade, 5 Indian Divn, 4th bn. (DCO) 10th Baluch Regiment, Date 19 Oct 1941.\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry & dash in the fighting in Sudan & Eritrea. Major SHERWOOD is again recommended for the award of the D.S.O. particularly for his gallantry in the fighting of BARENTU.\n\nOn 30th Jan 1941 on Five Tebaldi Ridge when 90 men of 4 Baluch in a defensive position were twice strongly attacked by greatly superior enemy forces, Maj. SHERWOOD was instrumental in organizing the defence & beating off the first attack. He then led a counter attack which drove off the enemy and though himself wounded continued to direct operations on his sector of the front. During the second enemy attack Major SHERWOOD in one of the foremost posts, was again wounded. This officer displayed a complete disregard for his personal safety & was an encouraging inspiration to his men.\n\nPreviously at Gallabat on 5th Nov 1940 Major SHERWOOD led the successful dawn attack on Zariba hill. On 10th November, he took his company to ambush the enemy at Gallabat Fort. By his skillful handling of the situation, the ambush was successful & severe casualties inflicted on the 77th Colonial Bn. With small loss to himself.\n\nHe was also awarded a Bar to the D.S.O. for the following Action (WO373/10 fol.12):\n\nOn 29th Aug 1944, 3/10 Baluch Regiment the battalion which Lt. Colonel SHERWOOD was commanding, captured the high ground south of the Foglia River. It had been anticipated that this would form a secure base for reconnaissance of the river line and detailed planning for an attack on the M (onte?) CROCE  M CALVO sector of the GOTHIC line. As the advance had been rapid, the enemy was believed to have been surprised, so orders were received for an immediate attempt against the line by coup-de-main, and that afternoon Lt. Colonel SHERWOOD established two rifle companies in the valley and organized patrolling into enemy positions. As conditions appeared favourable, the battalion was ordered to capture the very strongly defended area on 30th Aug 1944.\n\nDuring this operation, which proved to be one of 36 hours intense close quarter fighting, Lt. Colonel SHERWOOD commanded his battalion with the greatest forcefulness and courage. He fully recognized the hazardousness of the task he had been set . Nevertheless he recognized at once that the operation was essential in the circumstances & that if successful it might prove decisive in securingthe left flank for the Corps. Advance.\n\nAfter the intermediate feature, M CROCE, had been captured & consolidated by 3 coys, Lt. Colonel SHERWOOD went (piece missing) More than once during the day the advance was held up, and only by Lt. Colonel SHERWOODs action in getting forward under fire to restore momentum, was the postion finally overrun.\n\nDuring the 2 days fighting, he remained calm yet forceful in all his actions; he kept Brigade HQ fully informed , making several suggestions for air & heavy artillery support Lt. Colonel SHERWOODs personal leadership and courage alone made vistory possible. The Bde. Command was with the battalion during the final mopping-up, and he spoke to many of the Indian officers & men.\n\nGranted an Immediate Bar (signed) General H R Alexander, C-in-C.\n\nLondon Gazette 16 April 1942:\n\nMajor Launcelot Vincent Stoneham Sherwood, 10th Baluch Regiment, Indian Army awarded in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in the Middle East during the period July, 1941, to October,1941: The Distinguished Service Order. .\n\nNavy List of Napoleonic War 1793-1815\n\nSHERWOOD, Lieutenant WilliamSHERWOOD, Lieutenant William Tuttle (nl 1807)\n\nFrom History of the Dorsetshire Regt. 1914 to 1919 (publ Hy Ling 1932 p.60) List of honours & Rewards: SHERWOOD, F.

These colonies later formed part of the Union of South Africa. The British fought directly against the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. The bloodshed that was seen during the war was alarming. Many of the British soldiers were physically unprepared for the environment and poorly trained for the tactical conditions they faced, as a result, British losses were high as a result of both disease and combat.
