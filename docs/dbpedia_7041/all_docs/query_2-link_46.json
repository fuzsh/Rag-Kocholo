On 15 January 1969, there was an aircraft carrier flight deck fire. This one occurred aboard the aircraft carrier USS ENTERPRISE (CVAN-65) as she was sailing in the Pacific Ocean about 70 miles south west of Pearl Harbor. In all, there were 18 munition explosions or detonations. Eight holes were blown through the flight deck and deep into the ship. It took in a little over three hours to extinguish all of the fires. This incident resulted in 28 deaths and 314 injuries. There were 17 aircraft damaged and 15 destroyed. The cost of repairing the structural damage to the ship and replacing the aircraft and other equipment was over 126 million dollars. \"All gave some, some gave All.\" Grass Valley, California 20 years\n\nAir Force\n\nBrent Parsley E6 Alysia Parsley To show my appreciation for his dedication to our country.

I had the privilege and honor to accompany Gordon as his \"Guardian\" on a trip to Washington D.C. with the Central Valley Honor Flight. It was during this trip that I learned of Gordon's heroism and service to our country. After Navy Boot Camp, Gordon's first assignment was the USS Arizona. After his first cruise at sea, he was transferred to the Aircraft Carrier, USS Lexington. On December 6, 1941, the USS Lexington sailed out of Pearl Harbor. The Lexington had to return to Pearl Harbor on December 10 for fuel and departed again the next day. One can only imagine what it felt like to see the destruction and realize the loss of life at Pearl Harbor. Gordon served on the Lexington until May 8, 1942. On that day at 11:20 a.m., in the South China Sea, the Lexington came under torpedo and dive bomber attacks, but the Lexington continued to launch and recover aircraft. Two torpedo and two bomb hits eventually resulted in uncontrollable fires. At 17:07 p.m. the order was given to abandon ship. Gordon was among 2770 crew members who were rescued from the water by several U.S. Navy ships. Gordon went on to serve on the Aircraft Carrier USS Suwanee until the end of the war. Gordon's last assignment was to the Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi, Texas. I salute not only Gordon, but all of our Veterans and Active Duty men and women who sacrifice every day for our freedoms, including the right to vote.

Yet, I have rarely been so deeply affected by any as much as the son of a former student of mine. Ken's story and his life has struck a deep chord with me. I did not know Ken as it was his mother who was my student, but from Karen's work with the Gold Star Mothers, I have come to know and admire Ken. I feel it is my loss that I did not know him. It is men like Ken who exemplify the best of America. And it is for us honor them for all they have done and for their sacrifices. From my grandfather's service in WWI to Ken's service now, men like these deserve the respect and thanks of a grateful population. They do have mine.

Miner PFC Nicole Russell My grandfather Sheril Miner served during the Korean War for the US Army beginning at the age of seventeen. While deployed he was awarded both the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, the latter being the cause of his honorable discharge. His pride and dedication for our country has instilled a personal duty I feel within myself to vote and believe in the importance of having my voice heard and actively participating in making our country a better place. A girl could not ask for a better grandfather. He was friendly and warm, always genuinely caring for the needs of anyone who could use his help. His time in the military especially allowed this quality of his to shine. He (along with other men in his company) was awarded the Bronze Star for bringing in wounded troops that he was told by his superiors were in too dangerous of a situation to retrieve. After he was discharged he continued serving his country through community service. My family could not be more proud of his memory and the legacy of caring, giving, and duty to his country that he has left behind. Surviving him are his wife Melvie Miner, daughters Juanita Miner and Debra Abrao, son-in-law Anthony Abrao, granddaughters Glenda Feraud and Nicole Russell, and grandson Ronald Abrao.

Oregon 4 years\n\nArmy Air Force\n\nErnest Phillips Chief Master Sergeant at Travis Air Force Base, CA Thomas L. Watson We dedicate this to Ernie Phillips who on Dec. 1942 had been promoted to the rank of Staff Sergeant and was ordered to serve as an aerial left waist gunner with the aircrew of Capt. Hiram C. Skogmo with the 568th Bomb Squadron part of the 390th Bomb Group. His first plane, it’s nickname which was painted on the side of the fuselage by the aircrew, “Six Nights in Telergma (Arabian Nights), was a B-17G flying fortress one of the most famous planes of World War II and also one of the most dangerous as Ernie was soon to learn as this plane was to make only 3 combat missions before it was shot down. Ernie and other prisoners were taken to the German Evaluation Center, Dulag Luft at Oberursel, Germany where all American aircrews would first be sent for processing. Here they would be strip searched, placed in solitary confinement and interrogated by the Germans. The interrogators would try to break down the prisoners minds to find out facts about Allied air strength, crew members and any other personal facts that could be used against other prisoners to learn military information Ernie gave them his name, rank and serial number as required by the Geneva Convention and was sent to a prisoner of war camp, possibly Stalag 17B in Krems, Austria. Ernie never spoke again about being a prisoner of war to anyone, as if it never happened. He was our hero!
